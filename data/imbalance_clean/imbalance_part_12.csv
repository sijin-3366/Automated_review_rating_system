4.0,The only thing I do not like about these shoes is they're very easy to get dirty. Even after spraying them with protectant spray. I wouldn't recommend wearing these unless its going to be perfect weather. Living in Pueblo where the weather is just as bipolar as the people I do not recommend.
4.0,Fits my laptop perfectly and it is super cute and easy to use. Has different pockets and extra strap so u can carry your laptop around. Definitely still using mine and I've had it for a little more than 6 months now
4.0,"they seem sturdy but a little cheap. Mine came in today, i got the medium, and they're way too big for my face. I wanted them for every day wear but they're a little too big for anything but a costume. Overall, very good product, just make sure you know how big you want them before you buy!"
4.0,I like this belt but it’s too short to fit like pictured. I suggest buying a longer length than you think.
4.0,"I like the top very much.  It washes well, but when it comes out of the dryer the lace in the front is a big wrinkled mess and it absolutely MUST be ironed.  That is the only drawback!  Otherwise, it looks really nice. UPDATE: I finally had to stitch down the lace every couple of inches on both sides because otherwise it always looked badly wrinkled, no matter how well I ironed the lace.  Now it always looks beautiful, even straight out of the washing machine.  See in the picture how nicely the lace lays flat now and always looks terrific. I recommend this top."
4.0,My husband says they’re very comfortable!
4.0,Cute camera scarf! The fabrics isnt as soft as I’d like but it’s a good product for the price!
4.0,"I am so much in love with the yellow color and this one looks so peppy with a nice tie in the front. Floral prints are really making it a perfect summer blouse. The fabric is not so great, but not bad either. The material is see-through, so need a cami underneath. For darker colors, it might be good without one. The blouse doesn't stretch so I had to go a size larger than my regular one. So please chose accordingly."
4.0,"Bought for Ren Faire. Fabric is kinda cheapy, but achievable look. Definitely not good for a hot day. Bodice kept bunching up, sliding against underdress."
4.0,"While being very cute, the product is not the same coloring as shown. The watch face is the same color as the band, which is a little disappointing. However, the watch is still cute so I kept it."
4.0,Great purse - great size for me...the inside pocket ripped but probably would be fine if you don't put a lot in it.
4.0,"The variety of colors are great to match with different outfits. The socks fit well although the toes were too long. Not a big deal but i did cut about half of the toe space, it looked better in my opinion after washing it. The gripping is great!"
4.0,Handy size and design
4.0,"I thought they would help a little better than they do, but it is an improvement."
4.0,"Nice warm flannel nightgown, very comfortable"
4.0,It's pretty good. Helps u see better at dark. Also dims oncoming headlights. Just does not impress me. Maybe my expectations were too high. But does it's work
4.0,These are cute but run big
4.0,"I only gave this a 4 star rating because the color is a bit more of a plum purple than a dark vibrant purple as shown in picture. I don't dislike that, I just like to receive the color shown in the image when I buy something. Other than that this purse is BEAUTIFUL and I love it, like I said I do like the purple, just not as pictured. The construction of the purse is really good and feels like a nice high end bag. I am so happy with my purchase."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift.  He was very happy with the look and fit.<br />The shirt is made well and holds up to washing and drying without shrinking or twisting.<br />The seller shipped right away, but the carrier took a couple weeks to deliver.<br />Other than that, I would highly recommend."
4.0,"Fits just right.  Hope it doesn't shrink in the wash.  It arrived too late for the event I was going to wear it for, so I'll save it for later"
4.0,This runs very close to true to size. However in lingerie I always order a size larger and I did with this one as well and it fit great. So if you are a 2x then get a 3x because this material does not have much give. I like mine to be a little loose but if you like it right then order your normal size. The length was great (I am 5’6) and it seems like good quality. Overall it’s definitely worth the price!
4.0,Bought to put on cupcakes for daughters birthday. I needed exactly 24. Glad at the last second I bought two packages. About 2-3 in each package didn’t work. Was a huge hit with the kids. I did wash before putting on cupcakes.
4.0,"It fit well for except the straps, I added a T-shirt to make it less noticeable"
4.0,"The band slips way too quickly through the connector loop. You could definitely steal the entire watch with a deft pull. Buy this for fashion, not security."
4.0,Top is mesh. Have to wear a black bra as it shows
4.0,"Nicely made and highly visible, a bit of extra length to go over your long-sleeves too! The thumb opening is rather strange in my opinion, it's a bit too tight to pull your thumb out easily, and I'm afraid it will tear. There is also a small pad that is supposed to allow touchscreen use, so what is the opening for exactly? The touch-pad itself is also basically useless because it is placed right in the middle of your thumb. If you just need to tap anywhere on the screen it's serviceable... if you have to touch a specific place on the screen, then it's very difficult to see what your tapping and it requires extra pressure as well. While running this is nearly impossible, so the touch-pad is basically useless. It would be better if it were moved more towards the tip of the thumb, or better yet moved to the index finger. If you're expecting to use your touchscreen device with these easily you will be disappointed. But if you're looking for a good high visibility running glove, they're pretty good. I wore them in a 5k in 25 degree weather, and they were just right for me."
4.0,The kids love it !!
4.0,My daughter really likes them.  For such a low price I could not go wrong.
4.0,I love it!!! Good quality..I choose the green.. Wonderful! I'm tall 162 cm..It's a little bit long but..never mind..it's a really nice dress!
4.0,"My wife ordered these for my Dr. Martens loafers, which I have worn to the point that I've collapsed the soles (but being Dr. Martens, still look like new from the outside).<br /><br />They fit perfectly in the shoes with no trimming and makes them more comfortable than they were new."
4.0,Nice earrings. Package for shipping was only a padded envelope resulting in squashed posts. Fortunately they are quality enough that they did not snap when bent back to correct position.
4.0,"A little tight across my thighs, but I should have gotten a large. Otherwise their comfortable and I like the way they look."
4.0,Well made but has a large circumference for the head.
4.0,"Well, it works fine. Very thin and simple looking, but it's acceptable. I hope it will last a little longer than the previous one from Barton that simply got rotten. The inner part is made of some interesting synthetic material that I suppose is waterproof."
4.0,This is a great tote . Straps convert easily from short to long or vice versa. Love the outside pockets . I do wish it had a sturdier base in bottom so It could sit up when placed on a flat surface but other than that I really like it.
4.0,Want buy again
4.0,Wonderful and comfortable dress. Very comfortable and material is so comfortable. I could've gotten a size smaller but still a good fit. Whether loose or snug because of the material.
4.0,Grandson really liked it but fit too large through the waist area. Very generous waist although the upper fit was great. He really like but it was out of stock to reorder.
4.0,I was looking for a smaller sized pair but I still really love these glasses.
4.0,"I needed a long-sleeve white layering shirt to wear under a polo (for warmth) and this did the trick. It is thin material so I would not have my child wear it on its own but for a layering shirt, it was sufficient and arrived quickly."
4.0,Great one piece for all your summer days. Halter and back straps are a nice length to fully secure the suit without having tons of extra fabric just hanging down your back. The bottoms are almost full coverage even for a larger bum. The top is padded for extra coverage and overall I absolutely recommend.
4.0,Works as advertised! My only complaint was that the box was opened and two of the pins were slightly bent. Not sure if I can find replacement pins anywhere.
4.0,"My first Tissot. Adjusting it to fit my wrist was easy. However, a major drawback was the difficulty I have while taking it off and putting it on. I love the bracelet, but when opened, I find it more difficult than I expected to slide over my hand. Every time, I feel as if I'm going t pop the band off the watch by putting too much force on the band. I am totally surprised this issue exists with such a brand name company."
4.0,"Love the look.  Material is very comfortable, but it does fit a bit large. I got a medium and it feels like a large.  Otherwise this is something I would recommend and might buy again, in a small."
4.0,Great weight fabric for my cold house.
4.0,"Just a basic T. Color matches the picture perfectly, it’s just such a cute shirt but has a boyish feel to it, it’s just straight. Wish it had a fuller feel in the body to fit girly curves. Super soft, quality is good, it’s literally just the boyish feel I get when I put it on that tells me not to buy another one."
4.0,"Small but pretty loved the length, hits close to my ankles."
4.0,I was looking for a fun dress I could wear to run errands or wear after leaving the pool. This is the perfect dress for that and more!<br />It’s light weight & flirty. I love that it’s knee length and doesn’t expose too much. The neckline is just right. I can wear both short & long necklaces. To give it a glass hour shape I wear a light belt. That changed the silhouette and makes the dress sexier. It’s easy to wash in the delicate cycle and air dry. No need to steam it or iron it. I love it!
4.0,"Light, easy to use and looks stylish. pleased with it no real complaints"
4.0,"Great fit,love the look"
4.0,But there was a hole in the left hand pocket☹️
4.0,These glasses are not as cheap feeling as I thought they would be - they are good for night driving and they do help with the glare from the sun on water - they are good sunglasses especially for the prices. They are not stylish in the least but for a day on the boat I don't care about style. If these fall in the water or get stepped on I am ok with it.
4.0,"Quick delivery,love the material"
4.0,love the outfit ordered a 12 month and its a littld to big but other than that I love this cute outfit.. he's a baby shark fan!
4.0,"The size small is a little big.  I am 5'6&#34; and weigh between 115-120 lbs.  It is going over a swim suit, but can work as an lbd.  It is exactly what I wanted but like a mini parachute.  I am still content with it for what I bought it for."
4.0,"Just weird that it has only the big pocket, not even a little zipper inside. But it’s held up decently."
4.0,Durable material works
4.0,Very satisfied with these slippers for the price
4.0,"Be sure you read the reviews about sizing! Follow the provided size chart! I'm normally a size 4 and I got the extra large and it fit perfectly for my waist and hips. The shape of the dress is really flattering for hip and butt curves. The top would not cover me (or it would but I wouldn't be comfortable going braless), so I just cut the halter off and made it a strapless. The part that attaches the halter to the green part of the dress is elastic. This was perfect because I'm 5'4&#34; so using it as a strapless dress allowed for perfect height.<br /><br />I bought this for a mermaid costume for Halloween. It was hard to see the scales in dark light, but most people were able to figure it out.<br /><br />I wore it twice and it held up well."
4.0,husband love the material if only I could get it in th right size
4.0,Beautiful novelty ring
4.0,"I like the way this dress fits and the way it shows my curves in my waist. It's really pretty in blue, I hope I can find it in red!"
4.0,"Strap on my last one broke, it was cheaper to buy a new one than it was to replace the strap"
4.0,Love the print but don’t like the waist- a little too high.
4.0,These are the first pair of this type sun glasses that have worked for me.  The only reason I kept throwing away dollars was the super convenience of clip-on and the flip up feature.  None would stay together more than a couple of months before the clip would break or the lens would fall off. These glasses felt solid out of the package and are still performing the way I hoped they would.  I have bought another pair to keep in a seldom driven truck.
4.0,"I got these to wear to work as a barista. They’re cute and comfortable, I’ve worn them through 8 hour shifts. They’re not hard to walk in at all and look less bulky when you’re wearing them. Only reason I’m giving them 4 stars is because they’re kind of narrow so definitely only buy if you don’t have wide feet."
4.0,"Nice colors,  not too big not small. Good size to add as assesory to the keychains I made."
4.0,"A little cheesy, but worked!"
4.0,"love this top just should have gotten asmaller size a little long im 5,11 and still long but i love it will order again a smaller size."
4.0,Fit my niece great
4.0,This dress is so cute! I am 5’7 and ordered my usual small and it fits just right. It was super wrinkled when i got it but it ironed right out pretty easily. The green color is very rich and pretty. It’s very thin light weight fabric but not see thru at all. I just wish it was a little longer in the sleeves
4.0,Love the fitting.
4.0,I had to sew the waist a little but overall sizing was a good fit. I love the crossing in the back.
4.0,This vest was pretty how ever I did end up returning it because it was smaller than expected. I'm going to order in a bigger size. I'm pleasantly surprised
4.0,This necklace is gorgeous.<br />The etching is spot on and so happy to find the words I wanted on it.<br />For price this can't be beat comes in a sturdy box with plenty of padding and remains discrete enough to fool your significant other
4.0,"From the wife: Purchased for a pineapple ukulele. It kept slipping all over the place, super frustrating. I extended all the straps as long as they'd go, and put it on like a sling under my right arm, then clipped the strap on to the sound hole. It stays pretty stable for a ukulele lanyard."
4.0,"My jeans size is 28 and I ordered the 32 size belt in olive. Which is absolutely gorgeous and perfect color. However, it does run a little small. I just ordered the 34 and will update my review as soon as I have received it.<br /><br />I will wait to send back the smaller size. I could make that work with a larger buckle, as they are easily interchanged with the three snap system.<br />The end of the belt barely slips under the leather loop and shows the three snaps, which is not a look I like. But as said, a bigger buckle might take care of that.<br /><br />Edit: I ordered the 34 and that is a much better fit, so I am keeping that and returning the 32<br />In fact, I am wearing it today and it is extremely comfortable. One slight disappointment: it is made in China"
4.0,"Thin stretch fabric feels almost like t-shirt material, nice for lounging around the house. It has real pockets too - I can fit my whole hand in them.<br /><br />Fits true to size, with elastic at the spot where the band & skirt meet. This is great for those cheat days, weeks, months...etc.<br /><br />Hoping they last!"
4.0,Good product at a very good price
4.0,I need the bracelet to enjoy!
4.0,"I bought these to help me sleep at night.they quiet the noise pretty good,but i am a side sleeper and they are a bit bulky for that.otherwise they do what they should and would be great mowing or shooting."
4.0,Wasn't as I expected....
4.0,"Nice watch band. Quality product with nice packaging but unfortunately did not meet my needs. I got this to wear with my Gear S3 smart watch but due to the way it attaches to the watch, the strap runs between the watch body and the wrist. This blocks the watches sensors from reading certain things like your heart rate.<br /><br />Nice product otherwise!"
4.0,Very soft and the material is not see through. Well made. I'm 5' 2&#34; and it reaches right above the knee. I wear a D cup and it wasn't too tight. I probably should of ordered a small rather than a medium. I weigh 145 LB.
4.0,Was impressed by how comfortable the material is.
4.0,These are perfect rights. A little on the thicker side and slightly over sized. I let my daughter wear them to dancinf. I love the grips on the bottom to help her not slip
4.0,Good medium weight fabric. Side pockets are WONDERFUL. Very comfortable high waist. Leg length is long enough for a taller person (I am 5' 3') . These are my favorite yoga pants.
4.0,"THESE ARE NICE PEARL CAGES AND GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE, BUT SOME OF THESE HAVE BAILS TOO SMALL TO ACCOMMODATE MY CHAINS.  WHY NOT MAKE THEM ALL ONE SIZE?"
4.0,This shawl is thick enough to keep me warm and light enough not to weigh me down.
4.0,loved it it fit just as expected super cute went passed my belly button it was perfect my friends love it to
4.0,Great for sun shading. Multiple ways to tilt and turn is a great feature. There are small holes in the seams so it is not going to keep  dry underneath. Wind over 10mph and it is useless.
4.0,the mask is very secure when tightened but the clips aren't as strong at keeping the mask attached to the lanyard.
4.0,These leggings are not see-through and are to size. My only negative comment would be that the top has no real fit so I am constantly worried it is going to fall (but it doesn't).  Not totally in love with them but a good one time purchase.
4.0,"Great product but I could not get it in the correct size, only one available and still was tempted to keep it but ultimately decide not to add another item to my closet that was not a great fit. Be careful to use prime as this product comes from Israel and without prime will be costly to return."
4.0,I like how sturdy the wallet looks and feels. I don't think it will fall apart anytime soon.
4.0,"The palms of these gloves are excellent, no complaints there. And the fuzzy back of the thumb is nice, especially for wiping ones brow.<br />The back mesh, however, is not so good. It started fraying and color fading on my very first ride. The neon, which I loved, is almost gone already.<br />The gloves look like they are old and used after just a handful of rides."
4.0,Nice charms. 29 out of 30 arrived. Will use all for ornaments
4.0,"Nice coat overall, not as heavy as I was hoping but it is definitely worth the money. Quality is also nice."
4.0,"Nice casual pants. It's nice to have a deep pocket and zippered pocket also.<br />Some of my shorts always slip things out from the pocket but not with these pants.<br />Not too thick, good for summer.<br />Also not too thin like some cheap pants."
4.0,"These were a hit, but have started to pill already after just a couple of months of wearing.  They make a nice layer in the cold weather though and we really like the design.  Girly, without having to be pink."
4.0,"I love this sweatshirt!  It doesn’t have any stretch, so it doesn’t feel like one of those comfy lay around the house sweatshirts…but I get compliments when I wear it out and you can adjust how cropped you want it to be.  I am going to order it in another color!"
4.0,This looked great but this was too big. Order a size down.
4.0,They are very pretty but are too big. My daughter still can't wear them
4.0,The bag is perfect and very comfortable.  Tge only issue I have is that the small pocket fell apart and everything ended up just being in the larger compartment.
4.0,Great go to dress
4.0,Lo conpre para mi niña de 11 años<br />Ime le queda ala de 6 supuestamente<br />Es para una de 12
4.0,"I'm a truck driver and I needed a bag for my gear, paperwork, small lunch box, small first aid kit, safety vest, gloves.  I have a 64oz bubba growler, fits.  My hands are free to carry other stuff.  I especially like the idea of adding pouches.  This came with one.  I put my Moto phone and battery charger with cords in it.  It's a sturdy bag.  The zippers will last.  I'm happy with the initial order.  I only gave 4 stars because I've only had it a week."
4.0,It is beautiful.  The size is larger than  expected.
4.0,"I had to choose 1 to get this box. I gave 4 starts, but I can't figure out how to put it on. Sorry so dumb, bur there were no instructions."
4.0,I’m 5 foot 1inch and I weight 128lbs I got the medium and they were pretty big on me.
4.0,The material is thin but makes for a great warm weather cami or undershirt.
4.0,Cute little cover up! Worked great for my photo shoot :)
4.0,I just received my dress in the mail today and was very satisfied when I tried it on. It fit perfectly. And it even has pockets! The material isn’t high-quality but it doesn’t look like it’s going to easily fall apart either. I don’t think I will put it in the dryer that’s for sure. I am 5‘4“ and weigh 140 pounds and I bought the medium and it fit perfectly. I was worried about it being too low in the front but I feel like that fits perfectly also. I might just buy another one in another color too!
4.0,"Great product for the price. The chain is cheap and if you have longer hair, be prepared to have it caught a lot on the chain. The charm itself is very nice and it alone is worth the price."
4.0,Love the color ... I'll be buying some more!
4.0,It fits fine.  Should probably order 1 size larger.  I like my sweat shirts a little on the larger side & this fit me like a regular snug shirt .
4.0,I've been wearing the engagement ring for 2 months now & I think that is enough time for this review. The ring is very pretty & good quality for the price. Haven't had any issues of loose or lost stones which is better than the last ring I purchased elsewhere & that one cost more. Now granted it's a really inexpensive set so if you are expecting it to look or feel expensive it won't. The packaging it came in was really lovely. The only 2 drawbacks it has had is it doesn't keep a shine for long before needing cleaned & the sizing was just slightly off. I ordered a size 7 & it's just a little looser than I like. Overall though a great set for the price.
4.0,"looks, and fits as described, good buy"
4.0,I needed an upgrade for my cheaters and found these.  I like them a lot. My kids think the colors are cool.  I'd get these again when I need more cheaters.
4.0,Dress fit great. Just a little short for 5’8”. Purchased a medium.
4.0,"much wider than i would have liked, but overall beautiful"
4.0,Weird shape inserts but I took them out and I really just wanted it for embellishment on scoop neck tops and it works/looks great for that 👍🏼💕
4.0,"love the style, they fit great. However the metal is a bit flimsy, and the gradient tends to smear with oils and such"
4.0,Love the fit ! The design is so cute
4.0,"I've only been wearing this necklace for about a week now and there has been a definite change in my pain level. I have doubled the necklace to make it an anklet because I have a rebuilt ankle with a metal plate in it. The scar tissue and lack of flexibility has given me almost constant pain no matter how much I've stretched applied heat to it. I'm not sure that the magnet is actually healing anything, but it is certainly giving me some relief, and it seems to improve everyday. I am happy I decided to try it myself and ignore both the debunking and success claims to draw my own conclusions. I can't promise it will work for you, but it certainly has helped me."
4.0,Not great for Florida weather but boyfriend likes it.
4.0,Great price and very quick shipment
4.0,I am pleased with the overall look of this coverup and the material it’s mad of. My only complaint is that I wish was that it was an inch longer.
4.0,Beautifully crafted bee earrings.Perfect size with a bit of sparkle.
4.0,Awesome boots but they run small
4.0,"This dress is kind of an always length, but I made it work with my red boots. I have gotten lots of compliments on it every time I wear it. I originally bought it to wear to Pirate Fest in Tybee Island, but it has quickly become a go-to dress for me. I wish it were either a few inches shorter to hit mid calf or a few inches longer to touch the floor."
4.0,It's very cool. I love it but as an adult with an average sized head it is tight. I'm sure with wear it'll stretch.
4.0,This dress is very cute. Material is a bit sheer and there is no elasticity. It fit a bit snug but was still very flattering!
4.0,The colors and patterns are nice. The fabric is thick but the size is a bit bigger than I've expected.
4.0,"Very Cute.  Bought it to put on my Maid of Honor's Bouquet and I think it will be perfect. Nice quality piece, good price for what you are getting. It will never be mistaken for white gold, or even sterling silver so it doesn't look like something authentic but it is very pretty and I am very happy with the purchase.  I have no problem adding this to the bouquets as a gift.  Thank you so much for once again helping me find beautiful items at very affordable prices."
4.0,"I love it he fabric is very soft and fit loose as I wanted. I wish they made in other colors, I will buy them !!!"
4.0,If you get black and white you have to hold it at just the right angle for the picture to look good. I ordered on Tuesday and it arrived Friday. Fast shipping and my bf loved it. Would have given 5 stars if picture was good from all angles
4.0,It really is a beautiful set. Four stars only because I find it too heavy for jewelry.
4.0,"Just as advertise, fit perfect"
4.0,These earrings are very pretty. However they are tiny! I am disappointed that they are so small. The pic and description made them seem bigger. They were packaged different too. Not boxed. I gave them as a gift. Too small for me.
4.0,"Super cute. Perfect size. Very clever design with the bottom zipper compartment, the two compartment in the top, and the side zipper pocket for change. I would have given it 5 stars except one side of the top clasp is hard to open/close... but not enough to not use this little wallet."
4.0,Very nice box and cute cuff links. The only thing is there are multiple bubbles in one of the cufflinks obscuring the view of the thermometer face.
4.0,I usually get a small but it was a little bit baggy in certain areas. I decided to keep it as a more casual day dress vs night out.
4.0,"Really Nice material, soft and flowy. Fits exactly as I wanted it to. 5'2&#34; 118lbs, Got the Small."
4.0,"It fits a lot larger than I expected. I haven't decided if I will return it for a smaller size yet or not. The waist tie is kind of flimsy. The rest of the dress however looks fantastic. It's a pretty casual design, but I expect this to be a regular dress for me."
4.0,"The spring bars could be better, but most of them are weak to begin with. The band seems fine."
4.0,Good too for the price. The material is good. Not too thick more on the flimsy side. I am 5’3 and 115 lbs and ordered a small. That’s the smallest available. It is pretty loose but if you tuck it into your pant it may fit fine but still runs large.
4.0,Looks exactly like product. However it does run a little small in the thigh area. If you have a thick thighs with a smaller waist I would suggest going up a size. Take the pads out the bra if you have bigger boobs. (My suggestion)
4.0,Arrived quickly and fit good
4.0,"My husband loves FO4 socks, but these wore thru innless than a year.  But they are fun and if you don't care about longevity I'd still by them because they make him happy.  Just don't expect them to last years."
4.0,"This silk nightgown looks and feels very nice. It fit pretty well except for being a few inches shorter than expected, not a deal breaker though. I washed it and air dried, and it held up well. The color is quite rich and true to the pictures for me. I will enjoy lounging around in this nightgown."
4.0,This belly button jewelry is absolutely gorgeous with the pop of color in the silver but the leaf is a bit small hints the 4 stars. Overall I really do like this jewelry piece.
4.0,Very cute. Too big for my daughter but she’ll grow into them within the year.
4.0,"Nice shirt its all poly so it won't shrink.  For me large was a little big. 5'-11&#34;, 160#."
4.0,"I have ordered every cartilage earring, known to man, through Amazon. These are the ONLY ones that do not cause me ANY type of discomfort. I finally found my holy grail! I'm going to order the silver ones next. I took off one star because the ball backing is hard to screw in, from the back."
4.0,Its a nice bag not as big as i thought it would be
4.0,Have gotten several compliments on the style and color!
4.0,"These are a great product. They are very soft and heavy/warm which is perfect for winter weather. The colors are great! My grand daughter loves them. I would of given them 5 stars if the pants waist were adjustable.  The tie is just for looks. My grand daughter is very thin with long legs. So while the length fits, the waist does not. This would be such an easy fix by making  the waist tie adjustable."
4.0,"I'm 5'1&#34; 115 lbs and a small fit me somewhat spaciously, especially around the waist. The length hits me at my knees.  I have a 25 inch waist, and the waist is at least two inches bigger than that. I love this dress, so I'll keep it and just wear a belt with it.<br /><br />The embroidery is beautiful and classy; I can definitely wear this to work. The fabric is odd, though, like a heavy pseudo-nylon feel, rather than cotton or polyester than feels like cotton."
4.0,Definitely only worth what I paid for it. Nothing more. It's cute but looks much cuter on the other customer pictures. Maybe once it's not so wrinkly I will like it better. I have pretty small breasts and think I would find it to be more pleasing if it fit better [the outside/side boob straps are too baggy on me for some reason] so I just might cut/sew it up a bit and make it better.
4.0,Love this rain scarf and I am not a scarf person. It is so much easier than trying to hold an umbrella and other items and trying to get into car. I have had some ppl joke with me about it but most very impressed and ask where I got it.
4.0,"I wish the polarization was more distinct, it’s ok, just not enough for me. They look great and because the lenses are large, I have full eye coverage."
4.0,"Sparkles didn't fall off, I wish the chain straps were shorter but since they are detachable I just twisted them a few times for a cute design in addition to them working."
4.0,They work great. They do a great job of blocking out the light but yet are very comfortable to wear.
4.0,Girls are still playing with it after 2 months and it seems to be in good shape
4.0,I bought this for myself for christmas.  It's a lovely watch and quite a bargain.  So far so good.
4.0,have not had chance to try them at night yet. I hope the polarized lens makes oncoming headlights dimmer.
4.0,"This bag is very nice. The quality is awesome, the size is perfect. The wooden ball did fall off after a few months but I actually prefer it without it. The gold handles can get a little discombobulated and out of place so I often have to readjust it."
4.0,The material is great.
4.0,Nice Christmas charms.  makes good earrings
4.0,"Good for the price, ran a little big on me(baggy and length). Im 5'3 and usually get a medium in tops."
4.0,It was easy to fill
4.0,"Super cute, but runs small.  Definitely get one size larger than you would typically wear."
4.0,Loved it until I washed after first wear. Fringe fell<br />Apart.<br />Update- excellent customer service. After reading my review they shipped a new cover up.
4.0,Ordered Topaz by mistake --reordered as Sapphire --(for Sept)
4.0,"My brother loved it for Christmas, but it is pretty long so he had to either fold the bottom with the symbol or have a couple inches of hat standing at the top of his head. But he's weird so he didn't care about that. He loves it!"
4.0,My niece loves this purse..I gave it 4 stars because I which there was at least one pocket on the inside of the  purse....but overall AWESOME!
4.0,Really cute but very tiny. Actually would work better for a child.
4.0,Love the glasses!! Beats buying over priced designer glasses. Only downside is that they get stuck in my hair here and there but no big fuzz!
4.0,"I like it...but if you have a bigger chest...it will be very tight and difficult to zip up.  I can't zip it by myself, which is disappointing. Otherwise it's a cute dress and I've gotten compliments wearing it."
4.0,"I never got over my love affair with Fonzie when I was 12 years old, so when I saw a Facebook friend post this product on her page (thanks, Jeannie!!!), I knew I had to have this. Since we live something like 1,500 miles apart, I won't look like a copycat. What I like about this product: it's compact and cute and it looks a lot like a black leather jacket. What I don't like about it is the usable portion is quite a bit smaller than the dimensions in the product description. It's actually 8"" X 5"" X 3"" (at the bottom) and 2"" (at the top). It doesn't hold as much as I would like, though I tend to like to carry way more than I really need. I can fit in my wallet, checkbook, a purse pack of tissues, and a few pens. My phone - a phablet - does not fit. The strap is not easily adjustable, so it's a little longer than I like (I do believe this would be perfect for someone just a few inches taller than I am). I added a thick key ring to one of the links on the strap so I can easily attach my keys to the purse with a carabiner clip."
4.0,Really easy to use but couldn’t get the scuffs I had out completely. That’s due to where I work though. Carbon black is pretty hard to get out of any type of material it comes in contact with.
4.0,"The nose was a little wonky but you can work around it if you have to. Masks can be like that sometimes so I wasn't totally angry about it. I won a costume contest at work with it and its really cool. in case anyone doesn't know, this mask only covers your nose, your forehead and the top of your head. It has hair. it doesn't cover your eyes, that guy in the picture just has good make up in case anyone thinks this is an entire mask."
4.0,"I love them. Heart shaped glasses have become my trademark and these are REALLY fun, cute, and just a little different. Definitely worth the money."
4.0,"Item looks as described and seems to work fine. However usually watches come with a tab that you can pull to activate the battery but this one came already on so i dont know how long the battery will last, also no instructions book. For the price and overall look this is a good buy"
4.0,Much better quality than i expected
4.0,very thin and light weight.  No noticeable odor after wearing them for a two hour workout at the gym.  The seem to be well made.  There was some slight fading when I hand washed them in cold water with woolite but that's to be expected.
4.0,"The gloves feel great, the touch pads could be larger, but the fit is near perfect for me. The only thing better would be custom fit gloves. They are smaller then normal size."
4.0,Cute but cheap construction for the $22 price tag; Surface was all scratched
4.0,"Very comfy. Still not sure about the color match. I don't know if I like the pattern and color mismatch. Can't decide if it is trendy or odd. But it's inexpensive enough, you could be adventurous."
4.0,Very pretty...metal is cheap looking up close but I am still happy with the purchase.
4.0,Nice presentation haven’t had it long cool box
4.0,A very good purchase for the low price.
4.0,Thought it would be a disappointment but turned out great I am 5 7it hits right above the ankle . Quality is good not see tru.could have been longer by three inches  going to try stretching it by putting under my heels oh and it is waist high
4.0,Great fit. Only complaint is the front doesn't hang very evenly.<br />Beautiful plum color.
4.0,Kept me warm all day!
4.0,Where has this item been my whole life! I switch purses often...& this item is ideal! Even though every purse has a different inside I always know where my items are b/c this insert never changes! Switching purses is a breeze & quick! Love!!!!!
4.0,It's ok.  Light weight.  My wife says more like a dress than a shirt.
4.0,The company definitely goes the extra mile with including all sorts of extras for the sunglasses. Definitely worth the very reasonable price.
4.0,Only took 12 days to get here! Ordered on the 17 got on the 29th.  Seems a little big but will fit my sister by the summer since it is a summer dress.  Its beautiful would definitely buy again for when she grows out of this size. Great price😊
4.0,Good fit at a good price.
4.0,"Bought this dress for a friend, looks nice and flattering."
4.0,"Love these pajamas. They were slightly bigger than I thought they would be for a medium, but not so big that they’re uncomfortable or falling off."
4.0,"Even thought it was a little big, it is just as pictured and my husband loved it!"
4.0,"Nice, wide belt. It is elastic so it stretches, but it is a little small. I have a pretty small waist and I have to wear it on the last notch. If you are wide-wasted it may fit too snug."
4.0,Denim is great quality and looks super cute but I only gave 4/5 stars because I just opened and the belt buckle looks tarnished and weird. Major bummer when the belt is one of the reasons I even considered the dress!
4.0,"When it comes to swimsuits, I always wear a small or XS top and a medium bottom. So I ordered a small, because I wanted the cool top to fit and didn't care about the plain black bottom. Unfortunately, it was the bottom that fit me perfectly. The top is too big :( It actually looks okay, but the design is too high, and chokes me. I wish I could've ordered an XS to be safe, but it wasn't an option. It's still a really cute suit though, so I'll probably gift it to a slightly larger friend, rather than return it."
4.0,"Good product, good fabric, fit well.  Just wish they weren't so expensive."
4.0,"Overall a good suit... I am 5'5&#34;, 130lbs. I consider myself to be pretty middle of the road when it comes to my build. I am a cross between athletic and slim. The leg holes are a bit snug, and the bust a bit loose (I am a full B cup). BUT, overall, it does the job for lap swimming. Perfectly fine range of motion, and the top certainly isn't loose enough to pull down or anything. I'm not in LOVE with it, but it serves it's purpose!"
4.0,"Material isn't the most durable and it shows everything, but I like it."
4.0,Have multiple piercings and this ones work great. Shame they are not silver.
4.0,"Out of the package these boxer briefs fit snug, especially on the legs. Not sure they really qualify as a ""classic"" fit, since I rarely had that experience with other cotton boxer briefs. With a little wear, though, they break in and become quite comfortable.  (That might also be why they suggest washing them first.) As others have mentioned, they don't have a built in fly. They are about as simple a boxer brief as there could be, but they get he job done."
4.0,"other then it looking dirty but I guess it was part of it, it still looks cool, it was a present for my friend."
4.0,"Nice color, nice fabric. A bit on the smaller side, and does cling a little more than I would like. But very comfortable."
4.0,To long I’m 5 21/2
4.0,"If you do happen to order this item, order one size up. It runs small."
4.0,I love the colors in this bag and the style. It was a great purchase.
4.0,Pr good ngl
4.0,Fit is alittle small
4.0,"I had such a problem finding underpants for a 2 year old that were boxers. I saw these and figured I would give them a try. I was hoping the crotch area was thicker so I can use them for training pants, but they are just thin material. However, they fit so good on him and they look so cute. I will be getting more. However I would love it if they would make these thicker like training pants because my boy loves them."
4.0,"They are just as pictured which might be too big for some shoes. Mine are super small and you can see a bit of the sock, but with the sticky edges you can easily pull them down so they stick lower on your toes. The sticky on the bottom is a little annoying, but that's because I have plastic shoes :) when I wear my other pair with the cloth lining, you can't hear it squeaking."
4.0,The arms are a little tight but not bad and the material is a lot heavier than I expected
4.0,"I'm 5'2"" and 140lbs and I bought the medium size. I was looking for shorts to lounge around my house in on hot days, and these definitely fit the bill. The pockets are large enough to actually be useful, the drawstring waistband fits comfortably, and the shorts are long enough so that they don't ride up. However, the fit especially makes them look like something a 12-year old boy might wear and I feel silly if someone sees me wearing them when I take out the trash."
4.0,Nice and durable dress
4.0,I love the color and the lightness of the fabric. But I’m not happy with how wrinkly it is
4.0,"Good sweatshirt for the price. Not as high quality as Champion, but I prefer the fit of these over Champion. Comfortable, fits nicely."
4.0,"love the print, but design isn't terribly functional.  flimsy construction.  I want to use this all the time, but it can't handle that kind of use for two reasons: it won't hold up, and it is impossible to find anything in it.  I give the concept five stars, but execution I give two stars."
4.0,My daughter is 5 and I bought this so it wouldn't be tight. She is long waisted and this fit great.  She just had to roll up sleeves a tad bit.
4.0,Cleans pretty well. Isn’t an amazing product either.
4.0,"I like these pants, but I’m not convinced they’re worth $85. They don’t stretch very much so when you kneel down they just pull down from the waist. There are no belt loops so you can’t solve that problem. The material and construction are nice though, and it’s a good, more durable alternative to traditional khakis. I’m 5’5 and 130lbs. I ordered the size 4 and the length is perfect but the waist is loose."
4.0,Great glitz for my Fitbit.
4.0,Overall a great product. The only issue I have is that the cord is too short. Otherwise good for beginners
4.0,"This was a gift for a sweet girl and she loved them.My honest opinion about them they look sparkling but I would prefer for them to be metal,the stones seem to be glued on plastic, it looks like a ball of gum where they stick the stones on it.But for the price and for little girls they are ok"
4.0,Very cute. Will look nice e over my swimsuit.
4.0,"This is a very nice looking watch.  You can see the mechanics working.  You do have to wind it, which my son thinks is pretty unique.  The only issue is that it is really hard to snap on."
4.0,"These are good looking and great feeling shorty pajamas.  They are light weight enough to be cool but heavy enough not to be revealing.  The fabric is soft and silky feeling, the construction is good.  The only problem I have is with the sizing.  I am between a medium and a large, but these supposedly large size pjs are just slightly snug.  Definitely order a size up."
4.0,"The EDC bag itself is functional for it's size. The pull string area for the water bottle Arrived with one section Not stitched / glued into seam, where the toggle string is. Making me feel doubtful if it would firmly secure a 32oz water bottle in present condition. Maybe super glue cloth where it should have been stitched. A product improvement would the addition of a condensation drain holes. Bag has a couple of fixed points to attach keys and such. The multiple MOLLE attachment points on bag and strap are good to affix a Cree tactical flashlight, other molle bags, a fire striker or even a mini crowbar. The rear zipper pocket for a 2L hydo bag seems like it would a little tight when main bag is full of gear, again no drain hole. Maybe a 1.5L? The interior also had different sections to hold items and what appears to be a quick release buckle strap in main area to secure something. I am happy with the bag,over all, the wide chest strap is quite comfortable. The narrow band of velcro will not hold 3&#34;x2&#34; patches securely, strip patches maybe. I must say that when one of the bag's selling points, (external water bottle area) arrives with obvious poor quality control, makes me wonder how the bag will hold up to daily use. Will update if I encounter more fails."
4.0,"Love this dress, my first by this manufacturer. I’m 5’4” / 36B / 145 lbs / athletic hourglass shape and the small fit well. Medium was a hair too big through the hips. At my height I felt both sizes were about 2” too long, hitting right in the middle of my kneecap. Plan to have the dress shortened. I love that this is a faux wrap. Belt tie wraps twice around the waist to really create nice definition. Will definitely order more from PattyBoutik in the future!"
4.0,This was a nice item. Gave it to one of my daughters for Christmas.
4.0,"These face mask are certainly nice and breathable,  not so comfortable after it being on your face for over 30 minutes, skin begins to irritate,  leaving marks on my skin, although it's adjustable it doesn't work the way it should. It does help insulate and helps provide an extra layer to keep you warm, especially towards the cold  weather."
4.0,"Pretty, nice enough for the office. Lightweight the earring clasps worry me a bit but, for the price I could buy another pair if they were to break. They came in a cute box however, these are not  something I would give as a gift. I bought these for myself to dress up my office ware and believe these fit the bill. Thumbs up especially for the price."
4.0,Lindos.
4.0,Super cute beanie! I wear it even if I'm having a good hair day because it makes a dull outfit more fun. Also works great in the cold weather and it's an amazing price!!
4.0,"Very comfy, breezy and perfect for teacher gear in the coastal South!"
4.0,Sweater fit and feel is good only problem neck opening is large.
4.0,"These worked great, and I just came back from a west coast ride of over 2,000 miles.  I like to wear carpenters pants, all the time, even while riding, but they tend to ride over boots, in fair winds, or at high speeds.  The only problem I had with these, was that they occasionally loosened up in really heavy winds, or when my pants started flapping.  It was a simple matter to readjust, during stops, but that's why I gave them a four star, instead of a five.  They look terrific, and work very well."
4.0,They are nice and comfortable worth the money
4.0,Very cute except one pair of pants came with a white spot on them. Looks like a bleach spot or something.  :(
4.0,Is something that I like and has a big desire  But has too much weight
4.0,Love this romper. Was a tad large in the chest area but they did not have a medium and did not want to return it.
4.0,It is beautiful. Material a little light. Pay attention to the size chart. I usually wear an XL but my best fit for this dress is 5X. Shipping was lightening fast. Would definately recommend
4.0,"I bought this item for GF, she likes it fine.  It will go w/a variety of outfits/colors, is unique and stylish."
4.0,I gave these as a gift for Christmas and the receiver loves them.  I wound up buying a pair for myself as well.
4.0,The fit is good although this era had straighter dresses so I would advise not having such a curvy cut- if similarity to the actual time period of the 20s is important. The high quality of the hand sewing -very impressed with the dress. I will be wearing it to a special 1920s party in the next couple of weeks.
4.0,"Like the fabric, hem up about 4 inches and still have to wear heels."
4.0,Fits like expected but sleeves were short
4.0,"I was looking for a red dress identical to Agent Carter's in Captain America and this is pretty spot on. I was very pleasantly surprised at the high fabric quality for the price! There is a little stretch but the fabric is quite thick. Nice clean stitching up the sides and the zipper is inset in the back so it is more seamless. The shoulders and sleeves are roomy enough to move, which is usually non-existent with my broad shoulders. The neckline is very modest and the pleats around the shoulders lay nicely and creates a subtle puff on the sleeves. There is still a little room in the chest, but I'm a 34B and planning to wear a padded bra to fill it out a little more. It is very tight on the waist and hips! My waist is 28&#34; and hips 37&#34; and the dress is skin tight, but not clingy. Definitely need seamless underwear or a shaper to keep it smooth underneath but if you have a flat stomach it is a very flattering fit. I'm 5&#34;6 and the dress hits right at my knees. Appropriate to wear in a modest work place but it is very sexy in that classic 40s way!"
4.0,"I purchased this dress for lounge wear. The material is better than expected but the dress requires hand washing or dry cleaning. Other then that, I love the dress, very comfortable."
4.0,"These are very nice earrings, definitely well made, and could be called fine quality. They are going to need care and respect, because they are delicate. But if you can do that, these are for you. Every aspect of these will bend, if you don't treat them just so. And if they bend just the wrong way, they won't clasp right until you bend them back. Of course they never would have worked for me in the first place, because I have stretched lobes, but even in my few minutes with them they were deformed. Everything about them works well, and is made fine. But mishandle them one time, and you'll spend an hour reshaping them to get back to where they came from. Beautiful and fragile."
4.0,Super cute and very flattering. My only complaint is that the ruffles at the top fold in towards my chest....but that may be just because I am well endowed on the top.
4.0,"Quality matches the price. They fit well, but ultimately I would rather spend a little more money on a better brand like beyond yoga."
4.0,"The sole of the shoe is a little scratchy, so I have a hard time wearing with bare feet, as was my hope. Still, they're pretty great for around the house and yard."
4.0,"Very nice shoes,color as shown. I purchased for a wedding, but wanted shoes I could also wear to work, out etc.,as my go-to brand/style was discontinued. These are definitely very versatile shoes, and moderately comfortable, and I received several compliments. I wore them for about 5hrs or so before I was ready to take them off, walking, standing, dancing and sitting.<br /><br />I will probably buy in black, too."
4.0,"Loved the watch but didn't come in the box it showed it would, but other than that it's awesome."
4.0,"Fit very well, seems to be fairly well made."
4.0,"However, the picture makes it look bigger than it is.  Other than that it is great.  The fabric is lush and soft to the touch.  Makes a nice sound when you're dancing!"
4.0,"However,  the length was perfect and having long legs this was wonderful.  Also, the zippers and construction are good quality.  Just wish they were a little more substantial."
4.0,Ordred on March 30 and arrived from China April 20th. Not too bad. Red color. XXX size. I wear US 18-20 in jeans. A bit long on me. Straps way too long so it is good they have adjustable straps which I moved to the most forward position to pull up the gown.Very nice fabric. Really smooth and silky. Cut on the bias so plenty of give. Just right in hip area where God blessed me generously. I ordered 4 more colors for the summer.<br />I was satisfied for the price and delivery time. Will have to see how they launder but will wash on gentle with other nice lingerie.
4.0,Very pretty runs a size small
4.0,Great for what I needed it for.
4.0,"Could have been slightly larger, kinda small when wrapped around my head."
4.0,"Overall, these were great. My 5 year old daughter wore itin Disneyland on Christmas and that helped me always keep an eye on her in the crowds. She liked the pink hat and the bow is a cute touch. My only real complaints are that the one we got was not completely sewn on one ear and this is not a child size. It is a &#34;One Size&#34; hat that is really designed for larger heads (maybe not adults, though). Still, we made it work and she had fun. We originally received the wrong item from the seller, we we did not have time to wait for a replacement with a better sewn ear. I just took care of it with a safety pin since it was inside the hat on a seam.<br /><br />Overall, a nice hat and definitely a better price than in the park."
4.0,Bought for the wife for our cruise. Will look good on the beaches of France and Greece. Ordered a size larger.
4.0,Los materiales son de buena calidad comparación de precio
4.0,These will be great for when the weather gets a bit warmer.  I bought then for a trip to Thailand this summer which I think they will be perfect for.  They are not as baggy as I expected though.  I normally wear a 14-16 and got the XL.  I might have preferred the XXL if I had know but they do fit so I will keep them. Note a few people complained about the straps but they are adjustable. There is a button with three button holes to customize the fit up top.I have large boobs so the second hole worked fine for me but I can see if one was flat chested it still might be too big even on the last button hole.
4.0,It was cute! Fits alright
4.0,The product material feels nice.
4.0,I love the material and length of the pants. However the pocket openings need to be deeper so it lays flat.
4.0,"I am very pleased with the quality, design and color and price of this item.I have not had a chance to use it yet. I might wish for a few small pockets to be added"
4.0,Better than expected<br />Received a lot of compliments and the<br />material is very soft<br />Ordered another one in a different color
4.0,These are nice as an additional burp cloth or clean up rag.  They are relatively small like a small dish towel.  But overall cute and nice extras to have around.
4.0,"The fabric wasn't what I expected, but it's kind of stretchy so the fit is perfect. It's a little low cut and a little see through in certain areas, I had to find a bralet to wear under it to hide some of those spots. Overall, love it!"
4.0,"I like these footless tights. They are very smooth feeling, but bear in mind they are heavy - not actual pantyhose. They will be very hot in the summer. As far as control, they are moderate. They provide a decent amount of control across the midsection, but minimal control of the thigh area, which I was disappointed about. I like some inner thigh control as well, which I find is better in other brands."
4.0,Nice house dress. A little tight in the hips for me but love the look and that it snaps up front.
4.0,I would go a size or two up they came slim small and shrink in the dryer. Other than that my 8 yr old said the were comfy soft and thick but not too thick
4.0,I still like it. However it isn’t exactly what I thought it would be.
4.0,Great work for the price. A graduation gift.
4.0,La tela es suave y es ideal para un ambiente fresco.
4.0,"These socks appear to be the usual Gold Toe quality stuff, but these are thinner than crew sock material, and while I have not worn them for a whole season yet, I don't expect a lot of miles out of these babies.  If they were a half inch higher on the ankle I'd still give them 5 stars.  Finding socks that are just right is like an episode of Goldilocks anyway."
4.0,Dress ran a little small but otherwise I loved it!
4.0,"I have already discussed this with the manufacturer and they were extremely nice and gave me a full refund. Apparently, their conception of size &#34;Large - 12 to 14&#34; is a bit off. Even with the elasticized waistband I could not pull the skirt up higher than about halfway up my thighs. I thought the size had been mismarked but, alas, it had not. I love the skirt; I think the design is beautiful and the fabric and workmanship seem first rate. That's why I gave it 4 stars even though I can't wear it. I made the manufacturer promise to let me know when they start making larger sizes."
4.0,Like me all. Like the color choices.
4.0,Loved the dress! I’m 5’1” so had it hemmed. One button was off when I received it. Sewed it back. Wore it to a Keith Urban concert and had a lot of compliments !
4.0,"Came on time, no damage.  Fairly comfortable but the kids have not lost them in the water yet, so I can not say how well they will float / save the glasses."
4.0,I love this dress and have received compliments on it. I do suggest air drying since it did shrink so now its a bit shorter then i would like. Will order another and not put it in the dryer.
4.0,"Love how much this carries! I only took a star off because I felt the two side zipper parts needed a bit more stability when opened. Even still, this is a really good travel pouch. I honestly haven't even unpacked it because I like how organized my everyday vanity stuff is! Zip it up and done!"
4.0,Super comfy! I think this is my new favorite go-to outfit!
4.0,"This is a really cute outfit! The size 4-5 fit well on my almost 5 year old of average height.<br /><br />The color of the dress in the pictures I’m attaching are true-to-life.<br /><br />Reasonable quality. The shirt is very soft. I think it shrunk a bit in the wash, but is still fine. The ties in the back were different lengths by 3” so QC could be improved. I purchased the outfit for picture day so it didn’t really matter since you couldn’t see the back.<br /><br />Suspenders did not stay on, so I had to safety pin them onto the shirt. Not ideal but it was an easy fix and it worked.<br /><br />A huge improvement would be built-in bloomers to the skirt, since it is a shorter skirt.<br /><br />Overall, a cute outfit that my daughter loved."
4.0,I ordered these for my Son in law for Christmas. He is a Professor and has to wear a tie every day. He loved them.
4.0,This is a beautiful robe.  I wish it was longer and touched the floor.  I'm 6'3 and it's About a foot too short.  I will add lace to the bottom probably.  So the model must be very short for it to be dragging on the floor in the photo.
4.0,"Love this sweater, although I bought an Xl it fits more like a M /L. It runs small but still fits. Super soft and cozy. I love it."
4.0,"Loose fitting, silky rayon material (thin)"
4.0,"First, the picture of this doesn't look like the actual bra. If you look at the other pictures in the description, it shows the real one. It's all one color of brown. The picture shown makes it look like it has two distinctly different colors. I would say it's true to size. While it is a full coverage bra, it's very thin so I can't wear it under just anything. The lace will show through lighter, form fitting fabrics. When wearing form fitting shirts, I really have to wear t-shirt bras or molded cups  for nipple coverage as well. It's a comfortable enough bra to wear all day long. It's cute, too!"
4.0,"Most sunglasses fit just a bit too tight on me, especially the more rigid ones. These Duduma don't have that problem. I use these in the convertible when to top is down and they do a nice job. The lenses are a little thin but they seem pretty scratch resistant. Its a good product at normal price; its a great product if you catch a Deal of the Day / Lightening price."
4.0,"Similar to a prior band I purchased, however this reeked of chemicals when I received it. I bought rose gold, so this may specifically be due to that color."
4.0,It is fair but not what I expected!
4.0,The purse was wider than I anticipated and it's stiff enough that it holds its shape. It's cute but bigger than I expected after measuring my old purse ' s dementions in comparison.
4.0,"I'm 5'5&#34;, 130-135 lbs, average build. I ordered the size 2-4 (label says 30, which I assume is 30&#34; waist) and it seemed larger than expected. I usually wear a size 6 or 4 maybe, and this is larger than expected. Now, it could be because it's mislabeled. If the 30 does represent waist size then that makes sense why it would be a little big (I'm usually a size 29). But still, I like the pants. The color is a little browner than it appears in the picture, but I'm ok with that. And the length is great. Butt looks nice. I just can't decide if I should keep them or maybe try for the size 0-2."
4.0,I am 5'2 140 lbs. and this onesie fits me great. The material is ok it's not the best but I like it and it's comfortable!
4.0,I like it so far.  It is nice to wear after a shower because it will dry you off really quickly.
4.0,"I really like this band, it is comfortable and easily cleaned. Only negative is the fact that it can easily be opened while putting on or taking off clothes."
4.0,This is a like too short for my taste and I'm only 5' 5. It looks shorter on me than in the picture. I don't care for that.<br /><br />It's warm enough for fall and suitable in most situations as an office sweater. I wouldn't use it as a blazer. It doesn't have a button.
4.0,Love it and fit nice
4.0,"Was looking for a mother of the groom dress.  The dress fit well, a little big.  I am a size 12 and picked up a 14. Reviews said it ran small.  Felt it was to Matronly, so order several other dresses.  I'm also 5'5, it would need to be hemmed about 2-3"" depending on shoes."
4.0,The tread this is stiched with irritates my skin. I am going to wash them and see if that helps.
4.0,"The heart itself is BLACK, with pewter-tone flower embellishments, which is difficult to see in the photo. The pendant itself is pretty large though. It is a great gift for a child or teen or as costume jewelry. It does come on a dog-tag chain that is fairly long enough for any wearer."
4.0,"Very nice and elegant keychain. Adds sophistication and elegance to your set. It's sleek and admirable. I have already had about three people ask me about it. It doesn't hurt that this color goes perfectly with our office décor. It's durable, sturdy and all my keys fit and go on with no problem. The leather is smooth and is well made. There's a slight shimmer to it but it isn't sparkly. It doesn't look childish, but very modern I love it. I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review."
4.0,"Beautiful cross, I would have given 5 stars had it not been for the short chain. I  changed the original chain and it was a little difficult because the chain loop was larger than the loop holding the cross. I will be using it for my consecration service. Perfect size I just wish it was a little heavier. But all in all it’s a nice inexpensive item with lasting value."
4.0,"It looks as in the picture , the only thing I wish the bottom was a little bit smaller but over all it’s very beautiful ( I am thin)"
4.0,"This scarf may be a little bit too short in length, but I love it none the less. Because cats!"
4.0,"this is a super cute ring. i didn't think it fit at first, but it's adjustable. i wear a size 6 ring and i don't think this can be made to fit much smaller than a 6. the only drawback is i've been wearing it for almost a month and the gold plating has mostly worn off the band in back (by my palm), but it's not really noticeable. my skin is especially reactive with inexpensive jewelry so i'm not surprised. i still like it, especially for the price."
4.0,"Excellent fit, comfortable and warm. Tested by wearing while hands in front of 60 degree A.C. for 4 min. Stayed warm. Inside as temperature dropped on outside. I LOVE EM🎅"
4.0,"I love this shower curtain, Looks just like the picture. I gave it 4 stars because it took foreverrrr to come( a month) but other than that I love this shower curtain."
4.0,Nice product. A little large and a little too high on the neck for my liking.
4.0,Looks like jewelry.
4.0,Kinda thin but does the job.
4.0,"Print was on good quality paper, a bit blurred but nothing huge. 24x36 included white boarder and it measured over 36 on one side. A few minor issues but it wouldn't stop me from ordering again.  I'm a custom framer so I notice more than the average person."
4.0,"Beautiful outcome, but a lot of patience is required to put it together."
4.0,I wanted some gold on my bracelet because I like gold and silver together.  This charm fits in nicely on my bracelet and this is the third gold one so my bracelet looks gold and silver now.
4.0,It was a gift for my 11 year old granddaughter and she hasn't turned me into a frog ... yet ... so is that good thing or does it mean the wand doesn't work?  Ha Ha ... she loves it ... that means YES it is beyond satisfactory.
4.0,I sized up to a 2XL.  Im 5'10 220lbs and usually wear a XL.  Glad I sized up because an XL wouldn't have fit well.  I have super long arms and broad shoulders.  Fits well. Contemplating getting it in black.
4.0,I like this watch a lot. He didn't love it because he prefers gold. I think it is great. He loves Tommy Hilfiger and it would go great with those colors
4.0,"The material is polyester, so not as warm as cotton."
4.0,"Item seems well crafted and true to size, Christmas gift for hubby. He likes it a lot"
4.0,Highly recommended the full tank over the tri-top version of this binder as the tank top doesn't roll as the tri-top does.
4.0,My daughter wanted this dress and when it came she wasn't too pleased with the outcome. It has to be put on over the head and getting the waist area past her shoulders was not good.
4.0,"The outfit itself is cute, I love the colors and the fit. The material is a little scratchy but not so much it takes away the cuteness."
4.0,The title says it all.  I really want to like it but it doesn't work for some of my watches due to thickness even after I change to a thiner spring bar.  Otherwise it is high quality and has a silky feel and look to it.  Just make sure it will work for your watch before you order.
4.0,"Really nice dress, I thought it would be a little longer though"
4.0,"I am kind of picky when it comes to socks. They have to be the right thickness and length, none of that no show around the ankle nonsense, I live in the Arizona desert and socks help protect your feet and legs. Its a bonus when they have cool Green Lantern logos on them. The color is amazingly green and the length is perfect to just above the calf and below the knee. They even stay up and in place the entire day. However, I gave them 4 stars because I wanted them to be a little thicker like athletic socks."
4.0,Great hat I used for a costume party.
4.0,Solmate Mismatched socks are always fun to wear -- pick a color.  The are toasty warm and do need some extra space in the shoes -- not your thin-wear socks!
4.0,"I love these face masks but I’m kind of disappointed because my package only came with 4 face masks instead of the 5:( it came with 2 blues, 2 pinks but the one I wanted most wasn’t included which is the mint green one:( not returning items because the face masks work amazing but just bummed out because I only received 4 out of the 5 masks."
4.0,"Awesome band. Bought  a second one because I was so impressed with the first one but cut it too short. Looks great on my Seiko Monster. Took off one star, could be a better clasp."
4.0,"I used this dress for a renaissance fair and really liked it, I was comfortable and perfect for the theme. If you are between sizes I would size up and it’s also short, I am 5.3 and it felt a bit short!"
4.0,"Great lightweight material & pretty print, just needed extra buttons."
4.0,"Great cardigan ! Fabric is very basic, but the style is great. Fits as expected !"
4.0,"Warm and comfy, nice colors - just as expected from listing. Very cute!"
4.0,Great pair of driving gloves. The only issue i had was that size L fit me well at the fingers but very loose around the wrist which left a saggy flap close to the wrist. I know that everyone's hand is different that's why i'm not giving it less than 4 but my hands aren't abnormally small around the wrist.
4.0,"Thin and a bit on the cheap feeling side, but overall nice. I wish the bottom part was hemmed."
4.0,Good quality silk for the price.  Lost one of the cufflinks on the first day I wore them: make sure the clasp end is locked in place -- but that could be my own fault...
4.0,"Hello! This is a question for the seller. Love these glasses, great quality -- until the mirrored coating disappeared? I have no idea what happened, I've been cleaning these glasses with a standard lens cloth and spray and all of a sudden ... problem. The mirrored reflective rainbow element is gone. I'm thinking it's a manufacturing error and I received a bad batch? Any info would be appreciated. I'm also wondering if I could swap my pair for a fresh set. Thank you! -Alexandra"
4.0,"So far so good, I use them in my koi pond, excellent price, perfect fit"
4.0,"I bought these for my mom who visited me in Virginia. Here's the narrative by her.<br /><br />I liked these key rings a lot. I remove one star out of five only because I think they are a bit big for every-day key rings and many people do not want key rings of this size (meaning bigger than expected) in their pockets. All key rings were carefully packaged because each one of them was inside a plastic bag for itself. Nice colors for the different places in Virginia that are depicted on these key rings. Third, you can remember from where they are since they have &#34;Virginia&#34; written on them. It is a nice and affordable present for relatives and friends after a trip to Virginia."
4.0,Amzing goggles.
4.0,"I wish it came in garment bag, folded in plastic was a bitch to iron"
4.0,"Order several sizes larger than you would usually wear if you want an oversized shirt like the title (currently) calls it. If you order your own size or a size larger, you will get a shirt that fits nicely. The arms are actually tighter than I would like in a hoodie, especially one that is supposed to be oversized.<br />The fabric is lightweight/thin, and has a little bit of that microfiber feel—sort of staticky.<br />Overall, If you ignore the word “oversized” in the title description, it’s not a bad shirt."
4.0,"Comfortable and nice looking, could have a few more sequins"
4.0,"The size that I picked was 36small, the suit is fit just fine but the paints was too small. They should let you pick the size separately like 36small for suit, and waist to the paints is 32 instead of 30 which is coming with the order"
4.0,The tank top is well made but huge on me! I am a size 2 and this fit me like a large or extra large would. It is so large in the chest area it gaps on the sides by my underarms. I had to tie it in a knot to make it look cute.
4.0,Great way to organize toiletries. Cuts well in my small case. Hanger is convenient to access contents
4.0,"Not form fitting, and the fabric isn’t the best, but you get what you pay for.  Cute pattern. Lightweight."
4.0,"Just got this - it fits me perfectly.  I'm 6' even, about 210-215lbs - muscular, with a 47&#34; chest, around 14% bodyfat, relatively lean.<br /><br />Fabric is thin, it definitely clings to the body,  Weird industrial smell from the shirt - it's off to the laundry immediately.<br /><br />Humorously it's marked XXXL - those guys in China must be small.<br /><br />Overall, seems a tad overpriced for the quality.  Will report back if the washing machine destroys it."
4.0,Purchased for formal evening event. Liked the color and design.  Necklace is hinged and can get tangled but not a big issue.  Nicely packed and quick delivery.
4.0,"I am a size 8-10 and I ordered an extra large and it fit great.  I was a little put off by the slight shine in the fabric, but I thought it was cute and comfortable when I put it on.<br /><br />I took off a star for it running small and the shine, but I am still happy with my purchase."
4.0,Color is little bit lite
4.0,I like the key chain design.<br />This was the product I wanted.<br />The key ring is very durable.
4.0,Fits great! Sizing chart is bang on! Great quality as well!
4.0,"Battery life could be better, but my daughter loves these shoes!"
4.0,I am 5'4 and this dress is calve length on me. Otherwise it fit great and is great quality! I just wanted something knee length or right above the knee.
4.0,"I love them, but the word is imprint.  It could be nicer if it is embroidered."
4.0,It's cute once I figured out how to wrap it like the picture. They should include instructions. The material is thick and color is exactly like picture
4.0,This was cute on my ear gave the cutest splash of flare very detailed the design and color were amazing I tried to pry it open for a better angle on my.ear and snapped it apart I would have orded another but shipping takes.weeks
4.0,"We love it! Fits great, nice and stretches. A fun little black dress to wear out with close friends. Looks great with heels!"
4.0,"This is a very comfy sports bra, and it's attractive as well. As a busty runner I tend to prefer compression in my sports bras, and this offers a bit of that. However, it is not what I would consider a high impact/bounce control bra. I still wear another bra underneath this one. So this is great for low impact athletic activity and everyday wear, but less helpful in the bounce department."
4.0,I love butterflies and so does my daughter in law. I gave her this for her birthday and she LOVED it!
4.0,I wish it was a 44mm watch prefer a bigger watch but it will work at 42 mm
4.0,"Very cute, and quite small. I got these to wear one in my left ear and it looks great."
4.0,I love the design and the purple color. I’m glad I ordered a size larger than usual. I like a looser fit and I probably could have gone up two sizes.
4.0,The color is too dark like a bloody red!!!
4.0,"NIce dress, ordered one size up.  there is no lining. seams are ok. I received the dress with a pleats unraveling at the waist and returned with no problem."
4.0,"These are super cute, but there's a weird lining in them, so I cut it out. It felt like a diaper. Also, I haven't soaked the pants in saltwater yet since I just got them but hoping they don't fade. Other than that, I love them!"
4.0,"I love the shade of brown but was hoping for more of a cross-body bag. It looks funny wearing it as cross body with the handles the way they are. However, I just wear it on my shoulders and it is totally functional. It's big enough to hold my things but not a black hole where I have too much in there to find anything! I do love it!"
4.0,"The bags came as described, with my only two gripes being that the drawstrings are somewhat cheap and can easily unravel (nothing a lighter cant fix when you get them) and the inside of the bags are mad of some plastic synthetic rather than velvet (I don't think the bags are even velvet, but rather a material sprayed with velveteen, but I may be wrong). Even with these two minor annoyances the bags are great for storing little gifts or jewelry, or even organic materials being that the interior is a plastic.  Great for gift bags or storing your own personal belongings!"
4.0,These charms are really cool. My daughters are using them to make bracelets and necklaces. They are easy to use. So far so good. No complaints.
4.0,Very pretty set. Nice and sparkly and perfect for the occasion I wanted them for. The earrings are super hard to put on though. It took me about 5 minutes to put each one in. It would be better if they were hooks or studs. Otherwise a good product.
4.0,"I'm fairly pleased with my scarf.  Although it did give the dimensions, I guess I overestimated the length and therefore the fit.  My only real complaint is that it is extremely thin, which is ok for summer, but vastly shortens its lifespan and durability."
4.0,Cute wallet. Plenty of space. Card slots are a little small.<br />I like it so far.
4.0,"Looks just like the photo, but i wish there were more slots for cards and i wish it was easier to take them outta of the wallet, other than that its cool"
4.0,"Runs a bit small, especially after drying. Comfortable though and do the job if an underlayer for skiing."
4.0,Thin fabric. Didn't expect to have to wear an undershirt to hide my bra.
4.0,I purchased this to wear under a dress to attend my Christmas party. It was a last minute decision and I needed something fast. Being 320 pounds it’s not easy to find dresses that fit but I found one that was sleeveless so I knew I wanted a little coverage and to add a bit more pizzazz. I don’t know that I would’ve liked the dress half as much without the lace sleeves. I had multiple complements on my ensemble and the lace was super soft against my very sensitive skin. It really did pull the outfit together. The only issue I had was a small tear in one of the seams on the sleeve but it can easily be mended.
4.0,These are ok. The pocket feels a little tight in back of your naughty bits but it may loosen up. They sure solve the problem of everything sticking to my leg.
4.0,"This is an excellent belt at a very good price, similar to the ones I have purchased in the past at Costco stores.  However, it is advertised on Amazon with the waist size, not the belt size the way I am used to shopping for belts.  I ordered it the first time expecting to recieve the belt size or the actual length of the belt but it was actually 2"" longer.  I had to return it and order the next size down to get what I wanted.  It was packaged well and arrived as promised."
4.0,Very cute. Pretty much what I expected.
4.0,Perfect little stocking stuffers
4.0,it would have been better if it was a little more thicker.
4.0,Liked the design! Very cute!
4.0,"This dress runs a little large, but is incredibly soft. I’ve been wearing it over my swimsuit as a coverup, but it would also make a nice sun dress. The colors are vibrant and have faded very little despite being constantly exposed to the sun."
4.0,True to size cute and flowy fabic...invest in a slip though
4.0,Good for the money. The end of the shorts kind of rolls up a bit and does not lap to the body as it should. Other than that it's not bad.
4.0,"This dress would have been perfect if it had been lined. Due to the sheerness of chiffon, the side panels are sheer in bright light. They start at hip height, so you'll show all your goods if you don't wear a slip. Other than that, the fabric is lightweight and has no stretch. The sizing runs small. I'd say that this is closer to a US size 12. I usually wear a 10, sometimes a 12 if I need extra room on top. This dress was big in the waist, but fit everywhere else. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,"This sports bra is for high intensity workouts like high impact off trail jogs, jump rope, jumping in general. Its a little stiff and maybe a little uncomfortable if your arent doing intense excercises. Definitly keeps the girls on lock down!"
4.0,Very cute shirt but it runs VERY small. The reviews helped so I ordered a large (I wear a size 4). Great quality for the price.
4.0,"Well, the shorts are okay, nothing special. After a short 10 mile ride, all lower things were comfy enough, no sore parts. The leg area creeps up, so stops to allow for adjustments are necessary. Next time. I'll look elsewhere."
4.0,I reviewed this earlier and questioned whether the band would scratch because it was so annoyingly sealed on arrival. I have worn it regularly for about 3 weeks and see no scratches.
4.0,I love it. Wish it was just a tad bigger. It is still really nice and warm. You can wear it with the fur on the inside too. Less hair static :)<br />The pompom is removable so you can put it on either side. Great price!
4.0,Nice size for a packable. Lost a star for goofy instructions on  how to put it back into the bag (hint: just ignore them)
4.0,Fit is way smaller than normal.
4.0,It’s cute and I like that the pom snaps off and on. My only complaint is the lines it leaves on my forehead! lol.
4.0,these are great random ear rings
4.0,"I would say that this item is a good value for the price. Gives me just enough cover with sleeveless dresses and keeps my arms warm. Fits well and overall seems to be of decent quality.  I am planning to buy 2 more of these. I will go up one size though.  I have small shoulders and a large bust, and I bought this in Medium. I want to try this in a Large for perhaps a little more cover."
4.0,"Nice shirt, but not sure how long the writing will stay on. Ordered an xl and I’m glad I did."
4.0,"Lots of choices, material is good but like another reviewer said, it did not come with labels. If you’ve stretched before you might remember the gauges and figure it out. But definitely recommend labeling the sizes."
4.0,"I went with a large when I am typically a medium.  It is trim fit cardigan that wasn't too tight or too baggy.  I really liked it.  It has 2 stripes on 1 sleeve that are not shown by the photos.  That was a pleasant surprise for me, but it introduced a new tan color, so it probably would not benefit most people, which is the reason I'm knocking it down by 1 star."
4.0,Just love the watch.  A great fit and nice color.
4.0,"Very baggy, and long in the back."
4.0,"One of the earrings arrived broken, it wouldn't fit in the clasp. They're cute but not satisfied"
4.0,Is too tight
4.0,"Nice, but smaller than expected! The picture can be deceiving. Arrived safely."
4.0,"i am not the one to complain bout small differences on size dimensions, or color, etc etc<br />but this is the exception<br />this bag i not a midnight blue like it states<br />it is a girly, puke bluish color, that is very unattractive (thus the puke)<br />i will return it<br />ON the UP side :  I have the metrosafe 250 gii) which is an amazing bag, but it is not designed to fit a laptop (not a shortcoming, just it is the small size bag) and i wanted something that would fit by needs and contentets<br />so... get the black or roll the dice and get the grey one"
4.0,"Decent for the price. The screw threads ARE short and do come lose throughout the day. I just check them intermittently to make sure they are tight. However, I can’t complain...I fully expected this because I read other reviews and other reviews said the screws threads were short."
4.0,Loved the fit. Nice sturdy material and well made.
4.0,I really like this dress and its comfortable. I did get it a size up so it could have the &#34;baggy&#34; look to it. I also had to wear dark spanks under the yellow because you can see through even though the material is thick. I'm 5'2 and had to get it hemed.
4.0,"Can easily walk around in these, great casual sandal for everyday or a vacation in the sun"
4.0,These are nice boots. I love the way I can wear them up or down. Fit as expected and comfortable.
4.0,A little thing & the leg stitching wasn't stretchy.
4.0,Color matches well and easy to use. When you see through the lights you will see it a little bit looks like stains of dried ink. So check it out before place an order. Other than that very good quality and fast dry. Good for any leather goods. i use this to my shoulder bag. Looks great.
4.0,Very colorful - arrived on time great value!
4.0,"Given the price over $20, one could expect that the fabric was not only 95% polyester. Yet so far this is the only drawback of this dress. It fits great according to the size (mine is medium) and even hides well that extra  pound, which I added to my  waist during the winter season. The belt imitation does really good job in this respect. The design of the dress gives you confidence of the business casual look. I love the versatility of this piece: once paired with stilettos and some delicate silver jewelry, you get cool evening outfit. Yet it also goes well with flats and even sneakers if you like sporty but elegant style. Its military green  can be matched with a lot if not  any color. I added a navy blue cardigan one day, and the next these were burgundy shoes and  scarf - both variations looked fabulous.  So far, I am happy with this dress."
4.0,great sweater very warm looks very nice only down fall of the sweater is the zipper is on the wrong side for men and it makes it hard to zip
4.0,Size runs small. Tight fitting.
4.0,Tootsie Toasters ! Nice .
4.0,"Based on reviews, ordered a medium when I'm normally a womans small. Fits perfect, I'm 5'2"" 125 lbs. Very cute, stylish and comfy. Not super warm. Material is a little rough on my neck but no biggie. Double fold the collar to get more waves in front."
4.0,liked it but not the color...looked more green than in the picture
4.0,I've been searching for these exact earrings for a long time and they are just beautiful! I'm a bit disappointed in the &#34;locking&#34; mechanism as it is not as secure as I would want.
4.0,"Material is very light/thin which is perfect for California summers. I got the small size. Sleeves are fitted but the bodice of the shirt is pretty long, not form fitting. I don't think I'll be able to use the straps to button up the sleeves since it's a bit tight fitting on the arm when I do that. Depending on the light, I see one of the stripes as yellow or greenish-yellow. I think it's fine."
4.0,"I am 5""1 i usually wear a size 16. I order An XL in this based off my measurements its a little small in the arms and bust and doesn't have stretch due to the fabric. It is definitely true to the picture, light weight and the colors are pretty and vibrant perfect for spring and summer."
4.0,"bought the bag for my boyfriend and there are SO many pockets and hidden areas, it fits his giant laptop and it's comfortable to carry!! he loves it and i wish they made them for women!!!"
4.0,It didn’t glow in dark like I thought but my daughter loved it anyway
4.0,Really good quality. I will buy this item again
4.0,"Pretty shirt. Bought a medium should have gotten a small, it's a stretchy shirt."
4.0,"The earrings are beautiful and feel substantial, but they were sent in a ring box with no backs at all."
4.0,Great sweater.  It was as I expected. Good quality material with tight stitching.
4.0,this was about my sixth pair of Brooks shoes. Although I did the fit test on the brooks web sight before buying this pair and brooks recommended this pair they were too narrow for my flat feet and hardly any lace left to tie them once I put them on. return was a breeze and I went back to my no fail ghosts.
4.0,My son got it for his karate class.  He liked it.
4.0,"I like this earrings ,they beautifull was a really good deal to buy."
4.0,"I am actually impressed with the quality in the material and how comfortable it is. Only problem was, it was very easy to hook into the 1row... MY FAULT. I bought a size too big because I thought I read in a review that it did run on the bigger side. Overall very nice."
4.0,I love it! I do wish that it was a real peplum that went in the back too. I thought it did when I ordered it. I guess I didn’t look at the picture of the back of the dress.
4.0,"Blue stone is larger than most would think.  I feel it's a good choice, as the price would be much higher in a department store.  Nice design.  Bought it for future sister-in-law for our wedding."
4.0,They are a little small but super cute
4.0,"I've bought this on two separate occasions as gifts.  Not the highest quality, but super cute on a baby that will outgrow them soon anyway."
4.0,"Ran slightly small, but it is ADORABLE and my daughter has gotten compliments every time she's worn it. The pattern is so cute and the dress doesn't make her look frumpy, but very stylish. The only complaint is that it was a bit snug, so be aware that it runs slightly small. Other than that, we love it!"
4.0,"I love ❤️ the rumper, but too short she is 5 and it's too short a little disappointed 😔"
4.0,"I got this for $16 and at that price it's top quality although it has a terrible looking patch. It's the right size, comfortable, and isn't falling apart which is more than I expected for so cheap."
4.0,Pictures came out a little dark. But besides that it was a great gift.
4.0,Fit as expected and shipping time as expected
4.0,Light weight fits nicely
4.0,Bought as a gift for my friends daycare. This gets used everyday and the kiddos LOVE it. My friend loves it cause it is one of the few dress up costumes that the kids can put on all by themselves! It was such a hit she ordered a few more herself!
4.0,"The set is very pretty. Unfortunately the one I received was almost uniform in color. The one on the picture appears to have grey and variations of peach and white... mine is very &#34;pastel&#34;, very muted color."
4.0,Omg this dress fit perfectly. I am literally amazed that it came from Amazon. I want one in every color now. For reference I ordered an XL and I am 5’1” and a size 18. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because the neckline is a little loose but other than that it is perfect.
4.0,"I had a hard time trying to figure out how to open these.  Once I did (super easy; I was just an idiot), I've worn them every single day.  They are not as sparkly as the picture but still beautiful."
4.0,FUNNY COSTUME
4.0,Very thin but cute! Fit as expected.
4.0,"Overall, I really like it. Perfect design for my profession and glad that I can actually wear my ring. My only complaint is that it doesn't lay down flat and sticks out."
4.0,"It was a good looking product. What was described was what it looked like, the only thing is when I opened the box it looked like it was already looked at because it wasn't in the plastic rap it should be in."
4.0,"The shoes are confortable, but my feet get sweaty."
4.0,"I do like this ""eyeglass holder""... Mostly cause it looks like a necklace. So when you have glasses on face... You still just have a necklace on. However, the ring does not look like the picture... Mine is a shiney, silvery black."
4.0,Nice vest but an adult medium is really quite small. If over 5'5 and 114 pounds I would suggest a purchasing an adult large.
4.0,"I haven’t had this stone for too long, and when I first received it I already felt it’s magical energy to help me heal during my tough time. I never kept it near water and only put it back in my jewelry box when I didn’t wear it. I saw it today and I noticed there are chipped decaying spots. It’s as if it’s rotting or something. It doesn’t smell but I’ve never seen anything like it. I read about how crystals tend to dissapear or destroy when the owner doesn’t need ‘it’s’ help anymore. I feel like I am more healed then when I first received and I’m not saying it’s rotting back of that, but it is strange that it is. I haven’t dropped it either to explain the chips. But just to let you all know"
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and just the right length for me. The top.material is soft, the bottom is ok but I like cotton better than polyester."
4.0,Wrinkles very easily. Color and fit are good.
4.0,Cute shirt. Cute color. A tad smaller than I would have liked and the material is super thin. I’m scared to swear it because there’s a good chance the vinyl will split around my chest.
4.0,"I bought many of these thermals directly from Alternative Apparel. They're soft, figure hugging (in this case, their size chart is pretty accurate), and warm. I bought them to wear under my scrubs at work, but I also just like wearing them around the house and sleeping in them. There were only two issue that I ran into that were not so egregious that these would be deemed a bad product. I have two blue and four black thermals and of my two blue, one of them has noticeably looser arms than the other one. One of my black thermals had a loose string. If you ever notice this - resist any urge to pull it because when I did - the uniform waffle pattern on the thermal was broken by a very prominent dark line (3-4 inches). It's still comfortable and wearable, I just don't wear it by itself. That aside, these are great and I wish I found them before all the other colors sold out."
4.0,A bit on the short side but these will work
4.0,"I decided to get this wallet because of the design and size.  I wanted a small wallet with only one section for bills and slots for only a small number of cards.  I also always prefer this type of orientation in the card slots because I feel it's more secure.  The wallet seems well made.  The leather is good but it's not my preferred type.  I wish they made this design with the leather they use for their brown Monza (# MZ4) wallet.  I did not get that one because it seemed too thick.  I also liked their ICENZA VCN-17 (nicer leather) but did not get it because it seemed too small to fit several bills comfortably.  So, the AP61 was a compromise...I like it but I'm not really excited about it."
4.0,I wish this was just a little bigger because it’s so so cute!  I’ll still wear it with heavy black tights or leggings. Definitely order a size up on this one
4.0,Very nice belts. I especially like the leather around the buckle.
4.0,"Nice  watch, a little  hard to see unless you have  20/20 vision. Keeps good  time. Worth  the price."
4.0,love the color and they go with anything
4.0,"I love the pocket, a little low wasted if you have any tummy but I bought 2 pairs!"
4.0,A little tight for me.  I ordered a large.
4.0,"Would have liked more support but for the price, they are fine."
4.0,"bit smaller than expected, but quality"
4.0,Order received very fast! My daughter will love it!!
4.0,I bought several pair in different colors and this is the first pair of suspenders I tried on. They seem to hold well so far no problems with the clasp holding and they do look nice.
4.0,These are my favorite PJ bottoms. They fit comfortably and although a little long I have to remember that I'm a gal and they're going to come that way. They fit exactly as expected and I'm very happy with them. It be nice if they were a little softer but that's why I took off one star. Thank you Amazon.com
4.0,"I was worried about ordering a medium - 5'7/145 fit/curvy - as I have broad shoulders. Sometimes a medium is too tight and a large too big. However, this and the black one fit very well. It's a poly blend - but it's still softish and a nice weight. I'm pleased with the purchase."
4.0,exact fix
4.0,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
4.0,"I like the belt but you have to be careful when cutting it to size.  If you get it too short, the ratchet lock will no longer work.  I ordered 2 belts and ruined one when I cut it too short."
4.0,warm but too small.  definitely not one size fits all
4.0,I usually wear med. Needed to size up to L.
4.0,I ordered a large because I read that it runs small...I normally wear a medium and it fits great. I'm 5'8&#34; and the length is fine
4.0,I ORDERED A MEDIUM AND NEVER KNOW WHAT EXPECT BUT IT IS PERFECT.  IT IS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BUT I THINK THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE STYLE.
4.0,"Usually 18-24 month is the equivalent to size 18M, but the label on this Onsie says 24 month. I thought I was ordering the 18M so this ended up being too big of course. It is cute, but it was for my baby’s first birthday party, and even the 18M would have been a little bit big. Wish they had more size choices and were more clear on what you’re getting."
4.0,Shirt fits great and looks cute but I think they could have chosen a better material. It's a cheap t-shirt material and it's not as soft as I expected. Plus it picks up every piece of lint in the house.
4.0,"Very sparkley.  Only wish the red was a brighter red...looks more like garnets unless you are in direct bright light. The lever back part of earrings, wish they were a little smaller but overall really pretty!"
4.0,"fit perfit and at a good price<br /><br />looks good , good price"
4.0,It's a beautiful ring set but made very poorly. It feels cheap and I wouldn't wear it very long when I do wear it.
4.0,The color is beautiful but the fit is a little larger than expected. Hope to see it in more colors
4.0,"Please don't pay attention to the other reviews...the vest needs a BATTERY pack to work. So yes, it needs to be ""plugged in"" to work.<br />Also, the temperature listed in the instructions is in CELSIUS...most of the world uses Celsius and assuming this is made in China, explains why its in Celsius and not Fahrenheit. 65°C = 149°F"
4.0,"Great product. Loves it a lot. If the pockets are better designed, I will give it a 5."
4.0,A little snug I thought it would be a different fabric but it still looks great. A little on the cheap side but it's not overpriced. Goes well with many outfit ideas. Ordered a size 2.
4.0,Really like this. I've had it for about 6 months and it is starting to look worn. Its super comfortable yet looks nice. I wear a belt with it. I'm petite and it fits pretty well - its jersey so that's helpful.
4.0,Just a little see through
4.0,Did make my stomach look flat!
4.0,"These are very cute and I wear them constantly. The material of the chokers depicted on the bottom of the photo are almost like a polyester/hard material, and can hang a bit heavy. Otherwise, they are very cute chokers and go with many outfits."
4.0,It's just what I was looking for
4.0,"I live in the South so when I was looking for an infinity scarf, I was looking at something that is really lightweight and something that I can wear all year around. This is exactly what I was looking for. The price is a great deal and they have many different colors. The only thing that I really don't like is the fabric. I bought a white one first so I could wear it with everything and it seems like it is a magnet for lint and dog hair and it does pill. It's fine if you just don't wash it every day. Overall though, I look forward to buying the black and blue ones for work!"
4.0,"Overall for the price it's a cute dress. Fabric is a little thin but so far it seems to b holding up. I bought 8 different colors/styles. I just gentle wash & hang dry. They do run small but I like my dresses to hug my body anyways. I unexpectedly attended a motocross race after church & had no time to change outfits. It ended up raining all day & wearing that dress with my stiletto boots wasn't the best idea. By the time the race was over I was a muddy mess! Lol. Miraculously, the dress came clean so I guess the fabric is more durable than it feels."
4.0,Quite comfortable. Wish the price was lower.
4.0,I would say this hoodie runs a bit small. Other than that it's great. Very soft material and a good length. I like that it has pockets. The design is just as bold and exquisite as shown in the photos.
4.0,It’s not chiffon but material it’s soft and the print it’s really cute. Overall it’s ok for the price.
4.0,"Cute pattern, but the fabric is very thin and plastic-y. Difficult to wear without a slip or something underneath. Incredibly small sizing."
4.0,"The hat is just a little bit too large,but it is a really nice hat. Really cools you off when you soak it. It holds it's shape really we'll."
4.0,"It is a very cute top and the cut and pattern hide the belly.  However, in movement, the bottom of this top rides up and reveals said belly so be ware.  I am going to talk to a seamstress about finding a way to connect the top to the bottoms like hooks or something to make it convertible into a one piece for swimming."
4.0,"Its a lot bigger than I thought it would be, it is soft though."
4.0,"Kinda flimsy, but the price was right. Only going to wear it two or three times for fun."
4.0,"This is a very pretty dress and seems to fit well; I can't post pictures because I haven't worn it for my event yet.  I didn't realize the jewelry and headband were included so that was a bonus.  I am large on top and the XL fits well but be careful of the zipper, it's not very high quality. The spandex is in the dress material but the built in sash doesn't stretch. The ribbon trim in the back of the dress does not quite match up but the cape will cover that.  The dress is not as long as it looks in the picture and I am only 5' 5&#34; tall. I really like the cape but it does shed a bit and looks authentic. It's very much like the picture and overall I am pleased with the purchase."
4.0,It's little big but I like it. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice belt clip. Worth the money
4.0,"I had high hopes, and this product really is good. Unless you got thick thighs and a butt. I usually fit into a 1X and a size 15 or 16 in pants. I ordered a 2X to be comfy and I had to fight to get them on. Once I was out of breath, they looked great - they aren't see through, even with me testing the limits. But I would have gone 2 more sizes up (if they even have that) if I'd known.<br /><br />Tl;dr - good product, go a few sizes up if you want comfort."
4.0,Great shirt. Love the wording. However sizing was off.  Smaller than it says
4.0,I love the fur it's great but the quality of the rest of the gloves is kindergarten level
4.0,The Chakra stone is very nice but I didn't like the chain it was dull and not long enough so I'm using a black card in place of the chain and it looks great
4.0,Not board short material it's more like a reg swim bottom. I'll wear them but not what I was wanting.
4.0,Its really pretty! Just too big!
4.0,"Look nice,but It is not water proof."
4.0,This is not nave. It is more a bluish grey. Very cute and stylish. I can't wait to wear it agin.
4.0,Botas ligeras y comodas
4.0,"When I received the product it was in a sealed bag and looked good . However when I went to swap out my wristbands I noticed one of pins was missing the trigger. Lucky for me I had ordered a magnetic band before and remembered that one came with extra pins. So I didn't have to return this one . So that's why the 4 star. Its lightweight , I bought the large, I have fluffy wrist and its not tight. I would recommend this product."
4.0,These are absolutely beautiful I bought them as a gift. They were heavier than I would have liked to get for anyone. I got the white ones!
4.0,"Quality and print were really nice, but the bottoms just fit too low for my liking. I’m usually a 26/27 in jeans so went with a M and my csection scar was almost showing. Wish it would have fit better bc I loved everything else about it."
4.0,"Super cute tank. A tad big, but I still love it."
4.0,"They had a strong plastic scent when I first purchased them, but it wore off after a couple of uses in the shower. I use these for the gym shower. They're a soft, rubbery material but the thong sort of pokes at my toes a bit uncomfortably. Not too much to prevent their use for the 15-30 minutes for a shower, though.  If you're looking to keep your feet off the shower floor, these will do the trick. Recommend drying them off thoroughly before putting them in your gym bag."
4.0,Very cute necklace and it hangs in the right length
4.0,"I just got the tan yesterday.  I was immediately impressed!  It is a nice, thick leather--obviously real leather.  There is a quality feel to it.  The gold trim is very nice, and it seems well-stitched. I really like it--I was skeptical because of the price, but it seems to be a great purchase and I can picture using it year round.  The only cons I would note:<br /><br />1. It is, as someone else mentioned, a little more on the lighter/orange side than the picture suggests.  I would prefer more of a darker tan/light brown like the picture.<br />2.  The reverse/unfinished side of the leather, which you can see in certain places including the other side of the straps and the top of the bag, has a light purple tint to it.  Not sure why it is tinted this way but it looks a little weird with the color of the bag.<br />3.  There is a handy divider pocket in the middle, for an iPad or something similar, but it's not stiff or lined in any way.  Making it stand up would be an improvement.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this bag!"
4.0,Love it but I would advise sizing up. Right fit for a t shirt.
4.0,Fit somewhat large. Some piling after first wash.
4.0,"This mask is very nice for a young child. It is 3-ply and has an interior filter pocket. There is NO nose wire on this; it is form fitting for a secure fit, a tiny bit stretchy, and made of a soft material for comfort. The ear elastics are adjustable but the silicone adjuster on the end will fall off if it's adjusted too far and they are impossible to get back on. Nevertheless, this is a good mask but the current price of $12.99 is pricey for this."
4.0,"the shirt is pretty comfortable and the design has survived the washer and dryer twice now. The only downside is that it is on the larger size, I bought a small and it fits more like a large so expect it to be oversized"
4.0,"She says she likes it, the fit etc 9is as expected"
4.0,"I have 2 dislikes - the stitching leaves something to be desired (there’s a few skipped stitches and loose strings on my left sleeve, but kind of expected for the price...) and when I wear this one, sometimes I’ll notice the (internal) pockets just hanging out.  Despite the downsides, I would still order this in other colors.<br /><br />Otherwise, LOVE the flowy, soft fabric.  Love the slits.  It’s lightweight but VERY cozy.  Depending on the lighting, this color comes across as a very pale blush, a light peach, or a pale nude color.  Regardless, it’s very lovely with the right outfits.  It dresses up and down nicely.<br /><br />True to size - I am typically a US size 12/L, ordered a large and it fits beautifully.  I am 5’6” and it hits mid calf."
4.0,Very pretty however not meant for daily use they tarnish very quickly
4.0,"Very cute bag, the canvas is great and the leather detailing is well done. The bag is smaller than I imagined it would be bigger (should have read the other reviews!). Great for a wallet, phone, and a few other items, but not for an iPad or tablet."
4.0,This was my daughter’s Halloween costume. She also wore it to see Disney on Ice. It’s cute and made well. The only concern I had was she kept tripping on the two ribbons that hang on the ground as they walk. For Halloween I ended up trimming it out of an abundance of caution. I would still recommend this costume. My daughter loved it!
4.0,"These earrings are very pretty and I known my daughter will LOVE them for Christmas.  The picture shows them exactly as they look, but its a little deceiving because these earrings are small. There is absolutely nothing wrong with them. I just assumed they would be a little bigger based on the picture."
4.0,tag is scratchy
4.0,Love the color match my dress just a inches more  and I would have given it a 5 star love it
4.0,Great for the style of scarf it was! Purchased for a bday present!
4.0,Wish they were stretchier and warmer but they’re cute and I’m happy with them.
4.0,Fits nice and looks good. Will have to update after wear and wash.
4.0,"It’s going to be perfect for a spring wedding that I’m attending!  The green looks great with gold wedges and a gold clutch!<br /><br />As others mentioned, the top rousing is a bit odd, but it isn’t terrible. I found that it falls better with an unlined bra. I’ve also. Had it hanging out of the closet for a few weeks and the pleats are starting to fall into place.<br /><br />I’m 5’4” 170lbs and the large fits perfect. VERY flattering!<br /><br />The odd part, but nobody will know, is that the liner was sewed in backwards. The stitching is on the outside and I had to cut out the tags because you saw them through the sheer. Again, not a big deal, only I know. The top layer was perfect!"
4.0,"Comfy, though I prefer the long sleeve style. It's good to wear at home, at least for me."
4.0,"Very nice quality, super cozy, launders well. I first ordered a large (mostly wear medium, but didn't want PJ's too tight). I think their L is more like an XL or XXL. So I ordered a M--it is still large, but much better. A small might be perfect except for the waist, which might be too small. I'm still glad I have both!"
4.0,Our 9 year old was very pleased with this hoodie. Siblings thought it was cool too.
4.0,It’s a little big so I should have got a large
4.0,"I love these for the rugged look and still being comfortable with a 2.5"" heel/sole to walk on.  There is no ""fur"" lining..Don't know where that statement came from on the boot description!.  The insole is comfortable, cotton material.  The grommets are sturdy & very securely attached to boot, w/ nice long laces.  The sole is definitely the identifying part..Thick rubber (?), part opaque, fairly good treads.  Like the Skechers brands a few years ago, took time for me to get used to them adding so much height!  One thing..Size 10 I sometimes have a bit of room to spare at toe area..Not these.  Toes go almost right to tips of shoe fronts so if in doubt I would go up 1/2 size.  The width is fine for me, not narrow or too wide"
4.0,I really like the idea of this being a head wrap OR a neck warmer (not sure I would have thought to do that - but I have worn a different hat and this as a neck wrap SEVERAL times on really cold days).  I was looking for something to wear in the winter when I have my hair in a ponytail but still have my ears covered from the cold wind and this fits the bill perfectly!  The flower on the side sticks out a little more than I would like but I still think it's cute.  I'm not sure I would have bought it if I saw it in the store but I'm still glad I have it.  I've considered taking off the flower and having just the headband part...we'll see.  Would purchase again!
4.0,"A bit too large, but only because I have a small head. I love the hat!!"
4.0,Great casual dress. Only 4 stars since the skirt was an odd length. It hit me at the bottom of my calf.
4.0,"As pictured, fits good, good shipping times"
4.0,I love this scarf and the many ways it can be worn.
4.0,"This is good for ""steak"" burrito meat, sos, stroganoff, stir fry, or similar applications where you want some bits that require a little chewing.<br /><br />I would not use this to attempt a meatless ground or to substitute for ground beef. The pieces are too large for that and though not tough by any means, they are not tender enough for such recipes."
4.0,Its not too short or too long..Proper fit
4.0,"A bit smaller than I was expecting.  I suspect it is due to having two different sections/sides, as this is usually my experience.  I have received many compliments on this bag.  Material is starting to peel around the bottom seams/edge, where it gets the most wear.  For the price, this was a great purchase."
4.0,Material is comfortable.  Leg length longer than expected.
4.0,I don't know what it looks like on me bcuz I have nott worn it yet
4.0,Fits very well. So comfy I fell asleep wearing it.
4.0,Nice everyday bezel set stud earrings with enough sparkle. Very comfortable to wear.
4.0,"I like them, but have to get used to them.  Not flip flop type at all but love Cheeks.  I have boots and they are awesome. Will most likely by another set."
4.0,"I AM 6'1 AND I STEP ON THE BOTTOM MANY TIMES HAD TI HOLD UP ON IT ,I COULD'NT BELIEVE I HAD FOUND A DRESS THIS LONG"
4.0,Happy with shades
4.0,Surprised by a quality.<br />Not bad for the price.<br />Looks good with Khakis.
4.0,"Calidad y precio, fair enough"
4.0,"I got this wallet for my husband, the last RFID wallet he had was metal, with plastic and kind of bulky. No doubt it was great and protective but it was uncomfortable, especially at work. This wallet came in a nice gift style box.  This wallet is a nice stylish slim leather bifold, with multiple card slots and 2 bill slots. It also has a flip up section with a clear area for your ID and more cards, this section isn't removable. It also features RFID protection from people trying to electronically steal your card information through your wallet. I definitely recommend this stylish, protective, functional wallet.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review. I review all products that I order honestly regardless of discount. Everything stated here are my own opinions and my own experiences with using the product."
4.0,I didn’t expect the width of the ring to be so tiny. I didn’t look at the measurements so it isn’t a big deal to me. I was expecting something more like my husbands. That’s why I was excited about the design in it.  It’s not as visible because the ring is so small.
4.0,Very comfortable. Fits great. Thought it might be alittle thicker thou
4.0,"I love the shirt. Love the fit and the length. I’m 5’3 160lb and bought a medium. The lower stars are due to the material being thin, added pics to represent that. You can clearly see my white bra and black leggings through it. Maybe with a darker color it wouldn’t have this problem! I will purchase more in other colors and will update! I like it enough to buy more! Could be dressed up or down!<br /><br />I recommend!"
4.0,Love the dress unfortunately in putting it on the button got caught in my hair and flew off.
4.0,Gorgeous shirt. Love it. Just don't like the fabric too much. But perfect fit.
4.0,"I am very happy with this top. It fits as expected. There just one problem, the sleeves are a bit too slim for my to roll them up as pictured. The color is more of a florescent pink but I love it!"
4.0,"Very appealing bracelet and fun to wear. I like the leather band and the dash of color adds to the appeal. I wonder about the string that adjusts it, but so far no problem. I would buy it again."
4.0,Small in length.
4.0,This is a very fitted top.  It didn't have shoulder pads.  But the shirt is nice otherwise.  Was disappointed that it didn't have the shoulder pads.
4.0,"Shirt fits well, only problem is that it’s really small in the chest area (A cup) but I wore an extreme push-up and it looked a loooot better. Comfy material."
4.0,"Dress is comfortable but hits the ground.  I am 4 feet 11 and chose this so I didn't have to get it hemmed.  With a high enough heel, I should be ok since I plan to wear it on a cruise in November."
4.0,It fit comfortably and I was pleased.  It would of been perfect if it had a hole when I wore a bun.
4.0,"I received this item as a gift for my birthday.  It is lightweight and still relatively warm, ideal for Spring and Fall seasons.<br /><br />Pro:<br />+Very comfortable, soft and flexible<br />+Logo is well done and defined, nicely stitched<br />+The ""simulated"" mesh (as I think they call it) is quite nice... the fleece is mainly inside and around areas of skin contact (like the neck for example), so you don't get chafing<br />+Other look-a-likes have fleece on the outside that have annoying fibers hanging off them as well as which attract dirt<br /><br />Con:<br />-Material is very sleek, however, my cat's toes get caught in it and creates ugly runs.<br /><br />Bottom line: Despite con, a must have for any Red Sox fan - especially if you loved Terry Francona, the man that made this top famous!"
4.0,I wear between a small and a medium - the fit is quite generous.  It's soft and comfy.
4.0,"Nice bag, beautiful color. The liner isn't the best but the rest of the purse is really nice. I like the three different compartments and that the whole purse zips."
4.0,"The necklace was nice, but the clasp does not have enough room to make it a choker like it states. You can, however, make it a choker by hooking it on to the actual necklace chain, but the excess chain will hang awkwardly to the side instead of in the middle. Overall, I would recommend it."
4.0,Put a drop of Dawn dish soap on the clear part and use a paper towel to rub in it real good. This will keep it from fogging up.
4.0,I like them and like to hear people like them too.<br />Good quality and the stones have the different colors.
4.0,"Feels great, could be a bit firmer but it's still a great sock.  Enjoy wearing them."
4.0,"This dress is very pretty and fun! I love that it has pockets, but I don't like that it poofs out where the pockets are instead of laying flat. It's well made, nice material, and light enough to stay cool. I do like the way it looks, although for me it ran a bit big. I would say that it is still fairly true to size though."
4.0,Fits great as far as size I'm 5'7 180lbs but the straps are really short ... I'm going to have a friend make longer ones with material
4.0,"Very nice watch for the price, easy to set and easy to use.  The functions are straight forward and easy to see.  The strap is good quality also.  The only thing that I found is that in some lighting the face doesn't look as blue as the photo, and that was part of the appeal."
4.0,"Great graphic! Small coverage area underneath, but I purchased this for my young daughter so I'm happy. The storage case could use a zipper or be a bit larger. Overall it was good enough that I bought a second one."
4.0,Gift for daughter. She really liked it.
4.0,Nice looking shades. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is it does not block the sunlight the best but it does help!
4.0,It’s very pretty my daughter really liked its go far any age
4.0,"Order came before scheduled time, it is a nice shirt and looks like the picture but the color is off, its almost a creamy coloured blouse, not white,"
4.0,Good product but ran big
4.0,They are for some beading projects I am working on. They will work for what I want to do.
4.0,"I should have gotten a larger size, but I love it.  I have had so many compliments on this dress!  I will be ordering more."
4.0,I love the way these look but they always give me a rash on my ears.
4.0,Very pretty but too large
4.0,My daughter wore this for her 4 year old photo shoot.  I loved the outfit and so do she.  She looked so adorable.
4.0,This charm is a nice addition to my holiday bracelet. It is clear and cute.  The only thing I don't like is that most of my other charms are oriented vertically instead of horizontally.
4.0,Love this scarf. Colors are very authentic to the movie. Soft and comfy. My only complaint is it is super long.
4.0,Nice 3-D lion charms so I was able to make mirror image earrings. Really nice for school mascot jewelry.
4.0,"These are very cute, but way over priced! Being I'm a serious TWD fan and had to have these for my collection, I payed the price!"
4.0,Just pay attention to the size chart read the reviews it's a very nice coat perfect for patches keeps the wind and cold out very well
4.0,Color faded quickly
4.0,Very soft fabric feels nice. No real waistband so it feels a little loose at top. Shipping is from China so it takes a few weeks.
4.0,Muy bonita pero nada que ver con la descripción de venta igual me encanto es muy amplia la pedi L
4.0,It looks cheap in real life.
4.0,This was a bit large. I have to wear two pair of socks with it. I had gotten them to wear with dresses and leggings but that won't work.
4.0,"Super soft and comfortable. Fit as expected. I love this shirt, just wish the pockets were a little more to the front."
4.0,A little tight at first but works exactly as expected!
4.0,"Very pretty dress made of nice material that fits as expected. The underskirt is a little too short for comfort, but I expected that looking at the photos."
4.0,"Warm, simple, and well designed!"
4.0,Fits nice. Only downside is pads don't stick to the fabric. Other than that they're comfi
4.0,"Four stars = &#34;I like it&#34; ... and I do.<br /><br />So, okay, it's costume jewelry and, while it will never grace the neck of Kate Middleton, it's chunky with pearls and beads and glittery thangs and is perfect for a sort of laid-back, downtown Holly Golightly look ... especially if paired with a couple of loops of longer pearls and a short, sleeveless LBD.  Good bang for the buck."
4.0,Nice color collection.Good for my projects.
4.0,it is pretty.
4.0,"I like the band, it fits great. Stays on when I workout."
4.0,"Hey, grandson wanted it, got it, likes it, said thank you."
4.0,It was to long had it cut off fit well
4.0,These shoes fit perfect and looked great with a plain black dress.  They add some color in an unexpected way and I got many compliments on them.  But I gave them 4 stars because I had no idea that they were bedazzled!!  They were gaudy!  Nothing in the description says that!  I was able to scrape off the little jewels easily which tells me they would have fallen off anyway.  Now the shoe is very elegant with just the embroidery.
4.0,"super cute!  very simple and brings a simple outfit together.  i love the bar look these days!  i was a little nervous about it irritating my skin, because i'm pretty sensitive to alot of earrings but surprisingly these earrings doesn't make my ears itch at all.  love them!"
4.0,I gave this hat 4 stars simply because the color was much lighter than it appeared online. Other than that I absolutely love this hat. As an avid animal lover and rescuer this hat was a must. It’s extremely comfortable as well and the price can’t be beat. The shipping took some time but it was worth the wait. Highly recommend
4.0,"Ht: 5'6"".  Weight 153 lbs.  I ordered a 14 but I think a 12 would have been better I  have been losing weight so I wasn't quite sure what size to order.  It's too big around the waist so it slips down.  Maybe washing will help.  If not, it will be good for working in the garden.  I like that it's quite stretchy and the waistband is smooth (no buttons) so no bumps through my shirt.  I might order again but in a smaller size."
4.0,"The quality of the scarf is very good, but smaller than I was expecting."
4.0,"I kept seeing this item elsewhere and when I decided to buy it, it was gone! So... I looked on Amazon and, of course, it was here! Love the colors and size, however, due to the nature of the material it is made from, the &#34;finish&#34; is already cracking. I do not carrry it everyday either."
4.0,Worked great and comfortable.
4.0,I bought these for my sister as I already have a pair. I think they fit well over glasses and work well as sunglasses.
4.0,I got this for an 80's party but I will probably wear it again.
4.0,It’s a simple dress can be easily dressed up or down. Looks just like the picture.
4.0,Nice quality for the price. My mom loved her Christmas gift from her grandkids.
4.0,"My friend loves it, it does fit but it is a bit large but she loves the dress and the color of it."
4.0,"The dress/shirt is VERY warm. The material is fleece like, heavy and soft so it will be perfect for cold weather (see photo). I ordered the 9-12 months based on reviews that it ran big and it really does. My above average height 13 month old could be definitely use this in the next few months without outgrowing it. However the length on her makes this more of a shirt than dress (almost 3ft tall). The sleeves are also very big and could use some stitching in to make them for better. Besides this, very good quality and happy with this purchase."
4.0,"Awesome mask!! Attractive, good construction, really a quality product.  My only issue was that the mask rides on the bridge of the nose, and the inside of the mask is very rough.  I had to add some Kleenex to the inside of the mask so that it didn't hurt."
4.0,Nice shorts. Nothing too fancy about them. They fit my butt just right 😀👍
4.0,I like these compression socks. They do the job.
4.0,not most confortable shoes but look nice
4.0,a little snug at waistband
4.0,"Print super cute. White lace on trim, super not."
4.0,"I have the size XL. They measure 18 inches from the top to the bottom. The inseam measures approximately 9 ½ inches. The waist measures approximately 28 inches before any stretch and it will stretch up to about 36 inches. There are silicone strips inside of each leg. There is heavy padding sewn in which cannot be removed. As you can see from the pictures, there are multiple panels sewn together, and the stitching is quite heavy.<br /><br />Made in China."
4.0,"Very nice, but the wording was a little fuzzy, could have been better."
4.0,This dress well made and fits as expected.
4.0,"Fits as expected, true to size for a medium. Army green is a dark green color, not really olive or anything. Material is self feels fairly substantial and warm and barring a few loose threads, well constructed. Also worth noting there’s no real hood, the neck funnel is more of just that, kind of a scarf."
4.0,"Fabric feels and looks nice. Inside there were some loose threads and some of the elastic is exposed.  I normally wear large, and this extra large is a little tight. Be sure to add a size or two."
4.0,"I like several things about these arm sleeves, first they fit better than previous pairs I have purchased.  These stay put and stay up.  They’re not too tight at the upper arms like a more expensive pair I purchased and have used.  I also really like the thumb hole – first pair I’ve had that had these as well.  The design is a little different around the wrist so the they have a nice fit there. While I wish they didn’t put their logo “Let’s Slim” printed on the outside of the wrists, I can live with that as I bike.  Some reviewers felt that they would (or they did snag) easily – so far I haven’t had that problem. These are as comfortable as any I’ve had and aren’t as tight – which I like.  I’ve taken off a star since I couldn’t read any of the directions on the package (all in Chinese) and the package said they were white – and they are black (which is the color I ordered).  (See picture) The pictures provided to the left of the product description are accurate."
4.0,The back of the legs is to short but the rest fits good
4.0,"The material is a bit thinner than I would have like, seems like it will tear easily.  Otherwise my daughter loves it."
4.0,To walk
4.0,"I received so many compliments when I wore this dress! Having a pear shape, I ordered this to fit my hips, so it is a little big in the chest for me. It is a nice length (sits just above my knees) and looks very cute with a petticoat to fill out the skirt!"
4.0,"These training pants are cute and fit well, but are not much thicker than a pair of regular underwear.  They do not hold up in case of an accident."
4.0,"Nice gaiter.  My only disappointment was the ear holes didn’t match where my ears are on the side of my head and I would say I have a normal size / shape head.  Made my ears pull forward which is uncomfortable.  However, if you don’t utilize the ear holes for their intentions you have a handy dandy vent on the sides which does let a little cool air in during this hot humid weather we have in the South."
4.0,Like the way this shoe fits. Very comfortable. Really cool style as well. Very well made.
4.0,"I chose this shirt based on the length. I was looking for something that would cover my bum when I wear yoga pants or leggings. I really like the top. It's a very lightweight fabric. It is sort of sheet in the solid white part. Not see through, but a it sheer. It a perfect weight for spring or summer. The lace down the back is super cute and gives it a high end look. As if it came from Anthropologie and not Amazon. I did find the fit a tad on the small side. I am a 4/6 and I ordered the medium. It's a good fit for me, where usually I am a small. I decided to air on the side of caution when ordering based on some of the other clothing I have bought form Amazon.<br /><br />The only reason I take one star away is that the stripes don't line up at the seam. They are a bit crooked, and I have OCD about stuff like that. I don't know if someone wold notice it while it was being worn. The seams inside look like they are well sewn. The packaging it arrived in was very nice as well.<br /><br />Disclosure, I received this at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.

4.0,"Runs true to size. Arrived promptly, beautiful shade of emerald green. Nice flowy material."
4.0,"Super comfy but very cute for dressy/casual occasions. I bought it in the wine color and I wear it with black leggings. Great price, too. I love this dress!"
4.0,Good product.  I loved the fit.  But quality was an issue.  One pair of panties started separating at the seam after the first wash.  The other pairs are still holding up.
4.0,"These shirts....I ordered four, total, fit as expected and seem well-made.  I purchased them as underwear, to be worn under a more formal shirt or sport shirt. Some readers will use these as sleeveless tee shirts during warmer weather, as shown in the promo picture. A matter of style, I presume."
4.0,"The bag is everything I expected though I haven't been able to travel with it yet until weekend, so I won't be able to rate how durable and how effective it is with long distance flight. I will like to order one more bag but when I try to order, the arrival date is June 3rd and would be travelling that morning."
4.0,"1. I received it within a week! So impressed! (Thailand)<br />2. The corset is very heavy and stiff so it gives you a great straight posture when you walk or sit at the working desk. Which is very good for me cause I always hump my back when working on the computer. This corset helps me a lot.<br />3. The design is so beautiful so I'm sure your boyfriends will love it.<br />4. Very difficult to wear. First 2 days it took me 1 hour to button it so I have to find the how to wear video to learn. But once I can wear it, it is quite comfortable. Not as torturing as I expected.<br />5. Anyway cause I ordered a small size 24&#34; to shrink my now 30&#34; waist to my original waist 24&#34;, it can't fit me. I have to loosen up the string to max in order to wear it.<br /><br />This is 2nd day I wear it. I will update my result within 2 weeks.<br /><br />UPDATE (after 1 week)<br />1. I wear it 6-7 hrs. daily. (I tighten up the string to make the corset as tight as I can)<br />2. I eat carb, sugar, coca-cola as usual. No diet/No exercise.<br />Cause I want to make sure the corset works on its own without any additional weight loss regime.<br /><br />RESULT : my waist shrinks from 30&#34; to 28.5 in 7 days.<br /><br />I'll update again after 14 days."
4.0,So cute and great material for such a low price.  Hasn't been tested yet but so far we are pleased.
4.0,"This dress is very cute, and is exactly what is pictured. The material is somewhat thick, which I like. The dress is perfect for a costume/dress up kind of thing, but durable enough to be used everyday. The top part is a little snug, but only because my proportions don't fit standard sizing. I ordered a medium, so it fits my waist perfectly. I ordered the yellow, and it very closely matched the picture. I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
4.0,"The dress in itself is really pretty, I just didnt like the way it fit on me. Where the waist joins the hip, it &#34;blooms out&#34; and made my hips look bigger then they are."
4.0,Good for the price. It disintegrated in the water a little quicker than other suits though.
4.0,Neck is very small for an XL shirt.
4.0,I am small with DD chest and it fits pretty well everywhere but my boobs. So I leave that button undone and wear a white cami underneath and tie the bow in a loose knot over the open button. I get tons of compliments on how cute it is!
4.0,The bracelet itself is beautiful. Just disappointed that it doesn't fit better.
4.0,Love these goodies! 4 star given due to they pile after so many years and washings.
4.0,"Cute, comfortable and a great price for an adorable sundress. Order a size down as this dress is HUGE. It's a cotton jersey type, not see through. I bought the red and black and received many compliments. Perfect for the summer heat and easy slip on dress."
4.0,Love this shirt I wear it with my favorite bohemian lounge pants! Comfortable and looks good!! I plan to buy more in different colors! I’m 5’7 around 220lbs I bought the 16 it’s a perfect fit!
4.0,beautiful but fit is a little small. would recommend a size up but everyone is different.
4.0,otherwise cute. I just won't dry it
4.0,"I wear my wallet in my front pocket and though this a nicely built unit, it was just a bit too big for me.<br /><br />Still recommend."
4.0,"So a few years ago, I bought, what I thought, was this exact same dress from a much more expensive online retailer, revolveclothing.com and loved it! But never wore. During a move across the country I somehow managed to loose my dress! So sad! The other day I came across this, with the same picture as the dress I lost, so I immediately bought it! And while I like the dress I just received, I don’t think it’s the same material or fit as the other one. I did just have a baby when I bought and tried on dress #1 so my body was much diff and maybe since, I have exaggerated/ built up the quality & fit in my mind of said dress v dress #2, bc I wanted to fit it so badly. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Anyway, for $16 this is an excellent dress, very flowy and well lined, makes me think of Lauren Conrad. It’s a little big in the shoulder straps and slightly longer than I would like, I am 35yo, 5/6 125lbs. I don’t know if I would bother to tailor the straps (not hem) or not but it’s a thought! I am giving 4/5 stars just because I’ll never get over my lost dress."
4.0,"Like these, however they are wider than expected."
4.0,but they do look great
4.0,"I really like this bag: it’s got a really tough exterior, fabric-wise, and it is now the bag I ALWAYS use, 24/7. I love the multi-pocket approach that bags like this take, and how each unit is different from the last. It’s amazing how much this messenger bag can take: it doesn’t seem like it can hold a Kindle Fire HD and a trade-size (6”x9”) paperback, as well as a few Moleskine journals and a whole host of other items.  Every so often I find myself noticing a pocket I hadn’t really noticed before, and wondering what new items I can now take along with me. SEE MY PHOTO FOR HOW MUCH THIS BAG CAN CARRY.<br /><br />In terms of its construction I really like the waterproofed 1000D nylon wire…it feels like it can take a bullet. I did, however, have one error in this bag – one of the seams up front was incomplete (in other words, not a tear in the fabric), and when I contacted the company I was immediately assured that they would address the fault directly (meaning, I believed, on both the production line and the quality review line) and the product was fully guaranteed for customer satisfaction.<br /><br />Otherwise, I just love the MOLLE bags (“Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment”) in that the Modular aspect of that acronym means that the bag is part of a system that can either accept add-ons or be added on itself through Velcro attachments (also pictured??). What I really like about these bags is their ease of use and transport: as I mentioned earlier the sections readily accept their own kind or number of content, and when each portion is secured by zippers or mesh or whatever the bag can be grabbed and hauled whenever you need to GO fast. And you don’t have to root through one BIG pocket for everything: the multitude of pockets lets you find what you need logically and speedily.<br /><br />And, personally, I love the black bag because it is such a great factor in making itself invisible against most floor mats when you decide to leave it behind in the car…I know in my car it’s virtually impossible to see. And the construction of the strap and the bands allow for an easy over-the-shoulder approach to carrying it, or if you’d rather you can carry it more toward your back or, if you prefer, your front<br /><br />As I said, it’s the bag I use 24/7; its ability to carry so much in such a small space makes getting ready to go a really quick operation, and I love how it aids a logical organization.  All in all, this is an attractive, well-made, sleek, lean carrying case that should provide you years of use.<br /><br />NOTE: I was supplied with a free promotional sample in order to provide an honest and unbiased review…which this is."
4.0,"This is my second pair of nectars. I love the style & brand. You can’t beat the price, but you can beat up the glasses. My first pair had mirror lenses, they scratched up pretty badly because I’m irresponsible with using the little cloth bag they come in. I also somehow broke one of the ear pieces, not on the hinge but the actual plastic, but I’m not complaining... I had them for about 6 months, wore them adventuring in Costa Rica, out fishing, hiking, and gardening. They got good use. I’m being more careful with my second pair! I will also add, if you have a wide head.. I wouldn’t recommend them. I don’t and these squeeze my nogin and cause a lot of discomfort in the first couple of months until they loosen up. They should look into sizing or adjustable options."
4.0,"Typically binders don’t fit me very well since I have a very large chest coupled with a skinny waist. A fellow large chested friend recommended Underworks, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it fit near perfectly. While the chest area isn’t as flat as I might wish it to be, I can always think of Joseph Joestar’s masculine busty chest and that makes me feel a lot better about my body. Definitely the best binder that I’ve come across to date and a good price too."
4.0,"Ordered these as part of a gift I was giving to a brand new flight attendant. Her favorite color is purple so I ordered purple luggage tags, purple locks purple handle grips. The color was nice and bright so it will stand out among all those black crew bags. Not sure how it’s holding up, she’s only been flying since November 2019 so time will tell."
4.0,"Pretty but runs large. I am 5'6, 160 lbs, athletic build, 36C, both xl and l were way too big for me. I might try a medium but can't find one with prime shipping. I don't think it will offer any support in the breast area and it won't really allow for any bra (other than strapless)."
4.0,Like the variety of colors and materials. Will be buying in a large size in the future.
4.0,"waist and bust are cut for someone who is not as plus size on the top.  fits OK, just have to keep pulling it down when wearing it."
4.0,"I love this dress.  It is great for me to wear to work but also cute for casual wear.  I'm 5'3"" and a size 12 and have this in the XLarge.  I probably could have easily worn the large.  I carry weight around my middle and if the skirt is too high on this type of dress it tends to highlight my stomach and hint at a maternity dress.  This doesn't have that effect on me.  I like the tulip style sleeves.  They provide coverage on the top of the arms with some interest and without being too tight. The fabric is a thicker, silky jersey with good drape. It comes out of a machine washing dry looking great - no wrinkling or fading.  I would like this in other colors.  I wish they made it in more than just black and navy. "
4.0,A little longer than anticipated but my daughter was ok with it.  It worked well for Coraline costume.
4.0,fades after a month.
4.0,I'm only 5ft tall so it's a little long for me other than that i love it.
4.0,Great looking jacket but lining is not as thick as I expected.
4.0,Love the fit. Very comfortable. Wish it came in more colors.
4.0,"So, let me start off by saying I ordered this on a Friday, getting told I would receive it the following Monday. I needed it the next day, on Tuesday, for my office's decades day theme. Unfortunately, due to no fault of the seller, I did not receive the costume on Tuesday, and instead recieved it a week after ordering.<br />I ordered a medium even though I typically wear a small as I have recently gained a couple of pounds due to working out. It was still a bit big on me in the upper chest area, but fit snug on the bottom half. I didn't notice much of a stretch to the material. The gloves it comes with were tighter than I expected, and I have skinny arms, so it surprised me. I thought the necklace had come broken but it did not. The earrings were not clip ons, which was a bit disappointing because I don't have my ears pierced and that's why I bought this costume over others (I had read comments stating they received clip on earrings), but again, not the fault of the seller. The other accessories were fine as well.<br />The only reason I took off a star was due to the smell after unpacking 😅 it honestly smelt so bad, but appeared to be clean. I wasn't able to wear it to my Office's decade day, but will instead be wearing it to our Halloween party and will do zombie makeup! I'll be a Zombie Flapper, lol."
4.0,"I love these! I only wish they were lighter fabric, The pictures portrays them as light but not at all! But they are super comfy and not extremely tight. I will just save them for winter."
4.0,"I liked it and I'm a size 2X, but I had to return it because it fit a bit small, I needed a 3X, I guess it doesnt run true to size, but its a nice blouse,"
4.0,It’s a little too long in the legs  . Nice material
4.0,"Had a little trouble getting this over my ears, but once it's on, it stays put, and looks great!"
4.0,"This coat runs a little big but that means there's room for layers when it gets colder.  The fabric is really soft and I like that there are 4 outside pockets - lots of rooms for gloves.  The fur on the hood is detachable and the hood is big enough that I can wear earmuffs underneath.  Overall, I think it will be a good coat to keep me warm in winter."
4.0,"I purchased this as prize giveaways for one of my family functions and the kids all went crazy trying to win a set of these lights for them.  Then when night time rolled around, you could just see everyone playing with them.  Very fun to use."
4.0,"Just to start, I am 5’7 and 180 pounds so I ordered the large in white. I got this dress for an upcoming sorority event and I love it. The dress is very comfy and lightweight which will be good for being in a warmer building at school. I swear the dress looks better in person than it does in my photo. It fits perfect but let me tell you, the dress is very very see through. Like, more see through than you would expect. I bought a nude leotard to where under it so now everything is back to perfect. Also, the tie belt on the front is a little bit less flattering than I thought so i’m gonna have to find a nice way to tie it. Overall, the dress is pretty dang nice and I want to get more colors of it."
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful... The bar is a tad bit long, but I make it work. I have it in my cartilage. It does annoy me a little bit when I get out of the shower. It's backwards and I have to flip it back into place, but other than that, it's really pretty. I ordered the Aurora borealis."
4.0,Photo shoot at workplace.
4.0,"I love the look of this purse and have received several compliments on it.  It seems kind of stiff to me, which I hope will loosen up with continued use.  It is a very large purse.  I always seem to carry so much stuff in my other purses and this purse definitely solved that problem.  There is so much room inside this purse that I haven't been able to put enough stuff in it!  I ordered the burgundy color and it is very nice.  I wish the outside pockets were a little deeper and wider but other than that, this is a great purse and it is very well made and doesn't look cheap."
4.0,"Good cost. Nice tank, comfy fabric, a little long."
4.0,"Blouse is too small, seller is working to correct"
4.0,If it really good and it's really a warm coat
4.0,"My husband purchased this item to replace the silicone strap his watch came with.  He had a very hard time trying to get it on and, ultimately, I brought it to my local jeweler who finished the job.  He is very happy now that he can wear it."
4.0,Solid piece of jewelry.  Good quality and customer service.
4.0,Beautiful swimsuit.  I'm 5 '3  160 lbs. ordered XL  a little snug.... But it's a keeper.  Good color and quality.
4.0,Not too fond if the chain but it is still an awesome necklace. Looks just like the pic
4.0,"This top is absolutely gorgeous, but it runs small. I normally wear a medium and it was too tight across the chest and I fell like it was too short for me. For reference I'm 5'3, 127 lbs with a 36DD bust. I think a large would fit, but maybe on the snug side."
4.0,These boots fit her almost perfectly. They kept her feet dry and toasty. She liked them too. She will not be able to wear them next year.
4.0,They look beautiful although I haven’t worn them yet
4.0,Small is somewhat large on my youngest son. But he still likes it. He's 17 and on the small side!
4.0,Comfortable . Easy on and off with adjustable straps. Great shade of gray. A little longer than expected
4.0,Love it! Got lots of compliments. Easy to wear.
4.0,"Overall the band is comfortable and very easy to switch on and off of watch face.  The band is a little thin and feels a bit cheap for genuine leather but for the price, it's a nice every day band.  I do love the color of the navy, it's deep and rich."
4.0,Tight fitting but still beautiful not for plum ladies.
4.0,look good on me
4.0,very comfy. I will order more.
4.0,"ORDER A SIZE UP!!! it's asian sizing, and it runs small. after reading the other reviews I ordered a medium (I'm 5'3 125lbs and usually wear a small on top) and the medium fits but is snug, the sleeves are just long enough. I could have gone up a size if I wanted it roomier, my usual size small would have been too small! Definitely order up a size from your regular size. If you like your sweatshirts to fit a little looser/layer over other clothes, I would recommend ordering up two sizes from your regular size.<br /><br />Good quality fabric!! There are several knock off versions of this sweater floating around amazon, but I picked this one based on the other reviews. True to the other reviews, the material is nice, thick, soft sweatshirt material and is definitely good for cold weather! The pockets are per hand, not a tunnel pocket that connects all the way through like most sweatshirts. A little small to fit my phone/wallet in the pocket but its ok!<br /><br />The only thing I really didn't like is that it comes with a lot of logo emblems that are made of fake leather and I think make the sweatshirt look &#34;cheap&#34; so I cut them off with a seam ripper which was pretty easy done carefully, and left no mark after I removed them. They all say &#34;fashion!!&#34; on them, which, LOL. Easy to remove, though."
4.0,This necklace is very nice
4.0,"I ordered this shirt for a few reasons. I need a shirt for an upcoming plane trip with my toddler, that was loose, comfortable, and not sloppy. I wanted it to be dark to hide any spills that may incur during the trip, including a layover. I also wanted it to be loose enough to hide the stomach I have recently developed because of steroids I have had to start due to a medical condition. This shirt fits all of my requirements and was inexpensive, which I appreciated. It is a very soft fabric, but has substance without being too heavy. My 4-star rating is due to the fact that in the picture, and as a Junior's item might indicate, it appears to have a tapered natural waist. However, the actual shirt is more boxy. This is disappointing, as I still have a waist I would like to show, and help offset the heaviness below. Nevertheless, I like it enough for it's purpose and have already worn it with shorts and felt comfortable in it. I think it's worth the money. My guess on the Junior label without the Junior styling is that it is trying to appeal to school dress codes."
4.0,"This skirt was a huge surprise. The material is really good and it came with an extra button. The one thing that was wrong with it was my mistake. I ordered a size up from my usual because one of my measurements was really close to the next size in the provided size chart so I decided to play it safe. It was too big for me to wear up on my stomach, but it does fit if I wear it lower on my waist. I don't want to go through a return to exchange it to a lower size, so I will just keep it as is. I love the pinup style of this skirt.<br /><br />I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"I wish the top of this had a little more structure it in to keep it up when it's opened. But it's got so many compartments, great for traveling."
4.0,Case too small an alot of stuff I can't use to so I have it away. An kept what I'd use
4.0,Over all great buy! Loved the dress. Went perfect for the 1950s look I was going for. Only downside was the dresses torso area was a little long for me. I am 5ft 2inches and if I had more time to alter it I would of brought the waist line up about an inch. But over all I was happy with the purchase! I recommend buying an under layer to add extra flair to the skirt.
4.0,The material is breathable while still doing its job
4.0,Beautiful and came right on time!
4.0,Beautiful dress. Really makes your waistline look smaller. I deducted a star because mine came without the sash.
4.0,"I like it,  but a bit pricey. And the mauve has a weird smell to it. Other than that its a good buy."
4.0,Pas mal; un peu légère et spartiate
4.0,Stopper on pandora braclet
4.0,I love the dress everyone ask if it is my birthday... It was not... the dress is very comfortable and cool
4.0,Lovely set I would purchase it again if I had to give it to someone as a gift like the price of it and the company has plenty over under sets that I might look into
4.0,These are super cute. I gave 4 stars because they weren't as big as I wanted them to be.
4.0,"This is a very good bag. I use it daily , this isnt the best quality bag, but u get what u pay for."
4.0,"Too small, nice lines, nice green color in sun, but in shade it’s too dark and doesn’t look green."
4.0,"60% polyester<br />35%cotton<br />5% spandax<br /><br />There is no name brand on the tag at the neck, just a size. Color and text are beautiful. Fit is fitted, so if you want something lose, size up."
4.0,"I RECEIVED THIS PENDANT, ALTHOUGH IT IS WAY TOO SMALL, IT IS BEAUTIFUL. THIS SELLER HAS EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE, ALWAYS GOT BACK TO MY EMAILS IMMEDIATELY. RETURNED ITEM."
4.0,Si me agrado es cómodo
4.0,"weird fit, but I decided  to keep it because it is different....it's roomy, but not oversized...I have to adjust it a bit to get it to fit the way I want....make sure you get the back seam going straight down the back.....just play with it....casual chic with sneakers, low heel/flat sandals, baseball cap or small brim hat and a big tote....FUN!"
4.0,This hoodie fits perfect the longer one fits different. If you want longer hoodie get a size up from the shorter. Example if you can wear a xlarge in the shorter hoodie the longer you need xxl
4.0,Looks great and fits well but the head jewelry dosent match at all different color metal even
4.0,"I absolutely love the feeling of these shirts. They pull you in ever so lightly and smooth things out under workout shirts or sweaters. My only grievance is with the length. After washing, they seemed to shrink a bit and they are now just barely able to be tucked into my pants but they still do so I still love them."
4.0,"Looks cute, fits fine...don't expect much support. It does shift if you move around too much, so don't plan on dancing or getting too crazy! The side and back straps don't stay neatly spread out, they do roll a bit. Cute for the price."
4.0,Good lenses. ..... Fit well and very comfortable.
4.0,A little flimsy but it was great for the plane as holding my phone/passport through security.
4.0,"I love the way this bead looks.  The sparkle in the glass and the stars are a stunning combination, absolutely beautiful.  The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the stars are not flush against the bead, they bend easily and keep getting caught on my shirts and pulling strings.  So far I've been able to bend the stars back every time, but I know eventually they will break off.  So, while I love the beads, I don't dare to wear them every day."
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture.  It is thin but for the price I think this is a good backpack.
4.0,"These were a birthday gift for my twenty year old. She absolutely loves them! The only reason I gave four stars is because I have a couple of worries about the stem staying attached. Aside from that, they are gorgeous."
4.0,Great price cute glasses
4.0,Needs pockets and the small is to lose!
4.0,That shirts are ok they are standard cotton only issue is the font of the letters it's a personal preference but I'm not fond of them. However it was my wife's choice for shirts
4.0,I just wish that the lettering was bigger.  My coworkers had a tough time seeing what it said.  I received it quickly and I am happy that I got it.
4.0,"I've used a bunch of different bands with my Versa 2, and so far this is the only one that was a huge pain to fit into place. I may file down the sides of the second band before I take a shot at putting it in. The plastic pieces that hold the pins have zero wiggle room.<br /><br />I have another set of bands with the same design from another manufacturer. These are just as comfortable and fit well on my wrist. The only downside is getting them installed."
4.0,This was an inexpensive way to enchance several of my rings. Glad I found this ring enchancer.
4.0,Fits as expected. I like the fit mostly. Wish the cups were pulled closer together. The only things I don't like is the fact that the clasp turns and the straps loosened when I was riding horse (I'm only a B cup so this bra is not for any bouncing around if riding horse loosens the straps for me.<br />Overall though it's a good everyday bra for work and I'll probably purchase again in future.
4.0,"Yes, this product does run very small. I'm an XL in US clothes, 5'2, 180lbs, and wear the 3XL thermo shaper comfortably.<br /><br />I am in the process of working out to lose a lot of weight. I go walking/jogging every day, and every day that I wear this I AM SOAKED! I know it is only water weight, but seeing the scale number drop is motivation.. even if it is just mental! I have lost 25lbs by using these while I walk and counting calories. I even ordered a smaller size for when this gets too big.<br /><br />I would give this product 5 stars, but the only drawback it has is a little annoying. When just walking, the waist band stays in place just fine, but when you start to jog, it starts to roll up for me. I hate having to adjust it when I go back to walking, but I deal because of how much I enjoy wearing it."
4.0,"The pants were all black, not outlined in white rips as the picture displayed."
4.0,"I'm 5'3"" and this dress was just longer than expected. It came to mid-calf on me. Otherwise I loved the fit, material, and color"
4.0,Works great on tops you can’t wear a bra with.
4.0,this is really sexy and cute! Fits just right and I’d buy it in another color in the future!
4.0,"Nice watchband, very different. Would have given 5 stars but the bracelet gets very loose when moving your wriat around."
4.0,Very nice piece of jewelry. Great quality.
4.0,I ordered Med and it was too large and I ordered small and love it.  It's really long which is nice
4.0,"I love that these are light-weight, they are a little on the small side, almost too short to tuck in, but very warm."
4.0,I ordered this dress for my sister and believe it or not it fits well on a pregnant lady! She wore it to a gala and was complimented on well the dress fit!]
4.0,"Good price for what I am hoping is a solid piece of jewelry - I bought them for my athletic daughter in hopes that they will hold up to her active lifestyle , ps she loved the look of them."
4.0,"Love these shirts, but the way they look online is that they are loose. They just barely fit me and I'm a definite medium. Don'y get me wrong they still look good, but they are not loose tank tops that are tight."
4.0,"Gorgeous ring!! I love it! It doesnt get unpainted! ;) love love love!!you wont regret to purchase it, is awesome!"
4.0,Good workout tank tops.  Fit a little on large side so kind of baggy on me.  Guess I have to fill in with more workouts...
4.0,It’s very simple looking which I like wouldn’t wear this The shower tho. Just a quick piece to put on when I’m on tho go and feeling girly.
4.0,"The fit was long enough (bunches right at the belt line) and looked like a tucked in shirt. However, the sides were way too baggy."
4.0,"Looks good and the gem looks like real onyx. Only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was the gold finish was a bit dull or not polished, making it look like real gold. Comfortable to wear all day, gets attention!"
4.0,"Super cute, but fits small. I ordered a large and it fits more like a medium. I ended up giving it to my teenage daughter. The material is soft and my daughter said it is very comfortable."
4.0,Either the short runs a size small or it shrinks a lot during first wash. Order one size larger
4.0,I ordered this tie along with the Moda Di Raza Men's Necktie Woven Cloth Satin Finish Necktie - Mint Green assuming they would be the same color considering they came from the same seller. They were not. The boys tie is darker. We still used both for my wedding but the different colors made me give this product 4 stars instead of 5.
4.0,"nice size, good product for its intended purpose.  (if you purchase one in a color, beware the smell.  It does fade.)"
4.0,"Everyone loves it. Haven't had it long enough to know if it will last though. I'm hopeful though, I guess we'll see."
4.0,"The only reason for 4 stars is because it is NOT chiffon. The material was thicker and sort of rough. Not as transparent as I would have liked. HOWEVER, the color and fit is VERY flattering, so I am happy with my purchase even though it wasn't what I expected. I normally wear an XL. (5'7, 180lb, 36DDD) That's what I bought, and it was true to size and plenty roomy. The shirt arrived on time."
4.0,Work well. I’m a large and they feel a bit tight but still fit I should’ve gone a size up
4.0,I highly liked how the bottoms fit me. The top on the other hand was to small. I am a 38F and I ordered a XXXL and my top half was heaving out of it. I wish there was an option to switch out the top for a different size. Other than that it will hide my imperfections for my honeymoon.
4.0,"I am pleasantly surprised with these sweats. I was worried that even though it says women’s pants, that they would actually be juniors sizing. They are a true women’s size. I ordered up a size because I know Bullabong runs small. I am 5’9” and 150 lbs and the large fits perfectly."
4.0,I like it. Its a little wobbly though...
4.0,Great looking shirt for the golf course. I get lots of attention from the lady golfers.
4.0,"This hat runs a little bit large but it does have an internal cinch to tighten it as well as a chin strap.<br /><br /> It does a great job of blocking the sun and looks pretty cute on me, I like that it is easily packable for travel and storage.  Perfect for the beach or gardening."
4.0,I love this bath wrap. only complaint is that it's not very absorbent.
4.0,Nice dress but the slight odor.
4.0,This will be a gift for a young friend.  Small a nd just right for someone who does not carry very much in a purse.  It is very cute for young people & adults as well.
4.0,Bought it for my nephew and he loved it. The quality wasn't that great. But made my boy happy.
4.0,Needs a pocket.
4.0,Little heavy but totally cute
4.0,These turtles are adorable and well made.
4.0,"Bought for my 23 month old, small-headed child to go to a car race. They fit great. They expand really well to fit different size heads too."
4.0,"Item was exactly as described. However I didn’t care for the sleeves. It could be because I have big arms and the cut made my arms look bigger. Might look better on a slim person, but the color and material was good"
4.0,"I was excited to get the opportunity to review this product because I work with leather for a hobby. Just remember my review may be more critical because I work more with leather. I received this leather cuff a day after ordering and it came in a velvet pouch as you see in the first picture. The stainless steel plate was engraved really nice and the black made it stand out, the stainless steel seemed very sturdy and formed around my wrist very nicely when I put it on as you see in the pictures. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars and unless you work much with leather but most people might not notice or might actually like it the way it is, but the thickness and weight of the leather was very very thin I’m not saying that’s a bad thing if you wear it to the office or church and casual like but I wear a cuff everyday thru the rigors of my warehouse job. You can see the thickness of mine (banged up for 5 years) compared to this one I like heft it’s what I prefer because I’m 6’3 255. I will trim the end of the belt excess that extends out and use black leather dye to seal it to give it a finished look to my wrist size. Like I said to each his own I will wear this proudly when I’m out on the town but for work or anything that might catch on it no I would not at all.  My opinion is honest as is my word yes I would recommend this for casual because of the spirituality engraving but a thicker leather on the bottom layer (not the layer that holds the metal plate) would have made it great. I truly hope this helps. “Peace”"
4.0,"Very pretty and well made, but very uncomfortable."
4.0,Wish material a bit thicker
4.0,"Top is amazing, gives perfect lift and is fitted to the waist correctly. The bottoms fit well but they are Very thin."
4.0,This item fits as good or better than expected.  Excellent styling and colors. The beauty is as good if not better than the more expensive ones.
4.0,Arrived on time. Good quality material and fits as expected. Would buy again.
4.0,"They were definitely worth ten dollars, easy fit, and instructions. Shines like real gold. But tops don't fit accurately I would recommend only purchasing the bottom set."
4.0,"I love the style, but it was a little small for me around the breast area, so I had to return it. I'm 148, with 38D cup size."
4.0,makes me proud
4.0,"Good quality and looks nice. I ordered my son's usual glove size LG and they were too small, so I will order the XL next time."
4.0,"I like the hat for it's functionality. My head is on the smaller side and I was able to make the hat small enough to fit but it threw off the look of the hat. I had to sew down the band and remove the bow. (I tried to upload photo, but couldn't)"
4.0,"It is a little snug, however if i got a size larger it would look wrong on me. It looks amazing. I plan to wear it to my wedding. Love it. It makes me feel elegant and beautiful."
4.0,"The Turnhier Bike Shorts are designed to be used for long cycling expeditions but can be used for other exercises.<br /><br />I have now used this for cycling and for my favorite exercise, HIIT aerobics.  The pants are pretty, with a heavily elasticized waist (more so than I have seen with other bike shorts). The ones for women have a pretty pink design that goes down the outside of the leg.  I am 5'2"", 150 pounds and normally wear a size 8 or 10 and these fit fine.  I wore these for cycling around our neighborhood and other areas and they are comfortable.  I do casual cycling.  They worked well for that but I did not have the chance to do a very long trip.  When I do I will edit this review.  I can say that they work well despite the ample padding in the you-know-what area for other exercises.  The HIIT workout I did was great with these on with no slippage, or discomfort noticed whatsoever.<br /><br />I also thought these were a good price.  I recommend these."
4.0,"I had previously ordered the &#34;Lapasa Men's 4-Pack Boxer Briefs Micro Modal ULTRA SOFT Low Rise No-Fly Trunk&#34; which I like.  For some reason I thought these were the of the same material - but I was wrong, my bad!  I'm looking forward to Lapasa coming out with these in the micro modal material.  Thanks."
4.0,This bag exceeded my expectations great quality!!!!
4.0,Love the grey but the black seems a lot smaller?
4.0,It’s nice but runs small and is really big in the back
4.0,"Very well made dress, true to size and color. The fabric is soft, stretchy and breathable. The one downside is: it shows ~everything~! Panties, bra lines, rolls, all of it, it's pretty unforgiving. Well made product, but not something I'll be able to wear often easily."
4.0,This was a purchase for a wedding dressed it up with bracelets and earrings and a wonderful pair of heels many compliments
4.0,"I purchased the taupe pair of boots. I have a few pros and a cons. Pros: they fit perfectly. I wear a 7 1/2 and have wide feet the 7 1/2 shoe works but I have thin socks on. The shoes looks exactly like the picture, little darker but it’s still a beautiful boot. Cons: shoe box was damaged. opened the box and unzipped the right boot, then I went to unzip the left boot and it wouldn’t budge.. I spend a few minutes on trying to figure out why the boot would not unzip. So looking inside the boot and the material that protects your heal from the zipper was glued too far over next to the zipper and it was getting caught. Once I pulled it out of the way it was fine and would unzip. After putting the boot on and walked around in the house for a little bit.. btw the zipper is loud with each step. Now I’m taking off the left boot and guess what. Yep. Couldn’t get it unzipped again. Because of this I will send back for a different pair."
4.0,"Ordered a Medium. Wayyyyy too big for me. I'm 5'6'', 130 lbs. I think if I had gotten the XS or S, the fit would have been right. Nice length. Definitely not too short! Sat right above the knee on me. Pretty modest dress, though was fitted up in chest area. Would purchase again... just would like to try another size. Material is cotton. May shrink?"
4.0,Good collector piece
4.0,Great seller. Product was super tight on my face though.
4.0,"Cute, short, sparkly.  The only complaint is that you leave a trail of sequins behind you wherever you go."
4.0,This hat fits perfectly and looks fab with any beach outfit!! So inexpensive too yet good quality!
4.0,These are comfortable and cute but I didn’t like the tie around the waist. I’m going to cut it off. Other than that fit great.
4.0,"Lovely purse, but the clasp was not only almost impossible to fasten, but kept popping open. Small purse, does not fit much inside. That said, it is very pretty."
4.0,I love the multiple color options. Nice large size and pretty light weight. The only thing that I didn’t like is that the material and weight of the black pair felt like play glasses that children play dress up in.
4.0,"great look, not much for a swim"
4.0,"I got mine early. Very pretty I tried them on once my ears were fine til I took them out, my ears were sore n red for a day so I probably won't wear much."
4.0,Beautiful...double duty as a dress.
4.0,They arrived 3days ahead of the expected arrival. Just how I expect it. There are so cute! 😍
4.0,"The women's yoga socks with the non slip bottoms only fit up to a size 9. I cannot wear these. It just gob smacked me when I saw the sizes. So, I checked them over, they look nice and the bottoms were covered in the anti slip grips and then I put them in my charitable donations box."
4.0,"I love these running shoes. I have 3 pairs. I have worn them for MudRunner Oblivion, MudRunner Classic and street running, and I also have a pair for daily wear to take my dog out walking. I can be walking across morning dewy grass in any field or sports area, and my feet get soaked. These boots are not remotely, not slightly, not even a teeny bit waterproof. But they are excellent in all other ways. Once wet, they take an easy 3 days to dry out (which is why I have 3 pairs). Obviously you can't put them in a dryer, so it's air-dry only, and unless you have a sunny spot (unlikely if it's pouring with rain) they do literally take days to dry. And they retain the ""runners feet"" smell too, even after being washed in cold water. Otherwise, as I said, I love 'em!"
4.0,This fit my daughter a little bigger than expected.
4.0,Thought the fabric was different but still very happy with it
4.0,I loved this cardigan and really like the full zip.<br /><br />1. Has a double zipper<br />2. Comfy and slim<br />3. Great for winter and decent for fall as well.
4.0,Smaller than 1inch..hollow back..good design
4.0,"Color is a bit off from picture,  seems to be great for price."
4.0,"The zipper pocket is in the back.  For sitting, it's uncomfortable to have a wallet or a phone back there.  For running, it's great.  It's out of the way and doesn't slap like a thigh pocket does.<br /><br />The leg length is a little shorter than I like, but it's as described.  The rise from crotch to waist is also as expected.  Overall, they are pretty comfortable, though they do grip onto my thighs and ride up just a little.<br /><br />Still, I like these a little better than the 11"" waist ones with the side zipper.  The fit is much better."
4.0,"Nice sweater - a little more of a reddish purple than i was expecting. Haven't worn it yet. No - it doesn't look like an expensive sweater, but then it WASN'T expensive and I knew that ordering it. Mine had no loose threads or pulls in it. Seems sturdy enough. You get what you pay for' folks. For the price of this sweater I'm satisfied."
4.0,I ordered one size up as recommended and the fit was just right. Very soft and comfortable.
4.0,Very pretty floral design but the skirt is a bit more cream colored and the shirt is white hence 4 stars. Still looks nice together and I’d buy it again
4.0,"Someone from hynes victory must be reading my reviews.  At long last a bag loaded with zippered pockets.  Just what the doctor ordered!  There are pockets all over this bag.  The outside pockets (a generous 7 pockets in all) either zip or snap closed.  Then there are two internal compartments each of which have pockets... in one internal compartment there is a pocket with a zippered close and in the other there are a couple of open pockets.  Personally I have never seen the point to these open pockets because when our bags get tossed about (which they inevitably will) most things will just come flying out of those pockets.<br /><br />The styling of this bag and its pockets is quite nice.  I am not a fan of the very glossy, in-your-face zippers and pulls but I suspect most people will like them.  This is described as &#34;synthetic&#34; leather.  I don't know exactly what that means but I can tell you it doesn't have that horrid stench of new PU leather like some bags I've seen. The synthetic leather is exceedingly soft and pliable...  so much so that you can easily crumple it up.  The lining is also very soft.  The bag comes with a long strap that is removable and a shorter strap which stays on the bag.  I've never quite understood why bag manufacturers do that.  If you want to offer two lengths of strap, make both removable.  This bag will look silly if the long strap is on with the short strap there as well.  That's just my opinion of course.<br /><br />I really like most things about the styling of this bag which is why it is getting four stars rather than three.  This bag arrived with a very broken zipper on one of the front pockets which basically renders that pocket to be useless.  There is only one broken zipper but the others don't seem to be the highest quality.  They are and they are strong but I've seen better.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Great looking bag, well stitched and comfortable to carry.  One of my zippers arrived completely broken which is not good particularly because I was sent this bag free of charge for the purpose of writing this review you seem to be reading.  But other than that, pockets are plentiful and the syling is lovely.  Maybe only deserves three stars because of the zippers"
4.0,A little baggy and cheap material but overall good quality for the price
4.0,Colors are true and bright.  I am giving it four stars because the dress fits a little tighter and shorter than I like but still very cute.
4.0,This tank is so cute. The material is great and it’s very comfortable to work out in. I got a couple compliments on it too. It does run a little small. I got it in a large but I think I should have gotten it in a XL so it would be a little longer. All in all it’s a great tank.
4.0,Great fashion eyewear!!
4.0,"The shorts feel a bit stiff and the fit is not as shapely as it is portrayed in the picture. Other than that, it looks exactly like the picture and gets the job done."
4.0,It definitely run small and I haven't washed it yet so I'm hoping it does not shrink. It does fit very well and it's still long even though it is small. Excited to wear it this fall
4.0,"I'll give it to La Isla they can make a supportive bra for those of large boobage at an affordable price.<br />I am an athletic 36DDD. This completely beats VS very expensive and completely inept sports bra.<br />My boobs still kinda stick out of this bra, but the extra piece of material helps. I feel the bra is supportive enough, though I find it has optimal support if worn in conjunction with a built-in-bra-shirt.<br />I like that the black can go under other shirts and it doesn't necessarily look like you are layering on the bras. In addition, the bra itself is pretty athletic looking, something that is often absent in larger sports bras."
4.0,Love that this makes your fitbit look more like jewelry.  The only thing I would like to see is something with smaller clasps.  The metal clasps combined with the fitbit technology make this look huge on my little wrist.
4.0,Love the shoe only wish I had ordered my size instead of ordering down.
4.0,Granddaughter loves them. Fits well.
4.0,"I purchased 3 umbrellas of different brands.  This one was sturdy, but very compact.  The stays were thin, but the cord reinforcement looks promising.  Haven't had it in the rain yet."
4.0,The blouse is pretty. True to size which I wear. Fitting is perfect. Cloth is nice. Can be matched on many sarees.<br />It has interlock stiches from inside and has cotton astar/ inner cloth from inside . Only the sleeves have simple stich and no interlock stich so I need to be more careful while washing so giving 4 stars.<br />Overall beautifulutiful. Glad to purchase. Ty
4.0,Overall good tho 1 chain broke in 2 months.
4.0,"The Octopus earrings are fun to wear. The Abolone stone at the top is very pretty and visible. However, I have short hair. I would recommend buying them. I like Liavey's jewelry."
4.0,"I haven't really worn them yet as I need them for a cruise I am going on.  However, I did try them on and found the somewhat large this is not the slippers fault because I have a narrow foot and really order narrow shoes.  They are well made and have good support."
4.0,Bought large and it's ok. At least it's not cotton so there's no shrinking to worry about
4.0,I like the material and the sweatband for your forehead. The placement of the buttons for your mask is just where it should be
4.0,"This is a nicely made robe.  I love the fabric and how it stays closed with the belt.  The fabric is really soft and comfy and the color is very flattering.  Its  tiny bit big in the sleeves is why I gave it four stars, I can roll the sleeves up but then the pretty pattern is not visible.  I do like the detailing.  I would buy this robe again, or as a gift for someone.  It is more of a cover up for company robe and not a lot of sex appeal."
4.0,"They are NOT BluBlocker but they get the job done for waaay less. The screws on the hinges could be more tight but they design is typical and like I said, the price is reasonable for a pair of plastic sunglasses."
4.0,Overall quality seems well but the size is definitely a bit bigger than expected
4.0,Nice but it runs small so one size up she be perfect!
4.0,Stretch out wearing for a few weeks
4.0,"Clever buckle design.  Simple to get exactly your right size.  My only complaint arises from the design.  If the belt is fastened into the buckle under tension it can be very difficult to release the buckle.  You may need to relieve the belt/buckle tension to be able to move the lever that decouples the buckle.  Otherwise, it is great so far."
4.0,Hard to beat this buckle for the price! The colors are vibrant and it looks really good on your belt. Very pleased with this item and the seller!
4.0,"I bought the light blue, brick red and white top.  The light blue is much lighter than what's in the photo.  It's a very pale, almost baby blue color.  The brick red isn't as deep of a red that is shown in photo.  I bought the white one first and really liked it and then decided to buy it in light blue and brick red.  I'll probably keep them since the fit is nice and the shirt is comfortable.<br /><br />Just note that the colors are not as shown."
4.0,"Thought it would be larger than it was actually pictured.  Started to return it but decided to keep it since I was able to house my small cell phones, charger and cords."
4.0,"This is a very nice bag. Classic tailored design.  I plan to use it for business, as an alternative to a conventional briefcase.  It's a bit bigger than I expected, but it's a good size to carry business files, a tablet and possibly a small laptop. It's a bit pricey, but it's a high quality brand and looks stylish.  We paid $286; not too happy that I just saw it on the Tory Burch website on sale for $209 but since it was out of stock there, that price is not available."
4.0,"skirt came out little smaller than what i had expected. the skirt itself is very nice. have not worn it yet, but hopefully i will in the future."
4.0,I like that the product was true to the size..
4.0,Material is soft and sizes are accurate. Great value for the price
4.0,Didn't look right with the top I had. I returned.
4.0,this is not what i expected but it keeps my  sunglasses safe from scratches and dust.<br />I can easily and quickly find my DGs when driving.......
4.0,"I'm got average arms for my size, 6'1&#34; @ 215#, and these fit me well. I wear these while driving as I have a mild sun allergy so while not only trying to reduce the typical driver/farmer tan I want to minimize overall exposure.<br /><br />I did get the white sleeves this go around and they stain pretty easy. Also the stitching tends to fray a little at the cuffs at each end but they have held up pretty well for me. They aren't hot at all and tend to wick away moisture. I toss mine into a garment bag when and wash them periodically."
4.0,This is what I expected. The fabric of the green skirt is thick enough.
4.0,Nice ring 😊
4.0,"I am a job coach, so I carry everything I need with me everyday. I had a beloved Thirtyone bag I carried for 4 years. It was time to be replaced.  This is a good equivalent to my old one. One less pocket on the outside but has an extra zip pocket on the inside.  Will it hold up as well as my old bag?? We shall see..."
4.0,Love it wish mines (female) was a little bigger tho.
4.0,Exactly what I wanted! Simple.
4.0,It draws interesting comments.
4.0,A little more straight than the picture projects but the color is great
4.0,"Material thin, fits well and cute"
4.0,It's a beautiful bag. I will be using it for a wedding in November...I'll let you know if it holds up.
4.0,"The spear itself is very nice but the tassels were all messed up, one to the point where it could not be fixed."
4.0,"This scarf is too thick and bulky, don't like it"
4.0,Have only had these through one snow storm but so far so good.
4.0,I ordered these a few months back and I thought I'd lost them so I ordered more but when I found them I cancelled my order and they got back to me quickly! So overall I would say they are okay piercings and have great service! Thank you!
4.0,A bit larger than the pair I lost. I like the color contrast plus they were cheaper than my previous ones.
4.0,"This band is very pretty, but a little bulky for my wrist. I have narrow wrists and the band is pretty thick. I think it would look much better on a bigger wrist. The seller should include the instructions on how to resize the band. It is a little tricky and the link ti the instructional video that they send to you upon request doesn't work that great. It takes time for the video to start and doesn't have any verbal instructions to it."
4.0,"They are just a little big, but overall very happy"
4.0,"Nice summer dress! Good fit! Well received a little thinner material than appears in photo, but looks good on!"
4.0,The material is thinner than I expected but overall I LOVE the dress. It fits perfectly; I expected it to be too big or have the proportions way off like some of the other similar dresses (different brands) from Amazon but it's great. Can't wait to wear it to work!
4.0,Have not worn as of yet. Very thin material. Color is way off from pic.
4.0,Fits nicely but noticed that the left leg hem was not hemmed up.
4.0,Just got it and it's as described. Hopefully it doesn't turn my skin green. I'll post an update if it does. The only thing I don't like is that it's really hard to adjust to get it comfortable. The metal is not really malleable. Other than that it's super cute and came pretty quickly.
4.0,"Fits as expected, the straps are soft and stretchy. The cups are firmer than most sports bras so that may not be great for those with larger chests as it adds to the bulk. I'll probably size up next time but this is still comfortable"
4.0,Overall not too bad but a large is very large.
4.0,"The corset and chemise are awesome and look much more expensive than what they were.  The skirt, while very pretty, is so lightweight that it is practically see-through.  Wearing a long slip helped that issue however it is a very difficult fabric to iron.  All said, I would recommend the outfit for the money.  I wore it to a luncheon with a renaissance group and received several compliments."
4.0,Bit tight but as expected.
4.0,Cap appears suitable for showing you are a Braves fan. We got it for a birthday gift and we think he will enjoy this hat. Hope it holds up and appears that it will.
4.0,"The dress is really lovely and comfortable. It is a little bit wide, but I expected this, based on other reviews and, since I am pregnant, that's a good thing. A necklace with a big pendant is a great combination for this dress!"
4.0,Nice to find a solid leather belt.<br />I also liked that it came with a hole punch to add additional holes when needed
4.0,Beautiful detail. Very wide boot. Runs a bit large.
4.0,"Very pretty earrings, bright colors, great item for the price! The only negative thing I have to say about them is the leaf earrings are extremely thin metal. I haven’t worn them yet but I’m almost afraid to use them they seem so fragile. Again, great for the price and can’t complain about the randomness. Overall, I’m pleased with these."
4.0,"One of my favorite watches , quality look and feel."
4.0,As expected !
4.0,Product is a little see though and not as loose as shown in the picture but very comfy!
4.0,The ring looks like the picture. I like it.
4.0,Material was a little thin but fit as expected and looked just like the models.
4.0,"Great product. I love the design & colors. If you make a petite version in the future, please reach out to me. For now, however, I think you need to be at least 5’5” for these to fit properly. I’m 5’2”, but have long legs. So long in fact that my hips almost rise to the same height as my husband who is about 5’9”. Unfortunately, the lines on the pants fall too low for me. Sad to have to return, as I like the quality otherwise."
4.0,"The dress is cute and I like the rushing, but the sizing runs very small. I'm 5'8"" and weigh 125 lbs. but the small barely fit over my breasts. This dress is best for women with very small breasts who are extremely thin. Although I always wear XS or S, I'm going to try this in a medium."
4.0,"Really love the shirt.  Its a nice weight but sadly, I need to lose a few more pounds so the bumps and bulges don't show so bad.  I like a loose fit to at least feel like I'm flaunting my fluffiness.  It's a good addition to your wardrobe for winter, however if you're between sizes round up rather than down.  Unless you're like me and have high hopes of getting into it.  It fits, don't get me wrong, its just not as flattering as I'm comfortable with right now.  Laying off that halloween candy should help that situation ."
4.0,I purchased this for my daughter last year and she loved it.  She is still using it and has had no problems with the wallet.
4.0,Great price and love the versatility- can be worn as beach cover up or dressed up to wear out or professionally
4.0,Beautiful color soft and sheer
4.0,Giving four stars since the anklet is as pictured however it would loosen easily and the beads would always twist around my ankle so that they were facing the back.
4.0,Exactly what I expected. Very lightweight but has a good cozy look to it. The sleeves stopped at an awkward spot for me. The sleeves were slightly longer than 3/4. The color and material are great!
4.0,The outfit was beautiful.  The fabric was soft. The shoes did not fit my 1 year old.
4.0,"Bought it for her as a Christmas present, she loved it. She essentially told me to buy it for her so kinda knew she was gonna love it. Didn't stop her from being childish and not wanting to get a job so I had to break up with her"
4.0,it nice but its come black very fast
4.0,I really like how they looked once I put them on.  Good value
4.0,"these are adorable!!! and a huge hit at my halloween party. the wings are LARGE and the elastic wrist bands make it easy to move with you. soo much better then the wired wings that are available. the wings are sheer so they did not look as vivid in person as they did in the picture, the headband is cute too. although it kind of hurt my head, it has those plastic teeth."
4.0,"Fits tts, comfortable."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised at the quality and fit. Don't forget to buy crinoline. It doesn't look as good without it.
4.0,Have not used them for actual travel but they look useful.
4.0,"I absolutely love the watch. It is very beautiful, however, I noticed that the back of it started rubbing off a little. It's only been about three weeks and I've only worn it maybe five times in those three weeks. Once again, beautiful watch, but I wish the gold didn't rub off so quickly."
4.0,perfect fit :)
4.0,"This wrap is just fine for going from the locker room to the pool and back.  The snaps are a great feature because you don't have velcro getting stuck on everything you touch.  I couldn't find any washing instructions, so just did cold, gentle and low dry.  Be aware, this is not an absorbent<br />towel for drying yourself--it just keeps you from dripping and covered up."
4.0,Hat is nice but sorta big and heavey on my head. Still pretty though.
4.0,These will do greatly as backups to those I have. Great product. heavy duty and sturdy. Thanks
4.0,"Cute earring! I thought it came with two! I thought they were a pair, but it’s only one! It’s cute though and fits well!"
4.0,"Good price, material is a little thin, but you get 4 so you can double, triple, or quadruple up!"
4.0,"Bought this for my daughter and she typically wears US 12 size.  So the first observation is that they are a bit too loose to her.  Because it doesn't fit well, she will have to wait to make use of it.  Eventually she will be able to wear them as her feet grows.<br /><br />Other then them not being a good fit, there are many other things to like about them - one, the overall color combination and design of these sandals is very good.  Especially the footbed with the silvery dots give it a very nice silver accented touch.  Two, the straps are very soft.  They are so easy to open and close due to the velcro mechanism that they support, rather than the pin and hole mechanism which can be intricate for kids to use.<br /><br />Then the footbed appears to have some cushion, not sure if it is due to memory foam or something else but it being soft makes a big difference and makes it easy for the child to wear these sandals for a long time.<br /><br />Then the sole is very rubbery even though it appears that it will wear out quite soon.  But with kids, very important for the sandals to have a good grip as that makes it easy for them to run around. (they are anyway quite light on their feet so hopefully, the sole won't wear too soon)<br /><br />Overall nice, it would have been even better if these were true to their size."
4.0,"I wore this for halloween, as a alien/space cowgirl. It was super cute for the occasion! fit great! the sequences did kinda catch each other when i would move my arms."
4.0,The jacket has really nice fabric and the fit was perfect.  I am having a little bit of trouble with the zipper but I think I can get the problem fixed.  If not I will just send back for a replacement
4.0,The only problem I had was the pin came out and I could have lost my keys!  However; I put it back in and turned the screwdriver very very tight.  Hopefully it stays put.
4.0,Extremely cute but ran a little small. My daughter wore it twice.
4.0,"I like the style of this pendant.  However, it is inexpensive costume jewelry.  From far away, it is a nice looking piece of jewelry.  Up close, it looks like its price. It is lightweight, which is nice when it is something that hangs from your neck."
4.0,"Really cute shirt and super soft. I ordered a medium, and it's a little shorter then I would like. I hang dry it so it doesn't shrink."
4.0,Nothing special but great for the price and seems to be pretty well constructed. Shipping was fast but cost as much as the cuff links.
4.0,"a little darker than I wanted, but they work fine."
4.0,Smaller  design than expected
4.0,"Great product, i use these as long shirts not dress. runs a little small."
4.0,Fine thin but looks nice enough
4.0,"Honestly the quality of the dress is not the greatest but I was on a time crunch and it looks nice! If you have a larger chest area, I would steer clear of this dress. I am a 38b, it was a little tight and I could see it being very tight on someone who is larger on that department. It does fit well, perfect on my body and flattering especially after 3 kids. I purchased a L. I'm 5'3 and 155"
4.0,"thick material, will be warm for sure.."
4.0,"I’m really happy with these pants, the colour is super cute.<br /><br />I’m a yoga instructor so I’m looking for clothing that can withstand a lot of movement without moving around.<br /><br />These are pretty good with that, I find the waistband lowers a little bit when I practice, and I find myself adjusting. It’s a risky colour if you’re looking for it to be sweat proof but I knew that before buying..<br /><br />A great align pant dupe.. Super soft, a little more compression than the aligns though.<br /><br />I’m 5’6” and 130 pounds and I got the small. It fits good but I’m curious how the medium might have fit."
4.0,I love the pattern of this shirt. It is so soft and comfortable too. I ordered an extra large but it is smaller than expected. I recommend ordering a size up.
4.0,Good quality and looked just like the photo
4.0,The dress is beautiful and very forgiving. The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because mine did not come with the tassel tie for the front.
4.0,"These are wildly comfortable & fit very well. They've only been through one wash, but if they hold up, I'll be back to buy some more."
4.0,"I would say these run small. They are also not easy to put on...we have to use a shoe horn for our little one making it a bit of a pain as she can't put them on herself.<br />They are nice for going from water to land, however."
4.0,works as expected.  seems good quality.
4.0,"I think anytime you have to search to buy a key for your car to be able to afford it is ridiculous. this key however worked perfect yet you have to have the dealer cut it and program it, some will do it for free and others will charge you $40+ dollars. Still cheaper than purchasing from the dealer as they are outragously expensive."
4.0,"This mask is incredibly, I love how it looks. I thought it'd be a darker red. But it fits well and looks so good. It's a great mask. Definitely worth the money. Might have took a little long to get to me. But what do you expect when it comes from the other side of the planet."
4.0,I like to wered it is nice
4.0,So comfy. So breathable.
4.0,The shoulder areas was a little tight. Overall good fit
4.0,Very good quality. Beyond  expectation
4.0,"Fits as expected, very cute on. Great for work. I always get compliments on this one since it is so unique"
4.0,"I LOVE THE PENDANT BECAUSE IT HAD THE ROMAN STYLE, BUT I SHALL USE A DIFFERENT CHAIN TO PUT IT AROUND MY NECK.  AS FOR THE SET OF EARRINGS THEY ARE CROOKED--AS FOR ME, I WON'T WEAR THE EARRINGS"
4.0,"I thought this was going to be one of those cheap Chinese junk trinkets that don't really hold up and just look super cheap and awkward - but it's actually pretty shiny and clean looking. Maybe I just got super lucky but it's actually not that bad at all for the price, although there's some other ones without the butterflies that look cute too."
4.0,Love these undershirts for everyday wear. Only complaint is that they could be a bit longer. I have a short torso and they ride up pretty easily. Fit true to size otherwise.
4.0,"I absolutely love these pants. They are long, in both the legs and the torso so that can be a bit of an issue. I actually bought a size down and had that issue. They will also pill very quickly, so that's another downside. However they are super soft, and very comfortable. I love the waistband and they do provide some support in the tummy area. I love these pants, but i do wish they weren't as long, and that they come in different colors. I also got them for a great price (im thinking they were und $ten.)"
4.0,"These leggings feel soooooo soft and look great.  I especially like the cuffs.  The fit is pretty perfect (5'8&#34;, 150lbs) so the large was right on.  I love them but wish the color wasn't so dark blue with orange thread.  A lighter blue would have been better for me."
4.0,"I thought this was the Lauren wallet when I ordered it.  But I was incorrect.  I still like the wallet, but it is not as roomy as I was expecting."
4.0,This is super cute and is a great price. I love the fold over hands & feet to protect baby from cold & wetness. I am glad I ordered A size 18m although my baby is 12m because this product runs small.
4.0,Super cute shirt. My daughter loves it! She's 7 but weighs about 70 lbs or so. She's tall and little chubby. She wears size 10 normally. This is size 13-14 and fit well with leggings.
4.0,I got a much bigger one than I usually wear b/c of the reviews and the fact I like roomy arms. Wore this to school today and stayed warm when AC was blasting but cool enough to keep it on all day comfortably. I will update if it doesn’t hold up in the wash. The coral color is lovely.
4.0,"From the photos it's hard to tell that these are actually sock like material, because it looks like a knitted item, but they are so soft and I really like them. They don't stay up very well, though, and the red rolls down, but still cute"
4.0,"I like big aviator sunglasses and these are larger than normal sized glasses but I am not sure they qualify as truly oversized. They do block the sun well and they are lightweight which I like, I like the color of the frames but I wish the lens was a mirrored color or had more of a reflective color because these kind of look like the prescription glasses people wear that turn into sunglasses when they go into the sun. Other than that I do like them."
4.0,"Fit my 6 year old perfectly, quite small for my 9 year old - definitely wouldn't work for a 12 year old.  But they are very cute and comfortable for my younger daughter."
4.0,It wasn’t bad. Worked for me
4.0,"Very nicely designed, attractive and gift box is great. The extra dials are easily operated and work well. The dial is a little small and the hands and numbers do not glow in the dark as one would expect. Also the band is very short so be careful if you have large wrists this watch may not be a choice for you. Overall, for the price this is a good product and I would recommend it."
4.0,I have applied these eyeglass holders to my sunglasses and everyday reading glasses.<br />They are very comfortable and I find them useful for casual glasses.
4.0,"I love Polki diamonds because of their beautiful glow, especially the blue ones. These earrings are pretty but the photo is a bit deceiving. They look larger than they actually are but I’m still happy to have them."
4.0,Nice look and feel.  Soft and lays just right.  Fast service too.
4.0,Walking and working out
4.0,I bought it for my brother and he loves it.
4.0,One of my top was missing off the clear containers but overall great product
4.0,Size fits and jacket is everything I needed.
4.0,"its well made although I do intent to put in<br />on a beaded piece.  It was larger than I thought it<br />would be, but that is a good thing for me"
4.0,"I have had the shoe for about two months, so far I have liked it a lot. The only thing is it has started wearing out rather fast but what can you expect from a shoe that doesn’t cost much money"
4.0,Really pretty dress. Tight on chest  but I'm 34DDDD so no surprise.
4.0,Wanted to try the jumpsuit look at an affordable price. This jumpsuit does the job. It is comfortable and be dressed up or down. It is easy to get in and out of.
4.0,***************UPDATE***************<br />This pack has turned out to be junk.  I used it no less than a dozen times out in the field and the zippers are breaking - the snaps don't hold - the straps slide out fo the clips and hooks - and the removable packs on the die and front don't stay attached.  i was hopeful about this pack and even liked it at first.  But not anymore.  Pour quality showed itself pretty quick.<br /><br />****Old Review****<br />I like this pack because of the multiple compartments and the ability to remove some of the outer packs.  I use this for hunting and I carry a lot of stuff.  I also am a videographer and it holds all of my video gear.  My only problem is with the straps.  they are too short.  I have heavy clothes on and it is tight when I put it on.
4.0,High quality long sleeve t-shirt. The material is thicker than regular t-shirt.
4.0,"good fit , fast delivery"
4.0,"This is a very comfortable jumpsuit, I’m 5”2 130 . Fit is good. The top is a little strange, but probably not if you have a smaller chest."
4.0,i am a chinese man，6 feet and 185lb，it's a little bit large for me，but the quality is good，warm and soft. like it！
4.0,"Small but the sparkle shows them off!  A nice pair of everyday, go anywhere earrings"
4.0,Great for the price. The crown is a bit larger than I like but still nice for the money. I would not spend money on the sweat band. Seems unstable and will fall off plus with the extra money you spend on it you can buy another hat.
4.0,These look just like they do in pics. Work good. Don't leave gunk on your ears like cheap jewelry does.
4.0,Good quality and stays on well. My daughter is small for an 8 month old and her toes are at the end. They are a little smaller than expected but will work for what we needed them for. The width is perfect.
4.0,"Got this as a present for my wife, but she found it too flashy for her. It is very reflective and rather large on the wrist. Looks very stylish and classy, but make sure whoever you buy it for is interested in somewhat flashy-looking things. Would work great for a fancy party or night out; not probably an everyday wear type of thing. Gave it to my mom instead and she liked it a lot."
4.0,Cute. Sits crooked so had to bend it to sit on my nose. I love the colors and different shapes
4.0,Wears out quickly with frequent wear. A tad on the small side.
4.0,Got these for my grandmother and she liked them alot. The only issue we had was that they roll down the calf some while wearing. She fixed that by tightening the top a but with a needle and thread.  All in all a good buy.
4.0,"Cute.. Not for everyday wear, not the best quality but good on occasion"
4.0,Socks run small
4.0,"After reading review after review, I ordered Asian 3XL for my husband who is 5'11"", 190lbs. I had to return it because it was so big, and I ordered smaller size Asian XXL which is about an inch smaller than the former mistake. Still too big!! Now I order US Medium, finger crossed! I hope it will be right size this time.This coat looks better when wear fitted instead of loose."
4.0,"Great price for its purpose (Santa rampage bike ride w lots of drinking) inexpensive but still soft and fuzzy.<br />Looked nice but didn’t break the bank! The only thing I didn’t like was that the red color bleed somewhat on to some of the white areas. But again this wasn’t an expensive outfit. It was helpful that this outfit came w hat, shawl, belt, white cuffed “boots” (that go over your own shoes) all together so I didn’t have to shop for those items also. Get a petticoat if you want the skirt to “poof out” nicely. I’m a medium normally and it fit fine"
4.0,Were a tad on the smaller side but still good.
4.0,Very pretty.  I will use this pin as a center piece on a dress rather than using a bling belt.
4.0,"I used this dress for my Rowena Ravenclaw cosplay and it was an absolute hit! I highly highly recommend getting a custom fit gown , I’m really glad I did! It fit very well the only complaint I had is that it doesn’t allow for much lifting of your arms . I was worried it was going to be heavy and hot but, It’s extremely lightweight and light material , but it’s a little bit see through as well just be mindful. Overall it’s an amazing dress and I absolutely loved it! I very highly recommend this dress!"
4.0,"Love it , the look I wanted"
4.0,I know there are measurements but it’s smaller then I expected. Kind of feels fragile but it’s so cute! I keep it in my car with spare change! Does the job
4.0,Poor quality dress but I expected that.  Price is right.  I got them for my daughter and her friend for Halloween. She is 11 years old wears a women's medium. They dressed up as the REDRUM girls from the movie the Shining with Jack Nicholas.  They poured homemade fake blood all over them to simulate the murders.  Very cool very creepy.  4 Stars not 5 because of the quality of the material.
4.0,My husband says they're ok.  I bought them to help with chafing but they don't go quite up into the crotch area. Like the seem meets just below his jewels. So they don't necessary help him like I want.  But he looks great in them!
4.0,Small strip of elastic in the back makes for an excellent fit. Love it - it has just a little shiny bling on the bow. Really cute!
4.0,Dress came fast and way before estimated delivery date.  It is spandex material. I am 117lbs and 5'4 and ordered a small. I would say the dress is a bit loose on the hips and arms but not terrible.
4.0,"Great dress for the price! I am 5'6&#34; & 165; I ordered the large based on another reviewers recommendation saying she was my height/weight. While the dress fits just fine, I should have probably gotten the medium since the dress isn't nearly as clingy as others described.<br /><br />Aside from that, the only actual con I have with the dress is the cut of the top is so plain and doesn't fit real well (maybe my size issue caused this). In a mirror, it looks like a really casual, loose tank top cut. I will still wear the dress, but it was too casual for a wedding like I had purchased it for."
4.0,Very solid and attractive band.  A bit heavy.  Looks like it will hold up to wear.  We will see.
4.0,This watch is substantial and has the appearance of a much more expensive device. Certainly much nicer than the $22 price tag would suggest. I first saw this watch on a web site advertised on Facebook for $100. It comes with no instructions and im not sure the 3 inner dials actually function but frankly I do not care. It keeps fairly accurate time and is just fine as a fashion watch.
4.0,"Typically I carry big bags but have found myself getting ready to go to a party or out to dinner and wishing I had a small purse to just throw a few things in and go at the very last minute so I bought this bag in brown and black.  They come with two straps, one short and one a little longer.  The short strap has a chain looking thing with the strap woven through and the longer strap is just a thin piece of (vinyl) something or other that looks pretty cheap.  The purses are small for sure so in that way exactly what I was looking for but about all that fits inside is my phone (barely), license, debit card and if I squeeze it really hard, my keys.  Once my items were in the bag I had a hard time closing it but managed to make it work.  There is a pocket inside which is a total waste of fabric because so little can actually be put in the bag you just don't need it."
4.0,Tight in the shoulders but super comfy and cute
4.0,These are just ok. Fit ok and feel good. They are a little thin.
4.0,Arrived as promised and better than I anticipated - Very classy looking.
4.0,Best But to small
4.0,Its a little short on the torso but everything else fits well. I'll just get a lace spaghetti top to wear under.
4.0,"I got these for a 60's theme party and received lots of compliments.  I wore them while barefoot indoors, but due to very hot concrete outside I had to put on shoes and they were perfectly comfortable while wearing with flip-flops.  I think I will get more use out of these and will wear them at the beach as well."
4.0,Great set of pins! good quality and colors
4.0,"I bought this for my nephew's wedding , I got a lot of compliments on the dress"
4.0,"Hats are a little stiff and not as slouchy as I would want, but it's still a hat. A wash and a stretch should help loosen it up.. Looks like the picture and the color is spot on."
4.0,I love all the colors and designs.
4.0,Runs bigger in size than I thought
4.0,"I received this product for a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of the product. I was in no way compensated to give a positive review for these tie clips.<br />I purchased these tie clips for my husband. He wears a dress shirt and tie to work everyday.<br />The tie clips came in a nice little felt bag. It was a good presentation of the product.<br />The clips look very nice, and I like the different colors that the clips come in.<br />My husbands only complaint was that the clips are on the short side, and dont hold his ties as well. These clips would work very well on the skinny ties.<br />If anything changes about the product after using it for a longer period of time I will update my review as necessary."
4.0,"All in all, this is perfect for my Medusa costume!  The bands need to be adjusted, but that's fairly easy to accommodate!"
4.0,"Got these for my son and his girlfriend, they really like them"
4.0,Great pair to wear around the house. Pockets make things convenient.
4.0,"The material for the sleeves would be nicer if it was a brushed cotton, but it is a polyester feeling fabric. Doesn't detract from the cuteness of the shirt and it fit very well. Just would have preferred the sleeves to be softer."
4.0,Sparkly worth the money
4.0,MUY COMODAS
4.0,"I bought these earrings to go with a neclace I ordered also.  They matched very well.  These earrings look even better in person.  They are not too heavy, but they are a little heavier than they would seem in the photo.  They are very nice.  I think they are a good deal."
4.0,I really like the design of these. The material feels like good quality and I like the lighter blue wash of the denim. But they run small. They're not uncomfortable but you lose that paper bag aesthetic to the fit so I would suggest sizing up.
4.0,"bought one of these about 4 mos. ago and, after wearing it 24/7 since i received it, it has no rust/marks/defects, still spins smoothly, and has caused only very little skin irritation (like most rings do, but not nearly as bad as rings made of cheap metal). buyers should be aware that the ring (at least the one that i received) is not as shiny, electric blue as the picture shows -- it's more of a duller, darker blue. and those black lines across the blue spinner that appear in the pic are not on the ring -- they must be a reflection of something."
4.0,"The picture of model is a little off putting but what clothing picture with a model isn’t?<br /><br />It’s basically a t-shirt dress with graphic design. I was going to assume it would be a little looser/thin material and low v neck, but it’s more of a regular t shirt feel with a shorter v neck.<br /><br />I wear a medium and ordered a medium. I would not order a size up. It doesn’t flaunt your curves like i thought it would."
4.0,Fun dress for casual use. Bright and cheerful print. Molerani brand  doesn’t disappoint!<br />I like that I can throw it on and doesn’t need much accessorizing. It can be dressed up or down.
4.0,"Mask is beautiful, just not as pictured, color looks like royal blue around  eyes and rest of mask turquoise. What I got was royal blue around eyes but a dusty blue rest of mask, not a lot of contrast like picture."
4.0,I love the shine but when I went to bend it the silver came off which is not a big deal . You need to use nylon strong pliers. I love the shine and It is difficult to form with your hands but I did it and it was fine. I love this product. Just be careful with the pliers . Use the dipping coating on your pliers so you do not take the pretty finish off. There is a lot of it and you will be amazed how many projects you can do with this long slinky. Wow!
4.0,Silver looked too dark.
4.0,"For husband's glasses. He kept dropping them. but did not want a holder that would hang down his neck. He uses them successfully, but feels the strap is too wide."
4.0,I'm a bit disappointed that the printing is on the outside of the case. We'll see how it holds up over time. Fits well and still easy to use all of the buttons.
4.0,Very cute dress!! Love the deep purple color! Fitted in shoulders/arms then flows out. A bit see through - nude underwear or slip would help
4.0,Advantage: Very nice breathable working shoes<br /><br />Disadvantage: Not very soft for long periods of standing.
4.0,"Super cute! Love the rainbow! Sits well, but if you have a longer face, you may want to seek an alternate"
4.0,Cute dress. Fits great material lightweight in hot heat - only problem - one pocket has huge hole in it. Did not want to hassle exchanging it so I kept it - and will have to dig out needle and thread to sew up.
4.0,Good looking belt just a bit cheaper than expected
4.0,"I was looking for a warm knit hat to give as a Christmas gift.  I worry if the texture of the knit will be soft enough. Well, my boyfriend was pleased with the comfort. You can see the the knit stretches  beyond a 12 inch ruler. It does fit an adult size. He can layer it underneath his hoodie. Also can be use with mask as well.<br />The cost didn't break my wallet.  💰👜"
4.0,Raises up throughout the day.  I have top keep pulling down.
4.0,Purchased for homecoming dance and she received a lot of compliments.
4.0,nice quality and design a little bit big
4.0,"I liked the dress it just did not fit.  The sizing runs very small (2-3 sizes).<br /><br />I was contacted by their customer service, they offered to replace the top in a bigger size.  I did not realize this is not a dress but a top!! my bad.  The leggin top is very nice and if I were a bit taller and a little slimmer it would fit great. Very nice top."
4.0,Very cute socks but they fit my 3’-5” daughter like thigh high socks. I just scrunched them down a bit and they looked perfect with boots!
4.0,Fits great. Very poofy.
4.0,Very pretty dress. I wish it would have fit but it was to big bust area. I returned it. Would have exchanged it but the sizing didn't allow me to. Bummer. Get size that fits you yes I would recommend this dress.
4.0,"This dress is exactly as expected. The fabric is more rayon-like than linen-like. I bought a slightly larger size so as to look like the model, but I'm 5'1&#34; and the 4 would have been a &#34;perfect&#34; fit. Overall, a nice peasant-type dress for bohemian chicks."
4.0,Pretty and came super fast
4.0,The skirt is fine.
4.0,They are little big on my hands.
4.0,"beautiful, good quality dress, fabric is pretty looks just like the picture. just arrived to late loved this dress looks just like the picute other people sell this dress for over 100 dolloars worth the money an looks goon on im 5&#34;4 155 36c n i ordered a medium"
4.0,Okay shoe to wear for your costume but not comfortable.
4.0,It's a little smaller than my head but I still like it and wore it to sleep last night. Kept my head a tad too warm so switched back to my eye mask. But still cute when playing hide and seek with my pup :)
4.0,"It was a gift for a teenager and since she loves jewelry especially from other countries, she really liked it. It seems to be well made."
4.0,"I bought this bracelet for my niece to give her Grandma aka Nana for a Mother's Day gift. I was hesitate to order this based on the price. I was expecting the bracelet to look cheap, be poorly made or fall apart. I didn't want her to waste her hard earned money. I admit, I am presently surprised. The bracelet is adorable! It doesn't look cheap at all. I personally wouldn't gift the item, but I think it's a perfect gift for a child or young adult to give their nana."
4.0,Good size and quality for an everyday commuter bag. Light weight.
4.0,"Love these frames, they are super cute and comfortable. I bought another pair to turn into prescription sunglasses."
4.0,"Overall this feels like a very solid tank top. I have been working out for a couple of years now, so I'm starting to get a bit more comfortable in my own skin and am now okay with wearing more revealing clothes. With this said, when I saw this tank top on Amazon, it seemed like it could serve me well, so I ordered it.<br /><br />So far, this tank top is great. It fits me well (true to size), it looks good, and it also does not have annoying tags touching the back of your neck. Not to mention, it is also pretty soft by comparison to some of my other shirts and is made of 95% polyester / 5% spandex.<br /><br />So far, it has been slightly itchy (not bad, but still noticeable), so it could use a couple of washes to break it in more. I think that for the price, this is a pretty good tank top and deserves 4 stars; if it didn't itch at all, I'd give it 5 stars."
4.0,"I planned on wearing these but had to pass them down to my 12yr old.  I'm 5'9 and these come above my ankles.  The material is nice and warm and she loves them, so I've won in her eyes.  Very cute, too.  I think if you are taller than 5'5 they'll be too short.  They are definitely not thin."
4.0,Super cute pendant!!! Not so cute chain. The chain turned black after 2 days of wearing it. So far so good with the dolphin!
4.0,Wore to wedding. Beautiful
4.0,"Lenses fit into frames perfect, they are quite dark even in bright sunlight. The real issue is when I look to the left with these glasses everything becomes distorted and blurry, it's only the left lens, looking straight ahead or to the right is fine, but this distortion makes it difficult/dangerous to drive. Will be returning and maybe trying a different lens/shade. They do seem like quality lenses, hopefully it's just mine.<br /><br />*UPDATE*... I requested a return of these lenses through Amazon. Fuse contacted me with in hours, giving me different options. They replaced the lenses, the new ones arrived in about a week, and they work perfect. The other lenses must have been defective, these are crisp and clear. No issues. Would buy again and deal with Fuse in the future."
4.0,These run about a half size small
4.0,"Somewhat bigger than expected. I knew it'd be a little stiff when new, and it was. I guess my feet are not straight as the left one kept sliding off to the side. Ah, well, it was cheap. Another useless piece from Amazon..."
4.0,"It is lovely, but a little small."
4.0,"I like the keychains and the stickers are nice, but some of the colors of the stickers are inaccurate to their in-game art. Most of them are okay though."
4.0,Looks so much better in person. Had a terrible odor i had to let it air out for a couple of days smelled like feet. I had to let it air out tor a couple of days. Was a little big but my princess was beautiful on my wedding day.
4.0,But is beautiful! !
4.0,Work well but can't be stainless steel because they did not stick to the magnet I wanted to keep them on.
4.0,Toe enclosure a bit narrow.  Quality shoe.
4.0,it fits kinda a weird. the cups are a little big but that could be because I got the wrong cup size.
4.0,Runs slightly big. A very unisex sized shirt. Casual and comfortable
4.0,"great fix for boot shafts that fall over and u can store them easily when not in use, i bought two pairs, u definitely need several pairs"
4.0,"This dress is really cute and was great for the price. Was made small for the size, which I had read before I purchased it... but the larger size cost a little more so I knew what I was buying (a shirt, I basically got a cute shirt it’s so short). But this is really just as cute as the picture!"
4.0,Super cute! I received many compliments on this dress.<br />The only downside is that the white top IS SEE THRU! Beware! I was able to add another layer of lining and it's perfect now!
4.0,"Not bad...a little thin, but gets the job done!"
4.0,"Very cute, even for an older woman like myself (50+)."
4.0,"Super cute, good for the price, and thick. I ordered some for my 3 month old and they are a little too big for now, otherwise they are perfect."
4.0,"She liked the color and space. Apparently, it is a very spacious bag. This is faux leather. I ned 2 more words for this review."
4.0,"I received my order, however, I only received 47 key fobs, not 50 as listed. It seems like this is a common occurence based on the reviews.<br /><br />The key fob sets did come ready for use."
4.0,I like these socks. Perfect thickness. Little bit too long but that’s not a bad thing. Feet feel good running and lifting in them
4.0,"Very cute, but was too small....determined up lose lbs so will not send back. Keep in mind it's sheet"
4.0,looks nothing like the picture but it fit nonetheless - rather flimsy
4.0,Good product.  Had to wait longer than expected due to shipping from China
4.0,Su precio exelente el calzado muy acojedor estoy esperando el invierno para usarlo Inter diario o cuando lo amerite el de mi esposa lo regrese muy grande
4.0,did not get the size I expected I ordered an XL and got an L but it fits okay
4.0,"They actually fit my daughter's narrow feet!  She has narrow feet and really narrow heels --- very difficult to fit shoes on her.  These shoes were actually still a little wide on her, but close enough. They look good on her and stay on her feet.  Gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because they are somewhat plain, but I'm just happy they fit my daughter's narrow feet well enough.  They are also good quality and have a supportive sole."
4.0,The dress fits just as I had expected.  It looks just like the one pictured and I like it.  The one disappointment is the texture of the lop layer it is not as light weight as the under section.  The top layer is almost like a flannel.
4.0,Nothing great shirt
4.0,I like the size and look. I have gotten several positive comments from people.
4.0,Smaller than I expected.  Love the material. Has worn well.
4.0,"I would say this top runs small. I normally where a medium, but I ordered a large because of the type of material it is. Unfortunately, it's still a little tight in the arms right now. I'm losing weight, so it should fit just fine soon. It's a beautiful top so I can't wait to wear it."
4.0,"For my first set of chokers in, oh, 15 years I really like these.  The one with the open triangle is my favorite because both bands are a softer leather where the one with small triangle and the one with the ball have shiny bands.  The tie one is easily 4-5 ft long but leaves lots of versatility in wear."
4.0,I'm 5'7 and120 lbs purchased a small. I do wear a tank underneath and a slip. Dress is cute and very comfortable
4.0,Beautiful! This is the second time I purchased them. The clasps aren't very sturdy and my 4 yr old daughter already lost one earring while taking her sweater off. So I re-purchased another pair but also got special clasps that lock the earrings in place. Some reviewers complain about the odd shapes but real pearls wouldn't be completely round anyways. These are perfect but a lot bigger than expected.
4.0,I’m a 34C and usually a large in sports bras.  I’m a runner so I need support and compression.  This one fits a little more snug than I’m use to but not bad at all.  Still comfortable enough.  May want to size up.
4.0,Loose shape a bit but for $5 wore twice hot money worth
4.0,I unscrewed the metal part that pops in the hole to secure it and switched it where loop can hold the end down.
4.0,"Just received the item today and it was much wider than I was expecting. It has plenty of room inside and is pretty much what I wanted. I just wanted something lightweight, roomy, and easy to wipe down. It does have a strange smell inside but hopefully that goes away."
4.0,"The dress is adorable, my granddaughter will love it!"
4.0,it's very clear to see through and easy to clip on.
4.0,"Nice Dress, Accurate Product Description"
4.0,"they will do. super cheap, don't expect them to last super long. but, sturdy enough for what they bought for."
4.0,"Quedan muy lindas puestas. 100 algodón, suave textura. El elástico no muy buena calidad."
4.0,"The mask is nice and thin. It has a pocket for a filter<br />I got a large size and it fits a little too big. I cannot get it to sit right.  It either opens up on the bottom or rides high up beneath my eyes. I think i have a larger face and these masks are too big for me.<br />The regular size filter seems to be too small for this mask.<br />The mask did not come with any instructions or indications of how to wear.  I tried it every which way but anyway I put it on, it was too big. I think I definitely should have gotten the Medium size, I think it would have fitted better.<br />I think I prefer the elastic bands over these ties, they kept slipping and getting loose."
4.0,"These glass look sharp. They are a decent pair of shades for what you pay for. I do like the fact that they are Polarized because that makes a huge difference in a pair of shades. They came in a nice case too for storeing them when not in use. The nose pieces are nice too since most newer shades do not have them. Overall its a great product and i would recommend it. I did receive this product at a discount for an honest unbiased review. I always test every product thoroughly prior to writing a review. I write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative.I was not paid to write this review nor asked to give a good review. This is my honest opinion of the product."
4.0,This was a nice outfit for my son to wear on Christmas Day while opening his presents. The only negative is that it runs a bit on the small side. Not sure if he will ever be able to wear it again. Buy a larger size than you would normally buy.
4.0,Cute for Christmas.
4.0,"Soft, sized as expected. Not bad quality for the low price."
4.0,not as shiny as i thought it would be. kinda dull looking.
4.0,Just what my Grand Daughter needed
4.0,Ordered two styles of shoulder pads and like both.  They appear to be well made and should last a long time.
4.0,"Did not come with the additional filter as mentioned. Mesh is not safe on its own you need the replaceable grey filter insert which is fine.<br /><br />Nose clamp, ear loops, and velcro straps are all good though. The mesh keeps the filter material in place on my face. These are great for exercising but I would not use this as a daily in a crowded environment."
4.0,Heavy pendant! Great thickness to the chain and length to hold the weight of the pendant. Gave it 4 stars because the chain pinches a lil but I have sensitive skin. May not be an issue for other buyers. I feel with daily wear it will mold/smooth out.
4.0,Very nice for the price. The material is light and flowy. My only complaint is that it wrinkles a bit. But I do really enjoy wearing it.
4.0,"My granddaughter loves these boots.  I, on the other hand, think they smell.  I know they are plastic, but the odor of the plastic is very strong.  I keep them on the back porch for that reason."
4.0,It was a great gift for my lil sis
4.0,"Nice robe but too big.  I'm 5'4&#34; and not skinny, and the small/medium was MASSIVELY large and long on me. Had to return."
4.0,"A very good looking product, but the back band is very tight so put an extender on the hook side.  Wish there were more colors available.  It washes well and is comfortable, seems to me to be made just as well as Maidenform bras but Jeteway brand has slightly thicker cup padding."
4.0,Cute top. A little itchy but I’m overly sensitive.
4.0,"I really love the shirt, but wish I had gotten a size smaller...I wanted it for a specific event, so I washed and wore it anyway...(ironing is VERY CUMBERSOME).<br />If it were a size smaller, it would be 5 stars."
4.0,Very comfortable nice feel
4.0,There are duplicates im these but not as bad as I would have thought. There is about 2 of each charm. I bought them for charm tarot reading and I am quite happy with them!
4.0,I have only worn these socks once so I cannot up the review to 5 stars. Very soft and cushiony which is what I was looking for.
4.0,Super soft & comfy. Fits a little on the bigger side. I’m 5’3 weigh 154
4.0,"I am 5'2"" & 125lbs. I have a very large chest (34DDD plus cup size) & literally no butt! Finding anything in a 1 piece body is very rare. I wear thin leggings & long sleeve top to get in & out of wetsuits easier. I got size 8 when I would normally buy a 8/10 or M/L top & 3/4 or S/M bottom. This wetsuit fits snugly in the lower, then I pull the zipper up about 2/3 inches, & I'm able to zip myself easily without needing assistanc or feeling crushed. I'm pleased with the fit & it's also great under a 10mm suit for additional warmth in cold water"
4.0,"Very comfortable, nice look"
4.0,Perfect for costumes but not the same quality as normal ties
4.0,"I like the product, but I thought the string would be a little stronger."
4.0,"Mu sister loved this bag! It was a gift for her. She likes owls a lot. :) build pretty durable, I wouldn't use it if you are super hard on travel bags though. Its great for lugging stuff in your car or for your children and such."
4.0,"Another great dress!  I never thought I would find anything to fit me properly for summer dresses, but this is a great little dress just to run errands in or out with the girls.  The only thing about this is if you are tall, this will be very short on you as I am only 5'2"" and this was just a bit short for me."
4.0,Love it! Get compliments when I wear it. I just wish it was a little longer. I'm 5'9&#34; and it barely reaches my ankles.
4.0,"I have been a Harvey fan from way back. Love seatbelt bags. BUT THIS PURSE STRAPS AT THE TOP ARE LOOSE, NOT TACKED DOWN IN PLACE"
4.0,"The sweater fits perfectly and is very flattering. However, I had to sew on all 3 buttons! The fell off when I unbuttoned the sweater to put it on."
4.0,nice  deal
4.0,daughter wears it all the time and no real tarnish to speak of.
4.0,Hubby luvs this ring!! Bothers me cause I can see the seem wear the false wood connects as a circle.
4.0,Cute top. Sleeves fit tight with a boxy body. Cute with black leggings
4.0,Love these. They're warm too (:
4.0,Great shorts but no pockets.
4.0,My daughter loves them. They have held up. Except the flowers on top tend to fall off.
4.0,"Did not fit well around my arms, too small."
4.0,"I like the soft feel and colors of these bands. I have an Apple Watch series 7, 41MM, and ordered the 42/44mm sm/med, thinking they would be the right size. The bands fit well except for the very corners which I trimmed with a pair of scissors so they didn’t extend beyond the watch frame. Otherwise identical to the sports band that came with my watch."
4.0,A christmas gift my daughter bought for herself it shipped when it was supposed to and she was very happy with it
4.0,"I really love this dress, I have about five different colors. I will say the white dress with flowers is see-through. Also if you have big boobs do not get the black dress or the black dress with flowers. I’m an A cup and it almost stretches out too much in the chest area to see through."
4.0,Smaller than i thought. Quality is great though. Fits on Pandora bracelet.
4.0,Very nice set of earrings for a cheap price!
4.0,"These earrings were very beautiful. I loved how delicate and minimalist they were.  I ended up returning them because they were not comfortable sleeping in and I wanted a piece a never had to take off. Otherwise, very beautiful."
4.0,"XL fits a size 14, plenty of space for breasts. Very cute, good length a little see through, but very nice. Adjustable straps."
4.0,The quality and style is great but you have to really go up on sizing as it’s a little snug.
4.0,my elderly mother uses the socks and loves the ease of the zipper
4.0,"Smells plasticy, otherwise 5 stars as a perfect carry on bag.  Just used it for a long trip for all the necessities for myself and two kids and it stood up by itself, fit under the seat in front of me for easy access to snacks and phone chargers.  New version coming soon, so this review won't be relevant for long, but newer should be better (phone pocket on this version is tiny! No way to fit an iPhone 7plus lol)"
4.0,I liked it as did my god daughter.... its not as thick as expected. Still good though!
4.0,Flowy. Cute. Simple. Stretchy. Happy.
4.0,"I bought her camo one's, she hates camo but looks super delicious, home use only I guess. Still a win for me. She liked the design and feel. Ordered a black pair. My wife wears 8-10 jeans, the mediums work great."
4.0,Everything I have on it’s from Amazon except for my jeans This sweater does shed but over all Its cute
4.0,"Real cute, true to size just wish it were a little longer. I’m 5’9” tall and have to wear shorts under it."
4.0,Great product I couldn't ask for anything more for the price. I love the fit and feel of the Due rag and the Cap.
4.0,Cute for the holidays
4.0,"it is a little small when I wear it like a hat, I imagine it might stretch out a bit with time. I love the color and the snug fit actually keeps my glasses in place."
4.0,It’s a great shirt. The only reason I took a star is because it runs small so the xl shirt I ordered because that is my husband’s size had to be returned. I got him an xxl and that one fit him. Definitely get this shirt if your a Kong/Godzilla fan just go up a size and avoid having to stand in the long Amazon return line at kohl’s.
4.0,"I really like these socks. The material is really nice, I like the style & the colors are great. My objection is they are to small, they used the least amount of material possible to make them. Therefore, there is really not enough toe room.<br /><br />Am changing from 3 to 4 stars. Was contacted and told they will improve their product using my suggestion. This is above & beyond-I really appreciate their commitment to customer service and am adjusting my review. As I stated above great material, beautiful colors & with improvement in sizing they will be perfect."
4.0,"I have HUGE calves and rarely find nice-looking boots that fit my legs, even those advertised as wide or extra-wide calf. These fit. I've just received them, so can't say much about their durability, but they look wonderful. The top is like a neoprene sock that hugs the leg. I didn't give five stars because the top worked its way down a bit, creating little rolls at my ankles. That's not a deal-breaker, but it does make them not quite five-star worthy."
4.0,"Have purchsed this size in the past in white and felt these were a bit smaller, but they are compression shirts so just a bit more compressed .  I started wearing these instead of cotton undershirts, have a few colors and like the three pack.  They last longer, are more comfortable , and feel better in warm temperatures than cotton ever has.  I have long sleeve ones I use for working out, I wear these daily though. If you are used to wearing compression shirts, the size guide is pretty accurate.  If you aren't you might go one size higher than the reccomneded ."
4.0,Works great after you glue the pieces to the stick pads. I would of given a 5 star if I did not have to restick them to the bases
4.0,Not the highest quality but for the price it is perfect and I don't think you could beat it!  Looks great on!
4.0,"Arrived in time for Chrismas and was liked be the recipient. Thin material which is hard to determine from the picture but seems to be the fashion. Would use this seller again, no question."
4.0,Just as the appeared and are comfortable.
4.0,"Fit was exactly what I ordered.  It is not a heavy jacket, works good in spring and fall."
4.0,"It is very pretty, however it is very tight. Smaller than I expected for a 3x"
4.0,"The product arrived in time and the rings are lightweight and cute, I like them. The reason why I will rate this product only with 3 stars is because of this: the package I have received contained  just TWO pairs of studs, instead of three and they don't even have that small pin head you can see in the description pictures to prevent ot from falling off your nose,  it's just the straight stud."
4.0,I am a petite woman and love a smaller bag.  This is great for casual use; very durable and surprisingly very roomy without being bulky and big.
4.0,"The sunglass is very cool. It is perfect to protect my eyes against the sun lights, when I driving my car, and bicycle. It came together with a sweet glass bag. Maybe the price could be a bit lover, but overall it is a good product. Thank You"
4.0,"Nice little piece for the price.  If you're looking for something to wear every day and not have to worry about, I would recommend :)"
4.0,"I ordered this dress because I was looking for something a bit fancier to wear for a date night and this turned out to be the perfect choice.<br /><br />It's much nicer in person than the photos show, and the sequins and lace top gives it just the right amount of pizzazz. I followed the sizing chart and I would say that this runs true to size in my opinion. I have olive skin and can get quite tan in the summertime, so for me the nude illusion lace was a bit too pale and looked funny against my skin so I ended up cutting it off and thought it made the dress look much better on me.<br /><br />As far as the length, it came about an inch above my knees and fit very well. The fabric does have some stretch to it, I have large hips and had no issues with the bottom of the dress fitting me. Overall, this is definitely one of my new favorite dresses!"
4.0,"Great customer service and a great heel!  Pretty in several patterns.  Well made and sturdy but Oh so high heel!  Seem true to size and comfy it you size up to insert foot pads, which you need cause the foot beds are somewhat hard and the high angle will hurt your foot if you don't.  If you are GOOD at walking in high heels, go up a 1/2 size and get gel inserts and you will be styling and get many compliments in these gorgeous and well made heels!"
4.0,I have a belly that I always like to hide with my clothes. This blouse did its job. I like it that it was delivered to me. I want my top to be unique or I won’t want to see anybody else wearing same thing as mine.
4.0,☺ small fit but it works
4.0,"good quality, and no sharp edges, the threading from the balls is small so it’s a bit hard to put the balls on but oh well, still a good purchase"
4.0,"The Sock Fairies love the bright colors, I think we only have one or two pairs left."
4.0,"Heck, they are socks. Worked just fine. Not sure I felt any difference because of the copper to be honest. But I needed some new socks and they worked great. Just being honest...."
4.0,"I ordered a size larger than I needed and it does fit me pretty well. It is still kind of tight though. It really does look like Ladybug's costume though, and the accessories it comes with are great!"
4.0,"Love the fit in the body but it's a tiny bit shorter than where I like this style of dress to fall on me. I ordered a large. I'm 5'9, 160 lbs.  The material isn't what I expected but it's nice and it makes the colors look really bright. The dress is super comfortable. I can't wait to wear it. I bought it for church but it may be a bit much for that environment."
4.0,"I love the logo. its cute. I'm normally XL, this felt a little more roomy, and longer, but that's okay, it works well with leggings :)"
4.0,Slightly different from picture but not in a cheap bad way very cute my 11 year old wore this an received compliments all day
4.0,"It's a little bigger than expected, I ordered a new one a size smaller, should be here soon."
4.0,"Beautiful dress... I wore it to a birthday party, got lots of compliments.."
4.0,Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fabric. That being said it is a little thick for a summer top. It runs a little large if I were to order again it would be a size down.
4.0,"Very warm, good for winter use"
4.0,Should have gotten smaller size. Fits a little large. Otherwise I like it
4.0,Very pretty necklace. The only thing I didn't know when I bought it was that it was shipping from China.
4.0,"Very cute necklace! I got the #nofilter one in silver. I love that it has rhinestones to add a little sparkle on the hashtag. The rest is a really polished silver. Perfect gift for a teen, since it's cute, trendy and inexpensive! I'll be giving this one to my 17-year-old cousin. She loves to post her &#34;no filt&#34; pics on instagram lol I did subtract one star because there are some areas (like between the l, t and e in filter) that I would have liked for there to be space in rather than filled with metal. But overall, I'm pretty happy with the quality of it! I think my cousin will love it!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Works fast
4.0,Belt and buckle are good quality. Buckle has positive lock and holds well.  Nice enough to wear as casual dress belt.
4.0,Buen material y precio
4.0,nice size bag love it
4.0,"This dress is so cute. I wanted a dress I could have on hand for going out to dinner, funerals or even weddings. This dress is perfect for all. I don’t know why I thought the zip back would be high enough for a normal bra? But i don’t mind wearing a stick on. Delivery was sooo fast. It was a little loose under the boobs but I am sure if you got bigger boobs it fits perfectly. 5’8 145lbs 32B ordered a small its fits nicely a little loose but better than being too tight."
4.0,"This is a lovely two-chained choker necklace. Each chain has a circle bead studded with cubic zirconia. It is attractive. The only drawback--and the reason I rated this four stars instead of 5 is that it is supposed to be 14K gold plated, but there are absolutely no markings on this to indicate or certify this. This necklace comes packaged in a nice gift box with card."
4.0,Size as advertised
4.0,La tela suave y fresca
4.0,This skirt is a great fit. There's plenty of stretch for us more ample ladies. A word of caution... the skirt fabric is a bit thin. It's not quite see-thru but it is a bit sheer.  You might want to check that your light-colored underwear isn't showing from the back.
4.0,"Really cute dress, thin material, it runs super small in chest area."
4.0,This dress was classic and fit for a classy lady.  I would've rated a 5 but one button fell off the sleeve .
4.0,Its comfy looks great no bad comments
4.0,Gorgeous but heavy.  Super great for GNO
4.0,"Beautiful top, well made, but runs small"
4.0,"It fits as expected. The lace straps can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s really cute!"
4.0,"It was helpful to use the addition piece which made the slippers much more secured. It is warm, comforty, and comfortable support. Worth the money and this slippers will last a quite few years!"
4.0,The fit is as expected. It is warm and looks great
4.0,I like these. They do their job. They definitely have the WOW factor. But I will not be purchasing anymore pairs. At ~$40 the price point is just TOO high. If these were made in America or Europe maybe I could justify the cost. But these are cheaply made and are not worthy of the price gouge.
4.0,I bought this top to match my niece for my birthday. We looked great together. Good price for the item.
4.0,Very nice quality. I like the feel no fit.
4.0,good in thick and warm
4.0,"It's great, excellent fit!"
4.0,"They are high waisted as advertised and fit like a glove. I wear them during yoga, spin and pump. I am very happy with my purchase. I also ordered them in a deep purple. They have a cute design at the bottom which I hadn't seen before. I ordered a medium, I am 5 FT short and weigh 135 lbs."
4.0,"These gloves are not good for texting. You may be able to swipe and punch an unlock code. I would not expect to text. With that being said, the gloves are very nice for the price. This is my second pair. After losing the first pair, I ordered a new pair the next day. The stitching is solid and the leather is quality. The wool lining is enough to keep your hands warm in non-freezing cold weather. If they should get wet...at least there is the wool lining. I bike with them daily in Oregon and it rains a lot. They dry quickly and will shrink to fit (as my smalls were a bit large) if you get them wet often enough and let the dry with a gentle heat upon them. Oh..and I love that they have a snap closure."
4.0,"great dress for wearing to the office. I probably could have gone a size smaller. I'm 5'4&#34;, size 6/8, 140 lbs, hour glass figure. I nonly gave it 4 stars because I wish the trim continued to the back of the dress. The back is totally plain."
4.0,"Nice skirt. I'm 5'10"", about 170lbs and size 12 pants and the Large fit just right. However, for my height it doesn't go down to my ankles; mud-calf length. Material is not and thick, however as a fabric expert I do not think this is truly 50% wool. Much more like fake wool, polyester. That's disappointing. Still thick though."
4.0,Thin materials...
4.0,"This is the only stretchy band I’ve found that actually fits the Vivoactive 4S. (Most stretchy bands don’t fit because the cutout on the end pieces isn’t deep enough to fit the lugs/“feet” on the watch that hold the pin.) It’s decently comfortable, but the white end pieces look super cheap. I would have preferred stainless ends (and ideally a light gray band) to match my light gray/stainless watch.<br /><br />Other minor issues:<br />- The end pieces wiggle around since the space between the watch’s lugs is actually more like 18.5mm, but it seems like they should stay attached.<br />- It’s much longer than I’d like, but that’s a common problem for me (5.75” wrists). As-is the end still doesn’t overlap the sensor, and I’ll probably cut it shorter.<br />- It’s a little heavier than the stock band, which isn’t ideal.<br /><br />Normally these issues would lower the rating more and I’d return it, but given the difficulty of finding a band that actually lets me wear this watch, I will probably either keep this one or return for one of the other colors (where the ends are a closer color match and shouldn’t stand out as much)."
4.0,A bit of an off smell to it when first received.  Otherwise a cute scarf.
4.0,Loved the design of the dress! It’s gorgeous! Just runs small! I’m usually an X-Large and it was extremely tight around the chest area!
4.0,"I am 5'4 170lbs, I got xl. It fits great I wish it was a lil thicker.  I will wear stretch pants under it because it's cold.. but it's ok .. I will get my daughter one"
4.0,Does the trick. 💋🤘🏼
4.0,"I love this wallet.  It is so pretty and keeps everything organized.  I gave it 4 stars because it shows that there is room for IPhone 5 and it is just a little too snug to fit a phone.  Other than that, I really love it."
4.0,Only problem was I bought the red and the lace and skirt didn't match in color too well
4.0,It a lil big in the top in the back part . However the dress is cool. Just make sure and order a size or two up . I am 5 '7 and weigh 195lb. So worth the buy .
4.0,"Was a gift and it was well received, but seems rather small, Did not fit adult female."
4.0,"Turns out it's too big for my wrist, but I still use it all the time.  It's easy to operate, easy to read, and the backlight works great."
4.0,This is replacing my old large Fly Grande bag that just wasn't large enough for my moto gear.<br />The Zulz Zeus bag is about six (measured) inches longer than my Fly Bag and 1-inch wider and 2-inches deeper.<br />There are pockets all over the place and I haven't used them all (yet). I would recommend that you put your boots in small plastic garbage bags as i think that will protect the inside from scuffs and fabric fraying over the years.
4.0,"Item arrived in time specified, it looks great, it was smaller than I expected but that is okay it still looks amazing."
4.0,"These are exactly what I wanted, unfortunately I totally destroyed them trying to get them in. I bent them so badly they look terrible so I took them out. Not the products fault, just to tiny for me to manage. I would recommend if you have small fingers and full dexterity."
4.0,"Really pretty. Although I was mistaken I thought they were much smaller than they actually are.While I can't wear these because they are too large for my haircut and such. I would have purchased them anyway because of the sun and moon motif. I also purchased the necklace set that goes with this really kind of cool for the price paid. Heavy, long, these items are not small byy any means but very nice especially considering the price. Great value for costume jewelry."
4.0,It is sturdy which I really like.  The magnetic clasp is so incredible easy.  It is the absolute easiest bracelet to clasp shut.
4.0,Good medium sized back pack. Good quality leather. Side pockets too small.
4.0,don't always like polyester clothes but this fabric seems to be pretty soft.
4.0,"Fits right, Does not dryer-shrink, Skin breathable. Only 1 con: one gotta have a good body first to look good in these LOL"
4.0,"The material is soft and silky,once you get used to wearing a thong you don't even notice these are on,except for the fact your package is contained. I would highly recommend these thongs."
4.0,"Loved the fit, pants were about 5 inches too long for my 5' 3"" frame."
4.0,Makes a good &#34;after summer&#34; sandal that can take me through winter here in the south. I especially like that they are adjustable.
4.0,"Really pretty and fits well, but the top closure doesn't work very well and doesn't want to stay closed."
4.0,Its smaller than the size in the stire
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful, but huge. No measurements were given in the description. I bought it to use as a shoulder bag (purse), but it's a tote."
4.0,"This skirt is good quality, it's comfortable and looks just like the picture.  It runs a bit small, so mine fits considerably tighter than the picture.  Because of the cut, it will move up if you try dancing in it."
4.0,This product fit exactly to the size and is thin enough to slide into my gym bag.  Would definitely recommend.
4.0,140. 5’7. DDD breast.  Fits good.  A bit tight on my breast but it feels nice.  Looks good
4.0,"The skirt is made of good material.  As far as sizing, I wear pant size 4-5 and went with a medium.  It fit, but I feel that a large would have been more comfortable."
4.0,Much nicer than I expected. It is nicely made and quite large. It is polished to a high shine and has a delicate lacy appearance when on the wrist. It is my boldest bracelet to date and I am glad that I added it to my jewelry wardrobe.
4.0,"Not packaged as nicely as when you buy it directly from charm it, but it was definitely cute and fit well on the bracelet"
4.0,"It’s comfortable, but wish waist line was a bit lower for full figure women"
4.0,"It is for future use as the style is excellent for the watch with which it will be used.  It is a bit heavy, though."
4.0,Buen diseñó
4.0,"Fabric is thicker than I expected, but not in a bad way. Very comfortable for using all day."
4.0,"I am assembling a bracelet for my daughter in law. The pink sparkly beads were a nice addition. Don't know how long the shine will last, but we will remove the beads if they get dull. I really just wanted to have some extras, to remove as she gets more meaningful ones. Quite well packaged. Delivered promptly. Thanks, Amazon!  I love Prime!"
4.0,plastic buckle works perfect. Metal one does not stay clasped
4.0,These are very comfortable. Normally I am an 8M but my right foot tend to run a little smaller so I ordered a 71/2 wide. They are a bit tight on my left foot but that’s just my feet. I like the heel length and the style is perfect for office work.
4.0,While riding less wind flow behind the lenses but they r vented just right so they don't fogg up. Thanks
4.0,"Loved it, a little bigger than I expected but it's usually hard to determine the size that works for you when ordering online. But it was great material and very comfortable. Definitely will purchase more."
4.0,doesn't stay open easily but otherwise nice
4.0,Very cute and really helps the one bad thing about them is that if you have big calves then they roll down a lot from walking.
4.0,"I purchased this for a cruise, after seeing it on a bloggers post. The green is very flattering and the fabric doesn't look cheap at all. The length is the only negative I have. I'm 5'6"", and the dress doesn't go past my ankle. So even when wearing flats or sandals, my shoes will show. It won't keep me from wearing it, but I would have preferred for my shoes not to show, as a true maxi dress does. But if you're 5'5"" or shorter, it's definitely worth getting."
4.0,"nice fabric, handy pocket but the scarf is shorter than I expected"
4.0,"It was a bit crunchy feeling, thin, but the colors pop."
4.0,Good quality.  Medium size is a bit tight for me (42&#34; chest).  I'm giving this one to my son and ordering a Large for myself.
4.0,I love this jewelry set it's very nice and it looks exactly like the picture...only problem  I ordered 5 of them an 2 came back with a few of the rine stones missing 😣😣😣
4.0,"My husband loved these, all the look of Sunday best dress pant but much more comfortable."
4.0,I gave it to my wife and she loved it.
4.0,Loved the off shoulder look and not too long
4.0,It's my favorite keychain by far，The design is very reasonable and easy to use！
4.0,Cute vacation dress 😊
4.0,"touch screen texting never worked that great, but nonetheless this is a great product."
4.0,"Looks great,  works great."
4.0,"Works well as a cover up. I've only worn a few times, but is already pilling under the arms from friction. So maybe the material isn't the best quality, but for the price I'm satisfied with it."
4.0,"Very cute dress, but the zipper is not of the highest quality."
4.0,"My lady friends like them,"
4.0,"The dress came packaged in a nice resealable bag. My initial reaction when I saw the fabric was that it seemed to be the same kind of fabric used as linings, but then when I put it on it actually drapes very well and did not appear to be overly staticy. The only problem was the length. I am 5 foot 9 inches, and this dress seems to be sized for someone approximately 6 in shorter than me. The sizing fit everywhere except for the length. I think it would fit someone who is between 5' 3"" to  5'5""  tall exactly like the picture. On me, the dress was about 5 in above my knee and the waistline was a little bit high."
4.0,Wrinkles easily and the fit is kind of boxy but I love the print and colors. Good for the price.
4.0,"The style of the jumpsuit is cute, but it is extremely big and too long. What I disliked about it is that there was no yellow in the jumpsuit at all; I ordered it because of the yellow and the color was like a tan/orange, peach or gold looking color in person, but yellow in the pictures. Had it would have had the yellow in it I would have kept it and took it to my seamstress. Overall it is cute; I wear a large but ordered a medium and it was still huge."
4.0,Very soft and light weight.  Good for Summer.
4.0,Perfect size for adult
4.0,Like this but dont love it.  Seems a little cheap but having said this I am wearing it every night
4.0,"Nice sturdy quality. Color is not as rosy as I imagined but still very shiny, smooth, and attractive. Some other commenters have said that the edges were sharp but I did not have this issue at all. I like that you can sort of bend the metal a bit to fit better even though the metal is strong, and it stays in shape once you've bent it without seeming to weaken. The shape is like the picture on the person's arm, kind of loose and bangle-like. The three bands that came with the bracelet were good quality with no metal parts, I got one black one and two pink. The box it all came in was a nice touch. The only downsides are that the bottom of the groove has a weird texture left over from tooling it, I suppose, and that the hair band comes loose from the groove a few times a day and slips off to just be on my wrist. I would have liked it if the groove was a little deeper. Overall it was what I expected and I am happy I bought it."
4.0,Seems like a well-made product. Just disappointed it can’t go in the dryer.
4.0,Excellent gloves... will bump up to five stars once I see how they wash.  The small/medium is fine for me since I do have small hands.  Not sure they can be stretched to fit medium size hands.  I doubt they would fit if your ring size is larger than a six.
4.0,"They are a bit hard for my son to get on by himself, but once they are on his hands stay dry while playing in the snow."
4.0,Product came on time in a gift box. My son bought it for his girlfriend and himself. It is a very nice product with considerable weight and size to it. I was surprised at how good of quality it was.
4.0,"They were nicely made, color and durability. Size was smaller than usual. Tight fit. Should of went up a size."
4.0,Comfy but a bit crude. It’s cute and Ok
4.0,Really like these. They're pretty small but super cute and the quality is good!
4.0,Bottom heavy girls should definitely go a size up.  Ordered a medium at 5'1&#34; and 130 lbs.  Top was perfect but the bottom was pretty snug and did not create the elegant skirt effect I was hoping for.  Material is super soft and it is comfortable to wear.
4.0,Elegant dress.
4.0,The hinges are too tight
4.0,I really like this shirt. I got one size larger because I don't like it to be too tight and It seems to be okay
4.0,"These arrived in great time, here for Christmas as I was hoping. They are pretty well made, I am fairly happy with the quality for the price. The waistband holes for the drawstring are just cut and not finished, I think they may rip out later on. I ordered an 3XL according to the fit chart (I usually wear a US size 14 or 16)  and they fit.  The rise is *really* tall, the length is *long* (did not measure but the inseam is probably 34"" at least. I like both of those features so I'm happy about that."
4.0,This assortment of leaves is really pretty. The only reason it’s not 5 stars is that there were 46 leaves not 50 that I needed.
4.0,"The quality is outstanding but the size was too small.  I ordered my first one in a small and then reordered in medium, they both came out the same size"
4.0,"My daughter loves the design and glitter but I ordered a size bigger than what my daughter normally wears and it is tight length wise. Other than that, it was exactly what we expected."
4.0,Absolutely beautiful and comfortable but runs large I got an extra large but the back part of it where your shoulder blades are is way way way way looser than what I expected I'm actually a size medium so I should have probably gone for the medium or the large
4.0,"This is a very comfortable silky robe. I got a medium as I am typically always a medium, but this does not cover my legs enough in the front due to my hips being too wide for the small (and I would not say that my hips are above average in size). I should have gotten a large as this runs small."
4.0,"The top is super cute and a perfect fit. Wasn't a fan of the high waisted bottoms, they were too small and not flattering."
4.0,The swimsuit was very cute.... But by me having wide hips and a big butt ; the bottom did not fit well!!  Too tight... But the top fit okay<br />I ordered a medium!!
4.0,"Certainly a good product for the price. The black coating shows a little sign of wear already, but that's to be expected. The band is thin, so it doesn't really work on bulkier watches, but looks great on a low profile dress watch."
4.0,"6'4"" 230lbs<br />36-38 waist<br /><br />I chose an XXL to review based on the size chart.<br />This seems about right. They stay on without using the drawstring. I could have possibly worn an XL.<br /><br />Given my height the shorts are a little shorter than I would prefer. Not too short, just a little shorter than I'm used to. The fabric has a little bit of stretch to it. I use these for the gym, so this is nice.<br /><br />I'm a little concerned about how the seams will hold up. The stitching doesn't seem great, but probably appropriate for the price point.<br /><br />The gray color is all I was offered. I would not recommend this unless you have more color to your legs than I currently do."
4.0,Love them to bad no pockets!! Think about pockets a need for Kleenex and hands!!!
4.0,Nice bonnet. It's just don't stretch enough.
4.0,Overall it's a nice skirt for the price- the waist band fits a little loose compared to the rest of the skirt which fits true to size based on their size chart. I ordered up from my usual size but it was spot on based on their sizing chart.
4.0,"Fits as it should  -but brim is wider than I had wanted  -probably wanted a &#34;bucket&#34; instead of &#34;boonie&#34;. But, it should actually do a better job of protecting my ancient skin!"
4.0,Ishould have made sure that it had a brass zipper before I placed order
4.0,Nice construction.  Extra pads.  Snazzy
4.0,"Pretty dress but not flattering on me.  For reference, I’m 5’10 36 DD 160 lbs and this fit ok"
4.0,"LOVE THE SNOOZIES, JUST IN TIME FOR A COLD SNAP."
4.0,Exactly as pictured and expected.
4.0,"I love these socks, so they have these little grip things for the thighs so they dont fall down and you cant feel them, I know the thighs are a bit thick for my size and alot of thigh highs tend to roll down because of it but i didnt have this problem. They're super comfy to wear for long periods."
4.0,Made my ear bleed a little it stopped nice earring hard trying to get it in
4.0,"My first impressions were a little odd. The shorts bag looks like the silhouette on the cover is pregnant, but I could be wrong. I attached a couple of photos of the bag to show what I am referring to. There is nothing wrong with that, of course, but at least we know better than to have a bunch of tummy-toning models. If the cover is not a pregnant lady, then I would suggest a clearer cover photo. The shorts do fit a bit big, but they have a decent amount of stretch. I am not a fan of really tight clothing anyway, so this may bother others more than it bothers me.<br />When I opened the package, the first pair had a little snag on the side seam. No big deal. The second pair was fine. The third is the one in the pictures with all the seam issues. The last pair were fine as well. The pair with the seam issues I pulled out of the pack to take the photos and do the review. I had not even tried them on yet. There are several little snags on that pair, though I have not really checked the others closely. I can just push them through my sewing machine, but I am not sure what is going on there. The last pair is the pair I tried on. They fit, but if they were any bigger, it would be a challenge to keep them on. They are barely fitting on my thighs; if they were any larger, they wouldn't hug my legs at all. The waist is larger. That is why I was wondering if these were for pregnancy. They seem to have a little extra space. Honestly, I would have loved these when I was pregnant, but these will work great under my dresses. I like to have an extra layer of coverage under my dresses since I live in the flat desert, so winds can lift a dress easily.<br />There is a different fabric texture between the legs to prevent chafing. It feels like it has a soft fuzzy layer there. There isn't a thicker or additional feeling layer, just a different texture. The fabric is nice and thin, so it breathes well and moves with bends. I have not had any issues with the top rolling down or the legs rolling or bunching. The quality seems OK, aside from the stitching issue, of course."
4.0,Great for the heat in vegas
4.0,This is a very nice vest. Material is nice and looks great for a formal event like a wedding. The color is a bit darker than we were expecting but it's a great vest.
4.0,"I like these quite a lot. They are good quality. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star review is because, for me, they are a little bit shorter than I like. I like them to be slightly longer and slightly more flared. Quick shipping and arrival. Just as described. Very nice product and works well."
4.0,The wife says that she likes them. Good enough for me.
4.0,"I purchased the pink version and I am in love! :D Love the color! Love the style! I definitely recommend getting a petticoat to go with it to really get the best effect. I also recommend something to go around the waist to make it a bit more visually interesting as it leans a little towards the plain side. The striking colors save it but accessories would just take it to the next level. I'm planning on pairing it with a corset to dress it up for fancy events. I'll probably get a wide belt for casual wear.<br /><br />I would give it five stars except for one thing. It almost fits perfect except for the fact that I'm a little busty and the distance between the buttons creates that weird gap because of my cleavage. If I went up a size, though, it would be too big. Easy fix. Just gonna get some snap on buttons to put in between the others. For reference, I am 5'4 about 160lbs with a 38D/DD chest."
4.0,It's a very cute suit. Seems well made. Sizing is difficult now days due to every company having a different sizing chart. Order a little larger than you think you are!!! Would purchase again.
4.0,Great product for the cost
4.0,"The bad: No drawstring or stoppers on the hood means that it didn't stay put, defeating the purpose. The thumb holes were way too small: I had to pop all the seams so as not to lose circulation.<br />The good: material is great, love the length, love the flip over finger covers. I absolutely love the idea of the attached rain/wind coat that's 1/2 sleeve but is removable.<br />I was ready to buy all 3 colors until I took my dog for a walk on a windy day."
4.0,Very nice and durable!
4.0,Cool shirt but runs small. I bought the xxl but fits like a xl
4.0,"cute robe, comfy"
4.0,Overall a cute dress!  I am a C cup and felt that the bust was a bit large.
4.0,"These are really nice and super comfortable. No more stabby ear posts! The color is a rich, believable turquoise and they are really engaging and eye catching when you wear them. I've received a lot of compliments and people do a double-take with this bright blue up around the eyes. Very fashion forward and edgy looking, without being harsh. Great pair of earrings! Again, shockingly comfortable!"
4.0,Nice and thick. Love that they're organic. Ran a tad small for us.
4.0,"They look way better once you put them on, just enough shine, very light weight"
4.0,Fit is nice. They Included this cute charm For my phone!
4.0,No big surprise.  Just what I needed to replace original laces.
4.0,Ike it very much.
4.0,Their fun to wear. Light weight and with all the colors they go with any and everything.
4.0,"Overall nice products. I like the butterfly the most, though there is an accidental scratch on one top (hard to see it unless get close enough). Btw, the star might be way too small. Recommend."
4.0,Great fit. Only issue is if you're going to make something rose gold make the watch clasp match also..
4.0,I love it and fits just right
4.0,"A little lighter (weight) than I hoped for, but I’m still happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Nice quality, fit well but just a little smaller than other brands. So if you're between sizes go up a size."
4.0,Haven't worn it yet. Material is different but nice. Not quite as long as id want but overall it fits comfortably.
4.0,"I have worn this twice so far, I love not having straps! very freeing"
4.0,"Fits a little snug so maybe order a size up. I won't exchange for a bigger size since I like the support it provides while exercising. Overall, it's of decent material unlike the other types of sport bras I've had, and seems like it will last me a while"
4.0,"looks great, very small size."
4.0,"I would not recommend this bra to anyone!  As most of the reviewers had recommended, I bought 1 size up.  I am a C cup and bought a D cup size.  STILL TOO SMALL!  Not comfortable, slips immediately while trying to adhere without lotion on and has ZERO support.  There's NO WAY these would hold up for an event. They couldn't even support my breasts for more than 5 seconds!  I hate them!<br /><br />*After leaving this review I was contacted by the seller.  They were understanding, kind and professional. They graciously offered to refund my money without me asking them to do. I still would not recommend this bra, but I would recommend their customer service. Very impressed with their professionalism!"
4.0,The body fit perfectly... Just around the neck was a little too tight x_X
4.0,"The quality is great, but I would recommend going one size up due to the constrictions of the material. Great pants otherwise."
4.0,Colors do not look like the picture.
4.0,"Fits like it should, and looks exactly like the picture."
4.0,"The necklace is beautiful. I had asked to have it sent gift wrapped by amazon. Will never do that again. I paid an extra $4 or most of my items to have them gift wrapped. The wrapping looked as if a toddler did it. One of them was even torn open. The wrapping looked like an afterthought that I wished I never paid for bc I had to wrap all of the items again myself. Point: don't pay for the gift wrapping, huge disappointment and waste of $$."
4.0,Soft but amazingly comfortable and firm at the same time. Durable. I've been wearing them daily since before Christmas and they're still brand new looking.
4.0,"Bought these to protect hands while putting up barb wire fence.  Was hoping they would protect hands and not be as hot as leather.  They snag on wire, so these aren’t the best for fence work."
4.0,"Adorable and I’ll wear it all the time. The only problem I had was getting the bow to stay. But I figured that out, I just don’t know how to describe the knot tying method. It was disappointing at first, when I had to re-tie the bow literally every 5 minutes. But I promise there is a way to get it to stay."
4.0,Soft material and quality
4.0,Could be maybe an inch longer.
4.0,"I like the colors and fit but don't like the material.  I have cats and if I hold them, their claws pull the material too easily."
4.0,"Really comfy, but a little small.  also kind of weird baggage in between the legs, making me feel like I have to wear it much more high-wasted."
4.0,Looks as pictured although there is no bow on the waistline
4.0,Very light and comfortable dress. Great for casual wear or as a cover up.
4.0,"Pretty good. The only thing I am disappointed in is that the closure clip pops off from time to time if I sit on it, but I have it a little more filled than recommended so it's not a big deal to me. The closure clip doesn't break, just pops off. The aluminum hasn't bent. It's pretty sturdy. Would buy again."
4.0,A little thin but the print is adorable
4.0,"It's a great pendant, very good quality! The string for the necklace was poor quality but very easy to replace."
4.0,Has just the right amount of stiffness for my taste but one had a stray thread and a snag before I took it out of the wrapper.
4.0,"Comfortable, great drape to the material. A little thin and see through."
4.0,"I like this coat A LOT. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I bought the army green color and loved it so much that I decided to buy it in black.  The black one fit slightly smaller than the army green version, so that's a bummer.  Otherwise it's a nice, stylish coat, pretty decent for the price.  I would recommend ordering your size and one size up to try on."
4.0,The earring itself is large and heavy. If you’re not used to wearing hoops and/or big earrings I would not recommend. They are however very beautiful earrings with great details. Looks just as it’s shown.
4.0,"Dress was beautiful! Got compliments all night! However, I had to get it taken in at the top as it was huge, and I didn’t like that there were extra flaps of fabric on the back of the shoulders when my arms were down. The seamstress did an amazing job fixing it though, and the dress turned out perfect."
4.0,"Nice quilted material, not overly thick or too thin. Seems to be made well and care is pretty basic. It's an open vest so you can't mess up sizing."
4.0,Smaller than expected. Still satisfied with purchase.
4.0,"This pendent is very beautiful! I love owls and this fits right in. It's very well made and the stones are so pretty. It is 2&#34; in diameter, which is bigger in person than it was in my mind. It come with a very short imitation leather type necklace. I think it's 16&#34; with a 2&#34; expansion. Considering the size of the pendent, I really think a longer chain is more appropriate. I'm going to wear it on a 22&#34; chain so it hang down farther."
4.0,Perfect size for the pendant I have.  Arrived quickly.
4.0,Nice necklace - the colors go really well together & look even better in person.  It isn't the best quality - but it's what you expect for the price (under $10).  One thing that did bug me a bit is that there's a kink in it - so it doesn't lay around the neck properly (it kinda goes out to one side) & the beads aren't heavy enough to make it lay properly.  But I think that'll go away with time...I'm sure there's a way to fix that too (it's just the plastic wire got bent at some point...not like there's an actual defect or something).  But overall happy with the item & very happy with the colors - the blue/teal makes a huge difference & looks great.
4.0,"Makes a great bag to store my husbands Rune stones in, plenty of room"
4.0,"It doesn't exactly look like the picture, but I do like it."
4.0,I absolutely loved it however the clasp is super small  ( which is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5) and I did not realize it was not latched and lost the pendant which I am super bummed about. otherwise beautiful necklace I love it
4.0,I loved this bracelet and would have given 5 stars but I had ordered 7 bracelets and one of them had a few diamonds out of place...
4.0,"Style looks great, but the clasp is kind of complicated and doesn’t stay closed very well. If you were to move your arm around very vigorously the watch may come unclasped. My boyfriend really likes it though."
4.0,"I was leery of one size fits all. I ordered a pair for both me and my mom.  I am 5'2 and 110lbs  I wear a size 2  womens dress pant and a size five juniors jeans. My mom is 5'5 and unknown weight and wears a size 14 women's pant. I ordered the same size for both of us due to the one size fits all option, a little concerned that they wouldnt fit both of us. Shockingly they did they are a little tight on my mom but still acceptable to wear. And on me they are slightly loose. But not loose loose just not tight loose, they still look good. I will definitely buy more. Only down side is they come up high on the waist (downside to me my mom liked it) I roll them down one roll so they are on my hips."
4.0,Great style but really not warm enough to be a winter jacket.
4.0,"using as a Christmas gift for someone special. she loves owls and loves Larimar since its the color of her eyes. not 100% sure if this is real larimar bc it looks nothing like the picture as far as the stone, but its still beautiful. i could have got an identical one with synthetic Larimar for way cheaper tho. this one stated it was natural larimar so i chose this one and payed the extra money. wish there was a way i could know for sure."
4.0,Added a waist belt to a backpack with these. Quite sturdy but somewhat larger than I expected. Still a good value.
4.0,Fit as expected lie the color and fabric.
4.0,"this  is  a  really  good  album  from  this  swedish  oldschool  metal  band  that  has  been  putting  out  decent  albums  the  past  10  years  now,  i  like  the  guitars  and  the  music  is  awesome  and  the  vocals  are  ok,  if  you  are  a  fan  of  ACCEPT,  UDO  OR  SAXON  for  example  you  (  i  think)  you  will  really  like  this  cd  a  lot,  the  vocalist  almost  sounds  like  udo  but  a  little  rougher  but  please  remember  ive  been  into  metal  for  about  35  years  now  and  i  dont  like  these  singers  that  growl  into  the  mic,  i  like  real  singers,  your  voice  can  be  rough  please  dont  misundertand  what  i  am  saying  as  im  a  huge  fan  of  accept  now  for  30  years  and  i  think  some  of  the  records  UDO  has  done  on  his  own  are  as  good  as  classic  1981  through  1986  accept  but  the  singer  with  this  band  is  not  growling  but  if  his  voice  was  rougher  he  would  be,  all  and  all  this  is  a  great  slab  of  music  for  people  like  me  who  rocked  out  through  the  80s  to  metal  and  want  to  check  out  a  newer  metal  band  that  does  not  sound  like  crap  as  most  do  today,  this  record  is  totally  out  of  the  80s  but  you  can  tell  it  was  recorded  recently  as  i  can  tell  digital  sound  from  analog  in  a  minute,  regardless  these  guys  from  sweden  do  there  best  to  keep  things  sounding  like  its  1982  or  1983  so  i  do  indeed  recommend  this  cd  to  fans  that  are  into  real  basic  oldschool  metal,  sounds  great  loud  so  play  loud!!!!!!!  also  you  cant  hear  him  on  this  cd  BUT  BIFF  BYFORD  makes  a  guest  apperance  and  is  thanked  in  the  credits  as  bullet  has  opened  a  lot  of  saxon  shows  the  past  10  years  in  europe..."
4.0,"These are pretty good biking and weightlifting gloves.<br /><br />The palm surface has padding at the pressure points of your grip so that even if you grasp strongly, there is no blistering.  The back of the thumb has a sweat pad for wiping your brow.  The dorsal part of the glove is very thin and quite breathable, unfortunately, the palm side does not have any breathing spots.  If you suffer from sweaty palms, these gloves will stink up quite rapidly.  The gloves have loops on the middle fingers so that you can pull them off easily which is nice.

4.0,"This skirt is so soft and beautiful. I love, love love it. The only down all is I wear a size 4 and the small was extremely tight. So I had to get a medium. Other then that this skirt is a keeper!!!!"
4.0,Bulky to wear
4.0,"I really liked this dress, it was just a tad small. I purchased a small, but med would have been too big. What a bummer!<br /><br />The design, stitching, and the overall make of the dress was really pretty!"
4.0,I bought 4 of these dresses.  Returned this one only because of the print.  Felt it was to junior for me.  This is a t-shirt material.  Good for a summer day with some flat sandals  or sneakers.
4.0,"This tote is terrific!  It is strong, has several pockets, and the sides can cinch in for a narrower lode.  The only drawback is that the straps are too short to sling over my shoulder.  It can only be carried by hand.  Otherwise it would be perfect.  I like the tote so much, I may even put longer straps on it so I can use it more."
4.0,"I really like these. They are very warm and so comfortable. The only issue is they pill badly. I wear them  under my jeans so it is not an issue for me, but if you want to wear them alone, that is an issue."
4.0,I really like them👍👍👍👏🏻
4.0,This size fit my 11 year old daughter.  It is a little thin so she felt more confident with some undergarments.
4.0,Like it!😊
4.0,They are less than $10 sunglasses.
4.0,"Not the real Blue Blockers but used them today on a cloudy rainy morning could see very clearly. Somebody gawked at me for wearing them in the rain, ignorance is bliss. Anyway, when I took them off to get out of the car I couldn't stand the sudden blaring blue light in the day. So yes, it works well enough."
4.0,Very cute! The material was super soft and my daughter was comfortable in it.
4.0,The only complaint I have is that the sizes are not the easiest to follow as there is no height included.
4.0,It's an ok watch that is hard to see at times. I wear it to work and seems to be one tough cookie
4.0,The only thing I didn't like about this dress is its SUPER low cut. If you're going out on a date night it will be a cute look but anything else it's a little too revealing for my personal taste. But the dress is super cute fits about as expected !
4.0,The shorts were a bit to big but overall it’s fine.
4.0,"The pendant is too small for me... but other than that, it's perfect."
4.0,a little thinner than I thought they would be.
4.0,These are BEAUTIFUL earrings. They are big and definitely a statement accessory. They did get a little heavy after around 3hrs. I have sensitive ears and simply coating the bood with clear polish prevented any allergic or adverse reactions. I will be wearing these for my cousins wedding in the fall and will be ordering them in different colors/finishes.
4.0,Soft metal. Bends very easily. Fun little ring.
4.0,Good quality hat with a nice design at a great price. Too bad it took just over a month to get it.
4.0,"Love the look and feel of this shirt, but I was hoping it had a bit of a looser fit to wear with leggings"
4.0,I LIKE IT I MUST HAVE LOOKED AT THE WRONG I THOUGHT IT WAS A WATCH. TRYING TO FIND A WATCH THAT WILL FIT THE BAND
4.0,Should be a little bit longer. It's to short.<br />But the material is soft.
4.0,"Very warm and comfortable as house slippers.  Slipper if on hard floor, but great for the recliner."
4.0,"Clasps were a little hard to open, but it was a beautiful necklace and I was proud to give it to my mom. Also came in a nice velvet gift box, which I was not expecting!"
4.0,I’m a medium but like my clothes to have room so I ordered a large. Fits great! Straps are elastic and the buttons actually work. It does have a slip so it’s not see threw. Would have gave it a 5star but it doesnt have pockets. Otherwise would order again!
4.0,Love them fits just right great all around
4.0,"I'm 5'9, 280lbs. On average I wear a 3X. I'm not little by any stretch of the imagination and I understand this, so, I ordered a size 5x. (Cause I know that things online tend to run small and I like extra length in the arms also so I tend to order UP anyway and thought a 5x should be nice and roomy.)<br />The sweater that came to me had a tag that said 5X but, AT THE MOST, was a MEDIUM.<br />(I'm thinking maybe the maker just made a mistake with the label on this one?)<br />Well, I contacted the seller and expected a hassle, but instead they refunded my money instantly and truly apologized about the mix up. They were VERY nice about it, so, excellent customer service, and I'm totally willing to give them the benefit of the doubt! However, The coat itself, looked just like the pic, and was actually pretty warm. Perfect for a fall day. I gave it to my daughter in law and it fit her perfectly with a little extra room. (She's regularly a medium.) I would suggest giving it a try if you like this sweater. The pic is not misleading. If anyone orders one, PLEASE let us know, if yours comes in correctly, I'll order another one. If it had fit, I would have given 5 stars."
4.0,This ring was nice but ultimately not exactly what I wanted.  I went a different route.  The good thing with these rings on amazon is you get to try them out and free returns if its not exactly what you want.
4.0,"very good quality for the price... I used for my sons Steampunk costume, spiffed it up a bit...I added a leather band,some gadgets, feather and steampunk glasses and it looked awesome! Also he has a pretty large head and thick hair so it fit perfect.... small headed people might need to add a little cushion on the inside...."
4.0,Great prices BUT watch the S&H costs. Overstock Jewelry REALLY &#34;STICKS IT TO YOU&#34;!!!
4.0,"This is a gorgeous dress. The fit is fairly true to size. I’m 5’4” and 140lbs, the medium fit a tad loose, but the small would have been too tight. The dress falls below my knee without a petticoat underneath. My only complaint is that it’s unlined and not very soft."
4.0,goes great with the boho floral skirt. button in the back is hard to fasten. Need a little help with that; hard to reach.
4.0,"This tie bar has a great form factor that adds a unique touch to my outfit.  My only issue is that I thought it would be a little larger, for the price."
4.0,"comes to my knees I'm 5'2""...but its thick and it seems to be a dress that will hold up …very warm. And looks like photo EXCEPT length. it is NOT a maxi...but its ok I still reordered because I just loved the fit and the dress as a whole... you wont be dissapointed beautiful for hour glass figure, if it were LONG it would be totally the BOMB---also runs BIG I'm 38DDD waist 29/30 hips/butt 40/41 could actually have worn a small"
4.0,"soft and comfortable, appears to have a good deal of spandex even though it states 100% cotton on tag.  it looks exactly as the product pics and I am happy with it for a slightly different looking basic T."
4.0,I received my jacket in white. I really like the design but with everyone's reviews I got a size bigger than i would normally purchase. The arms are the perfect legth but in the chest and trunk area it's a little bigger than i expected. Overall I love the jacket its what I was exactly looking for. It'll be a good layering piece. Also as other reviewers said this jacket is very thin so it's good for spring and fall seasons.
4.0,Great product for these times! Our child will wear a mask however it always slides off his nose. This helps protect him when we go out in public.
4.0,Really like the tank tops but they are not as pictured exactly. They are shorter than I thought they would be and I thought they would be a little more form fitting.
4.0,"The items are smaller than what the pictures show, but they will work for a small carry-on. They will work great with the other set I purchased from you.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE the llama design AND all the zippers work like they are supposed to.  Thank you."
4.0,Stay with your same size.. I sized up and their too big and their very roomy
4.0,I could not use most of them they took-up too much room  some of them are solid all around therefore you cannot see what is inside I did use one for underwear it was nice to have it at your fingertips
4.0,Kid doesn’t mind wearing all day at school. The wire started poking out after 1st wash so I pulled out all the wires for safety reasons.
4.0,Bought it as a birthday present for my niece.She loved it.Bo issue with watch so far.
4.0,"The shirt is cute on but the material is weird. It's like of like a thick paper/cloth. I'm keeping it because I still like it, just know it's a weird texture."
4.0,I wouldn’t necessarily call this a compression tank top.  The first set that I ordered was a double XL.  I normally fit into a large size shirt but I wanted a little bit of room in case the compression was too tight.  I tried on those first set and they were too large and fit more like a XL.  On the second order I ordered the large size even though it is recommended to order one size up.  The tank top is a good fit and does what it needs it to do but I definitely wouldn’t call it a compression shirt.  I also ordered all black based on some of the reviews and comparing them to the colored version that I ordered earlier are definitely of a thicker material.  Since I’m truly just going to use these tank tops when I work out or normal every day where as an undershirt the color wasn’t as important to me.  I believe if I ordered a ex L size which is one size up then when I normally would wear it would be too loose fitting.  I will be testing it out during workouts and normal workdays.
4.0,"Cute shirt, seemed like good quality. I did send mine back though, it was a little baggie in the arms, and I felt if I went down to the next size, it wouldn't fit in the body."
4.0,"I received this at a discount for an honest review. The watch is difficult to change, I have big stubby fingers, I am a man and got this for my wife, and that was irritating. It is perfect for the wife and this is the first watch that she has that is waterproof. It is very nice looking and dainty so it looks good on her. I like the quality of SKMEI watches, I own two myself and they are good watches. I would compare them to Weide brand watches which is a very good brand. It has a futuristic look to it and the glowing light on it is perfect because it does not make the time lighter which some watches do. This is a good price and just dressy enough to wear to work and cool enough to wear on any casual outing."
4.0,I haven't had the chance to wear it yet but I tried it on and I like the look.  It's very different from anything else that I own.
4.0,"I like the matte finish of this cord, and the diameter is perfect for a small pendant.  I wear this every day, including in the shower, and after about a month, the cord came out of the silver ends.  I used some craft glue that was suitable for nylon and metals, and it held for a few more months until that glue gave up and I had to glue it again (using the same glue.)  That was about three months ago, and it's still holding fine.<br /><br />For the price, I am happy with the quality.  If you're not wearing this every day, or in the shower, I think it will hold up just fine."
4.0,"Nice cap, made of good fabric but it fits too small. I'm gonna keep it though..."
4.0,This is a great skirt. I bought in black and gray. The black is perfect but the gray is not gray. It's actually a baby blue color which is not what I wanted. Sending it back.
4.0,Over all the fit is nice. I material is more of a spandex. I liked that the length was nice and long.
4.0,"I giived all the small items to my grand daugther good material is very cute dress .I wish this dress in a bigger size, for a179 lb.most of the time I order large on top and medium for botton bu this only fit to a girl size 5"
4.0,Excellent quality<br />Perfect for the money<br />Wonderful gift
4.0,"Fit is perfect, work pretty well and as expected."
4.0,"Nice and light weight, a little longer than I expected but it fits nice."
4.0,Beautiful! Just a bit smaller than expected.
4.0,I loved this dress. Very good material. The tan/cream color did not look good on me so I had to return it.
4.0,Real nice....small.
4.0,Cute but not large enough for my over-sized sunnies. Disappointed.
4.0,This is a very pretty and professional dress that doesn't break the bank.  I took everyone's advice and sized up.  I am 5'4 and 130 points and I bought a large and it's perfect.
4.0,"The Glamulet Santa Claus Christmas Gift Charm 925 Sterling Silver Bead is very nice, but you have to look very close to tell it is  a Santa Claus bead. It fits Pandora and looks expensive. It is a very nice bead and makes a very nice Christmas bracelet. [[ASIN:B01LCQATWE Glamulet Santa Claus Christmas Gift Charm 925 Sterling Silver Bead Fits Pandora Bracelet , Ideal for Lover Women, Mom, Wife, Girls]]"
4.0,My granddaughter loves these. I would have preferred a warmer top since she always ends up on top of her blankets.
4.0,Got them last year for my husband. They have held up well and are very comfortable.
4.0,Nice watch. I work in food services and cannot wear a wristwatch. This hooks onto the front of my apron and I am able to see and track time easily. Only drawback is that the watch is heavy and slides to the side so I still have to use my hands to move the watch face where I can read the time. Bigger than I thought which was actually a plus.
4.0,Its alright. It is what u paid for
4.0,Bought a small but too tight at the top. I am 5'5&#34; and 125lbs. Need a medium. Nice dress though and very pretty. A bit long and if I buy another I will hem it to mid<br />ankle length.
4.0,Great fit not to hot to cold ...
4.0,Very light weight and comfortable.  Came with very heavy curvature on the bill.
4.0,Its color and compartments
4.0,Love the watch seems sturdy. I have it on now for the first time haven't had any problems yet. Great price looks more expensive than what i paid. Would order more in different colors.
4.0,Outside weather
4.0,Fits good but was expecting more oversized
4.0,Very nice case - have gotten several compliments on it.  Also appreciate the prompt delivery.  Thanks.
4.0,"It is a beautiful band, but it leaves pick marks and pulled threads in all of my sweaters and scarves. A rhinestone has also come out. :("
4.0,Nice shirt cool logo fits well
4.0,"Pros: It looks good and the liner is well made with quality materials. The visor quick release really is quick! Ventilation and weight are good. Bell brand name.<br /><br />Cons: There is no nose breathing deflector to prevent the visor from fogging up. The chin strap is a traditional D ring style and not a quick release. There is another brand that offers both of these features in this price range.<br /><br />Other: I have seen reviews of similar Bell helmets where they complain that the visor is clear and not smoked as shown in the picture. It says this fact in the description, so was not a surprise to me. Would I buy again, maybe. I ordered this one because the colors matche my jacket."
4.0,"This is the perfect item to display necklaces and bracelets for small craft fairs.  I bought it for a friend after my son broke her wooden display.  She sells necklaces, bracelets, and key chains and this suits her needs wonderfully!"
4.0,I like the material and it fit great.
4.0,"A little tight at first. Need be broken in, with wear"
4.0,"It was  lightweight  weight,pretty and  the girls at work gave it lots of  complements!"
4.0,"Great shirt.  I wear XLTs, but good luck finding something you're happy with.  These shirts work. My preferred length, label to hem, is 32""+.  These are 31.5"", which is close enough.  I knocked a star off only because I find even the white hotter than some others on a hot, sunny day.  Maybe the UPF is higher, which would be a plus."
4.0,I really liked the tank tops but definitely get a size smaller.
4.0,Like that it's upf.  Need to protect from hot Texas sun.
4.0,"Kids love the look,  I love the easy on and off."
4.0,This skirt is pretty nice. It's cute with the buckle and is a good length the only problem I have is the material but other wise it's a awesome skirt
4.0,Nice casual dress for the summer.
4.0,"Its okay, its clingy, not very flattering"
4.0,"It’s not stretchy In the front, but the back is stretchy and is easy to adjust with the toggle in the back. The front has a really thin layer of terry/towel-like?material that is kind of nice in case you sweat lol. Only one star off for for me because how thin it is, but it’s overall a great product for the price and comes in lots of choices."
4.0,"Super cute and comfortable! I love the look of the different colored bands.the colors are bright.  I like to wear it with multi colored metals. It’s just the right size, not too loose or too tight."
4.0,High end quality at a bargain price......Great item.
4.0,The look and feel of the product fulfilled my expectations.. the fit? Not so much.. body-wise the fit is perfect but the sleeves are too short so I have to roll them up and pretend they're supposed to be that way :(
4.0,"This is a size M, not L."
4.0,Me gusta mucho es bien larga y los abiertos del lado ase a que no aprete
4.0,"I ordered the166 snowflake mask, my mask looked nothing like the picture, very dark colors of blue , but it’s still looks good !!"
4.0,Beautiful soft and classy! I highly recommend this dress!
4.0,Great deal on a basic style. Can’t beat it! No flaws!
4.0,I got these for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves them. They are a little bit pricey though that’s why they merit four instead of five stars.
4.0,"I am 145 pounds and 5'7 tall, and I ordered a Med so if anyone around the same size as I am, I recommend a size small because the medium looks baggy and big on me, but still warm and does the job."
4.0,Works great for keeping all of your stuff in one place.
4.0,Very cute little basic necklace. While it's a bit plain that's what makes it go with everything. The chain is a bit cheap but for the price of the necklace I think its fine :)
4.0,"Good quality and cute ! I'm a 32a, 5'1 and 110 pounds and a small was great ! Not see thru, solid material.<br />However, the modeled photo shows yellow loops for the string, and another block of dark blue on the back instead of just on the front. I received a shirt that was all light blue (still with yellow stitching on the sides) and only dark blue on the front with dark blue loops. Also it came with the extended seam style. I still like it ! Just warning that some colors might be different. Hard to pick which brand to get on Amazon because there are so many of these on here. I need to trim the extended seams and the string, but I like it !!"
4.0,"This is a lovely, feminine bracelet with time diamond like accents. The color is silver and is so delicate. It seems more appropriate for a young girl though as it is very small."
4.0,"My husband gifted this to me after I had picked picked it out. I don't generally buy purses more than $20, or white purses. Upon opening, I was thrilled to find the purse body to be very sturdy,  as well as the handles. There were minor scuffs on the exterior but thankfully most of of them rubbed off. The inside of the bag is a purple-ish color, but looks nice with the whole and gold. There is is a pocket in the middle with and zipper where you can store receipts, etc. There are two little pockets along the outside wall. Perfect Perfect for holding a cell phone In place. The other exterior picked is is a small zippered pocket. I love the metal nubs on the bottom so your purse won't sit directly on the floor.<br /><br />The medium pouch is is a decent size, however is much flimsier. I like that it has the hooks on the outsides to where you could use the extended strap and use it as a small crossbody. The small pouch features a zipper, but with an interesting locking mechanism. Still flimsy, but will work well and and coin pouch. The extended strap is wonderfully long, and nd can be used with the main purse as well as the medium pouch.<br /><br />Overall very satisfied with this so far! Definitely would recommend this as an did gift for someone or for yourself!"
4.0,The chain is great. But the clips/hooks in the ends stick and don't close. Not a deal breaker for me as I am using it on something that has its own hooks.
4.0,"work great, a little hot around the neck"
4.0,Wife hasn't told me ... but she didn't ask to return it (smile) that make it a good thing!
4.0,"This dress is far too wide, I had to remove some of the material. I like the material its nice and soft but the dress has in too much!"
4.0,Bought for 5 yr old daughter’s pre-K ball. No complaints. Very pretty. Good quality for price.
4.0,Ring was smaller than i expected
4.0,We trouble with socks constantly sliding. These do not and they pair well with low cut sneakers. I wish they came in more colors but the smiley faces seem to be quite the hit. Quality product.
4.0,I love these pants but after two washes the button just broke. Not from being too tight.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful,it fits great and I have no complaints about the look. The only thing that was an issue for me was the zipper which is why I gave it 4 stars. It would get stuck toward the center so I had to zip it up first and then put it on which was not super easy. I couldn't exchange it because I didn't have enough time."
4.0,These are good for replacement lenses
4.0,"I ordered a large in in this, and it was too small for my broad upper body. 5'7 180 pounds. 40D, with a bit of a belly. The xl gapes a little up front, but I wear a tank top underneath anyway. It's flattering enough and comfortable."
4.0,"Once I got the right size (first one was not), it is fine, serves my purpose and is comfortable to wear."
4.0,Colors are bright with opportunity to wear with many colors.
4.0,Nice push-up fits well runs a bit small
4.0,"I really love the color, and they look great, but they seemed more like a large than an extra large. Yes, they are stretchy, but they may look as tight as the skin on a grape if you are a 14-wide. If you don't like polyester -even lightweight, non-scratchy polyester- you may not like these pants. I am not a fan of polyester, but these are OK if the weather is cool."
4.0,"The shirt fits perfectly in terms of the sleeve length and body dimensions (not too loose, not too tight, not too long or too short). The sleeve length MIGHT be problematic for some guys who wear a size large shirt. I have fairly long arms for a 6-foot tall man (35 and 1/2 inch sleeve length), so the sleeves fit me to a tee. If you have shorter arms you might have a problem with the sleeve length. The collar design I find to be a bit odd for a polo shirt, in that the collar height at the back of the neck is just a tiny fraction under 2 inches - that's pretty high..  ...looks a little weird to me. But for the oddball collar design I would have given the shirt a 5-star rating."
4.0,They work fine. My grandson uses them to play the drums.
4.0,Very pretty. Bought for my elderly mother. Have not worn yet.
4.0,Very bad picture  but  the items  in question  are awesome
4.0,At first I loved the outfit but the size was way too big I contact Amazon about the size and I was very pleased to get s respond about my order soon they will be sending me a smaller size.
4.0,"I really like these pants. they are comfortable, and have effective pocket placement.<br />I need about 3 more pair."
4.0,"Great but have to watch clasp will come loose, but love it"
4.0,Decent quality but cumbersome
4.0,"Pretty dress, but needed to return it because it was too large."
4.0,"Love the socks ,they stay on . . . but they started ripping at the back after I washed them twice. It was sad. Luckily, there are multiple ones in the pack!"
4.0,This shirt is very cute but it does run about 3 sizes too small. The shirt didn't fit me so I gave it to my mom who is a size medium & it fits her perfect! The size I purchased was a xxl & I usually wear a large or xl but I bought a size bigger because of the reviews and it still was too small.
4.0,"Really cute and great design, great little appreciation gift fits great on a helzberg diamonds charm bracelet"
4.0,"The fabric is as expected, though the edges right at groin area chafe a bit (maybe too small of leg holes/made for someone with skinnier thighs?). Tagless is great."
4.0,it's very pretty I like it but the big label in the front is the only thing that was not fairly represented in the photo. not happy about the big label..
4.0,I got the solid red color dress.  I used it with my leggings.  Washed it once. Fits perfectly. it's worth the price.
4.0,i have not used it yet but guess i like it so far..
4.0,"Really cute & comfortable, but I got an XL & it slides off so need a large or medium. Going to buy it again though 👍🏽"
4.0,"Ordered this in my usual size 12 based on the listing measurements. Currently 33 weeks pregnant and 40lb heavier than my usual weight and this dress fits me now with room to spare in all areas.... chest/bust, waist. Definitely size down one if not two sizes. The empire waist band is elastic with plenty of stretch. The material is very thin but not see through. I ordered the baby blue color."
4.0,It wasn’t a bad coat I love the material I just wish the pockets were designed better also there are no pockets on the inside otherwise I like the coat
4.0,Product fit comfortably.  Didn't work well for me.  Made foot swell.  Easy to get on and off and washes well when hung to dry.
4.0,"I absolutely love this chain, however the first time I ordered it the clasp was not as tight as wanted. I decided to order another one and that one was the same way. I realized that the chain is just made like that and it doesn't fall off when you wear it. I would just be careful if I went to an event or was around a lot of people because they might be able unhook it if you are not careful."
4.0,Very comfortable but I feel like it ran a bit small in chest area. My bra size is 38B.<br />Normally wear size 12 dress comfortably.<br />I ordered a large.
4.0,Well packaged...Good product
4.0,"These pants are well-made and comfortable, and drape beautifully over the legs. However, if you are a fatty like me, you're gonna want to wear a long shirt over it to hide your huge gut and sagging butt. FYI."
4.0,Product runs very small to size
4.0,"I wish they were a little thicker so the butt wasn't see through.  They come up really high, I bought a medium and feel like I could use a size small. But, they still do there job! Definitely gave me a smoother tummy area"
4.0,"I got the small black one. It's fine. If you get the black one note that the trim is pink. I thought it was red so I was disappointed. The buckle says &#34;PRETTY ZYS&#34; which I could do without. Other than that it's a perfectly adequate faux leather wallet. 3 slots for credit cards on the left (plus a section underneath to stack additional cards - they just won't be visible), one clear on the right for license, place for bills and a coin pouch with zipper."
4.0,Not the best to see through but cute for what we needed them for! The color run KC
4.0,These are nice for the price. They are big so be prepared for them to look large even on a bigger size head. But they are quality for the price.
4.0,"Nothing fancy.  Simple, sturdy clip at a good price."
4.0,Fits great over my glasses.
4.0,"Over all quality of the sweater is awesome! It’s soft inside, kinda baggy but in a good way and it rests perfectly below the belt line.<br />The only reason this isn’t a 5 star review for a great product is because there was a finger sized hole in the back of the sweater. Not a huge deal but still kinda a bummer."
4.0,Nice but the box it came in looks very cheap. Cant give as a gift except you have to re-package it... i can buy this product again cos it looks nice n classy
4.0,Granddaughters loved them all but a little big for my 4 yr old
4.0,this was loved by the person I gave this to as a Christmas gift.
4.0,Very fitted and slimming.I  received the dress with a hole in the side of the dress.
4.0,The watch I received was great. Good quality and I kept it . Will reorder hopefully I will get the correct one
4.0,I needed this for our trunk or treat theme this year. The skirt fits but can barely get the top on. Good thing I can sew so I will be making the top bigger.
4.0,"Great, Wish it had snaps on the straps for easier access to contents.  And shoulder strap needs more holes for adjustment."
4.0,Really nice top but I recommend order one size down even if you plan to wear with leggings.
4.0,For a woman size small it was really tight for my spouse. After 1 wash it's more like a t-shirt now. She still love it.
4.0,"I bought this dress for family photos and it also great for work!  Perfect length and very flattering.  Got it on a lightening deal, so very happy with this purchase"
4.0,Gave this to my mom and she loved it! Good product!
4.0,"My only complaint was the size.  I purchased by the size recommended for me (5'4"", 120 lbs) which was a small.  I was able to put it on but would have to wear like a shirt instead of a jacket.  After putting on a long sleeve shirt and trying it on again then it was too tight to move my arms.  I returned it.  It is a really nice jacket, just not for me."
4.0,"I'm a US size 6, bought the large (8-10) it's still way too small. It's super cute though!"
4.0,It is Defiently going to be a wonderful outfit this winter. It is really cute.  Mine was well made and did not smell weird. The bunny face is a light green which is a little weird but I still like it.<br /><br />So far I've washed the overalls a few times and it hasn't faded or fallen apart. Its really to hot at the moment for her to wear the shirt. Its really thick so we'll have to see how it holds up when she wears it in a few months.
4.0,worn this dress to a church function. Got tons of compliments.fit like a glove.
4.0,"I've been wearing this ring (black, size 9) since yesterday and have noticed (in no particular order):<br />1. It's very comfortable to wear, sleep in, or exercise in (I did 15 mins. on my elliptical machine and didn't miss a beat.  I usually cannot grasp the hand bar w/ my wedding ring on because it is super uncomfortable).<br />2. It allows room for swelling (my hands swell in the heat)<br />3. You can wash your hands without that icky wet feeling underneath the band<br />4. The presentation was nice as I was expecting it to come in a zipped bag but it came in a cool little black box<br />5. It does pick up a little bit of lint but that's to be expected with silicone.  No biggie, just wash your hands and air dry.<br />7. I forget that I'm wearing it<br />8. The only con I found is that I wish the geometric pattern was a little more pronounced<br /><br />I've been wearing this ring on my middle finger as the size is too big for my ring finger.  I knew this prior to purchasing but wanted to try it out for my husband while he's out of town.  I'm going to give this to him as one of my anniversary gifts to him.  My husband works with his hands a lot and wearing a wedding band has become quite uncomfortable.  Knowing my husband's taste, I think he'll really appreciate this gift.  The best thing is that he'll never know that I wore the ring because it looks as good as new when washed.<br /><br />I received this product, at a discounted price, in exchange for an honest review.

Thank you for reading!"
4.0,"It's nice, feels cool. Haven't used it much yet. Will update my review in the future."
4.0,"I'm 5'4"", weigh 147 lbs. with an apple shape, 38C bra, and typically wear a 14 or large. I ordered this bathing suit in a 12/14 and it fits good. It's a very pretty print and the ruching on the waist does help disguise my tummy a bit. I like the halter style and think that's very flattering. It's a bit lower cut than I'm used to and gives me quite a bit of cleavage. Being older, I'm not sure I would wear this to the beach, but for the backyard pool I think this is fine. So many bathing suits are cut very high on the legs and end up exposing too much of my butt, but this covers it well. I think the price is very good and I recommend this cute bathing suit."
4.0,Small for an XL the fit is similar to a men’s medium T-Shirt. Not much room in the bust. But the design and print is great quality and the shirt is soft and comfortable.
4.0,"It's very beautiful and very soft. It is also VERY TOUCHY. By which I mean that the delicate curls at the bottom frizz terribly at the slightest touch. It's not bad to the point where I'd throw it out or anything, but it can be frustrating-- especially if you are a beginner at handling synthetic wigs.<br /><br />It is still a very nice wig and I can't wait to cosplay with it this weekend."
4.0,I really like this dress. It's beautiful and I highly recommend it!
4.0,"I really like this watch.  Look way more expensive than it really is.  So far I only have to set the time in the mornings when I first put it in.  This is the only reason that it's a 4 star, I wish it kept the time on its own.  I also really like thay it's not bulky at all."
4.0,A bit more bright teal than the picture shows however very pretty and fits well. I wear a 34B and bought a medium as I like fuller coverage and it's perfect!  Good quality bathing suit top.
4.0,"I like the dress and the fabric and the color very much. But it's about 6 inches too long (I'm 5'5"" - not super short) - I like it enough to keep it and hem it myself. It looks just like it was pictured and the shipping was very prompt."
4.0,"Great material, it is stretchy and I usually order a medium/large in these kind of tops and I ordered a large here, really regretting not getting an XL or XXL because they are extremely small and the tank part of the top rolls up all the time, might as well be a really tight sports bra and I bought these to be cropped tanks that I wouldn't need a bra with, kind of disappointed but the quality of fabric is really good just size up 2x your usual size"
4.0,Very cute. Not super sturdy though
4.0,"Love this style. I purchased these in several colors last summer. Somehow lost my black ones so I needed to replace them. I only have one small complaint, and it’s a complaint I also had with the rose gold/pink pair — the metal circle accents sometimes react to my skin and leave a small, circular discoloration. That doesn’t wash off. Kinda questionable..."
4.0,"Good quality, a little tight and short for my height. but when I make cuts the waist fits better. Really good looking in person. Be aware, the stars are pretty damn shiny. lol"
4.0,"I got this shirt yesterday and wore it mountain biking right out of the package lol. I must say I'm impressed with the graphics. Very bright and looks authentic. The material is thick, not flimsy or transparent. My only concern is it white on the reverse side. After use and several washes is it going to fade from black to a gray ??? Time will tell. But totally worth the price and just as comfortable as my under armor and Nike compression shirts for half the price. Will buy other super hero versions from this company and recommend to my friends."
4.0,Some loose strings here and there but overall it's a cute top. Fit's as expected.
4.0,"I've only used them a couple of times so far, but I found that the XXL was a really good fit for my plus sized self, and the extra padding added great comfort for 10+ mile bike rides. They seem good about now riding up on the thighs, the material seems sturdy and good quality, a lot more than I hoped for for the price. A good value."
4.0,"It fits a little snug, but very comfortable."
4.0,"Design fashionable  ,fit was good and material good quality  for the price"
4.0,"The bow looks floppy right out of the bag, but if you fluff it it opens up and holds its shape. The quality is good, other than some exposed hot glue on a few spots. Also, the bow wasn’t glued on the center of the headband, but we just turned the headband a little and it worked fine.<br /><br />I purchased the hot pink bow for my daughter’s SIA costume."
4.0,I like the size of stone and color. True to ring size
4.0,I got these for my new apple watch SE and they are decent quality and unique colors but nothing amazing.
4.0,This bikini bottom fits good but for me the ruffle is too long.  Others may like the ruffle like it is.  It is made with quality material.  I will probably just shorten the ruffle!
4.0,"Pretty good for the price. Fit normally. I like it! If you are apple shaped it's a good dress. Again, good for the price! Don't have huge expectations for a $20 dress."
4.0,Very cool. Fits like a hockey jersey should. Very warm too. Love it.
4.0,It is a great product but I didn't think it felt comfortable. It's probably just a personal opinion not really a fan of leather but wanted options with different outfits.
4.0,Loved the top. I wish the bottom was a scrunch butt. Overall it is really cute and looks nice on a small bust. I am a 32 A.
4.0,Perfect. Wish it had pockets inside.
4.0,I purchased these tanks thinking they had a built in bra but they don't.  I'm sure I was the one who made the mistake.  I returned them.
4.0,"Nice big gimmicky hat- cheapest one I could find.  Fabric is thin,  but that’s what I would expect for the price"
4.0,"I bought these because spending $80 on name-brand sunglasses sounds like a little much. These were $10 or so, and you get what you pay for. Build quality feels cheap, but it isnt too hard to take care of sunglasses. If you are buying these for an outdoor job where you will be sweating alot, buy a different pair of glasses."
4.0,"My mom suggested I get some compression sleeves to reduce/eliminate shin splints from jogging, so I ordered these calf compression sleeves from HZI in a size Medium, according to the size chart in the images. I am 5'7&#34; and my calf circumference is 12.5&#34; and they fit well. They are very snug (which I expected them to be due their intended purpose) and took a little effort to get on.<br />I am doing a 5k next month and I intend to jog this time around (I usually just speed walk) to see if I can really push myself. I get terrible shin splints, so I will be using these compression sleeves quite often over the next 6 weeks in conjunction with a couch to 5k app. So far, I haven't had any pain or soreness from shin splints while using these, but I'm only a few days into my training. Added bonus: they keep my legs warmer in this cold weather! I will update my review if anything changes, but so far I don't have any complaints!<br /><br />**I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"Great little inexpensive shoes. But beware they don’t last very long. But since kids grow out of shoes so fast anyhow, it’s a good bargain."
4.0,"I purchased swimsuit for water exercise class. It serves the purpose, nothing exceptional but what do you expect for the price. I've only had it a couple of weeks so haven't decided if I will reorder."
4.0,"This is a padded zipper pouch made of neoprene and designed to hold electronics devices. The pouch is also supposed to double as a mouse pad, but it doesn't really lay flat enough to do that. The padding is enough to cushion a small tablet and protect it from scratches when it is stored with books or other items in a book bag. It is not designed to nor does it provide any sort of structural support. It is a little larger than a 7&#34; tablet needs and is slightly stretch so I could put in a stylus and a charging cable without difficulty.<br /><br />The neoprene smells very &#34;rubbery&#34; - like a wet suit. The smell in terms of what wafts in the air dissipates after about a day of exposure to a ventilated area. If you put the bag right up to your nose though, you can still smell it. If you're sensitive to these smells, this may not be a good choice.<br /><br />The exterior of the bag is smooth and won't scratch or catch on anything else stored with it. The color and print are sharp and clear. The tones in pictures match the real colors on the pouch that I received. The zippers come with little rubbery grip tabs so they're easy to grip and grasp. My zippers are made of nylon and worked smoothly in both directions. I spilled water on the front and it does appear to be waterproof, though I wouldn't submerge it as a test as the zipper likely will leak through. All in all, it's a very nice pouch and, though I haven't washed it yet, I'm guessing it'll wash up well given the type of material. The only real down side is the rubbery smell.<br /><br />Note: I received a free sample of this product for my assessment."
4.0,Dope hoodie for an awesome price! Came in great condition and was shipped really fast.
4.0,"it passed months since I use it, it is perfect, fit very nice with my gear s2 classic, one thing that makes me didn't give full stars, it is after sweating band change it color and it became Crusty."
4.0,I really like it but it is super big and bulky. Figuring out how to wear it can be a challenge.
4.0,"I would recommend getting your exact size, because unlike most suit jackets which are tight, this one is a big too big. It looks a little goofy when my hands get covered by the suit, but if it fit, it would be a really nice suit. The material is quality and it is not heavy where you will feel sluggish. It is quite breathable and airy, and the black looks really clean."
4.0,"These are comfortable, with moderate compression.  As with most compression socks, they are a bit too long, and bunch up at the back of my knee (I am 5'4&#34;,) but are OK folded over a little.  I would buy these again, for those days when I need socks with less compression."
4.0,The tank top itself could be a little better quality but the print is great and it's on straight.
4.0,"Make sure you go up a half size with these boots! I'm a size 7 with fairly narrow feet, I bought a size and had to size up to a 7 1/2 because they we so small and tight. The 7 1/2 fits perfect, not too big and I can wear a little thicker sock comfortably. Overall they seem like quality shoes and they are very stylish. I hate the laces, they are a raw leather and they will probably need to be replaced eventually. The boots have no tread on the bottom so they can be slippery and difficult to bike in. Definitely not a winter boot, you would slide all over the place, but so far they are a good fall boot. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase, a great bargain for Frye boots!"
4.0,"Love this shirt, the color the fit all of it."
4.0,"Good little wallet for travel. A little on the bulky side, but I guess that's to be expected. Plus side is you get lots of space for all sorts of stuff."
4.0,Very good quality the only problem is too smal
4.0,The bracelet is ok but not all that good looking.
4.0,Bought for a gift. Makes a cute pin for fiddle playing friends
4.0,Hold glasses nicely.
4.0,"The dress is really nice, although when it says stretch they MEAN it.  The material is heavy, it reminds me a lot of a show choir or dance recital fabric.  It is really flattering, but I think I will need to order a size down because it has a LOT of stretch to it.  The top is a little tight in the chest for me, but there is a little string that I can snip to make more room.<br /><br />Overall, great garment for weddings, swing dancing, or similar functions."
4.0,"It's super cute!!! But I ordered a medium & its way too big, I tried reading the reviews before deciding on the size but I am returning for a small. I am 5'4 & 120 pounds & a 34B. the medium top fit a little big but the bottom was WAY to big on me so hopefully the small will be perfect!"
4.0,The watch works well.
4.0,"This is a great jersey, the numbers are stitched a little and it has nice material. My only complaint is that it fits small, I am a large usually so I got a large but the large was way to small I bought an xl and it’s too big, I ended up keeping the xl"
4.0,"This product took a very long time to come in the mail (from China)<br />It appears to be well made and the colors are striking and fun.  There are built in cups in the bra area for extra coverage.  The material is nice and thick and I think it it will hold up well.<br /> I accidentally ordered an XL instead of a Large.  So, this was too big for me and I cannot return it due to it coming from China and not being a Prime item.<br />I loved it though and will probably order it again in the right size.<br /><br />I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,It fits good now but will be tight if washed and dried...........
4.0,If they had glitter on them they'd be prettier.
4.0,"I love this purse! It is so cute and holds all my stuff. My only quirky reason for not 5 stars is that the opening is small so you can’t really throw stuff into it while it’s on your shoulder. You have to take it off, find the right pocket, and open the opening with 2 hands. It’s not hard - just an extra step. It does smell like leather, but I’m ok with that!"
4.0,Fits a bit large but the quality is fantastic.
4.0,My daughter loves her jacket.  It’s lightweight and keeps her warm and dry in the snow.
4.0,I absolutely love the ring minor flaw stone missing from the band but it's perfect and probably will order another
4.0,"I like the tiny size of these earrings and that they are real gold.<br />The simulated aquamarine stones are just fine for me - don't need the real thing as these look good.<br />and the price was so good, compared to other similar products or even less quality ones."
4.0,"These earrings are absolutely beautiful!  The crystals are clear and sparkly and they add elegance!  They were smaller than I expected, which they were larger.  Great buy for the price."
4.0,"This is ""just right"" for packing in an overnight bag, for those like me who MUST have a body pillow for sleeping comfort. Please note that this inflatable pillow is quite narrow, so pay attention to the specs!<br /><br />My only complaint is how this is inflated. You must press in a button and then twist it in order to allow the pillow to be inflated. It took me about 3 minutes of puffing to fully inflate it. The problem is that you must then reverse the process: the button has to be reverse-twisted and allowed to ""pop back out"" to keep the pillow inflated. A lot of air escapes while doing this.<br /><br />I need a traveling body pillow infrequently enough that this will work OK for me. If you plan to use this often, and must inflate/deflate frequently, then be aware that it does take a little bit of ""fiddling"" to work."
4.0,"A fun item and design. High quality heavy-weight 100% cotton. Got a M, should have gone a size down. However, similar to current large cuts.  Mock neck is a little tighter than I prefer.<br />Had an unpleasant chemical smell coming out of the bag, which went away after washing. Will wash it again prior to wear."
4.0,Tight little neck hole makes me worried the lace will bust. I should have gotten a large but I got medium for a tight form fit. Chest is 38 waist 31 hips 42. So adorable though. Not see through.
4.0,"This hat is ultra soft but it’s a little big. I know all bucket hats are a little big but this one I guess looks even bigger because of the texture. Nevertheless, I still read like it and it looks just as shown"
4.0,Very cute but wouldn’t stay on.
4.0,Love the colors. Fits great and very comfortable.
4.0,I admired it at first sight and my granddaughter likes and appreciates her lovely Christmas gift.
4.0,"The bust line did not hit me right with this style. Very cute, just not on my body."
4.0,"Even after reviewing the size chart the dress I tried on was very tight in the chest, causing a flat look instead of allowing for a lifted look. Okay length, just wasnt for me."
4.0,Love the colors. So amazing. The sleeves are really short which is strange for a kimono but I still love it for a bathing suit cover up
4.0,"Not a people person so, Love it!<br />Can you believe people actually get closer so they can read it?!"
4.0,these will be my &#34;fat&#34; jeans at 36&#34;
4.0,"Durable and lightweight. Long battery life and dependable. I've had a few of these. Changing the band can be a hassle, with some. Solid cheap watch."
4.0,"I bought the Kuromi Pajama + Headband set, and it's super cute. Delivery wasn't the quickest, and the headband didn't show up at all but I still really like it."
4.0,"Good price for the quantity. They come unscrewed very easily, but I don't mind since I check it constantly anyways."
4.0,I love the shirt. It’s super soft and convenient with the built in mask. Only negative is it runs a little on the small side
4.0,"The front fits good it's super cute and super comfortable! I took out the little padding that came in it, there's a soft hook in the back not clasp I didn't think it would work but I'm working with it, I recommend hand wash and air dry, I got an XL in this bra."
4.0,The item met my expectations.
4.0,"I love how this gives you that small &#34;middle&#34; silhouette.  It's a bit tight on my rib cage, but only encourages me to lose more weight :P"
4.0,Item as expected. Exactly what I need.
4.0,"Beautiful and comfortable piece, only drawback is that it is see-through"
4.0,"Locking Belt Buckle somewhat difficult to unlock, had to get familiar with it before I got the hang of it."
4.0,"The most important thing you need to know about this is that it's more of a long shirt than a dress. Everything fits well, I ordered a size up, but it's way too short for a dress. As others have stated it would work great with a nice pair of jeans or leggings and boots.<br />The fabric is so very soft. It's extremely comfortable and light weight. I would definitely recommend wearing a tank top under it because it's pretty see-through, especially if you're busty. Because of how light weight it is I wouldn't recommend this for winter wear. Maybe if you have a jacket that pairs well and very thick jeans. But it's pretty thin.<br />The pattern and color are lovely, true to the photos. I ordered brown, I just think white gets too dirty quickly, and it looked nice. As weird as it is, I think it is a little odd with olive skin tones. I'm sure it looks great once you have the whole outfit together but when I first tried it on it brought out the warmer, yellow tones in my skin. And that's not something I personally like about myself with this &#34;dress.&#34;<br /><br />Minus how I feel about the color and the fact that it's called a dress while being way too short, I think it's a lovely longer shirt. I think it looks great with just about anything from pants or leggings, to belts, to long necklaces. It's definitely a versatile piece!<br /><br />I received this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. These opinions are mine and mine alone."
4.0,Beautiful color and good quality. My husband loves it.
4.0,Fit is a little small.  I ordered the small 4/6 and my four yr old barely fits in it. really well made with nice material though.
4.0,"Very nice, but I normally wear a s/m and it just fits.  I plan on never putting it in the dryer.  Hope it does not shrink in the wash machine"
4.0,Used for a photobooth prop. Arrived on time and as expected.
4.0,"Out of the packaging the print looks great, but the item description did not mention that it is a cold weather thermal gaiter. Was hoping to rock it out on tomorrow's bike ride but at 75 degrees at 5am, this won't work.  I guess it will sit in storage until winter in 4 months.  Bummer."
4.0,I originally ordered a medium after reading reviews and they were barley too small. I ordered a large instead and they are slightly too big but I can make it work. The shorts are just as pictured and super cute but sizing is a bit off. For reference I’m 4’11 130lbs but I have thicker legs and a booty so might be why the medium didn’t fit as well.
4.0,The sleeves were good but overall it was a bit short for my 11 year old.
4.0,The reviews state that this top runs large.  I did not find this to be true.  It ran very small for a large.
4.0,"We got this for our Halloween costume. The tiara is beautiful, but surprisingly heavy and was too large for my 5 year olds head. The ends of the combs on the back went past her ponytail so we had to do a fluffy bun thingy to get it to stay on and even then it didnt stay on long. It needs to be clipped down on the front sides as well somehow to be stable for wearing any significant amount of time."
4.0,"Simple, comfortable t-shirt dress! length is perfect for work, and it can be dressed up or down. Removed one star because as soon as i cut off the tag on the side a hole developed in it before I even had a chance to wear it. Easily fixed with a couple stitches so no big deal."
4.0,"I felt that the zipper was too flimsy. On a bag such as this, the zipper and surrounding area should have been sturdier."
4.0,"I order by the measurements on the chart. Fit extremely big. I returned it. I love the dress, very comfortable by was too big"
4.0,"The hat is nice and warm, but it slides up a bit after wearing it for sometime. It does not stay put in the same place. Not sure if its because of the soft hair or there isnt  enough grip inside the hat."
4.0,My Halife tunics are really very nice. They look great with my peddle pusher leggings. I did notice though that the black and white print fit looser than the other two prints I ordered plus it was packaged differently than the other two. The black and white one had a Halife tag on it and the other two didn’t. Makes me wonder if those two were truly Halife brands
4.0,Very very pretty.  A little too big for a tragus but perfect for cartilage.
4.0,The shoe is as advertised. The shoe is comfortable and attractive. This will be a great gift.
4.0,Nothing fancy but for the price it's great! They all have held up
4.0,"Would have liked to be a bit fuller. But for price, it was a good product."
4.0,"One thing a woman needs with her all the time is a good purse. It carries everything for you, your kids, and your husband. It needs to be strong enough to carry the weight but stylish enough that you want to carry it. This is a very large leather purse that is definitely more the size of a tote bag. The leather is dark pink color but I would not say it is pink at all really. The leather is of a good quality and is very strong. The purse itself is huge really and fits a lot with inside pockets and one outside pocket.<br /><br />I like this purse a lot except I do find that it to be a bit larger than what I would like  to carry everyday. It holds all my stuff and then some so I know that I will always have what I need at hand. The top part of the bag fold over nicely when it is not full, which is never really is but it can get in the way when trying to get into the purse quickly. This is overall a very high quality,nice purse. It is just a bit to big for me.<br /><br />I received this purse at a discount for my honest and unbiased review and opinion. Opinions expressed are mine and mine alone and may differ from yours."
4.0,Very comfortable and sexy if you wear nothing under it!
4.0,"Finally, a yellow and BLACK tie! (Where did the blue even come from??) Anyway, these seem to be great quality ties for costume use. The only reason I docked a star was because the picture of the red tie isn’t very accurate, though the description did say it was burgundy with gold stripes. I was hoping for the brighter colors shown in the pictures."
4.0,Cute on and great fit
4.0,"This is a very oft and comfortable tank, but I recommend ordering a size down as it does run large.  I am usually between a large and xl and I ordered a large and it was still a bit too big but hoping it will shrink more in the wash/dryer."
4.0,Usually between a medium and a small and this shirt fit a little on the large side. I expected it to hug my waist a little more than it did. Good quality just runs a little big
4.0,I would highly recommend this.  LOVE the magnetic adjustment even though it took a bit to figure out how it worked originally.  Once I did I thought it was brilliant and is VERY comfortable because of that and the type of material.  The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that the color is not what it shows in the picture on the advertisement.  It is dull and not as vibrant as it shows (see pics) and I took the pics out in the sun so you could see the full color.  That was disappointing.
4.0,Just a little short in the leg and the sleeves aren't full length but everything else was good.  I'm not sure how long it will last but we'll see.
4.0,"This classy stylish watch just arrived in the mail today. I really like the design of the watch and how it fits. At this time I am giving the watch 4 stars because I am having a hard time opening the watch band when I want to take it off. Perhaps, it is still new but with a few times wearing this nice watch, opening it will be become easier. I would definitely recommend buying this watch. If the band starts opening easier within the next few weeks I will change the rating to 5 Stars."
4.0,This dress is a nice thick material. I'm a size 0 jeans and still fit loose. I'll have to return.<br />Thinking about altering it though. I really like it.
4.0,"Just received this new luggage set.  Very nice but flimsy like a thick Tupperware lid, so it seems like it will move and not crack...I have an upcoming trip and will review more later.  For those that are trying to figure out how to set the locks...I pulled it up on YouTube (search under How to reset TSA locks). Anyway, use a ball point pen and push in the reset button located on the side of the lock opposite the combo numbers.  You should hear a click.  Now set your combo and then press the push button and you should hear another click.  Now u r reset to the new combo.  (Photos enclosed) Good luck!"
4.0,These fit perfectly. Not too tight or baggy. They were comfortable to wear.
4.0,"Overall these pants have a very sleek classy look to them. They are pant suit material which is wonderful. I like how these pants have a permanent pant crease in the front so I don’t have to iron them in. Even though there is a zipper in the back I can pull them up without unzipping them. I initially bought a xxlg Returned them for a regular xlarge and I think I need to go down one more size. After I wore them all day the pants definitely got lose at the waist and I kept having to pull them up. They got baggy.<br />I’m also 5”10, slender legs, and these pants are long enough for me which was a miracle."
4.0,The sizes all came too large.  Like the ladies L ordered L for really should have had M.  Also the XL should have had L.  We used the sizing chart to figure out the order.  The S were just right.
4.0,My ears are sensitive and the hook hasn’t given me any problems.
4.0,"They came on time, they're were a little bent out of shape but nothing I couldn't fix. Overall I love the glasses."
4.0,"Honestly, these are pretty good gloves for the price. I have big hands, so they are very tight even though I ordered the XL. So far so good, I hope that they last more than a few seasons. Not using them for work, just for regular everyday use. These are not very high end gloves, just simply middle of the road gloves."
4.0,"cute, exactly as described"
4.0,"It does tend to get tangled up when not in use, received many compliments from co workers"
4.0,It's a little big and a little long-wasted (but then I'm really short 4-11) so for a normal person it'll probably fit perfectly.
4.0,Very nice dress.  Great for the price.
4.0,"Essentially it is Teeshirt with snaps on both sides which works great for people who have had shoulder surgery. I just had shoulder surgery and this design works great. I would definitely recommend this shirt.  Having said that I wish they would had an option of a longer shirt. I know I am not unique in admitting that when I bend over or shift my weight in a chair, the shirt becomes untucked. It's a pain to have to get up and retuck. Kind of pricy for a Teeshirt"
4.0,I like this product alot i got 14g it fits snug so if you dont want that dont get 14g. However i do not like the size of the balls i feel they could be smaller.
4.0,"These were a little smaller than I expected, but worked out fine."
4.0,"Very cute, just need a bit better zippers."
4.0,"The one I got is very pale almost all white. It is TINY, but it works bc its a gift for a 5yo boy --he's obsessed with crystals but this is his first birthstone pendant. I feel he will notice this amethyst isn't very purple whatsoever so yikes! :("
4.0,"I order the black and it was definitely more of a charcoal grey.  Otherwise, okay."
4.0,"I was so excited for this top but it fits me.. Super weird? It bubbles around the sides (under arm area) which is really unflattering. I couldn't get it to look right, but maybe it was me- 4 stars because it is as advertised, nothing wrong with it."
4.0,Soft and thickness
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable, but as someone that typically wears a large in sweatshirts, I had to buy a 2xl to get my usual preferred fit."
4.0,This item Came as advertised which is good enough for me!i would buy from this place again without hesitation!good leather quality.Thanks!!
4.0,These sunglasses fit to far off of cheeks making them unsuitable for motorcycling which is why I bought them. The wind and dust carry up under glasses into eyes. That said they are really well made and look good. I will keep them and use them as everyday sunglasses. Were it not for the motorcycling aspect they would rate a solid five stars.
4.0,Have an arthritic finger.  Wear this all the time.  Fits all sizes.  The letters of the words do stick up slightly.  Would love it more if it came without the wording.
4.0,"The shorts were a little puffier than expected, but happy with the purchase."
4.0,I love the bathing suit! The only thing that bugs me about it is that underwire. It pokes at my skin which can be uncomfortable but other than that it fit good :)
4.0,I loved it the only time I got to wear it. It broke when I went to take it off.
4.0,Beside some material coming off the tile & sticking to my skin whenever I get out the shower it’s perfect.
4.0,Got it for my husband as a birthday gift. He likes it
4.0,"I love the fit, the fabric, and the color of this top. I gave it a 4 because the white hood strings make it look cheap."
4.0,"I like the material they are made with. Is different than the standard rubber feeling, plastic types. They are able to be adjusted for a more snug fit but was not needed for me. Really like the look of them. The arch support will take me some time to get used for sure."
4.0,Thanks  cute liked the products had to buy two because I use them to make earrings
4.0,Good for the price. Fits and feels good. Just a bit sheer. Going to order the black to compare :)
4.0,"Was going to use this in an LOTR woodworking project, but decided against it. It will make a good mini-gift for my grandson."
4.0,Was a bit larger than expected
4.0,"This dress arrived on time as expected through Prime. The product is exactly as pictured, however, as far as fit goes this was a little tight for my 7 year old who wears a US size 14 in all dresses . Therefore, if your child tends to be somewhere on the larger side of 12/14/16 in US size, then these dresses just won’t do. Hence, my 4 stars due to size! Overall, nice dress but bad sizing."
4.0,Beautiful and not cheap at all!
4.0,pretty good! only one small thing bothering me..<br />the pin is a little short so it could go to the wrong side and made my watch fall.
4.0,The earrings are very nice.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the third pair is too small.
4.0,beautiful. color blue is so pretty
4.0,"Not the highest quality, but I expected that. I love the dress. It actually looks better without the shrug."
4.0,"So these are official marvel comics shorts. The gray pair is perfect. However no matter how I adjust the black pair, it appears that one leg is longer than the other?  I’m hoping it won’t be noticeable when wearing. If so, the black pair can just be PJ shorts.<br />The shorts are fleece on the inside so these would not be suitable for summer, maybe a warm fall day or cool spring day. Or maybe just PJ shorts altogether 🤷🏻‍♀️<br />Just from handling my toddlers clothes everyday, I can say these do fit true to size. I ordered a 3t. My toddler is around 40 pounds and wears a 3-4t normally. Typical toddler height, not extra tall or short, unsure of his true height currently.<br />Other than the wonky pant leg length; these are great shorts!"
4.0,Love the chain. The blue of the rose is pretty cloudy. Otherwise it’s nice enough.
4.0,It took a looooong time to ship (but its coming from china). I bought this for my sister-in-law. She loves wrap around earrings. It was a little difficult to put on and kind of heavy for the ear but she wears it out any occassion she gets. Been about a month and it still looks good.
4.0,I love this but I bought a different chain because the one that it comes with sucks
4.0,Great graphics and heavy cotton t shirt. But shorter than most other x large t shirts I have bought in the past
4.0,"The pants were pretty true to size, but the top seems to be a little bit smaller than most X-large I've bought in the past. My daughter did like them, though. They're comfortable, she said."
4.0,Dress looked great and fit well. I got the small at 5'6 & 120lbs. Only issue is that the dress is 100% cotton and came a wrinkled mess. Also wrinkles fairly easily when wearing. Washed well.
4.0,"This dress is ALMOST perfect. It's a nice thicker material. It had pockets (you know we love pockets), it's a longer more professional length, it has a nice A line flair, but the only thing is I wish it had adjustable straps. It fits me well and the straps don't fall but I feel like if you had bigger shoulders or a bigger back the straps would be too tight. Other than that I love this dress I already have it in 3 different prints and I'll probably get more"
4.0,Nice shirt for the beach!
4.0,I like this mask not only for what it says but it is nice and roomy but fits safe and secure. Easy to breathe in it.
4.0,Somewhat small. Great color
4.0,"At first I did not like the material it was made with, kind of like bathing suit material. But, I wore it anyway because I love these type of maxi dresses, I received a lot of compliments on it! So if you can get passed the fabric it is a pretty dress. Very modest which is exactly what I was looking for in a dress. It’s hard to find modest clothing these days. The price is great too!"
4.0,the padding on the palm of the gloves needed to be broken in and the gloves were very stiff but after a couple hours of use they relaxed.
4.0,"For the price it is an awesome jersey with cool designs. ONLY PROBLEM, I'm normally a medium and for some reason this one seems a bit small in the front..possibly because it's a full zip Jersey? Not too sure because full zip stuff on me usually doesn't fit like this does. I understand its a cycling jersey, but my stomach is almost always showing when I'm sitting more up straight or standing."
4.0,"The cloth on the stomach folds out a bit showing white material and the bra pads show, so there are circles on your chest"
4.0,It was slightly too big for me but I love it and will reorder a smaller size
4.0,Good watch but battery was dead when it came
4.0,cute and good size
4.0,I read reviews about this suit and how it runs small so I ordered a large. It is a bit too big. Im glad it doesn't squeeze my back fat or leave me with booty lines but it coms off in the ocean! It is made of neoprene which is cool because I bought one that has a metallic rose gold color and it looks good. I am 5'5&#34; and 135lbs.
4.0,My best friend has been a Chucky fan forever.  I'm saving it for Christmas but I had my brother try it on.<br />He;s going to be SO excited!!!!
4.0,"Ordered large, definitely fitting in waist a bit snug, going for the XL. Im 5'2 perfect length. Light weight perfect for wedding, church or work."
4.0,Installed in 30 seconds! Feels strong and sturdy. There aren't as many holes as the OEM wristband. It is sometimes a tad too tight or too loose. But not too bad.
4.0,"Cheaply made product. I received the product with a crack in the frame that holds the phone. But since I was in need and the price was Ok, I kept it.  It does not hold up well to daily use...as plastic parts crack easily, esp. when you try to remove phone from case. I have purchased from this vendor before, so I can say that the item will be sent in a timely manner. But if you want higher quality, please look elsewhere."
4.0,I found the hose to be uniform in color but the color wasn't exactly as expected. Off black had a pronounced brown tint. The hose wear well and stay in place but snag and even tear easily while putting on. Think I would like less sheer in favor of stronger.
4.0,"They fit perfectly and I have a slightly wide foot! I also have the rust colored ones... Both look really cute with spring dresses. I wouldn't expect a high end quality for this price, but I think they are perfect for the price!"
4.0,I have a lot of hair so it worked perfect to keep my hair protected
4.0,"There are no pockets, I expected pockets. It is also a cat hoodie, I thought it would be a bear. The colors are great but you cannot pick the colors they just roll through the set over and over again. Over all I love it, but it is now what I expected"
4.0,"The light weight means thin, but not super thin. Like a t-shirt.  They are super cute on and sizing is true to fit."
4.0,"This was a gift for my mom, but she likes it. It was a little smaller than I thought but still works."
4.0,"too much rim for me, but I'll still wear them ~ comfortable"
4.0,I did like the style and color of this bracelet and the beauty of it. I will say it did get caught a few times on my dress. I wore this for my daughters wedding. Even though it caught on my dress I did wear it for the entire event.
4.0,"My aunt and uncle used this for a trip overseas. They said it worked well for them on the plane. They wish it could have been a bit more stylish, but it certainly did the job"
4.0,They are a beautiful pajamas.  Fits large.
4.0,"Good watch for the price, not crazy about the metal band. Doesn't look like it will hold up and will remove the hair from you arm, Lolol. Is easy to see and has a great look."
4.0,Good coverage.
4.0,"Material is very thin and the rope ""belt"" started fraying and eventually came apart but still a pretty dress for the price. I wear a black tank top and leggings underneath. When you walk, it flows behind you something pretty like. I get a lot of compliments when i wear it."
4.0,"Looks as is, so cute!!"
4.0,I tried it on as soon as I got it! I love the way it looks and feels. The material is stretchier than I thought it would be. But that’s fine. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it’s way long. I got a size small and I’m 5’7 and 130lbs if that helps anyone out
4.0,Liked the color<br />Only one xxl size available
4.0,"Nice bracelet but it took a while to ship. Also, the charms are a lot smaller than pictured."
4.0,Good so far.... Ask me in 6 mos
4.0,Comfortable fit. Still is not anti-fog. Serves its purpose.
4.0,I love necklaces like gypsies.Its a simple necklace but pretty.
4.0,"I love the hat itself. However when I took it out of the bag in was overwhelming. It smelled so bad like moldy clothing I couldn't stand it. With white vinegar and Charlie's soap it is smelling better but I was very sad that it smelled so aweful. Hope the next one is better. Also, there were no care/wash instructions or return slip enclosed."
4.0,My 5 yo daughter wears 10 toddler going on 11.  These fit great... In fact she can wear these w/ footed PJs if we are doing a car only errand.  I would buy a 2nd pair in purple but they are sold out.  $6 GREAT find!
4.0,Very soft and warm.  My bother is disabled and only like soft materials.<br /><br />He loved his vest that I gave him for Christmas.  I will certainly buy more items from this company.
4.0,These are small (about half size) but did stretch enough for me to wear. They are comfortable. I wish there was more colors.
4.0,"These are great, but speakers dont reach over my ears all the way."
4.0,I haven't worn it yet. But from just trying it on the arms feel a little tight. But other than that I'm sure I'm gonna love the yop
4.0,Was hard to figure out the pieces for the legs but otherwise fits perfectly. He will be able to use this more than once too.
4.0,"I'm 5'10"", 135# slender, size 36B. I bought a Medium Slim fit. It fits everywhere but tight in my shoulder area when I bring my arms forward. I recommend going one size up in the ""Slim fit"", should help in the tight shoulder Dept."
4.0,I bought this locket for my 6 year old daughter for her birthday.  It is small enough to fit her.  The shape is unique and I was able to get it engraved at our local jewelers.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it arrived slightly dented.  The jeweler was able to fix it and it was pretty enough that I wasn't willing to send it back because of the dent.
4.0,I like this very much. I do wish it had a zippered closure for holding cash though. Otherwise I have no complaints and use it often.
4.0,"These items are very hard to find at brick and mortar. Surprisingly so. Nonetheless they are available from Amazon. These billfold (wallet) windows have an inner opening which is ideal since that makes it difficult for any item to fall out. Be careful as some brands of replacement windows have openings at the top. If you want windows with an inner opening, this is the one that works."
4.0,Plastic glasses good price for what they r
4.0,"With just one wee inner pocket, no lining, and no resistance to rain, it's not much. But if you're wanting a simple, purse-size summer backpack for under $25, you won't find better than this cute little thing. Very pleased with mine. It holds a wallet, two pairs of glasses, cell phone, light cardigan, and a few little things (lipstick etc). Add a water bottle and it's a tight squeeze, but doable."
4.0,"Comfortable. Easy to slip on this dress and walk out the door with style. Who doesn't love that? Fabric is poly so it is not as soft as a cotton knit would, but the cut and pattern is flattering."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:ae0c7d13f71857f3435a7ff287bebb69]] love my 2G hoops. they're discreet (when amongst others who dislike stretched ears) and also very stylish. but boiiiiii they are HEAVY. I got the larger hoop size because I saw the added weight, but they are REALLY hefty.<br /><br />took some getting used to as these are my first pair of heavy weighted hangers. if you're used to weight in your ears and rlly wanna dead weight stretch, these are the way to go!! didn't realize I was a 4G before putting these in (more like a 3G/3.5), but I got em through somehow and let em sit in my ears overnight; THENNNNN I realized that these were in fact 2G after comparing em to my plugs.<br />side lesson here: DO NOT put these in if your ears are freshly stretched up in size. DO NOT FORCE THEM EITHER. let them be an aid in your journey, not a detriment.<br /><br />these thangz got weight baby. take it slow with these, and use em temporarily throughout the day, NOT for days at a time unless you are absolutely sure your ears can handle it. also recommend oiling up ya ears every hour or so, as they might dry out a bit with these.<br /><br />overall, a great purchase. would buy again, but probably the smaller diameter hoops first for less weight. feel so fly w/ these :)"
4.0,Extremely comfortable and flowing I would get different colors. Got for a pastel bridal party and got many compliments.
4.0,The color fades because its just cheaply printed on the band.
4.0,I had been eyeing this dress for months. Loved the color and style of the dress! I received so many compliments from both men and women. The only draw back is the top part of the dress is cut a little small for the size. I had to wear a tank under it.  I do have a larger chest but I could tell it was a smaller cut. The rest of the dress is made well. Great pockets and flow! I could wear it with sandals or a cute pair of chucks and still be comfortable. I went from the office to happy hour to an outdoor event and was comfy and appropriate at all three.
4.0,Dress draped perfectly.....
4.0,I actually love the shoes but did not bother to try them on when I saw the scratches
4.0,my girl liked it
4.0,looks nice on the person though
4.0,"Good fit, but they do tend to roll down while I am riding."
4.0,"Sits perfectly on me, but as everyone said, it does get twisted. Worth it though."
4.0,"Loved this bathing suit!!! It came faster than I anticipated, right before my vacay which is a plus!! I'm 5'4&#34; on the thick side but it fits perfect and has cups to help accentuate the top ladies. Who says you can't be sexy in a one piece!!"
4.0,"The color is exact match. Quality is impressive, considering the price I paid {$9.99}. However, I ordered the large as a ""just in case"" to allow for shrinkage, if any, in laundry. I am 5'2"" 130# 34/36 ""B"" bust. Fits ideally - but more like a proper medium would. So in other words, they run small. The arms are excessively long for me. I'm petite built. So they are an inch or more too long. Expected considering I bumped up 1 size. Overall a 7 or 8 out of 10. My caveat, be careful of sizing. Product made in China."
4.0,Very nice for the price....
4.0,its a little different in the fit but still very nice and material is satin so very flattering. but the smoke smell took 2 washes to get out it smelled so bad. the product itself is nice
4.0,"It isn't as thick as I hoped, but it fits and I've washed it and worn it twice.  No issues with too much shrinkage or obvious early damage from light use."
4.0,"really soft and stuffed for protection,only drawback is they aren't adjustable.<br />cute and very warm"
4.0,Good ski sunglasses
4.0,"The colors are a little out of line, but damn if he ain't super cute! Pretty big. I like the lil cat print."
4.0,"My husband typically wears a large in running shorts so I ordered him a large.  While the length is fine, they are too tight everywhere else.  You'll want to order a size up.  Besides that issue these are great.  They have two zippered pockets that are handy for bringing a few items while out running.  The internal mesh lining is comfortable.  The material is really light and comfortable."
4.0,"I am giving it four stars because there is only one size. It is really pretty and soft. I am a 34C or M normally, and although this bra fits, it's a little more tight than I would like. I don't think anyone with a band size of 36 could wear this, so keep that in mind."
4.0,I like this watch. Just got it today. It fits nicely and looks nice too. I am just concerned about how long the watch will last. But so far so good!
4.0,"My partner found these shoes on Amazon for me, as we were looking for inexpensive boat shoes. These are unique and I've gotten a lot of compliments on them. They are comfortable and wear well, especially if you have a relaxed style and can't be bothered with looking &#34;girlie&#34;."
4.0,Bought for my daughter. She loves it
4.0,For the price i would expect more quality.
4.0,This is the perfect color of ink I was looking for in a handbag and the style is so nice. I've received many compliments on it.
4.0,They were both nice.
4.0,"Love the pin. The dammit would not stay on though, had to replace it."
4.0,"Got so many compliments on this, good fit. A little thin but soft fabric."
4.0,"This dress was very cute on my mother. However, its so light weight that on a windy day it left nothing to the imagination! Myself and friends watched as a gust of wind blew the back of her dress up revealing the white stain bloomers she wore. I'm not sure if a smaller size would have made it a little more fitted, but I would have liked it to not look so big at the bottom. she has broad shoulders so the top fit her well. Perhaps the wise lady that say its more for teenagers was right and not good for windy days.<br /><br />We did get a good laugh at her expense and proceeded to call her &#34;bloomers&#34; the rest of the day. She had a good attitude about it."
4.0,"My grandkids have these books, and the shirt was a perfect gift. Be aware that they run small (thin). Okay for skinny 9 year old, but not for normal 8 year old. They did however love getting the shirt with the books."
4.0,"As pictured, perfect for mini gifts for friends, colleagues or stocking stuffers. Only negative is I didn't like the patterns. Good value for price."
4.0,"They look really cute. They are a little different to put on, but they are very unique. My daughter loves archery so I'm hoping they will be a big hit this Christmas."
4.0,I love this phone case but it is not quite deep enough to put the magnetic closure over an iPhone 6. I have to put the cellphone in the<br />open slide space on the other side.  It would be good if the case could be made deeper. It's very pretty and nice to carry around<br />instead of a rubber or canvas phone case.
4.0,They keep my feet pretty warm when worn as a base layer. The texture is a little weird tho.
4.0,"This dress felt too short for me. I was afraid that I would make the wrong move and show my underwear to the world - in the FRONT. On me anyway, this was shorter in the front than the back. I guess that’s in style? But I really just cared that the front was so much shorter. I tried a few colors. The grape was pretty. The champagne was horrible for me - I am pretty pale and the champagne color washed me out and I looked kind of undead. I bet it would be pretty on different skin tones though?"
4.0,"They are fitted, for sure. I’m 5’3” With a muscular build and I bought a large. The sleeves are shorter than I expected. Not a total deal breaker. I love the 3 pk option."
4.0,"It’s beautiful, no doubt but was a Lille disappointed about the back. It looks used"
4.0,"Fits good, but i have a long torso and its really short in length. I was very excited when i first got it, but now it rides to much and is kinda uncomfortable. Good quality though and the material seems like it would last a long time."
4.0,"This is a lovely necklace that I get a lot of compliments on.  I think it looks a little plasticy, but still looks nice."
4.0,Its skittle big
4.0,"Although I haven't been used the luggage yet,  the quality of the luggage appears to be quite high.  The compartment for your laptop is a really nice feature.  The zippers are good quality and move  smoothly."
4.0,"I ordered this shirt in a larger size than I would wear and it fits fine. It is a pull over and not button up. It is very thin but I also expected this as well I got this during a flash sale so I ordered 3 but only received 1. As far as the shirt it is what I expected yes it say's loose fit but ordering a much larger size it is not loose but more of a tailored fit. I liked the white color but was going to try a dye technique on one of them If they had sent all 3 I would have given this 5 stars, but I have ordered tops and dresses from china before and they are always two or three sizes smaller than American size stated. The one I got looks cute on. ALWAYS ORDER at least 3 sizes larger than you need. They run very very small.<br /> Update seller sent the other two.<br /><br />I ordered this during a flash sale with no review asked for. But I do count on Amazon reviews and try to review all I order and update as needed. Do not order more than one in the same order. I have contacted the company and will update if they send the rest of my order."
4.0,"I blame myself for not paying more attention, I did want silky/shiny masks, I was hoping for thinner and less tent like. Though the shape does keep it out of my mouth, so there’s a plus."
4.0,"I really like this dress because it's so comfortable but my husband noticed that the dart on the bust made it look like my nipple was poking through. It could just be that I'm smaller chested so there was some extra fabric that bunched up there. Anyway, I didn't want to wear a dress like that so I returned it but I highly recommend you try it! It's soft and flowy but not thin fabric- you feel like you have good coverage and are wearing a quality dress. FYI- I'm 5'4&#34; 155 lbs and wear a 34B."
4.0,Not a bad looking watch.  Kinda has Rolex vibes but the feel is a bit light.
4.0,The hoop must have fallen out of the packaging. Looking forward to the replacement :)
4.0,"works fine, band is wide & a little loose, but better than too tight.  seems to keep good time, only had it for a month, no problems."
4.0,I give it 4 stars because the thread is coming off from the front after 2 washes already.  The style is very very comfortable and cute for summer.  If they sew them in a better quality that would be perfect.
4.0,"This lacey goth hoodie was well constructed and reminded me of items I used to be able to purchase from the popular ""alternative fashion store"" in the mall. It was form fitting and stretchy so its comfortable to wear around the house. I would say the lace around the hands might be over a little ""over decoration"" in that it makes doing every day house things more of a challenge unless you roll your sleeves up while cooking and cleaning. Would say also to double bow the lace so it doesn't come undone. Otherwise, I love this hoodie a lot and will be wearing around the house, and around for the holiday season."
4.0,Little small for a XXX size
4.0,Great t-shirt but too small for me.  I have then to my brother in law. He loves them.
4.0,Very nice wallet. Only draw back I should have considered before is that you can't stick your credit card back in it while in your purse since its a tri-fold. That is my over look though. Other then that it is very nice and well built.
4.0,"I like them, I wish they were thinner."
4.0,It fits good. I suggest wearing a nude color undergarment with it. It is comfortable and durable. I wear it showing  cattle and it holds up very good. Would recommend
4.0,Cute. Runs small.
4.0,"Nice material, they fit and grippers work well. A little pricy for what you get though"
4.0,It would be five stars if it just had 1 inch more length in the torso just a smidge snug in the length. I generally have trouble with that.<br /><br />Love the coverage plenty comfortable to enjoy playing with my boys at the beach but it still has a stylish cut so I don’t feel frumpy.<br /><br />I’m 5’4” 165lb and ordered a large in black. I may have to order the red as well!
4.0,"It's polyester instead of cotton, so if feels a little different.  But it doesn't get ""soggy"" with log wear.  The loops are elastic and fit well but not adjustable as claimed.  The pattern is also identical to the one pictured, which I found awesome  Only a 4 because Im not sure a non-cotton mask is ideal."
4.0,It would have gotten 5 stars but the loops for the tie around the wast is a little high and the tie it self could be a little longer
4.0,"Definitely cheap &#34;leather&#34;, but I bought it for a costume and it does the job. It's not scratchy, it looks exactly like the photo, and it fits me! I'm average height and a little chubby and I can use the smallest and middle snaps comfortably."
4.0,I loved the very good quality material.
4.0,Gotta be thicker
4.0,"Cute t shirt for a casual look. I wear a large, but ordered the XL for a little roominess. So glad I did, the large would have been way too small."
4.0,"Super trendy and great price.  However, I think that they are more suited for younger generations then me.  However, the quality is great and they are well-made."
4.0,I wanted comfortable bras without being a sports bra or a regular full cup underwire.  This is perfect?  I am a 40B and this fit perfectly.  It is not too lacy to be seen through a shirt.  Really like it.
4.0,Fits a little tighter than I wanted it to and I got a size larger than I usually per the review suggestions. It sure is warm though.
4.0,"This shirt is exactly as pictured. The coloring is as pictured. The fit is a tad loose and a tad long. The zippers seem sturdy enough currently but it is a new shirt. If i remember, I will update this review if needed. The shirt is flowy but not the most comfortable."
4.0,"Bare bones, but a great jacket if you don't want all the bells and whistles, like venting."
4.0,"Fits various head shapes and sizes, filters are easy to switch, but it isn't comfortable. Rough material and rigid form. Will keep as a backup."
4.0,"Nice fabric, runs very long, love the pockets"
4.0,Beautiful bag. My only issue is the handles are to little. I can only carry it around my shoulder with the long strap on. Otherwise very good purse
4.0,"Granted I should of ordered a large being 7 months pregnant at the time. The flower design looked overwhelming on me. Pretty dress, just wasn't for me."
4.0,"I was expecting small stones and would have preferred that, but they are still nice and go well with a suprizing number of items."
4.0,The rings are a little smaller in diameter than I expected but still fit and still cute!
4.0,"We ordered multiple sizes and styles of these pants from different sellers. The quality is very good (thick, warm) but these particular pants run short. The sizing from seller to seller is inconsistent. From this seller, a size 8-9 years ordered resulted in a size Small that arrived in the mail. (The same age size ordered from another seller resulted in a Medium). The 8-9 years/Smalls were much too short (18"" inseam) and narrow in the waist (11"" laid flat, so roughly 22"" around). The size 10-12 years = size Medium, fit our size slim, size 8 child except in the length. (12.5"" waist laid flat, 20.5"" inseam). If you can get the sizing right, I do recommend them."
4.0,I like my pocketbook. It could been little bigger
4.0,Love these!!!  I use these for reading in bed.  They do not hurt your ears if you fall asleep while reading.  One issue or it would be 5 stars.  The lenses pop out too often.  Fix that issue and it is 5 Stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
4.0,I bought it for my son. We'll see how it goes before I make any remarks on the quality. My son is very impressed with it.<br />thx<br />de lamb
4.0,These leggings have a nice feel to them. I wore them around the house and they didn't lose their shape or start to sag. The fit in the abdomen is a little big but overall I am very pleased with these pants. They are comfy. I plan on wearing them under my jeans this winter as well as for working out.
4.0,I did receive the wrong product at first but shipping back and getting the correct product was easy. Once they came I was satisfied.
4.0,"This is a long, slim, ✏️-fit skirt.  Very stretchy.  I wear it with an oversized black sweatshirt and white tennis shoes.  This a very casual skirt - sporty."
4.0,"These looks great with boots, hold their shape and wash well.  Very pleased with the value."
4.0,"Good product for the price. They are comfortable, cool and keep the sun off. I am a woman (not a large woman) and I ordered a medium. They are very snug.  They are snug but fine once on, but it's a tight fit getting them on."
4.0,"She looks, absolutely beautiful, I love it and want it to be available in more colors,I love she looks Gorgeous!!! She wants in color black"
4.0,Very beautiful colors in stone. Comfortable fit. Wish they were a little larger.
4.0,Very nice but a little thin not as sturdy as IZ would like but looks good on.
4.0,"Thinner material, which makes it lightweight and cool, but it is also sturdy.  Adjustable makes makes it easy to fit anyone.  String are long enough for even larger individuals to use it."
4.0,"Seller was fast and professional.  Socks do smell a bit right out of the package and the smell diminished just slightly after washing, so if you are sensitive to such things, you have been warned.  Other than that, they fit great and wear great.  I would definitely buy more."
4.0,Good Value!
4.0,"One large adult-sized mask comes in this package along with some full-faced filters I have never seen before. The mask is made of a soft cotton, is somewhat form fitting, and has pockets on the inside for the filter. The ear elastics are comfortable and there is a nose wire in the top for a securer fit. With the filter this mask is 4-ply from what I can tell. The filter is 2-ply and the mask is also 2-ply. I actually love this set but the current price of $14 for one cotton mask with 10 filters is a bit pricey. My local big box store sells 10 black masks like these for $12.99 (no filters)."
4.0,"I bought these December 2014 for my 8 year old.<br /><br />We live in a cold climate and mittens keep your fingers a lot warmer than gloves. These are quality snow gloves, they have a waterproof and Thinsulate layers that keep hands warm and dry. I've been impressed with the quality. These were bought to match a coat, and hopefully make it through 2 kids. The color match to the coat wasn't exact, but close enough.<br /><br />The gloves out lived the coat. They are still in excellent shape, which is a surprise considering we play outside roughly an hour a day all winter long and kids use there hands to get into everything. The lighter color on the back of the hand makes it easy to write our last name boldly across them so that if misplaced at school they can be easily located.<br /><br />If you have any questions please comment and I will be happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability."
4.0,somewhat smaller than i hoped but still looked really cute
4.0,Came well packaged. Does have a little smell to it. It runs small though.
4.0,"I love the color, but I did return it"
4.0,"Nice dress, comfortable, fits, pockets small they are higher up on the dress. Dress does not look good on me for my body type will be returning unfortunately."
4.0,"Looks like the picture. The lining is a bit on the thin side, and as mentioned in other reviews, the straps look like they might not hold up to wear and tear where they are attached to the purse. I have been using it for only a few days, so I guess we see how long it will hold up."
4.0,For the most part Resistol hats run true to size. This hat is easy to reshape and has held its new shape very well. It is lightweight and breathes very well. I own several hats inculding two of these. One for summer and one sized larger to accommodate a beanie in winter. Great value and function.
4.0,This is a very nice skirt. The quality is very good!
4.0,"I thought that it was very nicely made. It is a little stiff, but I'm sure it will soften up the more I use it."
4.0,"I love this dress and the material! Based on past sizing experiences, I ordered an extra large and it was way too large. As soon as the two others I ordered in different colors come, I am going to return these and reorder in a medium. I ordered the three at the same time to get a 20% discount. I can't wait til the others come so I can return and reorder in the right size."
4.0,I love the color and style. But I was expecting a thicker sweater. This doesn't keep the cold out. So guess I'll keep looking for a thicker sweater. Perfect for spring weather.
4.0,"I'll throw 4 stars to this piece. I saw some people complaining about it after machine washing...not something I'd recommend or do. 14 bux is a lot to spend on a 42&#34;x42&#34; piece of cloth, that's why I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Quality is good enough, but I can see where the threads may come apart if used harshly or subjected to machine washing. There are probably better quality keffyas out there, but yer gonna pay a bunch more. Get 3 or 4 of these and rotate 'em. Hand wash...you'll be happy."
4.0,Nice blouse but very small
4.0,"I wear jewelry everyday, but I really like a simple classic look.  This set is so versatile,  there are so many different combinations, that it is easy to find one that fits that days clothing and activities.  The quality was surprisingly good for the price.  I would definitely order again if a new variety set was offered.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because my favorite one of the bunch (the one with the pearl) broke right out of the package.  Almost all of them are truly choker necklaces, but I added an extender to have the fit be more as shown in the photos.  One of the necklaces is long and is not a choker...which was an added bonus."
4.0,Very cute earrings but did not last more than a few days. Granted I did gift them to a 10 year old but after she put them on the second time the post snapped off.
4.0,"Not as stretchy as I was hoping, but super cute & great support!  I love the scrappiness of the back & how well it holds me in while I workout, but it was a little more difficult to get in & out of it, due to the lack of stretchiness.  Overall though, I like it & would recommend it.  PS - I usually wear small - medium shirts & I ordered a medium bra.  It fits nicely!"
4.0,This is a cute dress.  It will need to be steamed or ironed before wearing.  The material leaves a little to be desired but honestly for the price it's a good buy.  I'm excited to wear it with a black kimono over top.
4.0,"When I opened it, there were a few of the plastic beads that had really rough edges on them that would snag - I used clippers and cut those off and filed them down with my emery board - it's a cheap bracelet, but cute with jeans, casual attire."
4.0,Nice variety in the pack- all the “ballet” colors
4.0,"Expectations met on item. Isn't the best quality, but you get what you pay for."
4.0,Love it!!!  Had to remove links wearing it now.
4.0,"Great, don t tarnish and nice design. Inox is a good trnd design brand. Plus, being sandblasted, they do not scratch either."
4.0,"These leggings are not bad for the price (about $15.99).<br /><br />Reasonably good quality, not see-through, good fit, nice feel.<br /><br />They are the 'second-skin' type, but nothing embarrassing.<br /><br />Noted a tendency for minor 'pilling'.<br /><br />For large and/or muscular buttocks, the 'scrunchy' feature could be a bonus, it definitely has effect.<br /><br />Not a bad budget pair of leggings."
4.0,"Beautiful top, well made with thicker t-shirt material and very comfortable.  Took a star off because of the color, I ordered gray but it's more a blue/purple gray."
4.0,"Nice, but runs small in the sleeves; either that or I need to lose weight"
4.0,"It is a great gift, my sister loved it, but the material was some kind of soft aluminium that was easily bended, but after that it was good."
4.0,"I like the design and how the case feels - matted black and sleek. The cloth is a little stiff, but, it works. Looks exactly as pictured. My glasses fit nicely. Only thing I am not too fond of is that the clamp to keep the case closed doesn't feel to strong."
4.0,"I was very surprised by how nice this dress turned out. I usually don't like synthetic fibers, but this dress is so cute and the fabric is silky and nice that I am willing to overlook my fiber snobbery. The biggest plus about this dress is that it's very figure-flattering and can be dressed up or down. It does run small so considering ordering up a size. In conclusion, I am very pleased with this and plan to wear it many times this season."
4.0,"Not a level 4- there is still bounce, but super comfortable! I ordered a band size up and my regular cup size. I wish it came with some extra fabric to hide the headlights, but even though I really need a compression workout bra I'm keeping this one for hot yoga adn power walking.  it's easy to get on and off and I can wear it all day.<br /><br />I also ordered a cup smaller to see if that solved the bounce issue but it did not."
4.0,Very cute and adorable! Ordered the smallest size cause I didn’t want it too oversized. Looks a bit weird when placed correctly but v cute a little bit farther down my nose
4.0,"These are really comfortable, a little sportier than I expected (I purchased for lounging) but overall happy with them!"
4.0,"Great ear piece while I had it! Lost it cause it's so damn small, but that's not the company's fault. However? The price is a little extreme. Most? Probably $6 or something. I bought this thing for twice that amount at the time."
4.0,"I got these for me and my long distance best friend and we absolutely love them! I have the gold one and she has the silver, so far she hasn’t told me anything bad about her silver moon. But my gold sun one does have a little discolor to it! Other then that they are so cute!"
4.0,"This is a very cool watch to give someone who loves stars or collects watches. The only thing I wish I would have realized is that it is a manual, wind up watch. I still love the product."
4.0,My type of hats. Cannot wait for the summer collection.
4.0,Very comfortable dress.  Not as thick as I would as liked but it isn't see through.  I did get a dark color so I can't say what a lighter color is like.  The pockets are really nice they hold a cell phone with no problems.
4.0,"Tried on, haven't worn yet to swim. The thigh area is a bit snug. If I had gone one size up it probably wouldn't have fit though. I'm normally either a medium or large, got the XL which equals a 8/10 basically in US sizing."
4.0,"Used at the gym today. I bought this because I needed a headband that doesn't slide and is comfortable to keep my funny baby hairs sticking out ( I wear ponytail when I'm exercising / jogging on the treadmill ). It did exactly what I intended it for.<br /><br />Perfect width, not crazy wide like other bands<br />Quality is great<br />Didn't slip or slide<br />Perfect fit for my normal size head, comfortable<br />Absorbs sweat from running from my forehead to my face<br /><br />4 stars because it's expensive compared to other bands. Otherwise, I'd buy other different colors"
4.0,"I would have given it a 5 star rating but the big draw back is, this thing is nearly impossible to get on by yourself. However, the quality is amazing and it is different than what I have seen out there."
4.0,"The pop-beads were smaller than I'd expected, about as big around as my fingernail, maybe 1/2"" in diameter. I was hoping for something a little bigger (thumbnail size maybe) for my costume, but they did the job and stayed together all evening. The beads are fairly white and have a nice sheen to them that makes them pearlescent. I was able to make a necklace and a bracelet out of half the beads that came in the package, and there was a fair amount left over. Some of the beads were hard to pop together, but not too bad, and my 8 year old loved helping. Pretty good quality beads, and they didn't look totally cheap."
4.0,"Super cute! However, the buckle gets scratches very easily."
4.0,Omg.... these are so cute. Didn't have my size so I bought larger and got them taken in.
4.0,comfy and cool
4.0,I like the material. And it fits perfect
4.0,"I have yet to find a ""smart watch"" that I really like, but that being said, this might be the best of the few that I have tried (never had an Apple watch).<br /><br />The thing I like most about this watch is it isn't quite as bulky and obtrusive as others I have used.<br /><br />My biggest complaint, as usual with smart watches, is that it needs to be charged once a day - when exactly are we supposed to do this?  A watch, especially a smart one, is probably most useful at night, when you wake up and want to know what time it is, or what your resting pulse is.  So maybe you need two smart watches: one to wear while the other is being charged.<br /><br />Working from home during this pandemic quarantine, we use google chat a lot, and it's amusing to get a buzz on my wrist anytime anyone types anything in chat.<br /><br />I find the user interface on this watch to be a bit baffling.  I suppose somewhere there is a manual I should read, but having said that, I firmly believe that no user appliance should necessitate reading an instruction manual to use it.<br /><br />It's funny to see it display my pulse.  Google has acquired FitBit and this watch is a FitBit device, if that is useful to you.<br /><br />I managed to install Spotify on the watch but I have no idea what the Spotify app on the watch is supposed to do.  As far as I can tell, the only thing the app can do is connect to my iPhone, but for what purpose I have no idea."
4.0,"Unfortunately, no soft shoes provide good arch support. These soft shoes have some of the best padding, and they feel much better on my feet than Rutherfords and Fay's. The shoes are still too narrow. My feet are wide, but if I get too large a size the length of the shoe will not work for my foot.<br /><br />Recommend Ryan and O-donnell sell wide soft shoes."
4.0,At first the wallet was a little tight. But soon it stretched and is fine.
4.0,These look super good and are lightweight but they were bigger then I thought they would be but worked out well for the costume
4.0,Very cute dress for the price.  Had to sew a few seams but overall liked the fit
4.0,I have them in Yellow too &<br />Love them!
4.0,"This was a surprising find, really pretty and looks expensive.  Can be worn and used so many ways, be creative ladies"
4.0,Good alternative to my handmade ones for craft fairs. More inexpensive than Zi can make myself!
4.0,"Very large, impressive-looking necklace.  It went very well with the &#34;ancient world&#34; costume that I bought it to accent."
4.0,"I’m usually a medium but I ordered a large and it fit perfect. Definitely size up. The only complaint I have is that the top kept coming up, so I had to continuously pull it down, which was really annoying and worried me a little. But overall, great suit for the price."
4.0,Turned finger green but they are lovely in color and I got alot of compliments.
4.0,"They make a lot of noise when you walk, but they definitely do the job of holding it all in. If you don't mind that &#34;swish-swish&#34; noise, I highly recommend them."
4.0,tight around the upper part and my legs aren't that big
4.0,"For the price, was excellent. Bought it for a costume. Definitely runs small, but was fine for my use. Also smells pretty plasticy, but looks nice."
4.0,"I ordered both the long-sleeved and short-sleeved versions of this dress because I wasn't sure which one I'd need. They were made a bit differently– the long-sleeved one has a longer waist, a zipper back, and isn't as stretchy in the top area. I'm short waisted and like higher waisted stuff, so I kept the shorter one. Both are cute, though! :)"
4.0,"This is a nice dress, good for wearing to work, worship or everyday for someone who likes dresses.  It should be nice and warm in the fall, because it is 95% polyester, and.reasonably thick.  I am not very fond of the material, which looks polyester, but the dress looks nice, so I will keep it.  However, I went by the chart, and even though I am usually a size 6 to 8, I’’d gained about five pounds and it all went to my waist, so looking at the size chart, at 5’ 3”, with a 35” bust, and 29” waist, even though I weigh 120, I chose a large, where most of my clothes are mediums.  It is quite form fitting and looks lovely.  I could not have looked good in a medium unless it was much stretcher than the dress seeems."
4.0,Not the best quality but for the price they are great.
4.0,"Far better made than I expected for the price. This dress is a beaded mesh over an unfortunately short slip. Because of the scallops on the bottom, the slip stops a good three inches before the skirt does, and it climbs as you move. I'm uploading pictures to show where it hits me standing still. I'm 5'7&#34;, 140lbs, 36/30/39 and bought a medium. It's a bit big in the waist and fits like a tee shirt for the most part. Not really a flattering dress, but it's wonderful fun to wear with the swing of that silky fringe and the well-beaded glitter. The pattern of beading is consistent and even (unlike other Chinese dresses I've purchased) and looks like the picture. I'd have to say for the price this is fantastic.  It is a bit lumpy down the side seams on me because of where it hits my body shape, but again, with this price point, it's just fine and is a great costume piece.  I will still be relining it for opacity, because the mesh is completely see-through and the slip is also very thin; you can clearly see the lines of undergarments. It looks like the same dress pictured on the sale page. I'm quite pleased."
4.0,"If the pendant were larger I would have given it 5 stars. That said, it is a beautiful quality piece."
4.0,Wish these came in a smaller size. These are too big for me to do anything in. I like the style and they are snug enough to prevent water from getting in.  Just too big.
4.0,The off the shoulder doesn't really stay put.  I like the quality though.
4.0,Was exactly what i was looking for. A sleeveless turtleneck for under sweaters without the neck being baggy. Fit was perfect!
4.0,Nice but doesn't have the thumb holes to keep your hands kinda warm when it's cold out
4.0,Cute teacher gift ordered 5 product came in good condition
4.0,I am giving this as a house warming gift to improve my friends new home's energy.  The glass tray is red and barely will hold all the stones.  They included a detailed description on each stone's meaning and how to best use them which will be greatly appreciated by my friend who knows very little about feng shui.  I received 5 stones instead of the 4 shown.  I just wish the tray was bigger so the stones aren't so cramped.
4.0,"I bought it for my 10 year old to dress up as Abe Lincoln for a school presentation-- it's a bit big for him, but would be a good hat for an adult."
4.0,Makes bike riding a bit more pleasurable
4.0,"Not as finished as the original, but would do for the price. It has a slight stretch which I like, and it’s comfortable to wear everyday."
4.0,Not exactly the flawless look I was hoping for When spending $30 on a rubber ring. They are much smaller than I expected.
4.0,"Love my new pair of slippers (I own too many to count) they are a tad small, but I wear super thick socks all the time- so my fault. Super cute and fun to wear. Also very comfortable. GO BRONCOS!!!!"
4.0,The dress just fit strange on my daughter.
4.0,"I absolutely love these dresses, I bought three of them, the mauve, pink, and coffee colors all in large. This coffee colored one fits smaller than the other two. The under slip barely hits my thighs mid way, and is tighter around the ribs. The waist material is stretchy so I would not size up. My main complaint is the under slip being so short, I was constantly pulling on it as the dress would be see through without it."
4.0,"I got my bracelet and like the color of the blue and the charms on there.  There is an owl, a bird on a branch, and a infinity symbol.  When you put it on it looks like a wrap bracelet.  Only reason I gave it a 4 is the clasp came undone the first day I wore it, I then had to fix it.  Hoping it doesn't break again.  I wouldn't wear it in the shower as it is only costume jewelry."
4.0,Value for price
4.0,I love it ....it's so bright metallic royal blue and it fits  perfectly .....it's not 5  stars  because if you have a  bigger neck  It will NOT fit ....
4.0,Will do its purpose to cover nose and mouth stops there a lil above chin rockin color  comfortable so far wore it for an hour-  thank Godness don't have to venture out hus yet
4.0,Great fit!! Wish it was a bit longer and a warmer material. Overall dress is great for fall with a sweater!!!
4.0,"This spray is easy to use and works well at least for a couple of days between applications, depending on other exposures (I get puppy nose spots on mine and have to clean them frequently) 😂"
4.0,"I had to return the medium as it is tight at the toes for one who usually wears medium. I returned them and just reorder a Large. Got them today and fit much better, but beware you may have to go up one size. Comfy and Happy!UPDATE: ahh dont know why i deducted 1 star, these are FIVE stars! ;)Everybody thought they cool!"
4.0,"OK so first off, just look at the print, it's too adorable! Looks just like it does online in person. I bought the one with yellow up top and blue on bottom. I have no issues with the quality or appearance of the top. The only issue lies in the sizing. Before selecting a size, you should know this is absolutely a junior's top! I'm 5'8&#34;, 145# and bought a size XL. It fits me but the sleeves are a touch too short on me and it could also be a touch longer. (See photo, I'm also wearing a colored tank underneath) But it's to be expected with junior's items. So just remember to size way up on this item and you'll likely be fine. Had they offered an XXL or XXXL, I probably would have ordered one of those sizes to have it fit a bit over-sized vs just fitting me so keep that in mind too. Definitely do NOT put in the dryer!"
4.0,"The material is thin, but I expected it would be. This is a good value for the price. The pockets are well placed."
4.0,"This pendant is very pretty and I love the vintage look with the magnifying glass behind it, the glass is clear and works very nice. But be prepared to wait as this did take over a month to get."
4.0,"Somewhat tight in the arms, but i love the style."
4.0,"These are cute, just make sure to order one or two sizes up. I usually wear a medium so I ordered a large and it was still a lil tight"
4.0,Wow! A really nice fit. My only complaint is that it’s really low in front. That’s why only 4 stars. I’m going to use a cami insert for that issue. Very pleased with this purchase.
4.0,needed bigger size..nice pants
4.0,Very cute but smaller than I expected
4.0,These ankle boots are very good looking and nice color.
4.0,"So cute. However, pants are a lot bigger than the shirt."
4.0,Great cheap dress
4.0,Very cute...but like the other reviews said it is very stiff.
4.0,One of the better quality clothing items I have purchased on Amazon.
4.0,Polish people need this. Drinking is optional.
4.0,"These look great and are very comfortable. The color is really cute and great for the sunniest days here in Texas. I don't caremuch for the sunglass case and wish they'd given a cloth for easy cleaning but overall, it's a great product"
4.0,I really like these slippers. I use them for the pool and they are very comfortable. They seem to be made well and are definitely worth the money. They do run big so order (at least) one full size smaller than your regular size.
4.0,"A mi hija le encantó, lindo diseño y juvenil."
4.0,nice sunglass
4.0,this is a really cool looking watch like another post above said the picture doesn't do it justice. However I would recommend this watch only for an adult male it is on the bulky side and it's rather large. But that might be a good thing because it might be durable I've only had it for a week so time will tell. But other than its size it's a really cool.I took a star away for its bulkiness.
4.0,i had the old school prints of anime...plastik....ranma 1/2 iron on.<br />came fast and got what i expected. good for a party or con. good idea<br />again.
4.0,I really like this case. The marble print looks nice and it protected my phone from many drops. I would prefer if the marble had stronger veining but that's just me being not picky. I wouldn't recommend getting the white bumper because it doesn't stay white very long and it's a bit hard to clean. For the price this case is great but I would recommend getting the black or teal bumper.
4.0,"I wrote the size as fitting too small, as I am normally a 28 band in Panache, a 30 band in shock absorber and wear a 32 band in this bra... however, that being said: I have used it and abused it and for the most part it is just as good as shock absorber.  I will say, I have noticed that despite the fact that the cup fits perfectly I do seem to jiggle more in this one than in the SA's, however, I am also larger than I was last time I wore a SA bra so that can be taken with a grain of salt.  Washing and drying and doing everything you're not supposed to with bras, it's still alive and well and works for running, cycling and day-to-day activity so I'd say overall it's a good purchase!"
4.0,obviously not real stones
4.0,"It only took about a week for it to arrive and it was well packaged.<br />It is made of a durable material and the color was true to the picture. The top is somewhat adjustable but none of the straps are sewn in so be careful not to pull them out of the clasps when adjusting, it wouldn't take much to sew them in place once you have it on comfortably. The cups in the top are a firm thick padding and the bottoms  are sewn together well.<br />As for sizing...I am 5 ft 4in and roughly 120 lbs I have an athletic (boyish) not so curvy build and I am a 34 b cup. I am normally a 3/4 in U.S sizes and I ordered a medium. The top is just a little big not so much that it looks funny but I probably would have done better with a small. The bottoms I recieved were made for someone built like a Kardashian, if you have a booty they would likely fit fine but I had to make some adjustments to get them to fit (and they cover my butt completely), again I might have done better with a smaller size but I am not at all unhappy with the purchase I will likely be ordering another in a smaller size for comparison. The pictures ive included are AFTER the adjustments were made to the bottoms."
4.0,"This may say Women's but its more of a Junior size. It fit my slender 14 year old daughter nicely. This is made very well, nice stitch work and beautiful design. Love the feel of the fabric and really wish it would fit me. I would have given this a 5 Star and a big thumbs up if the sizing were rite. If you are thinking of buying this item (especially if you are bigger on top) then maybe trying 2 sizes higher than you normally would.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product from the seller for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, good or bad.

4.0,"This is a very nice case. I use it for a wallet on most days and an ID/business card holder when I'm out on business. There are two elastic straps - that are detachable - on each of the insides. It holds money/cards well, and you can put quite a bit of stuff in it.<br /><br />Con: Sometimes the cards are &#34;difficult&#34; (read: not fast enough) to get out. Credit type cards come right up to the inside edge walls of the case. So it can be &#34;difficult&#34; to get your finger underneath a card and pull it out. I say &#34;difficult&#34; because it could be easier and I don't like fuddling around with it when I'm in a checkout or trying to hand someone a card. Though the elastic straps can come out so that you can get a card and put them back in, I'd prefer something faster. Something like a little bump in the middle of the inside so that you can push the edge of a card down and the other end tips up just a little for you to grab - that would be a great improvement!"
4.0,Work great.  On my back after eye surgery.  Enjoy watching  TV using them.  Unable to make them work very well for reading.
4.0,Wish the wrap straps were longer but dress and material are perfect
4.0,If i could just get these in real diamonds ....
4.0,"This is a very nice shirt.  I think it looks really good on me.  The quality is great and the fit is perfect (I wear a medium).<br /><br />The down side is that the fabric is a bit on the harsh side.  its not ""bad"" but its no where near as soft was my ""plaid"" shirts from the gap.  This is even after a washing.  Perhaps after many washings it will be better, but my Gap plaid shirt was softer right from the beginning.<br /><br />Its 97% cotton and 3% spandex.  It warns to wash with similar colors only and that colors may bleed.  I washed in cold water out of habit and it did not shrink much if at all."
4.0,"Beautiful earings perfect weight and very nicely crafted. They  come in a nice pouch , perfect for a gift."
4.0,A little shorter than I expected (I’m 5’3” and it’s pretty short for work in an office). Definitely cheap material but you get what you pay for.
4.0,"For travel carrying small items like cell phone, wallet, keys and bills."
4.0,Love the short and design but the large seems more like a medium if that.
4.0,Overall the product was really nice. Packaged very nicely and was given two additional bands to put on if needed. Kept the Apple Watch dry when submerged in water. Only downfall was that it is pretty big on my wrist. Which made my hand a little uncomfortable.
4.0,Very very soft material.  I love the flow of the shirt.  A little long on a short framed girl like me (I'm 5'1) but not too bad.  Hits about mid thigh.
4.0,Overall I do like the shirt and it is a great basic to have in the closet. Only thing is that it can be a bit stiff. I don’t mind the outside seams at all and I like the slit on the sides of the shirt.
4.0,"Pretty fair product for the price. I had to bend a few metal pieces into place, but they did not break when I did this. Very cute. I'd buy more."
4.0,"Super cute sunglasses, but they seem a bit fragile, I'm a little afraid about breaking them. The UV/Polarization seems pretty weak, but I guess you get what you pay for. Otherwise, they are really cute."
4.0,"Living in south Texas where it is so very sunny mostly year-round, I  have had a chance to enjoy this a lot. It arrived earlier than expected, but with a badly creased bill. I steamed and blocked the bill and have been able to enjoy its shade since."
4.0,Looks good and a nice reasonable price too
4.0,This dress helped pull our family pictures together but was a little big. Had to safety pin the waist.
4.0,Very cute outfit the pants didn't fit like tights they were more like wide leg pants and short
4.0,These look pretty good but the lens leave a funky vision as though they are not flat
4.0,These hematite magnetic beads are great and can’t beat the price but they can fall apart after much wearing because they’re held together by an elastic.
4.0,"Great product-as another reviewer stated, there isn't much length compression in this tree compared to other brands, so it is kinda tough to get into my boots.  Works great on a pair of loafers, though!"
4.0,The sweater is soft inside and thick but ran 2 sizes to small. I ordered a 1x and Fit more like a large. Aside from that I loved it
4.0,Great size.  Perfect stretch. I like it.
4.0,Very cute and true to color & size-happy with purchase.
4.0,I like every about this dress. I got a size larger because of the fabric.
4.0,Giving this product as a gift
4.0,"I ordered 2 Flash STAR Labs sweatshirts from Absolute Cult Ltd for my daughter's birthday because when I ordered the first one I thought I was ordering black, but when I got my order confirmation it showed the color as navy blue. I take responsibility for this one because as you click on the 2 pictures of the girls wearing the shirt it changes the color you order. I panicked and quickly ordered a black one. It didn't arrive by her birthday and it too was navy blue. My order confirmation clearly shows its suppose to be black, but the packing slip clearly shows it is navy blue. The second shirt did arrive within the shipping date range, but unfortunately because I needed to order the 2nd one in black, it didn't arrive by her birthday. My daughter loves both of them, but unfortunately I struck out twice with the black one."
4.0,"This is a nice piece. I really don't see how you could fit a picture in it but it looks very nice on the wrist. I haven't had it long enough to say how it will wear, For the money a good buy."
4.0,"lighter weight than I expected, but that's okay."
4.0,Was a gift for my dad he loved it !
4.0,This swim suit is made of great material for the price. It fits perfectly except I took one star off this review as it does feel on the long side for my torso. I am 5&#34;5 and weigh around 155. I purchased the xxl but feel I should have maybe ordered the xl not sure. Shipping was fast ordered it on Sunday and got it Tuesday with prime. Either way I do feel nothing will come out of this suit and satisfied with the purchase.
4.0,"Nice opal studs, the gold is a bit close to silver though"
4.0,"Great backpack. The material is durable and quality. All of the pockets are great and the straps are comfortable. I'm very satisfied with my decision to get this bag. I'm not sure about the durability of the lock, so far nobody has tried to breach it, but with that said it's a great deterrent none the less."
4.0,Got this for costume. Fit and quality was good
4.0,"Love this shirt and plan to buy different colors. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I ordered the white and it’s extremely see through. I had to wear a tank under it. Otherwise, great buy!"
4.0,"This jacket is really stunning, it just needs a steaming to get the wrinkles out.<br /><br />This jacket has a very flattering shape and cut. My partner is 6' tall and the sleeves and bottom length both work really well on her. The jacket is soft and flexible with a nice satin lining, all of which make it very comfortable to wear. The zipper also slid nice and smooth with no catching.<br /><br />A really nice and stylish jacket you can wear with many different types of outfits."
4.0,"It was a mistake for me to buy oversized retro round glasses. I feel like I have a bug face. They are made well, just not for me."
4.0,Definitely super small and hard to get pictures in. Cute though.
4.0,"Love the color, just wish had a change pocket"
4.0,They are ok...material is the shinny fabric...I prefer the other..flare bottom is a bit larger then I like too.
4.0,"Very light/think fabric. Comfortable with, surprisingly, Pockets !<br />I'm 5'4&#34;,120lbs and the Small fits properly."
4.0,"I think it’s a little bit cheap looking but it also doesn’t cost much. It’s very sparkly. The bands are sort of curvy around the stone in a way I wasn’t expecting, but overall I like it a lot."
4.0,"I've rated these three stars because while they are good for the way I am using them (combined with a handle grip) the info is still visible through the tag itself, and sometimes the flap that goes over the written info opens. Otherwise I am happy with the build quality of the tag itself and the ring that attaches to the suitcase, both are durable."
4.0,Item as described.  Fun batman silk like robe.
4.0,"Fits as it does in the photograph. Comfortable, casual dress."
4.0,"I went with the red lenses. The frame feels sturdy, with the arms opening up wide to fit a larger head. They look nice. My long eyelashes don't touch the lenses at all. The packaging and the case they come with are all very nice.<br /><br />Cons... They're not very dark. If I was going to be outside all day in bright light, I'd probably wear something else. People can see my eyes. The color I see is is very cool, almost blue, so that's weird. The lenses do move around slightly in the frame, which is audibly noticeable if I move my head quickly or shake the glasses.<br /><br />These can't compete with name brand sunglasses. But, for the $18.68 that I paid for them, they're not bad. Hopefully they prove to be durable."
4.0,"I was really excited when I received my dress but when I opened it the first thing I noticed was that the material was thin which was good because it meant it was light however it is also quite see through. I was discouraged at that point but I tried it on anyway and truly love the fit. I will have to wear proper undergarments but overall I’m happy with my purchase. Typically I buy a large or 12/14, I carry a little extra weight around my mid-section but the dress provides a great fit. I would recommend it."
4.0,"These are really cute tennis shoes. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it didn't even come in a shoe box OR a box at all, so disappointed. This is a Christmas gift and now I'm going to have to try and find a box that they'll fit in."
4.0,Nice glasses. Fits my 8 yr old son perfect
4.0,"It’s the right size, shape and design of the one in the movie. Only thing it’s missing is the density. It’s super thin, not like a real coin on one from the show. It’s as close as you can get without buy one of the special edition props from the show. Those are like $300. I did find one on eBay that was also very close to the show version. Design was not as accurate but it was thick and heavy and also looked like real gold."
4.0,Way more cuter in person but was a little smaller then expected but other then that it's great I love it
4.0,"The color is amazing, fabric seems strong. The sizing system is WAY off, though. I needed to take the entire thing in by two inches on each side before it would fit properly. Once that was done, it was perfect.<br /><br />Definitely order a size down, two sizes if you want a closer fit."
4.0,"Excellent fit of the shirt, delivered earlier than expected. will be an excellent shirt when heading out on the roads to put down some miles."
4.0,this is my second time ordering these for my boyfriend. I've gotten the brown ones before and now I got the black ones. Upon opening them we noticed the zipper was a little broken but he said it was ok and that he'd keep them...well now just a few short months later the zipper won't work at all. He loves these boots and they are very comfortable he said. I'm going to try and see if I can fix the zipper. Other than that these are great boots for a budget.
4.0,"This is a cute little kimono robe. It runs slightly on the small side, so be aware of that if you are built bigger. The fabric is soft and definitely the deep blue you see here in the picture. Nice, I like it!"
4.0,"I like the smiling faces. The quality is fine not excellent but well enough. It came pressed flat. It got back to the shape but not fluffy. It’s not slippery on the tile, soft and comfy when wearing."
4.0,"Super stretchy, comfortable, and cute. I wore a pair of spanx under to help smooth my stomach out but without it my belly would be very prominent. For the price, go for it!"
4.0,"These slip off really easy in the pool, easier than I'd like but they get the job done and are very stylish."
4.0,You have to take one buckle off to fit through pant<br />Belt loop but quick and easy. I like this belt
4.0,"This hoodie was OK I did like the decal on the front, but I did not like how the material was made"
4.0,Bigger than expected. The post is at the top of the lotus making it fall low on my ear. Still cute.
4.0,"It is exactly as pictured. I would prefer about double the size, though. It's rather small."
4.0,"Pretty small, hard to read. Chain real tiny and fragile. But it looks nice."
4.0,"Very ice shirt, but since little brother will be a year old soon, the shirt is too short, but my older grandson can still wear the shirt."
4.0,"Sent back because it wasn't the look I was ultimately going for but the color, fit, stretch, was great.  Wasn't crazy about the way the bust area was, but overall was a nice dress."
4.0,The jacket was a little smaller than expected.
4.0,"Fits as expected, but shoelaces very short For this color"
4.0,"I'm a thin woman, the dress has a nice cut, I also liked the fabric, it's a dress that in relation to the price the quality is good."
4.0,Looks amazing and the material is high quality
4.0,"i like it, it hugs my shape but not too tight.  I sized up like recommended"
4.0,One size will fit almost everyone.  There is quite a bit of stretch in these leggings.  The material is very soft and comfortable.  I'm probably going to purchase more in different colors.  I would recommend these if you want comfort and fit.
4.0,"These earrings were cute but I don't know a thing about 16g, 18g, 20g or whatever. I just see something cute and go with it. Well these were too thick for my ears. Cute but just not my size. I tried to make them work but it just hurt my ears haha. I'm trying to learn it all now because I want an earring for my Helix piercing. I had it done about 20 years ago and I haven't worn an earring in it in years, it stayed so sore even after all these years. Any suggestions yall?"
4.0,Better pins
4.0,Runs a size large. I am 5'3 and it hits right at the knees. Basic t shirt dress not much shape to it. The crimson is definitely crimson not a bright red as shown.
4.0,"It looks very nice and the stitching looks very well made. The only problem I have, is that the hat is very thing, and scratchy on the inside. So on that I was disappointed."
4.0,Good material. Thicker than I expected. I like it.
4.0,"These socks are very nice! They are thick but not hot for me  although they will be a great winter sock. The compression weight is just right as I am a nurse and standing all day.  They do not roll down and feel very good on my legs.  yes, I recommend them but just remember they are thick so best worn in the winter I would say."
4.0,Nice fit but the material is cheap and little rough.
4.0,Love ports!!!! Love my porg socks!!!!!
4.0,"The quality of the fabric is not the best; you can certainly feel the acrylic fibers, especially compared to nicer cotton headbands. I purchased these headbands for a costumed run, and for that purpose, the price and the variety of colors included made this a great value."
4.0,These shoes are adorable. I bought two pairs. One tan and one black. I love the black ones they are very comfortable but these are really soft.. I guess is the word I'm looking for. They are not comfortable to stand in very long because the foot bed is so soft you just sort of sink into them. The others offer much more support. but they are adorable so I manage!
4.0,Serves its purpose well. As other have noted it gives the appearance of having a button clasp but it's actiually Velcro.
4.0,"Loved this dress 💗 I received so many compliments. 31 weeks preggo. It is a little thin, but black undergarments will work. It did drag a little but I wore heels, so it didn't bother me. Only reason for 4 stars are the shoulders/sleeves, I had to keep pull them down all night."
4.0,Too long but cute and simple for the price.
4.0,It’s a good dress little longer but fits great .. super comfy
4.0,Material is very cheap but the dress is beautiful!
4.0,"I am in law enforcement and I am always looking for new ideas, gadgets, and equipment that will make my work easier. Night duty is tough on an officer and flashlights or lighting it's self is a valued commodity, so flashlights or things that have lights on them is a very good thing.<br /><br />When I saw this I got very excited. Why? Its a flashlight that goes on your hand! Where your hand goes, the light does. The pictures of it was wonderful, due to the face that it would reduce shadowing which is always a problem. Matter of fact I am using it right now to type with!<br /><br />PROS - light weight, breathable, and works well if you wanted low light.<br /><br />CONS - you get one glove, its low light, and sadly it feels like it will fall apart if used to much. Right hand only.<br /><br />So, why 4 stars? The pics make the lights out to be brighter than what they are, but then again they are VERY small led's. You will not have a bright light that's going to really light your path up or even a room, but close up it will do the job. Over all though, I am pleased with the product so far."
4.0,"I like them, off course not the same quality as the originals but over all a great cheaper option"
4.0,"These are really nice glasses for the price , they are not super comfortable for me but they work and at a great price you cant go wrong , they feel heavy duty and come with a mini screw driver ,cleaning cloth and cloth bag ."
4.0,"Very cute! People are complaining that this wallet is not leather. READ THE DESCRIPTION PEOPLE! It says PU leather, they tell you that it is not genuine leather! I like this wallet a lot. One thing buyers should be knowledgeable of is the fact that the wallet snaps with a magnet as opposed to a button or locket. This isn't really a security problem though because there are zippers on the pockets, Also, my phone does not fit in the slot while it is in its case. I have an LG Volt. Overall, it was a good buy for the price. I would recommend it."
4.0,it's fits well. the light didn't work. was too lazy to follow up to see if it can be replaced.
4.0,"Took a long time to get -seasons had already changed. But look to be a decent boot. Lightweight, but will do the job."
4.0,a little on the big side around the head
4.0,So far so good. The bras are comfortable and great colors.<br /><br />*There are 4 not 5 bras in each pack.
4.0,"I like it, I wish the ratchet mechanism were a little closer to the start of the belt. Even in the first notch, there is a pretty long tag end."
4.0,Fast delivery Value for money
4.0,Super cute design. Easy to change out. Has a weird chemical odor that could be the material it is made of.
4.0,"They are really cute, soft and comfortable, and they are a nice weight fabric.  The only drawbacks - the waistband is a bit high, and tighter than other leggings I have, and the ankle is a bit looser. But certainly none of those are enough to keep me from wearing them."
4.0,The face of the mermaid doesn't have detailed features.
4.0,"Usually I am not a big fan of slim wallets like these since you can't carry cash in them. This one has a zip, so you can carry some cash. If you have a lot of cards with you then not the best one"
4.0,This is better than my expectations... I'm giving it four stars for that.
4.0,Nice and warm and fits as expected
4.0,"Very nice fabric, good fit."
4.0,It is SO cute.. but its also WAY tinier in real life. It an barely fit a couple cards...but it is vert cute.
4.0,Nice belt nice price..
4.0,Very nice dress. I wish it had an elastic belt
4.0,Very classy looking. Bought it for my wife's Samsung active watch to class it up some. It looks great but she said it can be a little hard to put on by yourself.
4.0,too much similar colors
4.0,"Really small fitting, I’m a size nz10/us6 and 5’8 tall they fit but only just. They would probably fit better if I wasn’t as tall"
4.0,"These were okay. A bit small, but pretty."
4.0,It’s nice and comfortable
4.0,"These are comfortable and very cute for layering. I'm wearing them frequently. Price is great and quality while not exceptional, is fine."
4.0,"Overall, I like this sweatshirt. Soft material, cute print.. just slightly snug in the waist, which seems out of line with the sizing. (I got XL)<br />I do wonder how long the design will last as it has an old school iron-on feel, but so far it’s hung on throughout several washes (cold water). Oh, & if you’re busty at all, the coffee cup and donut can end up in exactly.THAT.spot on your chest. LOL"
4.0,"These work well in Colorado cold, snow and slush.  Synthetic uppers, short just over the ankle boot with inside ankle zip up that has a liner flap to keep moisture out.  Heavy tread bottom.  Waterproof, as long as you don't get water over the boot!  My first pair I sent back because of defect: a bulge under the right foot toes.  They quickly replaced them.  The second pair had a good fit.  I'm a 9 1/2 narrow foot.  There was a slight rub on the left medial ankle.  I hand stretched them out; plus, with a good sock, it was totally fine.<br /><br />Shoes are very personal- you never know until you try them on if they'll fit.  I measured my foot per their instructions, matching the length/width with the closest size.  It worked.<br /><br />They look nice.  Made in China."
4.0,"I have recently started exercising and wanted to buy clothes to avoid ruining good shirts, as worn-out shirts I own are limited.  I decided to try out a tank/hoodie combination to see if I like it, which so far, I do.  My only complaint so far would be since the hood portion of this attire is very light, wearing it with the hood down tends to bounce it around a good bit while you are running."
4.0,Seems like good quality leather. Could have been a few inches larger. Happy so far.
4.0,This is a clip on for your shoes.  The clip is put on very loosely.  I added some super glue to it to make sure it stayed on.
4.0,"Tanzanite has a very vivid color in this bracelet. Packaging is very poor and the silver work is ok. I'm unsure how well the stones are secured, only time will tell. Overall a good purchase for the price!"
4.0,Nice Kurti.
4.0,I ordered these earings for my niece's wedding to  go with a wine color dress I purchased. I was pleasantly surprised they are very elegant and go well with my dress. I would recommend these earings.
4.0,They are very warm just wish the thumb opened
4.0,"I'm trying to hard to love this suspender skirt but unfortunately I'm too tall.<br /><br />I'm 5'8'' and 131 lbs so while I need the waist to be small, I need a long skirt. I have this issue a lot due to my long torso.<br /><br />It looks a little silly because of how short it is on me, but with leggings it looks okay."
4.0,My husband was a garbage truck driver and he could hear and talk to me through this hat. The noise when working on that type of machinery is very loud too so that is amazing. We have taken it apart and washed it without a problem whatsoever. It is very comfortable warm yet breatable. The in-line mic is very clear and the sound coming through is very clear. It also has a decent distance from your phone to stay connected. The only fault it has it that it would be better with a speaker for each ear rather than just one. Id recommend this to anyone working on a job with background noise or working out!!
4.0,Nice selection of bracelets. But colors aren't like they are in description. These are very dark and dull. Still fun. Great price
4.0,"This is a nice variety set, not top quality but perfect for costumes and the like. They look good when combined with each other too"
4.0,Bought these sunglasses for a 90's bar crawl. They were great. Got tons of compliments. I got the pink ones. Totally worth the price for what you're getting and they come in a little bag too.
4.0,"This thing runs very large. I'm a woman and my chest measurement is 40 inches,  I am wearing a size small which the company marks for 34-36 inch chest. The small fits me perfectly,  I ordered a size medium initially which was huge everywhere."
4.0,Cute top... sleeve are not long enough for me but I always roll up so I’m ok with it
4.0,"Very cute and fits all my cards( even had some slots left over!) just realized its a little higher than I thought it’d be and taking the cards out quickly doesn’t work, but other than that I think it was a good purchase!"
4.0,"Love this set! It does flip a little if you don't watch it, but as long as you put it on without twists, it stays out."
4.0,The material had smuges on it seems like I can wipe them off I think<br /><br />The material is cheap<br /><br />They seem to stay on when I walk around and they’re tied up so they’re secure<br /><br />V cute<br /><br />I feel like a brat doll
4.0,"SUUUUUUPER COMFORTABLE SHOES! Great to run errands, wear when traveling, etc. I am a little scared to wear them for a run because the sole seems a little fragile, but other than that they are a great price."
4.0,Finding knee pads seems to be a bit of an issue.<br /><br />I dont care for the velcro in place of a waist button.<br /><br />The many pockets throughout are nice.
4.0,Good quality for the money.  Well packaged to protect item.
4.0,"Very nice socks.  Nice feel and breathe welll.  Kept feet dry in hot weather.  Elastic kept socks up on my leg— I HATE it when socks sag.  There is some padding... more than thin dress socks, but I personally would have preferred just a bit more.  The upside is that they will not make your shoes feel small.  Best sock ever?  No. Very Good socks at a fair price? Absolutely. I bought other stuff from Mr Davis.  Because these have bamboo rayon, wash cold.  You will be happier if you hang the dry.  More work but will last longer."
4.0,Super pretty amd I get a ton of compliments on them. They make my ears sore after 4 it 5 hours of wear so i just wear them for short outtings. They're so pretty so it's worth the buy
4.0,"I just wanted to try something different and not difficult and it fit just right lost one already it had fallen out I dont know how, but it was the rainbow one..."
4.0,I have gotten so many compliments when wearing these. I would buy them in other colors if possible. They are quite unique.
4.0,Ran a little large. Great dress up or dress down.
4.0,i like it good job thank you
4.0,"Ordered the gray, nice color and the print is nice. I do think and a little afraid that the print will wear off with washing. Remain to be seen. Will post an update. Overall pleased with it."
4.0,Dislike that the ornamental items can slide off the chain. It needs a larger circular piece.
4.0,"With the heavy duty work that I do, I am always on the lookout for new work boots and these seemed to really fit the bill from the description.<br /><br />Overall, these boots are absolutely amazing with just a couple of subtle disappointments.  First, the boots fit like a glove and are super comfortable along the padding and insoles of my feet.  The padding isn’t too much but, it definitely feels like there is support there.  The problem with the sizing is that the toe box feels just slightly larger than it really should be, causing my feet to slightly jostle in the forward of the feet.  The weight is absolutely perfect.  Work boots typically feel so heavy but these are definitely the lightest I have ever had.  The support in the ankle is also wonderful, however the laces won’t last long as they are on the skimpy side.  Do they feel like $200 though?  No.  They simply don’t warrant the price.  They’re comfortable but I’ve had more comfortable boots in the past for less money.<br /><br />I would have a hard time recommending these at the price that they are."
4.0,Cute hats...too bad they came Jan. 2....
4.0,"Looks great, love the look."
4.0,"This bra is not a high impact bra if you order based on the sizing chart. I'm a size 36C and normally wear a medium in high impact bras. The size chart suggests a large, but I ordered a medium. Had I ordered the large it probably would have fit, but the material is too stretchy so it would not have been useful. The medium still fits but is tighter and provides enough support so I can use it for running. Overall a good deal though for a decent bra."
4.0,I ordered this cap for my son because he seems to favor the &#34;Newsboy style&#34; cap.<br />He was happy with the cap so &#34;I was happy with the purchase!&#34; Most important was the &#34;size.&#34; He needs a bigger size<br />and sometimes the larger sizes are hard to find.
4.0,Great band like the brushed leather side of the band .
4.0,"The Swomog pjs are soft and comfortable. The color is a pretty blue. The rayon and spandex material is cool. The pants are cropped, and the shirt is short sleeve. The hem of the pants and sleeves are slightly scalloped.  These are perfect for lounging around the house. I like them."
4.0,"I was looking for a modest swimsuit to wear when my parents and grandparents were over for pool parties and BBQ's. The swimsuit fit perfectly, for reference I'm 5'5 98-100lbs 32B. The only reason I returned and rated it 4 stars is the length. It's longer than I was wanting. It's not a bad length for walks on the beach or eating outdoors, but to wear in the pool or tanning it's too long. It seemed to be decent quality for the cheap price, but since I didn't keep it I can't say for certain how it will hold up."
4.0,These are well made slippers with just the right amount of cushion. The toe box is a little tight but I'm sure they will loosen up as I break them in. The purple color is so pretty and they seem to be really well made.
4.0,"Nice color, quality seems consistent with previous purchases.<br /><br />Size seems to be different from the past.  Have purchased several of these over the years, but this 'large' is larger than previous purchases.  Did not shrink with a few washings.  Comfortable, but looks a bit sloppy."
4.0,Bottoms were a little loose
4.0,This bathing suit is cute and my daughter loved it !
4.0,"I wanted a warm, comfortable outfit I could wear all Christmas day and New Years.  This is definitely warm and comfy.  The fabric is not the usual sweatsuit material so after several days of wearing, it hasn't pilled yet.  I did realize it makes me think of a little kid's snowsuit, haha."
4.0,Nice bookbag for toddlers. Comfortable padding and my son loves locking the harness strap on the front. Really good quality.
4.0,"Love these boots. I just bought my first pair, and they are super warm. I would give them 5 stars if the sole was more grippy on slick pavement. But, in snow the traction is good. They are so comfortable, I feel like I'm wearing my house slippers."
4.0,"The sterling silver earrings matched many outfits and are comfortable to wear.  They make a good simple, non-flashy gift as well."
4.0,"I really like this hat. It is big enough to cover head, neck and shoulders. Love the vibrant colors. I did wash this and it is a little hard to get it back to the original shape. May have to iron it if you want it to look less wrinkly."
4.0,This dress was too stinking cute!! We had so many comments on it. The bow was nice too. I am giving  4 stars bc the bow on the shirt is in an odd place and it was rubbing my daughters face.
4.0,"I have small wrist, on the last notch. Wish sold short strap version.. it's great for typical size wrist!"
4.0,These are nice shorts and fit as expected but they are a bit thin so you will want to wear something underneath so you don't share more than you intend to with your friends and family.
4.0,It fit perfectly! My daughter enjoyed it as a gift for her 7th birthday.
4.0,It is a quality piece but a lot smaller than I expected - buyers should make sure they view the size information.
4.0,"Some of them were a little flimsy, but overall my Daughter likes them"
4.0,"Nice sweater, a little longer than I expected but it's nice."
4.0,"I probably should try the next size down. These are comfortable but the ankle is very loose. They also are looser around the waste. I'm a pear shape 5'6"" 170# I bought size large"
4.0,"It was sent a birthday present and the person was very pleased w/ it, but explained it did not look exactly like the item in the picture."
4.0,I thought this product was originally going to be smaller. I wanted a natural black tourmaline pedant and that is what I received. The chain is a little cheap but I wear this product and have had compliments.
4.0,Very warm and comfy. The zipper is a little cheap. It was hard to start the zipper at first. But this will gladly be a daily cool weather jacket for sure! Definitely recommend!
4.0,"Nipple Concealers and Protectors, Nipple Chafing Prevention, Nipple Covers<br />Great for sore nipples or if you have to wear something that annoys your nipples.  I used them when I was taking a birth control that made my nipples sore to the touch.<br />I was not compensated for my review. I did receive this as a promotional item for free or discounted."
4.0,Ok not quite the material I expected
4.0,Surprisingly comfortable. A little hard to tighten. I hold the ends of the chain in my mouth and use my free hand to adjust the slide. Very pretty! The chain does leave a mark on your skin and the dangly chains can be bothersome.
4.0,I need a good cheap watch to wear when I service swimming pools.This one is fine.<br />I really like the Indiglo feature
4.0,These shorts are so cute but they came smaller than expected! I usually wear size 6 or 8 for bottoms and these ended up feeling a little tight even after sizing up to a large. I’m 5’5 and these shorts barely cover my butt and I would’ve preferred a longer length.
4.0,My son used to slip on our hardwood all the time.  With these he doesn't! Lots of grip on the bottom. Also fits great in a shoe. I was worried the grips might be an issue but they aren't! The only downfall is the coloring.  Wishing these were solid or more neutral colored.
4.0,Tienen buenita forma para lucirlos como aretes se ven pesados pero en realidad son ligeros creo que es una buena invención para ponérselos
4.0,It was advertised under men's wear but is actually a blouse top.  Buttons on ladies side
4.0,"Good quality, but was much smaller than anticipated"
4.0,"Love the pockets and have got several compliments on this dress. the pockets do make the fabric fit kinda funny. I have other dresses with pockets that don't have this problem, so maybe is was cut without taking pockets into mind? still cute and super comfy! I'd advise wearing leggings under it, as it's flowy, and on a windy day it's really easy to flash people"
4.0,"Super cute dress. Good quality, I got lots of compliments. My only advise, order your size. I'm size 8 on misses 9-10 juniors and I ordered a large. The dress fit a little big. I didn't have time to return it but I would have  preferred a medium"
4.0,"this bamboo is 100% better quality than the one that comes with a nezuko cosplay! my only complain is that mine came broken and the plastic piece that you bite down on came off, but i can just super glue it. the bamboo itself is a wooden piece with a plastic bit to bite down on. the red is just cloth!"
4.0,I love this bracelet. It is very different in design. A real conversation piece. If you like fun fashionable jewelry I’d say this one is for you. It’s also adjustable and should fit most.
4.0,"The width fits fine but quite longer than my daughter's other shoes, she does love them so I'm happy."
4.0,Love the look but the dress is extremely long.
4.0,Product arrived packaged fine and looked like what was described. Would have given the 5-star rating except a knob from the catch fell off the first time I tried it with a belt. It was easily remedied with super cement. A small piece that essentially made the entire Buckle not work. Works great now and I have worn it for a couple of weeks without further problem. Looks great!
4.0,"I order a large,  wish I had ordered the XL, fits a little snug.  I like the looser, sloppy look as pictured.  I'm keeping it, it's a really cute, nice top."
4.0,"Simple, but get's the job done. Totally a fan of it."
4.0,"These look great, and they seem durable. They're a little stiff in the joint which makes it a bit more difficult to fasten them one-handed, but they look sharp and seem to be of good quality."
4.0,"The color is not exactly yellow.  More gold, but still is a great tie for me."
4.0,Cute on the Small side for sure...Fit as expected...Small order 2 sizes up!
4.0,Nice color.  Not as high into armpit as shown so some back fat noted but less than most sports bra
4.0,Beautiful. Will work wonderfully in my wedding bouquets!
4.0,"I ordered this Sunsoul Bohemian bracelet for my teenage daughter.  For the price it is very well made, almost surprisingly so.  It is beautifully designed.  Thus far it has kept its polished look, not tarnishing.  Overall this is a great gift for a teenager."
4.0,"Love this pendant, but the chain is very cheap and keeps grabbing my hair. I'll have to get a better one so I can wear it. The London Blue butterfly is very flattering."
4.0,I love the color and it’s true to size. Over it’s not stretchy.
4.0,"Cute and comfortable, fits as it should"
4.0,"First of all, we really like the image on this shirt.  It's a super simple mashup of shapes to make for a cheerful frog on a skateboard.  Who wouldn't love that idea?  In fact, we already have a canvas bag with the image that we really like as well.<br /><br />So this shirt was a nice addition.  The quality of the shirt itself seems quite good, but it runs quite large.  We ordered the medium and I think it almost seems more L or even XL relative to other medium t shirts we have these days.  It's not a super big deal, since a shirt like this kind of looks right being baggier vs. sportier (think skater style).  But just beware.<br /><br />The other thing I'd note is that the image feels more printed on than embedded in the fabric.  It's kind of more like the printing you get on a team sports shirt (if you have one of those around). I don't know how it will wear over time and I'd probably be cautious about drying it on high heat.  I've had similar feeling decorations on shirts stick to themselves when exposed to a lot of heat.  So we'll just take some extra care when washing this.  But overall, it makes the shirt feel a little cheaper than when you get a product when the image feels more integral to the fabric itself.<br /><br />So in summary, a fun shirt that's a little on the big side.  But it'll still be a pleasure to wear and will likely draw a few chuckles from passers by along the way."
4.0,The shirt is beautiful it is bright and the material is silky soft
4.0,Love these socks.  They are perfect under my jeans or boots or for a sexier look with my sleep shorts when going to bed.  They fit as expected and I will be buying more
4.0,I have had tiny wallets that fits credit card size items including business cards. A little smaller than than this item. Such is what I was hopping to obtain. This item is a little larger than what I want but it will do fine. The little more room could be used. I recently purchased another wallet at Amoazon about the same design but was not soft and leather was thicker. The tiny wallets I pruchased at festival events but have not seen such so I went on the web. Hard to find and handlle items on the WEB or Amazon. So I spend more money tring to find what I want.
4.0,I'm glad that I found this brand on Amazon. I have several cable stitch sweaters.  The jacket is medium weight.  I've worn it with jeans and with leather pants.
4.0,This is a very cute swimsuit.  The bottoms seamed a little large. I really liked how the top fit.  The swimsuit over all looked very unique.  I received this at a discount price for an honest review.
4.0,Very nice shirt but a bit large ... either way it is a quality buy!
4.0,It's nice and soft but not what I'd thought
4.0,I really love this outfit.  Its made of a light weight material (prob polyester) and the jacket has 3/4 length sleeves and the pants are shorter in length with a flare which makes it more fashion savvy and wearable in the spring summer months.  It fits great and I love the hot pink color  The only negative is the packaging.  Its bundled and packed in a clear bag and this causes more wrinkles. But I can use a light iron to get the wrinkles out.  I really love the outfit and can't wait to wear it.  UPDATE!! I had to return item.  It is a beautiful pant suit however the front bottom of blazer does not lay down ..the stitching must be too tight
4.0,"I'm 5'4, 112 lbs and the M fits perfectly. A very cute dress didn't lose the color after washing it. A little see-through, but the material is very fresh and easy on the skin. I'm only taking one star because the elastic kind of hurts my shoulders. For the money it is a good product!"
4.0,Nice leather and clasp colour matches the gold watch.  The band locking mechanism works well.  So far it's looking good for day and evening wear.
4.0,Fits very well and looks exactly like it's shown in the picture. The material is thinner than I thought though so it feels cheap. I've purchased dresses on Amazon that costs relatively the same but feels really nice.
4.0,This shirt is HUGE. I am 5'1&#34; and 145lbs. I usually go for a large when I want a loose fit but I chose medium based on other reviews. If I was to purchase it again I would go for at least a small- it would probably still be loose. I don't plan on returning it since it will be easy to take in on the sides; There is not a seam between the sleeve and shirt so all I need to do is take in the sides following the existing seam from hemline to sleeve hem. I plan on wearing it with a belt around the waist so it doesn't need to be perfect anyway.<br /><br />The turquoise is vibrant and the fabric is soft and SUPER stretchy. Definitely size down.
4.0,Good but falling off my baby sometime and I don't know if it can hold up long time.
4.0,"So far so good.  It takes a little to find the perfect spot while first adjusting, but now I just slap it on and go.  I've owned the belt for a little over a week and it works exactly as described.  The material that the belt itself is made out of was a little stiff at first, but it seems to be &#34;breaking in&#34; nicely.  I usually wear similar belts to work (but with a much less clever clasp) and the buckles usually start to wear out within a few months.  We'll just have to wait and see if this one holds up to the test of time.  I'll update if there are any major changes."
4.0,Read the reviews...it’s tight and I ordered a XL. For a size 10 go XXL
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress. The only issue I had was, the dress runs small."
4.0,"The lenses are a little off, but I got used to them, and for the price... i'm not afraid to scratch them"
4.0,"The shirt fits as expected great, but just as a warning, the green is much more vibrant than pictured. Much more of a light, Christmas green than emerald."
4.0,"I didn't know that OXFORD was a color.  To me, it is gray - like the Seattle sky in winter."
4.0,Muy buen producto y medidas perfectas
4.0,Gloves fit well.. like a glove! I loved how far they went up my arm and I felt like Ms. Hepburn herself with them on!
4.0,The materials aren't the best but you pay for what you get.  This product still does what it's supposed to do.
4.0,I recommend buying a larger size or two than you would normally wear if using for a shoulder surgery with cryotherapy.
4.0,"This shirt was purchased for my husband and overall he loved the shirt.  The lining has a nicer feel than most quilted shirts and it is well made.  The shirt looks really good with the bottom on the outside of his jeans or tucked in as it does not have a 'tail' but rather is a nicely finished hem.  The snaps were secure;  there seemed to be no issue with them popping open unexpectedly.  The fit was more of a form-fit and if he hadn't gained some weight this year, that would have made this a slam-dunk.  However, it fit a bit too snugly and therefore we returned it.<br /><br />We purchased a couple of other shirts from other lines as well and both fit so it appears that the sizing may be slightly small."
4.0,"Decent quality for a good deal! I took an XL, am 5'9 and usually wear a 4 or 6 in dress size. The lining in the pockets have already ripped through, but for the price it still functions well."
4.0,"I actually loved the watch because it was so beautiful and unique, but the first time it came, the rod holding the face watch to the band kept falling out and was slightly bent. When I returned it, the seller immediately responded with true concern and interest and wanted to make it up. The replacement watch came within 2 days— before I had even gotten the first one sent back. It ended up being a wonderful transaction!!  I would greatly advise getting this watch. I think the rod was a rare case and when I got the exact same watch again, it was perfect and seemed very high quality!!"
4.0,I would like to have more choices in chain so that I can match the necklaces better.  But these are good for necklaces that need alot of strength.
4.0,"Super soft, fits as expected. It's a bit see through."
4.0,Good fitting. Nice soft material. Although I don't like the swivel print on chest.
4.0,This is awesome skirt.
4.0,These are the best pants I have owned
4.0,"Its a hat, it fits well but is a bit tight since it is one size."
4.0,"like it, but very very small."
4.0,The leather wrist band is very nice and soft. Easy to switch out and the color is exactly like the picture.
4.0,"I read other reviews and ordered up but it still was a little snug but overall, I liked the jacket. It completed the look I was going for!"
4.0,"Definitely not this color green, but still a lovely shirt. More of a forest green color. But again, fits as expected."
4.0,"The VamJump fits pretty well. I do not have a large bust nor small, so I can't say it fits everyone perfectly well but I plan to wear this under another tank top of some sort. Very very comfortable and for the price, you can't really beat it."
4.0,A bit small but that’s my fault for not paying attention to size- they will work for my project but next time I will look for something a little bigger.  Overall quality is ok
4.0,"This bracelet is just ok. It seems to be a nice item to give to any kid who is a &#34;Finding Dory&#34; fan. But quite honestly, for just a few dollars more, you can actually buy a better quality bracelet, or even a necklace, compared to this."
4.0,"How adorable! I love this and it comes with it's own jewelry case! Can't wait to use it. Only complaint is that the earrings are prone to breaking, because of the material the earrings are made from, and therefore it's easy to bend the stick on the back of the earrings."
4.0,Covers my head so my bald spot doesn't get sunburned when I drive my Miata.  I imagine literally any ball cap would do the same.  Gave it 4 stars because the Miata logo is barely visible against the background of the hat.
4.0,"Bought for my son who never uses them. Not helpful, I know!"
4.0,"I'm happy with this bag. It is a nice compact size with plenty of zipper pockets and more pockets inside. The only thing I don't like is the cross body strap is the same shiny leather as the bag on one side, but a grey rubbery material on the other which doesn't look as nice."
4.0,It's a bit big for my face and since it's metal it doesn't really form to my face.  It's really nice though and I will still wear it.
4.0,"I love these pants. They're comfy and are definitely a conversation starter. The image is clear and matches where it should. The only thing is that the side seams migrate inwards as you wear them. Kind of annoying, but I'm sure I'm the only one who notices."
4.0,Beautiful Dress but runs in small sizes . Go for a larger size than you normally get.
4.0,Wish the passport side had been a little larger.
4.0,"I’m 5’9” about 160 lbs and ordered the size xl/8-10. It fits nicely, could use a little more support in the bust. I needed a one piece for gym and aqua aerobics, and I love the design of these with the boy shorts. I haven’t actually used it yet, so I can’t attest to how it holds up or weather it is color fast."
4.0,Glasses are good.  Frames seem a bit loosely fitted.
4.0,Soft thin good for summer dont care for too wish it was a tank top.
4.0,Works great for days out on the boat
4.0,It's o k I like them longer tho. Will give to a friend.
4.0,very sturdy and nice looking bag
4.0,"Ok, this is a beautiful dress. It was somewhat small on my daughter, so you might want to order a little larger size. That being said my child is 5.5 and very thin. The dress fit beautifully, but with her heels on that she had to wear for her piano concert the dress was too short. If she had been able to wear flats it would have been a better fit for her. The rest of the dress was lovely, but we needed it specifically for piano concert and it simply did not work for that event. However, if you need an xs that really fits like an xs this is the dress for you."
4.0,Unfortunately I have larger wrists than average and it was too snug.  I had to return it.
4.0,"This is a beautiful piece that photographs well.  2 of the gems had fallen out during shipping, but nothing that a little hot glue couldn't fix. It's perfect for the price.  Shipping was great and the box it came in was a nice touch. I will definitely purchase from this seller again."
4.0,This was great for traveling during the winter months.  I would recommend getting a larger size than you normal.  The length is great but the arms around the shoulders and under the arms are very small so you have to make sure you don't string the garment
4.0,"These are probably more suited for winter shoes/wear due to the slightly heavier weight, but they are really nice socks. The heavier gauge does seem to make them more durable."
4.0,It is slimmer than I expected. 4.5 stars for my needs.<br /><br />Needs: slim. small. window opening.<br /><br />I fit 4 cards. and 2 bills. One of the cards has to be shown all the time so it goes into the windows slot.<br />This is really good. I can barely feel it in my front pocket.<br /><br />One star will be earned if the quality persists. Then it will be a 5er.
4.0,The only thing is the cross keeps getting stuck on the clasp.
4.0,Good compression socks.
4.0,The item is an extra large. I wear a small to medium. The extra large fits but its not that big. It fits a little snug.  The quality is great. came all rolled up in a small envelope. had a hear time opening the envelope with out cutting the outfit.
4.0,"This Knitee dress is perfect for the holiday season. It’s sexy, flirty, and fun. It has a very nice design. The design will complement most body types. It is sleeveless, has a faux wrapped top, and a ruffled hem. It zips in the back and stops mid-thigh or just above the knee. The color is a rich burgundy, or wine. You can add some cute accessories like a large belt, a bolero cardigan or jacket – some fun jewelry and you are ready to go. The fabric is great, stretchy and forgiving, a blend of polyester and spandex. It is fitted, so keep that in mind. Mine will fit perfectly as soon as I lose some pandemic weight. You can wear this versatile dress for work or play."
4.0,Cute shoes but they are a bit larger than I expected.
4.0,color was more of a beige rather than a white
4.0,"Gorgeous matte, nude shoe for my complexion. They fit true to size (for me anyway). These are uncomfortable in the ball of my foot, as I expected this style of heel to be (platform pumps are so much more comfortable) but these look incredible & are worth the discomfort!"
4.0,just a little snug on me DD breasts and a bit of a tummy but overall i like the shirt
4.0,"This shirt is nice and warm, can be used by itself or as an undershirt. The material though isn't awesome, it feels a little scratchy against bare skin. I would probably buy it again, because it is warm"
4.0,"This sweater is long, if you are looking to wear with leggings. Not super thick material but it’s pretty!"
4.0,fun to wear and seem to be well made
4.0,They work great! Only issue is that it rubs your legs raw if you don't have it over your underwear.
4.0,These sunglasses are exactly as described.They served the purpose for which we needed them. Cheap sunglasses yet fun just the same.
4.0,The material was a blend. Was hoping for cotton. I still like the shirt. It's pretty and I will be wearing it.
4.0,"Good quality, I really like it, I don't have any complains."
4.0,"They do what is expected.  Fits on my lens.  The measurements are a bit off.  While they are more than large enough to cover my glasses...they have a gap near the nose piece that is not covered. Not problematic,but just off.  Does Not affect its coverage.  Just an annoying thing for me"
4.0,Cute bracelet for the price.
4.0,Overall I am pleased with the sweats. They do run a couple sizes small. Be aware of that. Mine had a lot of extra strings on them. They are extras from the sewing process. They didn't harm the garment at all. It just left them looking untidy. All and all though I am pleased. They are sewn well and they were affordable as a lightening deal.
4.0,"Perfect fit. I usually wear a Medium - 132 lbs/ 5'4-and so i went with a size 8 and it fit just right.<br />when standing it covers my shoes, but not when sitting. nice quality fabric does not look cheap. waist high. zipper on the side."
4.0,Nice earrings for the price. Only thing a little uncomfortable was the post are a little long but other than that I like them.
4.0,"I fell in love with this dress the second I felt the fabric. It’s so silky, it’s T-shirt weight and very comfortable. I’m absolutely getting others in different colors. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because I ordered the navy and it’s definitely not navy. It’s a dark shade of blue but not navy. Great dress, totally worth it for the price"
4.0,Fabric is nice! Just very sheer.
4.0,Bought for my daughter..no issues that I know of
4.0,It stretches well and even where it stretches it doesn't become see through. Very soft. I recommend having a helper to get you zipped up into it as the zipper goes from the lower back all the way up to the neck and it's very hard to get a grip in the zipper pull with your hands covered in the fabric. Only thing I didn't like was the fact that I had to order a size up to fit my curves but I'm short so I had A LOT of extra length in the legs arms and fingers. Definitely not made for short curvy people lol
4.0,"Not my style, looked a little different for n person to me, a wee bit on the “older “ fashion style, no offense. Nice dress for someone who likes this style though. I returned mine, no questions asked."
4.0,"Love the color!  Not as strong as the original Apple band, but it works"
4.0,Straps run a little under the arms but is super cute and worth it.
4.0,"Dress short and pretty thin but most costumes are. Therefore, for the overall price it was worth the amount the product cost."
4.0,"Great deal for the money... Bottoms a little smaller than others in same size, will def buy again!"
4.0,"The x-large seemed to run bigger than a normal large in this type of material. I should have ordered a large, but many other brands ran pretty small. Good quality for price."
4.0,"These fit a little snugger than I anticipated, but I guess it provides motivation to run more! I appreciate the key pocket, always."
4.0,Really cute but I wish the suspenders were of better quality. The straps were fraying almost immediately after putting them on and they wouldn’t stay at the size we adjusted because the metal adjuster is too loose and slides out of place. The outfit itself fit well and was adorable.
4.0,"These are of good quality, look good and are a great value."
4.0,"Although there is not good arch support, I can always get an insert. What's more important is the width which accommodates my bunion! They are super comfortable and don't look wide at all. In fact, they look very cool and cowboyish. I love the oxide tan color - really beautiful. The sole is very flexible which makes them incredibly comfortable.  I'd buy them in other colors if they had them!"
4.0,"This is a really cute bag! I wish it were a little bit bigger, but it is really handy if you don't want to carry everything and just take the essentials with you."
4.0,"I really like them, so far.  Have tested down to 30 degrees, still seem warm."
4.0,It’s a comfortable dress. It runs a bit large (I should have gotten medium) and the strings on the side are very long. Cute easy outfit.
4.0,I got what I thought I bought.  I use them for computer glasses.
4.0,"“Slinky” material. Very soft and nice, but don’t plan on wearing leggings with it. The dress will stick to them."
4.0,Came as described. Great stuffing stuffers to the new additions to our lives.
4.0,"Fabric is surprisingly soft and good.The dress has unnecessary zipper witch scratches underpit. Some seams have thread.<br />The waistline is too high, it makes you little bit bigger than you are.<br />Gave it 4 stars just because it's very comfortable and cozy.<br />I'm 5'2&#34; 118 lb, ordered  small size"
4.0,"These socks are very soft and lightweight. They offer a little bit of compression on the lower legs and have an overall good feel to them.  While these socks are very comfortable, they are not very thick and only offer a small level of warmth.  They are a nice summer sock, but lack warmth to be warn throughout the winter months."
4.0,Cleaned my dirty ring better than I thought it would!
4.0,The ruffle along the bottom hem is adorable!  The length is just right...short enough to be sassy but still long enough for modesty.  The fabric is a dream...I love the linen look and feel.  My only challenge is that it was very small.  I normally wear a small in this type of clothing and the Small was really small.  I would recommend sizing up one size.
4.0,"Quick ship. Great quality,  would buy again"
4.0,"5’8 and 195 lbs, I got the large and it fits perfectly. It is a-line and flows beautifully. It is a bit long on me- it hits the floor just like the photo of the model shows. The yellow is slightly see through but manageable with neutral undergarments."
4.0,"If they were a LITTLE thicker, it would be 5 stars. runs a bit small, but overall theyre my new favorite pants. I will be ordering more"
4.0,Nice dress I need a ×large instead of the large 155 lb.
4.0,"I like these pants, they are high waisted and didn't slip down while wearing them and moving around. I appreciate that they have a pocket for my phone/keys on the leg and a small one for id/credit card in the front. These pants are comfy and stretch nicely and I think they look good too."
4.0,"This is a great skirt/pants combo. I love it! The problem is the waist size. On a medium size skirt/pants the waist is size small, at the best. I am going to keep it and ask my tailor if she can adjust/change the elastic to my size. If she can, I will give 5 stars. Regardless of the additional $$$ I will have to pay. That's how much I like it."
4.0,"These are good sandals. Nothing glitzy about them (which I like) and stay on your feet really well. The straps are all the same elastic material so they will probably fit a wide variety of feet. They do run a little small, I usually wear an 8.5 and have narrow feet, I got these in a 9 because 8.5 was unavailable and the 9 fits perfectly."
4.0,"Not sure if this is good or bad.  I put a lot of things on my key ring besides keys like RSA fobs, door entry fob, Tile, CVS discount card and several misc items.  The key ring gets ""lost"" in all the attachments, but the extra rings allow for better organization among them all, so that's good.  Haven't used (and probably won't) the clip unless it's too hang from an organizer."
4.0,I've used the reference table sizing but upon arrival shirt was much larger than anticipated for a fitted bike shirt. - German
4.0,Great quality! I got a medium and it was true to fit/size chart. A little weird that it comes with straps but there are no hooks to attach them. I guess you could see them on (?)
4.0,"Awesome child's slipper, but they were too small for my daughter. Will size-up next time."
4.0,"My daughter absolutely adores them, thank you"
4.0,"Lots of pockets, only draw back is the handles are a bit short. I don't like using the extra strap. But a nice purse."
4.0,Good work and play watch..
4.0,"Nothing, good buy"
4.0,Wish they were a little bigger though
4.0,"Very nice, smaller than described when in use"
4.0,It was an anniversary gift for my wife.  I liked it and my wife loved it.
4.0,Nice color and the material is stretchy so it fits comfortably the buttons are a little too small and they keep popping open
4.0,"Gift got my Dad, he wears it every day"
4.0,"They are beautiful, a little larger than I expected but very nice quality!"
4.0,"Overall the necklace seems of good quality for the money, the only thing that I was dissappointd in was the lettering on the front side. It was engraved so tiny that it was hard to make out the word More. I had to put my magnifiers on & still had a hard time making it out. There seemed to be enuff room where the engraving could have been a bit bigger. I am giving it as a gift to an older lady so I hope she can read it, but to her it will be the thought of the words that count. Other than that the chain seems heavy duty, yet dainty & well made."
4.0,Cute swim suit. Long enough that it doesn’t ride up.
4.0,Loves this dress so much fits me perfectly well!
4.0,"These serve a dual purpose well. They are good for the gym and for casual wear around the house and even for simple shopping trips. I kind of wish that they had a back pocket for a wallet, and  - dare I say it - a zipper fly would be convenient for the gym."
4.0,A little thin but it can be a good thing in Florida. Sharp looking considering it is a replica
4.0,"Bought specifically for vacation in the tropics and loved the sheer, lightweight fabric of this cover up. Easy to roll up and throw in the beach bag without being wrinkled!"
4.0,"Christmas gift, not fair to rate it yet"
4.0,They were a birthday gift for a friend who loves coffee mugs and polka dots.  She was so happy she took her earrings off and put these on.
4.0,Shockingly really nice quality and fit. It’s been over 8 months now and the quality has not faded or become any different than it was from the first day of purchase.
4.0,"Only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because of the material. It is a little too thick and not as soft as I was hoping for. Otherwise, it fits perfectly not too tight or baggy and is super cute!"
4.0,I returned it because it was too big (but I'm pretty skinny) and the material was a little too thin.
4.0,Short torso...
4.0,Beautiful!!! Just love it
4.0,"The shorts that are sewn into them make the skirt sit below on your waist, which was slightly uncomfortable at first but other than that everything was good."
4.0,"Decent keepers for the price. I have one or two on my pack on my belt and molle webbing locations to keep various smaller  items secured while tromping through the woods. Another one is on my belt to keep my keys on (when not in the woods) and my water bottle hanging from when I’m on a trail. Pretty good so far, no problems other than I wish I had three more."
4.0,"It was perfect for my son.  He wanted a chain, but I didn't want to buy a very expensive one, because he is only 12.  I didn't want to have the silver that can tarnish.  looks nice."
4.0,"There were mixed reviews on sizing and I found this fit true to size. Great material, print lined up at the top of the hood and overall good quality. The only down side is that the back of the shirt is not printed (just solid and the hood is an overall print). I would buy this again and recommend it."
4.0,"Good item overall, however the ring breaks off allowing the actual Jack and Sally tags to fall off."
4.0,These are super pretty - maybe a little darker than the picture looks but a super fun statement earring for sure. not too heavy
4.0,Excellent style and fit. VERY comfortable and I looked great!
4.0,I like product just by photo expectation was a bit higher on quality. It looks like product and will work just thought it was a bit more elegant from picture that what I had gotten. It takes nothing away from company or product.
4.0,The item was awesome and was as excepted.
4.0,Had many compliments when I wore this dress. I wish the fabric was more substantial.  Really too thin to be a winter dress.
4.0,"Pretty, this is a gift for someone.  Seems sturdy and brand new. I would buy again"
4.0,"Real leather belt is great, but I ordered a large and it is too big. I had to add a hole, not easy to do as this is a fairly thick leather. Love that I can change the buckle, and the quality is very nice."
4.0,I like the embroidery around the pockets
4.0,I wear size 7 - I ordered a Large and they are kinda small but I really like them so I’m keeping them
4.0,Good gift for elementary school kids
4.0,No C.
4.0,"For the price, it was great. Can be dressed up or down"
4.0,Other than the shipping which I completely understand the toy story 4 size 10 for kids sneakers are great! My son loves them thank you!
4.0,"My daughter loves them,  only complaint is she has a very small head for her age (3) and these don't have much room to make bigger."
4.0,A little more shiny and golden than I would like but still not bad for the price. Nice and heavy. My brother will love it
4.0,Received lots of compliments. Only miss was the lack of pockets
4.0,"I ORDERED the HOTAPEI Women V Neck Wrap Buckle Up Short Pants Sleeveless Jumpsuit Romper with Belt in black with the brown belt, an d I was able to rock it for this past memorial day weekend and was pretty happy with it.  I had ordered the same outfit in the past but the long pant version and it loved how it accentuated my curves, so when I had the opportunity to check out the shorts version I jumped at it.  Personally for me, the long pant version fits me a lot nicer, just because the shorts are a bit shorter thank I expected them to be.  In my case, they right up the middle area of the leg, so I found myself pulling down the middle of my leg, to bring the shorts back down.  I do have a butt and tights, so if you are really skinny not curvy these shorts should work without any issues  The material is mainly polyester and some spandex to give it a bit of room to stretch and breathe.  Overall, I do like the style, I just wish the shorts where a little bit longer, so I could feel more comfortable wearing it, without a cover up over them.  I received this product at a discounted price for my honest opinion."
4.0,"Giving it 4 stars because the green is slightly different, apart form that it fitted well and it's durable.  Don't machine wash.  Leaves balls. Gentle wash only if necessary."
4.0,Nice and warm..
4.0,"The size was about 1/2 too big to fit perfectly but still workable, I would recommend sizing a full size down as others have stated. You can never go wrong with a pair of Clarks though! Cant wait till they fully break in."
4.0,I really liked this dress but for me it was a tunic. I’m 5”9 and about 170 lbs. got it to hide my extra weight from baby which it does do but it was so short my whole but was out. I could have kept it and wore it as a shirt but I needed a dress. And it extra billowy so if you don’t like super loose big styles this isn’t for you.
4.0,"The bottoms fit perfect and are very flattering! The top is not so great (for me)… it did not give me much coverage on the outer area, I was “falling out”. Just numbed cause I couldn’t wear on our vacation :/"
4.0,"I like the glasses. They just weren't the color lenses that were pictured. They were solid black, instead of black frame with the purple lenses. Other than that, they're a great fit. Very cute"
4.0,"Cute, but material was cheap"
4.0,"Went to put black and red one on and it snapped, other 3 seem intact, would have been a 5 * had I been able to use all items."
4.0,"Wore them for basketball. Very snug on feet, just a little heavy for me."
4.0,"This luggage was ultimately returned because it was 0.5"" too wide for the airline we will be traveling with.  I can't speak too much to the luggage, but during the brief time we had this luggage I made a few observations.  (1) Samsonite had a fantastic warranty.  (2)The luggage seemed well made and durable (although I only pushed it around my house before returning it).  (3) The feature of being able to put a portable charger connected to the luggage then simply plug your device into the outside of the luggage is a very cool feature.  (4) As far as underseat luggage goes, it did seem large...like it would leave you with little to no foot room on the plane (but again I never tested this IRL). But if you're trying to avoid checking bags and want something with a lot of room maybe you're okay giving up foot room on the plane.  Hope that helps!"
4.0,"This arrived in the flattest envelope, I had no idea what it was at first!! But it quickly took shape to be a nice hat.  I got compliments on it immediately when I wore it just out an about in the yard for sun protection.<br />I bought it mostly for being on the river (floating, kayaking, canoeing etc...) and haven't been out with it for this yet.  But I have a feeling it will be excellent.<br />Nice quality .... so far.  I haven't used it all that much yet and when I write reviews I am always curious about what the quality will be when used a bit or a lot...<br />I am small and like that there is an adjustable head size.  I like the hole for a pony tail.  The cap is long over the eyes (good protection) .... and the neck-protection material is just wonderful!  WHY didn't I know this sort of had existed sooner???<br /><br />Good outdoor hat for all events!"
4.0,"The shorts are incredibly high waisted, the waistband reached up to mid rib cage. I had to roll down the band to shorten the shorts. Other than that pretty comfy, though I have to wear the shirt tucked in for it to look right"
4.0,"There is a slight crimp in one section of the chain that is slightly noticable.  Other than that, this is a very nice chain at a fair price."
4.0,"Sleek and thin. Be careful though, card numbers can imprint easily if you have a lot of stuff in there."
4.0,"Cute hat, and keeps my baby's head snuggly and warm in the cold. But the stitching on the forehead of the giraffe i received was a little off, I'd expect little mistakes in a handcrafted hat but I'm not sure if this is handcrafted. When it arrived it smelled like dust and was a little rough to the touch but after washing it it softened up and is comfortable for my baby now. Would recommend due to how cute it is, but i wish it was slightly better made"
4.0,"Soft material, just too wide even when ordering down a size."
4.0,"Pants are very cute, but we’re small for my little one"
4.0,"If you are 5ft 7"" it will fit perfect. I am only 5 ft tall so I will be taking it to my seamstress to shorten it for me! It does run big, so you might want to order a size smaller but I am petite so for a tall big boned woman this would be perfect.<br />I do love the softness of the material! I love that it is a V Neck, but that is a personal preference.<br />Overall it is a nice gown."
4.0,Tailored fit.  Great value for price.  Not too wrinkled if short dryer time then hang to dry.  Iron to look crisp.
4.0,I'm a 12 and got an xl. It fits.
4.0,"Was overall very good but one of the hooks for the earrings were bent. I’m not sure if it was supposed to be like that, but I highly doubt it was. Also there two different sides to the earrings. One side is clear with picture on the back where its a little less bright/vibrant. In the third picture, the earring on the right is brighter than the one on the left, and the one on the left is also the one with the bent hook. I’m not sure which side was supposed to be shown when facing the front but it is just little details that bothers me. But otherwise still very good. They also came in 15 days, 13 days earlier then expected."
4.0,"The socks are thin, but I like that for my Barre classes.  They have a lot of stretch in them which makes them hug my feet great.  They do not stretch out like my other cotton blend barre socks.  Great colors.  The grips on the bottom are nice and will be helpful during class."
4.0,I have a narrow foot and the fit on this slipper just right.
4.0,"Had the cutest packaging! I was unsure of this watch at first because I expected the face to be too large for my liking. Nice surprise that it wasn’t. It does feel a little like cheaper quality but you get what you pay for. I’ve been looking for a silver mesh watch to wear for work and I’ve found one I like! I do recommend it, but I’m not sure if this is the watch that will hold up for a long time."
4.0,Im satisfied this item.
4.0,"These earrings are really pretty and fun, but SUPER LOUD! You can hear them dangling from across the room. I almost want to solder those pieces together. Other than that, they are made well and look nice."
4.0,Very cute. My daughter loves it. Bow is a bit flimsy it just hangs. But she loves it and still looks cute. Sticks well to her not loose stitching.
4.0,"Cute dress. I had a hard time deciding which color to pick. I ended up deciding on the army green. I am sure excited to pair this beauty with my brown boots and cream color scarf. I think I might even look for cute belt to wear with it. The elastic waist band fits comfortably. I wear a medium and I am pleased to say that the medium fits true to size in the top and sleeves. BUT I am 5.6 and I feel it is a little long on me. The bottom of the dress comes to mid calf for me. Wish it was just a tiny bit shorter. The sleeve are a good length. Pretty excited cause there aren't too many long sleeve dresses out there. The material feels soft and flowy. It will be a perfect dress for the office this winter. Oh and lets not forget the pockets! Perfect to tug in my phone, a piece of candy, or even my keys."
4.0,A good look at a good price.
4.0,Too small for my 32H boobs even though I got the L (I’m a size 4/6) but then everything is always too small so it’s a bonus that it covers the nipples! I got this for tanning by my pool and wouldn’t wear it anywhere for real because it’s way too revealing on my hourglass body type hahaha
4.0,I bought this for a halloween costume so not much to say but it fit as expected and its pretty warm
4.0,Very cute it’s a very stretchy material. However i couldn’t figure out which side was the front it had no tags. The dress fit so very nice and showed my curves.
4.0,This is a good product for those who don't mind tough rain proof material. I didn't so I returned mine.
4.0,"5'3&#34; 116# 32B-28-38, small top fit fine but bottom front is about half the size compared to what is shown- the metal rings make it a little awkward sitting just outside of the pubic area. scrunch back bottom is cute but on my big booty it's a little awkward fit also. the light blue color is amazing, as shown."
4.0,"Pretty colors.  I did not realize there would be a right and wrong side of the scarf...my mistake....view of the wrong side is clearly shown on the website.  Arrived with creases from being folded, but they were easily removed with stream iron."
4.0,I love the bamboo/tencel nighty. I found sheets of bamboo and it's my new favorite cotton substitute.
4.0,a little longer and lighter in color than I expected but very comfortable
4.0,"As long as you're expecting kids tights, they fit as expected.<br /><br />Dance tights are expensive.  These are great for the price.  They're not quite as thick as the tights I paid 4x the price but thats totally ok with me.  THOSE tights didnt last more than 1 performance either.<br /><br />They fit, my daughter didn't complain and they're pretty affordable.  Win-Win!"
4.0,Nice dainty piece of jewelry sweet quote perfect gift for teen or young adult
4.0,Very cute dress! The tie on the front is a little cumbersome but otherwise super cute. I bought a size larger than I wear and it fits perfectly.
4.0,Shipped fast and it was exactly what my daughter wanted for her birthday day.
4.0,almost a perfect watch.  Fit my small wrist right away.
4.0,Nice watch but be aware that it is really big.
4.0,"Shipped quickly, Packed well but these are solid lambskin gloves and in no way are they able to be used on a phone for a touchscreen. That as goes for an Ipad. The gloves themselves are very nice, well made, soft inside and my boyfriend loves them. However, ​don't expect to be able to text without taking them off."
4.0,"It’s okay but the numbers should have been a little more brighter because of the really dark negative background just my opinion. No problems at all with this watch i even went and swim in the beach and nothing happened to the watch I let it stay under for about 30 minutes under the sea water, just don’t press any buttons just saying 🤔"
4.0,"For the price, this is a great everyday dress. It's a bit see-through, but I still love it!  I wear a top slip and feel great."
4.0,"I'm 5 ft nothing - if you're taller than that you'll need a knicker buddy to keep watch for accidental hoo-ha flashing.  And the buttons are too small for the holes &lt;insert joke here> so you'll either need to swap for larger buttons or put add a few stitches to prevent the girls from busting forth unexpectedly like Jack Nicholson in The Shining -- HERE'S JOHNNY style.  No big deal though.<br />Beyond that, it's worth the $, super cute, flattering and the fabric feels wonderful.  A little effort makes this a perfect little party dress. but probably NSFW"
4.0,Not same color as ordered. A little poofier than wanted. Other than that it’s a tulle skirt I used to layer under my wedding dress!
4.0,Nice product and appears true to sizing listed however the padding is too small for the size.
4.0,"My son loved this shirt for his birthday party. He is average size 9 and it fit just right. They all had fun playing with his shirt, young and older. It was also cool that you can use a phone’s torch on it too. Even the adults wanted to know if it came in their size."
4.0,"I received a 2-pack of women's no show socks in the color of nude by Spikerking. There is a silicone pad sewn into the heel part of the sock to keep these in place. The material is soft and stretchy and comfortable to wear. However, I found that my feet were sweating much more than in cotton socks. I live in Florida so it's always HOT here and sweaty feet are just part of living here. So, I cannot really place any blame on the sock. Also, the material seemed to absorb the sweat and best feature of all, these no  show socks are machine washable!! So after all the sweating, these socks can be placed into the machine and washed on delicate cycle so they're nice and clean and ready to be worn again. I'm not sure what the manufacturer instructions are for drying these, but due to how thin and delicate they are, I would recommend only lying flat to dry or hang to dry. I'm not sure these would hold up long in a heated dryer. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"The watch works well. I use it every day, and have bought this same watch for over twenty years, and wear them until the battery runs out. I don't like the latching mechanism on this watch because it makes it difficult to put on."
4.0,The dress is very comfortable but i needed an xtra small.
4.0,"Sent as a gift to great granddaughter.  Not only does she like, her aunts and uncles made positive remarks from the posted pictures of her cooking."
4.0,I am a size 8.5-9 and should order a 39-40 but they are too small. A 41 fits perfectly. They are comfortable and do not rub and hurt my feet but do not offer a great deal of support. I still love them and have gotten a ton of compliments!!
4.0,Great hat but had to be aired out due to the bad smell. Otherwise just as described and protects great.
4.0,"Cute earrings for my 16 year old niece, they're a little too big for my taste but I'm sure she will love them!"
4.0,I like the style but face could be larger and easy to read.
4.0,I like them a lot . They're comfortable.
4.0,"Great price for theses shades, only thing is it doesn’t stop sunlight coming in the side like regular shades do, good product though from the front."
4.0,"These glasses are adorable and affordable, they are a bit light weight, and feel like they could break at any moment, so not recommended for every day use, but for a fun accent to an outfit or for costuming they are perfect.<br /><br />I ordered the small, and the medium to wear for a Harry Potter themed outfit. I thought the small glasses were much more realistic and accurate to the movie, but thought the medium size was the perfect mix of adorable (like an anime school girl). I could see these being perfect for cosplay too."
4.0,They fell as good if not better than more expensive thigh highs.
4.0,"This is a big, fluffy scarf. Even though it is lightweight, it's certainly warm! It's a bit long for my taste, but it works!"
4.0,i like it but it was too big for ear
4.0,"These adorable, colorful socks fit well and are quite comfortable.  I use then to take walks. Plus I also wear them around the house. My feet don't sweat in them. They wash well and don't shrink. I love the style, they're colorful unique."
4.0,No zip pockets but otherwise good.
4.0,Muy pesados
4.0,"Good fabric. Great quality, just as describe. Love it"
4.0,"Love that it fits my iPhone6s with a case. I wish it had more card slots, maybe behind where the phone goes. It's also a little tight with the card slots and other slots next to coin section. Love the color though. It's more turquoise than green."
4.0,Like it a lot but it is not screen printed as expected. The cat shape will start flaking off after a few washes.
4.0,"I bought this as a bride's maid dress and it was very pretty. It fit a little large in the bust so we had to make some alterations, but overall not too hard.<br /><br />The material is a little cheap, but I still got a lot of compliments while wearing it. If you can sew, I would suggest not going a size down just because it fits large. The material is not stretchy...at ALL and is designed for the &#34;average girl your size&#34;. In other words, if you are like me and have a small bust and large waste (or vise versa), you will have to make alterations either way."
4.0,Good buy..but shipping was way too LONG!!
4.0,Great product nice thick material but runs a bit large
4.0,I bought the biggest size for my 10 yr old. He was very impressed with how soft it is and loved that it has a hood. Only reason it's not 5 stars is that the arms leave no room for growth so he'll be growing out of it sooner than I wanted
4.0,"Looks better in person although a stone fell out when opening the box :-( don't think these will work for my teeth, Chuck Norris teeth,"
4.0,"I really like this shirt, great for layering"
4.0,I've worn it a few times and the fabric still looks nice.  Super comfortable will buy more colors
4.0,"Love it, but like other reviews state, it is very heavy. I only wore it for several hours so it was tolerable, but definitely won't wear it long-term. Design is fabulous."
4.0,"I liked how they looked but they’re thin and fragile.  After a week that’s fell off as I wiped the lens.  Disappointing.  If you get them just handle with care, they do look good and fit well."
4.0,"Fits perfect it’s just my bottom made the small cuts larger the moment I sat down in the pants revealing my cheeks even more. I still wear them because I love the way it’s made and fits me, just I gotta wear a long shirt with them."
4.0,Love these earring. For the price they are great however the backs are horrible. My earrings kept falling. If you want to buy these make sure to also buy some backs as well!
4.0,"Not a unicorn, but still nice"
4.0,A little clunky but my flower girl loved it.
4.0,A lil slip n slide but comfortable
4.0,I was hoping this dress would've been a lot longer. As cute as it was/is I had to send it back because I don't feel comfortable with having my knees out (for modesty)
4.0,"I love this dress. The material is very nice and the dress is flattering. I just wish that the slits on the side were not so high. I can were dressy sandals or casual sandals, and I don't think either one takes away from the dress at all. I would definitely purchase this dress again."
4.0,Really nice material. GOOD QUALITY for price. Nice modest fit.
4.0,"I ended up returning this dress but not because it didn't fit well or feel comfortable. The only thing wrong with the look was me -- I have small breasts and I should've known that a dress like this would only emphasize that. However, the rest of the dress made me feel very good about my stomach and hips and butt. I'm not consistent with exercise or healthy eating so I was surprised at how the ruching slimmed me out. If I was more confident in my chest I would've kept it -- the fit was amazing."
4.0,Bought for my husband and he really likes them. He had a few name brand ones from sporting stores and said they are almost the same. The only criticism he had was that compared to the name brand ones he currently owns they are a bit shorter in length. Otherwise definitely worth a buy
4.0,"of course I washed it first thing and I know that linen will soften with washings...but this is scratchier then I had hoped.  the main thing that is a disappointment though is the color....not a nice pink if it is pink?  I ordered pink, but the color is pretty muddy."
4.0,For the price it's a good buy.  I got a lot of compliments when I wore it to work.
4.0,"Was looking for a few sweaters that were inexpensive. These sweaters feel really nice on the skin, but are very much on the cheaper side quality wise.  I'm happy with the price I paid and what I got, but I would not recommend these if someone is hard on their clothing.<br />Colors are great, and are as pictured."
4.0,As an adult male they cover mouth and nose but just a little small. Wish it cupped under the chin and more over the nose.
4.0,The Elizabeth ring comes in a set of three rings that stack together. There is a gold colored one silver colored one and a rose gold colored one. I got a size 9 and honestly these rings just fit a size smaller. So if you wear a size 8 I would get a size 9 and if you wear a size 7 get a size 8 etcetera. They are a set of three so the band is wider. It was great to be able to use and test out this sample with my other rings and just have them be pretty. 18k gold plated. The crystals are sparkly and really catch the light. The stones are set and they haven't loosened or fallen out. The metal definitely is what is stated as I haven't had a green finger. These are so beautiful and am so glad I didn't have to wait for Valentine's day.  The only downside is the sizing. If you know to get a bigger size you're good to go.
4.0,It looks beautiful on! Looks just like the picture. The dress fit like a glove. A little long on me but I am only 5'1&#34;.
4.0,"I returned these. I have the black pair with the leopard accent, so I thought these would work. Unfortunately, they didnt fit my butt in quite the same way (maybe they did, it just isnt noticable in black), and they weren't for me. (Backstory though: I have lost 125 lbs and my bum has a little extra skin and sometimes it gives me funny wrinkles and folds, and they just seemed more apparent in the leopard than in the black.)<br />Really cute pants, and i was over the moon to receive them, so I hope someone else can enjoy them the way I enjoy my other pair. I can say they are very comfortable, and the waistband is pretty comfy too. I like the way the fabric feels on my skin. I will order from this company again. I enjoy their clothing."
4.0,Bought these for a preschool classroom of 34 students. They were a great value for the price. One student ripped theirs when they put it on but we had plenty of extras. We wrote the kid's name with permanent marker on it to use throughout the year. We will see if they last the whole year.
4.0,Works fine.  But not as thick as a couple of others thatI have.  However they are decent for the price.
4.0,"awesome dress. only complaint is the top shirt part is slightly see-through so have to wear a camisole underneath. dress is long, and is very comfortable."
4.0,The dress is for someone very tall. Also it is very tight to skin. Just fyi to the wise. Material is decent though.
4.0,Very nice fabric and color is true to the picture shown.
4.0,My daughter picked this for a wedding dress - it was stunning.
4.0,"Pattern, nice, quality ok for this price point."
4.0,This perfectly suited my Christmas Card Photo purposes but is made of fairly thin material — more like a sleeping cap than a Santa’s hat.
4.0,"cute, comfy can be dressed up or down.  Great Material"
4.0,The color is exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,"As expected, cite!"
4.0,"Purchased for use with drop of mother of pearl from stud, will work just fine. Thanks!"
4.0,Perfect hat for what I need.
4.0,"great size.has the mesh strainer.has a tray to sit it on to keep your counter clean.nice handle and spout.just cool your grease off some first,as i forgot,and container got really warm."
4.0,Bigger than expected but not too heavy
4.0,"Nice watch for the price. it obviously does not look expensive because it is not. however so far it does the job and very well.  Went into the ocean and it stood like a champ. works perfect after falling from the jet ski into the water.  So far an excellent purchase .  And people have commented about it on my wrist.,  so they actually like it.  I would give it five if the material and construction would resemble something more of high quality, but this is a relative comment, because it of course was not expensive."
4.0,"Love the way this headband looks, very cute, I just wish this band was a little smaller, I have a hard time with headbands staying on my head, I am not going to give up on sweaty bands just yet, I love the look of them!!"
4.0,It's more easy to fix the bracelet.
4.0,I loves this items but its runs big as well.
4.0,Beautiful bracelet but a bit small.
4.0,"Fits as expected, seam at toe a tad bulky"
4.0,Tight weave and 3 layers before the filter makes it hard to breathe through. The print and comfort is great and fitment is great.
4.0,"Well made, great quality remote entry key fob case and clip. I wish it had a window so I could see the buttons. I would've kept it but ended up returning it because I didn't really need it and it would take up more space in my purse. Fits a 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe remote entry key fob with room to spare."
4.0,one shoe had a slight defect
4.0,"Super cute! I kinda wish I would have got a smaller size, but it's still super cute.<br /><br />I am 5'7, 140lbs & I got large"
4.0,Very see- through but other than that it fit fine and was good for the price I paid for it
4.0,Very Comfortable...Looked too small to begin with but stretches to fit very easily.
4.0,Harbor bay is a tad pricey however their clothing always fits perfectly. This shirt is light and breathes well and is very flattering to my body shape
4.0,"This is very nice glows very well, it is not too small but not to big and is elegant for male or female."
4.0,"Highly polished shell pieces which reflect subtle multi-color light when angled. The brass is also polished and has the look of pale yellow gold. The total length of the bracelet is 8 inches including the clasp. Due to the width it fits a lot smaller when wrapped around the wrist. My wrist is approximately 6 inches at the smallest part just above my hand and the bracelet fit snug. Not tight but there was very little movement and no drape. Due to it being so snug, doing up the clasp is a real struggle with one hand. I've added some pictures and you can see in one picture I'm wearing two 7.5 inch chains which sit much further down on my hand. I paid about $25 with free Prime shipping and overall for the price it's really well made and quite eye catching. I'd have rated it 5 stars if it was just a 1/2 inch longer."
4.0,"Flimsy, but they look fantastic.  I've only worn them a few times, but one had the wood come unglued and another bent slightly.  Still totally worth $6. Easily re-glued with any kind of glue.  The wood also seems untreated, which means moisture could ruin the wood.  But for $6 I will clear coat the wood and make myself some $20 cuff links.  The metal is also low quality, but the dark plating looks great."
4.0,Great quality for the price. My son wears these to school everyday.. the solid color design meets dress code and breathability keeps him cool. They withstand washing well and dry quickly. The neck line is a bit disproportionally large but he doesn't seem to mind.
4.0,"To start, I love the colors of this plaid patterned gaiter. Personally, I prefer gaiters over face masks. However, this is the 1st gaiter that's too loose and won't stay above my nose. It can be fixed though - I think a stitch is all it'll need. But still, not everyone will be willing to do this. Size aside, the colors are quite nice and the material is silky soft. It's so much easier to breathe while wearing a gaiter and I'd wear this over a mask any day."
4.0,I wore this to a NYE wedding and got so many compliments! but I did have to sew the zipper to repair it. I'm 5'6&#34; 145 Athletic build
4.0,Nice earrings and go well during holidays.
4.0,"I got it for my daughter and it's a good idea. I like the design and the fact that she can breathe very well while wearing it on her face and still have some protection.  Since she will be back to school after the summer, the only bad thing I have to say about this is the way it was packaged. It literally arrived in a plastic bag and there is a small scratch or stain inside though you can't see it from the photo.  Since I ordered this I have been looking for others but the price is ridiculous !!! These face shields, honestly shouldn't cost more than $ 9, if it's UV filter & scratch resistance, I'd say $ 17 is the Sweet spot. At that price, I'd buy more colours for sure if it had the UV and was scratch resistant LOL.<br />If it was possible to make these take a prescription that would be the best and then  I would say you have a TRUE WINNER as this would eliminate the need for glasses underneath.  I wear glasses so these just won't work for me.  Gut do love the design and the Idea.<br />If these were able to take prescriptions the price would also still need to be affordable.  I think I will be getting a second just because too darker for school.  I think something lighter and transparent with a little tint is better for school.<br />Apart from that, I think they need to put a warning on the packaging, that said fragile, handle with care! These were GOOD and I give them a thumbs up for the value.<br />IMPORTANT:  If you get it dirty, do not use anything but water to clean it. A soft paper towel with water is all you need. Anything other than that and you will damage the sheal.  If you want to eat or drink just lift the sheal above your head like a glasses, the nose bridge keeps it away from getting in direct contact with the head. If your hair is greasy I would not do this. I would just remove it totally."
4.0,"The dress is really nice and got many compliments! I just wished the material was a thicker.<br />I am 5ft10 and 198, i ordered a large ."
4.0,Fits perfectly! Lightweight and soft but doesn’t feel cheap. It’s leashes through a couple of washes so that’s a plus too. I would give it 5 stars but I feel like the button closure vs a snap at the top is a bit of a choking hazard.
4.0,The skirt fits true to size but beware if you're short! I wore it higher than my waist and it was still pretty much touching the floor as I'm 4'11. Going to have to cut a few inches but overall it's as expected- comfortable and fits perfect.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:453ac7bf48f7947ff8150ee1a229cdf4]] The back where the pearls are attached too is still sticky, I have no idea to get rid of that, my hair gets stuck onto it. Other than that they are beautiful."
4.0,Very beautiful and dainty for larger fingers. Will definitely recommend this to friends and family.
4.0,Overall I like the look and thickness. It does let in more air than I expected hence the 4 stars. Have yet to wear it in below freezing weather
4.0,Not like I had imagined - but fresh and professional! Slap on some red lipstick and your favorite pair of shoes (flats or heels) and you're golden!
4.0,I’m 5’4 145lbs and I got a medium. Dress fits perfect and it’s perfect for luau or beach attire. Very cute for vacation carefree days. Dress is flattering and hides any belly fat. Material is on the cheap side so Be careful not put in the dry or iron. I would hang dry and wash in cold water.
4.0,"The color is pretty. The quality is decent. I like it a lot. The size is a bit bigger than I expected, but still fits."
4.0,Really cute but front got scuffed quickly. Sandal itself seems strong
4.0,"It fits like they say. just measure yourself like on the chart. Alow of layers under it. lots of pockets too and meets my expectations. Wish that the hood could tuck away, but that's ok, i will make that happen with 2 snaps. The only Issue is this> the main front Zipper is Poor, cheep and small. At the entry couple connection, the teeth part from the tack slid. So it is an issue to start the zipper, carefully and slow going. So take care there. If you do not, it will Not start. I sent back the first jacket and got the replacement very quickly ( thank you Amazon. But the 2nd one is the same issue: It is the Zipper. This jacket could be great with a heavy duty zipper though. Nice light jacket and water sheds off great and all other things are good. Light and secure with many pockets over your layers.  I use it a lot and like it a lot, but the issue of zipper. So take it slow when connecting or releasing it.  For money, a good one though. If the zipper was HD then this jacket would be priced higher and that would be worth it. SO there you all go.  Note for the manufacturer: Sew on a better Zipper >"
4.0,"Very nice dress and style. Fit is just a wee bit big for the measurement described for this dress.  It looks very good, however the material is a thin polyester and will show underwear lines. I wear it with a narrow patent leather red belt and red patent leather heels with a yellow shells bib necklace and for it makes for a sophisticated sexy look. Overall recommended for a stunning look. Delivery ok."
4.0,"I love how deep the pockets are and that they don't bulg out, the color was more of a fuschia than anything else, pretty vibrant which is something new for me, I wear more black and grey things by this was a fun find and I will probably get another one in a different color!"
4.0,Extremely comfortable and functional. Great for workouts
4.0,These things work!
4.0,"The size is match, but color is lot darker.  wish the color is same as in the picture showed."
4.0,Seems like a good scarf but smells heavily of perfume for some reason .
4.0,"Very cute ring although the pearls are smaller than pictured. It’s about a size 4.5 which is pretty small for the average woman’s hand. (Most jewelry store stock rings are a 6.) I’m still happy I purchased it, but would have appreciated a better description."
4.0,"Comfortable. Good, light material. A little loose but I was hoping for a looser fit. The material is pretty thin and stretchy, so if you are going for serious compression either buy smaller than you normally would or find a top with thicker, tighter material."
4.0,"a bit thin, but it is only a cover up"
4.0,Not to bad wish it was a little thicker but its cool
4.0,Nice😊😊😊
4.0,Really cute shirt the only thing is it runs small.. I wear an large so ordered an xl so it would flow better and the xl fits like a large...
4.0,"Cute, comfortable dress. I'm glad I read other reviews and ordered a size up."
4.0,Kid loves it! That is good enough for me.
4.0,This is a nice necklace. I love the bright colors and it hangs nicely when worn.
4.0,"Very well-made and the faux fur is luxurious. However, the diameter is a little big so the fit is somewhat awkward. Still cozy!"
4.0,Here thinks they're a little small. I think swim trunks should be a little smaller so they don't fall off. 🤷‍♀️
4.0,"This was a gift for my sister,she loves it."
4.0,"My only disappointment was with the smallish clip. It does not fit on many belt loop as my previous watch with fob did, It also has a small dial which is difficult to read if your vision is not perfect."
4.0,Really nice dress but it was too tight on my larger breast. I gave it to a friend who is a D and it fits her perfectly. The bottom flares out and makes your figure look amazing
4.0,"I like these suspenders.<br /><br />They are a nice width and look nice.  Having another color option helps when trying to look nice in a variety of outfits.<br /><br />The thing is that these are not really 'checkered', which I interpreted to mean that the material had two colors mixed in a checkerboard pattern.  It is really only the texture of the weave that gives it a checkered look.  This isn't necessarily bad, just not what I expected.  I should have looked more closely at the pictures (and used rollover-zoom.<br /><br />Also, I prefer a more aggressive clip.  Ones with metal teeth seem to not loose their grip as I move around."
4.0,"I bought this on a whim when another dress I bought was wayyyy too small. There was no size chart so I was nervous but with prime I figured what the heck. I'm 5ft4, curvy, size 10, 200lbs. I got the size large and it works well. The belt however broke inmediately, it's super flimsy and not worth a penny. I figured it wouldn't work for me anyway so not too concerned. The v neck of the dress is weird. It's deep but then has a stitch sewn in to avoid showing cleavage but then it gaps. I just took out the stitch and it's fine. It's not the most high end of dressed but for the cost it's ok."
4.0,The filler in the cups a little too firm
4.0,"Good sewing, sturdy buckle,comfortable stretch. Not sure how long the elastic will last. At the price, though I could buy several more."
4.0,"I'm a software consultant.  I carry two notebook computers with me to my clients every day.  My bag was full of chargers and mice and cable of every kind.  I ordered this to help me bring order to the chaos hanging over my shoulder.<br /><br />Does it work?  Yeah, I'd say it does.  Does it work for me? Not really.  The Grid-IT really shines when it's holding rectangular things.  My MP3 player, perfect.  But my mess isn't so neat.  It's the cables and headsets and powersupplies that cause me grief.  As it turns out, a couple of zippered bags did a better job for me.<br /><br />Am I giving up on the Grid-IT?  NO WAY!  It fits nicely in my bag and does do a good job of holding what I put in it.  I may end up moving it to my camera bag where the stuff I need to keep from banging around seems like it will fit in the grid better.<br /><br />My review would have been 5 stars if I thought this only need to hold onto rectangular things.  Maybe four is too rough, but I can't give it 4.5 or 4.75.<br /><br />-------------<br />Update 12-9-2011<br /><br />I've changed computer bags a couple of times since I purchased the Grid-IT, and I've moved it to each new bag.  Some folks laugh at it, but they just don't understand how nice it is not to have my wireless mouse, eyeglass cleaner, mp3 player, two sets of headphones, USB headset, and dental floss (ok... I admit the dental floss is a little weird, but when you need it you need it) rolling around in a mess at the bottom of the bag.  I'm sold on the Grid-It.  I stand by my statement that square things fit better.  I wrap the headphones on wrapper like this [[ASIN:B005S7044M BDS - 3 Pieces of Smart Wrap Silicone Rubber Earphone/earbud Cord Manager Cable Winder Wrap Reel (Red, Blue, and Pink)]] and slip the whole thing into Grid-IT."
4.0,"A bit baggy, but I'll add a few tucks here and there to give it a bit more shape. Or add a belt. Otherwise very nice."
4.0,"I saw a lot of reviews about how easy the product breaks and how cheap it feels but considering the quantity of bras I would receive for that cheap price (and having a flash back of buying half the amount of bras at nearly 100 dollars) I decided that even if one broke it wouldn't be much of a loss. I'm a small busted woman so I knew that unless these were mega tiny fit wouldn't be much of an issue, I was mostly concerned about the quality. I've had the bras I purchased for 6 months now and not a single one has broken. They fit great and the quality of bra matches up to the quality of a bra you'd buy at target which is fine by me. I don't regret this purchase and I'd consider purchasing again."
4.0,i liked it alot.
4.0,Fabric is thin but its a cute dress. Great for the summer!
4.0,It's  really cute! And great quality but if you're heavy chested it probably won't work.
4.0,"This dress fits great , bought it in large to it wouldn’t be to tight. Fabric is thin however it does have double fabric in front over lapping so it’s not see thru. Do to the dark blue ok in back."
4.0,"I have been looking for a comfortable visor for my morning walks in the HOT FLsun.  The best one I ever found killed my head and I had to return it.  I bought this one in white and it is quite pretty.  The most important issue to me is the comfort and this is very comfortable.  Not sure what technology is used to secure it on the head but it is both gentle and secure.  I wore it this morning for an hour with no problem.  The reason that I gave it 4 stars is that, despite claiming a 50SPF, the sun lightly shines through.  I did walk by a window and the reflection confirmed that the visor was shading my face but I am a little concerned that it doesn't provide that level of protection.  I decided to try a darker color to see if it makes a difference so I ordered it in black."
4.0,If you're under 5'2 I don't recommend buying this. I have about one inch before it completely touches the floor. Unfortunately it's not made for us short girls. I recommend wearing a pair of boots with a heel so it doesn't drag.
4.0,This was a baby shower gift. It was well received
4.0,for the price it will work well
4.0,"These are exactly what I was looking for for my son. They have excellent traction, a flexible sole, and seem well made and comfortable. The only problem is they are huge! They might fit next year...... I suggest ordering a size down."
4.0,Nice soft cotton.
4.0,"I really like it.  Still getting use to it.  Only &#34;problem&#34; is one inner compartment is bigger than the other and one inner pocket is bigger than the other, but it just means I have to reevaluate where I put things.  It seems to be working fine."
4.0,A little more flimsy than i expected but they look good on if you like big glasses
4.0,"Even though the blouse was too small I managed to fit on it, and it looks so sexy, I wore it on a cruise the night of my anniversary, it was a head turning!! I wish it was a bit bigger, i guess it is from chine and their sizes are too small, other that that I love my top!!😍👌🏼"
4.0,Liked the glasses. No sticker.
4.0,I am wearing it now and I am pleased.
4.0,I'm 5&#34;4 and weigh 110 pounds and I bought a small. The dress is well made but was not flattering on my figure. I had to return.
4.0,"I want to start by saying I love this bag. Cool design, very practical and fits a ton of stuff. The bottom bag is great for my plastic worms/trailers and power bait. The top bag is awesome for about three plastic fishing trays (Flambeau 4007) a box for my spinners and buzzbaits, a small box for hollow frogs and maybe a little more. Plier holder is great and several more pockets on top of that. Only gripes is I have to lay both bags down and line up the zipper to put them back together and that can be a bit difficult. Also my IPhone 6s+ plus life proof case is too big for the phone holder. Other than that I’m really happy with the sturdy construction and I’d totally buy it again."
4.0,"Nice product, however the material is very stretchy so a smaller size would have been better.  Other than that I really like it"
4.0,Very comfortable and spongy . Like the straps-keeps your foot from slipping in the shoe even when your feet get wet
4.0,My girls love them! The flowers do come off easily. I could just glue back in but havent had time.....
4.0,Love the design on these how ever they are actually bigger than anticipated..still wear them though
4.0,"I really love this dress is perfect for summer. It kinda pushes the limit when it comes to length & the crossover in the front can make it a bit tricky to deal with if ur looking for modesty u might want to pin it towards the bottom so it doesn't fly open too much, I am a 34dd and it covered my boobs well.  I wore this to work on a Friday & got a few compliments, i also plan to wear this on my 1st upcoming cruise for my bday. I would highly recommend this dress/ pay attention to the size chart & order accordingly . I ordered a medium I am 5'2 curvy 140 lbs measurements are 34DD- 29waist - 39hips . I think this dress is a good bargain if you are looking for a light versatile cute summer dress :)"
4.0,Cute jacket— but I needed something a little more heavy weight with a roomy fit for my daughter.
4.0,I have ordered 4 of them different sizes first I ordered xl going by the reviews to big then I tried the medium couldn't get them up then I did the large black couldn't tell much different than the xl ordered brown in lg fix perfect so I don't know if it because of the colors but you can't go by the sizes.
4.0,Really like the shoes!!!
4.0,"It's a really nice mask and holds the filter really well! The only issue on it is the straps tend to get worn down pretty quick, but still hold together. Be sure to give the strings slack so you don't run into the same issue."
4.0,Nice....for the price it is very nice.  Pretty true to sizing.
4.0,Love the quality when worn. I only wash them in cold water on a gentle cycle but after a couple of washes the seams open up - otherwise great feel to the skin when wearing them.
4.0,"I love this hat. It protects me from the sun, and looks good doing it. Even after being thrown into my suitcase it comes out and looks good on my head."
4.0,"I bought these during Amazon Lightning deal, for a great price. The material is thin and lightweight, but not see through. The fit is a little more form fitting than a std. tshirt - which I like - but they may run small for some people. They are a good deal for the money."
4.0,"The purse itself is adorable.  I love the look, the size, the pockets...  I'm not a big fan of the soft leather (in a purse) cuz it makes it kinda floppy but I thought this was so adorable so I had to try it.  I do really like the purse... the floppy part is a personal preference."
4.0,The sides of the dress come up higher than expected and almost too short for a dress
4.0,"Even though the ad made it seem the trim was embroidered but it is actually screen printed. For the price, I shouldn't complain about the embroidered part but it is so long that it drags on the ground. I am 5' 4"" and I thought I ordered, the right size after reading the reviews. Disappointed that I can't wear it even with heels. Still way to long. I wore it outside one time And it is now soiled on the bottom so, I can't return. So disappointed. Alterations to the hem would cost more than the price of this caftan. Any advice on how I can return it after wearing would be greatly appreciated."
4.0,"These are great little dresses, and double as summer sleep wear."
4.0,"I really liked this buckle from the beginning because it is unique having wood inlays and scrolling.  Yet, I scrolling on the darker wood is somewhat hard to see unless the lighting is just right. I'm still happy with it though."
4.0,It was the perfect gift and it arrived on time.
4.0,"If I'm at the age where I have to wear bifocals at least i want to look good without spending a boatload of $$$$$. These are great, they come in a sturdy case."
4.0,"Fashionable, the quality of the belt is not as scheduled."
4.0,The piercing looks like a real septum piercing but after being in for a while it starts to hurt pretty badly. They look great though
4.0,It was a gift for my mother since she was a wine drinker and a traveler  and she loves it and if she loves it I love it!
4.0,"they're ok, but really hard to get on to a toddler.  harder than another pair i have."
4.0,"Not too much I can really say about them, they are designed to be work with elasticated bottom pants and fill the gap and they work well, I did use a translator to see what they words are on them ( trust me you need to check this stuff on some products) and its not anything that would make an Asian person laugh at you.  overall they hold up well"
4.0,"These ride down under my knee, they do not stay up on my thigh. However, they are cute and warm and do the job for under long skirts."
4.0,This sweater was the life of the party. It’s almost exactly as pictured. It does not have the high/low effect and like others said it will shed like crazy. After seeing how much it sheds I did decide to give it the shake down to allow most of the strings to give way while at home instead of leaving a while trail oan Giving hugs is a no no lol. I also gave a good pull around the neck so it would fall a little better. Overall this sweater is cute asf in person and I will be buying another one
4.0,"Great pants, just wish they were longer!"
4.0,Love this zip up sweatshirt. Pretty
4.0,My daughter likes this watch.  She thinks it looks cute and wanted to know if she could wear it to bed.  I said - sure!  The only reason I'm not giving the watch 5 stars is because of the instructions that came with the watch - not clear.  I found the instructions online - they worked great:  [...]
4.0,"I read other reviews, so I felt like I made the right decision on size. I am 5'6&#34; 140 pounds and have a 35&#34; chest, 29&#34; waist, and 42&#34; hips/butt so I order a US M / Asian L. The tag in both dresses indicates the Asian size. I ordered two different patterns and they both fit perfect. The fabric is very lightweight. There is not a fabric content tag, but it's either polyester or nylon. You will most definitely need to plan to wear a slip (especially with the lighter patterns which are quite sheer). Colors and patterns are true to pictures posted. I ordered on March 13th and package arrive on April 11th, also as expected."
4.0,"I was skeptical to purchase anything that didn’t already have a few reviews, but I love this watch! Exactly what I ordered and came in a day before it was due! It’s very thin and light weight! The only complaint I have is that there were no instructions to adjust the wrist, but it was really easy after a quick google search! Regardless, I highly recommend this watch! Hope this helps anyone considering it."
4.0,"Disappointed in the bra,it fit good around but the cup size was too big.It looked like a demi in the picture but it was a full size cup."
4.0,"Fits great! A little see-through at the bottom, but that's what I wanted!"
4.0,I’ve been told that 4XL means large in country that jacket is made in. Think if it’s sold in America it should be marked so Americans understand. Otherwise the jacket seems fine.
4.0,A little tight in the waist.
4.0,Is nice but the stone are plastic
4.0,"Loved everything about these socks EXCEPT for the fact that they squeezed my ankles like compression socks. I don’t think I have anything close to cankles, lol, but these were tight!  I’m 5’1” 110 petite woman, and my shoe size is 3 kids/ 4.5 women’s and the size 10/13 fit my foot perfectly. The sock portion on the foot is very nice, fairly thick, alpaca wool with a little bit of stretch. Holds their shape well & high quality. I would’ve rated them as 5 stars had it not been for the tight  ankle issue. Sadly...returning."
4.0,Mi uso
4.0,"These are leather and not as soft and flexible as I wanted.  I made the mistake, should have know better.  Still, I do like the colors and the sturdiness!"
4.0,"Nice belt, be aware they run little small. States waist size correctly, but I should have gone 1-2 sizes up."
4.0,This is fun and very cute bracelet. Was surprised on how fast it arrived.  It is light weight but very charming for a day out
4.0,This boot dryer works great.. adjustable temperature.. so they dont overheat or get to hot.. this unit also deodorizes your boots.. which is great for those hot wet summer workin days.. also works good for tennis shoes that you washed but dont want to put in the dryer.. and bc each leg is independent of each other.. you can dry one shoe or boot if only one is wet.. drying times vary depending on how wet your footwear is.. but still is quicker than waiting on them to dry in the dryer..
4.0,Most everything Sarda makes has a strong closure. Or double closure. This one easily pops open. not enough to lose it but just surprised. Wearing it stacked is fine. Still beautiful workmanship!
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable for hot days. Too thin for me to wear in public, but I bought as a house dress anyway. VERY long! I am 5'10"" and it is almost too long. The dark green is beautiful."
4.0,This is usually my choice in swimsuit. The only complaint I have is you do have to squeeze your hips into it since part of the waste section does not stretch.
4.0,It fit my body well but the bust area wasn't secure enough.
4.0,"I love the belt, it looks great! Quality is great! The only complaint is the smell. The belt smells very strong like stale cigarette smoke  The belt, the box that it came in and the plastic wrapping all have that smell. I ordered a replacement and it has the same smell! 😷. The quality is great but I don’t know if that smell will wear off……"
4.0,"Ok, for extra pairs to work on the my garden."
4.0,Cute dress. Fit a little smaller than expected.
4.0,"The armholes are huuuuge.  Just moving my arms normally you could see not only the sides of my bra but you could see the whole cup.  I think sewing the armholes should be an easy enough fix though.  The material is soft and drapey.  The size chart was not accurate for me, I chose my normal in store dress size rather than what the measurements stated and the dress fit very well.  I'm short so it is too long but hemming is easy."
4.0,Look as expected.  Not quite the fit I thought they would be.
4.0,Very comfortable and didn't ride up.
4.0,Cute shirt.. Didn't fit properly.. I'm 5'8 and 205lbs..
4.0,"This is the best glasses ever for a biclycle. Isn't hard change specs, just push in the center and done."
4.0,I love them because they actually look just like the picture but they also have no side effects meaning they are hypoallergenic and nickel free.
4.0,"I bought this beanie for my son.  My son is a paraplegic, which means anything that can help free up his hands so he can push his chair is a good thing.  The controls are easy enough, there is a volume up and down button and a play/pause button; he also stated that there are speakers on both sides of the hat.  From looking at this beanie you would never know he was listening to music instead of you ;-).  I gave it four stars because he made a comment that he wished the hat was a little bigger because he said he is afraid to pull it down on his head further because of the wires he does not want to break them."
4.0,I've bought field and stream glasses before and these are not the real thing.  On Amazon they seem to not have to abide by the same Copyright and Logo restrictions in the US for certain products.  Besides real field and stream glasses would have been a good bit less with far greater value.<br />Edit: in hindsight they really are a good pair of sunglasses even if they aren't exactly field and stream brand
4.0,maybe a medium size would have been better (but not available) and keeping it up on my nose is the problem.  If not speaking its ok but a nuisance if trying for a conversation...keeps slipping
4.0,My faux fur scarf arrived right on time.  It is very pretty & I think it will be a nice warm addition to my winter wardrobe.
4.0,They fit my Garmin forerunner 645 music. I just don't like that they don't lock in to the band. The watch band slides out of the loop all the time.
4.0,"I ordered extra large so they would be slightly loose, but they fit just right.  I love the material and I am wearing it frequently under open blouses and it looks great.  Rose"
4.0,Granddaughter loved these and fit as expected.  Only issue was these where smelly when received.
4.0,It looks good and the low tinkling draws attention. So far it hasn't tarnished and I have been wearing it for two months...even in the shower.
4.0,I love the print/design. I don’t wear this as much because the wrist band is not as comfortable for me.
4.0,Cute set for little helpers in the kitchen!
4.0,"Really cute though, i added a bit of color to mine"
4.0,"good fabric, ties well. unsure of how to hook the link on back but overall a quality product."
4.0,Great Love them
4.0,Very happy with these. They fit well and are so cute. Love these for a growing girl!
4.0,Really Comfortable and Extra Warm . Arrived On time. Jacket does fit a Bit small around the shoulders. Made with High Quality Materials
4.0,i bought it to use as a purse it is just a bit too big.  The snaps to make it a little smaller works great if you use the short straps.  The long strap will pull the snaps open every time. It seems though to be a great bag
4.0,"I purchased these to improve my night driving vision, and I believe they do that. They fit over my glasses and the plastic seems pretty sturdy, so I think they'll be fine. They seem to be a brighter yellow, less of an ochre or gold than others I've had and I believe I prefer the darker tone, but for the price they're a good buy."
4.0,"Darling jacket but it runs pretty small. I would go up a size or two. Very glad I purchased this cute jacket. You will be happy you did. Just remember, to go up on your size."
4.0,I really like it.  I got it to replace the heavy white Turkish Cotton terrycloth robe I usually get from Hammacher/Schlemmer. I wanted a darker color and a lighter robe.  I was hesitant because I was worried about the quality but I have been very pleased so far.  The fabric and construction seem to be very good but I have only had it for one week and haven't yet washed it.
4.0,"I got this Boat Hair, Don't Care Nautical Humor Cute Ladies Triblend Racerback Tank because I love boating! I ordered a size Large, based on the size chart, it said size 6 would be a large. It was actually pretty big, more like a size 8/10. It will just have to fit baggy style. I do like the length, its longer and hits about at my hips. The material is a nice soft cotton and polyester blend. It has a little stretch to it, so if it wasn't so big, it would be a nice fitted tank. The print and design looks very nice, I love the white and turquoise color! Its great quality, doesn't look like it would wear off easily. There were no loose threads hanging from the tank either, it feels and looks like a high quality racerback tank.<br />Since I did order the large, the arms arm holes are pretty big. This would be best worn over my swimsuit, which is perfect since I will wear this tank when we are boating. Great price too, I recommend this to anybody that loves boating!! Its a fun tank, very comfortable and great quality!<br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,"Shipping took forever, but it looks just like the picture. Note how it's very light and see through. This is part of the reason i bought it with summer coming up. It is long like shown."
4.0,I like thes wallet but with an iPhone 7 it’s a tight fit!
4.0,good looking and comfortable dot helmet...like it...and seller got it here fast..thxs
4.0,"excellent article, quite striking and comfortable.  I just did not like the box of the item, for the price a better image and presentation in the box would be appropriate"
4.0,"Both width and length are smaller then the standard cuff. It's high quality metal, however, that makes it difficult to adjust. I like it - just can't use it!!  Will give it to a Teen most likely :)"
4.0,True to size and the cut of the dress comfortable
4.0,These dresses are amazing. I'm a size 8; bigger bust and look so good on me. I got the evergreen and black one. Only reason why I'm giving four stars? The green is a different color than the picture. It's more of a Christmas bright green than a dark evergreen. But it still works 🤷🏼‍♀️
4.0,"Nice shorts but, could be a bit longer with the leg openings other than that they’re fine."
4.0,"These are cute sunglasses, very young style like mi little cousin who enjoyed receiving them as a gift as many others I bought. The expedition time was over what I was expecting which made me very happy"
4.0,"A bit odd, but I like the color. it is mustardy brown, not hte olive it appears on my monitor."
4.0,These are very nice leggings. Bright white. The flare bell bottoms with laces are so cute & attractive and they even fit well at the top (2x) and they're tall enough to wear with my platform sandals! Very happy. I  took off one star only because they are a little bit too sheer for me but I'm wearing to the knee bicycle style &#34;unders&#34;  to account for that and now they're just fine. Cute! Try them!
4.0,"Very cool design, very poorly made. Chronograph functions didn’t work and the band is so large it seems to be build for offensive linemen.<br />Customer service was fabulous!"
4.0,"This was my coming home shirt after surgery. It’s comfortable, it’s doesn’t stretch, but it’s breathable. And I love the pattern"
4.0,"The platform on this slipper make these a little edgier and more fashionable than your average slipper. Super comfortable, good quality. Straps are not adjustable but these fit true to size. 4/5 stars because the straps are beginning to curl up on the sides, I wish they were sown down so it didn’t look so sloppy. Overall, a good purchase."
4.0,"Really nice, not quite as vivid as the photo on Amazon but a nice face mask regardless"
4.0,The dress is super cute and it does fit me but just a little snug. I have big chest and it's hard for me to find stuff that fit without being baggy. The material is a little see through but I do have white/nude under garments that I can wear.
4.0,"I bought this shoes for my son to wear to a wedding. I bought the same size that he wears in a gym shoe, size 4. This turned out to be too big for this shoe. However, as I didn't have time to exchange them for another size, he wore the 4 and it turned out fine. The shoe didn't slip off his foot and he was comfortable. They looked very nice. Now the the wedding is over I'm glad he has a pair of dress shoes that he should be able to wear again as his foot grows."
4.0,Very nice ring. The only reason I took a star is because it's adjustable but it loses its shape like it won't go back to a perfect circular ring shape but I still love it
4.0,Love this! Comfy! Just wish the inside was black and not white!
4.0,Beautiful necklace. Great quality. Love it.
4.0,This clip does a good job of keeping the two halves together. An unexpected feature is the clip that allows the garment to be taken off without unclasping the clips. I wish it was smaller.
4.0,"Great pair of padded cycling shorts!  I use them when I cycle at the gym. I wear them under my gym shorts and have found them to be a great relief from having a soar backside.  They kind of take awhile to dry when you wash them out. Other then that, highly recommended."
4.0,"Size 150 translates to a girl's 12. My daughter wore this with a white sweater and knit Capri pants for Easter and got loads of compliments. Fabric is synthetic stretch, but the printing is high quality and I expect the dress to last until she outgrows it."
4.0,"I love this dress. Nice material, love the color, comfy but still dressy! I was disappointed with the straps. They aren't adjustable and the dress didn't sit where I wanted or where was flattering. Might be fine for others, but I ended up cutting the straps and sewing on new adjustable ones. Fits just how I want it now!"
4.0,"They’re large and show up when my hair is down. Because they’re very large, they do tend to go sideways which I prefer they didn’t do as much, but some people would probably prefer it.  Very colorful."
4.0,Great quality leather band. It is still rather stiff but still feels very durable.
4.0,prettier than I thought they would be. also more sturdy
4.0,My toddler loves all the different colors to choose from. They have been the longest lasting pairs of toddler sunglasses we've had so far!
4.0,"I am a tall “plus size” woman, so I find that men’s fitness clothing often fits me best.  These tights run true to size. They are lightweight, comfortable and work away perspiration effectively.  There is a small company logo (on the leg) made of reflective material.  It’s nice, bu not really big enough to enhance visibility, if you wear them for running outside.  A reflective stripe down each side would be better for that.<br /><br />There is a small zip pocket on the back, for a key or a packet of sports gel.  It’s handy, but a bit hard to zip back up.  Not perfect, but pretty good and very well-priced."
4.0,I love this dress but I was highly disappointed when I received it it was not the crisp clean white color like I expected it to be besides that very cute for the price
4.0,"I really like these cheater plugs. The lightest colored pair doesn't have the smooth finish that the other two pairs have. They kind of grab onto the tiny hairs on your earlobes and pull a bit. It's not painful or anything, just a bit of a weird sensation. They also soak up water really easily, so make sure to take them out before swimming or showering. Otherwise, I really like them. They have a great look and I've gotten several compliments on them. Good buy!"
4.0,Cute but some of them are very sharp.
4.0,"This vest came folded nicely in a plastic bag. The grey color is a great option for layering with multiple outfits. The vest is pretty soft and is comfortable to wear. As for fit, I ordered a medium and it is just a little bit big. I am a slim-fit medium/38-40R depending on the brand. I do not think that sizing down would have been the right choice, as with knitwear, the buttons can start gapping if it is too tight. Other than that, it seems to be pretty nice."
4.0,"Nice but three fell out already. I used four on one ear (3 cartilage/1 tragus) and two (1 cartilage/1 tragus) on the other. I’ve had them for a week, put them in day I received them. Day two, one had fallen out of the cartilage. Today both tragus studs were missing. I like the look, but maybe the backs should be a little bigger so they don’t fall out so easy. They are easy to insert, I didn’t feel any pain. As a nose ring, no problems at all."
4.0,"These capris fit very nicely.  Not a capri-wearing lady, but after recent abdominal surgery, I needed some stretchy-style pants to wear until I could fit into my regular clothes.<br /><br />These were really comfortable and the color is very versatile.<br /><br />Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars:  I ordered 2 different brands of capris, and one of them is now spamming me with email marketing messages.  DO NOT appreciate that!"
4.0,"I actually really liked the dress but wasnt sure of the color on me and didnt know how I liked the look of the front of the dress with my short stubby legs 😊. The material was nice, and loved the fit"
4.0,"This was advertised as a shirt, the closure area makes it more of a jacket. I was looking for a shirt/tunic look, so I returned it.<br /><br />There is no overlap at the front closing area and the closures are those toggles made of fabric (kinda hard to see with the pattern, but maybe if you zoom in on the picture). If you were to wear it, it probably needs a shirt on underneath or you will randomly have a few gaping areas in the front if you sit or move.<br /><br />Other than that, the quality seemed nice. The fabric is not thin, it is a nice weight fabric. The pattern is as seen on the picture.<br /><br />It was slightly odd fitting on me because I have ample chest/hip areas and there is no give and only one size available, but I think it could look really nice on the right shape.<br />If you look in the picture she has the sleeves rolled up. They are actually about wrist long sleeves."
4.0,"This keychain set will make a nice gift, however due to the thinness of the keychain, I highly doubt it will be something that can be used every day."
4.0,Stayed in great shape not tarnished  after a year
4.0,"Received quickly. Dress seems nice for the price,  bright color, soft material, runs large and 'flowy' all the way around. My only disappointment is that it fit tight in the upper arm area/mid/upper back. My chest is very large and I have broad shoulders though so I tend to have that problem a lot. Otherwise, cute dress. Maybe if I lose some weight it won't fit so tight in that area and I'll be able to lift my arms with ease. lol. For reference, I bought the XL and I'm 250 lbs at 5 ft 6 ish. :) (Apple body shape, meaning I carry my fat in my belly/front of my body.)"
4.0,Love it nicely made
4.0,"Nice wide belt, I do however wish the braided part went further around the waist."
4.0,"I did think that the whole inside piece would move, but only the gold colored piece inside goes back and forth. But the look and feel are still awesome"
4.0,Great invention
4.0,"I like this crossbody bag quite a lot. It checks a lot of my boxes.<br /><br />I normally drag around a rather large bag, even going up as large as a backpack, so I can drag around all the things I feel like I need or may need at any given time when leaving the house.<br /><br />The extra large setup works for me most of the time. But occasionally, the large bag leaves me wanting when I’m trying to run an errand or two quickly and I’m prepared to leave most of my stuff behind.<br /><br />This crossbody bag is excellent and fills that purpose for me. The faux-leather has a nice look - very high quality. I think a lot of people won’t realize that it’s not a leather bag. I particularly like all of the zippers and the different compartments that the zippers lead.<br /><br />I find the crossbody strap generous in size, which allows for all kinds of preferences. It can be worn as high up as you like or all the way down, sitting against your hip, and not be concerned that there's enough length in the strap.<br /><br />One thing in particular that I like about this bag is the quality of the zippers with one exception. I am fond of of the stainless steel zippers throughout because they rarely break. I say “rarely"" because I’ve never seen one break, no matter how much pressure I put on by over-stuffing my bag.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the main compartment has a synthetic zipper of some kind, probably plastic or nylon. For me to give this bag five stars, it would need to have to have stainless steel zippers throughout. That’s a personal preference for me. It may not matters to others.<br /><br />Beyond that, it’s a really nice little bag. I am going to use it probably more than I imagine because it has nice, thoughtfully placed compartments that makes it quicker for me to get in and out of places.<br /><br />The compartments make it much easier to grab what I’m looking during the times I pare down. I give this bag a high recommendation, but I’m have to take off one star for the zipper of the main compartment, not quite living up to its full potential."
4.0,"Beautiful dress but for some reason the inside lining is attached to the dress inside out, and with the dress being lace you can actually notice the seams being inside out. The inner lining is also very thin and see through, so it still requires a slip to be worn underneath. The dress trul is beautiful for the price but still thinking of returning/exchanging seeing that the inner lining is visibly attached inside out"
4.0,I like this. Fits as respected.
4.0,Fairly comfortable sock
4.0,"Good for the price, reason I left four stars is because one ripped while i was on vacation but overall a good product."
4.0,"This is a decent mask - I bought two of them.  A bit cumbersome to wear and clumsy to see out of, but not bad.  Not much luck getting it to glow - perhaps with a long exposure to uniform intense light, or maybe with a black light, but that's not what I bought it for.  It looks really creepy on and for the short film I'm creating it's perfect.  Need to wear with a mock turtle neck or a collared zentai suit to cover the bottom of the mask and make it look seamless.  The little figure that comes with it (don't know why they would pair these two items in a set) is cute and it DOES glow very well."
4.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. It is a good size, looks great, and the leather feels genuine."
4.0,"New spin on an old idea. We had mood rings growing up, so I was happy to see that they were still around.<br />These are nice."
4.0,"Good Quality, but somewhat small"
4.0,Silky and soft and fits nicely. I only wish it was just a tad longer.
4.0,"which is why I bought them. Otherwise, they are great. I wouldn't mind having them in a few other colors."
4.0,They are priced right and I like the styles.
4.0,"Bought this hat for my mom, who has cancer. It's so pretty!"
4.0,"Best quality kanna I’ve seen, but chest is very small so you may have to wear a binder."
4.0,"I like it but the top portion is very loose and the straps are thin,not adjustable."
4.0,IT doesnt blow loud
4.0,"Good fit but did not match the picture of the item.  Disappointed with the non-print on the fabric.  Otherwise, it seems like a good product with its lightweight material for water."
4.0,"Very comfortable ""classic"" style sunglasses with wooden side frames giving them a distinctive look.<br />UV lenses are blue reflective, but vision is clear and they do what they should.<br />The wooden barrel case is a nice touch, but probably impractical as it's quite large.<br />Inner soft cloth case is standard.<br />At time of review, these are showing as not available so I cannot comment on price or value, but expect them to be in the $20-$25 dollar range, and if so they are good value at that.<br />Sprung hinges so quite a snug feel, but overall I liked them. 4 stars"
4.0,"It's like swim suit material. Feels absolutely amazing.  The length is  perfect for my giraffe legs🤣. Good bust line. Not as transparent as I thought it would be. Overall,  it's a good dress."
4.0,Good quality. I cut the top of the thumbs so I could use my phone. It covers from feet to fingertips. I would size up from what you think you need because the fabric is quite thin so when it stretches slightly it turns a little see through. It is comfortable to wear and easy to put on and off.
4.0,"Got a medium for my boyfriend (5'11&#34; 168lbs.) he wears a 32x32 jeans, fit him perfectly in the waist and length! Soft material, and he loved them!<br />The shipping was a bit strange, I couldn't track them, and it said expected to arrive a month after I ordered them, but luckily I received them about 2 weeks after I believe. I would have liked to been able to track or at least a more accurate shipping time frame since I have all my stuff shipped to different locations depending on when and what I order."
4.0,"Fast shipping. These birdies are adorable, and good quality. You get 5 in the package. The description says that you get 3, and the picture shows 5 of them, so it adds a bit of an uncertainty when you are deciding to order this. The seller should fix the description. I had my eye on buying a tweety bird clip for a while. I knew that Funny Girl Designs sells a bird clip (with a baby clip attachment) for about $5, so I figured this was a good deal.<br /><br />This was a gift for my niece. However, they are too big for a 3 month old baby, and the alligator clips do not really work for baby hair. In the meanwhile, we played around by attaching them to her little kimono outfit as a decoration ,and to her soft curls. However, I think these will be perfect for when she is a toddler. I am glad I ordered these. I love the idea of these tweety bird clips, and might order them for my own child in the future.<br /><br />PS: While I don't use tweeter, I imagine this would make for a cute tweet image, aka to put a bird in someone's hair and take a pic. You'd probably get a lot of tweets, and re-twits in response to this stunt."
4.0,"I like the variety and price of these tank tops.  The are a little loose for my taste, but doable."
4.0,Love this stye. I love big sunglasses and these are fabulously huge. My one complaint is that they are a little flimsy. definitely can't throw them around.
4.0,It was a good value but other runside extremely small. You may want to go up a couple sizes for a nice fit.
4.0,"I ordered the Mother/Daughter locket. It’s a beautifully made necklace and locket that came in a cute and unique-shaped padded box. With that being said, here’s the thing: Maybe I keep missing the important part of this in the seller’s description, (and I’ve looked a few times but I can still be mistaken) it took me forever to figure out how to get the locket to open with out breaking it. It seems the only way to do this is to actually take the locket completely off the necklace since the necklace itself goes through the loops on top where you would pry to open. The hinges are at the bottom of the heart, and in the images, it seemed like they were in opposite spots, leading but me to believe it opens from the bottom. Personally I wouldn’t have chosen this particular one had I known, and I’m kinda sad about it. I bought this for my daughter. My sidekick and best friend. She’s 7 and going into 2nd grade. Due to schools closing early because of the pandemic, she didn’t get to finish her Kindergarten year. 1st grade she did remote at home. She has very high anxiety when she’s around a lot of ppl, especially when not in her own environment, making her EXTREMELY attached to me. While she’s super excited about going to school to be with her friends, she said she would miss me a lot and her older brothers a little bit too. She asked to bring a picture with all of us like the did for kindergarten. I figured with a locket, she can look at us whenever she’s sad or anxious, instead of waiting until she’s next to her backpack, which was usually the end of the day. But with this locket only being able to open when it’s off the chain, that sorta puts a kink in my plan. She says she still loves it because it came from me, but I feel bad she won’t be able to open it whenever she’s having a moment. I’m not sure if this item even has any reviews yet, and if it does, I’m not sure if this “issue” was mentioned since I viewed probably hundreds of other lockets, descriptions and reviews and didn’t think to look before writing all this. I know many ppl order lockets to hold pictures of loved ones here and passed, and find comfort in being able to easily see them whenever you want. For some that may not be a big deal, in which case I wouldn’t highly recommend. For those who would have the same feelings as I do, then I would not recommend. I gave it 4 stars cause there’s no doubt it’s very pretty. I would’ve given it 5 if my daughter would be able to open it whenever she wanted throughout the day."
4.0,"I'm a size 5, and I ordered a 5.5. It fits and is comfy upon standing for a good amount of time without discomfort. I was so happy that it fit, mainly because of the ankle strap."
4.0,"Originally bought it stop my brother (11y) from chewing on his shirts around the collar area. It was uncomfortable for him at first but it stopped the behavior from happening. Unfortunately, he takes it off to sleep and our dogs got to it before he could and chewed it up so it only lasted 2.5 weeks.<br />Had to make it 4 out 5 because when it arrived it had a weird plasticky smell. When I tried to wash it out with soap and warm water, it made it smell like a “pool”. It took a few days for the smell to really go away."
4.0,gift for my girl
4.0,"Was supposed to be capri length, but was full length, still really comfortable!"
4.0,Good case for large (sun) glasses
4.0,"This is a set of very nice, simple neck gaiters. You get two, one black and one gray neck gaiters for just $9!!!  These are nice thick neck gaiters, that are fleece lined and will keep you nice and warm during the colder days, so perfect for winter especially. They are washable, breathable, stretch and have an adjustable strap which is nice.<br /><br />The material is nice and thick and does have the fleece liner, as I said. These will work for dust protection or when you do sports activities and need to protect mouth and nose. They will keep you protected from COVID to some degree, especially since they are so thick with the fleece liner and all. But keep in mind some places don’t allow these types of gaiters as mouth/nose protection as being compliant."
4.0,"I purchased this as a gift. It is a good fit and great quality shirt, not cheap feeling like some others I've seen."
4.0,One of the rings didn't have the screw to connect to the other side.<br />The rest of them are perfect.
4.0,Smaller in the chess than average size. I’m 6’ 4” and 195lbs.And it barely fits me in the chest. But overall good construction well-made
4.0,"This hat is high quality product, but the reason I returned it is because the size. it is larger than my head lol."
4.0,"I like the product, it is very comfortable except that it is itchy and I have to use a t-shirt under this.  I washed it with fabric softener and it is still itchy."
4.0,nice watch.  lotsa compliments.  but it is extremely chunky.
4.0,Holds the IDs I need it to hold but am disappointed that the window ID holder doesn't have a slot where I can easily slide out the ID when I need it. Very nice quality and can see myself using it every day
4.0,To large my fault can find some use for it though.
4.0,"I love these shoes; they're adorable and gave my new walker a good grip on hardwood floors!  The only thing I don't love is that the difference in size between the 6-12 month size and the 12-18 month size is huge, and my daughter was sad to have no &#34;owl shoes&#34; while she was in between!"
4.0,I ordered these 1/2 size larger so that I could add an insole with arch support. With that in the shoes they're comfortable and supportive enough to keep. Very cute and breathable.
4.0,Great product great price. Fits a little snug and she’s an x small.  Gaps a little at buttons.
4.0,"My eldest teen wears this when he wants to add a bit of style to an outfit. The face has some weight. It's encircled in shiny black with engraved numbers. There's chrome-looking stainless steel rays that extend outward on each end. This brightens up the thick, grooved flat black (silicone) wrist band.<br /><br />The time is easy to set with the large middle button (pull out and turn to set, then press back in). The hour and minute hands glow in the dark.<br /><br />The two side buttons can be pushed, but don't appear to do anything (the three faces on the background are merely a shiny, intricate design).<br /><br />My son appreciates the look, but misses not having the date feature that was on his old watch. Also, this thick band tends to make his wrist sweat. I noticed that there's thin grooves on the inside band that hold onto dirt (see photo), so this watch will require periodic scrubbing. Thankfully, it's water resistant.<br /><br />*Complimentary watch provided for testing and review purposes."
4.0,"Description says ""Lightweight Fabric"" so it's like a thin t-shirt.  Cute little sayings and just an easy, comfortable shirt for my baby.  I bought the XL for my 12mo old (who's been 40%ile weight, 90%ile height) and it is pretty big on her.  I probably could have gotten a L (maybe a M), but it still fits fine and it seems really comfortable on her, not ""too big"" that it doesn't work now.  I think I'll continue to get some more shirts, and I just need to find a good source of comfy knit pants in her size that aren't too expensive.  Together they make a great outfit for everyday play - comfy, but still cute."
4.0,It's a nice necklace for me.
4.0,"It’s not super comfy, but I needed this type of bra for a specific outfit. It got the job done and I didn’t want to spend a lot of money. I would recommend for occasional/<br />Special wear."
4.0,Do their job.  Not as wide as I thought but do a good job of keeping you cool.  I like them.
4.0,"Very cute. I got a medium since I wasn't sure about the sizing, its a little big but still love it. I'll get another one but small."
4.0,Came in time. Looks like the picture. I am a happy customer..
4.0,"Pros: Bar is a good length. Not too snug, not too loose.<br />  Bioflex is very soft and comfortable.<br />  Far less noticeable than traditional metal jewelry.<br /><br />Cons: The push in top can be very difficult to do without using a mirror.<br />  The push in top is not clear, but kind of a frosted white. My facial hair does a pretty good job of hiding this, but not everyone has that  option.<br />  Some of the push in tops have some slightly sharp edges. Can be filed down for comfort I'm sure, but it hasn't been enough of a burden for me to try.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased with the product. Would receive 5 stars if the push in end was as clear as the post it pushes into."
4.0,I’m an electrician so this fits perfect for the application. Very light weight and looks good
4.0,My child like it
4.0,Soft.  Like the fit but the pockets have holes inside. Doesn’t make sense.  I guess you get what you pay for.
4.0,Really cute and comfortable. It fit as expected for a medium
4.0,"It was somewhat small, still fit and is a gorgeous top.  Love it."
4.0,"I bought these for my husband for our honeymoon, he wanted something &#34;tropical&#34; they were perfect!  They run a little bit big but they still worked, however they are a little bit longer than most his other board shorts.  These are really great quality and I would definitely recommend them."
4.0,Soft and wonderful display.  The print makes the shirt rise a bit and had to pull it down.  Maybe after a few washes it won’t do this.
4.0,Good price for 3 they are a little sung on me but that’s ok I’ll be buying more in a size up.
4.0,Graphic on one a little crooked.
4.0,Nice compliment piece!!
4.0,"I took my new bra out for a three mile run yesterday. It fit comfortably, nothing irritated or chafed, it kept me bounce free, and I didn't feel like i had to rip it off the second I got home. I ran it through a wash and dry cycle and it came through without damage, stretching or discoloration. A few people have said that it's hard to put on, but I did not find it difficult to hook both sets of hooks in front and then &#34;spin&#34; it around back and get my arms through the straps. I wear a 38C in a standard bra and that's the size I bought in this one. The band is snug on the outermost set of hooks but not uncomfortably so - it fits the way I want my running bras to fit, and I'll be able to use the it on the tighter hooks as it gets older and stretches a bit, so I expect to get some good use out of it. I'll give it another star if I still like it and it holds up well after a few months of runs.The best bra I've ever found at this price point."
4.0,These pants are see through.
4.0,I ordered this in the XXL size.... Fits like a medium. It arrived fast. Nicely packaged. It looks exactly like it was described. But the sizes apparently run small. Item would be perfect for petite women. Tat is the only reason I only gave 4 stars. I loved it otherwise. Love the material. So if your a smaller sized woman..don't order your regular size. Order at least a size up and you won't be disappointed!! I did receive this product at a discount in return for my unbiased review. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask.
4.0,Love this costume! Would’ve given it 5 starts but the skirt is SO SO SO short! I’m 5’3” and 150 pounds and normally wear a size 10-12 for reference. I had to wear a longer crinoline underneath and black tights to be able to even wear it. I wore a red leotard underneath the vest instead of the white top provided to make it more Christmas-y.
4.0,"This hat is really cute. I feel like I have a fuzzy stuffed animal sitting on my head, which I mean as a compliment. I really like this  hat a lot. I cannot wait to wear this with my fuzzy boots and leggings in the colder weather. The only caveat it is is dry clean only and um...yeah I just don't see that happening for a hat. It fits a little loose, but I have a smaller than average head and it has snaps under the chin which gives it some degree of adjustability.  The material is really soft. This would probably do best in winter days without flurries or very brisk Autumn mornings. It's adorable though."
4.0,This is a good product for the price tag. It is made out of good and solid materials and doesn’t feel cheap. The only con is ounce in awhile through out the day you might need to readjust the magnet on the band for a tighter fit. This takes less than a second and isn’t a worry if mine but should be noted.
4.0,"Lovely necklace, but small. Good gift for a young girl, maybe 6-14 years of age. Too small for mature adult."
4.0,"It's kind of 'picky' when you are wearing it - that is, the metal is sides are not finely polished. Otherwise, no complaints."
4.0,"These are borderline luxury mixed with military style stocks. It's as if they paired the ruggedness of a military style socks with the aesthetics of a luxury branded socks together to form the ultimate sock. These socks were made to face any tough situation yet look good whilst doing so.  These are some well made socks, you can see the quality, the stitching, the materials are all top notch.  You can also feel the compression, the thick padding for ultimate comfort & dryness. I highly recommend these socks."
4.0,"We purchased these to use with Speedo vanquisher goggles and they will not fit in the goggles. If you are purchasing for Speedo, might want to reconsider your purchase. While I these did not work with our goggles the company was very helpful and refunded our purchase price. Good company, but not for vanquisher goggles"
4.0,"I bought a pair of both tan and black. I like the slight wedge and they seem comfortable. The only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is because I feel like the band on the toes makes my feet appear wider than they are, if it was a little higher on my foot it would balance better. I ordered my regular size, not sure if sizing up .5 would make a difference. Overall, they are perfect for sandals under $20. The buttons and wood grain add a nice touch!"
4.0,Very comfortable. Great for hanging out at home or running a few quick errands. I'm 5ft and about 133lbs. Medium was perfect.
4.0,"These were not rigid at all. Very soft and flexible with movement. No problems with rubbing or chaffing. Very cute cherry design. Fit a little on the big side. Overall, happy with these sandals."
4.0,"I'm a standard medium/large in tops depending on the style.  I bought this in the Army Green, size medium. It was really cute, but the fabric in front was just a little too much.  I'll probably re-order in a size small & see how that goes. Can't beat it for the price."
4.0,"for everything you get, the wig, the dress and the accessories, its worth it.<br />the headpiece is long but i just used clips to shorten it. the socks kept falling down but other than that, not much to complain about"
4.0,"These are a great pair of pants to own. Yes, the are true to size. You will love these pants. There is just one problem they have. The pants come a loose at the seams every seam dose this! Only to down fall to a wonderful pair of pants!"
4.0,"This goes perfectly with my Mario costume, and the bag is more spacious than I thought it would be.  The straps are a bit shorter than I was expecting; it's definitely not something that works as a shoulder bag, which is what I am used to (hence 4 stars instead of 5, but that is just my personal preference).  Regardless, it is a perfect accessory to a Mario/Luigi costume.  I'd highly recommend!"
4.0,"UV protection for swimming or walking in sun. It’s not overly hot, which I like."
4.0,Very well made and there what o wanted.
4.0,The second pair ripped as I was getting it past my heel. In pic #6 cardboard is put into one sock to manipulate a foot and ankle to stretch the sock out while to other sock is stuffed into the first sock with the cardboard. That’s why one sock looks like something for an adult and the other looks like one for a toddler. The ones with smaller holes have great stretch tho. I wear a US women’s 9 and they fit well. Tight around the ankle but nothing too irritating. Can’t wait to wear them
4.0,"I noticed that they ran a bit larger, but still fit comfortably."
4.0,It’s very nice I  use it for most of my bags
4.0,"It's really nice, but fits loosely"
4.0,Works well but I think it might be too small for me.
4.0,"I like the dress, the skirt just isn't what I expected. The material is a bit stiff and I was expecting it to be flowey, therefore the wrinkles are a bit hard to get out. LOVE the pockets ."
4.0,"Belt doesnt have enough holes, tried to poke one to make it tighter and it split, looking for thinking belt to replace"
4.0,"Fits really good, just wishes the bottom hung a little longer and slendering"
4.0,Beautiful! Order your exact size and you will be very pleased.
4.0,Found the straps a bit confusing and cumbersome but delivers on purpose.
4.0,"Thank you for this women's scoop neck sleeveless shirt.  I really like the feel of the fabric that this shirt is made of.  It is quite soft for a t-shirt type of fabric.  I like the basic style but this shirt does run smaller than some.  I ordered the same size in this shirt that I normally wear when buying from the store but this shirt is quite tight on me.  It is definitely a youth size and not a women's size.  I do like the color and feel of the fabric and design of the shirt, it seems to be of good quality workmanship just too small so you would need to buy a size bigger than you normally wear.  I received this shirt at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Good quality fabric , fits exactly and very comfortable."
4.0,"I love the way it looks but didn’t anticipate for it to be so big! It’s okay, it’s comfy and the lettering is well done"
4.0,Was great.  Just what was needed for a dance performance.
4.0,Really cute! My husband likes it very much! Is a bit smaller That what I wanted but overall it looks good.
4.0,"Very cute style! My only issue is the top section - I have large breasts with small hips - hard to squeeze all of my top into this. Love the suit though, very unusual!"
4.0,"I usually wear a size 10-12 in a dress. I'm 4 11&#34;, 36 G -BUST & 150 LBS. The dress came to the bottom of my calf and flared out wide. You might want to purchase a half  tank top or sports bra because it fits very tight on the bust. It made my chest look smashed. The material was magnificent and I received several compliments on the stitching design."
4.0,I like the silkscreen-seems durable through many washings.
4.0,Nice dress however I listened to most reviews that recommended ordering a size up; I've reordered this dress in my regular size and hope it fits; stay tuned...
4.0,"Wonderful, comfie Top!"
4.0,"For all my tall & curvy girls: For one I am 6 ft tall and these pants are so long on me, I’m in love. I am curvy so the 3xl fit perfectly. The material is thin *henceforth 4 stars* but for the price these are a perfect buy"
4.0,"Is cute well made, I received a lot of compliments beauty color Thanks!"
4.0,"So great! Using them for resin jewelry and even with my beginner status they are turning out great!! There are a lot of bunny bezels though, which I think seem out of place with the space and weird theme, but I'll use them regardless!"
4.0,Lovely but small
4.0,These are very comfortable and breathable.
4.0,"Recharge socket bruises the feet, had to use plaster to cover the usb connections."
4.0,"I saw these on a Facebook mom's page and thought what a good idea but I don't want to spend $50 on one.  So I found this one to review and decided to give it a try.  I have 2 little girls,  2 y/o and 7 months,  so I always have a hair tie or 2 on my wrist.<br /><br />My 2 y/o lives playing with bracelets so she loves playing with it.  I on the other hand don't like this as much as I wanted to.<br /><br />Pros<br />*This bracelet is beaitiful, the detail on the ends is very pretty<br />*the hair tie go around well,  there's space for 2 regular ones.<br />*the metal is strong and sturdy<br /><br />Cons<br />*it's very loose sos I had to squeeze it, it doesn't come off easily now.<br />*it moves around like a bangle, it rubs against my nomination bracelet and my citizen watch,  it's annoying<br />* I can't carry babies around without scratching someone or hurting someone.<br /><br />I guess this will go in my jewelry box and come out either for special occasions and/or when my girls aren't babies<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Its a great band, though the fit is a little tight when trying to attach it to the Pebble. This is manageable though."
4.0,Great product but the neck hole is a little on the small size. My son has a normal size head and it was a little hard to get it over his head.
4.0,Nice set of socks.  I wish I would've known that it was coming in sets of 2 of each color.  A person really only needs 1 set of each color.
4.0,"These are very well constructed luggage tags. Very durable and should last a long time . An information sheet with your details is surrounded by a thick hard blue plastic enclosure. Affixed to the tags is a long plastic piece to securely keep your tag affixed to your luggage.They are a deep blue color, and the set of ten is awesome.<br /><br />I'll use these to put on my carry on items. If I take a duffle bag or tote bag or any other big bags, or smaller sized luggage I think it will be great for those items. They're pretty easy to attach to your luggage just run the plastic through the loop and push the two prongs in and you're done.<br /><br />The tags aren't overly huge but they're not very small. Good size for them to be recognized I would say. It looks good with my luggage and I find that traveling these days I need my information on everything that I carry because its so easy to loose it. Like the time I was going on vacation and went to the restroom and I noticed that the woman who came in front of me left her purse. There was no tag on it but luckily I remembered what she looked like so I was able to return it to her before she was boarding her flight. This is why I tag everything because these kind of things happen when you're trying to make that flight. I received this item free in exchange for my honest review of it."
4.0,"I'm wearing this right now and it's a little loose. I'm going to wash it in hot water and see if it shrinks. If not, I'll have to take it somewhere to get fitted because I love this sweater! My sister even told me that it makes her comfortable when she hugs me :)"
4.0,Nice for under a sweater but fit about two sizes smaller than expected
4.0,Pros:<br />- Good material<br />- Solid zippers<br />- Plenty of pockets<br />- Left or right shoulder<br />- Metal ring for outside extras<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Leather quality is so-so<br />- Doesn't fit an A4 folder :( by a tiny bit )<br />- All clasps and buckles are non functional and for decoration only
4.0,Itd a great top.. Wish  it was a little longer ..and the sleeves are beautiful. Fell very different than the light waffle fabric. I like it very much!
4.0,The knit is nice and heavy.  Sweater hangs nice....HOWEVER..it is really large through the shoulders.  I am very broad shouldered and I seldom have the complaint that something is too broad through the shoulders.
4.0,"I love the way these shoes look and my son is happy to wear them to his baseball games.  I have to really loosen up the laces to get them on.  I wish they were just a little bit wider, but overall they fit well.  I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,Nice relaxed baggy top to wear on lazy days!
4.0,"Im 5'5 around 125-130. Wear a 34c cup. I got a size x-small and this dress fit perfectly and its very flattering. Its thin though but stretchy. I bought dark green but im sure if i wouldve bought white, it wouldve definitely been see through. Not wearing it to the occasion i was going to due to the weather being cold. Its more of a summer/warm dress.<br />I also believe it said it couldnt be used in the washing machine. So thats a bummer.<br />Ill give it 4/5 stars"
4.0,Dress is cute kinda looks like PJ’s though. Order up in size if you are big busted.
4.0,"This necklace was a bit smaller than I imagined it would be, but it is exactly as shown and quite beautiful! Perfect to wear for my &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; themed Bridal Shower coming up!"
4.0,Swimsuit is very cute!  Only thing negative I can say is that it isn't lined at all especially in the top portion. A little lining would be nice even for little girls.
4.0,"I really like the look.  I am using it for a work bag and wish it was a touch bigger.  With a standard sized portfolio holder in it, it won't zip.  Still, very professional looking.  I get compliments on it."
4.0,This bag is just right for my commute and work day.  I carry my IPad and Surface Pro3 along with essential cords and a folder or two.  Leather is supple and classy.  I have had the top zipper separate because of overloading and the straps are not as wide or substantial as I would like.  I would buy this bag again.  It looks professional and can easily be carried by handles or straps.
4.0,Gorgeous love it!!!!!!
4.0,Grandson liked
4.0,"I love these shoes because they are so durable. This is our third pair. I was miffed when I got a pair yesterday that were a half size bigger than what I ordered. I don’t have time to return them, because I’m too busy. Attention to detail is important. Sigh."
4.0,"I like this watch, but the time is never right, and I am constantly having to fix it.  I think the battery is old.  I would think that if you buy a new watch the battery should last at least a year."
4.0,I received my dress today and I'm torn on whether or not to return it.  I know this type of dress is expected to fit snug but I ordered a large and it fits like a medium.  I'm 5'3 and 144 lbs and I thought the dress would have a little more give to it.  I'm hoping they will have XL in Stock soon.  Overall really love this sexy dress!
4.0,Great for the price. Pants were way too long though.
4.0,Our daughter has incredibly long legs but a waist that is a little small for her age. She is sensitive to materials and we have had the hardest time finding anything that is long enough for her because she won't wear jeans. We bought the 12 - 13 size and they were a perfect fit - she even has a little bit of growing room. These are a God send!!  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars right now is because she hasn't worn them yet and they haven't been washed. I hope to goodness they hold up.
4.0,"This purse arrived in a really tiny package.  At first I thought I had not received what I ordered, but it was just really, REALLY packed in there.  As a result, it was kind of wrinkled, but it is fabric, so that is not too bad.  What I did notice was that after I was caught in the rain one day, it is slightly waterspotted.  It has lots of compartments in side, and I like it in general, but the wrinkles and waterspotting are a bit of a negative."
4.0,"The product is good.  Comfortable and keeps your feet warm.  However, by the 2nd or 3rd use, one of them got a small hole."
4.0,A little bigger than i expected but still cute
4.0,I like the size and durability of this lunch box. It is easy to clean and very stylish/versatile.  I do wish it had some different compartments or pockets.
4.0,"I love this top, very pretty. Runs big."
4.0,"This dress is well made, but I did not expect the fabric to be like that of a sweater dress, with a very tight knit. It is soft, though. My wife is 5ft 4in and the dress extended about two inches below her knees. Also, I received it with a couple of snagged threads in the chest area."
4.0,It shrinks in hot water.
4.0,Fits better then thought it would. We will make it work for daughters wedding.
4.0,First let me say this dress is beautiful very nice material however the sleeves are too small I had to cut them off on the shoulder I think because I have big arms but I saw another review complaining about the sleeves. I wore it at women conference and I received good compliments. I paired it with a small blazer and a belt although the belt is not necessary the dress is still beautiful with the belt. I loved everything from quick delivery to nice packaging except the arms.
4.0,Wife loves the glasses
4.0,Because of my broad shoulders and big arms the 'shoulders' on this blouse would not stay on and the arms were tight. I could go up one size but the sleeves and body would now be long I suppose. It is a pretty blouse but I have to return.
4.0,The ring is very cute. But as my daughter bent it to fit her finger it made a snap noise and bent the ring. Afraid if we bend it anymore it will break in half.
4.0,"These glasses were a gift for my mom, but I guess they run a tad bit small."
4.0,Love the Halloween decor.....gets a little grayish when stretched
4.0,"Four stars because that is the most someone can expect from an $18 clutch. This is a good size, the color is nice (blue), and the material is soft and rich. My only complaints are that the credit card slots are odd sizes - one is too big and another too small for a credit card - and I can see what people are saying about the zipper. It seems like it's only a matter of time before it malfunctions. Otherwise, I'm really happy with my purchase!"
4.0,I loved them they were just to small.  So I gave them to my daughter
4.0,Clips very easy
4.0,If you are thinking medium buy a large.  Otherwise it fits fine and is very cute!
4.0,"Nice casual dress for the price! Amazon recommended me size XL,  I’m 5.8 ft and I usually wear M/L.<br />The length is ok since I bought a size up but it’s a little baggy for me.<br />The belt would be more functional if it was not attached to the dress (it creates a bulge on the front or back, depending on how you tie it."
4.0,"Love the dress, fits as expected and described."
4.0,The straps are a bit long but easy to pin up or tie up.
4.0,"This product was decent. The length I was not in liking. It goes well passed my knees. I'm 5'2 and 115 lbs. I am a 34DD and not so curvaceous. But, I'm using it as a homecoming dress. It's well worth the price, just me being short I want to take it up a couple inches. I don't need to wear a bra. The straps hold the girls great. Thanks Amazon!"
4.0,These pants fit nicely but would pull down.  You constantly pull them up and I couldn’t wear a belt with them. The elastic was not tight enough around my waist plus it was too long waisted.  I think if I had ordered a smaller size it would’ve been OK. I didn’t wanna do that because then the pants would fit tighter and basically become yoga pants.
4.0,"I have had mine in for about a week and habe had no problems so far.  I wish it was a bit shorter, but I won't cut it because that will cut off the threading to screw the balls on. I did end up replacing one of the balls with a smaller one because i wanted to give my belly button room to pop out."
4.0,This top was well made and the fabric was much better than I expected for the price. I was trying to match a top with a pair of pants and the one I picked just did not work so I had to return it. I usually wear a medium and that’s what I ordered and it fit perfectly.  Will definitely look at other patterns in this line.
4.0,Only reason I didn’t give this product 5 stars is the fit on the Apple Watch isn’t as clean as I expected (you can see the slight gap) but so far no issues with it falling off! I needed a watch band with holes because my original Apple Watch band kept slipping down my wrist from sweat when I jog. After an hour of exercise this band has not moved at all. Would recommend! Color is very cute too.
4.0,"Little hot, liiitle more fabric than necessary."
4.0,"Although, I selected an XL, even though I normally wear a M, this material is nice, and it looks good on me."
4.0,"I loved the dress and got many compliments.  I would have given 5 stars, but the fabric is really thin and the drawstring at the bottom is too long so I had to double tie it.  Pair it with  some heels and you will be the belle of the ball!"
4.0,Some do not look like picture but for the most part they are very cool
4.0,If you regularly a medium buy a large!
4.0,"Bought this belt to add a waistline to some of my dresses! It’s very cute and very versatile for a lot of different styles! The band is elastic which I didn’t know based on the reviews, but it still looks nice. Good buy for the price!"
4.0,Nice watch for the price. Some of lights don't display very bright.
4.0,"Fits a tad loose, but that's how a jersey should fit! Very comfortable and the colors are bright. I'd buy again."
4.0,"Soft, easy to wear dress. This is a nice dress to throw on quickly but still look pulled together. The belt line sits too high on my waist but I can't fault the dress, I am high waisted. This can be dressed up or down and seems cool for the warm weather."
4.0,"Great quality, however i have a giant head so the hat is a bit snug."
4.0,I'm not crazy about the shirt but the pants were a little large. It kept me moderately warm in -13 degree temperatures.
4.0,Not bad it's just tighter than I expected it to be because it looks loose fitting in the picture. But it still did an still looks nice. Like the shirt
4.0,"Was pretty stiff at first but broke in quickly to accept the number of cards as advertised.  Built tough, I think I'll have it a long time!"
4.0,"I love the strap design in the back, the material feels really nice, and it doesn't squish the girls in to give the appearance of a uno-boob. The only complaint I have is, it's thin material so once you put it on, you can absolutely see the padding plain as day.  I removed my padding and I love it so much more!"
4.0,Most are small for an adult
4.0,Fit as expected. Great option to have detachable interior jacket which adds warmth. Held up well during its first deer season.
4.0,"I have a smaller than average beancase. Most regular hats in US stores need to be sized down as far as it will go, or worse modified to fit nicely. Being manufactured in China, I took a gamble that the size would be smaller and this hat fits perfect. It does have two adjustable straps on either side that could accommodate a wide range of sizes, and I have mine set about 25% of the way to the smallest size.<br /><br />Girlfriend isn't delighted with the slightly shiny finish, says it looks like cheap pleather, but I've had other waxed fabric hats before and it's not that different."
4.0,Cute shoe - it was just too small for my daughter to wear returned it & ordered the correct size
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for, will definitely purchase more!"
4.0,Would have preferred diabetic sock material.
4.0,"While it was a tad smaller than I expected, I have to say that it really is a nice looking necklace. Most importantly, she loved it! While there's only so many of these you can really give a lady, I definitely recommend giving this one."
4.0,This set is great because it gives you so many options. The studs themselves are a bit hard to get in. They are made well and are very durable. The spiral ones don't work in my cartilage piercing though unfortunately and those are the ones I was most excited to wear. Other than that though it's a good bundle of earrings. They stay in well and don't irritate my ears.
4.0,"This is a nice, simple digital. The strap is a bit sketchy and the light might as well not be there, it's so dim. But, for the price, it's an adequate timepiece."
4.0,Wore a couple of times before washing. It shrunk quite a bit.
4.0,"I wanted an oversized sweatshirt feel, so based on reviews i sized up. I’m 5’1” and 125 lbs. I’m normally a size small but i ordered a large. It’s a loose fit but definitely not oversized. The material is between a shirt and sweatshirt material/thickness."
4.0,"I like the bracelet. The quality for the price is good, but the length is a little short. I will be giving it as a Christmas present."
4.0,it is dark
4.0,"I have received a lot of compliments on this necklace it is beautiful and different. it's lightweight, the stones are perfect but unfortunately after 2 days of wear the chain has changed a bit in color."
4.0,Love these! I get compliments on them all the time. After a few uses one has stopped moving that's the reason why I only gave 4 stars. I really just bought them for the look and not for the movement within them. Overall I'm happy with the product and have recommended friends to make the purchase as well.
4.0,They are kinda wide in the bridge of the nose but omg so different I love wearing them
4.0,Not bad at all. Would recommend.
4.0,Perfect size and color!
4.0,The color is more a flat black than glossy. Very light weight and inexpensive. A good value.
4.0,Very spacious light weight and easy to carry with lots of pockets. The shoulder strap adjustment is way too long for short people like me and no place to put the left over strap length but overall a great value
4.0,"muy buena calidad, pedi un small y parece medium. me quedo muy largo en la parte interna del muslo"
4.0,"The denim does become stretched out so the jeans lose a little of their shape by end of the day, but otherwise, these are great!"
4.0,"The hat is very lovely. It’s not a full had, more like a head band and it fits perfect on my 3 yr old. Compared to adult size."
4.0,These are nice masks except for the smell. They need to be washed.
4.0,Shrinks drastically when you wash it & the arms are a little short.<br /><br />I bought a Med<br /><br />still comfy with leggings
4.0,"This is a review for both the gray and dark green capris, size Small. I'm 5'1"", 112 lbs., and the small was a tad loose. I personally don't like compression-type wear anyway, so I'm okay with that. The material and stitching are very good. Squat-proof, stretches well. The cut, not so much. I returned the dark green because it just didn't look good on me, but I kept the gray. We all have our fat/bloated periods, so I'm keeping the gray for that. I do enjoy the CADMUS brand -- I have other items from their store and I enjoy their products."
4.0,"I bought this top in 3 colors and the only reasons I gave it 4 stars is that I had to hem each top up at least 2 to 3 inches as fairly long. They also came with a Nike price tag on it listed as $28 but the price was $35 through Amazon which was a bit of unwelcome information. I'll probably go direct to Nike next time for this product. Also, the dark gray top wasn't actually a dark gray. Looked more like a light gray."
4.0,"This suit is actually very pleasant on, I ordered a medium, 125lbs and size 34 DD, it was a tad tight so I will be ordering a large to compare it but otherwise, I was very pleasantly surprised!!"
4.0,This piece complimented my costume perfectly. The chains either broke very easy or detached from the fabric because the metal rings had a small space in them. For me it was an easy fix each time so it didn’t play a huge effect on my purchase but I definitely say for the price it was worth it. It did the job and finished my costume!
4.0,The length is shorter than I expected but still a useful item.
4.0,little bulkey it is a great case though
4.0,Great quality for a fraction of the price of others like it. Very nice!
4.0,"This romper is delightful. It is true to the description and images, but the material is a bit firmer than one might expect. Some of the images seem to show this as a sweat-like material. It is more like cargo pant material in how it is starchy feeling. If you have sensitive skin, the textures might cause irritation or chafing, but this is my favorite romper. I cam wear it everywhere; I only wish it were a bit cheaper."
4.0,I don't know what to make of this...
4.0,This was a gift to a coworker. She loves it.
4.0,"Other than the fact that it runs small, It is a great (very light) sweater. It is flattering. If I was 50 lbs lighter it would be great!"
4.0,the color is to brigth
4.0,"Was just a little tighter then a large should be, but the xlarge would’ve been too big."
4.0,This shirt is so awesome. Vegan humor at it's finest. Size is perfect. Good length. BUT...is SO rough. It's wearable but not great.
4.0,I like it but it's too small.
4.0,With wider frames be prepared to wrestle with the fit. Everything else is a go.
4.0,You will need a slip because it is somewhat see thru.
4.0,Comfy. Wish it was a lil thicker but I still like it .
4.0,I bought it because i liked the slouchy arms..I'm usually a medium maybe would've bought a size bigger but its still really cute and fitted as medium !
4.0,"I’m really inbetween normal and plus size; the largest normal size would have been too small and the smallest plus size-which I ordered-are really too big.  But, these are soft and light (not see through) and they are very comfortable.  I find I can fold the large yoga waist down and they don’t ride up and they stay comfy and in place.  (I do have a curvy waist though so they still look good like this)."
4.0,"I have to buy children's masks because I have a small face an head an these worked well. Hard when at 77 years old I have to search for small sized masks that do not have cartoon characters on them. Sure that even some children would appreciate some plainer, pretty patterned masks."
4.0,"Great shoe. More comfortable than Birkenstocks & way better price. Glad I read prior reviews & ordered size up, they do run small."
4.0,My son loves his scorpion necklace. The black necklace part did come apart but we just tied it and later might get a new  chain. The scorpion itself is still in perfect condition! Very happy and all his friends and family think it's so cool.
4.0,"There is less than an inch of difference between the adult size and the kids size. If you're a smaller adult you can get away with the kids size. But, I think the kids sizes should come and funner colors. Now my whole family has black neck warmers and it's hard to tell them apart. I have my son wishes he could have a cool color. Maybe some neon green or stripes or something would be fun. With that said these are warm and wonderful they keep us going through long days on the ski slopes. We love it"
4.0,"I was skeptical about this product as it is so inexpensive.  I was expecting very poor craftsmanship and performance, but what I got were fairly well-made headbands that fit nice and snug and soak up loads of sweat.  The only negative I can say is that, like others have said, they smell like China.  They have a very strong industrial odor to them when first opened and I had to wash mine about five times to remove the smell, but once that is done they are fine.  Considering the cost, I am impressed by the product and recommend it."
4.0,Very nice bag...great size! I'm impressed!
4.0,"The dresses are well worth the money.<br />My wife ordered one size larger, but still way too small. My advice is to definitely order two sizes larger. We gave the xl to a friend who is small to medium. Hoping that it fits."
4.0,"Love these bras, very comfortable, like wearing nothing at all. No binding, no riding up. There is not a lot of support, but gives a smooth look with less jiggle. My one con would be the little triangular pad inserts which the tell you to remove before washing......pain to put back in. I washone with the pads in."
4.0,Love that it isn’t itchy and more comfortable of the masks I’ve worn. And hasn’t faded after a couple of washes.
4.0,The blank key is fine but I had difficulty finding someone to cut it. They wanted to sell me their blank key for $40.00 saying the &#34;internet metal&#34; (whatever that is) is no good and jams the cutting machine!
4.0,Purchased as a present
4.0,it does not fit all my glasses especially the ones with narrower distance between nose. It legs can be adjust just a little to fit another glasses of mine. Which looks really good. It is wide enough to shield sunlight from the sides and not too big that it touches my cheeks.  Storage case is hard to snap lock so if it comes with better case it would be perfect.
4.0,This a nice strap for the money.  I used it on one of my small coach bags to convert it to a crossbody bag.  It matched perfectly.
4.0,Super warm should have purchase a large instead of X large but I love them
4.0,"A bought this player so that I could connect it to my Ardoino project .<br />It turned out that this device has 4 button, but no interface for controlling it via a microprocessor<br /><br />The device works great, but it fails to fulfill my needs.<br />Buy it if you simple need a Mp3 player at a low price."
4.0,"I only wear Puma shoes and have probably 12+ pairs. I always wear a size 10 but the shoe are sized a full size up. I put them on and I have a full inch of extra length. The shoes themselves are very comfortable as I would expect, but I am disappointed that the sizing is so far off.<br /><br />Pro- the shoes comfortable and look ok.<br /><br />Cons- size's run one size large, some cheap looking build quality on the soles"
4.0,"I am 5' 9&#34;, 140lb. It's pretty short on me. Not as long as I was expecting but if you want a shirt it works great! Nice lacy, see through faberic."
4.0,The graphic starts to fade after the first wash. Very cute daddy/son outfit though.
4.0,"Not too thin, Not too thick.<br />Size runs little bit small so I had to return the 1st one and get size Large instead ( I am usually s-m).<br />Color is cute.<br />I like how the length is long enough to cover my hip and how the body fit is not too loose."
4.0,So comfy! Great deal especially for the price.
4.0,I thought material of the shirt would feel different. It looks good just not what I expected.
4.0,"This dress is stylish and fits very well.  I'm 5'6"" and 140lbs, and the M was the perfect choice.  The only reason for 4 stars is the material feels slightly synthetic, but for the price it is to be expected."
4.0,"Too large, had to return."
4.0,"This necklace totally reminds me of the movie Titanic. The gem is very large and sparkly, which is perfect for my granddaughter, who loves sparkles. The chain doesn't match the quality of the charm. Overall, though, very nice for costume jewelry."
4.0,It is a great dress but it runs somewhat large and it would be better if the fabric is a little thicker. Overall a good buy though. Great under a jacket for fall or as it is during summer.
4.0,"I bought these because it touted "" arch support"" Not great arch support 😔"
4.0,It was a tad bit large however I think a smaller size would have been too small. The pockets are a great plus!
4.0,I bought this for a purse to travel on the plane. Its the perfect size and great because bit can be wiped down<br /> Cute design too. Now I use it for a bag for school books.
4.0,"Super soft sweater, that's for sure! It did run rather wide than long. Which is not a bad thing really being I have a shorter torso. If you are tall and slender it will probably fall above your waistline. I ordered an XL and did seem like it could be a Lg. I was hoping for an oversized look, did not fit that way but I will definitely be keeping it since it does fit and is super cute :) Thinking about ordering a blue one!"
4.0,"These are cute. I ordered a medium, I am 5'1"", 138 lbs... they look ugly on me, very small and uncomfortable. I giving it 4 starts because I gave the pants to my daughter who is 5'2"" and weights 115 lbs and they look very cute on her, just like the picture"
4.0,The ear ring is nicely design. The size was just right for the size of my ear lope.
4.0,"I read the reviews ahead of buying and saw most said it ran small. I ordered a size larger than I would have otherwise and I was glad I did. The women in the pic wearing the dress I can tell you is under 5'5"" or has short legs because the slit in the front is higher cut on me than in the pic. I might have to improvise depending on where I wear it. The green color and material of the dress is nice, especially for the price."
4.0,I am a size 12 & this top fit perfect.
4.0,I'm usually a size 0 depending on clothing brands and a size 4 in swim brands. The top fits as expected. But the bottom is hella small! The leg holes cut into my thighs. I'm getting it altered to fit more comfortably. This would cause major chafing on the inner thighs if you were to swim for a long time.
4.0,The buckle on the front to hold it closed could be better made
4.0,"Slightly flimsy......a stiffer cover would have been nicer. Otherwise, love the pattern."
4.0,"These cases are really cu/e, but if you have a larger frame eyeglasses like I do then they will not fit in this case. So I gave them away"
4.0,Fit good but all colors are individually sewn together so there are a lot of seams
4.0,Cute for my husband
4.0,"Super cute, but I thought they were black and cream... they are more like a deep navy. Love them anyway."
4.0,"I really like how the front of this bra comes up nice and high. I can wear it underneath low-cut shirts so I don't show too much. I work with kids, so it's nice to have that extra coverage when I'm bending over or holding a child that may pull on my clothes.<br />It also breathes well and seems well-made.<br />It does run very small. I usually wear a 32A, and a medium fits me snug. It actually fit a little too snug around the arm holes the first few times I wore it. Besides that, it is very comfortable."
4.0,work well inside and out.
4.0,"I got this for my son for halloween. He really likes how it looks. The glasses that make the glowing eyes work great. The black fabric for the costume is very thin, but my son can put on warmer cloths underneath to keep warm while trick or treating. He says he can see through the face covering and glasses, but not the best. It's pretty tough to see when it's dark out. The staff looks really neat, but the plastic is super thin and flimsy. It will work for halloween, but I have had my son put it away so it doesn't break before then."
4.0,Perfect for out 80’s band night
4.0,Docking off a star because there are some loose strings hanging from the caged part and it makes it look a little cheap. Other than that I still wear it under my tops to give my outfit a little edge. It fits nicely and it's quite comfy for what it is. I've had it for about a month now and hasn't worn out at all. I'm overall happy with the item for the price.
4.0,"Nice base layer underneath a heavier layer. Versatile. You can wear over the head, over the face or just around the neck."
4.0,little hard pulling apart
4.0,"A little cheaply made, but can't beat the price. They wanted way more in stores. My 6 year old LOVED IT"
4.0,"Like the shirt, but I purchased a small and it fits very loose on me"
4.0,"Great color, matches the picture shown.  Looks elegant with my blue Bag"
4.0,"This top is for ladies that are very thin. Not for your average sized ladies. The garment runs very small, even in XL. Although the top runs small, it is very beautiful and dainty. I love the style and pattern."
4.0,"Casual wear, pretty sexy"
4.0,"These are not neoprene..water does get in. The velcro at the top is mainly,  I feel,  to keep the sock up (not to seal out sand etc.) as it has a small open spot in the back under the velcro.  Nice and lightweight,  breathable."
4.0,These are great pants. The material is of good quality However they are really tight in the thigh/groin area. This made it very difficult for me to advance positions in paintball matches.
4.0,Great product. Fits well and very comfy.
4.0,"These were purchased for an upcoming overseas trip with long distance flights.  The socks are well made, feel great but are snug on my (giant) calves.  I purchased the largest size and I'm not sure I can wear these for long periods of time.  It's definitely me, if you have human sized calves, you should be fine."
4.0,Nice quality at a good price.
4.0,"They are bigger than I hoped for, but I receive loads of complement when I wear them."
4.0,the sport bra should provide better support and needs to be constructed out of stronger fabric.
4.0,Great buckle.  The gift was for a young man and he really liked it.
4.0,"Received tons of compliments on this coat.  I really like it.  It washes great, which I love.  The only issue I have is the back bottom has curled up a bit and I cannot get it to lay flat :(.  Fit is snug in the shoulders, wish I'd gone a size up, but I like things roomy."
4.0,"Dress is very vibrant. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to how thin the material is. I am a size 10, 5’8 and the large was big."
4.0,Good quality. Sleeves are long enough for once. Wish it wrinkled less.
4.0,"Very cute, but after a few washings, the item doesn’t look so great."
4.0,I like this long sleeve its soft and make me warm. Nice product for a cheap price.
4.0,super cute but the top part was really snug
4.0,"Sort of looked like costume jewelry, the charm was larger than expected. But over cute"
4.0,"Somewhat small but not uncomfortable. These are compression shorts, after all. Material is very smooth which aleviates the usual problem of chaffing."
4.0,The shirt was cute but not crazy about the jeans
4.0,I am looking for a mask that is a bit bigger than some I have seen.  I ordered these to try.  They are nice masks! Bigger than most with a pocket to place an extra filter in.
4.0,The boots are heavy as hell my dad wears them get a size down from what you get in shoes like example: 12R in Mickes will fit 13M/13W shoe size. That's a good fit. Best bet is to get these In a Narrow and get your regular shoes size. I wear a size 12M/12W shoe and size 11R Mickie's fit me perfect. Only reason to get these in a wide if you want two pair of wool socks on. Get these boots in a Narrow if you want to wear regular two pair of socks. 12N Mickie's will fit your size 12M shoe size. Really up to your personally comfort.
4.0,This is a nice dress. I wore it with a belt to make it more form fitting. I am 5 feet and the dress was a nice length on me- may be too short for anyone taller. The deep-v is very low- I added an extra stitch to make it less revealing. I got tons of compliments on this dress!
4.0,"The pajamas had a soft fleece-like feel to them, which my son loved (&specifically requested). But they also feel very thin, like they most likely won't hold up with constant wash & wear, until next winter. But only time will tell & they're serving their purpose for now."
4.0,Cute dress but not for a full figure girl. Makes you look like a wide load.
4.0,LOVE this top.  I normally wear a large and bought a large- I wonder if I’ll order another one in a medium due to slightly fitting bigger.  It’s very flatting.  I’m 5’9 and as for the length- it will work with leggings- but barely.
4.0,Very cute dress! Lots of compliments on it.
4.0,"The dress in and of itself is very beautiful. It was a perfect fit. I would have given it five stars, however, it did come with a small hole along the seam. Even though no one noticed it, quality control should have caught that."
4.0,"I wouldn't normally go out my way to write a review, but I was very impressed with this product. It arrived in the same type of box a book would arrive in, so I was very confused, but as soon as I opened it, I was impressed. The product is collapsible to have fit in the box, but it is very sturdy when set up. I didn't expect the material quality to be as good or the product to be as spacious. The inside pockets were also helpful. Would definitely recommend."
4.0,"I bought the purple color. I like it overall, lightweight yet warm. And at nearly 5’10” ish, I  wanted something that covered my bottom, and this fit the bill! Be aware that it has less colorblocking on one side than the other and is less vibrant in color compared to the stock photo. I am keeping it as a sweater to toss on when my basement office gets too cold. (Or to cover my pjs for zoom video calls- shhh!)"
4.0,I love the print of this shirt. The fit is also nice and flattering. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the fabric. It’s a bit stiff- not the soft distressed cotton look in the picture. I imagine it could soften some after it is washed and dried. I got it last minute for the 4th so I haven’t washed it yet. Overall I am pleased with it- wore it all day and not complaints on look or comfort.
4.0,"Awesome choker necklace, especially for a girl who loves cameos, and also choker necklaces. It's my new favorite necklace."
4.0,Pretty big but I didn't expect a perfect fit. A bit itchy but is all in one piece. I would recommend for Cthulu enthusiasts and futurama fans
4.0,The face was a little smaller than I had hoped.
4.0,"They're super cute and stylish, exactly what I expected, but unfortunately mine were a bit scuffed on the white rubber edge. Both shoes have some black marks on them. But I will just cover them up with white paint. I like how they look too much to complain any more than that."
4.0,This is a really cute casual sundress its just a tab bit long
4.0,Very comfortable. A little long but I’m kinda short
4.0,The size is true..fit me perfectly.  It is very comfortable n soft
4.0,"Very cute, came earlier than expected and look exactly like the picture. 4 stars because they're very thin."
4.0,Women's Plus Size Tankini Swimdress is cute for the summer
4.0,I love it. It's just a little small. But I still love it.
4.0,They’re thick. They seem like they were well made. However this size 4 is more for a size 5/6.
4.0,Love the color. Blazer looks just it's pictured; just wish it a lining. I am a 36 DD (41 in.) and ordered a large.
4.0,"I REALLY like these frames.  They have a high quality well-balanced feel. Even the optician commented on how nice they are. I would have given them five stars BUT. . . They were apparently VERY difficult to make progressive lenses for.  I brought these to Wal-Mart Vision Center to get progressive lenses made. The first time they did them, both lenses fell out the first time I handled them.  When I brought them back Wal-Mart apologized and told me they were really difficult.  I guess they had tried to do them in-house.  Anyway, they then sent them to the Zeiss lab they work with.  When they came back this time the lenses were great for distance vision, but for working on my computer, in order to focus I had to tilt my head way back, in a manner that made my neck ache and seriously fatigued my eyes.  I went to my eye doctor who evaluated the lenses and said the measurements were 'perfect'. They thought maybe the glasses sat farther away from my face than most glasses or something.  But for the most part they told me they couldn't do anything.  I took them back to Wal-Mart.  While they also said the measurements were 'perfect' they agreed to try to re-do them to address my issue for working on the computer.  Thank goodness!  To test the proposed adjustment they temporarily put two thicknesses of little sticky pads on the nose pads, which raised the glasses up a bit -- this enabled me to see my computer clearly without tilting my head too much. So when they re-did the lenses the second time they essentially moved the the Rx up in the lens a couple of millimeters.  That did it. Now I can wear them for near and far vision. SO, it may or may not have something to do with the frames, but I thought it might be useful to share my experience in case someone else encounters something similar.  I really do love the frames now that I can see out of them."
4.0,I like the watch. It is very lightweight. The inside leather is a little scratchy. Only reason for 4 stars.
4.0,"The edges should be rounded and stitched, the corners tend to fold over and cause difficulty in getting the product snapped. Once on it's fantastic!!"
4.0,These are very cute & intersting. THe only problem is I sometimes have a hard time getting them to clasp property
4.0,"Helpful to use on my goggles that are not required working in healthcare. Provides good anti-fogging benefit. Does leave a film on the lenses, but nothing unmanageable."
4.0,"Cute suit but the sizing runs small. I'm usually a medium at stores like target, and stuck with that here to find it was somewhat lacking in coverage on bottom."
4.0,"This is a cute print, exactly as expected quality wise - a stretchy and somewhat thin dress. Not the highest quality ever but what I expected from the order. I would size down if you’re between sizes, the top is cut very wide."
4.0,"Color was a little lighter gray than we anticipated, but overall the laces matched.  Overall quality was better than the laces that came with the original purchase."
4.0,Very good quality for the price. Was used by my child for a western dance. The string was perfect so she could hang it on the back of her neck. Also stayed on her head great because it had an inside friction strip.
4.0,"Wife really liked them and wore them all day, Shipping was very fast. Run a bit long for short people."
4.0,"So good for the price, but of course it looks cheap."
4.0,Love the fit! Wish it had underwire for more support but I still love it!
4.0,heavier than I thought. I can't wear them for more than about 8 hours because the weight is too much for my ears
4.0,Got it for a friend she likes it . And her fav place . She nice and curvy so it goes awesome lol
4.0,"I am 5'4"" and weigh about 105 lbs and bought a size small. I am not busty in the front so it was quite large for me in that area. The swimsuit is VERY cute and sexy. I wish they offered an x-small because that would've been great. The material was soft and expandable, definitely decent/high quality. The package arrived very quick and the return was easy!"
4.0,Liviana bonito color buena calidad
4.0,Great fit love the shirt
4.0,"i got this as an anniversary gift from my hubby, i love the thought of having a rose that i can keep forever. you can tell that it was an actual purple rose :) they laquered it first, then painted on the gold parts. it also came in a pretty display box"
4.0,"Layout of the bag is excellent, as is the weight. I had another bag for twenty years and it just wore out, so I looked at the Skorch, since the weight and design were similar to my previous bag. The bottom of the bag is padded, so the computer doesn't hit down hard, but otherwise the bag is lightly designed, which is good for me.<br /><br />The flap is the only problem. This flap is short, with the flap clips coming up. I wish the flap were longer with the closure clip straps shorter, so that there would be better protection. Here the design does not take into account the better option, but is about appearance rather than function. A better function would be with a longer flap, coming down the side of the bag and clipping closer to the bottom rather than only 1/3 of the way down.<br /><br />Certainly, some would say this is preference, and I get that. But there are other functional reasons—rain, protection of contents, ease of clipping/unclipping the clasps."
4.0,I Love The material used and the texture is easy wear and great protection s easy to  adjust any size
4.0,I ordered a large and that is what came. I’m a size 36 in jeans. These fit just are a little loose. However these seem a little loose for being bike shorts. The padding is good and the America design/ flag is understated so it’s not obnoxious and actually kinda cool. I have worn bike shorts that have better padding but only time will tell with these if they are comfy etc. They don’t leave much to the imagination but we’re all human if you know what I mean. I think these would be fine under shorts or for short route around town.
4.0,"Nice, but the pockets are extremely small. For reference, a regular iPhone 8 does not fit completely inside the pocket."
4.0,I really like these mittens. They are warm and convenient. I can perform tasks without taking them off. The lining of the thumb on the right hand ripped on the first day but they are still wearable.
4.0,Sturdy construction. Hoping it will survive the test of time.
4.0,Very cute but runs a little large. Amazon suggested a medium but I usually wear a large so that’s what I got & it’s a little loose otherwise super pretty !!
4.0,"I typically wear a women's 12-14 (US) and have a 36DD cup size. I ordered an XL and it fits perfectly!  There are pockets which is great and the bodice is double-lined. The fabric itself could be higher quality, but I think it's on par for the price - I would equate this to something you'd find at ASOS or Zara. Looks just like a Reformation dress, so for the price you really can't go wrong. Will be ordering in more colors ASAP!"
4.0,"So I bought XL according to the sizing (I can wear 1X or 2X) and although the bust fit well (C cup) it was tight around the stomach and since I prefer to wear my clothes a little loose I returned it and got a XXL and it's huge! Feels like a XXXL. So I wear it, it feels really comfortable, just really big."
4.0,Very comfy. Only drawback is the back is cut shorter than the front at the rise so they ride a little too low on my bottom for me. As long as you have on a long shirt that covers the back of the jean when you bend or squat you'd be fine. They are very soft and comfortable and look like jeans. I bought a second pair almost immediately.
4.0,"The picture is what was advertised, but the strap is beaded, which I did not want for the 2yo.  I expect to be sent a new bag with a regular strap OR just send a replacement strap.  Thank you!"
4.0,Bought this for pregnancy fatigue and restless legs. Overall it has been great for lower leg fatigue and ok for resless legs. Havent had a lot of swelling so i assume its doing it’s job. No issues with it slipping. Biggest complaint is that it gets itchy to wear at times.
4.0,goood Quality
4.0,"Love, only Part thats weird is the zippers on side can be difficult at,times otherwise . This purse is worth every penny"
4.0,This is a fun gift for any horse person. The design is fun and pretty. The necklace is sturdy but tarnished a bit when worn everyday.
4.0,se descose
4.0,The print is great and looks just like the picture. The only disappointing thing about this bag is the section that zips open to hold your yoga mat is super tight fit. It’s really hard to get the mat in it and my mat is regular thickness not an extra thick mat.
4.0,Nice GV jeans. Was a tad bigger but still a good fit. The color wasn’t as expected as pair received was more of a light blue not lilac as I thought. Overall a good purchase!
4.0,I have worn this for the french embassy masquerade in DC. I loved the look and the details! Even prettier than on the pictures. Only criticism is the band that is supposed to keep it on your face became weak during the first night and I was afraid of losing it.
4.0,"She liked it, all that matters!"
4.0,"BEAUTIFUL WATCH!! Only reason for 4 stars is the band. The band is poorly made, but for the price you paid for this watch it is worth it to buy another one to replace it with."
4.0,I like this dress!<br />I agree with the reviews that say size down.
4.0,"Beautiful blue dress. It looks really good  It’s hard to find a dress that fits perfect when you’re curvy, we don’t exactly fit into the size charts exactly, but I got an XXL fits really nice but a little snug in the tummy.  I’m 5’6”, 220 and rather large in the chest area, the dress hits between the knee and mid calf.  The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because it says it has a slit, which it doesn’t (I didn’t care too much about that), but it said it has a zipper, it does not."
4.0,"Looks great, feels great especially for the price."
4.0,"I think like everyone says, the legs are a little snug, but other than that, it fits good.  It seems to be well made and comfortable."
4.0,"The fabric feels cheap. Maxi dress is not as flowy(lack of a better word)...somewhat stiffer,  than the other brands that I've purchased (Dearcase, LilBetter) Still I received many compliments because of the vibrant colors and design.  But the fabric lacks body. Still...I will wear it again it is after all beautiful and it compliments me and my skin tone."
4.0,The cut is beautiful. The color not as vivid/deep as the picture.
4.0,Boots were cute but too small.
4.0,Dense fabric-stays wrinkle free for travel. Can dress up or down.
4.0,Very satisfied with the straw hat.  Would've<br />liked an easier way to tie it.
4.0,"I’ve been on the hunt for the perfect white mini dress, and this checks all my boxes… except it doesn’t come in an xs. A lot of other Verdusa dresses do, so I’m hoping this one does at some point. I’m 5’1 and weigh 100 pounds for reference. This material is very stretchy and I think a size small could go a long way, but in order to feel a little more confident about my figure, I’d like a snugger fit."
4.0,Great Watch for the Price !
4.0,I removed the funny sleeves and then it's one of the most comfortable shirts I have.👍😊
4.0,"We purchased these glasses so our baby could be Velma for Halloween! The quality was pretty good, and she looked super cute!"
4.0,"I am a big guy so I order these kinds of shirts so they fit loose and are comfortable. This one is pretty tight, when ordering I would consider going up one size or it is going to fit snug."
4.0,"Nice color and fits as expected. Material is a little clingy and wrinkles easily, but its not horrible."
4.0,"Pros:<br />Professional looking, functional watch.<br />I have thin wrists, but the strap is still able to fit me well when I put it on the tightest notch.<br />Inexpensive<br /><br />Cons:<br />The stopwatch dials and buttons don't actually work. They are just for show, which kind of cheapens the watch for me. I think the design of the watch would have looked nice without it and would have preferred that they didn't include it. I hope I don't encounter a situation where someone asks me about them, and then I have to awkwardly explain that they aren't real. Took a star off for this, but if you're just paying for a watch that tells the date and time, then this watch is still a good deal.<br />The clockface is on the larger end. Not excessively big, but does look a little large on my small wrists. For most people, the size should look fine though."
4.0,I noticed reviews said they were normally too small so I ordered 1 size larger and glad I did because<br />one size larger did fit Ok .  It's not just these slippers but practically everything made in China is made smaller .<br />Sure do miss American made stuff !
4.0,"My hubby purchased this as my wedding band.  It came in the mail very dull with very little sparkle.  After taking it to the jeweler for a cleaning, the shine is amazing!  I have a 1 carat princess cut for the center and it fits surprisingly well!  I get lots of compliments and overall am very pleased.  I did not give 5 stars because the ring is not as lovely as its picture.  But it is still a pretty ring, good quality, and decent price.  I am content with my purchase."
4.0,Love the colors and holds during runs.
4.0,"I like the top. I go size M .Lovely color and a very soft material. However, the style of the tank is a bit wierd. The arm hole is really bigger than expected. It is not very noticeable but just that it is not my style. However, I love the material and color so I am keeping it."
4.0,"I am a M size and I brought a L size. Fit me fine overall just a little bit lose on the sleeve, nice quality"
4.0,"Had to return and reorder because of sizing.  I usually wear a large, but had to go up 2 sizes.  Not for warmth.  Otherwise, I like it and think it's well made."
4.0,"Work fine.  Still fog up after a while, just like the really expensive ones."
4.0,It look perfect on me
4.0,"The quality is good. The material is thick and if it fit right I feel like it would give some tummy control if that’s something you look for. But unfortunately it just doesn’t fit me. I got the smallest size but I still have some gapping at the waist. For the top it’s just a little Ill fitting/unflattering on me. There’s this weird gapping/pulling around my boobs and but it’s too big around my armpit area. The butt thing is flattering and the butt part is flattering. Would be more so if it fit my waist but that’s a personal issue. I have a pretty small waist ≈22” so the waist issue is a common problem for me so while not surprising, disappointing. I am also about 5’2” and ≈95lbs-100lbs and typically wear ≈32D/30DD at the moment for size reference. The butt thing does feel a little weird at first but you get used to it. If you’re my size or smaller, wouldn’t recommend but anybody bigger should be able to find a size that fits I think in which case I would recommend"
4.0,Great product. A little pricey.
4.0,"Fast shipping, I just did not realize the visor part was so wide,.guess that's why they call it big bill...lol.everything else was great."
4.0,"Sweatshirt was great and fit great, but as you can see in the pic the security tag was left on 🙃 I get it stuff happens I’m sure they’re  tired, we all are ... Going to try to find a way to remove it.. otherwise it’s as you would expect and as advertised.."
4.0,"Runs very small. Size up by two for the cami, underwear, and shorts to fit. I sized up by one and wish I had listened to another reviewer. It's been through the wash in a delicates bag and hung on a drying rack to dry twice since purchase with no sign of stitching coming apart or discoloration. The shorts aren't exactly made for the shape of a real human person, but it's not so bad you can't just power through and feel cute anyway. Fabric kind of gathers between your legs and creats pleats that draw the eye right to that spot. For the price, 3/4 stars is fair."
4.0,very chic with nice black tights.  The white collar does get some makeup on it but I just used a wet wipe and it came off...
4.0,Love! 3rd try on this type of jumpsuit and I finally got it right. Got a medium even though I usually wear large in everything else. Able to dress up or Dow. Depending on accessories. Just ordered another one.
4.0,VERY BAGGY FIT. WILL RETURN.
4.0,"A bit large for my uncle, other than that is a nice suit"
4.0,These are very good socks.
4.0,It is super comfy WITH POCKETS! Cheap material and does rip easily.
4.0,Make sure to size up - shrinks a size after wash even with cold and low heat
4.0,"Wore this to an outing on a 92-degree HOT day and it was very cool and comfortable.  I was a little disappointed with the length--as you can see in the pic, it barely falls below my knees.  An inch or two longer would have been more to my liking, but it was very affordable and cute, so I can't complain too much.  I am 5'7 and about 150 and I got a Medium which fits very well.  All in all I am very pleased with this dress."
4.0,They are great but they look a lot like plastic
4.0,"Nice shoes but as feet swelled shoes to tight, need Wide offerings."
4.0,"got my necklace today nice and shiny,but way too short to wear around my neck,wont return it looks good on my 5years old daughter"
4.0,"These are adorable shoes, true to size, comfy for my boy.  The velcro makes for easy on and off.  I took one star off because if they aren't on snug, they can fall off easily."
4.0,"I think these are great.  Exactly what I was hoping for, comfy and not too warm.  I wish I could wear them to work."
4.0,These were not thick as I expected wish they were! The fit was good for 5”3 petite women wish they would be thicker material to support more on butt and waist.
4.0,Beautiful and just the right size
4.0,Decent for the price. Pretty sturdy.
4.0,Nice pants- comfortable!
4.0,Fits well and good quality for price
4.0,Good purchase and good seller reached timely
4.0,"It fits a medium crop pot and two bags of regular sized chips, the photo is a sort of reference. I would not let the crock pot be hot while placing it in the bag. The material is a canvas but it isn’t super thick overall. The straps are sturdy, overall I wish it was wider, I really need to “haul it all” and this only does half the job, I will be purchasing a second bag."
4.0,"Overall these have been good summer shoes for my kids. I bought two pair. They definitely ran a little big, but because of the Velcro I could tighten enough that they stay on for the most part.<br />Pros: lightweight, good airy shoes for summer, ok for water play, easy on and off<br /><br />Cons: a little big, the Velcro on one strap started pulling off after a month of wear.<br /><br />You can definitely tell they aren’t the highest quality, but they work for what I needed them for."
4.0,"I just got two pairs of these leggings yesterday and overall I like them. I got the ankle length, side pocket style and really like the look of them. I ordered the space dye red and space dye charcoal and definitely notice a difference between the two in the feel of the fabric. The space dye red is stiffer with less stretch, while the space dye charcoal is soft and forgiving. Honestly I would reorder just to get the charcoal again because they are SO comfortable. I am 5’6, 150ish pounds and 7 weeks postpartum with baby #3 and the medium is a good fit. The red pair feel a bit long, but I suspect that has to do with the fabric quality. Haven’t washed them or tested them in a yoga class yet- will update if anything changes."
4.0,The only drawback of these bibs is that they're a bit difficult to store and then separate for use.  I found the solution to be hanging them from a double over-door hook.  Now I can just gently pull one off the hanging pack.  They also make excellent seat protectors.
4.0,"These sunglasses arrived on time and were cuter in person than in the picture! I ordered them for my 2 year old daughter and she just loves them! We live in hot Texas and she is ready for her own since she likes to wear mine on really sunny days.  Well they seem really durable and well made for the price.  I do have to knock down a star, giving just four out of five, because they are a bit too loose on her head and they barely stay on.  This obviously bugs her because she keeps taking them off.  The age recommendation is 2-10 years and she has a large head for her age of two years and two months.  So if you are looking for a child's pair of glasses they will need to be a bit older, I would say at least three years old maybe more.  Otherwise I think they are a great choice and the kids will have fun wearing them.<br /><br />  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my 100% honest review, the discount did not affect or alter my review in any way."
4.0,"It is very flattering, however the colors advertised do not match what you receive in your order."
4.0,"The Earrings were nice for the price. There was a problem with one of the butterfly backs, however.<br />It did not slide on as easily onto the earring stud as the other one did. It's not that big a problem, considering the cost.<br /><br />Luvtravel"
4.0,I ordered a large and I am 5'6&#34; 150pds and full B cup! Lots of side boob but I love it! Definitely need to wear the pasties
4.0,It is a perfect size and has dividers to kkep your items organized.  There isn't anything I don't like about it!
4.0,These cotton high waist underpants are well made and designed. The waist control band goes all around not just at the front so they don't bind or roll. The cotton makes them comfortable and breathable.<br /><br />The one con is they do shrink in the wash about ½ size down so you may or may not want to order a size up. I'm assuming they will stretch after several wears. I washed on cold in a cool dryer.
4.0,I'm top heavy and it was a little small in that area.  I was still able to zip it . It's a beautiful dress and im looking forward to wearing it. I guess I'll be the unique one at the bar!
4.0,"Material was sort of unexpected, almost like costume material. The fit is flattering though and it's a cute dress."
4.0,"The product is fine, but I ordered a 3X and its at best an XL. I've tried to return it and while Amazon has their awesome service I've been ghosted by the vendor. ugh. It appears well made it is just too small for me."
4.0,"Great, love these, put them on my key rings, and giving out the rest as gifts."
4.0,"In the picture, the top part of the ring that has the jewels looks more wavy in the picture. In real life, it’s way more straight"
4.0,"I did get 6 earrings, which should be 3 pairs. Instead I got 3 of one Iowa style, 1 each of 2 other Iowa styles, and one random team (in assuming Baylor?). As these were to be part of a Christmas gift for my sister, this is one epic failure.<br />Update #1 - They have messaged me in response to my sent complaint and there's already a new set in the mail!"
4.0,"Great hat but only 4 stars because it did not come with a chin strap which was one of the main reasons why I bought this hat. However, I was able to roll it into my luggage and not able to get some weird creases."
4.0,"Love this bag, need something for work to put my purse, lunch, paperwork, tablet in and still have room. Very stylish and affordable. Was delivered within a short time."
4.0,I really like this romper! It looks really cute. I'm always afraid of how things will fit me but its good. Im almost 5'8&#34; and i have a bigger back side and thighs but a small waist..size 12 in pants. But this fits well. Only thing is the elastic waistband has gotten somewhat &#34;tangled&#34; inside but not too big of a deal.
4.0,Love the PINK! A bit on the shorter side but was able to make them work!
4.0,"As a good sandals.I like the heel height. It doesn't really massage for me. In fact it's a bit irritating, butI don't mind. feels comfortable otherwise even after being on my feet for several hours."
4.0,"They fit really well, just the waist band is odd. Otherwise tho I wear them all the time! Great Buy!!"
4.0,"Larger than expected, but quite nice."
4.0,"Liked the dress. Ordered the sparkly red and it was very sparkly. Nice fit, very stretchy. Wished it was more structured and supporting in the waist area. The split is high, so the concern for me was keeping it in place due to the smoothness of the material. Any movement could possibly shift the split to the crotch. It showed just enough up top. The dress in this black/red combo was more sheer than I expected, so anyone with wider hips and a round butt should be mindful of their undergarments. I suggest black undergarments for this color combo because nude will be visible with bending, etc. Wound up returning it because it didn’t work for my event and clashed with my husband’s suit. Bought it for $40; should’ve been $25-$30. Still, it was a very pretty dress and I might reorder in a solid color if the material is less stretchy and sheer."
4.0,"Purchased three of these for my daughters. They fit well and are durable.  They've used these bracelets with the Pandora type slide charms and it has worked perfectly.  Great cost, well made.  Would recommend."
4.0,I love this it was perfect for my mom and my sister
4.0,Great value for price. Comfortable.
4.0,"I purchased this bag to accommodate for life in field work/returning to school. It is large enough to carry a thin portfolio, a small notebook and a small planner. I hope that the bag loosens up with wear as it is quite rigid. I LOVE the color and have gotten numerous compliments. At this time, I don't see how ALL of the items (iPad, magazine, wallet, book, etc.)  shown on the picture can fit but I am very hopeful. I definitely would recommend this bag to others!"
4.0,"They lasted about 4 years before the heel wore a hole. Not bad. I wear them seasonally, not year ‘round. For non-standard/printed socks that’s pretty good. Fairly comfortable."
4.0,"For one you do need to look at the size chart, DO NOT GO OFF OF YOUR NOMAL SIZE, I got a size larger then I usually get and it fits perfectly, it's not see through, it does not have inside ties so it doesn't stay closed very well"
4.0,"This was pretty much exactly as described, if not a little big. I would size down if you want the dress to be in any way form-fitting (but not too tight). I'm 5'3&#34;, 140 lbs, 38DD and the Large fit me a bit loose. The pattern is adorable, but don't expect the best quality fabric in the world for the price. This was a good festive dress to wear to work with a little cardigan over it. I would buy others in different patterns."
4.0,"very nice, just doesnt lay correctly on my ears"
4.0,"Love:  The style and reflectiveness of both!!  Cute backpack moose reflector comes with all this too.  Great price.<br />Hate:  I ordered the large dog vest, the vest velcro that goes around the chest is too small.  My dog is 85lbs.  I will keep the product and sew my own added piece of velcro to it."
4.0,"Like others have noted, the chain will need to be replaced since it's cheap and clunky. The charm itself has stayed in great condition, and I wore it in pools and showers. Other than the chain, it's great"
4.0,Awesome shirt. Feels good to wear at the gym.
4.0,"It was so big on me. The reviews were saying up your size and i did, i put a large and it was a dress on me. I had to cut it"
4.0,Nice but pearls were smaller than I expected
4.0,I love it. I can wear it with heals and hair bun for work or high boot and hair down for fun.
4.0,I have a larger bust so they personally didn't offer as much support as I would have liked but I will say that they stayed in place all night without any issue. Even through dancing/sweating etc. Would definitely recommend this for women with small to medium bust.
4.0,Warm anc cozy.  Come in good color combos too.  These replaced a couple of pairs that I have worn out.  Ordered some extras for stocking stuffers.
4.0,"I like this ring okay, but am not too keen in the top insertion - my piercing must be a little long because I'm yet to get the post all the way through (piercing is relatively new, so it could still be a bit swollen).  I don't think I'd have this problem if it was inserted from the bottom."
4.0,"Very nice color, good for the summer. Beans are smaller than it looks in the pic."
4.0,As hoped for. Was concerned the chains might be smaller than pic’d. But they’re nice and big. .
4.0,Love it! So comfy. My only complaint is that it doesnt have pockets.
4.0,"All of the charms, but the chain was broken"
4.0,Not a UGG person..never had the desire for one until I laid eyes on these...can't wait to put my outfit together..cute for dayz!
4.0,The pattern is eye catching and the material is decent.  I agree with other purchasers' comments.  The tassels are awful!  I will cut them off.
4.0,"This shirt runs on the shorter side, but is so soft and is almost wrinkle free. Great for traveling. I recently wore it to Texas with the bow tie and looked western and cute at the same time."
4.0,My review is as follows; see pictures.<br />Pros:<br />Leather quality: supple and not stiff<br />Stitching: High precision<br />Zipper quality: YKK (High quality)<br />Zipper cloth/leather color: Exact match<br />Organization: good - could be better<br />Holds passport: Yes<br />Credit Card quantity: 6-8<br />Price point: good compared to the carry out/all at 179.99<br /><br />Cons: tailored to the size of an iPhone 7+ so there is a fair amount of space in the pouch.. One plus 5 fits well with one plus carbon case on it. Would prefer that the wallet was more rectangular instead of the &#34;squarish&#34; shape it currently is..
4.0,"We now have a couple of pieces from this brand, and although I like the clothes, I can't help but be put off by the name.  I don't know why they chose ""Ripe and Raw"" as the brand name for a line of children's clothes, but the clothes are pretty cute!  This dress is a classic pattern and really adorable.  The fabric is soft and flowy, almost like chambray.  Again, I just wish the brand name were different."
4.0,"Bought this for my daughter to be a flower girl for wedding. I'm glad I read the reviews so I was prepared for what I would receive. As noted in other comments--the dress is not floor length but stops a couple inches above the ankles of my 6yr old daughter. I was fine with that so that was not an issue for me. Second, the waistband droops quite a bit as you can see in the picture ,but I was expecting that from previous reviews... so I just pinned it for the wedding ceremony. Too bad the company doesn't address the waistband drooping issue , it seems like an easy fix. Overall that the quality of the dress material is nice and looks very pretty.... My daughter likes it a lot. We plan to keep it and use it Halloween by adding some costume wings so she can be a fairy."
4.0,"Shirt runs small. Order a size bigger. Nice quality shirt, very soft cotton. Gift for my brother, and he loved it."
4.0,"I did not receive the colors that I ordered which was the plum and pinks and instead I got greens and blues. But aside from the color faux pas, the bodice of the tank was form fitting which I was hoping for a bit loose and the bust area near the straps is weird. The straps are loose and floppy but the bust is snug. It's really difficult to explain. Will I keep them? yes I might as well. Would I buy again? Nope."
4.0,"The material is nice and thin, with just the right amount of stretch. Cannot tell the material (100% cotton?) and the product description on the Amazon page is most strange."
4.0,"Decent glasses, I'd say it's about 80% tint, springy arms which was nice, and the frame is metal/metal like which is sturdy but warch out as it really absorbs the heat in summer."
4.0,Too small and I ordered the size I always wear.
4.0,"I really liked the purse, but could have done without the short zipper pocket in front and the side pockets which don't really hold a bottle of water, not even an 8 oz; the side pocket is just too narrow for that use.  The Khaki & Coffee colors are darker than I expected, but the purse itself is well made.  Overall, a good buy."
4.0,"exactly as described, fast shipping.  Thanks."
4.0,This t shirt dress is really cute. May more appropriate for a 20 something year old because its pretty short. The material is ok and not see through. The fit was slightly smaller than i normally would fit.
4.0,Little big around the chest area otherwise comfy
4.0,"The fabric is thin, but I live in a hot climate so I like it.  Seems well made.  Zippers work.  I am buying a second in a different color."
4.0,I Love This Product  This Thing Helped Me Wake Up And Quit A Couple of Nasty Habits...  But The Only Issue I Have Is The Band Is Way to Small And It Wont Fit My Wrist  I Tryed To Return But It Was To Late....  Its Nice But Really Small If Your A Bigger Wrist Kind Of Person I Got An Extender..  But It Still Hurts My Wrist...
4.0,"Initially did really well, nice tight chain links so it snag clothes or towels too much, color as shown. Then all of a sudden after about 3 months chain links started to come undone and color started coming off.<br />Oh well not very expensive but I’d have liked to see it last longer. My Bayite ( no longer made) last a year without issue."
4.0,Very breathable and functional.
4.0,"This coat is beautiful, but I had to do some adjustments: the sleeves were two inches too long and the hood was too deep (covers the eyes). I also reinforced the button stitches.<br /><br />Actually, I liked the sleeves being too long, because usually they run short, and, in this coat, I could adjust them precisely to my size.<br /><br />The coat is very nice, the fabric feels good and heavy, the fitting is flattering and the shape is unique. If you have some minor tailoring skills, just buy it.<br /><br />I used the seller's size chart, and it worked just fine. Maybe I can wear a sweater inside. Lenght was perfect for me (166 cm)."
4.0,"Love it Love it Love it.... I stuck my hands in my pockets and the left pocket had a hole in it, thats the reason I gave it 4 1/2 stars. I couldn't return it because It came on Thursday and another one would've came too late for me to wear on the upcoming Saturday. Besides that I would've given the product 5 stars."
4.0,I expected soft sweatpants but there actually an athletic material and they can be static so they stick to my legs
4.0,I’m returning because I don’t like the top collar BUT it fits perfectly and has a great look to it. I just wish it didn’t have all those fake jewels  at the neck.
4.0,"These boots were purchased to be used as part of a costume, so they didn't have to be very comfortable, but they are perfectly suited for their purpose.  Not especially expensive, and not ideal for everyday use, but workable."
4.0,"Exactly as described; Med worked for me -  for 145 lb, 5'5&#34;; The material is fine, not perfect (you can tell the poly content is higher than the cotton content), but the price is right"
4.0,"It fits well, looks good but I can only wear it for a short amount of time because it is so warm. Have not had any temps under 20 but I assume if I got below 0 it would be fine."
4.0,They look beautiful for the price!
4.0,beautiful. Larger and heavier than expected.
4.0,"I ordered this dress a size up, which proved to be an error.  It is sized according to the Amazon default or conventional US sizes for a middle-of-the-range brand.  I received a free sample in return for my review.<br /><br />The design of this dress is rather idiosyncratic, as it plain to see.  What is important to know is that the cloth is of a good weight.  So it is a bit warm for summer.  The overall effect is very stylish and modest.  It does hang in a way that means you may want to wear a slip.<br /><br />I expected this to be a good summer dress but actually it works better as a statement dress for something like a cocktail party. It is nice to have an option that has pizzazz without being raunchy in any way."
4.0,"not fit me, too small but I still love it. I still looking for jade bangle bracelet size bigger than these one.  I hope can find it soon."
4.0,"The tassels make it adorable, gave it to one of my daughters, she especially loves the adjustable strap so it can be used as crossbody bag."
4.0,Large but I love it
4.0,"I have never ordered a bathing suit online before and was a little nervous about how quality it would be. The quality turned out to be quite good. The red is a little darker than in the picture but still pretty. I'm 5'3&#34; and 132 lbs. My belly is what I need to hide most, and this suit does that. I love ruching, which this suit has, but my favorite part is how the skirt starts at the waist rather than drop hip and makes me look pleasantly curvy instead of pudgy. My only real issue is that the halter strap is a bit too long, so my size C's don't really have enough lift. I do like the suit a lot, though, and I sew, so I'm going to try to shorten the strap. Be warned that it is snug going over the hips, but that's not uncommon in bathing suits with ruching. Overall I really like it and would give it 5 stars if the halter strap tied instead of hooking."
4.0,"Pockets are too small, if you sit down your phone sill fall out."
4.0,"Not a whole lot to say about earrings I suppose but they are nice and they look great. I like that the colors aren’t super flashy. They work well to accent any outfit and will accompany many color schemes. The backs stay put and don’t slide around, they do hold the earrings on securely.<br />I haven’t had any issues with any jewels falling off or being loose. They come in a nice velvet drawstring sack. They are also individually packaged inside the larger black sack. I appreciate the time and effort it seems went into making a quality product with nice packaging.<br />These could easily be purchased to sell in a retail store or at a kiosk in a mall somewhere. (if it’s legal to do that, if it isn’t then scratch what I just said) I only say so because the smaller packages that each set of earrings is on has an opening in the top where it appears it should be hung on a rack of some kind<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and un-biased review. I am under no obligation to write good things about this product but only to detail my actual experiences with it. I do recommend this selection to anyone looking to get a number of versatile earrings in one neat package. I feel that they are priced right as well.<br />IF THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFUL TO YOU, PLEASE CLICK YES!! Thanks and Happy Shopping!"
4.0,"These shirts are very soft and go with just about everything. I like that they're nice and long, so they come down further on your body. On me, they cover my front and back but while I'm not real short, (5'4"") I do run longer in the legs than the torso. They wash great. I just hang them dry and there are no wrinkles or anything like that. The only problem I have with them (and why I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars,) is that they are a tad tight in the underarm. I don't have particularly muscular or fatty arms at all. I don't usually have this problem. In fact, usually shirts are larger in that area on me, if anything. But it's not like they pinch or anything and they don't look weird. It's just that I can feel them and that's unusual for me, especially with just a small, cap sleeve like these have."
4.0,super comfy. one of my favs. I usually wear a medium. I ordered a small based on other reviews and it's still a little big.
4.0,"It was finally time to get some new slippers so for the price I tried these out.<br /><br />When I first got them they were the most comfortable slipper ever and I couldn't be happier with them. After about three months of wearing at night just before bed the wear and tear finally started to show.  They became stretched out. The cushion on the bottom was wearing down, and the glue near the toe started to split. They were very cozy slippers, but don't last as long as I would have liked.<br /><br />Will I buy another pair? I sure will. For the price that you pay I don't expect indestructible pair of slippers. They did their job and I was happy and comfy with them."
4.0,Bought as a Christmas present she love it
4.0,"Love the look, but the 1.25 is only in the very middle, still try to wear occasionally  because they look great."
4.0,"Soft shirt. A little long. However,  I'm only 5 ft"
4.0,"I like this, it hides some of my saggy mommy tummy ( I have alot of that and diastasis recti), I love the red color that I chose and the only thing I wish was better or at least adjustable would be boobie support,  I wish I could tighten the strings to lift the girls a little more instead of letting gravity keep em down and apart if you know what I mean...But still looks pretty good and I would even wear with shorts to go out looking cute!<br />Btw Im 5'3 weigh 157 and got a medium to really tighten and hide the tummy  :)"
4.0,"We ordered this dress in Navy blue for my daughter's prom. It was beautiful and the fit was perfect. However, we returned it because we expected it to have lace on the skirt as well as the bodice. When it came in, the lace was only on the bodice. I thought it was still beautiful, however, our daughter wanted the all-over lace. Although we did return the dress, we were able to order the same dress with the all-over lace. The only difference was the length of the sleeves. When ordering, make sure you order the right style."
4.0,I bought these for my job but mostly use as House shoes . They are comfortable but a little bulky. I feel like wreck it Ralph when I wear them out lol.
4.0,Very nice necklace and as picture
4.0,Runs large. Nice material.
4.0,"I got this band in an attempt to replicate the watch Cliff Booth wears in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. I definitely like it. Soft leather, good quality. My only complaint is that this is more yellow then brown."
4.0,"Overall, seems like it is nice quality. I normally wear a medium or large so I ordered a medium...and it is much too big. Perhaps it is just the style of the shirt but it seems closer to an XL than a medium."
4.0,"Really slick and cool looking clip, especially like it knowing it's a single mold without any welds etc. It's a bit smaller than I imagined and it can be a bit tough to get it clipped to your pants if you're using this to hold your keys. But otherwise it's a good little clip with a futuristic look and feel."
4.0,I would love it if it didn't stain my white shirt. DO NOT wear it with light cloths
4.0,Timex has always been a reliable product for me. The only complaint I have is the watch band is too small for how big my wrists are. Yes I know I can get a replacement band somewhee else but I'd like an option to get a larger band when I order the watch. Other than that I prefer the cloth band to the metal link. Again Timex has always been a great watch for me.
4.0,"I received the medium size dress for review and it fits but is kind of snug.  I'm 5'9"", 142 lbs, 34B, have female birthing hips and long arms.  The sleeves were too short, and it went around my hips but kind of snug.  The material is soft and sleeky and is a nice color.  I doubt I will be wearing this dress simply because I just don't feel comfortable in it.  I need a Large size for a better fit."
4.0,"A great shirt, just not the right size."
4.0,The hats are too small for my 2 yr old's head. he has a large head for his age but the size i ordered was  2 yr- 6yrs. I will have to give this item away unfortunately.  I like that the sheild is not attatched to the hat.
4.0,Not exactly what you see in the picture but I still love it
4.0,It fits loose but other than that it fits great for a 5&#34;8 167 ib girl.
4.0,Very cute but look babyish because of the easy release thing on the back
4.0,Its nice but bigger than i was hoping for
4.0,Me agradó mucho la calidad de la tela.
4.0,"Loved them, only they were a little big but material is great"
4.0,"Good earings. They are magnetic, which can be difficult for little girls."
4.0,I liked these earrings but they were too big to put together if you have more than one piercing and want to wear them together as a set. Good quality but too big. Returned
4.0,"Very nice shirt fits well, breathable,  cool & comfortable."
4.0,"they were a gift and she loves them,soft, and fit well."
4.0,Nice & warm cardigan. I love the material its very cozy and reminds of the Barefoot brand. The only negative about the cardigan is that the pockets hang loose inside which bothers a little bit.
4.0,"Bought this for my 10 year old daughter. She seems to like it! However it’s not shiny all of the time. Only when light is shining on it, is it the shiny coloring. Otherwise it’s a flat reddish pink color. All in all, cute."
4.0,"If you have a round butt go a size up to get the effect. Other then that I love them. I returned the first pair not because they didn't fit but because the butt area looked like regular tights. Sized up, and I'm happy for the price, can't complain."
4.0,"I bought this chain to go with my diffuser necklace, it works great and is strong enough yet still looks classy."
4.0,"I bought the green skirt.<br />In terms of its looks, it is a sage green with a grey undertone; it is a subtle, not overly bright color which makes it easy to match.<br />It has a single layer of tulle over a smooth polyester skirt.  I would prefer more than one layer of tulle to hide the opaque fabric, but it is not bad.  The under layer is not sheer, and there is NO stretch.<br />As for sizing,  I was really unsure of what to get. I bought it for my sister who wears a size 6 dress.<br />Because of the reviews saying it ran small, I decided to buy the 2XL.<br />It definitely is not a 2XL...the measurements are roughly 15.5 inches (31 circumference) at the top of the waist band, and 18.5 inches (37 circumference) at the base of the waist band.  Below the band it is fuller, so it can accommodate more.<br />Based on the 2XL, I'd say the skirt runs about 2 sizes too small (the 2XL=size large).<br />It was too big for my sister to wear on her waist, so I am going re-order a size down.<br />It is a long length...32 inches, which is mid calf (at least) depending on your height.<br />I will have to hem it because I think it is an awkward length. I was overwhelmingly long on my sister (about 5'5"").<br /> I'm 5'9"", and was long on me, too. I think just below the knee is more flattering.<br />Overall, it is cute and definitely wearable with a little adjustment."
4.0,Was very happy with this pin. I bought it to wear during our VBS Blast Off.
4.0,"I loved the color, I would rather not had side slits, but I would have kept it anyway. I sadly sent it back because I'm pear shaped and the pockets were placed in an awkward place which made my hips look even larger."
4.0,"It is a beautiful bracelet, I love it ."
4.0,"At first, the fit chafed under the arms, but became more comfortable with wear. Otherwise, very nice for the price."
4.0,"Slim and slender belt and buckle that fit perfectly through small belt loops. It's challenging to get incremental adjustments, though, and I wish the belt itself wasn't so long."
4.0,"I love the idea of these. It's so cool. But I get so many scan errors. It's frustrating to my kid who wants to, &#34;do it myself&#34; lol"
4.0,Fun product and a great buying experience.
4.0,Perfect size for what I need but the sticky part is not as sticky as I would like it to be. It is convenient and easy to use.
4.0,The picture is true to color. It's the teal I was looking for. It looks good on all body types but the bridesmaids thought the fabric to be tied was a bit long.
4.0,The zipper on the largest piece is a little busted but other than that love it. So cute.
4.0,Like the look and breakaway points.
4.0,"They seem to run a little large, but the material is nice and they look great."
4.0,The fit was great the material is a little thick and very hot for florida. But it's a beautiful well made dress. Will look great for maternity photo shoot.
4.0,Looks great until 2 months go by. Then the cotton begins to pilf or whatever it's called when you have tiny balled up cotton balls
4.0,A little difficult getting on and I am curious if any holes will develop on the bottom of the foot.  Otherwise they have been great!  Compress well and stay in place all day.
4.0,"Beautiful mala, the tassel is my favorite because it has both colors but for some reason I thought the beads would be white/cream color but they’re more of a blush/pink color. Other than that it’s a nice enough mala, the stones aren’t the best (not super cheap but definitely not very genuine) but you get what you paid for."
4.0,Good size.  Lighter weight than I thought but that works out since I don't like heavy earrings.  Picture represents the actual product really well.  Probably about 7 or 8 mm in diameter.
4.0,"Very pretty dress, a fun pop of print with a sweater in this dreary weather"
4.0,I love this collar! Now my outfits are even more cute than before! My only complaint is that the collar was a little larger than expected !! Still very cute and worth the purchase!
4.0,Daughters graduation gift! Super cute & just as pictured!
4.0,I can use it as a purse. Not big enough to hold a laptop or books.  It's nicely made. Pretty pattern.
4.0,"The watch band has a very low profile and is very comfortable. The surface has a soft texture and it feels like it’s barely there. When I wear it, I have to tighten/readjust the band every so often. I work retail and the mild movements durning my work day cause the band to loosen. It is very easy to tighten so it isn’t a big deal or annoyance. I would imagine wearing it during a more strenuous activity i.e. working out, it would cause it to loosen more often."
4.0,My Daughter wears a size 6 in dresses. This run about a size or two big in my opinion. It is made well and looks so cute on. It's a little long to. We would definitely recommend this dress just order a size down if you kiddo is slim and tall.
4.0,"Looks cheaper in person than it does in the picture.  Overall, it is still pretty and the price was very fair."
4.0,These are so cute for winter slipper shoes.  The only downside is that my daughter can't really wear them out and about because the sole is so thin but I knew that when I picked them up and still adore them.
4.0,"A much better fit than I expected from this all-in-one balaclava mask.<br /><br />It fits my L/XL size head comfortably, with no pressure from the ear loops. It stays in place well and provides a pretty decent level of neck protection. Even on my large noggin, there's a lot of extra material, so their suggested ""other uses"" (bandana, gaiter, etc) all seem plausible.<br /><br />As a balaclava, it's a little hard to breathe through, the material is quite tightly woven. But as a mask, that's a positive-- better filtration.<br /><br />The mask showed no signs or wear or shrinking after a first washing (cold water, line dry). Recommended."
4.0,Love the colors...vibrant
4.0,"It's a great sweater, I wish I had sized up. I bought a am XL which normally I am swimming in. For reference I wear a size 12-14 in women's. It fits my arm length exactly but it's not big enough for me to wrap closed across the front of me which was what I was hoping for. It does fit but I was hoping for a looser fit."
4.0,"I'm an expert on these leggings because I wear them ALL the time. I bought about 15 pairs with different black on black prints and, honestly, I wear them all day every day. They are super soft inside due to the fleece and sooooo cozy, but yet they also look really good on. I wear them to just lounge around the house with a hoodie. Or I wear them out on the town with a cute top and boots. I've tried many similar looking pants, like ponte pants, but I can't wear them after wearing these leggings because these leggings are so much more comfortable. And so inexpensive! It's great to buy 10 pairs for the same price other brands would charge for one pair of pants.<br /><br />Only trouble is that, with certain pairs, the dye rubs off on to other things when you first get them. So best to wash them twice before wearing. That's my only complaint!"
4.0,"I really like these because they are comfortable and do what they are designed to do. However, bring a bigger athlete, I ordered an extra large, since that’s usually what I have to wear in most athletic wear, and they are a bit too big. The stretch is great, so I recommend ordering down a size."
4.0,"Treblesvals Cross Back Pinafore Apron for Women with Pockets is made in China of a lightweight cotton/linen blend.<br /><br />The hems have fabric that is doubled and evenly stitched.  The inside seams are serger finished.  The only raw edges are on the inside of the pockets which is a negative. Pockets can take a beating and single stitching with unfinished and fraying raw edges is not usually enough to prevent holes.<br /><br />The two pockets on this pinafore are perfectly placed.  They measure 6.5” wide and 7.5” high so can hold ever the largest phone easily.  The pocket stitching is reinforced on the upper corner stress points.<br /><br />The laundry tag states that it should be washed in cold water, no bleach and line dried.  The material is cotton/linen which will shrink some with heat.  This material is very lightweight and ideal for a pinafore apron since it doesn’t add an uncomfortably hot and heavy layer of clothing while working in the kitchen or outdoors in the summer.<br /><br />The fit for me is perfect.  I’m 5’4” and weigh 110 pounds.  It comes down to mid-calf length and covers me completely in the back.  There are no wrap around ties on this pinafore apron but adding a piece of hook and loop tape in the back at the waistline can give a tighter fit and keep it more fully closed.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful apron.  It would be a full five stars if the pockets were finished inside."
4.0,I wish it had a solid bottom so when you put items in it it would not sag on the bottom of the bag !
4.0,"Very soft and warm, I felt they ran a little big."
4.0,"Looks cool, but cheap made stuff. Go for something different if you need more durable wristband. Worth the money anyways"
4.0,Nice fit. Red wasn't very vibrant.
4.0,Smaller than expected but a decent size
4.0,Really soft but it’s a little thin and the picture looks a little smudged not terrible just a little. I would still rock this t it’s so cute and supper soft!
4.0,"Very comfortable, but it you like your clothes to fit a little looser, go up 1 size. I haven't washed it yet, so may have a change of mind if it shrinks a lot. Really gives a slimming look which I like as well."
4.0,"Doesn't block as much light as I hoped, but just as reflective as I hoped. Don't leave in the sun or the metal will get hot."
4.0,Not a bod umbrella it does the job. The umbrella is a little flimsy but easily fulfills its purpose.
4.0,"It is pretty, well made. The fabric is soft but a little thicker than, say the Miss Elaine."
4.0,Es un poco pequeño para mi gusto
4.0,Has a nice look.  After a while the fabric can droop.  Perhaps more starch can keep the fabric stiff longer.  Looks really classy.
4.0,My bestie got arrested in this!!! She enjoyed! She died in prison lol 😂 when am I getting my mfin beacket back tho breo
4.0,"The Blingwrap stays on all day and works well to keep rings from slipping.  I have to cut mine to size which is not a big deal but maybe the kit should contain multiple lengths?  Overall, great idea and product works."
4.0,Cute & Cozy. A little long but I guess I’m short! 5’6. Would buy again.
4.0,"fit great, really comfortable, a little thin but I wanted them for under my clothes so it works great for me."
4.0,Polishing cloth works as advertised. Cleaned several rings and chains. Worth the investment.
4.0,"I love this skirt! The color is lovely (I got olive green), and it is very stretchy and comfortable. The waist was a little large... even though I ordered a small... which only meant that it sat a little lower on my hips than I would have liked. But that was easily remedied by rolling the waist. The only real con I have about this skirt is the fabric does begin to pill if it rubs up against something, like boots. But this is really minor. The skirt itself is beautiful, feminine and twirly!"
4.0,Quality enamel pins. Plus Bob Ross and his happy little tree!
4.0,"Bought as a gift, its really cute but definitely runs SMALL. For being a maternity shirt I expected a little room for growth but not much with this shirt so do not hesitate to order even a couple sizes up because of the rousched sides if it starts out a little too big you'll still be able to pull the look off while looking cute!"
4.0,This lanyard is sturdy all except for the clip. It seems not up to the same quality as the rest of the lanyard.
4.0,worked well at monster truck show
4.0,"They are super cute, the only complaint I have would be that they are a little dis portioned."
4.0,"I love this dress, I am a size 12 petite therefore I should have purchased a small. not the medium"
4.0,"This is my 4th pair of sorrels. These look great. My only beef is they took almost all summer to break in. The ankle bit rubs right at the bony prominence and I basically had blisters the whole time. Band-aids were my friend. By summers end, they were fine. Guess we will meet again next summer."
4.0,Great swimsuit for the price. Love the coverage. Not made for small chested women.
4.0,"Luckily they are stretchy material.  I ordered one size and was sent one size down.  I didn't have time to return, as I needed them.  I ordered the darker pair in the correct size, and both fit about the same."
4.0,it is lovely but my wife s size is small this is bigger than normal small size dress
4.0,"I’m 200lb, 42” bust 36” waist 48” hips and got the XXL. Since the fabric has some stretch, I probably could have gone down to an XL for a tighter fit. It’s a little loose around my chest, probably because I don’t wear bras. This is solidly a cute party/cocktail dress. It didn’t make me feel sexy like I was hoping for, but that’s less an issue with the product and more an issue with the expectations I came in with/the fact that I’m still learning how to dress a plus-side body.<br /><br />As you can see from the first picture, it’s a good base piece but it needs a wide belt at the waist to give it some shape. The second picture is the inner seams. If you’re texture-sensitive, the horizontal seam at the waist will bother you. (It bothers me a little bit, but not enough to get rid of it.)<br /><br />Be aware that this bleeds color a lot. I hand-washed it in warm water to get the excess dye out, and the wash water looked like sudsy fruit punch. I would recommend hand-washing it on its own until it stops bleeding color."
4.0,Really light weight
4.0,Used it once. It is good and solid enough for my hiking trip.
4.0,"These are nice Sports Shorts however they do run small. However, to be fair, not everyone can wear boy shorts"
4.0,Very thin face masks. Looks very nice but don’t think it’s something good for protection.<br />They are very comfortable and light weight
4.0,I love the look as they are just beautiful. One doesn’t stay looped/locked on my ear so I have to constantly adjust the fitting. I wore them with a suit to a Broadway play and they looked great!
4.0,"There is potential with this dress but it’s definitely trial and error. I range from a size 2-4 or xs-small in most dresses, and also this dress is pretty stretchy I’d recommend going a size or maybe even two sizes up IF you want to wear it with the knot tied in the front. I think I ordered a small the first time then a large the second time, the small fit fine without the knot so I had to order up to give extra room for tying it. Also what everyone said about the collar is accurate, the collar is really awkward. Aside from that not a bad product."
4.0,Quality is better than expected although not sure it warrants the price. Hope it holds up to washing!
4.0,I bought a size larger than I calculated on their sizing chart and it fit well.
4.0,Great sun glasses for the money
4.0,"I tried this band as I have seb derm/eczema and the other rubber/metal bands cause flare ups due to lack of air flow.  I like the look of this, but as others have mentioned, its quite tight.  So I still had the issue under the fitbit, and it got very uncomfortable having the fabric folds squeezed into my wrists.  I wish they had a size option."
4.0,"Cute boots, very comfortable. Generally fits true to size - although the shaft is a bit more snug than most boots."
4.0,I like these casual slide-ons so much that I'm going to buy a pair for my neighbor.
4.0,Ordered a large. Runs small more like a medium but it’s still good quality
4.0,"I was hoping that the leather was a bit more thick and durable. Nevertheless, it was okay."
4.0,"Great customer service - My father did not fit the socks I ordered.  They were really tight and he couldn't pull them up pass his ankles.  After contacting the seller, I received a new pair in the next size for free.  My father liked them and said they helped him.  I would order one size up next time because the size chart didn't seem accurate."
4.0,"Should have ordered the large, but that is my fault not yours.  Great shirt"
4.0,It is very comfortable and looks nice with pants
4.0,I purchased this necklace for my granddaughter who loves purple & wanted a long chain.  It was described as having a 40 inch chain.  So I was  surprised when it arrived with a short chain (maybe 20 inches - didn't measure it) .  I kept it as with postage etc. it was't worth returning.
4.0,It's super cute a little larger then I expected
4.0,Comfortable.  Fit well over a wrapped sprain
4.0,"Not a valid covid mask! Very cheaply made & is not safe as a covid mask. That said, it's great for laughs! My doctors seem to love it but the nurses don't,  I don't understand why. Lmfao. For some reason this mask is violated as sexual activity & nudity on social media apps in videos & pics I've done wearing it, buyer beware."
4.0,The crotch is way too baggy
4.0,"These do not peep out of my shoes.  But after a day of wear the top seam rubs against my foot  in the back, above my heel.  Still, much better than a lot of the others I've tried."
4.0,Very nice much higher quality than expected
4.0,Have been looking for a case to fit my iphone 6.  It fits great which provides me additional protection.  It has zipper pocket on the outside and a pocket inside which you can a carry money and some cards.  Not large enough for keys.  The case a bit thicker than my old one but it works for me.
4.0,Ordered a size small and it fits as expected. I like this T-shirt. Some were complaining of the material but I found it to be soft. Looks just like the photo. Good purchase for the price.
4.0,The white shirt had some dirt marks on its package was ripped
4.0,"I purchased these shoes for my niece and they are adorable!! The only complaint I have is that the sizing is off. I got her a size 7, which is her usual size, and these were extremely big. Maybe order 2 sizes down. I needed these for an event she was in and I had to go out and purchase new shoes b/c of the sizing. She'll be able to wear them later on, which is good, but it was an inconvenience."
4.0,Awesome to get a size that finally fits but it does shape your boobs kinda weird.
4.0,I Feel like the garnet stone should be a little smaller and have a lower setting. Otherwise a gorgeous ring which I have gotten many compliments on!
4.0,The colors are true to what is seen on the computer. Great necklace for the price. Not too heavy
4.0,Gorgeous but break easily
4.0,Needed black sunglasses for a school costume for my daughter...these worked perfectly! So hard to find all black sunglasses. Great quality and fit too!
4.0,"Excellent t-shirts, they are nice and long but they are a little narrow around the chest area i would say the chest fits more like a 12 but the length is true to size,"
4.0,"Cute, but I wore a vest over it and after one time it rubbed the fabric into balls."
4.0,"Runs small so order a size or two larger! Thankfully I read other reviews before purchasing. I'm 5'2&#34; and weigh 128 and ordered a size Large. The coat fit well with a sweat shirt on underneath and I was pleased with the amount of warmth it provided. I needed a coat to wear when I walk the dog, one not very fancy but would offer good protection from the wind and cold-I am happy with my purchase. I cannot stress enough the importance of buying a larger size."
4.0,This arrived much earlier than expected.  Nice - but the gold color running thru it - could have be omitted for my liking.  otherwise i like.  the price is<br />very low for what it is. It's very cool.  i know i will wear often.
4.0,"I like the neckline on this tunic a lot. The material is lightweight, which is okay for here in Florida. I like pockets and since most leggings and skinny pants don't have them, it's kind of cool that the top does."
4.0,unsure  xmas gift to son and have no idea
4.0,"Very pretty, basic earrings. Expected a little more sparkle, but still nice."
4.0,"This &#34;dress&#34; is adorable, but I bought it to wear as a tunic because I don't do minis. I'm normally a size 8/10 and ordered the XL. There are two reasons I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars. 1.) It's definitely NOT chiffon, as advertised. It doesn't have a fabric label inside, but I'm guessing it's either cotton, rayon or a blend because it looks like it will wrinkle fairly easily. 2.) I was expecting a white background because that's how it looks on my computer, but it's way more of a yellowish cream (see my photos). I was hoping to wear it with white capris but the shade is too off, so I'll wear it with navy capris or jeans.<br /><br />It arrived so wrinkled that I had to wash it before I could even try it on. My machine has a &#34;hand wash&#34; cycle, so I washed it in cold water and then hung it to dry. All the wrinkles magically came out, and I didn't notice any shrinkage.<br /><br />I'm wondering if there is more than one version of this dress, using different fabric, because some people say it's very sheer and others say it's not. Mine is not sheer, which for me is good. All in all, I would recommend it as long as you're not expecting a chiffon dress with a true white background."
4.0,"My 20 year old daughter wanted something like this for yoga and exercise. The fabric is much nicer than I expected. It's soft, but it's also pretty thick. It's not see through at all. Of course, you can see the lines of garments worn underneath, but you can't see the designs and colors. The sizing was as expected. There's a good amount of stretch in the leggings. The bra looked small, but it did fit my daughter fine. She's a 34D. It doesn't offer much support though. She says it will be fine for yoga, but she won't be able to jog or run in it without wearing another bra underneath."
4.0,"Nice hat, too big for me. There is no such thing as S/M. It is either S or M. Just like there is no such thing as &#34;One size fits all&#34;."
4.0,"Soft, comfortable, cool fabric"
4.0,"Wore to a casual cocktail party.  Did the job, but was a bit too big on me.  Was better than being too small, so gets 4 stars"
4.0,"Nice run around pants . Cool in the heat , everyone has their own experience."
4.0,"I mostly like this dress, it's very sexy and I love the beige color which makes it chic. The only drawback unlike some reviewers said, it does NOT have a built in bra and although the stretchy fabric provides some compression on the boobs keeping them in place (I have a b cup) you def could see nipples if the temps got chilly. Also to make the dress tight enough to hold down the boobs it cuts into the back fat which is unattractive. Still I love the below the knee length, color, and fun straps. This dress is definitely made for a girl with a full bottom half. I ordered a medium and am a dress size 6 US and am 5' 6&#34; and 145lbs. I carry my weight on my bottom half. Also the photos show the dress w/o a bra. I reccomend the dress as a whole since it is very sexy."
4.0,Nice quality. Loved the style and most of the fit. Not quite right in the seat area so I had to return.
4.0,"This dress is unbelievably cute for the price. The other reviews were correct: the zipper is not great. It's a side zip, and it gets stuck at the waist, so I have to shimmy the dress over my head. That's the only reason I didn't give it five stars. It really is stunning."
4.0,"I do wish this was made in nylon, I need wallets to be lightweight.  I like how there is plenty of room so the snap works well."
4.0,"Too little for any of my fingers...tried to wear it but my circulation turned my finger to as light blue which i didn't think was a good idea. So i don't wear it until i can find someone to add a couple links. Otherwise, im keeping it because it's just so cute! and it works"
4.0,"This is a pretty fashion necklace that makes a classic statement. The pearls are nice but are not individually knotted so the necklace doesn't have the look of a fine piece of jewelry. But for an inexpensive piece of fun fashion jewelry, this is a good buy, especially at the discounted price that I received."
4.0,A genuine leather bag that is super attractive with a very cheap price.  I wanted a large bag for travelling and it is just right for me.  The adjustable strap and closure zipper are great features that come with it.  I love it.
4.0,These were a lot longer than I had expected and a little too heavy for me.
4.0,I ordered the green one and loved it. So decided to order the red. The dress was horrible. Smelled like mold. Different fabric too.
4.0,"Overall, I like this dress a lot, and I'll be keeping it to wear to a company Christmas party; however, I would change some things about it if I could.<br /><br />1) The skirt is a little tight right under the waist area.  I'm two-months post-partum with my third baby, so granted, I'm a bit thick in the hips at the moment, but typically, an A-line skirt would mask that.  The skirt on this fits just a little strangely right under the waist band, snug for the first couple inches at the top of the skirt.<br /><br />2) The fabric of the skirt is oddly thick and sort of strange-feeling.  I'm not the hugest fan.  It would have been nice to have something softer or at at least flowier.  It's just sort of rough and heavy.  It looks nice, though, at least.<br /><br />Aside from those things, the bodice fits nicely, and the lace is very nice and soft with a beautiful sheen to it.  The inside of the top has a silicone strip around the inside to help it stay up in the absence of shoulders or straps.  There's a zipper on the side that's really well hidden so it's easy to get on.  I purchased the green, and it's a gorgeous emerald color.  Absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />(I'm 5'3"", currently about 175lb, 38D, and the large fits nicely - true-to-size, if not slightly larger than the promised size 12 equivalence.)"
4.0,"This cool, comfortable dress will take me into fall. I'm going to wear it with a denim jacket."
4.0,These are very nice swim trunks but they run small. My husband wears a medium 32-33 waist but I ordered a large because of other reviews. But they were tight in the waist.
4.0,Very nice just make sure to hand wash till all of the die stops running.;
4.0,"This is a great sweatshirt. The item I received looks exactly like the picture. However, I read the reviews, and due to so many customers claiming it runs really small, I ended up with a sweatshirt that is two sizes too big!! I was wanting a Men's Medium for my son. In addition, the material is 50/50 and doesn't shrink up. Also, because the material is a 50/50 blend, it does have some give or &#34;stretch&#34; to it as well.<br /><br />I will try to give some comparisons to help with the sizing issues. As stated, I ordered the X-Large size in this beautiful Irish print sweatshirt. I paired this X-Large up with my husbands sweatshirts that are Men's Large and X-Large. After comparing to various brands, such as Under Armour, Champion, Russell, Nike, Adidas, and Billabong, etc. I can honestly say that this X-Large Irish print sweatshirt is a &#34;generous&#34; large and close to an X-large in the other brands. So....it's kinda in between the two sizes. For purchasing purposes, I would probably lean towards calling this Irish sweatshirt in X-Large sizing to be most equivalent to a Men's Large instead.<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />Please ask questions if anything I said is unclear. Cheers! :0)"
4.0,"I like this watch. Perfect work watch, I can see the hands on a glance"
4.0,Nice :; make sure you  SIZE UP.... SO YOU CAN BREATHE EASY WHILE WEARING
4.0,"The glasses are nice - very lightweight, the lens is clear and provides good coverage from the sun.  It might be because I have a smallish head, but the fit wasn't quite right for me.  They are a bit wobbly on my ears and tend to sit a bit crooked."
4.0,This is a nice piece of jewelry that looks very nice on my husband. The chain itself seems a little under sized for him but it has held up well so far
4.0,longer than I was anticipating...
4.0,"So cute! I was nervous about ordering this because I wasn’t sure on sizing. But I’m 5’2, 175 lbs, and I’m a 38 DDD, and a L worked just fine. I probably could’ve used an XL, just because of the top fitting a little snug but other than that, it’s perfect!"
4.0,"Although warm for full day use in my area, helps in chilly days (I generally wear a ball cap), this works to listen to music or watch a movie if you have a cooler head. Won’t say it’s a perfect headset, nor anything comparable to something like regular over the ear or earbuds, but does the job well for what it is designed for (keep head warmer without as much between over the ear or messing with ear bud style). My biggest issue so far is trying to charge it, the plug in can be difficult at times, wants to hide inside the cloth. Have not got this item damp (or suggest it), as with most headphones, haven’t used long enough to drain battery, so can’t speak for battery life, have not made phone calls with it, can’t speak for that. I personally got it for music while I’m out in cooler weather doing photography, chores, etc."
4.0,"Unable to use touch screen on my iPhone and iPad while wearing Ozero gloves. Although the gloves are very comfortable and warm, the inability to use the touchscreen is very disappointing."
4.0,I love the ocean but hate the burning  salt water in my eyes. My granddaughter loves for me to go in the ocean with her so bot these.  They work great.  The anti fog works too.  I have a big head and these fit fine.
4.0,good comfortable socks. Easy to put on. your legs feel good at the end of the day. No more achy legs at the end of the day
4.0,Only reason I did not give it a 5 start was because the strap leave a line/mark on my face when I leave on for a little while. My gf does not have this issue so it would just be that I wear it tighter than her.
4.0,"This shirt is a silky skin tight material. Very nice and soft. The sleeves are long. I’m 5’8” and my main concern with long sleeve tops is length of sleeve. This has long sleeves. Only issue, it arrived with a small spot on it. I hope it comes out in the wash. I think it  Will. Very tiny spot though. I’m going to order it in another color now. Great shirt!!"
4.0,"These are cute! I needed some new shorts that had a little give. These did the trick. I'm 5'4, 136lbs. I ordered the medium. Very satisfied."
4.0,Wanted to add more casual tips to my wardrobe and this was so cute I couldn’t pass up
4.0,Very adorable but it was smaller than expected
4.0,Garment was cute but had a slight odor. I assume it came from China.  Once washed orderbis gone. But couldnt give it five stars because of that.
4.0,i received it without the cute hot chocolate box
4.0,"I wish I could have Sized up 1 more Size. It is very snug but, comfy. I wouldn't recommend the biggest size for anyone more then 160 lbss or r with hips bigger then 40"" bc it is snug on me.<br />I love the seamless look! I will definitely be doing yoga in this. I hope the crotch doesn't rip :)"
4.0,Very feminine design. Also very subtle yet can be dressed up or down.
4.0,Product was a little poor quality the lapels want to fold out.  Maybe adding a stitch to hold them down would help
4.0,I really like it! Good quality for a light jacket. Came earlier than I was expected.
4.0,Very good fitting
4.0,The dress fits nicely but the fabric seems cheap. The skirt is not as flowy as the picture shows. You will need to wear a petticoat to make it puff out more. It comes with a dash but there are no sash/belt holders  sewn on the sides of the dress.  Overall the dress is just okay for the occasion.
4.0,"Conforme ,pero podría ser mas fino el estuche"
4.0,this is not 4 me i order this 4 mt sister she wanted this color 2 wear but never go in the water at all going on a trip this year just maybe she might get in some water she likes because shorts under it with the skirt i try it on @ then order me 1 also we have never own a swimsuit before so thank u
4.0,"Like this top a lot. The only issue is that I need to roll up the sleeves all the way to my elbow in order to get the little fabric tab to reach the button to keep it there, but I just decided not to roll them up."
4.0,Bought a durag for my boyfriend which he likes and I bought the bonnet for myself which I don’t really like- it’s not baggy like I like my bonnets but that’s just a preference so I guess otherwise it’s pretty good. My mom wears it more than I ever have
4.0,"Love this mask!! Fit perfectly, which is a lot to say because i have had a hard time finding mask to fit properly!! The only set back for me was the glitter was not real glitter/ sequins- which thats what i was looking for. However still thought it wad a cute mask when i received it!! Wear it often!!"
4.0,Cute but thin...i thought they were thicker
4.0,Nice material. Stretchy. Looks good. I've got a belly though. Wish I would've ordered a size up.
4.0,"It is a very cute and playful hat for anyone willing to wear it. However, I feel the 2<br />puffs should be attached more securely onto the hat. Hopefully, they won't fall off.<br />Other than that, it's a very nice hat."
4.0,I love aurola but these are sheer!! I got the the mineral red ones and you can see my underwear lol. The quality is great although it is a little bit loose then the regular shorts.
4.0,Love it but rather large even with adjustable clip on smallest setting
4.0,"Continuing the journey of spicing things up in the bedroom! This see through baby doll camisole with matching thong is so sexy! My husband loves when I dress up for him and a lot of lingerie sets just do not come in my size or are not flattering to my body style. My go to is always baby doll camisoles as they cover a lot but still make me fell and look good.  The top is held in place with a single elastic strap. It stretches very large so it will fit most any women. The fabric is super soft and sheer and helps keep you cool while getting down to business. The stitching is done very well with no stray or frayed ends. The panties are also very stretchy and will fit a lot of waist sizes. The color was identical to the one pictured being very dark red. The price of the product is GREAT!!! Compared to others on the market this one comes in cheaper while still maintaining a good quality product.<br /><br />Overall I give this baby doll camisole 4 stars. It looks good, Makes me feel sexy, and drives my husband wild!!! I would recommend this for any women who is hesitant to dress up sexy for your significant other. These cover you well while still remaining exciting for the senses!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for a fair and honest review. These are my opinions and are intended to help other users decide if this is a product for them. I received no monetary compensation and was not required to give a favorable review. If you have any questions please ask. Thank You."
4.0,I'ts pretty ok. I use the bottoms but the tops very flimsy. The bottoms however make it worth it. If you have an a of b cup the top might work. I'm a 30 D 5'7 124lbs
4.0,Fit well and got the reaction I was looking for!
4.0,"I'm not sure if i 5-star like it because it kinda looks cheap but my boyfriend complimented it when I wore it to an elegant dinner. I also received a compliment from a lady during that same evening. I thought I will return it but for the price, I decided to keep it."
4.0,Turned out well for my costume.. I will say my face was HOT underneath
4.0,"These glasses are strictly for the drip, will not protect your eye on sunny days what so ever. The description claims ""100% UVA & UVB Protection"" but I think that's cap. Other than that they're pretty stylish and you get what you pay for."
4.0,Thanks it was very nice
4.0,"As a consumer with a large chest and broad shoulders empire style tops can be hit or miss. This one is a hit. It was easy to pull on, fit nicely across my chest. Cap sleeves do not pinch or pull, nice length to wear with leggings too.  Overall very pleased.  I thought I was buying a 95% cotton; 5% spandex product. So I was disappointed to see that it was 95% rayon not cotton. However, that was my misunderstanding.  I'm not a rayon fan as it usually needs to be dry cleaned however, this was wash and wear.  I washed on cold and line dried (to avoid melting it). It washed beautifully.  Seems to be good quality. Time will tell if it holds up well."
4.0,"I love thie braclet. THe colors are great, It fits well adn the clasp is easy to do. thank you"
4.0,Awful fit. Cheaply made and not like the picture. Sitting there on the counter
4.0,Looks absolutely gorgeous in pictures. One star taken because of the size issue.
4.0,"I ordered rose gold and was sent yellow gold.  I will not send it back because I can use it but really want you to send me the rose gold tone which I originally ordered.  I've ordered 5 bracelets from this company and if they wish to sell me more product must correct their error by sending me the rose gold bracelet I requested. I think when a customer puts confidence in a company and the company fails the customer, some retribution is owed to that customer.  In this case the customer is me.  Please contact me ASAP regarding this error on your part."
4.0,"I love the style of this tankini, and it constructed very well, but I have to return it because the top doesn't fit me right.  The bra is a little small for a large busted woman, even when I took out the enhancer cups.  It was just a little more revealing than I'd like it to be."
4.0,It looks exactly like it is pictured. I purchased it as a stocking stuffer and it was well received. I thought it looked very nice.
4.0,I like how it looks. The problem I have is the wrist band is too thick. I’m most of the time busy with water and it take way too long to dry
4.0,Fits well on my watch but I have to be careful to make sure it is attached.
4.0,This dress is cute! The sleeves are bigger than expected but it's worth the price.
4.0,"This dress is super cute! I love the style and how the length. It comes down to just over my knees. The dress is a bit small in the chest area, but I am not to concerned since I am losing weight. I would recommend ordering at least a size or two bigger than you would normally wear. I ordered an XXL even though I thought a XL would fit, but thankfully I chose to go a little higher up. I am hoping to be able to wear this by the spring. I love that the fabric is not see through like most women's clothes are. I do not need to wear a slip under this dress.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"A bit snug to get on but once they're on, they're a perfect fit, super cute, and my daughter likes wearing them. They're comfortable."
4.0,This dress is actually very well made. It is lined and for the price I paid that in itself is extraordinary. The color is great. Two issues-the ribbon has to be detached and redone to look anything like the picture and the top is way too tight. I am not hugely busty and I ordered a XXL because of this same complaint  but this dress squished me up top a lot. I am wearing it one night for about 5 hours....hope I can breathe all that time!!
4.0,"Definitely size up. My 6 year old typically wears size 7/8 but I order the 10, and it fits just right. The cap is super cute as well and fits nice and tight."
4.0,Nice for the price! Dressed it up with jewelry and cute shoes for a Christmas party.
4.0,It’s a great pattern and material - well made. I did find that the armholes are very small. If you are smaller framed it should be great as it wouldn’t show a bra or hang too low. However if you have larger arms it may be too small.
4.0,"Washes and dries quickly, super light weight. Shows every bit of your butt sweat though."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised to see such great quality with this purse and wallet ... I purchased it for traveling however, I may use it everyday."
4.0,I like it but size down a size.
4.0,Nice looking and comfortable shorts.
4.0,It was nice and was of great quality and got a lot of compliments
4.0,"Comfy texture. They are designed to be short in length - shoulder fits me very well but it only just covers my belly, if I lift my arms my belly will show. Very suitable for wearing at home in hot summer."
4.0,Works awesome however if you have big nose bridge light still come through.  Extremely comfortable and fitting. I'll be ording more since I lost my last pair.
4.0,"Love this. Feminine fit. Very lightweight. I am 5’4”, 130lbs. Bought the medium. Slim fit but not too snug around midline."
4.0,I gave it as a gift to my niece and she loved it.
4.0,"4/5 stars because it is very comfortable, but doesn’t offer much protection/filtering for use as a protective face covering."
4.0,Though very nice materials and nice looking. They are a little too big. Might want to order a smaller size.
4.0,"I like this shirt alot, it was exactly what I was looking for. My o ly complaint is that it runs a little small. I usually wear a women's 16/18 or xlarge so I ordered an xl and it is short. I am going to air dry it."
4.0,My cousin loves this outfit and wears it to family parties.
4.0,absorbent.
4.0,"needs more support in the ankle, it slips"
4.0,"Height 5’3” Weight 135 lbs<br />I bought this dress for a Christmas costume bar crawl and it was a hit! I got so many compliments! I did use a short petticoat underneath- I was worried the skirt wasn’t wide enough but it is. It is a very cute dress however what I don’t like is that the bottom has a raw edge- not hemmed. I am afraid of washing it and the edges getting frayed. I guess I can hem it myself. The extra work is worth it though. I kind of also don’t like the material a whole lot either. It’s like shiny  spandex but for a cute costume it didn’t matter. I used Fakespot to check for fake and unreliable reviews. It reads, analyzes and then adjusts the rating to be more accurate. The adjusted rating was rather low, like 2.5 stars for this dress so I was hesitant to buy it but couldn’t find anything else similar with better reviews. I’m glad I did! I think people who expect great quality fabric and stitching might be disappointed but I really wasn’t and was very happy with it!"
4.0,"This was nice while it lasted, but the pearl became detached after less than a year. The chain is nice quality, but the pendant was not durable. The company was responsive and offered to fix it for me."
4.0,Seems like it might be ok quality but the pearl is purple  not blue
4.0,I wear them to work as as courtesy clerk and they are comfortable.
4.0,This was a nice gift for my honey and i. He loved them!
4.0,"The sunglasses are cheap, look as expected, and get the job done.  The only issue I have with them is that the lenses are a bit too dark sometimes."
4.0,Small ring and sort of cheap looking
4.0,Looks full and is well made. Clasp is nice
4.0,"So cozy. Would have given five stars BUT no pockets. Missed having pockets or these wild have been perfect. Soft and comfy! Could have worn a L rather than XL, but I like looser fitting pajamas."
4.0,very good color and material was very sturdy and well made. would recommend though i will say since i am a female with an average neck even when i tightened this as tight as i could get it the tie still was a bit loose on my neck. not enough to make it unwearable though.
4.0,The packaging is pretty comes in a little pink velvet feeling pouch. The necklace is silver and looks dark the actual crystal is pretty but is dark and cloudy as well. I did switch it out off the necklace it came with and put it on my own necklace. Overall it’s ok. Let’s just hope it does it’s job :)
4.0,"I love this dress, very pretty, well made, worth the price. It was too big and I got a smaller size but on the replacement dress, the quality was poor, ornaments sewn on backwards, unfinished seams. I am very disappointed in the quality of the second dress I received. Also it was filthy dirty with sewing scraps, lint , it looked like it was dragged across the floor. There is definitely a quality control issue, I doubt I will purchase from this vendor again."
4.0,Pretty wonderful pair of boots! The color is true to the picture ( I ordered red for cosplay.) I would definitely recommend that you order half a size up because the toes are a little constricting.
4.0,"Good quality but surprised small size, good for kids under 7 but not for big kids."
4.0,"This was for my 5 year old Nephew. He was so excited that he asked me about the mail every day  and how many days left. The package arrived early by the way.The hat itself is a reasonably good quality knit cap. The winds are sewn on well. My only criticism is the (air) mechanism that makes the wings flap is kind of flimsy mine had to be manipulated before it was workable. The wings do flap, if not as well as the one on TV. My Nephew doesn't know that and is very happy with his Flipeez! That's all that counts right? I do want to get in a &#34;plug&#34; for the vendor. (Newbury Comics) There was a problem with shipping and the first one arrived damaged. I contacted them. Their response was immediate and their solution was to replace it without all the waiting for a return. I was impressed."
4.0,I’m 5’7” and 127 lbs - bought a medium & it was a little loose on me . I did like the adjustable tie at the top but it was a bit loose at the waist.
4.0,Cute head bands that I don't have to worry about falling off all three time. Metal makes them easy to put on and keep in place
4.0,"I have been wearing Grand River Jeans for a couple years and I like them a lot. They have enough give to be comfortable and they hold up well. I have never bought Khakis before, but they fit well, except that the legs are too long for us short guys, but they seem to be as well made as my Jeans are."
4.0,"I loved everything about this blouse except the loops that you fasten the buttons with.<br />The closure would be difficult for those with limitations in the hands, arms or shoulders without assistance."
4.0,I like sterling silver and these are a nice size and not too heavy.  I bought one for my sister and a pair for myself.  We both admired RBG.
4.0,Very cute but can't easily change battery when it stops
4.0,Good quality and nice shirt. Ran a little large.
4.0,while the waistcoat and pants were great I found the shirt to be a bit on the cheap side
4.0,I like the for over my glasses due to a recent health issue with my eyes . Only issue is the right lenses falls out on a occasion.
4.0,"But I'm returning both dresses , undecided if returning hair clip"
4.0,"I love this cover-up, but it’s a cardigan and not the same as the picture."
4.0,"This dress is a little heavy (material is heavy) and stitching is itchy but otherwise, it's a nice looking dress. Great for business casual work days. I would not use it as your daily summer dress as, like mentioned earlier, it's too heavy."
4.0,"Love these, the size, the rose gold but the stones are clear NOT pink as pictured so gave 4 stars instead of 5"
4.0,"It's so cute, it's not the same material in the picture which is a bummer, but the dress is still cute."
4.0,I ordered this belt but it cam in too small.  I ordered according to the chart but it was way too small still.  The quality was good and the pattern was neat.  I did order another belt but I a worried about the size again.<br />Pros:<br />Liked the design<br />looked nice<br />Built well<br /><br />Cons:<br />Too Small<br /><br />I did receive this Lecxci Men's Trinity 1 1/2&#34; Wide Leather Waist Belt with Nickel Single-prong Buckle at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I am very pleased with this purchase and will definitely suggest this to other people.<br /><br />Please click yes below if this review has been helpful
4.0,pretty good for the price. I just wanted something that was uv protected and these fit decent and the lenses aren't too heavy.
4.0,"Great value for the price!  Good quality material.  Note that these types of bras where the gore (the center part of the bra, where the two wires meet) is higher on your sternum tend to size one cup smaller than your normal size.  I recommend getting one cup larger for this type of bra."
4.0,"It's big and flares out at the bottom, but I mean, just look at it. It's great."
4.0,The earrings look and feel nice but the black faded and they are silver now.
4.0,"I loved this dress, got it for my sister in law n she looked very pretty in this dress. Just one thing that clothe gets wrinkled easily so u have to keep ironing it. But overall, It's very pretty."
4.0,"I’m 5’5’ and 177 lbs. I usually wear a size 8 in dresses. I ordered an XL and it was too tight and just barely covered my butt.  So I returned it for an XXL so I could move around comfy. It did feel itchy when trying it on. I think after washing it, it will be okay. It did look cute on and flattering to my body that is now heavier."
4.0,"Kinda hard to keep it as the perfect circle once you take it apart to put it on. Overall, it's a beautiful product."
4.0,My husband order an XL so go over several layers of clothes for hunting.  He usually wears a medium shirt.  This sweatshirt fits for what he was wanting but was slightly smaller then he expected.  He still likes and uses the sweatshirt though.
4.0,They are very cute and very lightweight..<br />Not expensively made.. But that's okay since I'm only going to be wearing them for Valentine's Day..
4.0,"I love this bathing suit!  If you're kind of heavy up top as I am then you will want to order an extra size up, it runs a little small or I would have given it five stars. It also has great support  which is hard to find a lot of times. I wear a 36 DDD and ordered a large but had to return or extra-large."
4.0,A nice seersucker suit ideal and elegant for casual and formal wear with a grey or pinstripe shirt.
4.0,Love the pattern and the zipper is good quality. Wish it was a little bit stretchier considering it’s supposed to be neoprene but it’s still nice. Great value for the $
4.0,"I like the cool look and the ability to open it w/ a button on the back.<br />It would be nicer if it won't stop fogging, though."
4.0,I bought these because my niece LOVES anything to do with the Eiffel Tower and France. She asked me to be her maid of honor so I am going to pass this out to the other bridesmaids. They are awfully cute :).
4.0,"good, basic sweatshirt.....plain, without pretense and just the way I like it"
4.0,"Really quality design. You can't quite tell from the pictures but every so often there's  a stylized bull in the pattern, but he fits in nicely. Have to return because it is too short. I assumed the sizes related to pants sizes, however I suppose they mean the exact measurement of the belt? It came an inch away from touching the other end around 41&#34; low waist/hips, so it definitely won't work even when the buckle is added."
4.0,"I ordered my first pair of these men's stud earrings in a brushed steel color and style, liked them so much that I grab this second pair in black. Like the first pair these are comfortable with a design inspired by the punk-era but with a very current, discreet look. The black is quite dramatic and really pops while framing and flattering the wearer's face. They're also sturdy and well-made. These are great accessory with casual, sporty wear."
4.0,"I thought this dress would look a little more high-end and hoped this would be a cute brunch dress. Don't get me wrong, it's fine for running errands or hanging out at home, but it's a pretty basic, thin (but not see-through) casual dress."
4.0,"Bigger than I expected, but still very nice bag,will use for work and festivals!!!"
4.0,Like the shirt. Material wasn’t as soft as I expected.
4.0,Great dress for the price. The flower is a different color than the dress i may just find another flower to replace it with
4.0,"It should have ears! Fit good, material is okay."
4.0,they are very stylish.  they are lightweight and feel great on my face.
4.0,"This is a great shirt for layering.  It is long and lightweight.  The one I got is white, and too sheer for me to wear alone.  But the straps are nice and wide to hide bra straps.  The product itself looks to be well put together....no hanging threads or holes.  If I were to order another I would order it 2 sizes larger than I would normally buy, because I do not like tight shirts.  I would also buy a darker color if I wanted to wear it as a top shirt. The material is really soft, which I love:)  I received this product at a free or reduced price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Seems sturdy enough and should keep one dry enough.
4.0,"Great skirt, nice material for the summer.  I am only 5'2"" so I knew it was going to be long on me but I just pull it up.  Plus this way it works depending on the size heel I am wearing.  I am a little disappointed in the color.  I ordered the olive and it is darker then the picture.  Other then that for the price it's terrific."
4.0,"These shorts fit nicely. The fabric is a bit like Lycra so not as wearable as shorts as some, but they have a comfortable, relaxed fit."
4.0,Would have liked more of a cotton feeling and shorter but will do. Good product
4.0,I think for the amount you are getting and for the price they do the job. Only one side has fabric on it so that is one down side. I also had one or two that didn’t work
4.0,They are cute socks but not seamless as stated
4.0,Basic costume and reasonable quality.
4.0,"Love it, simple and classy"
4.0,Great Belt but the elastic gets worn out very quickly.
4.0,"Tie was a bit thin, but socks are cute."
4.0,This was exactly what I expected. The product was perfect .
4.0,No actual support. Its a thin glorified sports bra with two mobile breast pad inserts. The lace cross straps are useless. Comfortable for first 5 mins. As I moved around it shifted and clasp were bothersome. Always have to adjust and straighten the bottom.
4.0,Works just fine for a plain visor cap
4.0,I really like this shirt and the sizing was correct:  Short sleeve!  Ordered long sleeve although I am pleased with the product.
4.0,"Pretty dress, but for anyone with a larger busy, the sides come in quite a bit and it’s hard to keep em covered fully."
4.0,Hard to store with non colaspsable head
4.0,Definitely the real deal love the weight of the watch
4.0,"a bit narrow, but looses over time. comfy fit now"
4.0,These are cute and keep your feet toasty.  There are two issues: the Medium is a bit tight for the top of the size range and there is no support in the bottom of these &#34;slippers&#34;. They are not actually slippers.  They are built like low socks. AND we have not washed them yet so hopefully they won't shrink. But on the bright side they are very warm and the nubbies on the bottom do make them non-slip.
4.0,Wasn't as soft as I had hoped but it did the trick
4.0,"This blouse is very nice, but it fits tighter across the bust line."
4.0,"I love everything about this dress - except the length.  The pattern is beautiful, the material is soft. The pockets are well constructed and don’t show and less you are using them, and it’s very flattering. I just wish it wasn’t so short. I’m keeping it and love wearing it around the house or to the beach, but it’s too short for work."
4.0,"nice jeans, would buy again"
4.0,"Looks exactly like the picture, but it definitely wouldn't protect your phone if you happen to drop it!"
4.0,"I am very hard on jewelry so I never buy 14 k gold chains..only 10k for the durability. Any chain can break if you get something caught in it and pull...ex hair brush, or a child pulling on it.  I never take mine off. I have had it for a few months and it looks great. When, not IF, I break it..I will buy another just like it.  Very good buy."
4.0,"The quality of the photo isnt exactly what is shown in the video but its not bad either. Still going to keep this and I really enjoy it, but theres only so much you can expect from something like this."
4.0,Not bad. Maybe a bit small. Works for the summer
4.0,"This is a great little cardigan, it's not quite as long on me as on the model but I am both significantly fatter and very long waisted so that may not be an error and likely is just my body.<br /><br />The buttons are well secured, the seams are well sewn with no significant loose threads. The fabric is not particularly soft, I'd say it's more like a starched t-shirt material even after washing. It is otherwise quite comfortable and will likely be a staple of my office wear for late summer/early fall."
4.0,"I have a very hard time with dresses, but took a chance and i'm glad I did.  This is a very comfortable, flattering dress.  The waistline is similar to a skater dress (just lower than an empire waist).  One star off because the fabric/color does not match the picture.  It looks like a heathered fabric, but is just a solid.  It's still really nice, especially for the price.  I feel like you'd see dresses like this in Target with a higher price tag.  The fabric is really soft and I absolutely love the pocket placement.  I'm 5'4"", 145lbs, 30DDD bust and found the small to be a great fit.  I would consider myself more of a pear shape.  I definitely feel like the M would have been too big."
4.0,"This watch is great for everyday wear. I had to ask my husband to help me with the sizing of the band. It wasn’t easy like the directions said.<br />Once it was sized to for my wrist it fit perfect.<br />I would love for this to be smaller and made for women instead of unisex.<br />But, it’s taken a beating and continues to work!"
4.0,"Nice color.<br />Seems like decent quality.<br />Bought as a gift.<br />I didn’t actually get out a tape measure, I just looked at the pack online, assumed it’d be the size of other packs I’ve seen- wow. It is huge.<br />Not a deal breaker. It’s just much bigger than it looks, and that’s with it not even filled with stuff.<br />Still gifted it to its intended giftee for Christmas. She seemed to like it."
4.0,I like it a lot!! I hope it holds up well!
4.0,"The T.Shirts are OK, I noticed that some of them faded a little when I rinsed them out. Not the best of quality but overall they are good for the price."
4.0,Super cute and fits well. However the band comes undone from the watch itself very easily. I'm scared I may lose it.
4.0,"I loved the pants but for some reason one pair was way to small. I ordered 2 pair black and green, size large. The black ones fit perfectly but the green were super tight. Sent the green back. Easy stress free return and refund."
4.0,"I got nothing but compliments all day! Although a little small it is a stretchy material so it fit great! It is long enough to wear to work and just so comfortable to be in. The rating is only 4 stars because after the first time wearing it I found a hole in the underarm area. Nothing I can't fix, I just shouldn't have to."
4.0,"My daughter and I love the leotard and I would give it a 5 star but I feel their sizing is not clear. I order what I thought would have been her size and it was too big. I had to return for a smaller size. If the manufacturer made their sizing clearer, I would change to a 5 star."
4.0,It's my perfect addition in summer clothing. Big box pockets everywhere and it so easy to wear. I love the design and I guess I will order other shorts from same brand again. Worth it 😊😊😊
4.0,I like it and it makes me look smaller
4.0,They look good and the size fits but  I read other reviews and it is true they are a bit tight in the toe area.
4.0,"Fit is good, quality is good and shipping was prompt."
4.0,It wad just what my daughter  wanted.
4.0,"These earrings are smaller than they look but still very nice, I bought these for my daughter who loves lapis."
4.0,"While using my hair remover laser that shoots are bright lights, it does the job thus far."
4.0,"Super comfortable, great support, i just wish the neckline plunged a little lower so i can wear with more lower-cut tops"
4.0,"Decent but fairly heavy, I wouldn't carry it if I had to have the bag on my person for a long time."
4.0,Necklaces are great. 4 star only because i had a reaction to the chain so i exchanged it out for an already existing chain i had.
4.0,Looks very nice.Fits good
4.0,Soft rubber with good fit
4.0,Beautiful but smaller than it appears. I did NOT pull out a measuring tape before ordering.
4.0,I wish the waist bad suppressed my tummy more but they fit pretty well and don’t look bad. But probably won’t order again
4.0,"It’s a beautiful shoe, but hard to buckle."
4.0,"Great value for the $, the product is also very comfortable & durable. I plan to purchase many more."
4.0,One of socks rolls down.
4.0,Too cute. Large men's was a large men's.
4.0,Amazing beanie.😄
4.0,"Overall very good product. It's very comfortable to wear and, bonus, it has pockets."
4.0,It is a beautiful ring and very well made. It has a nice weight to it and looks good with everything.The only problem is I didn't realize how big it was  going to be. It's a huge ring. Very bold... but beautiful!
4.0,Love it.  I ordered a large after reviews and it is a little big in the thigh area.  I am 118 and 5'2.  After washing it is a little too short
4.0,"Bought these to use fat biking in the winter. They are so comfortable and warm that they've become my go-to winter boot. The fit is good and the faux-fur lining feels really nice. These are water resistant, not waterproof, but do a really good job in the snow. My feet have only gotten wet once, and that time I was standing in a puddle that came halfway up the boot for almost an hour while filming. My only complaint about these boots is that the sole in rather soft and pliable. This is great for freedom of movement when you're riding or running around, but not great if you're walking in on really uneven or sharp surfaces because you start to feel every little thing on the bottom of your foot.<br /><br />Pro:<br />*Comfortable<br />*Warm<br />*Water-resistant<br />*Good grip<br /><br />Cons<br />*Soft sole"
4.0,Sheds but otherwise good
4.0,"This is a very fun toy!Although they should have put in more parts and sometimes it may not be very durable,and they should have put in some more blade colors and if possible a brighter light.Other than that me and my 11 year old son and I had some fun making our own lightsaber and dueling eachother.Also the sounds may have been better.OH and did I mention how fun this was?Well it is very fun I recomend wait let me rephrase that I HIGHLEY recomnd you buy this it s worth is but buy it at fredmyer or somen cause seriously $35 isnt worth it.But buy it you'll have lots of fun"
4.0,"Its a very nice sweater, well made, and in no way thin, or cheaply made.The Large  felt too snug. I gave it to my daughter. I may reorder the XLarge at a later date"
4.0,Very comfortable pair of pajamas. They are soft and light and can be used in fair and cold weather. I love them so much I purchased another two sets
4.0,"Runs a bit small.  The material is warm.  Halloween was about 20 degrees out, had the baby wear a one piece under and she did not seem cold.  Great buy, good shipping time considering events at the time."
4.0,The leather is very hard and seems to be leatherette. But my son wanted them and he likes them.
4.0,I got this as a gift for Christmas. I got a large and it fits my body but the bottom of the hoodie is tight so its hard to take off and on. The arm pit area is a little snug as well.  I love love the design and overall look of it.
4.0,These are really cute and a great price.
4.0,Bought this for my niece for Christmas. Great price and she absolutely LOVED it=) The picture does not do it justice.
4.0,"The sleeves are a bit tight, but the length of the sleeves and sweater is good.  Thickness is a nice weight, but not too heavy.  Love the color!  Bright but no too bright."
4.0,"Stitching on the bottom of the pant leg is not the best, material is thin, and the waste band is a little tight. I ordered a small, but I’ve probably been eating too many French fries during quarantine.<br />I love the pint and the style of the wide leg. I think if I sized up they might be too big."
4.0,They are very cute but I would have worn these more in a different material. The silk is nice but it’s a cheap silk
4.0,Product fit as expected. It doesn't have the the crotch zipper. As explained in the description!
4.0,I've had these a couple months now & they are very comfortable. I would've rather the cream colored belt been brown but I knew that before I ordered. Nice elastic belt.
4.0,These are so very cute! The only thing about them that my daughter has been complaining about is the button you click to change the colors is right on the inside by the tongue and she's complained that it hurts her. Other than that they're very cute. They do run smaller. My daughter is a size toddler 9 so I ordered a 10. Her toe is right at the end of the shoe practically.
4.0,A little tight in chest but overall fits good and is keeps you warm.
4.0,Cute as can be. I wish it would have come in the mail not bent. Then I would have give it a perfect score.
4.0,I do not do review But I will give one if they wore leather I would a 5 stars over all very nice my style
4.0,These are alright. Once you wash them they kind of become scrunchy and may need to iron. Its expected because its pure cotton. Otherwise they do the job.
4.0,"Not as fitting as I expected, I expected them to be a little more supporting in the arch area, they are very comfortable and I ran a half marathon in them with no issues so they worked great."
4.0,"Just put it on and wore it  today and so far so good. The band is the kind that does nit crack, fall apart, break...whuch is why I cose it, and the face is simple.I love the color of the band, a pale greenish blue, almost grey..."
4.0,Very cute dress ! I'm 5 3&quot; and 137 lb and a medium worked perfectly.  It's a little long from the bottom past my knees but other than that it's great .
4.0,Beautiful item. Made of a sheer soft material (not see thru though).
4.0,If you have cold hands these are the mittens for you. Attractive and very warm in even the coldest weather.
4.0,"Love these.... I probably needed a bigger size since they don’t reach my waist, but the pattern and fabric are great!"
4.0,"These Wolverine claws fit pretty well. There's a slight gap where the tops of the claws don't meet the knuckles of my closed hand, but this is acceptable to me—as too much of a tight fit might cause pressure and discomfort. I like how the handle is designed closer to the claws (unlike other designs on the market), thereby allowing me to grasp the claws closer to the blades—recreating a more authentic look. The blades are made of lightweight plastic, and are pretty resilient to use so far; I've had no issues with them being loose or coming off. These claws are nicely assembled, and they feel comfortable to hold. If you're looking for a decent set of Wolverwine claws, these are the ones to get in my opinion."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:ff124188f98f04c916021e9696d48553]] I received all 12 ankle bracelets which was in good condition except one of the beads was off of one of them. No problem I just hooked it back on. 👍🏼
4.0,"Fit myself and my 7 year old daughter well, however if you have long hair it's VERY difficult to get all your hair in the cap. Also no holes in ear area and can't hear a lick with the mask on. Otherwise, a good looking mask<br />The pickier is of my average size 7 year old"
4.0,"This dress would be great except the shoulder straps are very plain and don't seem like the belong with the rest of the dress, and in my opinion really hampers it from being able to be considered a formal dress. Otherwise its very nice. I'm 5'3"" and 125lb, the small fit perfectly and was a perfect length."
4.0,Love the style and length
4.0,This is my first rash guard and I will buy more.  The color and design are very nice.  I bought a size up because I kept hearing they are tight but once in the water it loosens up quite a bit. It was nice swimming and not having my arms burnt.
4.0,The shirt was a little large in the breast and armhole area...but if it we're smaller I'm afraid it would be too short.  Just a strange cut.  I do like the shirt..I just put a vest or jacket over it!
4.0,"Cute bathing suit, good quality for what you pay. The only thing I don't like is how round the cups inside are."
4.0,good product for a good price.
4.0,Very satisfied with the fit.
4.0,"Cute product! Not sure why people are complaining about quality... I mean, it's an $8 purse 😂 The stitching isn't perfect but is close enough, and it does have a little smell (as others have stated). Works perfect for a one night event. It's not anything fancy but will work for an event that requires one. My only real complaint is that it's pretty big for a clutch. Plenty of room to hold things though!"
4.0,Cool dress. A little bit in the waist but overall good product.
4.0,Great look....Too narrow
4.0,"fit great, but shrunk a bit when washed"
4.0,All good just wish the cuff was water proof as well. I end up getting water in them because the cuff or white part isn't water resistant or proof. Only downfall I found.
4.0,I like to wear them everywhere however after coming out of the shower with wet feet and then walking down some hardwood stairs my foot slipped forward pushing the flipflop backward and almost caused me to tumble down. so while they are great in general they can be slippery so be careful
4.0,"a bit big, but still great"
4.0,"Super comfy, not expecting to last quality wise but that's okay. Can wear out then climb into bed in comfort, I get compliments everytime I wear it out."
4.0,Shirt seems to run larger  than I expected.
4.0,"I'm 5'6 and 115lbs and a Small fit perfectly! Very cute! My only complaint is that the top isn't adjustable, and it's a bit loose, so I may have to try and take it in myself."
4.0,I'm happy with the perchance
4.0,"Great product. However, they were a bit tight on my Steve Madden pumps that I cant seem to get them off!"
4.0,"the color isn't as nice in person as it is online. it looks more like the john deere green in real life. decent quality sweatshirt, would probably recommend getting another color."
4.0,"A very nice simple symbol of my love of the water ,  boating  and past military service .Good heft and well made .  Tom"
4.0,"Great product and quality, seemed a little small.  They were tighter than expected but clothes have such variations in sizes they are hard to buy online sometimes."
4.0,The material is a little thin so you will need to wear a camisole underneath. Otherwise not a bad shirt. I ordered a size up and it fits good.
4.0,Like a lot especially the color.
4.0,I am 5.1 and 140 and got small which was too small for me. But it looked really cute so I ordered medium.
4.0,"Theses are excatally as described- I do feel over time they will stretch easily, will see how they do after a wash- I think best to wash and lay flat to dry."
4.0,"Received item on time.. Satisfied with item, material and product. A little bit loose for my size but not a big problem."
4.0,Good quality but snug. Order a size up
4.0,"I really like the material because it's soft and slinky.  The Skirt Sports skirts I have are more stiff.  If you wanted this for jogging or other dynamic sport, you might want to wear shorts underneath to prevent rubbing because these shorts won't stay put."
4.0,"Bought for an early Christmas gift, wife really liked.. I've purchased pajamas from pajamagram the last three years and they're always high quality.. shorts were a good length too, not too short or long."
4.0,These were a hit with the kids at Christmas. Fun little *extra* to add to the festivities of the day.
4.0,Firstly I like that the straps are long. One of the things I hate about the Fjallraven Kanken brand is that the straps are short on the mini backpacks. The straps on this bag seem a little flimsy but only time will tell. My biggest disappointment was that the little pocket in the back doesn’t hold my iPhone 12 Pro Max. So I’ll just be using it for my wallet and keys I guess. I would’ve liked to put it there for easy access but oh well. I really didn’t think that my iPad Pro 11  would fit in the back sleeve pocket but surprisingly it does! The inside pockets are great for organization and the overall construction of the bag seems well made. I’m a little I unsure about the straps but the bag itself seems sturdy and surprisingly roomie. This is a great bag for those who like to wear backpacks as purses or need to carry a few more things with them than a normal purse could hold.
4.0,Took for ever to get and about a week later the leathered rope snapped ad it doesn’t glow in the dark at all.
4.0,Great bra's and great price.
4.0,Granddaughter love them and wore them for her school Xmas show . She was happy it didn’t hurt her like other shoes.
4.0,"As a mother of a daughter who is always in the 5th%tile for weight, I always read reviews in search of small-running ballet leotards to fit my daughter. She is three years old and the 2-4, shockingly, fits her somewhat small (lengthwise). It is our favorite leotard because it is thick, soft, lined, and the perfect stretch (all these being big bonuses because my daughter has sensory issues). It looks absolutely adorable on!<br />Ours came with a weird black mark on the chest (hardly noticeable - like a sticker was once there and the black fuzz won't go away). But it's hardly noticeable and because it's her favorite go-to for dance days we live with it."
4.0,Good belt for a low price. It comes in different colors.It comes with a belt hole punch needed for sizing.<br />I don't believe this belt is leather. I would buy this product again .<br />I hope you found this review helpful.
4.0,Not quite as pictured. The tassel part is shorter than the pic but still cute
4.0,Very comfortable. I wore it as a workout shirt. I will try it out under my Sheriff's Office uniform soon. My only complaint is the red stitching is a bit irritating and itchy at first. I stopped noticing it after a while but it was still an issue. The TM-R13-Blk Tesla compression shirt is better than this one.
4.0,Colors sent to me were... not good. But they're comfortable and make a fine bra substitute in hot weather.
4.0,"I liked it so much that I just bought another one.  The sterling silver is super shiny.  The only thing about this necklace it that the one I bought which is the 24 inch one, looks smaller than 24 inches.  I thought the length was going to be bigger.  Did not matter too much though, obviously, because I bought it again!  I would recommend it to people."
4.0,This product us worth the price. I am a professional driver.  There are worth the price
4.0,It's not the most flattering skater skirt I've ever worn. But it's pretty!
4.0,I love how it fits and how it feels. I had to order one size up after reading some reviews and it was a good choice.
4.0,Order a size up..There also thin but my kids love them☺
4.0,The size is too small and not easy to keep it on . Keep in mind that I have very very short hair
4.0,Nice I have to order more
4.0,Liked it but really would have liked to been able to have a colored pillowcase with a colored initial also but still liked it
4.0,"I was hoping to buy a new band to use my watch on more formal occassions but I was hesitant to get a new watch band because of reviews I read from other brands, but this seemed to be the best reviewed. It was a good choice. I've used it three times already where I've even danced or ran and my watch never fell nor I had any issues with the buckle. Just make sure to hear a click when exchanging the bands for it to adjust and avoid any accidents as I've read on other reviews. Also, the band comes with a mini kit to adjust the size by removing links by yourself."
4.0,bought for sister for gift. She enjoyed them. A little pricey but you can't just find good piggie socks anywhere. I guess it was worth it.
4.0,Clicker is big. Hard to take off super easy to put on.
4.0,Nice quality does fit a little weird but my daughter does like it. Fits as expected
4.0,"The dress is really cute, but it is a bit snug on the rib area, maybe just my body type. The skirt is a stiffer material (washed once, may soften more after more washes), while the bodice is stretchy. I'm gonna be wearing it with a sweater."
4.0,They are adorable and perfect for what I need them for. The only negative thing I have to say is that I was shorted two bears. 78/80 bears when I paid for 80.... and the ones I’m missing are different colors so I can’t make earrings with them.
4.0,Love it. Feels more like a headband than a hat on my head!!
4.0,I received the watch quickly and exactly as described. It's very beautiful and i get many compliments on it. My only complaint is it cannot get wet at all. I have to slide it up or take it off to wash my hands so I don't ruin it.
4.0,They look great and fit very well. Didnt want to tighten the lace's yet however. But overall look great!
4.0,"A slightly larger filter would be great. The carbon does eliminate odors, walked into an area that smelled heavily of thyme, didn't notice it until I removed my mask. Warm in NC summers, but breathability is great."
4.0,These glasses are a good value and are comfortable.  They look wavy if worn part way up your nose which I tend to do as I need them to read but not to see further out.
4.0,"If you like a money clip, but need to carry ID and an a few essential debit and/or credit cards, this is the product for you.  The leather is extremely soft and pliable and the wallet is extremely slim.  The money clip has just the right tension to keep your bills secure.  The ID pocket allows you to easily display your ID when needed.  The five card slots are just enough for your essentials.  The wallet is RFID blocking for your security.  The wallet comes nicely gift boxed for gift-giving.  I would definitely recommend this wallet."
4.0,I wear size 5-6. Ordered size medium and they fit ok. Soft and comfortable. Waistband doesn't roll.
4.0,"I was looking for blue light blocking glasses that weren't overly expensive - I have three monitors at work, one of which is ~40"" TV, so I was getting very bad headaches. I ordered these and they helped almost immediately. I can definitely see a difference in using them all day or using them sporadically. My two complaints are: 1- the lenses are cheaper (obviously) so sometimes they're not super clear, but you get used to that. 2- the frames already cracked. They're either on my face, desk, or head and don't go through anything rough, but right under the left nose piece there's a crack.  I'm still using them and I'll super glue them eventually, but overall they're great and definitely worth it."
4.0,So cute just wish chain was longer and better quality.
4.0,"This is a lovely top. The fabric isn’t as soft or comfortable as I’d hoped, but since I’ll be wearing it with skirts for a dressier look I’m not as bothered by that. It fits well, though I do foresee fidgeting a bit to keep it in place and to keep the flowing quality looking nice. The colour is a bit closer to mustard than I’d expected, but it’s still attractive and will compliment many of my skirts."
4.0,Great looking bars and even better when they are engraved. One down fall was they are super tight when brand new. Takes a little effort to get it on by yourself. But all in all a great pick-up
4.0,"Super thin fabric! But very very cute! I recommend this item for kids between newborn to about 4. The colors are beautiful and it's perfect. I think this would go good on a hot summer day going to the beach or just out and about, definitely will keep your kid cool."
4.0,"Shoulder area is transperent than how it appears in pictures. Great dress for price, and perhaps for teens, just not my wife’s taste- so had to return."
4.0,This actually fits and looks super cute. The color is nice and the fringe is actually pretty good quality. Only weird thing was the way it smelled when it showed up. Like it'd been soaked in incense - not pleasant. Had to wash it. But now I love it. Worth it.
4.0,Beautiful style and lightweight fabric.
4.0,Very satisfied with the quality of this product.
4.0,"This band is comfortable.  It's not the best fit for my wrist, I have to use the last hole because I have a very small wrist and it's a bit too snug but the 2nd to last hole is too loose.  It is a nice soft band though."
4.0,I purchased these during a PIF event from a friends' wishlist. She was pleased to get them. Shipping was a bit slow but otherwise very pleased with my purchase.
4.0,Got lots of compliments. It is see through so you will need to wear something under.
4.0,"The fitting is just a little tight. Still doable and enough of a push to workout harder (lol) and at some point, after a couple of month of use, I don't know if the fit became more comfortable because of stretching or because of dropping half a size. The pants feel comfortable, rain or shine, wet or dry, and the price is just right. I am very happy with this."
4.0,So! I really did love it! A week from wearing it. It did  change to A weird color than I was like for the  Price wasn’t bad I purchase the baby pink than it broke on me but I think I am  willing to purchase from them again
4.0,"The child who wears these will love them! The reason to buy these is for the novelty of them. However, if you're looking for a practical sneaker, don't buy these. Can't be worn in the rain and I doubt they will last a long time."
4.0,"Great spout, love the opening at top to clean or fill. Made of sturdy material great for camping or boating."
4.0,"I read the reviews and am happy that I ordered a medium, normally I need a small.<br /><br />I am happy with the long length and they do have an interesting smell, I did not think it was bad.<br /><br />Hands were a WEE bit sweaty after having them on for an hours cleaning up, but it's a fine trade for these being biodegradable, and they come in a recyclable box with no plastic packaging, thank you for that too.<br /><br />They seem very durable, thicker than the cheap-o ones that always seem to break after a few uses."
4.0,Much smaller than expected.  Pretty gift for my 10 yr old though
4.0,"Wore this under a costume for Halloween, it fits great and definitely served the purpose. However, it is very challenging to use the restroom. I had to cut the suit to save time"
4.0,This runs a little big
4.0,"Love the top, fabric is very nice.  I normally wear an XL but this seems to run small."
4.0,Cute dress fits just right.
4.0,VERY SEE THROUGH and hardly stays on unless you loop the toes through the shoulder straps.
4.0,good good watch band
4.0,I recommend you size up one or two sizes. I did size up one and really needed to size up two sizes to be comfortable in these.
4.0,"Would have given 5 stars, but the tool to remove links knocked it down a notch. Was able to remove all necessary links just had to be very gentle with the tool itself. Great looking band changed the entire look of my Fenix 6!!"
4.0,"Nice looking, attention getter"
4.0,Fits a little snug. But it's a good material and it's a good make. I am usually an ex small so I got an ex small but just should've gotten a small or a med. But I still wear it to work. The material it's made out of allows it to stretch a little bit. :)
4.0,"Really nice, only reason I gave it four stars is that the sleeve doesn’t seem to be so perfect but overall it’s ok."
4.0,"I did wear this for my wedding, I loved the length and trim detail. It did take a long time to steam out all of the wrinkles from transit but that is my only complaint. It looks very high quality, and for only wearing one day - nobody will know the difference. :)"
4.0,"Good shirt for layering, perhaps a little thin but I put on a cami underneath and it's fine."
4.0,"Amazing! Beautifully stitched together, but the bulky battery in the back pocket is annoying especially when driving in a car or sitting down. Otherwise it’s incredible. Love the three heat settings."
4.0,"After using these gloves for a week I would say they are pretty average. They work well as far as cleaning kitchen and bathrooms, however, using the scrubby side to wash dishes still left a residue. I used these specifically to wash my son’s milk bottles and it seemed like they still felt greasy after scrubbing with hot water and dish soap. I had to go back over them with a different dish scrubber. For my household needs, these are not a product I would purchase again but they may work well for someone else."
4.0,Very soft and comfortable to wear.<br />Not in love with the color….kind of a cement grey with a slight green hue
4.0,Good for- as described
4.0,"They are a good height on my foot ankle. I purchased this item in October, it's now March. I wear a pair of these every day and almost every sock has a run of some sort in it by now, but I suppose that's going to happen with nylon anything. The price point is good and I will reorder these eventually."
4.0,Definitely better than expected!!! Nice quality shirt
4.0,"I like everything about these earrings except for the fact that they fall out too easily. I don't wear them often because of this.<br />The ear wire is a bit too thick for a standard clear back, so I'm at a loss for a solution."
4.0,"I loved this dress and it fit the body perfectly.  The only reason that I returned it was because of the capped sleeves.  I'm a bit broad in the shoulders, so it didn't lay right.  Otherwise, the material is very good quality, great length, and the split was not too high.  I wished this came in a sleeveless or 3/4 length sleeve."
4.0,"Cute fit, good quality but I wasn’t a fan of the puff sleeve in me so I returned"
4.0,China alike
4.0,"As you can see I looked cute! It looks good with a jacket,  took me from day to evening.  Very versatile. The belt went in the trash right away."
4.0,Wife loves them says there super soft.
4.0,The inner sole makes it feel bare needs a little  more padding
4.0,Awesome pants fit true to size.
4.0,"If you want a cheap gi that fits decently than these are for you! they fit a bit big, but nothing too crazy. Overall its a good gi for when you're just starting, need a regular training gi, or just needing something good for the wallet."
4.0,Am sad the paw print does not glow in the dark as described but overall looks and feels nice. Is a bit larger than expected but still fits well.
4.0,"So far no problems with the piece but have not had it long enough to know if it will tarnish, appears to be of a decent metal comfortable to wear and looks beautiful."
4.0,"My friend kept trying to convince me to let her wear this belt because she loved it so much. It looks especially good riding low, on my hips. My only complaint is that where the rings connect there is tarnish that is visible if the rings spin and shift out of position. Other than that, I like it. Solid purchase."
4.0,I like the look of this wallet quite a bit. There is a bit of stiffness with the material and it tends to stick together. Though I feel after a few more weeks it will feel more natural.
4.0,Metal lace loops scratched up my tunnel.
4.0,"Love the lights on the hat. The only thing I dont like is the controller, it slides around in there and the on-off button can be hard to find at times. Other than that, the hat is awesome. I love the lights on it!!!"
4.0,"I want to thank the company for their speedy delivery. My daughter's love their dance outfit, They wear all the time"
4.0,"Very nice love the design, good quality and fits perfectly on my iwatch the only thing is that the strap is small and it nearly fits and doesn't leave much end at the end. Overall very nice"
4.0,The ring is very cute and is top quality.  It was just a tad bit too big.  Received very quickly and am happy with my purchase.
4.0,"Cute, good value. My 15 yr old stole them from me..."
4.0,"Great value for the 3 pieces. Bought this for my costume. I did have to put a new, longer piece of chain on the choker because mine was bent and the chain needed to be another inch-2 inches longer so it would look right. I wish amazon didn’t ship it in a padded envelope because the ring is really bent. I tried to fix it the best I could."
4.0,Stunning. High quality and beautiful craftsmanship! I'd give it 5 stars but I struggled to remove the wrinkles. The whole top part of the dress is a stretchy lace material and the bottom half of the dress is quite thick and rather heavy which made hanging the dress (to dewrinkle) worrysome as I was afraid the lace might rip. I will add that I NEVER iron anything so it's possible that I was going about things wrong. I usually just throw things in the dryer to dewrinkle.
4.0,"The scrub hat is very comfortable and thick enough to protect my hair from breakage from the N95 mask (rubber bands) I have to wear in the ER.  Also,  the flamingo pattern is adorable."
4.0,A little smaller than I anticipated. Beautiful earrings.
4.0,"The only reason I don't give this a 5/5 is that they aren't truly stone as far as I can tell.  They are stone-like, but they definitely don't have the weight of solid stone.  For some people that might be a plus, but I would kind of prefer them a little more solid feeling.  But they definitely aren't acrylic because my ears don't react to them (I'm allergic).<br /><br />The other slightly odd thing, is they aren't terribly deep.  Luckily my ear lobes aren't super thick, but they sit pretty flush to my skin.  I like when they flare past the skin a bit more so that they might be a little more secure.  These have knocked out of my ears a couple times where other double flared ones haven't.<br /><br />Overall a good purchase and a great price for a wonderful variety.  They are super pretty!"
4.0,It started to peel on me
4.0,Mediums fit me nicely. The black pair was somewhat tighter than the navy pair. Very comfortable and i love the side pockets!
4.0,"The purse looks exactly as pictured but I didn't get the chain. I really don't like holding purses in my hand. So i had planned on wearing it cross way or over the shoulder. I have a Christmas ball party for work coming up on 12-17-16 and I will attempt to hold it. I'm just so forgetful and think I will accidentally put it down somewhere. The purse is lovely, I just really wanted the chain to come with it!"
4.0,"The thickness is just right, soft cotton sock. Had one sock with elastic loose when I opened them but not worth returning one sock. Pretty colors too. I wore them twice, really like the fit."
4.0,wearing well and is what was expected.  The zipper on this one better then older versions.
4.0,Not as good I thought it would be
4.0,I would recommend ordering the size you normally wear.  The review said order 2 sizes up and it was way<br />to large.  I returned it as I didn't see the option of replacing it.  I would have.
4.0,very cute and I would recommend to others
4.0,These sunglasses are great I just got them in today and they look fantastic and it even comes with a really nice case that you can clip to your belt loop. The only reason why I give it 4 star instead of 5 star is because they sent me the wrong pair. The frame and lens are brown when i order the silver frame with grey lens
4.0,SUPER CUTE. I wish they had 0.00 magnification though. I don't need prescription but i love wearing the frames as an accessory.
4.0,Was ok but little small
4.0,The anchor is a bit heavy for a cartilage earring.
4.0,So far so good. I have not wash it yet so I can't confirm whether its going to decolorate.
4.0,"So, these are interesting boxer briefs. Now, I fully admit I’m not an expert in the boxer brief world, but these have a lot going for them:<br /><br />1.) Lightweight without being flimsy.<br />2.) Comfortable and soft.<br />3.) Fit me well without being tight around my thighs (your mileage may of course vary here).<br /><br />Now, there’s just one rather glaring problem - for me, and it’s the reason I don’t wear these during the day: There’s no fly. I don’t even recall the last time I saw a pair of boxers without a fly. But here you go, folks.<br /><br />So why 4 stars (well, 3.5 stars)? Well, I like to wear a clean pair of boxers before bed. And if I’m not wearing trousers, the lack of fly isn’t really a big deal if I need to be excused in the middle of the night or first thing in the morning. The trade-off is totally worth it.<br /><br />So there you go. These are great for sleeping in, because they’re super comfortable. During the day, though? No thank you.<br /><br />3.5 stars out of 5. Not for everyone, but I love to sleep in these."
4.0,Well fitting
4.0,"I love the feel and drape of this fabric.  It has held up very well to washing and drying.  However, I would not recommend it for yoga unless you want to show off your bra."
4.0,"I like the wallet, but for the price they are asking for it I don't feel like it stands apart from my wallet that I got for 25 bucks.  It's larger than I expected. It has two cash holder slots,  eight card slot holders, two inside pockets, and a removable ID carrying case.  There is an internal pocket that you can slide the ID holder into that keeps it in place.  It's functionable and keeps your wallet organized.  Other than the full retail price I feel like it's a nice wallet.  I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"Very cute, lots of room<br />Quality not as expected"
4.0,I love the design but I wish they had it in a more larger size if you are tall then it will look pretty small.. still I love it! Probably I will get another one if they make it more larger!!
4.0,"Great dress with pockets! Fun, full skirt that is very comfortable to wear. One less star because the fabric is a little rough on the skirt and the waist is a little too high.  If they elongated the torso part it would be awesome."
4.0,"I bought the white dress in size 12 for my 13 year old (4' 10"" just under 70 lbs, very small build).  The quality wasn't the best but was absolutely good enough for a nice dress to wear for dinners on vacation.  I really wish they would not send the cheap junk jewelry with this brand because that just goes straight to the trash.  The junk pineapple necklace is completely unwearable.<br /><br />The straps are adjustable but the rings and adjuster pieces are kind of cheap plastic so not sure how long they will last.  The fit was great and she looked and felt very pretty in this dress.  For a kiddo that is very small for her size, it was such an amazing thing to find something that wasn't too young for her in her size."
4.0,"Really cute designs and high quality, however the top isn’t tight to my nose so it digs up my glasses, wish they had the strip at the top to frame it for your nose."
4.0,Nicely made. It is very pretty on.
4.0,Great bag; roomy so great to use for work.  Nice soft leather.  I wish it came in a navy blue!
4.0,Worked as a nice gift
4.0,Can't beat 'em for the price.
4.0,It is comfortable and convenient.I use it as slippers every day at home.
4.0,brim larger than in pics.  But customer service tries to work with you.
4.0,Good compression. A lot shorter than I expected them to be. If you have a long torso like me these are not your best bet.
4.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE! This is one of my favorite purchased ever!! It is super cute and elegant. Just be warned it is a little flimsy, it ended up breaking off from the piercing but I managed to fix it onto another on and it still work perfectly."
4.0,Great socks.  They rarely fall down and are super comfortable.
4.0,These run small. They are nice boxers and have a nice feel to them.<br />I did ask for certain colors and did not get them but oh well.
4.0,The teacher liked it
4.0,Gave this as a gift. Recipient was impressed. Well made!
4.0,The battery was bad when I received it
4.0,We have a pool so I switch off from 3 different kinds. I find these comfortable but a bit snug
4.0,Pretty and comfortable.  Seemed just a little large around the top.
4.0,Little on the small side-maybe consider next size up
4.0,"Love the lever back.  Good quality, great price. A nice gift for a Cancer birthday girl."
4.0,The hat is a little lighter weight than I expected but is very comfortable and warm. It is more comfortable to wear with the ear flaps down. When folded up into hat it feels like a lot of stuff on top of your head but not uncomfortable. Very happy overall.
4.0,They're pretty typical of diabetic socks.  They're comfortable but the tops don't really stay up.
4.0,"[[ASIN:B01N1G9JDL Dragon Ball Z Capsule Corp Trunks Military Style Adult Zip Hoodie (Large), Purple]] This jacket fit my son perfectly. It is soft and comfortable. Sizes run just right. Not too big or too small. The color is nice and bright."
4.0,"Pretty fabric, nice cut, but I'm not wearing this outside of the house as anything but a bathing suit cover up. So much cleavage I'd have to wear a plunge bra to make it work. It's sexy, though..."
4.0,I love the color!!! It is my favorite part. The fabric is nice and light and I like the texture of it.
4.0,Very comfortable to wear and easy care
4.0,I measured one of my daughter’s shirts from armpit to armpit like suggested and thankfully so as it suggested an XS for my 10 year old daughter who wears a size 8 (must be juniors sizing not girls). This is a belly shirt though which isn’t advertised. I paired it with a white tank top (not included) and it looks super cute!
4.0,These foldable ballet shoes fit perfectly into my evening purse. I thought it was a very good purchase and really saved my feet after wearing formal strappy heels the entire night.
4.0,Bought this for my daughter to wear over her costume at dance competitions. Lightweight and fit as expected.
4.0,"Good work watch. No frills. Backlight, however, doesn't light ip the time, just a little bit of the side it's on."
4.0,"Let me begin by saying I love this color and I got plenty of compliments on it. The dress is very form fitting, so unfortunately the bottom I am not to pleased with but that is fault of my own. This dress is great for parties and events where the weather is hot. Spanx must be worn or make sure you wear panties that are not too tight because it will show. For a bra you need either a bandeau or a clear straps, cause it will look tacky if not  Otherwise the fit is just right, I ordered a size 8 but I am usually a 10-14 so I either lost weight or I am not sure. Some brands do that. So I would suggest not ordering higher than your average cause that will be too big then.<br /><br />I did get this at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,Love it!  Very flattering. 55 years old and got a lot of compliments wearing this tunic!  Color was same as pictured.
4.0,I like the blouse ... although it fits too big.  I returned it for a smaller size.
4.0,"Nice fabric and style, but runs very large. I'm a 34G and about 160 lb, and I felt like the medium was definitely a size too big. The arms especially were very wide (even with a sweater underneath)"
4.0,too short for snake eyes.
4.0,How do you put it on?
4.0,Got them for my middle schooler to accentuate his mullet. They get it done just fine!
4.0,"Wore this to the store tonight, and I got jumped, and called a bully,  but I beat up all 4 of the 8th graders..  But hey I got Tori's number.. This jacket is Bad AZZ... Great jacket but size on mine was little small.. I got a xxl because i like them baggy, but it fits more like a large. Bottom elastic is smaller than rest of jacket. I like it, very bright and soft."
4.0,"fine, no complaints"
4.0,"I love this pullover, but I find that I keep reaching for a front kangaroo pocket. I wish the designers spent just a little more time with the details. I really miss that front pocket."
4.0,"The fit is nice even on the tighest setting. The material feels better than what I expected for the price, I think it will be pretty durable as long as you are not extremely rough with it . It fits the dad hat trend as far as the shape in my opinion . The color is nice , it matches the picture exactly and it is neutral and could go with a variety of colors . It did not come with any type of odor , or bad smell . The hat arrived without any loose strings , and in good condition ! ( I was concerned it may arrive smashed , but it was fine . )"
4.0,"Needed a dress quickly for an upcoming party/event. The dress is a size small. My daughter who is 12, is 5'""3 and weighs about 112 pounds. The small has a little bit of room for growth. But over all will do for just about any nice or special occasion."
4.0,Ot see
4.0,Feels great but thin
4.0,These are nice but extremely  large almost like a big  bracelet.  The shine on the rhinestones make these stand out.
4.0,Overall it’s a great value! Nice soft fabric. The color is a more bright yellow than the pastel yellow shown in the marketing photo. But I’m gonna keep it. It’s very cute!
4.0,"These are just basic tank tops, but they are exactly what I was looking for. They are overly long, which is perfect for layering -- I always wear tank tops under sweaters so I can sit/bend over without worrying that my lower back is exposed."
4.0,"Fits well, skirt has a nice weight to it"
4.0,Nice dress. Fit and comfortable to wear.
4.0,This is a very strong and good looking chain
4.0,Nice for the hot summers of Houston casual date night.
4.0,Great doing business with. Great product.
4.0,"This top is super cute a looks just like the picture. I normally would wear a XXL so I ordered the 2x and it is a little tight in the shoulder area. There is no stretch to the material at all. It's also pretty sheer, you'd need a tank underneath because you can see through it very well. Overall I do like the top, only wish it wasn't so sheer."
4.0,Not fond of cord. Liked heart though
4.0,It was a little loose on the sides but i can take it in a bit for my daughter.
4.0,Zippers are kinda hard to open and close. Product is fine besides that.
4.0,pretty nice would buy again
4.0,The bad fit well and it makes the fit 2 look a little more &#34;grown up&#34;. I got the black one and it looks pretty slick!
4.0,"Love these shades..they are stylish and look great  plus, are a bit darker than the pics here  which is a good thing.......whats  not to like?  these sunglasses  make everything POP..the colors are so vibrant and crisp .. if you have migraines...these might help you out  also....<br /><br />Bottom line, dont listen to the nay sayers out there..if yr looking for an inexpensive back up pair of shades..give these a try..you just might like them..."
4.0,Really good a around the house.
4.0,Nice although the navy blue is hard to tell its not black
4.0,"Although the shoe runs a little smaller than my oofo shoes, I still am able to wear them. They feel like a stable shoe. I have struggled finding shoes to wear with plantar fasciitis. I hope to get another pair and go up a size."
4.0,After looking at reviews and pictures I decided to order this dress. When it came in I could already tell that its completely see through. If you don't mind wearing an extra layer underneath for summer its fine but otherwise I'm upset that I have to buy a complete nude set to wear it.
4.0,Took a chance with this and it is very comfortable.
4.0,"Beautiful sport bra top with a sexy flair. I wear this over another bra top that holds me better as there is no support with this top. It looks great with a tank over, as the t-back shows."
4.0,The shorts were the most comfortable.
4.0,"It is very cute. I always appreciate tank tops with straps thick enough to cover a bra strap. I’ve bought three colors so obviously I like it. The colors are all brilliant. It’s a lightweight fabric and it’s so soft. I prefer tanks on the longer side if I wear them with jeans or something not high waisted which is the only reason it didn’t get five stars. Curiously, there are no tags or indications of front or back but it doesn’t seem to matter. Will be great this summer."
4.0,I love the soft fabric and the bright color.
4.0,"Super cute, but not soft material.  Also, the front and back both have a &#34;V&#34; neckline that make real gymnastics interesting."
4.0,"Nice shirt, fits like it should but it’s a little stiff"
4.0,My daughter loves this suit.  My review is: The top fits a little odd...the straps seem to turn in.  The bottoms I would say run a little small...but the top doesn’t.  The bottoms ARE definitely see through when wet!  She doesn’t care though.  She will wear it when dry or not in the company of others.
4.0,It is a good beanie but it was kinda big.
4.0,More of an olive green over a Kelly green which is what I wanted but still a great shirt that I got a lot of compliments on.
4.0,Came in extremely quick. Looked nice for Christmas but was a bit snug
4.0,"Love the colors, a bit flimsier and smaller than expected, but you get what you pay for. Luckily I have a very small head. Needed some cheap sunglasses since I keep breaking all mine when running with dogs, so this 8-pack is just what I needed."
4.0,"I did Not get this on Amazon due to the odd size enumeration (6XL as example which is probably just XL) - I did get an XL even though I measured out closer to a large.  I did this thinking I could wear my Nylon/Spandex fly fishing pants under these as a common riding practice. These pants are extremely thin yet also Very durable and not too insulative in the summer yet a good initial layer in the winter. I also wear my Leatt knee pads over these pants and discovered that they barely fit in these XL outer ADV pant - the legs look nice but might be a bit tight with decent knee pads let alone with rain and thermal liners. I'm about 200lbs, 6' 1&#34; but have muscular calves so the problem is all the worse. Sadly like most new ADV lines being released, the armored knee pads that come with this nice ADV pant are simply Not good enough. CE level 1 rated if that but do NOT wrap around the knee nearly enough.  The knee pad pockets are way too small to install a nice CE level 2 wrap around pad in and so I will have to modify the knee pad pocket or use one of my knee pad sets such as the Alpinestar Vapors or my favored Leatt Pro MX models which are a favorite of a number of Pro stunt riders. Overall I like the general look and function of these ADV pants but will have to be content with my lite, Gortex lined, Bates GTX9 as adventure boots (shown). Even going up another size I'm not sure would fit over the MX boots I use on my very long distance adventure rides. I particularly like the pocket design but wonder at the use of non-water proof zippers on the outer, upper leg pockets which do appear to be water proof otherwise. As you can see in the photo, the pants do go pretty good with with my Revit Zircon Sand jacket and Bates GTX9 boots... The pants have a nice above knee zippered vents and on the outside of the lower thighs, both seem like good locations... I'm going to keep these and see if I can get along with them on a nice upcoming 2,000 kilometer (a bit over 1200 miles) ride up the OR & WA Coast, around the Olympic peninsula with lots off-road detours mixed in... Overall, I think of these Phantom Tourventure ADV pants as a excellent value and a good addition to my ADV riding wardrobe..."
4.0,Dress is longer and different material than expected. It is still very cute and will keep! Definitely size down. The small fit just right!
4.0,i wear them around the house in the winter.
4.0,"This bathing suit is so beautiful! I am so mesmerized by the color combo used. It goes perfectly with my skin tone. The cinching on the sides make it sooo sexy but classy. It insinuates my curvy figure. I am so sad because i didn't know if i should go with the larger size for my chest (40DDD--normally a 2xl) or my normal size (L/XL). Since it was a one piece and i figured i could adjust the sides if the bottom was too baggy so i got a 2xl.  The straps keep falling off my shoulders...i really wanted this to work out so i just used a hair tie to make it a racer back style (LOL i know ghetto, but it works)! I think the XL would've been fine but i would have probably had a bit more cleavage than i'd like. Still an amazingly beautiful bathing suit!  Still recommend it!"
4.0,Love the hot pink color. Fits nicely. I wear it for working out or casually.
4.0,"I love these leggings! They feel much higher quality than the price tag suggests. They don't ride down or stretch out at all, and they're very flattering (especially on the behind). In my opinion though, they run very large. I'm 5'9&#34;, and a muscular 170# and the small fit me most comfortably. The larges were nearly falling off me, and even the mediums had room to spare."
4.0,"it's a nice and simple keychain, I use it for my keys and I love it! It's sturdy and I love how it comes with 2 different key chain holder."
4.0,I absolutely love the backs on these earrings. The size is perfect. The only thing wrong is they change color.
4.0,It is only the light that is missing. Set up for calculating is very good!
4.0,well made.  love the size of the crystal
4.0,"I'm 5'5, 155, 36C, and got a medium. It has a lot of extra material at the bust, and I think it would look better if it was a little tighter at the waist too. It's not bad, it does fit, but I would have preferreda tighter fit for the top half of my torso. It's also quite long, hitting just below my knee.<br /><br />If you're between sizes I would still size up though. The material is one of those that becomes completely see through if stretched even a tiny bit. Which also makes me glad I got a dark color."
4.0,"aEg - Okay quality, decent price, fast delivery, and but a bit scratchy over time comfortable."
4.0,received very fast. It is a nice bag but is very stiff. wish it was a little more flexible for comfort
4.0,"Good value, and just right for being outside in the cold for long periods."
4.0,I liked the item just fine. My husband wasn’t impressed as o got it as a gift and unfortunately he already had something at work he liked to use. My mistake
4.0,It’s pretty. It’s clunky and quite heavy actually
4.0,"These turban caps are super cute! Everytime I put one of these on my infant daughter, we get the most compliments! Plus, the colors go with most of her outfits. I've washed them a few times and they have held up well (I air dry them as well)."
4.0,It kept the sun off my face and was very comfortable.  Easy to pack in suitcase too.
4.0,"It doesn't plunge down as much as my boyfriend would like.  I like it.  The bottom isn't that great, but it is ok."
4.0,"This sweater is soft and pretty, however it’s very oversized and long. I’m 5’1” and this comes just a couple of inches from my knees.  I usually prefer more tailored sweaters or petite sizes, so it is not what I was looking for. Although there are days when we all like to be comfortable and cozy and like to wear loose fit clothing, and the sweater looks nice. This would be great for someone taller, who wants a cute and casual style."
4.0,It was a little long but I am short. I am happy with the overall product.
4.0,"Last year I purchased these gloves for myself and love them.  This year's pair are for my husband who is usually harder on gloves.  Since only a short time has passed, I can't give these a 5 star rating until I see how they wear since some others have commented that they did not wear well."
4.0,"Nice hat, cool design, fits great!"
4.0,was  good...
4.0,Looking beautiful and keeping its luster is a hallmark of this gem!
4.0,Runs a tad small. Looks a little cheap in person but it’s ok with a jacket over for going out.
4.0,"I purchased this suit for BlizzCon and I love the material and look. I am 5'5"" and 130 lbs so i got a small but it is a little big on my waist and arms. But i can fix that! It has 3d armor pieces ( back plate and lower back pattern) that are detachable with velcro. It is very thick and comfortable for walking around. I do wish that for the price i received gloves. other than that this suit looks like it will last a long time."
4.0,"Good product, reasonably priced. I have owned similar items in the past, and this shoe measures up to what I've had before.<br />I would recommend this product to anyone."
4.0,For the price is excellent. It fits a little weird (maybe too large the knit part) but overall I am very pleased with the purchase. The shipping was very quick.
4.0,I purchased Lemego skull cap to continue running outdoors in winters. Cap has soft lining and convenient slots for wearing sun glasses with the cap and flaps to cover the ears from the elements.<br /><br />This is a one size fits all design so if you are a small size expect it fit loosely although elastic around the edge will still hold it in place.
4.0,"It's comfortable but that's about it. It's vtoo short to be a dress and too loose to be flattering. The chart recommended an extra large, but I got both a large and an extra large in different colors. The large fits better but it is still very, very loose.<br /><br />Basically it's okay for hanging out at home over leggings."
4.0,This is a huge assortment of jewelry! They are nice and small and I have no complaints!
4.0,Fits well and washes well. I hoped for a little more compression but for the price it is okay. Perfect for exercise class with a long outer shirt so that there is no waistband to deal with.
4.0,Pretty much got what was advertised.
4.0,The pants are really soft! The waist was as high as I wanted - based on other reviews I was worried as I wanted a high waist pant.
4.0,"Only thing wrong, it was labeled 5 pack when it’s actually only 3"
4.0,I am 5.8 and 160 pounds.  This dress fit good in a large.  Not too tight or loose.  However please read reviews.  If you are bigger chested and I would say over a C this dress might not be for you.  The front whole will pop open and not hang right.  I am a 34B and I felt like it was fine and I didn't wear a bra.  I did have to keep the tie tight when wearing and it at times could be revealing.  Overall it's a super cute dress and comfy.  Has some stretch on the back so it doesnt fit too tight.
4.0,Would have given this top five stars had it fit. The sleeves were too baggy. I usually wear an XL & in this top a size Large would have worked. Had to return. It is a very pretty top and is made well.
4.0,"I like, but the material is a little funny."
4.0,"The fit of this dress is lovely! Not too short, just above the knees and I'm 5'5&#34;. No peeking bras nor boob tops but I'm taking off a star because the pattern of the fabric is waayy off-centre, not like it is in the one shown which which cheapens the dress, but I guess you get what you pay for. It also had a horrible smells when I opened the package; had to put it outdoors for the night. Apart from that, I like it and will be wearing it to the beach, etc.."
4.0,"Nice set for my wife... Small size fit as expected, wife's around 5' 5&#34; tall, usually wears small size..."
4.0,Bought these for my daughter. She absolutely loves them!
4.0,This is like my 5th pair of Locs and as always impressed with the style fit and quality and cost of these sunglasses!  Received my mirror framed Locs with only a few micro blemishes on the lens! But overall looking dam good and I would recommend this to a friend!😏✌️
4.0,"Suit is somewhat small, shoulders were definitely way to tight for me, I would suggest ordering a size up. Overall the suit is pretty, made well, and material is exactly what is needed in a bathing suit."
4.0,Great for the price! Hasn't tarnished and I wear it everyday!
4.0,Loved how light they were just not a huge fan of how they screw in.
4.0,I don’t like that it is white but it’s nice behind the BAR. I don’t like how it doesn’t light up long enough for me
4.0,"Great sun protection but a little warm in the sun. Not bad, but if you are looking for the cooling effect stay with the lighter colors. These sleeves are not described as &#34;arm coolers&#34; so they are &#34;as advertised&#34;"
4.0,They are cut to fit
4.0,"My only complaint about this denim jacket is that the material arrived super crisp and scratchy and it smelled like mildew and a weird chemical.  I had to wash it 3x before I could actually wear it and its still not very soft or totally odor free.  Nice looking jacket though.  Light weight, fits nice and looks great on.  Goes with just about everything."
4.0,Fabric a little stiff for our liking.
4.0,Top is real cute but hard to were under garments with a d you need it with this top
4.0,"The fabric on these swim trunks are a little on the thin side, but I don't see that necessarily as a bad thing. It just means that they'll dry faster.  They do have regular pockets, which I appreciate.  Too many swim trunks these days either have no pockets or just a cargo pocket, which makes it difficult to have your phone with you.  And I do appreciate the drawstring.  Some swim trunks I have lately only tie in the front, but the string doesn't go all the way around the waist, making it difficult to tie swim trunks securely enough.  I don't have that issue with these."
4.0,hopefully.. they will inspire potty-training
4.0,"I love the pleated style skirt however, I hate to iron those pleats.  The skirt was folded when shipped so beware it will need some attention prior to wearing it.  The XL skirt fitted my 14 size waist.  I will have to take to cleaners for pressing before wearing.  The finishing is a bit shiner luster but will do with a nice fuzzy sweater or satin blouse."
4.0,"And these have moisture wicking. It is hot in Florida. When I work around the house or outside, I start sweating in places I don't want to sweat. The only time I want to feel moisture in my panties, is if I jump or fall into the pool. These fit great and are comfortable. I had to laugh at the health recommendation to wash these panties every six weeks."
4.0,"I love the embroidery art work.  But, f I had my way, it would be on a hat that has a different type of adjustable strap versus the velcro on this hat."
4.0,Good quality and I received it on time my only complaints are it was a little tight and it wasn't floor length like the photo shows. I'm only 5'6 and it didn't come all the way to the floor.
4.0,They were for someone else.  She seemed to like them.
4.0,I have bought about 8 different kinds of compression socks.<br />Either they keep slipping down or bunch at the ankle or very tight at top to where I or my brother can not wear them.<br />These Stay up have a nice band at top have a nice compression to them.<br />My first pair were smooth with no design to them they pilled the second time I put them on.<br />I  bought a second pair and they were argile style looking and they left a little bit of the design on my leg but didn't<br />really feel it.<br />I am pleased so far with these I might try another brand but for now as far as they don't slip down and not tight at top I am pleased.
4.0,He likes the way it feels and the way it looks. He thinks it's cool. And he needed it.
4.0,Love this! This is the second thing I’ve bought from this seller and I am pleased again! It fits and looks exactly as I expected. Hoping it will hold up in the wash just like the first dress I bought from them.
4.0,This Hat is a life saver.  right now there are so many flies out around my house.  this net kept them from getting in my face!! love it so much!!
4.0,"I'm infatuated with the color Orange. so when I saw these I couldn't help but buy them.  I ordered them on the 8th of Dec and they showed up in my mailbox the following Monday.  Today is the first day I've actually worn them and they're as comfortable as any pair of socks can be.  They're a little bit pricey for being $10.95 for only one pair of socks.  I was expecting to find at least 2 pairs, but they are as colorful and festive as I'd hope they'd be.  Over all I'm fairly satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"For flip flops, these are comfy and provide decent arch support.  They would be perfect for wide feet.  My feet are normal width so they feel a little wide, but not enough to complain about."
4.0,Pretty good.  Some of the bikinis are smaller than others for some reason.
4.0,"The pictures appear much more 3D then the shirt actually is. But, I still like it`s appearance and the sizing chart was accurate for me.Overall, I`m pleased"
4.0,"I fell in love with this sweater the second I felt it! It is buttery soft and super cute! I love the way it fit! It’s a little short on the abdomen, so I had to wear tall jeans. I was super sad when it wore out so fast though. I wore it quite a bit through the holidays, and it developed a massive hole in the arm pit where it came unstitched. Super bummed about it and will probably try and fix it because I’ve loved it so much."
4.0,"I love the colors & fabric.  It's only somewhat small, but that is not the fault of the dress."
4.0,"The fabric of this mask is soft and very comfortable to wear. 3 ply is always good quality in a face mask. Love the fact that it is washable and reusable. I have no problem breathing at all. The middle layer is made of 100% filter cotton. It is designed for non- medical use. Does provide a barrier against small particles in the air. I don’t like that the fit is not as snug as I prefer. It is secure around the nose and mouth. But the side did not fit securely. It would work great with a top and bottom draw loop. However, lots of pluses with this face mask. Get 4 in a pack and comes with the nose clip, adjustable ear loop, and more."
4.0,"I do love the socks, but I was first concerned with the stitching on the inside.. I thought it might make my legs swell.. It did not but it did leave a impression on the leg. Which cause no problems.."
4.0,My son loves his watch and was very upset when the ring around the front fascia cracked after a few months.  The seller replaced the watch without cost or hassle.  Happy kid/happy dad - thanks!
4.0,"First off, the shipping was really fast, I got it in about a week and a half. It seems very solid and is working at the moment at least, good for the money; the only reason I didn't give it a full review is because the front is a bit smeared, it's a tad scratched but it looks like the paint wasn't fully allowed to dry and so it's a bit miscolored. Still, I don't think my brother will mind too much; for what I paid it's great."
4.0,"These leggings are SO comfortable! As soon as I put them on, I didn’t wanna take them off. According to the size chart, I’m between a small and medium (5’2”, 135lbs), so I ended up going with a medium to avoid it being too tight around my hips. The leggings fit perfectly! However, my main issue is that the lavender color shows every drop of moisture. I accidentally got a few drops of water on my leggings before I worked out, so I was worried it would show sweat really easily. I put in a hard workout to see how bad it would get (I get really sweaty), and my crotch/butt area looked soaked. So that was embarrassing. I suppose I’ll save these for an easy yoga day or just to wear around the house/to run errands. I doubt this will be an issue for any of the darker colors, so I would still definitely recommend them!"
4.0,"This is a lovely watchband and my wife loves it. It is nice to have a change to your bands, depending on the situation. The grade of leather is nice and so far, it has held up well."
4.0,"Perfect for what I was looking for, an inexpensive hat that was lightweight and quick drying for exercise.  I would give it five stars however the stitches that held the logo was already coming off when I got it.  I guess if you pay for inexpensive things you get inexpensive quality."
4.0,"The shirt fit perfect. However, the bottom fits like you have them on backwards and kept sliding off every move. I even tried them on backward. Nope. N i ordered 2 colors. I hace only worn the grey"
4.0,"Material is a tad bit thin, but fits great and its pretty"
4.0,"It is very thin fabric, which is what I wanted for super casual summer style.  It's not the best fabric but for the price and style you cant go wrong. The waist isnt too tight, I went a size up. It isnt stretchy fabric."
4.0,I wish I Took pictures but they look adorable!!! It was good quality but they grew out of them very quickly though lol
4.0,"It's one of those magnetic charm holders, you can open it up and put whatever you want inside."
4.0,A little too big. Nice color and material
4.0,It was ok..
4.0,"Gorgeous pattern and a shape that covers but is cute, thanks to the high waist drawstring. Perfect for lounging around the house."
4.0,"Cute, small Kate Spade with a weird leather smell. Small purse with a short strap makes for a HIGH crossbody fit."
4.0,great fit and length but the material is very thin. wish they had a thicker waistband
4.0,Great shirt but a little short on me and I have a short torso
4.0,"I got this for my husband, he really loves these kinds of belts. I really didn't notice that there was a bottle opener on the buckle, that might be the only negative in my book. Great color!"
4.0,"This watch is beautiful!! One of a kind, I’ve never seen one like it. However, when I received it. I tried to set the time. Only to find out, the battery was dead!! I contacted seller/Amazon. Amazon said to keep, dispose, etc and they would refund me. I took watch to jewelers. The guy was amazed by this watch. He’d never seen one like this either. He called one of his workers over to look at it also. She also thought it was unique!! When he turned it over. Their was another problem. One of the screws was missing. He put a new battery in and it worked. Bewell for the price I paid. Everything should’ve worked and nothing should’ve been missing. I like to ask that you pay more attention to your product before shipping. I’ve ordered 3 of your Bewell watches in the past and they were fine. I’d like to thank you Bewell for such an amazing watch!! And Amazon for my refund!"
4.0,"Its still summer here but, I tried it one and it seems fine."
4.0,Very nice for the price.  Looks great with my mid calf boots.
4.0,My grand daughter loved this!  I noticed it pilled a bit and was a lint magnet. Perhaps a lighter color would have been better.  It is soft and cozy warm.
4.0,"work great, gave some away."
4.0,It isn't very big but wanted a small purse. For the price and size it works great.
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress, I was pleasantly surprised with its quality! the part in the front where the slit is supposed to be is different than pictured though. Mine came with two pieces of cloth that overlap right in the crotchal region and it definitely needs a couple stitches so my kitty doesn't come out to say hello whilst walking... over all great fro the price!"
4.0,Thick material top of pants don’t fit all that great for a girl with a big bottom. Over all comfy and color is true to picture
4.0,"Great watch, cheap band"
4.0,"I gave four stars because the back maybe runs an inch shorter than it should, doesn’t fully cover butt but fits great other than that.<br />Size as expected."
4.0,See through but really worth the price
4.0,They fit well but not the material I was hoping for. More like a silky feel.
4.0,Great colour and shape
4.0,"It was pretty but, looks brown not red. I was hoping to wear it with my Valentine outfit."
4.0,Bought these while they were on sale and they were a great buy plus they're a very comfortable shoe.  I wear them with jeans or capris and get lots of compliments on them. Would highly recommend.
4.0,The color is more a fushia color than a hot pink.  A little disappointed but will keep it.
4.0,"I brought it because I want to match the earring. The ring is a bit rough - as the finish was as smooth as I thought it would be, but you pay for the price. Overall, it does feel sturdy so I trust it to last for a while. Could have a better paint job though. But still, it's really cute."
4.0,Bought for a flapper costume.
4.0,"Comfy, using it as a swimsuit cover up, slightly smaller than expected, I ordered a small and I am 5'3  and weigh 125."
4.0,Very happy with this dress. I have received lots of compliments!
4.0,"I loved the color of the dress. Before I ordered the dress I already knew to order a large after reading reviews stating it was cut big. It fit. I do wish I got XL but regards it fit. I did expect the dress to be little longer. When you walk it tends to ride up more than you want. The split is in the middle and not side. The bow I think I put on the wrong side. Also, I thought the sleeves were longer than what I got. The picture made it seem it would be longer, but regardless I like the dress. I wore it took a wedding."
4.0,"Lovely, fits true to size."
4.0,Beautiful outfit. Skirt was really big. Good thing I know how to sew.
4.0,It opens on it's own. I lost charms
4.0,"The band is hard to fasten. But after getting it on, it does stay in place."
4.0,Size runs little small
4.0,"They're not well made, I had to put the pins back in some of them to hold the arms on, but it was an easy fix. They're also small- I originally got them for middle schoolers but they were too small so I gave them out to first graders. They filled the Valentine's treat bag so they served their purpose."
4.0,Nice hats. Just a little big.
4.0,"They seem good to me, but my wife will be the final judge."
4.0,"This is a really nice travel scarf! I have been wanting a scarf with a hidden pocket for a while and ordered several to compare quality.  This is soft, looks more expensive than it was, the pocket is nice and large, and the zipper is very discreet.  It may be a bit too warm if you were looking for something you could wear in the summer but this will be an excellent fall/winter item."
4.0,"The bands are great so far. I got them today and they were really easy to install on my rose gold galaxy watch. My only issue is that they are a size large. I did not read that in the overall description, so I was a little surprised. My wrist usually takes a S/M, so the band is just a bit long for my wrist. I think it may affect comfortability a bit, but so far I'm happy enough to just wear them as is."
4.0,"At first glance, it looks like there are missing diamonds where the band crosses but it's where there wasn't enough space left to fit one- kinda disappointed. Other than that, it's a pretty ring for the money."
4.0,"After reding other reviews, I ordered a medium instead of a large, and it fits good."
4.0,"Nice ring, however compare to other rings I've bought from this seller it's a bit thin."
4.0,Cute! So far so good
4.0,Stunning watch. People asking me where si bought it ...
4.0,The subject.
4.0,"Overall, good delivery. Only two pairs I would speak negatively of. One set (acrylic) didn’t match via color; one a deep blue and the other a deep purple. The second pair was one size to small (I ordered 9/16ths). I had read all the reviews and was prepared for possible mix ups. To have the pairs labeled as to materials used would have been cool but for the price, I am pleased with what I got. I think one set may be Labradorite which I am excited about and wasn’t expecting."
4.0,Love this dress the size is exacly ... so i am short person need to fix it but the dress is perfect
4.0,fits snug
4.0,Nice watch.  Color is different.  The price is also reasonable.<br /><br />I will purchase again soon.  Thanks. :)
4.0,I usually wear a small and my bust is a 32DD so I went with a small. The bust is a tad tight but otherwise fits well. The material is odd- almost plasticy. No stretch or give at all. Flowy in the midsection which I love. I'd buy again!
4.0,"cute dress, decent material. I tried to follow the recommendations of other reviewers on size. I am a 32DDD, 27 inch waist, 38 inch glutes. Ordered a medium and it was too big so returned. Considering ordering the small though to see if it fits."
4.0,"Love the coverage of the upper arms.  The cuff was snug, but other than that the shirt was what I expected."
4.0,"I really miss my Aviator glasses I had when I was flying in the Navy. So, I was intrigued when I saw the &#34;DowerSmart Aviator Polarized Metal Frame Sunglasses UV400&#34; were available to purchase and review on AmazonPrime.  I ordered my new pair of Aviator Sunglasses thru my AmazonPrime account.  I received my sunglasses at a Discount for my Honest and Unbiased Review.  Since I ordered thru AmazonPrime, the arrived quickly in just a couple of days.  They were well-packaged and were protected to prevent any damage during shipping.  I was just a little disappointed that they were manufactured with flimsy-lightweight metal and had lightweight plastic lenses.  I guess I was expecting the quality of my original Aviator Glasses so this is the reason for my 4-Star Review.  For the price, they are really not too bad; more like the mid-priced sunglasses you might buy in a Big Box Store.  So in conclusion, I give the &#34;DowerSmart Aviator Polarized Metal Frame Sunglasses UV400&#34; my 4-Star Review and Recommendation."
4.0,I love this and get many complements on it!  Just be sure to hang dry - my daughter had one that she put in the dryer and it will shrink.
4.0,good fit very satisfied
4.0,"The glasses came scratched across one lens. They look just as described. The seller was very good and sent me another pair free of any charge.  I received in about 4 days.  I needed a 2.75 but they didn't have those so got the 2.50 progressive. They're lightweight, fit good and I can see out of them clear enough when doing computer stuff.  Next time I will probably get the blue light readers with no progressive since I wear my normal glasses otherwise. Satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"This shirt is nice, but was really big. I washed on gentle in cold water and it shrunk up in length a lot. I hung on a hanger to dry and put in dryer on wrinkle free for less than 5 minutes. I sent back."
4.0,I got this for my mother for mothers day. It was perfect with all of the charms and everything but it was a little short so she cant wear it.
4.0,I thought it was going to be a littler more nicer. This is more like for a 7 year old versus a 16 year. Very nice though!
4.0,Very thick socks.I believe these are the thickest Stance socks I own...& i own many. The only socks i wear.
4.0,I really like these.  They are the same style that I bought from another company online but those were close to $40.  Can't beat the price.  I wish the lenses weren't see through but still great for the price.
4.0,"If you have small ears or your industrial is set a more extreme angle than others, you may not be able to get this into your ear. Unfortunately this was the case for me. However the product itself was high quality and came as advertised. The return process was incredibly easy and efficient as usual.<br /><br />Punchline: very cute, high quality, but won't fit just anyone's ear."
4.0,nice hat but a little larger than expected
4.0,"Really pretty, but has a couple imperfections when you look closely. Overall well worth it for the price.. just have to trim a few loose threads."
4.0,"The watch is beautiful, but gold tone. It was supposed to be stainless steel."
4.0,Good price for what you get. These fit good and are comfortable. The underwire tends to come out fast so I make sure not to dry them in the dryer.
4.0,Very attractive earrings. Comfortable to wear.
4.0,Mac and cheese socks.... exciting at first....
4.0,"The pattern in this dress is really cute, tiny triangle wavy lines in pale tan, light blue,light aqua, which at a glance  look a bit like shark fins. Tried to go one size bigger than my normal  small, but traded in the medium, as skirt was too wide. Have used this brand a lot in summer, but it seems TOAD is running bigger in size than before. 5’6, 130lbs 38B/C size small (stretchy fabric)"
4.0,It fit really well and is super cute.
4.0,Excellent will be buying every color 😂👍
4.0,"""Wonderful"" is all I can say :) Though the clue on the metal is quite easy to be seen, that's not a big problem :)"
4.0,Great product. The wife loves them. Fast shipping. Thank you
4.0,It isn't a tight fit watch. It's pretty.
4.0,Works out
4.0,I wanted to keep this cute sweater but it was too short. It would look cute on an “in shape body”.
4.0,"I ordered a 10 Toddler for my niece but they were too tight! The shoe itself, however, is AMAZING! Top quality, super fast shipping & worth the money! Bummed they were small but will definitely order again. This is an item totally worth buying! Soft insole and real buckle (as opposed to Velcro) were an unexpected bonus! Once I get ones that fit they will be a 5 star for sure!"
4.0,I’m 5’1” and I usually wear US 8 (medium). I ordered this jacket size XXL after reading all the reviews and it’s a good fit. I like my clothes little loose so I’d order XXXL if they had it.<br />But the jacket is really good and I’m absolutely happy with it. I would give it 5 star had the length been a little longer.
4.0,Purchased a large and I wear a 4/ sometimes 6 (have a large booty but tiny waist) and I'm 5'3- super long and had to take to alterations lady to get hemmed but hemming costs a lot because of the pleats.. finally found someone to do it for $25 (because I only paid 22$ for the skirt) but had offers for $50 and $75 to hem it! Yikes! Super cute but you will need to get hemmed if you are under 5'10
4.0,Awesome idea !!! Overall yes 4 stars quality might be little lower then 4
4.0,"Cute shorts. Finally found a pair that almost cut the way I like them. Too many are cut straight down in the legs so when you sit down they’re skin tight in the thighs - these are cut wider in the legs and are ""shorter"".  The material is stretchy, not as stiff as regular denim.  Because of the stretchy material, they do stretch out after wearing a few hours so take that into consideration when deciding on your size.  I could've went with a size 3 but don't like my shorts tight.  I’m 5’3” 130 lbs got a size 5. Not tight, not baggy.  Hemline is somewhat uneven as you can see in the pictures and after sitting a few times, the edges of the material curl up a little in the back.  Not a deal breaker... just wish they made shorts like they use to with a heavier, stiffer cotton denim material which had more structure than the stretchy spandex stuff and kept their shape much longer.  See pics"
4.0,Soooo nice! only comment is about color since is not like in the picture y way more strong.
4.0,It's very pretty and flattering but a bit big. I think I just ordered it too big. Best if it's a little tight it holds you better.<br />I got this suit so I can take the straps down to tan. It is good for the money and will be nice for a in between suit.
4.0,"I love that the top is adjustable both over the shoulders and tie around. It’s hard to buy tops and bottoms the same size (typically bottoms L-XL and tops S-M) when i bought this I was mainly sizing for the bottoms and if the top fit then it was a double win, but luckily since the top is adjustable i was able to make it smaller."
4.0,"These fit great, and the price is very good. I have purchased several of these in different colors."
4.0,"Too small, returned, fast refund, ordered larger size"
4.0,Fun for different outfits.
4.0,This shirt has a bit of a funny shape in the front (kind of flares out around the stomach) but is not too bad.  Still very cute and nice material.  Love the back!
4.0,I'm normally a size 12 or a large for tops in the real world. I bought this in a XXXL and it fits really well. Long enough to wear over leggings. Cute and flattering style. I bought it in charcoal color and not see through at all.
4.0,This is a beautiful watch and I really like the large face.  I was even provided with a replacement battery.  Thank you.
4.0,Very nice shrugg but I would suggest buying one size up.
4.0,"If you're looking for a lightweight gym bag that will fit into most lockers easily, this bag is for you."
4.0,It was great but don’t put it in the drier. It shrank a bit.
4.0,Did not realize these were so small and dainty.  Perfect for a children.  They are beautiful.
4.0,My mom wears this often. She loves it and it hasnt turned black.
4.0,"Fits as described, great convenience item. The leather is not holding up well though, edges are beginning to tatter after only 2 months"
4.0,Do the job well. But sizing runs quite big. I bought a 1-2 for my 3 year old and he still has room to spare in there.
4.0,"Little costly, but good quality"
4.0,The print is just as expected and super cute but they run very small! Size up one if you’re going to buy these! I’ve got to lose a few more pounds before I’m comfortable enough to wear them in public :(
4.0,I wear with shorts so gives a little pizzas to necessary compression socks
4.0,"I purchased this for my 20 year old grandson.  It was a risk, because it isn't easy picking jewelry on line.  But I had hunted everywhere for something suitable and cost efficient and this hit the mark.  When it arrived I feared it might be too small, since he is rather large boned, but it fit my husband's wrist so I kept it and hoped for the best.  My grandson said the same thing when he opened it -- it looked small.  But when he put it on it was perfect.  It was the hit of his Christmas stocking.  For his age, I felt this was enough money to spend on a bracelet that might get lost, or go out of style.  Also, it came with nice packaging.  I would recommend this for the younger set."
4.0,"The belt is a bit too thick as it is made from robe fabric, could be a bit longer.  Very comfortable robe.  The hood is unnecessary feature."
4.0,"Super cute swimsuit! Modest, covers everything while still being flattering. The top fit well (if you are very large in the bust, it's probably not for you) the cut of the bottom was a little odd and didn't look good on me. I would have gotten a different bottom to go with it, but decided to return because of how the top cuts in at the front of the armpit area.(see pictures) I don't think it would be comfortable for me to swim or kayak in.<br /><br />I'm 5'4 and about 126 lb and I ordered a large."
4.0,"I believe others mention ordering up a size…for me if a size and a half were an option that would have been awesome.  This shirt is nice…casual but not sloppy, can be dressed up easily and the fabric is soft, with a little stretch but not so much that it has no shape.<br /><br />I recieved this item free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.  I take reviewing products seriously as I also rely on the reviews of others to help me determine where to spend my hard earned money. I give 5 stars when it is deserved, 4 stars when the item is good and worth the money but just not perfect, and 3 stars when an item is worth keeping just not living up to my expectations.  Below that I do try to contact the seller prior to leaving 1 or 2 stars.  If I cannot reach an agreement with the seller I will then leave 1 or 2 stars with my review.<br /><br />If this review helped you to make a decision please click yes below.  Thank you in advance."
4.0,"Fits well but the stitching came out after one wearing. Other than that, its pretty good."
4.0,Arrived in great shape and are as expected
4.0,"Not too big or small. Perfect to carry phone, money, lip gloss, etc."
4.0,Perfect to protect my hands from this California sun!!!
4.0,"This is a cute dress. I liked it.<br /><br />My only issue was that the top gapped, and that is why I took off a star. I wish they had a button or something.<br /><br />I thought it was flattering. I thought the fit was pretty good. I thought that it was unique and looked good.<br /><br />The dress was relatively comfortable. The fit was okay. It wasn't too hot, which for me is important since we live in Florida.<br /><br />It wasn't too hard to clean. I thought it seemed trendy. It felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft. It would work in a wide variety of settings.<br /><br />It was as described and I would recommend it."
4.0,"I did like the 14k Solid Yellow Gold Endless Hoop Earrings - however, I felt they were too small for me so I gave them to my 4 yr old niece.  They look great on her."
4.0,"Beautiful dress!! Nice quality very soft.its perfectly fits in my arm and bouncy in the bottom,but a little bit tight in my chest I should have order the medium size"
4.0,"After 3 tries, we got what we expected."
4.0,There is a cut in the back that is tied together at the top. I wasn't expecting that and so I had to sew it closed. Just be aware that that is there
4.0,"Nice price, beautiful design. It notes that hte material used is of good quality.."
4.0,I just got this belt and there are no problems with it at all. A lot sturdier than I anticipated. It seems to be good quality. I'm a size 42 and it fits great. The only weird thing is the shipment notification says &#34;women's belt.&#34;
4.0,"A bit short, but it's supposed to be. The sleek material makes it impossible to keep the robe wings tied in place, no matter how tight. But I usually wear it wide open. Its a comfortable and sexy dress, will get other colors soon."
4.0,I ordered a 2x because I wanted it to be oversized. It fits more like a men's large in my opinion.
4.0,Its beautiful. My daughter luved it. The sizes definatley run small. I ordered on size up for her and should have went 2 or 3 sizes up.
4.0,"Got these for use in our inflatable kayak and also for stand up paddle boarding.  They are very light weight, but the sole holds up surprisingly well walking through gravel to the boat launch.  They are very light weight, and while I am not sure they will last a really long time, they work great for now!"
4.0,thanks...
4.0,fits as is
4.0,Had to give away. It was to short for me. The colors are beautiful
4.0,"Beautiful dress. I'm glad I ordered a size smaller, like other reviews suggested.  Color is very vibrant.  I can't wait to wear to the beach. Update, I received so many compliments when I wore this dress."
4.0,The keychain was a little smaller than expected but very nice.  Well worth the price.  The packaging was beautiful (velvet bag and box).
4.0,"I got this nose ring for my friend and she loved it. It's cute and it's not too big, the only problem is that it falls out very easily, due to the fact that it's not bent and there's really nothing securing it in."
4.0,"He likes them so much we ordered another pair, but in a bigger size."
4.0,The coloring of this dress is beautiful. The length it SHORT! I'm only 5 feet tall the this dress is way to short to wear without leggings.
4.0,Dress had a light pink stain all over the back. I washed it to try and get it off but it did not work. Did not have time to find a new dress that is the reason I kept it and did. It return it. As far as style it is absolutely stunning. I received several compliments.
4.0,Love the look of these leggings! My only complaint is that I don't find the elastic waistband very comfortable.
4.0,"First of all the ""light blue"" dress is more of an ""aqua blue"" but it's still very nice. For reference I am 5'6"", approx. 160lbs and the large fits perfectly. Will be using for my maternity photoshoot."
4.0,Babies go through socks so quickly so getting a great deal on these was awesome. Lots of different ones in the bundle. Only thing I didn't care for was some of them were scratchy & not soft. Other than that they're pretty cute.
4.0,This dress is awesome. I love the material and the way it just flows. I think I need another one in a different color which I did buy and love it too
4.0,"I absolutely adore this dress except it’s way too long even with boots on and I kept tripping over it (lol) and the chest area fits funny and poofs out awkwardly. Over all it washed well, worked for my costume and not a complete waste but a bit pricey."
4.0,Loved them the minute I took them out of the package and put them on. Only complaint is that it feels like walking on pebbles and by the time I had them on for a couple hours just hanging out. The beans were already peeling and a couple completely fell off. I'm going to try gluing them back on with stronger glue and maybe make an incert to make them a little more comfy for long periods of wear.
4.0,"A little larger than I anticipated, but overall good quality. Cute design. Big enough to carry small computer."
4.0,"I’m slim to medium built, 5’6” and about 165lbs (with a big tummy; post baby fat). I love the fit, the material (cotton), and the colours (brownish floral) of this dress. And it has pockets! I put a sweater bolero with it to dress it up for a meeting; but love the idea that it is also a perfect casual wear too!"
4.0,Beautiful scarf. Exactly what I expected for the price. It's very light weight and will be perfect for Florida weather.
4.0,My daughter was a flower girl in the wedding. I was glad to find this color. I had been searching for a while. The dress arrived with a broken hoop in the petticoat.  A replacement dress was sent. The hoop broke shortly. The edges are sharp.  Thankfully my daughter’s legs weren’t scratched. We had to remove the hoop and toss it just before the wedding started.  Pretty dress though.  It served its purpose.
4.0,I thought the bracelets were individual not all in one and requires to lap and loop around lucky I have tiny wrists or it wouldn't fit! Very nice quality set though I can't wait to wear it out it's beautiful and shipped very promptly.
4.0,"I'm a field engineer and it's JUST about the perfect size to carry around basic tools (flashlight, screw driver, tape measure, pens and 2 cell phones.  I like the look and feel of it.  I wish that the seams were gussetted  (i wish it was just a little bit thicker/deeper)  but man, for $13  I'm not complaining."
4.0,The zipper was not properly sewn into the skirt so we had to make an adjustment to it. It runs smaller than normal size medium in my opinion. Quality of material for price was fine. Color of skirt and pleats are good.
4.0,Colors not as bright as expected and tshirt not the best quality.
4.0,I love the earrings just don’t wear them for a long period of time bc they are cheap metal. The choker was a little tighter than I would have liked but did fit it stretches. If you are a woman with a large neck don’t buy this. If you have a teenager or younger child you’re buying it for it will be perfect. If you are an 20’s early 30’s woman who doesn’t have too big of a head it will work for you. I like them although I can’t wear for long periods of time due to discomfort from the cheap metals used.
4.0,"I have small fingers, so had to purchase ring guard for snug it. Overall, like the rings very much and am pleased."
4.0,Very cute top and easy to nurse in. Leggings were too tight and the color is weird... looks almost like I'm not wearing any pants! I never wear the pants but I love the top.
4.0,"These are just a smidge tight on me at the waist, but look great everywhere else so I kept them. It's nice not to have to tuck my phone in my bra when I need two hands at the gym."
4.0,"Would buy again. .. in a different color,  of course,  because I already have these"
4.0,I loved this dress and got so many compliments. I will say that if you want to hide and lumps and bumps a proper undergarment is a must. The only real issue that I had was the area where the strap are attached to the dress started to unravel but nothing a little needle and thread can't fix.
4.0,"Love them, pretty long though"
4.0,These work great in my boots.  Very comfortable and I appreciate the (hidden) added height !
4.0,"this is my fourth band I've bought for my versa lite. The others fall apart over time, hoping this doesn't as well.<br /><br />these look great and are super comfortable.<br /><br />had two complaints keeping me from 5 star<br /><br />1. keeps coming loose. seems the bar thing to keep it set isn't tight enough and slips back over time.<br /><br />2. Band holds water (and sweat). After a good workout the band is filled with sweat. really gross to put on after the post workout shower"
4.0,I was told about these by my acupuncturist. I haven't used them for long but it definitely has helped relieve some of the pain from my aching fingers. I will post an updated review in a month or so.
4.0,Theses shoes are great they were bought for my daughter and she loves them.  When she tried them on she said they were a little snug in the leg area but the feet fit fine.  She has muscular calves and that maybe why but on average if you have small skinny legs you should be just fine.  We did find that the die wears quite fast on these boots.  It comes with two pair of laces which where not long enough to lace up with every whole on the boot.
4.0,A little thin and flexible but overall good for the price. A little meaningful token. 👍
4.0,"It is pretty thick, but I love the product overall. It's soft and stays on. I get a lot of comments from other female riders :-)"
4.0,"Men's Bold Plaid Long Sleeve Button Down Shirt (4X, Navy Blue-Black)<br /><br />The shirt is okay especially for the price. I thought it was a flannel shirt but I misread that. The shirt runs small, I bought a 4x I am 5'10&#34; 275lbs and I have never worn a 4X. I am between a 2-3X in size. The 4X fits me fine, it was a lucky guess. Other than the size the shirt is nice.<br /><br />I hope my review helps you with your purchase ;) . I get the satisfaction that I have helped someone out. Please click the “Yes” button should you find this review helpful in any way. I like to see if my reviews help anyone. I will update and hopefully post photos or a video later.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01KIFU3PI Men's Bold Plaid Long Sleeve Button Down Shirt (4X, Navy Blue-Black)]]"
4.0,It smelled slightly weird but that’s to be expected when you get something new. Only thing i wish is that it didn’t have a small opening at the bottom because i fear if i put change in the money slot it would slip through.
4.0,lace a little bit too thin but overall it is fancy and very femenine.
4.0,This was a Christmas gift. I haven’t given it yet but was pleased with the quality and excited to wrap and give the gift.
4.0,"Christmas gift, no response of recipient."
4.0,Love the dress.  Just wish was cotton.
4.0,"Beautiful, but very tight arms"
4.0,"Im 5' 11"" 205lbs. I was gonna buy a Large but bought the XL instead. It fits perfect. I honestly only use it for running but it handles great. I was very satisfied. Buying more forsure."
4.0,Good medallion for the price. Chain was too short and had to put it on a different one to hang lower.  Very bright shiny gold.  Wore for a pirate festival.
4.0,Based off other reviews I bout two sizes up. The dress was beautiful and I loved having it on but it was too big. I’d say go only one (1) size up!!
4.0,Arrived very wrinkled could not get them out even after ironing threw in wash and fluffed dry and it sloved the problem not overly sheer and nice and cool
4.0,"They fit good, true to size. We weren’t able to try them out yet in the snow."
4.0,The XL is way to small and tight. Sleeve length is fine
4.0,"The socks feel good.  The only problem is when you put them on, the images distort.  I have thin legs so if they do that on me, they will do that on everyone."
4.0,"The watch came in a scheduled, in a nice box and in perfect condition.<br />The watch itself looks and feels like an expensive one and the see thru mechanism it's really nice. I have  a week with it and hope that it will stay working good for a long time... So far a good purchase."
4.0,"Great for long rides when you need the little extra cushioning. Feels a little bulky though, which may just take some getting used to."
4.0,"Bought it for my 9 year old. Nice watch, easy set up. Wish the band was smaller considering it’s a children’s watch. It’s big on him."
4.0,For a bearded guy like me..... they slide a lot.
4.0,"I don't give 5 stars to this watch because I actually haven't worn it ye since I just got it and try it on, but I can tell you that is sooooooooo beautiful and it seems to have a really good quality because is kind of heavy like expensive watches usually are."
4.0,bought it as a gift she loves it
4.0,"I typically wear a size 7 or 7-1/2 shoe. I ordered these in 7-1/2 and the fit perfectly. The description says they are fur lined, however it doesn't feel like a typical fur lining as it is extremely thin. I have received several compliments in the two times I've worn them from people of all ages."
4.0,"The gloves had a hole in it, but it was nothing I couldn't fix myself with a sewing machine. Material is pretty cheap and see-through. Definitely more for lingerie then cosplay unless you're pretty daring."
4.0,"so cute, good material and print."
4.0,I got my 👗 and love it
4.0,strong hold and very durable
4.0,A small rubber band or gasket is behind the pendent<br />that hold the chain so it stays in place
4.0,A mi esposo le encanta es muy bonito de buena calidad
4.0,"Comfortable , but the pouch is a tad small."
4.0,"Adorable! Be careful though.. the lining is much shorter than the dress, so quite a bit of the bottom is see through."
4.0,You'd have to be really small for it to tie the way it does on the model. I thought the measurements would work but it's so small. Otherwise good quality for the price.
4.0,This is gorgeous! The colors are just as depicted and they are easy to clean! If you like them I don’t see why not getting them. I got them mainly for color since it matches many of my babies clothes but is a very good product too! So I’m happy
4.0,"Lightweight professional looking blouse.  The teal looks a little more emerald to me, but it's still pretty.  Light colors are too sheer."
4.0,Cute and cozy for the price. However upon unpacking the sweater smells strong/weird.
4.0,"Color was pretty and it felt nice. Gave it as a gift, they seemed to like it."
4.0,It works as a replacement but is definitely not as thick as the original canopy that came with my umbrella.
4.0,I am very satisfied with the top. The material is very soft and comfortable. This is my second purchase in different color
4.0,Need more pockets inside. Latch not well done<br /> Keeps popping open.
4.0,Nice dress but too tight
4.0,"I was using this so that I coul listen to music while working a factory job that was very loud and didn't allow headphones, earbuds, etc. It did the job but it wasn't exactly the most inconspicuous product, as the speakers kind of bulge out of the sides of the beanie. They also pressed hard against my ears in a way that was kind of uncomfortable. The sound quality is okay at best, but you really get what you pay for with this product. It's not extremely soft but again, it did the job. Thankful that I got to listen to music at work."
4.0,"I love the style and the look. I would have gave them 5stars if the fit was correct. Other reviews said they were cut big so I order them in a 7 1/2. I usually wear an 8, I could have order a 7."
4.0,"I was able to order the Skagen 433LSL1 watch band replacement without any difficulty and it was delivered quickly.  In addition to what I thought was a good price, this review would normally be 5 stars.!<br /><br />However, it was not apparent to me how to replace the band as my watch has a a spring bar on top and bottom and the replacement band doesn't appear to have a hole that a spring bar would pass through.<br /><br />So, I brought my watch to a local jeweler, who told me that the replacement watch band wouldn't fit the watch.<br /><br />I find that hard to believe, so I'm going to contact Skagen directly to see what they have to say.<br /><br />Will update this review at a later date, when I have more info."
4.0,"Only giving 4 stars as the material used is weird.  It isn't soft, but isn't itchy, but in between.  Hard to describe.  Fit is great, but weird material and feel."
4.0,"Very pretty band, really dresses up my Versa. I would have given 5 stars, but the black finish on the outer side strap has worn off."
4.0,"These bras are really cute. I dont think they are durable enough for every day wear but they work perfectly for those spe dial occassions when you are wanting to feel and look sexy. I wear these bras with a pair of panties from the multipacks I also ordered from Amazon which coordinate great with these bras. I ha e I cluded a pic of the panties in my review so you can see. I usually wear a 36 C and ordered a 38 D which fit perfectly. I like that you can cross cross the straps but the place where the strap attaches is a little flimsy if you are a little more busty like me. I have included a pic of that too so you can see. If you have smaller breast, I think these would work fine for everyday wear."
4.0,Nice product. Nice fit. Comfortable
4.0,"My husband said that it was slightly tight around the waist, but they are kinda stretchy so other than that they fit great."
4.0,"My 18 year old son who lifts weights loves this shirt.  I put it in dryer by accident and the design was distorted, don't put it In dryer.."
4.0,did not fit like i thought
4.0,Too heavy - but nice purse
4.0,"Good color in the garment, sizing is correct and item is a good summer sweater. I was expecting more of a cotton blend or knit item based off the picture but it’s more of a rayon/spandex ish material, just FYI."
4.0,Good quality material will buy it again
4.0,"I bought this to replace the rubber strap on my Casio MDV-106 diver watch (outstanding watch, by the way).  I've put a couple watchbands on in the past, but I just couldn't get the pins to seat correctly.  I took it to my jeweler, who charged $10 to install the band and an additional $5 to size it.  The jeweler told me that he had to bend the spring pins slightly, because the holes on the strap ends don't line up perfectly with the holes on the watch case.  This means that I have a somewhat weak connection between the watch and the band, and it won't last for a long, long time like it's supposed to.  But -- it's a $12 watch band, it doesn't feel as solid or sturdy as other steel straps I've used (Bulova and Invicta), and I don't expect it to last forever anyway.  When this band fails, I'll probably just put the original rubber strap back on.  Good value for the money, but I won't buy this again -- not for this watch, anyway."
4.0,Can’t clear out the review window.  The outfit looked great through the bag.  But didn’t I package because plans changed and didn’t need it.
4.0,"I bought a small, 5’3 109 lbs. the bottoms fit great but the top is pretty tiny! It rides up in the back and the knot in the front isn’t very comfortable if you’re laying on your stomach. The top also barely covers everything"
4.0,"This band was honestly the only 23mm band I could find in my search. However, it fits my watch perfectly and I am pleased with how exact I was able to adjust the wrist size. I only wish it were a bit heavier...its rather lightweight. But my watch has some heft to it so I don't notice it much while wearing. *thumbs up*"
4.0,"Positives: especially for the price, these glasses are actually quite sturdy. They are not crooked or loose, and they are comfortable to wear. I really like the shade color and protection I get from the lenses.<br /><br />Negatives: the outside color of the lens (I ordered the rose gold) is not quite right. It's striking, and not necessarily in a good way, although this is a taste level. They DEFINITELY stand out in a crowd, if that's what you're looking for! I will say, the more I look at them, the more I like them."
4.0,This is the fourth pair we've owned. My son loves them.  They are comfortable and wear well.  Very durable.<br />If<br />You size them up. They run small.<br /><br />Order at least a half size larger or more.
4.0,Good quality don’t care for the fit.
4.0,"As with all Allegra K products, order a size up and double check your measurements or you're gonna be disappointed. That said, I've ordered four shirts from them and I love every single one of them. This particular top has like zero stretch to it which makes it stand out from the other three I own, so keep that in mind if you're wanting a more baggy look. That said, it doesn't really drape like the shirt in the picture and the cut at the bottom is more symmetrical; I'm not entirely sure that what I got is made of whatever material is in the picture. The shoulder holes are also a bit smaller than what's pictured, but being that the model is much smaller than I am, that's probably par for the course; they're still really cute, so its not really a negative for me.<br /><br />All in all I personally like this shirt and it's long enough (I'm 5'5&#34;) for me to wear comfortably with leggings as well."
4.0,yes I like
4.0,Good product. I wish it was a little thicker material but it does what it says . I recieved this as a promotional item. I would buy again
4.0,"For sure, will need a slip under this dress. But it is quite lovely on. Very feminine."
4.0,"I so want to give this a 5 because it’s such a beautiful suit but I thought it came with the straps like the picture shows, I got it because it has straps in the picture... A little upset about that..."
4.0,I like this shirt.  The fabric is light but not flimsy.  The lace holds up well after washing.
4.0,Needs to be just a little bigger
4.0,I bought this in black and pink in medium. I am 5'2 and 125. I received the black bottoms. They same to fit nicely. Look really cute on and cover my bottom well. I won't be wearing these for a couple of months. I'm still waiting for the pink bottoms. My only complaint so far is they came in what looks like a reused bag and were bunched up in the bag. I'm hoping the wrinkles in the material isn't permanent
4.0,"Super cute, great price, glad I purchased these! :)"
4.0,Great turtleneck<br />Just a lot larger then expected....<br />Great seller<br />Thanks .....
4.0,A little smaller than expected but nice. It was a gift and she loved it..
4.0,"I usually wear a size small or medium, so I ordered a medium because I read the sleeves were small. I should have ordered a small because the medium is a little too big. But I still love the shirt!"
4.0,They were beautiful but a few stones were missing. The stones are very small so look them over. They charged a fee for sizing. I thought it should have been included. Was not pleased with the seller. I will continue to buy from Amazon but not the seller
4.0,"Fabric does not stretch very well to go overhead nor does the elastic band work well, a little loose.  The product was the correct size overall and the loved to the color."
4.0,Very nice fitting dress. I wore it to a winter wedding and was very pleased. I am 5’3 and weigh 137lbs and got a medium.
4.0,These are nice items and stretch pretty good. Because of the sheerness they are a little on the thin side. But they are true to their size
4.0,"Very nice sleeve, beautiful colors and material. Maybe the fabric is a little bit thin for my taste but it is ok. Great quality"
4.0,Muy buena terminacion.
4.0,"Little smaller than anticipated, but nice."
4.0,"Very comfortable and stretchy, but the fabric is a little thin - probably will wear it at home more than out in public / to the gym. Not bad overall."
4.0,"I've had them for over a year, and they're starting to fall apart at the seams.  The foam has compressed, and isn't as luxurious as when I first got them.  But they're still comfortable and I like them.  I'm not sure if I should expect a pair of slippers under $20 to last more than a year.  But I kind of did!  They've had pretty much daily use for about 14 months, with some outside uses on driveways/sidewalks, etc.  So they're good.  But, I'll probably be buying another pair, or searching for a different brand.  Just to see whats out there.<br /><br />Don't expect these to last as long as normal shoes.  But when they do last, it's worth it.  Really, if it's $20 bucks a year, for comfy slippers, I'm down.<br /><br />I've used some shoe glue that lasted a bit, but now they're blown out like a tire you'll never be able to repair.<br /><br />Worth the money."
4.0,Daughter has worn them 2 days.
4.0,I absolutely love this and was impressed by the quality. I expected some dinky metal that would tarnish almost right away but it is actually really well sealed! The backs of the charms are sealed with a shiny black so they are smooth which is a huge plus for me. The front image quality on the charms however is only okay. Some look really good and others their skin or hair color leaked over into their eye. Also weirdly enough Sabo is the only charm that is him as a kid. I am guessing the bracelet was designed before his adult look was released but it is still strange. Charm sizes are oddly varied as well.
4.0,"I like it!  I have been wearing hair bands around my wrist for years and I've gotten tired of them being too tight, or staying wet after washing my hands.  This bracelet is super practical and it looks nice, too.  Pro-tip: Bracelet is too small to go over your hand.  Slide it on through the opening directly over your wrist, then when you put the elastic on, it will keep the bracelet from falling off.  Only thing I think could be improved would be to make the indentation for the elastic a bit deeper.  The elastic doesn't nearly lie flush with the edges and the elastic will come out of place on occasion."
4.0,Cute.<br />Leopard portion is a bit faded looking.. I<br />I'd say to order up a size.
4.0,These look great but they're huge. I got them for my 7 year old and she can only wear them for a short time because oth the weight.
4.0,My daughter loves the show and the PJs - she is 2 and a half : )
4.0,Pretty necklace. Nice quality. Fashionable.
4.0,"My Wrist measures 5.5"" around and this bracelet is definitely too large for me. Otherwise, bracelet is as expected."
4.0,"Great product and quality, I’ve bought almost all their Gold’s gym shorts. These run longer and thicker in material which I don’t like. Considering the zipper, where I would use this for a cardio workout, I think the material should be thinner. Regardless I have two colors and will use them. The fit it right for me, I’m 5’9 200 pounds very muscular and lean 31 waist and the medium of this line is the perfect fit."
4.0,Fits my bill.
4.0,This is a very nice romper but the size is off. It is wayyyy too big!
4.0,"Really does make you sweat when you’re active. Don’t wear tight shirt with it, a tad bit bulky."
4.0,"I bought this in a medium, I wanted to go with a large because I wanted a loose fit, thank God I listened to the reviews and went with a medium Igot the loose fit with the medium. I normally wear a size 8. The material is very nice not to stuff not to soft."
4.0,Very Good…
4.0,The fabric is very light which is nice for summer outdoors activities
4.0,The jigs were scratched and the toe of a sock was messed up. So we have 1 unusable sock
4.0,My rubric cube gu loved them!  His math teacher wife was disappointed that they were not accurate....too many read squares....not true to a real cube
4.0,Definitely size up one size!
4.0,"These lanyards are handy dandy!! What a great idea! I normally leave my mask in every room I go into at work. Today, I kept up with it and felt safe knowing it was not cross contaminated."
4.0,"This is a nice, lightweight bucket hat that is perfect for playing tennis or taking a hike on a sunny day.  The graphics are very attractive and stylish as they are not overdone in the least, plus they look great on the black fabric the hat is made of.  The hat itself seems well constructed and should hold up well to outdoor activities. I have found it to be a little more snug than expected, even though I measured my head to be sure of sizing when I ordered it, but even still it fits okay.  All in all it’s a very nice addition to my tennis attire."
4.0,"I love the versatility you get with these pants! I wear them when I photograph weddings and so far I’m very pleased. They don’t really wrinkle, and they stay up great since they have the elastic in the waist. The material itself isn’t my favorite, but it’s tolerable.<br /><br />Bought them in XL"
4.0,Cute light soft and comfortable. Will buy an other
4.0,"I wear size large on my t shirt ( Polo Ralph Lauren). I ordered xl on this because i always think bigger is better than smaller.<br />Unfortunately the xl is way too big. I should just have ordered large or probably medium because the xl is really big for me.<br />I got no issues with the material.<br />Its warm when used.<br />Hood can be unzipped and be removed.<br />Price is not cheap. I think its a little expensive for $75.<br />Overall, quality wise, im happy with it.<br />Price, not so much. I’ll probably buy this thing if its $50.<br /><br />PS: the company logo is embroidered on the front chest area and its pretty annoying.<br />It says, Laiwang !! WTH. So made in china!!!"
4.0,even though its a bit small i still like it. not much more to say its a sandal it does what i bought it for.
4.0,"I read the size chart, and then reviews on other items from the brand, I am so happy I sized up because this throw on bralette was snug, I can't imagine ordering my size it would have fit way too small.<br />That said, the packaging on this didn't say anything about it being from Shapermint, instead all the labels say truekind.<br />The description says it has non-removable pads, but to be sure they remove and move, and fold weird. I spend my initial time getting them smoothed out when I put this on.<br />Once on, yes, it's comfortable. Offers great support, doesn't dig into my shoulders - but the shoulders don't adjust so if you have narrow or high shoulders that could be an issue.<br />The back interior has a sort of velvet flocking, I don't notice it when I'm wearing it, and it doesn't make my back sweat either.<br />All in all its a very comfortable, no wire, easy on option. I think the price is a little on the high side for it, but I can see ordering this again."
4.0,Didn't mess up hair but flattened it ran a bit small for me I'm 6ft 160 lb and have shoulder length hair I would def buy again IF had size options available
4.0,These are great looking glasses but they don't fit over my glasses so I can't wear them and I'm disappointed because they are really pretty.
4.0,"I don't understand why mens jewelry is always so big! It is still an awesome piece, so much so I ended up buying myself one. But it is so big and chunky!"
4.0,The dress was really cute but it was just a little bit too casual for the occasion I need it for.
4.0,I live in a warm climate so this will work almost year round... it is rather thin. It’s not what I’d consider comfy because it’s not very soft. But it’s not hard or itchy either.
4.0,"Small, cute and perfect for carrying around little things"
4.0,I love it especially after I put all my patches on it! Would have gotten five stars however extra large fit like a large so I had to send it back and order a double XL. I don't wear a double XL in anything. Order one size bigger than normal.
4.0,Nice quality but long and a little big for me
4.0,"Ordered 2. Bit tight fitting, but they work, and they haven't been broken yet by my kids who leave things out to be stepped on, so that says a lot to me at least. ;)"
4.0,"We like these simple style masks. They are comfortable to wear and work well in most situations. We haven't tested the washable aspect, but otherwise, we are pleased with this selection."
4.0,"I'm 160lbs 5""2 got medium and were extremely tight"
4.0,"Love the look and fit, but the lens shown, which is my favorite--is already scratched up."
4.0,Was hard to hook at first but now it’s almost worn out—time to replace
4.0,"The style is somewhere between casual and suitable for the office.  The neck is pretty and delicate, but the pockets are too casual and protrude, making the waist look large which is not flattering for most women.  The waistband is scratchy. I wouldn't wear this dress without an undershirt.<br />4 stars"
4.0,It's beautiful and fits well.
4.0,"Just got it today I tried it on and I love it! The material is nice not see through at all, it’s warm & the color is vibrant. Can go well with heels or a pair of sneakers. I can’t wait to wear show it off at the office Christmas party. Amazon for the win again"
4.0,The charm is beautiful and seems to be made of good quality metals. I like it I just wish I knew it was going to be so big!
4.0,"Excellent product , my son is happy :)"
4.0,"This item is very pretty but is somewhat small.  It is tight around the chest, it is very short for me.  I use it as a shirt instead of a dress, not as long as shown in the picture.  Nice colors."
4.0,The shirt is a pretty color but the arms are a little short. I ordered up to an XL and wish I had gotten it even larger.
4.0,Great jacket‼️
4.0,"This watch band was extremely long. The quality was excellent, but I couldn't remove the links so it's still in it's box."
4.0,"I bought two sets of these and when you first open the package, the smell is obnoxious, but that dissipates very quickly.  One set is not as good as the other but when I wear the cloth ones I think I get compliments every time I wear these and they are super comfortable."
4.0,Good quality socks that usually keep my feet warm. It would be nice if the socks were a little thicker as I sit in an office with the A/C on so my feet sometimes get cold. When I'm out and about the sucks are great. They fit well and seen like they will last a while.
4.0,"Easy to put on, and comfortable fit. A couple of times the gloves got torn as I was weeding and working on bird netting.; other than that, they performed well."
4.0,The necklace and earrings are great. Very pretty. The bracelet doesn't fit around the wrist very well.
4.0,Lenses arrived on time. Came in box with a carrying case for sunglasses. They were considerably thinner than the original Oakley lenses but they fit in my Batwolf frames well. Other than that I will not be able to provide anymore info because the lenses and glasses were both taken by the Atlantic Ocean on our labor day vacation!
4.0,Ordered an 8. Opened them up tried them on fit like a 10. Returned ordered a 7 fit like 8.5. Heavy socks and I’m ok.
4.0,"These are all really cute and are very fashionable. Some of them are a little small, but most of them fit and are comfy."
4.0,The skort is blue not green but the price is great. I buy so many different styles and colors to match my outfits but this is one of my favorite styles to play pickleball.
4.0,"they fit as expected, the packaging is really nice (resealable and neat), but I bought two orders with the assumption that I would get at least more than 4 colors. unfortunately I opened the package to disappoint as I got the same four colors for both orders. not sure if thats a product of ordering two at the same or if its not actually random. but I am a little disappointed with my purchase."
4.0,Nice dress but way too long.  Will have to invest in having it taken up.  I am 5 feet 4 inches so don't know why they have to make the dress another six inches longer so only a 6' person can wear it.
4.0,"Land's End quality, but full/regular cut more for older gentlemen, I feel.  Too full 'cut' for my taste..."
4.0,Nice shirt and cool but a little heavy but will wear spring and fall not deep summer.
4.0,The leather flap is too combursome
4.0,"I like this swimsuit. I wore it to a waterpark and had no problems so the quality is good.  I love the design and color however, the fit is why I gave it 4 stars. I'm 5'9 and 215lbs. I ordered a 2XL and I felt it fit but was a lil loose. I could probaly go down a size maybe."
4.0,I'm not sure if the gem is real or not but I enjoy looking at it and the sense of good energy it often brings. Now the necklace and silver wrapping is of cheap quality but about what I expected.
4.0,"Fits as expected, fabric is on the light weight side."
4.0,"I purchased this in the XL in Black. I liked it and I am not a super modest person, but since it was intended for a family gathering with people I didn't know well, I felt it was a little skimpy in the bum. Not bad just more than I wanted for this particular Gathering. That being said the front was def sexy but not too revealing. I wear a size 12 pants 38dd bust. 5' 4&#34;. I don't think if you were much taller than me this would work very well. And actually would have probably been a little more comfortable if there had been an XXL. It's getting returned but not a bad suit for the price. I saw it was down to $7 in the style I had. Definitely worth it for that :-)"
4.0,"I love the suit, but it definitely runs way small. My one daughter is very petite and I got her the normal size she would wear from a store.  I wish I would have gotten one to two sizes bigger. Super cute, thinner material, exactly what picture shows."
4.0,"Good quality, was smaller then expected."
4.0,"Cool bag, a bit bigger than I realized."
4.0,"Although in my opinion, not the best in the X-MEN franchise, I did enjoy the movie. Set in 1983, we find the younger cast of the X-Men movies coming into contact with an older mutant from the age of the pyramids. The humans of that era seem to worship him like that of a god.<br />Well, for some of them, he was not a god and try to assassinate him while in the midst of a &#34;transfer&#34; of power to a younger body.<br />We then move forward to current 1983 where we see Professor X and the younger cast of X-Men doing there thing at Xavier's school for the gifted.<br />I am not a comic book fanatic or reader of the X-Men comics, but I would have thought the four horseman could have been better selected and not well known.<br />One indication would have been who were the &#34;horsemen&#34; he used before? We saw a scene with him moving the stones into pyramids at the end of the credits in &#34;Days of Future Past&#34;. I'm sure they died off in some form, however.<br />The mutant is awoke by digging humans and his tomb comes into contact with the Sun. He wanders around the city and seeks out other mutants to aide in his &#34;recovery&#34; to a higher power for himself.<br />It's only a matter of time before the younger X-Men learn of his return and must confront him and his powers.<br />I really liked Mystique here and Quicksilver, but I wished there were more scenes of Mystique. Magneto has a good time being him, of course, tricked into becoming &#34;Apocalypse's&#34; pawn.<br />After a brief encounter by Mystique and Quicksilver, Magneto realizes he has &#34;family&#34; worth fighting for and a better future with the mutants.<br />** Special Features are ~<br />~ Deleted and Extended Scenes<br />~ Gag Reel<br />~ Wrap Party Video<br />~ X-Men Apocalypse Unearthed<br />~ Audio Commentary<br />~ Gallery<br />~ Theatrical Trailers<br />** STEELBOOK is pretty nice"
4.0,"Stayed on (didn't fall off) and looked good on my car, but my windows didn't not fit up into the door and so it whistled as we went down the road. Slightly annoying but not so bad that I took them off early."
4.0,"Love the watch. Hate the stiff chunky leather wrist band. Bought a stainless bracelet to make it workable. There goes the savings, but I'm now sewing it and enjoying it. Now it looks and feels great. Fullmosa bands are wonderful with great tools to adjust the band length."
4.0,Cute and looks nice
4.0,good value it gets noticed.
4.0,"The neon color Telics fit true but the black, brown, and navy  ones were too small even though they all were medium width."
4.0,"Nice earrings, but kinda cheep looking once you see them in person."
4.0,"fits nice in the waist and but, ( ha today the style  is above the ankle), I am 5'10&#34; these were 2&#34; above my ankle"
4.0,Great material. Crappy zippers (they both broke off after first day wearing them).
4.0,I like the necklace but I wish the stone wasn't so large.
4.0,"These are reasonably good horns. Not a hard hollow plastic, but a dense solid foam, which is more fragile, but its flexibility lends a little resilience and it's easier to attach to custom costumes. Something that wasn't clear to me from the pictures is that the colors seem a little unnatural. The tips are more blue than neutral."
4.0,"Super lightweight, good for cool but not ice cold weather"
4.0,"Fit watch great, was big around very small wrist though."
4.0,"There is no handle on my bag as shown in the picture. The handle is needed to get the bag out of the suitcase with one  hand. I will be returning it. I wonder if this one is just a fluke? Its too bad, its nice and roomy, lots of pockets, looks  well made other than the missing handle. **** It was a fluke, I will order another ***"
4.0,I like the concept but I didn't realize it was so thin.  I like flags with a little weight on them.  colors are not as bright as expected.  but it is a good quality flag for the price.
4.0,"La blusa me queda perfecto con el pantalón que tenía pensado, lo que hace un conjunto muy elegante para un cóctel. Pedí en L, peso 140 libras y mido 1.65 cm; sin embargo, me queda un poco grande de ancho, pero nada que una costurera no pueda arreglar. Buen producto!"
4.0,The arm sleeves are too tight
4.0,The dress is fitted near the bottom just like the picture and it is pretty loose in the middle. But it still gives a cute shape. I followed the other reviews when sizing. I like this dress and would recommend it.
4.0,Very cute. True to size but short.
4.0,These rings are pretty comfortable but they do ring a bit small so get a size better then your normal ring size. These rings are perfect for every day activities such as work or the gym.
4.0,I like the style and wish I'd found it when my baby was small. I'd have bought one in every color to wear as a nursing shirt as the wrap opens nicely for nursing. Very flattering cut. Not crazy about the color I bought though. The white has a &#34;cheap &#34; look and feel to it and is a bit sheer. Perhaps I would have been happier with a cream colored shirt instead. Would definitely buy again in a darker color though.
4.0,Clarity and sharpness of vision is great. The frame is a bit small although the size in the description is correct - it will not fit on larger glasses.
4.0,"This is a cute pair of slippers.  They are warm and the fabric is very soft.  It's a decently made pair of shoes.  The quality could be a bit better, but for shoes a child will outgrow quickly and won't be wearing for long periods at a time, they do very nicely.  The soles aren't completely slip proof.  The dinosaurs are adorable and the colors are great for kids."
4.0,"Fits well through body and in length. A little hard to get on and off because the fabric has no give—could use a button, zipper, or bit of elastic at the back of the neck. But I prefer that difficulty to having a bodice that gaps at the neck or sleeves. Most do, and this one does not.<br /><br />Lightweight but not see-through. True to color.<br /><br />Not linen, as you can see by the tag. I guess a small percentage of ramie (a linen-like textile made from Chinese nettles) is enough for Amazon to let them claim “linen”, but it’s a bit deceptive.<br /><br />Still, it’s a perfectly nice around-the-house dress and it has POCKETS! Good ones that fit your whole hand or phone."
4.0,These are a great fit. Took off a star because the waistband is a little on the snug side and while I am so happy for the pockets in these pants they are thick and take a long time to dry. I’m on the taller side so the pants hit at my ankles. But these are a cute classic look at a great price and so I bought a pair in two different colors. They stay soft after washing with no pilling so far.
4.0,I just needed a white belt of this type but the price of 3 compared to just 1 was hard to pass up. A good quality belt. I hope they would be a little longer but they’re not bad.
4.0,"These look great on,  but, wow, are they hard to get up my little ears.  Once there, they stay pretty well, and, as I say, look great."
4.0,"These earrings are EXTREMELY tiny.  I wasn't even sure they were going to stay in. I thought the stone would slip right through the hole.  They do have a nice sparkle.  I put them in a 3rd hole just so I had something small in there.  The posts are also a little short.  The pic shows them beside 2 other earrings in my ear, one is a 1/2 carat and one is a 1/4 carat to give you a comparison on size.  If you are looking for something that is barely there, this is the earring for you."
4.0,Fit good  only the pant its little short but its ok
4.0,these are nice gloves I use them at night driving a security golf cart and they work very well. there a little bit bulky if you have to stuff them in your pocket. but for extended wear they're very comfortable.
4.0,cute -- way too large (I ordered up and not sure that was necessary).nn
4.0,Love the style and colors.
4.0,Liked the dress very much. Runs very small.
4.0,Love the sandel.
4.0,This top would be much more attractive if it were a few inches longer. It's about 24&#34; long in the back from neck to hem. I think it looks somewhat boxy on me but I do like the mix of patterns in the fabric. Some of the fabric has a picture of the Eiffel tower. Other pieces of fabric have a lovely floral pattern. It's a very fun piece to wear with a simple t-shirt underneath.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, too large for me, will be returning, but quality was good."
4.0,"I am so sad, I really like the dress but it just runs too small.  I’m 5’9” and normally wear a 16/1x.  This was just way too small.  I bought the XXL.  It was also really short.  For the price though it’s super cute and for the average person I think it would look great.  I just think anyone over a size 12/14 this just wouldn’t fit."
4.0,👍very nice!
4.0,"Quality was not as expected, hoodie is thinner than expected"
4.0,"Its not that it was too small. Its the ribbon thats tied around the dress. The ribbon is sewed onto the dress. Thus keeping u from fitting into it. I am a broad shoulder big girl. It would have fit if it wasnt for the ribbon. The ribbon is wraped from the front sewed on the right and left sided of the body. I went ahead of snipping the ribbon.  Once i didn that it fit well. But it was a little loose lookung from the back. It looked like it needed the ribbon. My best advice is if it doesnt fit. Snip the ribbon from the front first. So u can see if it looks better for u to tie from the back. Because i didnt think ahead , now i have to buy a sash ribbon."
4.0,"Very cute shoes. I could do without the frayed white tie that is covering the flowers. It looks like a sweatshirt tie. Luckily, it can easily be removed with a seam ripper and they look much better without."
4.0,I purchased this shirt for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.  He love the fit and the feel.  I did buy him an xl shirt when he usually wears medium or large shirts but we could tell from the picture that this shirt fit a little smaller than most.  He now wants the red one.
4.0,"Love this zippered hoodie, fits as expected. Comfortable and lightweight. Hard to find in stores."
4.0,Bought for my niece. Very cute
4.0,"I suggest order a size bigger. They are very tight, but work very well."
4.0,"Beautiful dress! Too big!! Ahhh! After reading reviews I thought I should go way up in size. I'm 5 &#34; 4', 156 . It's a tent . I would have been fine with a large. Will get alterations done."
4.0,They are nice and soft. Like the long legs. Ride up a little more than I would like.
4.0,"I like it but I should have gotten a medium, got a small. Very snug. it’s kinda sheer but not super noticeable because of the pattern."
4.0,My daughter loves the shoes. She does not wear them very often so I am not sure about the durability.
4.0,"This fits ok, but does slip down when I wear my glasses."
4.0,"Great design and material quality! Fits right. If you like loose fit, order one or even 2 sizes larger."
4.0,"I was a little worried when the hat arrived as it had been squashed into a plastic shipping bag and then crammed in our mailbox, but we were able to reshape it easily.  It was too big as well, but after applying both strips of foam rubber that were supplied as sizing tools, it now fits.  Time will tell whether or not it provides the advertised sun-block and water repellency.  After reshaping it, it does look like the picture in the advertisement and seems to be well-made.  I would probably give it five stars if not for the poor manner it was packaged and shipped."
4.0,"I like these shorts- they prevent any thigh rubbing but they were a little thicker than I was expecting. Oh well, they work and are fairly comfortable."
4.0,You have to assemble each one of them. Not difficult to assemble but don’t  wait until the last minute to do it or you will get them all wrinkled and dented.  Pretty much is common sense on how to assemble but know it has no instructions. Great for the price and sturdy
4.0,My wife loved the way it fit. I love the way it fits and looks on her. She say its very comfortable when we go play golf.
4.0,Loved the dress. . Has a stretchy material
4.0,"The description says each pair comes with a microfiber bag. I ordered a three pack and got no bag. But hey, at this price point, I really don't mind. I would only recommend that the description should be more accurate.<br /><br />The glasses themselves are lightweight, with spring temples and a mirror finish that makes it impossible to see your eyes.<br /><br />I've ordered six pairs total, with two getting damaged beyond use. They have never fallen apart or had any manufacturing defect.<br /><br />As far as style goes, it doesn't matter how cheap aviators are. They always look cool."
4.0,"Great quality watch. Warning, 50mm is huge. However, I got used to it quick. If you want a unique watch that makes a statement. This is it. Amazon's method of  shipping is second to none! 4 stars because i do not like the tick of the second hand. I knew that before i bought it."
4.0,"I don't like the collar at all on this one, but the rest of it is okay."
4.0,They were as advertised. Came packaged very well. Would recommend.
4.0,"This bag is as described, however I did not receive the US flag patch.  The delivery was delayed. I use this as my EDC.  Other than the patch and deliver delay I'm pretty happy with the bag. Loads of compartments"
4.0,This Howl's Moving Castle poster is one of the better posters I've purchased on Amazon. Compared to other posters (besides the two other Ghibli posters I purchased) this one crushes them in quality.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01EI7JNOE CGC Huge Poster - My Neighbor Totoro Movie Poster Studio Ghibli - STG019 (24&#34; x 36&#34; (61cm x 91.5cm))]]<br />[[ASIN:B01EI7JAV0 CGC Huge Poster - Kiki's Delivery Service Movie Poster Studio Ghibli - STG015 (24&#34; x 36&#34; (61cm x 91.5cm))]]<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Printed on thicker paper than most posters sold on Amazon that feels more &#34;quality&#34;.<br />• Colors are vibrant and match the provided image.<br />• Arrived in a thick cardboard art tube that provided excellent protection.<br /><br />Cons:<br />• White border around the poster is annoying.<br />• A bit blurry (not pixelated) but it isn't noticeable from more than four feet.
4.0,It looks great and won’t break if caught on a door handle. I will need to get used to wearing it because I brush up against counters and cabinets when I walk past and I get stuck on the handles.
4.0,I liked the glasses. I gave it 4 stars because I didn't like how they looked on me. No complaints about the product.
4.0,The leggings fit amazing and are true to size. They’re also very comfortable and not see through. However the color is not accurate.
4.0,I like the way this suit holds up in clorinated water. Keeps it color and shape.
4.0,Runs small but ordered larger size than I wear and it looked nice on me.
4.0,The tie around the waist hides a lot<br />Love this
4.0,"I ordered these patches for a Star Wars Dark Side Run at Disney.<br /><br />These patches are very similar to the Imperial insignia, and so I intended to sew them onto a lightweight, black running jersey as opposed to buying a prefab costume that would most likely be uncomfortable.<br /><br />While I intended to sew one of these patches onto the jersey, it was easier just to iron it on because of the iron-on adhesive on the back of the patch.  What was nice about the adhesive is that since I wanted to use the jersey for other running events or working out, it was easy to remove. I simply heated up the jersey and moistened it, and it was easy to peel off without damaging the workout material.<br /><br />I received a few compliments on the jersey since nobody else had one like it, and the jersey kept me cool. It just had the Star Wars Imperial logo for the run, and it looked pretty cool with my black running pants and black running hat."
4.0,reminds me of the purse I carried in High school.
4.0,"I went extra extra large so I could wear with leggings, and its a very cozy shirt."
4.0,"The V cut is SUPER low, but it was a quick fix with a small safety pin. Other than that, the outfit is so cute and fit great. I wear a small in most clothes, and this fit true to size. The material is light and comfortable to wear all day. I would definitely buy again!"
4.0,"Okay the minus a star was for the rude seller. I had an exchange with them and compared to other Amazon sellers, I was not happy. Unfortunately, I bought the dress and then they responded to me. Either way, the dress is amazing! I wore it to Vegas and got a lot of attention. The pictures are right, the slit is very high. I got an extra large and it fit a little snug. The Fabric is stretchy so it fit fine, just a little tighter than I'm used to. I'm 5'3, 190 lbs and 38D boobs. Again, it fit great! Just snug. I would definitely recommend this dress. I drove out to downtown LA to find a dress like this. You won't fin this amazing style, for this price."
4.0,Looks better in the pictures but not bad overall
4.0,"good quality, over priced as usual, chemistry content is HIGH!!! ... wool content is going down and down and down, it may hit zero eventually..."
4.0,El producto muy bonito y el servicio muy bueno con el envio.Gracias😎
4.0,Love these- they're small but cute. Be careful though because the point piece will fall off when putting them on and off.
4.0,"I like the shirt the only issue I have is the sleeve ruffles a little. The shear part is not straight on the arms it lays gathered together Ed, but overall I like the shirt."
4.0,The fit was as expected just not to good for large busted women.
4.0,The skirt fit well. Just need to be cut off. Waiting on my semester. Thanks
4.0,"My grandpa loved this gift he called me the second he got raving in awe about it, he thought we had had it personally engraved that's how beautiful this watch came in, also came in a gorgeous condition and it was easy to set the time as he was doing that as he was talking to me. I reccomend this watch for anyone he needs a gift for your grandpas birthday or even a Father's Day gift."
4.0,I like this dress and am going to re-order a size down. I am NEVER a medium and will be returning my L for a M (I am a size 12 and 5'7) so definitely order atleast a size down. But excited for the new dress this was cute and comfy! great go to throw on casual dress
4.0,you can clearly tell dark spots and the chain is crap but the gift went over well.
4.0,"I ordered these last minute to head to Electric Forest with them. Unfortunately I didn't get them until the Monday after the event, but I'm sure I can find a good use for them.<br /><br />Only reason for the 4 is the straps can come out of the lights rather easily."
4.0,"Love the color, love the style. I just didn't expect it to be jersey material. I decided to keep it as a casual top, going to the store type of thing. Colors are fun to wear."
4.0,Worth the money but the posts are a little long.
4.0,"I'm 5'7&#34; and about 165 lbs. The large fit perfectly. When I pulled them out of the packaging, they looked way too small, but they're perfect. Already washed them and wore them to work, and bending and lifting and running around for hours didn't cause any issues. They stay up, they don't rub or hurt anywhere, and the material is nice and thick. Will buy in more colors."
4.0,"I am very happy with this purchase. I wanted a &quot;man-sized&quot; pendant and this fits the bill. The pendant is 1.75&quot; in diameter and has some weight to it. It needs a heavier chain, as seen in the photo. The wife says I look &quot;gangsta&quot; when wearing it, but I don't know about that. There was no delay in receiving the item. I will purchase from Kemetart again."
4.0,I like these BUT if you have any kind of a butt at all....they may be too small.  These are not really geared for curvy girls.  Still super cute though.
4.0,Go half size up!!..
4.0,Take 2 size bigger
4.0,this was cute for hanging out with the lady on the way to the mall get ur size im 230 and it fit like i got shape.
4.0,Sizes are bigger than stated had plus over 5 years and sizes were to big
4.0,"It is a nice size, has 3 zipper compartments, the only thing I would say is it NOT, Prince Purple, which disappointed me seriously."
4.0,"It's a little different from the pic. The writing is a brownish color instead of the black lettering that appears here. Kinda cheap looking, was hoping for better quality. Guess that's why it was only $10."
4.0,Bigger than expected but still cute.
4.0,If you skinny with somewhat of a butt you can’t even size down because yo ass will be hanging out. But other wise it’s good.
4.0,"Excellent product, but instructions should be provided with it.  It took be a while to figure it out.  The instructions on the Amazon web site are too small to read or see."
4.0,It well made but I hope it little small<br />Is their a little bigger one
4.0,"I haven't had the belt long, so not sure how it will hold up over time which is why I gave it a 4 versus 5 star rating.  Nice looking-just as pictured.  It was very easy to adjust the size.  I wasn't quite clear on how to do it from the enclosed instructions, but I watched a video online and the process only took a couple of minutes."
4.0,fits and looks good!
4.0,"amazing winter gloves. keep your hands super warm, i even drove motorcycle in NJ winter without glove liner but no issues what so ever. however, its bit too bulky and i never seem to click the right icon on phone."
4.0,Good looking dress at a good price.
4.0,"The shoes look nice but expect your big toes to poke through the shoes because of the soft material. They're pretty hard to put on, but I'll make it work because i got them on the low."
4.0,"Guoer makes quality caps and matching masks that I use regularly in my job as a professional pet stylist.  Keeps off the drool, dander, and flying undercoat!  Cute fabrics, and fits my head great.  I only wish they would take off the plastic toggle in the back, not needed with the sewn in elastic."
4.0,"I liked the material and design. But, the sizing was way off."
4.0,"Great, love it, except for the clasp. Very hard to put on/take off."
4.0,"Love the shirt, very comfy. Material is soft. The fit was just a little big at the shoulders for me think I should have got a small. I’m 5’4 130lbs"
4.0,Material seems a little things but we'll see.
4.0,Very nice good quality arrived very fast very pleased with the purchase on concern would be the chain it self
4.0,Love the design. I wish it fit my sons arm a little better. It was still large around the top.
4.0,This item was bought as a gift.  The recipient loved it and awaiting an occasion to wear it.
4.0,it’s a little big the large fits like an extra large
4.0,I brought a size medium yellow dress for my mother and she loved it so much we got her the black one. It flatters her curvy yet petite shape very well and the pearls give it a classic touch. The only complaint ahe had was the seam on the shoulders were sew a little sloppily. She is overall very happy with the product though. I will be ordering the pink dress for myself next!
4.0,Very good feel and look for the money. So far so good!
4.0,"Just what I have been wanting and looking for! They are so pretty, the perfect size and made well. A bargain buy! My only reason for the 4 stars is the earring backs. They are too small and too loose. I had to change them out for some off of another pair that I own."
4.0,It's ok top lid doesn't fit snug
4.0,"First a little about my history with sunglasses.  I generally hate them.  Well, I love the look of them - on other people.  Than I wear them and I hate them.  Or I wear them, like them, and then find they hurt my nose or give me a headache 30 minutes later.  I have ONE pair of sunglasses that I like and that seem to like me back.  But when I saw these, I just loved the look of them!  They are completely unique and I just had to try them out.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that these glasses are VERY light, so the likelihood of them hurting your nose or pinching you causing a headache is very minimal.  I found them to be very comfortable.  The con to their light construction is that I worry about there ability to withstand a drop...and I'm clumsy.  That's the only reason I'm not going full 5-star, but in reality I would say these are like 4.5.<br /><br />The light grain wood pattern on the rims looks even better in person and the blue-gray color of the sides is every bit as eye-catching as I'd hoped.  The tint of the glasses is a bit reddish when you look AT them, but I don't see a reddish color when I'm looking THROUGH them.  They cover my eyes well enough to protect from the sun, but aren't big enough to make me look like an alien.<br /><br />An unexpected bonus is the incredible box they come in.  Fantastically made, sharp looking, and worth toting your sunglasses around in."
4.0,"Watch bands are great... tool bent by the time I was done removing all links, Did not get screen protectors!!!! Told me how to install but NO protectors, so that was disappointing"
4.0,Really cute as a coverup and material is good for a beach bag and still looking decent!
4.0,"The gloves worked out really well.  They were padded (could padded more, but they did the job).  They are comfortable, and they kept my hands cool while biking. It also made shifting a whole lot easier that twisting the shifter with sweaty palms."
4.0,"Cute! Fit, color and style were all as expected."
4.0,Great buy! It was just what I wanted.
4.0,The necklace itself was really pretty. The hourglass was surprisingly larger then I thought it would be. I actually took it off and wore the necklace bare. The quality was great. It didn't feel flimsy at all.
4.0,This dress is very pretty! And comfortable for a casual bbq or outdoors event..the top runs a little small..so go up a size..it’s not a Calvin Klein dress but with a nice Spanx or slip under it you will be ok..I got several compliments on this dress ..Try it you might like it!! P.S I’m very picky...😊
4.0,Look like the picture!
4.0,Thought it would be heavy sweater like
4.0,I have been looking for some time for a purse with kiss clasp closure . Love the small size and easy access . I removed the long strap as it gets caught when closing .
4.0,Product came quickly! Happy with my purchase
4.0,"So it's bigger than expected and yes it might be a problem for people with thin fingers because it's adjustable and a bit heavy. But since my fingers are chubby I made it work and it's stays in place, plus it's the perfect combination for the necklace I bought."
4.0,"I love these leggings, I ordered the fleece lined grey and they keep me warm. The fit is great, I like how high waisted they are, the help hold my belly in. Sometimes the waist is too low on my wants and it's not flattering but these are very high. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because they have developed pills from friction between my thighs."
4.0,"Will definitely be warm and fits fine. It came with a plastic smell, but I always wash things before I wear them anyways so, overall I’m satisfied.<br /><br />Update: smell came out in the wash and it worked great to keep the cold out!"
4.0,It came quickly and is true to color. I bought the navy suit in 8-10 but should've gone up to 12-14. It's tight but wearable and will be fine for vacation. Flattering on my tummy but a bit short....it's pulling my boobs down a bit.
4.0,"Could have been better packing , but my mom did love the hat"
4.0,"I like all the features, except for the built in light. You press the button, a corner of the watch is displayed and when you release the button, it shuts off. Not good for when I need it in the dark. I recommend having either the entire screen lit or the numbers lit for several seconds. Other than that, I highly recommend this product. It's simple."
4.0,"Liked the shirt but it didn’t like me.  Color is fine, buttons add a little detail but the overall fit was a little snug and I ordered a size bigger. I refuse to go two sizes bigger"
4.0,"The material isn't as &#34;breathable&#34; as like, however, the quality is excellent."
4.0,"Fits as expected, color is more of a brighter orange than peach. Had nicely lined cups, although a little stiff! Overall, cute retro style though and great price!"
4.0,"These pins are awesome.  Unfortunately, they were not adequately packaged for shipping, so one pin stem was broken off completely, while the other was bent to the point of being nearly broken.  I'd also note that since the stems are basically screws with no backing, had they not broken and I tried to wear them, I'd have a screw tip jabbing me in the neck.  Ultimately, I just picked up a couple of magnets to affix them to my collar and they worked perfectly."
4.0,arrived well ahead of the date given by Amazon. This looks good from about arm length away. Up close you can tell it's rubber with metal. One really can't complain for the price. I mean you pay more for a pack of gum. One con is this has a very nasty rubber/plastic smell you take it out of the package. Hopefully it will go away soon. I don't plan on wearing it until then. I don't want anyone to smell the manure like odor.
4.0,Beautiful necklace. Nice quality!
4.0,Exactly what I expected it to be.
4.0,Beautiful and I love them
4.0,I was disappointed that they didn’t come with a case. Whenever I’ve bought Peepers brand in stores they always came with a fabric case.
4.0,"It was a little tight, but I was able to fix it. It worked out and I am happy with it."
4.0,This is honestly a pretty good shirt for the price. It's strangely snug at the bottom but it's still wearable. The material feels pretty cheap but it looks like chiffon so unless you touch it you can't really tell. I've worn it and washed it and it held up fine.
4.0,I wore this to a graduation event. I’m 5’10 and the length was perfect on me. Love the pockets. Looked like a boutique dress. The only thing was the Jersey material liner clung really bad to my body and I had to use static guard.
4.0,"Look good, bright colors"
4.0,Material is good but not enough depth and not fit well
4.0,"Really cute as pictured, but note that black began chipping soon after I began wearing it, but to be expected for this low cost."
4.0,"Cute dress with stretchy and comfortable material, but we threw away the ears-- Minnie doesn't have weird little red polka dot ears.  Also the bow is separate and on a safety pin, for you to add yourself."
4.0,I love the material  and it is great as a headband.  I bought it so I could use it as a headband and a mask.  Does not work as a mask.  The pictures of using it as a mask solid me on it and am disappointed in that.
4.0,"The fabric and fit were good. I’m about 5’5” 130 lbs, and the small worked fine on me. I do wish it was a little longer though. It’s about ankle length and I wish it was floor length. If I sized up though then the top would be too loose. The pockets are an awesome touch!"
4.0,"Just adorable my friends daughter loves spinning in dresses and the colors are wow, she loved it so did mommy!"
4.0,"Good construction. A little bigger than you might think. So be ready, they are large lenses."
4.0,"Nice product, works for me, got xl runs small can’t button but don’t need to"
4.0,Stylish and a good price! NO MORE RX SUNGLASSES!
4.0,I bought this for my special needs adult daughter that has trouble wearing a mask.  This works great for her when we are out in public.
4.0,Nice material with good draping. A bit longer than I expected but I love it
4.0,My mom approves of these.  She's 5'3 and size 8-10 so these fit her perfectly.  Light and stretchy and has two side pockets.  A bit on the thinner side so good for those warmer days.
4.0,Nice piece considering the price point. I bought it based on its pop culture history. 5 stars if the light was anything useful.
4.0,Todo está bien la medidas me quedaron muy bien sólo que no era el color que esperaba era un color morado y me llegó un carmín bueno que puedo hacer para cambiarlo .<br />Aparte de eso una sola que no me agrada es que dejaron mi paquetes aventados en el patio  lleno de tierra y creo que no se vale  pudieron haberlos dejado dentro del buzón de ahí en fuera quede con una mala experiencia con respecto a las entregas ☹☹☹ si sólo cambiarán esa parte sería excelente les daria 5 estrellas pero por esta vez les doy 2
4.0,"The bands are cute, easy to switch out. The material seems decent. The only downside is that the size adjusting loop/buckle sits in an uncomfortable position when your wrist lays flat in a surface."
4.0,"It's a fun, modern take on Princess Leia! It is short and you definitely need to have something underneath. I ended up detaching the hood and used a button enclosure so I could decide whether or not I wanted to use it."
4.0,"It's perfect, except It's pricey"
4.0,Love it.  I bought it for my husband who is 6'5&#34; 251 lbs and he wears it every day.  Eventually the elastic band will wear out and snap but that could take up to a year.  Try not to wet it as that will make elastic fray quicker.<br />Great value for the price and a nice piece for male or female.  My husband loves it!
4.0,It was good and decent packaging the bracelet is thin as I wanted and it doesn't look like I thought it would but keep in mind not all will look them same and I kept this in mind. The string looks a bit cheap holding it together. I was looking for a deep red for the red coral but it comes orangish and red and others
4.0,"I love the shirt, very soft but runs a little big. I really like the look and style of the shirt."
4.0,Very cute.♡
4.0,"The suit was very cute. The hate that came with our purchase was not the hat pictured though, so that was a bit disappointing even though we didn't end up using it."
4.0,I have only worn the gloves to go clean off the vehicles when it snows. They have been great for that. Warm and dry and if I need to answer my phone or change the song I’m listening to it registers the gloves finger tips. The only reason I did not give solid 5s is I have not really put these to the test as far as water resistance at least.
4.0,"cute dress that could look good on variety of body types...unfortunatly it was too long for me, I'm 5' and the hem hit the floor, even in heels."
4.0,"a little sheer, but I like it"
4.0,Fits well and pretty colors. Looks like the picture.
4.0,"It looked a little better made in picture, thicker."
4.0,"THE PRICE WAS ON POINT BUT THE COLOR WAS A LITTLE OFF. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I LOVE THE HAT. IT GOES VERY NICELY WITH MY FUR COAT."
4.0,Buy a bigger size and your child will be comfortable & happy. Lovely bright colours.
4.0,"This is a gift for my grandson who joined the Army.  He has not worn it yet so this is based only on how the medal pendant looks.  Medal has very nice detail, it appears to be well made and the nickel should hold up in any weather or climate.  So at this point I am well pleased."
4.0,Good size and everything fits and is easy to access.  Leather is good but lining a little stiff and thin
4.0,"Although this dress looks really great on, the color is not as bright as the picture and the fabric is very rough on the skin. But it makes a great summer, beachy dress."
4.0,Ask for a size large but when I received it and try it on it look like a xL. All over nice fabric.
4.0,This top is very pretty and fits true to size.  It is a great length to wear with leggings.  The colors are very vibrant.
4.0,Cute back look and the way it looks with strappy heels. Would have preferred a lighter color but overall great look
4.0,Cute wear them a lot
4.0,My gal likes it. That's all that matters.
4.0,"This does not work for busty women. I am 36D and ordered a size L. Barely covered me. Bottoms are nice. Description is incorrect in saying that there is underwire support - there is no underwire. Company reached out and offered to remedy the situation by sending me a larger size. The product may not have worked out for me initially, but the customer service was excellent."
4.0,"This is a lovely bracelet.  It has a unique weave, and is pleasing to the eye.  My one worry is its length:  it's so long, I'm afraid it will slip from my wrist and I will lose it(it does slip, easily--I have a small wrist.).<br />I would have loved to be able to opt for a shorter chain."
4.0,"These nose rings are exactly as pictured. They are very small and are perfect for a subtle look. The only thing I do not like about these nose rings is the fact they are not screw back, they are a pin ,so be prepared to loose a lot of them. I go through these nose rings quickly since they are always falling out."
4.0,The fabric is a little thin but it does its job. The robes is exactly what i wanted a satin robe that is comfortable and nice to look at.
4.0,"It replaced my traditional wallet just fine with a much smaller footprint in my pocket.  This means to me that the leather in my old one took up at least half of the space.  Though I'm not typically worried about the electronic capture of credit card info, it is a perfect evolution of the capability."
4.0,"This is a good back but not very good back. Color is ok, But I like silver color more."
4.0,"As a disclaimer, I bought this on sale for 3USD here on Amazon. This watch doesn't seem to be sized for me -- I'm near the largest given band size and the watch face is seemingly disproportionate to my arm. Nevertheless, I like the look of the watch and it hasn't failed me yet. My only complaint is the toggle between 12 and 24 hr time is too easy -- my fat hand keeps bumping the button!"
4.0,Nice jacket..a little snug in the shoulder area but that might just be me
4.0,Great fit! Looks amazing for any casual wear. Material shrank a bit after one wash.
4.0,Seems like a female version due to how small it is.
4.0,"This works pretty well - I bought it for scrutinizing small print.  It would be good if the lens was a little larger, but I suppose it's the size it is because jewelers use it."
4.0,"Not a bad band the lugs feel a little loose as if there's a spring pushing it back but they're secure. The band is nice, I'm not the biggest fan of leather but it can be swapped out for another if you have the tools. The bumper case is enormous and the screen protector looks alright and feels smooth. I don't need it yet but will try it if my current tpu needs a change. All in all worth the $20 just for the lugs."
4.0,Took a few minutes to figure out how to put it on... a little combersome
4.0,it's a nice shirt and it's funny my husband likes it which is what I wanted I'm just a bit disappointed that the paint is already fading on the shirt and it's only been washed like four times and yes I washed it inside out. Hope this helps
4.0,Cute but arrived in small package - a wrinkled mess.
4.0,I bought these for my kids because they have more screen time than they should. They are 8 years old and reported they fit small and that they didn’t like the amber colored lenses because it changed the color of the screen. I’ll probably look for a larger sized pair with clear lenses.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:2b276968771d7cf3d10f73d889096423]] Fit JUST right. No extra room. I would order a size up
4.0,"These earrings are absolutely adorable!  They are the size of a dime (diameter) so hug your ear lobe nicely.  The center pink stone is the largest, the 2 purple stones are slightly smaller, and the 2 outter stones are the smallest.  Each stone is in a 4-prong setting and they are very securely seated in the prongs.  The open up on a hinge which was quite loose on my earring set, which is why I'm giving the 4-star rating.  They were very easy to get in my earring holes and they closed securely into the back.  I've been wearing them for over 24 hours and the are very comfy and haven't irritated my skin.  They do look just as nice in person as the do in the photo. If I do end up having any issues with these, I'll definitely update the review.<br /><br />I received these at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"This is a large tote with a nice zipper area on the inside. The colors are very beautiful, and the quality is good. This will make a nice gift for the Dragonfly collector in the family."
4.0,No complaints for the quality of the top and it looked good too. I always order medium size but it was little too big for me.
4.0,"Nice bike short, very comfortable to wear. Wish the hem have silicone gripper to prevent it from rolling up while biking."

THIS Goodthreads French Terry jacket is made of 100% HARDER & STIFFER cotton, so it fits a little tighter than expected & what I would have preferred. Therefore, if your size is similar to mine, & you prefer a comfortable fit, then take the next size up - medium.

4.0,"Have had this about 6 months and am very satisfied with it. Have gotten many compliments on the look of this watch. I like the minimal style of it yet it's impressive to see the display come alive with the animation and time display. I don't check time on it a very regular basis (calling up the pretty display is what will drain the batteries the most) but that said the original battery is still going. Minor cons - (1) the small leather loop that secured the long end of the watch band broke a while back - I installed a new band on the watch. There might have been an easier solution (2) doesn't keep especially accurate time (3) not likely you'll remember how to set the hours and minutes (so I just return to Amazon to read the methods shared in the reviews). How much do I like this watch? If it broke, I would buy another!"
4.0,"Good zippers, size and strap length.<br />Would have liked walker type pocket for ID, credit cards."
4.0,Ordered this frame for my daughter and she loved them!! Arrived on time and as described.
4.0,"Nice bag, a little larger than expected but I overall I'm happy with it."
4.0,One of the best gifts I've given my dad. I don't tell him enough that he is my hero and always will be. It's nice that there is a little piece of that on his keys as he goes to work everyday.
4.0,easy to use. Can not wear daily turns dirty looking after a few hours of wear
4.0,I was looking for new shades to buy and saw these and bought them. They are very nice and look good when sun is out.
4.0,"Arrived today 4 weeks ahead of schedule. Nice product! Absolutely love the color, which is exceptional because it's a subtle, greyish lilac & leans in the direction of a neutral shade. Looks exactly like pictured. I would have liked it to be a bit larger, as it's narrower at top, but it will still do nicely. The outer walls are unlined. The outside surface is smooth & inside it is sueded.  There is a large zippered pouch in the middle, not attached at the bottom. I put my cosmetic bag on one side, &  it does not seem to slide underneath the pouch due to the design & shape  of the bag. The large pouch is divided by another zipper opening in the middle. On one side there's a 3rd zipper & the other side has 2 slip pockets. The pockets could be a little deeper to hold my cell securely, because I  use one of the larger models, so I will probably use one of the other compartments for my phone. The large zipper is sturdy gold-tone metal, which operates easily &  looks very nice. The smaller zippers are nylon. This purse is notably lighter in weight than most leather ones in this size range, which is great. When I put my things inside I was pleasantly surprised at how much it holds, while still keeping it's slender profile... superb! And yes, it is genuine leather & has enough body to sit upright when you set it down. There is a very faint smell from the dye, which I expect will dissipate once it has a chance to air out. Overall I am very happy with this purchase & would definitely buy from this seller again!"
4.0,It fits perfect and it’s cute but in the back If I bend down you can see my butt. I suggest you to buy shorts if you buy this skirt. Yes it does have shorts underneath it but it’s too short. First time I ordered I got a medium and it couldn’t fit me so I ordered 2 sizes up and it fits me good.
4.0,"Very nice came on time , next time I will get a smaller size"
4.0,Accurate fit.<br /> Sturdy material.  Super cute details!
4.0,"The gloves are very warm, just what I needed. However, they started to pill on the fingers as soon as I wore them. Too bad!"
4.0,"The dresses are a little dated, but the Jr bridesmaids will hopefully bring them to life. The look was super off for my maids of honor."
4.0,"I like these for the most part, just a little too tight on the shoulders to me and I find it uncomfortable. Other than that they're pretty good."
4.0,"Nice shoes for my granddaughter, they look a lot like crocs, but half the price.  Which is great when you are talking children whose feet seem to always be growing."
4.0,The comfort of having these under a dress or skirt is nice as you don’t feel exposed when sitting in public or going up escalators and stairs and such.  However the cuff at bottom of leg is a little thick and I noticed you could see the shape of the cuff through my skirt.
4.0,I bought it for a friend who loves it and is very proud to be a Merchant Marine.  He wears if a lot...
4.0,Got for my son as a stocking stuffer
4.0,"We got these mini skirt and jean jacket sets for our little daughter and she says that she likes the Rose color, the button- end closure, the pockets and the elastic waistline of the skirt.<br />She says that her favorite features are the double stitching and the styling of the large collar.<br />She likes that they fit her perfectly well, and she says that they are comfortable to wear, easy to put on and take off as she needs to, and she says that she likes the fabric is breathable, soft, smooth to touch and gentle on her skin.<br />Our daughter does like that the skirt and the jacket match some of her shoes and fashion accessories."
4.0,"I loved it. Very cute, but it's cheap metal and unfortunately I couldn't wear it since I'm allergic to it. Had to give it to a friend instead.<br /><br />My left ear was swollen and red, but after taking them out, it healed just fine. (:"
4.0,I love love love them.<br />Was thinking about getting the real ray ban version but so glad I didn’t because these are way better price & they look pretty dang similar
4.0,Looks good and feels soft
4.0,"Bigger than I expected. It’s circumference is almost as big as a dime. I like this style of earrings smaller than this. Other than that the piece itself is nice, decent quality for the price and super shiny - which is what I like from my jewelry."
4.0,"The sock is very solid, very warm, a bit stiff.  There is a band, I guess used for arch support?, that is tight.  The toe compartment is very big, so much that if you have 8 toes on 1 foot, it would be comfortable.  While the description says men/women, the heel is resting above my ankle, so they seem to be larger than normal.  Husband likes them."
4.0,"These rings appear to be good quality. This is the first time purchasing anything like this. They are magnetic, depending which side you have both rings facing, they either attract or repel each other. I personally like the look of the textured ring, it has a slimmer profile. The plain ring is a little bit wider but still comfortable to wear. They are both smooth and have a nice weight to it. It's not heavy but it also doesn't feel like plastic. It came in a nice ring box that I can use for other types of rings. I hope I'll notice some benefits from wearing these rings."
4.0,Worked as advertised - for a Tough Mudder!
4.0,"Fun jacket definitely made for Junior women’s sizing -the cut is shorter in hits at the waist. This zips up the front and is a tad tight in the chest area. Ordered a large for my 18yr old daughter who is 5‘6“ -137lb, 36C and usually fits a large just fine.. again, loved the cut- just wish it had more room thru chest.  The arm length is adequate and Quality seems quite decent in Craftsmanship.<br /><br />This is down alternative- It is lightweight in the fill and therefore… Great for fall or warmer winter days. I would not recommend for winter sports or,<br />subzero temp.’s! It is light enough to pack into suitcase.. NO! it does not come with a pouch to it pack in but, it can condense quite small... any small bag will help contain it while traveling-<br />Ordered the red/black print.. and tbh, I was a little nervous to say the least. Thought it might look too childlike and actually, I am really like it. Perfect mix of color was black a little subtle and a little pop, perfect!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress and I like how the Coolibar dresses are cut and fit. However, this style fit slightly smaller than other Coolibar dresses."
4.0,"If you had blue skin like the film Avatar..and dared to wear this beanie, your nickname will be &#34;Papa Smurf&#34; in exactly 48hrs."
4.0,Prevents slipping if theirs room in the shoe. Does help with the fit of the shoe if slightly big.
4.0,Its decent
4.0,"The necklace gets many looks and comments. Everyone of all ages loves it. Now the time on the other hand, this doesn't fit any normal adult. It's made for infant hands."
4.0,"I bought them for my 12 years daughter , they fit and look awesome"
4.0,Good quality and neat.
4.0,"Bought as joke gift for sister. Everyone thought they were hysterical. Only issue was they didn't match - one fish was horizontal like in picture but other was vertical. Otherwise, cute"
4.0,"We bought the LaZebra Rainbow Dresses Kids Unicorn Costume Dress Party Headband Birthday Princess Tutu as a gift, so not sure how it will fit, but the tutu and unicorn headband are very pretty."
4.0,Nice quality shorts looks just like the picture  but some what small!!
4.0,"Purse is good size, nice amount of compartments etc BUT is NOT as pictured,  The gray is VERY light, not as dark as it appears so much more a spring/summer purse.  Very disappointed."
4.0,"Good quality. Feels like a nice t shirt. Is somewhat flattering but really hides everything but also is a little “too” big where it’s hiding it all. The fit is good, but all of the extra material is a lot. With all of that being said, I did order another color because the cons didn’t outweigh the pro- it’s cute and easy to wear with jeans or shorts or black pants for work."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:27fe72c00e637792e0892e63710d851]] I love the size and picture quality, however some of the posters were slightly bent & you could definitely see it based on the poster being glossy. However, great find!"
4.0,The XS size is a bit too big. Otherwise it’s a wonderful product!!
4.0,They roll up which I don't like. Use as a 2nd sports bra
4.0,"I got this headband for my 3-y.o. son to keep the hair out of his eyes. He likes the dragon and martial arts reference, but he doesn't wear it. I think it's pretty cool for maybe when he's older."
4.0,great mask only complaint is that the pleets wrinkle the words too much i had to take the pleet stitches out to be able to read the words
4.0,"Before finding these masks, I had a lot of trouble finding 3-layer masks that can fit my toddler. I had to make all the masks he had before I bought these. Making the masks from scratch was no big deal while on summer break, but I had very little time to make three more masks for my toddler because my school semester began weeks before pre-K opened. Because of limited time, these were a life saver. I had to alter them to fit my toddler's face, but it only took about 30 mins to get them all adjusted with needle and thread as opposed to the hours it would have taken to make masks from scratch (I'm not all that skilled with sewing). I pair these masks with adjustable lanyards, and they stay on my toddler's face and offer better protection than some of the other masks I had bought. They wash well (I don't put them in a washing machine though) and dry relatively quickly, so I can keep at least five masks on hand for the school week."
4.0,"I got the size small. It's VERY roomy, which is what I was looking for. I'm 5'7"" and usually around 150 lbs and I lift weights/exercise. so a somewhat muscular build. This still fits me in my 2nd-3rd trimester of pregnancy. Not see-through. AND covers my garments (LDS). It's light-weight and breathable."
4.0,"Nice, silky fabric. Runs small."
4.0,"This mask is very comfortable and very breathable. It appears well constructed and the ear loops are very comfortable (no pulling). With that being said, it is only one thick layer, it does not have a pocket to add a filter. This mask would be great for yard work to keep dust or pollen at bay."
4.0,Warmth for two year old geandson
4.0,A little small in chest area
4.0,"I loved the fit.  Color as well.  A little snug near ear as I had it on, but bearable.  Love it.  Felt great."
4.0,A softer take on the fedora.  I like it!
4.0,I like the scarf. The color & material are nice. Initially the scarf is snug fitting. What I did was let the scarf hang from a hanger & then on the end of the scarf I hung a heavy item. This gave it some stretch. I think over time the scarf will loosen up. I was too impatient to wait for time to go.
4.0,"Just for the whole back. Not in front. Says for the neck down. But the neck part doesn't have any of the silver lining. Just the entire whole back. Nothing in front. No power pack. Just simple jacket with a silver rear back. Not as what is described on-line. Depends on What battery pack supplied to jacket. For extreme cold portable 50,000 MaH battery pack. Kept warm the entire afternoon in the crane box."
4.0,"I really like this, works great for me as it is so lightweight. I do want to note though, that the straps are about half the width of the straps shown in the picture."
4.0,This is a nice dress for the price.  So many complements.
4.0,"So far so good. Looks decent and feels good enough quality. Only negative so far is the the hands are a couple degrees off from where they should be pointing. Other than that, it's comfortable, the band is decent and it doesn't look cheap at first glance."
4.0,Just hoping they can get them on-and hope they stay on.  Opening is quite small.
4.0,Bought a small & the shoulders were smaller than expected. Since my daughter is super thin we made it work. However I Recommend going a size up for better comfort. The blue is vibrant. Looked nice overall.
4.0,"I like the style, but the ankle area is for a wider ankle. I order Blowfish sandals often. These Sandals are a little wider and “looser on my feet. I have wider feet so that would be okay but, the wide ankle is irritating. I’ll keep them because I really like the style, the ankle straps are adjustable, but they will bunch or “wave”. The color is a nice gray. Last criticism is, the ankle straps are a little cheap and flimsy."
4.0,i love them they just fit perfect for me. i am planing on getting a extra one for my sister she love it too
4.0,Great tote just wished it had longer handles.
4.0,Beautiful shoes but run small. I ordered 2 different pairs and both were small. They seem to be very narrow even for my daughters narrow foot.
4.0,This dress is so soft and perfect for summer!<br />I did wash and dry the dress and it came out just fine.  I think I the dress being a size 120 was a little large for my petite five year old.  This will be a dress she can grow into.  If you size up you can wash and dry it.  I love that it was pockets too!
4.0,These didn’t scratch easily but they broke right along the brow part of the frame. Somehow the lens wouldn’t fall out even then and they sat in my car as a back up for days I forgot sunglasses until I just bought another spare
4.0,Love the color and all the pockets.  It's a bit bigger than I thought it would be and the &#34;adjustable&#34; strap won't stay where I put it - it keeps slipping 'til it's too big and drags on the ground if I need to put it on my arm instead of my shoulder.  Thankfully I am tall.
4.0,"Overall, this Vintage Grain Leather Calfskin Retro Replacement Band Compatible for Apple Watch<br />Is good. The leather feels soft and pliable, yet sturdily made. The black watch band buckle goes well with the black casing of the Apple Watch and holds the comfortable band securely to the wrist. The Apple Watch attachments work fine and can even be removed by pushing in the spring bars so that the band can be used with regular watches. Additionally, the vintage stitch design of the band is attractive and definitely gives off a retro vibe. The watch band is also reasonably priced. The only reason that I'm not giving this band 5 stars is because the selection button and photos of the black and green colored bands are mixed up, making it very confusing to figure out which one is being ordered. I had actually tried to order the green color, but got the black band instead. It’s still a well-made band, but just not the one I was trying to order."
4.0,"I’d recommend this for sure - it’s very cute and washes pretty well. The only downside for me is that essentially everything else I wear is black and the pink fibers stick to a lot of things - specifically out of the wash. For this I’m deducting a star but regardless, I’m happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Nice quality, a bit heavy (weight) so a little uncomfortable, but nice looking as well."
4.0,Cute boots but they’re not made to last long. They get flimsy pretty quickly and the quality really shows after a few wears. You get what you pay for. They’re still a good pair of boots but I’m not sure if they will last a long time
4.0,"This shirt was not small. It was quite large to be considered small. But I washed it on warm and dried it in the dryer and it shrunk to a very nice size. In fact I am wearing it now. It is cool and comfortable. The fabric is very nice and the look is attractive, casual but classy at the sa,e time."
4.0,I was expecting a bit better quality. The gems seem like they could fall off at any time. It's pretty. Can't complain for the price.
4.0,"This product works great for me, though a little snug."
4.0,"Next time I put it on, I will snap a photo. I forgot last time. The fit isn't bad at all. I like how it looks, overall. The bust could fit a little better, but that probably has more to do with what bra (or lack of bra) you choose to wear with it. I will try a couple of different combos soon. This dress looks really great with my black moto boots."
4.0,"I have had no problems with the straps coming apart yet, so I'm totally happy. I did order one size up and it fit perfect for me. Ordered a Large and I normally wear a Medium. I am 5'8&#34; 145lbs and wear a 34/36 D bra. Construction of the straps could be sewn to the body of the shirt a little better, but that would be just a minor improvement for the tanks to last longer. I have had back/neck problems and can't stand to have bra straps pulling on my shoulders. I wear these tops outside to work in the yard, run errands and I sleep with them for support."
4.0,The fabric is soft and comfortable.  Great product for the price.  Nice styling.
4.0,"I ordered the one labeled ""green"" but was expecting more earth tones that looked more brown based on photo. Overall a nice blousy fabric. Not sure of fit as it was a gift for someone else."
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable shorts, however, they make a crinkling noise lol. Maybe after a few washes that will go away."
4.0,my son that plays minecraft loves these sunglasses...
4.0,"This is a nice looking, nicely made hat. Just didn't fit my head properly."
4.0,"The suit is okay for the price and was purchased as an emergency suit. It is sewn well. (No loose strings or other seam issues) The hat comes without the end tassel and because of that, it looks tacky. The extras are okay, not that I really care about them. The suit when you get it will require you to fluff the white trim and remove the wrinkles from it. because it is tightly packed in a plastic bag and folded around everything else. The color was what was ordered"
4.0,I am pleased with my purchase.  The red color is pinkish red and the metal roses are pretty.
4.0,"Watch is junk. But for $5, it's cheapest dial watch on the internet."
4.0,Looks great on our daughter minus the fact that they seem to be noticeably too big. Something we'll have to grow into I guess. The seem to be made well enough to last a while. If it's something that bothers you be aware that these come with a STRONG smell that isn't very appealing.
4.0,"This was my favorite dress until the strap broke around the third time I wore it. I just pinned it with a safety pin and moved on with my life. You get what you pay for in terms of quality... but it's very very cute! Would buy again for those three wears even if I knew the strap would break again.<br />For reference I am 5'6"", 125lbs, 32C and I ordered a small. Can wear without a bra. Fits perfectly. The back is adjustable because you tie it."
4.0,very solid. slightly tight but not ot the point that they're uncomfortable or an issue
4.0,My 13 year old grandson loves them.
4.0,"I love this, it looks great on me! I have a mom-belly going on, but slim shape - 5'7"" and 125lbs - the Medium fits perfect, and I am highly satisfied with the length, as I typically get things that are a bit too short due to my height - this dress fits perfect! the ONLY thing I would change is the slit, it feels a little too far to the side, can barely tell it is there. I like dramatic slits - my own preference probably"
4.0,Loved the style & color!
4.0,"Well I don’t know about 1000 words, but it’s making finding the right keys easier. I have two sheds. Two cars, a camper, two motorcycles, a truck and lots and lots of keys.<br />We have a key rack right by our back door where we keep one of the sets of keys to everything. It’s a lot of keys! So in the interest of making my life easier, I try to have an appropriate key ring for each set that I can identify easily. This is for my small shed. Small key ring with a picture of a shed on it.<br />See how it works? lol. It’s a pretty simple item. Does its job. I don’t know how much I trust the little wire thing to hold the keys for long, but I’ll keep an eye on it.<br />I will buy one again if/when my wife loses this one. Oops. Did I say that aloud?<br />I recommend<br />Thanks for reading"
4.0,Flattering and comfortable for HIIT!
4.0,"Love the yellow and black. Great material, not see through. Please keep new designs in both styles."
4.0,Perfect for kids outdoor activities
4.0,It's ok for special occasions to wear that what I was looking for in special occasions wear
4.0,"The dress material was good quality, not thin and see-through but not super heavy. It arrived timely. The only thing was that it was a bit too large for me, I ordered a large based on the size chart but I believe a medium would have fit better. I tried to wash it to shrink it, good news is it does not shrink in the wash or the dryer."
4.0,Very nice for the price. Nice colors and was a good length. I got the sleeveless version and it's not hot even though the dress is a polyester ITY jersey fabric.
4.0,It likes to loosen over time but it's not bad
4.0,"Took a long long time to come in, pretty cool other than its all gold instead of one gold and one silver snake."
4.0,Does what it is suppose to do. Little heave but works.
4.0,Instructions on how this goes together would be very nice. It took 2 hours of hair pulling and lots of laughs but we finally got it together.
4.0,"My key fob for my 2005 Pacifica broke and that made it impossible to put it on a key chain.  So I bought this cover to allow me to hook the key chain on the rubber loop. It works fine.  But come on, this probably costs about 20 cents to make."
4.0,Love the tshirt but would have preferred if it were not such a tapered fit.
4.0,"These watch bands are comfortable and fit my watch perfectly. On the other hand, they're sort of cheap."
4.0,It looks really nice and gorgeous but too small for my daughter's feet.
4.0,I think every girl needs need this piece! :) it matches with anything pretty much
4.0,"Works fine, so instructions needed. My only complaint is the Lagavulin logo is very dark, hard to read, and a bit wimpy.  No one will notice the emblem unless they are assisting me while I'm flat on my back."
4.0,"I have the “Pink/Lilac” set in size 8/10. The colors are popular with my daughter.  She has a delicate frame/smaller build and normally wears that size in most of the popular children’s brands. This fit fine, but not much room to grow so it may run a bit on the smaller side. Soft, comfortable, and warm for a basic sweatshirt."
4.0,"This dress is very feminine looking.  It has an empire waist which rides high and elongates the body.  The white eyelet material gives the book a classic and retro feel.  The sleeves are flouncy and playful.  This dress is a great choice for a younger, slim woman.  It would be practical to wear to almost any function – except a wedding – only the bride wears white at a wedding.  If you really want to make a fashion statement you can wear a colored ribbon tied in a bow along the waist line.  Make it yours.<br /><br />The dress is 100% cotton so it’s easily laundered and will last a long time and still look good with proper care."
4.0,"Ordered a Large polka dot blue for a loose fit, wouldve been better with a usual medium. Love the dress and fabric. Size 8-10, 36b, 5’5”, 160 athletic, wide back, thighs, arms and booty. Large had superfluous 3 inches to the comfy loose i wanted. Sleeves and shoulders roomy. Will keep but order another color in medium."
4.0,I bought an XL to ensure a little extra room... it was a little more than what I expected but the sweater is very cute for the price.
4.0,"They slid down on my nose a bit, but did not hurt my ears! Good price for a pair of glasses I can keep in my purse while I’m on the go!"
4.0,The fit is good.  The shoulders have a tendency to creep off as the neck opening is wide and  I have narrow shoulders.  XL is what I ordered.  I wear 10-12 in clothing and have a long torso
4.0,true to the  pictures
4.0,I love the jeggings however they do run a tiny bit too large
4.0,"The ""greyish-purple"" is so pretty & a color I don't see many places.  It's a muted raspberry & i'm absolutely swooning over it - it's fairly true to my monitor & I don't have any fussy settings on my computermachine.<br /><br />The material is very thin so the scarf is nearly transparent in a single layer but I figure that makes it more versatile.  it gathers up nice & cozy for a Denver winter (fall here got drunk last week so I've already tested this in 34 degrees) but would also be good in spring/ summer for keeping sun off your skin without glistening like a racehorse.<br /><br />I yoinked one star from the rating because the ends are coming undone a little more than other similarly made scarves I have but it should be fine as long as I don't try towing any cars out of snowbanks with it."
4.0,"Beautiful dress!! Well made, very comfortable."
4.0,Love the material it’s cool but not thin and cheap. Kinda like bathing suit material.. I’m a size 7 36C and the medium fits fine - a tad baggy in front but wouldn’t look good if it were tighter. The grey and white one I was worried about it being see thru at the chest area - not too bad but if ur cold it will show so I wear my silicone pasties w it and it’s perfect !  See photos UPDTE: I’ve worn this twice and already one of the straps is barely sewn together. Not sure how long this will last once I wash it. Disappointed - I’ll have to have it fixed after only 2 wears. See last pic
4.0,The product is water- and wind proof as advertised but was too large so the fit is very loose and thus not as warm as hoped.  They would do well to offer the product in a smaller size.
4.0,Fit my daughter really nice
4.0,"Loving these socks took me some time.  The socks felt snug upon initial wear.  However now that they've been worn and washed,  they are my absolute favorite socks.  In fact, my other socks complain and feel neglected.  These colorful socks are also very soft.  They are not as thick and warm though as the description and title would lead you to believe, so please keep that in mind."
4.0,"They are the first dancing shoes I've ever had.  They are very tight, perhaps that's the way they are supposed to be.  Time will tell."
4.0,"These ran larger than I had expected. I originally bought a small and returned for an xs, which is still too big but workable. Cute pattern and style just as it looks online. For reference I am 110 lbs and usually wear a size 0-1 in pants."
4.0,"Very pretty dress. Great quality. I gave it 4 stars, and not 5 because I ordered the Medium and it was way too small around the waist (even though I have other Miusol dresses in medium which fit perfectly). I returned it and ordered the Large which is just a bit too large. But its a pretty dress and I feel good in it, so I will be keeping it. I am 5'7&#34; tall, 140 lbs and wear a size 8 usually. The dress hits just below my knee. I wish it was a little shorter though."
4.0,Very nice just what I wanted.
4.0,I got the last one that wasn't my size but its light and comfy and perfect to walk around in after I gave birth. Just thow it on and it doesn't look too much like a bath robe so it looks like I put a little effort into covering up
4.0,Really great for night driving. Also good for driving in the rain. NOT so good if it's night AND raining.
4.0,I ordered the blue jacket but was sent the red one.  My grandson didn’t make a big deal about it even though he requested the blue one.  So all is good.  Nice jacket and was delivered before date pro given which was good.
4.0,"I really like this product. Finally, a cover up that can button up and cover my ( easily burnt) chest!<br /> It's cute and comfortable, and can be worn a number of ways ( buttoned, tied up, rolled up, left open etc.).<br /> The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the ends of the sleeves don't have buttons for some reason.<br /> It's not a big deal, if you're going for the loose and breezy look, but I would like to have the option to button it down around my wrist so that it stays in place.  I may add buttons myself, it's not a huge deal, but it did detract slightly from my, over all, very good impression."
4.0,I purchased the MYNEKO Mens Short Sleeve Cycling Jersey 3D Padded Bib Short Set Quick-dry Polyester in Black/White.<br /><br />It's a very comfortable and good looking kit. Fantastic price point. The padding in the bib shorts seemed very good. I just had issues with the fit of the jersey. I'm a short guy so although the upper portion of the jersey fit well the bottom portion was far too long. I liked the set but ended up returning it because of the fit. Sometimes I kind of wish I had kept the set instead of returning it because the bib shorts were so comfortable.
4.0,"These are so cute, and they make your face look so stupid, which I love. My only gripe is that each mask seems to be a slightly different size, so that some fit my face, and others only fit my kid."
4.0,Fits perfectly and is more comfortable than a regular medical mask.
4.0,It is actually quite comfortable and feminine looking.  The fabric is heavy enough not to require a slip and light enough not to be too hot.
4.0,Very good quality. Strong and durable to maintain your watch strap in place.
4.0,Love this type of leather shoe for my 1.5year olds feet.
4.0,"Nice sweater,  was expecting it to be a little thicker,  but it does fit my needs."
4.0,Runs a little big but really cute
4.0,Great mask. Comfortable to wear.
4.0,Its a very pretty dress fits very well. Its soft and flowy. I gave it 4 stars because there was a black line on it. I did scrub it and it came off but that's why I gave it 4 stars
4.0,"This is a good dress, and it is made of a heavy and soft material. I’m not sure how the elastic center is going to hold up, I can hear something like threads snapping in there every time I take it off."
4.0,Good quality and nice colors.  They fit well too! I would order again.
4.0,The frames are a little smaller than I expected but they're still super cute.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:9707b81da95acb3a84fd8e697747e8d6]] This was my husband's first ratchet belt, and he loves the style over a traditional belt. He really likes the adjustability... the belt has a good range for weight loss or gain.<br /><br />He is currently a 40 belt (he fluctuates between 38-40) so he didn't need to cut any excess off, but there are marks on the back to be able to do so.<br /><br />The style is simple but can also be dressed up, so it looks great with a wide variety of pants. He gives it a solid 4⭐.<br /><br />One star knocked off for quality bc I am not certain this is genuine leather. There are no marks indicating the material and it doesn't smell like leather but rather that plastic type smell of faux leather. If this is not genuine leather, then this is a bit overpriced. Purchase with the expectation of a versatile but mostly casual belt."
4.0,"It’s a bit longer than I would like but worn a little high waisted, it works."
4.0,"This is an attractive purse that is well made and I'm enjoying it.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the purse is just short enough that the internal pockets meant for a cell phone won't fit a larger cell phone, which I have.  This is a bit annoying."
4.0,Only ranking it high because my 10 year old absolutely loves it. But it is very thin. He wears it around the house.
4.0,"Beautiful statement earrings. Larger than I expected which was great, but they are VERY heavy. I was not able to wear them comfortably for more than 2-3 hours. They were great for the wedding I attended though!"
4.0,Didn’t love returned
4.0,I have been really enjoying making watch bands for these watches. they are stylish and simple
4.0,"Not individually packaged, as stated in the description."
4.0,"Perfect, much better than the ones I get from work.  Sturdy but not anymore bulky."
4.0,"Ordered the rose colored googles. Didn't anticipate the tint to be so dark- swimming indoors the pool appears very dark. Like after sunset. You can see, but not like clear googles. Otherwise they work great. Would just order a non-tinted pair next time"
4.0,Excellent watch for the price...holding up well for work...
4.0,Loved the robes.  Ok..so my fault but can you believe they are almost too good?!!  These things are HEAVY...really really heavy.  Really really warm..  So..that is my fault for not understanding what i was buying.  They would be great for cooler climes but for Florida...I should have gone with a lighter weight cotton.  Entirely my fault..they are lovely robes.  Very nice quality!!
4.0,"Doesn’t really look good on me, But so cute! My parents say it reminds them of harry potter! I love them! I got small and they fit perfect for a kid. Really lightweight and comfortable."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:e6b7a30e2faa06a722a9b22f640dfa8f]] Me encanto por q además es de mis colores favoritos💙 muy cómoda el size la cogida 10 por que tengo mis dedos gorditos🤭🙂
4.0,"Based on reading earlier reviews, I chose for a half size smaller than my typical running shoe size and these Orthofeet shoes fit great.  So far I've had them for a week and they still feel great to walk around the house in and seemed to have eased some of the pain I was feeling in my legs from walking around barefoot.  I am flatfooted so the arch support seems to be working well for me too.  I hope they still fit and feel this good in another 6 months!"
4.0,"Love this dress. Ordered large, but a little too big for my 34C cup size"
4.0,Omg I love this. I have gotten so many compliments. Love that the sleeves have thumb holes. Only 2 flaws. String to the hood in my opinion too long. There is a hole in one of the pockets that I had to see.
4.0,My grand daughter is going to love this for Christmas!
4.0,"Bought these for my fiance, who loved them.  But one pair had to be thrown out.  The stitching on the inside made the socks too lumpy to be comfortable.  The rest were great."
4.0,It says it's unisex but it is not made for women if you have hips or a bottom it won't zip over.
4.0,The bands are all very nice!! The only thing is that I wish the dark green was a tad bit lighter since it is so dark. I’m not sure if the “clasp” in stainless steel either but I guess I’ll find out haha
4.0,"Really like this dress, im 5'5 and 130lbs, fits perfect. The only thing it lost a star for is the green on top isnt as vibrant and almost looses color when streched. Very cute Christmas dress for fun"
4.0,"This handbag was really cute, but way too big for me.  I'm 5'2&#34; and I felt like it over-took me.  I also think if I filled it up I wouldn't be able to lift it, lol.  However, it was made very nice, and exactly as shown.  Sadly had to return it and look for something a bit smaller.<br />Note:  Returning was a breeze.....  completely hassle free!"
4.0,It’s ok / so far
4.0,True to size with plenty of stretch. I like the lightweight soft material.
4.0,I liked that this tank was long. Overall it's a little uncomfortable because the shamrock really does not move with the rest of the shirt. It's very stiff. The rest of the shirt was a decent quality. Perfect for what I wanted it for though so would still recommend!
4.0,"This hat is great for those who wear high ponytails.  I don't, so I'm not quite sure why I bought it.  Maybe because I thought the more open back might be cooler.  Not so.  I bought this to use for hiking in virtual tropical conditions, and it is hot, and we haven't even hit summer yet.  The fabric is thick and doesn't breathe at all.  Still, I can use it for other wear, maybe in cooler weather hiking or just around town.  The cap is well constructed and looks good.  For hot weather hiking, I much prefer my TrailHeads cap which is much cooler."
4.0,Bought these for work.  Fit decent and comfy
4.0,"It is really roomy in the midsection area, I will have to have it taken in. But, the top fits well and will not need to be adjusted. I am only 5'3 so I almost always have to have the length hemmed with maxi dresses. Size Small shown here."
4.0,Good for hunting.
4.0,fits him to a tee - size wise and attitude wise
4.0,The item shipped a day earlier than expected they're good quality however despite having measured my cat I still feel like they're a little too snug other than that I really like them
4.0,Had to return. The top was way to big. The fabric was nice and would have looked great.
4.0,The pajamas are cute. They are lightweight. The pants are comfortable. I found the shirt to be a little snug and tight around the arms. I usually like my pajamas a little big. The medium I ordered fits more like a size small. I would recommend ordering one size up.
4.0,"Two insulated bags come in this order--1 green and 1 purple. They collapse very flat. The bags can stand on their own when the insulated support is inserted into the bottom of the expanded bag making it easy to load. The size is large enough to fit at least 2 of the 13&#34;x9&#34; size dishes inside with a hot pack or cold pack. I bought these to keep food cold while I'm traveling or grocery shopping and hot for transporting cooked food. My only problem is the zipper has a difficult time getting around the corners. I have not yet used them for transporting food long distance, but I will update this post when I do! I plan to use ice packs or small plastic bags of ice to keep food cold as I don't know if these bags are waterproof. The handles are attached completely down the sides, so it handled being heavily loaded very well. The material is malleable, so it can hold items that are an awkward shape. So far, I love these bags!"
4.0,Not as great as originals
4.0,Loved the style but was bigger than I expected. If your looking for a bigger and wider purse this will work great for you.
4.0,"The suspenders seem to slip off if you have wide shoulders. Aside from that, they’re great for the price"
4.0,Me encanto el material y la medida solo que los botones son muy sencillos donde se abrocha la pechera y se desabrochan fácilmente así que todo el tiempo tienes que estar abrochándolo porque se cae!
4.0,"I haven't worn it in the pool yet. But overall it fits as expected. The one thing that would make this suit better is if the straps were adjustable. I'm probably going to fix that issue on my own. But other than that, it is a nice suit for the money and covers me everywhere I would like to be covered."
4.0,"This has a tendency to go off for no reason, and not always when I want it to by turning on a light."
4.0,"The bands that come included are a nice color and size. The bands could be another inch longer to add some slack once it's looped through. The overall quality is okay, nothing too impressive."
4.0,"This ran big on me, and I had to return the large and get the medium. I'm 5'1&#34; and 148 lbs. for reference. Very cute cherry design, and it is comfortable except for the flimsy, detachable shoulder straps. When I went swimming, the hooks almost slid out! I'll have to sew the straps on. Also, the stitching near one underarm has started to come apart after my one time swimming... So points for being the comfiest, cutest swimsuit, but the quality can be improved."
4.0,Pretty decorative belt for a couple dresses that needed a little extra bling.
4.0,The hat was super small in relation to the size of the suit but the suit fit great and was super cute.  The colors faded quickly but it served its purpose and was a great price.
4.0,"I like these shamrock earrings!  They are not too tiny(bigger than my fingernail)  and look and feel to be well constructed.<br />Wish I could post a photo of them on my earlobes, but, alas, my phone doesn't send to my computer.<br />Yes, I would purchase again!  :)"
4.0,"You only get one key chain and by looking at the picture, it seems like you are getting two. It's cute, but the price is a bit high for one key chain. It is a gift for a friend who is a GA fan, so I was hoping their would be two to justify the price."
4.0,"I plan to rock this double-breasted jacket this fall/winter. It is smart and very professional looking. It is a rich, navy blue with gold military buttons.  The waist flares into a full skirt. The jacket stops mid-thigh. You can wear open or closed. And finally, be careful when ordering. It seems to run small, so definitely order up."
4.0,"They are cute!  As far as comfort, they are comfortable. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because I was hoping the shoes would be a bit lighter in weight."
4.0,"The shirt fit perfectly.  The only issue I have is I'm not sure why a company would place a tag on the outside of a garment. Even when you cut the tag off, you can still see traces of it. Can't cut the tag completely due to possibly messing up the sweater."
4.0,Just take them out of the suitcase and put them in dresser drawers. Works great.
4.0,Very well made and beautiful craftsmanship but they were too small and hurt me. I had to return them. If you're looking to buy these shoes be sure to order 1 size larger :)
4.0,Fits slightly small but will be perfect with a little stretch. Im a 16/18 and ordered the 2x and it's a little small in the stomach area. Love the saying. It isn't as glittery as the pic shows but I'm glad bcuz the glitter would flake off.
4.0,Runs small.  Quality is fine.
4.0,Good stocking stuffer this year. Chain is a little strange though. Mother of pearl accent is very pretty! Well priced for dolphin lovers!
4.0,"Would be five stars but one of the clips is missing a screw. Otherwise, they seem to work well so far."
4.0,I feel like they cover the face well & do a good job but they are kind of stiff even after washing. Probably will not buy again.
4.0,"Dress is actually grey with white polkadots.  Not blue at all.  Otherwise, It matches the description."
4.0,"I really wanted this bracelet, but it never arrived, however, the seller did give me a refund as they were sold out. I have purchased other bracelets just like this one and love them. Yes they are not extremely sturdy, but they are inexpensive, but they are still nice and cute. I do hope that the seller will have more soon and I can order another one. I gave the four stars because the seller was easy to work with and issued me a full refund immediately."
4.0,I purchased the hat to wear at work because the velcro ones fall off with how much hair i have. Apparently it isn’t allowed with the uniform but still fits very nice
4.0,"Pleased! Thank you.  Will need an under slip but soft, comfortable and feminine. I ordered a three of these and wear them often.  These dresses are comfortable and move with you.  They wash well, but If you throw them in the dryer they start to pill and fade quickly because the fabric isnt the best quality.  Line dry them and they will retain their color longer.  I got compliments on the lemon dress.  So cute!"
4.0,I like the suit and its very comfy and flattering.  The plastic to the strap broke a few wears in and there is not a lot of support
4.0,Material is a little thin but seems to be well made and packaged very clean
4.0,"Nice, soft dress, but made a less comfortable and less flattering by the elastic band which is strangely positioned midway from under breasts to waist (I have medium size ''chest'', with gravity starting to take effect, which I think should work in the elastic band position's favor, lol, but doesn't)"
4.0,I ordered an extra size bigger than normal just to be safe and it is just like U.S. sizing.
4.0,"Shipped from china so I was really worried about the quality and size, but it was pretty good. It's oversized and cute for layering."
4.0,"For the price, you can't beat them. Made of metal, and not plastic. The glasses are almost too heavy, but they feel very sturdy and well made. They are my everyday commuter driving glasses. I'll buy another pair, when I somehow sit on the current ones and break them somehow."
4.0,"It is very small, but I am petite so it fits me well."
4.0,I am quite pear-shaped and this is flattering on me.  I’m normally a size 12 dress and the large fit just right.  Love the pockets!  I gave 4 stars due to the color being a reddish orange instead of a true red.
4.0,Very comfortable love it.
4.0,Must be a size xxl. Does have a nice stretch band in the back and works well once you shrink it.<br />Had to boil the hat and then hot dry it. Fits great now.
4.0,"The hats that came in the two pack are a bit larger than the one I ordered individually. Not a ton, but seems like there’s more material at the top. Still serves the purpose though."
4.0,Just the skirt
4.0,I wear these on my motorcycle and at about 60 mph in 40 degree weather they are good for about a 30 minute ride to work.  They DO NOT work well with touch screens or phones.  They are fairly windproof and I would assume if you are just wearing them in the car or walking to and from a building they would fine down to about 0 but I would probably want something a bit more insulated and wind/water proof if I was going to be out for longer than about 30 minutes.
4.0,"Great product but fit smaller than expected. I wouldn’t buy the largest size for any child larger than a kindergartner. If they ran bigger, I’d get more."
4.0,"Super cute. Do not dry in a dryer, sleeves shrank, but still wearable."
4.0,Good quality very cute just runs big
4.0,"Runs Small, I ended up gifting it to my daughter rather than hassle with a return. I gave it four stars because it is pretty & well made. If you order, size up!"
4.0,I like this body suit for layering. The snaps are a little far back making it awkward each time I need to resnap after the bathroom...but overall this body suit works and looks as expected.
4.0,"They worked great when my son left them on, lol!"
4.0,"Nice material and cute color. It kept riding up slightly as I walked, but I loved the pockets and it was cute."
4.0,Love the colors and style! I wish it were a bit larger. I wear it as an anklet...goes well with my barefoot style..
4.0,"It was ok, the item for my nipples. The rubbers were too big."
4.0,"Solid basic watch. Tells time accurately, fits my small wrist very well. Wish it had a second time zone and showed the month besides the day and date. But for the price, can't complain!"
4.0,Very cute aprons. Love the adjustable strap around the neck. They are more of a canvas/tough material so they’re stiffer and not as soft as cotton. Also that makes cleaning tricky - I don’t plan to put them in the washer and dryer... More of a spot clean and hang dry.
4.0,I have a 44 Chest and ordered  4XL.  Its little tight on the chest but it is a nice shirt.  Be careful with the sizing.
4.0,"I like that the bag is very large and can hold a lot of stuff in it, but i feel like the sewing and straps are poorly sewn and I am yet to find out if they will hold my 3 week camping trip. I will keep updating to let anyone know how long it lasts me."
4.0,"I bought them to wear under summer dresses and skirts (so my thighs wouldn't rub), and they do the trick. Wouldn't suggest wearing them as shorts, though, because the fabric is very sheer."
4.0,Very happy with the show especially for the price
4.0,They fit well... Anxious to wear them at Disney next week!!
4.0,"😍I love this shirt! It’s comfortable, not too hot but definitely not too thin. Sleeves are very feminine and flattering. The ONLY thing I’d change about this is to make it a tad bit longer (i’m sure most of you won’t have this problem)but since I am 5’11” it’s a battle a lot of the times🤦🏼‍♀️ BUT, it’s still not to the point where I can’t wear it bc of it’s length, I just personally like mine a little longer. other than that I love it!"
4.0,Great quality dress & not see through... the arm holes seem a little large so your bra will show. Cute dress overall!
4.0,"I work with Wildlife and at certain times of the year I capture waterfowl to age, sex, and band before releasing back to the wild. Let me tell ya, it can be dirty work - especially when it comes to geese. These overalls held up through me wrestling with adult male geese and getting pooped on by thousands of other waterfowl. It was nice to be the bright pink lady amongst all the men, which is what I intended. They do fit a bit snug, but it was much better over my last pair of men's coveralls that I was drowning in."
4.0,It got a hole in it very fast but I love it.
4.0,"The pants fit great, I got a 3xl and they are tight and loose in all the right places, only problem is the are a tad to long"
4.0,Cute flowy skirt that’s casual and nice
4.0,"Its slightly thinner than I would have liked, but otherwise it is perfect! Love the color!"
4.0,"I usually wear L underwaer.  For these, I ordered XL (34-36""), and they're still a little too small.  These underwear appear to be well-made, and are tagless.  The pouch is a bit on the small side.  They are soft and comfortable, and look good.  Overall, a great product!"
4.0,"Size, quality was perfect.  Opening is not large enough for me."
4.0,They are a bit less sturdy than I hoped but ok. I recommend gettng  a set with more cubes and without the other 2 pieces.  My bad.
4.0,"I'll admit I didn't have the easiest time putting this on. It's actioned 9ff weird and though 8t says it's a wrap, it doesn't detach from itself at any points. After the 1st time I never had any issues though.<br /><br />It's well made, has a good bit of stretch, and is flatteting"
4.0,"My daughter is a slender 4T and this just fits her.  I'd recommend going one size up, especially if you want them to be able to wear it for more than a few weeks."
4.0,It's a beautiful necklace. It tangles very easily so be careful with it.
4.0,Very light navy
4.0,"I love this dress! I am wearing a large in this photo. I am 5ft 126lbs. The part below the waistline is very small I ordered a small before ordering this large. It fit, it was just too tight for my taste."
4.0,"Love the fit, true to size."
4.0,"Nice large watch overall. Looks quality made. The face is busy and makes it hard to tell the time but that's the case with competing watches with similar face. Dial to adjust hands, date and day is goofy and hard to set correctly."
4.0,"This bra fits a little snug. I purchased it after having a partial mastectomy. The fit everywhere else is good, but along the bust it's much tighter and puts more pressure there. All in all I've been pretty satisfied"
4.0,Love the shoe. So comfortable and warm. However they are not true to size as listed. I ordered my exact size and my toes were all the way at the end. Too small. So I’ve now ordered a half size larger. We’ll see how those do.
4.0,These are really cute on
4.0,"Great sunglasses. Just a little bigger than I expected. Other than that, they fit and work well!"
4.0,I love this set! Instead of wearing all 4 pieces I am down to three. The all gold piece tarnished but that's ok..
4.0,Just what I was expecting..
4.0,The size was alot bigger but that's because I got a large rather than a medium ( large was the only available size atm) the shirt is kinda thin but it didn't take long to arrive
4.0,"It seems harder and harder to find shoes of any style, for a narrow foot. These fit beautifully and come in pretty colors as well. They are also very comfortable. I plan to buy a second pair soon, just in case they disappear as the weather changes.<br /><br />My one regret is that they do not seem to come in a closed  toe style."
4.0,Cute dress. Runs a bit large.
4.0,"I'm loving this scarf.  Sort of a jersey knit material.  It wears nicely and the pocket holds a lot.  My only ""complaint"" is that the zipper is white making it a bit obvious."
4.0,Shipping took about a month but if you're not in a hurry and want cheap fashion rings then buy this .They are all the same size and are just simple gold rings. They would occasionally fall off throughout the day and I've lost several of them.
4.0,"Was just a little too short but besides that I love the dress, just have to be careful bending over"
4.0,"Soooo warm definitely a dress I could wear out without worrying about wearing a coat. Nice and warm, sort of has some sort of fleece lining. Not sheer plus better quality that I was expecting for the pricing. Got a small, definitely a bodycon. Bought a S and in red. True to color and size. Could have sized up but I’m planning on shedding a few more lbs."
4.0,"Very pretty, but I wish the chain was a bit longer. I should have read the description better, so that's on me. But it is very pretty and I really like it alot."
4.0,"Holes wear through too easily in toe area.  Yes, I clip my nails.  Stay on better than expected, but not perfectly each time."
4.0,"I like the look of the gold aviator sunglasses so when I saw these, decided to give them a try. They arrived in a triangle box (a first for me) with the typical items to go with - cleaning cloth, holder, try-it card. The weirdest part was the triangle - they fit great and it’s cool, but then finding somewhere to put it - it’s at once easy and hard.<br /><br />The sunglasses are nice looking.<br />There is one ISSUE I have and it caused me to knock them to a 4 star: the ends of the arms (earpiece, temple tip) that go behind the ears are very pointy and very sharp. I’ve had to learn to hold them out as I put them on because I scratched myself the first half dozen or so times. This (plastic) end was not smoothed down and is sharp to the touch, so while they look nice, it’s enough for me to say it doesn’t feel “polished” as a product.<br /><br />I do like their look overall. The gold is sharp, the shape is nice, the weight and balance are right on. The lenses are nicely tinted and work well in our sunny, warm weather state.<br /><br />Overall I do like them and have worn them often since arriving. I have 2 expensive pair of sunglasses I use for many days out, but always keep several cheap pairs around for various reasons. I will keep this pair as part of that group and grab it when I want to look a little nicer while out. The gold has a classic, nice, little bit higher end look, so these will do well in setting like going out to lunch, meeting up with friends (when we can again) or the like. I do like them and am happy to have them."
4.0,"Love the colors on this, good thick material. Smaller then I thought it would be."
4.0,"Very well made and looks great, the design is the exact same as the old US Military M65 Field Jackets. It's new and a little stiff, so a few good washes will wear it in. It fits perfectly in the stomach and chest area, both with and without the liner. The sleeves are a bit long, and they're difficult to keep rolled up, but that shouldn't be hard to fix."
4.0,The product was just as described and fit well.
4.0,"Love the color. Nice, good-sized bag. A little more flimsy material than I was expecting but it won't deter me from using this all summer long!"
4.0,"It good so Beautiful and not sensitive, comfortable, comes with the bag"
4.0,"Excelente producto, hermoso bolso con la calidad de Tous a un precio inigualable. Lo único que no me agrada es que no envían certificado de autenticidad."
4.0,"Super lightweight! Great for traveling! I have been using Coolibar for couple of years due to skin sensitivity, very happy with this reliable brand. If you are looking for something more affordable, I just tried the Baleaf half zipper upf50 long sleeve. It’s an amazing alternative."
4.0,Great shoes but I bought the black expecting it to be all black and I received a pair of black shoes with pink laces.
4.0,Quickly received! Nice the blue is a little lighter than picture
4.0,"I really like the watch but it is a bit bulky for being a women's watch.  It has held up so far & is pretty, just bulkier than I really wanted."
4.0,"Hat is a little large for my daughter's head, and I would have liked a velcro chin strap, but overall a very cute hat. Great for keeping sun out of baby's face and off of her neck. Held up well to machine washing/drying."
4.0,"I loved the ring, but it broke on the first day. I guess you can't really wear it out without being super cautious. Otherwise totally cute."
4.0,Bought it for my 10 year old son. It's not cute and until this day we can't tell the left foot from the right without looking at the image. However it's for the house so it does the job.
4.0,"I bought it to my daughter it come faster than it say's the quality was not that good for the price it have but, it's very soft inside."
4.0,"I bought these for my friend and she said that she liked them.  She sent me a picture and honestly, she looked really goofy lol.  They are cute as long as you don't want anyone to take you serious."
4.0,I like the design & that it’s gold but it’s a bit too small
4.0,Works great at eliminating sweat while working outdoors
4.0,Xmas present was very good built
4.0,"I just got mine in today and I just love it!! I think it goes great with my purse. The wallet I had before didn't have enough space. This wallet has more than enough room for cards, money and your cell phone (if it's thin) there's two spots you could put you phone. The only thing I dislike is there's no place a change and on the inside in the middle on the corners you can see a peek of card board but it's not very noticeable (nothing bad). Other then that I'm very pleased with this purchase! (:"
4.0,"Got these for my daughter, who is completely satisfied with them. Soft and slightly fuzzy to the touch, they stretch well enough to get on/off easily, and are not so tight that they leave marks when bunched up near the ankle, which she insists on doing for no good reason. Materials and construction appear to be of sufficient quality that they will last as long as socks in our house generally can. Would recommend to anyone in need of girls' socks without reservation."
4.0,"Little sequins have started jumping ship but I forgive them.  I love these, they wash easily and I wear them every day."
4.0,They are what was expected
4.0,made in good material
4.0,Looks decent. Difficult to resize and the tool they sent with it broke the first attempt. I have gotten compliments on it. Good face size
4.0,"These fit my husband's size 9.5 feet better than they fit a woman size 7.5. The cushioning hit him under the toes, an area not really in need of cushioning. The socks are comfortable for walking. They laundered well."
4.0,This hat is not as pictured. The shape and structure of the hat is very thin and lighter than expected. Its still stylish however and I made it work. Warm but not overheating. Very soft material.
4.0,"These are light weight, attractive but cheap feeling bangles. However my wife observes that the light weight, which leads to them feeling cheap, is actually attractive to wear since if you have an arm full of heavy bangles you feel it after a while.<br /><br />My two year old daughter is also obsessed with these bangles.<br /><br />Bottom line, great to get for oneself, not as a gift for others."
4.0,"These worked well. Had to measure the size of heel in order to buy the right size. Was a snug fit, but didn't fall off like comparable products."
4.0,"So I do like this bra, but the outside fabric is slightly itchy against bare skin.  With a shirt on this is not noticable"
4.0,Son bastante altas altisimo el tacon
4.0,They shrink when you wash and now won't fit his feet but they fit mine?
4.0,"Great little party dress.  I'm only 5'0"" tall and no hemming was needed.  (Hem falls to my knee as pictured on model) The only issue I have is with the zipper.  I'm not a fan of ""invisible"" zippers in general because they tend to be flimsy and prone to breakage.  All invisible zippers have difficulty traversing over the thickness of a double-seamed waist.  Be really gentle when zipping over double seams."
4.0,"This tunic/babydoll dress is cute and well made, but a little on the small side at the chest if you're anything over a B cup.<br /><br />I ordered it along with a similar model from another brand (Hestenve), and ended up keeping the latter. While the YIBOCK tunic seems to be of slightly better quality (it's lined), the fit isn't as good as the Hestenve tunic when you're a ""larger"" cup.<br /><br />For those of you wondering what the differences are between the two brands, here is a list:<br /><br />- This tunic has a lining. The Hestenve doesn't.<br />- The Hestenve tunic is slightly larger, especially at the chest.<br />- The Hestenve tunic has an elastic under the chest. This one doesn't ""give"", so it feels tighter and and is harder to put on and take off.<br />- Both tunic appear to be made of the same material (95% rayon/5% spandex) although this one doesn't have a fabric label<br />- Both tunics are the same length (I'm 5'5"" and the Medium comes down about 3 inches above the knees)<br />- Sleeves are the same, i.e. wide and reaching down just above the elbow<br />- The Hestenve fit is better if you're over a B cup."
4.0,"This was super cute, not sure what language is meant to be on the hat with a Union Jack but we just liked that part, it is a bit small but it has stretched and my 4 year old now wears it."
4.0,Love the dress and the pockets
4.0,"It's not entirely full-grain. Only the upper part is the full-grain leather. Not sure what type of leather the inner lining is but it doesn't feel cheap. Perhaps top grain? And there's a soft squishy material that's sandwiched between the two. No clue if that's leather or synthetic. The belt feels and smells of leather. Been using it for awhile now primarily for work as dress belt. Slight creasing on the hole I use often. But I don't think they're prone to cracking like cheap genuine leather belts often do. Only time will tell how well this belt will hold up, but at this price range, it's not bad."
4.0,"These shoes are dressy, and have a good width. I wear a 6.5 regularly and this fit true to size. It's a nice summer shoe and the white one goes well with many outfits. Pretty comfortable while walking as well.<br />My complaints about this is<br />1) It is slippery on some surfaces.,so the sole needs more grip to it.<br />2) The links make a clinking sound when I walk which makes me a little conscious."
4.0,Love them wish I could order more
4.0,I love these. They are stylish amd comfortable. The only issue i had was that the lenses smudged very easy.
4.0,Very stylish but hurts my ears after a few hours unless I take out the speakers. Great for strict lecture halls where they're Nazis about electronics and you gotta be discreet. The flashing light may give you away so I just swap which headphone I put on which side so the light and controls are all completely hidden
4.0,I like it buy the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is due to color which is more peach than pink.
4.0,Helpful product...and cute too!  Small/Medium is just a touch too small to pull off and on comfortably.  Overall good!
4.0,they are very great just wish the legswasn't wide leg sweat pants at the bottom
4.0,"Soft and comfy, little large in size for my 8 year old but doesn't faze him at all.  Looks like a long lasting pajama set for us."
4.0,Super cute and very comfy! Very summery. It is slightly longer than I thought it would be and it is much very flowy. I bought for a night of going out with friends but instead am wearing something else since it doesn't fit with the winter.
4.0,"Good watch nice and elegant,the window where see tourbillon tourn wacth a stronger personality,Realy it's a nice wacth"
4.0,This hoodies is tight around the neck the elastic around the wrists and waist are pretty good no complaint there it is a tad tight so I would recommend getting once size above what you normally wear.  But overall it is a warm hoodie and I will enjoy wearing it this spring.
4.0,Lots of compliments on this top.  Very comfortable and nice color.
4.0,"When the price dropped I jumped at ordering these!<br />Pros: These shoes are nice for the price ($17).<br />My normal size fit well. (I have a medium width foot)<br />Rich , beautiful color (I ordered the caramel color) Cons: There little to no padding and the sole is thing. Doesn't look like real leather."
4.0,"Actually works well. I was a bit skeptical at first, but am pleasantly surprised."
4.0,man panties ... ha!  very comfy and don't &#34;ride up&#34;
4.0,"These sunglasses are actually smaller that what is advertised. I was hoping for a bigger lense. Overall though, I’m satisfied with the sunglasses!"
4.0,Would give 5 stars but it was only 10 inches and I ordered 16.  Chose to give it to a young girl who can use it rather than return. I do love the stainless jewelry!
4.0,"I purchased one of the $69 metal band watches and have been wearing it regularly for almost 1 year. I believe this is a Russian case (a wild guess-it was shipped from Berlin) and face, with a Japenese movement. Very nice quick reading face, timer is a little hard to see depending on your eye sight (60 minute). Still very attractive business like watch. Comfortable heavy double clasp metal band (can fit a very large wrist). I have not scratched or chipped the crystal yet. Other than I prefer a sweep second timer and don't care for the 1 second (sweep second hand) jumps with this quartz movement this is an excellant watch overall. I am hesitant to try their $179 models (although they are haunting me) because it is hard to believe they could possibly be $110 better in value. Perhaps someone that has one could enlighten me? Out of my many neat Amazon purchased watches available I seem to find this on my wrist weekly."
4.0,"Wasn't expecting it to be see through,  but a few alterations fixed that problem.  I probably shouldn't went a size up,  it's a snug fit, (which looks amazing - but won't last long).. But it looks very nice."
4.0,"Love the dress, although it’s long sleeved it’s also light weight great for the summer.  I like the long sleeves because it covers my tattoos for the office however, if need be, the material is stretchable where you can pull up the sleeves and won’t cut off your circulation as I did in the pics.  I took off one star because the colors look a bit faded.  In summary I love the dress.<br /><br />My measurements:<br />Size-XL (US)/12-14/jeans-31 to 32 depending on stretch.<br />Height-5’8.5”<br />Weight-209<br />Waistline-39”<br />Hips-45”<br />Chest-40”<br />Shoulder to shoulder 20”<br />Arms-15”"
4.0,"I thought I was ordering the right size according to the chart, but these were way too big for me. Tag says XL which I see was a 6-8, but I'm 5'5 and about 115 pounds, so will be ordering the Medium-0. They seem to feel really good and I can tell this will be a great pant once I get the right size."
4.0,Very nice style with an airy flow for the summer. The fit is a little smaller fit
4.0,It’s very beautiful. The band is thin which I like. And it’s true to size. The stone was larger than I expected but I still like the ring as a whole
4.0,"Great little bags, good product for the money. Would love to have given this 5 stars across the board, however. The bags all smell strongly of mildew."
4.0,"Love it! Perfect for what I was looking for. It’s not really a sweatshirt material but more of a Thicker spandex t shirt material. Gave it 4 stars due to the price, at 55$ I would have expected it be lined and slightly better quality.  Functionality in this case out weigh the quality, but would have purchased a second if the price were cheaper considering the quality of the product. 5ft 7” 200lbs 38DD Large fit with room to spare, but I wanted the sweatshirt comfy and roomy."
4.0,"Unusual material, but nice fit."
4.0,i give 8/10 for dupe. Otherwise nice bag! Good material! Has logos.
4.0,I love this dress. Its true to size and fabric not cheap looking
4.0,"Really cute and well made, but really teeny. Eight inches across. My fault, I didn't read the specs. Would have kept it, but I'm broke this month. Ha!"
4.0,Sexy but very short in the front and I’m only 5’ 4” and 120lbs.  I have to watch how I sit and keep pulling the dress down to keep from flashing everyone.  Very figure flattering.  I’m a 38C but I think this dress will fit any bust size.
4.0,"These are great and definitely don't pull hair the way more traditional swim goggles do.  That said, they can be a bit snug though they will stretch a bit while wearing them.  My 5 year old had a bit of a tough time putting them on herself, but once she got used to them she enjoyed not having her long hair pulled everytime to wanted to swim."
4.0,They were a birthday gift.  The recipient loved them.  She loved how dainty they were.  Time will tell about the durability.
4.0,"It's been a long time since I have had a new wallet and so I chose a nice one. Very well made with lots of card slots, more than I will ever use. It will be a long time before I need to replace it."
4.0,Nice boots but they smell awful at first. The smell gradually fades.
4.0,I was disappointed because the choose are very nice. But they where just to big.
4.0,My favorite kind of watch.  Numbers are large enough to see without strain.  Comfortable fit - not too tight.
4.0,The smallest bit of pressure on the stud part will break it
4.0,"I am 5'3&#34;  and when the dress arrived at first it fit a bit large, but after washing in cold water and low dryer setting it fits perfect. Classy, fun dress.<br />No ironing needed. The material is close to a rayon blend and very comfortable."
4.0,Really nice shirt.  Just wish it had banded/knit sleeves.
4.0,I’m 5’5” 110.  Ordered them in small.  Very fitted but these have a lot of stretch so they’re perfect.  I would have rated them a 5 if it weren’t for the length.  Very short.  At least 2” above my ankle. They need to be longer! I washed on gentle and hung to dry.  They washed fine.
4.0,"These bangles are really beautiful !<br />I wear ( Many, many bangles 1 for each year of my late husbands life..he died at age 48 , so I wear 48 of them )  and do not even notice I have them on as they are so light weight . It is only when someone says &#34;Oh, you wear so many beautiful silver bracelets&#34; that I remember  that I have them on .<br />These are a great addition for the collections and replace the older ones that have worn off their silver tone..<br />Yes , they do tarnish ,as even full silver does, but are easy to clean off my wrists under soapy water . I  consider that as upkeep of how I want to express myself. They arrived in 3 days !!<br />Magigal"
4.0,I like the light weight.
4.0,"It runs a bit smaller than average so definitely should order a size bigger, but my son loves his hoodie so much and we are happy with it over all!"
4.0,The sweater is soft and decent fabric but not made to be oversized - you Will Not get the slouchy comfy look.  It’s not that the sizing is wrong the way it’s made isn’t as pictured.  I’ll keep it and wear it but disappointed not as expected.
4.0,"great look and can keep your ponytail up off your neck!  runs small,  but they do have other options to choose from."
4.0,Fits all sizes but you cannot put your arms down.
4.0,These run small. I am a light weight and ordered medium. Make sure you order a size or two larger than you think. You are getting 3 shirts for 30 bucks.  Very good deal. No complaints regarding quality.
4.0,Super stylish and comfy for the flight
4.0,I should've sized up. It shrank after first wash. I would put in gentle cycle or hand wash then hang to dry. I love the material though.
4.0,Very nice.  Wish they were a bit larger.
4.0,"Cute skirt, fits fine.  A little more lightweight than expected but good for summer."
4.0,"A few months ago these goggles were priced at $59.00, which I thought would be a fair price if they were well-made. But I was offered a pair for FREE in exchange for a fair and balanced review. It took me 6 weeks to get to that review as in rainy Washington state we haven’t had much sun or use for goggles. Now that the snow is in our mountains and we’ve getting some sunshine, I’ve tested them as has my pilot-in-training son. We both give these goggles a high rating. But we need to test them under skiing conditions to come up with a possible 5-star rating.<br /><br />I have to wear my regular glasses and these goggles accommodate them well without pressing my glasses against my head. I also noticed that they are usable in less-than-direct sunlight, not too dark. The lenses are also resistant to fogging up, with just touches of fog under quick changes in temperature and humidity. But the lenses clean easily – just use non-scratch material.<br /><br />I also appreciate the handy yet tough carrying case along with a bag for protecting the goggles and even cleaning them. This is important because any polarized goggles are prone to scratching. As for looks,  when I wear these goggles, I don’t know how I look to others. But when I look in my mirror, I think I look COOL, MAN!"
4.0,Fit comfortably. Not as open neck as expected but very comfy
4.0,This is cute. Only thing I would change is for the top to come up higher on chest.
4.0,My cat loves his new toy. They are natural and  I would recommend these. The only thing happened is that the package was delivered to my neighbor and I had to retrieve from his doorsteps.
4.0,"It is labeled XL, but I guess in fact it is M. Have to return. Nice shirt, though."
4.0,"I love the look and how light the shoes are. But for some reason my son doesn’t like them, he’s only 2 year old and he’s being very particular about this shoes."
4.0,"I ordered two pairs of these - one for my husband (size 11) and one for myself (size 5) to wear while working in and around our pond. These are one-piece garments with the boots attached, and the whole outfit is stiff and hard to work with. The material is “plastic-like”.  Hubby’s fit fine, but I am short with large calves. Mine fit me everywhere, except for being a little bit long (which I could deal with) but the area of the leg at the top of the boot would not go over my calves. So I could not put the boots on. If I order a larger size the boots will be too large and hinder walking in them. We are keeping his but returned mine. I received a credit to my account the day they were delivered to amazon. I am pleased with the customer service. Will see how they hold up with use."
4.0,I liked the fit but was disappointed that it didn't have a nose bar for a tighter fit below my glasses.
4.0,Nice assortment for young kids like toddler and preschool size.
4.0,Great shirt! It fits me well and is very comfy.
4.0,"Potter nuts will love, could have been made alittle better."
4.0,"the purse itself is great- zippers are quality, materials as well, and feel as though this purse will last a long time. the hardware is that fake gold color, I'll look past that, as the graphic is awesome- I really really wanted this bag- happy with my purchase!<br /><br />the seller and shipping however- ordered 2/22/18- just arrived today 3/20/18. they marked it as shipped upon purchase, but tracking shows it was not shipped until 3/7/18- this is irritating and inaccurate. item loses a star due to seller."
4.0,Loved the fit and thickness of this dress!
4.0,"Good colors, looks like the picture, but cheap headband. Hat is attached with two elastic bands to the black plastic headband. May be small for adults heads."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:76ab562e2573dced6d2c728d6f426881]] My daughter loved this bracelet When I gave it to her. They repeat but it has got the main characters and they're made pretty dang stout as well. Makes that classic ""Jingle Jingle"" sound too. lol<br />The links of the bracelet itself are the normal, generic, easily bendable metal loops. Because of this you should keep an eye open for if any characters fall off.<br />Find the piece & it's an easy fix though."
4.0,"Fit well, color right and price good. what's not to like? delivery longer than I expected, but good things worth the wait."
4.0,Love the band it is the perfect width
4.0,These are sturdy boots of great quality but they run big and not as cozy as others we tried. I returned them and I bought a pair from Land's end which also run big but are warmer and half the price as I bought them on sale.
4.0,"I purchased this as a gift, it was a huge hit, sooooo, I had to get a fedora for myself"
4.0,"The cups it comes with barely fit around my chest honestly, so I pulled them out and put ones from an old swimsuit in it. Other than that it's very cute and comfy, covers my butt entirely, not too restrictive, and dries pretty fast"
4.0,"bought these for the grandchildren, clips are small, not easy for small hands to use"
4.0,I'd like some in other colors. I've worn it every day since I got it last week. The only reason I'm not giving all five stars is that I think it is a little overpriced.
4.0,Very pretty dress but you should buy your actually size. I'm 5' 3.5&#34; and I weigh 150 and the large was too big. I should've ordered the medium like I planned.
4.0,The tutu is very cute and fit my daughter perfectly. The only thing I did not like was when i took it out of the package it had a very fishy scent. I had to wash it right away but let it air dry.
4.0,My daughter will like them
4.0,This is a great jacket for price but the material is thin so keep that in mind. I got white so I will wear as a spring/summer jacket but would not be good for cooler weather.
4.0,The cap sleeves stick out lime a sore thumb. Has to be adjusted. Otherwise a nice lace dress
4.0,"I break about three neck straps a year. All of the clasp designs I’ve used have had flaws such as scratching the instrument, being made of plastic, popping open and dropping the instrument, etc. However, the rubber on the clasp keeps my sax nice and shiny without being scratched, which is definitely a lifesaver. The clasp is metal, so it won’t break and it won’t pop open due to the design. This is by far the best clasp I’ve ever had! On the other hand, the neck strap is very uncomfortable. I’ll switch to using no strap sometimes because my neck just can’t handle it. I have neck muscle issues, but it’s never been this bad with any other neck strap. Additionally, the adjustment is strange, not necessarily bad, just strange. It adjusts in a few different ways which is cool, but I adjust my instrument a lot and it takes more time. Good product, wouldn’t suggest for people that play for 2 hours a day."
4.0,comfy size runs a little small
4.0,"This item is so cute. However, after washing it once in the washing machine, a it ripped a whole and had to sew it. I will have to handwash in the future."
4.0,"Relly pretty, amazing Christmas gift"
4.0,"This is a pretty jewelry set.  I wear it a lot with blue, red, white, even pink.  Worth the money I paid for it!"
4.0,"Fits very small compared to American sizes, but a very beautiful shirt."
4.0,"5'9 and 150lbs. I love the length of the dress. The fabric is nice and it looked beautiful on! The top part of the dress was very snug around my body, maybe because I am tall and it stretched to fit the length of my torso, not sure! I put my own belt with it. It will be a great dress to teach in because it is long, and covers your entire negligee / top of your body!"
4.0,"I'm not mad at it. It looks cute and I love the embroidery detail. The material is nice too, feels soft against skin"
4.0,Nice necklace more for kids than adults.
4.0,"Cute. Top runs small, bottoms are big. Ugh. Other than that fiasco my son loves them"
4.0,They are cute and nice
4.0,A little on the cheap-looking side but my little one still loves it and if they're happy I'm happy!
4.0,"These are cute and would have worked if they weren’t a little on the small side. The fabric is thinner, not a bad thing for hot weather, however, I am fat and so the thin fabric didn’t have enough structure to skim over my flabby parts. Just not a flattering look for me and I returned them."
4.0,Good quality. 4 stars because it is a little too big to carry on your keys everyday in the pocket. But a nice novelty nonetheless and would make a good gift for your favorite Pochinkian.
4.0,Fits perfect the only thing is it’s a little long kinda looks like a dress on me but I still love it
4.0,Perfect gift for my nephew.
4.0,"Nice little short, but a bit small for the size I ordered. Will use them, however, when I receive my new exercise bike. Overall, the tights are a quality product, and I expect them to stand up to daily bike exercise. I would not hesitate to purchase another pair."
4.0,I think they are cute. But my 3 year old bent them easily so they are definitely cheaply made. My real glasses that are similar to these are made a bit better. But what do you expect for fake glasses?
4.0,Runs big. Probably two sizes too big. And it was expensive to get it resized at a seemstres.
4.0,"This dress looks so cute on my grand daughter, love it"
4.0,Nice dress. Fits as expected.
4.0,"A little heavy, otherwise nice"
4.0,Very beautiful earrings.  The only issue I have with them is that the hooks are very weak and bend with the slightest pressure.
4.0,Nice value for the money. Size and shape is attractive and not overwhelming. Color is a very pale green-
4.0,Wore this as a Halloween costume. Actually kept the head very warm. It sheds though.
4.0,"didn't use it yet ,looks pretty good"
4.0,"The material is of good quality, I would recommend that you get a size higher than what  you would normally wear. I donthave anybidea of the shrinkage of the fabric ao just check the washing instructions"
4.0,They socks did not go up as high as I thought they would have. They did look great on everyone though.
4.0,"Did the job. I took my son to the races, and he didn't complain about the noise"
4.0,Fits fine. Size is correct.
4.0,"My daughter shrieked when she got this necklace. It fits great, and it looks beautiful on her. Great for an H20 fan."
4.0,"Received these rings this week and they are awesome. The only problem i have is the dark blue ring is too big so obviously isn’t a size 6, easy mistake. But, I’m not sure how to contact seller without starting a return process. I don’t want to return all of the rings because the others fit perfect, but blue is my favorite color so it is discouraging that is doesn’t fit."
4.0,"a bit tight, but comfortable"
4.0,"This dress is really cute!  A bit thin in the material, but in some ways that will prove nice on a beachy vacation.  It has just a tiny bit of a sleeve so you do not feel super exposed.  It is tighter in the chest, then loose everywhere else - so take this into account if you are bigger in that area.  I am a 5'4"", 145lbs, and a 34D and it fits just perfect across the chest, any bigger and I would likely size up.  Length is good, above the knee but not too short.  Taking this one on a December vacation in the sunshine!"
4.0,Super thick will definitely keep u warm in the winter
4.0,"Works Great, Wish they came with a case for travel and protection"
4.0,It worked Great. I loved it.
4.0,Bought this to replace the corsage for prom. It was beautiful!!! The girl loved it! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it didn't come with a display box.
4.0,Thank you for my very 1st set!
4.0,Nailed it!
4.0,These were a gift and they were very pretty. The pearl is large.
4.0,Great car blankets
4.0,Cute but super hard to take off septum😓
4.0,"The color was perfect and fit true to size , good for an occasion where you need to take off heels!"
4.0,Band looks like the strips were stamped on. The design will get lighter and come off in water.  Buyer beware.
4.0,"I received them 3 days ago. I started with a short 12km run than another 8km the next day. Today I did a long 50Km with 2000m D+ with these socks, including 2 river crossings and a lot of mud. They are incredibly comfortable, Dry fast. No blister, the compression points provide comfort and relief to the foot. I don t see the point of the weird shape of the upper sock but I does not bother me. I love them enough that I just ordered 8 pairs of this model Alain M. Durand run low models too. I think I have finally found a sock that is makes a difference.<br />Only 4 stars for now. I need to assess durability."
4.0,"This is a beautiful band for my fitbit Alta.  I purchased one for my 73year old mother too.  We both found it is very heavy.  Trying to size it was my eyes worst nighmare.  It does come with a tool but the screws are so tiny and had to get back in.  I wear my fitbit 20/7 but only wear this band if I'm going out and need something a little more fancy.  Great price, I do recommend but be forewarned, sizing it is not as easy as video makes it look!"
4.0,"I really like this wallet.  It is very functional, but the handle is fraying away and I’ve only had it a week."
4.0,Very cute and went well with the outfit!
4.0,"Really like this watch, looks very simple and clean."
4.0,Liked them; slightly larger than I thought they would be
4.0,These head wraps are better than some as the material is heavier and seem to wear better than their thinner  counter parts.  I would buy these again!
4.0,"I purchased 2 scarves - the Navy Blue and the Blackish Green. They arrived as expected for China Shipping (have patience) but they didn't come with the keyring as advertised.<br /><br />The material, however, is smooth, thin, and light. It'd be great used as a Spring season scarf!"
4.0,Fast delivery. Very pretty.
4.0,It is very pretty. The stones shine beautifully.  There are some issues with the clasp...made cheap and hard to close.  I haven't worn it yet so I don't know how ot will stand up to wear and tear and if it gets water on it.  But ot looks nice.
4.0,Great look and fit!!
4.0,"I love this top, I wear it often. 4 star just because the sleeve are straight so they feel wide on the ends"
4.0,Really cute. A little big but might shrink after wash.
4.0,"After reading the previous reviews, I was torn on what size to order and I really needed this dress at the last minute. I opted for my size which is large and to my surprise, it fit perfect. I gave  a 4 because I did not like the flap on the shoulder, but I fixed that with my grandmother’s broach."
4.0,"Ok this is a really cool bag and very practical in many sense. It's subtle doesn't attracted unwanted attention on its own and really attractive In classrooms and social gatherings. The material is rather durable so far has held 20 lbs of books and laptop with little issue. Inside are several pockets and dividers for organization and documents, 2 small pockets for small items.<br /><br />Now the downside for why it's only 4 stars. Only the outside pocket on the flap is zip sealed while the rest is vulnerable to dust particles and if unfortunate... water. The two pockets on th inside are also not the easiest to put things in so you may need to think about it first before hand. The bag also doesn't have a stiff boarding to maintain its shape, so if something is heavy and in the sealed pocket or hanging on the tactical molle weave it will pull and morph the bag if you don't have a large book or laptop to counter the force. There are a few other annoyances but overall I still love it for what it can potentially do.<br /><br />Best fit for 15-16&#34; laptops or 2~3 textbooks. Good for taking to comic conventions and social gatherings advise not to take it to an interview... unless you applied to MARVEL/comic shop"
4.0,"I'm 5'6 155lbs , short torso with 6m post partum belly. Reason for purchase. My old skinny jeans created muffin top, no likely so these jeans solved that problem. A little snug in thigh area, working on that meanwhile 1 size larger would have been good too. Happy,nice color. Would buy again."
4.0,It's more of a dark green color - my boyfriend liked the skinny tie looks. The quality is nice.
4.0,"Pretty color but it's a little tighter then my Steve Madden wallet ,which was my last wallet still a nice wallet !!!!"
4.0,"Great tie. Thinner than I expected, but worked out well. Was made well, obviously for the price there were some loose threads but they were all hidden so that was great :-)"
4.0,"The cut is a little off. The top half fits like a dolman shirt. Loose kind of almost too loose. Then the bottom fits a bit snug. Now, I have some extra quarantine weight and have had a baby (meaning the first place new fat sits is around the lower abdomen), so the snugness may be because of my body shape. Fits like XL on top, but M on bottom. I bought the XL. :-| It doesn't bother me enough to return it. The material is a little on the thin side, but not so much you can see through it. Good for summer time."
4.0,It fits well.  I purchased it hoping the vents would help prevent my glasses<br />From fogging up.  It’s no better then any other mask I’ve found or made.it does bony prevent glasses from fogging up
4.0,"very cute and dainty, love it so far"
4.0,"photo shows the on/off button is easily scratched. weird fragile plastic over it, crumbles off. little upsetting because it’s a cosmetic flaw & makes it look crappy & cheap. i’ve turned it on/off maybe a total of 10 times now & it’s started flaking. i’d recommend to the manufacturer to do something different with that weird plastic film over the power button. didn’t give it 5 stars for that exact reason. i don’t expect things i buy to start flaking after just a few uses. upset it’s only going to get progressively worse.<br /><br />other than that the blending power is really good. not smart to use chunks of frozen fruit. i’d recommend if anything freeze only your blueberries & the rest of the fruit/veggie should be thaw. small frozen pieces is all i’m saying. large frozen chunks prevent the blade from spinning.<br /><br />been using it for fruit smoothies & gym smoothies. the glass component is really nice! (plastic is awful.) love how the lids can be placed on either side of the glass container. feels sturdy. excited to use it for travel. i’d definitely buy another as a gift - just fix the film over the power button first."
4.0,This bag is just ok. I gave it as a gift and it’s already looking worn like she had it for months and that’s not the case.
4.0,"the charm is super cute, but the chain is very flimsy. but you can always get a new chain bc the charm itself is very nice. the paint seems cheap and might chip after a while, but I think that'd add to the design since it's supposed to be an old key yknow? if ur using it as a cosplay piece it'll do just fine"
4.0,"great hat, but expensive."
4.0,Once you get passed the smell it is a decent wallet
4.0,Love the pattern. It really spruced up my dull desk and workstation.
4.0,"This scarce is so beautiful  and it pairs great with anything ,from maxi dresses to blue jeans,I wear it around my neck,around my shoulders as a shawl,I even wore it around my waist as a bathing suit skirt cover up!delightful.!"
4.0,Cute hat.  Large visor gives good protection from the sun.
4.0,This fit as expected and does not wrinkle much.  I got the large and normaly wear a size 10/12.  I would recommend.
4.0,"Beautiful gown, comfortable but the XLarge too loose will return for large"
4.0,I received my order wayyy before the expected delivery date so that’s a big plus. The shoes are cute and fit my daughters well. I don’t think they would hold up well for everyday wear but they are perfect for special occasions. Cute and comfortable.
4.0,Fabric is a little thin but It fits well and looks good.
4.0,"Love the shirt. A little thin, but looks and feels great."
4.0,Runs extremely small. Love the shirt though!
4.0,"Was stoked to get these since I've never had silicone rings before and liked how they looked and seemed like a deal for 10 of them. When I got them, they looked as expected and seemed durable even with me stretching them out a bit for several minutes. This is where the downside comes in - they fit a bit snug. My actual ring size is about 12 to 12.5 so I ordered a 12 with these. Not a bad fit on my ring finger but a bit snug at first and really snug on any other fingers. Might've been my mistake not ordering a size bigger than I usually wear with normal rings but regardless, good quality and feels good. Just wish I would've known to order a size bigger than I thought would fit."
4.0,"They fit and they’re comfy, I just think the leg holes are too tight. I’m still a beginner with biking so I don’t have slim cyclist legs so that may be why."
4.0,"It's what I wanted, tho I don't think of this blue as Royal."
4.0,Fits nice and snug. Speakers have great sound and the external manual controls are easy to use and very convenient. Great value.
4.0,My granddaughter wanted it and she likes it.
4.0,Love the cuff earring but like most cuffs I have trouble getting it on. I must force open it then  squeeze it on my ear to close it. I have this problem with all cuffs but this piece is very nice.
4.0,Nice case...print is a little small
4.0,"This bracelet is gorgeous!!! The only problem is that it does run a little small. I actually bought it 1/2 inch up from a charm bracelet that I always wear and yet this bracelet still barely fits. I ordered it a little larger looking to have it be a little bigger than my charm bracelet fits me, but in the end I wound up with something more snug than the charm bracelet. It didn't occur to me that the pearls themselves would be bulky enough to take up the length of the bracelet. I recommend buying a full inch larger than what you actually want the bracelet to be."
4.0,These are great for everyday.  I wear them instead of shorts in the summer. Not tight fighting or compression leggings.  Nice colors.
4.0,"At first I thought they were pretty crappy but after wearing them and washing them, they're not bad.  Good enough until time comes when I won't have to wear them."
4.0,Super gorgeous. But it legit took half an hour and pain in my fingers to get the top unscrewed.
4.0,Nice shirt.  I am 5'9&#34; and 157 pounds and ordered a medium which fits just about right.  Quality seems good and comes out of the washer and dryer ready to wear (unless you like the crisp ironed look).
4.0,This wallet is a bit bigger then I thought but it definitely holds everything I need
4.0,I was looking for a small leather gift for an anniversary gift.  This was perfect and was a great price.  My wife loved it.
4.0,Well made. Kind of small.
4.0,Great but they are not memory foam
4.0,I was looking for inexpensive long dresses to wear outside in the heat or around the house. This one is nice.  I hand washed it. The price is right!
4.0,"Great glasses.  Nose piece is a bit large, but perfect for riding/driving.  Lenses are easy to change and come in a nice carrying case.  Having all the different lens options is great too."
4.0,"It was a Mother's Day gift, color and style was perfect. Only thing is the clasp. Could be easier to open."
4.0,"Came as promised.<br />Material is hard plastic.<br />The foam did fall off when my son tried to put it on for the first time, nothing hot glue or crazy glue can’t fix.<br />Needs 2 double AA batteries, one button, user friendly, has three different light patterns to choose from.<br />Over all should be enjoyable for one night for Halloween."
4.0,Great loft.  Wish had belt system
4.0,Did the trick. Not sure how long they will last but for the price I thought it was good value.
4.0,"BEAUTIFUL bracelet, but difficult to tighten/loosen it so it stays on my wrist."
4.0,These are wonderful I got them for my self and my girls and the rubber backs they come with work great my girls and I have not lost an ear ring at all.
4.0,"I like these retainers. The only downside is that when wearing it, if you are close enough, it kind of looks like a blackhead in the center. I do not wear much make up, so that suggestion doesn't really work for me, but other than they serve their purpose. Shipping was fast."
4.0,"The American Flags fell off the hook seconds after putting on. I was very disappointed with that, however, Amazon made it right by replacing them. The other earrings are great."
4.0,you need to measure your bible before you order. I didn’t so it was too big but my niece needed a cover and it fits her’s very well.
4.0,"They were cuts. Kinda thin, but they served their purpose."
4.0,"The shoes themselves are very nice, but they were a little too big for me (I use the same size for every pair of Lacoste shoes I have and never had a problem)."
4.0,"This is a really cute, really comfortable hat for babies. The best feature is the ability to adjust the size of the crown - that ensures it fits babies of a wide variety of sizes. We used this hat while outside all day at a fair, and it stayed on and kept our baby's head, face, and neck sunburn free."
4.0,I like my shirts alittle longer so it wasn’t as long as I would have liked
4.0,"It's short but I wear undershirts so that's not a big problem for me but it'll shrink more if you ain't careful about how you wash it, other than that yeah itsit's just your average polo"
4.0,"Pretty design.  The sleeves are a little bit tighter than expected, but still fit okay.  It's a little too low-cut to wear to work.  The tie covers some cleavage, but has to be sitting just right"
4.0,Top a little small.
4.0,They feel good. However one ofmy legs swell more than the other and I wish it would have give just a little .<br />The two in the package I love and the price. I am hoping when I get my weight down some more these will be here waiting onme . Yae.
4.0,"It was a gift and he loved them.  I would like to add that the gift box is a little flimsy, but the cufflinks are nice."
4.0,great fabric!!
4.0,could be a little more stiff if using it for firearms but for airsoft it is quite adequate
4.0,looks nice on
4.0,I purchased this to go with a corset I was wearing to a convention. It seemed to be made of good thick cloth and was very comfortable to wear. The only downside was that the elastic at the neck seemed to be a little too good and would try and ride up my shoulders a little bit. All in all though I was very pleased with the shirt and would definitely recommend it to others to try.
4.0,They are beautiful... just wish the space between was a little bigger...
4.0,"Product was a little snug, but fine."
4.0,The side bands broke off rather quickly. The artwork is very nice. We wish the mask was more kid friendly.
4.0,my daughter was thrilled when I gave her this. very cute & lightweight
4.0,"Lovely color , nice style,  a little snug in  Fit."
4.0,"My daughter is pleased with fit and style.<br />Her parents are happy they were under $100.<br />We recently went to a local soccer retailer and we lol when the same shoe was selling for $230... Along with all the top shoes.<br />We think the way they make these shoes, should still be around $40-$60."
4.0,Very Useful and the leather is super nice
4.0,"It seemed like a pretty nice bag.  Looked just like the pictures.  In real life, it was bigger than I thought it would be by looking at the measurements with a ruler, so I sent it back."
4.0,"Super cute, but beware the grey is very light in color :\"
4.0,Its a little snug but its the cutest dress and I love the waist
4.0,I love it.it s big and even has a slot for my smartphone. The material is kind of meh hence the 4 stars instead of 5 but the clutch itself is excellent design.
4.0,Kinda small - they fit- just tight! :)
4.0,"This garment has great stretch and retains its shape fairly well. I'm 5'2, full-figured and it hits me mid-thigh. It's very comfy, not binding, but I wear high-waisted shapewear to smooth my hills and valleys! This is well constructed and the color is exactly as represented.  I like to wear this with leggings and boots, and it also works fine, like a bodysuit,  under a longer flowy skirt. The color works almost like a neutral. Many blue, brown and red hues complement it."
4.0,It was perfect for beach vacation
4.0,It was a bit larger than I expected but overall I love it!
4.0,"Sexy bottoms,  Love the high rise and the leg openings.  Wish it covered a bit more in the back."
4.0,looks cute without all the extra size from a full sock
4.0,Suited more for a large boned person.
4.0,My niece is going to be so cute in this outfit! Ordered as Christmas gift. Looked as pictured and material is a nice quality for such low price. Received earlier than estimated ship date. Gave 4 stars because it smells really weird but overall nice product!
4.0,The Space Dye Athletic Sports Yoga Pants Capri Leggings were a little small. I have a 40 inch hip and they where a little tight. I would think if you are a 38 or have a small butt that these would fit great. There are very soft and fell great.  The color was nice and vibrant. Ill  save these till I drop a couple of inches. Bought them to get in shape. But guess they will now be one of my goals to fit in conformably. Glad I seen them on sale.
4.0,"It's very pretty, it will look great with sweaters this winter. I'm glad i ordered it."
4.0,"Great color, exactly as shown.<br />I enjoy the fit, even if a bit tight around the chest.<br />I paired it with a loose white decorative belt to add something around the line.<br />HUGE POCKETS!<br />Only con of this dress is it kind of feels like canvas texture? pretty stiff originally but of course as you wear it, it gets better."
4.0,"I got a small wished I got an xs! I'm 5,4 125lbs and it sort of swallowed me alive."
4.0,A little thin... not exactly for the winter.
4.0,It was a gift but I've had the same before. It is a good basic watch.
4.0,"En la primera usada se dañó el zipper, de lo demás todo bien."
4.0,I love the gloves. The only negative comment is that there was a very small piece of shrub/stick inside the glove and it poked my finger when I put the gloves on. Unexpected.
4.0,"I’m a 4/6 and I ordered a medium. The shorts are a little snug for a medium. I’ve run in these several times and they wear well during exercise. They stay out and I don’t have to worry with re-adjusting. The material is soft and comfortable. Definitely recommend, but if you are between sizes you may want to size up."
4.0,"Normally it's Grace Karin for the win, but this dress was not my favorite. It seemed more faded than I expected and it was sized like a tent. Wearing it was completely unflattering. I looked like I gained 50 lbs."
4.0,"I like it. The band is a nice texture - though I imagine it may not last. It's a bit thin in spots. But I'm careful with my things and it wasn't very spendy so I'm ok with it. I like the look of it, unobtrusive and modern in design. The alarms work well. It's a little louder than I'd want (but again - so inexpensive!). My main issue is that the watch/alarm unit itself is a bit wide. So while the strap is a reasonable size for my little wrist, the watch hardware bit is wider than I am. I tried to take a photo to show, but when it's on it's hard to take a close enough photo to indicate.  Basically, the hard part sits up against my wrist and the edges hang off both sides of my wrist.<br /><br />I think I'm just dreaming of a higher price point item that is more slim, fitted, quiet. But for $20 - how angry could I be? If you're looking for something simple and don't want to spend a lot this is a good decision I think.<br /><br />I noticed what looked like the exact same item under another name - directed at mindfulness and goal setting - and it was almost $50. If I'd paid $50 for this I would not be as happy."
4.0,"I get compliments on this necklace everytime I wear it, instantly dresses up casual outfits! Had it for a few months and its held up well."
4.0,Excellent size for my son to take when he needs a week's worth of clothes.  It handles very nicely and is durable.  The lock is a great feature for use at summer camp or other situations to guard against tampering.
4.0,I can say it worked exactly as described. I can say what's nice about the band is that there is a tool provided for replacement as well as extra pins for the band sides.
4.0,Fits well. Recommend purchasing some additional support for feet for extended wear.
4.0,"Cute top but looks terrible on me.  I'm petite but I have a large chest and I do not like the way it looks on me.  I(I'm 5'1&#34; and wear a 2 bottom but a 6 top)  I'm not dinging the product because of my body type--just bear in mind that if you are chesty, this is going to make you look like a sausage."
4.0,The closer is great. It doesn’t make a sound when I’m hunting.<br />I should’ve paid more attention to the width of the buckle as I have to take it apart each time I loop it through my pants. It’s easy enough. I just didn’t think that far into it.
4.0,just what I needed for the deep cut tops.
4.0,Giving it a four for design. Wish the protector for the neck it was longer and had a way of staying tucked under the shirt
4.0,Tend to be on the small size....very tight fit. Will stretch some.
4.0,The sound quality isn't the best but the warmth of the beanie makes up for it.
4.0,Looked great at the beginning but by 5th use the fabric lost it’s elasticity.
4.0,"Cute, very classy. Like the option to wear one side or both"
4.0,"I love my t-shirt but it was a little smaller than expected.  I wear a medium in all my clothes but this t-shirt was just a tad small, not much though."
4.0,And overall great and simple watch. Only con is that the light only comes from the left side and it's difficult to see in the dark sometimes.
4.0,The hat material is soft and it is cute. The color is not as pretty as in photo but I think overall it is nice for the price. I purchased as a gift so I can’t say whether it is durable.
4.0,"the background black has a slightly more pink tone than I wanted and wish the pink was more vibrant, but good enough. Comes in box and generally looks nice - bought for father as muted pink and black to match wedding party."
4.0,good quality little hat. I bought for my 2 yo grand daughter & it is very big on her. Unfortunately it'll be a while til she can wear it.
4.0,"A little on the flimsy side, but prefect for the purse (even small ones).  Love the holders."
4.0,"This is a nice looking belt, and it's light weight and comfortable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because two days after receiving my belt, two of the grommets fell out. It's not a big deal, the belt is still usable, but I would think the grommets would last longer than two days."
4.0,I love the dress and apron. However; the sleeves of the blouse were very tight. I couldn't wear the blouse and bought a different one. Otherwise the dress and apron were beautifully made. I received many complements on the outfit.
4.0,The bags are great for Costco type shopping. Not the grocery store.  No form to stand up while loading. But great for taking to the beach. I have a bag of cool rocks and shells now. Very comfortable to carry over shoulder or in hand.
4.0,The dress fit well but the peplum was a little high on my waist. Great material and mad well though.
4.0,Beautiful earrings. Daughters ears are sensitive but these didn’t bother her.
4.0,"It's tough to find true XLT fitting shirts for us tall guys who have average waist sizes, (not overweight), but this shirt comes as close as any and the price is right."
4.0,Meeting expectations.
4.0,"My son wanted this shirt as soon as he saw it advertised,  he is for sure happy with it"
4.0,"Excellent for the price,  but too small. Felt a little like I was wearing a bathrobe,  so in addition to the too-snug fit, I'm not comfortable wearing to a beach wedding and am returning. Would be perfect as a summer dress, though."
4.0,It would deserve 5 stars if it had fit exact.....it did fit but i could have used more room....love the material its worth the buy!!!!!
4.0,Nice for the price! Just what i needed. And it arrived super fast. Like the next day or so.
4.0,For the price the dress is worth it because I have a small waist the Medium fit loose around my waist I'm 5'3 weight 150 and ordered a medium. True to size.
4.0,"It is a simple canvas tote. Good for hauling large objects in a purse. If you aren't going to carry much, then you would switch to a smaller bag."
4.0,"Ordering these straps is a bit of a risk since you can't really tell the characteristics until you receive the item.  This strap that I received is a bit harder and stiffer than the original Fitbit, but has nice round edges and breaks in after a few days and is comfortable.  I received the item in great condition earlier than expected."
4.0,A larger size would have made it more comfortable.  But other than that it is a great lightweight holiday sweatshirt.
4.0,Super cute but to short
4.0,"Felt pretty comfortably.  Not that I have anything to close it to as these are the first ones I've ever worn, but I though they were great.  Fitted everywhere it needed to be without being too tight.  I where it when I go biking or even under my clothes when I play paintball."
4.0,"I ordered a size 8 and it fits me perfect because I read the reviews on how you should go a size up to what you're used to and I agree. I'm 5'5&#34; 135 pounds. My only complaint is that in the picture the shirt looks tan and blue, well the tan part is actually white which I ended up loving it anyways. I love the way this fits me. Super cute, great/soft material. I already got a bunch of compliments on this shirt. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,it was just what I wanted. I like the simple design.
4.0,"These are great value for how much comes in the bag and how long it lasts. Makes a wonderful addition to soups to add some extra texture and protein to them. Also great replacement for meat in burritos/wraps! I wouldn't eat them straight out of the bag though, they need to be cooked in something else for them to taste good."
4.0,It was a little bigger than I thought it would be. But it was still nice.
4.0,"Shoulder straps were too long to give any kind of chest support, but I tied it up. Love it."
4.0,Beautiful looking ring.
4.0,Good.. Nice mangalsutra.. As per their cost they are good in quality. Mustgo for it.
4.0,"Good for summer months in over air conditioned offices. Needs heavy starch though, wrinkles easily."
4.0,"The other reviewers were right, this top is way small. I took their advice and even though I'm a small I ordered a large, and it's a bit big around my waist but the rest fits perfect. I'm a bit disappointed that the blue isn't as vibrant and it's more polyester than cotton but it's still cute and I'll keep it. The material is a bit heavy too."
4.0,It's a little short
4.0,This is for a baby not a big girl
4.0,Decent sock
4.0,Love this jacket. Got lots of compliments at work. It’s light like a feather yet it keeps me warm enough. I was afraid it would be to small  after reading others reviews but I ordered the largest one and it fits. As soon as I can set some money aside I’ll buy another one different color. Love the navy one.
4.0,"It's so cute and I love the pattern, I really wanted to keep it! But it's a little tight when reaching out with my arms and since I've got a small child the tightness is going to annoy me and might result in it tearing eventually. So I'll have to return it."
4.0,Great wallet so far. I love that comes with extra bands. Very lightweight and compact.
4.0,Easy to use for many hours at a time.
4.0,The material is a liitle thin but still loved it. Great for summer time. Not heavy. Good for summertime.
4.0,"The hat fits a little different than a standard trucker hat, but it looks great."
4.0,"The skirt itself is beautiful. As others have noted, it runs small (unless you have very narrow hips). for the price, I think it's a great deal. It arrived on time, and had minimal packaging which I appreciated. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it!"
4.0,"In a nutshell, the Sunsoul Tribal Boho Gypsy Brass Bangle Bracelets are super cute. This set comes with 4 bangles. The two thick ones have a “hammered” design and the two thinner ones have a “faint” leaf-like design. I had absolutely no issue slipping these light-weight bracelets on. They are affordable and can be worn causally. They look really cute with jeans and an oversized shirt. And finally, these come in a trendy drawstring, burlap bag that makes them perfect for gift giving. Overall, these make the perfect accessory for a a causal outfit."
4.0,"The detail on the dress was beautiful. A great summer to fall transition dress with the warmer colors. Be mindful their is no support or fit to this dress, it is strictly a loose fitting dress, does not hug curves so a curvier, bigger bust like myself is hard to fit into."
4.0,Casual dressing I normally wear large in jackets and this time I order 2XL and it fits perfect
4.0,It is a very cute lanyard! I love it because it adds some pizazzz to my outfits since i have to where my id at work. I guess my only complaint is that the hook part is a little cheap not that the lanyard was crazy expensive. The lanyard also smelled a little odd.
4.0,"The design is okay in person even though it looks better in the photo than in real life. The logo feels a bit sticky. I ordered a medium (sometimes mediums fit great on me and sometimes they don't) it's definitely big on me (athletic build, 5'5"") and a small would have fit better. Also you should know that they are a little difficult with obtaining full refunds as I asked for one and they asked me to keep the shirt. I would have given them a 3 star for this but they offered a half refund if I kept it so I gave them a four star review. I probably will not buy from this company again."
4.0,"After having these and wearing them on my glasses a bit more, I have modified my previous review that was not favorable.  These do help nighttime glare from headlights, just not as much as the fit-overs I previously used until I got new, larger glasses.  When polarized sunglasses first came out, one of the ways the manufacturer ""proved"" that they were polarized was to take two lenses, put one in front of the other and rotate one.  If the image blanked out they were polarized.  These still do not blank out like I thought they should but they do help a good bit."
4.0,It’s super chic for the price I paid and was a huge hit at my event.
4.0,"I bought it for a very lightweight kimono jacket because the lapels are a bit ""flappy"".  However, one of the clasps did not line up correctly and it kept slipping down. I had to fix it with a tiny piece of adhesive foam."
4.0,"Very cute, but also run very big."
4.0,We buy this style of shoe every summer for my son.  They’re great because they’re comfortable for him and easy for him to put on alone.  The only reason I didn’t give a 5 is because the Velcro on one shoe is starting to lift up. I always have that problem with this shoe style though.
4.0,Very large but great quality.
4.0,Wish it had long option because I'm a tall person and the length was slightly shorter than what I thought.
4.0,I really loved the style behind the dress but it was just a tad too long on me
4.0,Decent helmet but it doesn’t have a face shield so you have to poke around and make sure if you want a face shield it fits this helmet.
4.0,Like my original case. Very satisfied with this purchase!
4.0,This is really soft and light. One thing to note is that the sizing chart for the solid/geometric pattens is different than the one for the florals. I bought the pattern that is a geometric floral so it was kind of a wild guess but it worked for me.
4.0,Simple and very appealing. Four stars for lacking a sapphire crystal at this price point.
4.0,"Maybe I didn't realize this was for a child , oops , won't fit an adults head very well ."
4.0,"Great for a light lunch, and my Spidey-fan loves it."
4.0,"I like everything about this dress, except material is little thin, but no other problems."
4.0,"Exactly like the picture except the button on the waistband. Nice skirt, runs little bit small on the waist. I expected the flower print to be more colourly."
4.0,These are nice but are still a little too large for my 6 month old. It’s not a big deal though because she will grow into them.
4.0,"Comfortable, doesn't wrinkle. Grocery store, work in the yard"
4.0,"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. I'm glad I bought one size bigger than he needed, because it did run a little small. He seemed happy with it when he opened."
4.0,I love the look of this dress. I ordered an xl in the burnt/orange color because I'm wider in the chest area and it's a little snug at top..  returned and had to get an xxl.. It gave a little more room at chest but not much.. dress flows lose from the stomache down.  Very comfy waist down and comes right above my knees in length.  Looks cute with a pair of wedge sandals or heels.  Only wish the top part was a little bigger or gave a little for more comfort.  Good dress for summer weddings or graduation parties.  Return was easy and delivery was fast!
4.0,Beautiful bracelets! I love the woodsy boho vibe they give to any outfit. Always get compliments. Although I have to put them on carefully since the “thorns” are a bit sharp to the skin!
4.0,Ordered the matching mother/daughters they both fit in the top half but are both short. They will still work for the photos we bought them for. Price and shipping time was great and I would buy again.
4.0,As expected. Fabric is not see through and seems to be nice quality. Have not worn yet.
4.0,"These are comfortable but not as soft as I anticipated. While not necessarily uncomfortable, you can feel the texture of all the small little balls. Still a good buy for the price."
4.0,"I ordered this dress in 2XL i am normally a size 18. I got it zipped, but it was too tight for comfort and didn't look right. I returned it and got the next size, it fit perfectly, its quite stretchy. I picked the dark green and it is the exact color I chose from the picture."
4.0,"To the manufacturer: STOP GLUING THE LABEL ON !!! Rather than sending the chiffon envelope, sew the label on with 2 stitches...or leave it loose in the chiffon bag. My beautiful olive green shawl arrived....the label was on crooked...label is way too BIG...I made a conscious decision to carefully pull off the label, then pull off the glue strip, and knowingly left a torn area on the shawl rather than have that label on. I'd rather have that than the crooked huge label.  I would have ordered a beautiful deep plum from you, but will not."
4.0,I love this skirt! A little thin but not to thin...... will buy more colors!
4.0,"I LOVE Havana Breeze shirts!  i have several and all of them are excellent quality.  This polo shirt is superb.  I received a Large size for review and it is true to size (American).  The material is soft, durable, and is made of 80% silk and 20% cotton.  The sewing and construction is excellent, and has a nice texture to it.  My husband was thrilled to get it.  This is a very good shirt and can be worn for casual wear and when very nice shirts are required.<br /><br />UPDATE 12.2.19  I have deducted a star from 5 to 4.  I washed it in the regular laundry and it did fine except the collar really crinkled and wrinkled up pretty badly.  The rest of the shirt was fine - no shrinking and no fading and still very soft.  I will have to take a hot iron to the collar to see if I can straighten it out."
4.0,"It does feel and look very cheap, but also looks nice at the same time. I feel like I have to keep adjusting it though... that's why -1 star."
4.0,"I don't do costumes so I was on the hunt for something cute and silly to wear to a Halloween party; I ordered this dress with no real expectations. The material feels like a cheap bathing suit, so I can't really imagine wearing it on the regular, but for this price, I can't complain. The fit was as expected--I ordered the 2x and I'm usually a pretty solid 18 (48-37-52) and it did cling a bit around the bust but nothing unusual. It was a bit big in the waist, but I can just wear a belt to solve that as I think sizing down would make it way too tight in the bust. Overall, this is cute and ridiculous, and I'll probably buy this brand again if I need another theme dress in the future."
4.0,A bit tighter than I thought.  Ordered a medium to allow for extra room but it fit as a small.
4.0,It was adorable. Great quality.  The paw print on paw was more of an iron on type design instead of embrodried.  Loved it!  Great value...good weight and paw arms had good length.
4.0,"(Wife of account holder)<br /><br />I recommend ordering 2 sizes up! I'm a 5&#34;7 curvy girl with a lot of junk in the trunk. I wear a size XL in bottoms and L in tops so I was in between what size to get. I went with my motto of always ordering bigger just in case, so I ordered the XL and it fits just like a L. I'm working out right now and am losing weight so I'm sure it'll fit better in a few months. Overall it's great quality super cute and showcases my curves and thigh perfectly!<br /><br />I highly recommended. Please note - this review is based off of a discounted review sample from the vendor. If you think this review was helpful, I’d greatly appreciate your feedback & support by clicking on the &#34;Yes&#34; button below. Thanks! : )"
4.0,"It looks bigger than I thought but is positive, not easy to setup without instructions."
4.0,I absolutely love these pants but wish the inseam wouldn't unravel. :(
4.0,"I normally wear a 5-6x, so I ordered the 6x. The bottoms are spot-on, but sadly the top is a little bit big. Other than that, I'm absolutely in love with this. It's my first bikini, and it's super cute! It seems very well put-together, not at all cheaply made."
4.0,"Recently I went to an Anime Convention with some peeps, my roomie was dressed as Albedo, I went as Sucrose.<br /><br />I ordered a size Large at first but was a bit too big for me so I went down to a size Medium.<br /><br />These are my measurements for anyone of a similar build unsure of what size to get.<br />Height: 5'4 (162 cm), Weight: 145lb (65 KG), Bust/Chest: 36 In (92 Cm), Waist: 30 In (76 CM), Hips: 38 In (97 cm), Shoulders width apart: 14.5 In (38 CM), Thigh Circumference: 21 Inches ( 53 CM).<br />Now about the outfit pros and Cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The material is pretty good, it better than the other sucrose outfit I had gotten off Aliexpress which did not fit me and couldn't return.<br /><br />- The black part of the outfit is stretchy so it makes getting it on/off easier.<br /><br />- The Gloves fit me perfectly. I have small hands and most times gloves fingers are too long for me but nope these fit me well. And they kinda worked with the phone. So, didn't always have to take them off when texting or taking a photo.<br /><br />- The Hat actually fit! Once again I have what is considered a small head and the hat fits my head even with the wig off. It is even made of sturdy material and stays on my head without me having to pin it down. Once in a while, it fell off.<br /><br />- The coloring is beautiful and there were very minor loose yarns hanging.<br /><br />Cons.<br /><br />- The Blue part that connects to the black jumper is ridiculously huge, and will need to be tailored it as if it was designed for someone who an XL to 2XL in size. I had to military-type pin it at the sides.<br /><br />- The velcro part on the Blue piece was very low down too, the belt basically huge slightly below my booty.<br /><br />- The cape: was a tad snug in the upper arms but fit fine near the lower arm parts. However, it was kinda snug near the neck area and the button to get it on and off is a nightmare especially if you don't have help.<br /><br />- If you are claustrophobic or have a fear of suffocation I would avoid this outfit, it will trigger it for it. Especially with how tight or close some of the neckpieces are.<br /><br />- The black fuzzy thing for around the neck was simply itchy.<br /><br />- Quality of Vision was poor, I ended up using a different vision I already had.<br /><br />- I had to sew on the buttons on the blue part of the outfit, they came barely hanging by a trend on both sides. One even came off upon me trying it on.<br /><br />- The shoulder pads, a nice quality I like how there sew on and not the type you take on and off. That stated if you wear a mini backpack as I do. Be advised it will get caught on the shoulder parts at a time.<br /><br />Overall Thoughts & Ranking.<br /><br />It was a decent outfit, was it worth the price of $146 bucks (that including tax) not really. I probably could of gotten something custom made for a bit cheaper if given time. But considering this outfit was prime and in fact arrived a day earlier than scheduled gives it a bonus point.<br />Will I wear it again? Probably. But, not after I do some serious modifications to it.<br /><br />Fabric Rating; 8/10 (Wore it in 70 F Degree weather) (Was not too hot or too cold in it)<br /><br />Sizing; 7/10 most things fit but somethings were kinda chaotic.<br /><br />Colouration; 10/10 was rather bright and vivid.<br /><br />Craftsmanship: 7/10 could of done better.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 7.5/10"
4.0,Two different kinds of zippers. Two of the three had great zipper stayed up good and fit nice. Third one had a different kind of zipper wouldn't stay up for anything ended up having to toss it. Still a decent price for two. Would have been better price if I would have gotten three I could use. Would I buy it again probably not
4.0,"Ok fit not as cute as picture but a nice quality shirt, runs SMALL"
4.0,No complaints for the price paid.  Not world class but good for on the go protection. Will do the job.
4.0,The fit was great and material is comfortable..seems durable after first wash...my only problem is that the colour is dull...washed out a little
4.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter for Disneyland next summer in a 2T, but found that it fits her at 12 months. It runs  small (my daughter is small for her age anyways), but the fabric is super soft and the pattern is adorable. I would definitely buy this again, but make sure to go a size up!"
4.0,Beautiful color and good material especially for the price. Definitely would recommend
4.0,"Cute dress, fit tight in chest area for me, but great seller!"
4.0,Good all
4.0,"The swiming suit is nice, the hat is too small. But the colors are bright and it was a very good surprise for my son."
4.0,"While I normally wear size medium, I followed the size chart and ordered an XL. It fits well enough, but a little larger than I expected. Super cute though! I love the flamingos and received several compliments while out and about."
4.0,This is a very practical item when shooting photographs. I do not normally have pockets and find myself needing to hang onto some small items during a shoot. The zipper pouch is a game changed!
4.0,"It is very pretty and elegant but if you are shy, or modest, this one up top is a deeper V than I imagined so it is legit, lowwwwww cut.<br /><br />In all other regard, this is a very nice suit I got for a colleague and we all agree that it is beautiful but it is too low cut for her.  Everything else is perfect."
4.0,Fun to fidget with
4.0,It slips down constantly.
4.0,"Overall they are nice and I love the material, but the pockets to me are a little bulky but overall they are the length I prefer and are pretty comfortable."
4.0,The pants are a little too long! A very comfortable wear.
4.0,Bought this as a surprise to wear for my niece's birthday as she loves bread! She like Cats to so i thought this would give her a good laugh since we were not able to celebrate properly because of coronavirus. Costume was good but at 5'4 I was just a little too short to see out the head but was able to make it work if I held my arms in the right position.  We still had a good time with it and she loves to put it on and run around in it even if she is too short as well
4.0,"I should start by saying that I'm pretty finicky about briefs. I've found very few in my life that I actually like. Having said that, these are pretty good - they're wearable - unlike the last brand I tried. I like the material - it's very light. The one thing I noticed when I unpackaged was that waist band is quite high. This doesn't have an adverse effect on me, as I'm 6'3"". A shorter person, however, might find that these waistbands are too high. I feel that they run just a tiny bit small, but not drastically. They fit more like a compression brief."
4.0,"The necklace is very pretty. The pendant is hand made and very colorful. However the ties on the necklace are a little crooked, it makes it difficult to readjust the length of the leather chain. Other than that a great piece."
4.0,"It's ok, not a great item. Does very little at blocking wind or keeping warm."
4.0,"Good product, multi color but lighter shades of colors depicted. Good deal if bought together with the black Coral pearl. I would still recommend it. It was delivered early too."
4.0,"These shades are very cute. I love the fact that they are different than what I'm seeing in the stores right now. The hues in the front are very nice, I think that is my favorite part about them. The purple frame also adds some uniqueness. These were worth the wait, I hope to get a lot of use out of them The frames are larger than I've worn before but they look nice on, just a fun pair of shade. I did find the handles to feel a bit cheap though although the frame itself seems sturdy. They are also darker than I thought. So I can only wear them in very bright sun which means I'll still get a lot of use out of them in FL. But as long as you know what you're getting, don't let it stop you from enjoying these really cool shades. I received this product at a discount for my honest review."
4.0,"Good quality for the price, helped me remain organized before & during the trip and made unpacking easier too. The white with flamingos is adoreble"
4.0,Very soft and comfortable that I use it as pajamas
4.0,Very cute! The print is just big enough. Perfect for my daughter's dance shoes to and from.
4.0,"IT HAS POCKETS. Fits very tight at just, very long but great"
4.0,Nice casual skirt.
4.0,"I normally wear a 9 in jeans I bought a medium and it fit loose. I feel like maybe someone put them on first then they sent them to me. It had no tag inside and they are the same size as the gray but the gray fit way better?  I do have a lot of belly fat so I wish they were just a tad higher in the waist, but over all I liked it. I weigh about 145 and I’m 5ft 1inch tall. I may have to get a size small?"
4.0,"Brought it for a family member, they really like the product"
4.0,"Okay so I was skeptical to order this bathing suit, for obvious reasons. But im 5'1 140 lbs, I don't have a big chest but I have a big butt. I ordered the large and it perfectly. Fit my butt great and was cheeky but so cute. I recommend getting an xl if u have big boobs because the top didn't have much stretch for me. But overall the bathing suit is super cute and the orange color looks great on tan skin!"
4.0,"Very pretty, but a couple of the larger rhinestones were loose in the box. I was able to superglue them back in place. I got a lot of complements on it at the event we attended."
4.0,"These socks are great! Very warm and soft. My only reason for four stars, is because the thread (which is used for the star appliqué) is too scratchy around my ankle. I folded them and it fixed the cause of irritation. Overall, I’d buy them again."
4.0,Very nice charm. Perfect for Mother's Day
4.0,Wanted to wear as a nursing top with the buttons but quickly realized the buttons are decorative. Still worked well as long as I had a nursing tank underneath.
4.0,This fit me perfect.  I love the crochet style and stretch.  It is very short but that's okay because it is meant to be worn over a swimsuit at the beach or lake.
4.0,"While these chokers were definitely worth the price I paid, there were a few issues with quality. Three of them have broken so far (coming apart at one of the chain links), but it was very easy to fix if you know what you're doing and have the right tools. A few of them were too big for me to wear, though I do probably have a smaller neck than most (12.5 inches)."
4.0,"Warm, comfortable, fits as expected.  Not a lot to argue with, and the price was right.  If I have any negatives after I've washed it, I'll add them in later."
4.0,"Fast delivery and nice fit. However material bleeds, even after laundering."
4.0,"Fits right and looks good. But the material does not breath, so beware."
4.0,"A bit snug, but sooo cute! They remind me of my Peru trip each time I wear them"
4.0,Very good holder cover but buttonsotherwise a very nuce case. need to be pressed hard after install.
4.0,No issues with it. but was hoping for more or ticker cusion
4.0,"Not too heavy, not too light.  Just right for rolling up and stashing in a backpack or gym bag for when the weather gets nippy. It's also a good choice for traveling.  I like the zip opening the reveals a fold  of material .  The stripe on the sleeves is another nice accent.  This is a basic pull over that is a little smarter looking than most.<br /><br />The tunic has muff pockets, kangaroo pockets to the younger crowd. The material is a cotton polyester blend which is lightweight and can be machine washed.  The only problem with this material is that it's a bit more susceptible to stains.  This is a cute top that is suitable for young and old alike."
4.0,"This is a great shoe.  Cute shoe for a boy, great quality.  But it's NOT a GIRL'S shoe as the description states so I'm giving 4 stars.  I decided not to return it because I have a younger son who will eventually grow into the bigger size I had purchased for my daughter. I thought it would work well as a unisex shoe even once I saw the box said it was boys...but it's too masculine in my opinion."
4.0,Better if short sleeve for our application
4.0,Some were difficult to remove the balls but they work perfectly.
4.0,"Overall, I think these will be good, but they do wrinkle a lot after washing, even when pulling out damp.  They're cotton, so not a surprise.  Colors are vibrant and wash well."
4.0,"Its a hoodie for sure ins not that thin it will keep you warm in like, 45⁰ or more whether I highly recommend this for  Andy Super M stans I got a medium or large and it was perfect."
4.0,The necklace is exactly what I wanted and the pearls are beautiful!
4.0,Worked great for our Wreck it Ralph and Fix it felix costume
4.0,Product was slightly smaller than similar product in same size from other companies and fit more snugly in waist and arms.
4.0,"Fit is big enough , but odd shape."
4.0,"This dress is so fun to wear! It wasn't as long as I expected. I am 5' 10&#34;, ordered a large, and the bottom of the skirt doesn't quite come to my ankles. It's still gorgeous and fun, but if you're tall, it won't be floor length like in the picture."
4.0,"Having just had my second baby, I've been on the hunt for a supportive, comfortable nursing bra. I am well endowed even when not pregnant/nursing so this has been a challenge. After my first son was born, I bought the Anita nursing bra #5068 and LOVED it. I loved it so much, that I bought a couple more this time around. The problem is, my boobs are bigger and I could no longer fit the #5068 (I'm wearing a 40G). What I needed in the Anita was a cupsize bigger and I would've been set. But that wasn't an option so my search began and I found the Elomi.<br /><br />If what you are looking for is support, then this is the bra for you! I feel very well supported and even a bit perky! Initially, the bra was not very comfortable - it would rub under my breasts - but now fits well. This bra is not at all attractive so if that's what you want, don't buy this bra. The straps on this bra are also wider than the Anita. I guess that's good for support but makes it difficult to hide with straps on a tank top. Another thing is the clasps. You can't unhook the cup one handed - or if you can, I haven't figured it out. Thats not a big deal for me but if you need to do a quick release, again this isn't the bra for you.<br /><br />All in all, I still prefer the Anita but this is a decent replacement and the price is reasonable compared to a lot of the other nursing bras available for plus sized women."
4.0,quick delivery and accurate product.
4.0,"l was so hopeful that this wouldn’t be that spandex material. But it is. l won’t return it though, it is cute and will make a great summer/ travel dress.<br />l’m 5’0 150lbs and l bought a small. Fits as expected."
4.0,Comfortable socks.  Good quality.  The colors are a little tough to matchup with a few pair
4.0,Very comfortable walking shoes.  The extra wide size leaves room for comfort.
4.0,"I ordered the blue lense glasses. The fit is absolutely amazing and comfortable. They are great driving glasses and great for casual wear also. The only downside I have is the bows are so thin that I'm afraid just taking off or putting on may break them. Other than that, they are very great and have a nice pouch along with a buffing cloth.<br /><br />All in all, these are great for the price!"
4.0,They worked well in my professional kitchen. The fabric is very thin. Not sure how long they would last. Would buy them again for my staff.
4.0,Cute just a little loose
4.0,"I would give this 5 stars, except that I can occasionally feel the not so smooth ball on the end scrape the inside of my nose. It wasn't expensive, so I get it, but if the plastic has been smoothed down more for the inside, it would be *perfect*."
4.0,Fit over the visor.
4.0,I got these earrings because I wanted a pair of hoop earrings with a twist. They completely deliver what was promissed in their product description.<br />The finish is amazing and they shine and sparkle from every angle.<br />The only down side is that they are a bit heavy for my ears (although I have a low tolerance to weight I must add). But they are great for a party or to add some bling to your everyday accesories.<br />Highly recommended
4.0,too small but very pretty ..it didnt size my sister whom i originally bought it for so i gave it to a church members daughter
4.0,I like it and is defintely a crop top.<br />If you wear regular jeans show belly button. Is nice to go with high raise jeans.
4.0,"The material is thin and suitable for wearing from spring to autumn. The size of the pants is generous, so it is very comfortable to wear when you wear it. Personally most preferred style. The only thing missing is that the length of the s size is one centimeter longer and the width of the hem is one centimeter longer."
4.0,This was not white - it came as cream
4.0,"It was very cute and comfy.. I had to keep pulling sleeves down, but satisfied"
4.0,Love the feel. Fits as expected. Just what I was looking for.
4.0,Awesome jewellery
4.0,"I like the shirt it's fun, will be nice with jeans this Fall.  I'm 5'6  size 12 so I ordered a L..  It's a snug fitting shirt so fyi.. If you like loose shirts this is not it.. Order up if you are larger on the top."
4.0,I really loved the quality of these yoga pants! I loved that they aren't see through! I also loved that they have pockets on both sides!<br />I didn't like that they kept falling down when I walked and I had to keep pulling them up. That's why I gave only 4 stars. I guess I should have ordered a size down.
4.0,Perfectly simple
4.0,Haven’t used yet but quality looks good.
4.0,"Yes, very nice."
4.0,a little tighter but expected.
4.0,Good product!!  I really like it
4.0,These are super cute and very well made. They will work out perfect for my bonus daughter’s 6th grade camp trip in January. They are a little big around the ankle but they will worn just fine for her.
4.0,"The material was a bit thinner than expected, but overall a good product."
4.0,"These compression shorts fit well and I really like the fact that there are two pockets. I'm not a huge fan of the different colored seams, but I knew that's what I was getting, I just wish there was an option of the grey and navy shorts with same-color seams to make them less conspicuous."
4.0,"It's a very cute necklace. I gave it 3 stars because mine arrived broken. I have ordered another because it is exactly what I wanted, so I'm hoping I have better luck with a new one!<br />UPDATE - new one arrived and it looks great. I would have given it 5 stars, but both earring posts were bent badly during shipping. I was able to straighten them with pliers and think they will be fine. I can't wait to wear this set!"
4.0,"Loved great on my boy!! just didn't have it in a large size which is what we needed, but we were able to make it work."
4.0,"Cute , hard to click in and out"
4.0,"Order 3X to fit a 2X; size seems to run small, at least at this end of the scale. Typical construction with the useless little &quot;buckle&quot; on the adjustment strap at the back but we're used to that even on vests costing 3X as much. The tie's an added bonus."
4.0,"A lot nicer than anticipated.  Thinner fabric but still warm.  Sleeves are a bit short and thought it would be a bit longer but that doesn’t take away from the comfort.  Reason for 4⭐️ Is the white flaw smack in the middle of the front and the shorter sleeves.  Overall, a great purchase and would recommend."
4.0,Wore this dress to a birthday party at a club.  My friends loved it. Definitely has a lot of stretch in it. I'm 5'5&#34; and about 150 lbs and I got the xl. Figure I could've gotten away with a large though but the xl is quite comfortable and not restricting
4.0,"It did fit well but the top was pretty loose. The piece that is meant to cover my stomach was small. The rest of the outfit was good, material was nice too."
4.0,"The socks are cute, fun, and well-made. What you see is what you get ... and that’s fun!"
4.0,Its a bit scratchy but it fits perfectly
4.0,Such an adorable shirt and great quality. My daughter wore it for a farm themed photo shoot.
4.0,I love the rings!! Good quality small and cute.  I have had them I believe for more than a month and nothing has happened to them.  The only thing I didn’t like was that they don’t carry all the birthstone.. I was trying to do a mother ring and the only one I need is November.  Been looking for something similar but other venders are to pricey.  Would love to get my November ring. 🥺
4.0,"The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because the bottom goes up really high which wasn’t expected, but otherwise this set is very comfy, stretchy, and fits very comfortably. Not too big, not too tight. Not the best quality and it does wrinkle easily... but if you’re looking for a comfy pajama set this one is decent."
4.0,"It doesn't look exactly like the one in the picture for one.  2. It's kinda snug and is giving me a muffin top where my ribs are,  yes it went up that far and I heard some ripping as I was getting it over my booty.  I just got it today and I'm wearing it for the 1st time.  I got a medium , I'm 5'5 at 130 lbs and it barely fit my booty,  probably should have gone with a large but not sure if it would have been too big"
4.0,Receipant loves it
4.0,I purchased a size up. Fit but super tight.
4.0,I like these id buy again
4.0,"Great looking hat, the pictures don't really do it justice."
4.0,"Were okay. Had to cut slits to get my ears into them, but maybe I have extremely large ears. Purchased for a one-time costume as a dwarf from Snow White."
4.0,"I have a super small waist and very long legs, but I ordered accoding to the chart and it fit :) the only reason it doesn't get five stars is that it flares out, which I wasn't really expecting. The waistband is stretchy but doesn't have belt loops, so if you mess up the sizing, your kinda screwed."
4.0,The DKNY blazer is a beautiful gray color and excellent quality. Unfortunately the sleeves were too long for my short arms. I was going to alter it but the row of buttons made it too big of a job for me. If you are average height (I’m not!) this blazer will likely be perfect.
4.0,Not the biggest fan of the material but everything else is good.
4.0,"This is a tough one. I ordered this in white and they sent black. The label on the plastic bag said white so I'm not sure if they're all mislabeled or not. I don't like this style of dress in black but in white I think it's stunning so I'm so terribly and disappointed. I ordered small, the smallest size. I'm 5'2 and 105 lbs. There is no chance that the dress on the model in the photo is unaltered. This dress is really big on me. However I like it a lot and I'll probably be happy to pay to get it altered, if I can get a white one. It's $42 with a 15 percent off coupon which I think is fair. There were a few loose threads but other than that it feels nice. The material is soft and there is a nice liner on the skirt section as well. The zipper works and is a typical dress zipper. The buttons are a solid beige plastic."
4.0,"performed as I expected, could not ask for more"
4.0,"I bought this for my Anna halloween costume and am overall happy with it, but it's not perfect:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great quality wig for the price<br />Not too shiny and fake looking<br />Perfect color for my look<br /><br />Cons:<br />No white streak. Not pink, not white, nothing.<br />Not braided, which is not a problem since I can braid myself.<br /><br />I would buy this version again anyway since it's easy to add the streak myself and the wig quality is worth it."
4.0,I bought this when I saw it pop up for $9.99. When it’s that cheap and you have free returns with Prime....I had to know! LOL<br /><br />It isn’t leopard which should be obvious from the pic (despite the description). It looks just like the photo. Mustard coloring with dark blue flowers. It’s like a chiffon type material so it hangs nicely. It’s super roomy but doesn’t look weird when you tighten the tie. I normally would go for a small in something like this but only medium was available. It totally doesn’t matter though (I didn’t look at the difference in measurements but it seems to me like any one size could accommodate Quite a span of sizes). The waist tie is sewn in and can cinched tighter or looser. The top of the shoulder straps have a short tie you can cinch the top of the straps if you want. They can be tucked under too if you want the straps wider (or tie to a bra strap maybe). There’s no slit on the skirt part and symmetrical hemline which I like. It is at my ankles just above my feet and I’m about 5’8”.<br /><br />I’ll have to take a pic of it on and update later. pleasantly surprised with this one.<br /><br />As usual I subtract one star only because I feel like nobody takes 5 stars serious lol and I haven’t had it long enough to really vouch 5 stars lol
4.0,"Very pretty earrings! I like the concept of the screw on backs, however they do not screw on far enough. With just the screw on back, the earrings hang from my ear and get caught on my hair,  I put the plastic spacer on,  then the screw on back, they fit a lot better."
4.0,"A really cute seashell necklace made ofl shells, fake pearls  and golden charm starfishes It is very heavy. . It was a great price. I really like the necklace but the chain is now turning a dull dark color. I will probably will have to replace the chain that goes around the neck. It may not affect everyone like it affected me."
4.0,"Perfet winter sweater. I  Wear it with dress pants or casual pants or even with pair of jeans, just looks perfect. Just hope the lints wont come though."
4.0,"Great dress, but it is pretty sheer through the chest/torso. A slip would work from the waist down, but since it’s backless, wearing any kind of extra layer at the top isn’t possible. I will have to have my seamstress see if it’s possible to sew in a thin layer in the top. Otherwise it’s a great dress!"
4.0,It was a gift not sure how it will fit.
4.0,This is a very cute jump suite
4.0,Beautiful print. Colors are vibrant and material is not thin and drapes nicely. Knew it would be too long but it is really long! Will need to cut off some before hemming.
4.0,Cute but order a size down its long. I love it but you will have to layer or throw on a cute cardigan or jacket.
4.0,Cute but smaller at the waist than expected.
4.0,It was exactly what I needed to go over my swim suit as that is how I like to wear them. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the liner made it too tight but I cut it out since it wasn’t needed. Then it fit great
4.0,THE SIZE WAS TO SMALL GAVE IT TOO MY DAUGHTERS TWO EACH.
4.0,My wife loved this it was dainty which she liked especially for typing and I was extremely impressed
4.0,"This is so cute!  The fit is perfect.  Not too tight, not too roomy.  The quality is great.  These shorts are super cute and can go with a lot of tops.  Also the length is good for me."
4.0,The print was a little spread out
4.0,Nice craftsmanship but a bit small
4.0,"All 3 shirts fit fine, and were exactly what I ordered."
4.0,It is a very comfortable hoodie.  The only complaint I would have is that for the size I need and purchased the neck hole is a bot small for my heard to fit though easily.
4.0,"I’m 5’9”, wear 8/10 pants typically. It’s often a struggle to choose between medium and large when shopping online. I bought these in medium and they fit nicely. Just don’t put these pjs in the dryer. Lesson learned the hard way when my pj pants turned into pj capris. I stuck them back in the washer, then stretched them back to pant length again. It worked out. These are definitely adorable and comfortable too."
4.0,Just thinner than anticipated for the winter yet will be perfect for the summer. It is very convertible. .
4.0,"Its made for wider faces which means that I have to extra tight it. The vision through the lenses is very impressive. Better than expected. Rinse and clean as soon as you get off the water,"
4.0,I had to give it away item was to oooooooo small
4.0,Good quality but thermal side of band was hot. Would be great for winter. I wore it on a hike and suffered heat exhaustion. Don't wear during the summer winter it would be perfect. Think &#34;inside of a sweatshirt&#34; as the band texture with a bandana covering it.
4.0,"I bought this dress on a whim because it looked like it would be a good cut for me - and I am very pleased with it.  I wore it to work last week and got many compliments.  The material is a little slippery - I don't know what I was expecting, but it must be some sort of lycra blend.  Regardless, it's super cute and fits like a dream."
4.0,"Fits true to size, very cute purchase"
4.0,It's a comfortable top. You can dress it up or use casual.
4.0,Great. Wish it had a bra in it. Fits great.
4.0,Price appropriate.
4.0,These are the best! They really are comfortable when working out!
4.0,"Pretty well made, great value for the price."
4.0,"Amazing... 20 labrets for $10.69. They are beautiful, shimmery and perfect for a Medusa piercing. My only complaint is that the posts only come in an 8mm length. I wish they came in 6mm. Other than that, I'm totally happy with my purchase."
4.0,"This is adorable, just didn’t give a 5 star because of sizing. I ordered a small and it is huge! Like a L or XL. The shirt is nice quality and cute tho! I ordered for a gift, may have to exchange after daughter opens. I still recommend for its cuteness.<br />UPDATE: daughter loves it even tho it’s a little big. It’s very soft and cute!"
4.0,Love the color. Really like the length. It has to be colder for me to use it. The wigs very nice.<br />It will definitely be my go to jacket.<br />Shirley Ann Taylor
4.0,"it worked well for my trip, could fit passports, lipstick, phone, essentials.  It does have a funny smell, however."
4.0,"My thin 11 year old wears size 8 in these shorts, they are still plenty long.  They are great for travel as they don't overly wrinkle and a light weight.  The blend fabric is cool for summer."
4.0,I recommend this product. It's very warm and durable.
4.0,A cute addition for pirate custume.Safe toy.A bit flimsy but its just for playing imaginary pirates.
4.0,I like this hooded shirt it’s a little tighter in the shoulders and arm area. The rest fits fine.
4.0,"Ok, but the size was not as listed.  Made it work with double faced tape."
4.0,These shoe holders are a nice travel accessory. They are large if you are only putting flipflops in them (can get 2 in one sleeve) or would be just right for a larger shoe or one with a heal. Much nicer than just putting your shoes in an old bag you get at the grocery store which is what I used to do before this. I recommend this item.
4.0,The word “BUSINESS” embossed on the shoes messed up the product. That should have been embossed under the soles where you can’t see. Would have been looking like high end product but ruined by the embossed  ”BUSINESS”.
4.0,This product is just as you should expect for the price point.
4.0,Hat was dented but I looks really nice and customer care was super great about a refund
4.0,This is the smallest winder i have found. works well. i use on trips and i use it in my safe to keep my watch ready!
4.0,"Very pretty, but not for small wrists. The watch moves too much. Not sure how long it would last stretching it over your had constantly. I would figure out a way to take it in and off by undoing one side of the watch. However, mine is going back due to size."
4.0,It was smaller than expected. Should've went with xl instead of the suggested
4.0,"I am very satisfied with my purchase. Everything was correct with the item. I look forward to to buying more items from the seller, hopefully in the near future."
4.0,These are great! They give good support and launder very nicely.
4.0,It runs very big so I ordered 2 sizes down. The sleeves fit comfortably and it is a good length. The fabric is soft and cool. Sadly it opens  In the front almost to my belly button.
4.0,The quality of these earrings was far more than I would have anticipated with costume jewelry at this price. The recipient was thrilled.
4.0,I'm not a long-distance cyclist but get out for an hour or two most weeks and these shorts make the trip much more comfortable.
4.0,They are as pretty as pictured...but after like three days started ripping a little from getting the chapstick’s top in and out
4.0,"On sizing I ignored the size chart provided and went with my usual XL, although I have a 37&#34; waist I wear XL of Underarmour and every other brand, XL has always been the perfect size for me. The XL order arrived and they were too loose, I reordered in Large (36&#34;-38&#34; according to chart) and they are perfect for my waist, so the chart was right in my case. The material is slippery as snot on the outside with a slightly rougher texture on the inside. I have chosen to wear them inside out to keep the slippery side against my skin, this also keeps the sewn on tags on the outside, I deducted one star for the tags otherwise I am very happy with these. On length they are fine and do not go below my shorts which are above the knee. Time will tell how well they hold up through washing and drying, they went through one gentle/cool cycle of each and appear unaffected."
4.0,"Lovely, easy-to-wear earrings"
4.0,Color and material not what I expected but I still like it!
4.0,I bought this outfit to match another apron I had purchased. I had bought other chefs hats that were horrible period This one is substantially better quality.
4.0,"Runs a little small, and the zipper is kind of a pain but it's really cute when it's on. Pretty tight in the boob area, I wear a 36D, so I wore a bandeau and it was way better"
4.0,The sweater fits great on my 15 month old baby girl
4.0,The shipping was way too high...... It fits good and I like it.
4.0,Very cute. Soft. Great color but be careful to cold water wash alone the first few times. The color does bleed. A little bigger than I hoped but fine. I wish the crotch seam were different but my daughter loves the leotard.
4.0,"Love that the bag is removable, so on light days my daughter use as a backpack and on heavy days use the pulley. Easy to assembly worth the price"
4.0,"I am in love with these! Im between 5'7 and 5'8 and these come up about 3 to 4inches over my knee, so definitely thigh high. I wish they could be a little thicker/stronger, but its totally fine."
4.0,"The pendant is gorgeous but thinner and less substantial-feeling than other jewelry I've bought from them. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Soft and comfortable, this piece covers well."
4.0,This is an amazing piece of jewelry.
4.0,"WOW... 3 PAIRS OF FUN, CONTEMPORARY-LOOKING WAYFARER SUNGLASSES - AT AND UNBEATABLE PRICE FOR A SINGLE PAIR, LET ALONE A TRIO. THE FRAME COLORS ARE COOL... THE LENSES COLORS ARE NEAT AND THEY LOOK/FEEL LIKE THOSE COSTING MORE."
4.0,Works as described and well worth the price when compared to other name brands!
4.0,Nice hat but had to return because it was to small.
4.0,The dress is very comfortable except for the arms they are elastic and are sometimes too tight if you’re not careful I kept having to pull them down but the dress itself is very pretty and comfortable outside of the elastic arms
4.0,"I am not ""busty"" but the L was very tight - I returned & got the XL it is fine!  It washed up great and is very comfy now."
4.0,"Reviews said it runs a bit big, and it does, otherwise it's fine."
4.0,"They don't have the best stopping mechanism for keeping them in, but it's a great value. I'm also not sure if it's just my piercing, since I've never had great luck with keeping a nose stud for more than a few weeks. None of the gems fell out, even being rattled in a case that I keep a few spares in."
4.0,Love the necklace and have worn it several times.  Has one flaw which is that it will not lay against your skin at the clasp. It sticks up and if you have long hair it gets caught. Plus it doesn't look good. You need to wear tops that we will cover the back of your neck for looks and your hair.
4.0,"Smaller than I expected (I like a big bag), but still a very lovely bag. I like that it has a zippered top. My main reason for buying this bag was the dragonfly print and I'm very pleased with the bag overall.  I would recommend this tote to everyone."
4.0,"These are so cute and look exactly as pictured. Even with bare feet, these run SMALL. I am usually a size 8, rarely an 8.5, and the 8 (my usual size in ugg slippers) was WAY too small. I ordered the 9 and even these barely fit, especially with fuzzy winter socks. The length is good but the toe box is pretty snug. Rubberized sole has decent traction on my hardwood floors."
4.0,Bought this for my daughter and it fit perfectly and looked beautiful.  Unlike a lot of other clothing in this style I liked that it didn't show a lot of cleavage and such because my daughter is 13 not 23.
4.0,Very summery and stylish. Very comfortable to wear. My only complaint is the inside pocket is small and nothing really stays in it. Be sure the straps are tight before snapping it shut or else everything will fall out!
4.0,"My son loves this jacket. It looks great, the pocket zippers are nice quality, the material is heavy duty and flexible. He has only had it a few days, but I will update this post after it has been washed for the first time."
4.0,Good material  and love it to wear everyday
4.0,"Nice coat. Perfect for fall. Keeps the chill at bay. Decent quality and attractive design. Overall, I am pleased and so his my son."
4.0,"We ordered these for our son, but they are not quite the right size for him. The quality was pretty good and if your child is smaller, they probably would work, but not for us."
4.0,I bot this for a trip that we are about to take. Everything looks good. So fare I’m very happy with this purchase.
4.0,"I absolutely love, Love, Love the coat, however it was too small!!!... SOOO DISAPPOINTED‼️‼️<br />I had to return it!!!...<br /><br />Sandi"
4.0,"Delivery on time, God quality as a picture"
4.0,"They are great, but a bit snug, but maybe that means it won't stretch out too quickly."
4.0,a little bigger than i though but its good nonetheless
4.0,"From first feel it feel heavy duty and strong. i've only had it a week but feels good. the zippers don't feel like they will fail soon. my only ding is that i wish i got the larger one. i have a15.6 laptop and it won't fit in the laptop sleeve in the back of it. i have to put it in the main compartment.  if this was just 1"" taller it would be perfect. the straps on the outside keep the backpack tight. it is comfortable to wear."
4.0,"Fit perfectly.  Comfortable, like a t-shirt."
4.0,"I like this top, but it is pretty darn snug at the shoulders and I usually have a terrible time finding tops that are small enough for my very narrow shoulders."
4.0,"Super swagarific, but kinda bad for driving (in the USA anyway). They make green lights look yellow and red lights like.. also another color.<br /><br />You can make it a game and try to figure out which light means what as you'read driving but I guess that can be a little dangerous, so I suppose you shouldn't do that.<br /><br />Great effect though! All the honeys would be scoping me on the regular with these bad boys no joke."
4.0,very comfy. but starts to wear out after one or two months of use.
4.0,"I really like it, but it is a little long (hits below my knees but a good two inches)  and the neck was a little long as well. otherwise, it was gorgeous and I loved it!!"
4.0,"Bought this shirt for my Retired Army boyfriend. He's between a L-XL, the XL fit him perfectly."
4.0,"When I ordered this for my 14-year-old daughter, I expected it to be a traditional sweatshirt and pants.  When it arrived, I was a little surprised that the top is a cropped sweatshirt.  I did give the outfit four stars for several reasons:  the bright colors and she loves how the sweatshirt swirls around her waist; however, I would NOT let her wear it out in public. The material is not super soft like some of her sweatshirts but not so uncomfortable that she will not wear it.  She likes it to wear around the house."
4.0,Although I really don't like things that are round in shape I like the look of the material from which this is made.  Have received some compliement on it as well.  I think it is plastic (it is very lightweight) but doesn't look like plastic.
4.0,Love it. I got so many compliments. Lots of room. But the strap adjuster isn’t very secure. Had to tighten it back up multiple times.
4.0,Good buy but sometimes slide off ankles
4.0,"Got this for my husband. It fits great and the color is a good tan shade. It is quite heavy, but not necessarily a bad thing. It does fray a little and extremely &#34;linty&#34;. Little particles of this fabric float everywhere, I'm not sure about how long this will last. But keeps him warm at least, just got to try to keep from sneezing. Fast shipping and great packaging."
4.0,"Good looking, comfortable sandals!"
4.0,Bra would be great for 40D and under. I’m a 40H so the ladies were to squished. The fabric has a great feel and is well constructed
4.0,I like the product and I’m wearing it to church.
4.0,"Overall I love this swimsuit. I wanted something a bit more modest to wear in the pool when people come to our house and this works perfect for that. The only issue I have is that the bottoms don’t come up high enough for my liking. I have a typical mom bod post 2 c-sections so I like higher waisted bottoms but otherwise it’s great. I normally wear an XL or 2XL depending on fit so I ordered a 2XL based on other reviews. I’m 5 feet, 200 lbs. I’ve already ordered a second one of these!"
4.0,"They're not as soft as I would like which is the only reason I gave them 4 stars in stead of 5.  Other than that, they fit well, are made well, comfortable and after working/walking hard in them for months, their color and shape have held up!  I would purchase them again."
4.0,"Nice watch, easy to read for aging eyes. A little larger face than I expected, but not a deal breaker."
4.0,Received item fast and was just what the picture showed.
4.0,Fabric a little thin but I just wear a cami underneath. I got ivory color and I like it. A little big on me but I ordered the large not wanting it to be tight fitting. I’m petite and weigh 130lbs. Sleeves are too long on me but I just roll them up a little. Overall I happy with it.
4.0,"Great color, very pretty details, but handle carefully as it is fragile."
4.0,"I got this to compare with a Filson Original Briefcase, and ended up going with the Original, but that's not to say this this isn't a nice bag. The 24-hr is made out of their &#34;tin cloth,&#34; which is a thinner, softer material than that of the Original. For that reason, it has a slightly &#34;frumpier&#34; appearance, which, depending on your use case, is either a pro or con. For me, being in a slightly more formal business setting, I wanted something that looked cleaner and crisper, which the Original fits better.<br /><br />That said, the 24-hr has some great features over the Original. The two zipper compartments on the outside are handy for quick access while you're commuting or waiting to board a plane. The loop on the back for sliding over your carry-on handle is really nice too, and something the Original lacks. It's very roomy inside and has a laptop sleeve, although it doesn't offer much padding for your laptop (same as the Original), so you might consider a padded sleeve for your laptop.<br /><br />In the end, I would have kept this over the Original if I wanted a slightly more casual-looking bag, but it's great if that's what you need."
4.0,Have worn these at night to sleep in instead of the splint. I do believe they make a difference and would recommend them!
4.0,I loved the style of the elastic and the colors. The only thing is I have very small wrists and the adjustable band was almost doubled around my wrist and got kind of thick. I ended up cutting and sewing the elastic to fit me and I'm absolutely in love with these now.
4.0,A little lighter/thinner than I thought they would be.
4.0,I got these to go underneath my motorcycle pants and they are great! That little extra padding makes all the difference when you are on the back of a crotchrocket for 800 miles! Thank you!
4.0,Runs small. I returned and ordered a size up.
4.0,"I like this style, I do, but this necklace arrived with most of the little crystal gems missing. It's not a huge deal - I mean, it's disappointing, sure, but I can glue on new crystals myself. I make jewelry for myself (and yet I keep buying it premade, I know, I know) so I have the crystals and the glue. I only mention it because you may receive this necklace with missing gems as well."
4.0,The material was good but shirt runs smaller than expected.
4.0,can dress it up or down looks much more costly than it was ...  always a plus!!
4.0,Great product I liked it
4.0,"Real leather,,wow the only dis like was belt loop holder comes off when you remove it(design flaw)"
4.0,My granddaughter wears a size 9 and I bought the 10.  Fits like a 9 would on her.
4.0,i love the design and material of the dress but the length of it is a bit shorter then I would have liked. I like my dresses to hit my knees but this one is a few inches above.
4.0,"I loved these! They're great quality.<br />My only complaint is that they're not a one size fits all, or 0-3 months. It's a pack of 20 socks, ranging from 0-12m sizes. And they're not labeled, so theres no way to tell which size is which."
4.0,"Fit true to size, beautiful"
4.0,"I’m a bit unsure about these actually being polarized. (I’ve only worn them a couple times so I’ll continue to check on that). Other than that, I ordered the champagne color and they’re simple, cute and comfy if you’re a fan of oversized shades."
4.0,"Purchased the purple top size Large. I am 5'6, 160lb, size 12 or large so this fit true to size.<br />I liked that it was just the right length with the side slits. Looks good from front or side view. The neckline did not sit off the shoulder for me which is preferred. The color is good and the fabric and stitching appear good. It is a little thicker material that I'd prefer for a summer top but overall looks and fits nice."
4.0,The material on the umbrella is thin. I expected it to be a heavier material. I hope the color doesn’t fade in the sun. We’ll see how it holds up.
4.0,The dress is nice but the medium was really big. I would recommend taking a size smaller than your usual size.
4.0,top needs to be a bit bigger
4.0,So gorgeous! Tons of compliments on this piece!
4.0,Has in the box everything promise and they work very well. Thanks for giving me this option as the company I bought from before stopped making metal stays.
4.0,"Finally got the chance to wear this during a storm, and it held up pretty well. I stayed completely dry inside after having to walk to my car when the rain was pouring hard outside."
4.0,Nice shirt for work
4.0,"The hem and seams are good. The fabric is soft. It fits a little larger than expected. I'm petite and thinner than average. I got a small, and it's a little big on me. I will wear a camisole under it for work because of the open stitching of the pattern."
4.0,Nice for iPhone but does not fit my new galaxy 6. Otherwise nice. Guess I will have to look further for another one.
4.0,Solar and sapphire Edifice for $89?!  Don't hesitate!  The band sucks though. Go ahead and get a 22mm silicone band to go with it. Problem solved.
4.0,"LOVE this hat!! ♡♡ It is extremely warm & cozy! Love the pattern & quality!  Most of all, i I love that it's not tight around the face! The &#34;fit rating&#34; on amazon is correct. (78%)<br />It looks more slouchy in picture than it actually is.  That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. However,  because  it is the coziest hat I ever worn, I'm or ding another in grey! :)<br />12-08-2016<br />♡♡♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡"
4.0,These fit big but they're perfect for around the house I love them
4.0,"The product was a little too large, but I had it taken in and it fits great! it's still a little too loose in some places from the excessive material, but a cute costume anyways."
4.0,"A great watch for the price! I didn't give it 5 stars because  I feel like they tired to hard because my box was falling apart and you could tell it's just because they didn't wanna go over budget. Not impressed by that, but other than that the watch is great I wear it everyday."
4.0,"Fit as expected, but my daughter still kicks them off constantly. Cute & great for the price!"
4.0,Love it but just a little to heavy
4.0,"This dress is cool and comfy.  I like how the pull string can be adjusted to draw in the waist.  I’m larger in the hip area and being able to emphasize the waist area gives a nice silhouette.  I had to experiment with how tight to pull the string to get the right look, but I ended up liking it a lot when I got it right.  Also, I’m short, but this comes a big  under my knee which I thought was perfect.  (Excuse the broken foot  in the pic! 😂)"
4.0,I am plus size. I am actually right at the border most 0x plus size or XXL regular size women's clothing fits me. I range 18-22 street clothing size. I am a very difficult fit in swimsuits. I do not wear 2 piece or bikini suits out in public for decency sake but I wanted one for sunning in my back yard. This suit is a super cute vintage fit and I appreciate the extra high waist coverage. I have had two children and have stretch marks this suit hides the majority of those. The top is cut and has thick padded formed cups (no underwire) but is just enough support. I could definitely swim in the bottoms they are a bit snug but I found it actually was not uncomfortable snug and offered a little slimming affect almost like spanx or slenderizing undergarments I love that!! I'm thicker through my lower waist right around my belly button. With the top I could definitely swim or laze in a raft but if there was rough waves or I was jumping in I think one of my girls would come loose to be honest I need just a tad more support though I could try tying the straps tighter I did kit yet. My bra size range is 44c -44D<br />I received this bikini at a discounted rate in exchange for my review yet I keep it real unbiased and informative. Proof is in my photo too :-) I hope this review is helpful HAPPY AMAZON SHOPPING!
4.0,"the color was perfect, the quality of the fabric and made was better than expected especially at this price point. the wait of deliver was about 2 weeks so keep that in mind, If I had more time for the event I probably would it have time to reorder on correct size, also runs long, I am 5ft 2"" about 157 Lbs  38DD Just be aware that fabric is tight so I would suggest to get at least a size bigger than your normal size of dress. if you are short like me expect to have it cut more than likely."
4.0,"Se ve d muy buena calidad, y actualmente uso una dorada que yacían compre. Esta con plateado se ve muy linda, lo único malo es que me llego sin el vicel."
4.0,"- Nice Bag!!! 👌🏽 Very Nice , Will Be Purchasing Another Really Soon!!!"
4.0,"These socks are so cute.  I really like how they look when you scrunch them up around the ankles.  They have a very old fashioned appeal to them and are quite feminine looking.  They look pretty cute pulled up too, but I especially like them scrunched up.  While they are not as soft as I hoped they would be, they are not stiff either.  They are thin enough to breath so your feet won't sweat in them, but thick enough not to wear out easily.  The seams are sewn well and there are no rough edges that rub into your toes or feet. I wish the material was a little softer though.  For some reason they look like they would be super soft, like microfiber soft, but they really aren't.  They feel more like control type pantyhose material, only thicker.  They are still quite comfortable and they are so cute that I don't mind too much, but still....softer is always nice.  As far as looks go, they are adorable and I love the vintage style and colors.<br />I received these Dr. Anison Women Vintage Look Socks at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I do not guarantee a good review. I rely on product reviews myself when shopping and will always give my honest opinion-good or bad. All opinions are based on my experience with the product and yours may differ."
4.0,Love the ring very nice in person
4.0,"I like the look and feel of these socks. However, I have a size 9 foot ---these are too short!  Terrific for small feet!"
4.0,This is a very cute romper however I have to return it because it isn’t really flattering on me due to my chest. I’m a 36 D and ordered a M. It is nicely made and does look as pictured
4.0,Product was advertised as new but once I received then you can tell that they have either been worn before or &#34;tried on&#34; several times. There were creases in the boots on the area where the ankle bends and the &#34;leather&#34; has a tiny prick on it and I can see the material underneath. It's in a very inconspicuous spot so only I will know that it is there though. Considering the amount of money I paid I expected them to be brand spanking new but I love the boots and have been searching for a black pair in my size for quite some time. I already had them in brown so I know what they look like when they are new and these definitely were not. Overall 4 stars because the boots are beautiful and Shipping was fast.
4.0,"Quality is awesome, it’s just a tad too small fir my needs. Love this brand!"
4.0,g/ thoght was cute
4.0,Some of the socks are not of the same length...off by a half inch here or there.  Otherwise good socks.
4.0,"There was no stylus included at all!!! One of the reasons I bought it (besides the fact that it's cute). Also, it didn't specify whether the card slots were protected against a magnetic pull? I heard that if there isn't a protective barrier is can screw up your debit/credit cards so I'm a bit weary of putting important cards like that in there (which was the second reason I got a wallet phone case). Other than that I like it. I'm going to go check the packaging to look for the stylus again but I'm pretty positive that it wasn't included. I bought two. Neither one had it."
4.0,It's cute I was hoping for something a bit thicker though
4.0,"When you wear them, your glasses don't fog up.  They stretch out easily."
4.0,Fits like it should. A little longer than I thought it would be though
4.0,I like these mask for my 6 year old but I wish that there was an option to choose colors. I have a son so two of these mask he doesn't wear because it's bright pink and purple. There should be an option between boy colors and girls instead of both together.
4.0,cute but color not as it shows.
4.0,"Very cute, good item for the price. I bought pearl earrings from PAVOI that were a smiliar price but have held up for over a year and wearing on a daily basis, I unfortunately do not think these will be quite the same quality - but again fair for pricing."
4.0,Beautiful piece though the magnet is a bit weak.
4.0,"Super cute and medium weight, not too heavy."
4.0,"Beautiful pattern!  I loved this bra!  Unfortunately it was slightly larger, even though I ordered 2 others in the same size.  Sadly I’ll have to return it :("
4.0,"These are really good shoes, and I hope that they last quite awhile.  They are comfortable right out of the box, and look really good.  Plus, they are made right here in the USA.  I only gave 4 stars because I do not know about their longevity.  If they last, I will update in the future."
4.0,Tiny but very nice.
4.0,"Nice gloves, well packaged."
4.0,I typically wear a Medium and the dress fit true to size. My only problem was the stripes of the skirt didn't line up very well with the top of the dress. It was very noticeable the lines didn't match up so I sent it back.
4.0,Not bad but there are better ones out there
4.0,"As Described and Comfortable. Color lighter than in picture and material is soft. I wanted the short to be loose, ordered an XL and they fit great."
4.0,Works great. Keeps band from slipping off your hand.
4.0,"Love the fabric and colors, those are exactly like the picture. Fit was a bit larger than expected.  I am 5'1 and 124 lbs, and a 34C cup. It is a bit large both in the waist and bust area. I also wondered if it was actually a medium marked as a small like another reviewer mentioned. It fit better when I added a pushup bra.  Also the apron seems a little long to me, but it is as shown in the picture. Overall I am happy with the dress. It was a really nice quality for the price and fun because it's different than the ones my friends have.  Definitely keeping it to wear to the annual Octoberfest party we attend."
4.0,"I love the color and feel of the material. I did notice that after one wearing the fabric is 'pilling' under the arms from rubbing against itself. If you can fix that, I would buy it in other colors too!"
4.0,"A little big for my wrist unless I use the last hole but of than that, great band."
4.0,Like the top very much keeping one of this color and reordered new color.
4.0,Style is great but it runs small :(
4.0,Fun lights. I always take these when I travel...wear them on my finger at night so I can see the way to the bathroom....they work very well.
4.0,"I purchased this to use as a pajama top while nursing my newborn and also to wear under regular shirts this winter for extra warmth that I can still breastfeed in. I am quite tall and I would prefer to have the top a little bit longer but it still works fine. The bottom hem is a little snug around my mom tummy and hips but my stomach is gradually shrinking so I think this will improve. I am pretty busty and the front of the shirt just barely covers my front but it's fine for what I'm using it for.<br /><br />The fabric is super soft and comfortable and I don't get sweaty/soaked when I'm sleeping.<br /><br />I would recommend this top. If you are not a fan of the racerback style, you may not like how this top is cut at the neck and back/shoulders."
4.0,I love this ring but have no ring that works with it.  It might be ok as a stand alone.  I plan to try it that way.
4.0,I love my ring and would recommend it especially if you work in the medical field or workout a lot!!
4.0,"For its price, sure! It’s okay, but not great"
4.0,Lovely hat. Fits well and has the promise to be warm in winter.  The only thing that stops it from having 5 stars is that it's a bit itchy but that follows as it's wool.  I will be wearing it only on cold days.
4.0,Wicked warm.
4.0,"I bought this as a nursing blouse, and it works very well for that purpose.  I love the PattyBoutik brand  in general; the one problem I have with this blouse is that it is necessary to iron it every time I wear it. There is a natural wrinkle that occurs at the shoulders which I don’t mind but the type of fabric wrinkles even when stored properly on a hanger. I am  5‘4“ tall and 125 pounds and the medium fit me well, i.e. modestly, which I like.  I have the blouse in black and magenta. The low neck will likely show your bra a bit.  Overall the product is as described and it is an appreciated part of my wardrobe these days."
4.0,"Fabric is soft, stretchable and I chose a medium size but will be exchanging for a large. Very comfortable fit. Just a little snug in Boob area."
4.0,"Very Cute! I bought this for my Peni Parker halloween costume. I ordered L as they do not have size XL. Size L fits perfectly I’m 5’2 128lbs. Wash it cold, Do not dryer, it will shrink."
4.0,The first time i bought it it was perfect..second time around they ripped within the first week..still though its a pretty good glove so ima give it another chance
4.0,"I am 5'4"" and 148#.  I am in between a 10 and a 8 depending on the store.  Much larger size at big box stores.  8 fit perfect.  Length was perfect to wear with flats or heals.  For the price, I would recommend."
4.0,Nice outfit. .... only problem is the pants doesn't fit like tight enough.... its just ok!  I bought the large and am 38DD waist 34 and hips 48
4.0,"about 15% of the lights didn't work, but my kids love these things and the price made it okay that a few didn't work as expected"
4.0,"Helps my kid feel more like a boy, but with the snugness he likes in girl's underwear.  He likes them a lot."
4.0,I bought the brown in Medium and it fit wonderfully.  The material has a great stretch to it and it is NOT see through.  It is not lined but the stitching seems well done.  I have only worn it once and have not yet laundered it so we shall see about how it holds up.  The tag suggests that you hand wash (no dryer) or send to dry cleaners.  I will likely hand wash to see how that works.<br /><br />I bought the dress for work and it is perfect.  The belt gives it a yesteryear quality.
4.0,Cute earrings. The fringe string on the earrings needed a bit of straightening from unboxing. Great value for the price!
4.0,They were a bit small on my face tho. but for the most part they're a good deal $
4.0,A bit smaller than expected/ hoping
4.0,"A bit larger than I expected, hope it'll shrink a little. Otherwise well made, beautiful color and comfortable."
4.0,They were a little shorter than I expected.  But that’s my fault for not reading the description close  enough.
4.0,Just got this dress for a wedding in a few weeks. Dress is lovely in person and it doesnt look cheap. I am 5'10 and the length goes down to my ankles. I got the XXL and I am medium frame (about180ish?) with a C cup. I rarely wear dresses but last one I wore was either a 12 or a 14 (cant remember). This dress runs on the smaller size...not by much. This dress is NOT for girls with  large breasts or with a thick body frame. Taking one start because....The fabric does not stretch so you dont have a lot of room to play around. The zipper is not the best quality and you will need help to carefully zip it up. I found some loose threads but I can fix those right quick.
4.0,"These are very nice shirts, well made with good materials.  They seem to run a little large, but overall, a very nice shirt."
4.0,"Girlfriend really likes the wristlet, it has a nice design and functions well. Took one star off for the low quality clasp that attaches it to keys."
4.0,This outfit was so nice and comfortable. Made out of a soft material with a little stretch to it. A bit shorter than I usually wear but it was a great outfit for girls night out. I ordered a medium: I weigh 140 about 5 feet 5 inches.
4.0,"Disclaimer:<br />I have not bought this shirt retail. I am actually a promotional products wholesaler who has over the last 20 years sold thousands of this shirt to my clients. Bought some for myself of course.<br /><br />High quality stitching etc. Again, I personally like the blend of the fabric. I have sold lots of Columbia fishing shirts and I prefer the Tiger Hill fabric for comfort and how it looks straight out of the dryer.<br /><br />Sizing seems about right to me. My personal preference (to be fair that is why I left off one star) would a longer tail than most shirts like this come with. I can't seem to keep shirts tucked in. I confess to not having the flat stomach of my youth.<br /><br />That said, I have had excellent customer satisfaction with the thousands of them my clients have purchased over the years. Some of them had been using Columbia but are now buying this shirt instead."
4.0,Pretty and comfortable to wear.
4.0,They were too long in the inseam (28&#34; I think) and did not offer the petite or short version.  Returned them.  Otherwise great quality.
4.0,Bright color make them easy to identify luggage.
4.0,Lovely necklace.....beautiful presentation with a flowery bag and little pink velvet drawstring.<br />Ordered two more for Christmas.
4.0,Super long - did I buy the wrong size?  I'm not looking forward to cutting off fabric and hemming.  The fabric is absolutely amazing and comfortable.  I want to wear them everywhere - even to bed!!!
4.0,They are cute and comfortable.  The pants are a little see through in the booty area.
4.0,"We got the white shoes in size 13 and they are true to size. They are actually not a plain, solid white, but are shimmery, like very fine glitter. It's subtle unless you're looking at them up-close. The soles/heels are thin and rubbery- not hard and slippery. Each loop of the bow is stitched onto the elastic and upon trying them on for the first time, stitches on one side broke and one of the bows came halfway off- I think this happened from stretching the elastic as she was putting them on. It's really not a big deal to put a couple of stitches back in, but I did feel like I should mention it needing a repair immediately."
4.0,Muy bonito diseño
4.0,"Loved the blue, it just sparkled"
4.0,It came earlier than expected. The picture does not do it justice. Fabric is nice. I look forward to more items from this store. “Bravo Zulu”!👍🏿 Only gripe is. Logo sits to low. You have to fold it over to see the submarine dolphins.
4.0,A little see through but material is very comfortable.  Will order another in black if option is available.
4.0,Comfortable and cute! I gave it 4 stars overall because it snaps closed and after awhile it will start to pop open! It's a good value for the money and I would purchase it again!
4.0,"My husband likes this under his bike helmet or just working out in the yard.  Kind of big, but maybe because he is nearly bald, so it's not that tight."
4.0,Order a size up for a better fit
4.0,"I read the reviews after i ordered them and i got worried, when they arrived i could get them on my ray-ban wayfarers. it does fit!! it is very snug and you have to slide them in just the right way, but they do fit!"
4.0,"The color goes with almost everything from jeans to dress pants. I love the way it fits and it is comfortable. I still don't like the fact that it has to be ""hand washed"" but it's definitely worth it!"
4.0,"Be careful reading the measurements. Although is say it fits hips to 50 something inches, you would look like a sausage. I'm a size 12/14 and it really hugs my body. If you like that look, than this will be fine for you. The side seems do not match the pattern which is annoying to me, It's like walllpaper seams that dont match. Ugh It's very stretch but  think for someone who is 6. 8. 10 or on the small side of 12 would do best. I woud wear this to the office with a long white or black short sleeve tunic. I bought this piece at a reduced price in exchange for my review, good or bad. It's a good piece but the sizing for the L/XL is way off with the ,measuremetns/ zVrey lightweith and easy to pack."
4.0,"I’ve had really good luck with this brand of dress on Amazon. And this dress was soooooo close to being great. But the sequins didn’t go all the way to the edge around the sleeve and neckline. So there was black material which was so obvious against the silver sparkles, so I had to return it. But in another color where the fabric is closer in color to the sequins, it won’t matter so much. The dress fit great and felt really comfortable to wear. Awesome quality for the price other than that issue around the edges. I’m probably going to re-buy in the rose gold color the next time I have a formal event."
4.0,Fits nicely as expected.
4.0,The mask is good. But there was no cotton material inside.
4.0,"$10 seems expensive  but they do the job well enough. Mine took quite a bit of gentle bending before they fit comfortably but at the right angle that holographic effect is really cool.<br /><br />Here's something I didn't realize -- they're not easily seen through, which I guess I didn't remember from the 90's. Its sort of like looking through really dirty lenses, but I guess that's the sacrifice for being so tight."
4.0,Its a good product. For the price the quality is acceptable
4.0,The earrings came in a ring box. The box was really good. The earrings looks beautiful. I am happy with the purchase. I am glad l decided to get it despite other reviews.
4.0,A little small for a 34 but I could still wear them
4.0,"I might order another one, I really do like this shirt. It fits as expected and it is very thin material, yet very comfy and works well for yoga and pilates."
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress.  It’s a nice dark green color just like I wanted.  The fabric is light and stretchy.  It fits well, but I wasn’t thrilled with the height of the “slit”.  But with a safety pin it’s an easy fix.  The length is great, just as described.  I also found that though the fabric is light, it is not sheer."
4.0,Received this key chain in three weeks. Really like it. Have used it a lot. Especially like the way it clips to purses or belt loop. Good buy.
4.0,Had to return. Just not what I was looking for and doesn't flatter shorter girls.
4.0,"Runs slightly small. I wear between 9 & 9 5. Ordered 9.5, toes touch slightly at front of shoe, shoulf of got a 10. They are super comfortable though and too cute!! So sparkly! Loveee them!"
4.0,So far I like this wallet. The only thing is that is gets marked up very easily so I am constantly having to clean it which I don’t like.
4.0,Pretty. Expected it to be a bit heavier weight. It is really thin.
4.0,Beautiful outfit but does run small.
4.0,Pretty good don't know about scratch resistance because I take care of them
4.0,It does have drawstrings under the brim to make it smaller.
4.0,This dress looks great..but it is a problem at the chest keeps moving apart...had to pair it with a vest...
4.0,comfortable<br />but thin
4.0,I ordered medium and I usually get large size gloves. They are a nice fit and super soft and excellent grip on the steering wheel! Absolutely gorgeous gloves and definitely won't beat the price! Same glove everywhere else is at least double the price!
4.0,"I bought this dress in 2 different prints. This print fit perfectly. The V-neck does not gape so when I lean over, it's ""clingy"" enough in the neckline that I'm not showing anything. I'm tall and have knee replacements and like dresses to cover knee surgical scars. This dress does that. It comes to just barely below the knee so it's the perfect length. It is soft but not silky, and stretchy as described. It looks nice enough to use as a go-out-to-dinner dress but casual enough to use for a picnic. My only complaint about it is that it is thin and somewhat see-through, and since it has white in the skirt, I will have to wear a slip and I don't like to do that because I get hot. The other print I got was the green with pink flowers, very pretty, but like a whole size smaller than this one, and I ordered the same size in both. The green one was silky material, not soft, but that doesn't account for the size difference."
4.0,I have a big wrist and I still has to take out to links. Feels good on the wrist.
4.0,Well made and perfect size.
4.0,"These seem to be nice quality silicone straps for your Pebble Steel watch. The question you need to ask is whether you like silicone watch bands. I had never owned silicone bands before, but I ordered these for my Pebble Steel to replace the original leather band which was wearing out. What I have discovered is, I do not like silicone bands. They make my wrist get hot and sweaty, they don't breathe, and they are bulkier than a leather strap.<br />That being said, if you like silicone bands these seem to be soft and of good quality, especially for the price. I am giving them four stars, because my dislike is just a personal preference and not related to the product itself. If you have never worn silicone bands before, be aware that they may not suit your taste."
4.0,I wish they were Attached order. They look like high waters instead of capris or cut offs.
4.0,The crown was somewhat squished upon delivery but I used my home clothing steamer to ease out the wrinkles a bit. I thought it would have been shipped in a box instead of a padded envelope. Overall happy with the look. It would have been good to balance the weight of the glasses with something on the back of the hat since the glasses made it tip to the front of your head.
4.0,"I wore these in a river with a rock/grass bed. They have a thinner bottom then I was expecting so it really only protected from feeling the slippery rocks and grass and slipping on the rocks and grass. I could feel all the rocks though so by the time I was out of the river the bottoms of my feet were killing me. These would work well for the ocean, a lake, or a pool. Had I realized and known I would have bought something that had more substance in the foot of the water sock."
4.0,A bit large but since it's underwear it will be okay and it was just what I needed.  If I reorder I will get a size smaller.
4.0,Very comfy but a lil thin/ see through
4.0,"I really like these boots. They are the perfect sized heel for me. not too high, but just enough to be comfortable enough to wear all day. I really wanted to give a full five star rating, however, sadly the bottom of the heel fell off of my shoe after only a few hours of wear. I love the material and style of these booties. They literally go with every outfit in my closet. I bought shoe glue and replaced the heel. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Warm and cozy tights for those that live in cold places. They run a bit small/short.
4.0,They fit as I hoped but the fabric is pretty stiff.  Hoping that changes as they get washed.
4.0,"Looks good,  fits good"
4.0,"This head band works great. The only thing is I have fine hair so it doesn’t stay in place perfectly, but it does stay better than most headbands."
4.0,after a many washes it feels more comfortable
4.0,"I got it to use as a keychain but after I saw it, decided against that. The loop isn't big enough for my wrist and if I kept it in my pocket when I'm out somewhere I was afraid the charm or the swan would fall off. Soooo, I hung it from my rearview mirror in the car."
4.0,"This is sheer and somewhat see through, yet not too reveling. This is very cute. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it is open down the sides and you cant see that from the picture. There is a stitching just under the arm holes then the rest of the way down it is open, which Im not extremely crazy about. But I still love it and get compliments when I wear it."
4.0,Nothing to so. Love the color
4.0,"Never had an LED watch, I like it. The only thing I didn't like was the watch band was made for a 500 lb. Suma wrestler. I had to take it to a jeweler to downsize it three links."
4.0,"I am surprised that these Yoga Jogger Pants actually fit me and are comfortable too!  I""m 5'9"", 150 pounds and received the Medium size for review.  They were still short - ending at about 2+ inches above my ankles.  I'm not bothered about that because I will be wearing these pants to tennis practice in cool weather and they will make great biking pants.  The material is very durable, I love the side pockets and the waist can be cinched in to make it tighter.  Maybe they run a little large since I can easily fit into them (and I have birthing hips) so if you're in-between sizes you might want to go smaller."
4.0,It took awhile for me to figure out how it worked but I like it.
4.0,strange feel to the material. IT LOOKS GREAT THOUGH!
4.0,Great shipping and true to display though don't forget these are men's sizes so if you're a female around 5'3 and approx. 140 lbs the arms might be a little long for you ! Other than that it's great I really like it and I'll be shopping again .
4.0,"Good quality lens, but they need a x-lg option. I am 5' 10"" with average size glasses.<br />These will not cover them and stay in place.<br />I ordered another brand in x-lg and they fit perfectly.<br />I sent them back."
4.0,I purchased these for my daughter.  I ordered the 4mm and did not realize that 4mm was that small.  That is ok as she likes the size and we will be getting a larger size soon.  They fit nicely and are made well.
4.0,"I was looking for a large bag that did not have a center pocket and this fits the bill. This bag is large enough to hold my purse, umbrella, lunch and snacks for the day, a notebook and more. I like that it is rigid enough to stand on its own. The zippered outside pocket is not tall enough to zip if my cell phone is upright, but it will fit if I turn it on its side. One strange thing, the zippers are very loud. I get the sense that the noise disturbs my coworkers, so I try to keep my zipping to a minimum. I got the fushia pink color and received several compliments."
4.0,"I was skeptical about ordering this since it’s a known fact that sizes from china run a lot differently than they do here. I am six foot tall and all I wanted was for this to drape over my shoulders and hit my waist line, well it was perfect. I order the cover-up in watermelon (it looks more on the coral side to me) it is really beautiful; you can even just wear it out as a top over a tank top with a pair of jeans. It is a very versatile cover up. It is made out of polyester so it will run a little warmer when you wear it in the sun, so I would suggest just using it as a cover up to wear on and off the beach or it you’re going to be outside, but not in the sunlight all the time. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review of the product"
4.0,I ordered these boots for my sister and she loved them! Arrived as pictured above. Only bad thing about them is they wear and tare rather quickly but my sister did wear them a lot. Arrived a few days early which was a bonus!
4.0,"This little wristlet purse is absolutely adorable! So dainty and feminine. The colors are true to the photos and the genuine leather is soft to the touch. I bought the pink, purple, and turquoise and now I plan to get the red and black. They arrived individually packaged in plastic zip lock bags that say ""Thank you for your order. Have a beautiful day!"" What a nice touch!<br /><br />As for the size of this clutch, it's a tad small, but I have a Galaxy Note 4 in a slightly bulky case and it fits inside with just a little squeeze. It leaves just enough room for lip gloss, ID, credit cards, cash and other small items. A small set of keys may also fit. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, is that the chain strap makes the clutch heavier than it has to be.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend purchasing this little gem. It's perfect for a night out on the town, or dressing up any outfit. The exterior quality of the leather is great. The gold colored hardware and the interior lining aren't of the best quality, but for the price and adorable look, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Jan 2015 UPDATE:<br />The leather strip entwined in the chain broke after the first use. I re-entwined it and glued the ends back together. If it happens again, I'll probably just remove it. The bag/chain looks fine without that strip of leather."
4.0,"The treasure box it comes in in lovely, and I love the necklace itself. Great heavy quality to the emblem. But the metal connector from the necklace to the dragon was unreliable. The dragon kept falling off. I tried pressing the connector tighter which worked for a bit then imonce agin the emblem fell off but this time the connector went flying and I can’t find it. Huge bummer, because now I have to find a connector and can’t wear it."
4.0,"I ordered XXL, I wear an 8, this JUST fits, as long as I don't gain a single pound! Not as flouncy as hoped, weird double back material, but overall, I still really like it."
4.0,"I like this a lot it is heavy and makes you sweat! This being said I do live in south Louisiana and it's unbelievably hot! I wear this while I'm working out, cleaning my house or working on my laptop, I like that it forces you to sit upright. I've become a little lazy and catch myself slouching and I don't like that! If you are someone that struggles with upper body strength or find it hard to put clothes on this MAY be hard for you or someone you love to put on as you have to really pull it into place. Make sure you get the right size and see the size chart before buying. **NOTE always remember to keep an open mind buying something online that you are not able to try on first, If it's too big, too small or you don't like it, don't stress or worry about it as you can always send it back, in saying this always check each orders return policy**<br /><br />I'm not paid for this and it's all my personal experience and opinion."
4.0,"After reading all the other reviews I figured this would be the dress of all dresses! Everyone of every shape and size looked amazing in it! So I ordered it. And I look pretty okay.<br /><br />I am 5'10&#34;, 180, 38DD with a 32 inch waist and 41 inch waist. I am a thick(ish) girl. I wear a size M or L in dresses, same in shirts typically 8 or 10 in dresses and a 10 in pants. I thought I would slay this dress like the rest of y'all.<br /><br />I put it on and it was just okay. I definitely have to wear spanx with it because it shows my imperfections, around the belly and thighs unfortunately. I am excited it holds my boobies up pretty well and I can't wait to go braless. Granted I would only wear this out to a club somewhere as it is VERY BOOBYLICIOUS but whatever. I'll get to wear it one day. I will probably pull it up a little because it goes down around my knees and makes me look thicker than I am. If I pull it up above my knees, I think it somehow looks better.<br /><br />Anyway! Here's a photo of me in the dress with spanxs and it pulled up to ruche a little.<br /><br />I paid full price for this dress."
4.0,Getting the slip of paper out to write your name on is a nightmare. Very cute though.
4.0,We got this for our kid’s grandma because they call her Mimi:) Super cute! Just like the picture.
4.0,Great fit. nice coat.
4.0,"The material of the shirt is great; however, the description is not accurate. It is definitely a wide scoop neck rather than a hang off the shoulder shirt. I wear small/medium shirts, so I went with a medium. I would need an XL to get the same look as in the picture."
4.0,It's a nice wallet. It's what I expected.
4.0,M..fits like a l
4.0,The suit is super cute but was a bit too snug in the chest area for me.
4.0,the chain appears to be silver It's bright gold..love it anyways..It's nice
4.0,"This dress is adorable. I get compliments on it whenever I wear it. Such a great bargain for the price. I have two minor complaints. The bust is quite large on this dress. I'm on the smaller side and I in no way fill this area of the dress. I even had to stitch some of the fabric down. Also, when tied, the knot in the back has a tenancy to slip down because of the slick fabric the dress is made out of. Besides those two points, I really love this dress. It's a great length; I'm 5'10 and it comes right above my knee. For the price, just buy it!"
4.0,"Asian XXL is definitely smaller than American XXL.  The product is thin, but appears to be well made."
4.0,Not the best material but it served it purpose for my Europe trip 👌🏽
4.0,"Didn't like the way the dress fit, but I liked the dress."
4.0,"I like these work out pants.  Not too tight, comfortable fabric, cute over skirt.  Just a couple of things. The waist is higher than workout clothes today. Doesn't make it bad it's just a bit higher, closer to the natural waist.  The thing I am not thrilled about is how white it is.  It's not an off white like most clothing pieces today it's a blue white. Which wouldn't be a big deal except I wanted to create an all white outfit (for Kundalini yoga) and I cannot find a top to match.  It's that white.  As soon as I find a top to wear them with I'll wear them more but for now I am a bit stumped."
4.0,The hat stayed on all night. (Not like some of the other brands that were just ridiculous). It was affordable and got lots of compliments. The only issue was the shirt was too large. I tied it in the back and rolled up the sleeves and all was good!
4.0,"Had some issues with shipping, however the seller was promt in fixing the issue and tried very hard to ensure that I was pleased. The necklaces are beautiful. I ordered these as thank you's for my bridesmaids. I was very happy in the end. It is a great product and a fun change from every day items."
4.0,I am returning these and getting the next size down as they do run large. I am unfortunately a 2X right now and I will need a 1x so keep this in mind if you order these. They are soft and comfortable feeling though.
4.0,Larger than I thought and wont work for my 8 year old niece but they are nice
4.0,Very nice just a little too big for my wrists
4.0,If the sleeves on this top actually fit at your shoulders and not down on your arm  it would be a great top.
4.0,These are nice gloves but I gave them 4 stars because they don't look exactly like the photo. They are more muted instead of the bright clear red that I see on my screen. They just weren't as dressy and elegant as I thought they would be. So back they went!
4.0,"These shorts fit well, are accurately sized and very comfortable.  I like the soft fabric and the fact they keep their shape.  The pockets are ample sized and hold what I need to carry.  I'll buy some more when the color variety in my size increases."
4.0,"Great belt for the price, if you don't mind the funky smell of formaldehyde. I tried to air it out but nothing i did worked, you can smell it while wearing. Yuk"
4.0,"The earring quality is overall sturdy and strong, but I felt the pearl was a little too big and not that authentic looking. It is also a bit too large for me. But it's an overall good-looking earring for bigger faces. The clasp works fine as well."
4.0,"It's very comfortable, but don't expect it to hold anything in...it's no girdle.  I like the generous length and the flounce.  It hasn't had a lot of wear, yet, so I can't comment on that.  The colors in the computer picture are very accurate to the product."
4.0,I love the variety and quality of each one I also enjoy being able to match them what I choose to wear. The best part is the price normally I spend $25 for one pair at some other places so it's a deal for me. The only this is that when I got my package the small boxes hinges were broken but it was not a problem for me
4.0,"I bought these slippers on sale during the prime day event for $5.99 and I ended up receiving the wrong size (I ordered 6.5-7, I was given the next size up). If I had paid full price this would have been more of an issue for me. I have Raynaud’s syndrome and it is a real struggle to keep my feet warm, so I wear very thick socks with my slippers. This works out perfectly with this pair of slippers. I love the drawstring/toggle and I think that’s another reason the sizing works out so well. These slippers are very warm and cozy and the memory foam soles are very cushy. The only downsides are the fact that the drawstring digs into my heel if I don’t wear socks with these slippers and that soles compact relatively quickly, but these are things that aren’t dealbreakers to me.<br /><br />Update: the memory foam soles are completely flat now so they’re no longer as comfortable. I wish they were sturdier because I really like them but I don't know if I’m willing to pay full price knowing that they don’t last very long with regular use. I would still recommend if you are someone who would wear these slippers every once in a blue moon and not on a regular basis."
4.0,"This is adorable, the material is a bit more thing than I anticipated it being but nothing a denim jacket won’t solve :-)"
4.0,I found the elastic at the wrist too tight and I have pretty small wrists.
4.0,"Very cute and nice quality dress, but the top part was way too big.  Had to return it."
4.0,I'm usually an 8 or 7 1/2.  Ordered 7 1/2 and they were a little loose.  7 would have been perfect.
4.0,Ordered an XL but the top barely covered anything for a 36C. Very cute but just didn’t fit.
4.0,"Love it, works well, good price, my only issue is that the end of the belt is like cute weird, im not sure if it was just mine but its fine since it makes no difference."
4.0,"Its a pretty decent hammock for the price point. I like the color contrast but I'm not a fan of the two different materials sewn together to make it wider. I ordered this hammock specifically for the extra width as I'm very tall @6'5"". The sewn seam makes for an awkward lay both feet and head. The suspension is easy to set up but its ridiculously heavy. I'm not a fan of heavy gear and I intended on using this hammock for car camping and also as my main bed for hammocking indoors. My main complaint is the inability to remove the hammock from my wall anchors with this system. You have to completely undo the suspension straps from the hammock effetely losing the hang dimensions. So I'm ditching the suspension system completely and installing Amsteel continuous loops in the hammock and hanging with dyeneema straps and bettle buckles from dutchwear. This will make the hammock much more portable and I can take it down in my bedroom without loosing the hang dimensions. I also added a dyneema ridgeline for consistent hang. - A must for any hammock.<br />Pros: cost effective hammock that wont break the bank. Extra Wide. fool proof suspension system.<br />Cons: The suspension system is HEAVY!<br />Overall: I'd probably buy a different hammock with continuous loops and a different suspension system as I cold have purchased a much nicer one with these added features for about the same cost as having to add them to this one."
4.0,"I am 5'10"" with a fairly long torso. I like that this top is long enough to actually cover my stomach and it fits like a swim dress. The only issue is it does float up some when swimming and the top is somewhat lightweight. I find the bottoms to be comfortable and modest."
4.0,super cute:)
4.0,"Nice dress, looks good, asymmetrical flare in skirt is a nice touch."
4.0,They are very pretty and fantastic for the price. I got compliments and no one can tell they are not peals if they are not which I would not expect for less than $11.<br />The first pair broke with one of them falling out of its wire. Now I have 3 pieces that work for less than $22.<br />Pretty good deal given I had a similar pair for much more money that also broke.<br />I highly recommend them.
4.0,Very stylish and it added the right amount of high fashion to my pant outfit.
4.0,"I bought these for aHhalloween costume - Rey from Star Wars. They work perfectly for that, and I love that they have pockets. I'm 5'4 and 110 pounds, and the size small fits perfectly. The tag itches so I cut it out, but that was my only gripe."
4.0,"my 9 yo daughter wears this shirt as a pijama. she loves it. Nevertheless, it is weird to the touch, the letters and numbers feel as if you were touching some sort of rubber....but for the price you can't expect that much"
4.0,"Beautiful dress! I went by other reviews and went with a medium instead of a small. It is a teeny bit big on me, but overall looks nice. Color is exactly as pictured. The detail and fabric are great quality. Modest dress for work. I love it!"
4.0,Great gag gift but would not buy again
4.0,"Love the color and they're very comfy. I'm 5'7 and a size 4 US and they do tend to slide off me and are loose around parts of my leg so I pull them up higher so the wrinkles aren't as noticeable. I bought two pairs and even though they're loose on me, they were worth the price!"
4.0,Came earlier than expected. Perfect gift.
4.0,It would have been better if the socks were given a U.S. size equivalent then I would have known they would not fit most men here.I will give to someone with size 8 feet the quality of the socks were very good.
4.0,I got these shoes about 5 months ago and they've been my go-to shoes just about everyday. They have held up remarkably well. All of the stich and glue points are holding just as well as new. The tread is not wearing down much yet either. They're comfortable on my foot. The only negative is that they aren't super lightweight. Overall a good shoe for the price.
4.0,"Just bought this swimsuit online and it is a nice product.  I am a 31"" waist so I did go with the small.  It does show a lot so buyer beware.  I bought it in blue.  I do not have huge thighs and a small would have been too small.  They are snug on me but not cutting off my curculation.  Would buy another pair."
4.0,"Not only are these super adorable but they're extremely functional. Sometimes I just don't feel like wearing my reading glasses and only want protection from my computer screen (like while writing this). I really appreciate there being two color options in a pack to match with my outfits.<br />They're a little oddly shaped but somehow still work. I would call these unisex for sure. I also enjoy the fact that these glasses come with a protective cover, a cleaning cloth, AND the most adorable mini screwdriver keychain. The only reason I took a star off was because the shape is a little odd and they did pinch my nose and left red marks after wearing them for a short time."
4.0,very soft and comfortable I'm happy:)
4.0,Works great at cleaning jewelry
4.0,I was hesitant but the dress fit perfect. I am 5'7 and about 200 lbs and it isn't tight nor too loose. It also is the perfect length because I wanted it to be as close to my shoes as possible. Love the color and that it has pockets!
4.0,"It's a little smaller than I thought it would be, but still a great tote! MANY pockets and folds up really nice for storage. The interior is tan, so that's why my rating took off a star. I believe that it will stain easier because of the light interior."
4.0,Super cute! Good quality. Had a bit of a hard time getting the clasps to stay but once I did it stayed.
4.0,Other than the sizing being a bit small I love the dress!! I bought it a size bigger than needed and it fits the size she is now. At least it is easy enough to add some elastic if needed.
4.0,I love these pants ! They are super comfy and keeps you cool at all times . They only complaint I have is that the material starts to create tiny fuzzy balls after a while .
4.0,"Absolutely gorgeous dress & quality! Was too small, had to pay to get it altered by another place. I suggest to go up a size when ordering but overall it is absolutely beautiful!!!!"
4.0,Fully insulated liner and use as a backpack.
4.0,I have had some problems with a screw staying attached but other than that it has been great! Perfect for smaller wrists.
4.0,"It was very pretty, but the fit was not what I expected. It's designed to be a little snug around the waist, and looser around the neck/shoulders, etc. I had to return it, just based on my personal preference. It's a really lovely top, and the fabric drapes nicely."
4.0,Excelent product high quality product.
4.0,Bought this for a friend who LOVES tigger! She loved it! She just wished it had a more tigger like tail!
4.0,the only thing I disliked was the material it was not how I thought it would feel but it did look just like the picture
4.0,Keeps my son warm at his monthly drill; fits well.
4.0,Retains shape. Be careful when you wash it. Have to wash it very mildly. Best to dry clean. Looks nice.
4.0,"Love this shirt, super-comfortable"
4.0,Very nice scarf ! Very pleased .
4.0,good quality just a little too heavy for my liking
4.0,It's good I would recommend it for a cheap one
4.0,"Sizing is accurate, and design colors are bright/vivid. Fabric is a little thin, but not enough to not be able to wear it."
4.0,It's nice more of  men style not attractive on my head a little big
4.0,Very tight in breast area
4.0,"I really love the look from a distance. The &#34;stone&#34; shows some pixellation up close that distracts from the beauty a bit, but overall it is a good value for the price."
4.0,I love this dress!! Fits perfectly. I would have given it 5 stars except for the small hole I found while wearing it for the first time. I’m not sure if it’s a factory defect like it got stuck in the machine or if it got caught on something during packing and shipping. It’s a very small hole (pics attached) and not noticeable so I didn’t bother with trying to return it.
4.0,"Runs large but I love it just the same. Comfy, get compliments on it. I do wish the material was more like cotton."
4.0,"I'm always worried to buy clothes on Amazon since I've been burned a few times with cheap quality and way wonky sizes, but since this is also in department stores, I went for it.  The fit is very nice, a true petite.  I like the asymmetric hem (although it's a style I'm still getting used to) and the sparkle is very nice.  It will be good for the holidays."
4.0,Cute wallet and it came way before I expected. I'm giving it 4 stars because it is kind of small and when you put all your cards in you have to stretch to close.
4.0,Wore these initially for three days-- very comfortable even in bed side sleeping.  Went through the shower with no problems.  Just great!
4.0,I was in the process of scanning some old negatives and these gloves are exactly what I needed to keep finger prints off the film. The gloves are a good fit and I have found they can be washed and used at least once or twice more.
4.0,They are nice looking. They go up high enough on my backside which is a plus. I'm 5&#34;5 and they are just a touch shorter than I prefer. They are nice overall so I kept them. I weigh 140 and I purchased a medium and they fit well.
4.0,"These sunglasses are great for my daughter, when she's older. I thought she could use them now (she's 4 months old), but they are way too big! I wish the specifications gave an age range, but these will be great later!"
4.0,Shipping issue.<br />I did finally get mymy Order.  Next time I should order 1 daze up for ease to slip into. But it is comfortable and feminine.
4.0,"This is a lovely color, and is warm without being heavy.  It does not have the feel of 'heavy' cotton blend sweatshirt fleece material (is acrylic) but is warm and cozy.<br /><br />I took a point off because of the zipper.<br />While functional, the zipper is a metal zipper with large silver teeth (more like you'd find in an outdoor coat or jacket, not a cozy sweater type jacket).  I think that the look of the zipper cheapens the look of the item.<br />Moreover, I had to cut the inside tabs off of the end of the zipper up at the neck:  the ends were covered in a rigid, sharp pointed, scratchy plastic that detracted from the comfort of the item.<br />Might buy again- it's a nice item, but the zipper is a deterrent."
4.0,Very pretty but wash by hand to avoid tangling the ends.
4.0,"Great value for the price, but can be fragile."
4.0,The right length for the size but very wide. My girls are fit but sturdy girls. All three sizes we got needed to be taken in 3” to make them fit. Looked awesome for family photos.
4.0,so far so good seems to work as expeted
4.0,Very comfortable and flowey dress!
4.0,Overall a good dress for the price. But the quality in stitching shows. Be careful getting in and out so you don’t tear any stitches. They do ripped easier than most.
4.0,"I bought 2 pairs of leather gloves, each from a different seller, to compare. Both are lined sheepskin leather with touchscreen capabilities. Both are size XXL. I have wide fingers, but they aren't long.<br />Comparison to Harssidanzar Women's Leather Winter Gloves:<br />These are thicker and bulkier than the Harssidanzar pair.<br />The fingers are at least an inch too long, making them awkward for using my touchscreen. The other pair fit much better in the fingers. If you have long nails you will definitely have room for them in these.<br />The Thinsulate lining in these is significantly warmer than the cashmere lining in the Harssidanzar gloves.<br />The leather is not as supple or butter soft, although they probably would hold up better in wet weather and they seem sturdier. The other ones are tighter and actually molded to a perfect fit after wearing a couple of times.<br />These are $12 cheaper than the other pair so that might be a consideration.<br />I may return these and try them in XL instead, as they are loose all around. I like the warm Thinsulate lining and the button detailing, and also the way they are cut and stitched on the palm makes it easy to grip your phone or steering wheel."
4.0,This runs a bit large. I’m a 34C size 27/4 and currently I’m pregnant so I’m a bit bigger and the small fit me great with room for my belly to grow. It’s meant to be a loose fit but i would recommend going with the smaller size if you’re between. I love the length (I’m 5’5 for reference) it can be worn as a dress or as a tunic which is perfect over maternity jeans or leggings. I wish I had opted for a solid color as I’m not in love with this particular leopard print. I like that there are pockets.
4.0,"The Terrry Cloth is not very soft. I washed it twice with fabric softener and it helped, but I owned much softer robes."
4.0,"This strap is very long, I am on the second to smallest hole. It is about an inch longer than the one that came with my Timex Weekender, and the end of the strap is doubled over to hide the excess."
4.0,It run big so get a size smaller I am 5'1 156 pounds I got a small and it's comfortable
4.0,This is a nice dress but was way too snug.
4.0,"If you're like me and like to base your entire wardrobe on your anime an other nerdy interest this top is for you. It is a form fitting top so if you're self-conscious about that it may not be for you. However, pair it with some high-waisted shorts, jeans, or for me a cute little suspender skirt... the GURL ITS A LEWK!!"
4.0,This is a beautiful bag. However I'm only giving it 4 stars has it had a nasty odor when it arrived. I've let it air for 10 days and it has greatly improved. But still has an odor. I don't know if it's from the leather dye or what..........
4.0,Super comfortable and good quality.  Only problem is when I sleep on my side--it sends the sleep mask a little wonky.
4.0,"Comfortable, breathable, a smidgen see through, great for a hot day at home, so happy I bought it I ordered two more!"
4.0,This is a nice casual jacket. It can be dressed up and down. It is loose style And I like the style but it’s a thin jacket so I feel like I should wear another layer to get warm during winter.  It is a nice addition to my wardrobe. I will keep it.<br /> I recommend it.
4.0,"These slippers seem huge, but the actual space for the feet is more reasonable than it appears.  They're very warm and will keep those little toesies warm for sure.  The only issue we've had is Mario's nose came off.  Not a deal breaker by any stretch, but it is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars."
4.0,I did like that I can adjust how tightly the shoe fits
4.0,"Nice bag, just wish it was taller."
4.0,I bought this to wear with leggings and high boots - better quality than I expected and the lining is super soft. This is really warm and stylish! Good buy!
4.0,"I wear a M, but purchased a L in this shirt.  It looks like the picture, which is what I wanted.  It's short enough to hit about 6 inches below my waist. This works for me, as longer shirts get &quot;stuck&quot; on my butt. : ) haha.<br />The fabric is soft and hangs very nicely."
4.0,"These are pretty nice socks.  They are not so thick causing your shoes to be too snug.  They don’t seem to slip and stay up on your leg. Wash up well, too. I used them for a tie dye project and they take the dye colors well even though they are not 100% cotton.  Would buy them again."
4.0,"I love this product, but I'd suggest you purchase a size smaller than you think you need.  If you normally where an XL, you may want to purchase a L.  Other than that, I think it fits pretty good."
4.0,"These  sandals  are  so cute and stylish.  They seem to  be comfortable  but I  have  not worn them  outside  yet which  will be  the  true test.  They do  run a half size  too small so if you  are  in between  sizes, order the  next  one  up."
4.0,"Fits as expected. I wish the straps on the back tightened a little more, the girls need a little extra support when bending over."
4.0,Very fun travel toy. Our kids like these when we stay in hotels. Some of them are defective or break easily.  But it is pretty cool for kids to put one on each finger and shoot the colored lights around.
4.0,"Very cute, my daughter likes it but it's a little on the bigger side. She wears a 5/small, got a 5/6, just slightly too big. Great material, and the straps tighten."
4.0,"Seriously, I couldn't care less about the actual smencils, all I want is the case for the Apple Pencil."
4.0,"The belt is attractive. I ordered according to given sizes & it fits well, yet comfortably. My only complaint is that the clasp appears to be silver-colored in the ad, but nowhere states the color. I needed it in a hurry, so ordered quickly. Was disappointed when it arrived & had a gold-colored clasp as the jewelry I have to wear with it is all silver-colored & not enough time to order a silver one before the occasionI’m planning to wear it to. I will order a different one that states it is silver to wear next time. Plus, it will be nice to have both on hand. I recommend if you want a black belt with gold-colored clasp.<br />Edit: after wearing the L-XXL on my 49” waist, fit well & comfortable thru evening. I noticed, in better light, that the clasp is silver-colored meta! I highly recommend this SILVER-clasped black stretch belt. Ver flattering on my  49” waist, just a tad smaller than bust. It pulled things in & was very flattering!"
4.0,"Great fit really warm to wear, gave some as Christmas gifts all were pleased."
4.0,"I ordered this to use as a neck scarf.  I like that it's stretchy and was cheaper than the ""adult"" ones.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the blue on my scarf is a lot lighter and the stripes are farther apart than in the picture.  Otherwise, it serves its purpose."
4.0,"The color is not as advertised.  It looks like it could be considered a &#34;cheap knock-off&#34; of what is Blue Denim.  Sort of brownish-blue.  The fit is nice, however."
4.0,super cute but was a little big on my wrist.
4.0,cute gift for HP lover.
4.0,Poor boob support but i love how it ties around the neck and back so you can tighten it for a little more support. Still a little small on the 36dd(d) boobies but i wore it this last weekend and liked it.
4.0,"Too small, sent back for next larger size.  Sure doesn’t feel like 95% cotton, feels like more than 5% spandex.<br />Hope it doesn’t shrink."
4.0,Love the watch!  Necklace isn't greatest quality.
4.0,My daughter used these boots for work and when she tightened the laces one of the loops broke off! They sent a replacement with no questions asked. Other than that she said they were comfortable and loved not coming home with wet feet!
4.0,"Fits me well.  I've had a mastectomy so I took the bra inserts out on both sides and I really like the suit.  A big of a struggle to get into, but it's fine for me."
4.0,"This swimsuit is cute, but still a little small for american size"
4.0,"The right boot for the right price.  A tad large, but nothing that can't be adjusted with a thick pair of winter wool socks.  Also a tad heavy which I interpret as sturdy.  Need to battle test next winter to determine overall quality and durability."
4.0,Cheap but not cheaply made. I like the variety I received. The size of the squares are nice and texture is good. The polka dot patterns and color schemes are cool and will help you add a splash of color to your suit jacket.
4.0,"The mask is pretty, seems to be protective and I will wear it."
4.0,it's small yet elegant the perfect piece of jewelry for gifting.
4.0,"I have a large bust (36 DDD) and have a really hard time finding swimwear tops that fit... I mean fit and cover everything that needs to be covered. I was pleasantly surprised that this top fit my top so we'll. I'm comfortable in it and it doesn't pain my neck where it ties, also hard to find. The print is a little dull compared to the photo and the inserted &#34;cups&#34; are not supportive by any means. But overall, it will work just fine."
4.0,"It's a nice bracelet. However, the small size is tiny. I have small wrists and it looked really small on me. Up to the point it was difficult to even clasp together. I'd say it's more of a child size."
4.0,This picture is misleading. The earring jackets are lovely but very small....much to small to work with my diamond studs.  I returned the jackets.
4.0,First one broke they sent replacement
4.0,"Smaller than expected, still great item."
4.0,Always need a solid red tie in the closet arsenal. Has more noticeable paisley design than I thought when ordered. The square works when you want to add a little more pizazz to your wardrobe.
4.0,"Light weight, exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,"This is really a laptop slipcase which you would insert into a larger bag while travelling, or you would use it for short trips in your car for example.  I have looked at many laptop sleeves in stores. The brain bucket's padding is among the best. Perhaps only the Sumdex memory foam slipcase could offer more protection.<br /><br />The brain bucket mini has quality construction and light, weighing in under one pound! It fits my work Dell Latitude D600 14.1"" screen perfectly and offers very good protection. The side pocket accomodates the Dell power supply and a slim binder. Although the literature says it will fit most 14"" and 15"" laptops, it was about 1/2"" too small for my wife's 15.4"" widescreen Vaio laptop. If you have a 15.4"" widescreen slipcase, then look at the regular size brain bucket.<br /><br />I would have given this bag a rating of 5 stars, but I deducted one star because it does not have a detachable shoulder strap. I would also have liked a zippered side pocket to prevent objects from slipping out - but thats asking too much."
4.0,Levemente más pequeño de lo esperado. Pediría un talle más grande de lo que uno es realmente
4.0,"The vest is a hard to put on, and a little hard to take off."
4.0,Cute and sturdy. Have had a bit of the silver coming off but its not too big and its still cute. Thats why the one less star. Over good product
4.0,I take my travel accessories very seriously 🙂 and I must admit this is a great toiletry bag. After looking in several stores this by far is the best one I came across! The only reason why I did not rate 5 stars is because I wish there were more color options.
4.0,The look is very different especially with the sleeves. I wasn't sure about the sleeves at first but they grew on me after some time. Very feminine. If you are cooking or needing to roll up your sleeves then this blouse is not for you. It's very pretty and more of a going out to dinner blouse.
4.0,A little shear still fits great and I love the open back. You can’t really see through it unless you put it up to the light. The texture is a little weird but I will be wearing it to the gym!
4.0,"My husband loved them, two ot three of them. Not too crazy about the colors on the others."
4.0,Very sexy. Exactly what I wanted
4.0,Incredible finish and awesome color. I love the black interior and material. Would be 5 stars but there is no resistance upon opening or closing so it can slam shut now and then. Still don't mind it!
4.0,Perfect for my outfit all black and this is on point!
4.0,"My daughter loved this hoodie. It looks to be well made, but was a bit smaller than size would indicate...If you order this hoodie you should definitely order it AT LEAST one size larger than you would normally buy."
4.0,"Kind of pricey.  Only print on one side.  Using for hiking, hunting, fishing so I don't get shot by hunters otherwise I wouldn't have bothered.  If it saves my life I'll come back and up to 5 stars LOL!  Would have given 5 stars if was as nice as the bandanas I bought at walmart."
4.0,It's an ok luggage tag
4.0,"Pretty cool idea. Not sure how long it’ll last? I only gave it 3 stars for durability. Will rerate should it change. Previously used a Sardo rack (that gets removed prior to breaking). Tried it, had a ball roll slowly up to it, hit the edge and slightly altered the balls position. Not really a big deal but depending on who you play with??? Must say provides a tight rack! We’ll see how it goes...."
4.0,Awesome! But a tiny bit small for an adult face
4.0,It is a great cover. It did come with a weird smell to it. I'm hoping it will come out with a wash.
4.0,"Love the shoes, they are made very well."
4.0,"Love the design, but the square bend is too large for either one of us... going to see if I can use some needle-nosed pliers on 'em :)"
4.0,Nice but slow to arrive as the company predicted
4.0,Had a small hole on the seam inside the leg but super soft
4.0,"I would've given five stars, but the brim seems a little crooked.  It looks to have been attached to the rest of the hat correctly, but the right side of the brim comes down lower than the left.  So far, I haven't been able to correct this.  I also have to bring it down lower on my head than normal for it to feel almost right for me.  However, pulling it down lower makes the bottom of the hat touch my ears and this is bothersome to me.  I do like the hat though and won't be returning it."
4.0,Item works great.  Will eventually wear out though...after about a year or so.  Thankfully they are replaceable.
4.0,Looks just like the picture…we'll see how long it holds up!
4.0,The manufacturer emailed me to verify the size I was to see if it would fit me. It's a little larger than what I usually wear but that's good for a loose summer shirt for that layered look over tshirts or tank tops.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:e32f361acd64be312c3d6f5b6085c3eb]] So the leggings are a tad short I’m 5”3 and they’re just slightly above my ankles. Not a big deal. But I’m 135 pounds and I got a small peach with kind of bigger thighs and they fit nice on the top half but they were baggy by my knees. I do love the look so I’ll have to order a small bc the medium was just too baggy. Hopefully the small isn’t a shorter length.
4.0,"Very cute. I like them a lot. Posts are really long, which I found odd, but doesn't affect the way they wear."
4.0,These are fun and different summer shoes. They haven't held up as best as I would like but still worth it. They've started to peel on the footing.
4.0,nice and it served the purpose
4.0,"I love this hoodie and it fits perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves. They are a tad shorter than I like, but size medium is a true size. I am 5’3” 148lbs.  I can overlook the sleeves because it is really a comfortable hoodie."
4.0,"I bought these for my special needs boys.  It is rec. by seller to measure their wrists.  I did not.  They were too big, but I knew I needed to replace the band with something more custom because they are such small children.  The engraving is not as deep as I hoped.  It's hard too read which is a bit disappointing, and it took a long time to arrive.  If you are not in a hurry and the wrists are larger, this is a good trial bracelet.  I've since replaced the band to get my boys used to wearing them, but do plan on ordering a replacement with a better quality of tag in the future.  Overall though, I was pleased enough with the product!"
4.0,"This is a gorgeous keychain. It sparkles so bright. It's beautiful! I ordered a second one for back up when the initial one becomes old.<br /><br />It did come with a noticeable gap of missing crystals. They're currently out, but will send them to me along with glue. I hope the second one comes with all crystals intact."
4.0,"Not grey, more light lavender. It is soft and comfy. I’m disappointed it’s more purple not grey."
4.0,"We needed a bag big enough for us to hall our sons medical material when we travel, we had multiple bags and now we are down to one. love it"
4.0,Keeps my feet warm in winter. Velcro makes them adjustable.
4.0,I purchased a set of these silver gloves for my college age daughter who had a senior recital to do and needed them for a costume change.  They worked well.  No complaints.
4.0,Perfect for my costume but it broke the first time I tried it on had to have it fixed before I could use it
4.0,I am very satisfied with this wallet. Compact. Sturdy. And easy to use.
4.0,"Nice and warm, good size as expected, heads up though that the wine plaid is extremely purple while it looks more deep colored in the picture. Thankfully my son doesn’t mind. Over all a good product!!"
4.0,"I returned this dress - really cute, but it was too small."
4.0,Love the way it looks. Need to wear thicker socks for a more comfortable fit. A bit narrow on my pinky toe after a long day but I'll sacrifice that for the style :)
4.0,"Good anorak for everyday wear; great value with removable winter lining. My only complaint is that it is ""noisy."" It crinkles ... a lot. I'll probably wash that out over the winter, but ... good to know if you're planning to rob banks while wearing it ... I've heard it isn't waterproof, but you could always Scotchgard it, especially for the price!"
4.0,Comfortable shoes which means a lot to someone who has chronic foot problems. Would have been 5 stars except the color of boot is different than expected and the faux leather does not masquerade as real leather very well. I will keep as they are a good boot for the price.
4.0,"Deep and rich beautiful shade of green with sparkling accent stones. One of the earrings is not sitting correctly, and in turn hangs cockeyed. Seem to be crafted with quality materials."
4.0,"These are so pretty. They're much better quality than I expected them to be! Applying them does seem to be a bit hard and I was worried about it pinching my skin while putting on the backing but it's not that bad.<br /><br />And for the price, it's worth it considering how much 8 pairs at a store like Hot Topic or something else would charge!"
4.0,It fits right and is comfortable.  Not too hot.  It also seems to provide good posture support.  I researched several similar products and believe this was a good value for the money.
4.0,"This works very well for me because I want a very light weight skirt for some hot and humid weather.  And I appreciate the pockets!  But if you are looking for more substantial fabric, look elsewhere."
4.0,Glasses were very well packaged with a very sturdy frame & spring hinges. My intent was to purchase anti-glare glasses that didn't project glare/reflection from room lighting on the lens that would be seen while doing Zoom calls.<br /><br />It may be my understanding of the anti-glare filter and will continue to use for reading purposes.<br /><br />I will continue to search for ways to eliminate light reflection on glass lens.
4.0,"Love this necklace! I did hope it would sparkle a little more, but still...it’s super cute and trendy."
4.0,"This bag lasted for 3 years, never stripped. The straps just got worn."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a7e8245eed5b575e64d991005cb380cb]] Adorable sweatshirt with a cute ""rainbow"" print. Nice color and ok fabric (95% cotton) that doesn't really stretch.<br />However, I didn't expect it to be so thin! Definitely not for winter."
4.0,"Love this dress, the material is so silky and comfortable! Since I am short (4&#34;11) I will be picking it up an inch at the shoulders so that the top is in the right place, but it fits perfectly once I do that!"
4.0,"Keeps me warm and is very versatile. You can wear it as a scarf, as a hat, with the nose cover cinched up or under your chin.  Only problem I'm runnign into is fogging up my glasses.  I've been wearing it a lot here in colorado lately."
4.0,"I expected the spikes to be a bit bigger like the ones in the picture but that’s ok, they look nice still, happy with my purchase tbh."
4.0,"I love it! Fits perfect. I ordered the purple one. I'm 146 pounds, 5'4 I ordered size medium, beautiful."
4.0,So far I like them; they're not a thick fabric but they're soft and comfortable.
4.0,"I love these tights--I wish they were a little thicker and I wish I had ordered them in a small rather than a medium.  I am 5'3"" 130lbs."
4.0,This is looking good but it’s sort rough to wear
4.0,"These are comfortable , light weight...glad I ordered a bigger size as they shrank a lot...!"
4.0,The only thing I don't like about it is when it goes in the laundry everything else comes out with blue fuzz.
4.0,"It is really comfortable but I've been on a weight loss journey since October and was hoping this to fit in a few months, it is a perfect fit now! I'm about 5'7 and 180 and got a large. It's slightly confusing to put on the second time- first time I just slipped into it still hooked but I'm sure I'll get thw hang of it. Will have to order a smaller on when I lose more weight, it's ok- they arr pretty cheap cost wise for a bra! Great support!"
4.0,Perfect size and looks good too
4.0,Frames look and feel cheaper than discount pharmacy alternative
4.0,I totally love these sunglasses and the variety of colors available. It is fun to use them but the holders to the ears tend to break from the frames. This has happened to two of the sets and they were colors I really liked. I still use the others but I not sure I would re-order them if I have the same experience with them.
4.0,This was a amazing gift for a little grl who loves angels and butterflys
4.0,The band is more sttractive than the photis can tell but it’s a little too small
4.0,"Cool looking ring.<br />The ""secret compartment"" is quite shallow, but I bought it more for the novelty aspect of it, so that's cool.<br />It's advertised as a man's ring, but it is small enough that it looks more unisex.<br />I'm really happy with it, and its a great value as well."
4.0,Great very cool vintage look to it
4.0,"Great jacket, but runs small"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:79855b9f8463f8bc43b5745542cf073b]] I ordered a black dress but was sent a white one. It's fine because I've been meaning to get a light colored dress so I could wear the pink blouse since it doesn't look well with dark colors. The dress has somethimg about it that reminds me of easter. Though adult size, it feels a bit childish. Which isn't bad. It makes me feel young, but at my age, i think thats a good thing. When the wind blows, the dress sticks to my legs but doesn't go up, which is nice since its short. It's a cute dress overall. It is baggy on me, but i think with a dress like this, it's not supposed to be tight."
4.0,"Wonderful fabric and size is as described. I ordered the one marked &#34;green&#34;. It is a deep Kelly Green (not blue-ish as it appears on my monitor) and the owl is rather orangish, not brown. Not going to go with the navy outfit I had planned for next weekend, but I will adjust. I am going to keep it, It is pretty and I am happy to wear it."
4.0,"I'm 5'4 155lbs and I ordered a medium.  I'm more bottom heavy vs top heave.  The swimsuit came as shown and is beautiful.  Good Material for the price.  The bra is raises a bit but you can adjust the straps lower and just make sure the tied part is tight. With me having a rounder bottom, I have trouble at times finding bathing suits that fit my butt, but this fit perfectly  Overall, I really like this bathing suit and can't wait to wear it in Jamaica in two weeks!"
4.0,"But the delivery and shipping is very slow, the tracking number didn’t work on any delivery service. Product-good transaction and delivery- poor. I would not recommend"
4.0,My daughter loves her shorts but rolls down the waist as she finds them a bit too high for her gimnastics practice!
4.0,"Very good quality, however, it is not for high arch as stated. I got it because it was mentioned that it's for 7cm arch, but it's very low."
4.0,Some sharp corners on the anklet but overall beautiful
4.0,They are much larger than I perceived them to be looking at picture. When they say oversized they mean it.
4.0,Buen vestido 😉
4.0,It would have been really helpful if they showed this device next to something for scale in the pictures.
4.0,Good quality dress. Just not flattering for my body type.
4.0,"it's smaller than I thought.  But it's good and seems sturdy enough not brake so easily. If you're someone who has a habit of carrying more than they need anywhere I would definitely recommend it. It has plenty of room of for things. Seems water proof, If you're planning on a trip to an amusement park but don't want carry a book-bag or a tiny purse for your souvenirs or other things I would recommend this. It's big enough for a few water bottles, your more, and other thing, and there's extra room for anything else you get while on your trip.  nice fast devielry / I would order from this company again the future."
4.0,"how fun, color is perfect & they look good.."
4.0,It looks longer in the picture.
4.0,They're cute earrings.  Arrived quickly and the price was right!
4.0,Can see what time it is with no problem. Just what I wanted.
4.0,"Durable, strong, professional, stylish.... Highly recommended"
4.0,"Ordered large, have a 36 waist and fits well. Length is over the knee. Pockets could be a little deeper."
4.0,"I got this for my father-in-law when I noticed his smaller version was about done with all the daily wear and tear.  I was still at home so I had an opportunity to see it when it came in.  The organizer is exactly how it's pictured. The leather is good quality and all the extras like the calculator and appointment schedule were solid, not flimsy or cheap at all.  My father-in-law loves it and he's had it now for two years. So I would recommend this to others who are looking for a small enough organizer that has a little of everything to make day to day activities less stressful and more organized."
4.0,This necklace is beautiful! One of my best purchases. I've used this necklace multiple days in a row. This necklace is so cute and also this necklace  perfect for a gift! It came quickly and I would definitely purchase it again for preparing a gift!!
4.0,Great fit and quite unique pants!
4.0,"Clean cut, quality bar to set you apart as professional who cares about his appearance.<br />It also keeps your tie centered and neat, making it functional to boot."
4.0,"Good shirt for the price point, had a few strings hanging from it when it arrived and the stitching is off on the pocket but its still cute."
4.0,"Good quality scarf, I like it that you really have to look close to see the Harley Quinn character in there, otherwise from a distance it just looks like a beautiful black and red scarf."
4.0,Big but work
4.0,"threaded slightly big, wish it was a little sleeker but its still a decent necklace."
4.0,I ordered them larger because my grandbaby is growing fast.
4.0,If you are a tall person or want to wear really high (5-6 inch heels) this is the dress for you.  I am 5’5” and wanted to wear it casual in the summer with sandals.
4.0,Fits fine happy with this purchase
4.0,Just what I was looking for . Great  Quality
4.0,Steve Davidson hi
4.0,"I've bought 2 pairs of these in the past, they look good and feel good as well.<br />There are a couple spots where the seams/stitching hasn't been completely finished which leads to holes and strands of thread sooner or later."
4.0,It's exactly as seen!
4.0,Great quality for the price but took a while to get here.
4.0,"smaller than expected, but great style and material"
4.0,"Looks nice and was easy to put on my watch, but not the most comfortable watchband I've worn.  The inside metal clasp doesn't fit the natural curve of my wrist and is a little irritating... but it does look nice."
4.0,"This purse was lovely, it didn't work for me.  It was too small to fit all the items I needed to carry."
4.0,"The good:  it's NOT at all itchy. The colors are as bright as in the picture.  The sizing is on point, and even if you miss its' stretchy plenty.<br />The bad: I ordered it in September. It made it to me in November.<br />The ugly: the shoulder seam unraveled completely when I tried to hang it up on a hanger. Nothing that can't be sewn up."
4.0,These jelly’s are really fun to wear. Buckles do not work well but I put snaps on them and they worked perfectly
4.0,I like this except for the fact that it makes your breasts look weird. The straps cause a weird pull on the fabric and it goes right down the middle of the breasts.
4.0,this dress has a good fit and looks really cute.  Only thing is the belt is black and the dress is navy and white  It looks a bit off.  will be replacing the belt
4.0,"Small enough for the pocket and fits on a key Chain.  I love it!!<br />Older Coin Collectors will love it to check change when they are out and about shopping etc,"
4.0,"I need to order a size up, but otherwise these were pretty nice. Might be best to order a size larger than the size chart indicates. The bands are thinner and not as strong as other designs I've ordered in the past, like Fruit of the Loom or Just My Size.  It's not so bad that I won't order them again, however."
4.0,Really like this piece! The straps hanging from the sleeves can be a little annoying but overall I think it's great! There is just enough weight to it that it is comfortable but not too hot. I would definitely recommend this. Love it in black!
4.0,"I'm a size 12 and this fits, but is tight. Fabric is nice, and arrived early."
4.0,"This is a fabulous garment.  The material is soft and smooth.  It is not not very thick, and not too thin.  It has a relaxed and flattering fit that doesn’t keep you too warm.  I would say it runs true to size.  Dress it up or casual.  Great addition to the wardrobe"
4.0,it is a little small but it is ok
4.0,Cute and simple but tight around the lower stomach and butt area
4.0,"Se ve muy bonito pero al paso del tiempo si no lo cuidas se le van haciendo bolitas en las partes donde tiene más roce, friccion."
4.0,A little smaller than I had expected.  Has an expansion loop on the back to fine tune size.  Good quality and the raised lettering is bold and stands out against the digital camo effect.  I would recommend to support your trooper.
4.0,worth the buy they are so awesome
4.0,Was expecting it to be a little longer but fit proper
4.0,Perfect for “out of this world” themed high school dance. Good quality.
4.0,"Im keeping it, but it's slightly large at the top. Otherwise, looks great!"
4.0,"The fabric is of  polyester described as satin, and  the nightgown was full of statics the  very moment I took it out of the box., all sparkles and crackles. What would happen next at night? Shall I light the night lamp on without the switch even being touched?.. like out of some science fiction novel. But otherwise,  the slip looks adorable."
4.0,"I love this necklace, it is beautiful and fits very well around the neck. It's perfect to dress up and bland shirt or dress. My only complaint was that the metal circles can bend easily if not handled carefully."
4.0,I love the outfit itself. Buy disappointed on the sizing. It looks huge! The shipping also took a little over a month with no way to pay extra to ship faster. The material seems great for as cheap as it is though and I can't wait for my son to wear this.
4.0,It looks good. Pretty much as pictured... But its small. It wouldnt fit an average sized man or larger.
4.0,Great color & perfect with my outfit.
4.0,Liked the color of the watch. It was a dressy looking watch
4.0,it was very nice  and it what it said it was
4.0,I really like these socks. Thank you.
4.0,Runs a little small but SEXY! Probably too hot to wear much in the summer but I'll break it out in the fall :) Put it in wash (delicate) immediately though - the smell out of packaging was icky. 5'6 and 135 lbs
4.0,A little hard to get thredded and I'm still not sure I did it right but they look good and its nice not to have to tie/untie every time making it much easier to take them on & off.
4.0,"I love the material and really love the images.<br />Sadly, they are huge so i must tighten them to keep from falling off my face. It  is hard to talk while wearing them. As an alternative, I wear a better-fitting mask underneath which allows me to show my Christmas spirit in spite of the pandemic."
4.0,Fit nice and packaged nice! Color was vibrant! Will order from here again.
4.0,The dress is good he only thing is that is that the fabric too delicate
4.0,"I bought these for about $8 for 8 hats eventhough there are similar hats from different brand/vendor for around $11-12 for (also) 8 hats. These have 2 sizes. I chose the larger one (1T-4T) and it fits both my 5 months old son and my 2 years old son because they are stretchy. They are just a bit long for my 5 months old which is not a big deal since I can always fold them up). I don't think it will be comfortable or be able to achieve the desired look for a 4 years old unless he/she has smaller head. The only reason I took off 1 star is because there are 8 different colors of hats in the pack and they are made of different fabrics/materials. 1-2 of them has thicker fabric which I don't like much for my need (I bought these mainly for my 5 months old to protect his head from being scratched by his own little hands. He has some sort of allergy there, FYI)"
4.0,"I have PCOS so my waistline fluctuates A LOT (anyone got any tips on how to make that stop? Lol)<br />Without the extended belly I’m usually a size small. But I’ve been ordering medium - especially with tight fitting bodycon type pieces.<br />Waistline is fine - comfortable. Could be constructed a bit better for the price & I wish it was a bit thicker to hide the pooch but I’ve had this skirt on my wishlist for a while simply because the cut gives the illusion that I have hips.<br /><br />I had to roll it quite a bit. The skirt was simply too too long.<br />Yes, I know I’m extra on the short side but I own plenty of “mini skirts” that are still somewhat short.<br /><br />I won’t wear it the way I intended to (with a cute crop top) so I’m trying to find a new look for it.<br />Still, I love it."
4.0,Very sturdy...have lasted me 6 months so far of constant travel. The only two downsides are 1) they're a little pricey and 2) they are pretty heavy which can be bad for travel.
4.0,Very nice boots... I really like them.
4.0,This was snug in the legs and a size smaller than expected. The quality was really nice though!
4.0,Like these but I hate that they often slip off over my ankle while walking thereby only halfway on my foot.
4.0,Me gustaron sólo que me puse los rosados y se me cayó la piedra y no la encontre par poderla pegar
4.0,"It fit well and it was thicker than most I liked that,wasn’t afraid it would break"
4.0,This dress is cute and the material is thicker then you think so size up for comfort!
4.0,Pants look great but are smaller than listed.
4.0,Talla esperada
4.0,Love these and they are just long enough.
4.0,"Very cute but it runs large. I always wear a medium, sometimes I’m cautious if something says it fits snug & I might even size up, however I could definitely wear a small in this top."
4.0,Product was a great fit for the Large Kamato Ceramic smoker sold by Costco.
4.0,"I love this! The front is really nice, exactly what I was looking for. I only had to take off one star because the shirt tends to ride up in the back. I gotta wear it with higher-waisted pants, maybe even a belt. Anyway, it's great to wear on dates and stuff."
4.0,"The pendant is really nice, and was smaller than I was expecting.  The down side is I don't really like the cord it came with.  It was difficult to get the waxy cord to tie a knot and then when I did finally I couldn't get it around my head."
4.0,Absolutely adorable! The stiletto is small and delicate and matches the blue gem perfectly. Fun belly ring to have and wear.
4.0,"I bought this as momento of trip to Ireland. I forgot to buy myself a necklace in Ireland, and was happy when I saw this. I have had several compliments on it. When I look at it, I remember a great trip and want to go back!"
4.0,Good Quality but not very stretchy.  The item was about 2 sizes too small for my little one.
4.0,This is simply elegant! Very comfortable and flattering. Not often you find  that all in one dress!
4.0,"I'm normally a L/12 in dresses, I ordered up because of the other reviews. It fits great. Long enough work, fun enough for brunch. It fits nicely around my butt and makes it look amazing."
4.0,Very soft and great color. Runs a little bit small though...
4.0,I used these swim trunks when I went on a trip to the bahamas and they work well in the ocean/pool.
4.0,"These are very nice costume jewelry.  I am sure they are  not &#34;real&#34; turquoise but the size is good and I will wear them to work, etc. I think the $30 price is a bit high but not a horribly so given the construction of the earrings.  I found similar earrings at a local flea market and that vendor wanted $65/pr.  Yikes!"
4.0,Cute but hard to see through it. Eye slits are small and I wear glasses
4.0,"I like the bikini, fit as expected but the material could be better."
4.0,"Cute.  Doesn’t last.  The color tarnishes after a few wears.  But, for the price, it served its purpose. :)"
4.0,Awesome product great craftsmanship a little on the small side fast shipping
4.0,"The belt that I received is black on both sides, not reversible from black to brown.  It is a thick casual leather belt, 1.5 inches wide,  with a brushed nickel metal buckle. It is stamped 100% genuine leather and it is flexible enough to be comfortable around one’s waist but can easily be marked or scuffed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I went by the product page sizing chart when selecting this belt for my husband.  He wears jeans with a size 36” waist.  The sizing chart in the product description stated that a size 42 belt is suitable for 35”- 37” pants waist.  It also mentioned that for proper fit, order two full sizes larger than one’s normal waist size.  Going according to these directions, I wound up with a belt that is a good six inches longer than those that my husband usually wears.  I am not deducting any stars from my rating due to my error in selecting a size, just mentioning it in case it helps anyone else who may be confused by the product page sizing guidelines. The belt comes in a nice presentation package and includes a hole puncher, which makes it easy enough to adjust the belt to size.<br /><br />This belt is smooth leather with no stitching to come undone.  The weakest part of the belt seems to be the loop which easily slides off and is held together by a thick staple.  Actually the loose belt loop slipped off when I was examining the belt. While I was searching for it,  I worried that one of my small dogs may have eaten it and the staple, before I finally found it down the side of my chair.  Overall, this is a nice basic belt that would go well with jeans or any type of casual pants.<br /><br />Disclosure: A complimentary product was sent to me for trial and evaluation. I have no connection to the seller or the manufacturer and my review is based solely on my perception of the merits of the product."
4.0,"Loved everything about this. The color was as pictured, doesnt feel in anyway cheap, nice and study and i love the leather strap. Bought other kinds and there was always a slight off fit but this fit the key for my hyundai perfectly and i like that it uses screws so if it falls no need to worry about it flying apart."
4.0,Liked the sparkle and size. Looks like costume jewelry and it is but I am happy with this purchase
4.0,I like the support of the underwear but it seems a bit smaller after a few washes.  Quality is excellent.  I just wish it had more room in the pouch.
4.0,"Very good bag ,founs a similar at Mashalls for 29.00 so for 19.00 is just good."
4.0,"I am a size 12. I ordered the xxl to make sure they would fit but they were much too big. Very well made though, so I just altered them."
4.0,It fit ok. Was short
4.0,"very nice to workout or extra layer, doesn't stretch much"
4.0,"I liked the idea of these yoga pants because they had a dip in the front to accommodate a large (and still growing) pregnant belly and a stretchy fabric that is not at all constricting.  The fabric is thicker than other exercise pants that I have but still stretchy and breathable.  I've worn these in many exercise classes and they don't shift around.  The pants also hit at a nice point on my leg - right around the mid-calf.  I need to wash these a few more times to assess longevity, but thus far the fabric seems to be holding up to consistent (3-4x a week) use.  If you have pets, they do attract hair but most black colored fabrics do.  I would like to see these stretch pants in different solid colors.<br /><br />I received a complimentary pair of pants for evaluation purposes."
4.0,"Buy 2 sizes to big, they shrink up a lot - But it is a very comfortable shirt and stylish for the price."
4.0,I received  great compliment on my sunflower  necklace. I would  recommend  this  necklace  to family  and  friends
4.0,"These are very light and soft and keep you warm even when it's cold and windy. I wear my pants around my hip and these are a little snug, not as loose as I would have liked."
4.0,Zipper is a little hard to handle .
4.0,Fits well. Didn't help waves but still a good product.
4.0,like them. they match my turquoise jewelry
4.0,"The chain is short  as one is not able to put up to your eye to use it.  Otherwise, my grandson is enjoying it.  It did not arrive on Friday as it stated it would and did not arrive until the following Monday."
4.0,Beautiful bag! Only downside is that it is a little hard to close if you have more than a wallet and a cell phone in there.
4.0,"Comfortable and fits well. I haven't washed it yet, so I don't know how it will hold up though."
4.0,these are nice just to wear for show.
4.0,"Fit much smaller than expected. But comfortable. I bought them for my husband, but after going through the wash they fit me.much better than him. (He couldnt get them over his thighs.<br /><br />Buuut, they fit me great and have great pockets<br /><br />Just order like 2 sizes up!"
4.0,"A little tight in the shoulders, but definitely doable. I'm usually a large and ordered a large."
4.0,Smaller than expected however great price looks good. I bought black.
4.0,"Actuall runs a little big, which I personally prefer for sleepwear;) Really cute & comfy soft material."
4.0,"The armholes fit awkwardly, either because they are too big for the size, or were not cut in proportion to the  rest of the material."
4.0,But the clasp keeps coming undone. I can easily fix with a jewelry repair kit. But very cute and packaged nicely.<br />Would buy this again for sure.
4.0,my 11 yr old grandson absolutely loved his jacket.
4.0,Great replacement for a tri-fold billfold. Previous one wore out and this one was an excellent replacement. Only negative was the price.
4.0,Looks like picture but is long. I'm 5'8 and it goes to my ankle.
4.0,I love the fabric (its not too thin) and the style of this dress. I ordered a green and black one as well. I wear them with leggings and feel like a million bucks! Pay close attention to the measurements listed. I usually wear a 3x and I had to order a 5x to have it fit.
4.0,Great bag but wish it was a bit smaller.  Very well made and attractive.
4.0,"They might be too short, depending on how you make your masks. I ordered some others that were an inch or so longer, and I prefer the longer ones."
4.0,The chain itself is a little dull but for $6 I really shouldn't complain.
4.0,Nice shirt for vacation.  Decent quality.
4.0,"I absolutely loved this dress! It’s gorgeous and fit as expected. I am 5’8 and 140lbs. The material was kind of an odd heavier material hence why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, but still looked fabulous."
4.0,Based on reviews I sized up but it is really large in the chest area.  Everything else fits perfect but it's very saggy under the arm area because it's too wide.  I normally wear an XL or 16 and I got a XXL. I'm going to return it and get a smaller size.  Hopefully the XL will be perfect. Fingers crossed.
4.0,Cute shirt but not super flattering. Needs to be tucked so it looks best. I’m not disappointed but not completely thrilled with it.
4.0,"This is a very compact/light way to travel with some spare space in case you need to bring purchases or other additional items home. I wouldn't load it up with a huge amount of weight but it's a lot smaller and lighter than typical foldable duffels. The main design change that I would make is having either longer handles or some sort of lightweight shoulder strap. As it is, it's not really designed to be thrown over a shoulder."
4.0,"Definitely supportive, however, I have a somewhat narrow foot and I have to wrap it around fairly far and it gets under my foot making it more uncomfortable sometimes. I often couple this with a compression sock and really like the combination of the two. I brought this along to a recent trip to Las Vegas and found it to be helpful for all the walking around."
4.0,Bought as a gift for a friend and she likes it a lot
4.0,"I'm 5' 6"", and 125 lbs.<br /><br />This dress is made of soft fabric and feels nice and is slightly stretchy. I like how the dress hugs the body and presents a form-fitting look. This particular dark blue/navy color is very beautiful, and the length of the dress looks nice, extending below the knees. The skirt has a little swing to it but confidently stays weighted. The zipper is somewhat hidden and does not resist as much as other zippers. There are no loose stitches to be seen. The neckline brings back a retro look while the front presentation gives a non-traditional look."
4.0,"I love this skirt!!! It's so pretty and classy. Only problem is the skirt is about two inches too long. I normally don't have that problem being 5'7, but this needs to get hemmed."
4.0,"Great fabric. If you’re an XL,  order an L."
4.0,"Got this for my husband and it fits him comfortably.  He has a tummy, wears XL and shirt fits him comfortably."
4.0,"I like this bracelet more than the others that are available.  I previously had the mesh one and it would catch on everything.  This bracelet fits nice, looks good and is easy to adjust."
4.0,They are nice slippers but run small so I have to return them.
4.0,These are really nice and exactly what I expected from the description. They are not super soft but have a great look and I like how they are thinner material so they are not bulky but instead are really easy to wear. Perfect for fall.
4.0,Love the set. Got two differnt sized 2mm plugs so that super sucks for starting out and didn't realize till I started transition. So have to keep a taper in. But cute set came well packaged
4.0,order a size up then normal size
4.0,REALLY warm
4.0,I WASNT CRAZY ABOUT THEM BUT THEY WORKED
4.0,"Great hat for women, fashionable, but fits on the larger side."
4.0,"These are fairly similar to mucks and other type of rubber waterproof boots. They run a little large. But overall a nice pair of boots for the price. Not just gardening boots, I use them for farm chores."
4.0,"Nice earrings. I’ve gotten others from different brands and those all used to unravel easily. These haven’t at all and are of good quality. I know people are saying they’re too heavy, but it’s not bad at all. I like that they’re not lighter weight because then they’d be more flimsy."
4.0,"Works wonderfully, the joystick covers are cheap. I tossed them in the trash after the popped off a bajillion times, but I didn’t purchase it for those so all is well. Would definitely recommend!"
4.0,They are cute but not what I expected they are a little snug fitting yet I also got sent a large instead of an extra large which I ordered
4.0,"I was hoping for a true ivory, but this is almost yellow, more like a natural linen.  They are very comfy and well-made, but the elastic waistband is quite heavy and not very flattering in the back.  I am debating whether to keep, return, or try a different color."
4.0,Runs small but i stil like it 😘
4.0,Great pattern for 60’s theme party. Good quality aa well.
4.0,Nice tank top but was too big!
4.0,Love the purse. Just wish the shoulder strap arrived with it. I'm very pleased otherwise.
4.0,"This is a beautiful pendant that just happens to be on a really weak chain.  The pendant itself is very heavy.  The blue flowers do not move, meaning each pendant will be unique, and the red flowers are free to move around.  The chain is very long but broke when I tried to open the clasp.  Thankfully, I had a better chain there to move the pendant to."
4.0,"Fabric is a little scratchy, but overall I like this product, especially at the low price. I would definitely size up. I wear a L, so I bought an XL and it's just about right."
4.0,"Super cute! The material is very thin, though, and is more cropped (shorter) than pictured."
4.0,Not as heavy material as I expected. Fun hat!
4.0,DIFFERENT. I LIKE IT.
4.0,good and strong!
4.0,The dress fit well. The fabric was not see through. My only misgiving is that the striped top looks as if the colors would bleed when washed.
4.0,"I like how this fits me but if you have small arms you might want to size down. I went with my usual 2x but my biceps are large for my size. If they were smaller a 1x would have been perfect. Lots of room but flattering drape, particularly if you have a large busy."
4.0,"Fit as expected, I really like the thin breathable material, very light weight.. They would have made it to 5 stars but they have given me horrible blisters when running! They have just become my running around shoes, I have to buy a different pair for actual running."
4.0,"If you are looking for a value tote this is it. The 5 pack is sewn well, the handles are large and comfortable to hold. The material however is thin. You can hold it up and see through it. They would be great for making a fun beach bag or grocery bag. I would not expect​ to be able to carry a lot of heavy items in them though."
4.0,These are not as dark as I had hoped they would be and the polarization on them is not very prominent. However they do the trick and are much better than the other pair I had ordered a few days ago and I decided I would at least try them out for a bit and maybe go to an actual optical store to find what I am really looking for.<br /><br />I am not sure these are really the LOCS brand as listed in the description but they are very similar to the OG Veteran directly from the vendor.
4.0,"Pretty bracelet. Love all the colors. Would give it a higher rating if it were not so difficult to put on one-handed. The lobster claw catch is a little tight, and it takes multiple tries to attach it making it a bit frustrating."
4.0,Good quality my kid loved it
4.0,"I like being able to flip the clip on sunglasses. When I walk the city streets in shady areas or when I enter stores, I've no need for sunglasses so I flip the glasses up. And when I walk outside in sunny areas I flip them down to protect my eyes from the sun."
4.0,"Nice quality and my daughter loves it, but it's gigantic!"
4.0,great for reading in bed at night.  It would be nice if they were a bit longer and wider.
4.0,But it is beautiful.
4.0,"Ordered a small, got a medium but it still fit okay. My boyfriend tried them on and they fit him perfectly since his hands are bigger than mine. They feel very warm, pretty durable, nice textures. You can make a fist with these gloves unlike some other gloves that are bigger and more stiff. Would buy again regardless of the size being medium."
4.0,I love the quality but they’re a little big. I ordered the smallest size available and they were still too big in the waist and shorter in the leg which is normal for me. I’m 5’10 and wear a 0/2 for reference. If they were just a little smaller they’d be perfect. They wash well and don’t hold the sweat scent which is great.
4.0,Don't like that big of loop.
4.0,Beautiful earrings I gave this a 4 star because I am missing one earring. ☹️
4.0,muy bueno!!!
4.0,"was well-received as a gift- arrived as promised. Appeared to be too big, but is flexible enough to work on my 15 year old's ear."
4.0,works well and was given to the fish collector of our family.  He really likes it and wears it on occasion
4.0,Arrived quickly....beautiful
4.0,"Somewhat small, but still wearable for me. Super cute!"
4.0,"Loved this bolero for my Vader costume, but the collar part across the neck rubbed my skin raw."
4.0,"I love the print of the white dress with tree/leaves print on it.  There are a few things I will mention.  I am 5'2&#34; and 130lbs and the Medium size was a bit loose on me.  i would order another print dress in Small size next time.  There is a useless drawstring in front and I will cut it.  The length is great for my height, no hemming needed.  It's not stretchy material, very light cotton type so ironing will be needed. It is also a little low cut so I like to wear a tan color tank top under it."
4.0,Super cute!! Get insoles as long walks in the rain aren't great in these boots without insoles. They run large a half size probably to give you room for your pant leg and or thick socks.
4.0,"The keychain was well made and has some weight to it, dispite being a bit smaller than expected."
4.0,It’s cute.  I like the color
4.0,It wasn't the material I thought it would be made out of but it was worth the purchase. Given as a gift and they LOVED it!!!
4.0,For the price it’s pretty nice.<br />Ordered a medium usually wear a medium or small fit well.<br />Material isn’t  see-through and it’s pretty thick
4.0,"Love the Topaz heart and glad it was made in the USA. The chain was (as I had read in other reviews) definitely too small for the heart. I ended up buying another necklace that complimented it better. I definitely suggest they get a different type of necklace to go with the pendant. Otherwise it was perfect. By the way, I wear it every day!"
4.0,On the short side but still cute.
4.0,Shirt was a bit larger than was expected or described
4.0,"Overall I like these socks. I get cold fingers and toes basically year round, So I wear thermal or thick wool socks about 10 months of the year.<br />These are softer than most others, they are super comfy.<br />I like how they ""stay up"" the elastic is nice but not too tight.<br />They are not **THE WARMEST ** socks, but they do a pretty good job for most of the time. When it is *really* cold out or when I am walking in wet weather my toes are not as warm as with other socks (which are more expensive/thicker etc). But then again that is just me, my fingers and toes are super sensitive to cold.<br /><br />All in all I like these socks they are a good quality sock, thick enough to keep your feet warm for daily wear and very soft."
4.0,"More of a relaxed fit than I expected, but it's fine & fun to wear."
4.0,These are very soft.
4.0,Good for multiple camera use
4.0,This looked like a nice hat but it was too small for my head!
4.0,I love these pants the only thing I wish is that it was more stretchy material
4.0,They fit well and work fine. Glad I bought them.
4.0,Great gloves. Only used for a short time bc my daughter lost one early in the season. But the time we did get with them they worked great. Not the warmest glove ever. But served the recesses outside in Minnesota just fine.
4.0,I wish material was thicker
4.0,"Just got it and put it on my Nixon Mission smart watch, seems to fit nicely. If the band didn't taper and stayed wide I would give it 5 stars."
4.0,"nice suit.  good bust support.  chest a bit too small, skirt full and adequate"
4.0,"The hauberk is very high quality but the seller may want to consider having more detailed information about the shirt’s dimensions. The phrase “one size fits most” is less than accurate. From my own experience, and from reading the reviews of others, the size of the shirt can vary wildly. Some have stated that the skirt falls to the mid-thigh of a 6ft man; however, I’m only 5’9” and usually wear a L size and the shirts falls a few inches below my navel and is quite tight. I’ve been working on adjusting the mail and am almost finished, but I do wish that I had been provided with a better idea of what to expect. Otherwise, I absolutely love the hauberk!"
4.0,Used for a lady wolverine cosplay. Had to cut the black edges off so that they couldn't be seen in my hand. Otherwise worked as needed.
4.0,I loved it. Only thing that sucked was the pilling.
4.0,"This bracelet is expandable and fits different wrist sizes. It has a design with three charms, the evil eye, the hand of fatima, the trevol blade for protection and luck, it is pretty simple for daily use.Lucky bra"
4.0,"I love the purse, but I wish it had an outside pocket. I would actually give 4.5. Beautifully made"
4.0,my only disappointment is that the black runs
4.0,"This t-shirt is nice but it doesn't have much stretch and its thick so you better order the size that works for you because there is no give and little breathe.  Where I live is too hot for this material so I am going to return.  However, if you prefer those thicker stiffer non wrinkling shirts, you might prefer this."
4.0,I love how this dress looks but it is incredibly itchy around the neck and sleeves.
4.0,"This cute.  For the price I'd give it 5 stars, but the ring was one of those adjustable carnival rings.  The rest of the pieces are light weight, obviously not expensive, but, wearing them, they look much nicer than the price would indicate."
4.0,Thanks to David Jewelers I did get the ring and I like it. Amazon sent me an EMPTY box...
4.0,"It is a good one except that the back is lower than expected. It looks cute and fits well. The quality is very good and my daughter has worn it for 4 months, the color is still vivid."
4.0,VERY NICE VIBRANT COLORS. LOOKS JUST LIKE PICTURE.
4.0,my wife like it great product
4.0,Fits just fine and it's worth the money.
4.0,Pretty dress but I think the sizes run a little large
4.0,"Beautiful dress, got the dress grand daughter, looks as in pic the only thing is the zipper is hard to zip up"
4.0,"The PROS: They are incredibly soft and comfy to wear to bed. They look very nice on and would be great for a trip where other people are going to see you in your pajamas. The armscye isn't enormous and the neck is a good size, not too low cut and not so high that it chokes you. The top itself is big and roomy and both pieces feel like they are made very well. They are high quality and survived the washer and dryer very well.<br /><br />The CONS: The waist is cut about a size below the marked size. I tried an XL, and the shorts fit about like a large or a well-cut medium. I'm glad I went for a bigger size than I needed, as I would recommend it to others as well.<br /><br />The MISCELLANEOUS: The ties at the bottom of the top are a little odd, cute, but my cat tried to murder me for wearing them, so I had to twist them all up and tuck them into the shorts when I was in the same room as him."
4.0,Very beautful but not too soft....
4.0,The glasses are an excellent value for the money.  The interchangeable lenses fit every need
4.0,Exactly what I needed to cover up but not be hot
4.0,Fragile chain but she loved it!
4.0,"For the price, these are nice looking shoes.  They are a Payless Shoe Source brand.  I found the exact same ones, for the exact same price at the Payless attached to our local Shopko.  They are not well made but you get what you pay for. They are not actual leather but I did not expect them to be for the price. I guess you could call these vegan &#34;leather&#34;.  For the number of times and length I expect him to wear them, they will work fine.  He's got wide feet in the toe and they fit him fine."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:87f5ab82c1aec526594e3a461b70595c]] mask looks awesome, lights are very bright and its well made. will be definitely getting more colors!"
4.0,I wish the top was a little thicker. Other than that I really like it.
4.0,"Just  need to get use to them. Still need a wash clothe for wiping tables, etc."
4.0,"It is actually a burgundy color. I don’t mind that color but was looking for red. Otherwise the fit was true to size and cloth quality was good. Despite this, I will likely return it and look for a product that better suits what I need."
4.0,"I gave this as a gift and can not give a fair review  as I have not really handled, washed, and the wee one is not even here yet. But from what I did see, very cute. Fast shipping."
4.0,"It looks exactly the same as shown in the pictures, and it is very comfortable. My little friend really loves it, and she wouldn't take it off. :p"
4.0,"Aside from this fit being more &#34;extra small&#34; than &#34;small&#34;, I love everything about this dress.  The style and print are great!"
4.0,Vibrant colors. Flexible for all wrist sizes. Durable. Great price!
4.0,Overall I love the watch but the only issue is the back light. It only lights up 1/3 of the watch and the rest is dark. I actually sent the watch back to get another one because I thought it was broke
4.0,But love it anyway
4.0,Works pretty good!
4.0,The shirt was a bit longer than I expected. Overall the quality was pretty good for the price. I would purchase again.
4.0,Couldn't decide to.keep or not.  Arm  holes way to big going to return
4.0,Runs large which is probably my faults due to reading the reviews and reading that people that usually wear a small ordered a large and it fit them. I usually can fit into a small to medium but ordered the large. To big. Will keep as it's very comfortable and will continue to wash in hot water and dry in high heat and I think will eventually fit me. Should have gotten a medium.
4.0,"So it does run a bit big if you're a lady (which was what I was afraid of). However, it arrived in tact and on time. Made how you would expect for the price. Did the trick for my Stevie Nicks Halloween costume. Hot glued some lace and feathers. Worked out nice."
4.0,This is a very nice dress. It comes right to the knee and it is very flattering I would recommend wearing a tank top under it. I only say that because the spandex materiel clings a bit and you can see your bra through it.
4.0,Just buy a size bigger
4.0,I would one say that the slit in the back is too high for my taste! I dont want an accidental exposure
4.0,"I got this dress for graduation pictures, absolutely loved it. It’s not very breathable for hot sticky days though. It fit true to size and I wasn’t disappointed"
4.0,I get a lot of compliments on this bracelet.
4.0,This product does have a place to hook a leash but take my advice when I say this is for decorative purposes only. This collar didnt last one minute. The first time he pulled on the leash it broke right in half. And he wasnt pulling that hard either. Its very very cheap material. I only gave it 3 stars because it is cute. But it's not functional.
4.0,"The coatas it is, it's pretty and fits my wife perfectly. However it's not waterproof. Upon contact with the seller they were very polite and help. They refunded half of what I payed and allowed me to keep the coat."
4.0,Well I was Disappointed since I bought these sunglasses for my wife and after wearing only a handful of times the arms became very loose and one of the nose pads fell off.  The return window closed and I was annoyed.  A SojoS rep read my first review and contacted me offering an opportunity to replace or return them.  I took them up on their offer and commend them for their attention and great customer service.  THANKS.  Will reconsider another purchase in the future.
4.0,"Can’t wait to wear it! Looks sexier than I anticipated, but not too much."
4.0,I have had several strangers ask me about my crab purse. They like it as much as I do.
4.0,Great tank love the saying. Runs a little on the larger side.
4.0,"Already broke the little leather &#34;Belt holder&#34; loop, first try, since it's only stapled together. I'll fix it though...cheap is cheap. Otherwise, these are pretty cool for the price!"
4.0,Cute. light fall sweater.
4.0,La talla perfecta
4.0,A great top.. material a bit thin but nice
4.0,Un poquito largo de lo esperado.
4.0,"This is a good, easy going summer dress.  It's my throw on dress for the summer.  The fabric isn't too thick nor is it too see threw.  The dress is flattering on me.  The first time I ordered I ordered an XL, that was a little too tight for my liking, contacted the seller they resent me an XXL and told me to keep the XL one, which was super cool of them.  The XXL fitted better on me, I don't dry it in the dryer I only hang dry mines.  So if you're curvy like I am sized up for sure."
4.0,Order was received quicker than acknowledged. Good value for the money. I would advise buying one size larger than you normally would wear.
4.0,"Arrived on time. Fit as expected.  Elastic didn't last for as long as you would think.  It got loose about 4 months, worn maybe 1 a week.  So maybe 15-20 washes."
4.0,"Casual dress, Nice Color, little short for me."
4.0,This was a nice set of bracelets. Nicely priced.
4.0,"Loved it, but it tarnished very quickly."
4.0,Nice fit. Not too big in the arm holes.
4.0,A great shirt!  The only issue I have is that the wrist holes are VERY large and cause the long sleeves to feel a bit floppy.
4.0,Stance socks are comfortable and last a reasonably long time. I wish they had an XL instead of just L-XL. Size does vary somewhat between styles.
4.0,"Great, except lacking a button I thought they had. I will sew one on.... but they are quality."
4.0,Very comfortable.  The only con would be if you have a long torso. It seems to ride up. Wish the straps were a little longer for us tall people.
4.0,"Live among Cthulhu fans.  This is a hit.  Some knitting around whey holes got too loose too easily, but I suspect it was a user and not a knitter issue."
4.0,"No one mentioned how it would sound...I feel like I am walking around in a diaper because of the noise it makes as it crinkles. But, its like making noise when you wear corduroy pants.  Its poofy, and can get even poofier if I wanted.  I just wanted something to &quot;fill&quot; out my dress.  It does that for sure and then some!  I did not want it as poofy as it is, but I think Im asking for a lot."
4.0,Not enough coverage for the sides. Armhole exposes to much skin.
4.0,"Great shirt. A tiny bit snug but after you wear it, it stretches out some. I cut the bottom about two inches cause it was long. If you are thin and like to tuck in your shirt, This Is the shirt for you. Cool design too."
4.0,"Updated - 5 years after buying this wallet, it still looks brand new (and I’m quite rough with it). I don’t know how they did it, but I just bought and received a second one.<br /><br />The first one I bought did smell like fish food for the first few months, but the new one doesn’t smell at all. It included some odor-absorbent packets, which must have done the trick."
4.0,The material is very high quality and is very thick. It runs true to size. It doesn’t really cinch in your waist. The top is really nice and has removable inserts though I don’t recommend it for high intensity workouts. It wouldn’t provide too much support
4.0,These worked great for my husbands dark angel costume for Halloween.
4.0,"Arrived as expected. The material could be better quality & it's pretty bulky. But it serves it's purpose & allows the Fitbit one to be worn as an armband. For that I am satisfied. I also haven't had, nor do I foresee any issues with it coming undone & losing the one. It seems to hold the one very securely & attaches quite well to my wrist."
4.0,Really cute but runs small. I’m typically a s-m and ordered a M. it fits small. I’m exchanging for a L hopefully it fits better.
4.0,"I am satisfied with the bag ,it has plenty of compartments Wichita makestate it easy to organize."
4.0,Good for the price. Holds my thick locs up at night.
4.0,Crisp and cool. Nice packaging. Fabric nice and soft. Great cover. I love this shirt because it covers the butt and stomach while still looking stylish. Great price for a nice product! Leaves it to the imagination about you true size.
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress! Great material and print but it was way too small and have to return. An x large is not an 18 as described, or a 16. Wish they made bigger sizes."
4.0,"Beautiful had, no doubt. However I bought it after reading it could be adjusted. There was a simple string in the lining of the band but it did not adjust. Glad I bought it anyway."
4.0,I'ts so pretty and you can't beat the price!
4.0,I bought a 2 XL when I normally buy an L or XL.  Glad I did.  It does run small but other than that I LOVE THIS!!!!!!
4.0,"The neck is a bit wide for me, otherwise I like it a lot."
4.0,"This dress is very inexpensive and very pretty. For the price I was expecting to be losing sequins everywhere, but to my surprise the dress is actually pretty well made. My only complaint is the shoulder/back straps on the garment — they look cheap & have a plastic adjustment clasp on them. I have longer hair, so I just covered them up with my hair. Overall, if you’re in a pinch & don’t have the time/resources to buy or rent a higher quality gown this will definitely work. It looks beautiful & could hold its own at any run of the mill formal event."
4.0,Came right on time. They are warm and toasty.
4.0,Comfortable and look nice
4.0,"This fits well and the opening is so convenient - it swings all the way open and out of the way rather than pulling down and having to be tucked away. The drawback is that it's a little on the flimsy side (not too bad...just not as supportive as I'd thought it might be), and the cups are sewed in a way that makes them rather &#34;pointy.&#34; Not just showing through...it's like that all the time. So it'd be tricky to wear under most knit shirts. I haven't yet tried with a nursing pad so hoping that will smooth it out a bit. It's very comfortable and convenient, though, so I'll probably wear it a lot at home."
4.0,"Received my necklace on time and intact. Quality and look of it is about what I expected for the price I paid, not the best but also not a piece of garbage. Would recommend this to anyone interested in purchasing."
4.0,"Good item for the money, we'll see how it holds up. Feel and graphics are good. Hope it wears well in hot weather as stated. As far as fit I read the reviews and ordered accordingly. I'm 5'11 180 lbs and the XXXL fit exactly right; I normally wear a large in American sizes, so ordering up 3 seems the rule of thumb here."
4.0,Gloves are nice and warm and they seem to be made if good quality materials.....so far so good
4.0,It was a bit on the small size for an xl but it looked great and also washed well. I washed in the machine and hung on a hanger to dry. Didn't need to iron!!
4.0,Super cute! It works for all my doggos do I dont have to get a stocking for each one. My bird is also obsessed with it! she likes to sit in it.
4.0,"Very nice, only looks expensive."
4.0,"This is a really cute top, but there was a little bit of fraying immediately from the lace. Also it left a black stain on my under arms. I haven't washed it yet so I'm hoping the lace will hold up. It fits really well and made a nice holiday shirt."
4.0,Interesting top that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion.  I am quite satisfied with this purchase.
4.0,Vewwy vewwy AZN!!
4.0,I like the bands they fit well with my SE watch and they function as should. I will definitely be ordering other colors.
4.0,These were cute but way to hot for me as I live in Florida.  They seem to be decent quality but I’ll update after they have some wear and tear.
4.0,The colors in this necklace compliments each other.
4.0,"Slightly small, but still very comfortable"
4.0,Christmas eve celebration.
4.0,"I really like them. Very convenient, very cute. Bought the wrong size though. Or possibly they run a little big. I wish I knew."
4.0,"I am 5'4, 145 pounds. I purchased a size small because I have the same size in a long sleeve version. I'd say it fits just slightly tighter than my other shirt but not enough that I would size up. The color is a true navy. It is soft, has the right amount of stretch, and washes well. Very comfy!"
4.0,I use this as a ankle bracelet. No other comment allowed
4.0,I ordered a size up because I read the reviews on it being too short. (XL) I'm 5'7 love the dress but definitely air drying to keep from shrinking.
4.0,I ordered the XL. I'm 5'8&#34; and normally wear a size 16. The material was very stretchy and I probably could've gotten a large. It was perfect with a petticoat under it. I got lots of compliments.
4.0,Very please!
4.0,Cool gloves... a little tight... fit snug like the OJ Simpson gloves...but I like them
4.0,Cuter cute!! Too big on my wrist.
4.0,It was beautiful but you need petticoats to make full fluffy look
4.0,Fit is no where near my size even reading reviews and using size chart
4.0,Love skirt; colors are very vivid and I love the feel of the material. I received so many compliments when I wore it. Good quality and price.
4.0,"boyfriend loved it, hes a dancer and said it was roomy and breezy. it's not that warm tho and is prone to tearing"
4.0,"I bought this hoodie for my husband. He is 6'4"", 240lbs, and got an XXL. When he first received it, it was pretty snug. It stretches, but it even looked tight on him. We were concerned that it would shrink in the wash and become too small to wear. In a shocking turn of event, washing it actually helped a lot. It got even softer and cozier out of the dryer, and my husband says it was a better fit after that as well. We've washed it a few times now, and the colors are just as bright. We also haven't noticed any problems with loose threads.<br />One thing to note is that it's not thin, but it's not thick enough for really cold weather either. Cold here is 50 degrees, which this is perfect for. I wouldn't want to be caught in a snow storm with just this hoodie.<br />Definitely worth the price!"
4.0,Very cute and well made for a great price. I love the pockets!
4.0,"Really like these bras.  I have used 3 of them for my daily 35 - 45 minute bootcamp workouts.  They give decent support; the &#34;girls&#34; move up/down ever so slightly, but no flopping around.  They are very comfortable, no cutting into the less muscular areas on my back/underarms.  One of the zippers is off track slightly and makes zipping quite cumbersome; also, the zippers are not high quality (plastic), so I am a little concerned on how long they will last. I did have trouble zipping them up by myself and needed assistance from my hubby; I've found that if I lean over and hold the top closed, I manage to zip it up by myself (will probably sew some eyelets at the top of them, as my 1 favorite front zip bra has, which makes zipping up much easier).  Due to difficulty in zipping, and the one bra w/the off track zipper, I am giving these 4 stars.  However, I would buy again (if they come out w/more color choices), as the set of 5 for $35 is a great deal (my one favorite was $26 all by itself!)."
4.0,very pretty mommy and me dresses. The dress is really nice on but the top lace material is very sensitive and gets caught on everything. I ordered up a size to a medium and it fit perfectly.
4.0,"They have a weird bend to them but otherwise, I love them."
4.0,I bought this to use in my RV. Anyone who has an RV knows space is at a premium.  When deflated this actually does fit I to the little bag with no problem. So easy to store.<br />I can inflate it to my comfort level.
4.0,Small in my breast area which I expected but it fits great around my stomach. So I'm ready to put this to great use with my workouts 😬!
4.0,"I wish I could write that this is somewhat small... but it also fits as expected, I was torn between those two buttons... & I guess the fact that its not teeny tiny & I feel like I picked the best size for my body (12-14) I got XL. It is made for someone with a short torso, I have an average sized torso & I wish this was a little longer. the width was nice & not too little & if you have a decent size bust this is perfect. its supportive. I will probably sew the straps on so it crosses in the back & It isn't a halter but I do that with all my halter bathing suits for support so it doesn't hurt my neck. The material is high quality, seams are well sewn & its so pretty, I can't wait to be a mermaid in this haha. My husband loved it & the bright colors look great with my winter-pale skintone.<br />I received this item discounted in exchange for an unbiased review"
4.0,Not the color I expected but a fine wallet just the same.
4.0,"I love this belt, it's very comfy and stylish. I will definitely buy in another color soon."
4.0,Looks a little flimsy but it’s great to just wear on occasion.
4.0,"My Granddaughter was thrilled with the design, butthe bottom is saggy."
4.0,"I ordered a medium and it’s a nice loose fit. If you are looking for something a bit fitted and you are a US 8/10/Med, you may want to purchase a small. The material has a nice stretch to it and the color is rich and deep. The asymmetrical hem line through me off at first bc I didn’t realize it had one but it’s subtle and doesn’t bother me much. I’m happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Love the color and they feel great, but for a medium they run pretty big in the waist and thigh area."
4.0,"I think it looks great, it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be but it looks great and is made of good materials."
4.0,I thought it would be longer based on the picture. Still pretty though!
4.0,"These are a nice heavyweight very well made sweatpants, colors are true and the sizing is true. Pockets on both sides are adequate size to hold my cell phone, or whatever else. The only drawback to these pants for me is that they are a little too snug around the waist, I would prefer that the elastic bee more loose and I could use the drawstring to tighten them up as needed rather than having them as snug around the waist. I enjoy wearing them and they fit well, but I can't wear them all day because I find the waste being too snug annoying for a long wear. I will put them on and wear them for a few hours, however."
4.0,Runs a size smaller in the chest area otherwise cute summer/country top
4.0,Returned first belt.  I am a 38waist. The 41 inch belt did not fit. Order the 44 inch version and save yourself some trouble. Easy to trim to fit. But again I am a 38  and it was not necessary.
4.0,fit fine. I'm 5'5 194lbs I got an XL and it fits fine. Arms have space. the dress is thin but not see through... good work or church dress.
4.0,Love it wearing it now!
4.0,"GRREAT SHIRT, JUST TOO SMALL."
4.0,"This dress is even more adorable than it looked in the pics! I'm generally a busty size 16, 5'6&#34;, and the XL fit beautifully. I thought it was going to be too short where it splits in the front (based on reviews), but it wasn't AT ALL.  It is VERY flattering, makes my waist and bust look great, flares out nicely below, and the upper back of it has JUST enough poof to not be tight against back bra-induced lumpiness, and hubby said it gave a lovely back/waist/hip flair.  I thought it would be light blue but it is light blue and white stripes, very pretty. Holding it up, it looks like it will be a bit too sheer but wasn't at all - I tried it on with a bright red bra underneath and you couldn't tell at all.  Might have to buy this in a few more colors!!!<br /><br />Update: I bought the same exact dress in pink/white stripe, and it suffered from the same problem other reviewers mentioned of being too short at the front split - like you could LITERALLY see my underwear. NOT wearable at all. The back/chest fit the same, but when I measured from the side seam to the front of the wrap ruffle, the pink dress literally had 8&#34; less fabric on each side! CRAZY difference! The dresses had different tag styles and ID numbers on the tags, even identified themselves as different fabrics (surprisingly, while the pink says it's 100% polyester, which seems likely, the blue one which fits great says it's 35% rayon, 65% spandex, which is impossible, there is NO stretch at all).  I really want the PROPERLY fitting one in pink (hubby LOVED the blue one on me!). Amazon customer service suggested contacting the seller to see if they could figure out and resolve the issue and see if they can get me the properly sized version on the next try. I just now sent off a detailed message with all of the details to them, I'll see if/how they reply (if they don't, Amazon promised to send a prepaid return label, no problem).  I'll try to remember to update my review once this is resolved, since I really do love the blue dress.<br /><br />Update 2: emailed several times with seller, they asked for photographs of the issues I described about the dress, I took 30 minutes to take and send a lot of photos and underscored that I wanted to find a way to re order and ensure I got a properly sized dress. They ignored that request in their response and just said they were issuing me a full refund.<br /><br />So, upside, they refunded without me having to go through the hassle of sending the defective dress back but were no help in assuring that if I re ordered, I'd get the properly sized item, so I'm just cutting my losses and accepting that I'll only have this dress in the one color.<br /><br />So, I supposed, buyer, be cautious... You may get a great fitting beautiful dress, or you may get an unwearably too short dress. If it's all wrong, return it, if you re order you may or may not get the right size, no way to tell."
4.0,good skirt but one size smaller.o
4.0,"I overall liked the dress. It fit me as expected. The issue for me was the material. I thought it would have a more cotton feel to it. It’s soft, just not cotton soft."
4.0,"Fun mask, arrived on time as described."
4.0,"My boys were so excited about how these costumes fit. They loved that the costume went over their fingers and feet! It made them feel like they were actually wearing the real thing. The costume is made better than most and has a zipper! Bonus! My oldest son is eleven and usually wears and XL in boys' because he's very tall. It was a little too short for him. So, size up to an adult xs/small if your boy is tall (5'2)."
4.0,"These are awesome I’m in love with these !!! I hesitated to size up so drastically but I’m so glad I did. I ordered a 3x and I was still worried it wouldn’t go over my butt and I’d have to put over my head but they fit perfect I have a 48 around butt but my waist is 36 it fits just right if it was smaller it would not work. I do not recommend for anyone over 180. I’m 170, 5’6"
4.0,"Love the size of the balls. The posts are a little fragile, you must be careful when putting the back ball on the post so you don't bed the post. Otherwise I really love them."
4.0,I bought this hat for my son who loves Volvo's. He really liked it and felt it was good quality.
4.0,Great but SO heavy.
4.0,My daughter loves the feel- once I got the correct size that is! It’s soft and thickish so feels solid and supportive without being oppressive.  She asked if you could make a long sleeved version! Maybe you do.  Will be checking that out.<br />And hey.  Let’s be serious- isn’t it time for another design besides superhero or plain white?
4.0,"Runs big! i'm usually a medium but after reading the reviews, i bought an xs. it fit perfectly well. color is bright red. Nice!"
4.0,"The fabric was more trick sweatshirt material then I expected.  The picture makes it look like it would flow. It doesn't flows, it hangs. I still like it, just not fully what I thought it was going to be."
4.0,"I bought this in hopes of cleaning up my white chucks and bringing them back to white. I watched their videos and all their white shoes were completely white again after going through all kinds of junk and sitting for a day. It really did clean up my shoes on the sole and toe area but the canvas area was still stained. They had been stained by this clay or sand/dirt so it kinda just smeared it. I'm not mad though, sucks it couldn't get it out, but it was a couple of weeks later before I bought this to clean. I figured it since I didn't clean it asap it just stuck in there. This really cleans well though from what the rest of my shoes look like."
4.0,"Stretchy dress, nice dress for 1920s theme party, doesn’t come with any accessories, dress has to be put on over the head"
4.0,My daughter will love this shirt.  Seller quick to respond to issues and we reached an understanding.
4.0,"I really like how tight these shirts fit but they're comfortable. I bought my regular size, Medium and they fit like a glove. The stitching does go out a little after a while but they are a good workout shirt if you want to save money and have compression workout shirts."
4.0,Very cute/sexy! Not a much support though
4.0,Great value. Rich look.
4.0,I am surprised how comfortable it is for the price.  It fits a little loose but that's what I prefer.  Difficult to tell the difference between this T  and others that cost 50% more.
4.0,Well made. Thick and sturdy fabric. Looks like it will last a long time.  Only wish would be that it had a zipper instead of a snap to close it.
4.0,Do not size up or else they will be too big. They are cute and my daughter can't wait to wear them.
4.0,"Great quality, beautiful; however, should be made available in different sizes.  Way too big for a woman with thin wrists."
4.0,Love this!!! Color was beautiful and length was perfect – exactly like on model (but then again I am 5' 1). Only tiny thing is the waist part hits at my rib cage rather than my natural waist but other than that I highly recommend this dress! Can't wait for spring now and show off these legs!
4.0,"It's a bit bulkier than my last card holder, but it holds a lot of cards"
4.0,Bought for my dad.  He loves them.
4.0,Pretty suit. Fits just like I thought. Washes well.
4.0,Cute suit. Made well. No support for your bustline.
4.0,"Very Gaga, would be great for a costume or if your looking for the style without the price! The texture is cool too and I get a lot of compliments in it!"
4.0,"Very comfortable and exactly what I wanted/expected. Only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because when I put one on, it sounded like some of the epastic ripped"
4.0,Cute for casual outfits
4.0,Nice top - true to size - love the color.
4.0,Nice print and nice fabric
4.0,Very warm material with cute pattern. A bit short for my taste (about an inch below my fingertips) and does not cling around the waste  (probably b/c I'm a small b cup). I do like it & plan on keeping it.
4.0,Wrong size shipped. They were 2 mm too small. I was offered a return (not replacement) so I just decided to make them work because they were inexpensive and I like the style so much.<br /><br />These things are very durable. I have two pairs and the first pair hasn't given out after 3 years and shows no signs of wear. I have oily skin that affects the rubbery part on many eyeglass frames I've worn in the past.<br /><br />These are stylish and comfortable and I'll stick with them.
4.0,"They are wonderful to look at but they are very heavy and sort of stretch my ear hole. The stretched ear doesnt look good, but the earring is marvelous."
4.0,"Sizing and color are perfect, the fabric is a little thick so if you're looking for a lightweight cardigan don't buy this one."
4.0,They look and feel like much more expensive glasses and you have to really look to even see the bifocal.
4.0,"The jewelry looked a bit cheap, but the scrunchies and stickers are nice."
4.0,we received a lot of compliments. i was happy with this purchase
4.0,"One piece looks a bit like a wet suit with the zipper front. I ordered this to wear instead of swim shorts and a short sleeve top. I reviewed the size chart and ordered size Medium as I'm 5' 8"" tall, 150 lbs, 34DD bust. This fit as expected but the body section was short for me. Material is a bit thin and can almost see through the pink panels so I'll need wear a swim Botton underneath. Top has a soft shelf type bra with padding for cups, but won't hold anything up if you're top heavy, I'll need to wear a swimsuit top under it as well."
4.0,"Very pretty, feels nice and sturdy, the inside of the purse is not how I thought it would be though."
4.0,"Gave this to my friend and she loved it. The stones are very eye catching and sparkle even in dim lighting, they are faceted to give the stones a lot of fire. However, be aware that the stud stone is a different color blue than the stone of the dangling heart. They are both beautiful, but the top stone is definitely deeper and more of an ocean blue or an indigo than the pale blue heart."
4.0,silver starting to wear but love the ring.
4.0,"love this leotard. its pretty soft and its a bit darker than the color in the picture. it fits great but i realized it has buttons on the bottom which will not work for my real classes. but its good for home practice. on the bright side, its nice quality for the price and i loved the ruching on the front! I'd recommend if you don't mind the buttons."
4.0,"There are many good things about this jacket.  It is indeed light weight, and packable.  The color is very pretty and it can be worn with just about all casual clothing.  It is absolutly perfect!  There is only one thing that made it not right for me.  The jacket fits a bit snug that is very forgiving and made to fit that way. It is just me. I am in my 60's and will look for a different style but still very light weight like this one."
4.0,This bracelet was a gift for me by me and for the price I will really enjoy rocking this cutie!
4.0,"it fits very comfortably, and easy to care for."
4.0,"Super cute dress! I could have used an XS (ordered a small) it’s really large in the waist, and a tiny bit in the bust but I’ll have it altered to fit better. Otherwise the rest of the dress fit well. I’m 5ft, 110lbs 32b-25-37."
4.0,Order a size up and expect alterations for the top (too big) and hem (too long)
4.0,"Good material, very comfortable footbed."
4.0,Good product thank you very much
4.0,its really pretty necklace for gift idea. I really like it.
4.0,I used it to make some boots for my costume. They are design for female legs. I’m 6’4” and they were a little small
4.0,"Based on other reviews, I ordered a medium rather than my normal small. Super comfy, but the fit is a bit weird. Bunchy in the arms...head hole a bit tight for my large Irish noggin. That said, still love and will wear the hoodie"
4.0,like them but wish they were narrower to fit in more blet loops
4.0,"We needed it for color, more than extreme quality.  Does its job."
4.0,I've gotten multiple compliments on this belt!! More than any other belt I have. However....it is VERY small. I'm petite and it is almost uncomfortably tight on me. Do not buy this unless you have quite a small waist.
4.0,The fabric is really good quality!!
4.0,"Warm, comfortable but could use more cushion on insole."
4.0,"This is a pretty shirt and comfortable. It runs a little large though. Even though i normally wear medium-small and ordered a small, it is still pretty loose. The neck line is a little big/deep."
4.0,"This is a cool hat for summer, while providing your eyes some break from the sun.  I'm not a hat kind of person but I really like this one! Although it was a little loose on my head as wind was passing by. I bought it to wear while driving my horse in cart. I received many compliments on this hat!"
4.0,"this thing fits like a glove, stretchy, and elasticy, feeling. my only complaint is how see thru it is. 5'5 150lbs ordered the medium. crotch area is perfect and buttons stay together!!"
4.0,For the money you cannot beat this.
4.0,"Very very cute. Love it even as an adult. Bigger than expected. Fits full size wallet, sunglasses, chapstick, lipstick, medicine case, small lotion, phone, keys, and more. Small outside pocket fits keys and chapstick perfectly. PU leather is very durable feeling. No smell. Nice adjustable strap. Only complaint is the clasp to the strap broke immediately. I fixed it by buying an inexpensive clasp at Walmart. Too cute for the price :)"
4.0,Cute. Not so great after washing. But can still wear.
4.0,These were suggested by my sleep doctor.  I wear them even in the house when watching TV.  Very nice quality.
4.0,Good for that glare at sunset!
4.0,Shorter then what I needed since I wanted to wear with leggings and would like a little tighter since it bunches in the back a bit but it's cute. Would look adorable on a thinner girl but I'm a little overweight and 5'1.
4.0,"The color is super cute( a lilac purple) and the size is perfect for pocket or small purse. I have about 10 cards in it and they all fit fine and doesn't get bulky. Some of the seams on the side ripped easily but it still holds cards and doesn't effect the overall wallet so I still gave 4 stars. I don't care that it has the brand name on it, I am the only one who sees the wallet."
4.0,Its a beautiful dress
4.0,"SO far so good.  It is a soft-shell case - there seems to be some confusion in the product description about this - but it works for me.<br />As for the MOLLE attachment: it is not a standard Molle hardware, but it does work and has all that is needed to attach to MOLLE matrix.<br />Mine came exactly as the picture."
4.0,"I really like the look and feel if this wallet, but in can sometimes be a struggle to get the bills in and out of the wallet"
4.0,These are really nice gloves but unfortunately I had to return them due to the fact that the fingers are not deep enough even for a 3x which is why I gave them 4 stars. The leather is really soft and flexible but still durable quality. The inside liner is soft and warm but not to thick to make them feel bulky. The zippers were a nice touch for ease of taking them off and putting them back on.
4.0,Elegant and comfortable and absolutely perfect for my Agnes of Glasgow ghost costume this Halloween. A little sheer which will require some appropriate white undergarments but otherwise perfect!
4.0,"Not off the shoulder, but still very cute"
4.0,I use it in my classroom to celebrate Wednesdays.  Camel neck needs to be reinforced to stand up though.
4.0,"Great quality!  Slightly too large, but I’ll keep it for the price."
4.0,Excellent socks and is what I expected
4.0,Color is beautiful and looks just like the picture. Also love that ear straps are adjustable.
4.0,"Very fast shipping.  Beautiful watch.  Not sure if a different box was substituted since it was not a ""Prospex"" box but a generic Seiko watch box.  That's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.  All papers, tags and warranty card were correct."
4.0,"Very cute hat and kept my head nice and toasty. Only issue for me was the longer I wore it...the larger it got. I do have a smaller forehead and so the style was more the issue. I did wet it down and let it dry, it was fine again for another long wear. It doesn’t fit right and mess up your hair as much as others.  Can’t find any fault with it, and I did get lots of compliments."
4.0,They were perfect.  My teenage daughter loves them and the fact they can be worn with either color out makes them very versatile
4.0,"Beautiful, but have to agree with other reviews, the clap seems bulky and rattles, until it comes apart"
4.0,"Sin dudas este es un bolso a la moda, pero al ser tan abierto cualquiera puede tomar algo de él.  Creo que se puede usar para una ocasión pero no es de uso diario.<br /><br />En cuanto al material, me encanta la piel de serpiente, se ve muy bien. Pero se debe tener siempre limpio pues se refleja muy fácil cualquier suciedad."
4.0,Great shirts but small
4.0,nice touch to a black dress i bought
4.0,"This is a very cute dress. A little tight on top but not too bad. The material on the skirt is very heavy and stiff. I washed it before wearing it hoping it was just starch but the material remained heavy and slightly stiff. It's a nice style, the skirt material doesn't make it undesirable it just doesn't move as nicely as I thought it would."
4.0,I just got these so I’ll update them at the end of the winter. First of all the gloves are quite comfortable and warm. I really like how wristbands are snug which will help to keep the cold air out. I typically do not use my cell phone while using winter gloves but I can say with 100% certainty that the advertised touch screen ability does not work for me this is not an issue but if it’s a requirement of this purchase you may want to look elsewhere.
4.0,"So pleasantly surprised with this adorable top! I have very long arms and therefore normally size up to a medium, but went with the small instead. The cuffs on the ends of the sleeves make it a perfect fit! So comfy and cute! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it had pockets!"
4.0,I LOVE the color
4.0,This is a great product and I do recommend it.  I'm 6 feet tall and it's a bit short when I sit down.
4.0,They weren't as big as I thought they would be but they are shoulder legnth. It shines pretty great and they aren't toooo heavy.
4.0,Love how soft and comfortable it is and the color. The only negative is the button on the sides to use with face masks - great idea but fabric is so soft that a mask pulls on the buttons too much and would quickly tear a hole in fabric. Fabric would need to be more substantial or have a lining for the design to work.
4.0,"the watch looks nice & the band seems to be decent brand.  has help up well so far.  the only thing I don't like is the face is thick, it is like a quarter inch thick.  i like the lower profile watches.  I don't remember if the description mentioned that so I could have overlooked that part.  but it does look nice & has held up perfectly under everyday wear."
4.0,Expensive shoes for the quality of material<br />The design is outstanding
4.0,I bought these for myself...but they didn't fit nicely. I'm on the smaller side and wear a size 5 jean. My 10 daughter happily took them and loves wearing themm.
4.0,I have ordered this dress in two different colors now.  I just love this dress.  My first quickly became my dress of choice and so I went ahead and ordered it in a different color.  The material isn’t what I had expected but it is solid and not very sheer which is a huge plus with lighter colors.  It also wears better than expected.  I have washed my dresses many times and they still look great.
4.0,I really liked how its not just a plain band. Its very comfortable. The matte finish has a little bit of a metallic shine but not too shiny. I wear it as a daily wedding ring because I have a toddler and didn't want my other to scratch him. I'm pretty tough on jewelry and this is a good alternative.
4.0,Not long enough. Men’s large is too short for a guy 5’11”. I need to exchange it for an XL.
4.0,Size xxl does not fit at a size 16/18. It is too tight in the breast area and there is no strech in that area at all. I busted a couple seama getting it on. No joke. The rest of the dress is very strechy so if you aren't top heavy it may work for you. I will say that EVERY Grace Karin piece that I have is great quality and this is the first that didn't fit.
4.0,"This was a great purchase, my lady loves them and i love her wearing them.<br />The only drawback is the ones without the waits band are not very comfortable and dont stay in place"
4.0,"I love it but i am returning it, one of the arms is broken, so I’ll order a new one 🤞🏼"
4.0,"Very pretty, good quality material. Runs a tad bit large."
4.0,I bought this for a skinny young elementary school student but it was too small to wear.<br />The string of ear part needed to be more carefully made.<br />It was too short.<br />It needed to have some adjustable clip or bead or something to help customize the length of strings.<br />The kid was not a big kid but still too tight to wear.<br />I know it's not easy to make one size fits all but this area should be taken into consideration.<br />Maybe good for toddlers  up to small kindergarteners.
4.0,Love this - it's super cozy and seems well made.
4.0,This is a good quality dress.  It does run slightly big.
4.0,"Liked the clip design and also liked the flap so it could be closed, glasses won't fall out and dirt won't collect in case."
4.0,"I chose this bracelet because I liked the looks of the smaller ID plate. I was also given a choice of the mini-0-link of a curb link chain. I chose the mini-0-link to compliment the smaller ID plate. I have a large wrist and I don't like anything tight around my wrist.  I wasn't sure it was going to fit, but I noticed that extra links would be included in the order so I took a chance. I did end up needing a few extra links. The extra links were easy to install with a couple of jewelers pliers.  This bracelet will fit a tiny wrist for a child or up to 8.5"" for an adult,  with the included links. If you use the included links, you could even wear it as an anklet (think summertime and beaches!).  I like the style...it's subtle, not ""up-in-your-face"" screaming ""HEY, I'M DIABETIC!"", but it's prominent enough that if you can't communicate in an emergency, a medic is going to notice it. The ""diabetic"" engraving on the back is easy to read and looks good!  I wear mine day and night...I never take it off.  It's held up pretty well under some heavy use.  However, if you are going to get in a hot tub, you may want to remove it to keep the chemicals from eroding the finish. I ordered a red symbol, but the paint has worn off my bracelet...again, that is to be expected with all I put it thru 24/7/365. Other than that, it's in good shape!  It is stainless steel and it cleans up nicely with a little bit of jewelry cleaner and a soft cloth. I would recommend this bracelet...it is a good buy. I do wish they offered it in a gold finish for times when I want to feel a bit more dressy. Shipping was really quick.  I received this item several days before the estimated delivery date."
4.0,"Although they are a little bigger than I anticipated, I enjoy wearing them."
4.0,Quality is better than expected.  The material is a little thick but totally worth the price.
4.0,There is no give in the fabric so even though I wear a size 6 the medium works best.  I am 5'3&#34; tall and the dress is perfect length no need to have altered
4.0,"Item arrived quick, the color looks true to the image on Amazon (I purchased &#34;Clover&#34;), and the fit is correct for a men's large.  The weight is light, but not tissue paper thin, which makes the jacket a nice layering piece.  The hoodie I received is 100% cotton which feels smooth and is non-itchy for those with sensitive skin.<br /><br />My jacket had threads hanging from the seams in several locations, but I have found no loose stitches.  All the seams are tight, smooth, and flat.  The zipper pull tab and teeth are metal and the zipper runs smoothly.  The contrasting zipper tape and drawstring cord add a nice pop of color to an otherwise plain hoodie.  The good construction and cotton material make this a very affordable wardrobe staple.<br /><br />If I didn't have to use scissors to trim loose threads on the jacket I received, I would have rated this item five stars.  I would still purchase this item again and wish it was offered in more colors."
4.0,shirt was a little wide and my granddaughter is 4 years old.  not sure if it would fit a 5-6 year old.
4.0,"These beach shorts seem to be well made. They did take a few days longer (6 days longer) to arrive than the other items I ordered but I did receive my alerts so I could track them. Not a huge deal but maybe important to someone who is ordering in a hurry. I returned mine because they were too small. I wear size 18 in womens, and ordered the XXL which  seemed to be a size 12 or maybe a snug 14 upon arrival, or the sizing is ladies not womens sizing, or they're not made in USA. Order up ladies by at least a couple sizes as the fabric is not the stretchy type. Okay, on to my opinion of the the item. The fabric is a quick dry type, similar to mens swim trunks or typical board shorts. There were two pockets in front - the kind that stay closed when you sit (top opening), not the type that open or gap when seated, I liked that. There was also one 3&#34;x3&#34; pocket on the rear that also had a top opening with a velcro flap and a tiny metal grommet to let water out, plus a drawstring at the waist. Common sense will probably tell you that white board shorts will be fairly transparent when wet, they would be appropriate over a swimsuit for public wear. I liked them so much that I will most likely order them again as I get further in my fitness journey. Hope this review helps."
4.0,"I like this tunic shirt, even though I'm a little too tall for it. I am 5'9&#34; about 160 lbs and the slits in the front of the shirt come up sort of high. Also, the proportions of the design are such that it is really made to look like an oversized shirt on a shorter woman. The hip area just seems to hit me in the wrong place with my height. However, the shirt is quite long in the back and does look okay with leggings. Fabric is not the softest and has just a little bit of stretch, but it is comfortable for weekend wear. I like the design, just wish it came in &#34;tall&#34;."
4.0,"order  size  larger, tight in the  arms."
4.0,Very thin material compared to what it looks like online
4.0,These slippers are comfortable but the fit is quite large on my foot. I plan to wash them right away and hope they shrink some. I like them.
4.0,Product is exactly what you see. Only thing that i think could be better are the edges of the mask. But i guess you can just file it down.
4.0,My son loved these good quality and comfort
4.0,Tight around the ankle.
4.0,"Beautiful fabric, just didn't fit me  as expected. Kept to reuse fabric for tops."
4.0,"This outfit was cute sorry I don't have a better picture. I was a little skeptical with ordering it because I've been dieting for the last 7 months and I'm down 40 pounds, so I really didn't know what size to get. I end up getting a XL and it was a tad bit big I kept having to roll the middle part up to make it a little tighter also I weigh 199 pounds if that helps anyone around my sides that wants to buy this."
4.0,Very pretty nice version of sapphire. Nice price
4.0,"Love these boots but make sure you order a full size bigger, I'm really glad I did and they fit just as my normal size would!"
4.0,Super cute but see through in the sunlight.
4.0,If you wear a large your best bet is to get an XL. My guy couldn't fit the large and that's his normal size but they were very helpful with returns and replacements
4.0,"It looks pretty but somehow kind of small, very see through"
4.0,"The material is a little cheap feeling, but it’s very inexpensive and the baby doll fit is so perfect for the look I had in mind for my baby shower! I’m so excited to wear it (I got the pink one, and I’m pairing it with faux snakeskin booties!)"
4.0,"After some minor toe surgery I needed a tight fitting, durable sock - these are awesome. Only concern that held back a five star rating was some shrinkage when washed. I would but them again though!"
4.0,Me queda un poco corto de tronco
4.0,Bought these for my husband. He loves them. Very comfortable and warm
4.0,"Seams are not the greatest around the middle but other than that this is a great dress. I bought the red one, and it is ultra cute. It accentuates my hips and chest while pushing in my stomach. A nice dress for the price."
4.0,"Size is not perfect like branded, lightweight shoes. I got the pairs for my kids, so they can grow into the next size up. she love their new shoes, and so do I! They’re comfortable but little bigger in size my kid wearing heavy snow sock to get perfect,  and color is as pictured."
4.0,very nice shoes. a bit wider than I was expecting.  all in all a nice comfortable shoe
4.0,"The look of the watch band is beautiful. But if not lined up completely, the band can be sharp."
4.0,This is super cute.  I’m normally a S or M in a maxi.  I went with the S and it fits great....but i prefer a long maxi.  This is wearable but it definitely should have been cut longer.  I’m only 5’5”
4.0,Super cute. I'm 5'6&#34; and it fits me great. It's a tad shorter on the side that's not tied but I have a long torso.
4.0,"Not exactly what i expected, little too big around next, but still really cute shirt"
4.0,"Purchased these for our two-year-old daughter, this really helps keep her hair out of her face. Arrived on time and in good condition"
4.0,"Item as described. Wood is nice, pretty, very lightweight. The beads are a little larger than I expected. This rosary would be suitable for a male or female. Stamped &#34;Jerusalem&#34; on the back in two places, and the joining piece has a window with stamped &#34;Aqua Jordanis&#34; and actually contains a drop of liquid."
4.0,love it! fit so good!
4.0,The purple one appears to have silver metal but it's gold.
4.0,"Specs first: I’m 5’9”, 175lbs, Bcup, long torso, majority of weight below waist.  I purchased an XL.<br /><br />The fit was perfect, if you have a short torso, you may have some gapping around the hip area of the swimsuit or the bands on the side. The best thing about the suit to me is it covers that lower belly area (Yes!)<br />If your breasts are large I wouldn’t recommend this, IF you’re able to zip it, the top half would be too tight. If your butt is the same size as the model, then you’ll get the exact same coverage on the bottom.  If you’re bigger, it’ll still fit, just more cheeks hang out, lol<br />With that being said, I’ll wear a cover up when walking around.  Either way, I love this suit...to me, it’s a perfect fit for my body type.  I plan on ordering the white as well."
4.0,"I ordered the Navy dress with parrots on it for my daughter, who love Dr Doolittle. She calls this her Dr Doolittle dress. It runs a little large, so we added a belt to make it fit her better, it will likely fit perfectly next year or the year after. The material is a thick semi-stretchy dress shirt type fabric. The sleeves roll up and button. It buttons down the front. It washed well. The print is clear and vibrant, even though the parrots are printed on the dress rather than being woven into the fabric or embroidered on afterward. The skirt is about knee length. It is a very nice dress, just know that it runs large (wide)."
4.0,"I retuned this nice looking dress, as it was too small in the chest."
4.0,"These are good workout shirts. However, they fit snug, but not snug enough. There's a small amount of compression, but not enough to keep bellies/soft tissue mass more in place when doing high intensity interval training. I'd suggest getting a size down from your normal size. Otherwise, it's a really good shirt for standard workouts like weight lifting or as a base layer."
4.0,It appears that the item will meet my expectations...the material and design is what I wanted.
4.0,"Product was what I needed for an event.  However, it was pricey for just 5 pins."
4.0,Very sturdy feeling mask. I just wish the picture would have been more clear. Looks a little blurry.
4.0,"I love this ring. It’s really cute and the color of the stone is perfect. My only complaint is that the setting is kind of high, but I don’t have too many issues with it getting caught on things."
4.0,My husband loves this hat. He gets compliments everywhere he goes.
4.0,"I have a 6 month old.  She's worn two pairs so far and each time everyone comments on how adorable they are.  Mine came with items as pictured (polka dots, girl owl, girl pirate, flower, etc)."
4.0,"Very nice. Nothing to write home about.  Long lasting. DOES NOT mark or scratch easliy.  Heavy solid ring.  Very much worth the price.  If you are a Mason, this is a great ring.  I am a Mason and I put it on for Masonic functions."
4.0,"Nice band, however I had to cut some edges to have it fit in my Armani Watch. After all it looks great."
4.0,This is a nice bracelet. I am hoping the clasp holds well.
4.0,"I am 5'3&#34; and 200 lbs. I ordered a 2X, it fit perfect. Smooths out all my lumps. Great brand, great quality, I've ordered many other items from Maidenform, and they never disappoint."
4.0,Its to large for my head but its for a costume so imma just sew a strap in the top its low quality but what do u expect
4.0,"Impress your friends with this authentic piece of extreme bling.  The compliments about your ring will come from your friends at the bank and total strangers in the grocery store cash out lines.  The size fits as expected.  The craftsmanship is superb.  There are no visible flaws in the placement of the cubic zirconia stones.  I will say that with the stones on the entire surface of the band, there is a short learning curve getting used to your new Eternity Ring Wedding Band.  There is a slight rubbing affect between the ring and the inside of the pinky and middle finger.<br /><br />When it arrived and came in a well crafted bag, I felt a little bit like Gullum with his Precious.  I'm not suffering an undue amount of lust for my ring, but several other ladies are.  A person is going to have to be up close and personal to determine this isn't the real deal but it's not so severe you're going to want to walk around with armed guards.  I am thoroughly satisfied with the comfort, fit, appearance and craftsman ship of this ring.  A little bit of hot soap and water will see it cleaned.  I was able to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. I was not influenced by anything other than the product. I have no relationship with the seller and I was not compensated."
4.0,Love these earrings get lots of compliments
4.0,"Great fit, the colors are not as vibrant as advertised."
4.0,Does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Textured surface is pleasant for the feet. Only knock is that one needs to dry it thoroughly before putting it in a gym bag or travel bag.  The fitted sandal holds water more than my $4 flip-flops from the PX.<br /><br />Arrived on time and in good condition.
4.0,"Little tight but I expected it to be so considering I have a big head.  Quality is low but better than I expected based on other reviews.  I don't close them and they stay on the dash of my truck most of the time, so with a little care I'm thinking that they will last a good amount of time.  Very dark.  To me I believe they are average dimensions and I should just order a smaller head."
4.0,The indoor/outdoor soles are great. Very comfortable and warm. Sizes seem to be way off. I take an 11 but the 12 size I bought (largest available) is very snug.
4.0,I really love the wand I was not expecting it but love that I got it. The only thing I would like better is if the wings were bigger but they are really pretty
4.0,This was great for the trip to the lake kept the sun off was cooling.  Dried very fast after a dip in the lake as well.
4.0,"Cute hat, I have received many compliments on it, however it is made on the cheap side, quality isn't superior, but passable."
4.0,"Dress is beautiful, color was verry pretty.  Dress is well made. Only issue was we ordered a size 0. It fit exactly like a size 0, except in the bust.  The built in cups were large, like a C cup.  Realistically,  most size 0 are small busted, so this seemed large for a size 0 dress. I was able to remove the cups and the metal ribbing and modified to fit my daughters A cup. She is 5'6 and it hit about an inch above the knee.  She received lots of compliments."
4.0,"Pretty, but different colors than the one in the pic. No yellow, and the stripes are all teal."
4.0,Good for driving and keeping the sun off your arms. I wear them at night to keep my arms from the cold of the air conditioner. Not to happy with the material but over all I like them.
4.0,"snugly fit, I like it,"
4.0,"Love the sweatshirt but after 3 washes, its already getting bally."
4.0,I love the material but they are a little to large. My daughter has them she loves them.
4.0,"Very nice wallet.  Obviously, you could get a nice leather wallet much cheaper than the price of this one.  I purchased this wallet as a companion to the large Dooney & Bourke Montecito Tote handbag.  They look great together and the wallet is finely made - no corners cut, etc.  I really do like the wallet, the only con i can see, in my opinion, is that it could be about 15% bigger - I keep alot of things in my wallet.  The pricing on Amazon was the same as the original Dooney & Bourke website.  I purchased from Amazon because shipping was free.  All in all, a good purchase."
4.0,It deserves three and half stars upon first look. I'll lower it once a friend wears it once or twice if she has issues. I bought it got myself but it doesn't fit in chest at all. Dress has great color and seems well made BUT sizing is off. Runs small and not made for large chests. I'd say anything above a B cup will have fit issues.
4.0,"I have a hard time finding pants, I'm very picky.  I prefer comfort, styling, and easy wash. These pants are a little stretchy and I'm glad that the material is not a lint magnet.  Fit as expected, only downfall is the Lycra/spandex stringies on the belt loops, see photo."
4.0,This costume is absolutely beautiful but it is true to size it is not too small like the manufacturer says. The sizing strongly urged me to go by their measurements which I did and the costume was absolutely humongous. I bought a medium (per the size chart) that was huge on my 5”4 115 lb frame. Then bought an extra small and the extra small was the one that fit me. It actually still was too large and the waist and had it taken in that it was completely worth it because the costume is gorgeous. Do not size up!!!!
4.0,A little too big but still cute
4.0,"I am size 7.5, but these slippers fit like an 8 to 8.5. I think I should have returned them for a size down, but I already worn them twice because they are warm and soft and It’s so cold lately to walk barefoot at night. I like my slippers to fit my feet like regular shoes and not slip out of the slipper so much. For men this size would be fine but for women I think you need to go a size down."
4.0,Love it. Gets a lot of compliments.  The strings to secure the ear flaps are a little flimsy. But this is a good produce.  I would probably buy it again.
4.0,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my adult daughter, however, when I received the items, it seemed more appropriate for my teenage granddaughter.  It is cute & she loved it & wears it constantly.  Bonus, it came with a cute ring also.  The watch seems to be keeping time well so far, time will tell."
4.0,lovely....;0
4.0,For the price of the watch it isn't bad. Plexyglass looking face came cracked but the watch works and is a decent impression of more popular branded watches at a large discount.
4.0,Very nice for the money  literally!
4.0,"Fits a little big on my face, but cute."
4.0,Muy bonito y dino
4.0,The boy liked them very much. Not much room to grow. These were marked xxxXL
4.0,"The color is gorgeous, arrived broken but nothing my hot glue gun couldnt fix, cheap looking metal but not much of it so still cute"
4.0,I like the bracelet it is alittle small
4.0,Great quality but it's shorter than I expected. I'm usually a medium but I bought large and it fits fine.
4.0,This was an anniversary gift for my husband that cant wear a watch on the job. Tou8gh to get the back off to change the battery without scratching it.
4.0,DO NOT IRON! I REPEAT DO NOT IRON!!
4.0,Love the gold color<br />Definately compliments a woman's body<br />Sits on all the right places<br />Worth the price<br />Only con is it comes a bit tangled could use better packaging
4.0,Mustard yellow not bright yellow but it’s ok
4.0,Doesn't look like the pics Nixon provides. In no way is this sellers issue. Love it though.
4.0,I got these as a Gymshark Vital dupe and I actually like them better. The GS in the same size gets a little bit of a wedgie where these are way more flattering. They are very stretchy with compression only in the waist. Unfortunately the color is not what I expected. The coffee color is actually purple. I am planning on buying other colors in this but not happy with the coffee.
4.0,"Purchased this item for young granddaughters. Design is nice, lightweight."
4.0,"Earrings are absolutely gorgeous, it’s a shame I received the item broken. Please see picture."
4.0,"I agree with the Sara Ellis review, which is a nice video explaining all about this case.  This case is of a very high quality.  My only gig is to state directly, alluded to in the video, that the internal ring (where the card holders are located) is non-detachable and non-rotatable.  If it could be detached or rotated to protrude from the case it would useful for primary keys (e.g. auto, house, mailbox).  I have two customer loyalty cards hanging from it instead.  I also am using the exterior hook for my primary keys."
4.0,"I felt a little big the costume, in spite that, the costume was nice and well done!"
4.0,This pajama set is so cute! Love the mix of velour and lace. The velour is very soft and the lace is thick so it won’t rip easily. The straps are adjustable. The pajamas fit fairly snug on your body without being too tight. The only downfalls for me were that the shirt is not quite average length. It is more of a crop top so I wish it was a little longer. The top also shifts easily while sleeping so you might accidentally show more than your intended to.
4.0,Nice pajamas. Comfortable
4.0,"The quality of the material and pattern are nice. It has small pockets on the side, which are handy. Usually I wear small size, 34 EUR, 4-6 US. I ordered those in small size and they are too tight."
4.0,"great quality, beautiful printing, I would suggest to order 1 or 2 sizes bigger than one's usual."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:653638b91a877b00ac5704c90350ab42]] The top fit as expected. Don’t get if you don’t wanna show a little under boob.
4.0,"Love it so pretty, good quality."
4.0,They fit very well but the lenses are not super clear as there is a little distortion.
4.0,"This sweater is as pictured, but a little on the thin side. Not bad for the price!"
4.0,My son loves them but he was wearing them around the pool and at the seam where the toe meets the sole is already starting to tear.  So sad. :(
4.0,This dress is everything! It fits nicely and is somewhat cinched at the waist giving the illusion of curves even if you dont have any!
4.0,I got these for my son. He likes them all right. The material is kinda weird. Delivery was on time.
4.0,"The dress is pretty, rich color and quality material . However im 5'10 and chesty, so the dress waist line was under my breast. I still wore it like a dolly style dress."
4.0,"My husband bought this shirt for a small, simple halloween party.<br />It worked out great.<br /> This shirt is made of a good, not thin,material.<br /> He'll be able to wear this shirt for more halloweens to come."
4.0,I can’t beleive I ordered a swimsuit online and it fits- pretty much. I ordered a large and the bottoms fit more like a medium.  The top is true to size though.  I’m 5’6” 150 lbs and wanted a looser fit on the top so it wasn’t skin tight.  A large was perfect.
4.0,Love the dress but the fabric is a little cheap after a few months it tore but I still love it !
4.0,Very fun pant that will go with several of my blouses.  Love the style.
4.0,I ordered these because I had some similar to them from 10 years ago. I really like them so far.<br />We'll see if I can get another 10 years out of these.
4.0,"Boots are a little narrow, but not enough to return them.  These are great boots that I expect will get a lot of use!"
4.0,"really comfy, definitely gonna buy more"
4.0,"As described, overall good product. Convenient for stepping out the bathroom with."
4.0,Super comfy and cute!!
4.0,Very pretty and light weight so your ears aren't sore after wearing them. A bit longer than I expected but I like them.
4.0,"I love this but my ears dont have that cuff on them so when I would wear it, it would constantly give me discomfort but it's really pretty and would be better for someone with larger ears than me"
4.0,the combination of this bag is actually cute. I personally really like it. But the brown is a little off because obviously it will not be the exact copy. The brown seems a little darker but it does compliment the blue.
4.0,Looks a lot better than the one that came with the watch. Thanks!
4.0,However for the size I ordered the neck was tight to go over my head
4.0,"But they are as nice as shown... Just won't look as good with my usual chunky designs :(. I want to like u, panda hall. I really do"
4.0,"Larger than expected and heavy, but very cute! I just can’t wear them for too long."
4.0,The bands at the knee are way too small. Otherwise they are very nice.
4.0,My 14 year old daughter loves this. Didn’t realize it didn’t have pockets though.
4.0,"Black is harder to tell its mesh l, I work in health care so I used it for a week and it stretched now I am constantly pulling it up. The white didn't do the same."
4.0,Everyone wants it.
4.0,"The first pair of &#34;no-show&#34; socks I've ever owned that are actually no-show.  These seemed a little small, but I have a wide foot.  The padding is weird at first, but super comfy.  They do have some minor issue staying on, especially if my shoes rub my heels, but it is worth it for the no-show."
4.0,"I bought this bib for a friend of mine who became an ""Abuelita"" for the first time.  It is a very cute bib, but I was surprised by the heavy odor when I took it out of the packaging.  It must come from the ink.  Anyway, I'm sure it will be fine after laundering, since all garments for new babies are usually laundered before wearing.  The sentiment is worth the ""SCENT."""
4.0,Chain is slightly shorter than I was expecting but other than that this is exactly what I wanted!
4.0,Light amd airy. Perfect beach attire.
4.0,Earrings very pretty. Lightweight and comfy. Wish I had gotten back to secure in ear. One review said got a gift with purchase but I did not. But they were packaged nicely. Will buy again in another color after seeing how they hold up.
4.0,"The sizes seem to run quite a bit smaller than other things my husband wears. I bought a 4X so it would be roomy and he could fit stuff underneath and it fits him like a 2X like what he normally wears. But, the sleeves are nice a long and they fit him, most of the time he has issues with sleeves being too short being that he is 6'2.  He loves it even tho its smaller than expected."
4.0,"Pretty belt, adds a dressy element to any outfit. Easy to close, but occasionally comes un-done."
4.0,"These stars are so tiny but great as charms! A few stars came with dents in them, and weren’t perfect but that was only about 2 out of the 50. Overall, worth the money and I would buy again!"
4.0,"I don't know if my pair was defective, but they were missing the earring closures. I probably could have closed the hooks with the earring wire itself, but I'm so sued to always wearing those plastic and metal earring backs that I fetched a spare from another pair. (Hey, that rhymes!)<br /><br />I don't know why everyone is complaining about the copyright symbols on the back. They're pretty small, and unless you put them in backwards and then take a zoomed in ear selfie, nobody will notice. I wore them all day for Halloween, and not one person questioned or even saw the notices.<br /><br />They're really not very heavy, I kept forgetting I had them in! Everyone thought they were fabulous, and I am very glad I got them."
4.0,Great quality fabric but runs small
4.0,"Let’s face it, baby shoes are just so stinkin cute. I was never really one to put shoes on non walkers like my son who is now almost two but now that I have a girl, any excuse to accessorize and adorne her is met with enthusiasm on my end. Enter these beauties!<br /><br />Soft leather soled shoes are a relative phenomenon or maybe I’ve just noticed their popularity since I had kids but it looks like every little kid from not even sitting, to crawling, to walking are wearing. However, I will say with caution that not all shoes like this are made equally. I have seen really high quality ones to ones that are so poorly done that it’s shocking they would even leave the manufacturer.<br /><br />These, I am happy to report, are on the high quality end of the spectrum and below is a detailed rundown of its features:<br /><br />Appearance. They look exactly as pictured on the product page. I’ve found that sometimes with Amazon, sometimes what you see isn’t what you end up getting. This is not at all the case. They have several cute designs. I went with the pink and princess crown. The crown is a substantial size and these are perfect for your little miss.<br />Craftsmanship. I’ve tried to take detailed pictures to illustrate the quality in the stitching work here. There are no loose threads or uneven spacing between the stitch. It is a tight stitch that will help keep the shoes together as baby wears them. The leather is buttery soft and the texture is beautiful on them. The leather on the pink part is different from the leather on the princess crown and the silver on the heel portion of the shoe. The bottom of the shoe is more like a suede leather.<br />Sizing. I went with the 12 - 18 month. They were surprisingly big so be warned if you have a little baby. These won’t fit my little girl just yet but I took a picture with my almost two year old who wears a size 7, almost 8 and they fit a little tight as you can see in the heel but they did fit.<br />Price point. At 15 dollars, this is a competitively and fairly priced.<br />Extra bonus. These come with a pair of socks, either pink or blue. They aren’t the best quality socks but nonetheless, it’s a thoughtful gesture from the company to throw in a pair of socks and good extra pair to keep in the diaper bag.<br /><br />Overall I am impressed with these shoes and really like them.<br /><br />I received this at a discount for my honest review."
4.0,"Love that the shirt came the next day I ordered it, and love the way it fits. Probably could of got a smaller size, but its ok. I had a friend put our school name, and mascot head on the front of it."
4.0,"Very nice earrings, so pretty and can wear them with anything"
4.0,"This purse is pretty nice and had received several compliments.  The only comment & perhaps something to be improved would be - to have the hooks on both sides be better & stronger to hold more than 2 items (they are weak & broken easily); most especially if I have my phone, wallet and mini IPad in it.  It can only accommodate light weight items.  Other than that, it looks nice & neat.  thank you."
4.0,"Great length and plenty of material for the flowy effect, but does feel at least 2 sizes too small :("
4.0,This is very pretty - just as it looks in the photo. My only complaint is that it is really hard on my collarbones.
4.0,"This was perfect for our ""baby shark"". I bought this for our vacation at the beach and it work great. It covers nicely and I was able to sneak the hood up to protect his head from the sun ( will not keep a hat on). My only criticism would be it is a little thin- when it got wet you could see through to his diaper. Still worked, and wasn't so thin I was afraid of it tearing.<br />My son has a long torso, and typically wears 18mo tops and 12-18mo bottoms, and the 18-24mo fit him great. I ordered up to make sure it wasn't to tight and would be difficult to get on- and this was perfect, not too snug."
4.0,It's good for the price. Bird pattern looks great from a distance. Very pretty and subtle.
4.0,"Nice earring and love the size, I wish the amethyst were a deeper purple, as depicted in pictures, these are more  lilac in color also  there doesn't seem to be as many facet cuts in stone as depicted in picture."
4.0,"This 3mm stainless steel figaro chain necklace is a perfect addition to every woman's jewelry collection.The sturdy metal stainless steel craftsmanship guarantees a strong ,fade resistant,rust and corrosion resistant and very low maintenance and yet high quality figaro necklace.This necklace is hypoallergenic and safe for everyday wear because it is lead and nickel free. Also, you will never suffer the embarrassment of having the &#34;green neck&#34;syndrome you experience from those cheaply made lead and copper products.This is a premium stainless steel quality figaro necklace that is beautiful and well crafted. Also, the nice lobster claw clasp allows you to easily wear or remove the necklace without frustration and with the knowledge that your necklace will remain securely placed around your neck. I purchased this product during an Amazon lightening deal and I must tell you that the discount is what originally tempted me to purchase this necklace but the quality is what made me fall in love with it. This necklace is perfect for me."
4.0,Decent strap... easy to install comfortable to wear .
4.0,"I want to come out and say that first I was disappointed in these glasses because I bought the blue mirror and there were scuffs on the lenses straight out of the box. However the glasses were well protected and had many levels of packaging. I can only assume that the material coating the lenses is at fault, there also isn't much to the finish, it does't seem to have a layer after the mirror coat as it is almost sticky.<br />If I could, I would exchange mine for the smoke lenses only with no mirroring.<br />Although that was the bad to my purchase, These glasses are well made. They come with a genuine leather case with felted interior which protects the glasses well. The frames are sturdy and if you were to put this next to my RayBans... you could barely tell the differences.<br />The lenses are polarized and deflect sunlight well.<br />I would by again.<br />I don't work for the company for whom I wrote this product review.

4.0,This is the funniest decal ever! We stuck these on our apartment toilet door and it's sure to get our guests laughing! We took the &#34;TOILET&#34; out to make it even more intriguing.<br />Instructions were easy the follow and the packaging was easy to open. The decal came on a grid backing so it was easy to measure the exact spot to place them on.<br />I will say that they are a bit pricey for their size. I have ordered few other decals and they are pretty much 1/10th the price. The benefit with this one is that it came in 2 days via Prime!
4.0,Good quality.. fits perfectly
4.0,"This has worked exactly as anticipated. Color, fit, etc was great"
4.0,The pattern and suit itself is really cute but I am normally a small and that’s what I ordered and the top is loose. You can kind of tighten it though in the front which is nice. It’s definitely a great suit for the price! I am 5’7 127 pounds and athletic build if that helps anyone. The bottoms are definitely cheeky which I like!
4.0,Very light weight. Works well.
4.0,They are good quality and comfortable.  But since they don't have an elastic waist they don't quite fit right.
4.0,"Cute, but cheap material (but definitely get what you pay for) worth the price!"
4.0,this set is super cute for vacation but if you have a smaller chest size down and the bottoms were a little bigger than expected but overall good for price
4.0,T-shirts for the kid
4.0,"Really cute, waist a bit too big"
4.0,They were o.k.
4.0,Nice and warm. Looks good on.
4.0,"Good fit for a larger man. This is a pretty thin costume.  One piece, fastened in back.  That means you can’t do it yourself no matter how long you think your arms are.  Don’t drink because you have to remove it since it is without fly or zipper!  One glove ripped within ten minutes of wear, cheaply sewn. But the kids loved it and it looked good."
4.0,"Good wool fedora. Does not look like cowboy hat like one reviewer said. I normally wear a large hat, but I need to return this for S/M. It could have more specific sizes, but a good hat, just need the right size. Would recommend"
4.0,It does the job and does not look bad.
4.0,I love the jacket! It fits ok but I wish I had ordered an XL.
4.0,"nice, just as expected and pictured"
4.0,"I would have given this suit 5 stars if it weren’t for the weird gold straps on the top and bottom sides. Doesn’t go together, for me. I think the top is adorable.  I wear a 36C/D bra and ordered a large and it fits great."
4.0,Fit as ordered to the size guide in their photos!
4.0,The arms are a little short. Love them though
4.0,Love these !  Super comfy and look really nice  for a causal look .
4.0,"Overall not a bad watch, it's easy to read and easy to set. the watch band is a little difficult to get on with the hump on the end of it."
4.0,I'm 5'6&#34; and currently 150 and wear a size 9/11. I got the XL because I knew the sizes ran smaller than usual. I'd normally get a MED w VicSec if you want to compare what I usually get. The bottoms were fun and cheeky and are cut more like a large bottom.  I prob could have gotten away with a Large for the tops (I'm a 36D) but this top is adjustable so it was fine. I love the material of this bikini and the price was right! Cant wait to use it this summer.
4.0,"This is quite pretty but it is not as easy to get the glasses into the loop as with some other pieces. Not sure if it is the size of the loop or the angle of it, but I have a hard time with it. I do, however, continue to use it since it is an attractive piece."
4.0,"I like it too muh, because I can wear it for work or any casual date. Also is well done so I recomended."
4.0,"Much much too large for my 3 month old. These look like socks for a much larger, probably school aged child, so saying a small will fit 3-24 months is a broad range and a bit of stretch. They definitely shouldn’t be labeled as baby or infant socks at all."
4.0,Looks really nice just small is lil too small order a size up !
4.0,Fine on by bracelet. Darker than appears in ad.
4.0,Stylish & comfy.
4.0,It’s cute but I would’ve thought the dots on the skirt would be gold and they are silver. Doesn’t really match the gold writing. A little disappointed.
4.0,Cute cover-up. Pretty much see through.
4.0,"This great little dress can go anywhere and be accessorized any way you choose.  It is classic and simple, yet has style and enhances your figure.  You can wear it with sandals, tennis shoes, boots, heels - anything goes with this little number which will soon become your easiest dress to wear and you will grab it out of your closet for just about any occasion."
4.0,"Works well with most of my jewelry. There are a few pieces it doesn't seem to help, but for the most part my necklaces and earrings all look better =)"
4.0,"A nice shoe, comfortable. I purchased the brown. The heel is not what I categorize as a kitten heel.  The heel is about 2 1/2 inches high, I prefer kitten heels 2 inches and under. Overall, I like the shoe and the color brown with the darker brown mingled within the color. Its a Keeper!  JB"
4.0,was a gift - recipient loves it - a little smaller than I thought it would be
4.0,"The product is awesome…. But… after I made the purchase, my PayPal account was hacked… Someone was just making purchases!!!"
4.0,The quality and appearance of these gloves is quite good.  They arrived very quickly.  They are a little small for a ladies’ medium.
4.0,Good balaclava. I sewed black patches on my for a quick Deadpool mask. It's a bit warm for indoor use; should be good for winter.
4.0,Great item used it on a trip to Afghanistan for work.  Would have given it 5 stars but it is not as quiet as a fully cloth pillow.
4.0,This is exactly what I wanted. Takes a little time to break in but after that it folds neatly. Holds lots of cards. I like the separate areas for money and receipts.
4.0,"They're great fitting and perfect for hiking the trails. They can get wet, but if you walk in the water you're going to get pebbles/sand in your shoes. The only drawback is if you want to wonder off the trails you can get poked with sticks and prickly brush through the side openings. Overall I really like them."
4.0,Fits well but smells like chemicals
4.0,"as advertised, should last a long time, would do business with again"
4.0,It was a good hat! I had to stuff it with bags to get it to stand up but when I wore it I pinned it on with Bobby pins over all I would buy it again!
4.0,My husband says it’s very comfortable and has stood up well so far.
4.0,The watch is beautiful. Love that you can see the working parts. No glass on the unite up not that big of a deal when you say under $50. It's a little hard to read the time without opening the watch but it may just take time to adjust to the style.
4.0,"Love it! Was slightly disappointed when I realized the ""belt"" wasn't attached but came seperate. No matter how hard I tried I can't get it to look like the picture or get it to stay in place. Other than that I love it!"
4.0,"Cute belt. Not for highwaisted pants or dresses. Wish they had size options so I could get one in this color for my waist.<br />Seems to be a good quality product. Will update if it doesn't hold up!<br /><br />Smelled really strongly of chemicals when I opened it, which was gross but it went away after a couple days. Just be warned because you won't be able to wear it the first couple days after you receive it cause it stinks, bad.<br /><br />Came with a cute keychain though."
4.0,"Exactly as described, but personally felt shorter than I would have preferred; not that you could see anything due to the shorts part under it but just not my personal look. Also wish both sides had pockets"
4.0,"I love this dress.  The material is very nice, and the colors are beautiful. I just could not get the last 2 inches of the zipper up, and I had no bra on.  I'm a size 2, and I ordered a size 4. I have a 30 DDD chest.  if you have a larger chest for your frame size you might consider this issue an order at least one if not two sizes larger. This runs slender around the rib cage and torso."
4.0,"I like them pretty good...I just hate having to wear them period, but I need them for balance.  I can't seem to find any shoulder pad that suits me 100%, but these are new and fresh and substantial."
4.0,"I ordered this dress in two colors and was very pleased with my purchases.  The material is  quite nice and even though the dress is figure- hugging, is does not over-emphasize body flaws (I did get a size larger than I normally wear so that it would not be too clingy).  It is well suited for the occasion for which I bought it."
4.0,Super comfortable! Perfect for traveling in and goes great with leggings. I love wearing to work and get lots of compliments.
4.0,"XS WAS PERFECT...SIMPLE STRAP DRESS JUST HANGS NICELY...IM 5'4"" 112"
4.0,"Decent for the money, couldve had a slightly thicker rope and a better chain for the clasp.  Otherwise, good buy."
4.0,I wish the sleeves were a bit larger and the slip/skirt underneath a bit longer to my necks. Otherwise it’s a nice dress.
4.0,Purchased this for my husband as a casual watch to wear with jeans and such.  Good little watch!
4.0,it very little and I wish the letters was a darker black but it'll work
4.0,"I was a little scared about purchasing it, I thought the material might be cheap. It ended up being a great fit and a great shirt!"
4.0,My son loved this for a Halloween costume
4.0,Jacket was very cute. I purchased it as a gift for my mom. She loved it but we had to return for a smaller size.<br />It ran at least a size bigger than expected.
4.0,Light colors are a little sheer so wear a shirt under the top. Otherwise the set is comfortable and flattering
4.0,"I like being different, and cute rings on my fingers are very attractive...goes very well with my diamonds💍..."
4.0,they do their job well and they are pretty durable too
4.0,Very thin but silky feel.
4.0,They're cheapy sunglasses that I wouldn't be too bummed about if I lost them. They look great and I'm happy with them
4.0,"This dress is very cute, I am curvy and it's fitted for curvy hips.  The top is a bit small, but, I am not top heavy so it works.  The material is thin but would be good for the spring.  Just would be careful how you wash it.  But, can't beat it for the price."
4.0,Very nice looking watch!!!!!
4.0,Very pretty.  Delicate
4.0,cool nice and long beads are great
4.0,"I ordered a Medium and I wear a 34DDD, size 6/8 in pants, and medium sized tops. I’m 5’2” and weigh about 135lbs. Hope this helps someone out there!"
4.0,The material is very thin and I’m not sure the button will hold the flap for long.
4.0,The dress fit well everywhere but the arm openings. They are small and limit arm movement. Otherwise the dress is well made.
4.0,I bought this for a pirate costume. Not too big. Not too small.
4.0,As Seen
4.0,"This was a gift and the babies aren't born yet, so I'm not sure if it fits them or not.  But the mama to be loved them!"
4.0,"Not a bad bag but I ultimately returned it because I didn't realize how massive it is. It honestly reminds me of a messenger bag more than a purse.  So, it works if you like really big bags but I thought it looked strange and I just don't need something that big so I returned it.  Looks just as pictured though and it's pretty cute!"
4.0,"Can't complain, good quality and build, I enjoyed the fact that the frames bend back slightly so fitting won't be an issue. Only complaint is that the film on the outside can scratch easily + they're definitely pretty dark, so I wouldn't wear them unless it's very bright outside. Nonetheless it's a good buy for the money!"
4.0,"So, I am an A cup... and this brews barely too big on me. So, i can imagine it actually wouldn't fit someone with a true B cup. This is not a bra that you should buy if you need a lot of support.. it just isn't made for that. Also, this bra CANNOT stand the heat so stay out of the kitchen. I wore this on the 4th of July and it literally came off the minute i started to sweat even just a little bit.<br /><br />If you are good care of it, the tackiness should stay and there shouldn't be an issues with how long it lasts."
4.0,I ordered a 2x .. It's a little smaller than most 2x shirts
4.0,Too wide in waist and too long..and i have hips
4.0,looks fun.  stocking stuffer
4.0,"The belt is soft, strong, secure and has a good navy color. On the other hand, the buckle has a metal tab that pokes you in the belly when you sit down if you keep the buckle centered over the button of your jeans."
4.0,I'm usually a small for bikini top and medium for the bottom. 5'4 waver around 118-120 lbs. I ordered a large since I read all the reviews and guessed 2 sizes up would be fine. The prints are beautiful. The material is pretty sturdy. Not cheap at all. The only thing I had a problem with is.. it's not long enough. Being it's a 1 piece I feel like stuffed up when I tied the neck strings up. Other than that my buttocks are pretty covered. Not too cheeky. There are boobage padding but if you have the same problem as me then you might have to adjust that part.
4.0,wish i had picked the next size up. Product is what it stated
4.0,"Outstanding product love it, and will deffinately use this vendor for more purchases of paracord bracelets.  Anyone looking for this type of bracelet deffinately needs to look at this vendor"
4.0,"I'm 5'5 and it is almost a little too long. Other than that I loved everything! Fit is good, pattern is beautiful, and the material isn't too heavy."
4.0,"Very nice earrings , they shine ALOT only thing is that they were small but that was my fault but other than the size they are nice earrings"
4.0,These pants are very stretchy and smooth.  The pockets fit my entire phone easily and it stays in place.  The fabric is so stretchy it is stretched on my legs and bunched at my ankle.  I find I need to pull them up at the knee every so often.  I am in the process of losing weight so that could be related? The waist stays up alright and they are opaque when I squat.
4.0,"I like that this shirt has interesting back detail but doesn't require a special bra.  The fabric is nice and soft and not too thin.  I usually wear a medium (5'4&#34;, 140lb) but sized up to a large based on the sizing guidelines, and it fits nicely (skims but is not baggy).  The reason I took off one star, though, is because the sleeves are about 4 inches too long.  I have another shirt from Yucharmyi and the sleeves are fine, so it may just be this design.  In any case, I usually push my sleeves up, so I don't think it will be a problem."
4.0,some of the shells were with halls/broken. nevertheless my daughter liked it so we didnt return it.
4.0,"Love them all,  nicely made"
4.0,"I have be looking for a denim crop top like this for a while. Similar ones were too small, in order to get the right fit to the sizing chart by the company versus Amazon chart ."
4.0,fabric is nice and think and seems to keep my little one cool when dancing. She normally wears a size 5 and this just fits.
4.0,Made good but little too small sending it back order up if you want a loser fit.
4.0,I us sully wear a size 36D and had to get a 42!
4.0,"The hat is tightly woven so it is warm and stretchy to fit many people. The color is a dark tomato red color, very nice, not too bright, similar to a toned-down brick color. The neck gaiter is lined with very soft black fleece-like material (think very soft stuffed animal) and was a little tight to pull over my head, but rested on my neck in a good way, draped properly. It was long enough that if I had to hold it up over my nose and mouth there was plenty of material for me. Hat and gaiter would get 5 stars. The gloves only got 3 stars because the fingers of the gloves are too narrow and I have very narrow fingers and they were tight and uncomfortable for me to wear for more than a minute. The pinky finger and ring finger of the gloves were almost the same length - for my hand the pinky finger of the glove was entirely too long and the extra length of the material was annoyingly in the way. The concept of these gloves with a rubber grip palm and fingers is wonderful. What a good idea when shoveling snow, hands warm and can grip the shovel handle. The glove needs to be redesigned."
4.0,I find it run in the size as a small to a medium. I'm a small and like mine to be on the larger size. Have not washed it yet. I found it to be a nice tight weave of the materials. I think that following the washing machine directions. It will come out great. HOPE to find more from this company in the way  of 100% cotton bathrobes.
4.0,Has an odor but looks nice
4.0,I LIKE THEM VERY MUCH THEY WERE JUST AS THEY APPEARED. THE COLORS WER VERY BRIGHT .  I WILL THEM ALOT.
4.0,Perfect final touch for my anne boleyn costume.
4.0,The necklace is very nice. I love the adjustable rope and the quality is fair. I would suggest this to a friend.
4.0,"My bust is 32.7 in and it fits perfectly. The chart says 28 and sth inches.<br />Edit: the previous was for my first request but my second one, I just requested a different color in the same size and under the arm it does not fit well as the first one; besides, the “eligible for return” option is not allowed anymore and before paying it said “eligible for return” I always check this option availability before paying, so I feel deceived."
4.0,works well with lots of outfits
4.0,Good quality hats at a decent price.
4.0,The wire fell out after wearing for a couple of hours.
4.0,Super cute summer outfit
4.0,Fits bigger. Luckily I read reviews so got a size bigger. It's very soft and comfy. A loose baggy fit. The colors arent same as in photos. They're more of a dark then bright as in photo.  But I still really like it
4.0,Nice looking and very functional.  It's thicker than I thought it would be.  Can definitely hold cash and coins in the 2nd pocket.  Zippers were a little hard at first but after a few times using its easy/smooth now.  I use this as my everyday wallet.
4.0,The only problem I saw was the back made blisters at the end of the day. Wish I would have known to put bandaids on my daughter’s heels.
4.0,"My spouse loves watches, and has quite the large collection. However, not all watch bands are comfortable to wear as they are “out of the box,” so to speak. Usually, getting a watch band size involves a trip to the jewelry store or kiosk, or trying to jerry rig something at home. Not anymore!<br /><br />The BABAN Metal Watch Band Holder Link Pin Remover Base Strap Bracelet Adjust Repair Tool makes it a lot easier to accomplish at home. In the interest of full disclosure, I happen to know someone who works at one of those jewelry kiosks, so I asked for some assistance with figuring this tool out. My helper does advise watching a video on the “Tube” to help figure out how to size your watch. I was fortunate to have hands-on help.<br /><br />The BABAN Metal Watch Band Holder Link Pin Remover Base Strap Bracelet Adjust Repair Tool essentially pushes the pins out of watch links, and then pushes them back in again to set the link in place.<br /><br />How to use:<br />- unscrew the knob with the pin pusher needle, until it is wide enough to fit your watchband<br />- if necessary, adjust the height of your watchband so it lines up with the pin pusher needed by using the disks in the base of the tool<br />- line the pin up with the pin pusher needle &gt; this is also the side with the slit in the side to allow the pin to be pushed through<br />- secure the band in place with the flat “arm”<br />- slowly twist the knob until the pin slowly pushes out the other side<br />- remove the watch from the sizer<br />- pull the pin from the link with pliers (not included)<br />- rinse and repeat, as needed<br />- to put pins in place, set watch back in the sizer<br />- place the pin to be pushed back in place in front of the flat “arm”<br /><br />Pros:<br />- metal &gt; will last longer than plastic<br />- includes two (2) replacement pins<br />- easy to use<br /><br />Cons:<br />- ZERO instructions<br />- pliers to pull pins are not included<br />- takes a bit longer than using hammering tools<br />- may not fit wide band watches<br /><br />With my helper’s assistance, I am confident I can size my watch or any watch added to the spouse’s growing collection. I rated this product four (4) stars because it did not include instructions, and it did not include pliers to remove the pins. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. All opinions expressed herein are my own, with some advice from my helper."
4.0,Very cute and strong shoe. Easy to put on my baby but it is VERY wide. It looks like it was made for a bear cub paw. My little girl has small feet but not any smaller than ay normal baby.
4.0,Nice kimono excellent for pool area
4.0,"Very nice. It took me a few days to get used to the clasp, but overall I like this product."
4.0,Came bent... Buy I set it straight and it is really pretty...
4.0,these shades work well and i have been using them for trap shooting to have a high visibility for the birds.
4.0,"nice comfortable socks, good price and shipped fast."
4.0,"OMG, this is really gorgeous! I just got it in the mail. The shipping is kinda slow but i am really satisfied! I'll wear it tomorrow at work. Perfect set! I'll def recommend it to my colleagues and classmate! 😍"
4.0,It was perfect except the shoulder straps! But the material is nice and it's super cute.
4.0,Very nice earrings. The only complaint/concern is that the posts are very long so uncomfortable to sleep in but overall happy with the product so far.
4.0,Goes very nicely with tops
4.0,Beautiful bright color. Fits my 19mm. Watch perfect. Was a little stiff at first so I wore it with leather softener spray and feels fine now.<br />Would like it in more colors to purchase.
4.0,The straps are thinner then what i thought but it’s super cute
4.0,"He didnt really seem to like it. It wasnt hurting him, hes just picky! but i thought he looked dashing.."
4.0,"Cute! One of the two leaves broke, but I didn't mind much."
4.0,"smaller on the bust, but fit a small D.  cute and adorable product, I paid $4 and was extremely pleased"
4.0,"We got these at the beginning of spring season baseball. They lasted all spring, summer and partially into fall baseball when we realized the cleats were actually worn off. They took a lot of wear, so I we were happy with them."
4.0,"This was a very cute outfit and well worth the price. However, it is very sheer especially the pants."
4.0,"Not as vibrant as expected but super cute! It doesn’t prevent much for the pandemic, but does a good job at hiding my more serious mask and keeps me from touching my face. Works well as a cowl and hair wrap as well. I appreciate the drawstring for a perfect fit and the cool lightweight fabric. Recommend!"
4.0,"This dress is SO pretty – the feather patterns are bright and vibrant, and the material is flowy and accentuates my hour glass shaped body.<br /><br />The hemming and stitching throughout are even, however, you WILL likely have to take in the arm hole, as (pictured below) it is a HUGE hole, gaping open without a quick stitching fix.<br /><br />Once I had the arm holes at a more normal circumference, it was definitely a huge improvement!<br /><br />I’ve received compliments from co-workers, friends, and Husband while wearing this pretty frock – it’s definitely one of my new favourites (despite the initial sixing issue with the arm holes).<br /><br />I am 5’-2” tall with a 36” bust, 30” waist, and 39” hips and the XL fit me perfectly – if you are unsure, size up!"
4.0,I love the look and will purchase again from this company
4.0,Do not like the built in light.  It doesn't illuminate the whole window. Otherwise I love the watch
4.0,Like the little added touches of the chain and pocket square and love the slim fit but my god. I ordered grey. And in picture looks like a darkish grey....definitely light grey almost blue-like.
4.0,"Fits as expected, I wear it often"
4.0,The concept is great and the pants are super warm. However the waist is too big for my skinny 8 year old and there are no ties unfortunately to tighten it. The pants cuffs are loose too so the wind does tend to go in.
4.0,Fit great until it broke.
4.0,Cute glasses. Good quality. Just wish the color appeared slightly lighter to show off its wood made material.
4.0,"Very thin fabric, a bit large, but they worked for what I needed"
4.0,"The dress was what I expected for the price.  I was looking for something loose fitting with POCKETS.  This fit that bill but I am extremely short 4'9""  so it was way too long for me.  Made so that it will be easy to hem."
4.0,"The design is good, and it’s a nice shirt. The material of the black part without the strips looks cheap though, that part is not super black, it has s brownish color, but other than that. It’s a nice shirt. I always wear medium but I ordered small, and it even fits like large. So if you are medium, please order one size lower."
4.0,A bit tight but it is a great spring/ summer dress
4.0,"This was a gift for my Husband for Valentine's. He lo watches.  He collects all kinds Omega, Invicta etc. and this caught my eye. Its not expensive I just thought it was unique. And he loves it. So Thank you very much."
4.0,"Nice, they fit better and are holding up nicer than some American eagle bralettes I bought around he same time as these.  Definitely a good deal"
4.0,"The color is just like in the picture. I ordered a small and found it to be much larger than I expected. I ordered a size small and have a 34D bust, 26 inch waist. The dress is still beautiful and well made for the price."
4.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this ""Kimono"" but it drapes nicely and though it is a light chiffon material provides some cover. It doesn't have a belt or any ties.  I personally use it indoors, mainly as a cover up, but find it an attractive print and material."
4.0,"Looks great with jeans, leggings and dresses!  I really like the zipper up the front.  It’s more unique than most boots I’ve been seeing this fall!<br /><br />They do run true to size but won’t do well for wide feet.  I normally order regular width in shoes (occasionally I’ll need wide) so my feet are kind of borderline.  Because of this, as cute as they are, they are not comfy for long!  If you don’t have that problem with shoes I think they would be great.  The low chunky heel makes them quite easy to walk in!<br /><br />Overall a cute fall boot!"
4.0,"Colors are great. I like the band, and I like the traditional band and closure. The large should be longer though."
4.0,So far they are holding up.
4.0,Did not fit my 10 year old son. Better for adults
4.0,Great bra...especially helpful after surgery
4.0,These are for my son and he loves them.
4.0,Good for the money. Got it to replace cheap suspenders from a fireman costume and they worked great.
4.0,"I got these for my daughter to start school with, she has long thin feet and they work great.  She was very excited to wear them her first day, and was excited to wear them on and off until it got colder.  The sides of the shoe are not quite high enough to help with warmth in the winter months, so they are more for Summer and Spring in my opinion.  I would order another pair for sure, there's no doubt she outgrew this set, but at least they looked cute for a while!  They also held up decently, so worth the money."
4.0,great watch great price. i like it.
4.0,"The item came in a plastic bag. Each of the panties had a label attached to them to make them seem of value. There were six panties that came in the package in six different colors including Black, White, Grey, Mint, Nude and Pink. The colors all looked nice when seeing face to face.<br />I had bought these for my wife to try lace panties for the first time. I am pleased to note that the quality and feel for these panties were above average. The lace pattern and threads are of good quality and sturdy. The elastic is responsive but not sure how well they will hold when washing them. These are hand wash only and I would agree that many are like this in order to prevent damage of the lace.<br /><br />My wife upon wearing these said these felt comfortable and felt like she was not wearing one. The panties from their looks, look sexy and the lace show their patterns and also shows some skin. They allow your body to breathe especially useful in hot climates. The panties with respect to the size were for my wife true to size and the amazon chart was helpful as it picked my wife’s perfect size. The price of these are very reasonable as well. These lace panties are comparable to those from Fredericks in terms of quality but at lower cost.<br />Overall, definitely recommend these if you are a fan of lace.<br /><br />I have received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review for the product. I am in no way affiliated with the seller or product. I write reviews based on previous experience with similar products. I hope you find this review helpful."
4.0,These are comfortable and warm at an excellent price. Definately a good deal. I found them to be a little tite getting over a large head(mine) but I think they'll break in. Even so for the price they'll be great for outside work.
4.0,good shirt. tag has to be removed though.. scratches.
4.0,It's a little snug but not so much I can't wear it
4.0,"These tops are fitted, the colors are somewhat heathered, but still lovely. Perfect to wear during Summer.  I am using them as regular day wear over a pair of jean shorts because they are so comfortable.  I love them enough to buy more in the near future."
4.0,"Very sturdy rings, very accurate to the picture but they don't fit. they are very small and non adjustable."
4.0,"Needed these little gloves to finish off my 80's outfit for my birthday party, and got exactly what I was expecting."
4.0,"Very cute,didn't realize when i purchased that it was a half hoodie but still adorable. It did not fit and waited to long to send it back"
4.0,"Having failed with a couple of other watch band providers to find a watch that fit my 2009 Panerai, this company came through.  Nice fit and color."
4.0,Small.  Would have preferred slightly larger but they are comfortable and easy to wear.  Good for daily use.
4.0,"No comment, ordered as a gift. Was as expected"
4.0,"This is a cute, high quality top. The ruching adds nice detail. It is a bit too short for my taste. I can still wear it but it’s not ideal. I would have given 5 stars if it had a little more length."
4.0,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday couple years ago and it lasted for several years, the only thing that could have made it better if it snapped shut. because it kept undoing. Other than that he loved it!"
4.0,Love it but it's just a little too big!
4.0,Fit as expected and arrived in time for my sons wax museum day at school.
4.0,But is a very nice shirt!
4.0,Its kind of thin but it is soft and comfortable. Not see through. Fits as expected!
4.0,Use this everyday and love it!
4.0,Pedí medida xl y me quedo como chica las medidas están un poco mal
4.0,"I bought this at the last minute to wear to a Steampunk convention. It worked out great!  I tend to be a lil hard to fit (PCOS belly makes my &#34;hip&#34; measurement nearly 10&#34; bigger than my bust, when seated -- and anything that fits my hip measurement then gets too loose in my bust area, despite my F/G cups), but this piece did an acceptable job.<br /><br />The V neck didn't cut too low, and while the sleeves felt a little awkward (it probably could use some tailoring adjustments around the bust/sleeve area), it was not at all uncomfortable to wear. I washed it, but let it hang to dry and it still looks perfectly new.<br /><br />I got several compliments on the outfit, which I didn't expect, but did enjoy!"
4.0,"I didnt get the pink, light blue, nor the dark blue watches."
4.0,"Very thin material. Kind of like a &#34;one vacation use&#34; suit. Still, its a cute fit."
4.0,Did well
4.0,Not bad at all for the price. A little larger than I expected but my wife loved them. She says they feel comfortable even with there larger size and she would continue to wear them.
4.0,I bought this for my girlfriend. She and her daughters love to wear it.
4.0,Was as described in the other feedback. Nice for the price.
4.0,Cute too but very thin and cheaply made.
4.0,Very nice but based on web pic. I thought would be a little bigger. I probably wouldn't have bought it if i paid attention to the diameter that is given in the spec information listing. Anyhow it is nice and i wanted matching pair.
4.0,Awesome shoes. Colour is more bronze/copper in actuality vs the picture but still unique.<br />Arrived with a few scuffs likely from packaging but disappointing considering the cost.
4.0,Cute! Is a polyester material but is still cute and classic. I am 5'4&#34; and 140. I don't like tight stuff but also don't want to look like I wear a bag either. I ordered lg & xlg to be sure. Loved the large.
4.0,Very pretty and well hand crafted. The chain comes in two lengths. Not very sturdy but matches the pendent
4.0,"OK hat, nothing to brag about."
4.0,I used the white one to tie dye. It came out beautifully. I wear the other two as light sweaters. Love them.
4.0,"All my ""when I was there,"" Harvard stuff has worn out.  This is not super quality, but given it's half the price of the COOP, I'll take it."
4.0,These wok pretty good. They fit okay but I think they are a little loose. They would be a perfect 5 star if they were a little tighter in the hitch.
4.0,"I ordered a couple of these and just so you know, there's no bra cup in these.  It's a lae cami t-shirt.  So, if you are wearing this alone, you need to wear something over this, strapless bra, or a regular bra or the girls flashlights will show.  I purchased these to wear under tops but will still have to wear a  strapless bra under this. I ordered a large and it was border line &#34;fit as expected&#34; and &#34;somewhat small&#34;  it is right there in the middle.  But since I am wearing these under tops, I like the slight snugness it has.  The bottom lace part just covered my bun so that was good.  Overall, I like them and and the lace details will get plenty of wear out of them.  I just wish that it had a built in bra."
4.0,"Time will tell if I'll bump this up to 5 star, but very nice watch that looks great when wearing all or mostly black attire."
4.0,en... look not so strong
4.0,"Best feature of these leggings are the side pockets that you can use for your phone , spare change, ID or keys. Material is strong and they are comfortable"
4.0,Really cute but too small will reorder
4.0,I really like these shoes but the clear strip is a little to big around my toes. But the are pretty shoes!
4.0,Really happy with quality and color at the price point!
4.0,Nice sweatshirt. Granddaughter was happy with it.
4.0,I liked the first one so much that I got one for my wife.
4.0,"This dress had great detail! It was a bit small when I used the sizing chart, I purchased a waist trainer so that the dress fit. All in all it was a great dress, I’m 5’8” 150lbs and 36C and got size 14"
4.0,The only reason that it was 4 stars and not the perfect 5 was that the packaging. Looking forward to seeing the packaging in fiber cloth. But highly appreciated that they included a fiber cloth for sunglasses.
4.0,The bottoms come up a bit high for my taste and the bow on the back of the bottoms is odd and unnecessary as well. Not bad for the price.
4.0,"We ordered a size up and it fit perfectly. The fit is very flattering and it was great for a cat themed birthday party. My only issue was the fabric...it was this thin, slippery feeling stuff, not what I would look for in a quality product...but it worked for Florida weather."
4.0,They would work great if you are leaning more towards a size16! these size 14 would fit a little snug but would be just right after wearing for a hour! I should of ordered the 12!
4.0,"This product worked great on some jeans that needed stretching.  A little awkward to figure out at first, but once in place, the stretching was perfect and solved the size problem just fine."
4.0,needs getting used to because the user wakes up with a tired jaw
4.0,Good fit. Sleeves are long by about 2 inches.
4.0,"This sweater is nicer than I expected.  It is very warm and cozy and soft.  I usually wear a L, leaning towards an XL and I did want a loose, casual fit so I ordered XL and there was more than enough room.  If you are between sizes and you want a normal fit, get the smaller size.  If you want a looser fit, get the larger one I would suggest.  It has held up well enough in the wash so far, and I would recommend it."
4.0,Loved colors but medium was huge
4.0,"This dress is quite pretty for the price, and fit wonderfully (5'8&#34; and 150 lbs). I was a little disappointed that the buttons are &#34;fake&#34; and not really functional since I am planning to breastfeed in this, however, if that doesn't matter to you, then yes, I would say, &#34;go for it!&#34; Just be sure to dress up the rest of yourself (hair and makeup), and I don't think anyone else would suspect that you got it for such a great price."
4.0,"Love the feel and texture, also seem of pretty decent quality for the price. It did seem to fit a bit smaller than I expected, but fortunately I did order the size above when I fell between two sizes, so I can wear them, even if they are a bit snug. I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,The price is great but the quality in the chain is pretty low. It will work for now. The lettering on the name is perfect.
4.0,"Just the color I was hoping for. Not exactly the shape inside I wanted, but I still am pleased overall."
4.0,I am so in love with this dress! But I too had the same issue as others have had with the sides 😭<br />They look like wings lol. How do they stay down? I am going to order a different size to see if that fixes the issue because I really want to make this dress work. It's sooo cute!!
4.0,Fit perfectly !!!
4.0,"Bought these for a wedding, but failed to check their fit with the tuxedo shirt that I ended up wearing.  Nearly stroked-out when I couldn't get the heads through the button holes right before the ceremony.  Needless to say, I had no issue with them coming undo prematurely.  Good buy, but just make sure they work with your shirt."
4.0,"I needed a good selection of colors to match different outfits. It's just a little wide where it connects to the watch, compared to the straps that came with my gen 4 Fossil Sport watch"
4.0,"Liked them,ordered 4 but did not get what I chose... 2 were pink, one blue one beige ...but overall very pretty scarf . You can wear at work,get togethers,or date night..."
4.0,Use these daily in summer
4.0,Going along their size scale it’s still really tight to even put it on
4.0,"Thicker than expected. A bit hot in warm weather, but thicker is better for virus prevention."
4.0,"The fabric is rayon and lightweight, I was expecting a bit heavier and more draped look. Color is interesting alternative to black and/or grey but it smells like industrial grease. Not sure why. It is going back."
4.0,"Perfect for use, not the BEST after a few washes, but still does the job!"
4.0,"I have a son who really wanted a necklace and this is perfect for that.  Still cool, but made for boys."
4.0,"Nice fit, loved the color.Length is decent. Good material.Gives shape to my body and cover my tummy.Pretty good for the price.Perferct for summer.I received this dress on a discount for my unbiased review."
4.0,These are a nice looking pant. I'm 5'6&#34; and a solid 10. The pant doesn't have a size but I would say a ten. I would not be able to stretch these around a bigger waist. I would like for them to be longer but I'm used to things being shorter. They hit mid between knee and ankle. I have long legs.<br />They are a nice looking pant with a nice flow. I would recommend and I would order again.
4.0,"I got these in a medium for my son who is around 6' and 160 pounds. They fit him well! The color I got it the light gray, and it's not quite as gray as I (or he) would've liked. It looks a little less gray and a little off white... just not quite right.<br /><br />These are comfortable and fit very well. They are made well and the stitching and buttons seems to be in good shape. The material is lightweight, so perfect for the warmer months.<br /><br />Nice looking shorts that would be great at he golf course or with a casual tee."
4.0,"I ordered a size larger than what my daughter normally wears, and I'm glad I did."
4.0,"Keeps me dry in the rain! The hat may ne taken off if desired. The only lesson I learned is, if you want to sit down or bend far be careful. I bet to put on boots and the zipper ripped a bit. I sewed it back. Tight when sitting. I pull it up if im sitting.<br />Im thin, great just be careful!"
4.0,Seems like a decent bag. Decent quality and sturdy- well built.
4.0,soft and cozy.
4.0,"The print is put on via printing (painted on ink) which is where the smell comes from.  It is not the double layered kind.  Ive purchased three types patterns from this brand.  Solid black double layered, blue flowers on white not double layerd(printed on top of fabric) and white floral print (sewn in pattern double layered). I love these! I won't buy any other kind.  My son as big as average 14 yr old, loves the wearability of his(black). Says it does not slip and slide while talking.  Very comfortable for school ware. The pleats are great and i can keep the bottom one folded plus the adjustable ear loops which allows my 3 yr old to ware it not tight on his face though. My husband's (absolutely hates the restriction and violation of his freedom, very much non masker)black double layered mask is as quoted ""not as restrictive"" as all the others that we have tried. I will not purchase any other kind.  Looks just like the photo. There are some knock off brands. I will only purchase ililily brand."
4.0,"The top is very small, with not a lot of material, so it doesn't give a whole lot of support,  and as someone with bigger boobs, I need. The skirt is really cute tho! Just be aware that it is sheer. I just put a different top with it and i had a cute outfit"
4.0,Cute cover up. The picture doesn't really show the colors properly I will upload a picture when I can. Its more a baby blue color with pastel pink polka dots. cute halter style top that would probably be best suited for a c cup or below (why I knocked off a star) It is like a faux wrap style sheer cover up that would fit a variety of sizes despite it being OS fits all. The back has elastic that would stretch out quite a bit if need be. Super cute and feminine! Would look adorable with a variety of bikini colors as well. I will probably wear it with a white bikini! Super cute. The shipping took about 7 days to get to me in new york so not so terrible.
4.0,"It's a little light for a ""fall/winter"" dress but pairs well with tights. Quite short even on a 5'5 frame, I would call this a mini dress. Comfortable ribbed fabric though the wrist elastic for the sleeve is quite substantial. Fabric washes well and I line dried it without many wrinkles. Overall, recommend!"
4.0,It was too wide for me but that’s nothing a pin can’t fix!
4.0,"I really like! Just fit my 6 y.o. grandson and are so neat looking. He likes cause they feel warm to his bottom and legs. They are fitted not that too big or that sloppy look but they are a little long on my boy. Well constructed in a 60% cotton, 40% polyester and finished, just right nicely.! 4-1/2 stars really! A little pricey as they will outgrow them fast!"
4.0,"Cómoda, agradable, confortable"
4.0,Love the product very much. It runs small though.
4.0,These worked so well! I ordered the D cup size and they fit perfectly. I put them on around 215 in the afternoon and they lasted until about 11 at night in 90 degree weather. I wore them to a wedding and danced in them and wasn’t worried at all about them falling off. I did not put any lotion or anything on my breasts before putting them on. I bought some before a long time ago and they fell off while I was inside a club. The only thing I would change about them is to have a non sticky part for the nipples because it hurt when I took them off. I would definitely recommend these.
4.0,Very well crafted bracelet and fast delivery. I am completely happy and satisfied with my purchase!
4.0,"Very pretty dress, the tutu was good not gone soft or pressed. The back design was good and got lot of compliments.<br />The only issue is lace was coming off near the wrist only after a single-use."
4.0,Hearts only on 1 side.  Otherwise perfect!  Sturdy and long enough for crossbody.  Nice hardware.
4.0,"good fit, comfortable, breathable, great pockets.  small rip occurred on the top of the left pocket seam but it's purely cosmetic at this point. would order again."
4.0,Fits small but overall I love the look of these.
4.0,"This jumpsuit is pretty true to size (I am 5'3, 125lbs) and it fits well and hits above my ankle."
4.0,"I wear glasses, the nose wire doesn't stop fogging of glasses, also you can return masks? Seems weird"
4.0,"Initial Impressions --<br /><br />This is my second Bellroy wallet, and I am enjoying it very much! The first was the Very Small Wallet in caramel colored leather, which I have been carrying with me on a daily basis.<br /><br />The Phone Pocket Plus holds my iPhone 6 in a Tech 21 case very nicely, along with cash, 8 cards, and my house key. I got it to take with me when I am not carrying anything else. I think it could also work well as a travel wallet -- the passport fits well inside.<br /><br />The black leather on this Phone Pocket Plus Wallet seems a little thicker than the caramel dyed leather on my Very Small Wallet. I don't know if that is because I have had my Very Small Wallet for some time, and it's just gotten softer with time. Another difference is that whereas the Very Small Wallet is lined with fabric, the Phone Pocket Plus is lined with another layer of leather. Also, the zipper on the Phone Pocket Plus has larger and sharper teeth than the zipper on the Very Small Wallet -- I can understand the choice of the larger zipper, as the Phone Pocket Plus is larger and holds more. However, I don't know whether it is necessary.<br /><br />I wanted to carry my iPhone inside my Phone Pocket Plus Wallet, with my earphones plugged in -- so that the zipper wasn't closed all the way. But I was concerned that the zipper teeth rubbing against the cord of my earphones may damage the cord. I would like to see Bellroy do differently is employe a zipper -- something altogether different, that doesn't have sharp teeth.<br /><br />Last thing about the zipper -- the zipper on the Phone Pocket Plus also wraps further around the wallet than on the Very Small Wallet -- this enables easier access to the contents.<br /><br />Overall, a very nice design!<br /><br />Follow up --<br /><br />I placed a Field Notes notebook inside the the Phone Pocket Plus, and it fit nicely. The Field Notes notebook is 3.5&#34; x 5.5&#34;, whereas a US Passport book is 3.5&#34; x 5&#34;. However, after I closed the zipper and reopened it, I had to struggle to have the Field Notes notebook's edge not get eaten by the zipper -- I guess Field Notes notebook had wiggled a little towards the opening. Something to be aware of if you're carrying something of similar width inside the Phone Pocket Plus.<br /><br />Also, I don't know how practical this is going to prove. I carried the Phone Pocket Plus today, in my front pocket as I would the Very Small Wallet and iPhone (though I'd have the Very Small Wallet in one pocket, and the iPhone in the other pocket). I locked the door as I left the house, and placed the house key inside the wallet. Then I realized that I forgot something, and had to open my wallet to get at the key -- it felt a bit cumbersome. Also, if I get an alert on my iPhone -- whether it's a phone call or a text message or whatever else, it takes more work to get at the iPhone inside of the wallet.<br /><br />I want to like the Phone Pocket Plus -- I just don't know how practical it will prove."
4.0,"There’s nothing particularly wrong with this bag. It’s a good size and will carry what I need. But I gave it four stars, because I chose the ink wash pattern and was sent a paisley pattern. I was going to return it, but I would rather not have to deal with ordering a new bag and possibly get the wrong color."
4.0,"I've ordered a jade bracelet before from an Amazon seller and wanted another. Unfortunately, they were all out and then I found this one. It's not quite as nice as the other one and it is much too small - I have average size hands and medium wrists, this won't even go all the way over - you'd have to have smalishl hands and wrists for it to fit."
4.0,Exactly like the Vera Bradley wristlet 1/4 of the cost.
4.0,These are perfect for wearing with your flats during the fall/winter seasons. Nice color for POC. It would been nice if they also came on a slightly light shade of brown for us with medium brown skin.
4.0,Just what I was looking for -- durable replacements for my worn out stock laces of my boots.  Have had them in daily use now for 6 months with no signs of wear.
4.0,"The suit is good, not high quality, but pretty much what i was looking for.  Unfortunately, i have to purchase a separate beard as the one in the set was very flimsy and see through."
4.0,Nice watch for the price. Thick camel hide strap. No lum so cannot see in low light.
4.0,"I love the support that this leotard gives! As an aerialist, I struggle to find leotards that hold everything in, even when I'm hanging upside down and dropping in the air. The Bratek leotard holds everything in, and the slight padding is great for people like me who need a little extra cushion to hide nipples that poke out. It is, however, much smaller than I was expecting. I felt like the lady in the weight loss commercials struggling to get her jeans on when I was trying to pull the leotard over my hips. I typically wear a size 4-6 jeans, I'm 5'2&#34;, 120 lbs, 34D, so I thought the Medium would be the best fit. Honestly, I can barely get the leotard on. But I won't return it for a larger size for fear that it will be too baggy in the butt, as many larger leotards tend to be. The leotard doesn't fit perfectly on my shoulders/armpits, but I am more muscular in that area. Overall, it was a great purchase, and I will probably buy another in the future."
4.0,"Belt fits great, the key holder works great. The only improvement I could see is tightening up the top band so the tubes/co2 doesn't bounce on top of the other ones. The padding for the back is nice as it provides a litttle support for those long days."
4.0,on the thin side which for summer wear is perfect.
4.0,"I got the LARGE size, and it covers my face well. However, it may just be a bit too large. Every time I put it on my face, it tends to touch the bottom of my eyes. The thickness is decent. Definitely protects well. I wish the material was a bit more breathable. I have to wear a mask for 9-10 hours a day at work. And at times I need to do some heavy lifting. So, at times I am struggling just trying to breathe. it's really difficult to find a mask that will meet all the consumer's needs/wants."
4.0,Bigger than what I'm used to but I really like them. It's really hard to find comfortable white sunglasses and nice pinky/golden lenses
4.0,These pants don’t fit like it pictured<br />The size is too tight. Not what I  had expected<br />Material not stretched like it says in description
4.0,"Dress was way too big for me but the cut of the dress is really cute and the material is nice and thick, not flimsy as I was expecting. I'm usually a 2X and I ordered a 4X in this dress just to be cautious, but i'm definitely regretting that decisions and wished i would have ordered a 2X instead. Will likely order in the future in my actual size."
4.0,This outfit is so cute! I just didn't expect for it to be so big! I guess I'll have to wait a while for her to wear it
4.0,Super cute.. my daughter says it's hot though and don't wear it much
4.0,Thought this would eliminate the fogging up of my glasses since it had a vent. It minimizes it.
4.0,Kind of cheap like but served its purpose!
4.0,"I carefully measured these prior to ordering because I have had another pair of Huggies which are gold plated.  My ears are reacting to them so I needed to get a pair in solid gold.  As you can see by the photos my old pair are exactly a 1/2"" drop but these do not measure close to that.<br /><br />They are a stunning pair of earrings. I haven't decided if I'll keep them yet.  But I can tell you the diamonds are clear, bright and have plenty of sparkle.  They are NOT cloudy or foggy."
4.0,Satisfied me.
4.0,Love having different lengths to choose from.
4.0,"Very nice fabric, And it’s washable!"
4.0,"This dress is cut really well!  It is very flattering on me!  It is still rather large on the midsection, but I am petite, 5'1&#34; and 115 pounds.  The shoulder area is also a little long.  BUT even with all these issues the dress still looks great on!  I am going to keep it and may buy the black and white!"
4.0,This suit is standing up to the chlorine pretty well so far.
4.0,I like the bags for traveling it was very helpful seeing what shoes were in each bag. I Also like that he bags were water proof.
4.0,I purchased this for a friend's 9 year old daughter's birthday party. She liked the bracelet and I purchased a necklace to go with it. The quality of the bracelet was good for it being a young girls jewelry item.
4.0,One of the links came broken..
4.0,The waist is a bit big and the embroidery is too much. The legs fit well.
4.0,A great piece for a sweater. It is a little bulky but that is what makes it interesting.
4.0,"Decent for steampunk cosplay, it's a bit more kinky looking because of the thicker straps and many silver loopholes, but I needed a red harness and didn't have many choices. I am 195, 5'5 with 43 in. bust. It fits me fine with room to spare. It would be nice if they put actual max measurements on these harnesses, but I was willing to take a chance. It works for what I need it for. I hope this helps."
4.0,I loved the design on the front of the tank and also the razor back. The only thing I disliked was the material of the shirt. It is not stretchy at all.
4.0,Nice selection and fun!
4.0,Love it only think I see is some is smaller but love it
4.0,"I love the color of the vest and the flowy, casual look. After 2 washes, part of a hem came out, and I was a bit disappointed with that."
4.0,These are the best undershirts for work. Nice little bit of compression from that stretchy material that makes me feel skinnier than I am. Long and tuckable so that no one can see crack when I bend down in my scrubs. Love!
4.0,"size, colors and adjustable straps are great for my 8 year old neice."
4.0,Color/design
4.0,these are so comfortable and stretch as I move. extra pockets a plus. but not crazy numbers of pockets.  just right for me..
4.0,kinda thin but soooooooooo cute love them
4.0,"nice quality,good service"
4.0,Got this for my granddaughters baby Minnie 1st birthday 💕 The fabric reminded me of a night shirt as opposed to an actual t shirt cotton. Kind of thin. It served the purpose.
4.0,I bought these in hopes they would fit my 11 year old son. He is not overweight but boys underwear do not work on him. These are excellent and very comfy for him and have gone great through the washer and dryer without fading or shrinking.
4.0,"This dress was a perfect wear.  Other dress is Comfortable, true to size,  nice material, no lining but not too thin, love the pockets, and the fact that you can dress it up or down.  It looks better on than on the picture and hanger."
4.0,I love this top; I wear it everywhere I go and I love their commitment to USA made products! . This was really a great purchase.
4.0,"I really like this camo jacket/hoodie. It took a long time to get to me (shipping was slow), but it was worth it in the end. It's a light coat, so perfect for this time of year (end of summer/beginning of fall). I definitely wouldn't wear it if the temperature ever dropped below 50--I'd be way too cold in this!<br /><br />I only have one significant complaint, and that's about the zipper. It's hard to zip up for some reason. I've only worn it a few times, and I've had the same issue every time. Sometimes things won't zip if they're too small, but that's not the case with this jacket, which is actually fairly blousy on me. It just gets... stuck. It takes some effort, but it does zip up.<br /><br />I personally wouldn't buy it again, but I will also continue to wear it because it's comfortable and I like the style."
4.0,I love it. It fits perfectly. But calling customer service is by far easier then email.
4.0,"Really love this wallet just the right size and awesome color the only problem I can see are the zippers, they get stuck and hard to close afraid I will break them if I use too much force."
4.0,Nice. It does have a small stitching issue behind one arm but it was so cheap and still fits so I kept it. Had I not needed it in a hurry... I would have exchanged it. Super cute.
4.0,The plastic edges sometimes scraps my face and when I exhale the plastic is though someone is putting a bag over your mouth. I have found though that if you fold in the top or bottom it doesn’t do that. I like the fact that people can see me talk.
4.0,I wear usually a small in tshirts and decided to get a size up (M) and it fit really good. It somewhat covers a little of my belly button if your looking for a little coverage.
4.0,Very sturdy and it should last a very long time.  The process was smooth and it came quick.
4.0,"This wasn't what I expected. I need to start blowing the Amazon images up more to see properly. I thought these were like retro overalls and I could wear a tee or a nice shirt under them. Um, no. First of all, they are overly long like most pants seem to be. Second of all, they're cute if that's what you want. They're more bohemian. My friend aboslutely loves them. They are a lightweight wrinkled/crinkled material and the bust is ruched, elasticy and will fit a variety. It has tie straps which I'm not a fan of. But again, my friend loves it. I didn't. It is more her style. The cool thing about it is that the top being the way it is, it will fit just about any bust size. It's a terrific summer pants outfit. You'll stay cool."
4.0,Good bib for people who are messy when they eat.
4.0,"Seemed way bigger than I expected, but the quality is really good and it is my new favorite. It's lined and looks really good on."
4.0,Pendant is great but the chain is not.
4.0,I bought this choker to wear with a zombie bride costume. The photo makes it look shiny but it is more of a matte black. It looked great with the costume and my only complaint was that it was a little large for my small neck but that was easily fixed with some tucking and adjustments.
4.0,"The ONLY thing that didn't work well for me was the strength of the reader area. lol I guess my reading sight is getting worse each year.  The glasses fit well, looked nice and worked as they are designed. They are high quality.  Glorious.  Thank you!"
4.0,Ran a bit smaller than I thought.
4.0,"I guess I didn't realize I was getting three pairs. It was a pleasant surprise. I gave one  pair to my daughter, and they look nice on her too. They came in a timely manner."
4.0,It is thin material but it worked for<br />What I needed it for.
4.0,Used for a dead cat costume.
4.0,Look nice.  Terrific service from the company.
4.0,The Jean's fit perfect
4.0,"These are a little small for my hands. I can wear them, but are a little more snug than I prefer. Though the gloves themselves are very nice. I definitely will keep them, just wish they were not quite so snug. over all I like them very much."
4.0,I followed the advice to go up a size. Usually I am an XL but I went to 2XL and it fits perfectly! I needed a casual top to go with my jeans for a shower and this was perfect! I will definitely be wearing this too for work as well. The material is very soft and form fitting. I highly recommend this top.
4.0,"But the description calls the dress ""form fitting"" ... C'mon! The picture shows that it isn't.  It is, however, quality fabric, fully lined and the colors are exactly as shown and I can't wait to wear it on date night."
4.0,"I ordered a size bigger just in case and I am glad that I did. This swimsuit does not stretch as much as I would like and does not have much boobie support. However, the bathing suit is super cute and I can not wait to lay on the beach and become a mermaid."
4.0,Cute and work well with my larger calves.
4.0,These boots are real nice looking. They aren't leather but it does state that in description but still look great. The sizing is not accurate. I order 8 should have order 9. These are beautiful Boots. Great price. I returned and got full refund quickly..
4.0,My wife and I have a little running joke that we see pineapples everywhere and by everywhere we mean EVERYWHERE (you'll start to notice now too).  She got these for me as a gift and we got a laugh out of it.  The socks are remarkably comfortable and fit just as expected.  The material feels like it will last for a reasonable amount of time versus a &#34;novelty&#34; sock that gets a hole after only a couple wears.  Overall I think these are a good product.  If and when I need another pair of pineapple socks I'll return for another pair.
4.0,I wish they came in my size.
4.0,I bought 2 of these for matching pictures but the red was off and the sizing was off. I had to return the large bacausenit was huge!
4.0,I found the gloves to be tight in the finger area however my fingers are long so that may be the problem. Not sure.  I’ll have a better idea once I ride with them.
4.0,Love the amount of room and pockets
4.0,My son absolutely loves this as his current obsession is Pokémon and the print is very fun. It is a nylon material so its more of a wear around the house hoodie not so much for warmth.
4.0,"Super soft and comfy. I like it a lot. Fits as expected. I basically live in it. I’m going to buy more colors, lol. Only downside is some of the threading came out along the bottom hem but caused no damage so I’m not even mad"
4.0,It isn't smooth under tighter fitting shirts but it works great under other garments
4.0,"These earrings are beautiful and the perfect length for me. But as some reviewers said they do not lie flat. They curl up a bit. For this reason I may return them. I really love them, so wish they were made better."
4.0,"This is a nice very lightweight jogging top. It does have a mesh cutout on the backside. It is quite thin and I wash it on gentle cycle and hang dry so as not to rip. It fits snug but is long enough. If you are I between I would go up a size. I usually am a medium and it fit just perfect, but really on the edge. For the low price it looks really nice and has held up."
4.0,Just as pictured and a great buy.
4.0,Great hat for the price! It is lined with fleece so it is extra warm- perfect for the especially cold weather we've had here lately.  The faux fur pom is really cute.
4.0,Vacaciones
4.0,"These sunglasses and the case they come in look sharp! They not only look expensive but feel and appear to be quality made. I've had designer-brand aviator sunglasses that did not feel as sturdy as these. They are statement sunglasses and oversized and you will stand out when wearing them. I just wish they weren't quite so oversized, although I like oversized glasses, these seem to sit a little far from my face and appear a bit larger than others I've had. The lens has a mirrored effect and they are very shiny and pretty! I just wish that they sat closer to my face and were a little smaller. Overall, the sunglasses and case feel and look like a good value for the price!"
4.0,"Really CUTE Leotard, but runs a little small! My daughter is 6yrs old got her a 6 but it was small. She is also nothing but legs, so I needed to up size."
4.0,"Very nice ring. Size is a little small, but not too bad."
4.0,Good quality for the price. A couple of sections on the sash where the hem was separating. But was planning on replacing those anyway. Worked well for what I needed.
4.0,Really cute!  I wear a size 14 and ordered the large.  The colors are very vibrant!
4.0,I’m a size small and this shirt is like a size too big on me. I have to tuck it into my pants or tie it off with a hair elastic for it to fit right. Love the shirt so I kept it but otherwise would’ve returned it
4.0,I like it. It came wrinkled but no fret. Shipping was on point.
4.0,This is a cute watch band but the tassel did come apart and fall off after just a few days.  But I would buy it again anyway.
4.0,Love this dress!  Amazon by fit!!!  So excited to wear it!
4.0,"Nice product, good fabric but I wear a 2 x and purchased a 3 x  and it was too small."
4.0,"Solid workmanship and great price. Normally for this price, the tie is stubby. This is a long and thin bow"
4.0,Ordered a medium and it fit like a large. The dress itself was beautiful.
4.0,This coat is pretty nice and fits well but it would perfect if the hood was detachable.  It's kinda bulky and fits oddly around your neck if you aren't using the hood. Just my opinion.
4.0,"The bracelet is super cute, same as the picture. I was excited for this braclet as it has a clasp in the back and not a &#34;claw&#34; type. The only down side to that is the corner's are a bit &#34;sharp&#34; and irritate my wrist a little. Otherwise this product is exactly as described and seller was great to deal with."
4.0,These boots are so comfy. Doesn't even feel like boots. I'll be sure to continue wearing these boots my whole career in the military. Than you Amazon.
4.0,Much bigger than I thought it would be. Very pretty
4.0,"Not sure what the complaints are about - super cute.  The lenses are colored plastic so of course are distorted, but they're a fun party favor."
4.0,"I love this watch. What I love most about this watch is the compact light-weight feel of it. It is simple to use and has decent functions. I use this watch for everyday use, including hiking/camping.<br /><br />When I use it for everyday life here in Southern California, it does exactly what I want it to do; tell me time. Not much more you can ask for.<br /><br />When I take it hiking/camping, I notice some problems. First is that the light button sucks. It is located poorly on the top left corner and the light it gives off is pretty crappy. I can read the time, but it could display the time better. Also the light only stays on while pushing on the button; I'd prefer the watch to light up for a few sec after pushing the button once. The second problem is that there is condensation within the screen in hot or cold weather. Idk what it is exactly, but a somewhat thick layer of water solidifies under the screen in certain temperatures and conditions. Reading the time because very difficult when this occurs. The screen eventually clears up and looks good again when conditions get better, but it shouldn't happen at all. I wonder about the water-resistance capabilities of this watch. I'm afraid to even shower with it on. It gets an A for scratch-resistance however. I've brushed against trees, bushes, etc and the screen still looks great.<br /><br />Overall it's a great introductory watch for a low price of 11$. It has been very useful to me and I'm glad I bought it. If this watch was 15$+ though, I don't think I would buy it again; for 10$ I would. I will however be upgrading to a more expensive watch next time for a truly water-tight seal (very important to me because I go to lakes, rivers, and streams a lot)."
4.0,"Very cute. Seem to be a little big though. We will keep them for sure though, my son really likes them."
4.0,"I used for a photoshoot and it really helped me out, if you want a cool outfit and doesn't want to spend in expensive glasses these will help you out."
4.0,This dress fit very nice
4.0,Smelt a little funky when I got it. But it's still very cute!
4.0,"I like the piece. Not an adjustable band. I have small wrists (so I admittedly took this chance - it IS a &#34;unisex&#34; band) so it's a little loose which is okay, but with this style clasp closure, I'm not confident it won't simply unclasp on its own & fall off if I'm not careful. But nice, simple, flattering, genuine leather... so for the price I'm okay with it."
4.0,My grandchildren are happy. I expected better quality but for the price I can't complain. It's nice to be able to find dresses like these that the girls can dress up in.
4.0,"I Bought this for my 11 year old daughter. She really likes it. It is a little small on her though, so I can't imagine it fitting on a grown woman."
4.0,"I like the quality of this coat and the warmth.  I thought the color would be more on the green side and it should be labeled dark brown.  It is a very dark brown, almost black.  It fits pretty loose in the torso."
4.0,The pockets would be better if they went diagonal instead of straight across
4.0,Not very durable but for the price its a good buy
4.0,"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! My daughter LOVES it. It is a bit short though. I wouldn't have bought it had I known it was going to be this short. But, as long as my girl loves it, that is all that matters."
4.0,"A little smaller than I expected, but does keep my clothes from getting wet."
4.0,Nice light weight no lace shoes... the length (toe to heel) is good but they are a little roomy as far as the fit around the foot itself. Since they are bungee laces and can't be tightened they are kind of loose fitting. But my kid lives in them and loves them- easy on and off great deal for the price.
4.0,"Was breathable, most important, very stylish, got nice compliments, price was ok, easy to wash- dry flat, will ordering more"
4.0,These are pretty and good quality.  I wear them for &#34;everyday&#34;
4.0,"I love the idea of these shorts, but they are low-rise, so unless you're at a nude beach, plan on wearing a pair of swim bottoms underneath."
4.0,The shirts are way too small but look nice
4.0,I bought these without proper research so I didn't know they weren't real. They're pretty convincing and they look really nice on me.
4.0,Shirt fits as expected. Quality of shirt is OK but the design is holding up well after multiple washes.
4.0,Product fits well and they are comfy however the spelled design is really dumb
4.0,So I’m only giving these shorts a 4 star because they’re are somewhat see through when squatting. I was so excited to wear these to the gym but after doing some squats at home I found they are not fully squat proof but they still make my butt look AMAZING. People were definitely staring so I’ll be keep them but just for day use and not at the gym. I ordered the lighter green shorts and just ordered a blue pair so we’ll see if they blue pair is more squat proof! I got an XS and it fit perfect. I’m 5’8 126 pounds and slim/athletic build for size reference :)
4.0,"Looks and feels pretty good, the lattice is done with what looks like hot glue and the painting of it is pretty messy.  Other than that, looks really god, got a lot of compliments.  Comes in a nice ""frosted"" plastic bag with a ziploc.  Only issue is that it it narrower than it should be and doesn't quite fit perfectly on the face"
4.0,The dress is beautiful.. will be wearing it again.. it runs somewhat larger on the breast area.. i wear a 36 D and got a M im 5’2” 160lbs
4.0,The bags are good size and seem sturdy but the &#34;built-in pouch&#34; in the name is confusing. The pouch is separate from the bag; I was hoping it was truly built in and the bags would fold into themlseves like some of the ones I've had in the past.
4.0,I was sent the wrong color shoes.these are blue and gold. But I was sent baby blue and silver ones. I would complain and send it back but I love the color. I accept it. eventhough they didn't send me the right shoe.I'm satisfied. my nephew loves it. Great great quality and love the suede on the inside.
4.0,Love this dress for my daughter!
4.0,"These are surprisingly sturdy. Thick C clip, however not bulky. Great if you have many keys to carry around on you. I purchased them for myself and the restaurant owner I managed for. Made easy accessibility when I needed to go through opening and closing the facility.<br />The 2 finishes are nice. They can make your keys well organized and not gaudy. C clip is not too big nor too small for proper use. Would look great as a purse accessory, keys for kids to attach to their backpacks."
4.0,Cute.  I am 5'7 125. It was a bit short and material too thin for work.
4.0,its a beautiful watch! just a bit smaller than i expected. my mistake for not checking product descriptions
4.0,"I was buying this as a gift for my granddaughter.  I wish you had this item in gold. That would have been my preference.<br /><br />A lot of confusion with the delivery which caused me some concern. The expected time changed  repeatedly.<br />I could not give the necklace in time for her birthday which is unfortunate, so I had to buy another present for her in the interim.<br /><br />I would consider using this company again but I would need to start my planning much, much earlier.<br />Thank you for your time.<br />Good Day"
4.0,I love the adjustable band
4.0,Arm length in 2x model sized were made for a 6ft 5 inch person. I am only 6ft. And Han to have armed tailored to fit properly.
4.0,"i think these look so retro classy cool.  i absolutely love the look of them with the super classic black and white clean lines.  the polarized lenses are great and help create a great view, while protecting your eyes.  i can only wear these for a short while though, and ensure that i carry a big enough purse to put them in while i out.  they are a little tight for me behind the ears and after awhile the pressing gives me a little bit of a headache, so i limit their wear time.  i am unable to push them up on my head though because of this fact.  so i just throw them in my bag.  they come with a GREAT case - super sturdy and protective, and a nice add, especially at the price point."
4.0,My son enjoy wearing it!
4.0,I loved this when I first got it.  It did shrink a bit after washed.  But the colors did not run - which was something I worried about.  But a good quality dress for the price.  Very pretty and lots of compliments.
4.0,I'm going to be wearing these all day at home for a week to break them in. Order a size up.<br /><br />EDIT: I Just relieved the side 10 and they fit perfectly!
4.0,"Very comfortable, but it’s medium impact at best."
4.0,"The shirt runs super small. It's a really cute and comfortable shirt, but it is a snug fit."
4.0,"Very thin layered,  should be more sturdy,  only a shell"
4.0,"Fits great,wish I could have a different color but really like the shirt."
4.0,I do like the necklace but I guess I didn't read the description close enough. The chain is too long.
4.0,Very billowy. It was slightly bigger than expected. Bought this for a costume and ended up returning it because I didn't love it. The product was as described.
4.0,"Bought it for my husband , he likes them says the are much better than what he had."
4.0,The pants run long and when I washed it the shirts white elephant started to fade right away. Otherwise it's a cute outfit
4.0,very good quality but runs a little small!!
4.0,"Adam Rhea<br />Mon 10:35 PM<br /><br />Adam sent Yesterday at 10:35 PM<br />You sent Yesterday at 10:36 PM<br />Nice<br />11:11 AM<br /><br />Adam sent Today at 11:11 AM<br />1:07 PM<br />You sent Today at 1:07 PM<br />First day on the job Is going well<br /><br />These look very cool at night!  The designs on the lenses sort of look like targeting info that Ironman would see in his face shield or something.  Perfect for a rave or a dance concert that people wear cool costumes to.  I like that you can choose your color, or solid on, or blinky.  Maybe the only thing to think about is that you can see well in them when the ambient lights are up, or when the glasses are turned off, but in a dim setting with the glasses turned on the glasses shield will be the brightest thing in front of your eyes and you will see your own glasses very well, but not the stuff around you very much."
4.0,These are great! Very pretty!
4.0,Super cute! Love how it looks on... just runs a little short.
4.0,I added this watchband to my Swiss Army watch and the look is amazing.  I have received many compliments on the watch from family and friends over the last two weeks after I replaced my band.  I love the feel of the band material and the stitching along the edges is a plus.
4.0,Nice watch. Perfect for a summer day. Negative 1 Star because it feels a little light.
4.0,They ride up a bit over the corse of a day
4.0,I got this for my wife.  She likes the way it fits and said it's a comfortable shirt.
4.0,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my oldest son. He is just starting to get in to music (just turned 11) and I thought this would be a neat beanie for him to wear during our cold Chicago winter months.<br /><br />So far he loves the beanie. I haven't personally tried it out yet, but he said the music sounds great and the beanie itself is very comfortable. The only reason I took a star off was because one of the section of stitching wasn't as neat as it could have been, but otherwise it's a great product."
4.0,These headbands are really good quality. It is a little big for my head but pins will help keep it in place.
4.0,Cute but needed a little repare with a link.
4.0,"I don't like that it is a quick release,  but it works."
4.0,"This is perfect for a movie, or dinner date, etc.  It fits small items like lip glass, credit cards/cash, cell phone and keys. It comes with a over the shoulder strap to make it easier for carrying. It is pretty small and the zipper gets stuck sometimes, so that is why it doesn't get a 5 star from me.  Overall though, good bag, especially for the price."
4.0,Works good so far and the price is not bad at all .
4.0,"comfortable for all day wear,  but almost no arch support."
4.0,"I love Primigi shoes, they are well made and beautiful and I love that Amazon usually offers the shoes at really good prices.<br />However, make sure that you know your childs size when ordering, even if you know your childs size in Euro sizes, which I do, Primigi shoes usually run differently.<br />These are going back."
4.0,"The Laser Finger Lights are an absolute hit with the kids.  I don't know a single kid that resist these lights. Yes, some will not work and yes, some will not work for a long time but the majority will and that's the fun."
4.0,It is well made and piping finishes the seams nicely. The zipper seems sturdy and the opening for the hanger is nicely reinforced. The only concern I have it material use for the front and back seems to be a kind of paper. Others I have bought the paper dried up began to crumble. We will have to see how these will hold up. I do like the extra length.
4.0,The glasses have scratches
4.0,"The wig was actually very well made!! The horns stayed on pretty nicely, amd there really wasnt anything wrong with it except for the bangs, all of the hair was moved off to one side, but it was nothing a few hair pins couldnt fix. It did get tangled VERY easily, resulting in having to cut it down by a lot. Overall, its a good wig, just a bit difficult to manage."
4.0,"Grandson, age 9, very happy with this."
4.0,"Some reviews said it ran small, others said only small around the waste, but the length was good.  I love mine, but it was shorter than I expected.  I'm 5'3&quot; 110lbs, and I ordered a large thinking that it would be longer than I needed.  As it turns out, it comes just above the floor with no shoes on. Glad I read the reviews and went with large!"
4.0,This is more like a nightie than a slip but that’s why I bought it. Pretty and comfy.
4.0,This is very nice. Didn't know the stones were made out of plastic but that's all that is wrong here. It's a very nice necklace but haven't worn it yet. Hope it doesn't turn black any time soon tho
4.0,"it lists the fabric content as being 95% cotton and that it has no stretch but its actually very stretchy - it feels nice like something that would wear well in a hot climate, ie. not look sweaty and stretched out. Unfortunately my bust is too big for the largest size or I would have kept it, my waist is 34in but my bust is 42in and the button closure couldn't lay flat. You could put a pin to hold it but that always ends up ripping eventually."
4.0,"Very nice dress,  Top part of dress is too small.  But gonna use a tank top."
4.0,Good masks but always looks wrinkled
4.0,This top is very comfortable and not clingy. I like that it’s a bit longer but yet not as long as a tunic. I bought the purple and mint green. I did have an issue in that the first purple one had a hole but it was quickly replaced. The only reason I gave four stars is because the hole made me question the quality of the material.
4.0,"Other than fitting just slightly loose, these are very comfortable."
4.0,"Bought for myself, a medium sized female. Much preferred to dinky polyester women's panties. Covered seams, no tags, all cotton except gray pair."
4.0,Great looking watch. It seems to be running a little bit fast.
4.0,It is very comfortable and worth of money.
4.0,"This was a great buy! The charm was beautifully crafted and also well packaged! I saw no difference between a charm from NinaQueen from a Pandora, except in price. I thought it was going to be a bigger charm, but my friend loved it and was very happy :)"
4.0,Well made.  A little expensive but came in  nice box.  I purchased a bracelet also which came in a ziplock bag.
4.0,"I order the 2 pack. One pair fit absolutely perfect, the other, which is the same size are tight. Not sure why. But I will deal."
4.0,I love the way it look. I loved the design.
4.0,i really like this.. the straps are super secure.. no sliding down the legs.. only thing is it didn’t really cover my lower abdomen mostly just the upper.. i use a longer one underneath to cover the parts this one doesn’t.. still like and will continue using.
4.0,Fits as advertised. So cute.
4.0,"Good assortment, Fits well though the silicone was a little thin for my liking. I wear them daily so.... ☆☆☆☆"
4.0,Comfortable pretty not right fit for me runs large
4.0,"Love this shirt, awesome for summer"
4.0,Really pretty.  Flattering but snug.
4.0,"My child absolutely loves it. The material is not very thick, which I do not mind. My child is small so some elastic at the bottom of the legs would be nice. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is because the material is very thin and doesn't look like its 'quality' made. But it's exactly what my child wanted."
4.0,It's a great item.. just not for the women with small hips
4.0,Wish they were a little longer - but light and comfortable to wear.
4.0,Don’t like the fabric.  Feels like spandex.
4.0,"I think they are pretty, but they are little big for my ears. They are slightly uncomfortable to wear but otherwise very pretty. The stones were barely set in their place right so a little cheaply made. Otherwise, I like them."
4.0,Looks good but my baby didn't like it for some reason
4.0,"Definitely doesn't breath in the Texas heat, but it did the job."
4.0,Cute but if you have small boobs just know it runs big im constantly pulling at it to stay up but its how im built the top itself is cute
4.0,I like these socks for their support--my legs are pain-free at the end of the day again! I am almost 9 months pregnant and I have noticed a positive difference since wearing these socks. Just the right amount of compression while still being easy to get on and off. The only reason I marked them 4 stars is that there is an unpleasant smell to the socks by the end of the day--probably because of the material. Overall great buy!
4.0,"Fits very well, spandex is a little thin and waist is just a little tight but nothing unreasonable,  overall comfortable and useful pocket as well"
4.0,Great variety.  Smaller than I  expected.
4.0,work as intended
4.0,"Great for the price, came waaayyyy early, but like most products, I have to do some adjustments to fit my Small frame. No biggie!"
4.0,"The dress was really nice. I loved it a lot. I wore it for graduation. It's a good length, however, there is a weird chest flap underneath the dress that likes to sneak out if you aren't careful. I had mine pined down so it wouldn't show for pictures. The length of the dress went right in between my thigh (the perfect length for me personally). I bought an XS. For reference, I'm 120 pounds and 5'8""."
4.0,"This shoe dryer works very well. You can change heat level and set the timer based on your needs. It even dispenses ozone as it's drying to eliminate odor in the shoes. The biggest downside is that when the ozone is on, it is very loud. It creates a loud clicking noise and this sound continues throughout the entirety of the set timer. I also found that when using the ozone feature, it did not remove the odor on some of my older shoes. It took a few sessions but it worked nonetheless."
4.0,These are great. I purchased them to keep my legs and feet warm during yoga. They have worked great in the winter but will be to heavy for summer and spring. I had planned to wear them with shorts but they will be to itchy on my bare legs. They are very heavy and have a wool sweater feel. I can tell from how they feel they will eventually get stretched out but for the price I can't really complain. I was happy that they are as long as shown in the picture. Maybe even a little to long. I am tall so that was nice.
4.0,"Fits exactly if you have a close look to the size chart. The only bottom part is a little short, but I'm fine with that since I would wear anyways a skirt on top of it. I ordered a small, I am 5.1&#34;, 127 lbs, rather petite."
4.0,"These have a neat pattern on them and are adjustable.  You will have to spread the two ends apart to adjust the size, doesn’t take a ton of pressure.  The band is a bit thick for some toes to sit comfortably on, particularly in shoes but do okay with sandals.  Cute aged brass look with nice patterns,  I wear them often as pinky rings, look super cute.  Haven’t left tarnish (green) marks."
4.0,The color didn't fit my expectations. Was too light.
4.0,"This coat is EVERYTHING! It looks great and is well made and fit well too. I got an XL, and it's a tad loose, which is just fine. The only reason I can't give it a 5 is because the material sheds so easily, but it's a wool coat, so one would expect that. I had hoped the weave pattern would make that harder to occur, but it does not. The sheddings tend to get loose threads caught on things very easily. Other than that, I love it. It makes such a fashion statement that I almost bought it in a different color too!"
4.0,The print was beautiful! And it fit just right. I should’ve read the material type though. Because I expected it to be a sweatshirt and it was polyester and thin.
4.0,"Hurts my arm, and keeps scratching it. Besides that it looks just like the picture."
4.0,"This was a pretty great costume - we got a lot of compliments about it.  One reviewer had a great tip about stretching the mask over a basketball and using a hair dryer to get the folds out (they are BAD folds too, you will not want to unwrap & wear).  We couldn't quite get that to work but we accomplished the same result by stuffing the mask with a small blanket to fill it completely and use the hairdryer.  Took about 20 min.<br /><br />Also, the dickie it comes with is pathetic - really cheap and way too scarce on the fabric - kept sticking up in the back.  So, what I found in our house that worked the best was a white Champion workout shirt.  It matched the material the closest and looked the best.  It isn't a t-shirt, it's the more shiny material - stretchy but keeps its form.  Also much warmer!<br /><br />The costume is only the mask, tie, shirt and vest, so don't forget to make sure you have black pants/shoes/etc.  The gloves do not come with it.<br /><br />I went as Sally, and I actually did not care as much for the licensed Sally.  The red yarn wig was more Raggitty Anne than Sally, but the dress and rest of it rocked."
4.0,"I love this dress, I wore it to a wedding. I ordered a size up because my body type is more towards the thick side, I should’ve ordered my normal size which is 12/14. I’m 5’8 and a half and the dress was touching the ground even in heels. Definitely a great buy."
4.0,"I really love this dress. It just looks nice on me and honestly I like how light it is.<br />That being said, it is very thin and light. Doesn't feel very robust."
4.0,"Received in good condition, just as pictured."
4.0,"I like the fabric of this sweatshirt and the overall feel. I do wish it had thumb holes - the cuffs are super long and it would be a perfect candidate and make the look of the whole thing a little more sporty!<br />It fits me well, but they are not joking when they say it is cropped length. It's definitely cut short, so you need a long tee or tank underneath it unless you like to show off your whole butt when you wear leggings (which I don't!). It will be a nice piece to throw on to take my kids for a walk in the stroller when the weather gets colder."
4.0,Perfect small umbrella. the auto close and open feature is really nice entering and exiting buildings. Fits perfectly in my bag. I am a little afraid the wind might blow too hard and rip it a little bit but hasn't happened yet.
4.0,Neck is not so wide which makes it difficult to put on and take<br />Off .
4.0,I like it thank you
4.0,"I misread and thought this was 2 cups not 1 with logos on each side.  Other than my mistake, great design and good quality cup."
4.0,IM 200 LBS AND AND 5'2 AND THE DRESS FITS JUST RIGHT. IT IS A LITTLE TIGHT ON THE ARMS JUST SLIGHTLY BUT ITS FINE WITH ME.
4.0,Super soft material but was too short in length for my taste.
4.0,"These are really nice Jogger-styled Tights in a substantial but not heavily knit Merino wool. They are smooth and soft. I purchase them in Black Medium as my usual size is an 8. Unfortunately, they were higher on the waist and cut too snug for comfort, for me and I returned. If you have a tiny waist, go for your regular size. Otherwise, size up! I would have tried them again in a Large Black but, sadly, none were left in stock. These are kind of like the Icebreaker version but slimmer cut."
4.0,Satisfactory for the price
4.0,I bought these for my two week long Europe trip. I had five flights all of which I had to check one of my bags. The strap really helped me identify my black hard shell suitcase in baggage claim. The only gripe is the strap loosens itself pretty easily.
4.0,"I purchases these for my brother as a Christmas present.  I really like them (and I hope he does, too)."
4.0,Overall LOVE. It looks great ok me- but definitely runs small- ordered a large and while it fits its tight.
4.0,Decent gift for a friend of mine who likes HP. Simple gift but it made her happy. I needed something inexpensive and this wasn't a piece of junk. Glad to have bought it.
4.0,"The product is strong, the colors are nice, I only have one hangup: the inset of the star cutout. The molding process, I guess, leaves a small film in the center of the star tunnel which is very difficult to attempt to remove by hand. Otherwise, for the sale price, it was a great deal."
4.0,"Perfect for under a vest, does tend to ride up with very minimal movement so I wasn't a fan of working out in them."
4.0,runs smaller then expected
4.0,SO CUTE! I wear a M/L and ordered an XL and it fit beautifully. I purchased the black suit with the horizontal cutouts on the side seams.
4.0,"beautiful product, band a bit big for slender female wrist.  Needs more holes."
4.0,very comfortable and worked perfectly for clinicals
4.0,"I finally got my bracelets, a couple days f weeks later than expected. I just got them today, I have not worn them yet, but they are soo beautiful and the metal looks and it’s stamped 925. I hope they stay silver. This is a good review. Only four stars because of long time waiting for them, but worth it!!!"
4.0,"Not much to say, simple and expressive, could have been a bit larger, but overall I'm satisfied."
4.0,We'll see how it holds up.
4.0,Good product for the money spent
4.0,"Good quality shirt, but order a minimum of one, two if you wear it loose, sizes bigger than you normally wear."
4.0,"I will give it four stars because I like to wear it so much, but I don't know if I will ever trust to wash it with other items. After washing and wearing it the first time, I was cleaning my face and neck with a skin toner and cotton ball. When I cleaned my neck I noticed the cotton ball turning red, and quickly deduced it was from the dye in the sweatshirt. I soaked the sweatshirt in vinegar and salt water, then washed it, and still found dye on my neck. I hope this stops eventually!<br />Yes, it is somewhat large; I ordered a Medium and I am 5'8 and 165 lbs."
4.0,"i really like it, i fit snug and well on your arm"
4.0,"Fit as expected but too tall, about 3 inches .too long. I am 5 ft 6 inches and have to get it cut, but otherwise it is very lovely."
4.0,Perfect a little bigger than expected but very nice
4.0,"This is a cute set to grab for a cheap cost, thin material i would order size up, my daughter is a true 2T and had to return and reorder for 3T"
4.0,"Easy to wear, comfortable and able to add a breast prothesis in the pocket. Love it!"
4.0,Like it. Not as solid as I thought being made from silver the earrings are easy to bend.
4.0,Arrived on time and the quality is very good!
4.0,"This sweater is almost perfect!  The sleeves bulge out a little bit where they're sewn to the body of the sweater. I wanted to wash it and make sure the problem didn't resolve before I left a review, but it's not going away no matter what I do.  It's just a construction issue.  I can still wear it but it feels kind of weird.  I love the length and the fabric. If this issue was fixed I would buy every single color."
4.0,"It is a very good wallet, light and thin, and it is earth friendly.  One thing, i wish there could be 1-2 more place for cards."
4.0,Bought these for my boyfriend who is an avid runner / outdoorsman. He says he LOVES them for running and late night yard work when the sun goes down. The only thing that throws him a bit is that the plastic on the clips feels a bit flimsy to him so he's worried they may not last. Personally... I'm not that worried about it. Great buy !
4.0,"Super cute. Good support for large breasts. Looks great. I only gave it 4 stars because the bottoms run small, I have to find an alternative bottom. Top is just too cute to sent back."
4.0,"The scorpion, acrylic molding quality, knot quality are all very nice<br />The only complaint i have would be is that its hard to adjust the bracelet tightly, since you need two hands to properly tighten the knot, and it slowly loosens over the course of wearing it<br />If you know anything about knots, you might be able to fix this, but i am not a knot person"
4.0,"This is a bold and attention-grabbing ring. For the price, the amount of detail is truly excellent and exceeds expectations. I usually wear a size 9 on my middle finger, and I found this ring to be ever-so-slightly loose-fitting, compared to other rings that I own, of the same material and similar style. However, the problem isn't severe enough to make me want to return the ring or change sizes. I will probably just use a bit of wax or something to ensure a snug fit.  Altogether, a beautiful, impressive ring.  Subtly Goth-ish without being covered in skulls and spiders."
4.0,"It was baggy and not form flattering, but still worked well as a layer. Very soft material."
4.0,You have to fuss with it sometimes to get them to fit on your eyeglasses. I do like the adjustable nose piece.<br />The polarized lens are perfect for filtering out sunlight.
4.0,These are super comfortable. The fabric is really light weight and silky. My only complaint is that the waist is really high rise. It goes up past my belly button
4.0,Good robe!
4.0,"Only giving this dress 4 stars because it's not the material I expected. It's more of a costume material, but the dress fits great and looks very sexy."
4.0,My son loves this belt and we plan to buy another one in black
4.0,"Doesn't fit like picture, its cute though."
4.0,Good shoe for jeans or skirt
4.0,Good product for what I had in mind. Plenty of hair. I was having trouble getting the fabric ears to stand up.
4.0,pretty as always qiyun is the best
4.0,This case works for people who have to travel with contact lens and eye glasses!  I wear RGP and sometimes I have to take them out for various reasons and resort to my glasses.  This is an excellent product except for 1 thing: the lens case and the slot to hold the case is shaped with a curve making it impossible to use a standard size lens case holder.
4.0,"I like these, but they are a bit longer than I expected. They go up to my neck in the back. I would prefer that bit was down on my back a little."
4.0,I love the bracelet it's just too big for my wrist. I have very small wrists but it is very pretty
4.0,Had hoped for a lighter green color. great leather bill.
4.0,very nice look for occassions
4.0,I like the way it fits &amp; looks! I have received many compliments of the color.
4.0,Looks great and wears well! It is breathable and semi-flowy.
4.0,Love the shirt. Always order it two sizes bigger. The fit is weird. Worst case scenereo a talor can bring it in a little bit of it's too small you're out of luck. Love it though.
4.0,Nice thin hoodie runs a little small .size up
4.0,"I am a bigger girl, round 220 lb, 44 DD bust. I ordered the xl. The fit is snug, but not too tight for my preference.  I prefer clothing the fits close to the body, not too tight or baggy. Might as well show curves off with class versus trying to hide the obvious fact that I am a bigger human being.  I really like the shirt. It is made from a jersey material.  Not super thin feeling softy material, but not rough like an athletic standard tee. The ruffles have both the shirt material as well as tulle mixed in with no edge seam.  All of my stitching and seams are straight and well done. There are a few buttons that seem a bit lose, but that is a quick fix. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.  For the price, it is a nice shirt.  It is a bit victorian/gothic.....so if that is not your style you probably won't enjoy this item."
4.0,"I sized up because I read a few reviews that stated it ran small. I had to return because it ended up being too big. So in my opinion, they run true to size. Fabric wasn't super thick but it was a good value for the price."
4.0,"Item was returned, wrong size"
4.0,"With the cold weather here in New York, I've been looking for some nice warm socks for my son.  I found these and they're great.  They keep my 3 year Olds feet warm through out the day.  They have thickness for warmth which makes me happy and they have cute pictures which make my son happy."
4.0,"I received my watch on time, and it was securely packaged. No presentation box, or instructions, though. But, and most importantly, I was sent a &#34;lefty&#34; configured watch. Not what was advertised. However, because I got a discounted price, and because Chinese vendors are impossible to deal with, I kept the watch.<br />That said, it is a very nice piece. Anyone familiar with the Graham line of Swiss watches will realize that this piece is a relative bargain. Great fit and finish. And the movement is complicated, with a hacking ability, and a nice sweep if the seconds hand. Decent strap, which I have already swapped.<br />I just wish it was a &#34;righty&#34;."
4.0,Perfect for office or weekend event
4.0,"I really like this set of rings. I usually pay double the price for just one ring. I was skeptical but I took my chance. I have always had a hard time with belly rings. My body would always reject them or have an allergic reaction even with materials like surgical steel. Most rings would also be way too heavy and dense that they would just look like they were tugging down on my piercing and kind of sagging. So I've experimented with many many rings trying to avoid these issues. I mainly have had to settle for tiny plain and boring rings. This set however, despite being dangly do not tug or sag my skin. Crazy! And even being dangly they are so classy looking. They are gorgeous in a sense they seem like high quality jewelry. However over time they do lose the rose gold outer plate. Mine started fading at 6 months and is a faded rose gold/ silver color. I wish they wouldn't fade because they are so gorgeous and perfect. I would probably still repurchase though!"
4.0,"When bathing suit is wet, it holds tight to you and is uncomfortable. Not a big deal, but I use as a tanning suit instead of when swimming"
4.0,Works good for international travel
4.0,"attractive and nice , not a big fan of the nina maid on the box"
4.0,"They're warm and comfortable.  However, they're a bit tight around my ankles.  They're tight enough that they don't slide down, but I'm not sure I'd recommend them for ladies with larger ankles and calves.  But other than that, they're lovely."
4.0,"not quite as thick as my gray pair, still amazing feel and very warm, size up one nike girls don't have a booty. Im usually a large but get an xl for comfort"
4.0,"I got this for my kiddos to use while we bake together. First it is super cute and is a little bigger than I was expecting but that just means they will get to use it longer. The material is thicker but a little rough to the touch. My kids have sensitive skin so if this rubs on their skin it will leave a little rash like mark on them. If you are looking for something durable this would be a good choice, just note that the material is not soft."
4.0,"It is a little big but pretty! I ordered earrings to go with it but they were never shipped...I hope to see their quality as well. The necklace is good quality but tarnished quickly, so I put a layer of clear nail polish on the back and that did the trick...it is a fun necklace."
4.0,"Comfortable fit, classic style easy to accessorize."
4.0,"It seems resilient a month or so in, and it covers the bike... but it's a bear to put on. Don't like how difficult that was."
4.0,I wear a size 6 in every pair of pants and shorts I own. I could not even pull these up over my butt!!!
4.0,"O material não parece ser dos melhores, mas o tamanho coube perfeitamente. As extremidades possuem elástico apertado, vamos ver se o tempo não vai esgarçar. O custo benefício valeu muito."
4.0,I absolutely love PattyBoutik and dont wear anything else in the winter! They are very flattering form fitting sweater and the material is soft as well. I order every color when I buy a sweater bc I love them so much! I'm giving this only 4 stars only bc the sizes are not consistent...sometimes it's a small but sometimes it's a medium and this is even with the exact style sweater...not sure if the color of material changes the sizing but I always order both sizes and ship the one back that doesn't fit but otherwise this clothing line is amazing!!!
4.0,"acceptable, different, nice to wear."
4.0,Slightly short fit. I ended up sewing the ends together to make it an infinity scarf and now it's my favorite scarf!
4.0,"Exactly as advertised. Been looking for a light, thin and yet fashionable pair of sunglasses for a while and this definitely is what I have been looking for.<br /><br />Only downside is that when I look at electronics such as a smart phone screen, the Fitbit etc, the colors are kinda twisted or not natural and hence 4 out of 5 stars"
4.0,"It's metal, is silver colored, and has a standard vertical pin on the rear. What more could a detective ask for? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br />I have attached to my review the best photo you'll probably get of this :)"
4.0,Like the design and color also great heel height I am going to order another pair in a different design I will just order a small size
4.0,The elastic band is very strong and holds my cards and cash securely. Plus it doesn't make my pocket bulky. This is much better than a normal wallet.
4.0,"Got these to wear as new lip rings. I was unsure of what circumference I needed for my lip, so I got this set. The smallest seems good for nose, the middle fits my lip well, but the large could also be worn on lip, but it's too large for me. I was able to get it snapped on pretty quickly, and it has not gotten lose or come off so far!"
4.0,"Got these bonnets  for my long 37+jumbo braids .<br /><br />They are made of good quality (easy to machine wash) wearing/using  the same one ,(the blue one, haven’t use the other two yet) for about  two months now , it stays on all day & night while your sleeping, does not come off unless you take it off, ) but now it is becoming looser and losing it shape around the headband .<br />It’s been holding my braid style down, (however I  do still wear a satin or polyester scarf on my hair underneath , to keep braids laid and together."
4.0,Love these. Wish a different color lens was available when I bought them.
4.0,"I like this blouse. I've never loved three-quarter sleeves and was surprised to find that these didn't bother me. I like the fit of the shirt. It's great for those of us who want to hide a not-so-slender middle. The fabric is thin and flowy, this enough that I do wear a tank top underneath the shirt. The shirt is nice and long with no chance of showing any skin, which I appreciate. The color is my least favorite. It's a teensy bit too yellow for me, though it's green enough that I still wear it.<br /><br />*I received this from the Amazon Vine program in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
4.0,Nece selection
4.0,The actual hat seems deeper than most hats. Makes my head look bigger. Also the donut decal isn’t flat or flush against the hat.
4.0,Cheap material but still love it
4.0,No link to attach locket to chain.
4.0,"I loved this dress, however my hips are a tad larger than my bust and because this fabric has no stretch, it just did not glide over my hips at all.  Alas, I had to return.  I know a larger size would have just been too large at my chest."
4.0,"I wear a size 2, am 5'6 and weight 109 pounds so the small was perfect.  I have a rather tiny bust (34A) and the cups add a little bit to my chest.  If you are a person who isn't a true size 2, I would order a medium."
4.0,It is bigger than I expected. Go down a size unless you like to swim in your clothes. Came much earlier than estimated arrival date which is great.
4.0,This is a very cute & simple summer dress. I ordered it to go to the lake with and it’s very comfortable/breathable. It is not see through but I do wish it was a little thicker. I’m 5’10 and ordered a large in cream/white. It’s a perfect length for me. I do wish the dress was a little bit more cream but still cute!
4.0,..glad I have till late Spring/early Summer before I'll start wearing. Hope to lose a few lbs so the sleep shorts aren't so tight. They washed and dried well but for me the waistband is too snug. No shrinkage when I washed. I like now but will like much more when the waistband isn't too tight! lol
4.0,Was heavier than expected but A good peace of jewlery
4.0,"Surprisingly excellent for the price, good material and looks really neat."
4.0,"These are super cute and fit well. The bottom sole is hard/stiff but my daughter can actually walk pretty well in them. Only complaint is the bow is sewn on but the sides are hot glued and the one side came up. Doesn’t effect anything, you can just see underneath it, the glue."
4.0,"Nice looking scarf but it had a horrible smell when we got it. Gave it to my granddaughter for a gift and we had to have it cleaned before wearing it. Bought two of them and they were in plastic, but when it was opened, they stunk! In any event, she loves it and wears it all the time."
4.0,"So far, so good. The gloves are as described. Though they are Men's XL in size, they are just a little snug (in the 'Across the hand' measurement) but still comfortable enough to wear.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  The gloves are a good quality buy but I would have to say that the sizing runs just a little small. Using these gloves to do multiple chore involving warn/hot water one day created a 'vacuum' within the gloves. I struggled to get them off. For this reason I would caution anyone looking to get these to bear in mind that sizing is more of a roomy LARGE and not quite an actual EXTRA LARGE in regards to the width of the hand measurement. Otherwise, they have a good grip (for holding items, like wet plates) and are just long enough to keep water from getting into the glove."
4.0,"comfy, nice, i would order again"
4.0,Dainty enough for an adjustable toe-ring.
4.0,This is super cute though it could be bigger especially the top.  It would fit up to a size 8 well.  It isn't as thick as the other flirty apron I ordered but is the same size.
4.0,04/11/2019  This is an OK buy.  Gave as gift and recipient has not commented.  Scared to ask.  wjc
4.0,"Expected to not love these as they seemed too thick and unflattering in the bag, but I was wrong. These are my favorite comfy pants and work well on my petite frame. Some fading from wash and color transfer from the red to the white lettering, but they’re sweats so I’m not upset. Will buy in more colors."
4.0,"It's cheap, so I bought this with points I had on my credit card. Speaking for what I got it for, it's cute and does exactly what I wanted, which is literally just to hold loose change. Can't fit too many bills in it, but that's fine. Material kind of feels like polyethylene on a swimming pool, which is kind of off putting."
4.0,"Cute top, is a little short on the length"
4.0,"It took a very long time to get to me, but it was lost in the mail, it finally arrived and it is really cute. My one complaint is the coin purse inside it is very small. I really like the color. If you need it in a rush better go somewhere else."
4.0,"Runs kinda big for my toddler, and the Tongue of the shoe doesn’t stay flat. It’s always moving to the side so I’m constantly adjusting it for my daughter."
4.0,"I couldn’t help myself because, these really remind me of Top Gun. Haha! I’ve never worn a pair like these and they’re pretty Cool. I always wear Polarized Glasses though and these definitely are. They’re tinted fairly dark too, so the squinting of a crazy bright day should be well under control. They come in n a nice looking Box, a separately package Cleaning Rag and a Polarize Test Card to show you the difference of a Polarized Lens.<br />  I would definitely refer these."
4.0,"I loved this hat and the color but, unfortunaly the hat was to big. Even under the chin strap there was no way i<br />Could adjust it.  Thanks sydney"
4.0,"Really nice and doesn't look cheap is just as it describes it a dime size, so if you are looking for something small and nice this is it! Can be for formal or casual use!"
4.0,Nice sweater but was a bit smaller and thinner than I thought
4.0,Love this jacket. It’s warm but not thick.
4.0,"They are a little thin, but will be perfect to wear under stretchy sundresses"
4.0,"I’m 5’1 175 very muscular lower body. They give a pretty decent waist gap in the back for me since my waist is much smaller than my butt. And the tie folds down, but i think if i take them in slightly i can fix that issue. Other than that no complaints."
4.0,The pattern and colors on this dress are beautiful. The length was perfect and I love the pockets in this dress. My one qualm with this item is that the waist is NOT elasticized. I am worried about the disability of the dress when wiggling it over my shoulders and bust.
4.0,Material is not as cheap as I thought it would be! I am 5'6 180lbs with chest and hips and it fits great even without the undergarments! Luv the adjustable straps !This is definitely a good buy!
4.0,No complaints. My daughter loves them!
4.0,Really cute bathing suit...I'm 5'1&#34; 150lbs and the XL fits perfectly...which is weird.
4.0,honestly these were great bur my ears have been blown out to much for them to sit well
4.0,I own this in royal blue and black!!! Super comforts and I love that it is not to short fort my long legs. I am 5”6 and 145 with a muscular build. I ordered a med and returned for a small. Love that it is wash and wear.
4.0,"Super cute dress, but I am only 5'3 and it fits longer than I would like (every story of a short girl...lol)  FYI if you turn the dress around backwards it fits shorter and actually looks cuter!"
4.0,Nylon and stretchy. Size can fit most.
4.0,"Tried on when I was 20 weeks pregnant, flattered the bump nicely. Didn’t end up keeping because it showed my underwear line, but if you wear seamless undies or thongs I think it would work perfectly!"
4.0,"The quality is not great, but the costume served its purpose"
4.0,"It was tighter than the purple one I also bought, but was of some use during the summer"
4.0,Love these PJ’s. They look smart and makes you feel like the best dressed “dreamer” there is.
4.0,"Great dress, my daughter gets lots of compliments when she wears it. Washes well."
4.0,"Comes with a little screwdriver that's a perfect fit for the Ray-Ban hardware. The lenses fit perfectly and are staying in. They are clear, tinted well and minimal eye reflection. Impressed by that since these ***ARE NOT*** Ray-Ban official lenses.<br /><br />  Even in natural low light conditions, sunset, they work very well. Clear ""HD"" vision would be how I would describe it. Had the setting sun directly in my eyes last night, it was bright, brighter than the original Ray-Ban grey mirror tint but JUST dim enough to avoid using my vehicles sun visor.<br /><br />  Do I like them more than the original lenses? Yes. If you would like a cheaper alternative to RB lenses. These are worth your time. Cheers! Stay healthy and happy all."
4.0,I love the matte black and the packaging was great! I’m only giving 4 stars because they feel like they could snap easily in half and I’m afraid I might do just that when they’re in my purse.
4.0,I'm 5'2 118 pounds the small on me was very loose. but I really like them so I'll where a cute belt.  I recommend a xs
4.0,Descent. I didn't know the medium would be a true medium (so used to asian sizes now). Also didn't realize that the pattern was tiny hearts. Not a huge fan. I like these because my wife likes them and because its breezy down there when I have them on. A must during Texas summers.
4.0,Por el precio es un buen producto
4.0,"I like this sweater it's very cute, it's not &quot;cheap&quot; looking but the materials are not of the highest quality. It's unique and I am happy with the purchase because of its uniqueness."
4.0,"I like the detail in the pic however this face mask does not fit a child’s face properly, this mask is more so for teens and adults. Wish it came in a smaller size."
4.0,Very tiny nose or tragus studs. A nice selection of colors. They sit flat against nose.
4.0,Cute and dainty. Smaller than I imagined. Had a hard time opening it at first. It’s small in circumference. Fits snug against my ear.
4.0,I like the look but with the hoodie up looks a little bulky
4.0,"I bought this because I had lost my original barbell and needed a quick replacement. It looks amazing and I knew that by buying the 1.5 inch it would be too big. So if someone's normal barbell size is 1.5 inches, this would look great!"
4.0,True to measurements. I purchased 2 so that I can regain them together. Perfect for a costume piece I needed.
4.0,It’s kinda big and long on me. I ordered a size small. I’m 125 lbs and 5’4 inches tall. I’m going to keep it because with a cardigan it looks okay that way.
4.0,"Love this tank top. I like that it has a long hemline. The fit is very flattering and there’s no rolling up due to the longer hemline. The fabric is soft, stretchy and very comfortable against the skin. It’s versatile enough to compliment any outfit. This tank top is a great addition to my everyday essentials. I would definitely purchase another."
4.0,It was just as expected:
4.0,"Overall, it’s nice and sturdy. The band is colorful and nice, I can shower with it and actually is better because it cleans it up and looks new (gets dirty with use). It’s a hard linen, it’s not flimsy, which is a little rough to wear at first but softens up a tad. The biggest thing is that the part that attaches to the watch is plastic - I was not expecting that. While durable, it makes it look a little more kiddie than I had anticipated."
4.0,"This belt is plain and sturdy. I like that it is  made of leather. It is not bonded or composite, just a pure band of leather. There are five holes; more could be made if necessary. The buckle is black matte metal. The belt itself has no embellishments other than contrast thread affixing the buckle. It is fairly subtle but does limit the belt to casual use. It d looks great with jeans. It comes with a little bag for storage. Nice, simple and sturdy."
4.0,Good product. Get what you pay for
4.0,"Super cute. Has a little stretch, im a S but My buns need more room;) went with M And it feels much better !material feels nice and soft. I’ll order another color ❤️"
4.0,"Nicely made walking shorts with mesh inside. The fit is slightly smaller than I expected, but they still fit well."
4.0,These were a lot longer than I was expecting! The longest one goes almost to my belly button. Still incredibly cute though.
4.0,"Fabric was great, unfortunately was advertised to fit newborn and was far to large."
4.0,"Don't like the chain, but the pendant is so beautiful!"
4.0,Even though my grandson is only 3 1/2 because they make them tight fitting these days I went with the 5T's. They are great. Very soft and he loves them.
4.0,"Since it is so big, it is very top heavy. I have a very heavy duty iron stand for it and it still flips out of it when the wind picks up. It allows for great coverage since it is so big and is easy to put up and down."
4.0,It's a simple nice flow to it dress
4.0,We love the shoes they look exactly like the picture. So cute! Run a little big but not too big
4.0,"The Casio watch I have is great. It runs and runs and do far I’ve had it for 10 years and for $40 I got my money’s worth. Their bands only last about 3-4 years, however.  This band is the third one.  It wears then cracks and splits.  Good watch but only mediocre bands in my opinion."
4.0,"I like this, but I feel like I'm wearing a summer time robe. It IS made nicely. The fabric is like a stretchy T-shirt. I have to decide if I'm going to keep it...maybe I will use it as a &#34;robe&#34; for travel and family vacations..."
4.0,"Great, well made shirt."
4.0,"I am normally a medium, but followed all the reviews and ordered a size up to a large. The dress was too big, but it is easy to take in instead of returning."
4.0,"I began giving my husband haircuts and he insisted I needed a hair cutting apron. Well, I came across this one and felt the pricing was pretty good so I ordered it. The head strap isn’t too well adjustable for shorter folks as the top of the apron hangs low for me even on the shortest adjustable strap snap."
4.0,I’ve had it maybe a month and the black lettering has worn to silver so it’s hard to read
4.0,I actually love it. Fits very well. I am 5'3 155lb. Pretty shapely. Ordered M. Fits well.
4.0,Slips off the ear because it’s a little too heavy. Very pretty though.
4.0,They're warm and cozy but look pretty loose on my girl
4.0,The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because one of the earrings arrived tangled and kinked a bit as shown in the picture.<br /><br />I just thought if I had wanted to give this as a gift for it to be like that it would have looked like I had taken these out or used them or something. So if you want to give these to someone just take them out of the box and make sure they're not wrapped around themselves!<br /><br />Other than those two details(which I was able to fix in about 30 seconds) these earrings are great! They are beautiful and sparkly!<br /><br />I like the versatility in that you can wear them up as a cuff or just down and dangling. The stones really catch the light and shine!<br /><br />They seem well made and they're really nice!
4.0,"I bought it a tad bit large (12) (and I assume this is because I used imperial measurement then converted it to metric thus a bit of inaccuracy) either that or I just have skinny fingers, but aside from that I don't think that this is supposed to be a proper spinning ring since it takes more force to get it to really spin but it's more of a fidgeting ring - which for my intended purpose works out.<br /><br />Also the copper around the ring is actually a bit darker than shown in the image - also not a big deal since I like darker hues but hey nothing to complain about for the price you get it at"
4.0,"Subtle but fashionable, these bracelets are a great find. The string is a little less substantial than I hoped, but it is fine for occasional use. This is a good buy."
4.0,"Fast shipping, over all,,,,,,,,, bought extension for daughter she has large ankles, thought chains would be a little longer but that's ok will pass them to someone else.  Satisfied"
4.0,Nice lightweight band.  Only issue is the mess has some rough edges that catch on woven fabrics.
4.0,"A little bigger than I anticipated. Not a problem, except for the fabric being very stiff. It makes me look boxy. Cute pattern, sewn together well. But the fabric is so awkward and itchy"
4.0,Cute dress. If you are smaller busted  then the fit is not perfect. I bought this dress for my teenage daughter and the seam along each side bunched up slightly near the bust line.
4.0,"Fits well, a little on the roomy side, but great for summer. Can dress up for the office or down for a night out. Easy wearing, no wrinkles."
4.0,I like the colors but wish they were solid colors instead of designs. They are not as wide as they look in the picture.
4.0,Tight on the arms
4.0,"Very soft and comfy,  nice color"
4.0,My daughter likes them a lot. She’s not real fond of the neck line but they fit her good.
4.0,"I'm 6'1"" and weigh about 170.  I ordered a size medium and it fit just right.  The first day I got it I put it on and wore it all day.  That was a mistake.  The next morning I had muscle spasms up and down my back.  So, I waited three days for the muscles to relax and I started over again.  This time I will wear it for a couple of hours each day for the first week or so and will slowly lengthen the time I wear it.  It does feel good while I'm wearing it and it does what it is supposed to - makes me stand and sit up straighter."
4.0,I wear and ordered an 8.5. A 9 would have been perfect.
4.0,"Looks great! Material is softer than I expected. There's a little bit of a chemical smell, but I assume that will go away when I wash it."
4.0,it is all good
4.0,"So cute, I just wish the top gave more support.  I'm a 38DD and this gave me no help.  I still got TONS of compliments on it though!"
4.0,Drymax is a good sock but found these to be a bit small
4.0,"This is a great Jacket, but it has no insulation. It was definitely built for fall not winter. But it is made really well. The reason it got 4* and not 5 is the hook and loop for patches is horrible!!! They shouldn't even have put that on the jacket. Gonna have to get it removed and put on some real hook and loop. Other than that it is a great jacket. One more thing to be aware of its made in China."
4.0,I love thst I can adjust this stretchy band. In the past I've bought the shortest ones and still had to alter them to stay in the correct position. I like the looks of this and although the the glittery material is a touch scratchy but once I put it on I wasn't even aware of it. I've had it on for a few days and love it.
4.0,They are very cute but I did find it to run a bit small. She is normally a size 5 and we got a size 5 but they were snug. She went into the pool with them and didn't seem to have any issues. :)
4.0,"A lot of people said the coat ran small - so I ordered a size larger. It is a little large, but I will be able to wear a sweater under it if needed."
4.0,"For many years I have worn string bikinis, available (alas) only at Walmart, but no longer available. These Andrew Scott underwear are close in style, and comfortable. I'm 5'8&#34;, 155, with a waist around 31-32.  Colors are sedate. The all-white 3-pack was not available in my size when i ordered."
4.0,"Very nice, soft and comfortable. I bought it to lounge in. Only thing not so good is I have a hard time keeping shoulders up."
4.0,"The color is more of a bright red than what the picture shows. I will keep them, but I liked the color on the order site better."
4.0,"Doesn't fit the way I expected. But Still fits, just a little loose."
4.0,"I love them. They are a great texture, stay in place and at 5'10'' I usually find that leggings tend to run short but these are perfect."
4.0,Flimsier than I though. definitely not an everyday shoe. You can reliably wear them 1-2 days a week for several months though.
4.0,Product is the same as the picture shown. Ordered up with an XL I'm 5'10 150lbs. Only 4 stars because Bra is a bit small I wear a 34D but I can work with it. I'm very satisfied with this product.
4.0,"Length was great, however, the underarms are HUGE!!! I had my mother take in my daughters dress over 2 inches on each side and it fits great! Around neck was perfect for size.<br /><br />This is a beautiful dress!!!!!!! Would highly recommend if you go a size down or can sew! Be careful on going too much size downs because of the length!"
4.0,Very pretty. Says dry cleaning only. Didn't know that before I purchased.
4.0,Ordered this to cosplay hawks. It is very comfortable and has zipped slots in the back of the jacket to put loops in for a pair of wings. Only complaint is that the gloves that came with are not one size fits all. The are meant for someone that does not have fat fingers. Otherwise I would definitely recommend getting this cosplay.
4.0,"Love the feel (thick, but not too thick), love the color (just like the pic), and customer service was great when I got the wrong color sent to me originally.  My only complaint is they shrink.  Yes, they started out nice and long, but by the third wash they're as short as any others.  I specifically bought them because everyone said how long they were.  I washed them on cold and I let them air dry since I didn't want to take the chance of them shrinking, but they shrank anyway.  Apparently, it's impossible to buy long pjs that stay long. But all in all I like them."
4.0,The color is bright and the material is fine. A few things to note: the print in only on one side. The material is not as soft as I would like to. The craftmanship is not of the best.
4.0,Purchased a large fits well. I'm 5'8 160lbs this dress reached all the way to the floor. Would have been 5 Shara but both pockets were half sewn shut. It was an easy fix so not That big of a deal.
4.0,I would say this fits a little small. I ordered a size up than I usually would. I order large to wear with leggings and ordered an XL and it fit imo like a large. It’s super cute though!
4.0,"Love this bag, it has a few minor issues that are personal preference, but one that's manufactured. So the main issue is the seams are coming out on the top and straps. I've had it for about a month, so that's early considering most of my bags, from Walmart, last longer than that.<br />My other issues, are the front pocket doesn't close, it's really hard to put anything in it because it all falls out so easily. Lastly, the straps are all one piece, so when you go to put it on real weird and precise or else the straps will be Hella uneven and you can't grab it from the handle, because then it pulls the whole strap up.<br />That said, I've rigged it with some bandanas and have it tricked out with my Hydra pin, and it looks awesome."
4.0,"These are really cute but they fit our granddaughter's feet loose across the middle of her foot. I had to return 2 pair before getting the size right. She's a toddler 9/9.5 and so we ordered the 27, which fits the best but still big. The 26 was too short. The buckle on the right shoe doesn't want to stay buckled. She really loves her shoes and doesn't want to take them off. The design reminds her of Shopkins. She's hooked on mini chocolaticas. I'll see how these wear before ordering more. In my opinion they are priced too high at the $54 mark and questionable value at the $27 price point. I would not pay more than $27."
4.0,"Apart from the fact that it took a month to ship, it's amazing product at a great price"
4.0,"It's beautiful and comfortable.  They send with it the tools to take excess links off that that was nice, didn't have to pay extra to get it done."
4.0,Super soft but run a little small!<br />Overall great and very comfortable but I would def size up one or even two.
4.0,I was expecting better fabric but overall it's a good t-shirt
4.0,Too big! Please make these smaller. I love this style band but they are too big. Much bigger than what I had for my last Fitbit
4.0,"Got a new job and needes some bras comfortable enough to wear on long 10+ hour shifts. Normally wear a 38 DDD, got and xl and it fits great! Cheap, comfortable, and keep everything in place without holding your girls down. That being said if your looking for a good bra to go for a run in this is NOT it.<br />I wouldnt reccomend this for actual sports, but its perfect for my purposes or doing stuff around the house. The only thing i dont like is the padding. Theyre a bit small for the cup, i think they use the same size padding for every size bra and because of that it requires a bit of positioning but at least its decently thick so i cant complain too much."
4.0,The style of this dress is nice. I still haven't worn it.
4.0,"Dress was very nice. Heavier in weight than expected. The jacket was to small. Expected lighter, looser, and more flowing type of dress."
4.0,IT A GREAT COLOR JUST A LIGHT INSIDE. BUT IT WILL BE GREAT FOR TAKING IT PLACE AND BE GREAT TO HOLD A FEW THINGS AND WANT BE HEAVY ON THE SHOULDERS. lOVE THE COLOR.
4.0,"Mi daughter ordered this for her, she liked it, fitted well, she liked it but said it was a little delicate"
4.0,"It fit very nicely with stretch in the bust. Would have liked more stretch in the skirt material, but only because I had I big dinner! Was very flattering for my curvy figure, as I was told. Plus, I love the pockets!"
4.0,"Cute, sexy and fit well! Great dress for the price!"
4.0,"Beautiful. Arrived a lot sooner then I expected. The only thing I could say that was iffy was it needs to be ironed, but that can be easily done! I love it!"
4.0,"Very comfortable and fit perfectly, but the overall build quality seems relatively low."
4.0,"The tanks are great, but they do go down farther than the pictures show. They almost cover my shorts even."
4.0,"The color is great.  the ruffle on top is cute.  The problem is that even the xxl seemed a little small (I typically wear a size 16).  it is rather low cut which I guess is fine if you wear a small but if you are larger or big busted, you may want to think twice about ordering this.  If you like the ruffle but crave modesty, this may not be the suit for you.  It is cute on though"
4.0,"I’m 5’1” 118 lbs 36B.  I ordered a medium. Length on this dress hits a couple inches above my knee.  Good fit in the bra area with extra room.  This dress has no waist definition so it hides any fluff, but will also be very cool in the tropics.  I wish I had ordered a small, but it’s not available in the Black with multi colored flowers.  Dress appears to be made well and the material  is a very nice and soft 100% Rayon.  I will try to gently shrink this via cold water washing by hand and then closely monitoring it in a moderate temp dryer.  Overall very cute and I like the V-back"
4.0,"Received the bag on time.  The bag was as described, Helen Welsh no long makes handbags, which is too bad, as the quality was always great."
4.0,"I ordered this product because by chance I came across with it and I liked it. I have umbrellas that I keep losing a good alternative to the umbrellas could be this item, at least that was my logic of thoughts when I ordered it.  This raincoat is lightweight, very easy carry around, it does come in a little bag. Mine is green a very nice green. The zipper is functional, no problems there. It very comfortable although runs kind of a little bit small if I wear heavier cloth. I have worn it several times already with great results!!  Glad I got it!!!<br /><br />Happy shopping!!!<br />I received this product at a free/reduced price in exchange for an honest opinion."
4.0,"Keeps the girls in place and does keep moisture away, that's why I bought it.  It does exactly what it's supposed to.  Only thing, with no clasp, you have to use it as a pull over, and with it being brand new, it's snug.  I'm sure it will relax as it's worn more."
4.0,I like the product but find it a little longer than I anticipated
4.0,"I just want to say this PJ set is adorable, but the shorts are SHORT. They are like a boy short. So if you don't plan to walk the dog in them I would say this is the perfect set of summer time PJ's for you"
4.0,"(bought this on my husband's amazon account)<br />I wore this to Oktoberfest in Munich and got many compliments! Our German friend told me that he would never have known that I bought it online in the US. However it runs waaaay small. I am typically a US size 0-2 waist and sized up to a 34 (US size 4 according to the size chart), just to be safe. I couldn't zip it all the way! I had to work very hard to get it zipped up. Would recommend sizing up 2 sizes, at least."
4.0,"Cute. Returned it bc the fit runs large. Ordered my usual size medium, would definitely need a small."
4.0,I love the purse and size however the buckle on it keeps making a chime noise......very irritating.
4.0,"For just over $2 a piece, these are a great deal.  The silicone material they're made out of is so similar to the ""real"" sports band that come with an apple watch I can't really tell a difference between them.  They attach/detach just like a brand-name watch band for the Apple Watch and feel about the same thickness.  The one thing I've found that I've knocked a star off for is that one side of one of the bands doesn't lock into place on the watch.  I know it's not a problem with my watch because the other 5 bands lock into place just fine.  That being said, I can still use that band because it fits fairly snug and I haven't had a problem with the band popping off (yet - if there's a need to come back and update my review I will).  Four stars simply because the one half of the one watch band isn't snug, otherwise it'd be 5 stars."
4.0,The elastic is a little much. You will be showing off your assets. Very sexy bottoms.
4.0,Great style. Get a Case for them.
4.0,I normally wear a large.  I ordered an XL and it was smaller than expected.  Other than that I love it.
4.0,Cute shirt but made for someone with larger boobs!
4.0,"The waist is nice and high, above the navel.  The top fit well and looks really cute.  The bottoms are solid blue on the back, but the broad blue and white stripes on the front don't really flatter your tummy... unless of course you have a flat tummy!"
4.0,"I planned ahead and bought a size bigger than what I would normally wear and it fits perfectly.  It has a slight smell to it but it went away after I washed it.<br /><br />I was under the impression that the bottom of the shirt had a defined band, but it doesn't.  You have to do the gathering at the bottom yourself when you put it on."
4.0,Did not see sent as gift
4.0,"We got this for our 5 year old who loves to run and play.  They are beautiful quality but the negative for us was that it has no tread on the bottom / sole which makes it very slippery for her.  We are in the process of trying to add some texture to the bottom to help with this, otherwise she is going to slide all across the school floor."
4.0,I like the way the shirt feels and the way it looks. It's a very nice shirt just tighter than I expected
4.0,Nice horseshoe but rather small.  Daughter wearing in 2nd helix piercing.
4.0,Fit perfectly. Taco looks great in his security jacket!
4.0,Got so many compliments.  Hang to dry.  Shrinks terribly.
4.0,these are okay.  they do the job and are nothing fancy.  they look like the ones you would get at a big box store
4.0,"I am a confessed watch geek. I have been one since I received a Bulova for Confirmation in the 5th grade. These days, I have focused my obsession only on watches that have what is known as a ""complication"" - features beyond hours, minutes, seconds and date. This watch qualifies nicely with a useful chronograph or ""stop watch"" function. Back when I got my first chronograph, I used it a lot to time how long I left the tea bag in my tea cup (the Brits suggest 3 to 5 minutes depending on your taste). But as a car geek, I also used it for Time Speed Distance rallies (TSD) and I even won two local championships as navigator using my Omega chronograph.<br /><br />This chronograph watch checks in with a comfortable strap, and an easy-to-read dial (look at the dial of a Breitling Navitimer - really difficult for me to tell time with all that's going on). Plus, it's very accurate (common for modern quartz watches) - tested against the kitchen atomic wall clock.<br /><br />The only issue I have is a quirk for me but may not be for you. The large sweep second hand runs all the time. That's not how most high quality, mechanical chronographs work - my first was the Omega Speedmaster Moon watch so I have a personal prejudice for watches where the sweep hand only moving when the stopwatch is running. This watch has the stopwatch second hand on a small sub dial and I think that this makes it hard to see when you need to react quickly like you do when running TSD rallies. It's OK for timing parking meters, brewing tea or other non-critical applications but it isn't my favorite choice. (you make the call)<br /><br />This is a good looking, accurate and comfortable watch at a really good price. I did not test how waterproof it is because I don't wear watches in the pool or ocean - you make that decision for yourself.<br /><br />Nice watch - packaged for gift giving..."
4.0,"Slim-fitting shirt made with lightweight material.<br />  The XL fits me perfectly in width, but would be even better if it were a couple inches longer.<br /> ( I am 6'3&#34;, 178 lbs. )<br /><br />  I am pleased with the purchase."
4.0,"This was a great buy for the price! I bought this piece about a month ago, it's still in great shape and I got it for a penny."
4.0,"Shrunk with first wash in cold water, but bought a size too large because flannel does tend to shrink"
4.0,"I liked these, they were just not the right size, they didn't give me any hassle to return it. They were unopened."
4.0,This skirt is very versatile. Can be dressed up or down and is very soft. Love the lace detailing. Skirt is a little large so I’d size down. The length is a little long but perfect for a more modest business look.
4.0,Pants don't fit great ans shirt is way to small for an x large
4.0,Ride mountain bikes and jog in the summer here in Missouri.  Hot Hot Hot.  These are perfect for cycling cleats and low rise running shoes and much cheaper priced than the big name guys.
4.0,Love the shirt but the shoulder area is very snug
4.0,I bought another colour last year in 2x but this recent ones were a little to small 🥲<br />Cannot return as I am in DR n would cost to much to return so have to loose 5 lbs …lol
4.0,Love the design and feel of the shirt. The size was somewhat smaller than expected.
4.0,Bought these shoes for my daughter.  They are very comfortable and fit as expected.  I am happy with quality of the slippers and very glad it has durable material.  The color is very bright and provides good arch support.
4.0,Very cute but smaller than expected
4.0,Good product.  I do worry how long the plastic credit card sleeves will last.
4.0,Daughter Loves it. Material was nice heavy and durable. Fit perfectly and my daughter has not stopped wearing it. Only problem we had is that the zipper has a tendency to go off track on occassion. It did not break and can be avoided with care.
4.0,At first when I got this in didn't really understand how the straps would work because it didn't look like they would lay flat the way they're attached. When I tried it on it did make the correct crisscrossing and there's only a small bump because the straps get pulled pretty flat.<br />I wear this over a strapless adhesive bras because this doesn't have any kind of support to it. It's really cute with backless shirts or even racerbacks. The fun straps can really change an outift. I wear a lot of bandeaus and I'm really loving this one.<br />The material is very soft and stretchy. I had an issue when I had to pull it down a few times because the bottom of my bra was showing. I finally had to tuck it underneath to make it stay but that worked just fine.<br />I'll definitely wear this again. I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.
4.0,Nice piece but a lot smaller than I expected.
4.0,Much thinner than expected. Not useful as a jacket; more useful as a top.
4.0,To small but I just brought it to excerise in.
4.0,Lose at waist so have to wear shorts underneath as there is no spot for a belt on them. Thin material so I’d recommend wearing shorts underneath regardless. Overall you get what you pay for.
4.0,Fairly nice
4.0,I like the fact that I am eager to find out where they are taking the evil morty storyline. And the fact that you already have the council of morty badges???
4.0,"I bought this in a large, because I didn't want it to be too tight, and I'm glad I did. It's so cute.<br />My only concern is that the material seems kind of linty. I'm not sure what's going to happen when I wash it."
4.0,"GREAT SLIPPER BUT, ARRIVED DAMAGED AND  WE DIDNT GET ANOTHER PAIR BECAUSE THEY SOLD OUT. MAYBE THIS YEAR"
4.0,"a good fit, but glasses fog up while wearing."
4.0,This is a good necklace to wear casual or dressed up. GREAT BUY!
4.0,Bought these for my wife.  She tells me they are the best sunglasses she has wore in a long time. They fit great and really keep the sun out of her eyes while she drives.
4.0,"My husband says that the zipper can get annoying sometimes when he tries to zip up the jacket. Other than that, he loves it for those chilly winter days :)"
4.0,"I gave the wool hooded shawl 4 stars because it does not have a button, hood or ribbon tie at the neck - I sew so I added a ribbon tie.  The weight of the shawl is lightweight & still warm - nice design & well made.  I needed something to through on during my flight to Canada and then use it while out sightseeing....."
4.0,"The costume was fabulous! We had a Bridgerton themed Birthday Ball and it was a hit. I only gave it 4 stars because the buttons fell apart and the seams came out some of bows on the arms, causing some of them to fall off as well. Without the hoop-slip petticoat underneath, looks a lot like a nightgown. Design was perfect for our occasion, but the quality was not great."
4.0,"Good fit, good design. The shirt is a decent quality."
4.0,"i think the ensemble met my expectations based on the hype/ratings. the material is polyester, which is not great and very much reminiscent of 70's shirts my grandma owned. the bright side is that polyester is easy to care for. fit's as expected; i'm an XS petite in american sizes and the small fit well. the shoulder width is a bit wide for my frame, but it's not enough to deter me from turning this one in for the blue set. looks nice and is a good deal for two pieces."
4.0,Awesome product 👌
4.0,hurt my feet I am sorry to say love the look of the shoe.  Half size bigger would not fit...
4.0,I did read the reviews and this does run small.  I bought a size up and it does fit and a larger one would have been to large.  I love it because you can dress it up or down.  I bought a size Med I am 5'4 and 125#.
4.0,Only giving 4 stars because it runs big but is super cute! Wish it fit
4.0,"These are an OK pair of pants, they are well made, but I hate how they taper off in the legs, I cannot get down with this skinny jean fade, I hate it. If these we're boot cut or even relax fit they would be perfect. But that's just my preference,  these pants are very well made, warm and great price."
4.0,"It is of the quality expected for the price, but there is a significant flaw that makes it unwearable as a set.  The legs are out of alignment by 2.5 inches.  Nothing like what was pictured.  EZ return. Order one to two sizes larger."
4.0,Work pretty well. Keep boots in good shape but can be difficult to fit into tighter boots.
4.0,It’s a multi pack they fit all size heads pretty well. The colors sure do pop and feel sturdy enough.
4.0,Nice sandals for my son but they do run a bit small debating if I wanna try to return for a bigger pair but not sure if I'll receive the new s size in time for our vacation
4.0,"The only issues I had with this dress, is that the sides are really low, so there is major side boob, which is okay if that's what you're going for!"
4.0,Ended up being perfect for a cute summer wedding guest dress. Stone was nice and mouting was simple enough without looking to cheap.
4.0,"I sometimes have an issue with snoring and grinding my teeth. I bought this and  what essentially amounts to a mouth guard to separate my teeth in order to stop the grinding, align my jaw, and stop snoring. Since I have TMJ (my jaw joint is loose), I hoped this would help.<br /><br />I would say it generally works. It's a bit difficult if you have lots of hair, since it gets in the way, so I think if you want a pony tail/don't have short hair, it will slip around a bit. It mostly stays on with the holes for your ears, so too much hair in the way messes it up... and pushing on my ears doesn't feel great.<br /><br />I would recommend this, but only with something in your mouth to separate your teeth---so you don't have too much pressure on your teeth/jaw."
4.0,CAME IN TWO WEEKS!! I'm a 34B and I still have side boob in it so it does kinda fit odly but it's so cute and it's only $5. For the price it's amazing
4.0,"I have been packpacking and camping for over 30 years.  My last pack, is a CampTrails pack from... 1988, maybe?  It was also an internal frame, and about the same exact size as this one.  But, alas, one of the shoulder straps broke away from the main body.  I came across the Mission Gear pack, and it looked like a great deal.<br /><br />This pack meets all of my needs.  It has one big compartment inside, however, you can close off the bottom part with a drawstring, just like the top.  Then you can access the bottom part via a zippered access point on the outside.  My old pack, had something similar, but you could never really separate it from the inside, as it was suppsed to zipper close on the inside with a single rectangualr panel.  The way Mission Gear uses a cloth drawstring piece, allows for so much more flexibility with how much is stored in teh bottom.  IT would be perfect, as another reviewer suggested, for just your clothes.  It may even fit a smaller, summer weight sleeping bag (if you're lucky).<br /><br />The two zippered pockets on the outside are very deep and long, and can hold quite a bit of gear.  A first aid kit, backpacking camp stove, and more can fit in just one side.  I also really appreciate the extra mesh, stretch pockets on the sides where I can put a water bottle.  Very easy access.<br /><br />This pack is setup for a water hydration pack system.  It has a discreet hole where the straw tubing can go through, and it has a separator on the inside, where you can keep the hydration pack, yet still not be touching any of the other stuff packed inside.<br /><br />Another plus for this pack is the included rain cover.  It fits perfectly and has an elastic band which keeps the cover snug on your pack. It is very easy to put on and remove - a plus when you encounter a sudden rainstrom in your travels.  The rain cover is located in a small poclet on the very bottom outside of the pack.<br /><br />The pack comes with plenty of straps to tighhten and keep everything as compact and tight as needed.  The straps have plenty of D-rings and places to attach extra equipment that can hang off the pack.  The padding on your back is very comfortable, and the internal frame is easily accessible so you can mold the bars to your back and shoulder contours.<br /><br />The only thing I do not like so far, is the mesh pocket in the very front of the pack.  I would have preferred this pocket to be an enclosed front pocket.  Only because I would be more inclined to put more in that pocket it it was covered all the way and enclosed.  Otherwise, if you wanted to just put maps and trail books in this pocket for easy access, or a Boy Scout handbook, it does the job.  That is just a personal prefererence, and not necessarily an issue with function.<br /><br />My first impression of this pack is that it will be an excellent replacement to my old CampTrails.  I have a backpacking trip planned next month, and if all goes well, I will be back to update my review, and possibly change this to 5 stars.  I don't want to give it a 5-star rating before field testing it.<br /><br />I was lucky, and received this product at a discount.  But that does not stop me from giving an honest, unbiased review.  I want others to trust my reviews as I use similar reviews to purchase products off of Amazon."
4.0,"Cute vest, fit was great. Material is medium quality, some threads were hanging out, but fine for the price point."
4.0,Color was beautiful and it held up even after washing the color lasted.
4.0,Cute earrings.  The two tones of metal are hard to distinguish but I like the size and shape.
4.0,"due to the fact that I purchased a watch that does not have a battery and runs on movement, I had to have this automatic watch Winder. It certainly does do what it says it does."
4.0,I loved the fabric of this bohemian casual dress. I think that when you go out you have to wear a camisole underneath though because the opening is very very low and revealing with the 2 ties. The medium fit fairly well but a little tight in the bodice so if I purchased this dress again I would like a large
4.0,"The dress runs small, so I ordered about 2 sizes larger than normal, and it was a pretty good fit. It looks GREAT. and it wears GREAT. It's comfortable enough to wear all day or all evening. Really nice quality material and craftsmanship."
4.0,This is a nice complete set that looks very lovely in person. You will have to be careful to ensure that the necklace and bracelet don't roll over to expose their (seedy) underbelly. The underside is nothing to smile about but as long as you wear them properly these look fantastic. I doubt they will last for any significant period of time without fading though.
4.0,Very nice order the stainless steel look and black. Great for our young men.
4.0,Nice light weight second layer. Wanted the Hood as a first layer for cold winds so I don't have to wear a bulky Down Hood.
4.0,Really pretty...must have one black dress in your closet..and this is it!
4.0,It's a darker brown than the picture shows
4.0,Fits great. After first wash lining came un done seller was really helpful over replacement. Quick service and excellent service
4.0,"Size 8, ordered an 8 n half. Still too small"
4.0,Size runs small but is an otherwise excellent product.
4.0,"Cushy, and the lengths are good (I bought 2 pair for my mom and me). But having to stretch the band part between wears as they are tight, on both of us."
4.0,Fit as expected. Bought a as gift for my teenage son. The fleece is soft.
4.0,Wife has only had it a few days but so far meets needs & expectations - we hope it's good quality & lasts for years.
4.0,Nice shirt. Very lightweight Keeps me cool during these hot summer months. Washes ok as well. I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and testing. Fits nicely as well. Very neat.
4.0,"This is my second purchase, first the burgundy and then the blue, both size XXL.  I wash them in warm water and cool dry and they are fine.  BUT altho the burgundy fit fine (loose), the blue is tighter, which I wish it were like the burgundy in size, altho both are listed as XXL.  Unfortunately for me, I ASSumed they would fit exactly the same and went ahead and took off the tags and washed them, so can’t return. Not sure why the same product from the same material would fit differently...?<br /><br />Edit 9/15<br />I ordered the black ( my 3rd order of XXL) and, again, it was tighter than the burgundy, so I’m returning it.  Disappointed! (See pic)"
4.0,"It's cute and exactly as pictured, it's just made for a larger wrist. That said, I wear it anyway and I get allot of compliments. The hardest part is clasping it together.<br />It is free shipping, but it will take about 2 weeks. For the price: worth it."
4.0,"I love this blouse, however, it is way too small. I usually wear a size 20 and so ordered a 5x which matched my measurements. There is no stretch and the measurements given are not accurate for fit. Keeping it and continuing to lose weight so it will fit eventually."
4.0,Easy clip
4.0,"I use this to coat the rubber door seals on my vehicles to keep my doors from freezing shut (unless it's a heavy ice storm), and in my mind to help the rubber stay soft and supple longer."
4.0,Looks and feels like genuine leather. I'm very pleased with the item.
4.0,Product is as advertisesed.  Shipped on time.
4.0,Very cute...I just wish it hung off the shoulder easier. It’s a little too tight in the neck and doesn’t allow to hang off.
4.0,Really cute little charm. My charm kept falling off of the little post though. Wound up gluing it on and giving charm away.
4.0,They were all gifts. They liked them
4.0,The bib is a little bulky with the crumb catcher but it works. My husband drops food on the floor with mst meals. We have a special needs dog who can’t swallow anything but liquid but she loves food. She sits by my husband at mealtime to get anything that drops. She has to regurgitate any solid food. There has been no food dropped since my husband has started using the
4.0,Great for the price. Lovely colors.
4.0,"This is the most cute and comfortable dress. It fits perfectly, flows great, love that it has pockets and looks great. Would recommend this everyday dress to anyone"
4.0,I love these. Soft and fit well. Flattering. I do wish it was about $15 cheaper so that’s why I took away one star in the rating.
4.0,"For my 15 year old son, an adult Medium is too short in arm length. He is 6'0"" and 155 lbs."
4.0,Fits really nice! I wear a 16 and have a pear shape so I got the XXL and it looks sexy.
4.0,I mix these in with my candy during Halloween so the kids can choose either.  The batteries seem to last a couple of hours of constant use.  Can't beat the price.
4.0,Fits very well like to wear it when we go out
4.0,Material size
4.0,Great socks; she loves them.
4.0,"I purchased this petticoat in peach, and it was much brighter than the picture.  It is constructed well and its poof is perfect, but the bright color shows through some of my dresses.  I am still very happy with this product.  It adds the extra volume I wanted to my dresses and skirts."
4.0,"Makes punching out pins easy.  Line up the band in the groove, line up the punch, and tap.  The problem is that the pin is short, a reason I am shorting 1 star.  A bonus is that you can swap out the pins.  No hammer either.  I had to use a hammer from another kit."
4.0,"Really cute dress. I ordered a small because I didn’t want it loose in the bust based on some other feedback. It fit really well, it only felt tight when I was raising my arms over my head, and it was not tight at all around my waist. Material isn’t very soft (like most dresses of this style) and there’s a slight amount of stretch.  I’m 140#, just over 5’6”, 36C, athletic build. Without the petticoat it falls with excess folds. The pockets are also a bit higher than I would prefer.  I chose this pattern because I was looking for something unique but it isn’t that flattering on me so I’m sending it back and reconsidering a different pattern."
4.0,Beautiful hat! Just a little large.
4.0,Its nice but a bit small.I suggest you order a size up.
4.0,"I love this watch. It is very light and dependable. always on time. It conforms to my wrist very comfortably. I use it 7/24, even in bed when sleeping. Only when showering or if I use my hands to do any severe job, I take it off. The resin strap although is flexible, it brakes after 18 to 20 months of continues use."
4.0,I would have liked it but was too small
4.0,Great price and fit overall. Is a bit longer than expected but can't complain.
4.0,"Fits as expected and fits great and looks great.  The price is right for what you get, because the material is somewhat thin.  The jock portion is double layered, so it has good amount of material there, but the rest around the buttocks is somewhat thin.  I feel as if it will wear out in a short amount of time, but I guess it is commensurate with the price, so I can't complain much.  It's worth the price."
4.0,The recipient of this item really liked it and has worn it several times since purchased.  It is more on the larger size but not giagantic like a lot of newer costume jewelry you see today.
4.0,Purchased as a gift for a goose lover. Seems well made for the price. I am sure she will love it.
4.0,"I am 5'7 220 lbs and ordered an XL, it is a little on the bigger side, however I am smaller in the bust so it could just be me. The fabric isn't bad, definitely on the cheaper side but not the worst. It's very pretty, has adjustable straps, the elastic at the waist is very stretchy, the pattern is clear and vibrant. For the price, it's a pretty good buy."
4.0,A bit large but very good quality shoe!
4.0,"Good for the price, but a little bigger than I thought they'd be. But they seem well made out of decent metal"
4.0,"It looked nice on my wife, but unfortunately it was too small."
4.0,"Nice, fits good, well made."
4.0,Me gusto mucho<br />La pedí color negro y me encanto<br />Tela muy delgada justo para el calor
4.0,Just what you'd expect. A little larger than expected but would order same size again
4.0,"This is a little short, but super cute with leggings!"
4.0,For me run a little bit big not big different I like I expect.
4.0,Was a really fun dress to wear to my company Christmas party. Only complaint is that it's slightly see through in the chest area. So wear a sweater with it
4.0,Very cute... thin material but not see through.. good for summer... kind of cheap feeling but cute from afar
4.0,I bought the size recommended by measuring my hand. It doesn’t seem to give very much compression. I haven’t used it long so I don’t know if it’s going to help my joint pain in my thumb joint. At least when I’m wearing it it reminds me not to use that hand unless absolutely necessary.
4.0,"Great dress! It was a little smaller than expected. I usually wear a womens size 6 and ordered a medium, and it was very snug on the hips. Also a little see-through (probably because it was very tight on me), but wearing nude undergarments fixed the issue."
4.0,"It’s super comfortable! It’s shaped box-like though. I’m 5’1, 115 lbs and got a small, and it was extremely big. But for the price, I’ll definitely be keeping it."
4.0,"Love the look of this and it is so soft!!! Do not like the shedding though, which it does even after washing."
4.0,Very comfortable! This is my go to outfit for running errands. I usually wear a cardigan with it.<br />Only complaint would be the length of the straps. I’m 5’2” so the straps are a little long for me. It fits as expected. I bought a size large. I’m 165 lbs
4.0,"The design of the watch is minimalistic, and looks great in person. I've gotten more compliments on this watch than anything else I own. Unlike a lot of other fashion watch brands that have popped up recently, the BUREI watches are pretty reasonably priced. Watch works well, mine only loses a few seconds each week or so.<br /><br />I have a few minor complaints though:<br />The watch face is a bit easy to scratch or nick. I'm not careful with my watch by any means, but after about a year of wearing the watch I've managed to accumulate around 8 scratches/nicks on the front glass.<br />I've also had to change the strap. The strap is initially quite stiff, but with more use it seems like parts of the strap were pretty dried out, which resulted in the strap breaking.<br /><br />Overall the watch is a great deal, and has been super useful."
4.0,"Very nice and classy Jumpsuit. I'm 5&#34;7' 153 lbs, I ordered a medium and it fit perfect; I was pleasantly surprise that the length hit my feet so perfect for heels. Beautiful. I didn't give it a 5 star because it came packaged very very wrinkled."
4.0,"Light, comfortable ,easy to put it on and take off. Not waterproof.  More like water resistant."
4.0,"Good size, but the fabric looks a lot faker than one would have thought based on the pictures, other than that I really like it!"
4.0,Very cute mixture
4.0,Cute Belt. Fits me and my stepdaughter and we are three sizes difference.
4.0,"Appears to be a well-made bra, however, it's not the shape I am.  I will wear occasionally under some clothing,. I think would be a very good bra for some women."
4.0,Good product. Nice. Design is on spot on.
4.0,"Super Cute Bracelet. Great Price. But the owls are upside down. Luckily I make jewelry so I can fix it. For the price, this is still a great deal!"
4.0,"Nice material, good quality of sewing. Wrong size. Order up a size and you should be fine."
4.0,"I thought it was a little big, but she absolutely loved it! At least it will fit her for a few years. The fabric was soft and stretchy and held up through two long days of play and the washing machine already which is a good sign!"
4.0,Super cute outfit! I’m 5’4 and 116 lbs and I ordered a small.
4.0,Pretty blue color
4.0,This item fit perfect I sized up for a baggier loose fit like in the images (I got an XL) and it all fit very well and was very comfortable however when on it looked like I had on cute scrubs… not exactly the look I was going for.
4.0,"Nice fit, stretchy, not too thin. Wore it without a bodyshaper and was not worried about it being see through. Perfect business casual dress for work. Can be dressed up or down."
4.0,"More like tights then leggings when it comes to how they are made and the fabric. I wont have my kids wear these with tshirts, only dresses.<br />Soft material. Very stretchy. So should be able to wear for a very long time. All around decent but not quite what I expected."
4.0,"Great fit, good product!"
4.0,"The gloves were a bit thicker than I anticipated. I’m actually returning them but will order more gloves from the same company. Theyre GREAT quality though, just actual winter gloves and I wanted more casual gloves."
4.0,"I love these dresses.  I always know what I'm getting and the prices are amazing.  Caring for them is easy, too."
4.0,"I use these primarily for jogging and they are great because they are very lightweight and let the moisture escape.  They fit my shoulders well but I find them to be a little wide around the waist and would order a size down the next time, but since I have three I expect these to last a while."
4.0,Like the color. Fits good. true to size. Great breast support. Small unstitching after 2 uses.
4.0,It’s very cute! Would probably be cuter if I was smaller. But that’s not the dresses fault! LOL  I’m happy with it.
4.0,Get a size up. They're tiny and the bottoms are plastic and slippery.
4.0,It's a p bright pink (hot pinkish) and goes up to mid thigh (I'm ~5'4). Kinda thin material but it's soft.
4.0,"Very tight and hard to put on/get out of, but does wonders."
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and the dress was long enough to reach the ground. The only issue I had was that I wore short 2&#34; heels and I kept tripping over the front, ripping the black tulle fabric. If you're more graceful than me, I highly reccomend this! If you are more on the clumsy side, try slightly higher heels :)"
4.0,"Love the design, light material and good for summer days and or nights."
4.0,"Very comfortable. Lounging around or running to the store, its great.<br />Definitely need to wear a tighter  tank underneath for its very open."
4.0,"I  bought this for a dinner and it was perfect. good fit and flair, I was pleasantly surprised."
4.0,I ordered a bugger size as described and it for just right
4.0,"These were a bit snug on me, so I won't be wearing them unless I lose a little weight.  The are very lightweight and would probably dry off almost instantly.  The zippered pockets are very nice -  which was the main point of interest for me.  Its too bad they didn't fit because they would've been a nice pair of summer shorts,"
4.0,It was a little small for my husband he has a extremely large head I can wear a kids hat Or regular do not buy if you're buying for someone with a head the size of a watermelon
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Wore it for my baby shower. Looked great. Just slightly transparent, but you can wear a slip under it. Happy with my purchase"
4.0,"This was a gift for an older gentlemen.  He loved it, and was able to buckle it easily. Very good for the price."
4.0,I bought for someone
4.0,True to size.. I like them very much. Will slip off easily
4.0,Bought it to minimize sun exposure and it has worked. Compromise between short sleeve cool and long sleeve protection.
4.0,"Super comfy. Top ran a tad bigger than expected. Overall, really liked this product. I ordered a medium. I’m 5’9, 148lbs."
4.0,"Very cute casual outfit.  Material is very soft,  Shirt is cut a little small so I would suggest sizing up if you are heavier up top.  I'm a regular size 12 and ordered an XL."
4.0,wear this hat a lot....fabric is good
4.0,"These are nice, quality t-shirts.  Upon receiving these, I had my son try them on before washing.  They fit just fine.  Not too big and not too small.  I then washed them.  After washing, they did NOT shrink.  They held their shape nicely and didn’t look faded or dingy when they came out.<br /><br />The white shirt with the food on it is very cute, however; this certain shirt is made of very thin material.  You can see through it.  To me, that makes it look a bit cheap.  The rest of the shirts were made of a thicker material and seemed more sturdy.<br /><br />Two of the shirts had cute designs of food items on them.  My little guy thinks clothes with food are fun and he really enjoyed them.  They also came with one solid red and one solid green.  They are nice, bright colors and they look great on.  They are very vivid.<br /><br />I think the 4 pack of shirts are a great deal for the type and quality (minus the white one) and the price.  It is definitely worth the buying them."
4.0,These are super cute the only thing I don’t like is that they unscrew from the bottom which is a little difficult with some
4.0,"This chain is highly polished and attractive.  For a guy my size, it's a bit thin in size, but was too expensive to get beyond 2mm in width.  I like it well enough, but I think for the price I paid, I should have been able to get it in a 3mm or even 4mm width."
4.0,"For size reference. I usually wear a 38S for my suit jackets, 32-33 for my shirt sleeve length. I bought US size small. the fit of the arms and chest were fine, particularly when worn over a thin shirt. the shoulders were a bit narrow. however, not sure now US size M would fit, as the sleeves might be a bit long.<br /><br />the polyester jacket lining was a bit noisy when you are moving about. I might give it a lower rating if it didn't otherwise look so good...though my wife was more iffy on the style. she felt it was too much Asia Mafia look."
4.0,"This is a cute fascinator, but it is definitely not as big as it looks in the pictures.  The mannequin head used for size reference in the ad is more of a representation of a child's head, in my opinion.  I will say it is of good quality and came packaged nicely.  It comes on a headband that is BLACK.  So, if you are buying a white one to match an outfit, you may want to purchase another headband to transfer it to if you think that will clash with your outfit.  It does have a barrette on the back, so you can use it without the headband...and therefore it can easily be transferred to another headband in the color you choose.  I purchased this to use as an embellishment for a hat I was constructing myself for a Kentucky Derby Party.  There was a delay in shipping, so it did not arrive in time.  That is the only reason why I returned it (It was no longer needed).  It would have worked well as an embellishment, however, solely as a fascinator, it would have been too small...that is the only reason I do not give it 5 stars.  I want others to be aware of this before they buy for an event."
4.0,Love these they fit great but they are not true black. Lighter than normal black which is frustrating if that’s the only color you wear
4.0,runs small I wear a lg and got an xxl. I knew this from the reviews. I do lke the way they feel and they wash nice
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:fe527f5239186611cfda1d69e5f5277e]] This is a great value for this type of socks. The package contained 6 pairs (12 individual socks). I received the black color.<br />The socks are very stretchy and on the thinner side, which is nice to keep from slipping. The back of the heel is reinforced with silicone to help keep the heel from slipping down, which is the equivalent of stepping in gum = ANNOYING!<br />I am a size 9 - 9 1/2 and these fit me very slightly large. And since they are thin and stretchy I imagine they would fit anyone from size 7  - 11 1/2 in women's.<br />These socks washed very well and showed no signs of unraveling or weird shrinkage and I feel like they will hold up for many wears and washes.<br />The only con about these socks is that they are cut a bit too high on the top of the foot. I had wanted them to wear with ballet flats and They won't work for that. They will be fine with high cut loafers, boat shoes and men's style dress shoes.<br />These are great socks all around....... if you aren't trying to wear them with ballet flats.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. This does not change my opinion of this product in any way. My reviews are for the consumer and have not been"
4.0,"When we received this (the wrong color btw, the one we got was, as you can see, neon green) I thought that something was wrong. The ad says “Chemise dress” and the box said “Socks”.<br /><br />When we opened the box we understood why it said “socks” and when my wife tried it on, also why it is one size fits all. I think that some larger women may have an issue with it stretching so much that the holes in netting get so large that there’s absolutely nothing left to the imagination; not that there’s much left even on a smaller woman. My wife, 5’ and 125 lbs, had to struggle to get it over her. But still, I see why it’s one size fits all.<br /><br />It’s not the best quality but for the price, it’s surprisingly decent. If worn outside, this should be worn either under a button-down top or with a sports bra under it.<br /><br />My wife actually liked it, especially to be worn under a button-down blouse. She was not crazy about the color but she’ll probably buy a white, red or black. Her only complaint was that the neck was a bit tight so that makes me wonder whether the neck will be too tight on a larger woman.<br /><br />Review of: LEMON GIRL Women Fishnet Lingerie Babydoll Bodysuit"
4.0,"I bought this shirt as sort of a joke for my spouse who mentioned wanting a bowling or Hawaiian shirt. It is just a printed shirt - meaning the color doesn't permeate the fabric - but it is printed nicely and the edges of the design are sharp. My only reason for deducting 1 star is because I viewed this shirt on various monitors and the main color looks to be a light sage green color, but the shirt I received is a powder blue.  I'm not really upset about it since the shirt is kind of a joke gift, but the person I bought it for already has a lot of shirts that are the same blue color and I wanted something more green.<br /><br />Update: My spouse does really like this shirt. It washes up well and wrinkle free, and looks good over a tank top or something. After a few wears on a cruise, it still looked really nice. Note that you may want to use a cool iron on it in the beginning to get some of the creases out from packaging. I think I'll be ordering one for myself."
4.0,Very different. I like it. However I wear a size 12 and it fits just right. But for a plus size woman I think it would have to stretch quite a bit and perhaps the dramatic pattern would be distorted. And a small or petite woman would swim in it.
4.0,"This watch, for the very cheap price, is a ridiculously good value. It looks like it costs 10X what it dis. After 2 months, running perfectly."
4.0,Great Accessory. Sits a little loosely on the ear but actually looks great.
4.0,Decent tie/pocket square/cufflinks for the price. The color was exactly as pictured so I was happy about that!
4.0,"I liked my BAGGU bag, I wish it had a snap or something similar so I could close the top.  I really liked the size."
4.0,"The color of this dress is gorgeous and just like the photo. The dress does seem a little larger and longer than I would expect, but I'm also 5'0&#34; so it may be the perfect length for someone taller. I still wear it with wedges, and it is very comfortable and cool - perfect for summer!"
4.0,"This shirt took a long time to arrive, but it's better than I expected. Nice material, cute pattern, and a flattering fit. And it reminds me of Hitchcock's The Birds. I gave it 4 stars not 5 because I ordered a M based on the size chart (34&#34; chest and122 lbs.) and it's a bit too big."
4.0,The only reason I didn’t give a 5 star is because some of them I had to get needle nose pliers and put the pieces together. Once I did that on 3 pair they were perfect!
4.0,"this crop top was great for my high waisted maxi! I wear a size 6 and the crop top fit great but a little more loose in the waist than pictured. Overall though, comfortable, cute and looks as pictured!"
4.0,"Fits, very stretchy!"
4.0,Print not so vibrant
4.0,These are super cute and the price is right but they are not soft and thick.  They are thin and stretchy.
4.0,"Got the dress for a night out in Vegas.  I thought the waist was lacking and bought a belt (from Amazon. Also bought a matching mask from amazon!)  to make it have a more fitted and interesting look.  I actually bought a medium and a large To see which would fit better.  The only differences seemed to be the was medium was tighter across the chest and was an inch shorter.  I usually were a large but the medium fit me better. It was very comfortable,  got a lot of compliments and appears to be good quality.  I liked the way it looked.  The neckline was slightly higher than I expected (on both dresses) but was fine.  Cons... after several hours of wear and a lot of walking,  it did scratch under my arms from them rubbing as I swung arms walking around.  If you are just sitting at a wedding or fancy dinner it would be fine.  It didn't start bothering me for several hours.  Also it needed ironing upon arrival but days not to iron.  I put a towel over it and used steam iron. It worked ok."
4.0,Very nice for wearing to work and getting into the Fall spirit.
4.0,"Nice looking shoe, especially for the price.  It arrived quickly and I was happy with the purchase.  It was a bit small for me, but I think my feet are getting bigger, not that the shoe's to small!"
4.0,I needed it for a show and it is great and washes well.
4.0,"Color, fit and material is great."
4.0,"It fit as expected, very nice."
4.0,"This dress is really good quality for the price. It definitely fits true to size- if not a little big. When I order from amazon, I typically go for an xl because the sizing is often much smaller than expected, and I have a large chest which makes it a bit of a crap shoot to order my typical size L. I ordered xl and it is too big. All the same, it is a. Nice dress and defines my waist well- which is important for an hour glass shape."
4.0,"This is my first dress from this brand so I was bracing myself to be disappointed and return it. Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised. It’s a good fit and very classic, can easily be dressed up or down, perfect for the office. I bought a size L and I’m 5’4, 148lb, 38/32/43. It’s a touch loose in places, but that’s what I was going for when I selected my size. It has creases sewn in so that it sits right and isn’t overly structured. The fabric is a touch more casual than the ponte fabric of other dresses sold by similar brands, but still thick and stretchy. I think I’ll be buying more colors in this dress."
4.0,Ordered for my friend who has been apprenticing for a year. I didn’t get to see it because I sent it to her house an hour away but she said it’s awesome! She said the tattoo machine is correct and it looks like you could plug it in and use it haha. Only maybe con was she thinks it is rather big for a necklace so she’s planning on turning it into a pin/broch to wear on her shirts etc.<br />She said it’s well made
4.0,I received this watch for Christmas and love it.  The only problem that made it not a five star rating was that the leather band was too short.  Otherwise a good value for fashion watch.
4.0,Good quality but it was not supposed to be long
4.0,"Great skirt for work, the material has a little sheen to it which makes it look professional.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Great long length (I'm 5'7 and I wear it very high on my waist and it still hits just below the knees)<br />-Heavy fabric with little cling<br />-Flattering fit<br />-Wide waist band without drawing unnecessary attention<br />-Soft and comfortable<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Hand wash only<br /><br />I love this skirt, either with a little top tucked in and a blazer or on its own with a blouse. I bought one in gray and one in navy and I think it's found its way into my work staples."
4.0,"I really like this, I can wear it all the time,"
4.0,"The gloves are pretty thin which allows for better dexterity, but also means they probably won't keep your hands very warm for as long as a thicker glove might. However, they do serve their purpose in winter temps. As for fit, the hand slides in smoothly. The fleece lining is comfortable. The zipper around the wrist is added comfort and helps the gloves fit nice and snug. The glove seems to be made of quality materials and construction, and I feel like it will last a few winters. Compared to other &#34;waterproof&#34; products this one doesn't seem to be the same. I find them to be more water resistant than waterproof. Maybe another pair would work different. Overall I am pretty satisfied with this product.<br /><br />Please note I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"soooo soft, love the design, comfortable."
4.0,my son already broke his first pair... bummed
4.0,Did not have a good experience.
4.0,"The necklace is much more brass color and I think maybe a couple of the jump rings MIGHT be missing (or one small section became &#34;unsoldered&#34; but it looks like it is easily fixable with a small jump ring.  For the price I'm really quite pleased and I think it will certainly be seen as unique among my friends.  Again, knowing this is costume jewelry I didn't expect it to look super expensive so I'm pleased with what I've gotten.  Delivery was much faster than expected and I would definitely recommend this company based on the other three pieces I got from them.  The other pieces are really &#34;loved it&#34; pieces.  Will write the reviews for them now."
4.0,I like it but I need a little more coordination to use it. I’m sure it’s me and not the product. Lol
4.0,Beautiful and nicely packaged.
4.0,It’s good for summer coz the material is not so thick. Thanks!
4.0,This hat is so soft and comfortable! I thought it’s was going to be super slouchy from the photos. I didn’t know if I would like it if that was the case. It actually wasn’t as long or as slouchy. I happened to have over four friends when it arrived. Everyone tried it on everyone commented on how comfortable it was and it really did look great on everyone!
4.0,"These are so cute! I bought these to sell with outfits,  I haven't worn myself so I can't comment on durability"
4.0,"Cheap , color changed easily"
4.0,It was like i expected it.  It was very pretty on and fit well. You have to add nice shoes to it because the material is cheap to me. You pay for what you get.  Overall the dress looked cute on me
4.0,Love them really. My son and i split the order and we both have been happy with the look and comfort.
4.0,A bit large but very nicec and comfortable. I really like it very much
4.0,The winder works great on my Cartier however the plug keeps coming undone. It is too lose and and it keeps coming undone. I find it quite annoying. Maybe it's a defective one. Anyway the price is right and the mechanism works great. I've had it for over 8 months now. If it wasn't for the adaptor issue I would rate it a full 5 stars.
4.0,"I was expecting it to be a little more heavy duty, but so far so good and it looks great on my car."
4.0,"The outfit is cute and it IS fluffy (aka no need to buy a petticoat). It fits me well and does show my curve and legs (I'm petite), except for the white strings are way too long but not a huge deal, I fixed that. The hood is pretty small and awkward in a way when I wore it. Beside the red velvet part, the material is cheap obviously, after a wash, the bow drops out but what else can you ask for a price like this?"
4.0,"This mask is made very well, and I really like it. It is comfortable too. But, it is smaller than appears in this photo."
4.0,"It's a great dress for the money but not as flattering on me as I would have liked. (I suspect that's my tummy's fault and not the dress.) Material is silky and a bit clingy but not flimsy. On the downside, refund for return took WAY longer than it should have."
4.0,Cute but thin material.
4.0,"Looks like something swanky, say, O.J., would own and pass it off as really expensive.  Nephew is a big shot in school because of this nice watch!"
4.0,Really nice hat. I was caught off guard because only the red letter &#34;I&#34; is embroidered. The rest of the lettering is screenprinted. But still a sharp hat nonetheless.
4.0,"Pretty top, and I really like the hemline."
4.0,This is a nice tie.  I'm satisfied with this purchase.  A very inexpensive addition to wardrobe.  BE AWARE THIS TIE HAS A MORE LAVENDER HUE THAN PICTURED.
4.0,"Cute, small and colorful"
4.0,"I just got them today, so I can't say a lot. As attractive as expected, perfect amount of sun block for me. They fit well."
4.0,It's a good stone but bigger in size but it's beautiful
4.0,Can be a time saver. Good for forming an initial shape and sometimes for a simple final shape depending on what you're trying to achieve. Wish it were a tad wider.
4.0,"I am a 34B and I ordered an extra small after reading an answer from the seller posted by someone else with the same chest size. It fits nicely except for the strap that goes around my upper abdomen, that part is just a little too snug. Every other part fits correctly so I didn't return and ask for a size up, so I guess I just need to go to the gym more.<br /><br />Anyway, I feel sexy in it and the boyfriend likes it."
4.0,"Nice bag.  Good quality for the price.  Only issue I had was, it shows as being large enough to hold iPad.  It is, barely, but you can't zip it closed with the iPad in it.  Other than that I'm very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Bought these because a lot of the trails near me are overgrown with poison oak. I hate poison oak and I hate committing to pants. These protected me from the poison oak and are lightweight, and the zip off legs are obviously the bonus."
4.0,Loooveee it only thing is at the top its kinda loose where the gold bar is
4.0,"These are very nice quality but keep in mind the bears are laser etched---not engraved. And the bears are on the small side. I have another bracelet with four bears that are engraved and are bigger but it is an aluminum band. This is the only one I could find with six cubs....so I am keeping it!<br /><br />The metal itself is very nice but keep in mind....it doesn't bend as easily like aluminum. My other bracelet is aluminum and is much easier getting on and off.<br /><br />This bracelet is a very nice quality. I am keeping mine in spite of the above two ""issues""."
4.0,fit my needs and my small head perfectly
4.0,"It fits true to size, got a medium—5’2”, 125lbs.  The material is thin and it doesn’t stay off the shoulder so I returned it."
4.0,"Good quality, the wallet is very sturdy and looks very nice."
4.0,"This was purchased from a Baby Registry that was Babies R Us Store, however Amazon<br />Offered this bag so much cheaper always a plus!!  The bag was well made and very functional<br />And very attractive!!  Mommy-to-be loved it!!"
4.0,"They were fun, actually better than I thought they would be."
4.0,"Super cute and very flattering. The skirt material is actually fairly heavy and nice.<br /><br />The downside is that the sleeves on mine were just a bit off. Like they were not quite sewn correctly. It's not noticeable and I'm sure each one is a little different so you may or may not have the same issue. Still, for the price I would buy it again."
4.0,"I get a bunch of comments on these socks even as simple as they are. A couple of them have holes after a few months of use and they don't stay up as well as I'd like (large calves, most socks don't stay up), but they're still comfortable!"
4.0,"I purchased these earrings a year or two ago, and I just love them.  I wear them every day and don't even have to take them off when I sleep.  The etruscan style is very unique and makes them appear more expensive than they were.  They look heavy, but they are actually hollow, so they feel very comfortable.  The only concern would be if you have unusually plump earlobes, because it has to fit in between the two sides where the pin goes in the ear lobe.<br /><br />If I could find them again, I would buy another pair.  At the time, they were available in 18K and 14K, but I preferred the etruscan design on the 14K pair better than the 18K.  Now I wish I had purchased an 18K pair, and another 14K pair."
4.0,"The PJ is beautifully made, definately a good quality. The pants are a different material than the top. I had to return mine because the descriptions stated to order a size down if between sizes due to them running large. I did so but found that not to be the case. I like my PJs comfy not tight. They fitted tight. Also keeping  in mind that the PJ would shrink a little after washing. Unfortunately  they are completely  out of stock or I would have exchanged them.  If I would have ordered my regular size I d be wearing them now. Hopefully they will restock again."
4.0,Holding up very well. I will buy more perhaps.
4.0,Ok for what they are. As described. The spring clip type are better.
4.0,This is a cute top that is thick enough to wear alone but thin enough to wear with a tank top underneath. I like the overlapping front and the fact that it is on the long side. It's very flattering too!
4.0,"These are super cute, but they’re not as darkly tinted as I was expecting. Perfect for the evening though when it’s not super bright out but enough people sensitive to light need some shades. The listing also said they are 52 mm but they’re the same size as my 50mm sunglasses, which is actually a plus for me since I prefer 50mm. They are very lightweight but clear and the nose pieces are very comfortable. I’d still like a darker pair but I am satisfied with these."
4.0,Not quite as nice as the puma 110 hat.
4.0,"very pretty, but smaller than I expected."
4.0,"Overall very good for the price. Shirts are comfortable. Fit is a bit on the small size, but not way off. If you've ever found a large cotton shirt to be too small, order the XL here. Not sure about the anti-odor properties claimed as I don't see any improvement there compared to other shirts. I will say the shirts look great. No logo, so that's cool. Look more expensive than they are. Overall I'm happy with them especially considering the price point. 4stars"
4.0,Decent price and perfect for the occasion runs a little small
4.0,"Comfortable,  easy to layer. Looking forward to wearing for summer dress."
4.0,"Beautiful ring. Love it so much. The only downfall is that the toes have been cutting my finger.. like if im doing house cleaning and I accidentally get it caught the toes will ride into my finger, cutting me.. but besides that it is like the perfect mother ring"
4.0,"Have not had the opportunity to use this awesome umbrella, it will be put to the test after Irma passes.....lots and lots of rain."
4.0,"My daughter had a similar dress in the past that she loved that we found at the Salvation Army. I was surprised and happy when I came across the same cat pattern on Amazon so we ordered it right away. My daughter is 11 years old and we ordered the next size up for 12 and 13 year old. Despite ordering a size up, it looked like it fit snug, like a bathing suit, but she said it didn't feel tight. I was disappointed in the very thin swimsuit like material, since the first dress we found at the Salvation Army was made up of a little bit thicker polyester.  We are keeping it anyway because she likes it and that's what matters."
4.0,Read reviews and originally ordered the XL had to send back for XXL.  Really look at size chart it’s accurate and the chest size matters.  With that said it’s super cute and I received compliments.  Return and reorder was super fast and easy.
4.0,"Very cool! The ring, to pull out the pin, is really thin plastic and broke right away. It's still functional and works great! It was a big hit at our birthday party!"
4.0,"This bag is very nice and designed to hold many items...clothes and accessories.  Very usable pockets and compartments.  I was disappointed in the color as it was not as shown.  There was an added pink to the bag that was not pictured, nor a written description of the color scheme.  I went by what was pictured.  It is a beautiful bag and I did keep it!"
4.0,"Please measure before you buy seriously don't be dumb.<br />fits fine, thin material but love the way it feels."
4.0,"Love this gown and it's a great fit for my curbs love the material, expands with your body. Can't wait to wear it . It also arrived on time exactly when it was promised. I recommend it!"
4.0,"I bought these because they were similar to Gucci Shield two tone sunglasses that I had my eye on at the sunglasses hut. Where Gucci sunglasses were $400, these were $14. Obviously the material isn't as nice, but these look-a-likes work just as well. These do scratch easily, which is why I didn't leave 5 stars. The first pic are the Guccis, the second pic is the pair I bought from here."
4.0,Nice for an inexpensive watch
4.0,Very nice product. It feels good to wear and I have been given a lot of compliments on the stone/jewelry. I gave 4 stars because it could be a tad bit bigger. Other than that it’s a great buy.
4.0,great shirt. fits well. just a tad on larger size and that is okay.
4.0,"Wore it at my wedding, and it looked and fit great!"
4.0,"This is a really nice shirt. I'm a huge king of the hill fan. Taste the meat, not the heat. :-)"
4.0,Soild
4.0,"It is really nice, soft texture, however where it cuts up in the side goes a bit too high for my taste, I can't wear spandex or anything underneath because it shows so I just have to be careful of where i wear it to and how i walk and sit and stuff"
4.0,I love this! I've gotten so many compliments on it when I wear it. The product looks exactly as it does in the pics and great price!!
4.0,It’s actually cuter in person and it looks quality made thanks ... ps save the freakin bees
4.0,"Very pretty and lightweight on the ears, but when I took them out the package a stone was missing.  Luckily it was floating around in the package.  So that’s why I only gave them a four star."
4.0,"Exactly what I wanted, little, comfortable, hypoallergenic hoops for cartilage piercing. I have them in silver and gold so I can match other jewelry, but tjeyre food enough to leave on all the time. They pricy for a non-name tiny piece of basically unornamented metal, but I get a lot of use, and these look nice and don't cause problems, so I think theyre worth it. They shipped and arrived as promised, with a little pouch."
4.0,Color exactly like picture.
4.0,So cute. Fits great. 4 starts instead of 5 only because the cotton isn't as soft as I'd like. Maybe it will lighten over time? Still a go to for leg day ;)
4.0,"Very pretty, looks just like the picture."
4.0,"My nipples show through a little bit.  Material is a bit too thin for long, large prominent nipples."
4.0,Good quality. Goes with anything.
4.0,I really like the style and color of this maxi dress.  I tried 3 times to buy this dress so it would fit but all three were either too big or too small.
4.0,"I am 5'1&#34; and 123 lbs. I purchased a large because I like my clothes roomy and casual. I never want to worry about shrinkage. I can throw this in the washer and dryer and it still looks great. I dressy outfit for Christmas and I am going to use it for Valentine's day next month. I was hoping the Kansas City Chiefs would have done better for even more red attire requirements, but maybe next year..."
4.0,"Overall, the robe is pretty. I ordered the purple and the colors are bright and vibrant. However, I returned it due to it being too large. I ordered a medium and it was very large and virtually shapeless and uncomplimentary on me. I typically wear an 8/10 and am 155. Pretty robe, but shapeless if that makes sense."
4.0,"I like this one, but its runs a little small, and I can wear a tight all day. So I advise going up a size, especially for newbies.  This one is really tight and I've had several different kinds and been doing this for several years. Getting the wrong size can be very uncomfortable"
4.0,"Easy to put on and take off. Son uses it during wrestling practice and notices a difference in how much more he sweats with it on, shedding a few extra pounds."
4.0,Didn't fit pretty though
4.0,"It's soft, looks like the picture but, it's is not loose fitting."
4.0,Buy a size larger than you think you need. These run small. Otherwise great shoes.
4.0,Great T-shirt great color
4.0,kept 4 gave 4 away.  they were decent quality/ not at all expensive.
4.0,"Fit but a bit too large.  It does the job where none other would.<br />Good product, price, and service. Thanks"
4.0,Well it pushed the girls up that's for sure.. But it was a little to big.  Will order again but the next size down.
4.0,"The picture is deceiving in that it shows 5 colors. The customer will only receive one. Given the price point, one might consider selecting a different product with more than one pair. Product itself works well, despite having to reread instructions provided in order to place into shoe properly."
4.0,I really like this watch band but it doesn't seem sturdy. The buckle indents the fabric and makes it seem like any moment the fabric might start to break. One of the loops to keep the excess band close to the wrist is flimsy and doesn't stay put either.  I do like the color and the feel though. I definitely will be keeping it until it inevitably breaks.
4.0,"Fresh look,kool for out & in doors"
4.0,"I give this dress 4 stars because it is a very nice dress from Novica. 100% cotton, great for a hot sunny day. However it fit me funny. The bust was too small and the body too big. I think the monitor skewed the pattern as I thought the print would be smaller. The flowers and ruffles are a little too big in person for my taste.  In general, Novica gets 5 stars in my book, I just didn't care for the pattern once I got it. The background looks more white to creamy on the screen, but in person it is an ecru to beige. Sad to have to return it, couldn't find a home for it."
4.0,Fits good nice graphics
4.0,The size is too big.  You need to cut it in half or in fourths.
4.0,Muy bonito diseño pero muy grandes y anchas
4.0,Love . Love . Love .
4.0,Nice Hand craft work
4.0,WAY too small. I couldn’t even get it on. I’m 5’9 159lbs/ 36C. I’m between an 8 and 10 in clothes. This is more like a small. I would order at least 2 sizes up. I love the other qualities of the dress. Very pretty.
4.0,They're cute and they fit just fine
4.0,"First of all, if you were buying because you like the pink in this assortment, don’t. It is more of an orange sherbet color… Definitely not pink.<br /><br />I thought I loved the idea of an elastic band for my Apple Watch, however I found it difficult to get the band big enough to go over my hand and be small enough for my small wrist.  There was too much adjustment needed once I had it on, which eliminated what I was hoping would be the ease I was achieving by having a slip on band."
4.0,"This white women's soft midi-dress is nice and breezy. This is a great summer dress, that is good to wear on casual outings, events, or picnics. Overall this is a nice, good quality dress."
4.0,Great cover for the back rolls but the straps broke. Haven’t been able to wear it since
4.0,Can't even tell I have them on which is great. They are very cute with great designs.
4.0,The blouse looks as expected and is of nice quality but it is somewhat smaller than the size expected to be so I would go one size up from your actual size to ensure a good fit.
4.0,"Color was brighter then I thought it would be, bit overall it is comfy. It was a little big, bit I don't mind I like my shirts on the baggy side."
4.0,These inspirational word charms were exactly what I was looking for at a great price. I would definitely purchase them again.
4.0,Bought these to hold these masks to keep them from falling off and to hold them in place when my family does not have to wear them while we are out. They do the trick. Keep the mask from falling to the ground. They ensure that the mask doesn't get lost. Work as intended.
4.0,Comfy house
4.0,"The band is really nice: good looking and stylish. Easy to remove but the pins are loose, not attached to anything so I'm afraid when the band is not being worn, the pins can be easily lost. The first one came with a scuff on the black part which tells me it will probably scratch easily. The company has great customer service and quickly responded and sent a new one."
4.0,"not all of the charms had a matching piece! other than that, i totally loved them!! i made cute little earrings with the ones that had matches(: it was a little disappointing that some didn’t have a match and others had multiple pairs."
4.0,Super comfortable but run really big. Even exchanged for a smaller size and they were the same size with a different sticker...going for round 3 cause they are really comfortable lol
4.0,These were a great addition to our party favor bags to a LEGO themed birthday party. One of the chains came broken. I returned it without any problems and received another one right away. The Lego pieces are a little larger than I had expected but still a fun piece.
4.0,Good socks.  Stitching a bit weak attaching sole.
4.0,Normally I wear a small but I ordered a medium as I didn't want it skin tight but the medium was still pretty snug. You'll need a slip if you don't want all your under garments lines to show.
4.0,"Some small touches set this shirt apart from your usual lightweight chambray shirts. The collar is thinner than standard oxford shirts and there’s a contrasting stripe at the pocket. These work for me but might not be to everyone’s liking. Also, the sleeves have a button and tab band for rolling up. The fit is probably your average fit as opposed to a slim or husky fit.  And sleeve length works for an average person but I think anyone with longer arms might find them a bit short. I really like the orange color -  it’s a kind of light orange sherbet shade that is perfect for summer. The fabric is slightly thinner than other chambray shirts that I have, making it suitable for warmer weather and climates.  If you’re looking for a traditional button-down oxford this obviously is not it but it’s nice once in a while to have something a little different."
4.0,"Packable small backpack. I used for few hikes, no complains."
4.0,Cute but it was torn when I received it so I returned it.
4.0,"Please, except for the liner - not a fan of the material"
4.0,"Not easy to wash. I came with a slight smell not a big deal I washed it first. I then realized that you can’t dry clean, put it in the dryer, or iron it. So I air dried it for a bit the. Put it out to hang dry the rest of the way. Came out great. Looks good on. I usually just like stuff that is easy to wash so I took off a star. I’ll update after I’ve worn it a few times."
4.0,Though it is 3xl tight around the arm
4.0,"The style is ok, but too long for me. They don't look as femme as they do in the pic, so I gave them to my nephew."
4.0,very nice material and
4.0,Was received quickly and as described.  Thank you!
4.0,"When I received this overbust corset I was amazed with the beautiful emerald color, simply stunning! The lace detail is exquisite and the back is adorned with a lovely satin lace ribbon. The eyelets are secure and the closure expands.  It also has a panel in the back so when you do expand the corset to make it bigger you are still seeing the beautiful emerald satin bodice. It also comes with the garters as well as a thong.<br />I will say that this runs very small so order a couple sizes up because I am a size 7 and the XL is too small for me. I was able to get it somewhat closed if I expanded the back as far as it will expand, but still the bra cups are way too small. Also, this is more of a costume corset rather than a waist training corset. If you are looking for a waist training corset, this is NOT the way to go. That being said, this is really a gorgeous overbust corset with a lot of attention to detail, especially the lace. It can be worn to parties, as a costume or just to spice things up in the bedroom.<br />Overall, it is a gorgeous overbust corset, just a little on the small side. I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I only wish I had read the reviews first before I ordered so would've gotten a bigger size. Other than that, it is very pretty and the emerald color really shimmers nicely."
4.0,This shirt is super cute and I love it on my husband. However a couple of times in the dryer and your decal begins to peel off ! So to keep it looking new wash it in cold water and don’t dry !! My husband and daughter throws everything in the dryer …. So his shirt has started peeling 🤦🏼‍♀️
4.0,I have very small wrists and like the fact that I can easily connect to my Fitbit. The bands that came with the Fitbit are difficult to connect unlike this product.
4.0,"I wish they had other styles, not a huge fan of this style but great glasses and on my third pair because I am so hard on them."
4.0,I wear a 38C and 4”10 and 143lb and ordered a medium it is to tight
4.0,The material texture is good.
4.0,"When Spring arrives I change my wardrobe into a lot of gauze and cotton tops and skirts. This bracelet goes with these outfits just like I thought it would.  I really need to add another jump ring on the clasp side to make it easier to use, it seems to spin the wrong way.  But for the price you can't beat this bracelet."
4.0,"Fast shipping. I'm 6'2"" and 225lbs. Normally wear 2xl tall. The 2xl I purchased was long enough in body and sleeves which I have a 37' sleeve length. Would not consider this shirt as slim, but it fit me just fine. Material was quite thin so I will need undershirt."
4.0,"I'm an hourglass shape, so it didn't look super flattering on me but I think if you're thin / and pencil-shaped it would look really good."
4.0,i ordered a size xl and it fits snug.  it has a little spandex for stretch which is good.  i was expecting to fit a little looser but i still like it.  im a plus size (1x/14-16).
4.0,My son is a Yankee fan so he really like them--he said they were excellent sunglasses . Made a excellent Christmas gift
4.0,Theyre a bit thin
4.0,"I like this skirt.  the little buttons did take a solid 5-10 minutes of extra time to button up, but really cute.  Order true to size. i am 5 ft. 7, 140 lbs, fit, normally a size 6 in pants, and a medium fit me well."
4.0,Thought this was silver but it's black and silver.  I still really like it though
4.0,I like the dress I like how it fit
4.0,"This is a really Cute 1 Piece Outfit/Romper! It has a 'Scrunched' Tube Top and Comfy/Flowy Pants! I really like the Outfit but the Top fits SO Small, I can hardly wear it! I'm Small Figured & Small Busted and ordered a Medium hoping for a little extra Room but the Top hardly covers my Chest!"
4.0,"I am 5''4&#34; tall and weigh about 120 pounds. I typically wear a US size 2 or a small/ medium in similar styles at retailers like Victoria's Secret, Kohls or JCPenney. The &#34;BeLuring Womens Lace Halter Lingerie Mesh Babydoll Sheer Nightwear Mini Dress&#34; is a one size fits all item.. It fits me very well. The bust is a halter style, made of the lace detailing, which is not adjustable. It fits snug in the chest and flairs open below, allowing for a comfortable fit for women of varying sizes and shapes. The babydoll hits just above the knees, like pictured on the model. The set includes a matching pair of panties. Together, this is a cute set to wear to bed. The see through nature of the top makes it a difficult sell for wearing around the house, but this is great for feeling sexy at bedtime.<br /><br />The material is soft synthetic blend. It is very easy to care for. I can wash and dry this garment with like colors on normal settings. The hems and lace detailing are well constructed and smooth and comfortable against the skin. The lace is not itchy. Unfortunately, there is a small stain right in the center of the v-neck of my item. I am hoping it comes out in the wash. It is very obvious since I ordered this item in white. I definitely recommend the &#34;BeLuring Womens Lace Halter Lingerie Mesh Babydoll Sheer Nightwear Mini Dress&#34; as a gift for yourself or the lady in your life. This is one of my most comfortable babydolls. Similar items at Victoria's Secret retail for $40+ and then you are charged shipping fees when ordering through their website. This item is $13 with shipping. It is Prime Eligible and arrives within 2 days. Overall, the price is unbeatable.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the &#34;helpful&#34; button!"
4.0,"In search for the perfect beanie and haven't found it yet, but I still like this one"
4.0,"Very big glasses and I love them. You can tell they are cheap when feeling them but just by looking at them, they ate stylish. I would recommend."
4.0,"I like the dress, but it fit a little too big for me. I should've order a Medium."
4.0,...then you should get this shirt. It's funny and cute and a nice addition to my &#34;Jeep&#34; stuff.
4.0,"Got a little tarnish, but overall a good product."
4.0,The leggings were VERY long - but I could pull them up to under my bra<br /><br />would have like a more true brown  and more colors<br /><br />all in all - Happy with purchase  Thank YOu.
4.0,A little bent
4.0,Great workout gear or just for everyday use.
4.0,These are super cute. Took it down a star as it stretches as u wear it so then they start to fall we had to add ear loops.
4.0,Love the &#34;Captain America&#34; pattern.  I find that Wrightsocks run small so I suggest checking their size chart before ordering.  (I have size 8.5 feet and wear large Wrightsocks.)
4.0,I really loved this it was really cute I bought them and there amazing keychains very soft aswell
4.0,Nice fit and just love the color of this jacket!
4.0,For the price this is a nice warm jacket.  Getting back into skiiing now that my kids want to and before I spend $300 wanted something decent and warm.  It is.  I wear a 48-50 jacket.  2XL fits just fine.  Jacket is less ‘sleek’ looking than photo.
4.0,It game very wrinkled
4.0,"Great fit, I'm a 16-18."
4.0,"I love these adorable shoes, more importantly my 20 month old son loves them. Parents  watch your children with them though because the nose of one came off after having them on for a few hours of normal wear."
4.0,"Very pretty. Rode up a bit and wasn’t very cute with the little waist tie.<br />5’2”, 140 lbs, size D bra, medium fit perfect"
4.0,A very comfortable comfortable and the design is unique
4.0,"Got my skirt today and am VERY impressed with the quality, richness in color/material and &#34;weight&#34; of product, considering the price.  I didn't give 5 stars because the skirt is very long (I am 5'4&#34; & purchased a large), so I can't wear it until I get it tailored/hemmed which may cost more than the skirt itself.<br />."
4.0,"Love these. Great look & fit for amazing price. Only reason not 5 stars is because I've only had them a week, so cannot comment on durability."
4.0,"Pendent is nice, but the chain is super cheap."
4.0,I love this but the shirt is very short.  Barely comes to my natural waist.
4.0,The ripped within 1 day of wearing wearing them. How they ripped no idea. Sat down and felt a breeze right after I heard a rip. Not cool specially since I had company and they ripped right at the crotch
4.0,"a little small, but ok for around the house. not for big boobs"
4.0,"Fit well, just didn't look that great on me. Still saved it as a future halloween costume (which is what I bought it for)."
4.0,The silicone coating fell off the connection clip while at work so be weary of that. Other than that the clock works great and is a nice way to keep objects off your wrist while working.
4.0,These are great little slippers. Very easy to wash and keep clean. Easy for little ones to put on and off - we've gone through a few different sizes now because she likes them so much.
4.0,"Very cute, but super sheer."
4.0,Love the look of these.. Not distracting at all..almost like thin jewelry.  Hope they hold up!
4.0,"They came in the mail quicker than expected, super comfy and super cute"
4.0,I like this mask. It is pretty soft and comfortable. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 is the length of the ends to tie around neck - could be a bit longer
4.0,"bought this for my mum, she says she likes it and it fits well"
4.0,"I love these stockings, even if they aren't my color &#34;nude&#34; at the top (I'm very brown and these are very...beige). I got a lot of compliments while wearing them."
4.0,"Finally. You get what you pay for! Wonderful quality, great heavyweight sweat shirt material, stitching better than I've ever seen  and smartly designed pockets with side entry that hug your body.<br />Only one  criticism that's not a deal breaker; the belt shrunk a little more than I would have expected after the first wash."
4.0,"I like it but I wear leggings underneath and a camisole.  If I was at the beach, yeah I'd wear it over my barging suit.  It's extremely thin.  I ordered a medium and a large. The medium just didn't around enough below the waist.  The large is ok because I can tighten it in the back. I'm 5'3, 125 lbs 36×27×36.  It's a little below the ankle in the large and a little above in the medium. I wear it around the house."
4.0,"This review is for the aquatic flames print. I ordered these, as well as black, and a peachy dessert legging. I've verified the purchase inseams on all of them to make certain I didn't mistakenly order.  The aquatic flames are in capri length. They were approx 16&#34; on the inseam, waist remained the same on all pair. There was a small wod of loose black threading in the exterior of the crotch, this looks to have no impact on other stitching.<br /><br />Colors on all are gorgeous.<br /><br />The material is soft and wonderful. The body fit is comfortable on all of them. (I'm 5'4&#34; 120 lbs)"
4.0,Even thoe these run a little bit small I am really pleased with them.  They look great and wash well!
4.0,Nice and seems like good quality.
4.0,"This is a lovely top that shapes me nicely. I got floral_b in XXL. I'm just under 5'10"" and around 215-220 lbs, currently wearing bra size 40C although I really need to move up to a larger cup size. Waist 36 inches. I've been looking for some nice summer tops that I can wear with jeans or with my exercise capri leggings. This certainly fits the bill. The extension of the neckline is a little weird because of the way it sits like halfway over your breast rather than under or over. But when situated properly, it's a nice and modest neckline. (Modest is not usually my preference but my girls are overtaking my shirts lately and I work in a respectable profession). The print is good at smoothing over lumps and the cut emphasizes my hourglass figure.<br /><br />The one thing that bothers me is the sleeves. They're a little weird. Not tight. But like they're fine as long as your arms are flat at your side but if you raise your arms to shoulder height, it raises the whole shirt up. Luckily, the tunic length prevents this from being a big problem. But not ideal since I plan to wear this to a music festival."
4.0,I actually really like the romper - I ordered size 4-5 for my 4 year old and it's huge! She's 46lbs and it will not fit correctly without alterations.  I'm seriously thinking about ordering a size down because overall for the price I think it's a unique looking romper.
4.0,"I'm 5'7 and 176 lbs, I'm thick at the shoulders are arms, I ordered an XL, the shoulder area and arms fit nice, the mid are is too big, I'm going to have it taken  in.  I think if I had ordered a Lg, the shoulder and arms would  be too tight.  I bought a Shirt clip to adjust the waist area from looking too wide, too big"
4.0,"Wanted to try this style and like it very much.  I am much better organized and it does not slip off my shoulder!  It was hard to pick a pattern, though, I was not really happy with any of them.  I would have paid more for a fabric I liked, but not happy the solid ones are so much more expensive."
4.0,Very fun hat for my son (4 years old)
4.0,"I had images, and they are lost.  But, I'll do my best.  I gave this to my mom today for a Mother's day gift and she loved it. I gave it 4 stars because it came with random crystals, just as shown, I thought it would give you an option at some point, but it didn't.  Luckily, I sell rhinestones and things so I had my children's birthstones to replace the other random stones with.<br /><br />This arrives in a great gift packaging and has a great mom/grandma saying that my mom just loved.  It's also a standard size, so change out the components to be whatever you'd like.  This is very similar to a popular jewelry line design.  And, various backgrounds and charms are available all over, which is cool, interchangeable.  I loved it for the gift.<br /><br />The charms were cute and the packaging was perfect for a mom gift for sure.  The pendant was sturdy, made of steel and closed via magnets. It was very nice quality and had a great feel to it.  The necklace was a big hit at a gift.  I received this product at a discount or for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  I did open the package and did replace the rhinestones with the proper ones.  And, I wish I could find the photos of it, it looks just like the image, however, mine had my own rhinestones in it.  The hinge is nice and sturdy and opening wasn't impossible, but wasn't overly easy so you won't lose the charms."
4.0,Cool set of gothic vintage rings. The amount of detail on each ring is striking. I really like them. The snake is my favorite. The only issue is I have quite thin fingers and some of the rings fit loosely.
4.0,Height of heel
4.0,"Super cute dress, fits small!  I'm 5'8&#34; 130lbs & I ordered a medium. Had to send it back & order a Large."
4.0,I bought for male friend who does lots of outdoor work. He loves the material and ability to wet when need but not drip down his face. Loved the colors too.
4.0,Adorable. The skirts waist is  constructed a bit funny. It overall looks good! My daughter got lots of compliments.
4.0,"Great purchase for the price.  Light weight but not see through as other reviewers indicated.  My only disappointment was the length. I’m 5’5”, size 14, ordered XL and it fit perfect except the length comes just below mid-calf."
4.0,"Super fun and cute dress. It’s something I can relax in or wear casually out to the store or any other place. It’s kind of a T-shirt type of material. Which is really comfortable.<br /><br /> It is pretty tight on me but I knew that it would be when I ordered. It’s something I plan on losing weight to fit better into. It is pretty forgiving though. The fabric hides quite a lot of flaws lol. Even hides my belly if your looking straight at me. Not so much if looking from the side hahha.<br /><br />It goes down pretty far but I still feel I should wear it with leggings or something under it. It is a really cute little dress and the hoodie part look adorable when you put it up. While it’s not heavy material it does do a good job of keeping me warm without getting to hot.<br /><br />It’s pretty sturdy I have washed it multiple times and it looks the same as the day I bought it. I especially like that I don’t need to do anything special with it in the wash. I wash it like any regular clothes. If you you are looking for something to relax in that is still fun this would be perfect.<br /><br />I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This does not affect the time, effort and integrity I put into a review that would be beneficial to any fellow customer. I have no relationship with sellers and manufacturers. I base all my reviews on quality, value, and personal experience of the product."
4.0,Came in a timely fashion nice for the price.
4.0,"cute and warm, would buy again! Couldn't find this style in shops anywhere around. was quite pleased with this for sure"
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34;, 115 lbs, I ordered the size 4. It fits perfectly. Very comfortable to wear. But the size on the coat is 16 though, don't understand why. Overall I like it."
4.0,would be nice if available in tan or brown as well
4.0,Not quite my husband's style but it it fits fairly true to size. I was given a discount for an honest opinion
4.0,Quality outstanding
4.0,Great product; just as described. A much cheaper alternative to original Oakley lenses. Fantastic fit. Wonderful customer service. Recommended.
4.0,"Massive.  Heavy.<br /><br />I suppose the three small stopwatch dials may have their uses, but are not really readable to my old eyes.  The  date window, at about 1X1.5 mm is ridiculously tiny.  The grey dial numerals, markings and hands do not contrast enough against the black background to be readable in twilight. The watch is not particularly accurate, mine runs a minute slow after about a week.<br /><br />No matter, I did not buy it for functional reasons.  As an old aviation fan, I find delight in flipping up my wrist and seeing something that could have come from an instrument panel.  Makes me feel like a kid, and I keep checking the time just because it feels sooo cool.  And I won't care when the inexpensive glass gets scratched, it'll just add character. When the very heavy-duty leather strap finally goes, I'll replace it with an olive drab fabric web strap and notch the cool factor up some more.  And no, I don't generally wear camouflage, or big manly boots or drive an enormous diesel pickup, this is just an accent to an otherwise mild, suburban wardrobe.<br /><br />I first saw an add for the $4K Bell and Ross that this watch emulates in the Sunday New York Times about 18 months ago, and knew I had to have it, but at that price it was out of the question.  I did not want to buy an illegal copy, deal with scammers, etc., so put the whole thing on hold, and finally saw this on Amazon, legal because it is made under the Republic brand, not under a fake Bell and Ross label. Personally, the label does not mean much to me, but the design does.<br /><br />It might make a great gift if you have the right person on your list, a man-child of a certain age who keeps looking at the sky and can tell you what kind of airplane just flew by."
4.0,"A friend of mine told me to order a size larger than what I wanted too..I shouldn't have..a little too big, but I love it nonetheless..fun dress to wear to Christmas and Christmas gatherings..Had a lot of compliments..Love the material..soft and flowy.."
4.0,"I like the dress.  I will order another size up.  All reviews doesn't apply to everyone.  I should have ordered my original size.  I went a size down based on reviews.  I'm top heavy, so I must allow for them first as not to be tight."
4.0,Darth Vader fans is a great add... Ok quality & warm
4.0,Beatuful
4.0,"I love this wallet. I'll buy it again. The material breaks down some after lots of use, no suprise. The inside is plastic, but hasn't fallen apart.<br />It's compact and I can get all my cards in it. So easy to find them. No room for money though. I bought a rectangular zip bag for my receipts, bills and change."
4.0,"These boots are great! They are very nice quality and fit as expected. If you have bigger calves, I wouldn't recommend them, however, because the stretchy part in the back does not stretch barely at all."
4.0,Perfect for cartilage piercings!
4.0,Great dress. Small size true to discription and brown color true to the pictures. Great fit- I’m 5’4 135lbs and it falls just above my knees. Love the pockets. Going to wear it with a belt/scarf or a short jacket to accentuate the waistline.
4.0,Very detailed. Love it only flaw like some wallet starts to peel.
4.0,"It's absolutely beautiful.  The only thing that I'm not happy about is that the structure is NOT THAT GREAT.  It does not have FEET ON THE BOTTOM TO PROTECT IT.  Flip flops all over the place.  It's ok,  but I have to have feet on my handbags, but to much trouble to return."
4.0,"This was exactly what I wanted for carrying my phone on the go, but it was too small for my Galaxy Note 9.  I gifted it to a friend with a smaller phone."
4.0,"The belt is good. The buckle is solid, a bit heavy for me. The latching mechanism is a bit tricky to release sometimes. But still a nice belt."
4.0,There is no nike logo on the left chest as show in pic. Other than that it's US size so if you are asian Mediun you should order US Small.
4.0,"Very nice bracelet, I would buy it again!!"
4.0,"Love the colors.  Wish they were not so tightly stitched to each other with cotton thread.  Hard to cut apart even with scissors.  Also, thinner and fan I like but time will tell if that’s bad or not."
4.0,"A little large, but I have a smaller head than average"
4.0,overall decent shorts. wish they had some stretch to them but comfortable enough.
4.0,nice however was surprised the hearts dont line up
4.0,"Wife loves it, enough said."
4.0,I am quite happy with my full reader glasses from Pyramex. Having 3 pair allows me to leave one at work while having 3 to use at home.
4.0,"These are large sunglasses which is good down in West Texas. They block the sun on the sides as well as directly in front. They are polarized as far as I can tell. They look good on. These aren't high end sunglasses and feel a little flimsy compared to name brands we already have. But as a spare pair to keep in the truck, these are fine."
4.0,Fits great and super comfortable. Hugs my thighs without my boys feeling cramped.
4.0,Worked like a charm keeps my watch safe
4.0,"Diving into a new hobby I wanted to stock up on supplies, seem like they'll fit my needs and not bad for the price"
4.0,It’s sore for a bit. But pretty sturdy considering I sneeze a lot 😂 but did you do have to get use to the weight of the magnet
4.0,"These shoes are absolutely beautiful, however they do run atleast a size larger than expected. I wear a size 7 and these were huge on my feet. They looked like they would fit a size 8 person. The heel is very high about 5 1/2 inches to be exact. They are somewhat comfortable however they are very high shoes, and I am truly not used to such high heels! But if you love high, then this is an adorable shoe to have. These shoes are made of great quality and with proper care will last you a long time! I received these shoes at a discounted rate for an honest review and I feel I could not be honest enough. They are excellent shoes however please make sure you order one size smaller."
4.0,Would have given 5 stars but stone fell out after only a week of wearing the ring.
4.0,"Bought it for my teenage daughter who does dance, Kung fu, boxing, and basketball.... basically very active. She lives in these sports bras. I used the other reviews as a guide to purchase the correct size and it worked out well. I wish the set was all shades/neutrals. The bright pink and blue are not used much."
4.0,"Great glasses.  Work fine, but they do scratch easier then advertised.  Otherwise, fine."
4.0,"My daughter loves it, but I'm worried it may shrink after some washings."
4.0,"I really like this top, it hides what it needs to and is comfortable. The material is pretty thick and seems like it will hold up."
4.0,"A beautifully made leather strap. However, I purchased it as a less expensive replacement strap for my IWC Portugieser and only realized after it arrived that because of its length it is not ideal for that watch. IWC straps are odd in that the free end of the deployment strap ends on the opposite side of the wrist to all other watches. To achieve this, IWC make one side of the strap significantly shorter than the other. Because the relative lengths of the two pieces of this replacement aren't the same as the original IWC strap, one has to turn the strap over and have the loose end of the strap face the more traditional side. This is fine except the ""IWC"" emblem on the original buckle will be inverted."
4.0,"I ordered this for my son for ""dress like a book character day"" and he loved it! The elephant nose however, covered his nose and mouth so it wasn't something he would be able to wear for long periods of time (he's 7 1/2 for reference and tall for his age) Overall the ears, tail and elephant trunk were exactly what we were looking for though! the tail has wire in it so you can bend it in different shapes and velcro so it will stay ""stuck"" to the inside of the clothing you are wearing so that was a plus! I tried on the elephant nose and for an adult is a good size but I wouldn't necessarily say it is a good size for kids as the description says."
4.0,I gave this product 4 stars only because I ordered the wrong size so I didn't get the opportunity to wear it. I returned it and that process was very easy. Got my refund the second they recieved the item. I did however love the design. It's exactly like the picture. The material is sheer with a liner which I like because it wasn't see through. It is perfect for a beach or pool party if you are conservative. I will be buying it back in the future.
4.0,Great boot and great fit
4.0,"I love the look of these and knew they wouldn't be adjustable. For my face the nose bridge is a little wide, combined with a sunny day, they slide down quite easy. If you have a slightly wider nose, you wouldn't have this issue. I do believe they are polarized when I look at my phone."
4.0,"Bought for my granddaughter, not quite expected.  Hardly match with the pretty set of stud earrings."
4.0,This is beautiful.  Love it
4.0,GLAD IT COMES 3 TO A PACK.
4.0,"The fit was small compared to other brands of the same size [small]. I purchased because of the price, pockets & high waisted features. There's an odd random inseam line down the front of each leg. Makes the pants look weird. I purchased a total of 3 pairs, I probably will not purchase again."
4.0,"Exactly as described, and was easy to install."
4.0,"The charm itself was a little smaller than I had initially expected, but my girlfriend loved it. She has actually gotten multiple compliments on it and she's only worn it for three days. The necklace is a little thick compared to the charm itself, yet it all still looks great. Arrived quickly on time and very well packaged. Would totally buy from this seller again!"
4.0,"The top runs a little small. More of a ""slim fit"" so order a size up if you want a more relaxed fit.  One thing I didn't realize when ordering is that it has pockets! I consider that a bonus! The fabric is super soft and plush inside and out."
4.0,Looks really cool . Great buy for my Halloween costume this year
4.0,Great for the holidays.
4.0,The dress fits perfectly but there is a hole in the pocket. The idea of pockets in this dress is what caught my attention. The hole is what keeps it from 5 stars.
4.0,Fits comfortably loose but not exaggerated all around. Wrist and waist snug. Neck opening a bit tight but helps on not exposing neck to windy or cold weather.
4.0,The kimono is great the hakama are less then expected.
4.0,"This Crazy Ant military back pack is awesome. As someone who prepares for everything I have a small collection of  back packs and this by far is my new favorite. This back pack has so many pockets and straps that I was able to condense almost 3 bags into just this one. It is made of a heavy duty nylon. The zippers are sturdy and the buckles are of high quality, I have no fear of either of them breaking. The straps and back are nicely padded to avoid soreness and fatigue. With most back packs you have to dig or pull everything out to get to the bottom, but with this backpack there is an entry pocket to the bottom of the bag. There are just so many zipper compartments, buckles and loops on this bag, I love it. The sholder straps are nice, they adjust to fit my husband who is 6' 1&#34; and me at 4' 11&#34;. There is a buckling chest strap, which I really like so the backpack doesn't slide off my shoulders. I wore this around the house completely full for a few hours to see how I felt when I was done and I have to say that the comfort level was nice. My shoulders didn't hurt and my upper back didn't tighten up like it usually does when I wear a heavy bag like this. I would have gave it 5 stars but I have only 1 complaint. There is a pocket on the front that the zipper is so small my husband cannot get his hands in there, but he decided to store long items (flash lights, glow sticks)  that he can just grab since he can't get his hands inside it. The bag did have a very strong odor when I received it, but I stuck it outside over night and the smell is gone.<br />Overall a great bag that is customizable for your needs.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,"This is a pretty cover-up (albeit, I believe it serves just to keep the chill away while you're wet as it's completely see through)  I'm plus sized, usually size 18 and this does fit.  It seems to shed a little, leaving behind bits of thread but I believe over time this will cease.  It would probably look better on a slimmer person, at least with the way the slit arms are.<br />**I received this item at a discount on exchange for my honest, unbiased review.**"
4.0,"I love my aviator sunglasses gold! They are dark, but perfect for the summer sun. They give the landscape a pop of vibrancy, and they are light weight so no annoying marks on the bridge of your nose. I absolutely love these sunnies!"
4.0,Fabric kind sheer. Must be worn with a slip or pettiecoat. I shorten the dress and it's perfect!  Polyester blend makes it an easy iron dress for your work week. Fits true to size. May want to purchase a 2&#34; wide white patent leather belt to go with it to accent your small waist.
4.0,I am a DDD cup.  This actually supported better than I thought it would.; comfortable but could still support better.
4.0,My expectation was met everything about it was just great.
4.0,"This is a great quality shirt but when we received it I noticed right away that the logo was crooked on the front.<br />It is off by about one inch from side to side but it isn't too noticeable to the common passerby.<br />The shirt shrunk up about 1.5"" in length after the first hot wash/dry and it kept its shape widthwise.<br />All in all, an okay shirt that is getting its use in the T-Shirt rotation by the Hubster.<br />He like the movie, I bought the shirt, he wears it, rinse and repeat!"
4.0,The material is great and the fit is perfect.
4.0,"Love these glasses, wish they had it in the tortoise, would buy again."
4.0,"Great, bought two of em! Super flattering and comfortable. Only problem is the straps have the cheaper plastic slides and one of em broke after 3rd wash. But I tied it and made it work for now"
4.0,great product security and peace of mind amazon shipped and delivered fairly fast
4.0,Could use a slightly firmer sole but on the whole a nice shoe.  Like the black cloth straps.
4.0,"Size and style ordered:<br />Large<br />Navy Blue<br /><br />I'm 5'2""<br />155 pounds<br />I carry my weight in my thighs and rear.<br /> <br />My measurements are:<br />Hips 43”<br />Waist  30”<br /><br />These run pretty true to size.<br /><br /> (Normally a medium fits me really well in yoga pants and is a little tight, and a large is a little bit looser.<br />I like my yoga pants to be a little bit looser so they dont stretch out at much. )<br /><br />The  pockets fit a water bottle in them.<br /> And easily fit a phone.<br /><br />The black mesh on the thighs is not stretchy.<br /><br />so even though these were a little loose around the waist and fit me the way a large would normally fit (meaning that they aren’t stretched to the max),<br /> i dont think medium would fit well on me because of the thighs."
4.0,"I bought these for my grandchild, they were about an inch too large but she loves them. Great product so far"
4.0,The shoulder straps are too long even when adjusted to the shortest position.
4.0,The XL is more like a M but a great sweater.
4.0,"Fast shipping! Works as advertised. Black finish has scratched in a couple of places after a few weeks of usage but I expected that. It's comfortable, and loads better than the silicon band that came with the Fitbit. The link removal tool it came with was pretty cheap and did not work well enough to remove the pins so I could resize it. Got it done at a local jewelry store for $5.00. So removed one star for that."
4.0,"Is it the best quality, no. But the outfit is comfortable and will last for a while. I use it for walking my dogs and lounging around the house - perfect for that. You get what you pay for, and the pricing is reasonable. The pants are definitely long. I am 5ft 8in and they are a little long on me. I did order a size larger than usual because I like a more relaxed fit, and that worked perfectly."
4.0,"Great PJ set for my 10 year old daughter (we bought sz S and she wears sz 14-16 kids). We bought the navy one w/ the anchor/stripes and it is super soft material (kind of a silky nylon). The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the top is short. Otherwise, she would fit into it for years. I wish they had cuter colors, not a fan of clothes with writing all over it."
4.0,The fit is very good. Fabric is thin but good for hot summers. I will buy another color.
4.0,Exellent design
4.0,Followed the size chart and it fit as expected. Sides are low so wear a tank under or lace trim bra. Noticed that the stitching isn't reinforced so I would be careful with over washing.
4.0,"Although I can not speak to the quality of these pearls, the earrings do appear lovely and well-constructed. The pearls are of a reasonable, consistent and attractive size, and the backings seem well-adhered. I plan to give these as a gift so I only wore them for a short amount of time, but I did not notice any discoloration upon removal. They arrived packages in a soft drawstring pouch so would not require much wrapping for the holidays. I do not see any blemishes.<br /><br />On second thought, I may keep these for myself &#62;:D"
4.0,Love it. It is made for Asian petite babe size. It fits perfectly.
4.0,"It's a nice dress but I'm a big girl and this style makes me look pregnant 🤰🏼. If your big busted and have a flat tummy, this will look nice on you. The material was nice and light weight. I'm 5'9&#34; and weight 245lb and I'm heavier bottom so it didn't look as I expected. So I returned it."
4.0,"These are really cute cateye shape sunglasses. They're  oversized and the tint is sufficient. The picture really tells it all. The only thing I kind of don't like about them is the shape of the bottom as compared to the top, if the bottom was square shaped, I think they would be a lot cuter. In any case, that's just personal preference. If you're looking for large, kindof cateye shaped sunglasses, these are decent."
4.0,but i like it anyway and wear it nder my uniforndh
4.0,An excellent value and looks good.  I plan on buying a gold colored one also.  Priced right - the magnet closure holds firm - no worries about coming undone.
4.0,Small bag with good quality
4.0,The costume was cute. It fits the with Grease Pink Ladies perfectly. I thought it came with the entire costume but it doesn’t have the shirt or pants. It was a little on the larger side. It was baggy around the shoulders and torso.  Not the best quality but it was about what I expected for the price. Glasses fogged up and were blurry.
4.0,"I like almost everything, only problem is it was Made In China. The ad said it would be Made in the USA."
4.0,Love everything about it. The price the look and the durability
4.0,"The design on these is absolutely adorable. The quality is good as well. I have very small feet (size 5 shoe) and the socks were a bit big on me, but I liked the design so much that I decided to keep them."
4.0,Overall it’s a good compressor sock however if you wash it do not dry it. It shrinks and will slide down the leg if you walk around on your feet all day.
4.0,took forever to get here but i like it & it’s good quality
4.0,This was adorable but I wasn't really digging the sleeves.  I may cut them shorter. The material is a little hot for summer days.  Would look adorable on younger folks.  I am 55 and petite but it is only used to go to the pool.
4.0,The seller was excellent - prompt and a personal note. The bag itself is a little too big for my taste but I kept it. it has great pockets on the outside and inside. The bottom is rather too wide. The strap length is good - can be used on your shoulder. It is a great summer bag as it can be used with black or the usual summer khakis. it will definitely fit an iPad or Kindle.
4.0,The size was right on the money. It fit very well!
4.0,Perfect for girls ears.  Doesn't overwhelm their small ears.  Also they stay younger a little longer.
4.0,"I have only tried it on so far, and need to make alterations since my torso is a little shorter than the dress, but it's beautiful and light. Not at all see through (darker colors where anything might show helps!). Very excited to wear it"
4.0,Nice work very good in cloudy days
4.0,Great band! Great sounds!
4.0,Wrinkles but great for cruise
4.0,"I like these bras for lounging around the house, but they don't support enough to use during exercise with a bigger bust"
4.0,"I love the pattern but the way the fabric is draped near the pockets makes my hips look way wider than they actually are. Wore it once and got compliments, but I might try ironing those areas out before I wear it again."
4.0,I ordered two sizes up and fit well. Very feminine and pretty
4.0,Great necklace for the price. The gold is very shiny and a bit brass like but you get what you pay for and it looks cute I've gotten compliments on it! For someone who is always losing jewelry this is a great option.
4.0,Love how they feel. Soft and comfortable
4.0,"A beautiful charm.  The rose gold color is very very nice.  I had purchased it to go on a necklace, however that was not possible.  This is a nicely weighted charm, but it's top heavy.  On a necklace it flips upside down, the daisy on the bottom.  Keeping that in mind it works on a charm bracelet nicely."
4.0,My husband likes how comfortable the ring fits
4.0,"The color is way brighter than the picture, but it fits perfect and I love the style!"
4.0,Mask isn’t very flexible and ear adjustments are small
4.0,Can’t sleep with them in the charms are super pointy and uncomfortable otherwise super cute to have in for the day up and about
4.0,Ordered for my 12 year old daughter as her Halloween costume. She loved it! The jacket good quality and my daughter wears it often. However the stockings are very thin and tore easily.
4.0,"In fact, this scarf has difference from the picture, namely  the lack of a label manufacturer with the UK flag. But it doesn't  matter, because it's  warm, gentle, pleasant and soft  for  the body, especially for the neck. I'm already waiting for the winter or cold season."
4.0,"i ordered up  i usually wear large but ordered xl.  im 5'1 180 pounds. .  its  very thin and futs snug, with a girddle its a good fit.  shows all curves ....... I bought several colors  Love the arms"
4.0,"Washes well, it did fade a little after a few washes. Not more than expected. It has elastic with a pull cord at the back so the fit is perfect (With a thick ponytail/bun most days). It came in a little ziplock style pouch perfect for storing."
4.0,Loved the shoes but I ordered them large - compared to what I normally wear; which is a 7. These are an 8 and still too small.  Would love to swap them out.
4.0,"The pants were a little long,I have other pants that are 32 length,and these were longer than they should be."
4.0,I put the umbrella on my deck and it works good it is easy to move up and down compared to my old umbella. The cover is not that easy to put on the umbrella because I'm not fall so I have to use a step stool to put the cover on.
4.0,Got these for my sisters birthday! Great variety!
4.0,"After reading the reviews I decided to order a small because I wanted a more snug fit. It was perfect. I am 5’6” and around 145 athletic build. I typically wear medium shirts if I want baggy or small if I want a snug fit and a size 8-10 jeans depending on brand. It is very well made and seems like it will be very warm. The green color is not the same as in the photo but is more of a sage green. It also is a bit lop-sided at the neck because of the buttons, but the style is still cute."
4.0,"Great fit, nice and soft."
4.0,very happy with the dress
4.0,"Took a couple washes for the fabric to &#34;soften&#34;, but after that the fit was great!"
4.0,"I really like this,it's more comfortable than a sports bra but really sexy.  I'm a 34 A and it fits great, but I don't know how someone with a large chest would fit.  The only reason it's 4 instead of 5 stars is because it creaks weird...like the bra cups are cheap and makes a strange crackling sound when I take it on or off or just adjust it."
4.0,It's really cute. Fits good.
4.0,I loved it but the knot came undone I wish it had instructions on how to retie it
4.0,I have purchased a total of seven pairs of these hummingbird earrings as gifts and one for myself. I love them and so do the people I gave them to. I am very happy with my purchases.
4.0,"I ended up getting a large based on other reviews. I am 5'-3&#34; stocky build. The dress fit great, however I returned it because it looked like I was going to a funeral rather than a fun night out. I got the black. I might try a different color in the future."
4.0,Chain a bit short - dice are great.
4.0,Cute.Not much support but enough to go about your day.
4.0,"This was THE first dress I purchased on line, that was actually too large. I know it sound perverse, but that made me giddy. I can always tuck in an inch, if I just stop being lazy about it. My choice was the black with white flowers. I find the dress very pretty. The material has a stretch to it. My only regret is that I purchased this dress so late in the season."
4.0,Looks like it working
4.0,"Sunglasses are great like all raen sunglasses. Delivery was quick and smooth. Bummer tho, after I received the item it went on sale for 20 bucks cheaper."
4.0,"These socks do what they are designed for. A little difficult to put on, but are comfortable once on."
4.0,"These are great, lightweight, very stretchy. Only thing is I would order one size up. I love them though!"
4.0,Bueno para el precio. Buena calidad de color y textura
4.0,[[VIDEOID:1a0642918bf2acda58831e79ab4fefe9]] I like my new glasses. I love the color as it’s my favorite color good quality. But disappointeda little bit  cause it has 2 minors scratching 🤦🏽‍♀️. Going on my cruise next day can’t return it.
4.0,They turned out just as expected and They are super cute!!! Not heavy or bad it very good to put with my gothic outfits!!!
4.0,Very nice quality and great presentation in her packaging.
4.0,Nice hat. Sizes run a little small.
4.0,My son likes them and they seem comfortable but started pilling after a few uses
4.0,Was a nice gift for my mother in law
4.0,"I love this jacket! Was an amazing buy for sure, I took 1 star of because the stitching in the chest pocket for the vest has come loose in the cone to where I've had some pens fall into the inner lining. (Only owned this combo for around 2 months?)<br /><br />I am going to try and patch it... But overall I wear this jacket vest combo everywhere! An for riding it's a nice step in between needing my leather jacket."
4.0,Love the claw hook. The silk cord is a nice look.
4.0,Me encantaron!!!
4.0,Very nice and smart looking.
4.0,"These yoga pants are nice and comfortable. I like that they fit and are true to size. The material is very comfortable which is great. It is on the thinner side so great for warmer days and lounging around.<br />The downside on these, they are not tummy control as advertised. They are actually quite loose. They also don't have pockets, why they still make pants without pocket is just beyond me!<br /><br />Other than that happy with these but PLEASE, add pockets. Totally missed that part about them."
4.0,"I did like the fit of this bathing suit, however the top was not very supportive. I was concerned about a slip up."
4.0,"It is nice.  The pockets are a little strange and won’t stay inside, but still like the dress."
4.0,"Was definitely glad I had these when packing my backpack for my backpacking trip around Europe, however if you weren't careful with the zipper it would open up in the middle and unzip without the zipper so you would have to try to unzip open zipper parts just to rezipper it (if that makes sense) haha"
4.0,Ok for the $. Pretty color.  Washes well.
4.0,Worked well for what I was using them for but didn’t last very long.
4.0,Only worn three pair but so far so good. They are comfortable. Not to tight either. Good for the 12+ hours a day that I wear them.
4.0,"The sizing is off, for certain. Give yourself a size in waist and length, but otherwise the price, fit, style, utility, and durability are unmatched."
4.0,excellent product little bit difficult to insert but from there no more problems
4.0,"The writing looks a little more like a stick on that I could have put on, but it looks okay and it’s cute. Bought in remembrance of my baby boy and that’s all I think of when I wear it."
4.0,"Got this for a 5'-10"" tall friend in XL. The fit is good for height. He normally wears a S-M shirt and this fit fine around him. Problem is the buttons. When one sits down there are HUGE gaps between the buttons. Really we'll likely retrofit velcro closers. If they're going to stick with buttons, they really need to add 2-3x as many. Only complaint though."
4.0,A little too large. Wish it was more adjustable.
4.0,"This is a decent piece at a decent price. Nice for fall walks with the pup, and decently warm. I've gotten multiple comments on it--it's a bit odd looking, honestly, but it's also cute in its own way. The hood is a bit too large to be useful. Overall a good purchase!"
4.0,my daughter like the colors and wear it all the time she likes it because it is so light when she workout with it.  Nice jacket
4.0,"This piece is pretty, but a little bigger than I was expecting. I bought it for my daughter in law and ended up keeping it because I didn't feel like it was a style for younger women."
4.0,These shoes are super comfortable. They never gave me blisters and I can wear them while I'm running around all day with no issues. The price was great as well. Definitely good product for the price. The only thing I don' like is they run a little large. I always wear a 7 but I should have ordered a 6.5.
4.0,They're pretty fun in the sun
4.0,It’s still a little too big for my 4 year old but I made it work and does exactly what I wanted it to do. Now my son’s glasses don’t slide down his nose like they were.
4.0,"Bought the XL as suggested in the sizing chart, and though they do fit, they don't really cater to a woman with &#34;more to love.&#34; Like a previous reviewer had mentioned, since there is no real band around the waist, these panties tend to roll down quite a bit. I wear jeans, mostly, so I don't have an issue with panty lines showing through leggings or what-have-you, and I don't find them to be uncomfortable after they've rolled down. They feel silky, are stitched together way better than some VS panties I've purchased in the past, and are overall a great and reasonably priced alternative. Would recommend, just be sure to size up!"
4.0,"This is a cute tank top, it's very comfortable and well made, the quality reminds be of a certain store for 21 yr olds;p. The color is bright and a very nice shade of red. I purchased this tank to use for the gym, but I think it will likely end up just being a sleep tank.<br />I would not consider this an athletic top, the material is mostly cotton. The fabric is also thin and light weight, you can see through it in certain lighting. The major thing that makes this a poor choice for the gym is that moisture shows up pretty bad, so you'll be showing off that lovely back sweat (or wherever else you sweat).<br />I am still giving this tank four stars because it is still nice and definitely worth the price, I'm just bummed it won't work work what I intended.<br />*I received a discount for my honest review*"
4.0,"It's a nice shirt, but very tight in the arms.  I would upsize 1 size for comfort."
4.0,"I ordered several Tshirts for summer camping trips. This one is softer, thicker, and had better quality fabric. Nicely made. Slightly warm for hot summer days, but really a good purchase & value for money. Looks exactly like the image from the seller."
4.0,"This makes my fitbit unique and this band is stackable with other bracelets. The only complaint I have is that it comes lose more easily than I'd like. It never just comes off my arm while wearing it... even to sleep, but when I'm removing it from my wrist, it comes lose from the fitbit sometines."
4.0,Love this dress. It fit perfectly and was not see through.
4.0,The description reads Size10 but these rings have an adjustable back that allows you to size them from about 7 to 13.
4.0,A bit cheap but the bf loved it. I also got one for myself.
4.0,"Fits good, and the material is soft and comfortable to wear; not itchy like some of the others I've worn."
4.0,"Nice watch, but the band is very stiff"
4.0,the item was as expected and serves it's purpose I just wish they were a little bit taller. good quality. great price.
4.0,Downgraded one star only because it leans if I put my iPad in it as opposed to my laptop and the straps are not long enough to wear on my shoulder.
4.0,"Overall very cute, warm, comfortable. The color is true to the picture, and the shape is very flattering for a down jacket. Fur piece is removable with buttons along the hood.<br /><br />Warning: uses Asian sizes! Shoulders are very narrow, and you should size up by three (XXL = US Large)."
4.0,Looks good on but i was hoping for more tummy control.  I have a dreaded &#34;mom belly&#34; and this does not help hold that in at all.  Love the look of this suit though.  I'm a 38D-DD and i fit well in this.
4.0,"It's a good product,  just the per6size and it also hides your personal information so not everyone can see it ."
4.0,claws were in great shape. However I am unsure how to assemble with no instructions. It was a bit confusing. over all very well made though.
4.0,My little 7yr fits well. My 8yr fits snug.
4.0,"It's not bad.  Quality seems good and it's thin.  I'd prefer a bit smaller and less card slots.  This one has 8 compartments total and I only use 5...2 ID's, credit card, debit card and the cash pocket which would also hold something random like a permit or something.  I haven't been able to find one any smaller though and honestly I've carried this in my front pocket for 2 days now and I barely know it's there."
4.0,I like how it fits .
4.0,"bought this for myself for christmas and I liked it but its so hard to change the time , you have to be a rocket scientist . I actually tried to change the time for day light savings and couldnt get it to change so I threw it in with the rest of my watch collection ( over 40 watches from 1920s up )  and threw on a common timex wind up watch .  so it was a good watch , kept time , but its really hard to change the time ."
4.0,Beeeautiful
4.0,very comfortable flip flop!
4.0,"Love this neck gaiter, this is little tight for me. But this definitely can replace the orthodox face masks.  This can help to cover the face, nice texture."
4.0,"I bought a couple of what I assumed other than color would be the exact same shirt, but for some unknown reason this one is smaller."
4.0,Nice leggings although too big so had to return.
4.0,Great dress for the price - very comfortable
4.0,"Finally! After a 108 year wait, I can buy a Cubs World Series Champions hat! Ok, so maybe I didn't wait all 108 of those years, but sometimes it felt like it. Especially in the &#34;rebuilding&#34; days when the team was likely to lose 100 games rather than win 100. I loved the look of this hat as soon as I saw it on the field after the last out, so it was one of the first items I went for when gear went on sale. I have to say, as far as looks, I absolutely love this hat. Beautiful color, design, lettering, everything about it just looks superb. The one problem, as others have noted, is with the size of the flex-fit &#34;one size fits most.&#34; It says on the tag inside the hat that it's engineered for MLB players. The average MLB player has a much larger head than your Average Joe, so for most people, this hat is going to be more loose than you want it to be. You need to have an MLB-size head for it to feel comfortably snug. However, as a collectible, or keepsake, of the championship, you can't beat it. If you want to wear it and it seems too loose, I suggest adding some kind of small, rolled up cloth inside the back brim to keep the hat more secure. I've found that it feels great when enhanced with something to keep it more secure. Anyway, it's too bad the size isn't more in line with the average person, but for the most part, I really like the hat. Go Cubs, go!"
4.0,"Not stitch, Printed but still is a great by the side i gold."
4.0,Classy and good looking
4.0,A singing group I am in each bought one for a concert. It was a very flattering jacket to all of our different shapes and sizes.  They ran small. Several of us had to re-order the next size up.
4.0,"Good product for money, only the credit card slots could be a fraction bigger."
4.0,"My daughter has extremely sensitive ears - any type of metal was making them red and swollen. So we tried the Blomdahl earrings and she has had no problems at all. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because the posts have gotten a little bent out of shape. But overall these are great for people with sensitive skin or allergies to metals like nickel. The design is very cute and delicate, perfect for a young girl. Might be a little small for an adult."
4.0,"It is a semi hard-shell glasses case.  It will keep your glasses from being smashed by something light or soft, but not from being stepped on or sat on.  Bought to replace a Rayban case that had started to come apart.  I noticed reviewers mentioning a bad smell, I did not notice the smell with my case."
4.0,Very soft and comfortable! I only take away one star due to the label. I had to cut it out.
4.0,"The fit is true to Size, but the sleeves are kind of oddly long."
4.0,"As others have said, it does feel cheaper than the name brand.  But, if it lasts longer than the Samsung than its better in my book.  Mine also had a small part that did not sit flush with the watch but after some wiggling fixed it.  Overall it is very large and feels great so far.  Worth the price so far, but today is only day one."
4.0,"Earrings are good quality, only the color is slightly open, the video is on the picture."
4.0,I've never used it but it looks like it should work.
4.0,"Looks cool and works, image is crisp!"
4.0,Color funeral
4.0,Hat wasnt properly packaged. Should have came in a box to prevent the heavy creases and wrinkles my hat currently has!!! The actual hat is very stylish with great color! Just hope these wrinkles fade soon!
4.0,Bigger than expected which is good. Has this ring than can be attached to a lanyard. Doesn't smell all that stong but I do love the smell.
4.0,"I ordered these and they would have fit really nice except that they are actually petite instead of regular sizing... they looked like capri pants when i tried them on. :(<br />Update- sending petite was a mistake on the sellers part, they sent me the correct regular and they fit just fine.  Nice, light weight fabric,  good color, sewing, etc. There is a bit of stretch at the waist.  I still think they run a tad small in sizing.... I ordered what I always wear ( a size ten) and these are a tiny bit snug in the waist. Also they have no butt pockets which isn't the end of the world,  but I like them so taking away a star for sizing and lack of pockets.  Otherwise,  nice professional pants."
4.0,"These shorts are cute and they fit in the butt and legs but the waist is way too tight. I’m 5’3” 124, I wear a size small in everything. I could barley get them buttoned and they give me muffin top because they’re too tight. Also my stomach is not my problem area, if anything I’m pear shaped. So the shorts are cute but if you don’t have a size 25 inch waste I would order up a size."
4.0,"This vest is very warm and fits well. The only thing I dislike about it is that it attracts lint so easily. Other than that, I'm pleased with my purchase."
4.0,Super pretty. Sadly it was broken and wouldn’t click shut but they gave me a refund almost immediately since they were sold out. I might buy another when they get more.
4.0,"I really liked the fabric and color, but it is much, much too small for me. I'm a 2X, and this fit like a Large. If you buy, make sure you go up 1 or 2 sizes. I'm not going to order a larger size because they don't make a 4x and I think the 3X would be too small also."
4.0,Very light weight. Great color. I bought the small as I normally do and have to put it nearly on the last notch. It is somewhat hard to fasten as well.
4.0,The front of this visor is a little taller than I prefer but that might just be me.<br />Otherwise seems great!
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised with the quality and fit for these rashguard/one piece suits. I am almost 5'5&#34; around 125lbs with 36.5&#34;Bust/28&#34;Waist/38&#34;Hips. Medium in the Orchid/floral print fit a bit snug, especially in the booty and thigh areas and a bit too cheeky for me. Large in the Cockatoo/leaf print fit well, but the bra pads seemed to float around and I would definitely remove them. There was also a bit of extra material in the armpit area, but I think its there to ease movement and I actually liked not having it cut into my armpits. Both are incredibly soft, prints are beautiful and super detailed and very modest bum coveragr. Zippers seemed sturdy and stayed up even when partially unzipped and have a fabric backing so there was no irritation. Only complaint would be the short sleeve length, but I do have long arms. Personal preference would go Large, but Medium would maybe work, just a bit harder to get in and out of."
4.0,Nice size. Easy to read.
4.0,Sleeves seemed more short then usual
4.0,It was a gift for my granddaughter and she likes it.
4.0,This sweatshirt is nice. The shipping was faster than expected. Fits perfectly but the material is more like a soft bathing suit rather than fleece. The inside is comfy but not heavy enough material to be worn as a hoodie.
4.0,"Fit was a little more generous than same in dark denim. Material is soft, just the right about of stretch. Fit is good, I'm a pear and usually have the waist too big, these aren't too bad."
4.0,Took a day for an odor to go away.
4.0,"Very nice quality T-shirt  for $9.99. The Wine Red tee was a good thickness & not see through, not too heavy & not too light.<br /><br />We ordered a Large for my teenage son who is quite tall & slender (6’4” 165 lbs) & it fit great through the shoulders & body. However, it runs a tad short at the waist. It will ride up if he bends over or reaches for something above his head.  Will need to order up to an XL."
4.0,lightweight in durable... great flips!
4.0,"I was really hoping these would fall at the length as shown in the photo - but at 5'6"", they just look like floods - and fall at an awkward spot on my leg. They are super soft, cute and fun, and have pockets so they are amazing for these features, and I would still recommend them!"
4.0,"Bought this set for my son, he took it to Ecuador and it held up nicely"
4.0,"Comfortable, but a bit too short for me"
4.0,Soft material and nice color but the bottom is very hard and not flexible for walking in and the thing between the toes hurts.
4.0,"Purchased a pair of these for my grandson as a Christmas present, He loved them!!<br />They looked awesome, worked great, I would definitely purchase again."
4.0,"I didn't end up using these, but I'm saving them for the next roaring 20's event.  Definitely a nice look."
4.0,"This shirt fits well and the linen is great. It's a little sheer but that's to be expected of white linen. Living in a tropical area, this shirt is exactly what I wanted. The only downside is the cut can make you look a bit like a yogi. I tend to tuck it in to avoid that."
4.0,Cute dress. Will work for vacation
4.0,"Really cute! A little bigger than expected, but it's okay. :)"
4.0,Se encoje al lavarla
4.0,These brands are pretty nice but the quality isn’t the best. Love how they look on my wrist.
4.0,I'm giving these shirts 4 stars because the sleeve's are a tad too short and it could be a little longer to tuck in. They are nice though. I'm 6'2&#34; and my arms are pretty long.
4.0,The length is not what I expected its not bad but it just needs like 3 more inches and it would be perfect.  That said I am 6' tall and 190lbs so if you fall under that height and weight you might love it.  The neck is wider than shown FYI an the shirt doesnt really drape longer in the back like shown....but I do like the shirt overall.
4.0,"It serves the purpose, but could be wider."
4.0,I ordered the large size for my average size hands.  For large they fit tighter than I would like.
4.0,"This curtain has a soft, luxurious feel and drapes beautifully. The wrinkles from packaging go away a few days after they are hung up."
4.0,Love them they just are a tad small for my large feet
4.0,"Fun little light dress.  Fits as expected.  Pretty casual, I paired it with white sneakers, took a white cardi to throw over when the sun went down."
4.0,2 of them looked like they were kid sizes
4.0,Must have another mask behind it
4.0,This was a gift for my niece.  It was good quality.  Nothing special.
4.0,I’m petite and I usually wear XS but this dress is a little too big on me . I do like the feel of the dress.
4.0,"Genuinely very impressed with this too! It is very flattering and SOFT. I had read some reviews on a similar squareneck too from this same company that the shirt was poor quality due to an unfinished neckline, but this neckline is in fact finished and of good quality for the price.<br /><br />However, go by standard sizing and not the sizing chart here. I am usually a US 2/4 size small but ordered a large because the size chart makes everything sound so small! The large is quite big on me, especially in the sleeves. But tucked into jeans it looks very nice so I will be keeping it."
4.0,"Good value, multiple pairs for great price. Posts are a little too long for my liking but not posing a problem as of yet. I'm not a fan of the teeny tiny backs though."
4.0,"i really like them, look just like the picture. The only thing that bugs me about them is the bars that hold the diamond in are a little big so they tend to snag onto my hair or scarf."
4.0,These shirts are great. They are longer but that is ok they occasionally ride up but only to my waist band
4.0,Great set for the price. One earring was damaged. Otherwise all others look exactly as shown. Lightweight and great for people who can’t wear heavy earrings.
4.0,This top is attractive if a tad billowy. The red is a beautiful rich wine shade. The lace is soft and not scratchy. I like the longer length. It is true to size. Workmanship is adequate but not impressive. Pretty piece that can be dressed up or down
4.0,Cheaply made but a nice accessory
4.0,Bought this as part of my daughters halloween costume so I can’t really critique it much. The material was soft and silky though so if you were going to use it as intended as a night gown I don’t think you’d be disappointment with the material. It’s thin so not super warm. It seems large. My daughter is 5’5 and only 105lbs and she was swimming in the small.
4.0,"It's a little bulky and sits a bit loose on the ear, but it does not fall off. Overall, it is as I expected and still charming."
4.0,The glasses seemed a little small on my face but I am 6'1&#34; and 230 lbs... I really wish they fit better because they look awesome! My friend just got a new present...
4.0,The jersey looks amazing but I only gave it a 4 star because it took a good while for it to ship to my house
4.0,Summertime use
4.0,"The dress is nice and the quality is good. However, I am a bit on the shorter side (5'4) and it just looked funny on me. Probably would look great if i was taller!"
4.0,"Firstly, I have to say that I ordered the 'Pepsi"" version, with the Red /Blue Bezel, silver case, and the silver/gold band. What I received was the ""Coca Cola"" version, with Red /Black bezel, Black Case and Black band. Now to the watch I did receive: Its a larger sized watch, for those not watch people, Its a 47 mm case, and it will cover two thirds of an  average sized wrist. This is the largest size I would normally wear and feel comfortable. It is a weighty watch, you will not forget that you have it on. It has a solid feel, the crown, the bezel and to a lesser degree, the bracelet, have a solid tight feel. The 60 click Bezel doesnt have any back travel, and the crown and pushers feel solid, not loose. I shortened the bracelet with the supplied pin pusher tool, which stripped out before I finished, but I have plenty  of those, and the bracelet has solid end links and an average clasp, virtually the same clasp on every watch in  this price point. So, in all, for $19.99, this is a good watch, I wish I got the ""Pepsi"" one I ordered, as I have a red , whit and blue Nato strap  on the way, but as the watch itself goes, Its not bad, its not a junk watch, It will be in my work rotation, and if there are any  events, Ill update."
4.0,"Bought these for hostel shower shoes, because they are light and don't retain water. They are not comfortable, but they do the job."
4.0,Vety very very beautiful but had 2 return it did not fit. Us full figured grls were not catered for. I wish When Kylie is designing these beautiful outfits she will include us
4.0,Fit is good but needs a few more feathers. Good for Halloween costume.
4.0,I was really expecting a piece of tin but am delightfully pleased. It's not a real strobe bracelet but then that was expected. Took for-eve-r to receive
4.0,Too small. Cute dress
4.0,"This dress is lovely and fashionable. I really like it. I am going to have to lose some more weight before I can wear this dress. My bustline is still too big. The dress has nice and trendy designs with the ruffle in the front, a bold zipper in the front and a hidden zipper in the back. I would certainly recommend this dress."
4.0,"Good for the price, but not very scratch resistant lenses."
4.0,"I actually like the color and the quality of these jeans, but the fitting is not particularly great."
4.0,Nice and comfy the material streches but not too stretchy
4.0,This is a very beautiful ear cuff! But it is on the larger side so it doesn't look quite right. I wish I had known it was going extend out so far off the ear that's my biggest con. It was also every easy to put on. For the price I am still happy.
4.0,"My daughter is 5'4"" and 100lbs. We spent an entire day dress shopping with little luck. This dress is a perfect fit straight from the package. The corset allows the dress to be tighten enough to be comfortable and doesn't gap. It fits snugly across the chest without being too tight and doesn't slide off her narrow shoulders. She hasn't decided if she wants the corset to tie at the top or the waist or to tuck the ends back into the dress. The waist hits her natural waistline. The dress is beautiful as is but she paired it with a crinoline for more volume. She will need to wear it with heels or have it hemmed. Love the pockets and button detail down the back."
4.0,"I bought these to handle a rescue dog I brought in, he's very skittish and sometimes bitey so I decided to get these gloves. He's 6 lbs and while yes he's very little, his bites still hurt and can break skin. So far so good with these, he just gets a piece of glove instead of my fingers. 5/5 would buy again!"
4.0,"These fit just fine and look good too. Just a little disappointed that the one in the picture that looks Yellow, is not yellow."
4.0,"Fits well and well made. I bought it in white, which made me feel like a gigantic mummy. Returned the White for a different color."
4.0,"Update. Seller reached out to me and sent a new set of sleeves. Very pleased they didn't have the same issue as the first pair.<br /><br />While I like the style and comfort of these compression sleeves, I was very disappointed in the stitching. If you look at the stitching in the 2 pictures, (left arm and right arm) there is a section that is very poorly done and seems like it's ready to bust at the seams. I ordered the appropriate size so thats not the issue. It was just poorly sewn in the one area.<br /><br />I've ordered 2 sleeves from another manufacturer and did not have this problem. Maybe this was just a flaw that was not caught durring production. If the manufacturer is willing to replace with a properly sewn sleeves, I will change my review.<br /><br />Other than the poor stitching it is a great product. Gives the compression I need and dry wicks just as advertised"
4.0,This was a gift for my wife.  She loves it.
4.0,"bit big for a gym bag in my case, but nonetheless good bag.<br /><br />can basically put other bags within it for subcompartments"
4.0,Hard to find this shape in the stores. Quality is just average but works for me.
4.0,durable and cheap works good
4.0,"Love these earrings. I purchased them for a second ear piercing. Unfortunately, I lost a backing. Be sure that you secure your backings. The green looks great!"
4.0,"nice, quick shipping, thanks to the seller! one issue, there is NO tag in the shirt, packaging does not state size, and there was no receipt in the package, so even though I ordered an XL, and am fairly confident I received an XL, there is no way for me to be 100% certain. I'm going to try it on a few times within next 36 hours, not washing in case I feel any dissatisfaction that may warrant a request for return/refund."
4.0,Quality is better than expected.
4.0,"I like the looks of this, though it was cuter on-line than in person. I didn't like how it was crammed into a small plastic bag. It is a gift, so I hope the recipient will like it. I did take it out to make sure it fit. I have a normal-sized wrist, and was able to only snap the last button."
4.0,Cute and comfy shirt. Slightly snug.
4.0,it's a nice summer dress; light and sheer. Might need a slip underneath. Order 1 size up.
4.0,The Mrs. likes them
4.0,"Overall these are exactly what I was looking for. They are easy to get on, and the compression is just right. My only complaint is that the sock itself is a little short. I am only 5’2” and I wish that the sock had another 1/2” on it or so. But they still work just fine."
4.0,Had a lot of compliments on this purse.
4.0,These are comfortable fit and good polarization.  As pictured
4.0,Nice looking but the leather has a fold near the pearls making the entire necklace lopsided. Hopefully in time that will &#34;iron&#34; out. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
4.0,I always have the cutest socks in the room.
4.0,"This is so cozy and warm. It is thinner than I anticipated it being. I haven't had too much problem with shedding yet, but I love the oversized fit to throw over a shirt and some leggings on a cozy day."
4.0,"I am a size 6/8, 5'7&#34; and about 150lbs. I am a 36D. This dress was gorgeous (just as described!), but was just too tight in the chest area. It zipped, but just looked too stuffed in the chest area. Very beautiful dress, but I had to return!"
4.0,"This dress is great for spring and summer. It is very cute and girly looking. The dress is soft, comfortable, and flowy. I ordered a small and it is a little bit big on me.<br /><br />  The dress is a little see through because the fabric is thin so I recommend wearing a slip under it or wearing it with a camisole and leggings in the spring.  I love the length of the dress; it falls a few inches above my knees. However, I am a hair under 5 ft tall so if you are tall this dress will be too short for you to wear without leggings under it.<br /><br />  Take note of the washing instructions in the description, as the dress does not have a tag with the washing instructions on it.<br /><br />  Overall, it is a really cute dress and it’s a good deal for the price. I plan to sew a liner into the dress so that I don’t have to worry about wearing a slip with it every time.<br /><br />I received this dress in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I was under no obligation to provide positive feedback."
4.0,"Probably should have gotten an xs like my last Allegra k dress but it is very nice quality. The fabric is soft and not too thin and the cut is definitely unique but stylish. I guess I'm on the petite side so the shoulders arms and bust are kind of too baggy and I think this would be better as a tight fitting dress. I'm 5'3&#34; and 114lbs with a little muscle to my arms but not bulky. Looks nice with a pair of baggy, silky pants, though. I might order an xs and gift this one to a friend because I don't know how to tailor sleeves. XD This company definitely stands out for catering to non tiny Asian bodies for sure, so keep that in mind that their sizing isn't crazy like others so you don't need to size up so much."
4.0,"The product fit as expected.  It seems a bit large at the bottom.  I like the colour and after one washing, it is still comfortable and hasn't shrunk appreciably."
4.0,I really like this new band. This is a great upgrade from the original band. Very comfortable and fits a wide array of wrist sizes. The color is very vibrant. I am very please with this purchase and will recommend it.
4.0,"These work great. Just remember to remove them slowly and gently until you get used to them, or your nipples will sting. These things really do stick! Can be worn with or without a bra! When I do wear a bra, the thin stretchy kind, I also use these nipple covers to prevent poke-outs...but I also wear the covers without a bra and they stay put.  Instructions say don't wear longer than 6 hours. I've worn them longer than that, but my nips definitely need to run free overnight or they can get irritated and sore. Overall great product and price...the 8 pack for $16 is an even better deal."
4.0,"I love the fabric. It's smooth and soft. The print is lovely, not too dark and not too light. Very comfortable clothing, exactly what is needed for yoga or other light exercising. Item was packaged really well in a zip-bag . Lovely to give as a birthday or Christmas gift. I gave the item 4 stars because I ordered a small, even though I usually wear medium, and it was still too large. I recommend buying one or two sizes smaller than usual."
4.0,These leggings are super soft and very comfortable but do run big.
4.0,Made with hard plastic. A bit too large for my “medium-sized” face.
4.0,Very pretty but larger than I thought. She
4.0,I would normally wear a Large but after reading the reviews I ordered an extra large. The bottoms are a fit tight with alittle but cleavage but not inappropriate. I love it! Great product for the price
4.0,"It's great, I got 1/2 the number, I'm glad"
4.0,The fit is very nice you don’t need to order a size up
4.0,The clear ones are huge but i made it work.
4.0,"This is my 3rd dress from this vendor and I can’t get enough of them! I love the look of this dress and always receive compliments when I wear it. I’m 5’5”, 150 lbs and the medium fits quite well. It’s a little loose and I could maybe go down a size, but I like it as is."
4.0,I returned the shirt because the V-neck made the saying fit a little low on my body. I purchased one that has a regular neck. Fingers crossed that I like it better.
4.0,Beautiful pattern. Very well made.
4.0,Got it for my Velma costume. Usually wear a medium but bought a large based on reviews. Worked perfectly!
4.0,"Its a great wallet that does everything I need it to. Its also slimmer than it appears. I don't like big wallets and this works for me. My only gripe is that the sleeves keep tearing. This creates a hazardous situation that can cause a card to fall out when opening the wallet. However, Sharkk was great and has replaced it for me twice already. I am very happy with the product and Sharkk. Four stars because of the sleeves.<br /><br />FYI (I never did this but...)<br />***DON'T PLACE MORE THAN ONE CARD IN EACH SLEEVE***<br />It will destroy the sleeves of the wallet faster than normal. That is what it says in the pamphlet that comes with the wallet."
4.0,I actually like this dress more then I thought when I took it out of the bag. I'm normally a medium and I bought a large. I am using it as a beach cover up. This dress is very lingerieish. It's silky and the straps are thin. I don't think I would wear this out but is great as a beach cover up.
4.0,I really love my Sodalite necklace. I like the look and crystal itself is beautiful  I plan on buying more for my daughters.👍
4.0,"I purchased various flip flops anticipating and hoping I would find something I could live with. I did, these are the bomb. My only complaint is that you can tell that I wear these often by the suntan line left behind on my foot (this is due to the wider strap)."
4.0,Son loves the feel and comfort
4.0,"Great shirt, but material is too heavy to run in, with humidity"
4.0,"Good quality.  The ears aren't fixed to the band, I hot glued my down and it was fine. Needed bobbie pins to keep it on"
4.0,A little big in the bust had it altered fits fantastic now. Love the dress.
4.0,"Runs large, The only thing holding this dress up is your chest and a very thin laced up flimsy cord which ripped while I was trying it on. To be clear I am not small chested.<br />I had to take the gown  to the seamstress to be repaired and A heavy hook and eye to keep the dress up before I could wear it.<br /><br />Dress is pretty."
4.0,Feels like it is either too lose or too tight on my wrist.
4.0,Kind of cheap but for the price who is complaining. Adorable chokers
4.0,"I am usually a large in dresses, but I had to return it and get the XL despite most people saying it &#34;fit as expected.&#34; It's possible I just read the sizing wrong, too. The XL fit great. The zipper stuck on both versions that I bought, and it felt like I was going to break it a few times trying to get it up. The return process was super simple: I printed a mailing label and all I had to do was take it to the post office. (I lost track of the time and missed the mail back date, so I can't speak to how quickly I would have gotten my rebate. They gave me a month, so it's not like they didn't try to help me.) I was using this for a costume in a dance recital and it worked great for that purpose, but the fabric was a little stiff and rough for something that I would wear often. For $20 it was a fine purchase."
4.0,Good value for our ugly sweater holiday party
4.0,"It is heavier than it looks! Otherwise, I was able to fit it exactly for my wrist and it feels sturdy and comfortable.<br />5*"
4.0,This was a gift for my granddaughter she loves it. Nice soft material made well.
4.0,Somewhat smaller but workable. Wear it a few times it stretches. over all happy
4.0,"It's a mesh bag. Working as intended. No complaints, nothing amazing about it"
4.0,"Super cute and good quality, however fixed small on my baby"
4.0,The polka dots are pretty and the dress is very cute
4.0,My son really likes it.
4.0,"This tee shirt dress is casual and comfy. It’s great to throw on after a dip in pool. The material is soft and it definitely feels like a tee shirt. Two things to be aware of—the dress is on the short side, which is fine for pool or beachwear. The dress also runs small, so I would definitely size up. I usually wear size Small and have plenty of room, but this dress felt snug. That’s the only reason I took one star off. For a tee shirt dress I prefer a looser fit."
4.0,Great fit. Looks like the picture. Comfy. Nice business casual shirt. The hubs usually wears tees to work but during meetings with clients he throws on a button-down shirt over that. This one worked out perfectly for his use.
4.0,"Great buy! Would give 5 stars, but it snags easily."
4.0,The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because after a while they get tight on my toes
4.0,Cute little dress shoes for my daughter.  My only complaint is that the flower on one of the shoes is of set a little bit so theh position isn't the same on both shoes.  Feel like they are pretty sturdy and decent quality
4.0,"Comfortable fit, except I wish the pockets would lie flatter.  They look a little awkward as they create a bulge and cheapens the look (which I would expect, given the price.)"
4.0,It is OK quality. It is NOT loose fitting tho. I still like it. It is long and fits more like a dress.
4.0,Very cute but not as pretty as it looked om tne pics
4.0,"Not too bad. I'm sure it's supposed to be off-white, but it looks almost yellow. Okay for the price."
4.0,"great use of space, this thing is HUUUUUGE. like i can't imagine any hairdryer not fitting into this, unless you are using a cannon for a hairdryer. my only complaint is that it wiggles around on the cabinet door when you close the cabinet door"
4.0,"This dress is adorable, but too small. I have similar dresses from MBasic (ordered XL, I'm 5'4"" 195 lbs). The same size with this brand is significantly smaller than that one. I'll have to give this one to a smaller friend, which is a bummer because the color is gorgeous. I'll consider ordering a size up if the price is right."
4.0,"The product looks cool. I wore it at work and plenty of compliments. The only thing I could say is that it affect my ears. Like every other gaiter that slides down, this one pulls on my ears that it hurts. Saw some redness around the ear. So, I stopped placing my ears thru the loop. That was my only negative. Hope this was helpful. Otherwise, it's cool looking. Felt really good on face."
4.0,Did not include install instructions. also no original Disney retail  packaging
4.0,When you order make sure you double the size because they won’t fit!!”” They are soft but to tight.
4.0,Shows private and public land boundaries
4.0,"Great gift thank you,"
4.0,Very cut and nice. But not same for picture. Come differen things. So many missed beautiful item.
4.0,Not as sheer as the pic but have not worn outdoors yet.
4.0,The teal Fossil watchband I bought is a nice color; the leather and stitching are good quality. It's slightly longer than I would like but that's not a big deal to me. The part with the buckle on it measures 3 1/2 inches long including buckle. The part with the holes is 4 1/2 inches. It has 9 holes. The last hole is 1 inch from the tip. A good buy for the ~$8 I paid for it!
4.0,"This dress has good quality, is REALLY cute and fits as expected. I only gave it 4 stars because although you can't really see it in the pictures, there are these small decorative balls along the neckline and around the trim of the sleeves. The ones on the sleeves are ok, but the ones on the neckline look awkward and feel funny on my neck. If you don't mind the decorative balls, then you'll love this dress. Me? I'm actually considering trimming them off the neckline..."
4.0,Received this set in 2 days as promised. The packaging was protective and the bracelets were in great condition.  This is a wonderful set for the price. The choice of bead colors and textures is brilliant! I can't comment on durability yet as I've had a few days. I do look forward to longevity though. ; )
4.0,I bought four different pair of black pants. Three of the four fit fine and it came down to comparing the fabric to the shirt I am going to wear these to for a wedding rehearsal dinner.
4.0,the dress is cute
4.0,"Used it as a part of my Halloween costume. I loved it! The only downside is that some sides don't have a lot of stars on them so when you put it on, you cant really see them. It didn't matter to me so much."
4.0,Exellent item
4.0,Does the job.  Dropped it once in the bathroom and spassed.  Luckily I found it. No one noticed at work altho it's not totally invisible on me.
4.0,Things were nice with Apache pass. The downside the backing on the airings are very very difficult to work with you need tweezers not fingers to utilize them properly.
4.0,Going to buy more.
4.0,"Great fit, with liner for comfort and wind breaking warmth. The only negative was the shipping time. This beanie from Z&s wasshipped from the manufacturer, an quite literally took a slow boat from China! It took about 2 and a half months to get the beanies from Z&s!"
4.0,"Extremely hard to open/close.<br />Don’t line back up once they’re open and one broke immediately upon opening.<br />Although the product wasn’t perfect, their customer service responded immediately and offered a replacement or refund.<br />I already bought a replacement elsewhere but will try other jewelry in the future."
4.0,I woiI would give it a five star because it’s absolutely a beautiful belt I love it it looks just like the picture as advertised the sizes run small so order up I ordered a size large and I’m definitely going to have to order it and ask out because it’s about an inch inch and a half maybe two smaller than the size chart claims the large to be able leave that these are Chinese sizes probably so order one size up but over all look exactly like the picture it’s really pretty good quality real leather beautiful
4.0,"These earrings are lovely.  I love their color.  Lightweight.  These are quite long and can be seen despite my hair, which is good.  It's a little odd the way they hang from the hook but that's minor."
4.0,"This unit works well. For my application, I wanted something that would power up and start playing, which it does. It ""remembers"" the song played and remembers its ""repeat"" state. The LED blinks slow for normal play, fast for repeat play.<br /><br />As others have noted, there are no mounting holes or even very much empty board space for mounting. I didn't need the mono ""speaker"" output or the TF reader, so I soldered mounts to those pads.<br /><br />Also, the ""batt"" input isn't documented. There are vias through the + and - power leads and this makes them pretty easy to use. Hopefully secure that the pads won't pull off.<br /><br />I found the push buttons are so close together that it's difficult to get all four panel holes and mounts close enough together to engage them.  It would have been nice if the layout put them farther apart. I'll probably solder leads across ""Play/pause"" and use a momentary remote switch, since this is the one my application needs most. These pads do NOT have vias, so it will be important to strain-relieve them, somehow.<br /><br />Overall one point off because it doesn't seem much thought went into mounting. Two points off ""thickness"" because it's so irregular as to make it hard to mount with buttons and LED facing the panel.  If you're going to mount to the back of a box and poke at the buttons from the front, then it would be fine."
4.0,I like this item. It just seems to be a little to trendy fo the area I live in. For the price and cuteness I will keep it. The grn color is awesome. So is the blue. I wish I got paid to review. Haha. Love Amazon!
4.0,"The original Italian Bracelets have a gold trim on the outer edges. This one didn't have it. So it looks different than all the other charms. It's slightly higher that the other charms also. BUT, the same reason I dislike it is the same reason I like it. I does stand out and it gets noticed, given it's purpose."
4.0,It’s a nice shirt but it’s just T-shirt material with a pocket. It’s still nice but more casual than I expected.
4.0,"So cute.  Bought it for me, but was too tight, so gave it to my Granddaughter.  She wore it to a school dance and we really &#34;retro'd&#34; it up with white gloves, 50's shoes, petticoat, pearl necklace and earrings and she looked adorbs!!!  She looked like she walked right out of a 1950's film.  She's very shy, but beautiful and everyone at the dance noticed her.  She danced all night.  Belle of the ball!  Worth every penny I spent!"
4.0,Super cute but tend to slip out. Had to put an o ring on the back.
4.0,"Love this TuTu.  Its not as full and thick as the picture, but with black leggings under its perfect for what I need it for."
4.0,"This belt is very versatile.  I bought it in XL so that it would be long enough for low rise jeans.  I can also tighten it when wearing those that sit higher.  It is very good quality, has not split or worn.  I  feel that it was a good purchase for the price.  I also purchased this in other colors for variety."
4.0,Install is tough!
4.0,The nighttime part works good the daytime is not dark enough even with my sunglasses on.
4.0,Looks great! Seems squat proof. Haven't wore them yet for body pump (reason why I bought them) looking forward to wearing them!
4.0,me quedo un poco grande pero es lindo
4.0,VERY hard to get on and off even though I don't have big calf
4.0,"PROS:<br />- Straps are comfortable and provide stability for foot<br />- Looks nice and can be cleaned by just hosing down<br />- Comfortable for short walks and jogs<br />- Can be worn for light hiking on firm terrain<br />- Hold up decently to wear. No visible signs of wear after 25mi/40km of usage so far.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Straps are too long if you have smaller feet/ankles or if you want to secure them tighter<br />- No arch support. The area for the arch is raised by the tiniest amount, but it's nowhere near enough to make longer distances comfortable.<br />- VERY uncomfortable for longer walks. I've walked ~25mi/40km since purchase so they should be broken in. However, wearing them for over 1.5mi/2.5km destroys my feet.<br /><br />Overall thoughts: I purchased hoping to find a comfortable elevated sandal for traveling. I don't think this will cut it as they are very painful to walk all day in, and I tend to walk a lot while traveling. These are great for running errands or a walk in the neighborhood though."
4.0,Overall these are really good and the fit is comfortable. A bit baggy and they do hold in heat. I use for walking so I can't say how they are for riding a bike.
4.0,Average strength umbrella. Was not disappointed with image that it came with.
4.0,"I have the regular version of these without the 'glory hole', and these fit just like those, but the hole let's a bit of my scrotum peek through, wich can be uncomfortable. Other than that, these are a sexy suprise for your lover, and hot to wear.....I use them for masturbation, and maybe if being used for sex, the problem I have with them won't happen.....sexy, soft see through material.....great for the bedroom."
4.0,"First I must of had a bad clip, but once I was contacted by the seller I was sent a new set of clips that has worked very well. Thanks!"
4.0,"The ring was thinner than what I had in mind, but the seller is excellent - very responsive and accommodating."
4.0,"Simple and elegant, not bad quality for the price."
4.0,Nice for the price. Don’t expect Northface/Patagonia quality.
4.0,If you are looking for a sleek light weight watch this is probably a good option.  The watchband can be a bit problematic.  It is a lock in place watchband and can be hard to adjust to the right length.
4.0,"Loved these. They fit as expected and were very comfortable. However, after several washes two of them the zipper will not stay connected. I’m assuming it’s just bad zipper because the other two are fine and I love them."
4.0,"Beautiful and dainty. Very elegant and feminine looking. I haven’t worn it yet, but hopefully it does not fade or tarnish.  If it does, I will update my review."
4.0,I'm size small woman. it fit fine. it is a little darker than pictured but still a great hat! wearing it often and would suggest it to anyone wanting a denim newsboy hat!
4.0,Great costume just a little tight on the arms and legs I ordered a large im 5'7 at 172 great mask and suit mast just needed a little more cut off the one side minor thing you can do yourself and you can also install a black zipper to the back of the mask to it stays tight and really makes it look better
4.0,A little “thin” or maybe I expected it to be a bit thicker since it’s a ski jacket but nonetheless it keep him warm and the sizing was perfect.
4.0,"I can't complain much about these leg warmers except that some feathers come out. But hey for the price, expect some quality trade offs right? I got the long Hunter down boot socks and they are quite pricey unless 6pm bargains them. They do the job and you can pack them small to tote around in your purse."
4.0,"Very pretty.  The material feels nice and the skirt has the perfect flow to it.  My daughter wants it in blue now, too!"
4.0,"I bought this to wear while gardening but it looks so good, I also wear it out and about and get many compliments.  The fushia color is beautiful and the fabric perfect for hot summer weather, light and breatheable.  It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the buttons came off the second time I wore it and the fabric is a little too delicate for heavy-duty work - it's perfect for light and moderate tasks but hard-core rose pruning resulted in a fabric tear.  It's a definite winner despite those two minor complaints.  I'll be buying another."
4.0,"Nice construction, appears goog quality as expected from Giro. Size is a bit small compared to other gloves I've purchased from Giro... but hoping they will stretch with use use. Palm padding is dense and plush protection on the front knuckle/finger areas. Good looking/feeling glove, just wish it was more true to size"
4.0,These are great since they're cheap and you don't have to worry about throwing them around! Good black and yellow.
4.0,"The quality of this product is outstanding, I just am not excited about how it sits on the ear and looks."
4.0,"If you were playing tennis, mowing, fishing, etc… and need your glasses to stay in place for an extended period of time - these are awesome!<br /><br />However, if you frequently misplace your glasses and want something to keep them around your neck, these are not what you want. They are too short and really difficult to get on and off especially if you’re one who frequently removes your glasses.<br /><br />I find them difficult to get on because the attachment slides onto the end of the eyeglass arm.  I feel like the arms of my glasses get pulled outwards in order to get them over my ears and into the proper position. You can’t just slide your glasses straight onto your ears without threading the cable over your ears first and that’s difficult to do because of the shorter length.<br /><br />I’ll definitely use them with my sunglasses during outdoor activities."
4.0,This cotton is the best!  Easy wash and dry. Flows without cling.
4.0,I haven't tried these out yet but got 3 pairs for $11.00. Planning on giving two to my aunts and keeping one for myself.  Glad I found these online and will use when I get gel manicures. The salons I go to don't offer the gloves and sometimes I forget the sunscreen.
4.0,"I love the design!<br />I like this case a lot, the edge is a bit rubberized so it isn't very slippery if it's resting on an angle, good secure fit.<br />Only downfall is I wish the lip on the edge of the screen was a bit higher, other than that I feel it's a safe and secure (and very cool looking) design"
4.0,"Cheap, but perfect for what I paid/needed."
4.0,"Nice glasses for price, but avoid if you have a big head."
4.0,Very nice. It was about what I expected in terms of quality. I ordered it for a ball and it went great with my gown.  I was looking for something that wasn't too droopy but also not a choker. This sat perfect on my neck and had the appearance of something much more expensive.  It really added to the outfit for the evening.
4.0,"Beautiful quality overall, just a bit thinner than expected."
4.0,"Waist is somewhat small, but otherwise pleased."
4.0,"So I ordered both the 00g and 0g cuz people were saying the measurements were off. In the 1st you can see what size they really are, left is 0g right is 00g. 2nd pic is a comparison with these plugs and other brand stone plugs, you can see how much more narrow/short they are so if you have thick earlobes they might not work. Otherwise they're really great and it's an unbeatable price!"
4.0,BABYGIRLS grandpa is going to love them with his dad Father’s Day shirt
4.0,"It’s nice material. Little big for me, kind of thick. Wish it was an inch smaller all around!"
4.0,"Warm, thick, and toasty.  I am a women who wears a men's large, and found the pair to be small for my hands."
4.0,"The Sweater was too big and a bit thin, but can us it around the house. 😊"
4.0,"Works well for a sun shield, the only down side is the case is very difficult to get the umbrella in and out of so it’s basically useless which is a shame."
4.0,"When I first saw this bag, I knew I was going to get it because it was so inexpensive. When I ordered it, it got here ready quickly. I was a bit dissapointed with how small it was but I still like it. It's small enough that it forces me to down-size. Plus, it is really beautiful."
4.0,"This is a lovely necklace that you could absolutely give as a gift. However, the chain is comes with is on the shorter side- so keep that in mind if you have a larger neck or like your necklace to hang low. Additionally, this came in a nice necklace box but was in a baggie inside of the box, rather than threaded through the jewelry holder in the box. You'll want to fix that before you gift it!"
4.0,"It came today!  Love it!  Had to put it on another chain thou, as it broke while trying it on,,,but charm is great!  Thanks."
4.0,"This is a nice running/workout tee,  polyester as are most such shirts these days. My initial feeling when wearing it was that it wasn't as soft as some running shirts I own, but I never gave it another thought on the run. Definitely snug, skin-tight I'd say but not absurdly so. Like most it wicks moisture well. Looks good, too!"
4.0,"This suit is very flattering. The only thing I don't like is that the cup support is a bit on the weak side and it pulls on my neck, where it ties behind the neck. I'm sure I'll get used to it."
4.0,"I love the dress and the color. I get compliments everytime I were it. I'm only 5'2"" so I did need to hem the dress since I wanted to wear it with flats too."
4.0,Shipping took forever but hat is awesome.
4.0,"These leggings are great. I workout regularly and I would not particularly wear these for my workouts; however, these leggings are great for lounging or wearing day to day! They also pass the bend test and don't seem to be see-through!"
4.0,worked perfect for my 7 and 5 year old
4.0,My daughter will love them they are a Christmas gift
4.0,Nice pants I'm glad I ordered them a size bigger than my normal size. They fit great.
4.0,"Runs small. Would suggest 1 size up if you’re hippy, thick. Great compliments wearing it"
4.0,I like this product and it fit good.<br />I use it fishing
4.0,"Slightly smaller than depicted. My daughter likes them, however."
4.0,It's so beautiful! I Love it. It did come in broken... But it was an easy fix! So worth it ❤️
4.0,Ordered this based on reviews that it was flowy and it definitely is a nice coverup. It's extremely lightweight so it's perfect for a hot day. I am a size 2X/18 and this fits nicely. I love the lace detail on the back also. I did not have the same issue as other reviewers with mine being damaged. I can see how it could rip easily though.
4.0,"When I saw these shoes I decided that I had to have them even if I never wore them.  They are too cute!  The length is very true to size (I wear an 8, and ordered an 8).  They DO run a bit wide, but I put a spiffy pair of red and black dotted insoles in them and it helped tremendously.  Plan on putting some in anyway because the shoes have VERY little (actually none) cushioning.  I wouldn't plan on long distance hiking in these shoes; they're more the, &#34;Look at my adorable, red suede shoes,&#34; style.  However, at this price you can afford to own a pair of somewhat impractical, but &#34;darn they're cute&#34; shoes.  I'm just glad my daughter wears a size 6 or they'd be in her closet instead of mine!"
4.0,"The print is nice, as pictured, and solidly printed. The material is thin, so don't wear these for warmth. Also, the drawstring was way too short and slipped inside the waist, when I stretched it to put it on....Argh. . I went out and bought a new one and inserted it instead."
4.0,"Well made. They fit tight to the sunglasses, making it nearly impossible for my daughter to pull them off. That alone, makes them worth every penny."
4.0,Cute top fits perfect.
4.0,"They are ok but not what I expected, because one zipper is decoration and the other almost obsolete, but they are just okay."
4.0,One of the earring backs was un-usable.
4.0,"So my first thought on this is that they look very similar to one another. both the blue plugs look very alike and I couldn’t tell the difference, but then I saw one is more lighter than the other. The black one has little grey spots, but isn’t much and looks like the black from far away. The white ones are perfect BUT overall I think my opinion on these quality wise is very amazing, they are heavy in weight as they are stone plugs, but the only con is photo different from what they show you and what you get. I still don’t think it’s bad for the price knowing that other plugs like this will cost way more than what they sell so I think it’s a bargain and definitely would buy these again. !!!!!  Also huge reminder these are double flared plugs meaning both ends of the plug will be bigger then the middle this prevents the plug falling out!!! if you do not like double flare plugs I would highly recommend buying single flared ones !!!  please read the description they even say s!!!!!"
4.0,this is a great boot for the money.They are on concrete all day and i'm getting about a year out of them.I&#34;ve paid much more money for boots that didn't hold up as well
4.0,"Fits tight but looks exactly like the picture. I’d recommend you going up one size if you don’t like the glove like fit. The material is ok, not too thick or too thin."
4.0,"These are actually pretty nice. I wouldn't recommend if your above a C cup because they don't really hold you up, just good padding for strapless shirts or dresses. They are kind of hard to figure out exactly how to put on so maybe they would hold you up if put on accurately, I still need some practice! But I wore them out and they stayed on the whole time so that's a plus."
4.0,Fits great but doesn't get rid of entire belly.. just makes it little smaller
4.0,The problem with this band is that there is no give. It’s beautiful but tight and inflexible for daily  use.
4.0,Bought for a college graduation.  It worked great! Zipped through the line.  It will be used for all our events that have security lines.
4.0,"Fit great, comfortable, and easy to clean"
4.0,"I like a tighter fit, so bought the small. It measures 6.5"" in length for including the last bead and 6.25"" excluding the last bead. My wrist is 6.4"", so it is too small. It fits on my 9 years old perfectly, but so hard to put it on. Had to return it. Other than that, it is very pretty.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I have then ordered purchased the 6.5""-7"" size almost a year later lol. It was still pretty tight at first, but it became looser as I wore it more. By the way, I shower with it (mainly because it is not easy to put it on and take it off) and had no issues so far."
4.0,I'm 5'10&#34; 150 lbs with a 28 inch waist and the medium/large fit just fine.  I probably could've done the small/medium without a problem.  :)
4.0,"I love the style of these boots and people compliment them all the time. However, the stretchy elastic part gets stretched out pretty easily, which is sad. Also, they crease like crazy really fast. If those things don't bother you, though, I 100% recommend these!"
4.0,"This polo shirt is very well made. It was a little large but my boy will grow into it---and rather quickly, I am certain."
4.0,Very cheap material. It is worth the inexpensive price though.
4.0,"This dress is very comfortable, nice material, cut and color.  The only thing I did not like was there is an additional pleat that cuts down across the lower part of the dress.  Sadly, this additional pleat is not flattering and ruins the dress.  Otherwise it is very comfortable."
4.0,"These seem to be high quality earrings, they feel heavy and sturdy. However, I unfortunately was unable to use them in any of my ear piercings. If you have standard ear piercing holes, you may have difficulty getting these hoops in without stretching your holes because the part you insert is the same gauge as the rest of the hoop. Regardless, they are nice and a great price and I would purchase a smaller gauge hoop from this seller if available."
4.0,The dress is great but material is extremely hard to Remove wrinkles.
4.0,The picture showed it differently.
4.0,"Super cute, but the toes scuff very easily"
4.0,"She loved the shirt, it just fits large. She usually wears 5T to 6, I ordered the 5/6year size. It fit ALMOST like a nightgown."
4.0,I bought this for my little brother. It was everything I had expected. Just like the pictures. It looks rather cool but nothing extraordinary. My brother wanted it after he saw it. He is a watch guy. meaning he likes many kinds of watches. He has worn it a lot and I'm not sure if he has broken it yet but He seemed very pleased. So I am happy with the purchase.<br /><br />It has shown no functional problems or anything to get mad towards its quality.
4.0,"I got the Russell sweatshits with the sweat pants. They're not bulky, but they're ""thick"". I'll buy more. I have big shoulders and arms.. they met my expectations.."
4.0,Came exactly as described. Nice blue color.
4.0,It's a beautiful ring.
4.0,"These are a great quality product.  Sturdy and attractive - well packaged.  Unfortunate for me, I needed clear lenses - not mirrored.  Wish I could have kept them but the return process did not hurt at all."
4.0,"This is my 4th brand of cat socks I've purchased off Amazon in the past few weeks,  and so far they've all been good or great.<br /><br />☆The pattern in the sitting cats is really well placed.<br />☆Soft and stretchy, so it fits my size 7 women's foot well and doesn't cut in to my calves.<br />☆Length puts them right about where my calf muscle starts.  Not my favorite length, but on par with the other brands of cat socks I've purchased.<br />☆They don't feel thin save for the heel (literally the only part you don't want to be thin) so I won't be suprised if the heel wears through soon.  Ideally,  the heel should be reinforced, but since it's not the stretching around the heel really thins it out to the point of seeing your skin between the threads."
4.0,Okay quality .i measured but size L was too big re oreded a medium. .
4.0,Watch if great can't set day or date
4.0,The bra is cute love the design. It gave my chest a nice little push up but it was a little bit tight on my back and I did order up a size bigger. The material is also a little scratchy but overall not bad for the price. Posted a before and after pic. Hope this helps!
4.0,Cute shirt with plenty of room to spare. I bought a medium and it has ample room for large chested girls....which I am not. The material is a blend and has a slick feel to if which helps with wrinkle free care.<br />For reference I am 5'4&#34; and 145 lbs. I wear a 34 b bra...probably should have gone with the small simply because it ends up swallowing me. I do not think this is the fault of the company. Just a sizing difficulty due to breast size. Well-made and I am hoping that I can figure out how to make it more figure flattering. ( belt or what not).
4.0,"to small, woman size"
4.0,The price looked too good to be true.  But I was pleasantly surprised when the dress arrived.  It fits well and looks great.  The material is stretchy and make sure you follow the washing directions exactly or you'll have wrinkles.  I wish it came in other colors.<br /><br />Four stars instead of five because the hidden zipper sticks a little about an inch from the top when I have it on.  I believe this is my fault for gaining a few pounds since I ordered it.  I know better than to force it and I can zip it all the way up when it's on the hanger.
4.0,Exactly what my daughter wanted.
4.0,"This is actually really cute. I am fairly certain itis a knock off of a more popular brand, I feel like someone said Abercrombie somewhere, so I was prepared for the Chinese worst.  But it’s actually totally fine.  I did not need the Large, and I did an Amazon haul in general and everything I got is too big somehow, but anyway...  this cute. I feel like it’s a bit longer than in the picture? But that might be bc of The slightly larger fit of the size I ordered.  For reference I am 5’2”, 158, with a 36 D chest.  I ordered the Large in blue and it’s a bit big but I can totally deal.  The “blue” is not BLUE... it’s kind of like that dog blue, where it’s almost really grey, w some strange hint of a blue tinge lol.. the snap up panel is navy.  I like this combo of colors and it’s flattering for my skin tone and hair.<br /><br />It is WARM. And what’s funny is it isn’t thick. It’s actually a perfect thickness. I wore it straight out of the box and the shirt I had been wearing was not suitable to try this on over, so I took that off and put just this on. It was perfectly good. No undershirt or tank at all. I probably wouldn’t rock it that way always or for a long time but we immediately went out for pizza and I wore it just like that and was fine. Warm. But fine. The snap panel does feel weird on bare skin at first but... I’m pretty sure none of you will wear it bare skinned lol.<br /><br />I like this and will definitely wear it often. It is a bit annoying that it’s not able to taken off any other way other than by the snaps bc it kind of makes it a hassle to take on and off, but I’d def wear this to an outdoor party thing, or a beergaarten, or outdoor concert.  I also docked a star for no pockets. This pullover is screaming for pockets. I might sew one in to the inside as a secret pocket.<br /><br />Overall though I love it. Well sized, soft, good thickness, and cute."
4.0,"The top seems to have extra material in the lower portion/side. When I wear it it makes me look curvier than I am in the hips. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I am okay with it. But the bottoms have way too much extra material in the crotch. It looks like I'm packing heat. I generally wear a M - L. I ordered the M. Might benefit from ordering a small. The color and material is great. Top is breathable. Overall, decent pair."
4.0,Needed to be broken in as they initially gave me blisters. Once they were I was able to spend several hours in them comfortably.
4.0,"Cute, colorful and perfect for the boho look I'm into these days. Goes well with summer style and I am glad I purchased this."
4.0,Runs small but finally found jeans long enough for my daughter
4.0,"I liked the shoes are very nice, comfortable and most importantly they are 100% original.<br />buy them again without hesitation."
4.0,Helpful with anti fogging
4.0,"These are cute socks. They are fun, however the image isn't as clear when worn as when on display in this picture. I got them for a gift bag item and was happy with them. Have a pair myself, fun to wear- but not my top choice for deisgn in aesthetics or comfort. That said, if you're looking for owl socks and these will suit just fine."
4.0,My wife bought this for a friend and is very pleased. Her friend wanted a large but stylish bag and this was perfect.
4.0,Product looks just as advertised
4.0,Very soft and love that they are organic. They are very pink though. This picture show more of a coral or orange but they are definitely pink. They also run a little big I think. They fit my 5 year old and my 2 year old niece.
4.0,This is a beautiful ring. The ropework is very well done. The cabochon is a perfect size for my small hand. The color is wonderful. I'd buy it again.
4.0,Watch band super easy to replace and works great. I just used the clasp holder from my other band though. It kept coming undone. Other than that awesome and love the color!
4.0,"Band looks pretty nice but comes out of the box with all the links in and would probably fit the Hulk. Removing the links was rage inducing, especially when the tool broke first link I started to remove. In the end if I took all the ""open"" links (about 10 of the links have open holes for removal, the rest have been finished and polished) it was slightly too tight. I added one back in and it's slightly to loose. This has always been my experience with this type of band so I'm not knocking stars for that, but I did take a star off for the removal tool being a piece of junk and the frustration I had."
4.0,"I really like this ring, not to big or to small.  The rose gold is very pretty. It's a statement piece. If you have short finger it not the best<br />ring for you. It not good for the ring to over power your hand. True to the picture."
4.0,They were super comfy but they run slightly small.i would recommend these to anyone looking for their staple black shoe.
4.0,"Cute and comfy strappy sandals. They are easily paired with jeans, dresses or shorts. It is a fake leather, but they are comfortable to wear. The buckle is a actually fake so the strap can’t be adjusted. Instead it has a slide clasp. It was interesting but I’ve found to like it. These are priced  accordingly."
4.0,it was a gift and I got no feedback
4.0,Comfortable.  Wore on an 8 hour international flight.
4.0,"Made out of great streatchy/breathable material, however they were a little big for my taste and straps couldnt adjust"
4.0,"Super cute swim suit and fit me perfectly! For size reference, I'm 5'8, 130lbs with super long torso :) The top is a little cheap looking in person but I still love the set together!"
4.0,A nicely finished product which looks great with my formal overcoat.  I'd certainly recommend this product to my acquaintances!
4.0,A little flimsy. Locks were a great feature
4.0,"Durable, but thinner than I thought<br />Quite large and not for a smaller face"
4.0,"I really wanted to like this beanie better, but I cant because it's really one size fits MOST, not one size fits ALL. So if you have a bigger head like me, this is not the beanie for you. It's just not quite long enough. Other than that, its great."
4.0,Estaba Bonito pero se me pegaba mucho al cuerpo
4.0,"Simple yet the quality was pretty good, pockets sized right, felt like it would stand the test of time. However for an extra $5 found a 5 pocket & 7 pocket that extremely high quality. This would’ve had to be much cheaper to opt in to keep this one."
4.0,"A lot more shiny than in the picture, not exactly what I was looking for but they still look great! Not exactly what I was looking for but i still love them."
4.0,"I was quite happy with it..very cute..fits well!  A good buy, definitely!!"
4.0,"Me gusto , es buen producto"
4.0,"First time to use these packing cubes. Only one of the zippers sticks but overall I am very pleased. Would recommend these for travel, and even home closet organization."
4.0,I bought this to go with earrings that have a similar design. They are both beautifully made and good quality for the price. My only wish was that they were a little larger scale. I did keep them since they are such nice quality.
4.0,"I like these earrings. There a little bit larger then I am used to wearing, but I think thats the goal. So it does the job. Plus the stone is much better then cubic zarconia. I recommend this if you want some nice flashing earrings."
4.0,"These are not to bad, material isn't as soft as the other 2 I bought and these are just a tad tight for me.  I gave these ones to my sister, she has smaller fee that I do and narrow."
4.0,The fit was very good. It was also very comfortable.
4.0,Inexpensive item and light weight but still lots of fun.
4.0,"Cute shirt, soft material."
4.0,"Ordered a medium. Super warm, shapely, and the arms were just the right length for my petite frame. I'm 5'2 145lbs 38-32-43 my shoulders are 21&#34; across, my arms are 17&#34; long from my armpit to my wrist. Giving it four stars because the inner &#34;sweatshirt zipper is fine, but the actual jacket zipper is finicky as fack."
4.0,Item is true to size. Fits as expected. Nice quality. Thanks.
4.0,my man love it
4.0,Slid down every once in a while great support and comfy other than that
4.0,"Beautiful item, but the size is off. Still a great item"
4.0,I wear a size 8/10. The XL fits well. So flattering
4.0,"I wish it had a little .25 sign like a real gumball machine, with a little flap where they come out. I gpt it for myself, but its more for a teen/child so im giving it to my daughter."
4.0,Fits true to size. Wonderful color. Looks great.
4.0,Flowing and forgiving. Colorful and fun. Runs big so need to adjust at least a size down
4.0,"I am suprisingly impressed with this set of DDD bras. I usually have to spend between $10-$30 each for a good fit bra in my size. So when I came across this set of 6 for under $30 I was skeptical of receiving a decent bra, but they actually fit and feel great. I like the variety of colors and the wide straps and band help increase the support and comfort. My boobs actually fit in the cups with no spillage! Based on the previous reviews I'm still skeptical about their stand up to washing. But really at this price if can get 5 or 6 wears and washes from each bra before the break down and or the wires pop out, then I'll still call this a win! Will most likely purchase again."
4.0,It was a Christmas gift for daughter. Be she loves it.
4.0,"This sweater is very cute specially for the price, however it faded on the first wash!"
4.0,"I bought these because I thought they looked ridiculous. And they are. They're not bad as a weird covid face shield sunglasses. They're not very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Also do not drive with these on. They will catch the sun and reflect a lot of light. Perfect if you were lost in the desert, or want to blind other drivers."
4.0,Replaces a worn out Russell Pro-Cotton  hooded zip-front...
4.0,"Fit in shoulders and bust but was cut for someone much shorter. Cut out in back was way too high and overall length was way too short. Decent material but if I sized up the top would be too big. Sad cause it really is cute. For reference I'm 5' 7"" and 115 lbs."
4.0,"Gorgeous and great quality. The only issue I have is that they are half the size I was expecting. They look tiny in the package but not bad once wearing. New favorite earrings though, the color and style are great."
4.0,Very nice style and color. I got the gold. It did come a bit dirty so I had to clean it. But it was packaged nicely. I had also gotten this is blue. I like it for the price. Looks more expensive than it was.
4.0,"Good product, delivered when promised. The size was small for me, guess i will just need to drop a couple pounds."
4.0,"I like the design, but the picture shows it to be &#34;sturdy&#34; . it caves in when the purse is not stuffed full. Otherwise I do like it."
4.0,"Very nice shoes but run a little big. My son normally wears a size 2, but these seemed more like a size 3."
4.0,Bought it for my husband and he loves it. Made well! Food price!
4.0,These are Great! Maybe a little flimsy but nothing to worry about.
4.0,I really loved this! I ordered a medium and medium is usually a bit big on me but I don’t like my clothes tight or snug probably could’ve ordered a small but that’s on me really like it material is exactly what it looks like kind of warm fuzzy on the inside definitely a great buy! wish they had it in other colors
4.0,"I ordered a large in this bra but was sent a small. So obviously I can’t fit this but appearance wise, it looks nice. It has a nice stretch to it and appears to have good back coverage. Comes with an extender."
4.0,Great fit & comfort. I needed indoor/outdoor court shoes for pickleball.  They have worked out well and would buy again.
4.0,The look just didn’t work for me and I realized I need pockets in this style.
4.0,Would have worked but order two kinds and kept the other.
4.0,"service was great ,good quality but took a long time for delivery"
4.0,It's not what I expected but I'm sure my sister will be enjoying it.
4.0,"Durable and cleanable nylon bags, pretty colors.  They tend to sag and collapse if heavy things are put in them.  The main problem is they are very difficult to fold up and stuff back into that little pocket."
4.0,"Very comfortable, shrinks slightly after first wash, wish there were less pattern repeats  (I received 4 of the same kind)."
4.0,"Fit to any ear shape, danity ,look's great with up do hair styles, paired with studs pulls off the perfect professional look. Durable easily bendable be careful."
4.0,Love the pants well made how ever i wouldn't exactly call them slim cut which is fine for me but if you want slim cut these probably aren't for you
4.0,It does get rid of odor and dry the shoes very well. The only concern is that the device runs extremely hot. I’m not sure if it is normal.
4.0,Nice . Very pretty
4.0,"240 38 DD 5'7"" picked 2XL fit great"
4.0,"Although for me it was a bit large, but you do need room to breathe"
4.0,"Beautiful dress, well made, it just had giant armholes and didn’t sit right on my body."
4.0,The sizes are difficult to manage I ordered an XXL expecting a normal sized medium and was bit big on me. The fabric is really soft amd besides the sizing everything is fine.
4.0,"I've always liked swords so I just had to have this piece. It looks exactly like the picture. My only complaint is it bends a little too easily, it isn't straight. I never purposely bent it, it just bended over time. However, it can be bended back. Other than that, it's a great little piece."
4.0,"Beautiful and comfortable, but it kept falling down from my face."
4.0,I like these but they are a little loose even though I got a size smaller as recommended by the seller.
4.0,They were nice a d were given as a gift
4.0,great brand but the leak a little bit.
4.0,I guess they just run small. I love the shirts though.
4.0,"It's comfy, stretchy, and I haven't noticed any issues with it being sheer or anything.  It's breathable, but just honestly not my color.  I still wear it from time to time, and will probably buy more eventually just darker colors."
4.0,"bought this one but the link they send me to review was another model, so here I'am...might say on the flimsy side, cause its so light weigh.No buttons, mechanically push up, but its safe. dont pushhard up or youll missed the mark and it will close down on you.The fabric is really good at blocking suns heat. As for the handle it feel small dont know if thats good or bad, i think its the getting used to what u have before."
4.0,"Buttons on both sides of sweater, so its cute but you cannot button this. Just a heads up!"
4.0,"If you order your regular size, this dress won't work.  However, I ordered up by 3 sizes - and am so pleased.  I wore the dress earlier this week with a long duster/cardigan and felt stylish while still being comfortable.  For the price, I plan to buy more of these dresses, for sure!"
4.0,"This is a very nice wallet with plenty of storage space for my needs. My HTC 10 phone fits; there's space for currency, coin, and credit cards; and the two outer snaps allow for adjustment when the wallet is either more or less full. I would have given it five stars, but it's packaged with a packet of scented seeds that I found completely unnecessary and overwhelming. The strong odor aggravated my allergies. Fortunately, once I got rid of the source, the odor quickly dissipated."
4.0,"I really love it. Soo stylish, and big enough on the inside.<br />My only problem is.. I ordered a pink one"
4.0,Super cute goes great with leggings and boots. It's just pretty short
4.0,"These earmuffs came this morning and I think they are so cute.  Needless to say I won't wear them often as I live in Dallas area and it doesn't get deadly cold very often.  However, our wind blows and I shall wear them whenever I can and not look dumb.  The fur is obviously fake but who cares about that...they are very warm.<br /><br />There's not a whole lot to be said about earmuffs but how they look and how much they cost....both of those questions are certainly are plus.  If I had to state a negative it would so small and that would be the metal band that holds it on your head would be better if it was expandable but it's fine."
4.0,"It is like wearing clouds on my feet and walking across a sea of puppies. Comfortable, versatile  and well made. I keep these in my car for post workouts runs, bike rides etc,  they are just what my feet need. the white tend to get dirty pretty easily so dont expect them to look new for long"
4.0,"I own several rash guards from different brands. Tatami offered this rash guard with a nice dragon design in the front and so I bought it. The shirt's material is high quality. The stitching is well executed. The design is awesome.<br />The only issue that I found was the fit of the shirt. I am 5'6"" and weigh about 149 lbs and I ordered a small size. The torso part fits me just right but the sleeves are too loose. I would have liked for the sleeves to fit me tight like other rash guards I have. So I am giving this shirt 4 stars due to the fit issue.<br />If you are looking for a nice compression shirt with good quality all around and awesome design and you don't mind loose fitting sleeves (or you have thicker arms than I do), this will be the shirt for you."
4.0,Very please with thw style and fabric.
4.0,Fits just as expect. Cute details on the shoulder. Not see through at all and great fabric. I always worry material isn’t stretchy enough because i am a 36ddd but it fit good around my boobs without it being to baggy or creating a uniboob.
4.0,"I love the style of this dress and own similarly styled dresses. I ordered the gray, and the color is light and attractive. I ordered a size medium based on the chart in the description. I am 5'6&#34;, 135 lbs, 32DD, and it fit as expected. The material is super soft but very thin. I would not wear this dress without a slip or some sort of no seam undergarments. The dress feels very comfortable and is perfect for summer. The bottom of the skirt hits at my knees. I would classify this dress as casual, and I wouldn't wear it for a &#34;nice&#34; event. The only drawback to this dress is the neckline. The dress is not hemmed in this area, which gives it an odd, loose look. Otherwise, I love the fit and style.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest feedback."
4.0,Bigger and heavy then what I would have liked/expected but overall I’m happy. Super cute is a plus.😍
4.0,A little smaller than I expected but I like them. I would LOVE them if they were polarized but I can't complain for the price.
4.0,"The shirt is cute but thin.  It also ran a little on the smaller size, but ut us still wearable when I ordered my regular size."
4.0,"I only bought this because it was a Lightning deal and the price was really low. I didn't need it at all. However, I did use it in the winter, primarily when using my snowblower to clear my driveway. The sounds was OK for what it is and the Bluetooth pairing was straight-forward. The hat was warm but perhaps a little small. I usually wear a L or sometimes XL in a fitted baseball cap. It was still wearable, but a little smaller than I would have preferred if I had a choice."
4.0,As described... delivered on  time..... properly boxed<br />good deal for the pricing.
4.0,I love them arrive so quick they look so cute but not polarized as advertise just regular sunglasses
4.0,The material is thick and looks great but it runs a little short.  I'm 5'5&#34; and normally wear size 0-2 so I ordered x small.  While it fit me snugly it was a bit too short.  I can really feel the stretch while wearing it.  Hopefully a small will be better.
4.0,Good straps that stay secure on the glasses.  The rubber does pull a bit on my hair but the rubber is why it holds on to the glasses.
4.0,"Wore this dress for my baby shower and it was so beautiful! I’m 165 lbs and I ordered a large. It was actually pretty big on me in the hip area so I should’ve ordered a medium. After some minor alterations I got it to fit perfectly, so it turned out to not be big deal"
4.0,More beautiful in person. good quality. Will be buying more
4.0,Purchased this for my wife.  She has been very happy with the purchase.
4.0,"This bra was made a very soft fabric. I like the design of the bra and the fact that it’s wireless. The added extender was a nice bonus. It ran a little bit smaller than I thought it was going to and unfortunately does not fit me well and the next size up was not available in the color I preferred. Hopefully I can lose a few pounds and try this on again, since I really like the style and feel of it."
4.0,Nice and warm leggings. Inside is fleece and it feels really soft. The fit is a bit weird. It bunches up between your legs so have to wear something long to cover it. Also elastic band on top got all twisted after first wash.
4.0,"3.9 Stars (standard rounding rules apply)<br /><br />My significant other is always on the lookout for new ties. Sometimes I find colors and patterns I appreciate and decide to grab it for him; this is one of those times. Tie arrived within 2 days which was nice. It was packaged okay, though I am never really a fan of ties being rolled up/folded to fit into packaging. As a whole the first impression was okay.<br /><br />Once the tie is out of the packaging the first thing we notice is the smooth feeling of the fabric. My significant other has a particular taste when it comes to the feels of their ties, and this fits the bill - which is half the battle when getting new ties for them. It was easy enough to knot which is great, though it left a lot to be desired in the back.<br /><br />There was no stitching or even glue to hold the back together. This makes me wonder about the long term usage. I am hopeful that it will last considering they wear a tie every day and tend to alternate what they are wearing.<br /><br />As a whole it isn't the worst tie, but it also isn't the best tie. Price point is about middle of the road, maybe slightly less, than other comparable items. For someone who wears ties often, and is looking for a long term investment I may recommend them to shy away from this one, but as someone who is just looking for a special occasion tie - this would fit the bill."
4.0,"I do love these glasses. They are dark, beautiful and just the right style for my face. The packaging was excellent and secure. Great value for the price. My only complaint is regarding how light they are....I’m concerned about longevity.  Will update review in six months to see how they manage with everyday use."
4.0,"These short look and feel good.  However, I am transitioning from the Big and Tall stores to the regular stores in which the clothing is more tailored towards normal body shapes so these shorts are not a baggy as I am use to but they do fit."
4.0,They are a good quality product.  The kids loved them at my grandsons pirate birthday party!  I thought they were a little pricey for plastic  but my grandson and the kids loved them so<br />I  guess they were worth it.
4.0,Me enviaron los blancos y yo pedí los dorados pero están bien
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34;/230lbs and purchased a 2XL. I am very happy with the purchase. The length is perfect and the waist is not binding. The pants are skin tight but it does not feel like you're wearing tight pants. I like this because it allows a wide range of movements without riding, bunching, or shifting. The material has a slight sheen but barely noticeable. The important thing is that the material breathes and feels quite comfortable. I will most likely purchase another pair in the future."
4.0,"Hmmm - I ordered this hoodie (1 of 4 hoodies) in 3XL for my teenage son who’s a larger kid.<br />Of the 4 hoodies, this one ran smaller than the rest - but it fit & he loves it.<br />My title reads “may run small” because I can only go by the consistency of the other 3 hoodies.<br />All in all - we’re very pleased with the sizing and quality of the product.<br />I just wanted to make potential buyers aware that it MIGHT run a little small"
4.0,"I ordered this dress for my bridal shower because my MOH wanted me to wear white. I received it on time, and it fit true to size. It ended up being knee length on me (I’m 5’4”). My only criticism would be that the skirt is a bit see through and it’s made of polyester. Personally, I think it looks like cotton in the pictures, and I’m not a big fan of polyester. Even so, it seems to be well made and it will work for what I bought it for, so I’m satisfied."
4.0,Soooo comfy but suuuuper big. Would order another size but it’s over a quarter of the original price to have UPD pick it up. I am over an hour away from a UPS drop off. Booooo.
4.0,"These pants are nice.  I liked how they fit when I first out them on, however they do not wash nicely.  Do not put them in the dryer, bc they will get shorter.  But if you do not put them in the dryer, they need to be seriously ironed.  Other than that, they are cute and a good/thicker quality."
4.0,Very thin material and runs a size smaller
4.0,"I love the pattern of this suit! The fabric is definitely not sweatshirt material, but it isn't uncomfortable by any means. I did expect an extra large to be quite baggy but that was not at all the case so be aware that you should probably order at least a size up."
4.0,"Not sure if it will work for others, but what I did was continue to tap the watch with two fingers until the white hour marker began to blink. Then I tapped the face of the watch with my thumb or two fingers until it came to the right hour marker. When the correct hour was flashing, I stopped tapping and hoped the white hour light would hold there and that the minutes, which are in blue on this watch, would begin to blink. It did and they did.<br /><br />Then I continued to tap the watch until the minutes were correct. That did it. Just keep fooling with it until you figure something out, because these are the enclosed instructions, which, if anyone can understand, I will heartily salute:<br /><br />""Time Adjustment:  1. When the light touch glass 8 times last hold 2 seconds, when entering tone {?} in quick flashing pattern, when when (sic) touching a jump one hour, by analogy. 2. Adjust good later, hold glass 2 seconds after points in flashing, enter adjustable points mode, touch once plus one points, and so on.""<br /><br />Also, the watch arrived in a tiny barely padded jiffy bag with a piece of waxed paper wrapped around the watch twice. No receipt, nothing but the watch, waxed paper and the above instructions.<br /><br />If the strap is leather--as it is stamped, I would be flabbergasted. But the watch is just great looking. Also, instead of tapping the watch to see the time, I like to just sweep one finger across the face of the watch, keeps it from getting filled with fingerprints.<br /><br />No idea how long the battery will last---others ordering this watch from another company said their watch arrived with dead batteries, but as long as I can change the battery, I will continue to wear this fun sleek looking watch."
4.0,Bottoms run a bit small and are NOT cut as they are in the picture.
4.0,Great quality but was smaller than previous orders from this company.
4.0,"Cute, but a bit expensive!"
4.0,"So the pants themselves are pretty sick! They stretch and squeeze in all the right places. I'm 70 inches and weigh 157 and ordered a large. They fit great. The bottom of the legs though, there's rubber printed onto the material to keep from riding up. That is the ONLY bad part because the rubber starts to squeeze and hurt. I just roll them one layer and the problem is taken care of. Super sick pants though dude. Pretty stoked to rock them on leg day."
4.0,"My boyfriend LOVES this robe! It is super soft and thick, so it's perfect for colder weather. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because he robe didn't come with a belt to tie it at the waist."
4.0,"The color was not as expected, but other than that it was a solid purchase!"
4.0,They are a little on the heavy side for me so I might need some ear-hole stabilizers (that I just discovered exist) but love how these look on me and the beauty of the blue
4.0,"This is a perfect dress. This is more of a size for up to a small size 4. It should fit ages 2-3 really good. This dress is made about as well as a well known Kingdom. It has a hoop slip under the skirting that you have to unfold to make the skirt pouf. When storing, you can fold in a figure 8 twist and it will be flat again. The outside skirt is lots of tulle and the top is made of stretch material with a Velcro closure. Adorable. Just get your little one this cute princess dress."
4.0,Very comfy and airy
4.0,The fit is great. The seam for the peplum seems a bit crooked to me and the material is thin
4.0,Love it.  Reminds me of summers in Maine.
4.0,"Very comfortable and compared to most compression stockings, much easier to pull up.  Normally, with compression stockings it's an absolute battle pulling them up and then taking them off.  These  are much easier when doing both.  Hopefully, they do the job equally as well as other compression stockings regarding good support and circulation of the legs.  I did purchase a second pair so I guess that tells you how pleased I am with them so far."
4.0,"This bra set is super cute, it fits as expected. I highly recommend if you want an elegant/sexy bra and panties set. It came on time as well."
4.0,Perfect for the price. The pink stitching under the bra is a little tighter than expected but overall a great suit for a low price.
4.0,"Have had it about 6 weeks and has held up so far, though the usage is light."
4.0,These shorts are great! The material and cut fit like a pair of shorts for any adventure. However The pair I received have some sewing issues around the side pockets that limit the ability to open them all the way.
4.0,It's lovely; I just wouldn't recommend tall people purchasing this. I am 5'11 and my torso is just a bit too long for it. It still looks great though.
4.0,I'll use it while I'm traveling to my Santa events in pre-suit attire. Was even happier to discover the two filters included.
4.0,"Can't talk and sing much, but ok if only trying to breathe through it."
4.0,"For the price it is amazing...add with a high end shirt and you look fine.  The fabric is heavy, not high end, but it looks great...lots of compliments.  Up close you can see bad stitches...but really, I am buying another.<br />Details: I bought a size 4...it is WAY too small.  I wear a 0 in Ann Taylor and Banana Republic, a 2 in Tahari and Tadashi, an XS in Zella/Athletica, etc....so I went cautious, I am buying this in a size 6 now."
4.0,"I have baught my last 2-3 chains from Gem, all are steardy, can handle my heavist pendents,The chain that you by from gem are on of the best. How ever I did brake on in half when cleaning it.So be careful if you need to shine it up a bit. One major thing I do like is it's not coated with anti tarnish solution, which I allergic to."
4.0,Really funny. Kind of hard to breathe but I have asthma so it shouldn’t be too bad for a normal person. Kinda hard to see out of and weird smell but that’s just the way it’s designed and the fact that it’s rubber.
4.0,to tights on top
4.0,I bought this specifically because of the advertised sizing of 5.1 writs. Mine are about 5.3 and its still a bit too big. I have it doubled up with the magnet all the way on the piece that connects to the watch and its still loser than I would like. Unlike others however it is at least usable - so I may keep this anyway when I want to dress up my Fossil Sport. Just disappointed it canto be my daily use band. It does go onto the watch easily and looks nice
4.0,"I like the top, however the neck opening is a bit too large.  Hard to keep straps from showing......and not good if you bend over."
4.0,After using for a little bit the main zipper broke.
4.0,excellent trader  all as anticipated  AA + Trader
4.0,Very comfortable & quality is good. Love it
4.0,"These are super cute, but I think they run a bit small. I have a small head, and it likes to slip off the top of my head if I don't watch it. Still, such a cute set of patterns!"
4.0,"I like the fabric and fit very much.  I just wish the sleeves would of been a little longer.  I am 5'6, 135 lbs, 36D bust and I ordered a Medium.  Will look cute with boots or booties.  I would recommend this dress."
4.0,Birthday Gift Success
4.0,"I liked these. They fit well, nice and snug I like to wear them under my work shirts to keep myself looking neat. These were perfect for that. They do have an athletic look to them. You could certainly work out in them too"
4.0,Very comfortable but run large. A little too big for me. Great quality material.
4.0,Smaller than I expected but quality ok and good variety.
4.0,Super cute and well made. I am a 38DD and the 1X was a bit snug. Definitely do not put in dryer
4.0,"For first time piercers, wait until your ears are completely healed, otherwise these will re-open the hole."
4.0,"Right fit, Right look! I'm"
4.0,Get little bit bigger will be perfect
4.0,Every single buttonhole was faulty - extra thread had to be broken on every single buttonhole in order for the button to pass through.  (N.B. Top button already quite loose after only a few uses).  Not as warm as I expected.  Nonetheless seems to be a good value.
4.0,"Really fun product, I love it. Ears are a bit heavy though."
4.0,"I really like this swimsuit. My only problems are it makes it seem like I have a long torso when I don't. The cups don't go up far enough because of the length. The cups are also awkward. I think they may be removable. Besides that, I love it!"
4.0,Love this pair of earrings. Its a little heavy but manageable.
4.0,"I ordered these to go with the Red Ranger costume for my son's Halloween costume. They are good quality and look great; really finished off the costume nicely. They were too big, but my average-sized six year old didn't mind at all (about a half inch or so big in the fingers), it's hard to judge glove fit online anyway. Def. recommend!"
4.0,"As others have said, it's hard to see through the mask, even before it fogs up.  You can treat the fog, kind of, but it's useless after dark.<br /><br />Pick your underwear carefully. EVERYTHING shows!"
4.0,"I bought this bracelet for my teenage son, and this is what he has to say about it....<br /><br />&#34;This is a really nice bracelet.  The beads are beautiful and the color in person is true to the color represented on the Amazon website.  The leather ends could have been tied a little better as they are starting to splay.  I also wish it would stay tight on my wrist instead of loosening every five minutes.  The leather straps are good quality.  The two outer bands are a nice touch.  They are braided perfectly and don't feel as if they will come undone any time soon.  The middle band has smooth cuts along the edge and are just thick enough to keep the beads from sliding around.  Overall, this bracelet is really awesome, but it does have a couple of minor details that could have been fixed easily.  As is, I rate this bracelet at four stars, but it could easily be 5 stars with a couple of changes.&#34;<br /><br />I agree that this is a really nice looking bracelet and the quality is pretty good.  I am really happy I was able to purchase it at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  Even though there are a couple of things that keep it from being perfect, my son has worn it every day since he got it, so I would say it's definitely a good purchase."
4.0,I really like this necklace. I had a 100% gold herringbone necklace that broke so I bought this one as a temporary replacement but I may just keep using it. The weight is good and the gold color is not too bright. So far it hasn’t shown any signs of tarnishing or getting darker but I guess time will tell.
4.0,"Nice shirt. Looks excellent and fits well. Only complaint that I do have, and it is extremely minor, is that the material is a bit stiff even after wearing it and washing it twice."
4.0,Very easy to wear with just about anything.
4.0,My granddaughter loves ALL Paris jewelry
4.0,"Looks nice, though one side doesn't open all the way and it's already somewhat small, so it might not fit your head perfectly."
4.0,Sleeves are tight
4.0,These shoes are nice but the height of the heel is not comfortable for the shape of the shoe so it beoomes uncomfortable after wearing for a few hours
4.0,Love this dress!  Have two more in other colors in my cart to purchase later.<br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the color isn’t quiet as pictured.  It’s still beautiful though.
4.0,Like most things I size up if I can't try it on. Shouldn't have with this.
4.0,"Surprisingly effective! I've been profoundly impacted by sounds, particularly more in recent years following a situation which dramatically changed my hearing for better or worse LOL it's changed HOW I hear things, and audio in general can be incredibly beautiful or painfully aggravating, it's weird. Considering I'm buying these for the same reasons as everyone else, plus my particular challenges, I'd wondered how these would work compared to foam inserted ones or over-the-ear can't ever wear in public except a shooting range without looking like a complete dork ones. These proved surprisingly effective for me!<br /><br />These fit very well, just pull back on the ears with opposite hand when inserting; no need to squeeze and twist like the foam ones. Once inserted, the difference noticed is immediate. They're not incredibly comfortable, in that I'll notice physically that I've got them in my ears, though unsure if this can be avoided with this type of product, while still being effective. I've wondered if this sensation will pass more with more frequent use; i.e. using these more might make the feeling easier to adapt to, however I'm unable to do so and will detail that in a bit. Putting the physical aside, it's a nicer experience to block out different distracting and annoying noises, while still being able to hear conversations and music without unnecessary distraction.<br /><br />The case is a nice feature, as these could easily accumulate dirt and dust when not in the ears. They're easy to clean too. The case and plugs themselves are good, yet have some unpolished edge extras that can be trimmed up with a scissors. Considering the current price around $14, and imagining the greatest part of delivering product to consumer includes the case and shipping/packaging, I would have liked to see these come with an extra couple plugs. They're prone to getting lost and possibly damaged just due to the nature of what they are. Anything we're carrying around with us and inserting and removing regularly has many opportunities to fall and get lost, which is what I'd experienced. Bizarre part of my story is I'd gone to photograph the case and ear plugs to better help describe what I'd detailed above. I'd put the case on my desk, removed one of the ear plugs and placed it on top, and went to the other room to find my camera. When I returned, the one sitting on top of the case was gone! Did I jinx myself thinking these would be easy to lose? LOL I've got no clue! Kept looking around for these with a flashlight, as couldn't imagine it rolling too far away, though maybe it bounced somewhere.<br /><br />I did get an opportunity to test these over several days before losing the one. Hopefully it turns up again. I keep checking my robot vacuum dirt bins and who the heck knows, maybe it inadvertently became a cat toy. Keep these in the box they come in. Good product, sadly (for me) very easy to lose! LOL<br /><br />I received a discount on these in consideration of my testing and review. Cheers!"
4.0,"very cute, but the white is a little see-through (I also bought the dark blue and you can't see through it), so maybe make sure you're wearing panties and bra that are close to your skin tone."
4.0,"Looks almost as good on me as the model.. fit as expected.. It is washable,, I'm careful though about the laundry.. I wouldn't throw this in with anything."
4.0,"Comfortable fabric, next time I'll order a small"
4.0,Proud to wear the Panther mask but wished it included the university initials.
4.0,"I'd do 4 1/2 stars if I could. This is so close to being perfect. It's very cute and slimming and I love that it actually covers my bottom. It's a very sexy retro swimsuit. However, even ordering up two sizes (normally a medium, got an XL) the suit seems shorter than I anticipated. I am 5'5&#34; and measure 36-30-36. So, I'm not very tall or anything, but I feel like the top of the suit fell just slightly below a comfortable area for the breasts. I'm a C cup, the cups fit great but I had to tie the halter pretty tight to give it some lift and make the suit &#34;taller&#34; if that makes sense. Other than that it was perfect. Over time it'll probably stretch out a little and fit perfectly. Hope this helps someone!"
4.0,Reduces eye strain very well. No complaints.
4.0,"I originally bought this for a cosplay costume (Chise Hitori), price wise this seemed like a good idea. Now the quality of this Vest is very good and worth it for the price. But I gave it 4 stars because of the size.. I’m 5’5 and usually wear a medium in women’s so when I order in a guys clothes I always go up a size to make sure it’s baggie, which was needed for this cosplay and when I put it on I had a basic white button down underneath. The fabric is so stiff that it does not sit right and I would consider it smaller than I thought. When i have worn a large in men’s it’s always been bigger on me so this was a little bit of a let down however it could just be the fabric which I haven’t dealt with before so I’ll update this post after handeling with it for a bit. I just recommend to size up by 1 size"
4.0,The string is sticking out a little from the end ... so 4 stars
4.0,"This was a present for my sister. It was much bigger than expected, very pretty. She loved it! The only complaint I have is that there was not tracking on the package and took a long time. Otherwise, very nice."
4.0,makes your hands look huge!
4.0,Great for lounging or out on the town. The polyester allows it to stretch a little. Runs really small tho....not true to size or color.
4.0,"It is on the cheaper side of material, but it is comfortable to wear. The jacket is a lot darker than the pictures.<br /><br />This part doesn't apply to the product, but yes to its packaging, the warnings in English are completely misspelled. I understand that English is not everybody's first language, but Google exists for a reason."
4.0,"The quality of this shirt seems great, but it runs a bit short..."
4.0,The skirt fit nicely.  I like the pocket and the length on me.
4.0,No complaints at all best purchase ever
4.0,The colors are bright and beautiful.
4.0,"Good coverage of the eyes. I use these for driving, perfect for reading instruments in the car. I need glasses that are very dark, these work well for that.<br />Cons, the nose piece started to break down into a sticky mess after 5 months of daily use and left black marks on the bridge of the nose. Arms pressed a little too hard behind the ears. Sadly one arm broke off after 11 months, but I like them enough to reorder and they are cheap enough to replace."
4.0,Used to wear to the gym.
4.0,"beautiful hat, very elegant"
4.0,"Love this top, but took away 1 star because it states not to put in dryer - hang dry instead.  I know over time either my husband or I will forget and probably put it in the dryer.  The sizing and fit is good, maybe runs a little small.  I usually wear a Large in uni-sex t-shirts and a Large or XL in women’s knit tops.  I ordered an XL in this top and it fits well.  I washed it in cold water in the washer and hung it to dry.  It dried without a wrinkle whereas the other t-shirt I ordered which was cared for the same way was very wrinkled and needed a light touchup https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BVMY3B2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />I plan on buying another color in same style."
4.0,Exactly as pictured and super comfy.  I'm 5'3&#34; and roughly 145 lbs so I ordered a large which fit as expected.  This dress is super comfy and soft which super important as I'm wearing it for a Lumpy Space Princess cosplay.  The only negative thing I have to say about this dress is that When I went to put it on a seam audibly ripped.  The seam that is under the bust and when I applied minimal tension to this seam it ripped.  There is no visual rip but somewhere a string or two popped.  Still wearable and looking as pictured!
4.0,Love the look of this bag.  Kind of on the small size.  I use as an office purse.
4.0,I liked the earrings but the color was not the same as pictured.
4.0,"One  slipper was a little dirty the other was fine, I'm a size 9 and it's a tad big"
4.0,"Nice quality shirt but it is way too big. Because of the reviews, I sized up and I was swimming in it. Pick your normal size. I gave it four stars because the quality of the shirt was perfect. The lettering is not cheap looking like some other shirts like this that I have seen. Def size up or it will be way too big. I am 5'10 & 190lbs and the large would have been the perfect fit."
4.0,"This purse is great for holding everything I need , from going to work, running errands, or shopping out of town. Strap is great length, love all the pockets. Will buy another one if I have a need for it."
4.0,I use it everytime I go surfing and it works well
4.0,This runs a bit small in size. I ordered a xl and it just barely fits! Thank god it has a bit of stretch to it or I would of had to send back. Love it otherwise!!
4.0,"220, 5'8 and usually size 2x, got the 2x znd its a tiny bit snug. If youre a big girl who likes to show off, it is definitely not too short."
4.0,Not exactly as pictured. A little lighter. Im sure its just a variation in stones. Great bargain.
4.0,"I have a funny-shaped head, so it's a little tighter than I would like, but, it's not uncomfortable. The color is even better than in the photo."
4.0,Super tight on my hips and booty. If you’re curvy like me it’s going to be tight. Which is a bummer because it’s a very cute dress and the print is so unique!
4.0,"Nice, light and stylish. Fits as expected and described and good length. (I'm 5'9).  Would order again in different colors."
4.0,"Super cute top & great quality, however the sizing runs super small. I typically order an XL for flowing kimonos, however I ordered a 2X and it barely closes"
4.0,These fit my man great. I need some too but they are not quite feminine enough for me
4.0,"Pretty dress. Fabric thinner than I expected. Probably better for a shorter person (I'm 5'10&#34;). Being tall, I am not new to this phenomenon. Dress is going back."
4.0,Love the look of these and they fit well.  Down a star because they scratch very easily.
4.0,I love my sunglasses.  I had a pair of Ray Bans. But it some how it vanished. A year with out sunglasses is hard. Especially when you live in Hawaii.  I found the pair that i have in Amazon. I live them. They are cute and fit properly. Receiving an email that buying a pair would help someone in need was all the more pleasing. Thank you so much. I will tell friends and family about this organization.  I will purchase more sunglasses.  Thank you.
4.0,"The chamois is as good as my $250 Italian bibs.<br /> They do what they’re supposed to do. I wore under tights on a cold day mountain biking in the woods and also wore under MTB style Bermuda shorts.<br />My only area to improve would be the waist band. The elastic digs a little. Would be nice to have a flat waist band vs elastic, but for under $20 they can’t be beat.<br /><br />I’d order these again for my more casual rides of 10-25 miles or so. I’ll stick to my bibs and kits for the serious cycling, but simply because I like the styling and higher quality materials in the shorts part.<br /><br />Chamois is very personal, but in my 20 years of riding this has as good as any I’ve tried, and better than a lot of bug named brands. The  black material not sub par, just meant to be a liner, not shorts or compression."
4.0,Looks just like the picture! Looks like it's handmade. It's a little longer than most lanyards though.
4.0,"No issues with anything, and this bracelet is cute!"
4.0,"I bought these earrings to wear at my daughter's wedding.  The stones are nicely cut and embedded in the setting.  The only thing I did not like were the back pieces especially if you are wearing your hair in an up do.  Otherwise I think the design, size and overall product are great considering they are not &#34;the real Mc Coy.&#34;  I plan on wearing them in the future as well.  Good purchase."
4.0,"Beautiful watch. Low profile like I wanted, but the dial is much larger than I expected. Will use it until I find another, then regift it."
4.0,it's a great product.
4.0,"It's nice but the shoulders make it look like I have a wide back, I'll shrink them before using it"
4.0,It's a tie! Nothing great about it. Nothing bad about it. The texture makes it a bit nicer than a solid black tie but it is nothing special.
4.0,"Fit is nice. Padding and cup are nice. However, less one star because the bottom part rolls up with movement and becomes uncomfortable. Constantly have to readjust."
4.0,The black can be dressed up or down.  Still a more casual shirt which is comfortable. The black attracted fuzz as that type of material is prone to do
4.0,"Lovely ring. Very shiney. Only downfall is you can't read the writing because its so small. Still like and will wear it, though."
4.0,It's a cute little dress. It's a little shorter than I thought it will be but a pair of shorts underneath will fix that.
4.0,"It does what it supposed to do. It is a lot lighter than the pair I am replacing. These are lightweight and seems like it could break.  For the cost,  I didn't mind because I use them for school. I didn't want an expensive pair around. They cover my glasses, but the side is a bit narrower than I expected  because it doesn't quite cover the sides of the glasses."
4.0,This is a funny apron for your favorite grill master. Not particularly durable and rather thin but it’s a great gag gift for the money.
4.0,"This product was a good deal for the price. It was exactly what I was looking for, and was true to the listing."
4.0,"I liked the scraf. Decent qualifty. Verfy thin so not much for warmth, but great as an accessorie in the spring, etc."
4.0,Pockets were awkward so I took them off. A little shorter than I thought but pretty true to size
4.0,Like..bought as a replacement band for abalone faced watch...great band but difficult to cut to size.  I cut each link down w wire cutters but great admiration
4.0,Just a little tighter than expected. Full coverage
4.0,I loved the colors and the &#34;beachy&#34; vibe. I love the zipper and the big it is. Can't wait to take it to the beach in a few weeks.
4.0,"160lbs on a good day, 5’6”, 38D, 33” waist<br />I hate all the mom swim suits!!! I want to look sexy but I don’t want to show off all my junk. I LOVE THIS SWIM SUIT!!"
4.0,size was good....just alittle narrow
4.0,Perfect size for my 2 year old and super cute just a little wobbly and not straight
4.0,"I ordered a 'Moyabo Women's Casual 3/4 Sleeve Round Neck Twist Front Party Wedding Pencil Dress' for review.  My wife wears a size 8 dress and the large fits her perfectly so I recommend ordering up a size  It is flattering on but the material is lightweight.  The stitching was done well with no holes or weakness in the seams.  When washed it does wrinkle quite a bit.  My wife wears it with a pair of leggings to add a little more warmth.  But, Overall, she wears this dress quite often.  I am not sure it is really dressy enough for a cocktail party but it works well for work attire.  Overall decent quality, good price."
4.0,I like it.  Not too much in to the material but it still looks good on me
4.0,I really like these. They aren't too thin which is nice so they aren't see through. My only complaint is that one pair got a hole in the crotch after only one wear. It was easy to fix so it's not a big deal.
4.0,The inside shorts are baggy and could definitely be tighter.
4.0,The bra doesn't do much in the support department so I layer another sports bra underneath. I'm a 36c so I'm not extremely large. It looks really cool and I get a lot of compliments at the gym.
4.0,EVERYTHING OF GOOD QUALITY
4.0,"It is a nice jacket. Well made, zippers work without issue. I normally wear a 2 XX this jacket is nowhere near fitting me. We kept it because my wife can wear it and she likes it too."
4.0,Bought this as a gift for my daughter to be add to her charm bracelet. She loved it.
4.0,Seam to be fine
4.0,This item did not fit my needs because I ordered incorrectly. Please be mindful of the consumer's responsibility and opportunity to review and consider purchases. The product was given to my friend for whom has been very good.
4.0,"I would love to give this dress 5 stars because it's comfortable and beautiful. But the length of the skirt not what I was expecting. It barely reaches my mid calf and the color is more orange than red.<br />Still, it's a great dress and I get a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,"It doesn't fit my face great, but non-masks usually don't. This is better than most goggles for my eyes. It does not leak and field of vision is pretty good. Good buy overall."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:feca1f6848ff048d6012eacd468f68b0]] These are GREAT for a cute hair wrap, but please don’t use them to prevent disease spread. They are much too thin."
4.0,I love the pendant. The chain is already starting to discolor.
4.0,"What a cool bracelet, nice quality, and great price. Only thing I haven't cared for is the lag in shipping. Other than that I have no complaints."
4.0,Lovely cuff bracelet. I do like it but it is slightly heavy.
4.0,Very pretty top. I liked the look. Take note that this top is fairly thin almost to the point that you need to wear something underneath.  It's also a little snug around the hip area and this material doesn't stretch at all so if you are a little hippy like me buy the next size up. Over all a very pretty blouse.
4.0,"I bought a 3 pack to wear at the gym. The first 2 fit absolutely perfect! The pocket is big and deep, perfect for my phone. The last pair was SO much smaller I almost couldn't even get them on. They were so tight and gave me a muffin top that I don't normally have, they also slide down as I'm walking because they are so tight. I don't wear those ones unless I've forgotten to do laundry, then I need to wear a long shirt as they start to slide off while I'm on the treadmill."
4.0,"Thin material but not TOO thin. Elastic waist is quality. Great for warm weather, and SUCH a cute pattern. Love these."
4.0,"The top looks great. I sized up according to the size chart. The bottoms are made pretty small, which most of the time when I purchase bathing suits like these they are."
4.0,"They seem to be made well,  but the one hoop is crooked but still closed. Like that they are silver and channel set stones. Very nice for every day."
4.0,These rings are perfect. My girlfriend loved hers and the only bad part was I didn't realize there was Nickle in the ring ( which I'm allergic to) to I have to wear it on a chain.. Otherwise I love these rings.
4.0,It is a very cute and comfortable costume. My only problem is the headband as it is a little bit uncomfortable and feels like cheap thick plastic. Everything is great though and very nice !
4.0,Bottoms are very small... I purchased it planning on wearing a high waisted bottom with it. Top fits as expected and is good quality. the price is good for even just the bikini top although I wish the bottoms were a tid bit smaller. Im a curvy medium. I ordered a XL expecting it to run small
4.0,One of the chokers arrived broken. Other than that it’s beautiful!
4.0,"The sweet and the gummy bear charms were amazing, extremely cute, but the lollipops? By the time I had gotten them one had already had the screw out, and one of the lollipops from<br />the green pair was pretty much just white, barely any color. The sticks of the lollipops were also different lengths, that part doesn't bother me all that much but if it does with you, I wouldn't recommend buying."
4.0,"Comfortable, as expected. Im 5'1&#34;, stops a little above the knee."
4.0,I love these bras. Not a lot of support though. I should have ordered a smaller size. I’m 36B and ordered a large.
4.0,Will be a holiday gift for child who likes to play dress-up.  I did not like that there was no indication of size on either the dress or the plastic wrapping so I was not sure if it was size I ordered.
4.0,liked very much to my wife
4.0,"These pants run true to size on the inseam measurement but a bit snug at the waist. If you're unsure about the best waist size, round up, not down. They are made from quality gabardine wool and nicely detailed. I found the leg a bit too roomy for my tastes, especially from the hip to the knee, so I'm having them altered. But at $55 they're worth the added alteration expense."
4.0,"The cut is not as flattering on larger body frames, but the robe is cute and silky soft!"
4.0,It was a gift to a friend
4.0,Msg as described
4.0,"The material is ok, if only it fits me I would have been happy."
4.0,Good quality and came early.
4.0,"First off I purchased a XL because i don't have dainty hands, but i do have small hands. Those were too big, Contacted the seller to see if i could get their smallest size which is a medium i believe. Seller replied quite quickly, asked me a few questions, and sent another pair, didn't even ask or want the mistake pair back which was awesome, not that i can wear them anyways, but its hassle free which is what i like. The touch screen works great, with most gloves you have to get your finger on the phone just right but it does work and i'm not disappointed with that. The fit great, only a few centimeters longer than my fingers but not a big deal, everyone's hands are different. The anti-slip is great for holding your phone too, the only reason i rated it 4 and not 5 was because my main purpose in these gloves were to keep my hands warm while riding my bike in the winter. About a half mile my fingers start getting cold, which is a shame because like i said that was my main reason for purchasing them. I'm sure you can get a larger size and place hand warmers in them to make them work BUT you shouldn't have to do that if the gloves indicate that they are thick and warm which they are thick but your hands still get cold from the weather."
4.0,"I use this product in an army-surplus style shoulder bag. It really helps keep my stuff organized. Takes a few extra moments to put stuff back into the grid rather than just tossing it in a pocket, but it is worth it!"
4.0,"I would really love this product if the spot where the pins are located were a little more flush with the watch. The feel of this band is nice, if not a little shiny. The clasp holds firm. The band doesn't pull at are hair the way others like this can tend to do. This really just is a great watch band and it looks great!"
4.0,"This dress came nicely packaged in a bag. It fit as expected and was exactly as shown in the picture. I returned it, simply because I found a dress that worked better for my wedding rehearsal dinner."
4.0,Great socks fit is true to size very warm and comfortable.
4.0,"It's a little tight but I have muscles so I'm not complaining. Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase. Arrived quickly!"
4.0,Ordered a size up. Great choice!
4.0,"I bought the sky blue color.  Make note that each color is actually a different style, and I am not sure why they are all listed under the same &#34;elegant coffee&#34; heading.  The sky blue suit is adorable, but not two pieces as the pictures would imply--the last photo shows separate bottoms, but actually the bottoms are attached and with out the cute belt embellishment shown in the photo. However, it is comfortable and extremely flattering, and modest without being too &#34;meme-ish&#34;.  I usually wear a small (4) but bought a medium, and feel even that is a tad tight.  The suit under the ruffles is just mesh-y pantyhose-ish white, and isn't very &#34;controlling&#34; but the cute flirty tiered ruffles hide everything.  The top is padded and fit me well.  I think this suit would be flattering on many body types, and I am glad I took the time to look at each color choice and how the styles were different."
4.0,pros: mask is 3 ply<br /><br />Cons: ear loops break easily and the mask doesn’t stay in place for too long
4.0,I ordered this necklace and received a different one (two interlocked hearts). I honestly like the one I received more so I'm not upset. I'm rating this on the quality of the necklace because I'm sure they're the same quality. It hasn't turned my skin green and all of the rhinestones are sturdy. This is surprisingly well made for what it is. I received it for free from AMZ Review Trader.
4.0,I buy two for my son they loved
4.0,Love my cute little lucky elephant
4.0,"It is leather, but feels like bonded leather. Can't really tell. But it works. I removed the snap rind and installed a split ring. I leave the car key inside, but have to remove it to lock the car. It works well now, no wear after a couple of months."
4.0,Very cute as a gift. I never noticed the dimensions of the charm and was kind of disappointed with how small it is compared to the mother with two children charm I bought a few years ago.  Still a nice charm though.
4.0,"this bracelet is off the chain it is so hotttt!!! i wish they had more colors, i would order them all..i wore this to work and kept getting stopped asking where did i get the piece."
4.0,The bag arrived on time. The material is amazing. I can fit everything I need in this bag and it doesn't look or feel bulky.
4.0,will grow into them I hope
4.0,"Bought for my husband.  He seems to like them, they are true to size."
4.0,"It is beautiful but I have had a really hard time getting it open, especially when my Fitbit is inside, so because of this I won't be using it very often. It makes me sad because it really is very pretty and I did get compliments when I wore it."
4.0,Looks great on my wife and the size was perfect
4.0,Great shorts but way too small
4.0,Cute gift. My friend liked it a lot. Seems sturdy. Not cheap looking.
4.0,Seems well made of aluminum
4.0,Like the dress!! I “Would” love it “IF” constructed with a longer front and back and higher sides. Just Reverse staggered bottom hem!!! I’m 5’ 4” and can just barely wear this as a short sundress IF I wear 1” inseam yoga/bike shorts. It would be perfect (again) IF with a longer front and back bottom hem and shorter side hem!! Love the directional stripes and material!!
4.0,The bag is a perfect size for walking with my essentials. But the surprise was when I realized it’s reversible. It folds like a book that you can open and flip. So one side is blue the other black. They both have the same zippers and storage. The only problem I have is there is a a small Velcro strip outside which I fear will snag on some clothing. This may be a big problem so I only gave it 4 stars.
4.0,"Nice sweater, but too too large. Had to teturn"
4.0,"I like the product, because it was a gift for my daughter."
4.0,"Very nice, but belt was a little small. I thought that was odd because everything was correctly sized."
4.0,Love this style !!  A tad tight in bust area and a little long but with my wedge shoes it was fine ( Im 5'2 & a 38 C ) . Plan to buy more !!
4.0,They are very good ones
4.0,The material was then and it was very long and the dress has a stain of sone sort in the very front like the company died it lighter in that area but rather than return it I just kept it.
4.0,These feel like satin which feels nice against my skin.  They are tighter across my breast and very loose everywhere else.  They kind of have a triangle shape so I wear them tucked in.  The handle the wash just fine.  The straps are adjustable which really helps with fit.
4.0,So far so good everything I expected like the slim form & it's of good quality...<br />don't think I'll be disappointed
4.0,"The material seems a little cheaper, was hoping for a stronger material"
4.0,Comfortable with a snug fit.  The fabric and seaming are not top quality. This top actually cost more than a better constructed one that I bought at the same time.
4.0,Cute pants. Just thin material and shows panty lines very clearly. Other than that I like them!
4.0,"I loooove this print!! Only thing there are no seems at bottom, bit weird for ""pricy"" leggings and they are not as high waisted as on pic, otherwise color is even better in real, size fits as expected. Great buy"
4.0,"Very nice Key Chain...well made, looks great. Lettering A Little Small."
4.0,"It’s very lovely, flattering, soft lace beautiful colors .  Husband is happy with it also 🥰"
4.0,Nice fit and quite comfortable.  It's slightly more shear than I had anticipated.
4.0,My husband likes the glasses very much. It is great that it comes with interchangeable lenses. I just wish there were instruction on how to change the lense.
4.0,Looks great but will find out after the first wash if it stays the same
4.0,Bought as a gift for my boyfriend and my son. both loved them. Look great and chain fits good on both.
4.0,The shoes are great but the first time she wore them both insoles detached and her foot slid back and forth. Good deal for the price but could be a little better quality. We needed them ASAP so they’ll do.
4.0,"I received a red model of this lightweight backpack in exchange for my review.  Even though I didn't pay full price, I will still review it like I would if I had paid full price.  Here are my observations:<br /><br />--very lightweight<br />--strong fabric with waterproof qualities<br />--it's storable in its own pocket, which is great for traveling<br />--there's ample space for a day hike or to use as a carry-on bag<br />--nicely constructed but a few loose threads here and there<br />--very little padding in the shoulder straps (it wouldn't be very foldable in its pouch if it had a lot of padding)<br />--there is a chest strap<br />--the zippers work smoothly<br />--the pulls for the zippers are durable<br />--several pockets/pouches to help keep things organized<br /><br />The seller mentions that this would be a good backpack for school.  I'm not sure I agree with that since textbooks are usually heavy and nowadays students often carry computers or tablets with them.  I think the backpack is certainly strong enough to carry a full-size laptop but it offers no protection against being dropped or bumped.  As for textbooks, I would worry that the corners of hardback books could wear through the material fairly easily.  Otherwise, I can see using this for hiking, day trips, as an overnight bag, for carry-on luggage (except for the computer issue), going on excursions with children who need snacks/changes of clothes/drinks, going to the beach....there are lots of uses for this backpack.  If you're not planning to put a lot of heavy things in it, it should serve you well for a long time."
4.0,loved it and it was cute
4.0,Flexibility & sturdiness are matched well in that it goes on easily  yet stays put.<br />Doesn't discolor with regular wearing. Weight feels nice.<br />Occasionally gets caught in long hair
4.0,"The hat was cute. The quality wasn't that great, but it was good enough for rare use."
4.0,I would order again. like Velcro strap to secure fit
4.0,I was just kind of upset because there is no latch to keep the coffin closed
4.0,"I love this dress! The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because the right pocket seam came out. Easily fixable but I would expect better quality on that. Also, I wish that the waist was a little lower. It sits a little high. Other than those things it’s beautiful and comfortable and for the price it’s perfect. I will probably buy another one. I love the front pockets."
4.0,Bought a size up than normal. Was hoping to be able to layer this for cold weather. Fits snug.<br />Happy with the looks.
4.0,Offered nice protection for the screen of the watch.  I do wish it was a little sturdier.
4.0,"For reference I'm 5'9&#34;, about 130-135lbs, 34 C chest and I ordered the Medium.  First a little back story:  I suffer from some difficult chronic illness issues and wanted to buy a comfy, casual dress to wear around the house once in a while during the warmer months -- something other than lounge wear - something pretty!  And it is quite pretty.  The Medium dress fit me well in chest/waist area and as expected, except, it is incredibly long to the point it was dragging on the floor.  This surprised me a bit, as being a taller person, i often struggle with the opposite problem -- items not being long enough for my height and longer torso!  I have to wonder how the shorter women will manage this dress if they are all this length!  With a pair of wedges or heals, this could have maybe worked for me, but not with my comfy flats I must wear.  I walked around with it on and could clearly see that this could be a tripping hazard for me, so it has to go back.  I did notice another woman who was also 5'9&#34; left a review on this same dress saying she felt it *was not* long enough, so either this is a difference in taste between the two of us, or the lengths in the individual dresses aren't consistent!  So basically, I guess you have to try it and see what you think.  Another note, the material is a heavier weighted, stretchy, springy material.  It was okay, but may not be the coolest, lightest fabric for hotter weather.  So if you are looking for something light and airy and extra cool, this may not be for you.  However, if not for the excessive length, I would keep it and be happy with the purchase."
4.0,"I really like the design and the product. Only issue I have is there is too much material at the top of the mask before the Spider design begins.  If used as is you don't get to see the design,  you will need to roll the top down about 2""  creating a bulge on your nose in order to see the design when worn.  Recommend manufacturer reduce the amount of material from top of mask bringing the Spider design just to the nose area displaying all the artwork.  Thanks, MK"
4.0,Cute and stylish!!
4.0,"These fit fairly well and are definitely more comfortable than an underwire. They look really nice on. But after wearing them for a few hours the structure on the side really digs in and isn't very comfortable. I think maybe it's just a little too long. But if you don't have to wear it a really long time, it's a nice, pretty bra"
4.0,"The shoe is a little roomy in the toe region and the fit is 1/2 size larger than what it says (i.e. size 8 will feel like 8.5), but that is a good thing for warmth and allows you to wear 2 pair of socks.  This is a great shoe to wear for muddy/rainy and cold conditions.<br /><br />Minor complaint: the shoelaces are way too long, so you should triple bow tie them and then stuff the extra underneath the laces to avoid them getting wet."
4.0,Too small. Size advertised is not what I received. Not worth the effort to return all the way to china. Will keep despite...
4.0,"Loved it, just a little tight in the arms! I am 180 at 5’9”. I’m on the thicker side."
4.0,"Loved the fit and feel. The decorative ‘balls’ on the sleeve were loose and had to be reinforced. Normally, I would have returned the item but due to price & quality I kept it and reinforced the decoration on my own."
4.0,"This little black dress is a nice, simple casual fit. The material is not the greatest but it does feel very nice on. I am 5'2 and 120lbs- I ordered a small and it does fit on the looser side. I do prefer my clothes tight and I am hoping it will shrink after being washed. Overall, it is a cute dress for any occasion especially since it can be worn long or short with the adjustable ties on each side."
4.0,nicely made and very sturdy.. just a little heavier than I would like for ordinary keys every day
4.0,"I usually wear a small or medium top, however I ordered a large and XL. The large was a little too restricting for my taste but the XL fits perfectly. Material is thin. But what can you expect for $5? I would recommend the product."
4.0,It's nice 😁
4.0,Tasted great!
4.0,"Haven’t used yet. but it’s a nice size purse, can’t go wrong with the purchase."
4.0,"I used this dress for my Halloween costume, but it's so comfy, cozy, and soft, I'd buy it to wear it. It's a light, thin material, but I wore black shorts and a tankini underneath and neither showed through the material."
4.0,"I ordered a Large because everyone was saying to do that in the comments. They were right, The large fit like a medium should."
4.0,Items is a pictured and good quality.  Sweater is heavy and thick.  As others mentioned I'd wear it more like a light coat perhaps.
4.0,wish the material had some stretch to it. Beautiful color and pattern
4.0,"The watch was as pretty as pictured and came very nicely packaged (great if you want to give as a gift) however, it was not quite small enough for my wrist. My wrist is 6 1/2 inches where I like to wear my watches so I did have to remove 2 links (well, my jeweler did). I did know this ahead if time by looking at the band length but just thought I would try to help some of you avoid doing the math. Face is also a bit large for my taste on my small wrist but not so much that I'd send it back. Hoping that it holds up well because in general I do like the look."
4.0,Like the jeans but a little tight from the knee to the ankle.
4.0,"OURIN Womens Strappy Sports Yoga Bras<br />Longline Wirefree Padded Medium Support<br />Fitness Workout Top<br /><br />My wife got this sports bra for light workouts and walks. So far, she says it is pretty comfortable,<br />albeit a little small. She usually gets a large, but with this one, she felt she could have gone up a<br />size. She said that she does like the feel of the material, and nothing is scratchy or poking her<br />anywhere, so that’s good. And, as far as support, she said that it is not as supportive as some of<br />her other sports bras, but it does offer enough for what she’s using it for. Overall, four stars"
4.0,Don’t buy if you weigh more than 170lbs.
4.0,"Soz out little man wore these with pride and joy. Sometimes when you see a child with shoes on you try to ignore how the laces are tied or rather untied. Well, with these you never have to worry about tying them ever. They're are almost slip ons. These are patented leather look and shines nicely. No scuffs and does not mark easily."
4.0,"It's a beautiful dress; however, it was a bit tight based on the fitting dimensions.  I ended up returning it but may buy it again in a larger size."
4.0,"I needed a white mask but sadly it's already sold out, so I purchased a checkered mask. The colors look solid, it fits very well on my large head. The only issue here is that in the picture, the mask would cover the entire area of the neck, but mine covers only half of it. Like, people can see my neck skin while I'm wearing this mask."
4.0,Fit me a little big. I am 5'3 and 160 pounds and I ordered a large. Over all this is a cute top and a good buy for the price. Will look cute with leggings.
4.0,they serve their purpose :)
4.0,My son really likes it. And the price is cheaper compared to the other stores.
4.0,"These are very well made. So well made in fact that they are not good for warm weather. They're quite thick, so I use them for cooler temperatures. I am very happy with the quality and design."
4.0,The Calf Compression Sleeves are very good.  I liked that you could order in prints and love the ones I chose.  Fit Well and haved used them and happy with the results. Very good quality especially for the price!
4.0,"Worn by a person who wears 9 1/2 6E men's shoe, and 5ft 8in tall. Sock is men's L/XL Wide Calf Washed two times in FL machine with soap nuts and baking soda in cold water, line dried. Might have shrunk a little, but go easily up to the knee. Not as silky as before washing , but looks fine. Loose in the toe area and a little long which is what was wanted so as not to compress toenails. Provides light compression on the calf of the leg, not as much in the ankle area. Probably will not handle as much wear as an athletic compression sock would. Looks more like a dress sock. Not as thin as hose. Bought two more pairs in the double pack , but have not tried them yet."
4.0,"It worked well and did not damage fabric. It was very heavy though, so on lighter fabric tends to flip over if not positioned exactly. And it did not stretch at all."
4.0,"They roll down a bit and stretch after the first few minutes. Tip from experience: Don't wear them too high, just above the knee or they end up stretching out /causing thigh muffins."
4.0,Good product but smaller than expected
4.0,Nice mom's love it
4.0,Super sexy! love it!
4.0,"This is a great and supportive bra. It provides compression without flattening you out. However, if you are larger than a C/D cup (which is what I am) I think the amount of 'overflow' would make the bra less supportive."
4.0,"What a nice shirt.  I love the bright red color, the fabric is very comfortable (it breathes), and the sizing is a bit generous without being too big.  It washed without running or fading (pretty uncommon for a red cotton shirt), and didn't shrink noticeably in the dryer. It didn't look very ribbed, but rather smooth. Maybe they're really small ribs.<br /><br />I have nothing bad to say about this shirt, and either you like the style or you don't.  I think it's well worth a try."
4.0,Good when working at hospital with infection control.
4.0,Runs very large!
4.0,"It's a cute swing dress! I got the deep red color and it is true to the picture. It's not see-through, but the material is very stretchy, so beware of bra lines showing through. I usually wear Medium in everything, but because of the fabric and the fact that it's a swing dress, I went down to a small and it was great! Wear a belt if you want a tighter waist."
4.0,Just as advertised. Very comfy.
4.0,Very well made good quality. But it’s just a dress not a bathing suit
4.0,"You get what you pay for, they wear out after a month or two, but I brought a few pairs they fit great and love em"
4.0,Housing was very loose on the Blaze. Was able to tighten the housing to retain the Blaze with some work.
4.0,"Very cute, nice material, quick delivery. Only problem is the bottoms are kind of lower than what I expected.  My butts not that big but this barely covers my crack. Cute suit otherwise."
4.0,"Love the item it's very nice. Item too small. I ordered based on the size chart and what size I usually wear. To be safe, I would order one to two sizes bigger than you normally wear. I am very disappointed because this should have fit me."
4.0,Love the fit wish the ear piece was a little more curved
4.0,Had to get links taken out. Overall really good product. Can dress it up or down.
4.0,Thank you😊👍
4.0,"They fit just fine and were comfortable but would not stay on my head overnight. I am a rough sleeper, though. I am concerned that they will lose elasticity over time."
4.0,I have really thick hair and always have trouble finding a hat to fit. This hat fits my hair up in it no problem. And it's both cute and warm.
4.0,"I wanted these Dude dupes to work so badly, but they’re too big.  They either be my new house shoes or my child will steal them from me.  They’re awesome aside from the sizing."
4.0,"This manbag has a design that is quite common among many manufacturers, including Tumi to name just one. The main difference among the bags is the workmanship, specifically, the leather. That's where discerning gentleman place most of their value.<br /><br />I bought the distressed top grain leather. I prefer full grain boot leather for a bag, but the top grain on this particular bag is good. I took away a star because it's not full grain. I have grown to be quite picky about my bags. (For comparison, Saddleback makes full grain leather bags.)<br /><br />Note that I returned this Claire Chase bag, but still give it a solid 4 stars. I was in the market for my 5-star bag, not just a good bag. I happened to find my 5-star bag on eBay that has the full grain boot leather I prefer. However, it's all personal preference. Full grain boot leather is too heavy and unwieldy for many people.<br /><br />The texture and color of this Claire Chase bag feel and look naturally worn, but I can still tell it's brand new because it's clean. For leather lovers like me, you like your leather to look worn, whether you do it through use or whether you buy it like that. This bag should look even better as the user breaks it in, but I'm not sure. Perhaps brand new is the best the bag will look.<br /><br />Note that high quality leather looks better with use, while cheap leather looks worse with use. I own a cheap bag from Wilson's Leather. It has a similar design to this bag, but the grain is something cheaper than top grain. I now appreciate the difference between cheap leather and higher quality leather. I understand why my cheap bag costs 5 times less than this Claire Chase bag. I have replaced the cheap bag about 5 times with the same style. The leather and hardware kept wearing out such that the bag was not up to my standards. It only took about a year each time.<br /><br />The hardware is quite nice. It looks like the hardware is brass, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the hardware doesn't have a paint job that will start peeling away and looking old. In contrast, the hardware on the Tumi bag of this design peels after awhile. That's not acceptable to me. Given how expensive Tumi bags are, that should not happen.<br /><br />My particular bag came with stitching that is a light tan color, much lighter than the color of the leather. So, it's easy to see the stitching. This makes the bag look more finished, and it was a pleasant surprise."
4.0,Very attractive. Much compliments. The gold pattern is painted on some came off on the first wear.  Still happy with this purchase
4.0,"This top was more sheer than I expected, wouldn't where to work. Fit was also on the smaller side, even though there is alot of stretch and give, I would suggest sizing up on this one if you're top heavy."
4.0,Love like photo
4.0,Just needed a New Washington R hat..
4.0,Not super impressed nor are they my new favorites but they are pretty cool
4.0,My only problem is. with the small chain connecting the clasps.  If fell apart immediately and was lost.  I've<br />been wearing the bracelet without it. Hope it doesn't fall off..
4.0,"Good quality socks. Would definitely need thinner socks for summer, but good think socks."
4.0,The top was very large on me and the bottoms were small and cheeky! I didn't realize they were the cheeky bottoms and I didn't feel comfortable in them.
4.0,"WIcked fun product. Had some trouble with accidentally turning it on/off, but it's not a huge deal."
4.0,It is more reddish color than pink.  Comfy dress but it is like one size smaller
4.0,"The hat is nice quality, very soft and looks nice as well. The face shield itself is okay. It is a soft plastic sheet that slides over the brim of the hat that needs to be tied in a knot in the back. The shield can be removed which is nice if you don't want to be looking through that when you're far enough from others in the current world situation."
4.0,"Beautiful but had to send it back,could not get anyone to help with the links."
4.0,"Pretty as expected, quality lace trim and fabric. Sleeves longer than expected."
4.0,This is a watch with a sleek look for the active man.
4.0,"These running shoes make me feel like I am running barefoot on the clouds! More than I expected out of such inexpensive shoes. I have had these shoes for well over a month now and have worn them to walk, run and even skip (when I am feeling not so old). They have a sturdy foam sole. They have a nice woven look to the insole and it is very very comfortable and allows my feet to breathe. I am so impressed with the build of these shoes, and again, the price is what threw me off. I was expecting, for the $12.99 that I paid, to have these things fall off of my feet a few minutes into running. But they are made excellently and with care. I am very pleased!"
4.0,looks great. well worth the price.  leather is strong.  looks way more expensive than it is.
4.0,"I just received and tried it on. Honestly for $23 I wasn't expecting much but I was surprised at the quality. It is lined and the seams are all sewn well. I am 5'3 122 and ordered a small. I am short waisted and it fit perfect, it holds me in and is flattering. Even if it only lasts me this summer for $23 dollars I am fine with that. I was going to order a similar style from BodyGlove for $100 so this is a deal. I just ordered the striped one as well, I hope it is of the same quality."
4.0,The material was very sheer and the purple was not neon at all but rather more violet than electric purple.
4.0,"Love this cardigan, cozy and seems to be made well!<br />Just don’t put it in the dryer mine shrank a little<br />Bit"
4.0,"Very pretty dress, very long"
4.0,Perfect size for purse. I did have one seam come undone at the bottom though.
4.0,"The sweater lining is just decorative, does not run through entire jacket. Otherwise it's a nice jacket, it'll do the trick."
4.0,"These are great board shorts. Lightweight, velcro beneath the shoestring tie. They do run  small. I ordered a size 6 but usually wear a 4, and I'll be kind of squeezing into these. If I had the time to run around returning stuff I'd return these for an 8 but since I don't I will be wearing these on my thin days."
4.0,very nice for price and design. lenses get smudged easily and are kinda hard to clean so buy so eye wear wipes.
4.0,Dislike - size was to small
4.0,"Simple, cheap and effective.  Harder plastic tag than you're probably thinking."
4.0,Sits very high. Makes you look heavy in the hips if you have curves
4.0,"I like the material, so easy to take care of.  The length is pretty good.  I like my tops longer, so it works for me.  I like the fact that it slims your tummy look, also.  Shipping time was good and I've had no issues with it.  I will buy a few more in different colors."
4.0,"This bra is cute and soft. I made the mistake of following the advice of the company and sized up for a more ""comfy fit."" I hate when sports bras are too tight/restricting. But unfortunately the comfy fit is just a tad too loose. I'm not sure I could wear it for intense exercise but maybe for walking or something that required less support. Unfortunately, the pads in my bra came creased, which shows through my shirt. I washed and hung dry it to see if it smoothed out the pads and it worked for the most part but there are still some creases. The pads are circular in shape, I generally prefer the curved triangular pads in sports bras. It is thick enough that I think you could wear it without the pads but I haven't tried that yet. For reference, I wear a 36/38 C and got the XL but think I could have gone with the L."
4.0,It is a cute dress.  A perfect piece for your summer wardrobe.
4.0,Looks good on me compliments galore
4.0,Little big for my 21 months old.
4.0,Very beautiful Stone Earrings than expected. They are very much thinner than appeared in the listing. Workmanship appear to be good quality. Not the statement earrings I had expected due to size.
4.0,Super cute but is very tight
4.0,The dress looked beautiful in person and fit well just wish it was a bit longer.
4.0,"love these for my tile floors, the only thing is I would remove the tassels, they kept coming untied and tangled even tripping me, cut them off right away"
4.0,Sooooooo cute and dainty ! My kind of jewelry! So many compliments within a day of wearing it . Just wish it was a little shorter and you will need to buy a weight for the back clasp. All in all I love it though😍
4.0,Perfect for coverup
4.0,"This top is cute and something different. Can be worn with jeans or dress up. It is a much thinner material than I expecteded so most likely best to handwash it, also since it has lace."
4.0,The women's size 9 fit a size 8.<br /> That is as big as they go.
4.0,"I bought this dress on a last minute whim in the spring for an event.  I could envision the look I wanted but everything was so overpriced. I randomly searched Amazon (never bought clothing here) & found this. I was so worried that it would be I'll fitting or would malfunction during my event.<br />But ON THE CONTRARY, this dress was amazing.  No one believed me when I said how much  (read: little) I spent.  It was a major hit!  It had plenty of stretch without looking cheap. It endured a dinner & lots of dancing and still has miles to go. I was never once uncomfortable!  Go for it!"
4.0,I did this and lost my keys. I should have kelped my keys on the lanyard I had before.
4.0,"It's very sturdy with a thicker metal.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that mine was a little more tarnished than it appeared in the photo.  Even though it is labeled as antique, I expected the metal to not be so dull looking."
4.0,"This dress is adorable. The cut is flattering and the fabric is comfy. My only issue is it runs slightly too small. I’m an xl but my bust is a small c cup and the top is a bit too tight. So, if you have a large bust you will definitely need to go up a size or two."
4.0,size 10-13 to small for my size 9 /pulled small & big toe in
4.0,had to send it back cuz i got another i liked but this is still good
4.0,Gave a family heirloom watch to my son and wanted a display case for it.  Didn't want to stress the bow so wanted one where the watch sat instead of being hung.  I read the other reviews about the stand not being attached to the base and decided that could be fixed....I simply glued it in place.  It's perfect.
4.0,"Nice quality, a bit snug, depends on size of your head but overall I reccomend"
4.0,Perfect for the muffin top!
4.0,"I don't know how long these flip up shades will last, but they work well for the present. The center part seems to be all metal so I don't think it will break very soon. They fit nicely over my regular glasses and are fairly easy to put on, take off and flip up. Of course how they fit depends on the size of your glasses, but the measurements given for these on Amazon seem to be accurate.<br /><br />One other thing; these shades are fairly dark so if you're looking for lightly tinted ones, you might want to look elsewhere."
4.0,I love my boots they were exactly what i wanted the fit is perfect and i am extremely happy
4.0,"NOTE: WILL BLOCK HEART MONITORS ON NEW SMART WATCHES, the band slips under the little bars of the watch that would normally hold the two separate pieces of a normal band.  This band loops all the way around your wrist as one piece and the watch basically sits on top of the band.<br /><br />And comfortable :) which is important!  I bought this to replace the stock band on a Citizen watch, because I use the computer most of the day, and most watch buckles (for those of us who wear our watches face up on the back of the wrist) are RIGHT in the way, over tendons and tender areas while typing.  This band allows me to slide the buckle over to the side, and still have the watch where I would expect it to be, and just have a flat band on the bottom of my wrist, which is FAR more comfortable and practical.  The nylon is durable, but will need to be cleaned thoroughly about twice a year off of the watch (or more frequently if you sweat a lot).<br /><br />UPDATE:  Many years later and this strap is still in GREAT condition (2022!!! that's 11 years, more than half that was daily use until I started wearing smart watches, but I still have it, and it's still solid!!), but the cleaning comment I made above, do yourself a favor and up the frequency.  The most common two holes I use for my wrist size are a bit ragged from nearly daily use, but the strength and integrity of the strap and buckle are completely intact.  Highly recommended!!"
4.0,"Super snug.  But, colors are lovely."
4.0,Very cute design with soft fabric.
4.0,"My septum piercing is headed towards the end of the healing process but I've been going through some medical stuff and wasn't allowed to wear my metal jewelry. (If you're going through the same, ask your doctor if these would be okay! I'm not a medical professional.) These have been working fine but they can hurt a bit when removing them. I also needed my partner's help to screw the ends on."
4.0,"Great pair, they look expensive too!"
4.0,"My daughter received this shirt as a Christmas present and just loves it. She loves all things ""Pusheen"" but she also says that the shirt is very comfortable and it looks great on her. She has already worn it several times and it has been washed  that many times as well and so far, has held up well. The color of the shirt...not really black and more of an odd shade of gray is the only thing keeping this rating from being a full 5 stars."
4.0,I really have nothing to say
4.0,I always expect these items to run small.
4.0,Nice shoe. Just did not like the seem across the foot. I will recommend these shoes.
4.0,The sunglasses were a bit more fragile looking but otherwise they are good.
4.0,my husband had shoulder surgery and this shirt is easy to deal with.
4.0,"This is a good quality shirt, just a little thin for what I was expecting."
4.0,"Well made, just what I wanted.  Need a plastic ID window on the back ... then it would be perfect."
4.0,I like this product but it’s cut smaller than size and the color looks lighter than the picture.
4.0,Loose.
4.0,Im about 130lbs and I ordered a small.  the fit was perfect.
4.0,Bought it for a friend and she loved it.
4.0,Nice Boe tie worth the money
4.0,I like it and swim in it all the time.
4.0,Bought these for my daughter and she loves them!!! Very comfy!
4.0,"Toes rub against material, and I wear a 7 1/2 shoe—ouch!"
4.0,Works great but doesn't fit as much as I would like.
4.0,Very nice for a great price.  Fit a large wrist!  And it's my son's favorite color!
4.0,Needed a quick cheap watch to replace my 40 yr old Timex.  This does it.  If the band and face were a little larger I would have given it 5 Stars
4.0,"It is a really cute dress, just a bit big. My daughter is average height and it reached the floor on her. If you have a short child and don't know how to hem lace, I would double think this or get a smaller size."
4.0,Thin but well made. Doesn't change fit or quality in the wash.
4.0,Stylish and great sun protection
4.0,"After many months of suffering from rashes on my wrists from the Garmin band, this completely solved the problem. It is very comfortable and not a single rash since changing bands. I love the blue color. My one complaint is that the color is wearing off, as other reviewers have noted. That is a small problem in comparison to the terrible rashes I was getting from the original band, but I hope the company addresses this problem."
4.0,"This worked out great for a week at camp and my daughter loved the design. It does tip over and I think four wheels/spinning would be better for airport travel, but it's a great short trip/overnight bag."
4.0,Bought these to wear with some slide on shoes I have. They work perfect. My only complain is one pair came a little damaged that’s why I took one star off. Other than that they are perfect and don’t slide down off my head which is a major plus.
4.0,"There is a flap that does not stay snapped shut, and flies around which drives me nuts. I'll just have to figure a different way to keep it closed.Otherwise, it's great."
4.0,"I bought these as a gift for a coworker that really enjoys her essential oils. They were a great deal! She really enjoys them, (especially the multi-colored one) and they do hold the essential oil scent for at least a day, especially if you are using a stronger oil, like eucalyptus or tea tree.<br />I knocked down a star because one of them broke after a few weeks of use and I think it should have held up longer but the other two are still going strong."
4.0,Bought them for an accessory for my daughters 90s outfit for dance. The sunglasses were exactly what I expected except the flip up part was a little loose but still workable.
4.0,love the gown!
4.0,looks just like to photo. soft fabric. just wish it was a little more true to size. little snug for a large
4.0,Kind of a little cheap made but for the price and they matched some shoes perfectly.  I kept them.
4.0,"look just like they should, not too thin, fot perfectly for my 7 1/2 size foot"
4.0,"I recommend this &#34;eye glasses&#34; it fits well my son face shape . . ?!, and sits comfortably on his nose, thank you amazon"
4.0,"Comfy.  A bit small, but then it IS a travel pillow."
4.0,Nice dress for a casual outing
4.0,nice material...I love the casual comfort of this t-shirt
4.0,"I like the look of it, but it slides around on my wrist, so I don't get consistent SPO2 readings at night. This didn't happen with the silicone wrist band which doesn't slide around. There are leather strips on the inside of the band so perhaps this will improve over time as it gets worn in."
4.0,These gloves are extremely hard to get into with wet hands because of the soft inner cloth. They are extremely warm and completely waterproof.
4.0,great paper mask. stinks a little
4.0,"There are two pair in the order. There work great for keeping your pants tucked in your boots. I suggest clipping them on your pants before putting your pants on. The only issue I have with the plant stays is that you have to place them just right or the clip can end up on you ankle or a place that becomes uncomfortable, but that can happen with any brand you order."
4.0,"Beatifull and a for the money you can ask for much, but be aware: all plastic and it feel really cheap and gets scratchy really easy!.<br />Ill invest the extra $15 and get the metal one."
4.0,The perfect everyday bra. It holds the girls in place very nicely and the underwires don't dig too hard into the skin leaving those ugly cup marks on your chest. They arrived on time and all of them were intact. I would buy these again.
4.0,Dress is for an upcoming wedding and the color and style are perfect for the occasion.
4.0,"Super nice quality! I ordered both styles. The higher waist in the medium fit perfectly,  however the lower waist version was quite large (and the same size). Unfortunately they do not carry the low waist blue ones in small"
4.0,"I purchased these sunglasses as a present for my grandfather. When I purchased them, they were on a lightning deal, which made them an amazing price! The discounted price did not take away from the quality of the sunglasses, however. These shades seem sturdy, which makes them perfect for a variety of conditions. Despite being sturdy, however, the sunglasses are still light enough to carry around without an added hassle. My grandfather loved the style as did my brother, which shows how versatile the style is. One of my favorite parts about this purchase was the case that the shades come in. The sunglasses came in a really nice Nautica case, which is perfect for preventing scratches or breaking. These are the perfect sunglasses for any man in your life, whether it be your dad, your brother, your grandfather, or even you (if you're a man)."
4.0,This watchband was easy to put on my TicWatch E. It's a nice color. Was kind of stiff and scratched the wrist initially but softened within days. Not for large wrists.
4.0,I previously read a review saying that the pants fit smaller then the measurements so I sized up and it fit perfectly. My measurements were fit for a 4x but got a 5x. Keep in mind I was looking for a looser fit too just to be cozy.
4.0,Muy buen producto llego en muy buen estado y en corto tiempo
4.0,"They look really cool. Good quality. Personally, I didn't notice a difference in my health."
4.0,"I've been gifting my special girl with clothing and had to deviate towards something new. Being a petite 5'1"" & slightly short-waisted, palazzo pants are a fashion risk. The open legs and fit were great for her and they fit to a tee and breezy for summer. Bought a Large. She loved them so much she was outfitted with both colors. Wish they made more.<br />For taller women, the hem may ride higher up the ankle, but would still look good."
4.0,The bracelet part feels like foam and the jewels are glued on that. So far it's lasted well but it's only about 1.5 months old so we'll see. I love that it's not bulky but still has the layers of sparkly gems. I also love the 2 tone gems and the different sizes. It looks good and is easy to snap on. I can't think of any cons other than I had to wait a long time to get it but I really didn't mind that either.
4.0,I like these sNdaks. But would like fewer straps.
4.0,Not what I ordered but still nice.
4.0,"Well made classic style white linen pants fit as expected and modestly priced.  The fabric is thin, however, so care must be taken with the choice of what to wear under them."
4.0,"Love the pants, they were a little large on me. I ordered a medium and they fit like a large. Just order a size down unless you like a little baggy without tying them."
4.0,"Right out of the bag I held them up to my waist and said ""oh h*** no - these won't go on. They're going back."" A few hours later I thought ""well what the heck.. I should at least try them on."" They're definitely tighter than my normal base layer pants I wear as leggings. They also don't dig into my mom gut and show where my underwear is so gracefully sitting where it doesn't belong. It's weird how they seem to defy physics. Didn't think I could stuff myself into pants like these and not have a monstrous muffin top, but here I am with barely a roll peeking over. Bonus - I have a pocket for my wallet, phone, keys, lip balm, and a small knife and lighter in the waistband. Jussayin'... kinda neat. FYI IT'S ONE LONG POCKET WITH SMALL DIVIDERS/STITCHING AT THE TOP ..Just in case anyone else also thought there were 5 separate compartments.<br /><br />I think I'm still going to size up though just to be very comfortable."
4.0,I expected it to be a little looser
4.0,"These were ordered for an upcoming two-week cruise. We ordered two sets--one in a neon green for my boyfriend, and the pink for me. I thought they were a bit flimsy--I was expected something more &#34;rigid&#34;.  However, for the price point, these are not bad.  They are extremely roomy, and with careful packing, you should be able to fit in a lot of clothing and items. Having said that, it might be a good idea to weigh your bag after you pack it to avoid paying extra to check them in at the airport. The smallest of the suitcase would work as a carry-on. It's still a few months away before the trip, so we still haven't had a chance to test them &#34;on the road&#34;, sort of speak.  The suitcases, overall, are exactly as described on the Amazon listing, so make sure you read the details carefully to determine if these suitcases will work for your particular needs.  There are a lot of color choices, and Merax also makes different styles of luggage. Be careful when ordering that you order the right items."
4.0,"I bought this sweater as a cover-up for work, post-workout, and for lounging around the house. It's very comfortable and soft, unlike a previous Patty Boutik marled sweater I'd bought that turned out to be too itchy. It also fits nicely over a 7-month baby belly. Definitely a keeper."
4.0,"These are great for work. They do shrink a bit but you can stretch them out when they are still wet. COVID had me washing daily so I wore them out and reordered new ones. Great for layering, hiding some weight (darker colors) and hood makes a comfortable collar and youthful look. Order one size up to keep them longer- and you will want to keep them longer!"
4.0,It's good for the price but materials thin and clings. This is not flowing like the image. I'm 5'8&#34; and medium build and it look like a normal cardigan from Lands End.
4.0,"Love these!!!! Super light weight and color is amazing.  The buttons on the straps were  sewed on weird so had to cut them and off and sew them back on in a better placement, but other then that plants are great. Could have even gotten a size smaller if wanted but I love the bagginess."
4.0,Love this bracelet.  It's best for evening or special wear - just my opinion.  Provides the shine that draws attention - better than the helemite.
4.0,"beautiful, quality as expected for the price, Would have liked to purchase a fancier one for my sons first rosary but there is plenty of time for that as he was just born!"
4.0,"It's not as structured as I thought. This dress is thin. I need to wear a slip under it. I'm 5'3 and size small and it's quite short in the back. Despite these issues, it's a really cute dress. Would work with tights and booties for winter"
4.0,"Product is as described, and functions flawlessly.<br />The only reason i am giving 4 stars instead of 5, is because i wish the date would display."
4.0,"I ordered these looking for soft pants to wear around the house, but these are too nice for that! The material is beautiful and silky and very well made. The waist scarf is a nice addition and can be worn as a thin neck scarf. To me, they pair well with several of my dressier blouses or a nice sweater. The only negative is the waist elastic is a much tighter fit than I expected, but it is not sewn in but in a casing so I am going to work on that. Overall very nice pants."
4.0,Cheap sunglasses that have ok polarization properties. As stated in the packaging the properties may or may not work for everyone. Worked ok for me but not at all for my wife. They do fit over my regular glasses though.
4.0,"As described, Ratcheting works fine, one negative is the buckle mechanism is a bit large and heavy"
4.0,I had hoped the legs would be more tapered but it fits nicely.
4.0,Nice but too bulky for me. I will give to my son. Received quickly. Packaged nicely. Nice display & modes. Rubber band.
4.0,Nide
4.0,"Love the bag.  It's a little bigger than I expected, but will fit my needs."
4.0,look just as pictured but a little smaller as expected in length.  width is good... had to deduct a star because of the length.. unless my feet have grown since yesterday
4.0,"Hats were what I expected material wise, but someone said they were perfect for preschoolers. Too big for my preschoolers. They could be used by an adult with a small head."
4.0,"thin material, very very pretty, I feel like I have to be careful opening and closing.  Probably not the best long term use, but I bought it for photo shoots so it works for what I need"
4.0,"I purchased this dress last minute for a funeral. Unfortunately, it arrived a bit too large even though I followed the size chart. The chest and bust wasn't fitted and instead looked loose and baggy. But, I did really like the look, quality and modesty of the dress - plus I didn't have time to get another. I decided to shrink it in the dryer instead, which worked. I've worn the dress a few times since then and I still like it. The embroidery has held up well to washing and drying. I always receive a ton of compliments on the dress."
4.0,worked fine on my long bike trips a little big for my shoes but did ok
4.0,"Fits the description perfectly. What else can I say, it's a scarf with skulls on it. You should buy this if that is what you are looking for,"
4.0,"This shirt is big on me, but past buying experiences on Amazon has left me leary of buying mediums. It's a nice shirt. Nothing really remarkable to note. Fabric is your average jersey material. It is of good weight,  not thin."
4.0,"Soft and very comfortable. Fit was sloppy on me. Wanted to love it, but had to return."
4.0,Nice little bag. Fits enough for a day hike. I like that you can switch the strap for either shoulder.
4.0,An awesome pair on sunglasses for only $10. The top part above where it sits on your nose is a bit weird though.
4.0,The face is larger than  I expected but you can read it.
4.0,"Awesome for the price! No issues what so ever, they mold great and look suitable for there quality. The top was slightly unfitting but some denture glue should do the trick. Hope this helps some. Keep up the great products Top Class Jewels."
4.0,"Since I am quite short, the tunic style is almost at dress length.  I will probably shorten this shirt before i wear it"
4.0,"I really like this watch.  I have a large wrist and it fits very comfortably without pinching, and I am not forced to use the last hole on the band!  My only wish, which I was aware of before I ordered it, is that the display color could be changed or came in a color other than red."
4.0,Runs a little small but great otherwise
4.0,Great Glasses that filter the sun very well.  Happy with the UV400 rating.  A little larger for my over glasses fit would be better.  Seem to be very sturdy as well.
4.0,"The belt is a bit loose.  It is sewn on at the side seams, so I will need to adjust it to give it the neat appearance shown on the model.  It should be an easy fix."
4.0,"Very comfortable, have purchased this style in multiple colors !"
4.0,"Ok so it was what like 10 bucks?? Girls...you pay for what you get! Obviously material is cheap..<br />Straps are not adjustable HOWEVER it fits nicely and flatters in the right places. I am 5'4 and 127lbs. I got a medium. It's a little camel toe ish but not bad. It is low cut! Even for me, and I like my boobs. I can say that nowI've had a reduction. Lol. Hope this feedback helps some!"
4.0,Comfy and pretty. Liked night gown
4.0,Love this size! I do wish the string were longer though. Definitely would buy again!
4.0,Should have got a bigger size. But they're cute.
4.0,"Believe it or not, I would have given this top 5 stars but I could not for 2 reasons. 1, the size chart is not accurate which is more a seller issue. I ordered an XXL based off the us size chart that was offered. I should have ordered my normal XL and it would have still been roomy like I prefer. The second issue is the elastic. When something is off shoulder the elastic needs to be good quality to keep it securely in place, this is very loose elastic and over time I am sure it will not hold up. Now for the good points. I am keeping it but will alter it for my needs as I am leaving for vacation. The fabric is super soft against the skin, almost like silk which I love. The color is just like the photo and the design is very pretty. The lace on the sleeves is also pretty and feminine as is the entire top. I would recommend this top but order your normal size and do not dry it due to that elastic wearing thinner."
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress. Being someone who is 250lbs with a 42DD bra dize, you can imagine its really hard to find anything in my size at all, let alone vintage dresses that are made for skinny people.<br /><br />The material is thick and durable, nothing was out of place when I got it, and the dress came down to my shins/knees which is exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />The only issue that I have with it (which is something I expected) was that the arm holes were a little too small and the zipper is a little tough. It's not something that was painful to deal with, but the arm holes were just slightly digging into my arms.<br /><br />Please note that in the photo, I am wearing a petticoat."
4.0,Little short but good fit.
4.0,Cute but the purple from the handband doesn't really match the rest of the outfit. Kinda looks old. I didn't use the headband
4.0,Met expectations.  Added UT logo.
4.0,"Comfortable band for fitbit that I wear everyday.  Love the leather color, will be ordering another one of a different color. Good value for the price"
4.0,"It is way shorter than it is pictured, but I like it."
4.0,Very comfortable and hold up after several washes. I have bought several for work. Occasionally I will get one with a defect but the seller always makes it right.
4.0,"Ordered an adult medium for my son who wears adult small -- this hoodie runs Small! -- after washing, it is hardly bigger than a Gildan size small hoodie he has.  Just purchased a medium Champion brand from sports store -- Great fit on that one!!"
4.0,"Nice bag, looks more expensive than I was thinking it would for the price. I purchased the brown/saddle color, which is a reddish brown. It's pretty large, but that's the way I like my purses. The accompanying interior bag (comes detached) is pretty large too, not suited for my purposes. It has no handles, which is too bad. If it did, I would use it for essentials & leave purse home when certain events called for a smaller bag. So, because I'm only using purse, I wish it had a few interior pockets. Probably won't be my everyday bag, but it will be ok for a change of pace."
4.0,i am pleased with  mask  it  but does not fit as tightly as i would like
4.0,It fit. I didn't expect it to be so form fitting. I am sure I will enjoy my dress!
4.0,Nice and light. Good quality but took too long to arrive.
4.0,Product was good shipping to awhile
4.0,"Want to say, it is a beautiful piece with glass and wood beads. Half cent piece is not real and comes with no authentic papers. The reason I like it is I use oils and the wood beads are absorbent and works great as a scent bracelet."
4.0,Size ran small but its a nice bathing suit! Unfortunately i must return..
4.0,a little small in the wrist strap...will have to replace the strap
4.0,Comfortable bikers shorts. Nothing special but a great classic to have readily available for workouts.
4.0,"Very small...not for average adult wrist, maybe young teen.  Great customer service!  I'll save this for a gift as it is pretty, just not my size."
4.0,Bought it as a gift person I got it for likes it a lot!
4.0,Mother's day gift
4.0,nice band for the money
4.0,"Sweatshirt was nice, just like the picture, but runs small. Ordered an xlarge fit like a large."
4.0,Definitely order one size larger. My teenager loves it. Who knows how long it will wear?
4.0,"Good material, a little thin though and the soles are thin and narrow. My son wears a size a 6, I ordered a 6.5 just to be safe and glad I did they run small the half size up is almost too small for him<br /><br />I received this at a discount for my honest opinion hopefully it will help you"
4.0,Big and comfortable. Just hope they last.
4.0,Item the same as they offer. great for that!!
4.0,"These fit well and are super cute, but one of the lenses came with a few scratches on it. Not the end of the world, but if I buy something I expect it to come in new condition. Won't exchange out of hassle."
4.0,"This is very small and the material has no stretch whatsoever. I had hoped it would just be a little too small but it was at least 5 sizes too small for me. I gave it to an 11 year old who wears a double zero in jeans and it fit her fine, it was just a little bit short. She loved the bright neon pink color. It is lined and the inside is like a white mesh. The outside fabric is has no stretch or give to it at all. It is spaghetti strapped and it had a cute little design tied into the back at the top. It looked almost like macrame. It was made into the racerback design of the dress. I wish it had fit but unfortunately it did not and there is no size large enough to fit me. They are definitely Asian sizes and on the much smaller end of the size spectrum. I removed on star for the size chart being posted nowhere before I ordered.<br />I received a discount on this dress in exchange for my honest opinion and review of the product. I hope you have found my review helpful. Thank you!"
4.0,"Cute eyeglass holder.  Would prefer if it were a little longer, but it is o.k."
4.0,Really comfortable shorts. Great material light wait. Sizes run a little big but overall a good product at a great price
4.0,I will be using this as a nightgown because the high waistline lands midway of my breast instead of just underneath my breast. It’s loose fit so the size Isn’t the issue. It’s just an odd fit for my body and being plus size it looks like a maternity dress. I carry my weight in my abdomen though so this cut accentuates my problem area. The fabric is a nice quality and very soft. I often wear other items from the same company and enjoy the pieces. This one just isn’t for me. I wouldn’t recommend to larger chested ladies.
4.0,I really liked this top. For perfectly and nice material.
4.0,Item as described I just wish they were a little longer like on pictures. Still I like them and use them.
4.0,"This cute sweater by Ymoshoe is great. It is a soft gray (called apricot) color. The sleeves are short and accented by ruffles. Very feminine and flattering. The crew neck and cable design (on the front) all complement each other. The nylon/polyester/viscose blend fabric is soft and doesn’t itch or irritate the skin. Overall, this is a cute top that you can wear with anything (i.e., jeans, skirts, or slacks)."
4.0,"I am 5'6, 155 lbs. I also wide hips but no front belly and a 36c bust.  The elastic band lies just under my breast and flows out over my hips.<br />I ordered several dresses like this and I love them!!!! For the price, you can't beat it!! But they run SUPER SMALL so I order an XXL and it fits perfect!<br />This one you'd have wear a.nude colored bra because material is a little thin!<br />Very cute dress!"
4.0,"Take a bit of getting use to.  Fabric itched preping for gym.  Once I began lifting they were great.  ""If you got it flaunt it""!"
4.0,I was looking for a comfortable dress to accessorize for an incoming trip. This one will work.
4.0,"Wickedly tight fit! I usually wear a medium, I bought an XL based on other reviews and they are perfect."
4.0,Great product worth the money ! keeps me warm
4.0,My only complaint is that it was folded when it was packaged and so that created a crease.
4.0,"Comfortable, a little loose but not to where it would fall off. This is NOT compatible with gear s2, additional adapter is needed in order to use the bands."
4.0,It’s so comfy and great quality for the price! I’m 5’7 and 137lbs I wasn’t blessed with big boobs so I went with a small and it fits great!
4.0,"Good pants but they skimped on belt loops making them only good.  7 belt loops instead of 5 and they'd be great pants.  Light, cool, hold shape all day.  Funky checkered pocket interior fabric is nice.  Me, 6' 175.  Size 34/32 fits perfectly."
4.0,I love the necklace; I just didn't expect the pendant to be so small
4.0,"great for the price! My only issue is that I wish the nose pedals would be a bit less malleable. I have slightly crooked ears so the nose pedals warp very quickly and make the glasses super crooked on me. However, I can bend them back. I get compliments on them whenever I wear them."
4.0,Fun shirt but runs small
4.0,"Great band, but.... It's impossible to adjust it. It only adjusts a little on the clasp but I had to get a dremel tool and go through some serious cutting and removing links to make it smaller."
4.0,They are cute can't wait to use them
4.0,"This would have been 5 stars but it ran a little big, just had it altered but for the price it’s great as my 6 year old’s flower girl dress. The color matches almost perfectly for my vintage ivory wedding dress"
4.0,"Top fits fine, but the bottom is way to small and I have a small bottom. Nice sexy look on the top tho"
4.0,I am 5'5&#34; 209 pounds I ordered the XL and it was perfect. .  I love the blouse with skirts and pants very nice material light weight and great for the summer and winter.  Great little top you can dress up and or dress in down.
4.0,"Love, love, love these glasses. They are fashionable and the vision is great for me. Would have given a perfect 5 star except for the glass cases. They included 5 cases that were all too small to fit the glasses! Would be perfect if the eye glass cases actually fit the glasses."
4.0,"I ordered the waterdrop, but got hearts instead. Luckily, I could still use them for my project, which is time-sensitive so I couldn't return them. They're adorable, worth the $, perfect for kids' crafts."
4.0,I have to say this is beautiful fabric. Really beautiful. Very soft light and silky and not at all in a cheap way. Quality. Very very nice quality. It’s true to size and will be gorgeous on somebody. I was saddened that I had to return mine because it simply didn’t look great on my frame and I knew I’d never wear it. Very very classy and beautiful dress though. Very high quality. Lovely light dusty sage green color. Fabric flies beautifully and the craftsmanship is spot on. The gathered pleats on the side of the bust of the bodice so the top comes across and down the chest are high end crafting. The waist sash is perfect length. Everything about this dress is a pleasant surprise in quality from the unexpected crap I’ve been getting online for the last year. Disappointed I couldn’t wear mine! Gorgeous and classy and quality dress
4.0,"The first shirt I purchased ran a size smaller than listed. When I put it on over my head, the collar ripped away from the rest of the shirt. I sent a message to the company and they replaced the shirt with another shirt one size larger. The new shirt fits and looks great. Customer service is an A+. I would give this product a 5 star rating, but the first shirt was too small and had to be replaced.<br />I will purchase from this company again."
4.0,Good quality but mouth piece is a little to wide.
4.0,"Overall I love this top. Very comfortable. I've found that I can only wash in the washer as putting it in the dryer makes it get little pulls on it. So long as I air dry it , it's great"
4.0,Flattering and just as expected. Would be more comfortable if it were a little looser in the chest but everything is held up and the rest falls where it should. Happy with this find!
4.0,"This was a really good product. I am short so I was expecting it to be really long but it doesn't drag which is nice. The only problem I have with it, is that the waist band was very large."
4.0,"These are great, I only reduced the rating bc my son managed to fall and break a pair and when I replaced them the size was slightly different.  Thankfully my optician had mercy and cut new lens without charging me full price, but as a fall back, buy a second pair at the same time as you buy the first.  Hopefully you won't need them but its worth it, especially compaired to the cost of frames at big name optical shops, your still going to save a bundle."
4.0,Nice snug fit and good looking style.
4.0,"The design of this kit is pretty good, but the build quality is just about what you'd expect for the price. Zippers are cheap and sticky, especially on corners, and there are stitching problems. Based on my frequency of travel (maybe 10-15 times a year) I give this kit a year before something breaks badly enough that I need to replace it. Which is fine for the price."
4.0,"If your man or you're a man that likes showing off a nice watch that's for you. It's an eye catcher and shiny. Also it's very good quality and comes in a nice box, .. i know,... who cares about the box!<br />Well, it matters when you give it as a gift!<br />And if you throw the Bulky box as soon as you get it, you still have a textile glove that will protect it from scratches in your drawer.<br />I got it for my husband, and he loves it!... He usually likes them thinner, (this one is a little bit bulkier than his usual liking) but this is not for every day, so it's ok!<br />Good Deal!"
4.0,"I'm 5'11"" tall and 147 lbs I ordered this dress in 2 colors: Black2 and Sleeveless purple. They both fit true to size the fabric on the top was different textures. On Black 2 it felt like a cotton blend but on Sleeveless purple it felt like polyester. So for me, Black2 was more comfy. In general, the polyester parts (I didn't check fabric content but it feels like poly to me) on both dresses feel like they may snag easily so that's a worry for me because my job is very active, I am very involved in planning and participation of events and activities with at work...that could snag my dress. It may be better for an office job or as a church dress. For the price, it's worth a shot, because the dress is affordable! I also really didn't like Sleeveless purple in person but on Black2 I thought it looked prettier in person. I already started the return process for sleeveless purple but plan to keep the dress I ordered in Black2. I am excited to wear this for work, especially in Summer because I live in a desert and it will be nice on a hot day, I think.  As for the length, if you're tall the length was decent. It didn't look too short. I think the length would be 100% perfect on someone 5'7"" to 5'8"" tall, but that's a guess."
4.0,"I liked this necklace.  My only complaint is that I thought it was going to be a choker and it wasn't. It's a long necklace, it's still nice and if you're looking for a choker you can get creative to make it that way."
4.0,"Fits as stated,  if machine washed then dried, my advice would be to get a one size larger just to make sure that it didn't shrink on you.  Yet it looks and feels good for those hot days and or the gym."
4.0,"Good fit, definitely euro cut (slim fit) for Americans.  I'm 5,9' and 150 lbs and the medium is perfect."
4.0,Nice case front just comes off
4.0,It's very nice and lightweight and fits my Fitbit Charge 3 perfectly just wish the band was a bit smaller.  I have a small wrist so the band is just a little too long.
4.0,"Sunglasses are well made, very comfortable when I’m using them for baseball."
4.0,My daughter loves them and wears them as much as she can
4.0,"This escalates any outfit I wear it with, I am a huge fan. Super comfortable, doesn't pinch anywhere, and really good quality for the amount I spent. The only reason this is getting 4/5 instead of 5/5 is just where it falls on my neck doesn't work with all necklines. It has to be a perfect crew neck (right where my neck ends) or a mid-chest scoop neck. Some of my more casual crew neck shirts fall just a little low for it (so the necklace is half on, half off the shirt) and I just don't think it looks as good."
4.0,"Does a good job, won't last long if doing any intense work but got a three pair at least."
4.0,"falls off my shoulders a good bit, but otherwise nice, flowy shawl."
4.0,"A very nice bag, but I consider it overpriced."
4.0,Great Christmas gifts
4.0,If you love the boho vibe this dress is for you. It’s so cute and springy. I did add a belt to the dress similar to the photo listed as it didn’t come with it.
4.0,"The earrings are cute. Unfortunately, they are tiny (the measurements, which I failed to read are accurate ). I relied on all the pictures. The picture of the pair are blown up in size dramatically and  also appear bigger on the girl wearing them. They are even smaller than pictured in the box. These would be appropriate for an infant, toddler or maybe a first grader and not for a very slim 8 year old!"
4.0,I like the soft leather and unusual style of the shoes.
4.0,"Absolutely adorable. This skirt is so cute and very flattering. The material isn’t anything too fancy, similar to fabric you’d use if this skirt was handmade. I got tons of compliments when I wore it to work. I usually wear mediums in bottoms but these felt a bit larger but I don’t think a small would’ve fit me well. Does not have pockets, which is disappointing."
4.0,"This is one of those things that once you realize how amazing it is, you never want to go back. Especially with everyone wearing loungewear around more during the pandemic, but still needing to be connected to work, etc with your phone close at hand, these are great! Comfortable and allow for super easy access. Once you have this feature, you will not want to wear your old yoga pants/capris around the house any more.<br />One thing to note is that the pockets are in the direction of normal pants rather than most similar products. My phone has stayed in so far but because of the direction, I could see it more likely to slip out in the future. Also, I don't really think the breathable bottom part of the leg really benefits the capris at all. It honestly just feels a bit weird and that's not where the most heat and sweat usually is."
4.0,"I bought it in white, and I thought it was going to be see-through. It wasn’t!"
4.0,"Very lightweight and well made. I use it as a tote for work (it's BIG). Unfortunately, I didn't think to look for interior pockets before ordering. It becomes a black hole very quickly, even with a smaller bag added within."
4.0,"somewhat tight around the arms, but it is very flattering."
4.0,Love this dress! The buttons got loose after putting it in the wash but it was an easy fix! The material is also very good as well! Love the lilac color and how flattering it looks on!
4.0,"I love these, I've ordered several pairs as they break easily when dropped... but they're cheap and cute."
4.0,"the chiffon at the bottom is really a complete under dress. Meaning the entire t-shirt is lined with a polyester black slip of sorts. Not the most breathable. Negates the comfort of the jersey knit outer layer. Still, very cute and easy with leggings. The piping at the bottom of the t-shirt fabric adds unnecessary bulk to the upper thigh area...not a place most ladies want more bulk."
4.0,Bought Youth Size Large for a womens Medium. Fits perfect. Okay quality but looks great.
4.0,Was small gave it to my daughter
4.0,Heavy/Thick Material. Well made and long.
4.0,"This is a nice top. BUT: I ordered a XL, a size larger than I usually buy, as I wanted it to flow loosely. I felt it was not loose enough, so returned for an XXL! Yikes. The sleeves, as usual, are longer than they need to be, but they look fine snugged up. (The brown is too much on the purplish side & didn't match any of my brown pants so I went for the black Tie Dyed to be on the safe side."
4.0,"I got the xl size upon reading the reviews.  they are just right, i wish it was a bit lose but it is a compression tank.  need it for walking.  it is thin but not see thru.  for the price i would say that it is a good buy"
4.0,"Nice beach cover up. Feels a bit over dressy, but I like it."
4.0,"I haven’t walked in them yet. However, they felt so comfortable when I tried them on. I took a star off because they sent me the wrong color 3 times. I ended up keeping the third pair because they are so comfy"
4.0,"Really nice feel but needed to return because it’s wasnt flattering for a pregnant person (which it doesn’t advertise to be, just took a chance). The material feels sexy slinky yet solid and smooth. Runs large to be honest. A small fit me at 9 months pregnant 5ft 5 and 176lbs with a DDD cup. So if that’s a small, imagine medium and large."
4.0,I like it a lot but don’t know how to use the diffuser? Should have some paper explain it
4.0,I liked  the color  and style  but to small a cross the chest but fit good every  where  else
4.0,"The cap stays on throughout the night and isn't uncomfortable.  However, it leaves a black stain on my pillowcase!  At first I thought it was because I hadn't washed it yet but even afterwards, it still leaves black streaks on my pillowcase if I perspire during the night (I live in Southern Texas so that's pretty much every night).  The stains wash out so I'll probably keep using it.  Just not happy with my pillowcase looking dirty!  For this reason I took off one star."
4.0,not as big as i thought. was looking for this type of bag. gave to my daughter for her birthday.
4.0,"perfect sized, well made, heavy weighted"
4.0,It was a gift and heard no complants
4.0,These were perfect in color and size.
4.0,I liked them a lot and they were great. They looked super good with th occasion but broke in 2 months.
4.0,Worked well but hands still got cold
4.0,"Gorgeous color! Size down! Otherwise, perfect!"
4.0,To small ordered a 3x and fits like a med/large beautiful top though
4.0,Looks good but not for really cold weather like in the NE. 3.5 stars.
4.0,"This visor is very dark. It’s like using sun glasses. I can’t use both because it’s super dark.<br />It covers completely my face and neck from ear to ear.<br />It has an adjustable head band with a strong velcro closure. You can also adjust the angle of the visor.<br />Super light weight. Comfortable to use.<br />It does get a little warm inside if you use it very vertical.<br />The only issue for me is that it does distortion a little the view. Just like cheap/ bad sunglasses do. But for the amount of time I use it, it’s ok.<br />With covid around, every extra protection that you can use is welcome."
4.0,"The overall feel of the glasses are good, the tint was a bit light for my taste, otherwise they are good."
4.0,"Not too much cleavage. The large was comfortable to wear and flattering on my 5'7"" and overweight frame. I received many compliments at the family wedding I was at."
4.0,Says 6-8 but says 8 on the tag. They run big.
4.0,"I ordered a medium based on the sizing chart, it was somewhat looser than I would have liked but it wasn't awful. It shipped on time and is decent quality for the price. Overall it was a good purchase."
4.0,Love this dress. The only reason for 4 stars is it was the sleeves were tight around the arms.
4.0,Cute and comfy. Very pretty.
4.0,Dress is very beautiful and has potential to be a very elegant dress. However the dress runs small and I could not zip it up. Size up.
4.0,"I bought this coat after reading the reviews. I'm happy with what I bought. It does what it says and keeps you warm while not being too heavy. I also love the fact that you can detach the hood and the fleece underneath. The only thing is that I wish the sizing had x-small or petite small as the small fit a little too big in my case. For reference I'm 4'11"" and  around 128 pounds. The sleeve ran a little long on both the outer shell and the fleece making the materials bunch up by my wrists and the coat was overall a little too big (except the length). The coat really didn't give me shape and even if I wore many layers underneath it would still be roomy. Too much hassle to return, so I decided to keep it because despite the poor sizing it is a good coat."
4.0,Love this dress fits perfect and comfortable love that it has pockets
4.0,"Ses parfait je l'aime, la taille ect...."
4.0,"Very sloughy, with a fuzzy inner lining which I didn't expect but is good for chilly days.  It is a very casual head covering."
4.0,"This is a cute hat, and nice for the price.  My star deduction is because the feather detail is pretty small AND it comes right out of the hat.  I guess I expected it to be sewn in.  Had this cost more than it did it would have been pretty unacceptable.  For the money you are getting a nicely shaped hat with sweet little detailing that isn't durable.  The hat itself seems plenty durable though so I suppose you could put in another feather if this one flies away.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: at this price point I don't think you could do better but if you are looking for a long term relationship with a hat this one might not be the one for you."
4.0,Nice sunglasses but they're a little too big.
4.0,"Pretty,if it's real. Hope it doesn't turn"
4.0,"Unfortunately I listened to the other reviewers and ordered a couple sizes too large. I think this shirt is probably best if ordered in your true size. Nice shirt, nice buttons, nice material. I will try again in a different size. I plan to buy more shirts from this manufacturer. 5 stars once I find one that fits me."
4.0,The right item for a party
4.0,Was disappointed that the pocket opening was small. I ordered large and was a bit tight. Overall quality was very good! Would recommend this item.....
4.0,"The size is just a bit big but I know that I wouldn't fit a medium. This jacket is fantastic; warm, comfortable and soft. Great jacket."
4.0,My daughter likes the fit and that they're breathable.
4.0,"i love this!! it really looks great on me i haven't had any issues with it discoloring but ill keep this review updated, but as of now i like it! i also receive this product free in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,A little smaller than I expected but very cute and light weight.
4.0,"I was just looking for cheap, polarized sunglasses.  Found these, but the lenses pop out easily.  However, I just use them while driving and the price was right."
4.0,"These are cute but really not a very expensive material and probably won't hold up over time.  The lace is a little cheap. They will last a winter or two though and for the price, I guess that is worth it."
4.0,The product description is accurate and very easy to use.
4.0,"Really nice sweater. A little snug, I could have maybe gone up to a medium. I'm 5'6, 125lbs. I got the small, it still works, I like my clothes form fitting. Wish there were more colors available, I would buy more."
4.0,These are as expected except the stone which is supposed to be gray has a lot of green. I like it so am keeping them
4.0,I got this item because there is a theory that the blue light emitted by computer and TV screens can interfere with sleep patterns. I believe that I am sleeping better sense I have started using these orange lenses. I find that I need to put them on at least two hours before I go to bed for them to have any effect. If you watch TV or work at a computer screen at night and are having trouble sleeping you might want to give this a try.Tthese clip-on lenses are very inexpensive so you don't have much to loose. I would give these five stars except they tend to cause my glasses to slip down a bit.
4.0,I really like this watch. But the only thing I would suggest is more faces to choose from and well for it to be more accurate. In my opinion it doesn't seem to be that accurate it's not that much inaccurate but I can still tell.
4.0,"The sleeve are loose, I took them in a bit. The overall fit was good and the material is soft, it doesn't feel like it cheap fabric"
4.0,"I usually fit in a small, so I ordered a large because I knew I had to order a size up but I also wanted to be comfortable. It is a little loose on me, but it's comfortable. There were a few loose threads, but nothing really serious."
4.0,"These are so fun.  They go on and off easily.  They come in a darling box.  And, they also come with plastic plugs (although I don't think that's necessary) and a wipe cloth.  They are light and look much more expensive than they are.  The pearls look real.  SO....WHY NOT 5 STARS???? Well, I didn't notice this until I put them on, BUT....there is not a Right & Left Earring.  So, on one ear the pearl points out to the front, and on the other ear the pearl points towards the back.  Kind of goofy if you analyze it."
4.0,Decent leggings and they seem to fit well on my little girl. For some reason there is a tag in the back with a glitter type material that is ridiculously scratchy. I had to remove it with a thread stripper so they would be comfortable. The pink leopard print pants are cute.
4.0,"Cute and delicate. My stone placement seems a little off, but barely noticeable."
4.0,Now that I'm retired I find I don't need such a big bag when I go out.  This is not a large bag.  I have the black one.  I like the magnetic snap closure.  I put a cosmetic bag inside it for small items as it doesn't close completely unless you use the metal snap inside.  I found that awkward to use and instead have my key chain clamped to it.  That works great.  I like the material and think it's a smart looking bag.  I'm not terribly fond of the shoulder/cross-body strap.  It has a slide to hold the strap but it moves so easily.
4.0,Seems like a good shirt so far tho I do wish it was a bit softer. It will soften up after a few washes I'm sure but true to size and picture and I deffinantly dont regret the purchase.
4.0,I like the dress but the material is a bit flimsy. I’m using it for a costume for Halloween. I will decorate it with cookies.
4.0,"As expected after reading the reviews. I'm usually a size Medium, and this XXL fits pretty well, glad I followed the review recommendations."
4.0,"It runs a little small, not by much."
4.0,"I like the way the bra fits (I’m a 34C and got a medium). I wasn’t thrilled about the straps being sewn together in the back because it was kind of difficult to close the hooks. A seam-ripper took care of that, and it’s just fine with separate straps. Comfortable, and provides good support."
4.0,"Of the 40 lights in the package, 6 wouldn't light at all and 2 more had an intermittent switch. Based on the other reviews I've seen, an 80% functional rate is rather good."
4.0,"These worked great for our kids ages 6 and 8 for crazy hat day at school. They were a little bit big, but the children had no problems with them being too big. Now too small on the other hand and there would have been problems. Overall these did the job."
4.0,Could have gotten smaller size very comfortable I will try to put in the dryer to shrink a little
4.0,Too small bit it works
4.0,The fit is perfect based on the size chart and very flattering and the quality looks great; it’s a beautiful piece. But fair warning the color on the pink on my phone looked more like a dusky rose pink but what I got was a saturated apricot color. Way more orange yellow to the pink and much more intense than expected. Still pretty and mercifully doesn’t clash w my skin tone too bad but it’s not what I expected.
4.0,"The picture is mostly accurate, and there's 3 of each charm. They're sturdy and well made. The only issue I have is the cross pattern was what I bought the set specifically for, and it was swapped out for a different set of three I don't like, hence the 1 star deduction. I'm happy with the rest."
4.0,Ordered size 3 for 8 yrs old ... were too small . For the price these shoes seem to be ok.
4.0,Runs small need a size up
4.0,"they are very lightweight with excellent lenses. I believe the lens is the same quality of a revo lens, just look at the price of revo's and you can see why I am happy. Although, they are so light, I am afraid to wear them too much in fear of breaking them, just my paranoia, but they are of good quality and a great value"
4.0,"I grabbed this utomatic Watches for Men Self Winding Mechanical Leather Band Moon Phase 24 Hours... watch for my more professional needs - wearing out for date night with my wife, business, and other more formal events. I like it - overall. But not 100%% - hence the 4 stars.<br />1. It comes in a good box that would allow for gifting.<br />2. It includes a bracket - which sometimes watches do - but I never understand why. I’d rather they put the money into the watch. In this case - as with most - it’s goofy looking and I won’t keep it. In all the times I get them, I’ve kept one.<br />3. The watch band is nice looking. It’s a black leather, looks good, and feels good on. I think it’ll last. And it makes for a nice dressed and finished look to an outfit.<br />4. The face is where it looses me a little. I specifically chose the black with rose gold for the dressier look. My wife loved it on the product page - so did I. I don’t have something like it and thought it would be a good addition. Overall though, I’m not thrilled. The black looks good, the face overall looks good, but the rose gold - to me - looks a bit phony - painted on - and not so much rose gold, but more of a tinted copper towards orange. This is a personal thing - my wife sees the phony, but she doesn’t not like it as much as I don’t. I WILL wear it and I will like it - but, I can’t give it a 5 star - I have to go with 4 stars because of the rose color. But beyond that, I will wear and enjoy it."
4.0,"Everything good, but is too small."
4.0,"I am a HUGE Beauty & the Beast fan so when I saw this rose on this necklace - I had to have it.<br />A few thoughts:<br />1. The box it comes in is BEAUTIFUL! Makes for a perfect gift if you are giving to someone.<br />2. The chain... I am NOT a fan of the chain. I got it & this came in a plastic bag INSIDE of the box - note that if you get one for a gift - you should take it out & lay it in the box for presentation.  But the chain was kinked up. It took me about a half hour to get it straight.<br />Also - I'm not a fan of the chain at all.  The hook end is SO TINY.... Like, I'll never be able to put this on by myself. I'll need help.<br />Finally - about the chain - I should have noticed the length - 16 inches. its REALLY small on my neck - makes it a choker.  Its fine - but it makes me feel smothered.  It doesnt hang well on me because of that. But it would be a PERFECT length for a young girl / teen... or a really small woman.<br />3. The charm - ITS GORGEOUS!  I wish I could get a good picture of how sparkly & beautiful it is. You can see in the pic the size in the palm of my hand. Its a good size - & it feels significant.  I love the charm so much.<br /><br />I would give the chain a 3 & the box & pendant a 5 - so averaged this out to a 4.  I'll be looking for a thicker chain & switching that out.<br />Again - a beautiful gift!"
4.0,I used this to go over a navy blue sleeveless dress. It worked great for what I needed. Very sheer and lightweight.
4.0,"Very handy. Not the largest bag out there, but I like its foldability. Good for a gym bag."
4.0,"I like the bracelets the material they are made of, the only problem is that they are too large in length for some people like me who are thin. should offer sizes."
4.0,I bought a set of 3 hoodies together with 3 regular ling sleeved versions.  They are great for layering and good in the WA climate.
4.0,"These are the most comfortable sweatpants I have ever worn. Plus, they have pockets! I'm 5'3, about 100 lbs. and for a looser fit, I got a medium size.<br />I was worried they wouldn't hold up on my small hips, but the pull strings actually WORK and there's enough to make it tight enough, so I don't have to worry about my pants falling down haha. Always a bonus."
4.0,Smaller than expected but I still love it!
4.0,"This is a nice light scarf that is great for any outfit without adding bulk. There are no inconsistencies in the fabric that I can find. There are now washing instructions which would be helpful, but I assume a cold hand wash and drip try would work well."
4.0,"It's not that comfortable with sunglasses on, but I expect they don't think you need sunglasses because of the visor.  I do have a large head and have tried to adjust the fit, but it doesn't seem to want to expand anymore.  I bought it because we have ticks and other various bugs in our woods and I like the back of the neck covering."
4.0,"Very comfortable, but I misread the description and didn't realize they were traditional briefs. All good, though, as the quality and comfort make up for the liberal cut."
4.0,This product looks very well-made  from heavier material than I had expected end unfortunately I was unable to appreciate that quality because I bought it too small!  I don’t shop much for clothing online this is actually the first. But I did receive a prompt refund  But I believe it cost me a few dollars to return This item.
4.0,Love the color n legacy of this slipper vutitstarted at 12.98 then shoot up to 14.98 which is ridiculous within a week. It's very comfortable and so far so good. Just have to be careful with losing your feathers. It's just good for a quiet n relaxing evening at home mood. Plus it's very sexy
4.0,"It was as expected my mom loves it! I didn't like that it is loose a bit, however it is pretty cool!"
4.0,"I usually wear a size 40 (EU) and went for the larger size ML with my wide feet.  I think M would have been just perfect. The shoe is not too tight but a little loose, the way I like it when I wear it in the heat! It's really comfortable and nicely soft for my heel spore."
4.0,Larger then expected so I returned it. But great quality.
4.0,"Cute jacket-lightweight.  Seems to be made rather well.  It is a little pricey, but would buy again."
4.0,If you wear a 9 or 10… pass!
4.0,"I bought this for my 15 year old daughter for water polo, she is 5'9 and 140lbs, with a short torso. A medium fit perfectly. I was worried that it may ride up on her but it fit perfectly. In water polo you have to wear a suit that fits firm on the body and it does that. Price is great compared to others"
4.0,"Very cute! However, the fit, for me, was not appropriate."
4.0,Its small.
4.0,"This is a really pretty ring and it does look real, however, I only had it a month and stones are falling out of the side bands, so I am sending it back. :("
4.0,Well worth the price. Some of them look a little thick but they still look very cute!
4.0,I really like how soft and comfortable this dress is.  I normally wear a large but the large size in this is a bit more form-fitting than I would have preferred.
4.0,"The waistband is a little snug and doesn't give at all (hard stitching w/ no elastic), but overall, the shape is very flattering. I'm a DD cup, and the top provides enough coverage despite the ""wrap"" style. I'll probably still wear a bandeau under it just in case it shifts or gaps during wear."
4.0,A little tight in the chest area.
4.0,I gave this as a present to my daughter and her volleyball friends. She didn't even have it a month and it has tarnished and looks like a used penny.Quite disappointed in this product since it says it's sterling silver. Clearly not sterling silver.
4.0,Bought these for my daughters its cheap jewelry but i think they will wear it.  I think it will look pretty on them
4.0,"It is an OK cover.  I like the looks and feel, but the stitching is already coming undone."
4.0,"haven't used it yet, seems like a good quality, intended to be used on my 9 month old son but fits my head."
4.0,Runs a little small in the bust area. Nice quality material
4.0,"I haven’t had them very long but I got compliments the first time I wore them out. After some time I’d be able to give a better review of durability and comfort with long term wear, but for now they look great and fit as expected to me. Only 4 stars for now since I can’t attest to long wear comfort and durability, yet."
4.0,"They are very nice, but expensive."
4.0,Very cute but a little itchy.
4.0,"Great fit, better product than expected."
4.0,"The scarf is beautiful and fits exactly how I want it to, the only reason I gave it up four is because  it was it was a little bit grayer than I anticipated."
4.0,Love the jersey but I went by the chart and it’s a little big around my torso. Fits goof everywhere else.
4.0,I originally bought my friend the 9mm necklace but you could tell it looked really fake. So exchanged for this one and he loves it!
4.0,Everything is good with this bag but it's too small for me
4.0,"Light weight and cooler than traditional face covering, works for what I needed it for."
4.0,This was much bigger than I thought. It's more like an overnight tote bag and I wanted more of a waterproof everyday handbag. It's too large to carry every day but it makes a great shopping grocery tote or diaper bag so I'm going to keep it when I go food shopping.
4.0,Nice swim skirt. Washes well. Fits good. I had to size down as this runs big. Flattering and would buy again.
4.0,Teen niece loved them!
4.0,"Nicely made.<br />Quality is fine.<br />HD is superb, much better if it is photochromic"
4.0,Bought this as a cheap EDC belt. So far so good but long term longevity is a bit of a concern if anything changes I'll update my review
4.0,"Style,  but did not like the pockets"
4.0,"She was very happy with the cap, this is her favorite style in hats. She is a tomboy and this cap fits her personality to a &#34;T&#34;<br />Great quality and smart looking"
4.0,"Too short for me to wear as a dress, alone, but with crop pants and snappy sandals, it makes a nice casual outfit."
4.0,These are the second set I have ordered of a different color.  They seem to be thinner than the athletic socks.
4.0,Very cute little fish hooks.
4.0,"I wear a size 18, normally a 2XL and ordered the 4XL from reading the comments.  It fits great.  Roomy so I can wear a t-shirt underneath for unpredictable Texas weather.  Not thick so if you are looking for a thick snuggly hoodie, this is not it.  Would recommend it."
4.0,Ordered it for my size but it barely fit my mom who is 2.5 sizes smaller than me<br />It's very opaque too
4.0,"He phone case itself is very nice and holds the few items I need the most (license, money and debit card). The only issue is that the strap broke within two days of using it. I had it on my wrist and it broke. Thankfully the case is durable enough that my phone didn't break. I would recommend purchasing a higher quality strap to use with it."
4.0,"So these are great socks and I would give them a 5 star review if not for one annoyance. These things don’t dry well. It takes about 2 cycles to get them mostly dry and even after that I still have to lay them out to dry fully. As a sock they’re perfect, very comfortable and excellent quality, but for whatever reason bamboo socks struggle to get dry."
4.0,It's a cute top. A little shorter than I like. It ends just above the top of my hip bone. I am 5'5. There is no support in the breast area. My only complaint is that it smelled like bleach after washing it 3 times. My boyfriend is British and loved it. It's very sexy.
4.0,my son wears them all the time
4.0,"Cute, comfy, and looks just like the picture. It is fairly cheap, and white fuzz comes off of it regularly. The pom is also starting to shed. I have not tried to wash it."
4.0,Shoes so cutee
4.0,Pros: Nice construction; very comfortable and warm. Nice suede texture.<br />Cons: Cheap leather odor
4.0,"Love it! Very pretty but I did not like the lump on top in the middle. I’m sure it would have fitted eventually, but I have no patience. I ❤️Olive & Pique hats. I have many"
4.0,Brought for my girlfriend.  Nice piece but chain broke in 2 days.  Had to buy another chain.
4.0,"I liked the fit and the feel of the dress. I wear a size 2 normally and I am 5'5 and about 127 lbs. I ordered a small and it fit great. I just wish I would have brought a different color. I don't like yellow and brown contrast, but all in all, it was a good dress. I just don't like the colors on me."
4.0,Ended up having to buy these twice since the first set got lost in shipping. But the size of these are great for my 9 month old. Not too tight and the bow is the perfect size. Would recommend!
4.0,"They are exactly as described. They are heavier, thicker, nicer than I expected!"
4.0,Good toe socks too.
4.0,Easy on the wallet but classy.
4.0,The design wasn't quite as distinct as I had hoped
4.0,"Wonderful, soft fabric that drapes my hourglass figure with plenty of room. Washed in a lingerie bag inside out on gentle cycle, hung dry and NO pilling of fabric like similar dresses I've purchased online. Bought 6 more to take on a 2 week trip. They don't wrinkle in suitcase. I'm 5'3, 152#, 36-31-42, and size L drapes me perfectly, with hem at bottom of knees."
4.0,"Not really sure what to say about these--they do what they're supposed to do, and the price for the set was very good.  I don't actually need three sets of each size, so I kept two (in case I lose one or accidently throw them into the laundry) and gave a set of each size away.  I've also used the measuring tape to verify sizing, so that was a nice bonus."
4.0,"I like this purchase for the price!! I'm 36C and I ordered size M the bra is very elastic so for jogging, jump or run I think it doesn't work very well but to do weights works perfectly"
4.0,"My daughter loves her watch, the only thing I wish it did differently was play music. It has so many options on it like one or two songs even would have been great. Overall value for money spent is great."
4.0,Great Bamboo sunglasses in a nice storage case.  My husband is thrilled to see that these are polarized sunglasses.  The spot that opens to pull the glasses out is barley big enough to get the sunglasses out.  The case does have a little magnet on it to keep it closed nicely.  The glasses fit my husband great.  He loves his new bamboo sunglasses.  He is very into bamboo anything!  The sunglasses are made with great quailty.  They fit his face nicely.<br />I did get a discount in exchange for my honest review of these Emolly Bamboo Sunglasses.
4.0,Funky socks. Obviously too patterned to really wear with regular outfits but if you are going for a fun look they are cute and true to the photo. Material feels soft and comfy.
4.0,I like it. looks beautiful and shiny.A little heavy.
4.0,Seems well made and should make my trip to the troll hole more memorable
4.0,Nice shirt but seems very lightweight.  I prefer heavier T-shirts.  Shipping was fast.
4.0,"A little scratchy, but a beautiful set!"
4.0,"A couple things. The front cover is fastened with 3 tiny magnets. It’s not very secure bc if you touch it, it falls off and you have to align the 3 tiny magnets to set it back on there, which is quite difficult if you don’t have a mirror.  Secondly, the buttons on the straps don’t align properly with the snaps on the mask so for one, they are difficult to fasten but secondly; they come unsnapped very easily.  Both of these problems I’m sure can be easily fixed with Velcro, but it could be designed a little better or sturdier. Otherwise, it’s great for respiration and air flow."
4.0,These are super comfortable and the large fit perfect. I wear a size 10. I really like this gray color. They breath really well. I think they snag a bit if your legs aren't perfectly smooth. But they are light and airy.
4.0,Size was too large. Returned and ordered a smaller size
4.0,Color is a bit brighter than what I was looking for but they fit well and are cute and comfy :)
4.0,"My wife said it was comfortable and nice to wear. I thought it looked good and she got a nice compliment from a stranger while out. Only 4 stars because some stitching had come loose on the zipper and she had to repair. Size large. 5'8"". 170 lbs. 38D."
4.0,"They were for my son and he just loved them.  Not having creases in your shoes is evidently a new fashion issue, ha!"
4.0,"Very nice bag! Magnet clasps could hold better, but nice bag.  A lot of positive comments."
4.0,"The hat was great, but the little metal tab says &#34;fashion&#34; when it was delivered to me. It doesn't say that in the pictures. I bought this for my dad, and had to cut that metal tab off before I gave it to him. He liked it all the same. The quality of the hat seems great though. It's almost like denim material and the lining around the brim is like leather."
4.0,"Very cute.  It only comes with a clip though, no headband.  Can be worn in hair or clipped on clothes."
4.0,I think it is a lovely coat (well worth the money) but not a good fit for a 'busty' girl (and going up a size would have made the rest of the coat too large. Excellent customer service in terms of returning it.
4.0,Simple top!
4.0,They are beautiful and shiny. Only drawback is they are a little big for my small ear lobes.
4.0,"Very comfortable, easy to stay on. And yes they are a little large. I'm thinking they might shrink a little when they are washed."
4.0,Loved the dress! I would of have it 5 starts but the cleavage part was a lot more revealing than expected. I had to use safety pins.
4.0,"Super cute, a little less coverage on the bum than I was looking for but will definitely still wear. Bright color, I treat myself to a new bathing suit every spring and bought a little early this year because I love the pattern so much.<br /><br />Only complaint: the sanitary liner does not come off in one piece and is super difficult to remove. It left behind a sticky residue which took a while to scrub off."
4.0,Good fabric but it runs small through the hips.
4.0,I am a B cup and never have trouble with shirts being tight on boobs but this one was! You might want to order it a size bigger it you have boobs! Other than that I liked it and wore it with a cami under it!  The shirt made me feel sexy!
4.0,It does wrinkle. Otherwise it looks fine.
4.0,The product looked nice but was too large for me to get a good evaluation of use.
4.0,"I really love the quality and function of this hat being a natural sister myself. I am a bit disappointed with the color though. I got the olive green color, however, it looks to me more like an ashy turquoise in comparison to my olive green jacket sleeve as you can see in the picture. I still do like it though because now it looks a bit more like a denim jean to me."
4.0,It arrived quickly! Good quality of shirt and print. Fit is like a ladies tshirt. I ordered an extra large and it fits like a m/l regular T-shirt.
4.0,Great fit. Really flattering. Very comfortable.
4.0,"This is a very adorable, very nicely made cosplay hat. All the stitching is very nice and neat. However, the hat is HUGE! So huge that I rarely wear it. Bummer..."
4.0,"When it arrived, it was the most wrinkled garment I have ever received.  Since it says not to tumble dry I wasn't sure if I was going to keep it.  It is also very large - I ordered a S - I am 5'4&#34; 115 lbs and two of us could get into this vest.  I decided to wash it in warm water and put it in the dryer (at medium heat) for about 10 minutes.  It shrunk a bit, is not wrinkled and actually looks like the picture now.  I am going to order another one and do the same.....i.e. wash and dry.  The material is t-shirt type of knit with a little flub - quite attractive."
4.0,Cute kid necklace.
4.0,The length worked well. I would order again
4.0,"I ordered this dress when it was marked way down to $11. I figured I could give it a shot for that price! It fit me really well. The stretchy waistline is nice, but the rest of the material has no stretch. My only complaint is the material is super thin. It wasn't a big issue with being see thru (I bought the green), but more of just a cheaper, thin material feel. Still, it is a nice dress, and I wore a knitted sweater with it for the colder weather. Will be nice in the summer too! Really feminine, light, and flowy!<br /><br />I'm 5' 2"" and the XL still only came to my ankles, which was a pleasant surprise! Normally maxi style dresses are too long, so this was a huge bonus."
4.0,"T-shirt material, tight arms, overall ok"
4.0,Rare old pattern - basic garments.
4.0,"I like them. They aren't super special by any means, but for work in yard or on the car, or playing sports they're just what I was looking for."
4.0,Classy and sturdy
4.0,Would be better with sterling closure..
4.0,Got this for my mom who has small hands but these seem to run big and they look big. They are warm for sure but not the most fashion oriented of gloves. Took out one star due to how big they were
4.0,"I wasn't sure if I'd like this for my Monroe piercing,because I've had bad luck with buying body jewelry online.<br />But this item came in the mail today, and it was absolutely perfect.<br />The fit is great, and I like that it's internally threaded. I feel like it's a lot more secure than the snap-in types. It's also super sparkly without looking cheap.<br />I would give this item 5 stars, but the heart looks more like a teardrop. It's okay though. =)"
4.0,Pretty nice good price
4.0,"I purchased these not for a samsung watch, however for another type of watch . I got them because of the color and width of the band. I have tiny wrists so they are very long on me however it tucks nicely with the little strap to tuck it in. Nice to have different straps for your watch, and yes they are easy to put on and take off."
4.0,"The shorts are super comfy and cute and they fit great. They're short, but not too short - I probably could have gone down a size in the shorts. The top is meant for someone with a long torso. The very bottom of it pulls tight across my butt (I have a bubble butt), which makes it look a little funny because the wait area is nice and loose on me. It would fit perfect if the top was about two inches shorter. The cute little dip in the back goes down really far - again because I have a short torso. I'm 5'1&#34; 165, about a size 8-10 and have large boobs, small waist and big butt and ordered an extra large. It's not as sexy as I had hoped, but it's not made for curves, it's more for straight figures.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good purchase. The material is really nice and soft but still felt like it breathed and the top is adorable."
4.0,I still like it :) its a bit big however ... i will wash it and shrink it
4.0,This worked out pretty well for my 2 1/2 year old. The measurements were taken and the small was correct. He didn’t mind having it on but doesn’t like putting it on or taking it off
4.0,"This is a great case that can fit a 17&#34; laptop when needed and a 15&#34; laptop very comfortably. The over-the-shoulder strap is not very comfortable, though, and I've reverted to using a backpack quite frequently."
4.0,"I wanted these shoes, because I wear them inside, and since they are yellow, I can find them fast"
4.0,Cute toe ring
4.0,"I liked this product and it worked for me.  I painted them to go with my project theme and I think they turned out cute.  I also hot glued a gold cord to the back (like a mask string) which I used to hang them.  You could glue feathers to them as well (although I did not because I have cats and they thing everything with a feather is a toy just for them).  My only complaint was that it said a package of 12, but I only got 10."
4.0,Works fine.  Not the fanciest belt but works well if you are blousing.
4.0,Quite nice quality for the price. I use it as an accent piece and as a shawl for cooler days. I am happy with it.
4.0,"Wonderful helmet, however - purchased for husband and I ended up taking it because it ran small."
4.0,"I love how this shirt feels, but it is tighter on me than the usual size large."
4.0,"Very cute, but not sure how much it's protecting? So I use it for special occasions, not the daily to be on the safe side. Definitely pretty."
4.0,the clip is tucked a little bit to much inside otherwise I would have given 5 stars it is a very pretty hat.
4.0,My son love them...
4.0,"This dress is flattering and easy to wear. One note, it says DKNY prominently on one of the sleeves. But I liked the dress enough to get over that pretty quickly."
4.0,works well and holds everything I need.
4.0,Loved the color and fit but it was too short for me at my age
4.0,Just as advertised. I like wider silicon bands so I wear two of these at a time that is color coordinated with whatever I am wearing :)  Great for the price.
4.0,"The sides have an imitation snakeskin design, but the rest of the bag is clear. The strap is easy to adjust to get a comfortable fit at the length each person likes to wear a shoulder bag. It comes with a separate removable bag. This small zippered bag has the look of straw and looks good in the clear bag or can be used with other purses.<br /><br />Some jobs require employees to carry a clear purse and some sporting events and concerts allow only clear bags. I haven’t tried to use it in these situations, but even with the closed sides, I think this bag might work for that. The big drawback is that if I was taking this purse to a crowded event like that, I would want the top to close fully and there are large open gaps at the top of the bag. It’s a fun, casual bag and I have used it to bring a book, sunscreen, and a small water bottle to the pool, so the partial opening doesn’t matter."
4.0,"Very cheap material but my boy likes it, fits good👍"
4.0,"Takes me a bit to get over my breast since I'm on the larger side. I bought this a while back and did not start really using it till recently because when I bought it, I wasn't too serious about dropping some inches. This is great thermo work out shirt if you're like me, someone who wanted to trim down but keep your natural breast size."
4.0,"I ordered this from the actual website Netaya Jewelry. They had a special that included free diamond earrings and shipping for $285 total. I am very happy with the earrings & bracelet.  The diamonds are quite clear to be in the I2-I3 range...not too small either. They sparkle and are consistent in shape and quality.  Not like some are dark or misshaped. Now the bracelet is rather light...you don't get a lot of gold, but also not a lot of filler gold--you want diamonds, that is what you get! The 10k is a lighter color gold of course but most know that with 10k. When I ordered this I was really taking a chance because it had no reviews posted here or on the site. The 14k version however did and I kinda went by that. I did not want to spend over $300 for a 1ctw and am so happy I get both items for less. Early Christmas present to me! The earrings are 1/5 ct but are not too small and have sparkle also. A perfect 2nd or 3rd hole set. Very nice.<br /><br />I can't speak on the durability factor as I just put it on today, but being light weight-- I would not wear it everyday like my other one that hardly ever comes off. I can see where it could snag a sweater or catch on something. I would call it delicate no doubt. So, again overall for the price, I am quite amazed more so by the diamonds. Not dark, cloudy or spotted (to the naked eye). I have to say, the free earrings and shipping sold me as that put the bracelet at about $199 while it feels like I have several hundred $$ on my wrist. If not for that, I just don't know...I don't like to spend money without a perk or bonus. But yeah, I would pay $279 now that I have seen it."
4.0,"I love the uniqueness of the leather strap, but to small for a man's wrist I gave it to my daughter. Made an impact!!!"
4.0,The sweater is a nice knock off. I bought a 3XL it fits like an XL. I’m 5’11” 240lbs. Over all I’m happy with the purchase
4.0,Nice shirt for everyday wear. A little too thick for working out in. Pairs nice with some jeans for a lunch out with friends.
4.0,"Must have sent a women's bracelet, extra small"
4.0,"Love these shorts, bought them in white as well.  The only thing is the waist fits, but the legs can be a little large.  Other than that, great purchase."
4.0,"This cloth is perfect for cleaning my gold and platinum jewelry. It has two sides that clean and buffer. It was perfect. I only wish the cleaning side of the cloth was a little bit bigger, one of my rings, have a lot of tarnish since it is older, and I could use a bigger cloth. Overall, it came on time, and has been working perfectly"
4.0,Very Fun! My daughter loves the themes.
4.0,Seems to be good quality so far.  It is two separate charms.
4.0,This belt worked great for a Rick from Rick & Morty costume. Keep in mind that 56&#34; is quite long. There is a lot of excess length.
4.0,"One of the hoops was a bit hard to use, the clasp was tight, but you can't beat the value. Great buy!"
4.0,"Nice four star product. Not too dark where you're bumping into things or can't see what's going on and not too clear that your get frazzled by the sun. As Goldilocks once said. ""These are just right."" The hinges are decent and the wood temples are well sanded so there's no chance of splinters for now. Of course as you sweat and the wood absorbs the moisture and swells there will be changes. Only time will tell but these feel like they'll last a good while."
4.0,I love this skirt. It fits well in the waist isn’t too tight in the thigh so I can move in it. Super cute for a night out!
4.0,"Really, really like these bonnets. The variety of colors are nice to match every outfit.  They are satin lined so that’s great for protective hairstyles. The buttons on the side are kinda weird but removing them was easy with no damage to the bonnets."
4.0,I ordered this reflective belt because the picture showed a much darker red then all the other red reflective belt. However since receiving my belt I have been asked if it was pink. I think it looks identical to all the other red reflective belts which is disappointing since I wanted the darker red almost maroon in color that this picture showed. But still a great product and worth the money!
4.0,"Good quality swimsuit!! And very cute. I got a size Large, and I'm 36C / 41"" hips. I knew the bottoms would be ""cheeky,"" but they're honestly more like a thong. Very minimal coverage, and they run small. If you're going for a thong, then it's perfect! If you want more coverage, then I suggest buying different bottoms. I have a pair of full coverage bottoms that happen to match. 👌"
4.0,Exactly as advertised and arrived on time.
4.0,This is very cute and the color is the best.  The only thing is that it takes a bit to figure out how to wear it.  I does comes with instructions but I struggled for a bit before I had it on right.
4.0,Firm hold. Slightly high. Good value
4.0,This dress is so cute and the quality is surprisingly good! My only complaint is the length of the sleeves is a little strange with the elastic at the end.  It causes it to be a little uncomfortable and it doesn’t stay in place super well so it will bunch up.
4.0,Don't believe the too small reports! I ordered an XL based on the comments  - and it was huge. I  then ordered a medium - and it was still too big. I just ordered a small and am hoping it will fit when it comes. I usually wear a size 8 in dresses - so this may actually run big!<br />Dress appears to be well made.
4.0,Nice but seen a little narrow
4.0,"I have had a similar designed coin purse for years.  This one is too tall and very very thin.  It's fine if you have never had a real nice leather one from years past.  I will use it, but it actually just makes me miss you old one and wish they made them like they used to."
4.0,"I am a size 14-16 and ordered size 3XL as recommended. This suit is very well made, fits really well and is very comfortable.  I really like it and would recommend it 100%.  Don't let the size recommendation worry you because this bathing suit style is flattering."
4.0,Great water park shoes. They stay wet FOREVER though.
4.0,"I bought this for my niece and she absolutely loves it.  It is true to size and washes and dries well.  But, it took forever to get delivered"
4.0,The fabric is soft and comfortable but I’d like it a bit looser weave.
4.0,"Shirt material was soft, the shirt itself is a little short and the screen printing is very stiff, but for the price it is nice"
4.0,"comfortable , easy on off, seem to hold up fairly well. not at all waterproof but don't claim to be. Very happy"
4.0,"I wear these all the time! My size was perfect. I got an XL and I'm 5""5' and 175 lbs. The fabric is buttery and, importantly, comfortable in the heat. My only complaint is that the waistline is poorly design -- it's just a strip of thin elastic sewn between two layers of fabric! This sometimes gets uncomfortable. Still love them!"
4.0,Lovely dress can't wait to wear it.
4.0,It’s way bigger than anticipated. Overall it’s a cute stylish coat.
4.0,very good value for the money
4.0,Can not complain for the price... I got this as a gift.
4.0,It's easy to use but didn't help all that much lol
4.0,"I wore this to a recent xmas party, it fits great, very comfortable, has a tendency to wrinkle a bit, so after washing, dry and hang on a hanger for a few days to get the wrinkles out. This isn't a pull out the closet and use right away dress, u may have to plan to use it, you can cool iron it as well. Other than that it fits amazing and really gives a flattering figure."
4.0,"Bought a large and it fit perfectly. Good buy for 17$ did manage to get a whole on the skirt easily. I’m 6,5. Around 220lbs but i always have a very athletic build"
4.0,Nice good material.  Give hold on your body. Flattering.
4.0,"Very pretty, flattering fit.  I think I’ll be ordering more in different patterns."
4.0,Very nice bandanas / face masks.  Silky material that is very stretchable and very breathable. Convenient to cover your nose and mouth when needed and then lower when you want.  Would be nicer if it was looser around the neck.
4.0,Super cute! My only issue is that the chain rusted within the first week of me wearing it. Great as a gift for a friend or for yourself.
4.0,It’s more like juniors sizes....but works for my cosplay.
4.0,Wonderful gift for first time parents
4.0,I ordered this dress for an upcoming vacation as I wanted something light and beautifully casual to wear if I wanted to go out. It fits just as expected and for the price is a great value! I would recommend this dress if you are looking for something new to add to your wardrobe without breaking the bank.
4.0,"Cute hat. Keeps my kids warm. I have only had it this season, but seems to be holding up well. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it does not stay on as well as I would have liked. Not a surprise since there are not any ties. The tails hook into each other so does not come completely off their heads, but does slip a bit. Great for ice skating, but maybe not a lively snowball fight."
4.0,Another cute top given to my baby girl..lol has pockets. A nice feature
4.0,"Fits as expected, good price for Brooks-typically $100 +"
4.0,"Love the graphics fits just fine, only downside is the way it is shipped. Had to reshape the bill a little cause it was shipped in a bag, must of gotten flattened."
4.0,Son loves.  He is wearing them today. Appear to be nice quality
4.0,I like them!! I like the texture so they don't look too tight like lycra leggings do!!<br /><br />Melissa A. O'Sullivan
4.0,"This is a decent band for the price. It feels a little stiff, but I think it’ll get better with wear. I’m hoping it won’t start cracking and peeling as it gets worn in. It feels like what I paid for it (cheap), but it looks decent on. First impression is I would buy different colors and recommend it."
4.0,"Light and comfy. A little too see-thru, but ok for beach-wear.."
4.0,Much yellower than expected. looked fine overall.
4.0,"This is a super cute little dress and appears to be well made. The fabric is lovely and soft, but it is not stretchy at all. I normally wear an XL top (bra size is 38DD), but I wanted a loose fit in this dress so I ordered a 2X. The tag in the dress says 2X, so I know they sent the correct size, but I couldn't even get it all the way on! It fits about like a size small to medium would fit me. Returning it."
4.0,"Actually, it is better than expected in terms of material quality. It lacks a couple of features other similar boonie hats have, like the compartment inside on the crown, that it has the material for, as it is double layered, they just didn't do the slit pouch. And the strap feels low quality cotton strand... could've been a more modern ""paracord"" style, but I guess this is more true to fashion to what was worn in vietnam era."
4.0,"Haven't used it yet, looks like it will work well though.  Well made and very roomy."
4.0,"Very comfortable. The only thing I would say is, the picture shows it with two pockets but it only had one."
4.0,"Very cute...but wrong size..I ordered size 5 and they send me a size 9, because even on the box said 9..so I’m going to return it...and I’m gonna make the purchase again,,,this time I hope the correct size.....5 please"
4.0,"Cute little extras on these.  They’re truly harem pants - very loose and inseam hangs  substantially lower than regular.  I’m 70, short and round - accustomed to altering to fit myself. I always need to hem.  I haven’t worn or laundered yet but expect to cool wash, hang dry, and iron - pretty much to be expected with linen. I’ve purchased a lot of Minibee’s linen clothing and that’s worked great with all.  Sizing is consistent."
4.0,"Runs a little narrow, but my husband loves them."
4.0,"Pretty nice , for the price"
4.0,I really like this case/wallet. I wanted something that would be enough to hold all my stuff so I could stop carrying a purse and this did it. I even have empty spaces!! My only complaint is that the zippered part doesn't open well so it is hard to put in or take out anything. Other than that I love it.
4.0,"i couldn't find my bride of chucky costume this year, so last minute i decided to break this out and i'm glad that i did. it literally took less than 30 seconds to apply, though i did end up having to rearrange them a bit to get the look i wanted. they ended up staying on my face all night, which was surprising because my face tends to get pretty oily. the headband was pretty cheap and a tad too tight on my head, but a lot of little girls ended up telling me they loved my costume that night :)"
4.0,"Breathable and good for working out, but a bit large towards the bottom."
4.0,Cute shirt. Material is a little thin. Not see through but seems like over time where the little cut outs are the material may tear. I would still purchase again though. The fit is as expected and would recommend sticking to your regular size.
4.0,I really liked this suit. I just had a baby and was looking for a suit that covered more but wasn’t a one piece so if you’re looking for more full coverage bottoms these are perfect. I like that the suit covers well while also being cute. The suit seems to be really nice quality and a mix of solid material and strips of mesh. I felt like I was held in well by the bottoms & the top. Size fit as expected. Washed well.
4.0,"I like the socks because they fit, are no-show, deodorized and easy to store."
4.0,It doesn't adjust very well to my ear which is why its not 5 stars but its amazing looking
4.0,Nice and there's alot of them.
4.0,These are great but they do catch on fabrics and I had trouble with one that wouldn’t stay closed
4.0,great boots for the price and my granddaughter loved them
4.0,"These were bought for a discerning and somewhat skeptic person who believes in trying out the shoes before buying them. They surprised us both - and were accepted gleefully. Very light-weight, these shoes provide the exact fit comfortably and can be worn through the day without feeling the itch to take them off and let your toes breathe ..<br /><br />Yes, they are good! Really good!"
4.0,Cute sundress. Bought it for cruise to wear into port. Comfortable and perfect fit. I am 5'6&#34; 150 pounds and ordered the medium. As stated in other reviews I also received a bead bracelet.
4.0,These were very thin somewhat sheer material but very soft and stretchy. They did not work for me as far as business casual but definitely would be cute to go out in if you have the right shape. I’m a mom of two so these were a tad too unforgiving for me. I’m 5’9 and 140 with narrower hips and I ordered a medium. They were like fancy leggings
4.0,I used product to wear. .fit. Was as expected. It was easy to get into.
4.0,Kind of fits like a maternity bathing suit. Nice colors. Bagging in front. So good if you wanna hide some belly.  Looks like a bathing suit dress.
4.0,Had the smell of urine when recieved. there was one piece that wasn't attached when opened & im not sure what it goes to but yeah 🤷🏾‍♀️ besides all of that I reccomend.<br /><br />*** some clasp parts are small so be careful because it can be tight and irritate your ear
4.0,"I won't bake without a hairnet. These are definitely not flimsy, and they do exactly what I bought them for!"
4.0,I ordered a size 4T and it's labelled as 4T but it's more like 5-6T. The pants are way too big. I have to sew the waist tighter so it'll stay up and she can wear it. My daughter loves the design though and is excited to wear it.
4.0,Cubren muy bien!!!!
4.0,"These pajamas are so incredibly comfortable and they are really warm, too.  They are a pretty shade of pink.  The top is a little on the short side.  I'd prefer it to be just a tad longer.  Overall, I really like these pajamas."
4.0,great fit and fabric comfort for lounge wear.
4.0,Much cuter than l expected for the price.  Gave one to a friend who has an I'll family member.
4.0,This color is not correct. It's more pink/light mauve. There are no pockets. It has a cool diamond shape on the back.
4.0,Nice material and color. Good option to wear to a weekend party.
4.0,"beautiful coat, but came too large."
4.0,The backs are very difficult to handle.
4.0,"Beautiful too, but unfortunately didn't work for me and my 5'2&#34; frame. It engulfed me."
4.0,"I'm 5'3, it's pretty short!! Not lined. Might need a slip or leggings of some type."
4.0,"I ordered a large because I usually wear a medium and the previous reviews said it runs small.  It fits me perfectly.  The arms are not long, so I'm going to have to be careful that it doesn't shrink.  I am wearing it right now with leggings.  Perfect and comfy!"
4.0,"The pink is very light, almost a peachy/salmon color.  I dyed it a petal pink, and the dye took really well."
4.0,I like this but I think it runs a bit small so order a size up!
4.0,It's so soft. I like it.
4.0,"I love this dress - I wore it on a vacation to Mexico. Be aware that it does run pretty small. I usually wear an 8-10 and ordered the Large and it was snug in the bust and hips. I would recommend ordering a size up. Otherwise, it was super comfortable and very cute!"
4.0,"The dress was beautiful on me but, The dress arrived with several small holes in it. ( easy fix), which I had expected from reading the reviews, and it was a little tight. I ordered a large I'm 175 and 5'1 DD breast cup, and I wear a size large. I would reccommend getting a XL if you want a little more wiggle room and coverage in the breast area, But the large fit great and will snatch ur body together if needed. The second dress I got a XL in black and it had ""No holes"" and gave the formal look I wanted."
4.0,"I got these for a great price and they seem super comfy! Mind you, I’m not the one wearing them, but my son didn’t complain so that’s always a good sign."
4.0,Cute dress. A tiny bit high waisted for me but still cute for the money
4.0,"I ordered this to fulfill a request from a charity and so won't know how well it will fit the 9 year-old girl who receives it. But I can tell you the the quality of the fleece material and the lining used in the hat and gloves is good, not skimpy, and should be warm enough for a Mid-Atlantic winter.  Hope it fits!"
4.0,So I bought this on a whim almost expecting it to be terrible i originally wanted to use this  as a septum ring because I had one similar in the past an missed it so when I found this one that was almost exactly like it I went for it well it’s definitely to big to be used for a septum ring and touches my lips and that’s too low for me but it works perfectly for my inner conch piercing also the bead is a pale blue not that dark blue the picture has I have yet to test the glow in the dark aspect though it won’t bug me though if it doesn’t glow lastly the captive bead seems to be secure tight enough to hold but not too tight where it’s a pain to try and put in
4.0,A little tight and somewhat see through. Needs a slip but good in length
4.0,"Beautiful gown just like Olga and Miss Elaine used to make.  Be aware if you order the Peignor SET of robe and nightgown however that due to the very stretchy lace bodice on the nightgown, the nightgown runs large while the light robe -  runs small - with sleeves that are a little short.  I am keeping it but next time, I will try to order them separately in order to get a better match."
4.0,"I groom dogs and these are my favorite. light weight, water and hair resistant. The seems on my second pair started to split in the butt. Maybe I have a ghetto booty idk.  But I will buy more because I still love them the most."
4.0,The lettering on the straps started rubbing off after 3 days.
4.0,If you’re flying this bag when completely full exceeds the size allowed for a personal item. It won’t comfortably fit under a plane seat. Other than that it’s perfect. It’s a very thin material so easily stored while you’re away. Colors are pretty also.
4.0,"Like these but I got them for my plantar fasciitis and it made it worse. My 12-year-old has them and absolutely loves them, though, so if you don't have foot problems, get them. Comfy for flip flops."
4.0,"I like the suit just wish it was a little lower cut in back, but does hide spare tire quiet well.  Overall pleased."
4.0,"Love these socks except for the fact that they are extremely hot when I wear them with shoes. I have neuropathy and unfortunately, these make my feet burn more in shoes. Other than that one things I think they are great. I can only wear in the winter months but they sure will come in handy then."
4.0,"Nice material, unisex, tan color is more like light medical bandage color. Knew it would be too big for my tiny wrists so i planned to wear it to cover a 2x2 tattoo on my upper forearm. Fit was pretty close to perfect, sat just below my elbow bend, but needs some kind of elastic inside to hold it in place. Material is pretty durable. Stitching blends witb material and label Is printed lightly on one side (inside) of wrap."
4.0,"Light material, exactly as image. Fits well even after a couple washes.  Will eventually buy another when it wears down."
4.0,The look of this blouse is very nice. The material was not what i expected in that it was not as soft as i would have hoped for.
4.0,Fits as size chart would indicate. It's a little shorter than I would like but I'm very long waisted so I wouldn't consider it a flaw or drawback. The color is really a dusty lavender or mauve. Pretty and price is great!
4.0,This dress is very nice but very tight in the mid section. I’m on the fence about returning it. It’s also a bit see thru so you’ll need a slip for sure.
4.0,Was great but the string ripped.
4.0,"I bought the rose gold one first, love the size. Then bought the silver one, it came much smaller, not as happy with that one. (Shown in the picture above)<br />Might buy the gold one just to see what size that one comes in? Lol"
4.0,Beautiful rosary but not as blue as shown in picture.
4.0,The shirt is actually great! I took a star off because the description says it's for Jr. It's not! It's cut for women. Luckily I fit the small perfectly so I'm keeping it for myself. I was actually trying to buy it for my 10 yo boy. I would definitely recommend this shirt for the ladies. Love Bruce!!
4.0,I like them. I ordered a couple different colors. I like the flow and fabric.  They are really long though so you have to lift them when you walk upstairs or step on them and take a tumble or yank them half way off your behind when you step on them.
4.0,"These are solid luggage tags.  You don't have to worry about them falling off for sure.  Between the thick pvc rubber material of the tag and the stainless steel cable for attachment, they are secure.  As other reviewers have stated, you need a fine tip permanent marker to write your information on the white sections of the tag.  These white sections are a little narrow and slightly raised from the surface of the tag, so care needs to be taken when writing your information on the tag.  I read in another review that permanent marker can be erased on these tags with nail polish remover, but I have not attempted that.  Attempt at your own risk.  Anyways, these tags are worth the money for security of your checked bags.<br /><br />I did receive these tags for a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Great for curly hair… Keeps curls in tact
4.0,"Good quality band, but the links are so tightly connected with the pins that the tool used to push the pins out bent and broke."
4.0,I purchased these socks along with a bunch of other Taylor swift items for my niece’s Taylor Swift themed party back in April. Well she just sent me this pic and we had a good laugh! Supposed to say “love you to the moon and to Saturn”. Not Staurn. 🤣
4.0,Is not size 11 is smaller
4.0,"So cute! I bought all three colors and they all look good! They fit my wrist quite nicely, and its pretty easy to get hair ties around them.  The extra elastic hair bands are great and come in cute colors!"
4.0,Love the size and shape of these sunglasses. They run big which is good for my large head. I wish they had a center bar above the nose. Otherwise perfect. Great sun blockage but still have good visual.
4.0,"I like these sandals, but the leather is a little hard and it took a while to break them in.  I've only had them for a month, so it's hard to tell how durable they will be.  So far so good."
4.0,I'm only giving this 4 stars because I was sent the incorrect product at first. It took them over a week to get me the correct product and size. The top is actually very cute and flattering for summer. Straps are not adjustable but they are stretchy. I would size up if you want it longer
4.0,"I got a ton of compliments on this dress. It is short, but not too short. It’s the perfect - throw in your suitcase dress for the beach."
4.0,CUTE BUT SNUG.
4.0,Very good quality and support. Thank you again Nurse Mates.
4.0,I bought the item because the embossed dragon appealed to me.  The dragon is every bit as impressive as I had hoped it would be.  Very cool.  The wallet is a little bigger than I expected which makes it a bit hard to use -- getting it in and out of pockets for example.
4.0,"We got these shoes for a daddy daughter dance for my 4 yr old. She usually wears size 9, we got size 10 and they fit perfectly. They did not hurt her feet even after being worn for a while. They're decently made. No issues with things falling off like some other commenters. I recommend socks or tights to be worn with it though. The shoes are very stiff and could rub their little feet raw. My daughter wore socks and they were still totally adorable. She said she liked the feel of them with socks better anyway.<br /><br />I doubt my daughter will ever wear them again so I will not be able to find out how long they last.<br /><br />**Edit**<br />So my daughter loves these and has worn them alot. To the store many times, church, other places. So far they're holding up pretty well. Though if anything did fall off it's all held together by hot glue anyway. My child is not hard on shoes at all. So you may have a different experience if your child is really harsh on their footwear."
4.0,"and looks really cool on, for teenage boy"
4.0,I like them but a bit hard to put on
4.0,"Love this casual dress. Seams are too high on sides so I sewed the an inch or two ... Can't notice and now it's a great, sexy summer dress without being uncomfortable. I'm 5'4"" so slits were high on me. Length is good with healed sandals"
4.0,"I bought size M, it is true size, but I prefer it to be a bit more narrow (waist area) and shorter."
4.0,I love this dress...bought it in a second color after getting it and seeing how flattering it was on a fuller figure.
4.0,Cute top to throw on with leggings
4.0,Graphic is good quality and doesn’t easily wash off. Material is decent enough. Fits very well and is comfortable to wear!
4.0,"Really cute! Top underneath is kind of more loose than I expected, would have ordered a size"
4.0,They are a nice slipper.Everything I’ve ordered lately has been on the small side so I ordered a little larger this time and it was a little larger.So I have to take part of the blame for no 5th star.
4.0,I like the construction and overall weight of the jacket. I’m 5’2” 180 lbs. I am a pear shape but this jacket is made go an apple shape. I almost sent it back but like it so much I will wear it unzipped.
4.0,"It's comfortable, looks just like the picture, and goes with a lot of things."
4.0,"Looks really cute for the price, but lookout, the anchor gets caught on clothes constantly."
4.0,"this is a really cute dressier band. It's a little difficult to install because you can't separate the two sides, but really pretty once it's on."
4.0,Embroidery on the adjustable tab in the rear of the cap is hidden so that it fits a size 7.
4.0,"It’s very comfortable, slightly stretchy material. I’m about 130lbs, 5’ 1” , and I got the medium. Fits perfectly! Only issue is that the zipper lays a little funny, otherwise it’s a cute skirt."
4.0,"I find myself taking the gloves 🧤 off to use my phone 📲. Sad 😞 the are a snug fit so if you have large hands like me, you probably want to try another glove. They are cute, snug and warm..."
4.0,"First, I'm a man - I found myself in need of a small so-called 'Man Bag' capable of carrying my phone, wallet, keys, and an external battery pack.  This bag seemed like a great value, especially with Prime Shipping (I tend to leave stuff to the last minute and needed it for a trip).<br />The construction is satisfactorily rugged, with a smooth liner enclosed by the canvas exterior.  the green was much more subdued than the photo indicated, which was to its benefit for my uses.<br />My most significant comment is that a brightly-colored interior would've gone a long way to improving usability - stuff tends to shift and not be where I expect it, and unless there's a light source directly above the opening, it can be difficult to find something.  a key strap might also be useful, so that they don't fall to the bottom.<br />the expandability was nice - when my wife unexpectedly tasked me with carrying a zoom lens (55-200 for the photogs reading this) for her DSLR, I was able to expand the bag and handle it without a problem."
4.0,"It's a good quality poster. I personally wish it was a little bit higher resolution, but it still looks good from 5 feet away."
4.0,"love the idea but this item is cheap..... will last you 3 washes.... the lines fade and crack after the second use..... hand wash it will last longer..... its small but once you wash, it get loose. if you have big legs the line will crack as soon as you put it on...."
4.0,"The material on this dress is thin and because it was folded up, it created wrinkles in the dress. I had to iron the wrinkles out but had to be careful with the heat setting as the material could burn. Luckily I started from low and gradually went up until I found the right amount. You will get glitter on other stuff but it’s small and I love glitter. I got so many compliments. I ordered a medium and the dress was still too big. I had to safety pin the strap that goes over your shoulder as it kept falling down. I would def order a size down.  I’m going to have mine altered but I really loved how sexy this dress is."
4.0,Did not expect it to be so nice for what i paid definitely worth up to $15. My grandmother loved it.
4.0,"These might not be made of the best quality materials, but they are decent ties.<br /><br />They have a nice thick design and tie nicely.<br /><br />They lay nicely once tied.<br /><br />They have a slightly shiny aspect to them.<br /><br />For the price this is a decent set and would make a nice gift."
4.0,"super cute. Not slouchy enough. I'll wear it, but would have like it better with more slouch"
4.0,"This dress is flattering, it is very comfortable to wear and I get complements from strangers every time I wear it."
4.0,"I ordered a 2XL and so glad I did, as this hoodie runs on the  small side.  I normally wear an XL in almost everything Harley brand.  I don't like tight fitting shirts though, so if you want it snug, then you may be able to order your regular size."
4.0,Love it! But the buttons are going to need extra thread added or I'll be loosing one. And no extra buttons is added to coat.
4.0,"I love the cut and feel of these, so soft and flows away from the body. Flattering for a larger girl like me.<br />However I took one star away cause it is rayon & spandex which has to be hand washed and not dried. It is recommended to be dry cleaned.<br /><br />This is basically a long sleeve t-shirt, I’m not taking it to the dry cleaners.<br /><br />Hopefully I will remember to not put them in the dryer."
4.0,It’s nice to be able to keep your hair up off your neck and back and protect your face from the sun.
4.0,"This dress is adorable! I’ve received countless compliments. It is a bit large in the chest, and I’m a C-cup. Definitely buy a crinoline to go with it if you want the poofy look. Otherwise it does sit a bit flat. But overall, this is a great dress (and super adorable!) for the price."
4.0,Lost it’s shape when shipped
4.0,"I’m 5’5” 120 lbs, S was too tight on the torso. Returned and got M and it fit perfect"
4.0,"Very nice shoe, very cute and toe box is roomie."
4.0,"The fit is a bit larger than I like, but still very wearable.  Probably best for &#34;big and tall&#34;, since it is a bit longer than my other shirts--but it's all the same to me once tucked in.<br /><br />Worn and washed a half dozen times and it is still in great condition.  The material breaths well enough and I hang it up immediately after it comes out the dryer and I've given it a good shake to prevent wrinkles.  it is indeed a non-iron shirt as long as you don't leave it crumpled up in a pile for an extended period.  No need for collar stays, since the collar tips in this are closed and has some stiff material inside that keeps it's form.  I still prefer removable collar stays, since they can be replaced when bent out of shape.<br /><br />I like it well enough and wouldn't mind buying it again, but there are other similar shirts that would fit better if you don't need &#34;big and tall&#34; sizes.  If you do fall in that category, then you won't regret getting this since it should fit well."
4.0,"Color as pictured, a beautiful blue. The necklace came well packaged. No damage. It's pliable enough that you can kind of form it to your neck but that can also make it kind of tricky to get each ring to lay flat and in order. Otherwise great buy especially for the price."
4.0,"The pendant is gorgeous and I like that it is slightly rounded. It gives dimension to the piece. My only &#34;complaint&#34; is that the chain was a 16&#34; chain, instead of an 18&#34; chain, so I had to put the pendant on a different chain. Still, a beautiful piece that I have worn every day since I received it."
4.0,Let's be realistic.  You're getting TWO cases for an extremely low price.  They will work just fine under most circumstances.  I liked that they would hold larger wrap around glasses such as shooting lenses.  They will probably not hold up well to rough use.
4.0,I love this bag. It holds everything. But it does bleed into white clothing. Found that out the hard way
4.0,It came really quickly and it was great quality. It was a little smaller than I had envisioned but overall what I expected.
4.0,Great cushioned seat cover for the price.  The only reason it got 4 instead of 5 stars is that the actual color is more blue than bright teal (which was the accent color of the bike this was bought for).
4.0,"I love it. Not scratchy like other reviews suggest, but I did have to alter it to make it fit better."
4.0,"Be careful with ironing!!!  Was horrified when I put an iron to this dress the night before I was going to wear it for the first time and I scorched it! Iron shaped imprint right in the middle of the skirt and could not wear it. The fabric on the skirt is deceiving because it's thick and therefore I thought sturdy. No where on the tag that is hanging from the dress does it warn about a too hot iron. Only on the tiny tag inside the dress does it say &#34;cool iron&#34;. I ruined it, totally my fault but very sad that I wasn't warned because I did read the tag hanging from the dress prior to ironing just not the little one inside.  Now I have a beautifully ruined dress hanging in my closet. It is a really pretty dress that's why I can't bring myself to toss it yet. (sad face)"
4.0,"Exactly as pictured,  Works great.  In my case I needed a thin band to snake under the pins and this fit perfectly.  I have a small wrist for a man but there were plenty of holes on both sides of the one that fits."
4.0,Skirt looked good and fit was on target
4.0,Very nice item but didn't fit
4.0,I will prob get one size larger next time.
4.0,"It’s casual, light, stretchy. Exactly what I was looking for. It fit as expected."
4.0,I really love the sunflower design
4.0,"I love that it arrives on time, and the material feels really good, not too thick or thin. I love the style of the dress and I know it will look awesome once I do a little adjustments. I followed the size chart but it fits a little too loose, and that's the only issue I have, otherwise it is great."
4.0,"Perfect shoe for cold weather. They are a little too wide but if I wear a thick footie sock they fit better. As always, blowfish shoes are comfortable and last."
4.0,"Good quality, well made. I ordered a size larger and they are a little tight. With wear, they should stretch a bit."
4.0,"Tho it's very beautiful,& sturdy, Its quite a large bangle in circumference, for the average small wristed woman, i requested a smaller made one, but got no reply.😔"
4.0,Wasn't expecting them to be a bright purple however I still like them.  Great price!!!
4.0,"I love these belts. Well-made, comfortable, good weight, adjustable and a reasonable price. One negative. I've had them for over two weeks and had not been able to wear them out of the house until today because of the strong leather smell."
4.0,As expected-a cute tote
4.0,This swarovski knockoff is perfection.
4.0,Great fit and loved the color
4.0,These slippers run big I suggest you purchase them in a smaller size
4.0,A little too big. The fabric is a little on the rough side but overall it’s cute and you can work with it.
4.0,It is nice and thick. It fit just just tight enough. I am short so the length is a little too much but it doesn't roll up on the bottom and it hides the &#34;undr bra strap&#34; fat.
4.0,I purchase this along with a WW strap for my Washburn 12 string.  It matches the headstock and does the job.  Rated 4 stars since I felt it is a bit pricey for such a small piece of leather.
4.0,"I ordered this cardigan in the black color size 2x. It fits good and can be used with a tank top or thin long sleeve shirt. I would handwash this item,hang dry because it can get fuzzies on it after washings."
4.0,"They are right, order one size up on the belt. I did and I am on the middle notch - perfect. It is a little more red in color than picture shows and unfortunately - MADE IN CHINA"
4.0,"Never ever bought glasses online. Looked affordable, so wanted to try. Fit is great, feels a little plastic but not cheap, looks classy. In love, very happy"
4.0,"This is a cute dress. I don't love the material. I was expecting it to be drapey and body forgiving, but it does show every little thing. It's fine with shapewear under it. I am 5'7"" and 155 pounds and the large is OK but almost too small, especially in the chest area. I wear a jacket over it and then it's OK."
4.0,It’s really  good  size but I returned it because of wrong size
4.0,So far not bad for the price. I'm happy with the colors and I'm hard to please. I can now find my glasses when I need them. I will change my review if I find fault.
4.0,It’s much larger than I thought. I tied the back of it and it looks pretty cute that way though... I would exchange it if I weren’t lazy.
4.0,"The jewelry is very nice, great size for my caps."
4.0,Super cute! The material is synthetic so I wouldn't wear all day.
4.0,Good for summer<br />Very thin shirts
4.0,"I enjoy wearing it, i think its comfortable and good value for money"
4.0,Super cute for little mermaid mersister costume base. However it runs small. My daughter is 5'6 and 115 pounds. We ordered a medium and it was too short in the torsal and tight in the arm pit holes.  She said it felt like it was cutting off circulation. Returned for the a large. Fits better.
4.0,"Got this for an upcoming trip to the beach and it's sufficient for my toiletries (although I'll keep my makeup bag separate.) The measurements are approximately 11&#34;x9&#34; and the base is about 3.5-4&#34; wide; the bag tapers towards the top. There is one zip pocket on the outside, one on the inside, segmented mesh pocket in front and a roomy open compartment, plus a hook. The brand logo embroidered on the front looks kind of stupid, it does look too much like a kids' monogrammed bag. But that's not a big deal, this is everything I needed for a great price. I have yet to see how it stands up to traveling."
4.0,"It wasn't quite what I was expecting from the photos quality-wise, and it's rather long in the leg, but it works well enough for what I purchased it for. I may buy another pair depending on how durable they prove to be."
4.0,"Nothing to complain about with either of these straps. The black one was a bit softer (which is good) than the green one, which is now on a watch I don't wear very often. I have the black strap on a Casio digital Sportswatch, one that looks like and is *almost* as tough as a G-Shock, but doesn't cost nearly as much. It looks pretty cool and is much more comfortable than the rubber/resin strap that came on it. Also, because there are two layers of nylon strap between the watch and wrist, I think the temperature measurements on the watch are a bit more accurate, in that the body heat doesn't have direct contact and affect the readings as much. I recommend Ritche and this color combo of NATO straps."
4.0,"It is soft and warm for a kid who hates to wear shoes, great buy!"
4.0,"UPDATE: while the original necklace we received broke quickly, we received a replacement immediately. The new one seems to be holding up and my daughter is thrilled.<br />ORIGINAL:<br />my daughter worked so hard to earn the money for this and in less than 24 hours 1 eye fell out, and then the other. so sad."
4.0,This was a beautiful dress to wear for a wedding.  i am 5' tall and did need to wear heels with it because it was a little long but not terrible.  I got lots of compliments. Very comfortable also.
4.0,Wings are different material as shown in the picture the rest of it just perfect.
4.0,Amazing outfit!!!!!!!! It’s so good and I love it. But do be worried about  sizing. I’m a medium at best and the outfit was an little small so if you’re a medium do get a large. But in all the outfit is amazing. I got it from my popuko cosplay💕
4.0,ESTRECHO
4.0,"My optometrist recommended yellow lenses to wear on top of my prescription glasses to improve my driving vision - they reduce glare. The wraparound is a great feature  - it reduces glare from the sides. The grey one is too dark. The price still made it more affordable than others on Amazon,  even though I can't use the grey pair. I wish they had packed 3 yellow ones together."
4.0,Looks Cheap but cute
4.0,"These pants fit well. They are a bit long, but I am 5'2&#34; so that's normal. They are comfortable and look professional."
4.0,"LOVE this top but I foumd the size chart to be inaccurate. I originally ordered an xl, but it was too big on me. Reordered the large in the hunter green (great color) and a few others. Going to give the one that was to big to my sis because this top is so flattering."
4.0,"I Got these for running, I love the fit and really love the color options, I got the yellow stripe, these are basically tights though, I was hoping for more compression type, but regardless I still like them.."
4.0,"I have only given 4 stars because it does have a little room. I bought a medium but a small would've fit nice, snug and body fitting. I'm 5'8&#34; and this jumper is long enough that I can wear with heels and it not be short. without shoes, it touches the floor. My measurements: bust: 36, waist: 29 and hips 41 and a small would've been a neat fit, but the medium still looks great on. Good material. Great buy! Think I'll order in another colour but in small."
4.0,Exactly as advertised. Looks good
4.0,Definitely like that it helps with my posture. I can wear for hours at a time and not feel uncomfortable. Dislike that I cannot wear with majority of my clothes only certain material or you will notice. Definitely love the hour glass shape it gives me though. Received plenty of compliments.
4.0,I've used these a few times and they worked well. A decent tool for the price.
4.0,not exactly what I expected.  The color combos are just mediocre.
4.0,Beautiful but runs a bit large
4.0,"Would be 5 stars.  Just wish there were more pockets or dividers.  Big enough to hold my full-size organizer, plus Kindle.  Love the sturdiness!"
4.0,"it is nice on me, however It is not high quality and a little odd the shape."
4.0,"OKAY love the pajamas, but stating that these are “Scented” is false advertising. They have zero scent to them. Still, cute pjs and daughter loves them."
4.0,My daughter absolutely loved this bracelet!
4.0,"Skort is both comfortable and complimentary with a modern, youthful flair to it."
4.0,"We gave it to someone as a gift and do not have access to her opinions :-), but we liked it!"
4.0,Good quality product. Make sure you order a size larger than what you usually wear.
4.0,"I love the quality of these jeans and the cut is fairly contemporary.  But the style reminds me of the old Gloria Vanderbilt style jeans.  Very dark denim with high contrast stitching.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is just a comment to give some idea of what these jeans are like.  Overall, I am impressed with the quality and fit.  These are good jeans for the money."
4.0,Love it but it is sheer so beware!
4.0,Cute value hat. Worn for a company party to hand out Turkeys for Thanksgiving. My small children destroyed them within an hour by pulling off the eyes and hat. I wouldn't recommend for a child but it did the job I needed it for.
4.0,"I like the rings, love the colors and the fit is great. My previous silicone ring was a little bit looser on the fit but never bothered me when working out. These rings seem to be great little bit more narrow and stiffer. They do dig in a little when I grip the barbell or pull up bar. They work nicely for work and the price was great."
4.0,"Cute top but it looks much bigger in the picture, it seemed to run shorter on me and I'm only 5'6&#34;. Decent quality."
4.0,"It's definitely warm and comfortable, but not at all flattering. The color is a little garish.<br />This is the coat you wear for its great personality."
4.0,"Bought this blazer as part of a costume. I am a size 8 (US) and took other reviewers advice by ordering a larger size. I went up to an XXL and it was still on the small side. I still wore it, but without buttoning and it worked. Just wish I had gone up even more on the size."
4.0,I'm wearing them. I have no idea if they help but I'm wearing 'em.
4.0,Nice thick socks!
4.0,purchased for man size 10.5 feet and wasn't even CLOSE to fitting him...but fits size 8.5 ladies just fine! hooray for me!
4.0,Pretty swanky. Though I wish I could plug it into the wall somehow so I don’t have to buy batteries as a wall decoration. Otherwise it’s super sick and if you want a cool mask for a costume or for cosplay this is a pretty good option I think.
4.0,"My son is 6 and is a really true to size 6 year old. I ordered a 7 so these could hopefully get him through two summers. They are shorter than I expected. If you like a longer style of short, these are not it. They will do for this year, but next year I will probably be looking to buy new swim shorts for him."
4.0,Great balaclava. I have one adult sized one for myself and purchased this kids size for my 10 year old son. It fits really tight and think this is more for small kids aged to 8.
4.0,Very comfortable dress.  Recieved compliments.
4.0,very pleased and my daughter loved it
4.0,"I really love the hexagonal shape, but I don't have the money to spend on brand name sunglasses that I know I will probably lose or break. These look almost the same, and feel fairly comfortable. The arms are very stiff and don't fit perfectly to all faces, but for its price I can't complain too much. It's lightweight so I forget about its stiff arms. Currently I'm on my 2nd pair because the hinges aren't the tightest and I didn't notice my sunglasses fall off where it was hanging from my shirt. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair when my current ones disappear."
4.0,Great Harry Potter bracelet!
4.0,Perfect for Unity costume
4.0,I purchased this watch as a gift for my grandson's 5th birthday. The watch fits perfect and looks great. Package arrived quickly . I will update the review in a few months to let everyone know how durable the watch is.
4.0,My husband and I are big Star Wars fans. I liked these. The only problem was the key ring was so difficult to get off that in the process it scratched them up. We have these on our keychains now. Very affordable and a cute little gift.
4.0,Very high waisted.  But fits well and seems to wash well.
4.0,"These are great laces, a little lighter in color than I had expected based on the picture, It didn't show up as clear as a bandaid as I had hoped but they are very cute and well made and I would still recommend them"
4.0,"Nice Jacket, a little big in the sleeves but it's great"
4.0,I bought according to the size chart but it is too big. it is good quality.
4.0,"These were okay. I wear a women’s US size 8 and they are on the tighter side, barely fitting into my ankle."
4.0,"I like the way it looks, just wish it fit more like the x-large it claims to be."
4.0,"Nice product. Son liked it. A bit loose in the waits, but my son is on the skinny side.<br />Would buy again."
4.0,This pair of jammies is warm and very comfy.  I like the color but it does leave pink fuzzys everywhere (especially when new).  The leg cuffs help keep the PJ from riding up in the night.
4.0,"I really like the hat. I'm considering buying a larger size for myself. A size Small fit my daughter, so maybe I wear a Large. I'm a petite woman though, so I'm just not sure. I wish sizing information was included for the actual hat rather than Amazon hats in general."
4.0,"I. Love. This. Shirt.<br /><br />It’s comfy as hell, enough to sleep or lounge in. Super flattering fit and I also wear it outside the house. I love it so much I’ll probably end up buying another color. Hubs loves it too. ONLY complaint is the army green is brown. Like, I almost returned it before I tried it on because it’s so bad. But, it’s still cute on and does have a green ‘tone’ in a well lit area. Took off a star for color misrepresentation but other than that, great shirt!"
4.0,"The dress is very comfortable, and it is all cotton, soft cotton.  I really like it, but the price was too high.  I only did it because I find it almost impossible to order cotton dresses that are actually cotton.  I got tired of having to return dresses from China who claimed to be all cotton or all linen and turned out to be polyester etc.<br /><br />So while I do like this dress and love how it feels on my skin, and cool in the hot humid summers of New Orleans, where nothing else works but cotton, I gave it only four stars because it was overprized.  It shouldn't cost fifty bucks for such a simple cut, it should be under 20.  Because I don't really believe that the extra money is going to the people who sewed the dress in Peru.  What agency controls claims of ""fair trade"" and at what point does something become fair trade?  If the seamstress got better wages, I'd give it five stars."
4.0,"I purchased the Khaki & White, small. The fabric felt a bit odd, but I wore it the day I got it. The size fit perfect, it looked a bit large but then once I put it on it fit me fine. It also arrived sooner than expected which was great!!"
4.0,Feet are okay with these
4.0,I’m usually a med and this med was a bit large on me. The material was light and comfortable.
4.0,"Well, I knew that this product would not meet all my expectations due to the price, I just was not sure where it would fall short. I was interested in a covering for my deck but didn't want to break the bank. At this point, the only real issue I have is the thinness and POOR stitching of the umbrella material. I could notice the CHEAPNESS right out of the box. The other minor issues is that the directions were not included so I had to figure it out my self. Now, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out, but it would have been nice to have instructions.  The umbrella sways in the wind which can be a little aggravating. I haven't used the netting so I have no input for that. The umbrella has a 12 month warranty which I'm sure will come in handy because I don't think this thing would weather any storm.  With that being said, I am very mindful to let the umbrella down at the sign of storms or a very windy day, otherwise  I know it would be torn to pieces. And even with that, I'm afraid that with the constant opening and closing  the fabric may end up tearing because the fabric is so thin and the tension that has to be put on the fabric when opening it up will end up tearing it...Anyway, you get what you pay for. It's holding up fine for now..."
4.0,I truly enjoyed how comfortable they made me wearing my longer faux locs as well as beautiful finish only issues is one of my caps ripped I can no longer wear them.
4.0,Really big crystal
4.0,"The card with the name of the company selling the product is not appealing as far as gifting goes.  The necklace is pretty and perfect for the occasion - added bonus, gift bag and card.  Smaller than I thought, but perhaps better this size."
4.0,Solid shirt. As advertised.
4.0,This hoody is comfy but is thinner than I expected.
4.0,Nice and light weight but seems to run a little small.
4.0,Im making a dress for my daughter and was worried it actually might be to big but it came quicker than expected and was exactly what i wanted.
4.0,For the price it's ok
4.0,"Very pretty necklace with really nice colors, but doesn't lay flat so I get poked with the triangle points."
4.0,I do not wear flip flops. I am large physical man and flips flops are a  bad look and unsafe. These are my &#34;shower shoes&#34;. I wear them in the public shower and the walk to the pool. I swim 3 times a week. These shoes fit into my bag and I am good to go. They work well when my feet are wet. They are a good product if used as a shower shoe.
4.0,Great weight and quality!
4.0,I followed instructions and ordered a 3x everything fits like a dream except my chest.<br />I am still coming to terms with what's left over from breastfeeding and I'm a 38B now... I tried to tie the knot in the middle a little better but it just doesn't fit my boobs. I love this suit but my boobs don't.
4.0,"Great cozy sweater for the money. I’m 5’8 and 150 pounds, I ordered xxl and it fits great. But definitely order two sizes up. Also the white color is more cream then white."
4.0,I followed the advice is past reviews and got a much larger size but it's cute! It's see through but not to the extent that you can't wear it comfortably. For the price I'm content for the most part. I wore it with a long shaw over and it was great!
4.0,Can't see well out of it.  Looks great.
4.0,Not as long as I thought it would be but it’s worth the money! Can’t wait to use it this summer!
4.0,"They look good but quality isn't as great. I got them on a Daily Deal so they cost me around $10. For that price, they're alright."
4.0,Chain a bit short and fragile looking but hey the price point is low and it was a hit!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:62d87bc3d5861667cacd0fffa86afac2]] Love these! The only sad part was one of the charms was put on backwards so I had to fix it, but other than that I absolutely LOVE them & wore them out and got tons of compliments! Highly recommend."
4.0,"I actually like the way this fit. The only reason for the rating is because, after first wash the material already had "" fufu's"". ( Piling)"
4.0,"This top is quite pretty. Needed a bit of pressing to get the fold marks out, washing didn't do it. It does actually have the chiffon layer on the front and back."
4.0,"My boyfriend joked that these leggings made me look like Kilmonger when I first got them but after a quick spin he was a fan. The leggings have quite a high rise with some slight compression. I ordered the black, and they are squat proof confirmed. I really like this brand overall and will continue to order from them - great dupe and even better than some other brands. We’ll see how they last over time but so far with a fair bit of use and washing they’re holding up."
4.0,"Fit well, was quite comfortable."
4.0,"These were for my 10 year old daughter and the only complaint is that the bottom of the shorts are too loose. I guess its ok cause they don’t bother her but they do bother me because then she pulls the shorts all the way to the top to supposedly act like a “geek.” I guess if she’s happy then they are ok with me, they are just pjs."
4.0,Good quality. No flexibility.
4.0,Let’s call this a mini Star of David. It’s quite dainty with simple lines and a lightweight silver chain.
4.0,daughter loved the way it hangs and the colors. Very nice and would tell others to get it too. price was right
4.0,Cute and comfortable! Love the fit in the foot area.
4.0,I liked it but thought it was bigger.....just the same it is a fun piece to wear
4.0,"Bought as gift, person loves it."
4.0,"Just to big for my wrist, guess I read size wrong."
4.0,I love the face of the watch.  Would have liked it to be a tad larger as there isn't much presence on the arm.  Overall a very nice watch if you need something petite.
4.0,The earrings are beautiful however they twist easily so I had to keep making sure they weren't twisted because I was taking lots of pics for a wedding
4.0,"I'm rating it 4 stars for improper packaging. The box was marked the correctly, but the belt inside was at least 6&#34; too short for the size. I had to return it. It's a beautiful belt and appears to be very sturdy. Also extremely stylish. If it had been the right size, I would have kept it and be wearing it right now."
4.0,Cute white dress. Perfect for my rehearsal dinner.
4.0,"Original review for 3 stars:<br />I will start this by saying I haven't worn them outside yet, so if they're actually super warm I'll add a star.<br /><br />Initial reaction though.... The stitching was shoddy, there was a ton of stray strings hanging out near the crotch and butt lines. The tag was off already and just fell out of the bag with the pants (was this a previous return?) and there is some random white stitching on the butt that doesn't match with the black stitching, just about 3 stitches which is odd.<br /><br />I put them on, and the fit is incredibly weird. For record, I am 5'7"" and 115lbs with a 34 inch inseam and I got the xs. These were super high waisted, almost to my bra line, but the crotch was insanely dropped. The pants came well above my ankles, which I am used to when I buy generic brands because I have long legs. I'd say short people would love these but I'd be afraid the dropped crotch would be to their knees 😂 overall they fit loose so I will probably wear them over some already tight leggings for additional warmth since I am in Maine.<br /><br />Not the quality I was expecting based on other reviews, but cheap enough where I am going to test it out and see how warm they are, because I need some warm clothes right now.<br /><br />UPDATE: these are WARM. Adding a star. I wore them first in 20F weather alone and was toasty in them. Then this morning the real feel was - 11F below zero and I wore them over some thin UA leggings, and I was still nice and warm. Then later tonight after the storm, my dog wanted to play in the snow drifts.. I waded through thigh high snow and my legs stayed surprisingly dry and warm the whole time thanks to the sherpa! Would recommend.<br /><br />I have also already put them through the wash and dryer and they have held up nicely there as well.<br /><br />Tl;Dr they fit awkward and crafted poorly but are super warm and do the job.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: I wear these so often since I'm constantly out in freezing and windy temps for long periods of time, so I decided to order another pair. This time I got the ""fashion"" ones because I was curious to see the difference. Updating my review for anyone who is also wondering. The fashion ones are tighter with zero give, the ones with the big white patch are much more stretchy. The fashion ones do not have the high waist, surprisingly, but the low waist is kind of awkward and I felt myself constantly pulling it up. They are the same awkward shortness as the originals. Overall between the 2 I'd say go with the ones that have the big white patch, they are more comfy."
4.0,"I would have given this five stars but the handles are thin, cheap wood. I covered them with a rope like fabric and it looks so much better."
4.0,My grandson loved this for his Christmas tree top.  It went very well with the soccer ornaments on his tree.
4.0,"I mostly got this for the gold and black choker. When it got here I had to poke a hole through the leather to make it fit. I'm fine with that, but I know some people wouldn't be, so uhh... Tread lightly???"
4.0,Great Shirt. Fits well. Love the pattern
4.0,"This was really cute, but the arm holes were pretty tight, as was the neck. The middle part is not as see through as the model. Cute dress but wasn’t quite right for me."
4.0,I like them  ... the only drawback is it is very hard to close the clasp yourself
4.0,"Nice and worth the price, but the floor is solid"
4.0,fits a little smaller than normal shirts
4.0,"Ease if wearing, but needed a little embellishment."
4.0,"I love these pants. I'll start off with my one and only complaint. As with anything that has exterior pockets, the pockets need to be ironed after each wash and get a little extra attention, otherwise they fold into strange shapes. Otherwise these are very breathable, comfortable, and they have just enough extra room at the bottom to accommodate my steel toe work boots. I love having all of the extra pockets and the clip on the back for keys or tools is great too."
4.0,Gorgeous piece.  Wish the rope ends were shorter or at least easily adjustable. The dangling ends may drive me batty.
4.0,"You will need a thick slip with this. It is well made of quality fabric, but the white background makes it too sheer in sunlight.  It falls at the knee.  A tulle slip under it would make it far too short for someone of average height, due to the fullness. And beware of windy days. The skirt is very full."
4.0,Fit nicely and love the pockets.
4.0,"loved the look, but they were super loose on my face, and my face is pretty round."
4.0,"aside from looking good, the jacket was comfortable and keeps me warm"
4.0,"Apparently sulfa allergies are very common. When I saw this I thought it would be a good idea to have on my bracelet. A little sticky and hard to open, but with my tool I got it open."
4.0,Bought mine a couple of years ago and these things are STILL tough. I love them!!
4.0,"My son jokes that these are his prison pajamas because of the striped pattern. They fit him well and they are comfortable. They're not quite as tight-fitting as some other pajamas can be, which is nice. They have held up well to multiple washes."
4.0,A nice looking bracelet for a good price.
4.0,"I know, they are not Oakley's... I really wasn't expecting it... they just did not fit me well, but not every pair of glasses will. Took a chance and it didn't pan out. Good glasses, well made.<br /><br />I ended up giving these to my next door neighbor for when he uses his chainsaw and he loves them."
4.0,More like a boys large
4.0,"The socks really make my legs feel great, but they are very hard for me to get on and off."
4.0,I like the colors and like the blend
4.0,The only complaint I have is that I wish they were wider. Overall it did its job.
4.0,"this sweater is so soft and comfortable! it feels like a great quality sweater. it has the perfect slouchy arms, and it’s a beautiful true white. I got a size large to make it a more oversized fit, but it ended up being smaller than I anticipated (for reference, I am 5’8” and 135lbs). when I raised my arms above my head, the sweater came up quite a bit. I’d probably size up 1 or 2 sizes depending on how you want it to fit."
4.0,I bought a 7-8 because I wear a size 7 shoe. They are a bit too snug; pretty sure the next size up would be too big.  They are comfortable if I flatten the heel and wear as a scuff.  Wash well and the sole is comfy.  They are adorable and make me smile.
4.0,"Great glasses, especially love the mirrors. They do scratch a bit easily, I actually had two pairs before and scratched both, loved them enough to rebuy though, so I got these. (Last set were blue lenses and gold lenses)"
4.0,Nice price and they worked great underwater with no leaking
4.0,"Very thin but this is still good for my use. Just FYI, I am a size 12 1/2 and I have a hard boot cast from foot surgery and I was looking for something to cover the entire cast to keep out sand and rain during a trip to Belize next week."
4.0,Nice. Wish it was bigger.
4.0,My daughter is a very slim 2 1/2 year old and I expected that it would have been looser. It fits perfectly now but she'll probably grow out of it soon.
4.0,"The bill is too long for my liking, but still cute"
4.0,"Everybody loves a man in red glasses. Durable, elegant and light. Excellent purchase."
4.0,Love these Jean's
4.0,I love this dress but too snug. Other dresses by this designer fit fine but this one not so.
4.0,my reports that they work good for him playing baseball.
4.0,some what short for my legs but they are comfortable to wear. They don't quite reach my knees but I do have large calves
4.0,"5’6, 155-160, 36DDD- Ordered M. Fits really well. Wish the fabric was a bit thicker but it is super soft, like a super thin hoodie. Shows ever single oz of cellulite one has. Color is true and super vibrant."
4.0,I loved the way the dress looked and the material felt nice. I gave the dress 4 stars because I believe it ran a little small for the US size chart. Shipping was immediate.
4.0,Very plunging neckline!
4.0,Very cute! On my bag looks great)
4.0,Item came on time.<br />Item arrived as pictured.<br />My brother loved it.<br />Will definitely purchase from this vendor again soon.
4.0,Super cute dress and the fabric was thick! Just didn’t look as good on me as I was hoping.
4.0,"My 9 year old daughter bought this because she's in a wolf loving phase. The tail is very large and thick.  It attaches with a ribbon around your waist.  The ears look fine, but the attachment is just a springy metal clip that relies solely on friction.  It doean't snap shut.  We couldn't get the ears to stay on her head, so she just wears the tail."
4.0,A litter small
4.0,"Fits great but could definitely use more reflectivity. I'm a big fan of their running shorts, but this is a little off. This is more of a wind-breaker than a cycling jacket. I kind of feel like it's more for a casual rider than a cyclist. Not snug at all but definitely good for those cooler mornings."
4.0,"Materials is on the &#34;thin and cheap&#34; side, but otherwise item is as expected"
4.0,Fits really well. My son loves it!. The zipper sticks a little when first put on.
4.0,Very comfortable. Provides good support. My new favorite undies.
4.0,"One of the socks had a hole right out of the box, however they immediately sent me replacement socks.<br />All of them seem really good quality this time.<br />I appreciate their customer care level. Thank you!"
4.0,"Looks and feels great. Can handle credit cards, drivers license and passport as well as money."
4.0,Great color and was as described .
4.0,runs big... but good quality
4.0,"I like this dress a lot.  The grey color with white stripes is flattering, and gives the image of elongating the figure.  The bottom part of the dress is cut somewhat skimpy so it's not loose and flowy, but rather a little away from the body.  It's long, to the floor for me (I'm 5'3&#34;), so I had to hem it quite a bit.  But I like it, and the material is nice enough to wear to work with some jewelry.  For the price, one can't complain!"
4.0,"great suit, just need the body to match :)"
4.0,Super cute! Good quality! I bought a Medium and it came as a small. Bought a second thinking maybe they just sent the wrong size but the second medium said small on the tag too.
4.0,"The girl in the picture must have HUGE shoulders, because this thing hangs off of mine and I'm not an unusually sized person.  I love the style and this is a much better price than the $30 at my local boutique for the same item.  One of the chains on the back was broken when I got it, I am going to try to fix it."
4.0,Bought this as a shower gift for my daughter.  Thinking a January birthday.. I bought 0-3. He is now 2.5 months old and it is still way too big on him. Thinking it may have been marked wrong.  He is 24 inches tall now and still has almost 3inches til his hands come out of the sleeves.
4.0,"Fits perfect, so stretchy they could be pull-ons."
4.0,The dress is a super soft and durable fabric. My only complaint is that the pattern is kind of blurry. It's not something you notice from far back but up close you can tell it's not as sharp as it could/should be.
4.0,"Depending on what your looking for, this is a very nice case.  It is very stiff and does not fit well in a pocket or purse.  But if you are looking for something to protect your glasses in a tote or backpack, I would highly recommend this one."
4.0,"The sizing is good overall, however it's extremely tight around the hips and waist. For bigger people I'd recommend a size up."
4.0,Pretty good quality for the money!!  Comfortable despite the fact that it is the same design all the way around.  Worth the $20.00.
4.0,Good variety but I can tell they are cheap and will rust easy and probably fall apart. But you get what you pay for!
4.0,As described but did look a bit bigger.
4.0,I really liked the color and soft flowing fabric but even with the care I took to make sure the sizing was right it still didn't fit.  Back it went.
4.0,Wife bought it for our daughter so they can have a matching outfit buying clothes from Amazon is not that bad actually
4.0,Love the material and all of the pockets. Very well-made just runs too small. Definitely order a size up.
4.0,"This is a beautiful high-end looking sweater; although the bright and colorful pattern isn't for everyone.  It's not quite thick enough to be a proper outer layer, but the hemmed seams and zip/high collar make it such that it would be hard to layer much above this beyond an overcoat. The wool blend still feels a little bit itchy on sensitive skin; it's not quite as soft as ultra fine alpaca or cashmere. It also is fairly fragile, so wearing it in select settings is recommended. Ie: this is not for outdoor adventuring per say. If using it as an outer layer you'll also find yourself wishing it had some pockets so you could keep your hands warm, or at the very least thumb holes on longer sleeves."
4.0,Quality ok for price. Extra thin material.. overall fits comfy and bit on the long side as far as pants length you will definitely need heels. Also the belt that came with it was cheap. The belt broke after first time worn
4.0,"Bright colors, several cool designs, well made---this is a good value. Packs of 5 pair make it easy to mix and match. Makes a great gift."
4.0,"This is a very flattering tunic.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the material is very thin (I choose to wear a tank underneath).  With some jewelry and nice dress pants, it is suitable for the office."
4.0,"Band works as advertised.  My 42mm IWatch fits perfectly, and there's no chance it will fall out of this band.  Now I will admit I did say a few bad works when I installed it into the band the first time, (tight fit), but think it was worth it.  Hey, compared to the band these watches come with; you got now where to go but up.  Highly recommend this band."
4.0,So many complements on the dress but it runs a bit larger than expected.
4.0,Super cute the top is a little short for me but only bc I wear a DDD. Also more blue than purple
4.0,"The overall quality of this product is very nice. The cotton is soft and washes well and it is cute. I also really appreciate that it is organic material because I care about that.<br />With that being said, I am not happy with the way the mittens fit. The elastic isn't tight enough so they fell off of the baby's hands immediately. The booties, onesie were all great, but the gloves were definitely not what I was hoping for.<br />Overall, this is a really great value because the material is high quality and everything is so well-made, however, the gloves do not fit as expected.<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced price for a fair and honest review"
4.0,"Really cute dress and decent quality for the price.  But a little bit short and a bit too backside clingy for work - I am 5'4&#34;, 128 lbs and ordered a M (but I'm not boy slim - have a few curves.  Cute enough to reorder in L."
4.0,I wasn’t sure how this would fit so I ordered the XXL because even a really big hoodie is still cozy and comfy! ☺️<br />This XXL is SMALLER than my Gildan XL<br />It fits at a size I’d call large.<br /><br />The inside is warm and fuzzy while the outside is more soft and smooth. It’s very well made.
4.0,"This necklace arrived quickly and came undamaged. It is just absolutely gorgeous, a real stunner. it is lightweight and comfortable. My only issue is that some of the pieces don't lie flat, needing constant readjustment which gets to be a pain in the butt after a while. however a good piece for a steal of a deal."
4.0,"I used them for my wedding day I loved them! However they were big, since having my daughter I wear a size 8 in women's that only only reason I didn't give all 5 stars."
4.0,Very nice pants that are not see-through at all.  They do seem to run a bit large.  I love the pattern.
4.0,A bit larger and longer than expected!
4.0,"Love the dress, looks great on. I usually wear between a 4-6 depending on how the sizes run but based on other reviews I ordered an 8. I'm happy that I went with this size, I think a 6 might have been a little snug"
4.0,"quality necklace and pendant, as seen in photos"
4.0,Exactly as described. Thanks
4.0,"My grandchild was cramming their feet into child size 9 sneakers last week, and since we're finally getting past sandal weather, I found these. They came fully a day before expected. The child is thrilled with the shoes. They are easy to put on, and the size 12 is just right, a little toe room. I have no idea how well they will wear, but I expect he'll wear them out pretty quickly, or else grow out of them. The child loves red and is obsessed with Sonic the Hedgehog, so these shoes with the addition of a white stripe will finish the Halloween costume. I am told they are comfy."
4.0,Love it! Though the necklace feels a little thin.
4.0,"Let me start by saying it is definitely a very soft and comfortable top but it's larger than I expected.  With the bagginess, I look frumpy in it. Also, the neckline is much higher and the sleeves are longer than I thought it'd be based on the picture advertised.  I expected to shirt to be on the looser side but not make me look so frumpy. If you order a size smaller than your typical, I think you'd be better off."
4.0,"Well made, work perfectly for my 4yo and 8yo"
4.0,For $55 bucks you get a great pair of glasses and very good plastic lenses
4.0,"Love these shoes, order a size larger."
4.0,"These pants run a bit smaller so you might want to go up a size, I really like the warmth of the pants however HATE the pockets, I like that they have pockets but these are made from the same material as the pants so they are twice as thick and they sit on the front of your thigh it feels weird to have that bulky of a pocket as well as to have it on the front.<br />But they are warm and once, if you can ignore the pockets they are good warm pants"
4.0,"First time I washed it, it shrank way up! I’ve pulled and stretched it out a little bit but I think it’s still smaller than it was. Beware, it looked like a shirt when I pulled it out of the washer! Hope it still works."
4.0,Missing clippers
4.0,I good value for money. Somewhat lighter weight than I thought fleece (vs knit) would be.  Fit well.
4.0,"I bought these for my husband. He loves them, says they are very comfortable though initially they were a little tight. I believe he likes them better than his last pair of slippers since he never seems to take these off. I just hope they last a while since he is usually rough on slippers."
4.0,"Did come in with a tiny little hole that was easily fixed. Fits according to the size chart. Biggest issue is the leg covers. It seems I got sent one that fits perfectly while the other is nearly twice the size. I got them to work anyway by wearing boots that go up to my knee. I stretched the one out putting it over the boot, but the other one for over the boot without having to stretch it at all. Originally gave it 5 stars, but I hadn’t tried the leg covers yet. Only reason for 4 stars is because of that. For a Halloween costume, it’s definitely a lot better made than a lot of the ones out there."
4.0,It's very stylish and it looks exactly how it's advertised.
4.0,Great fun for the 13 year old it was purchased for.
4.0,"Dress if very flattering....Hugs curves nicely. Has a lot of stretch to the point some areas may be distorted and appear to be white,. No need for shape wear under this baby."
4.0,Not as thick of an insole as I expected but I actually prefer this thinner material now as I don’t like to have my foot too cramped in my boot.
4.0,"These shorts are so comfy and cute, and the color is exactly as pictured. I’d say they’re a bit big but perfect if you plan to wear them high waisted and the draw string gives you that nice tight waist but flowy bottom feeling. For reference, I’m 5”6, 150lbs and I bought the xl. Could have probably ordered the l but they still fit nice with the draw string waist."
4.0,"These are ok. They're not as warm as I wanted...but they fit perfectly on this 5'3"",140lb body. And I can't see through them while wearing them."
4.0,Googles look and fit amazing worth the money. Bought 2 pair to go Airsoft it with my sons. Noticed that one had a black bag to store everything in.  Mine didn’t. Both the same. Not real happy about that.
4.0,"The ring is so beautiful, the only issue I have with it is it sticks out and gets caught on things often."
4.0,"This messy bun beanie hat is so SOFT!  It really feels good on my head.  I don't have big hair but I can certainly see how those with big hair, buns, top ponytails and other big hair styles would like this hat.  I still will wear it anyway just because it's so comfy. The visor helps block bright sun light and I can see myself wearing it this winter on the tennis court.  It's very well knitted, soft, stretchy and a lovely shade of pink."
4.0,"I bought this in 3 colors. Not too baggy but relaxed. Love the fabric for hot days, wish linen didn't wrinkle so easily."
4.0,"Cute dress with a beautiful color.  Fit me perfectly I'll go it was a bit longer than I expected. I am 5'4&#34; and it falls  about 2 inches below my knee caps.  I personally prefer dresses that fall at or slightly above the knee, however the length does fit with the 1950s period style.<br /><br /> The material is a heavier weight, slightly stretchy twill  that holds shape well without feeling confining.  It would be hot for summer wear however.<br /><br />Color is beautiful and construction is good. The arm holes do not gap or hang strangely.<br /><br /> All in all this is a very nice dress that I look forward to wearing."
4.0,"It was a nice dress.  I loved the pattern and the fit, however I didn't like the cut on the hem.  That was just a personal preference.  It was a pretty dress, just didn't look good on me."
4.0,"The cut of the deathly hallows sign isn't as clean as it is in the picture, otherwise, it's great!"
4.0,"A really attractive item and really liked.  However, the manufacturer could take better care to ensure that the threading for the end caps index properly at the 12 o'clock and/or 6 o'clock position.  Seems to not lay entirely flat due to where the threads tighten securely."
4.0,"great dress for 3 nights..meaning its soo memorable u can only wear it 3 times over 7 years..also it snags on anything so don't wear any bangle bracelets or a purse that can get caught on i3t..outside of that, you'll love it!!"
4.0,My daughter has senstive ears and these have worked great for her.
4.0,"Decent shirt, but it was a bit large for me."
4.0,"I received this item 2 days ago and was immediately surprised when I saw it. The colour of the band was a lot brighter than displayed in the picture, however, it was still stylish and contemporary. My teenaged daughter promptly claimed it as it is very youthful and vibrant. It can be worn with any colour and makes a statement because it does have an unusual band!"
4.0,"I got the white, and the top is completely see-through. I really like the fit, but I hate troubleshooting see-through summer clothing. I’m tempted to return it bc I hate extra layers in the summer.... But it’s actually really cute and flattering."
4.0,This is a cute jacket. Fit is true to size. It’s not super fuzzy (I was expecting like a fleece) but it’s has almost like a jersey lining which makes the inside comfy. The extra lining actually makes it kinda warm too.
4.0,"Lets start with due to the fact that this ring has no texture, pores, or inclusions Im unsure if its actually jade, but I really dont care since its so pretty on my finger. Its very smooth & easy to put on. I will wear it daily until I lose it or it breaks. Its a moss green with some lighter spots & it has swirls or lines in it."
4.0,Good leather belt ran a little small
4.0,This makes an impressive gift!  The chain comes in a mahogany box that has a small light that goes on when it's opened so that the recipient can read the card nested in the box with the chain.
4.0,This is a great dress for formal or casual events. It is very soft and comfortable to wear. The zipper is a challenge to get all the way up if you are by yourself. You will need help or a plan to get this on by yourself. I am 5&#34;2 and the dress came down alittle past my knees. I also am very curvy and order the x-large and it fit perfectly. Very comfortable and quality dress. I received this product at a reduced rate for my honest opionion. All comment are 100% my use and knowledge of the product
4.0,"These headbands are adorable and very affordable but they run really big. I got them for my newborn, they are over an inch too big. They are even too big for my 3 year old. I've had to adjust them to fit my girls."
4.0,A pesar del precio muy accesible la calidad es muy buena
4.0,Not too bad. They leak a little sometimes and they fog up bad but they work. And thats all i really wanted..goggles that work lol
4.0,very see thru. otherwise cute
4.0,"The top fit perfectly but the bottoms were kinda big so if youve got small hips just get a size down, the top is stretchy enough that it wont be a problem"
4.0,"Not the best quality for the price, but it will do. I've bought previous diamond nose studs from another seller that was much better quality and clearer diamond for the same price. Unfortunately they were no longer on Amazon. This diamond is cloudy and the prongs are not laid flat down and catch on a lot of stuff."
4.0,I liked the color and the way it hangs on my body. Looks great with knee high boots.
4.0,"Nice bracelets, my husband and son like them.  They wear them daily."
4.0,They are comfortable but they gap at the waist
4.0,Very nice leather purse for the cost. A bit smaller than I had hoped for but large enough to fit everything I need.
4.0,"looks great, was off about a size. is beautiful though"
4.0,Love my purse but there was a pretty deep scratch in it as if someone cut the box open to deep or something .... if I was not in desperate need for it I would have sent it back for a new one
4.0,Thinner than I thought but great top!
4.0,"I like the glasses.  The two piece case tends to come apart in the pocket.  Lost the top piece on one. Other than that, the glasses work fine."
4.0,"Loved that I could get these in different colors for summer wear.Cute ,inexpensice necklace.I only gave it a four because it took awhile to get here"
4.0,Cute simple..nice.. clasp little flimsy but its wrks..
4.0,[[VIDEOID:5103d5c77a65cc2e0721b3d1bffb2934]]
4.0,It is a little longer than you would think and needed to put it on a different chain but ok fun piece
4.0,"I originally ordered a XL thinking it would fit but it was way too small so I went to a 3XL. The cups are very small but there is enough coverage so I’m ok with the fit. For reference I am 38D with a 33” waist. The bodice is a little loose but I will have a dress underneath, I could not have gone smaller in the bust. I like that the straps have elastic, they are not too tight. The back has a lace up feature so you can customize your fit a little more. This is for my Sarah Sanderson Hocus Pocus costume for Halloween. I may post a picture in full costume."
4.0,Good quality and i liked the finish.
4.0,"It's very pretty, but once you hold it you know it's very delicate fabric! The back of the OBI doesn't tie together but has white fasteners which is a drawback. The only complaint I would have is that it's length is very short on the sleeves and on the body. I'm only 5'4&#34; and the length stops at just under my belly button, and I expected it to at least cover the cute g-string it came with. The sleeves come to almost my wrists if I don't drape the Kimono off of my shoulders. I really do like it as it looks really cute on me, but anyone taller than me may feel like they're getting a half shirt Kimono."
4.0,"Exactly as pictured.  Sufficient for Halloween, but not durable enough for frequent dress-up usage"
4.0,I was very happy with this than my expectation. but I want ask to seller staffs for little more detail Quality Check before shipping. Nice and good quality and very light weight but one side of clasp was worng. Slightly short so can't close completely. I try to fix to use instead to return though. Well. Except that was perfect for me though.
4.0,Really compact  wife loves it  holds her stuff cards IDs and her credit cards blocks chip theft.
4.0,"Beautiful dress. I love the fabric and feminine cut. It was a little larger than anticipated, but that's perfect for me because I like my dresses a little loose. Love the criss cross back with cut out back. Very nice."
4.0,Fits well and holds up my britches!
4.0,"These are terrific for wearing with my Skechers slip-ons without showing. The only thing is, they slide off the heel pretty easily, which then makes for uncomfortable walking until an opportunity arises to remove the shoe and readjust the sock."
4.0,It is a gift for Valentines
4.0,"This is a bit short for a dress, so I wear this as a top with crop leggings. Fits as expected. Blue is pretty; the red is very orangey. The elastic around the neckline is comfortable, though a bit unevenly stitched.  Still a cute top."
4.0,Real comfortable to wear amd washes well.
4.0,The are comfortable and work well enough.
4.0,"Considering the price for these, I thought they couldn't possibly be very nice but they actually look really good. They are a little loose on an average wrist. The main connection ends are not high quality materials but once I closed the rings more, I have worn these many times already and do really like them. For the money, totally worth it."
4.0,I love this belt. i had to buy another one because a friend asked for the first one I purchased.
4.0,Fit great but very long. Only negative I have is the back pockets are kinda small.
4.0,"I am a commuter and recently got into gravel riding (not mountain biking, not cx biking, but think hiking on bike) in Seattle. I spend $50+ every year on &#34;waterproof&#34; booties that aren't quite waterproof from the bottom of shoes and tear easily. I finally had epiphany that purchasing winter boots would make more economical sense and healthy choice (my toes will be happier).<br />FIT:<br />Here is information I would have liked to see when I was deciding on size. Let's forget about men/women size because I am just following the Euro sizing. I have owned LG and Specialized MTB SPD shoes in size 37. If Shimano or Pearl Izumi, 38 as I consider the brands run smaller. So, I went with 37 of this LG winter boot pair. I find them to be very comparable sizing between summer/regular LG shoes and the winter boot sizing. HOWEVER, if you ride in below-freezing temp all the time and want to wear thicker socks and/or stick the hot toes, you should order one size bigger for sure. The shoes are very warm (when I tried them on indoor upon receipt), so if you are like me to wear regular riding socks, you should go with the same size as summer biking shoe size.<br />DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION:<br />The very outside fabric reminds me of triathlon wetsuit material. That means, don't use your finger nails to pull it up or you will make holes. Middle layer is shut with zipper and waterproof seal. If I can complain one thing about the design, it's the length of &#34;tongue&#34; of the actual shoe in the very inside layer.  A longer tongue would have made putting on the shoes a lot easier. Toe box seems to be more generous than other bike shoes I have owned. But, overall, I like the snag fit of it.<br />PERFORMANCE:<br />I just received them in the mail yesterday, so I haven't tried them out yet. I hope to get out and use them soon. My hope is that I can accidentally put my feet down in the puddle of water, but it doesn't allow water to seep up from bottom. Let's see how well they do!"
4.0,Decent! Looks as shown
4.0,Good quality overall. They run large though. Too big for me. I will have to get them taken in at a tailor because returning is not an option.
4.0,"It fits great but shiner than I thought. Perfect length for church, party or night out with hubby!"
4.0,"I must say, I always buy my watches from Fossile, but I needed the color band that I found on this watch. When I got it, I was sure it would not be as nice as the maker that I usually use. Wow, was I surprised-I love this watch! Well made and great looking! I would buy it again."
4.0,"I tried to size it the best I could because my weight fluctuates. It fit well, but there's not a lot of stretch to the bottoms in the band. It looks great on. I bought it for my five year anniversary and my husband loved it."
4.0,Very nice quality but very big and long for a large
4.0,"Nice watch winder, and I would give it five stars except that after the first week of use, it started to squeak slightly when it turns.  Not sure why as it was totally silent initially."
4.0,I like the style but the size is way too small. I usually wear size 2 but the size 4 was still too small to even zip the back.  I would recommend to 4 size up.
4.0,"Nice socks. Kind of thin, would like to see more color/pattern schemes for dark/neutral suits"
4.0,"Beautiful shirt, I love it but it fit somewhat smaller than expected."
4.0,Fit & quality is very good.
4.0,Covering my face very well very comfortable
4.0,Smaller than what I  thought they would be. But still very cute.
4.0,"Great looking durable beach bag...no flexible...it makes it thru security as a carry on luggage. Washable, I can fit a lot in it. But hard to stuff under a chair or carry...The large one is way too large unless you are putting it in the back of a car and heading to beach....Not for lugging around...it's so wide that you can't walk by people easily and too big to throw over shoulder. A bit impractical. Wish I bought the smaller one."
4.0,Would have liked it to be a little more fluffy. Nice scarf 🧣
4.0,Nice size and weight
4.0,I love these! They are super cute and comfy too. Only thing is I did not realize they were a little thin and was grocery shopping with my boyfriend and he pointed out that he could see my underwear.. by singing the thong song to me lol
4.0,"Wore this at the riding school to up-tack the horse.  Was perfect.  Cute, warm & comfortable."
4.0,Glad I got an XXL usualy I am a large for XL.  This is pretty small.  Overall good.
4.0,"When I first pulled these out of the package, I thought they would be way too small! The waist seemed so tiny. And it is. But it stretched easily over my big butt and stomach, and they are currently my favorite pair of leggings! Not see-though, plenty of stretch, and POCKETS!! I like how high-waisted they are too, but the top does roll down a bit when I sit. Not the end of the world, but a tad uncomfortable. I usually have a hard time with sizing, because I'm what I like to call &quot;chubby petite.&quot; I'm 5'3, 137lbs, for reference. Too petite to be a medium usually, but too chubby to be a small. I ordered a small and they fit as well as could be expected. Very pleased."
4.0,Very nice. Chain could have been better not a fan of the box chain. It was a gift and she loved it.
4.0,Wish I had got it in dark denim BUT still cute !
4.0,"Nice sandles, I think they run a little small."
4.0,That is not a bear. It's a red panda.
4.0,"Excellent article, it was much more than I expected"
4.0,"Everything was great and the dress is nice, only issue I have is its to short on me I’m 5’9” and it barley covers my butt. Other than that I would of rated it a 5 star"
4.0,This is a very nice wool cape. I gave it only 4 stars because compared to others I have purchased the material is very thin.
4.0,Horns arrived 2 months after purchase.  They are fine for the money I guess but if you are looking something that will arrive in a reasonable amount of time I would go with another product.
4.0,"The only thing keeping it from being a 5-start product (especially for the price) is the fact that it cannot be expanded.  I have a fairly thick wrist and it was snug on the wrist when I put it on.  Not too tight to wear, but I'd of loved to be able to adjust it out a little bit.<br /><br />Packaging was nice and the boxed it would make a nice gift.  The design is pretty uni-sexual but I think it is more a mans watch<br /><br />This item was made available free for review purposes."
4.0,"I wear a 12 so I ordered the XL as suggested, it was way too big. Sending back and going down to an L.. I hope it fits. Love the dress otherwise."
4.0,Great product - wonderful material very sturdy. A smidge snug but very doable
4.0,"This brand is my longtime brand and size. I usually bought them at Target, but they stopped sticking them do I took a chance and ordered these.<br />They pretty much looked the same but they fit a bit tighter. I washed them but did not put them in the dryer fearing shrinkage.<br />It worked well and they fit well enough not to return.<br />So be aware, they fit a bit on the tight side."
4.0,"I like this shirt. It has a belt that can wrap around you twice if you’re 6 ft, 240 lol<br />It has a flap in the that makes it look like a wrap skirt but it goes in back. Not sure of the point of that. It is long..to my ankles and has a nice heft to it..you can wear it with boots. Nice"
4.0,"The dress is nice, decent quality for the price. I do wish the arms were a little larger. Length is nice on me I'm 5'2 and it hits just above the knee."
4.0,Very high waisted but because of my height (5’2) Didn’t look as flattering
4.0,This make a statement.  Wearing for the first time and I notice that it fold up on side every now then but i still think it's a good statement for the price.
4.0,Sturdy and fun.  We had to pop out the lenses because they have a weird reflection that was giving my child a headache.
4.0,"The belt is fantastic; the leather is soft and it fits well. The tool provided could be better though, it's difficult to use."
4.0,"Not the material I was expecting,however, it fit perfectly"
4.0,"Looks great except it's not as good as the first one that I ordered before (from another manufacturer). The elastic headband is only one piece so whenever you put it on or off, you have to put it over your head...unlike the first one I have where it has a hook/unhook clip in the middle of the elastic band."
4.0,Lightweight.<br />I wear 7 1/2 and the 7 fits perfectly.
4.0,"We can't give food out at the kids' holiday parties at school, so I bought this set and was able to give them out to everyone while not killing my wallet. The kids have fun with them and sometimes use them as little reading lights."
4.0,I like how it looks but the bracelet loses color after a while.
4.0,Dosent block out all the blue light but you get what you paid for right it’s really good tho
4.0,"Very, very comfy.  Runs large, though."
4.0,The charms are good but I got two bags with the exact same designs. I was hoping for something different in the two bags. Not the exact same thing.
4.0,I love this! My husband bought it as a gift for me and it is stunning. It was a bit bigger than expected and I think a shorter chain would make it perfect. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the case was damaged when it was delivered l:
4.0,The beads are nice the teaser is very small!!
4.0,"Great glasses, fun & well made. They are very clear & make a gloomy day look much brighter. They are not dark, you could wear them indoors or in the dark & still be able to see clearly. I find the frames a little big on my face & heavy so they slide down my nose. You can also wear them when looking at phone or computer screens. The colors are suttle when looking through & calming. I feel they enhamce my vision. The price is right & the case is very sturdy. I just wish they were a little smaller or had little rubber pads to stop them from sliding down your face."
4.0,Ordered a large because of the reviews I read fits perfect. Love that it hides the belly part specially if you want to hide it after having kids lol. Good quality and it's cute !
4.0,Just received these an hour ago.  i was pleasantly surprised that most if not all the positive 4star reviews and up were true. I only gave it 4 stars because they have yet to do the endurance test. So far looking good and I love the hinge on them.
4.0,"The pants that arrived were a dark charcoal color, not the grey color that I thought I had ordered - they fit well though, so I'm keeping and wearing them."
4.0,"I love the top! Its very cute and sits right where i wanted. It feels a little loose and not very supportive so i guess i could have ordered a size smaller, but im not going through the hassle of sending it back. I normally wear an 18/20 so i ordered an 18. I love the way the shorts fit too. This will be great for lounging in a pool, but i may find something else for when i do any actual swimming. I recieved this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review"
4.0,I am 5 '4 110lbs and this reaches just to my upper thigh. Other companies charge much more for just one and some only reach just above the knee.  So I think it was  worth it for the price.
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress! Super affordable, it's a heavy fabric so you don't have to worry about your underwear showing through but it's still got good stretch. It is a little boxy because of the thickness of the fabric but it doesn't bother me. I got a size small and paired with with a black top underneath and I feel like a Bratz doll/Monster High/Clueless mash up!"
4.0,It's great for when I only have a little to take with me
4.0,Love the fabric - love the pockets - not as lightweight as I thought
4.0,great product for a small price.
4.0,was just what I needed
4.0,This cap looks good and has elastic back to provide good fit without dorky rear opening.
4.0,Mom likes them.  Provides additional traction on tile and wood flooring compared to traditional socks.
4.0,"I liked the style of the dress but its not fot women with large chest. Otherwise, pretty."
4.0,Loved the material but fits bigger than expected
4.0,What I expected. Looked like the pic.
4.0,"Great true leather bell.  I had to cut the length of it so it is a true leather belt and used permanent black marker to match color on the edge. The punch tool hole provided is great. My surprise was also the packaging the belt comes with, nice touch."
4.0,"UPDATE: The seller reached out and offered to send another bracelet, since the one I received was defective. Changed my rating to 4 stars.<br />I have other jewelry items from this line, and I like the quality. Unfortunately, this bracelet missed the mark. I liked the color, weight, and pattern on the gold links, but I'm not able to get this bracelet on. The clasp doesn't open enough to get around the ring attachment on the opposite side. I even tried opening the clasp with two hands, to no avail. Disappointed with the lack of quality control on this bracelet."
4.0,Love the shirt just a little too small though
4.0,"Nice looking sunglasses, excellent polarized protection.  However, there does seem to be a very almost unnoticed imperfection in the lens."
4.0,The support socks were as advertised.  They are comfortable and give great support.  They are not easy to put on or take off.  That is the price you pay for good support.
4.0,I have many wraps from shawls to capes where a closure would be helpful. This fits the bill perfectly.  Well made and apparently strong.  Only reason for 5 stars out of 5 is I have not used the product yet for any length of time.  I will update my review after wearing it a few times.
4.0,"This works perfectly for active wear, as well as for helping with COVID-19 related safety. The print is clean, the only thing that I wish was different is that there are cut marks at the end. I would like to have seen these ends tucked over and sewn."
4.0,Love the details on the flower. They may fit into 3 mos baby's head and up but not newborn's.
4.0,"The material was better than expected! I opted to order this one size larger than I would normally wear, and have it altered to frame my body like the picture shows. I have it taken in around the bodice and the sleeves, as well as have it shortened because it is definitely not sized for ladies that are shorter in stature. Overall, it was a good buy!"
4.0,Pretty good FAUX!
4.0,"Nice and warm! I liked the rust-rufous color too.<br /><br />Being designed like a jacket, with backing along the zipper, it hangs down nicely, i.e. isn't ""wavy"" along the zipper like a regular hoodie. But since this backing along the zipper isn't attached to lining (there is no lining), the backing strips just flap around when the garment is worn unzipped."
4.0,"When I received it, it was folded in a bag so it got wrinkled and it's dry clean only so you have to have it pressed before wearing if you don't want it all wrinkled."
4.0,"Fit as expected, does NOT come with a belt as pictured.  Looks a bit more &#34;frumpy&#34; on than pictured because the skirt  hangs a little flat."
4.0,Hat matches dress and shoes perfectly.
4.0,"These are very nice boots. They are sufficiently warm, and positively delightful when you add a nice pair of wool socks. They are also comfortable enough for me to wear all day - and I have very flat feet, so that is a rare quality in boots. They have held up to wear and tear, and I have received compliments about how they look.<br /><br />My only problem with them is the smell, which I already knew about from reading other reviews. The smell doesn't bother me overmuch, but other people have noticed it (&#34;Do you smell gasoline?&#34;) and that can be a little embarrassing. I tried leaving them to air out, but the smell is still there, though faint. This isn't enough to stop me from continuing to wear them, though."
4.0,"Do NOT purchase without proper measurements 😂😂 ... I would even go a size less than your normal. I went up 1, so a L instead of a M because of the cotton and the picture made it look like SUPER soft so that it would want to hug your curve ... not really, its boxy, first thing out of husband's mouth: could always be a night shirt 🤣 ... I'll attempt to shrink it because its cute - love the message."
4.0,"Cute summer backless dress , thin but sturdy fabric makes perfect for summer and just a little big not a huge deal easy fix tie up higher absolutely love the color and it’s vintage style look Overall happy with the purchase"
4.0,The frame seems nice but maybe take the lens information out of the discription since this frame doesn't come with any. Pretty misleading. I need these for work and now have to wait several days to get lenses delivered. Awesome.
4.0,"The socks appear to be a good quality, well-made sock. They are compression socks, and do a good job at that. There really is no appearant, to me at least, difference wearing these socks over regular socks."
4.0,"This was such a cute gift to give and can have lots of meaning, but the scanner for spotify barely reads the code. It has to be in perfect lighting and super clean."
4.0,"Fit well, just a little big on the sides"
4.0,Glad I ordered this band it's comfortable and easy to install. This is alot better than the average plastic bands.
4.0,Needed this dress for 1 of the theme parties on the cruise. Love the color
4.0,Comfortable and water resistant.  A good purchase for work. A good value.
4.0,Beautifully crafted just a bit bigger than I expected.
4.0,"Right and left socks add a cute novelty to my day,  which I enjoy. The font lettering is clear, clean, and adorable, covers the top toes right where the bend in your foot is located. These socks are not thick however; they are quite thin, so keep those pedicures and toe nails trimmed! Due to this I would not recommend running in them, or any heavy use. It’s clearly designed around fashion novelty, not repeated functionality. Enjoy!"
4.0,"Super cute keychain, I'm a total batman nerd. However, I do find the paint chips off a little so don't be too rough with it (like I am - I hurl my keys at the counter every day... this is most likely my fault and no issue of the item)."
4.0,"love it, will buy again"
4.0,what i like to use purchase extras can place in golf bag and vehicle since inexpensive
4.0,"The shirt is not as cute as what as shown in picture. It is flowy, and fits and looks okay."
4.0,loved the material and color.
4.0,"I ordered this for New Years, and sadly, I didn't get it on time. The top part is cute, but the dress rides up a lot. And the zipper likes to fold onto itself. If you are self-conscious at all of how you look in a dress, this may not be the one for you. I like it enough, but will be more selective in when i wear it"
4.0,Served its purpose as my “team” ordered for our “fun” night at an event! Arrived quickly & quality was as described.
4.0,"My son said it did the job...kept his nose and chin warm...took awhile to get here, but worth it."
4.0,"Needed it for a family photo, looked great. Gets tangled really easy."
4.0,"They are a little larger than I thought they would be, but very pretty."
4.0,"I use these with my Santa suit , so much easier than leather ones , comfortable and well made , thanks"
4.0,"I have several of this type of cardigan but I wanted one with a hood. flowy and very thin but soft... not suited for mainland winter but perfect for Hawaii. super versatile outfit topper as it would go well w/jeans, rompers, shorts, etc. if I still worked in a business casual office, this would probably be one of my go tos also. my only concern is since I line dry my clothing, I worry that this will stretch on a hanger... guess we'll see over time."
4.0,"Update: This company is amazing to work with.  After leaving this review the company contacted me and resolved the issue.  I do plan to purchase from the company again in the future.<br />I love all the compartments and the size for me is PERFECT.  I love the multi use straps.  I received the bag on Friday and started using it yesterday.  I immediately started noticing flaking but didn’t see where it was coming from. This morning, I really examined the bag and realized it’s completely falling apart!  I plan to return it.  I’m SO disappointed!  Any suggestions on a similar bag that won’t fall apart?"
4.0,So upset! I got the wrong color sent to me. These earrings are actually super cute but I’m now unable to wear the ones I wanted to my party. I’ll be exchanging them for the right color because I really want them... just super disappointed for now! :(
4.0,Would prefer a zipper.
4.0,My friend loves Owls and fun socks. Best of both worlds.
4.0,The hole for your head is very small. Would not recommend wearing foundation if you get this hoodie in black. I struggle to get my head out and I don’t think my head is even that big...
4.0,"Cute shirt and arrived quickly, but arrived in a clear plastic bag with a zipper closure. Anyone could see what is was, as well as open it. I have never received a package like that. Ever. No outer package, just the clear bag with the mailing label."
4.0,"This is a great dress for Texas summers. The fabric is thick enough to not be see thru with stretched, but it’s still breathable. It also doesn’t ride up like most tighter fitting dress tend to do when walking. I wish it were available in more colors"
4.0,This boot is comfortable and goes with anything!
4.0,Very nice. I sewed it to a smaller size.
4.0,Very soft and comfy. Wish they had pockets.
4.0,The design is a must have if you're a huge Nutcracker fanatic like myself. The print is very vibrant and nicely done as well no streaks nor imperfections. The material is Spandex and is quite thin. So I don't this hoodie is much for keeping warm as it is to flaunt your love for Nutcracker's.
4.0,"Material is cheap & stretchy, too much cheap polyester & not enough Cotton- quality is just ok. But it’s cute enough to workout in or wear under a jacket."
4.0,Pretty.  A little thin.
4.0,Supper cute just a little smaller than expected.
4.0,Thought it would be longer but then again I'm 6'0. Its super stretchy tho
4.0,Very nice raincoat.  It has fake pockets so don't try to pull up those snaps.  Any fuss with the snaps will probably rip your coat.  But it's nice and covers me very well.  I get tons of complements on it too.
4.0,"They are extremely comfortable and their light weight is an added plus.  However, they are too small, and I am returning them for a different size."
4.0,A little longer on me than I expected but overall good fit.
4.0,Shirt is smaller than the pants and kinda thin but very soft. Would recommend
4.0,"Be cautious on the size you order on this skort. It is good quality and well made, but I had to order two sizes larger than normal. It is the only XXL I have ever had to purchase. That is a little disheartening. Normally I wear a large. But I like it otherwise."
4.0,Got this for a costume and worked perfect.
4.0,Good value.  Looks good even when compared to high end ties
4.0,very nice though I thought it would be a little larger than it is.
4.0,Im sure this dress is one size fits all and they just put different tags on. I got an extra large because I like really loose and flowy dresses but this fits like a small. I am between a m/l so I still really like it but it doesn't fit me like it fits the model I am large chested and the line at her waist is under my breasts. I dont recommend for xl girls unless you have small chest
4.0,"I should have gotten the large instead of the extra large but needed it for a wedding.  It worked out and was very comfortable, washes great!~"
4.0,"Nice pair of shades, they come with a lanyard to hold them on your neck."
4.0,"If it had slightly more ""cush"" on the top layer it would be perfect. But I'd buy them again and I have."
4.0,Great winter slippers keep my feet warm while reminding me of Sunday Football!! They can be a little slippery on really smooth floors. Go Raiders!!
4.0,I wear XL but couldnt button this one. Good quality though
4.0,"Didn’t like it, so I returned it"
4.0,"Love the dress, however; the dots are larger than expected and the dress is a bit short. I ordered a large and I'm 5'7 so I hoped it would be longer. Overall, I like it. Its a keeper. I'll make it work."
4.0,"Comfortable for a sleep bra, but not great for exercise because the shoulder straps are mesh."
4.0,"The keeper fits tight over the buckle. Once I managed to pull it over, the strap itself going into it was really tight. After wearing it a couple days, it’s streched a little bit. Hope it loosens as I continue to wear it."
4.0,Affordable and good :)
4.0,They are absolutely beautiful but One came broken :(
4.0,great shoe but too large
4.0,"I ordered these to &#34;try out&#34; before potentially buying human hair extensions. My own hair is slightly below shoulder length and I wanted extensions to make longer braids. I was very surprised by the quality, given the price. The hair looks realistic and blends nicely with my own. There was a slight &#34;chemical&#34; smell right out of the package but after it airs out is not detectable. My only complaint is the dark brown/ auburn is more of a medium brown so I'm ordering dark brown."
4.0,I really like the look of the shoes. They are a little big and sometimes make a squeak noise with every step (if my feet get hot and sweat any). I purchased them due to having to wear closed toe shoes for work but also wanting a flat that looks nice with dresses
4.0,"These clips are exceptional. I purchased this because there was no way I would pay an arm and a leg to get one clip for the price this entire package cost. I like using the same color bars but that have a little different design elements. Not much more to say other than if you need more tie bars, these are an excellent buy."
4.0,Dress is pretty got it for a 2 soon to be 3 year old it fit her a lil loose but the fabric is really soft and comfy for her. Its kinda like a night gown or a dress to be home and play
4.0,"These prints are whimsical and the cotton is soft and lightweight- perfect for summer pajamas, but put together enough for playing outside too. We own these in several patterns and have purchased more."
4.0,meh...
4.0,I added snap buttons
4.0,very cute and my daughter loves it!
4.0,"Tight like a sports bra (medium impact) not a low impact yoga bra.  Perfect bargain so I don't over use the expensive sport bras that I absolutely need for those very active classes.  I did receive this sports bra in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I myself read reviews and take them into account when making purchases so I never filter or hyperinflate my feedback. I will continue to update this feedback if my experience with this sports bra changes significantly, I learn any new tips/tricks, or have anything else significant to add to the conversation. Thank you!"
4.0,Little bit big under arms
4.0,It's a bit shorter than I expected BUT I should have known 5 feet is equivalent to 5 inches
4.0,"I bought this ring to wear at work in place of my wedding rings so that they wouldn't get damaged or gross (I'm a nurse). I have been very happy with it. It is durable and easy to clean. Feels bulky at first, but easy to get used to. They run a little small, so consider ordering a half to full size up."
4.0,Very nice for what I paid for it. Not leather but material is good.
4.0,I like that it works if only I could it it wrapped and stay in place it takes almost 30 minutes if you don’t have any help taller people should not have a problem with it. I’m short with a big butt.
4.0,"It was  an amazingly beautiful dress for my daughters birthday. It was a little big, and the tule isn’t as fluffy as in the picture. The bow is also on a small saftey pin. Overall. A great purchase, she love it and felt like a princess. That is all that counts for me."
4.0,These  are going to be  stocking  stuffers.
4.0,"My son loved this jacket, and he is very picky! I now want one for myself!"
4.0,"I need to start by saying that I received this product for free from Burei to test for a review.<br /><br />To begin I will have to agree with the other reviewers here.  You open the package and feel like you bought a Rolex.  Nice heavy paper gift bag.  Fancy owner’s manual along with warranty paper and some sort of authenticity style card.  Gift hair clip (why this comes with a men’s watch I am not sure).  Very nice hinged box with a pillow inside that the watch is wrapped around.  Top marks for packaging and presentation.  But how about the watch?  I am not a “watch guy” by any means so how this compares to a super expensive watch I couldn’t begin to tell you.  All I can go by is how it works, looks and feels.<br /><br />As far as how it works, there is not much to it.  It keeps time very well.  I have had it for a week and a half and it has kept the proper time so far.  There is a standard adjustment dial on the side of the watch to set the time.  I did not submerge the watch in water but I did take it in the shower just to make sure it is at least water resistant and it is.  It didn’t break or fog up under the lens.  I don’t know how this would hold up to a long swim but rain should not be a problem.<br /><br />As far as looks and feel, the watch itself has a very simple but elegant look to it in my opinion.  It is very thin and light and has a minimalist face to it.  All the metal is stainless steel and gold colored.  I don’t really dig the watch band style, red and blue nylon strap, not my thing.  It is a quality band though so if you like the look you won’t be disappointed with it.<br /><br />Overall this is a pretty nice watch, it’s nice looking and doesn’t feel cheap.  I don’t think you are getting a crazy deal by any means but I think it is $40 worth of watch.  If you are getting this to get as a gift or if you are just into the packaging and presentation of watches then there is a lot of extra value in this department.  If you like the look of this watch I think you will be happy with this watch."
4.0,"I do love the suit, the fit and the support. I would recommend. But for those of us who are not large busted... the design causes the middle (between the wires on the underwire) to pucker and fold forward.... exposing you if you are not careful. I have to be very intentional about how I bend over and/or sit when Waring this suit.  BUT.... the fit is perfect, the support is great and I love the way it looks on me. It is a great suit!"
4.0,Ordered in January and it fit well but came with a broken button. Other than that it's well.
4.0,"Bluetooth on this headset was easy to set up and has a pretty good range, sound quality is not HD or noise canceling but for a pair of over the ear headphones the quality is very good. Design is great especially being able to remove the headphones from the hat to wash. Only problem I had personally is the elastic is rather tight and over an extended period of time, such as a full work day, it presses my ears into my glasses and causes alot of discomfort after 4-5+ hours of continual use. Battery life is great for such a small piece of tech that is rechargeable and I was getting 6-7 hours of use on a charge. I ended up gifting this to my sister due to the discomfort issue as she would get more use from it."
4.0,"Slippers provide nice support. However, I ordered size 9 and is about half inch short. Had I known, I would order next size up."
4.0,"This was a gorgeous dress to wear out on the town. I first ordered the Large but it was a little tight, it really hugs all your curves. I then ordered the XL, even though it was a little looser and not so tight, you could tell it was too big. I'm 5'6 145 pounds. I ended up returning the XL and kept the Large and wore it out. Can't wait to wear it again for date night."
4.0,This is a nice statement piece and its definitely eye catching. Nice piece to wear on the weekends or casual dressing.  It may come with a few flaws but because it's such an eye catcher it's worth the purchase again in different colors.
4.0,actual color is lighter than the picture. good material.
4.0,Love them. Just a little too big. Not a big deal.
4.0,"Love it. Super cute and priced well. Got several compliments. I ordered med. It fit perfectly, (even with my large bust). Gave 4 because the quality was not 100% it was unraveling at the sleeves bu the end of the night. But feel the price reflects that."
4.0,The tank comes in such cute colors! I got the light blue one and I love the cinched design on the sides. Super flattering! They do shrink a bit in the wash since they’re cotton.
4.0,SOFT INSIDE THAT DOESNT RUB THE CHILDS FOOT RAW
4.0,"It is so bright and good.  if you have dark skin, you would be sold it."
4.0,This is such a cool mask. The adjustable straps are good.. Fabric feels good.. Not one of the easiest masks to breathe through but not terrible..<br />It looks great and is perfect for Halloween!
4.0,"I Loved the style-very similar to a much more expensive brand I usually buy. Only gave it 4 stars because the cotton isn't as soft as the more expensive brand. But, I'd definitely buy another one. Good value."
4.0,"These socks work well, though I do not think they are medical grade compression socks. They work well for some weird leg thing I get. They all look cute too!"
4.0,"I like that it has pockets. The length is perfect, but the sleeves are a little tight. It washes well. I am happy with this."
4.0,"Good price, good quality, but the molded cups are a bit firm. I would prefer a softer foam insert than a firm molded cup"
4.0,Used this for part of my Halloween costume.  Worked just fine
4.0,They do scrub well but they are so thick that it’s very awkward to move your hands.  They work ok for large areas but not fine or detailed work.
4.0,Nice thin sweater that you can wear if you don't need a thick one. It fit smaller than I expected and I ordered a size up. It's not the most comfortable fabric but layering it wasn't a problem and ended up looking cute with a t-shirt and jeans.
4.0,The shorts are super short. Love the top.
4.0,"You get what you pay for: very stylish, but not the best quality- the threads are stiff, not stretchy like good bathing suits, so easy to rip if you pull or stretch it. SO definitely get larger than your size. I am a USA Small, and got this Asian Medium, and it was still snug! But serving it's purpose as fashionable!"
4.0,Very cute they are tiny. More for a tiny women or child. Nicely made a great price.
4.0,I bought these because I was having trouble with plantar fasciatis and the doctor told me I shouldn't go barefoot in the house.  They are nice sturdy slippers and have adjusted to fit my feet nicely.  The arch supports are good but personally I could use a little more so may end up putting another insole in eventually.  Overall a very good choice and much better than regular slippers.
4.0,"It might be a little longer than I expected. But it is very nice, seems sturdy ."
4.0,Good combo
4.0,"The size chart appears to be accurate. Nice, heavy sweatpants. Only improvement I could ask for would be stitching the pocket to the front of the pant."
4.0,This was try #2 for summer rompers. I was very happy with the waistline on this (I’m 5’3” 140lbs and have a short torso). Ordered medium. Fits great. Drawstring makes it nice for getting on and off w/o much trouble.
4.0,"It’s very nice but comes a little smaller than I expected so I had to buy another, just one size up. Other than that I like it."
4.0,These are so cute. They remind me of Christmas ornaments. Perfect for the season!
4.0,It had a lot of useless hardware but it’s worth the price.
4.0,"I like it , and wanna get my niece one too, I saw a lot used it here in my area"
4.0,"shoe was true to size and very sturdy. My son wanted these for christmas. He's 19, and they are great for getting around campus in winter!"
4.0,Love it. I have had one of these for several years. My only complaint is that it does not seem to be made as well. but overall very soft and comfy
4.0,I bought these for my 25lb 2 year old daughter. I'm glad I read reviews and purchased a 3t. They fit slightly snug but should last the summer. And they look well made.
4.0,"I ordered this band among several others and it arrived first. The woven nylon seems strong like it will hold up well. I ordered the large size thinking it would be similar to the large stock band on the fitbit sense. It was much smaller. It still fits, but on the 2nd or 3rd to the last notch on my large wrist. Just keep that in mind. Otherwise it looks like a good product so far"
4.0,"This makes a very nice and inexpensive gift.  cute and simple, gift for my daughters birthday, and she liked it alot!"
4.0,The color was nice and the deniem was nice as well
4.0,"My husband likes it. He says he gets a little tangled up in it, but he is not used to wearing a night shirt. It is soft and comfortable"
4.0,"Very pretty colors. They seem slightly snug-fitting, but I have large hands. They would be fine for those with small to medium hands."
4.0,"This is a very bright shirt - good for the beach.  My husband wears a medium usually and after reading reviews that said go 2 sized up, I did but should have just gone one size up.<br />- I received this product (very kindly) at a discount or free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the product, based upon my own personal experience.<br />- I have not been coached or asked to provide positive feedback, nor have I received any compensation or incentive from the company for this review.<br />- I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission 16 CFR part 255 &#34;guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising&#34;.<br />- I am not affiliated with this company or any of their products, in any way.<br />- The views expressed here are my own, based on my personal use and experience with the product, and are unbiased and honest reviews.

4.0,Dress is well made but to small for me
4.0,"So cute…I love the retro print on this band, however I noticed the pattern starting to wear off in areas. It’s probably ok for short term use.<br />As fas as sizing…I have small wrists and this band is cut very small."
4.0,carring id credit cards etc
4.0,"Rather stylish.  Fit is snug (as it should be) although had to order two sizes larger to get a reasonably correct fit.  Provides the desired relaxed grip on steering wheel.  Arrived on time in and packaged in handsome suede bag.  Will order a pair for my brother for his birthday.  Good buy at the price.  Remains to be seen how they will hold up, but generally satisfied with purchase."
4.0,"the hat was very nice. Well made. Ths company is really on to a good thing. I hope to buy a winter hat, as soon as they are ready"
4.0,"I like this buckle. I receive many compliments for it. It is as described. It stretches nicely. It doesn’t feel tight around your waist at all. The detail in the back gives an extra pop to your outfit. I took a star off because the body of the buckle was a bit twisted and could not be untwisted. Luckily, when I wore it, it was not noticeable."
4.0,It fit okay . Just didn’t realize it was backless . But it’s nice . Good quality
4.0,Order up for size. I really like these shoes. Get compliments ALL the time. Not best shoes for standing or walking all day unless you can find some awesome insoles. The ball of my foot gets sore from the sole being thinner. But the shoe is nice wider fit with the awesome look of sugar skulls.  I have ordered a couple pair of different types of shoes from this design4u and the print is so bright and detailed.  Love the print just not the support of the shoe sole.
4.0,"These stood up well on my first day of use at the beach, they were snug fit and did not allow any sand inside while giving a solid step over rocks, shells, etc. They also have no sharp edges to cut or puncture the inflatable kayak I was in most of the day. Only downside is there is near zero support for the arch and not much cushioning. I would not want to walk on concrete or asphalt with them, but beach and water use is fine"
4.0,Really nice and the price is right!
4.0,"I love these little socks, they solved my problem of having to wear no socks with my converse because I have having ones that show and the other no show ones on the market fall down constantly. these are the best of both worlds. they're kinda cheap, so they will begin to develop holes overtime but I expected that for the price."
4.0,I have received many compliments about my dress and I love Polk-a-fits!
4.0,"I have to say that I get a little tired of having different glasses for different uses.  I have my reading glasses, sunglasses and blue light blocking glasses for TV and computer.  I kept wishing I could have one pair of glasses that would do it all and here they are.<br /><br />I like the style with no-rim lenses and the soft nose pads.  These are very comfortable and light weight.  I would have preferred metal temples that I could bend to fit my ears, but that is a personal preference, and these do fit and feel fine.<br /><br />The optics of the lenses are quite good, with very little glare and distortion.  The lenses are not completely clear as the pictures indicate.  They have a very slight yellow cast which looks fine.  They do a good job of cutting down the glare for day and night use.  I'm not sure how to test them for blue light blockage, but it seems as good as most.<br /><br />They actually do a great job of changing color in the sun, unlike so many inexpensive glasses that barely change.  They look very attractive in the sun and inside.<br /><br />I am new to bifocals, and that is the one area that I'm not as excited about.  The reading portion seems a bit high, almost to the center of the lens.  It actually seems higher in the right eye than the left eye.  I wish the lenses were a bit larger, and then there would be adequate reading lens area without interfering with normal vision."
4.0,"It's great bag if you don't carry many items.  I tend to overstuff my handbags, and the size of this bag makes that much harder."
4.0,I paid $7 for this. I got the white/ brown color block turtleneck shirt. It is completely see through and very lightweight. It is cute over another white shirt.  It does pull very easily (see picture). The first day I wore this I got a large pull in it which upset me because I love it a lot.
4.0,"Nice watch for a Product made in China. I was impressed with the overall quality.  Few things I think were off for me are the glossy finish, I was expecting a matte black finish and the crown also has issues, when you set the time and try to press it back in the hands of the clock adjusts. Overall it's a good quality piece for the cost."
4.0,"Cute top for the price. Material was very sheer and it’s tight through the shoulders. Could still wear but glad I ordered a size up. I’m 5’3”, 135lbs. I am pregnant too and the bottom half of the shirt is very flowy so covers any bump - for the time being."
4.0,Had 2 order 2 pair to match it up!
4.0,"I did not wear these pants to the party, but I put them on the day after.  They fit well, but a bit to high above the waist.  The long length was expected. I wore them at home with family and friends."
4.0,These gloves are a nice weight for cold mornings. Good driving gloves.  Nice colors.  I returned as fingers were too long.
4.0,Shorter than I thought but good anyways
4.0,"It's a lot tinier than expected, but it's cute. I considered returning it because the size wasn't ideal, but ultimately decided to keep it."
4.0,"Size was spot on and looked really good on. Didn’t realize it doesn’t come with the white shirt underneath, but it was okay. We made do."
4.0,"This would be THE most perfect summer dress, IF it weren't for the pockets. It's nice material, well made, fits great and ideal for a summer evening party. It's just not something you would put pockets on. If I can sew up the pockets I'm buying another one in blue."
4.0,"I had another set of these and lost one, so I needed a replacement. These are good quality, they don't irritate my ear, they snap together cleanly, and stay shut well for the most part. I'd obviously get then again. Maybe pricy for a small, very basic piece of metal, but when you need it it's worth it."
4.0,Christmas present for my grandson sure he will love it there are vey  orthentic looking
4.0,Only thing is the blue comes off after a few months!
4.0,This is a real leather belt that should last many years.  It is definitely casual.
4.0,"I lost my watchcap style hat and went looking for another one -- I got this to go with my peacoat, and it is just right"
4.0,The color I got was navy blue. The dress runs a little small if you want it to fit like the model go up a size. This is not a sweater dress like I thought when I ordered it the material appears to be polyester.
4.0,"Really like these. I wear an 8-10 and these fit pretty well. Shorts are a little short and top might be tight if you have breasts, which I don't ;-)."
4.0,Great for an ID and a few cards for easy compact carrying in a pocket.
4.0,"For price you really can’t go wrong. Just make sure you order a size up. That’s why it’s 4 stars.<br /><br />I’m 5’2” 127, I’m very fit. I wear usually xs in petites.<br /><br /> A small in reg sizes is easily 2 sizes to big in other brands. So when this was tight in the shoulders and chest area, I was surprised."
4.0,"this dress is very fun, and cute and  great for a night out."
4.0,Good quality very nice color but the size ruin a little to small I ordered a XL but it was more like a XS
4.0,"I have not worn this sweater yet as its summer.  I did try it on, fits nice, some stretch and good length to wear with skinny jeans or leggings."
4.0,I wear a size 16/18 with 42F breast... fits as described...with the exception of the possibility of needing a lil covering in cleavage area...I wore a tank underneath...I am 5'8 and it came to my ankle.
4.0,"Like it a lot. Wanted it to fit big,and it does. Although it says it is to be dry cleaned. We didn't do that. Washed in cold water. It was fine."
4.0,"bought as gift, seem well made"
4.0,I like a lot !
4.0,It holds even my biggest sunglasses! A little large but perfect for travel. I even have it hung up on my wall for storage at home!
4.0,worked out great for my son
4.0,"I enjoy the purse, would like to find one a little larger, but this one is the right side for what I wanted it for.<br />Thank you"
4.0,"I love how it looks! Very cute and not too flashy ❤️<br />2 things that's lowered the rating though were: after 2 uses the back of the necklace did turn black but that was expected since it's not a real gold/diamond necklace and it also gave me a rash on my neck but my skin tends to rash very easily regardless of what I wear. But overall, a great purchase."
4.0,Nice quality. Delivered on time.  Don't understand or particularly like the side zippers.
4.0,It’s a little smaller than I expected. The face is also a little bare and looks bland. Also it won’t center on my wrist. It keeps spinning to the left at the side of my hand. I can’t make it any tighter or my pulse would stop lol
4.0,"The jacket is great looking and seems to be the quality advertised but I bought a medium instead of a small (which I usually wear) in order to be able to fit a sweater or even a sweatshirt under it.  The jacket won't close to zip up even with my tank top on it.  I recommend having the jacket but buy 2 sizes larger then you would have in shirt or something similar to it. The purple (pink) is really a pretty color. If I can return this one, I'll see if I can get the same jacket but in the large."
4.0,"Really like the tie, fit fine for an XL tie, even with a full windsor knot. Even held the dimple for the entire 9 hours I wore it the first time. Only thing I'd say is that the color is a bit lighter than the picture. Not MUCH lighter, but still. Just be aware if you're trying to match it to your existing wardrobe."
4.0,"These are great for cleaning dishes; however, I find them a touch small for my hands. This makes them a little tricky to remove. That said, I would buy them again."
4.0,Elegant and classy!!!! I have in five colors!!!!
4.0,I love everything about this robe except the tie for the waist is sewn in place high on the back so it really ties underneath my boobs.  And it needs the thing on the back of the neck so you can hang it on a hook.<br />Other than that it would have been perfect.  The length is perfect.  It washes great.  The feel is very soft.  I’m keeping it because I still haven’t found the perfect one yet and those two things I think I can live without for now.
4.0,A little hard to get all screws in a stud.  Also tricky to hang straight.  Sturdy once installed.
4.0,well made and looks good.
4.0,"I love the way it feels on my wrist it is very light. I made the mistake of wearing it at the lake for a couple of hours underwater, after a few beers I forgot to take it off. The wooden beads lost a little bit of color, but I really don't think it's a big deal it still looks very earthy and unique"
4.0,ordered medium size and they were a little bigger than expected.  I can't imagine what the large ones look like!  But my kpop obsessed daughter has grown attached to them!
4.0,Comfortable. Adorable. Buy them!
4.0,I like these leggings: the material is stretchy and it’s “squat-proof” but a major pet peeve for me is that the waist band rolls down. I’m 5’6” and 177lbs bought Large.
4.0,"These are so beyond cute! The material is more sweatpants material, but you can wear a nice top and dress the pants up. They are beyond comfortable, and can wear them for literally anything. My only complaint is that the elastic band is not sew into place, so if they are a little big you can't successfully roll them up. Great buy!!"
4.0,Really convenient and easy to get to.
4.0,It is a great looking watch.
4.0,"Gave them 4 stars only because they sometimes want to snag a bit on my shirt/shoulder. So don't wear them with something delicate.  And even then, it's just a slight tug on your ear, not a big deal. I have gotten lots of compliments on them. Good buy."
4.0,"Nice skirt, good fit."
4.0,"Looking forward to using this on trip to Europe - the passport slot is rather a tight fit and there is a distinct odor to the wallet, I left it our to air for a couple of days. Price was right, looks like a quality product."
4.0,I got this for my small daughter to make her feel like special (because she got 'grown-up' jewelry). She liked it.
4.0,Yes for an out intown smaller purse very pretty.  And light weight
4.0,"i like wolf products very much.  i think box and lids should be sold together as a complete product.  if without lids, it does not make sense for silver products.  a lid should be a must.  selling them separately causes inconvenience and higher pricing.<br /><br />there seems to be ample margin on those (comparing to other products), so seller should consider selling them together."
4.0,It took awhile to finally get a mask to be comfortable. They took awhile to get here. Also the only reason I took off a star is that even after washing they smell funny when you breath into them.  I still like them the best.
4.0,Arrived quick. Runs small
4.0,Very cute and sparkley
4.0,Fits nicely and is not thick so it's comfortable
4.0,"Very cute! My thighs aren't that big so I have a little slack on the boots, but other than that, I love them."
4.0,I like this. It holds everything I need to carry with me. Plus when my phone is put up in it. I still can use my phone. Through the clear pocket in back. Came in on time
4.0,I bought these to replace cotton masks I have been wearing. I had found that I was not getting enough air with the conventional masks and my breathing was difficult for long periods of time. I thought this mask would be a better choice for air flow. I have not read much about whether these nylon type sleeve masks are as effective in filtering air to protect from the virus. I see some folks wearing them but yet not sure how safe they are. I can breath better in them as the material is thin and more comfortable. The colors are quite nice. The turquoise one is like a Tiffany color. I will say that at times the item slips from my nose more easily than conventional masks. I think it depends on the size of your head and nose as to how tight they will snug to your face. I imagine eventually the CDC will come out with guidelines or studies on the use of these nylon shields over cotton or other materials. For now I am switching things up and wearing these when I am out for longer times for better breathing but then I use the other cotton ones for short duration when in a crowded spot.
4.0,this is not yellow it's bright ORANGE. The company has offered a replacement and seem to be helpful. I suggested they review and update color names. since the other comment I see is the red was maroon.
4.0,"Good product, I give only 4 stars because it is a bit smaller than the description and somewhat darker, if you use it in the day it obscures the vision a lot"
4.0,"Love this, super cute and fits TTS! However it said it came with clear straps and I searched the whole package and their wasn’t any. Made it work still with a more padded strapless bra told hold it up, but wish it would have came with them!"
4.0,We like and it looks good!
4.0,Really cute. They are a bit small though after following the sizing chart. Tried them out anyway and they were even more snug after they were wet. Will have to give these away and buy a new pair because we really do like them. 15 month old liked them and enjoyed splashing around in them.
4.0,My only wish is that the lenses were polarized.
4.0,I’ve bought several Nikes. Like to wear them to work. Didn’t give it 5/5 only because it took awhile for me to break them in compared to other Nikes I’ve had of the same size. Now I wear these everyday.
4.0,"these were great, the tails feel off but they were easy to put back on, very heavy duty not cheap looking"
4.0,"I wear this shirt ALL the time, it is super comfy. However the back of the shirt is really long but I just tuck it up when wearing it."
4.0,I like the color most and it’s very comfortable.
4.0,"I bought theses for a birthday gift and they look great, not expensive and they look like they are... Nice gift.."
4.0,diff thats for sure
4.0,"It winds my watch, doesn't cost a fortune and isn't (too) ugly like a lot of the other winders I looked at. It does what I'd expect. Not much else to say."
4.0,"I'm 5'1&#34; and 125 lbs. I usually wear a medium, but got a small based on the reviews. I'm glad I did. So I would recommend ordering 1 or 2 sizes smaller."
4.0,These fit but run a bit tighter than the material the butterfly trouser socks are made from.  These are sure cute though.
4.0,Fit good; warm and comfortable.  Would recommend.
4.0,"I was a little disappointed by the quality of the image printed on the fabric. The image online looks clear and crisp, but it’s a bit blurrier than I expected in person. Some of the words are impossible to read. (Even the picture I took looks better than in person!) It’s also huge on my face. I had to tilt my head back weird to get the whole thing in a picture! It’s made well otherwise. The ear loops hold well and are adjustable and it’s nice fabric. Has a strange chemical odor at first, but washing it fixes that, which I recommend anyways."
4.0,"This nose ring fits nice and snug how I wanted. However the facet prongs are rough, scratches my nose hole and I have to keep adjusting it. Hard to close the clasp but it’s manageable, if it were too easy it wouldn’t stay on. Other than that it’s a great piece"
4.0,Says unisex but kinda small barely fit my boyfriend and the one I wore moved as I moved my head and they don't fold away like some. I had better ones but then for more money.
4.0,"The only part that didn't  fit was was the arms.  It has slim sleeves that don't  really stretch so if you had a bit extra on your arms, the sleeves will be tight."
4.0,The only flaw is that the zipper works on sideline of a woman
4.0,I like the idea of odd pairing. It is good for Christmas fun.
4.0,"They were a bit too tight on me, but still very cute!!"
4.0,Fits well. Not as bright color as picture.
4.0,Satisfied with this item
4.0,Not super high quality but it looks nice
4.0,Its okay. Doesn't look as vibrant like the pic but its okay. Arrived quickly
4.0,"This bag is quite narrow - it would make a better make up bag than handbag.  The flowers are bone/off white in color, the stems a subdued green.  The embroidery floss has a subtle sheen and it is actually lovely, just too small for my needs."
4.0,Love it! My only wish is that the clips were on the side not the handles. Otherwise. I loooooove this.
4.0,"Size up when purchasing. Ordered an xl, fits like a medium/large. Otherwise great product!!"
4.0,"Great slim fitting hiking/tacticool pants that doesn't swallow up your shoes. It has very functional pockets that do not look tacky, and has extra fabric in the knee area for durability. A problem with these pants is the long crotch length that decreases mobility. Crouching or intense man spreading can really strain the crotch gusset to a nice E sharp. Sizing up should help with mobility for these pants if you don't mind them a little baggier."
4.0,"These shoes are so cute and very comfortable.  The only trouble I have is that the inside bottom lining started peeling up the first day.  I could easily rip it out, but the base of the shoe doesn't look comfortable.  I can't get it to lie down flat now.  As long as I'm not walking a few miles it won't be a problem, but I think I'm going to look into getting inserts to avoid the now bumpy liner."
4.0,Nice and warm. And I love the style. Something different.
4.0,Color its not true to what shows but it is a beautiful dress runs a bit big so stick to your size
4.0,difficult closing mechanism
4.0,if you don't mind showing off your goods at the top then this dress is for you.
4.0,Too large and was a gift for my wife who.didn't care for it..
4.0,Bought these for my partner and they love them! Good quality for the price.
4.0,Runs small other than that my son loves it. Lightweight & comfy. Son normally wears a men's medium to large. Got the XXL based on other reviews & it fir perfectly.
4.0,The product is well made and I have received several compliments on it.  My only issue is that it is very heavy. I would buy it again.
4.0,"These masks were very well made, and the woman's mask is beautiful.  It is made of a very firm molded material .  I have not worn it to my function yet so cannot speak to it's comfort over a long period.  It is comfortable when tried on though.  The mens mask has ties and the womans has elastic."
4.0,I like the elastic in the back since it doesn't have belt loops. It fits good.
4.0,This is a cute fashion case. The watercolor art work looks great on my daughter's pink phone. It' feels good in your hand and isn't slippery allowing you to keep a good grip on your phone. It seems sufficient to protect against accidental drops. It fits the iPhone 5c well and allows access to the buttons. My daughter likes it and that's the main thing because she will actually use it.
4.0,Love the bag. Good quality but the attachment for the shoulder strap was wrong so I can’t use it.
4.0,Makes him look good! ;)
4.0,"The jumpsuit was beautiful. Looked exactly like the picture. However, it doesn't stretch so if you have curves or ""junk in the trunk"" like me you will need to order a size up."
4.0,"Great top!! Whether for dancing or running around in, you cannot beat the comfort or style.  As you wear it, it does tend to stretch around the hand area but It won't keep me from buying other colours as well."
4.0,"These are awesome pajamas. They are soft, have the perfect stretch, and fit perfectly. However, one of the three pairs arrived with rust colored stains on the front that I have been unable to get out."
4.0,order arrived promptly and complete.  excellent price.  very satisfied.
4.0,A bit big. Otherwise OK.
4.0,Looks nice on the finger :)
4.0,I like it but it's a lot flimsier than it looks. I went with my bra size on the chart and it was a bit big. Very stretchy and comfortable but the underwire provides no loft since this isn't as fitted as it looks. It's mostly just stretchy much with a super thin lace overlay
4.0,These are Great! I love them! As well as the Colors. It was Great!
4.0,Buena Calidad. Calzo 9y1/2 de mujer (26cm) y me quedaron un poco grandes en el largo del pie las L/XL pero en el ancho y tobillo están perfectas.
4.0,"Beautiful sparkling color spectrum. Only issue was length. I gave this as a gift to my mother (who has a normal sized neck) and necklace was more like a choker. It did not come with an extender (many do). Since she loved it, I am going to try making an extender for it. Hence the 4 stars."
4.0,"Ordered ladies large, very small."
4.0,Cute for what you pay!
4.0,"It works fine, but the hourly alarm is easy to turn on accidentally."
4.0,"Super, super cute!! My niece looked at this dress with awe! She is three years old, however, 110 cm seems incredibly big still for a 3-4 year old -- at least this version of 110 cm anyways. However, I know she will eventually grow into it, so for the price, we can wait for her to wear it well!"
4.0,"Ordered a size large, which I usually wear. The bottoms were OK, but the top didn’t even come down to the waist line of the pants. I have to wear a long Cami under it if I don’t want my blubber to show ☹️"
4.0,This was a present for my daughter. And she was very happy with it!!!!!!! I would have been happier if it came in a gift box. But that is my fault I did not state it was a gift.
4.0,Typical great quality product from Okukai. Unfortunately it seems to run about a half size smaller than the kia'i sandals I've been buying all these years. About ½ inch shorter and ½ inch narrower.
4.0,"I received many compliments in this dress. Only reason I’m didn’t give 5 stars is because it does have threads coming off in some places, but it isn’t noticeable to others. Will hand wash this dress to keep it in good shape. Would recommend!"
4.0,Great design some of my scarfs are to bulky and some to thin but I love this
4.0,Nice shirt. Gave it to a friend of mine for christmas and then she stopped talking to me forever.  No complaints.
4.0,"I have been wearing compression socks forever as I'm on my feet all day long.  These have great compression, but they are too long for my legs.  The foot part fit fine for my ""shoe"" size but they came up over my knees so I had to fold them down; which isn't good for your circulation.  I gave up and gifted them to my fellow co-workers.  The women who took them are all different sizes and heights.  The only ones who they fit well were the women over 5'9"".  So if you are shorter than 5'9"" or have short legs (which I don't) these will be too long for you.  It's a shame as they really did have great compression."
4.0,Great quality but they definitely run small. Get at least 4 times bigger size than you would usually get.
4.0,This is a cute purse.  It was just too small for me.  I wasn't able to get my wallet in it and include anything else.
4.0,"The fabric is strange on this shirt and although it is made just like it looks in the photo description, the fabric looks different to me. It has little holes all in it and looks like some kind of mesh or netting. It is comfortable and lightweight and cool in this summer heat, especially with all this humidity we have had lately. I personally just don't like the way it looks or fits. I ordered the dusty rose color and that is a light mauve or pink and it looks exactly like it did in the photo description. There is a band at the bottom and I don't care much for the way that looks. Of course, you can pull it up slightly and blouse up the top and cover the band up completely. It would look nice with a skirt, like a fitted midi pencil skirt or even a nice pair of very slim fitting pants or palazzo pants with the wide legs. I see someone, like my mom, wearing this, but not me. There are bands around the bottom of the sleeves which end right above the elbows and are slightly fitted looking. There is a large pleat down the front that is very flattering. It is v necked and I think that look is flattering on every woman. The material is why I took off a star and the fit. According to the sizing chart an XXXL should have fit me fine, and it does indeed fit, but it was pretty snug, even if it is Asian sizes and not US. I wish everyone followed the same sizing of clothing as it would make everything so much easier, but they don't. With all clothing I order online, I went with the largest size available and hoped for the best. My measurements for comparison are as follows: 43&#34; bust or 38D/35&#34; waist/45&#34;hips and I'm 5'7&#34; and 199 lbs. The XXXL fits me fine and I normally wear a L or XL, but it is a little snug. If I was to gain 10 lbs. this would no longer fit. If you have a tummy and small hips this will fit great...if you have large breasts, this will fit great.<br />I received a discount on this shirt in exchange for my honest opinion and review of the product. I hope you have found my review helpful. Thank you!"
4.0,Have received lots of compliments when I wear this.
4.0,"It is fine, looks exactly like the picture."
4.0,"Nice fit. A little short in length, but I'm also tall, so that's usually to be expected for me!"
4.0,My daughter likes everything but the neckline so we returned it:(
4.0,I’d recommend it just maybe know your size or get one size up
4.0,Lenses are darker than expected.
4.0,"This is an extremely high quality bracelet. I see a lot of cheaply made jewelry out there that just falls apart within weeks of wear. This bracelet is made to LAST! Excellent craftsmanship and materials. It's very shiney  and pretty too! It's a great concept of personalized jewelry, you can pick from so many &#34;Nugz&#34; charms to pop into it for a different look every day! I'd recommend this bracelet to every girl who likes to look good and change it up on the daily. Awesome product! I received this at a discount  in return for my honest review, and believe me my reviews are always brutally honest!<br /><br />** Update: its been almost 2 weeks, and 2 of the hoops at the end have disappeared! They must have broken off without my noticing. It's not a big deal to me, because out of the 4 hoops i was using the second one, and only the last 2 came off, but this does say something about the quality of the bracelet. And here I was ranting about how high quality it is! Maybe this is a rare occurrence, but I dont think any part of a nice bracelet should break after less than 2 weeks. Just sayin'!"
4.0,"I've bought three of these; the red, red checked and black wide band in straps. The red feels comfy but I need a top to cover bc I don't feel comfortable showing my bra. The red checked is cut similar but tighter so order a size up. The black wide band strap is just right and it feels amazing. It's great for working out and offers a ton of support; it's almost to the edge of ordering a size down but no so much if your top heavy."
4.0,"We bought these for my autistic grandson's shoes.  He absolutely hates tying his shoes.  The laces are a little short when you are loosening shoes to put your feet in them, and because they are thicker laces, it's a bit more work initially.  I think they would have been great for me to use, but may not work as well for folks who prefer to keep their shoes tight."
4.0,Perfect for a gold party! Washing is difficult.
4.0,Too tight at bottom of sweater
4.0,A strap at the back would be more dressy
4.0,I ordered these in a 8.5 because after my recent pregnancy my feet grew so I am unsure what size I currently am (8-8.5 depending on the brand)? I figured if there was extra room I could wear thick socks. When I first tried them on I was surprised at how much room I had still. Then after walking around at home and trying them on with socks I realized that with the low side cut they looked silly with socks on. They aren't too large and I didn't want the hassle of returning them so I may just put in some shoe inserts. Overall they are cute boots and look well made but I have yet to wear them out..
4.0,"I typically wear size 2 and purchased M in these. They fit and are not loose at all, so I think they run small. The pockets are meshy and don't stay flat to the body. They kind of stick out. Overall, they're fine!"
4.0,Product looks exactly as pictured
4.0,Good product for what you pay.
4.0,These took about 2 weeks to receive but a week prior to its estimated delivery date. They come from China. They’re warm & fuzzy socks. Fit perfect and suits my needs.
4.0,"Cheap material, thin. Over all it looks like the image."
4.0,"They were a gift for my SIL, she liked them. Good gloves and delivered in a timely manner."
4.0,"Wished it ran a little larger for me, 3x, otherwise I love it."
4.0,Was very pleased with this and arrived earlier than expected.
4.0,To small  Like size S-M
4.0,Love it I will buy more.
4.0,"Good quality, but very short."
4.0,Really soft fabric- the tie key hole stretches so that my bra shows though I am busty at a 34DD.
4.0,"Although the package arrived well earlier than the lates expectation date and was in nice condition, especially for a hoodie...it strangely smelled of smoke? I mean like...real smoke. Like sombody burned something right nedt to the fabric kind of smoke.<br /><br />Which was...odd?<br /><br />Other than that it's nice and I'm gunna enjoy the hell out of my new Cloud Strife hoodie."
4.0,Oh my god.  Set of three.  Teachers loved them
4.0,"Super sexy top.  I have a really long torso, so it is a little short for me.  I managed to wear it with a high waist skirt, so its perfect that way"
4.0,"They work great, but  you MUST apply a strong glue. The sticky back fails quickly."
4.0,Love this bracelett. I love the material and trinkets on it. The only downside is the branch stuck out and the metal caught on things so I just cut that part of the bracelett off but Im ok with that though I didnt want to. I mostly wanted the tree of life symbol.
4.0,"It’s thicker than my other one so not good for summer. Since I live in the south lighter weight was what I was hoping for. It’s comfortable but the elastic is a bit tight, had to stretch it a lot to get it to fit around my husband head. I don’t need to tighten the elastic at all, which is unusual for me as I have a small head. Overall however they are well made and durable. Made in Taiwan with USA seller."
4.0,Good fit. Great price. Seem to have shrunk slightly in the wash. The sleeves are a bit shorter than they first were. Kind of odd. But a good deal for gym use.
4.0,"I am enjoying my Freetoes!  When I first started wearing them, they were uncomfortable, but after a couple of days I got used to them after finding the best placement on my feet so they won't bunch up.  I need my toes to have air so they don't get the toe fungus thing, but I want to wear my cushy Teva flip flops during the winter.  My feet get cold, but regular socks don't allow my toes to get air, so I thought I would try these.  They work well, but I wish they were mid calf or knee highs to keep my legs warm.  I knew when I was buying them that they only came up to the ankle, so I am not complaining.  I wish you would add higher socks to your product offering.  I loved the story of Kati\e being 8 years old and starting this business.  The fabric is soft and I loved the colors/design."
4.0,I bought these because I tend to lose the backing to my earrings.  They are a good replacement and seem to be a good fit for my earrings. I also like that they are white gold so I don't have to worry about having a bad reaction to some unknown metal.
4.0,"Not waterproof per se, but still warm and grippy when wet, which I think is better actually. Like little wetsuits for your hands."
4.0,They're pretty comfortable. Fit my legs and my waist nicely but my butt was squeezed. I would recommend getting a size up and just taking in the waistband. Would have gone three stars but the pockets were actually a pretty good size and that's a real plus for me.
4.0,"This is ok. It’s not easy to wash and to iron though. I only wear it once or twice. It was comfortable. I should have chosen a different color though, this one (navy blue) looked like some kind of uniform"
4.0,This was a gift at Christmas fir Co worker she loved it and fit perfect
4.0,Cute but on the small side.
4.0,"I wasn’t crazy about where the waistline hit—wasn’t flattering at all. I am 5’7”, large chest, and post-partum belly, and this dress was not complimentary to my body type at the moment."
4.0,"This is a very well made lanyard, the pink and grey floral is even better looking in person. Thick fabric, that doesn't irritate my neck, coupled with a sturdy 'claw' type clip keeps my badge secure without having to push it on.<br />I like the phone holder portion, it's thin, it's fabric and fits well under my phone case without any bulk. Makes going bag free easy peasy.<br />Great price, great quality!"
4.0,Very thin denim
4.0,I like it ♡
4.0,Fit good shorter then Expected but nice
4.0,"I have medium sized adult hands, these fit children better. I was able to put them on, but they were small. Great for kids!"
4.0,"This product was perfect for onetime use. Even w/ properly cleaning ,drying and packing the second use wasn’t as secure."
4.0,"The only thing that I disliked is that the arms are short, but otherwise I’m pleased."
4.0,"The cufflinks are very nice, but for my tastes, they are too small."
4.0,Looks very nice.  Got as a gift for my mom.  She'll love it.  Very dainty looking.
4.0,Not for tall girls
4.0,It’s a thick strap made of a soft material.  Feels good on the shoulder.
4.0,"I wish this was a clutch with a strap, but for the price it is a product worth the purchase.  After a year of being in my large purse I had to get a different one, so I was happy with it."
4.0,Looks just like the photo....comes folded up in a small bag but didn't do any damage to the hat. All the studs are secure and it fits and looks great. Sure to get compliments. Definitely a statement piece and not an everyday piece. People will talk about you if you wear it all the time....lol just saying! But overall this is definitely a good buy and a great price. Here in new York they are 40 bucks and up!!!
4.0,"My son wears a 2.5 shoe (almost 7 yo) and these in a size 2 are pretty big on him. He doesn't walk out of them, but almost. I would say they run a half to a full size larger than marked. Removable sole comes out every now & then but easy to put back in. Gives a little bit of cushion to bottom but not much. He says they're comfortable, and pretty easy to get on and off himself (possibly because they're a little big though). And they're pretty cute too."
4.0,"I'm a sunglasses connoisseur, I have 20+ pairs ranging from cheap gas station shades to Ray-Bans. These land on the lower side of that scale, but that doesn't mean they're bad...<br />For the price, I think these are a great deal! They'd be great for camping or fishing, where breakage or loss is a greater risk than normal. You could lose or break a pair of these, still have a backup pair, and you wouldn't be out hundreds like a pair of Ray-Bans would cost you.<br />The tint could be darker, but it's certainly adequate. The polarized lenses came free of scratches or imperfections, and the optical quality is very good.<br />Upon arrival, they were very tight, arguably too tight; they have broken in with use and can now be opened with just one hand. They don't feel cheap or loose after break-in, which can be the case with inexpensive sunglasses.<br />The carrying case is nice, it can fit both pairs of glasses (it's tight, but not too bad) and comes with a large cleaning cloth. I use the cloth to separate the glasses and reduce the chance of scratches.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are a great buy and should definitely be an addition to your fishing/camping/hiking adventure loadout. They're cheap enough to loan out or lose, but high quality enough to gift and will last a while. I would recommend these sunglasses!"
4.0,"I originally ordered a XXL, but, I gave it to my 25 year old, 100lb cousin. I reordered in a XXXXL, yes 4X, and it fits perfectly. I'm a US M/L, 5 2, 150lbs."
4.0,BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT. THE PERSON LOVED IT.
4.0,"The dress is cute and thick, not see through. It kind of flares out at the bottom but no big deal, for 9$ it's a cute dress. However, I didn't receive the free choker that was mentioned in the description :("
4.0,These slacks are comfortable & pretty.
4.0,"Pretty colors, great price for the assortment. very small. The backs are very tiny also, have to be careful handling."
4.0,Bought for my 15 yr/old for her birthday. Very cute. Strange thing is that it’s a ring but listing says pendant.
4.0,"This shirt runs small, but the shirt is thick, which he likes."
4.0,Overall nice quality hat but the Adjustable snap buttons on the back don’t stay in place very well.
4.0,These earrings look just like the photo.  They are a good size and a nice color.  Exactly what I ordered.
4.0,The team looked great!  I have no idea what the functionality is though.  I guess hey are supposed to help w/balance.  I was just happy I didn't have to shell out $20  at the field.
4.0,it's good for above freezing temperatures
4.0,Nice dress a little smaller than I expected.
4.0,Fits good! Just don’t throw it in the dryer or it will shrink
4.0,Very comfortable... nice stretch. Very flattering. NOT sweat proof. Quite sheer. Overall- good.
4.0,Unsure if this will work for me......as it is wider in the mid section then I like.....but the seller worked with me to satisfy.  Great seller!...
4.0,Nice material.  Good quality
4.0,LIKED EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ITEM.
4.0,"They make me dizzy if I move my head to much when using and if something is too close to my face the two eye holes don't connect in the middle, if that makes sense. But I work at a desk all day so I love the option to lay flat and read or watch tv!"
4.0,"This mask looks simply amazing in the dark .I would have given it 5 stars ,but the mask came with a small Crack on the side"
4.0,I have this sweater in 3 different colors in size 2XL.  I was a size 16-18 when I originally ordered the 2XL's and they fit great.  After losing 37 pounds I now wear a size 14-16 and my 2XL's are too big so I ordered a size Large.  I was disappointed that it was really small.  The arms were way too tight and it barely fit around my body.  I am returning it and trying an XL.
4.0,A super close dupe to the real Gucci version. Would give it 5 stars but after having them for 3 weeks one of the screws became loose and even after using a screwdriver to tighten they have never been the same :(. But very good for the price!
4.0,Bought for under seat size requirements.
4.0,"Head wrap is more of a mustard color vs turmeric, however still able to use it."
4.0,Love it! Just wish there was more credit card slots.
4.0,"Love them but they stretch out and dont stay up, constantly having to pull them up."
4.0,"I purchased in size Small. I'm female, but like some others have commented, the women's hoodies run small and short so I though I'd try the men's version. I typically wear a women's medium in relaxed basic t-shirts and a comfortable size 6 in American Eagle brand jeans. A men's Hanes basic sweatshirt in size small is a comfortable relaxed fit on me. This hoodie in small was too big and baggy, in my opinion it would be a good fit for a women's size large. It's definitely longer than the women's version in both body and sleeves. It says ""slim fit"" but even on a guy, I wouldn't consider it slim as it's kind of boxy. It's a lighter weight hoodie and doesn't have the soft fluff lining. Overall, it's well made and good quality, I'd try again if they had a smaller size."
4.0,"Didn’t come with the earring thing that hold it in place. However I was able to use it fine, other than that it was great."
4.0,Love that it folds into a tiny pouch. Only wish it had a zipper
4.0,These fit perfect however I almost wish that they were a little bit more closed off because if it twists around a little you can see the end. I’ve included only photos of the silver color because that’s what I had at the time but they’re all great and true to color.
4.0,"I agree with other comments that say these run a bit small. I normally wear 10.5. I ordered an 11M, and they're definitely snug, though not tight. I do have to struggle a bit to get them on my feet, and can't just slip them on, which is a little disappointing as I'm 8 months pregnant :) Beyond that, they're wonderfully soft, warm, and comfy, and I'm very happy to have them! I recommend them, but order up at least a half size in length and width."
4.0,"a bit smaller than I thought, but i love the piece and the detail."
4.0,Just received these sandals. They are very cute with just a smattering of sparkle. I’d love to keep them but my toes are falling off the sides. Big and small. The heel<br />Bed is perfect. It’s just the toe bed is very narrow. The length is perfect though at my normal 9.5 med. I’m afraid if I go up a size they’ll be too big. Bummer. Liked em otherwise.
4.0,"Just started wearing, comfortable."
4.0,Complements my skin tone. Doesn't pull my lil earlobes down. Very pleased. Would like a brighter color.
4.0,"Haven't worn them out yet, but wore them briefly around the house. They seem super comfy and were true to size!<br /><br />EDIT: Went on vacation for one week and wore these every single day. They are incredibly comfortable! The only issue is that after the one week, the front of the sandal was pretty worn out. For a vacation they are great, but probably won't last the whole season. Honestly though, they were totally worth it. I'll probably buy one or two more pairs to wear this summer."
4.0,"I bought this about 6 months ago and the coating on the pink zipper pull and snap are flaking off. I also can't get my ID out of the slot without prying it out using a screwdriver or something, so I keep it in a different one. It is also a lotttttt bigger than expected! You can fit anything and everything in this wallet. Overall it's really cute and awesome and seems to withstand the wear and tear."
4.0,"Pretty nice fit, actually. The four-star rating is there because ther is no adjustability in the design except to bend the mounting tab, and the tab snaps into place on the fender without fasteners in a kind of “hopeful” way. Seems to work, but I will probably add a pop rivet some time in the future after some proof-rides. I do wish it was wider for my 2.5” wide street tires. They would NOT work with the 3” knobbies this bike came with, as the knobs would fling stuff off each knob, and not the center of my smooth tires. The fenders should work. No more wet butt and dirty water bottle! I did add two small pads of industrial rubber under the mounting tab to stabilize it on my non-flat mounting bridge. (Which is drilled about 3/8” OFF CENTER! Grrr…. (Not the fenders fault, but I do wish I could slide it left a bit. I may end up ovalizing the tab hole…)"
4.0,"Pretty tight, but seem sturdier than my Lularoe and just as soft. Love the floral print. Don't regret the purchase."
4.0,Bought for my husband. He said belt loops were to high up which he did not. Other then that he satisfied. Very comfy but he wished it was little longer.
4.0,"Great shirt, probably one of my favorites. The only thing is that it tends to slip off the shoulder and its a little frustrating having to continue to pull it back onto my shoulder, and at one point, I got a horrible sunburn because of it. Otherwise, great shirt."
4.0,This is ridiculously comfortable and flowing in a flattering way. Feels like a t-shirt dress without turning you into a shapeless sack. It's perfect for those slightly cool spring and fall days.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:6954fb43a2872b55bb11f0d689990624]] The bottom material feels cheap but the top is comfortable and easily adjustable. Honestly it is 100% worth it to become the butterfly fairy princess you have always dreamed of being.
4.0,"The bag is ideal if you are looking for a day of hiking and it can house all the essentials you'd like to take along.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Small in size but expands to offer a lot of room (Photo with another bag with a cap on it gives you an idea of the size)<br />- Has almost no weight of its own yet the built seems sturdy<br />- Lots of pockets/compartments<br />- Well Built Zippers<br />- Tags on the side to hang your sunglasses from<br />-Water Resistant material<br />- Decent contouring on the back for ventilation<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Would've been nice if it had a water bladder included but you can always use one of your own<br />- My MacBook Air (13&#34;) would not fit in it, but any size of tablet/laptop under that size should easily fit<br />-Padding on the straps could be better<br /><br />Overall: For the price this is a good bag. I would recommend it."
4.0,"These shoes are very cute, you can see the glue on the sides, but I'm not too picky! My puppy is 2 pounds and size one fit her very good. They do slip off when she plays but that may change as she gets use to them and stops pulling them off."
4.0,Bought a large my usual size and fits great. Great price as well.
4.0,"Great quality. A little short, but I'm keeping it.<br /><br />Good price & quick delivery. Happy."
4.0,We actually ordered two of this dress.  The first one my daughter didn't order according to her measurements and it was too big.  The second one I helped her order by the posted measurements and it fit perfectly.  The lace is soft and not stiff.  The quality is good.  It looks just like the posted dress.  I know there has been some concern about quality when buying dresses online.  You do not need to be concerned with this dress.  The train on the back of the dress is the perfect length.  Short in the front for dancing.  Long in the back for elegance.  My daughter bought it to wear for a winter formal.
4.0,Great fabric but runs a size small
4.0,"Really beautiful skirt. Color true to photo. Does run small! I’m 5’11” 115lbs with a 25” waist and the size xsmall was just a little too tight for comfort. I have been finding size smalls have been falling off or not sitting at my waist so I tried the xs but I should have listened that it ran small! The pleats are gorgeous and the fabric is really nice. LOVE the functioning drawstring. Will be ordering again in a size small. Pay attention to sizing but really lovely item; don’t hesitate! Can’t wait to pair with a denim jacket and all sorts of other fun looks.<br />Great length. Again, amazing color! Just small."
4.0,It's wide at the arm holes - to the point where it buckles out.
4.0,"This is a lovely dress,  well made and comfortable.  The fabric is a nice quality and not too thin. Runs small so be sure to size up! I'm a med 180lbs. I ordered a large and it fit perfectly."
4.0,"I was concerned about quality and sizing after reading some reviews. I just received the item today and was pleasantly surprised with the look, fit, and length of the tank. It could be little longer in the front imo but it has the look I wanted.<br />No quality issues yet, I will see how it hold up after washing it and update the review with any issues.<br /><br />Height 5’8 athletic build 170lbs"
4.0,"I loved it. Perfect fit, love the color. Bought it for our family Christmas photos."
4.0,love it but to big
4.0,I really liked this costume; but it was a little too short.
4.0,"Nice material, but it was large! Had to get it taken in"
4.0,"This fit as expected. The jacket material is soft and thin. It's also unlined. I liked it because it was cute and cheap.<br /><br />I bought it to wear one weekend out of the month as a uniform jacket. I work craft shows where I either sit or stand.  I've worn it 4 times and noticed the stitching was coming apart on the pocket. I didn't even use the pockets.<br /><br />I have machine washed it twice in a laundry bag and hung it to dry. The jacket may have said hand wash and if so that may have saved the pocket and extended the life.<br /><br />Regardless, I'm taking a star because it was thinner than expected. Nothing wrong with that, I just needed something a little warmer.<br /><br />Overall, it's a really cute jacket with a cuter fit. It is delicate (or cheap) so spot or hand wash it."
4.0,Decent watch for the price. I have had it now for a few weeks and I have had no broblems with it. The band is a bit flimsy but hey it's a watch that costs less than $30. Definitely a good buy for the money.
4.0,Good find siz was off had to order bigger size
4.0,I ordered up one size from my regular cardigan size and it fit as expected because of that. It is not a fit I think I could button while wearing by any means even ordering up a size. It is more fitted in the waist area that alot of longer cardigans but as long as you plan to leave it open it fits great! Looks adorable with everything I have paired it with so far! It's also not so thick that you are hot all day either!
4.0,The bag is beautiful but too small for my needs. Looks bigger than it is.
4.0,"Haven’t really used it on its own for my period more like a back up with a pad on. I do think they’re absorbent because when I go to the gym, it does hold a lot of sweat. I feel more comfortable working out during my period because of these underwear I feel it would be able to prevent accidents. I ordered a medium so it can fit nice and snug I like that it’s high waisted and because of the size helps compress my bloated stomach"
4.0,"The one with the pair of scissors came in thinner than the rest. Also, one of its ends stopped tightening so it fell off somewhere. But they're really pretty and truly stainless steel."
4.0,"I'm 5'4, 130lbs. usually wear small but I should had size up.  It fit and the material is stretchy but if you have any kind of sleeve shirt under it will make it tight around your arms and your sleeves will bunch up under the sweater.  I didn't care to send it back because I will use it for the spring and summer time with tanks and dresses."
4.0,This is a very nice watch band but was a little too masculine for me.
4.0,It's a bit thinner than what the picture made me think. Other than that it is great! I use it as a midi ring & it looks fabulous! I've had it for a few weeks & hasn't tarnished my finger yet.
4.0,Fit is accurate for a medium. I wear either small or medium tops.  And the medium fits well. This product is alos made well.
4.0,Flattering design.  Comfortable in hot weather material.
4.0,"Fits somewhat small, but I prefer a tighter fit for sports bras anyway. Decent support because of the tighter fit. Holds up alright in the washer and dryer, although the inserts fall apart immediately and should not be machine washed or dried."
4.0,"Material is a little flimsy, pockets won't hold much without getting distorted, but the color is good and I like the style."
4.0,"This is a really pretty anklet, it's a little big on me, so I need to have it adjusted by someone other than me who absolutely is horrible at doing that kind of thing.<br /><br />When it fits, I will love them.  The turquoise that is on this anklet is a very vibrant color, & I do really like that the flowers are as detailed as they are. Even though they are small flowers, I like the fact that they weren't just kind of thrown on the anklet for a little extra appeal. The design of the anklet is pretty and looks great on my skin tone. This is a 2 piece anklet, the beaded one is separate and that one actually fits perfectly.<br /><br />When I did squeeze the chain together to see what it would look like fitted, I liked the way that it hung. It's perfect for wearing flip flops, which is great considering that I live in Florida. And flip flops are our state's shoe, lol.<br /><br />I really don't think that you can really expect any more for the price of this anklet. It seems to be well made, it's quality for its price, and it's pretty. Which beats out a lot of things, finding a pretty turquoise anklet for this price is not as easy as you would think. I tried.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review."
4.0,Super kit
4.0,"Shirt fits great and looks great, just wish the picture and print was brighter. It looks a little faded. Plus it arrived late. If I could do 3 and a half stars I would."
4.0,"4 stars only because if I would have listened to some reviews that said this fit normal I would have been returning. Luckily I ordered a size up. I am 5'3&#34; and 115 pounds and the medium is &#34;sung&#34;. I can still wear sweater with it but it is tight when I do. Besides that, this is actually a good jacket for the price. It seems to be very warm and has just the right amount of &#34;puffyness&#34;.  It has some shape in the waist and is a good length on me, not too long not too short. The faux fur isn't terrible looking either. If you live somewhere where its cold and snows all the time, you may consider investing in a nicer coat. BUT I live in the south so I just needed a jacket for a weekend trip that didn't break the bank, so this was perfect!"
4.0,Love it! Really cute not the best quality!
4.0,I’m a size 22-24 and bought the 26-28 and it is loose but not unflattering. Wash on the lightest setting possible! I get lots of compliments
4.0,"Soft material, great fit."
4.0,"This would have been better as a cotton shirt. Polyester just doesn't look very good no matter what you do to it. As the listing suggested, I sized up for a baggy fit. Unfortunately, this made the cute little twist at the center of the hem in front hang right at my crotch. So maybe don't size up. It's a little bit...not shiny exactly, but it's got a sheen to it. There was no odor from the material or packaging. The color seems true to the listing photo; a muted brown scheme camo. It's not grey camo, even though it sort of looks like it in some photos. The sleeves are wide enough, and sized up, hang to my elbow. The cutouts are a nice size, and show off a shoulder tattoo well. The round collar is a good size, open enough to wear a necklace if you want, but you won't have to keep adjusting it to keep your bra from showing.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what it is about this other than maybe the material, but it just doesn't hang well. It fits more like a camp shirt than a t-shirt. However it would look cute under a jacket or with a punk belt over it."
4.0,"I didn't expect too much from this product, and the metal that goes through the ear is very bendable and breakable, however that is highly expected when the earrings are priced so cheap. Definitely worth the money, however."
4.0,"These sweatpants are comfortable, warm and made of nice, thick material.  The waistband is a bit wide with both elastic and a drawstring which is unusual.  The gray is a nice light color.  These pants are sized a bit small, so order at least one size larger than you would usually wear.  Overall, comfortable and good for the colder months."
4.0,"I wanted a FitBit wristband that didn't look like a FitBit wristband- this is perfect! Looks like a quasi-expensive watch now. The only downside (and the reason it didn't get five stars) is the way it latches when you put it on is a bit cumbersome the first few times you do it, and occasionally the overflow actually overflows out of the band. Otherwise, really great!"
4.0,"I love this dress but it is quite sheer... the top part has inner lining but not anything beneath the waist, so it was kinda see through"
4.0,Strong and durable. It's also easy to remove.
4.0,I love this long cardigan! It is soft and so stylish! I got a S
4.0,Got lots of compliments. I like it
4.0,new sox!!
4.0,really great product for a very reasonable price.  seem sturdy.  Used a beach with a hat and worked fine.  Graded so you can read.
4.0,"Ok I have had them for a week. First they are Sperry's that says they are a good sandal. I like that I slip my feet in and I don't have a piece between my toes, which for me causes some soreness. They are a little on the small side for size, I wear a size 14, 15 sometimes a 16 depending on the manufacturer, I should be a 14 and these were 14 but they are a touch tight but close enough that with some wear they should wear in. Any smaller at all and I would have sent them back. So make sure about the refund policy!!!"
4.0,Delivered on Easter Sunday!  I'm impressed and love how soft and comfortable it is.  Want to see how it washes.  Looks great on.
4.0,Shorter than expected but nice fabric.
4.0,"The quality of this bag, as usual with all my Vera's before this one, is exceptionally well. It makes a nice addition to my colorful collection. I didn't expect it to be as large as it is. It's essentially a half Vera Tote. A little too big for an everyday purse. I loved it though and wil keep it for day trips, road trips, and a carry on purse for flights."
4.0,"I got this as a replacement for the original band on Seiko Sportura kinetic. The original Seiko band was c**p. This band is great. It's a nice beefy slice of top grain leather that I measure as 158 mils thick (Google says that's about 4mm). Easy to install. A little stiff at first, but I put on some Doc Martin's Wonder Balsam for leather, and it instantly became a bit more pliable, and the Doc's balsam is supposed to help water proof, so it may improve the band's resistance to sweat. I won't give it five stars unless it rides through a few months without significantly falling apart, so 4 is the best I can do out of the box. Hopefully I'll remember to update this."
4.0,A little light weight and flimsy. Even for Kids. Comes with great case though.
4.0,"I got this bracelet for my daughter it fit nicely, the chain is hooks just fine and the heart locket is very nice."
4.0,"I bought it because it was inexpensive and would be nice for work.  Fits fine, quality is fine for the price."
4.0,"Mine came defective, a rod is missing on one side, other than that I love this umbrella and have been using it for a costume prop"
4.0,Very cute! Good quality. Sturdy case that comes with nice cleaning cloth. Took a minute to get use to the polarized lens; puts a psychedelic rainbow glaze on somethings.
4.0,Somewhat smaller in the waist.  Length is fits as expected.
4.0,Nice size. Material easily wiped. Cute lego
4.0,"Es delgada la tela pero practico para usar en frío con chaqueta encima, es bonito"
4.0,Bought for husband (even went up a size) but they turned out better for me. Not loose enough for a man who has muscular thick thighs.
4.0,"Very comfy, EZ fit but hand-wash only"
4.0,"I am using the cash clip to handle the overflow of cards, such as my insurance cards, passport card, auto rental car and so on.  The design is such that it grabs and hold the cards in quite well and takes up little space.  Only downside is you probably will take them all out to find the card you want unless you put the ones you access the most at one end or the other.  The belt clip is also useful.  If you only carry 5 -8 cards, you don't need a wallet.  You can clip in a few bills along with the card.. I like it."
4.0,"It fit well, i have nothing bad to say, the girls were all in there and well tacked in."
4.0,"Started to rust after about 8 months, but pretty good otherwise."
4.0,Good quality merchandise.
4.0,"These work fine and feel sturdy. However, the plastic seems a bit rough. They are ok but prefer another brand Elvex that is a few bucks more but feel lighter and better made."
4.0,"Has a small little star (*) looking scratch on the front where Deathwing's horn is, makes me wonder how it got there but maybe it's just the leather. All in all it's a nice product."
4.0,A little large.  But sooo soft
4.0,Super cute and soft! I'm 5'4 and 125lbs and it fits great! Only thing I don't like is it bunches up in pubic area but it doesn't look bad.
4.0,I wear a 36DD and it was way to revealingThe dress for really nice everywhere else and may have worked had I had fashion tape to hold the dress in place and not have my bra show
4.0,"I ordered one size up, because of what the reviews said, it is one size to big. I love the style/cut of this top, so I will have it altered. So Seems sized right. Love it."
4.0,"Well made and works well. Heel doesn't insert all the way, so may not work with large boots."
4.0,Very cute! A little long but fits great besides the length!
4.0,"Nice piece. Beware this is not so much of a womens watch. Swatch describes it as unisex. The face and bracelet are wide. Poor packaging from seller, no case."
4.0,"Fabric is a bit harsh, BUT for the price, they fit very well. However, I wear a size 2 and the 4/6 for perfectly, so keep that in mind. Go up a size, as with a lot of products made in Asia (not for a American brands) they tend to run smaller, as the people themselves are smaller. These are not pants you want to be on the small side lol"
4.0,She loved it.  I have no other comments since it wasn’t for me.
4.0,I found them to be well worth the money. Some are a little to large for my taste but there where plenty in the set so I was pleased with my purchase.
4.0,"It fits snug,  but that's because only the xs size was available (I'm a size 2).  Definitely a warmer weather weight.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the snug fit and the absence of a two way zipper"
4.0,"Product works just as it suggests. The durable and strength of the product is not as strong as I hoped, but so far I am very pleased."
4.0,"I bought this to go with my spin seat cover for extra padding during spin class. It was definitely worth the purchase. Like other users, I ordered a size larger than I normally would (size 12 - large fits perfectly). My only complaint is that it still doesn't cover all of the areas I needed padding for while sitting on my bike. I think that is the design of the type of pants and not these shorts in particular, however."
4.0,I recommend buying it a size bigger. But the material isn't bad like most say.
4.0,Cute summer dress! Looks just like picture (the light blue with white flowers) and silky material drapes curves without accentuating them. True to size. Can dress it up with a belt. Length is about 4 inches below knee.
4.0,Great batcherlet party gift
4.0,Very light so comfortable to wear. The few of the tassel strands will not stay flat. Because length is long very visible with long hair
4.0,This dress fit better than expected. It was one of my first clothing purchases on Amazon.
4.0,"It fits pretty good, not great. A little loose around the waist for my taste. The sleeves are gorgeous but would definitely get itchy if you wore them all night or sitting somewhere for too long. I haven't a clue how you would go about washing this but I'm sure a dry cleaning would do the trick."
4.0,I thought this one had an inner cover but no. Still looks nice.
4.0,Not quite as dark as the original but fit perfectly!!  I would purchase again.  I was most impressed with the packaging of the lenses.  I keep the original lenses in there now.
4.0,Size is great. Not crazy about the material  but great for the price. Would love it in leather.
4.0,"Solid tie, nice material."
4.0,Luv..it match my moccasins perfect...
4.0,"Super comfortable,  a little bigger than I expected. It's still super cute. I would recommend it if you're looking for comfortable, fashionable overalls."
4.0,"I guess I give this 4.4 or so, so far (subject to change).<br /><br />Pros:<br />The padded frame basically solves the light leakage from the sides and top and bottom problem.<br />Decent looks, in my estimation for affordable sunglasses.<br />Very good fit for me (took a risk by ordering these over the net).<br />Very good price for what are in my view decent sunglasses.<br /><br />Cons/could improve<br />Not polarized (is the brand name deliberately misleading?).<br /><br />Open questions<br />I haven't decided yet what I think overall of the optics and aside from driving safety, I am wary of protecting the health of my eyes, so it is a long-term important matter to me.<br /><br />Personal preference:<br />I'd prefer an option of non-black frames.<br />This particular model tends toward yellow/brown view from within the glasses, which I am not really used to, and am a bit wary of.  I'll see what I think in a few months."
4.0,Runs very small. Meant for warm weather. Needs a camisole and a slip. Very pretty. Elegant.
4.0,Good product and fits well
4.0,Soft material good size ( I have a huge 2 y.o. son so I ordered a 3T like his other shirts and its perfect!) Was nervous it would shrink since it has fairly thin (but not too thin) soft material I was afraid would shrink but it did not! Worked perfectly her my little man's second birthday!
4.0,but is warm
4.0,UPDATE: The costumer service is simply amazing. They was more than willing to work with me on satisfying my needs as the costumer. They even sent a different shirt that is well made and awesome! For that I took my one star to four!<br /><br />Poorly made. The bottom of the shirt flared out on both side. After washing the seams were completely twisted and the hem noticeable uneven. It is a nice thin non clingy material however.
4.0,"Very cute, though I wish they'd have been a full peppermint shape rather than a flat white surface on the back."
4.0,Fast shipping and looks great
4.0,It's a good shirt but it fits me like a dress. I cut it though so it's fine now
4.0,Item was as it appeared EXCEPT the long handle was not with the product.  Cannot br crossbody if you don't have a long strap.
4.0,Nice maxi dress. But the waist is a little high. Not at my true waistline.
4.0,"very nice professional dress, very comfortable to wear"
4.0,Cute hat and very warm. So happy with it. Like a beanie much more stylish
4.0,"These earrings were light and matched the description just right, they held decently as need and had great designs. Could fall off with too much movement but not a major problem."
4.0,"I got a medium I'm a size 36C and should've gotten a large, but I love the design. It's very comfortable and cute."
4.0,"The shirt is super cute and soft, but I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered. I agree with other reviews that said this runs small. Luckily, returns and exchanges are easy enough and I’ll just exchange for a size up."
4.0,"Love this sweaterr, can't wait until its cool enough to wear it . prices is right  !"
4.0,"I wear size 16 petite / Bust 40B, so bought the large, however I believe that the medium would have been a better fit. Not bad, nice casual top, I like it!"
4.0,I bought these in a size medium and they are a little too tight for my liking. The material is super soft and I wear them to sleep in. I highly recommend this seller though. The product is good quality.
4.0,Quality is great. Wayyyyyyy too much fabric ugh.
4.0,"I loved everything about this dress but i followed what previous posters wrote about sizing and the size chart, so i went up a size.  Way too big!  i should have sized down!"
4.0,Cute ring for the price.
4.0,"This is the first time I have bought a display item like this.  The only issue is that the curve of the glass seems to distort the view of the watch.  Looking at a distance is not much of a problem, but up close becomes more prominent.  But for the price, I am satisfied. Could have spent more--preferred not too."
4.0,"Such cute socks, great for a gift and they are affordable."
4.0,"I purchased the XXL, and was just all round too big.  nice though!"
4.0,"I like it, wish it was a little thicker"
4.0,"I really like this dress but it is not a midi! I am only 5’3” and it just barely fits below my knee. And I am short legged! But everything else about this dress is wonderful. I like the fullness of the skirt and other than the length being a bit too short for a midi, it is a great buy and is well made. I do recommend to all women who like regular length dresses!"
4.0,This are quickly becoming my favorite stud earrings. I didn't give 5 stars because they come with a silicone backing.  Nonetheless I was able to purchase 14k gold earring backs from Amazon to secure them properly.
4.0,"This bracelet was a little tight for my wrist, but not TOO TIGHT for me to keep it.  I hope that it keeps its lovely shiny look.  I will order the silver one next."
4.0,Clips hold reasonably well and patterns are attractive.  Recommended.
4.0,I do love this shirt but it was a bit large.
4.0,"Very nicely constructed and clasps securly, but not for thick wrists. It's shorter than a standard wrist band."
4.0,Fits weird. Sleeves are tight and so is the bust area. Wouldnt recommend for someone with a big bust
4.0,Cute dress. Runs big
4.0,"I wear this hood when I'm cycling in 30-40 degree temperatures. While you can wear it in the 'ninja' style, it becomes a little difficult to breathe, so wearing the hood with your nose exposed is a compromise that keeps you fairly warm without feeling you can't catch your breath."
4.0,Shipping took to long  wife loved  item
4.0,"Love the Umbrella.  It’s a bit heavy, but it’s sturdy and definitely large enough to keep me covered."
4.0,Great looking glasses. Nice oversized frames. Be gentle though. The frames don’t feel real sturdy and I don’t think these will hold up to much abuse so treat them gently and you’ll look good in them for a long time to come. They have a nice case to keep them from getting scratched up. My daughter refused to model these for my review so I wore them. Although I look great in them these are for women.
4.0,"The fit is true to size, but the fabric was a little more sheer than my previous tuxedo shirt.  I use it for ushering and will be wearing a vest so it won't matter too much.  Seems well made."
4.0,Very cute but flimsy and cheap looking.
4.0,"I like dress and material, but fit a little snug."
4.0,"I thought the dress would be a bit more casual than it was. The fabric is soooo comfortable. It's defiantly winter wear, and I've worn it to engagement parties and the theater. I'm glad I bought it, it just wasn't what I expected."
4.0,It's somewhat on the smaller size.
4.0,Runs somewhat large. But I have athletic body . Not muscular.  Is very light and the fabric has lot of pores. I have been wearing them to play soccer at very high temperatures like 100 F and is the most refreaching than other top  tanks or tshirts  I have tried. If you want something fresh this will make it.<br />But nott very fashionable.
4.0,I’m pleased
4.0,"These lenses fit my glasses, which is exactly what I wanted."
4.0,"exactly as pictured! great looking chain.<br /><br />I wanted to give 5 stars, yet I deducted a star because sometimes the links can begin to &quot;lay&quot; the wrong way and mess up the beautiful rope pattern this chain can display. I feel the chain could have been made with more links or clamped down to prevent them from &quot;laying&quot; the wrong way, but you can sorta fix it by rolling the chain to get the links back into perfect alignment. But its not a big deal, I just reserve 5 stars for products that exceed expectation.<br /><br />It was fun to wear."
4.0,"I bought these as a gift, he loved them!!"
4.0,"Super cute, but a little large.  I'm 5'7&#34; wear size 4/6 medium, and this was still a bit on the larger size. It's cute, but could have the potential to look like a mumu on someone who is petite."
4.0,Looks a little more goofy than I anticipated
4.0,"I am 5'3 and a DDD. I got the large and fits great. I think I could have gotten a medium, it's not fitted and has some room."
4.0,"I had already bought the bracelet which is super nice, added the necklace to have a set. This would make a very nice gift."
4.0,"I initially gave this a poor review because it shrank a bit and changed shape on first wash, but I decided to wear it around the house and the fabric relaxed quite a bit. The fabric is a little strange. When the fabric gets wet, it changes a bit once dry, but if you wear if for a while, it relaxes again. I have now purchased 2 of these dresses, one in a size smaller than this one, and, although they aren’t really well made (the seams on the first one are falling apart), they are so comfortable with a flattering cut. I am planning on buying another to take to Hawaii with me."
4.0,"I ordered according to the size reccomendations, fits all over very nice- the armpits are a little snugger than I would prefer, but not too bad! Super comfy and warm"
4.0,"Good shoe! Not flats, not too high."
4.0,"I am 5'2"" 105 lbs and I got the Small, it definitely fits like an extra small and is just a little tighter in the butt than what I prefer but otherwise fits great everywhere else! Lifeguard complimented it the first time I wore it! I wanted the long sleeves to keep me warm when I am not swimming laps so I still need to test it out more to see if it works but overall a great quality for the awesome price!"
4.0,Again a beautiful and eloquent ring it is beautifully designed but it is also cute it takes up your entire knuckle and and not for someone who's looking for a small ring or something that's not going to be noticed
4.0,Works fine. Just wish they had these for Ram Truck in orange
4.0,i like them very much they keep the glare out my eyes.
4.0,A little tight in the chest area but it's Soo pretty!
4.0,"Runs small, usually I wear 8 1/2 and this shoes were really narrow for my feet. I had to order a size 9 and felt a lot better."
4.0,"Waist ban rolled a bit, and kinda tight, I got a large. Top is soft and comfortable. I found it kinda hot to sleep in. But ok for lounging actually wore top outside to store."
4.0,I bought these napkins for my kitchen. These napkins are very soft and easy to use . They absorbs quickly. I dropped water on my kitchen shelf and these napkins were able to absorb all the water very quickly and efficiently.
4.0,This top is very cute and I love the design. A must wear for me!
4.0,👍😶
4.0,"I do love all of these rings. I only have one complaint. I was able to mix and match the spikes and all, but the red ones for some reason seemed much more difficult.. I had no other issues though. And none of the spikes or balls become loose when wearing for multiple days, opposed to ones I’ve gotten from Spencer’s and Hot Topic, or other Amazon sellers. I never had to tighten them over and over again! :)<br /><br />Love these so so so much, I will be buying more in the future just so I can have even more of these reliable little rings!!"
4.0,"A bit loose on the straps. I will hand sewn adjust it. I bought size 6 for my teenager & looks lovely on her. It’s arrived ahead of time. I will need to iron coz it’s crinkled. It’s a bit plain, snowy white colour but my child will add gold belt. Pretty decent affordable price. She will wearing to a formal birthday party."
4.0,It’s a beautiful dress and it fit perfectly. The only problem was that some of the beading was falling off but was an easy fix. I recommend it for homecoming and formal dances.
4.0,cleans my jewelry well.
4.0,"Inexpensive, perfect for the occasion"
4.0,The shirt is very cute and the fabric is good quality. My only complaint is that the shirt is a bit small. I normally wear an XL but ordered the XXL just in case and it is super tight.
4.0,Does tend to stick to your nose
4.0,Works well and keeps me dry on wet jogs. Rums a little big
4.0,It's cute I like the dress!
4.0,"nice size, gud buy"
4.0,"I t works but little tight for the laptop and all the folders. I make it work, but it's tight."
4.0,"A very pretty set!  Sparkly and adapts to just about any color that I wear. The pendant and ring are about the same size. The earrings are smaller and the post on the back is very flimsy. I could not put the metal backs on the posts without breaking them, so I used some silicone backs from another earring set and they worked great. The chain is a basic box chain. I receive many compliments on the pendant when I wear it.  I feel that this set was worth the money!"
4.0,somewhat tight at the top
4.0,WORK AS EXPECTED ALTHOUGH I WORK 12 HOUR SHIFTS AND THEY WILL TEND TO SLIDE DOWN THE LEG
4.0,"Fits amazingly, love it"
4.0,"Fits a little tight due to type of material. Love the draw string neckline on one shoulder, it gives the dress a wow factor. Comfortable and good for vacations/packing."
4.0,Fit and look👍sharp!
4.0,Lightweight yet warm. Great for hiking!
4.0,"I loved how these fit, if i had to critique anything about the fit it would be that they are a little loose around the knee. These were great, but after about 8 wears they did start to pill a bit even when I would air dry after the wash. But, I still wear these all the time with the black color, the pilling is not that noticeable."
4.0,"My grandson was tickled with it, that was the goal. Thanks!"
4.0,Love the cap but the elastic that comes ove the ears leaves my ears super sore! I had to leave my ears out and I looked like an Elf lol or tuck it over my ears which made putting my glasses and mask difficult. I did loosen it a bit and that did help so I will give it another day or so and see if I can figure out a way to make it comfortable. Love the fabric and the look! The sweat band really make a huge difference! It keeps my forehead nice and dry! Not giving up just yet on it just need to figure out the ear situation because it is my prettiest cap!
4.0,"Pretty awesome sweaters, unfortunately they are a little large but nothing to complain about, I mean come on that extra sweater means extra comfort"
4.0,Ordered 2xl for my 40D daughter who wears a 12/14 bottom.  Too small in bust and waist.  Lovely and classy dress though.
4.0,"I absolutely love this bag! Loved so much, this is my second purchase"
4.0,Tastes amazing.  Cost is not worth it.
4.0,"Cute little dress for the price. A bit see through, you will need a slip. The small was too short and a bit snug for my taste so I will be sizing up. I weigh 135, 5ft 4."
4.0,My hairdresser loved this little pin. Quality not the best but to be expected for the price.
4.0,Stays in place!
4.0,"I love the way high wasted swimsuits look on some women. This is the first one that I've ever owned. It is very pretty. The cherry design on black is very cute and retro, pin up girl style.<br />I ordered a medium and it fits just slightly smaller than I expected on the top. I've been working out and eating healthier, so maybe it will fit better in a few weeks.<br />I do love that it doesn't show off my tummy since I'm not very happy with the way my post partum belly still looks when it's exposed. This swimsuit gives you a sexy, but still covered up look and I really like that. Also the top has a little more support than my other swimsuit, so that is nice too. The quality of material is good too.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."
4.0,Bought this for use when visiting the UK which I do often. The wallet is on the large size to accommodate the larger banknotes used in the UK.<br />The wallet has a lot of slots for credit cards. I do need something to carry all the coins you receive in the UK 1 pound and 2 pound coins. Wallets I have seen with a zipper pouch for coins are not large enough. May need a separate coin wallet<br />If using purely for US this wallet is probably too big.
4.0,I though I was buying  all alix and Ani braclets .did not say it wasnt the other three were.only found out after my Grand daughter recevied her gift
4.0,"Not bulky, good rain boots for the price."
4.0,I love these earrings. They have subtle rounded edges and a slight imperfect asymmetry that I really like. I would have given it 5 stars if the post had a notch in it to keep the back of the earring from slipping off a little better. I did purchase a pair for my mom and she loves them as much as I do.
4.0,"Got these to use as part of my 9 month olds hallower costume.  I like that one end is wider to fit over the legs better however I don't see how this would last to fit older kids as it states, even as leg warmers, as it's already tight on my baby.  And I even double checked I bought the size that is supposed to be until they are older kids.  Still cute though and will last as leg warmers for the following halloween too."
4.0,Good quality. 11 1/2 - 12 1/2 size. I'm a 12 and they're a little snug but I'm afraid the next size might be too loose.
4.0,"Adorable.  Fits great.  Warm.  Soft on the inside. Great head and ear coverage.  One of the Pom pom eats fell off immediate, though :("
4.0,"Love this top! (I got the Pacman planets design in a small) Unfortunately the item did seem to shrink just a bit after its first wash/dry, which was enough to make the sleeves just a bit too short for my taste.  Considering ordering another one in a size up."
4.0,Seems to be a pretty quality shirt. I like the color & fabric. The downside was the fit. I ordered XL instead of my usual L and it is still a little tight
4.0,Didn’t like the tag that’s sewn/stitched in to the left lower seam. Tag material is very irritating and can’t be removed completely without damaging the shirt. Otherwise it’s a great product.
4.0,So the shirt and pants are very soft and fit nicely. The shirt is a little see through.
4.0,This is one of my favorite shirts. It fits well and very warm.
4.0,"I ordered the green and it was almost exact to the picture. Love all the pockets and space for things. As described in other reviews, mine didn't have a weird smell. What I don't like is that the zipper in the middle compartment doesn't zip fully so there is a small gap, but I shouldn't lose anything out of it. It took weeks to get here. :("
4.0,I liked  it big enough thanks.
4.0,Fit as expected.  It's cheaply made but also cheaply priced.
4.0,Very good mask. Cotton material. Highly recommended. Fast shipping.
4.0,"I ordered a size up because I saw some other reviews that said it runs small, and I'm glad I did. The suit is absolutely adorable, but even a size up, it is just a bit snug. It still fits, however, so I'm going to keep it! I had to take the cups out of mine because they didn't fit, and luckily they were easy to remove. I love the bright, fun colors of this suit, and the shorts are not something I'd normally pick, but I really like them!"
4.0,"Quick dry, a pocket for everything, and just enough stretch. Size a bit smaller than expected. Bought for a backpacking trip in Thailand about 10 months ago worked great and still going strong."
4.0,Nice little bag.
4.0,"Fits well, looks good, and the quality is good. The strings on the ears are little thin, but the price reflects this. It comes with paper filters that can be inserted into a pocket in the mask. I keep this mask around when I walk my dogs at night when there seems to be most pollution in the city."
4.0,"The first one I ordered, I got it in a 3X, because I have never worn this manufacturer.  It is just fine.  Ordered the second one in a 2X.  It is perfect!"
4.0,"No stretch whatsoever, so some larger sizes would be great, but still a cute garment, even if it's a tight squeeze."
4.0,Okay I usually wear a medium and since everyone was saying it’s too small I sized up two sizes which fit for the most part perfect…I have D cups but I put a binder on and it was still a bit tight in the area but not too bad…the keychain was adorable that was thrown in but THERE WAS A RANDOM MASK IN MY PACKAGE????? Like it seemed to be used as well since there was a curly hair on it and a bit dirty??? I threw it away but jeez that was gross- but anywho the costume if ur tiny u should be fine tbh the only people that would have to worry is people midsize and up
4.0,Light and airy. Great for summer!  The characters don't look like any originals I've seen but I don't pay much attention to the kids cartoon one or now either. The material isn't super soft but not super coarse. My nephew seemed to like them and they looked really cute on him.
4.0,"Very happy with the quality of the product and the price.  I have gone through 4 pairs of Thin Optics in which I had various issues with, two pair had the nose pieces break and one pair the bridge broke.  So I’m hoping these hold up better."
4.0,"nice wallet, credit cards are tight fit but i guess will loosen with use. quick delivery, good price, a bit larger than my old wallet but with that being said the new Pabin forced me to throw away some old wallet junk that wouldn't fit in the new one...I guess a blessing in disguise...Oh and on a silly note the Thank You Card really needs someone to proof read it for spelling errors, sorry but the teacher in me caught them....&#34;descnibed&#34;, and &#34;custtomer&#34;. no excuse with spell checker everywhere..."
4.0,I was really teeter-tottering between a 3 star and a 4 star. I am very please with my purchase. My only issues is that the tigerseye are two different sizes (gauge and length) and I was really looking forward to those ones the most. And not all of the stones match (as far as the little lines going through the stone) but I guess that is just me being picky. I am happy with about 80% of them and it was worth the purchase.
4.0,Don’t even realize you have it on very comfortable
4.0,"the shirt is very cute. though it runs somewhat small in the bust area (5'1&#34; 34a 105lbs,size small),cute with a cami. Very comfortable"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:cfadd84cdfb540c5c0988e1ec09c40da]] Not as sturdy as the original  band but it works, i would  recommend this product as a replacement  for letsfit  smart watch."
4.0,Yah it’s chill
4.0,"I love the design, it is elegant and as a math geek I enjoy wearing it. I like the pewter very much. The surface is actually flat, although the picture makes it look like it is domed."
4.0,"Very cute, comfy dress! Will be perfect at Easter and at the beach. I did notice the fabric turns whiter when stretched too far; one side of the waistband does this, but doesn’t bother me too much. Fit was a little snug for the size."
4.0,Good shorts. (Sizes run a bit small)
4.0,"kinda large but still ok. My measurements are 49&#34;top,46waist,51hip. The khaki is more of a grey-ish tone then a brown. Id like to reorder and see if it comes in the same, grey-ish tone. Little pricey for such little material and capri length."
4.0,I liked that they were very inexpensive compared to the competition. The comfort is a little less than the competition but definitely not a big issue.
4.0,"Fit well, for the price  there ok."
4.0,I read sizing chart as long as you honest about what size your hips and thighs are you can order correctly I just lost 30 pounds in other things I am a smaller size did I want to order a 2x no but glad I did there beautiful and can't wait hubby and I are going on weekend fall trip perfect for it
4.0,"Top was cute the bottoms are pretty thin for pants, prob better for beach cover up"
4.0,Fit as expected. Kids love it.
4.0,"I love the bag, it's perfect for what I needed. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the purse has a horrible chemical smell. It has aired out a little, and I hope it continues to."
4.0,"Pretty sturdy, seems well made, and larger than I actually expected.  But... I haven't used it yet.  So I will try to update this when I return from my trip."
4.0,Very pretty with great material but it’s a bit big.
4.0,Happy with this shoe so far. She only wear its once a week so I can’t attest yet to how it will hold up. She says it’s comfortable and appears to be a decent quality.
4.0,"Great quality for the price, bright bold color."
4.0,My grandson is very happy with his watch I got him for Christmas.  He is always wearing it.  It works great as well as being very stylish.  We are both happy.  This was purchased through Amazon and the service was great.  Thank you Amazon.
4.0,"The cups were shaped differently than the instruction leaflet, but the clips helped me figure it out. I actually tried the cups upside down/opposite sides for a bit to see if there was a difference in look. I think my silhouette did appear a bit different, but either way, they stuck great until I took them off. They DO capture moisture, just an FYI. They'll be wet on the inside when you take them off. Overall, a great product. The 2nd time I wore them, I did notice a little bit of ""pilling"" of the silicone at the edges, but the integrity of the cups remained intact. The clips remained strong, and no ripping seen. Overall, so far, a good product for the price. I guess time will tell!"
4.0,I expected the &#34;fire mom&#34; words to be a bit more noticeable. Other than that I love it!
4.0,They are a bit larger than I expected but I like them!
4.0,My son is 10 and wears a 5 or 6 depending on what type of shoes.  He loves using this during summer!
4.0,The way it fit. I don’t like that the outfit doesn’t have a tag with the size on it
4.0,Great quality.  Sturdy and can be worn daily.
4.0,"The dress is really cute.  The color is as shown; however, it's a little shorter than expected. Overall, I love the dress."
4.0,These pants were perfect for my event.  They were a little long but expected that I am only 5'2
4.0,My grandson want this hoodie so bad so I got it for him.  Before I bought it  I read that it runs small...It does...the size larger was perfect.  One happy little boy.  Thank You Amazon.
4.0,had to go back to the original band. this one kept coming undone and dropped my watch several times
4.0,Bought this for the Halloween clueless look! It was really cute but it’s not an actual corduroy pattern. The pattern is printed on the fabric which I was highly disappointed with but I made it work it was still super cute and it fit perfectly.
4.0,"Definitely runs small and on top of that is very skimpy. I would never wear it out in public, but despite my concerns about the size my boyfriend Loooooved it. Great for showing off your assets even with minimal bending, but, again not something for your office halloween party.<br /><br />Real talk its pretty cheap material, but at less than $30 it's a great purchase for some fun."
4.0,Very cute on!  I should have read more carefully; it’s made of synthetic fabric not cotton but no one can tell unless they touch it.
4.0,The mask is as described just a costume mask (not specific to Green Lantern).  The ring is pretty cool.  It comes with a removable soft plastic insert to fit little fingers as well as larger ones.  The projected image is sharp though not that bright unless you are in a dark room.  For less than $10 delivered this was a nice addition to the Green Lantern costume we bought for our son.
4.0,Very cute band and worth it for the price paid
4.0,"It is very beautiful and looks quite expensive.  The clasp is a little hard to open, so four stars for that."
4.0,Gave to my cousin she love it
4.0,"I really like these face masks, but the printed ones are made from a way thinner material, are more lightweight, and are a tad smaller than the solid ones. I’ve been mainly wearing the printed ones because they fit me a little bit better and they make my face sweat less than the thicker ones for wearing them for an extended period of time, as I have to do at work. They are quite comfortable, though!<br /><br />There is no nose bridge built into these masks, so the fabric kind of gapes a little bit, but that hasn’t been a huge issue for me. I wear glasses 24/7, and they don’t fog my glasses up any more than a regular disposable face mask would.<br /><br />The elastic ear straps are a little bit thin, and I haven’t had my masks long enough to where I would need to wash them yet, but I would recommend washing them in a lingerie bag to protect those flimsy ear straps, if you want to wash them in the washing machine.<br /><br />I do wish that there was an option to order either all solid or all printed masks! I really like the make and fit of the printed ones so much better, and I really wish there was a way to order a solid colored mask in the same thin material that the printed masks are made from.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these masks! But just know that they are not all going to be exactly the same!"
4.0,nice bracelet.
4.0,"The ring is styled similarly to the Were Wolf pendant.  Great face, beautiful details!  I am not sure what makes this a Were Wolf, as opposed to just a wolf...  The ring fits a bit loose because of the way the head is cast, so you might be able to order a size smaller than usual.  On mine there were sharp edges inside the casting, which do not touch the finger and were easily dulled with a file.  This is a large and heavy ring--for me, not uncomfortably so--and probably more suited to guys' wearing."
4.0,I love these these are amazing much more true to size compared to original chucks so order  a half size smaller or usual size I have been using these as a skate shoe and they are great the insole is so good for dropping down stair sets and the reinforced canvas holds up way better than the normal chucks they are amazing give them a try! Also my only complaint is that the spare white shoe lace had a little tair when I opened the box and the box was beet up but on the inside the shoes were perfect
4.0,The zipper broke pretty quick but it was an easy fix..<br /><br />So great costume
4.0,Really great for the price.  Comfortable and light to wear all day.
4.0,Love the blue color. It was a little tight for an XL. I did get this with a discount which i am happy about. Maybe once i lose some pounds it will be more flattering
4.0,Shorts are a great fit and shipping was quick.
4.0,Color was a little off from the picture but still super cute!
4.0,"A great fit and the kind of cheaperish material I expected, but it's a little see through! I feel like you wouldn't have this problem with a darker color and with some nude bottoms I'm not worried. Overall very good for what you pay!"
4.0,"These shoes are very narrow...so they are great if your kid has small narrow feet. My boys feet are wide, so we had to return them. But they are super cute in general!"
4.0,Haven't had a chance to wear it yet but will with leggings for winter and flats for summer.
4.0,Cute on but don't think provides enough support around bust to swim in. Needs clasps to fit well around the girls. Love how it disguised the gut. Would be okay if I didn't actually want to swim.  This has to go back. So cute but I'm scared the top will float up and the girls will be hanging down.  Horrible view or exposure for those swimming under the water.
4.0,"Liked the colors, but they are smaller then my glasses. Oh well."
4.0,"Love the lift of this bra. Good support. Although, I was expecting a little more padding."
4.0,Christmas gift for my daughter! She loves the look of the watch
4.0,It could be darker.
4.0,"When the original order was sent incomplete, CloudStyle immediately sent a replacement so that I had the outfit in time to wear for the special occassion that I had bought it for. Excellent customer service I had not expected. The jacket looks  expensive. Buyers should be aware that the jacket fits a US mens size 42- 44, but the pants are huge with a super plus-sized waste and length. Most men would probably have to have them altered."
4.0,Just  what I need  for my  projects !
4.0,"Only reason I give 4 stars is because the material was thin and cheap feeling for $30. But overall extremely cute and got lots of compliments! Fit as expected, maybe a wee bit on the larger side. I have a little room but not enough to feel swallowed. Very cute and worth it!"
4.0,I think some one already mentioned it but the neon green is more like a neon yellow. Ordered 4 and all the same color at least Al though one arrived dirty.
4.0,the clasp is hard for me to operate so added another extension so i can slip it over my head.  very pretty and really my only complaint is you can't remove the cat from this chain to put it on a longer chain.  have had lots of compliments on how sparkly the chain is.
4.0,They are ok to cover my feet at a hotel.
4.0,"Description says "" 8g 7/16 Captive Bead Rings"", so I thought I was getting 2 not 1! So I had to order another one, not a big deal, just disappointing."
4.0,they shine like crystals in chandelier and a bit heavy.Head is lighter to hanging.
4.0,i really liked them
4.0,"Fits great, easy to wear, but already stretching out a little bit."
4.0,"I bought this hat for several of us in our family to wear as desired but the boys decided it looked more like a girl's cowboy hat so now it will be just for my daughter and I.  The hat is a standard medium and fits both of us just fine.  It looks really attractive but when it arrived, it came a little bit misshapened on the crown.  I've tried to push it back into shape but it's still a little bit bent in still.  The box it arrived in was large enough and the hat was packed in a plastic bag and the box didn't look damaged so I think it was that way before it was sent to us.  This is the only reason this isn't a five star review."
4.0,"This dress is as depicted. Rich colors and fits well. I ordered my usual size, Large.  It is a fairly dense and stretchy fabric. I ordered the floral print."
4.0,"I just love them, they will look good at our wedding"
4.0,Very nice dress...but cheap material
4.0,I love the dress it's very cute and has that old time retro feel. The fabric is very stretchy.
4.0,Great product! The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because it doesn’t have a good microphone but it will do. The battery life could be a little longer but that doesn’t take much away from the product itself. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone else!
4.0,"Have same dress in black fits perfectly.  Ordered in navy and it was way too small in same size.  Consistency is a bit off. The black is very cute, though it is a short dress, good on me at 5'2&#34; though."
4.0,warm socks
4.0,I like it so much..
4.0,Ordered size my son usually wears but these were to small. Sent back. They are also very thin.
4.0,"Not as easy as a wallet if you need a card from the middle, but it is much smaller and lighter than a wallet."
4.0,Cute apron.  Good quality.
4.0,"Looks pretty and nice , I like that it has a lobster claw clasp"
4.0,I love the company and all the many sunglasses I have owned by then.  My eyes are very photosensitive and almost always wear sunglasses.  Normally I would have given any Revo sunglasses a 5-star rating however these are a tad small on me.  My eyelashes touch the lens.  I will be giving these to my son.
4.0,"really nice material, and very Comfy"
4.0,The sequin didn’t have an under garment to keep it from rubbing my skin. Dress was soooo itchy. I’m glad I returned it. Someone else at the wedding was wearing it
4.0,"Great necklace, I got two, one for me and my mom so we can have matching ones. The chain is long, and breaks easily, mine broke, then shortly after my moms chain broke too, but if you buy another one it works just as well."
4.0,I've had them a while now and like them. I do feel like they are starting to stretch and not fit as snug. For the price I can't really complain.
4.0,"Same in the picture, good 👍"
4.0,Stones were much smaller than anticipated but still lovely. Fits great and doesn't irritate the inside of my nose. Very comfortable and easy to put in. Definitely recommend.
4.0,Made all the difference with the dress I wore it with.  Great!
4.0,No design on the back side . just a square holding on to the detachable wings.
4.0,Fits well - I need the wide width.  My biggest complaint is that only a few colors are available in 11.5 EE.
4.0,Shopped quick<br />Cute
4.0,I love the purse but when i got it it didnt come with the strap but other then that its a real nice purse im only giving a 4 star because i did not get my srrap
4.0,"Much smaller than the size chart indicated. Seller was great and issued refund for an exchange on a different size, however, correct size was not available."
4.0,Delicate.  Pretty color. Well made!!  Really like.
4.0,"No idea how well they will last, but at first wearing they seem pretty good."
4.0,"Can't answer ""sheerness"", sorry. Pins to lock arms to glasses would often fall out."
4.0,Very cute but they are a gift and I hope they fit the person I am giving them to....Says fits up to an 8-1/2....  We will see.
4.0,I bought this on lightening deal on amazon almost 50% off. So for that price I think it's a good buy. I loved the case in which it came. The coolers are very light and fits well. I got mirror blue color and they look good for photographs :) don't know if it's comfortable for long hours..
4.0,Very pretty and easy to put in. The only thing that knocks a star off it after only a few weeks of wear one of the opals fell out.
4.0,Much bigger than I anticipated but still very pretty. Used as x-mas present for my son's girlfriend.
4.0,"I like it... I thought because the reviews were very high this watch would be very cool. Although it is cool, there is nothing really super special about it. It is really small- at first I thought I got the women's version. It tells the time which is the most important thing. One thing is the light button. This button is kinda hard to press and when you do press it, the light only goes on for as long as you press the button- which is a pain if you want the light on for more than a few seconds. Some of my friends have had this watch before and though I have not experienced myself, I have seen the band for the watch break- so you should be aware of that. Otherwise, for the price this is a very good watch. I get comments on it for being ""retro"" or ""old"". And interesting fact, terrorists commonly use this to detonate bombs..."
4.0,comfortable; not too long which is great because I am short; fit was perfect
4.0,"Used this as a gift bag for a girlfriends Christmas present. She is obsessed with cacti and thought the bag was really adorable. The one thing I disliked, which is why it is only getting 4 stars, is that it is really narrow in width so it was a struggle to get her present to full fit inside the bag. However she is more than satisfied with it."
4.0,Love this dress. Fits great except shoulder straps keep falling off shoulders. Seems the straps maybe set too far out? Still trying to figure out how to prevent the straps from falling down constantly. Went so me from wearing this great dress though!
4.0,"This looks fine; it just comes in a plastic bag so if you want to gift it...well, got any jewelry boxes lying around?"
4.0,I love this purse! Its a little narrow and thin so difficult to get my nice MK wallet in there but I make it work.
4.0,"I love the top, I ordered 2 sizes up due to the comments so I'll be returning and ordering another size up. Hope it fits as I do love it!"
4.0,"Doesn't go all the way up my husband's calls, however it is a nice set of socks for every day wear. The beanie was a welcome bonus for my husband with the cold weather we have experienced. Quality socks, just not stretchy enough for him to use for work."
4.0,These are the best socks I have found yet. I wish the fronts and sides rode down to be complete no shows while still retaining the tabbed back. They are a tad thicker than most athletic socks but I do not mind it. Great everyday socks as long as you are ok with them not being completely no show and being a tad thick.
4.0,Ok but not 100 percent good!
4.0,"This is a pretty nice set, and price pretty decently. The item came as described and fits well. I love the bracelet design with the horizontal cross. I almost wish the necklace was like that as well, but still is stylish and represents our faith well.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to receive this product at a slight discount in exchange for my honest review. I do try out each product and provide as much info as I often rely on reviews prior to purchasing any products. I truly hope this helps."
4.0,"I like the Yurman-esque feel to this bracelet and, because of that, I think I was expecting something a bit more weighty. This is not quite delicate but it’d take another 20 grams or so to call it weighty. Regardless, it’s quite pretty and lends itself well to stacking, which Yurman bracelets like this typically do not. It’s also nice with a watch, so it’s fairly versatile. Because it’s a cuff, it’s reasonably adjustable but it’s still not a large cuff so, if you have larger wrists, that might be something to take into consideration. It comes packaged quite lovely so it’s easy to pass it on as a gift!"
4.0,"I absolutely adore this shirt. It is rather big though. Washing it helps shrink it only a tad. But when you tie it, it helps it fit to your body better. Still wish it fit a little smaller, but it is a great shirt, regardless."
4.0,I wish that these shoes gave more support to the middle of the foot but overall a good shoe
4.0,I was unsure if i should get a size up but tirns out it fot perfecly in size 10 and looks amazing on.
4.0,"I'm not a huge fan of plastic glasses since they make my face greasy.  When I started wearing these sunglasses, it was like night and day"
4.0,"I wear a small,bought it in a large,perfect."
4.0,"Heavy cloth, good quality but the sewing can be better; came undone beneath the crotch within a month.<br />Overall, a nice buy"
4.0,"I'm 6'-3"" and 225 lbs and the XL fits well. Pants are long enough and the top fits well. The fabric quality is good and they are very comfortable."
4.0,"The design is great. fits good, like the material.  Would recommend AS IT IS A VALUE FOR THE BUCK."
4.0,I didn't give 5 because the top runs a lil bit small but apart from that I'm not disappointed one bit.. highly recommended
4.0,It is a little more drapy that the picture and it is a little smaller than I thought through the chest but it will do and a great price
4.0,"This is a great fall dress. The material is on the thicker and heavier side, which also gives it a tiny bit of structure. I am 5'7 and a 34C and the seam of the waistline hit me perfectly for that slimming, flared fit. It definitely looks ultra plain and needs a belt or a scarf tied around the waist to really give it some definition and further disguise any problem areas. Pairs well with leggings and boots. Since it's knit, the fabric is on the less comfortable side, but nothing unexpected."
4.0,The color is a grey camo which I think is really nice looking. I can pair these with a nice shirt or sweatshirt.<br />I love the feeling of these Avgo high waist yoga pants. They have a soft and fabric that doesn’t itch or ride up during the day. I usually wear a size 12 Jean and I bought an XL and they are perfect. They have large packets on both sides that can fit my IPhone 11max. It fits really nice around my tummy. I’ve noticed I do have to pull them up a couple times durning the day but not a lot.
4.0,Love the watch I have received a lot of compliments. I needed to remove 2 links but I have a small wrist so that was expected.
4.0,"Great not having a tight waistline to worry about.  Will probably figure out a slip to wear underneath as the white fabric is heavier than the soft black, but shows through a little."
4.0,"I ordered these Colosseum men’s fleece Juniper for our son, and he says that the black color, the design and the styling of the encased elastic leg openings, the side pockets, and the elastic waistband with drawcords.<br />He likes that these sweatpants fit him pretty well, and comfortable to wear, and put on and take off as needed. He says that he likes these fleece’s texture stretchy, soft and smooth and easy and gentle on my skin. Our son says he does like that these sweatpants appear to be made with good quality materials with 100% polyester and they seem  to be good quality materials, and they seem to be durable and he says he does like that they fit him snuggly, and they appear to be good value for money; considering the quality, and the price point. I would recommend them."
4.0,"This is a coin purse. The questions about shoes are not relevant. I is, however, a darling silicone jelly coin purse."
4.0,"Soft shirt, good quality"
4.0,"Great fit.  I get a lot of complements on it.  It's a shinier finish which gives it a dressier look.  The stitching is not fantastic, but for the price, I'm sold."
4.0,Good shoe does need tone broke in sized small
4.0,cute costume jewelery
4.0,See the title … great material.
4.0,"Not sure what is ""retro"" about an elastic belt, but these are exactly as described and will serve the purpose of shortening the look of too long tunics previously purchased.  The belts are decorative and not designed or substantial enough to hold up loose pants."
4.0,"Pretty color, good fit, and arrived on time.  Cotton is deliciously soft but unforgiving so if you prefer wearing tank tops or undergarments with patterns under your shirts....you're out of luck with this item.  I wear it with leggings..very flattering on my curves and plus size body.  Would recommend ordering up a size if you don't like shirts that hug your curves...as mentioned above...cotton clings and shows what's underneath. Arms and chest area are fitted with a fun flair from the waist down."
4.0,"After installing the band, I immediately found that it was slightly difficult to get on due to the band being quite stiff. I've gotten used to it now but just thought I'd throw that out there. The installation of the band was quite easy, though."
4.0,My wife loved it. Good quality fabric.
4.0,It’s super cute and comfy but the zipper is very cheap and gets jammed super easily plus after one day of wearing it I noticed a few strings falling out in the sleeve area. Also the hood is HUGE and a weird shape but if you can get past that it’s a really cute sweater! It’s quite baggy so if you don’t like that kind of style it might not be for you.
4.0,This set was great. These are pretty good quality for the price and given the chance I would buy again. The only issue I had was that one pair came with the wrong size o rings. Not a big deal because it comes with tapers and tunnels. I love this set. C:
4.0,The material is soft and comfy
4.0,"very comfortable and great for me as I have rather slender wrists and hands, they don't interfere with getting into my pocket.  very soft even tho they are not 100% natural fibers as some of the product info indicates.  It would be nice if the wrist was slightly longer."
4.0,"These have a firm fit, due to a high lycra content.  They are just a little on the shiny side (not real bad).  I have done a lot of housework in them, and they have not snagged or pilled.  They are comfortable, with a wide waist/hip band.  Length is about what is shown on the model.  Price is great for what you're getting."
4.0,A little big in the cup but quickly became my daily wear. Wish there was another color other than white. They are comfy though
4.0,"The jeans are absolutely beautiful, but the zipper always comes undone. At work I can hide it with my apron, but if I want to wear a normal shirt, I am always self-concious"
4.0,"Sized a bit on the small size with respect to waist.  ;-)  Other than that, these are very cool looking shorts - and great shorts for the price. Material is light and thin (don't expect thick heavy cargo shorts), but they are comfortable."
4.0,I liked this hat but i would ordered a smaller size
4.0,It was a little hard when it arrived but it has soften up since and goes really well with my galaxy s2 rose gold. I love the brown color too.
4.0,Works<br />But not strong
4.0,"I love the color. and it's a cute sweater, but it's a teeny bit small. I end up pulling the sleeves up to make it a 3/4 sleeve cardigan"
4.0,"Love it. Warmer than I expected and very cute. I love the zipper feature,"
4.0,"Very nice, sleek and dainty.  Like it very much!"
4.0,Nice dress for during the day. The material isn't very see through. It is very flowy
4.0,"The mask doesn't look great, and I'll have to make a few adjustments to wear it as a decent cosplay. It was a bit tight in some places, and it doesn't stretch much, but it was great for the money."
4.0,They do fit over my glasses but not as well as I would like. The polarization is awesome. They are not as dark as my last pair but I am getting used to it. Overall great buy.
4.0,Just what I need. I needed a replacement for a 5 window Vinyl insert and now I have one extra also.
4.0,I like these because they do not slide down my foot when walking. That is the reason I bought them. I'm glad I didn't buy them for the support. It offers all the support a cotton ball can. They are very comfy.
4.0,Love these pants and how they fit but a word of caution....the washing instructions say to hand wash then lay flat to dry. Not a problem if you are home but bought these for trip to Europe.
4.0,Very cute! lasted three costume events including Disneyland. Mask was too small around my son’s head (he’s 5) so had to purchase a separate one.
4.0,Looks same as in photo. Slightly small for an XL.
4.0,This is really nice for the beach. The material is way thinner than it looks in the picture. It's completely see through.
4.0,"wife: cute, but it looks better in the pictures. They seem a little bigger in the pictures too. Also disappointed that the backing are just plastic.<br /><br />Good thing about it is I've been wearing them all day and so far not ear irritation or anything. For someone with sensitive ears, that's a plus!"
4.0,"The quality is somewhat great, however one of them ripped alrewady after two days as I was trying to take it off."
4.0,These are nice shoes but they are very expensive in my opinion. I bought them for my husband because he runs his shoes over side ways and I was hoping that these wouldn't do that but they do so I was disappointed with them especially since cheaper shoes hold up just as well.
4.0,I love the color! The material washed well. But it it does run a bit small so do not expect to layer this sweatshirt.
4.0,Goggles work well except they keep coming apart on the sides (silver pair). They fell off this week as my son was swimming in a meet. Otherwise good purchase.
4.0,"We love these pants, although I feel the sizing description is off just a bit. Ordered a medium for my 5’6, 120lb athletically built daughter. Expecting them to be baggy, but they’re HUGE. She has to roll the waist. The baggy/relaxed fit remind me more of a men’s warm up pant. I’m 5’7 and 130lbs and they’re a bit big/loose on me as well. We kept them though, she loves slipping them on between races at meets - they’re big so easy to toss on if she’s still damp from the pool. Just won’t be wearing them out and about due to the size."
4.0,"I had purchased this ensemble as a gift for my daughter. She loves this outfit. Good materials & seems to be made well.  However, the skirt was little large on her. I was able to alter the bottom to get it to fit better. The price on this was a little expensive, but I couldn't find it cheaper elsewhere. She is happy with it and it can be passed onto little sister when she grows out of it."
4.0,"I wear this every day, and what irks me is how quickly the brass metal plating wore off all over it too quickly and the 'plastic'/rubber rope it hangs from broke quickly also. Despite this, it is a great product."
4.0,cute but you need take otherwise your boobs are out
4.0,"Got this cute outfit in S/M , I got it for when I do yoga at home. The bottoms were smaller then I expected but I guess it is considered a bathing suit and personally I don’t mind it how tight and revealing it is. The top also doesn’t provide a whole lot of support for me, I am cup size C 36.i don’t blame the two piece I probably should of orders a larger size because the clothes let alone are beautiful!  I like this set a lot for lounging around the house and maybe as a bikini cover up"
4.0,"Purchased for my sister in the hospital for a long stay. Always felt cold but couldn't wear any wool near her skin. She loves the wrap, soft and warm as we hoped. The ability to tuck it keeps it around her shoulders without having to put arms into sleeves. Bought red first and she loved the color, so cheerful. Then sent her the black to wear later. Excellent for the price and fit her needs so well."
4.0,"I'm very tall and very skinny, so I have some experience with custom-made clothing.  Other custom clothing sites keep a record of all the measurements for every order you've made, and you can use any of those as a starting point for a new order.<br /><br />Here, it's not obvious what ""my size"" means.  I did the picture thing and ordered a shirt, and the fit was not bad but not great.  Amazon gave me a chance to ""fine-tune"" the fit for free.  I took advantage, and the result was a very good fit.  Some of the tweaks, like sleeve length, were in inches; others, like the sleeve diameter, were in ""sizes"", so I had to do a lot of guessing, but again, the results were decent.<br /><br />So I ordered three more shirts assuming they would have the corrected measurements, but evidently ""my size"" is still the original size and not the corrected one, because all three shirts had the original (wrong) fit.  I guess I need to remember the tweaks I made and make them on each new order, but how was I supposed to know that?  Or maybe I was supposed to confirm the new fit choices somehow?  Impossible to tell, and if there are Amazon support people who understand ""Made For You Custom"", I have been unable to find them.<br /><br />A little work on the web site could save Amazon a lot of returned merchandise."
4.0,"I used this for a starbucks halloween costume, came on time and fit well. But the zipper would sometimes get stuck."
4.0,Overall material is nice. The fit is not made for people with big chest or chubby arms. I would have kept it if the print was exactly as the picture. I loved the bright white and space between the Flowers with the pop of blue. This was not what I ordered.
4.0,"Nice sleek fit and lots of options. Where with a jacket, a full-length tool skirt for drama, wear it alone if your body type is right without the bubbles and bulges. There is a zipper down the back which is easy to get to. However, if you have to relieve yourself you will have to pull down the top half of the garment to use the facilities."
4.0,Cute tank top
4.0,"I love outfit, it's really cute.<br />Fits fine, quality ok.<br />The only problem was missing the tie"
4.0,"I really love these leggings...they had a very bad odor to them, but after I washed (before wearing), these are now my favorite.  They fit very nicely."
4.0,"Had a tiny brown stain on it but I needed to wear it for an event that night so I ignored it, overall it was very pretty"
4.0,"Very pretty, my wife loves it! I would've given 5 starts but there are a couple of spots where I thought the craftsmanship could've been better but the spots are relatively hidden. A good deal for under $30."
4.0,Difficult to attach but otherwise nice
4.0,My daughter bought this for my mom. So far it's holding up great. I would recommend this item
4.0,"It was a gift for my wife, she loved it."
4.0,The metal end pulls hair sometimes if we put the watch hand up to a ponytail or while brushing hair which is annoying while wearing it daily
4.0,Not same pink as pictured
4.0,The bunny hat is good but the tubes that are making the ears move keep breaking.
4.0,"I give this product a 4 because the sizing is so off. I read several other reviews that said the same thing, and even though I went up in size it was still pretty small. The product also came with a small fabric defect but I wouldn't have minded because it was so cute. I ended up having to return them because they were just way to small so I will reorder sizing up. Overall the quality seemed very well and again the design is adorable but it just runs way to small."
4.0,"Price is right, could last longer!"
4.0,"Daughter is sensitive to materials - this one was okay for her. She was thrilled with the pattern. Well made, colors hold up."
4.0,"These are very comfortable, not quite as supportive as I had hoped they would be. I have a top that I love to wear that is cut lower in the back, and all my other bras showed when I wore it. I doubled up with 2 of these bras and was able to wear it with nothing showing."
4.0,good for the money. I want more people to show the inside.
4.0,Wish there were two tone to mix it up
4.0,"I bought this product in large. I go through tank tops really quickly and I wanted something cheap that would also last a bit. I think this product will fit the bill, although as others have said the straps are a little flimsy, I think the will give out rather quickly. The fit is just as I expected it is nice and long, so wonderful for layering. I feel like I could have gotten a size smaller but usually get one size up in my tops and undershirts because that is the fit I like."
4.0,"It perfectly matches the embroidery on some shoes I bought and the shades of eyeshadow and lipstick I have. It's not the most flattering because it's much bigger than I expected, but it layers well and feels comfortable.<br />*Update* It doesn't do well if laundered carelessly; I wash everything together, I don't separate by voloir and type because I don't use bleach and I always use hot water and nontoxic type soap. Also, I live somewhere that I can't air dry things, do everything goes into dryers. The tunic became ugly pretty quickly."
4.0,"Love these shoes.  Get worn out quickly, but they fit perfectly and are still cute"
4.0,Nice size and doesn't get in the way...however I wish it was more flexible.
4.0,"I bought this recently at Costco for a couple of dollars less than here but this is still a good price.<br />The feature I really like is that it has two slots  above the brim to slide your sunglasses' arms into so<br />when you wear them on top of your head, they won't fall.  It's an attractive hat, the brim is medium size<br />so looks good on most people, and it's adjustable so you pull a drawstring inside to fit your head."
4.0,I love the lace it’s very pretty it’s great quality as well.  The layer under it is a bit see through but workable.  The front is very short on a tall person I need white shorts under it.  I’m 5’9 I’m satisfied with the price and quality I received.
4.0,Im a 32 waste 180. They fit a little small in the pouch for my better than average lenth and thick package. Id call them good.
4.0,Nicely made in comfortable material.
4.0,This dress was perfect for my Glinda the Good Witch Halloween costume! The shape is beautiful and the size worked well for me. It’s very sheer on top so I wore a tan cami under the dress and pushed the straps under the puffy sleeves. I ended up LOVING how this all came together!
4.0,a bit smaller then i would have liked but still cute
4.0,"The earrings are sort of bendy - they don't clasp in or anything, you have to bend it and then bend it back so that it closes.  I've been wearing one as a cartilage earring for about a week and it's been great so far! It's small enough and hasn't fallen out!"
4.0,"I like the bracelets quite a bit, they seem like they are pretty good quality. I haven't had any problems with them."
4.0,I bought these as they were supposed to be compression tanks there is about half the compression I was hoping for and I bought a  size smaller than normal.  otherwise quality is what I expected
4.0,It fits great and I’m 5’3’
4.0,"This is a nice product but I wanted RED leather, this item is Burgundy ."
4.0,Working under a led grow light. It's awesome. Can see alot better and protects my eyes.
4.0,It meets the criteria for what it was suppose to
4.0,"It shipped faster than expected, which was great, I wore a black camisole under it. The only thing is that the fabic is cheap and after two HAND washes the areas around the perforated scallops are beginning to unravel. But other than that, this is beautiful and different and I get a lot of compliments on it!"
4.0,"NICE FIT,LIGHT WEIGHT AND EASY ON AND OFF..THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS NO FLAP FOR MEN.."
4.0,For the two days I had them they were pretty decent around the house cheap flip flops. I didn't expect much.<br />They didn't fall apart after two days. My dog ate them. She's the one that said leave a four star because they just didn't taste as good as the dozens of other sandals she's eaten.<br />Good value. Fits as expected. Would buy again if my dog is hungry.
4.0,Its not bad for the price
4.0,Dress is beautiful but too big😒
4.0,"5'6&#34; 170 34E bottom fit perfectly top not so much. I'm short waisted so jumpsuits & rompers tend to make me look squat. The cut out solved that problem, BUT I will have to get I altered to fit properly. If you have back fat without your bra this is NOT for you! I also thought material would have been a little lighter, truly a polyester garment. I'll still stunt on em in this!"
4.0,"It's beautiful. It's small, but i sized up a couple of sized to make it work. I'm docking a star because the bottom button fell apart before I even tried it on. I'm replacing it with a clip."
4.0,I ordered these earlier but from a different seller so I knew that these had to be a size larger than what you would usually wear.This one arrived on time and my niece loves it. All LEDs work
4.0,"If you want a large you should get a xx-large, I got a larger and it was way too small and felt more like a medium."
4.0,Loose around top back of dress.
4.0,Would be 5 stars but band is tight. It's made for skinny wrists
4.0,"I love this outfit.....the only issue was the material is extremely stretchy so you may want to order a size down to get the fit that u want, I had to pull the pants up slightly higher over my waist than I wanted and the sleeves were a little big but I made it work for that night......besides that, great outfit and I would definitely buy it again."
4.0,Very cute and comfortable pjs. The material doesn’t really feel like cotton but that’s what the label says.
4.0,You what you paid but it does the job. Chicago Winter whether wise.
4.0,"Fits slightly smaller than expected. Otherwise, good quality!"
4.0,"I purchased as a Christmas gift for my mother. The original bracelet that I received had a loose clasp, which caused the bracelet to fall off.  It also had missing diamonds. While it was a very good looking bracelet I was unhappy with the quality. Because of my disappointment with the product I contacted the seller, one of the best customer experiences that I have received. They volunteered to replace the bracelet at no charge to me. Thankfully the replacement bracelet was even more beautiful, shined more, full of diamonds, and a tight clasp. I am very happy with the product and the service. I gave five stars, simply because the initial product was flawed."
4.0,"Pretty, but a little smaller than expected.  Still works though!"
4.0,"I was very excited whe I paid for it, until I find out the inside edges are kinda sharp and almost slit my upper lip. plus it's a little too heavy to be hanged on my ears."
4.0,Its great it has alot of pockets  only thing is the strap is not super sturdy all in all good bag
4.0,"Gotta say, I'm always leery ordering clothing items like this. This pleasently surprised me. I ordered the mustard color and it is just that- dark mustard with a floral pattern of whites, pinks & greens. The fabric is very thin and came very wrinkled, but I bought it specifically for a beach vacation so no worries going a tad skimpy and wrinkles can be removed. For reference I'm typically a size 14 in pants, 32 in denim and I carry my weight in my tummy/pooch. I ordered the XXL (I always order a couple sizes up on quick fashion from the Pac Rim) and the fit is perfect, just fitted enough in the waist without any dreaded bulging/muffin top. I'm 5'10 and the length is at or maybe a touch above my ankle. The buttons do not go all the way down the front of the skirt, they stop well above my knee creating a substantial slit, but again, beach- not work. I'd be shocked if this lasted more than a year, but all things considered I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,"My daughter always has a problem ordering dresses online, but we took a chance.  The dress is good.  A little tight in the chest area.  Color was perfect."
4.0,Fabric is a bit thinner than I expected. Dress otherwise looks feels and fits great. Just wish it had pockets.
4.0,It's a nice bracelet. Above and beyond what I exepected. It's a very nice braclet. Just the back is a little flimsy.
4.0,Good leg warmers at a reasonable price.
4.0,"Has games, an alarm clock and can take photos and video. It is touchscreen, other than that it has one button to control everything. Unable to control (video) playback volume 😞 ☹. Do not recall if alarm has ability to snooze and if the volume of the alert is adjustable. There are definitely different alert types. Wrist band is silicon and unfortunately my daughter (as of late) seems to have a bad skin reaction to all silicon type watch bands."
4.0,Nice sweatshirt. It does hit the waistline. I didn't realize it was more on the cropped side. Glad I ordered a size up or else I would not like the sweatshirt. I ordered a large and usually wear a medium.
4.0,Great quality! Soft as well!
4.0,"Nice dress & true to size but it was too short for me & I'm 5'10&#34;. So if your a tall girl, beware."
4.0,"Really stylish and cheap, but there is a bad glare on really sunny days"
4.0,"I bought this shirt in blue and I have to say it is quite striking and beautiful to look at. Definitely an attention-getter, and it's also very comfortable as well. The only objection I have is that I ordered it &#34;L&#34; and it seems a little closer to &#34;XL&#34; in size; not too large exactly, but slightly baggy. On the other hand I haven't washed it yet, so it may very well shrink a little, in which case I'll up the rating to five stars."
4.0,"Nice pendant, perfect size and weight. The cotton rope necklace is kind of funky and the clasp doesn't work well. Would have been better with a nicer ball chain, which is what I added."
4.0,"It's made of the kind of material you'd find on a $5 hoodie: paper thin, and doesn't stretch much. But it really displays my level 20 Otaku status, so who cares."
4.0,La tela de la capucha no es tan linda. Pero por ese precio esta bien
4.0,"This is our second year buying this dinosaur costume. My ten year old son wore the brown one in 2019,  and we loved it, so we bought the orange one for Halloween in 2020. The costume is easy to use, stays inflated quite well if you're careful about the sleeves and the pants cuffs, where the air escapes if you don't watch the elastic.<br /><br />The adult size will fit most kids as well, it's very adaptable. The motor seems great, it certainky worked well for us. We used it for about an hour at a time. The gloves and the shoe covers are easiky lost by a kid, you may want to add a snap or two, even some careful stitching, to keep the gloves and shoe covers with the costume.<br /><br />But even without the gloves and shoecovers, this costume makes a huge impression and gets a lot of attention. We loved it!"
4.0,I wish this clip was more flexible. It is very pretty but uncomfortable when sitting in a chair when used to clip the back of a sweater.
4.0,Traditional leather cleaner and preservative. Worked fine on the leather covering and bellows of the camera I was restoring.
4.0,Runs larger than other miraclesuit tops by over a size
4.0,"Love the dress . I’m 5”1 and my weight is 104 the length is perfect for me. Love the dress but the only thing which I like less is the top front of the dress, it was not fit as I was expecting. Love the color, material and design ."
4.0,"This skirt is perfect for a night out, sexy without being too much. I'm 5'11 with a 29 inch waist. I got a large, and it fit fine. Does tend to gape at the front. When I ordered I read other reviews and they mentioned a smell, it did have a smell, but after hanging a few days it was fine. Overall-satisfied, perfect for the price! Would def order again!"
4.0,This necklace is beautiful.  It has a lovely shine and is a good weight.  It is sturdy and still flexible.  The reason for only fours stars - the necklace doesn't always stay flat and the clasp is a bit hard to open.  I've been wearing this necklace just about every day for a month.  I may have to adjust it to lay flat once or twice during the day.  The clasp is becoming easier to use.  This necklace looks like it costs more.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  The seller was excellent.  Received the necklace exactly when expected and in perfect condition.  Would recommend this product.
4.0,Tiny steps with this one. But the fabric is fairly soft and you don't have to wear anything underneath. It's thick enough.
4.0,"Cute, and nice"
4.0,The design is adorable! The shirt fits much shorter and tighter than I’d like though. I have other shirts that are this style and they are all roomier.
4.0,these bags are great for keeping things organized;<br />i would recommend.<br />I've purchased several.
4.0,"I just completed a two week vacation.  I used the socks and was generally pleased and will use them again for my next vacation.  These socks are a &#34;one size fits all&#34; type.  They would fit perfectly if you wore a size 7.  I wear a size 11 and not only did the heel not fit correctly, but the top of the socks dug into my leg and left a mark while I was wearing them.  I wish that they came in a larger size.  However, the cost of the socks was inexpensive and I did not have to deal with stinky socks smelling up my suitcase.  The problems I had were minor and I can certainly tolerate them again.  I am writing this in the hopes that the manufacturer will get a clue and make more than one size. They had a silky feeling and were comfortable except for the top that was tight."
4.0,"First and most important: You have to buy the blouse based on the size given in the PRODUCT DESCRIPTION. I bought the 5XL that says it has 47,2 inches of bust. I'm 44,5 and it was a little tight; besides that it was perfect. The sleeve was a little long. It is made of a great material, it's really cute."
4.0,"I was looking for a camo neck tie. This one I think is the best of the options out there. Just wish the material was a little softer, as it would be easier to tie."
4.0,"These are the best fitting compression socks I've found. And the price is so great! They stretch well, last through travel and work days, and wash out nicely. I just wish Mojo would make an XXL. Since I have longer and bigger legs, I wouldn't have to keep pulling them up so much and stretching them beyond what I probably should. I can still wear these with capris and people just think I have a tan!"
4.0,"This bralette is comfy. The medium is a smidge large for me (I usually wear a Medium or Large in sports bras or bralettes).<br />Downside: I wash this in a garment bag on cold and hang dry it. However, after the first few washes, I noted a bunch of those tiny, white, elastic strings sticking out on the back of the bralette (the lacy part). I cut them, which has helped. Just keep that in mind though. Might be better to hand wash, if you have the time for that. :)"
4.0,"It was cute and was thicker than I thought it would be. The issue I had was that it was just too big. I’m 5’1” and 120, so I suppose I would need a petite size to fit correctly. I ordered a small and it was just all around too large. I returned it."
4.0,I like that they are good for almost shapewear but I bought for outdoor activities
4.0,"Dress was awesome.  Only issue was the  seams, but besides that  this  dress looked  great"
4.0,Fit well and made well. Prefer prettier prints but can’t find them.
4.0,Purchased for my daughter. She loves it. Washes pretty well but it did tend to ball up and snag. I used a new razor to remove the balled up areas. Looks as good as new.
4.0,"Ordered black and red from this seller and an olive from another seller, only difference is the price. 5'5 160lbs ordered medium and both olive and red fit great. The black however are a bit snug. Love these pants and the material however they do shrink in the dryer length wise."
4.0,A bit too big for me or I should have got a smaller size
4.0,"Very pretty, only thing is that the gems starred falling off a few hours after wearing. It is a big size.. not for kids. If you want to get this for a child, simply add a safety pin or stich it."
4.0,"Great for the price. I just got them, so I can't speak to their longevity, but their very good for driving, and their not ugly either."
4.0,"I ordered 2 pairs of these sunglasses and love them!  The first pair I ordered the green with green shading came as it said it would in a good package.  However, the second pair was delivered to me in an envelope!  As you can imagine, the sunglasses were damaged.  I returned the damage pair and ordered another pair.  The second pair came in a box this time and with a little baggy to carry them in.  I was pleased with the handling of the return and love these sunglasses!!  By the way, I have a really small head and I finally found a pair that are not huge on me!!  However, I do have state the lenses are already scratched, but I won't hold it against them for the price!"
4.0,bought for my son who wears size 13 or 13.5.  They were too snug so seems they may run small (or he just likes them looser?)
4.0,Everything is good about it except one button from top was missing and it was a gift.
4.0,The bathing suit is beautiful; however the fit was off for me. The bottom half fit great but the width on the top straps is really wide and makes the fit awkward.
4.0,"This sleep mask is great for older kids.  I'd hesitate to use it with young kids because it is an elastic around their neck and why take a chance?  My daughter got a glimpse of it on my account and was thrilled.  So much for it being a stocking stuffer!<br /><br />The outside is super soft and snuggly.  The inside, sadly, isnt quite as soft; I wish it were softer.  I'm not sure my daughter is really going to care though.<br /><br />I'd say this is a solid contender for a cute gift."
4.0,"This is a very cute pair of water shoes - comfortable, quick drying, safe, cute and easy to wear. However, it does not provide arch support, so no wearing it for long time periods. Also, the inner lining keeps on slipping out every time it gets out. So I have to straighten it and put it inside every single time I put it on my child. It tells me quality is not sterling. I bought this twice, 2 different sizes as my child grew, but now I don't think I will come back for the next size up."
4.0,This served it purpose very well. Nice smooth leather cord. Put together well. Thanks Very soft too. Hangs well on the neck.
4.0,It didn’t sync to my wii all the time but overall it served its purpose.
4.0,Nice assortment of patterns. High quality construction.  We'll have to see how they stand up to everyday wear and tear.  The true test will be if and when my girlfriend steals a pair from me!
4.0,These are very cute stylish sunglasses. I love the mirrored lenses and they fit perfectly. My only real issues are that they get smudged and it can be noticable and when you are standing in bright sunlight it can be hard to see clearly out of them. But those issues are minor and they don't take away from the overall product.
4.0,"I tend to order things a size larger then I think I wear. I do not like tight fitting clothing. However, this dress runs extremely large I had to return it."
4.0,"I received a discount code for this product to provide a review for amzreviewtrader.  I had been looking for a watch like this for when I worked my shifts as a nurse since working at night, you are not always able to see the clock on the wall.  I love the looks of both of these watches as well as the weight because they do not weigh down my badge anymore than it already was.  I actually plan on giving the second watch to one of my good friends."
4.0,Love these for traveling! Great sizes and material
4.0,"It's a cute shirt, but I do agree with another review that said something about the buttons being not functioning buttons. I gave it 4 stars because of that.  I didn't think much about it when I read the review but I think the shirt would be cuter if you could unbutton some of the buttons so it doesn't lay so weird.  That being said, I'm large chested so maybe it just doesn't lay right on my chest, LOL.  I do like the pattern of the shirt and you can wear it with leggings so that's a plus in my opinion. Overall, cute shirt, and as expected for the price."
4.0,"Super cute jacket, the buttons are a little cheap though. Fit as expected."
4.0,It fits well but the material is a bit rough.
4.0,Love these shoes! Very nice colors & fit perfect. No complaints from my daughter
4.0,I appreciate the flexibility of converting it from a messenger bag to a backpack. Fits casual and dressy style.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish the hardware was matte finish; like brushes nickel. Glossy chrome looks cheap to me.
4.0,"Following the instructions, very easy to connect. There is a little plastic back door that flew off once in my car. Minus one star for whatever that was."
4.0,"Love the color! Will probably order more in other colors, as well.  The fit is very flattering even though the material is relatively thin."
4.0,cute little lights that make nice favors.
4.0,"Like that they are lightweight and clear ,love the style and has  bigger lenses then most readers only complaint is that on one pair the handle fell off , but is a easy fix  with a little glue.so that why 4 star rating  I hope that its doesnt happen again."
4.0,Arrive on time.
4.0,I really enjoy this Keychain Skull but it is quite heavy so I put a hook on my bedroom wall and looks great
4.0,Good quality glove for price. The diameter around my hand is slightly loose due to my very small hands. I will have some darts sewn on the inside part to fit it.
4.0,Nice looking goggles
4.0,"I was afraid that 12-18 months would fit to my 11 month old because of the fabric material. However, even after some washes it fitted him perfectly. Fabric is breathable, and hat fits too! (My son has a big head)"
4.0,"its okay,i think i like it"
4.0,"I love this, it's beautiful, but not very sturdy. I'm glad I can make some simple jewelry repairs, as I've had to fix it twice already now and I've only worn it twice. It looks just like the picture, but keep some jewelry rings on hand just in case. I'm going to have to buy a new lobster claw for it as well, it doesn't close completely anymore."
4.0,Pretty but not quite as good quality as I expected.
4.0,"I am a 38G and the XXL fits me perfectly. One of my boobs is bigger than the other and would prefer a little more support, but that is the nature of this cut of top. If I had gotten the size the size chart told me to get, I would have no support and the top would have been too big.<br /><br />I look forward to buying more of these in different colors."
4.0,The recipient of this blouse said it fit her well and was true to size.
4.0,"I love wearing this! I had lots of compliments for the color and style! However, I'm 5'71/2"" and I had to take it up almost 3"" just so my heels wouldn't step on it. It also wasn't even on the bottom, so that made it worse. Other than that, material and fit was great."
4.0,"I cannot find how to set day of week. Instruction manual does not cover the watch I bought. Very frustrating! Other than not being able to set the day of the week, the watch works well and looks good."
4.0,"Great gloves, enjoy the tight fit which helps w grip and ability to do day to day things that other gloves prohibit. Haven’t had a really cold day to determine true warmth"
4.0,Very cute for Halloween or cosplay. Runs short.
4.0,"I liked the material and idea of this cover-up, but I returned it for a better deal."
4.0,I gave it to my sister as a gift. She loved that it was small yet held the essential oil.
4.0,Products fit well. The child’s dress is just perfect! The adult dress the top part is pretty see through especially if you are size C cup or bigger. Comfy flowy and just what we were looking for to match during our summer/spring adventures together.
4.0,Only reason I didn't give 5 star is because the screw on part isn't very long. A couple turns and they are on or off. Other than that they are super cute.
4.0,Shorts are shorter than appears in pictures and rises up on the edges. But very cute and comfortable.
4.0,I love the look of this brand i only wish it was a bit wider and better materials as it's very light weight feels like it can break easy. The Lenses are very clear to look though since the're polarized. I would buy no doubt. Lenses are not too dark
4.0,"Unfortunately, the zipper broke after opening and closing only a few times.<br />Update: The company replaced it and I have not had any issues with the zipper."
4.0,"this hat is awesome, a little pricey for my taste but definitely worth it for the uniqueness. A few straggally threads here and there but other than that amazing product!"
4.0,"Color is wine, very pretty, with a little satin trim that lines the front and back neckline. I am 5'6"", 150 lbs, and the Medium is snug. It has an odd way of highlighting the lower belly are, so if you don't want to look like you have a larger lower belly, stay away from this gown. I'm okay with it, because I'm sleeping in it, and my husband will like it anyway, LOL. Very comfortable fabric with a little stretch. The hem hits me around the knees."
4.0,When you squeeze the pump that makes the ears go up it loses the air so you will have to wait for it to be filled up again
4.0,Good quality but definitely a European fit. If you’re in doubt make sure to go up a size or 2.
4.0,"It’s definitely a complete wrap skirt and it was smaller than I thought it would be, but it’s so cute as a swim cover up!"
4.0,"Fits well, materials are sturdy, and it looks pretty."
4.0,"Cute, but super thin. Put baby in an all white diaper. You can see the colored patterns through the material"
4.0,"The light brown strap is well made, it will conform to the wrist after a few wearings and like any Wocci strap I bought in the past it stacks up well with more well known and much pricier straps (like from the Austrian outfit that starts with ""H"").<br /><br />What I did not like was the color was more gray-brown, not the more pleasant light reddish/gold brown as shown in the picture.  I still kept it since it went well with my green dialed chronograph and due to the good build quality."
4.0,"My son absolutely loved this hoodie, however, it runs small!  I ordered him a 2x and it was snug around his middle section. I noticed this item was shipped directly from China and not made for a large USA man so take that into consideration when you are ordering this hoodie.  Even the largest size was too tight!!"
4.0,"Relatively pleased with these two cuffs, which arrived promptly and - although  a bit smushed in transmission, it only took a bit of tinkering, adjusting the leather strands and then allowing it to wrap to the shape of my wrist - pretty good quality, considering you do receive two pieces (brown and black) for under ten bucks.<br />I'll be h0nest, I had a really special handmade leather cuff a long while back, and it's silly for me to try to replace it, but these have the familiar safe feel of my &#34;shackle&#34; as i used to call it.<br />4 stars - thank you Besteel - for making mens jewelry, which is inevitably and ineffably more affordable than womans.. yet just as fitting,<br />for the right type of lady."
4.0,"This is a comfy very warm hoodie with front pocket. It's polyester blend fleece lined. The front with embroidery is very well done & professional looking.  Perfect sweatshirt with hood for games at Rose Bowl. It runs small. My boyfriends usually wears between L and XL depending on the way the sweatshirt is made, collar and hood or no hood. The XL was tight on him and bottom seemed to be short. He wasn't happy with it and since there is no XLL he gave it to me to wear. So check size chart and size up"
4.0,Very cute and fits great!<br /><br />CAM
4.0,"This top is comfortable and lightweight. The fit is loose and a bit sloppy. If you don't like that type of fit, I would go down to size. It's very casual, almost see-through, best with jeans, it might be too long for shorts."
4.0,"I really like this earring the ball at the back is hard to screw in if you have nails but not impossible, I wish the post was just slightly longer but overall awesome earring."
4.0,Wife likes it. A little bulky but very warm.
4.0,Looks very nice beautiful gift for anyone
4.0,The skirt was a little shorter than anticipated but I love this dress. Super comfortable and easy to care for.
4.0,Cute dress bought for my daughter as gift. Fits well
4.0,"Not the fabric I expected, but washes nice and warm."
4.0,A little cheap feeling but they’re cute!
4.0,Very helpful on my last trip.
4.0,"Great jacket for mild Seattle weather. I love the rain resistant exterior and soft fleece interior. I only wish the hood was rain resistant, but I like that it is soft and warm- like sweatshirt material."
4.0,"Love this heart shirt!  It does run small, so order a size up!"
4.0,Too small so had to return.
4.0,This is a great tank however I sized up based on other reviews and it is too large I can wear it. Very disappointed. May reorder in the future my normal size.
4.0,"I'm 5'6 and 160 lb and ordered the large/xtra large leggings 2 pack. They fit perfect and are very comfy.  I tried the squat test and the ombre passed, but the black ones did not."
4.0,"These are VERY nice socks!<br />I received them in a size large which is supposed to fit women's sizes 10-12.5. I typically wear a size 9 in women's sneakers and found these to be a little snug. They still fit but I can't imagine a woman with a size 12 foot fitting into these comfortably.<br />Other than that I have no complaints. They are well made with good, durable stitching and very comfy to wear.<br />These will be perfect for the freezing cold winters where I live. Socks are just as important as footwear when it comes to keeping your feet warm. These are thick and cushioned. I can't wait to try them out in a few months!"
4.0,Great product! Very pleased with the quality of these shoes for the price.
4.0,Beautiful sweater and great light weight quality BUT too long on a short girl...I am 5'  at 140 pounds  it was a dress - I got a small too.  If you want it baggy and loose - you will love this.  I just wanted something different.
4.0,They are nice feeling and the hip fits great but they are very short. They ended up hitting like Capri pants
4.0,Estas mascarillas no son gruesas son como las azules de 3 capas...
4.0,"They are what they are... large bright glasses. Bright blue lenses, white, and silver ""+""s. They are either your style, or aren't.<br />Priced right... not expensive designer, don't have to worry TOO much about damaging them, but they aren't built like tanks either.<br />They are very large... but thats what aviators are supposed to be, right?"
4.0,It fits very well. Longer than I thought it would be but it is a good dress overall
4.0,Came exactly as described only downside is the time it takes to ship.
4.0,This is as cute in person as it looks on line.
4.0,"Pro: Good for the price. Love the style.<br />Con: iron needed, neck hole too wide."
4.0,"Tried several sizes and they all turned out to be too large. I was tired of returning and reordering, and I ran out of time (needed it for a pool party) so I gave up. Was a nice bathing suit top, nice quality, looked great, but didn’t fit me. Returns were super easy."
4.0,This is a very good quality skirt. I'm surprised at how heavy the material is. I have to return it because it's too small. I wear a small or extra small in just about everything but I couldn't zip the skirt up.
4.0,It's just the right size for a tragus though I always have a really hard time putting the ball in. I have to get help from a friend to do that but overall it's a good earring.
4.0,Very comfortable and feels great on the feet. The part on the heel is amazing and doesn't burn like some other foot wear.
4.0,Cute and good coverage
4.0,"Loved this,so expensive looking"
4.0,"Hi, I live in Colombia and the watch arrived on time but without the diamond stone in the number 12. I think during the travel it fall down.<br />It was a little bit big but it looks expensive and beautiful!"
4.0,It seems well made and comfortable.  I am starting to use it more and so far happy with it.
4.0,"I love this watch. It seems to work fine. I only gave it 4 stars because sometimes it won't lay flat. The ends get over the watch face. Other than that, I really like it. Nice and stylish."
4.0,"Yes they have similar colors, but they are beautiful,  well made earrings.  A couple pairs are almost duplicates. But honestly, where can you find so many sets of earrings that you will actually wear for such a great price."
4.0,"I love my earmuffs...they are sold out everywhere.  I probably paid too much for them, but they were a must have for me."
4.0,Like the material. It's a great running around dress. I ordered a large. I could have gotta by with a medium or even a small. I am 5'1 135pds. I is huge. I now wear it as a night gown. It's very light weight material. Great for the FL 100 degree heat. Oh also bust 38 c waist 33 hips 40.
4.0,"The colors are a bit deceiving. The dark color is more of a brownish red color. The chain is black. I thought the pics made it look like it is black and red. It's pretty much something you could find at the Family Dollar store. Good cheaper costume jewelry though. Overall I'm happy with it. Ya get what u pay for, I guess!"
4.0,"Very nice dress. Nice comfortable material, fits awesome except that u should buy a size smaller than your own. I'm a xxl and I bought a xxl but it was a tad bit too big especially around the bust area. But then im a B cup so probably you may not have the same issue that I did. Anyway it fit great and looked great ant that's all that's important."
4.0,"I really love the comfortable fabric. They were a little big, I am petite,  but still look nice."
4.0,"Bought as a gift for daughter, I think it's very cute and she'll enjoy the Harry Potter-ness of it."
4.0,Dress runs big. But beautiful dress and print.
4.0,"Bought this dress last minute because it was the only one that would ship in time for an event I was attending. I received the dress about an hour before the event. I was not expecting much but the dress is beautiful, I got many compliments on it. It drapes surprisingly well and it is thick (not see through) but stretchy at the same time. I was able to put it on without using zipper.  From reading reviews and sizing chart, I picked the M, which fir great on top and left plenty of room to move. Only issue is that it was a bit long as I am short and usually wear a S bottom. The dress pretty much fit just like the picture except the bottom hem was couple of inches below the knees. If I had purchased this sooner, I would have had it hemmed, otherwise it is a perfect dress."
4.0,"I really like this pair of earrings, they are cheap and super cute, took a while to ship but it's worth the wait. The on,h problem I have with them is the fact that they are very oddly shaped making it a bit difficult to put in, but once you get them on they look really good."
4.0,"Fits great around my body, but is tight in the upper arm. Guess the manufacturer thinks that larger girls have skinny arms?"
4.0,Very good quality for the price. My only con is the skirt is a little bit stiffer. Maybe after I wash it it will be ok. Other than that i love it!
4.0,"Color is great, a soft lilac. This is one of my favorite bands. Quality is just a little bit lower than the original band that the Fitbit comes with, only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,I love it and I’m very pleased
4.0,"Arrived fast & it is a great fit, except high wise. It is too long for me, I am 5'3, but paired with wedges it fits perfect."
4.0,"Pretty awesome wallet. Wish the map of the game was brighter and more detailed but it looks great, made a huge fan of the title happy."
4.0,"Comfortable, just have wider feet so I needed more flexibility in the bands around the toes"
4.0,It seem a bit smaller than what was shown in the pictures. But I love the color how it looks
4.0,Beautiful watch.  Looks like real diamonds.  Only complaint is it is a little heavy ... but I get used to it.
4.0,The dress fit nicely (true to size) although it was longer than I expected. Flattering style. Good thick fabric.
4.0,I like these glasses. Very nice glasses and they fit well. I would really buy these glasses again. They don't look cheap.
4.0,Runs small. I ordered a size up and they're still almost too snug to wear.
4.0,These leg warmers keep my legs warm on those bitter cold winter days. They are pretty and stylish too.  The fit is snug.
4.0,"feels great and secure, little tricky to attach to watch correctly, instructions are not great.  Had the smaller size and had to ""unloop"" it to remove, it was to tight to slide off hand for charging and it was tricky to hook back on arm with magnetic end tab and the band being metal.  Larger model has magnets on both ends of band which contacts with metal band when trying to remove.  Like that it is secure and  comfortable, but takes time to learn how it works."
4.0,"The colors are beautiful and the material is nice.  However, this was supposed to be a man's X-Large and I wouldn't call it an XL.  I bought it for a costume in a local theater production.  I think I can modify it and still use it, but future buyers should know that it is sized small."
4.0,Works well with hankies
4.0,Not as much slack at the back like the picture shows.
4.0,"Cute casual dress, very comfortable. I recommend sizing down. Since the bottom half of the dress is loose and the material is stretchy, you can definitely buy a smaller size."
4.0,"The sweater is big and comfy just as I had hoped, but I ordered the color khaki and it is definitely more of a dusty rose/pinkish color."
4.0,I loved the print and it seemed nice quality but was just a bit too big.
4.0,It’s okay 👍🏾
4.0,"Was a little bigger than I assumed it would be. After a short time, it became uncomfortable to wear."
4.0,"Very cute but not a full size back pack. My daughter still loves it though, she is ten and loves damask."
4.0,I am 6' 2&#34; 175 lbs.  I have long arms and the sleeves are a tad too short.  Everything else fits fine.  I know its a compression but it is not overly tight.  The fit is a little more loose than most compressions mostly due to me being thin I suspect.  But I will have to order the XXL to fit my long arms.
4.0,Fair price. A little shorter than we hoped but still a fun accessory.
4.0,Very nice shirt.  Not too heavy.  Sleeve length is great although I wish the fitted ends at the wrists were a little stronger.  The shirt length is a little too long if you wear your shirts untucked.
4.0,We purchased this for a variety show. It was just fine.  A bit thin but pretty.
4.0,"If you have longer arms, the sleeves would be nice."
4.0,Pretty. Have not used yet to see if works as well on wrist.
4.0,"Very prett!!!, but my neck becomes black :P"
4.0,Poof. Still a little sheer but the best I've foundlike this under $22.
4.0,"This is a really nice bag, it holds a lot of things.  I was very satisfied with the purse."
4.0,This dress is super adorable. I steamed all of the wrinkles out and it looks perfect. I was aware of the bow folding/flopping/not staying put thanks to other reviews. It can easily be fixed by securing it with a larger safety pin or even an alligator hair bow clip and some hot glue. I'm totally okay with having to tweak a few things when I can purchase a dress this cute for such a cheap price.
4.0,i get cold really easy (im only 100 pounds) so even though the medium sits just a little big for me (should grow into it once i gain some weight) it keeps my back and neck muscles from cramping up (which is nice since i have a compressed C5 and C6). I would definitely buy another if the small ever becomes available again and i get the extra money!
4.0,"Panrs were epic, the material is very thin, but very comfy."
4.0,"This is a god design, very supportive and still looks good. I would buy this again."
4.0,"The packaging for this product was really cute. It almost was like I had purchased from a little boutique. This skirt is beautiful and I received a lot of compliments on it. The material is very sturdy, I knocked off a star because the zipper area had a lot of thread that made it difficult to get the zipper up. Once I removed it was just fine. The skirt fit me well and it came right above my calves, I'm 5'0. I paired this with a green top. It can be dressed up or down, for church or a brunch. The best thing about this skirt is it allows you to be modest and stylish all at once."
4.0,Very cute item.  Smaller than i was expecting.  Was a hit for my son.
4.0,"Be aware that you probably need to get a couple sizes larger but overall I really like these pants. I have a few of them, they're just so comfy!"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:1f7d0d8b463ae2fbc285ac8c7ca1dfeb]] Love it. Better than I expected.  The only drawback is that doesn’t fit everyone.
4.0,Magnets worked bracelets true to size
4.0,"Love it! Soft and comfortable, I gave 4 stars due to after a few hours wearing it, it loosened a  it and had to be re-tied"
4.0,"I agree, the material is thin and the blue is a lot brighter. The bow is not attached, comes as a sash you tie yourself. Overall I like it, fits and good price ($10). Using it for a beach vacation, it will be good as a casual (maybe even a little dressier dinner/night event).<br /><br />Had no trouble with the arm holes, they’re an appropriate size."
4.0,"This has a lot of compartments, which I love.  I just ended up finding something I liked better.  It is very cute though."
4.0,Well made.  Was just large on me so I had to return it.
4.0,The biggest size is just a wee bit skimpy in the cups. I'm not that vuluptious!
4.0,"Good top, but order a size up. I’m usually an xs-s and I had to return for a medium."
4.0,"While travelling on business, I used this bag as a pocketbook and a laptop bag. I was able to fit everything I needed it. The front pocket is big and comes in handy."
4.0,I bought this for myself when my dad passed and I love it. It’s a little heavier than I was expecting but it looks just like the picture. I love that it comes with different charms so you can pick the birthstone. Beautiful piece
4.0,Love these! I am a shopper for Shipt and deliver groceries. I have gotten lots of compliments in how sturdy they look and great stacking. I have bought 4 total in the past 2 weeks. Tonight one of my lids tore. Not happy about that but overall would recommend.
4.0,"Looks great.  Haven't tried washing it yet, hope it washes well."
4.0,Long but I like it
4.0,Very cute and eye catching.
4.0,This was waaay smaller than what I was expecting. But very pretty.
4.0,I love these pants but sent them back because I hate the fabric. Reminded me of my grandma’s pants back in the day. But I loved the fit. Just couldn’t get over the fabric. Wish it was silky.
4.0,Fits great. Product is stylish and the quality is good.
4.0,"I wear a 2X or 20W in dresses or tops at Cato's. A 1X or an 18W in pants or skirts at Cato's. I bought a 5X in this shirt. You do the math. The top fits, but there is no room for shrinkage in the wash. Plus side, it's cute and cool. Nice weight cotton."
4.0,Very very cool
4.0,"It came tangled in the box. My son bought it for his girlfriend, but they broke up, my daughter untangled it she likes it."
4.0,"Great price, comfortable and versatile exercise top.  Similar top cost $80 to $90 at Athleta."
4.0,My daughter loves these.  They look nice and feel comfortable
4.0,Cute and comfortable. Looks better on than on the rack.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with this ring. It looks exactly as it does in the pictures. It's sized a bit larger than an other 13 ring I have, so I'm going to return it and get a smaller one. Amazon makes the return process incredibly easy. The ring has a high polish finish to it that really shines. The dual cables are seated nicely showing no frays. The screws add that machine type look to top it off.<br /><br />Not only is this ring thick in width (10mm), but it is also thick from inside to outside. I'd say about 2mm. It's much thicker than any other ring I have. If you are going to purchase one, I'd go a half size smaller. I like the ring too much to not have it fit properly. You will be happy with this ring, especially at this price."
4.0,Cheaply made but holding up. Seem more like a kids size
4.0,Good product. Fits well. As advertised.
4.0,"I am 5'2"" and I ordered XL.  It covered all the down to my calves so it works great with rain boots. Can't wait to test it out in the rain!"
4.0,Very cute and very well made for the price.  It was just a little to small of an opening for my hands and wallet. It went back
4.0,I love it but definitely shouldn't be called long sleeved it is more 3/4 sleeved also it is a nice shirt to hide the love handles it dresses up your jeans and is great with full length leggings and some heels. It goes from casual to dressy with ease
4.0,"I really love this, it's beautiful. My only thing, which it was my fault might I add, one of the gems was loose and I was messing with it and it feel out. It isn't noticeable though, so it doesn't bug me. ^u^"
4.0,I like how Comfortable they are.<br />The Problem is that they don't last more than a Couple of Years.
4.0,"This is a nice, soft, comfortable hoodie. Looking at the photo before ordering, I thought it would be a fairly thin sweatshirt, but I was pleasantly surprised when I received it. It's thicker than I thought it would be, with a soft fleece material on the inside. This is a good hoodie to wear for a cool summer night or chill fall day. Thought I wear size XS/S tops, I like my hoodies to fit baggy on me, so I got this in a size L. I love the oversized look and feel and it makes it more comfortable. Though this fit me as expected, loose and baggy, it wasn't as long as I would like. Most of my size L hoodies are long enough to right fit below my butt, like a mini dress. But this doesn't go past my lower waist. That's just a personal preference because I wear leggings majority of the time and I like to wear long shirts and hoodies to cover to my upper thighs. That's the only reason I gave 4/5 stars. I love the color and design and can wear this everyday."
4.0,Snagged mine in the bay for $120 less. Good watch. Got this to supplement my Blue Angels world chronograph. Had trouble finding it here because Amazon doesn't list it as Blue Angels which is what I searched for. No complaints. Three links were easily removed to fit my smaller wrist. Good well designed clasp. Very comfortable. Am learning how to use the calculator ring. This wins over clunky g-shock. Recommended.
4.0,"It's okay, kind of cheap made, but expected for price. Overall good. For the price not much more to expect."
4.0,"Just what I needed. A strap that holds my glasses on snugly.  Also, no long cords hanging down!"
4.0,"UPDATE 06-25-2020:<br />The seller contacted me a few days ago and offered to send a replacement of the current product, which is the one pictured in the Amazon site, or give a full refund. Since I waited a month to get the original order I asked for a full refund.<br /><br />I explained to the seller that I have sensitive skin so I ordered these thinking it was cotton. They assured me the updated product is cotton and has the slot inside for filter.<br /><br />As promised I received my full refund.  One of my other coworkers had also ordered this set after me and another coworker ordered.  Although two of us received the wrong product she received the right product today.<br /><br />I was initially upset and frustrated, but the customer service from the seller was great so updating my rating based on service and not the product as I don't know how the new product works.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />The product I received IS NOT the product I purchased. I ordered the 10 masks pack.  Please see my pictures of what I thought I was getting and what I actually received.<br /><br />There is no inside slot to put filters in, the ear piece is not adjustable as it's a predetermined cut of some elastic material.  The mask portion is made of some form of spongy material.<br /><br />Before writing this review I decided to handwash one and try it on.  It is comfortable enough on the ears, but the chemically odor from the material makes it difficult to keep the mask on. The valve works to release most of your exhaled breath but my glasses still get fogged up a little because some of your breath is still inside the mask.<br /><br />I ordered this when one of my coworkers ordered it and got it first. Both of our orders were shipped the same product that is NOT the product we purchased.<br /><br />I noticed a few other reviews giving it 5 stars but don't believe them as the review DOES NOT show ""verified purchase"" from them."
4.0,I received my shirt wish it was longer in  The waste area  But over all good
4.0,"A little thin for winter wear,but will be fine for warmer months."
4.0,"Nice product and good quality material.<br />I just thought that it’s not very comfortable since the material is not very smooth.<br />Other than that, really nice option."
4.0,"Love the whole dress , exspecially the colors it was just to long and to big!"
4.0,This dress is made to be light and whimsical! I would recommend ordering it a size down
4.0,"comfortable, don't fog up that much.  Not good for diving"
4.0,Loved this dress. Wore it to chaperone prom and it was perfect. You can dress it up with heels or dress it down with flip flops!
4.0,"My watch is rose gold but this was very pink. I returned it. I was replacing another one like it. It was always catching my my clothing and ruined a couple of sweaters. I thought that it was just that band, but I could see the new one would do the same."
4.0,"Well made, very soft on the inside.  Super warm and cozy.  I bought a size up from my normal size and it’s still a bit snug."
4.0,This bag has tons of room and it is very sturdy! It has several internal pockets and it is machine washable.
4.0,"The pants size 36 US was a perfect fit for me, but had to return it because it was difficult for me to put my hands inside the pockets.  I had to buy 38 US, so I can actually get things out of my pockets without hurting my hands."
4.0,"I'm very short, so the belt loops and sash were too low on my frame, I just moved the belt loops and ...perfect."
4.0,really cool looking and i love the design on the side. i did drop them and they broke so the quality is average but then again i should be more careful with my sunglasses lol
4.0,We're really like this ring! The only drawback is its just a bit long on my husband's finger.
4.0,Ordered this on the sixth of January. Received on the sixteenth. A little longer to received than usual. Happy with the product. Good variety of colors. For under $2 an item well worth the wait.
4.0,I wish they were a little wider.  I really have to cram to get my &#34;script&#34; glasses underneath.
4.0,"Looking at the size chart measurements I fit in the XL... ordered it... SO HUGE... but I loved the dress. I returned and ordered a medium, fits great."
4.0,"I bought this for a student as a prize for reading a novel and writing the best essay. Not sure why it is this color here, but got it in red to emulate Holden Caulfield."
4.0,"pain in the cheeks to size it, but overall a cheap watch"
4.0,arrived on time and as described<br /><br />slight problem with the construction allowing my foot to sit sideways otherwise would be five star... not bad enough to return just not good as could be.  in general nice product
4.0,"These are bery nice looking, but were smaller than expected. If you have thick hair, you might not be able to fit as much in as you like."
4.0,"This is a shower sandle, there is no arch support, however, it is what I expected for gym, sauna, spa use. The price is right. It is quick dry, &  light in my gym bag."
4.0,"Very nice, but the cat did fade a little bit after the first wash."
4.0,"Looks like the picture but a little bit large in the fit. I wouldn't say order a different size than normal, but don't expect it to fit perfectly."
4.0,"I read other comments that the straps where too short, so I order a size up. Now the straps are perfect but the blouse is too wide for me so I need to sew it to make it fit for me. But anyways I like the material and the blouse is gonna be so cute when I fix it!"
4.0,I wear between size 6-7 and this is too big. I think I can take the last loop out and be fine
4.0,"These are nice quality gloves.  Unfortunately, they are too narrow for my hand.  I cant go up a size due to finger length so I will be returning them."
4.0,Very fun colors! True to size and looks great on!!
4.0,I love this toe ring but am a bit concerned on how long it will last taking it off periodically.<br />It feels a little flimsy. It looks great!
4.0,Very pretty. I love it.<br />One little gem fell off and I had to use super glue to put it back.
4.0,"As others have said - the length on these is much shorter than appears in the photo, so I was expecting that at purchase. However despite that, these are still very nice beads. No they're not Neiman-Marcus quality costume jewelry, but they are much better than what you'd find in a costume shop or dollar store. Mine have smooth beads without jagged or rough seaming on them. The rhinestones on the ends are a nice touch and overall these are worth the money spent."
4.0,"I wanted a slip-in house shoe with good support. This shoe/slipper provides just what I wanted and the quality seems first rate. I had to exchange my first delivery to get a 1/2 size smaller. The side adjustable tabs and slip in sole inserts give a bit of snugness adjustments, but I’d advise that at least 1/2 size less than your normal size is warranted. Seller was very cooperative."
4.0,The wallet was a little bulkier than I had anticipated. That's largely because of the zipper mechanism.
4.0,"This hoodie is nice and looks great on. It has been made well. The stitching is neat and there are no loose threads. It is thinner than I expected but it will be okay for the mild Arizona weather. I got this for my 5’10, 180lb athletic teen, in a size large and the bottom is really tight on him, which is okay because he is slim, it’s just tighter than he’s used to for a hoodie but I think this would be uncomfortable on anyone with a bit of a belly."
4.0,"Fits well and very warm.  Easy to fold the flaps up and out of the way, and also back down.  Only two things prevent a 5 star score:  1) adjustable cord in back of hat came right off but it fit so well that I didn’t need it,  2) there isn’t a way to stash the removable face mask."
4.0,Light weight and easy to put on. I do wish that they were a little darker though. Inexpensive but well made.
4.0,Slightly cheap looking but great for the price
4.0,The quality looks great but it does run small. Had to return:( otherwise I would have kept it.
4.0,"I wish there were more reviews for when I was buying so I figured I’d make one! I LOVE this shirt! The material isn’t what I expected though. It’s not cotton and it’s very stretchy (but breathable which I love). I can’t remember what size I got but I believe it was a Large (fits more like a medium). Overall, not disappointed! Love this shirt!"
4.0,It’s cute but does fit my neck more like kids size ...my daughter 7 and it fits her better to me it’s like a choker
4.0,"With the low profile and side attaching points, these goggles stay on my daughter's face without pulling back during practice or swim meets."
4.0,"It is a great looking helmet, and obviously is well made.  However, it did not fit me.  It was snug around my upper head, but not uncomfortable. The fit at my cheeks was the problem, as it was so tight as to hurt.  My jaws are fairly square and large.<br />Thus I could not keep it.  I am happy to say the supplier allowed me to return it for a refund."
4.0,The monocle had been broken off the mask. I can glue it back on or leave it off. I will be able to see through the mask better.
4.0,"I routinely take a 2x in all my clothes. This size is usually a little big for me, but I like loose fitting clothes.<br />I had to return the 2X- which by the way was dragging on the floor and buy the next size up."
4.0,Good quality for price. They didn’t fit my type of nose but overall really pretty shape
4.0,Killed them the first day  at work. But I liked them until then.
4.0,Went by sizing chart my daughter fell between L and XL we opted for XL due to limited time frame for return if need be. XL was a bit too large although because there is a lace up back we were able to adjust it fairly well without having to return
4.0,I like this band but it could be a little longer my wrist is small and when I extend it to the max I have to fight to get my hand through but after I get it through I can adjust it to where it needs to be. I recently got it can’t say much yet but overall it’s nice. If anything changes I will update my review
4.0,"Shirts are fine, just run too small for my frame."
4.0,"Compression is tight, but comfortable."
4.0,Fits great hangs so nice but If you have a tee shirt under ...It bulks up &amp; shows hem on sleeves. So sleeveless top is only way to wear this.
4.0,It's really simplistic and I think that's what makes it look so nice. I wear this everyday and the 'engraving' has lightened up a bit but it's still there. Also I'm pretty sure the date should be 2013.06.13 but I guess that's up for debate lol but this is a nice way to have bts close to your heart~
4.0,"This layered camisole is a cute style and a good basic to wear under a jacket with pants or a skirt. The fabric is an average quality 100% polyester, and the seams look well done. This is my second top in this brand, and sizing is a challenge. It seems to run about a size smaller than standard women’s sizing but larger than the size chart on the product page. The chart says an XL is a size 8, but that’s wrong as the XL fits me and I can never wear an 8.  The XL fits me but the bottom layer is form fitting and seems a bit small for an XL (usually a roomier fit on me).<br /><br />Still, this sheer cami is comfortable enough as I don’t need to wear a bra as the bottom layer holds me in and also keeps this cami from being see through in front (it’s sheer in the back with only one layer). I like the round neckline with pleating on the top layer and thin adjustable straps, plus the V in the back is cute. The top hangs well, though it would flatter me more if it was cut a touch bigger so it had more movement and was a little longer. I’m 5’11” so the length probably isn’t an issue for most and this may be a better cut for someone shorter.  Overall, I like this cami, though it’s not an ideal cut for me. 3.5 stars."
4.0,I love these socks. The little rubbery pieces on the back ankle area are great and I never have a problem with them slipping down in my shoes. The only problem I have with them is that they are a little bit smaller than I expected. I wear a size 8 shoe so my feet aren't especially large but at the end of the day when I take off the socks my toes and toe nails are a little bit sore from the scrunching of the day.
4.0,"The dress is pretty however, i ordered a medium. I will return item and order a large."
4.0,"This is super cute and fits as expected but was a lot thinner than we expected it to be.  Thankfully, we live in a warm climate where we don't need super thick hoodies.  This would not be effective in a northern climate except maybe on a cool summer night. But again - it's super cute!"
4.0,I like the long length of the strap and it is roomy enough to hold my  other necessities without the bulk of having to put it down while shopping
4.0,"We bought this for our granddaughters and they absolutely love the tent. They've been using it in the house.  However, a few of the accessories were missing (compass and water container I think).  Parents weren't concerned about that though, so that's good."
4.0,"Really wish this style was available in a 30FF or a 30G, as well as in white/&#34;red&#34;(which looks to be more like a magenta color).<br /><br />I have the 32F in black. Although I wish the band fit a bit tighter and the cups were closer to my size, the lace does a fairly excellent job of keeping everything in its proper place (though with the way the 32F fits, I still need to tuck the girls back in to avoid some minor spillage in front). The one time I tried criss crossing the straps in the back, it really hurt my back for some reason. Same with making it a halter. But oh the versatility!! Another (and my final) complaint is the way the underwire lays on your ribcage. It's very hard, causing pressure in the shape of an elongated 'w' right underneath the bust, which is unpleasant at first and takes some getting used to.<br /><br />The reason I still give 4 stars is because this is a BEAUTIFUL bra and so unique in its design. For those of us with larger busts/smaller waistbands, there is nothing made like this bra. And at the time of this review, it is only $12.99, which is an absolute steal.<br /><br />It goes great with flowy tops that have lower necklines or exposed shoulders/sides, as it really doesn't look like a bra but more of a bralette/lacy top.<br /><br />If they make this in your specific size, I highly recommend it!"
4.0,"I bought the green glasses to help with excessive headaches and they are my primary sunglasses now! The price is great and the tint isn't excessive while being helpful. Only downfall is that I dropped them and they got fairly scratched up, but that's my fault!"
4.0,Loved quality of dress but too short
4.0,"Fits nice, however, I had expected it to be taller, but it is what it is."
4.0,Could be longer
4.0,I like grandma says she’s happy with this stuff
4.0,Great for the season but they are really cheap! I’m not sure they’ll last longer than one year
4.0,Large in bust.
4.0,I tried on this shirt as soon as I got it. It fits perfectly and looks great. I can't wait to wear it to a Hocus Pocus viewing party later this month and every Halloween season from now on.
4.0,"Thought this shirt would be blue, but ended up getting a black one.<br />Still fit as expected and husband liked it"
4.0,"Product came packaged okay, the two are very different in color but overall very solid."
4.0,Fits snugly with elastic waistband. I was hoping for a looser fit but kept because it is stretchy and comfortable. I bought to use as loungewear around the house. It is lightweight and washes well.
4.0,Well worth your time very pretty.
4.0,The material isn’t the comfiest so I’m going to wash it and use fabric softener with hopes that will improve the feel of the material. But for $10 I can’t complain. I sized up to XL and I’m glad I did. I like my pjs to fit loose. I’m 5’6 180lbs and super happy I got this!
4.0,"Beautiful jacket, but runs small.  I reordered the larger size, and will be returning the one I received that is too small.  The jacket is very well made, and the leather is very elegant and soft to the touch.  It's a classy jacket, which is why I'm re-buying it in a larger size...just order a larger size that you think you need!"
4.0,Looks very nice on my Pandora beqcelet
4.0,Better quality than expected- super thick<br />Will need to have altered due to length<br />Great dress for price
4.0,"I wanted to LOVE this shoe. I have a small toddler who is just walking at 16 months. We went to Stride Rite and had his foot measured, and he was a size 4. As you can see in the photo, the size 4 Stride Rite shoe (brown) is significantly smaller than this tennis shoe (gray). Too bad since they are super cute and a great value. Will be returning and they don’t carry it in a smaller size :("
4.0,Not real cheap but look nice and UV protection is very good.
4.0,"Great buy, good quality"
4.0,"I liked the material and color. It was comfortable and fit well. I’m 4’10” and it was a little too long for me, though, so I had to return it. I’d get it in a petite if they had it!"
4.0,"Came in the mail a few days early, and looked just like the picture. I didn't break it, but I would suggest being careful with the chain."
4.0,Me gusto las lunas espejadas ayudan bastante
4.0,"For the amount of spandex, it is not very giving.  I have arthritic fingers and it's difficult for me to pull up fabric that is not stretchy.  Have seen better products.  Print is beautiful!"
4.0,Beads look larger in picture but are nonetheless very nice. Will not feel uncomfortable giving this as a gift for any age group. Am stocking up on these type of bracelets to have on hand for any occasion. This will do the trick.
4.0,Material kind of cheap but over all outfit is cute & fits perfect
4.0,"I highly recommend checking the size chart prior to ordering and order according to the size chart.  These are made for very tiny people.  I'm 5' 2"" 120lbs and normally can wear a Small or sometimes Medium.  According to the size chart, I needed an XL.  That's what I ordered.  A Large probably would have been perfect.  So if you don't want to have to return them, check the size chart.  As for quality, comfort, and softness, they are great."
4.0,"Nice product, shipped in a nice box.  Was nervous the enclosure would not work well but I have not had any issue with it staying on.  Wraps twice around my wrist."
4.0,"Nice bag, good quality materials and closures, but the compartments are a little small for daily use, and the strap is short, too.  I can wear it with the strap *fully* extended (as in be careful it doesn't pull out) but it still feels snug. I think this si probably the right size for teens, but not for me (grandma)."
4.0,The necklace is nice. It’s not as bulky or as large as it appears. It’s nice and sturdy. It won’t make a bold statement like I wanted but it’s still nice.
4.0,I bought this for my husbands Halloween costume. He was a milkman and I was a 50's housewife. The hat was a perfect addition and everyone loved it!
4.0,got it for a gift for my niece and she love it it was just like picture
4.0,I bought this for my husband. He likes it. We got the stainless steel one that's 7.5 in size. It looks shiny and it seems sturdy made. I would suggest before ordering that the wrist be measured to make sure the size is correct. The quality of the bracelet is right on the mark!
4.0,Gorgeous style and okay glasses. I expected them to feel nicer considering the cost. Overall decided not to keep them.
4.0,"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter, and it is completely adorable!  It was bigger than I expected, however.  Would actually be a great size for an adult, rather than a child.  She uses it though and likes it. As another reviewer said, she can fit a chapter book in it.  It's flat though, so you can't fit a toy or stuffed animal in it or anything."
4.0,The garmet has been good so far however the sizing does run small and I should have gotten a size larger. I ordered three large and I'm about a size 10-12. The pad is cushiony and covers the right places.
4.0,"The bra is very comfortable, but not very supportive. I'm a DDD/F cup and the bra provides VERY little support. I will keep &amp; use them, but definitely will not be able to wear them when doing anything with medium to high impact."
4.0,Cute dress and sizing is just like it shows
4.0,"I just love the pattern on this dress.  I was surprised to see flannel in a summer dress. The dress fit well enough, but because it is flannel, I worried about shrinkage, so I returned it"
4.0,"Nice product, arrive on time."
4.0,Very cute bellow button ring. Hasn't turned green or anything. Only thing I'm unhappy with is the ball fell off the 2nd day of having it in.
4.0,"I am nearly 6ft tall, and weigh approximately 160lbs, so I ordered a medium. The sweater fits almost perfect expect the sleeves are just a little bit too baggy. Also, the color I picked was New Navy, but trust me it is definitely not navy. It looks purple."
4.0,I wear a size 13 and have a very narrow foot and with socks (boot socks) my foot seems like it is wedged in the boot. Great quality for the price was not disappointed at all just does not fit as expected it should.
4.0,I ordered these to share with my animal lover friend. We both love them. Them seem sturdy and fit our average wrists sizes. The only reason I am not giving this product 5 stars is the purple bracelet looks more pink then purple.
4.0,"This is very pretty, fits nice, looks dressy."
4.0,Small but very stunning.
4.0,It’s a Christmas present!
4.0,"My arms are huge, so it is tight on me, but I like it. It is very thin, so good for late summer."
4.0,Yes. The flower girl lined it.
4.0,It’s great for the most part put has a  tendency to slide off
4.0,Very long. I'm 5'7 and will have to roll them up or get them altered.
4.0,These are too cute.  Fit is exactly as expected.
4.0,I needed a new swim suit and saw this one on here.  It has a very nice fit around the areas you want it to be. The drawstring is perfect and has enough give so that you don't have to struggle.
4.0,"this little bracelet is so adorable! i love it so much, the only thing is that its not adjustable. or if it is, ive had it for two weeks and still havent figured out how to adjust it.. :( other than that its great! very classy looking accessory :)"
4.0,"These work well, are strong, and stay together but my daughter complains they make her shoes too tight."
4.0,I love these chokers!  The width isn't too wide or super thin the links in the back ensure a perfect fit (I'm plus size)  and the little furballs are super cute! Two things I was surprised to see.  I kind of expected the GREY fur to be a little lighter it's maybe an ash grey color and I also expected the little fur balls to be a little bigger.  They are about the size of a quarter.  These two things still don't throw me from loving them they really are super cute and I can't wait to wear them!  I may be making more purchases with this vendor in the future 😊
4.0,The swimsuit fits and looks great. It covers the breasts and tummy well. It does not cover the bikini and butt area well. It is high. I will just buy a swim skirt to cover that area.
4.0,"Ordered the purse around noon time,arrived afternoon the next day. Nice packed. Got a nice picture of my front door with the Amazon package. Nice purse, with good textures. The size not to big not to small. It's big as my to hangs put together. Second time getting the same kind of brand."
4.0,The dress was shorter then expected. I was thinking it would come to the floor as I am 5 ft 7 inches. But I made it work. Otherwise the fit was fine.
4.0,Would’ve liked a larger size in top but couldn’t order that way. All in all pleased
4.0,"Seem solid, product is as described, they face opposite directions unlike some of the similar listings. They are fairly large for cuff links, but they work for me since I have larger build. Will update my review after some use."
4.0,Not having a lobster claw.
4.0,Great purse. Good quality.
4.0,very cute but it stretched out on me
4.0,Stone is smaller but the ring design is beautiful. True to size.
4.0,"The package came completely crushed, but it is a beanie so no big deal. I'm surprised at the sound quality, I expected poor quality but its actually pretty good. It fits a little funky and takes a second to adjust it on your head. Overall very happy."
4.0,"Very cute and flattering, but order 1-2 sizes up."
4.0,"Yup, it's a pee a boo shoulder sweater. Only four stars due to quality is a bit chincy, but at that price it's worth it"
4.0,Like a fitted hat but this will do
4.0,Fits good wish it was a little more fitted maybe an xsmall would have been good but other then that not bad
4.0,"It wasn't as crisp and pretty as the picture.  The bottom was poofy, but daughter likes it anyway...so that's great."
4.0,Love the graphic. Fits well.
4.0,"Fit as expected. Straps kind of fall a little but not really an issue, just rocked it anyways up or down works."
4.0,"Needed something for the shower at the gym, didn't want a ""slide"" and this worked perfectly"
4.0,"Love this ring. Very happy with the way it looks on. Only reason it got a four instead of a 5, is the integrity of the metal seemed to degrade a bit when submerged in salt water over an extended period of time...but I should have probably taken it off first BEFORE swimming in the ocean, so that really was on me. But it washed up easily and I still haven't taken it off and that was several weeks ago.  The metal is easy to manipulate to get it to fit (I have pretty small toes so this was important--it would probably look even better on larger toes), but still stayed in place once I got it placed the way I wanted it to on my toe."
4.0,The tool to remove links broke with the first twist.
4.0,I thought I ordered black and white Cat in the hat socks?
4.0,beautiful dress. size runs a little big
4.0,It broke my finger out after I wore it for awhile. Cute tho
4.0,"Too large, but guess it's my fault. I just wasn't sure.  Very nice, well make product, however."
4.0,"These socks are ok. Much longer than I expected. They are rather thick so, might be better for winter."
4.0,I liked most that it fit my shoe and I liked least that I still have to bend over a little bit to use the 18&#34; shoe horn.
4.0,I purchased 2. Red and 1 in black.  Both are to be used as part of costumes.  You are able of course to see thru the material which is good.  Will update this once the actual full costume w the mask is worn for a longer period of time.
4.0,Nice fit. Got lots of compliments
4.0,Very light weight.  I like the amount of skin itcovers.<br />I wish there was a pocket to put a filter in it.
4.0,"I love the stackable ring set, some were adjustable and fits perfectly on my slim fingers, very pleased."
4.0,"Comes with multiple of various types of piercings. Nose, labret, eyebrow, tongue, and snake bites. The labret piercings are a bit small. Rainbow colored. Good value for the price."
4.0,love the  look of it  runs  a  tad  smaller  though  by  like  about  an  inch
4.0,The box was torn on one side.But they were delivered right on time as expected. The shoes are cute and my granddaughter loves them.
4.0,"I like it, but don't love it. For me, there's a lot of material. I do have a smaller chest, so it was a bit bigger on me. It is a bit see through too.<br />I got a small. My measurements are 4' 11&#34;, 33, 27, 38."
4.0,"Although smaller in diameter than I expected, it is very nice! Actually, more my subtle taste and it sparkles just enough!"
4.0,It's comfortable and cool (temperature-wise) to sleep in.
4.0,"Comfortable fit, and buttons save ears from mask.  I only wish the buttons were a little bigger"
4.0,"This is adorable & helps me keep up with my keys. Only did 4 stars because my cards go too far into some of the slots & I have to dig around for them. Other than that, it's a great buy!"
4.0,"Purchased this necklace very cute got alot of compliments from women and men . It looks similar to the real dancing diamond necklace that cost alot of money, when I wear my necklace all the time and people think I paid alot of money for It. Hahhha.... my secret........to having nice quality things at a cheaper price.the only thing I don't like about is the chain can be more silver it turned colors quickly after. Couple of wears.."
4.0,I'm 5'7. 128 lb.  small size fits well. Actually the material is pretty nice and it's not transparent at all coz it has a layer inside.  When you ride up the waist bell will be hard to see your feet unless you stick it out by purpose.  Chest part covers up just alright.
4.0,Like them all. Some were a little heavy but very cute and pretty.
4.0,comfortable and stylish... Havent taken it off since I got it
4.0,"bought this for working outside in ND winters. Was skeptical, but figured id give it a try. It does the trick though for a short period of time. not as warm as a carhart, but this is much better if you have to wear a hard hat and safety glasses and it breaths. my carhart would not let my hard hat sit snug on my head and fall of constantly. i would also overheat and get really sweaty somtimes when hauling hoses around. just wish the UA one was a bit cheaper. but hey, its UA. overall happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Bonito artículo, bien detallado, lo que esperaba"
4.0,"This is the second set of holders I have ordered and my comments are based on my impressions of the first set.  What I like about them is that they easily attach to both sets of glasses I typically wear and the length is sufficient to allow me to remove my glasses and allow them to dangle on my chest, for example when I want to look through a set of binoculars or the viewfinder on my camera.  Also, I like the brightly colored holders because they are less likely to get lost,  However, I needed to order the second set because the temple loops on a couple of the holders broke after only moderate use and I like to have a few pair handy, especially when I travel."
4.0,"Awesome for my toddler,<br />They are comfortable material and easy to put on and take off."
4.0,Fits small. But I'm going to buy more.
4.0,"I bought this watch because I knew it is very reliable. I am slightly disappointed that the strap has gone down, I have had another version of this watch that I lost year ago."
4.0,Only gave a 4 star because they are slightly see through. I normally wear a Lg so maybe that is why. The length is perfect!
4.0,"They were just what we had before, but didnt fix our problems"
4.0,For the price can't expect anything more. Purchase it for my husband he's satisfy wish I would have gotten the Navy or black.
4.0,Looks pretty on my wife's ankle.  She loves how it looks.
4.0,"Nice watchband that looks and feels good. Looks good on my Vostok watch. I'm not a large man and have medium sized wrists. This band fits me, but just barely. It's on the 2nd to last hole. If my wrist were any bigger, it wouldn't have fit. Otherwise, its a fine product."
4.0,This is an adorable apron that I wanted to keep even though I'd bought it as a gift...
4.0,"Great material for the price,  lovely and fit me perfectly , arrived right on time OMG Love it"
4.0,Pretty good for the price. The chain is a total joke tho. Still I love it.
4.0,Me. Gusto
4.0,I wouldn’t order these especially if yo have wide feet. But other that they are cute
4.0,Nice quality pen but disappointed that it is white and not purple as shown in the listing photo.
4.0,"I agree with other reviewers.  It is a very nice boot.  Stylish and quality made.  I felt the width is a half size smaller.  I normally wear size 5.5M dress shoes and size 6M for boots with thin socks.  After reading other review comments, ordered a size 6.5M.  The boot is a little tight with the same socks I wear for other boots.  Lengthwise is true to size so it is almost 1/2 an inch longer than my size 6 boots.  I felt the opening is a little wider too as it is a larger size to me.  It looks very nice with leggings and skinny jeans.  I also tried it with my boot cut / flare jeans.  Looks good.  I gave it 4 stars because of the width size."
4.0,These are ideal for running. They don't look the greatest but they function as designed. It is very easy to interchange lenses. The arms are very flexible so there is less chance of breakage.
4.0,I brought this because of the price. I was looking for a shoe-less looking for an accessory to give me a shoe/sandal look without actually wearing any for a beach wedding. The item is beautiful; it very much looks like the picture. Its very sparkly. Dependent on the lighting this will be a very nice costume jewelry piece.<br /><br />The only downside is that this item is not a pair as other accessory items I've ordered similar to this one. I wish I would've read that or it was advertised more clearly. Despite that it will fit the bill.
4.0,This hand muff is beautiful and feels very warm but it was supposed to have a pocket but it doesn't.
4.0,I think it's beautiful!!!!! The one thing I have an issue with is the shorts they are a bit snug around my thighs. I am 5'1 and 190 36ddd.I normally wear a l to xl I got the xxl. I do feel if you have a long torso the body of the romper may be uncomfortable. I hope this helps
4.0,Faster delivery than said. They are a little cheaply made but I expected that. I am happy w product. I would order again.
4.0,It fit well once I actually got it on. I wear it to the gym and it stretches well. The hands are slightly off center but the material is comfy. Bought the harry potter one too. Really cute.
4.0,You need a belt. This is a pretty good one. And the latch mechanism is surprisingly nice; it's gotten to be kind of unsettling to go back to one I have to use a belt hole like some kind of savage.
4.0,It's a little big on a small wrist but it just fits. It's a great product for how much it costs.
4.0,Easy to install. Feels very good on the wrist.
4.0,"I purchased the 3XL.  I am an XL sized women with full figure bust, and it fits well.  Very comfortable, and the pads are great."
4.0,"Cool almost aviator looking sunglasses. They come in a nice protective case, the lenses are large enough that it blocks out all the sun from my eyes, and the black/gray color matches everything. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was because the earpieces are a bit thin, and seem very breakable if not careful. Other than that I love them!"
4.0,It is just as it appears though the sizing seems to run a tad on the bigger side.
4.0,"Tried different wearable blankets but my son won't let me put it on him, except this one, he like wearing it."
4.0,"Cute, soft fabric, ran small and had loose strings after one wash"
4.0,"I love this watch! You should make more in a selection of colors, a variety of colors. The face of the watch is big. Which is what I like plus it's inexpensive. I've already gotten comments on it the very first day I bought it. It would be cool if the minute hand & hour hand could glow in the dark or you could turn on a light at night to see the time. But I'm not going to complain. It is a decent watch. Anyone who likes watches this is a good sell."
4.0,"I think this dress is very cute. My daughter loved it. The fabric is silky not scratchy and has a nice twirl when spinning. It's perfect for a rainbow/kitty lover. As for the fit. I went with her true size and it does fit well. It's a little short, but my girl is taller than average. If I would have sized up it would have gaped around the arms. I will buy again if available when she grows out of it and will be going back to look at their other available merchandise."
4.0,size was a little large but product was beautiful
4.0,Great product for the price. Fits perfect.
4.0,"I love these leggings!  I am 5'4 and 150 lbs.  The high waist keeps my tummy &#34;tucked in&#34;.  I also like the compression in the legs, as it helps hide the imperfections in my thighs.  The fabric is heavy enough that underwear doesn't show through.  I wear these with long tunic's and love them.  I live in the mountains and winters are cold!.  These keep me warm, and I've been known to wear these to bed on a cold night!  The only reason I didn't give these a five is because they are just a little bit long for me. I will buy these again in another color.  My daughter liked them and stole a pair from me! (I guess that's a good thing, I'm 55 and she is 23)."
4.0,"Very good product. Came in a very reasonable time as when they said it would, came with everything that was described. Lenses seem like they will scratch easily, otherwise it would be 5 stars."
4.0,"I like this jacket, feels nice, not too hot great for layering. It looks just how it does in the picture. The only thing is that the size that you pick, does not match the size that you get. I am usually a size 12, but I was scared it might be too small so I got a size 14. I received an XL. Which it totally fits. I just wish they would put S, M, L etc, instead of number sizes."
4.0,"Love this, I’m a size 10, fits really well, my only complaint, stitching is not perfect but I can live with it."
4.0,"Big for a newborn, but they still work pretty well"
4.0,"This chiffon shirt gives you the perfect boho look whenever you are feeling like dressing like that. The off the shoulder falls off comfortably and does not feel uncomfortable to wear on the shoulder as many tend to do. The material is fresh and light. Depending on your liking, you might have to wear something underneath as the material is very thin but since this shirt fits me fairly loose, I feel like it is not so bad.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I am a very short girl and I feel like it fits me at an awkward length. Like not long enough for a dress but too long as a shirt. It may just be that I am not good at dressing boho chic as well though.<br /><br />I was offered this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,cute as can be and perfect for our little man and his first wedding
4.0,"A little tighter than I wanted but they still went over my knee so they did the job. Now, I have narrow skinny calves and legs so I was fine but if my muscles were any bigger there's no way they would fit. Aside from being tight, they are adorable and look great with some matching gloves I also bought."
4.0,Little tight in the calves but figured they would be from other reviews- once I wore them a couple days they stretched out a bit and fit perfect! Love them
4.0,I like the design and color of the bracelet. It is a little small though.
4.0,"While these are nose rings, I am using them for helix and lobe piercings.<br /><br />The faint rainbow sheen on one set is part of why I chose these particular rings. I have trouble with the screw on and tension ball surgical steel earrings eventually breaking or falling out - and being difficult to put back in - so I opted to try these.<br /><br />The pros: The thickness and size of the rings works well with my piercings (18 gague on both the lobe and helix). The larger rings in my bottom piercings are the easiest to change out and actually can be worn with any earrings with thin wire hooks without being removed.<br /><br />Cons: They are very difficult to bend into place properly if you have larger hands or fingers, especially when using the smaller millimeter rings. I have sensitive ears so putting new earrings in irritated them, making it even harder to close them around swollen spots.<br /><br />It feels close to impossible to fully close the rings once you have bent them slightly to insert them, and my hair regularly gets caught. I have to carefully twirl the ring until the gap is facing out and pull my hair through. Otherwise if they get caught and I try and sweep my hair back, it pulls. This has been bad enough to cause bleeding but I was lucky enough to not tear my lobe.<br /><br />I have been wearing these since they arrived though and they have not caused any pain from laying on my side, and I haven't had any issues with my 3 year old being able to grab and pull on them which is a plus."
4.0,The material and construction are both good. Can't beat the price and shipping was pretty prompt. My only disappointment was that the material wasn't a SMOOTH silk like a tuxedo lapel. It has a textured look.
4.0,"This is a cute blouse, a little short but cute"
4.0,"on the photo there is golden frame (looks nicer), but reality it's silver color :/"
4.0,"It was too big for my son, but was a very sturdy fabric and seemed to be well made."
4.0,"They are cute. But the threading attaching the mitten to the glove is weak and startstarted beginning undone after a few days. And a lil too big on the mitten part. Overall cute and exactly what I was looking for, minus the loose threading. Worth to sow up and fix, if the threading comes loose. I would still suggest this buy"
4.0,"I'm 5'3, 115lbs, 34b.  The medium is tight and very short on me.  Not a deal breaker because I intend to work out in it.  It looks cute under a tank."
4.0,"cute, supportive and good price however, it is sewn like the old days of 1950's with darts inside which provides more support but the darts/lines show on the outside thus your bosom is rather pointy. Not a good look for me so I'm returning it."
4.0,"very cute, nice mothers day gift for my daughter"
4.0,Very soft material.  Not as forgiving in the back area as I had hoped but still nice for the price.
4.0,"Love this little backpack. I took it with me on a week-long trip to Bali with 2 kids and it packed more of a punch than I thought it would. I carried in it a 750ml (approx. 25oz?) water bottle, a camera, small pack of wet wipes, small wallet and some snacks.<br /><br />My only gripe with this is the straps. They kept sliding off my shoulders. It’s not a deal breaker but it got old after a while.<br /><br />That said, I’d still recommend this if you want something compact, lightweight and affordable. Great for moms on the go, btw!"
4.0,"I ordered a size medium, it fits to size. The only problem is it looks like a washed out black. The color I chose was black. The color just wasn't as expected. Other than that it came on time & fits great."
4.0,"These pants look and feel pretty great.  I'm approx 105 lb and 5', I've got to cut about a mile off of the bottom but with this sort of fabric that won't really be an issue.  The pants do not have a hem on them but don't seem like they're gonna fray with is being a sort of silky polyester type of fabric.  I would have gone a full 5 stars but I was expecting a more cottony sort of fabric.  Either way, they are cute and comfy and the fit is good so I can't fuss too much."
4.0,Not as vertical/tall as the pictures but still super cute. Next day delivery with prime💓
4.0,"I was quite happy with the color and look, especially given the low cost."
4.0,"This is the second Weeping Angel bracelet I've bought my daughter in the past year. Frankly, the first one lasted longer than I expected, but with daily wear, the cord eventually broke. We both really like the charm, though. Others will see it as just a bracelet but if you look closely at the angel, its hands cover its face. Any Doctor Who fan will recognize it immediately, and it's kinda nice to be in that special club!"
4.0,This is a lovely dress. A bit big on me but a lovely color and design. It is a fit and flare that doesn't make me self conscious about my stomach!
4.0,"I like the quality, just fits more tight then I expected."
4.0,Cute little dress! Definitely will order more. I had to size up because I ordered my regular size 3x and the arms were very small but the bodice fit great. I love the quality of the dress and the print is amazing. So I gave my mom the first dress I ordered and then ordered the next size up. The sleeves fit but the bodice it's much bigger. I am not complaining though because I can not get over just how cute this dress is.
4.0,This louse is beautiful. It would have been perfect if it wasn’t to snug. I gave this four stars because of the size.
4.0,"Works great, perfect length for me (I'm 5'7&#34;) but if you're looking for a rubber coated handle, this won't be it.  The &#34;rubber&#34; which is basically as super thin coating of some sort of polymer, peels off when you touch it.  If one needs a grippy handle, this could be fixed with some grip tape. No biggie, just too bad it peeled off when I took the plastic wrap off it came boxed in."
4.0,Very nice quality and style. Comfortable
4.0,Perfect Shoes
4.0,"A bit see-through, material is kind of cheap so the print looks a bit different from picture. Still a beautiful dress though. Very comfortable. Just disappointed the &#34;long sleeved&#34; option was really 3/4 sleeves."
4.0,"I like these a lot, but the flower design ones are slightly too loose for my really petite frame.  The leaf ones are perfect, and the quality is great."
4.0,"Great boots, feel broke in immediately, and are lighter then my other steel toe boots because of the composite."
4.0,Gets the job done but is a little on the flimsy side.
4.0,Very good product would recommend
4.0,I purchased for a pre teen and she loves it! Nice!
4.0,The suit is beautiful. It looks identical to the picture.  I ordered the XXXL because it was listed as a 14-16 but the sizing is off. I really should have read more of the reviews and ordered a size down because XXXL fits more like an 18-20. The only other complaint I have is the strange pads that are in the bust cups slide around and made the top fit me weird. I passed this one on to a friend but I will be reordering this suit in a smaller size and cutting out the weird pads in the cups.
4.0,One strap broke while trying it on but it looks great so I will have that repaired.
4.0,"Got these for my 4 (soon to be 5) year old daughter. She currently wears a size 9 and I ordered a size 10 so she could grow into them. They fit great! They aren't too big but she will be able to grow into them and get some wear out of them. She hasn't been wearing them long, so I can't comment on lengevity but this is our third pair of Nikes. The first two lasted us a good while and we even &#34;rehomed&#34; them to some friends of ours who are getting good use out them as well. Will continue to buy these as my daughter grows! The price is daunting for a kids shoe, but for the quality it is worth it!"
4.0,Used as a uniform. I like the pockets.
4.0,"just what i expected. holds my glasses, compartments are large with a little extra room for my ray bans. looks nice, doesn't feel cheap"
4.0,The product is such thick and soft great quality however it ran too small. Definitely order a size up maybe even two
4.0,"This jacket is awesome. I have been using it on my hiking adventures. The best part is that the jacket has multiple pockets to stash small items with ease to access quickly. The vent placements, underneath the underarm and and along side the entire length of the other side, allows air to flow through when the weather is warmer and you have been active and need to cool off with out taken jacket off. They jacket also has snaps on the inside , bottom to secure in any weather.<br /><br />I have seen other jackets similar to this advertised for over $150 and more.<br /><br />The only con to this jacket is that they sent me the wrong size. I requested a small and they sent a large. That is the only reason why they are getting a 4 star rating."
4.0,M buen
4.0,Haven't washed it yet. Otherwise seems to do the trick.
4.0,worth getting.
4.0,I gave this necklace 4 stars because I thought it was made from real crystals and I don't think it is. Other than that the necklace is pretty. Has beautiful colors and is nice and sparkly.
4.0,Nice for the price color is true Blue.
4.0,"If your child is as much of an Elmo fan as mine is, he/she will LOVE it! The quality is as I expected, not incredibly soft (50/50) or thick, but the sheets have been washed at least 4 or 5 times and I haven't noticed any fading yet. Anyway, I figure for the length of time my son is going to be in the toddler bed and an Elmo fan, it's worth it!"
4.0,Some what small the tassels are shorter then they appear
4.0,Tie is wonderful...could produce a better lapel handkerchief though
4.0,Perfect carry-on bag for a 2-3 day overnight getaway. I actually use it as an additional carry-on with my 20&#34; wheeled luggage to avoid checking in my baggage at the airport. You can definitely fit a lot of things in it. It has a luggage sleeve to slide on to your luggage handle. Just wish the sleeve was a little thicker in width.
4.0,These were a gift and what new mother would not love to receive Carter's Onesies? - no mom I know! I loved Carter's Onesies when the &#34;new grandmother&#34; of this wee one was a baby herself! They were a bit small but mother was able to exchange for next size at store in Colorado so turned out easy-peasy.
4.0,"Our world needs constant reminders to spread kindness. Wearing this shirt will help to remind you and others around you to do just that.<br /><br />I am so glad that I chose to order this shirt. I chose to order the purple option, which I would describe as a lovely shade of lilac. The graphic design is nicely centered on the shirt. The white printing shows up crisply against the lilac background.<br /><br />The fabric is soft, smooth and just stretchy enough. All seams are finished. I did notice a few loose threads, but not many. I used the sizing chart to find my correct size.<br /><br />This shirt looks great with leggings and would also go well with a pair of jeans.<br /><br />I will enjoy wearing this shirt and spreading some kindness."
4.0,Well made. Proffesional looking.  Perfect gift for a fan.
4.0,"They were okay, I didn't like the nose piece's they are extremely irritating but other then that they were nice"
4.0,"Nice fit, superior support."
4.0,"Limited fields of vision, but an excellent mask all around."
4.0,It's durable and light weight.
4.0,"Absolutely love this top. The material was so soft. Unfortunately, it runs very very small"
4.0,"A fun necklace,  it has a nice weight to it and seems sturdy. Its a good value for the money. I would buy again."
4.0,"This dress, fits alittle small. I have a 29 inch waist, but it was snug. Sent back to order the large"
4.0,I really like the shoes but the heel was a little too high for me I thought they would be kitten heels the shoe is very sexy and if I could walk in them I would love them
4.0,Love the colors and compare with other maxi dresses the material is better.<br /><br />But beware! I'm a 12-14 and large is way too big
4.0,It is a very pretty top but the size was too small.
4.0,Would have been five stars but I noticed that these socks shrunk after a few washes.
4.0,"just as pictured.  It is thin material, but it's good quality.  Shipping took about a month."
4.0,Loved the boots! Just too big in size.
4.0,"I loved the fit, very sliming. The pads in the bust needed adjustment, but not a big deal. Overall, for the price of the swim suit, a great deal!! Can't wait to wear on vacation."
4.0,"First off, I ordered this outfit in gray, and what I received is definitely not gray.  It's more of a navy blue/white, with white being the prominent color.  It's still cute, but def not as advertised.  As other reviewers have noted, the shorts are short.  I'm petite (5'0&#34;) so I can probably still get away with wearing it, but mostly as a cover-up and around the house (not sure I'd wear it out-out). Cute, nonetheless, just wish I would've received the gray as I had ordered."
4.0,It's a nice ring but larger than I thought.
4.0,"I purchased a small, knowing that according to the size chart, it would be a little too big (my waist is 24 inches). It is in fact a little big, but nothing a little belt can't fix! I'm 5'0 and it comes a little bit past my knees. The fabric is really great though! Very soft and thick!"
4.0,Very loose and comfortable. Packs well. Light weight !
4.0,"Pros:<br />- Caaaaaute!  This is the kind of dress you can wear from farmer's market to Sunday brunch to date night by simply switching shoes and accessories.<br />- No bra necessary!  Fabric is double layered at the boobies, opaque enough to be free wit yo self.<br />- Comfy material with enough structure to stay put on windy days.<br />- Slightly tailored at the waist so it's not super boxy.<br />- Fits true to size with some room to hit the buffet line.  I'm 5'3&#34;, 120 lbs, and love long walks on the beach.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Not exactly as pictured.  The white is a whiter white than the ivory color on the model. But still cute!<br />- See through but not to an obscene degree. Don't plan to wear dark undies to keep it classy.<br />- Perforations in the eyelete are adorable but not if you are super tall.  On my 5'3&#34; frame, the solid fabric starts at mid-thigh.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this white dress for any occassion except for funerals, weddings, spaghetti dinners, wet-tshirt contests, and mud wrestling."
4.0,Size says 7-8. Fits more like a 4-5. Returning it so I can get a bigger size. Also the tag on the 7-8 says small. Shirt looks and feels great. The little Ferrari emblem on the sleeve is awesome! Ordering a different size.
4.0,"I have several pieces of orgonite and other EMF dampening materials. I use them in conjunction with a nano orgone frequency generator, which enhances the strength. I've found this piece holds a good reflective charge."
4.0,Purchased these for my teenage daughter and she wears them all the time. she says they are very comfortable. We plan on buying more.
4.0,"I will definitely wear the top, since it has two layers. The shorts are too see through to wear in public so I will probably cut them up and use the fabric for something. Size was accurate."
4.0,"I purchased these shoes for my son and he really likes them.  He is very flat footed,  these offer adequate support for his feet. Very pleased,  would recommend!"
4.0,Got what I paid for and it fits right for the piercings. It kind of falls off sometime because they’re so big.
4.0,Not the best material but the design is nice
4.0,"I love this bracelet and have a few different versions of it. I will ALWAYS wear them and expand my collection. They are classic, timeless, well made and beautiful."
4.0,"These run a little small, but otherwise good condition"
4.0,You get what you pay for.... nonetheless it works well.
4.0,If you wear a wide shoe the docks will fit very tight. To new to comment more about durability. Print is nice.
4.0,"Great buy, materiel could be a little softer but a great buy for the price. They fit just right."
4.0,Use them for my short hair. The keep it from sticking up.
4.0,Nice novelty.  I use them as an attention getter when photographing small children or babies.  Also works well as a gift to the small kids for behaving well or providing a good shoot.
4.0,"These earrings came in a nice little box with both metal and rubber backs. They look pretty good (dainty and delicate), though I wish they had a bit more pearly sheen to them. They’re secured sturdily to the posts, and I expect them to last a long time. 4 stars."
4.0,"I purchased a medium based on their size chart for bust size: I had to adjust the straps to the smallest to fit my shoulders. After doing so It has approximately a 2 "" gap under each armpit. Fortunately I sew so it's not a major fix. I am 5'1"" and 120 lbs. I only removed 1 star for fit.<br />Do not purcharse if you expect this to be dressy. It is a very casual knit dress and will work fine as a swimsuit coverup or with a lightweight denim jacket and sandals. Probably more appropriate for a teen/young adult as opposed to my nearly 60 year old petite frame."
4.0,"I ordered this shirt in red and it's a bright, pop of color. The shirt is nice and the material does not look cheap at all (it looks like a nice crepe material).  I am 5&#34;6 and 140 lbs. and the size large fit me perfectly (I normally wear a size medium in tops, so this blouse does run small). My only complaint is that the sleeves stick up a bit (they don't fall over the shoulders as in the picture) which is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. Also, note that while the back is a little longer than the front, it's not as long as it appears in the picture."
4.0,This face covers are very attractive. They do not provide full coverage because it’s a mesh cover but that also is why you can breathe easier. The fabric used is like a plastic lining which unfortunately sticks to your face and makes you sweat more. Better to wear during cooler weather.
4.0,"These are lovely earrings that are very feminine.  They are perfect for everyday wearing.  They go well with anything, dressy or not too dressy."
4.0,It was huge!!
4.0,"Its a great bag for work. It carries everything. It is well made and I'm hard on bags, great product!"
4.0,Was too long.
4.0,"Bought this watch as a present to replace my son's broken one. Apart from the lack of clear contrast at night, I think this is a very good watch at a good price."
4.0,They fit nicely and stay in place. Come in a nice but kind of big and awkward case. They look nice and are a good quality for the price!
4.0,"This is a very pretty bra and has many nice features, especially the wide padded straps. But, it fails to give much support. I was looking for a bra without an underwire and this looked so comfortable. I'm sure it would be great for ladies who are smaller chested."
4.0,"Fits as expected,comfortable, great summer dress"
4.0,love everything about this sunglasses.
4.0,The for just wasn't what I expected.
4.0,it is a nice everyday casual shirt
4.0,"I love this dress and for the price! Keep I. Mind it’s a true wrap dress so you might want to plan on pinning the bust and maybe at the leg so it does fly open. I will also wear a slip with it. I feel like in certain light you might be able to see thru a little. The print probably covers everything though. Super pretty, love it"
4.0,"It took about 3 months to get it, but its probably because shipping is backed up, still was very happy it finally arrived. It is too big to be a key chain, but it's a good collectible for a fan of  Game of thrones"
4.0,"I got size XL and it fits pretty good. (I'm 5'3"" 194lbs) I will have to sew the split in the back down a little, but I'm ok with that. It's not as see through as the comments were saying. Cute lil dress for a party bus I'm getting on this weekend"
4.0,Can't wait for my Grandson
4.0,"I wasn’t expecting this to be quite so heavy, when it said t-shirt dress, I assumed it would be light and thin, however this material is much more heavy and more stretchy than I was expecting. Not a bad or good thing, just different. I bought this for my baptism, and it will do the job - it’ll weight more wet, but it’ll do. If you’re looking for a nice, strong, stretchy material - this is the product for you. Don’t think I’ll be buying again, however. Also, I normally wear a 1x, and in this i got the xl because I read a review saying it runs a little big. Glad I ordered a size down."
4.0,The fit was great but the lime color was not at all what I expected
4.0,"I knew before buying these that I wasn't buying Wiley's. That being said, they ARE a great deal for the money. They do not seal well, and the frames are somewhat stiff, but the optics are clear-I coated them with a defogging agent also-and ride well up to 70mph so far. I like the security the goggles offer at speed, and the look of the glasses in town. Again, great deal for the money."
4.0,Chain is pretty copper color and seller said copper is treated to prevent color change. It is too soon for me to rate it as time will tell.
4.0,Got it for my 75 year old father he loved it. Will update if it fails and see how the costumer service has a 5 year warranty will test that
4.0,"Travel kit is nice. It was a little smaller than I expected, but certainly serves it's purpose."
4.0,I really like it! I liked it initially but finding it snags easily and balls up already. Not sure now if I'd recommend it.
4.0,My daughter loves it but it is big. She will wear it as pajamas and grow into it.
4.0,"The bracelet is stainless steel , doesn’t tarnish and what not . Only problem is the main charm has fallen off after a month ."
4.0,Seem ok. Not the most quality fabric but nice. Fit good and look cool. Love the amount of pockets I recommend them.
4.0,"I wore this dress for graduation, it was really cute and nice. I only wish that it had pockets."
4.0,"This is my fault.  I did not notice that the top would have buttons going all the way down the back.  I haven't even tried the top on yet, because when I saw the buttons I decided I would need to return it.  I looked back online and see the picture of the back with buttons.  It looks okay in the picture, so maybe I will go ahead and try it on.  the color is beautiful. (light apricot).  I have not tried it on but just by looking at it, it does look a little on the smaller side."
4.0,I am returning because I was hoping this print would be more subtle. The lighter color is more of a light tan-ish yellow than what the picture shows. As a big boober I struggled to get this to fit right on top. And it definitely shows your bra no matter what. I think ill go braless but because of that I'll have to get a size down because it fits a bit loose. Overall this is a very flattering cut and the quality certainly seems good so I'm going to try again with a different color and size.
4.0,"I was impressed with the quality of this jersey. I only gave it four stars because it does run small. I ordered one size up because I like my shirts baggy, but it fits, which is fine since I love the shirt.<br />I ordered a XL"
4.0,"Navy was not navy at all, more of a smoke blue. The garment fit and look was great. I have this dress from another amazon seller and the fabric on this one is not the same. I prefer the other fabric better but this one is still good. Perfect dress work work."
4.0,"Don't know if these are true Birkenstocks, even though they were mailed from Germany, but made in SPAIN?????"
4.0,don't stay up as well as I think they should
4.0,"Order two sizes up, and it's perfect:  I will probably need a black tank top or camisole underneath it though due to sheerness."
4.0,Nice top. Overall the fit was a little baggy so I returned.
4.0,We received the gray and white/pink shirts. They are reasonably priced shirts (about $15 for two shirts). They are thin and perfect for the fall weather in Chicago. My daughter is picky about the type of fabric she wears and she loves wearing these shirts. The sizing for these shirts are a bit confusing as a medium is a size 6.
4.0,This wrap is pretty! I’m 5’6” 130lbs and a small worked. Only thing is the tie part is confusing and there is a lining under the skirt that shows nervrhe slit. If you pin it it should be ok.
4.0,Liked it but like most cloth masks it became somewhat hard to breathe .
4.0,Was purchased as a gift. Fit recipient as expected.
4.0,"The color is right, not easy to find this color and quality is good too. Size medium if for men is little small, but still is fits right for me. I’m really like it."
4.0,Fits  my husband really nice
4.0,These are huge! Bought for a 6 year old but they’re way too big. I’m a women’s size 7.5 and these fit me better than the 6y/o. Otherwise the quality is fine and they look just like the picture.
4.0,The footbed could use a better padding so I would put in an insole however it fits exact. I wear a 9 1/2 I got a 10 but my toe is rubbing the very front. This the 4 stars I wish they had 10 1/2 that would have been perfect I wore them once but don’t kno what to do with them now. When I fitted them on in the house they felt comfortable so I decided to wear them out for my BD after a few minutes they became uncomfortable.  I love them though they are unusually unique.
4.0,I was not expecting a thick sock but I like the colors. Probably will save for cooler weather
4.0,"This ratcheting belt is terrific. It looks good and adjusts easily to my husband's weight loss (and occasional gains). His 36"" belt is frequently too loose and doesn't look so good on a different notch -- it's too worn -- but this belt is accommodating his current 35"" waist needs perfectly, and I've no doubt he'll be fine if he balloons to 37"".  The belt easily adjusts to whatever size is the right size on any given day.<br /><br />It's marked on the back for cutting and it's easy as long as you follow the directions.<br /><br />I'm knocking one star off, because if that belt it all-leather, I'll eat my hat. There's some leather involved, but I smell plastics, too."
4.0,This top is great for someone who doesn't have a potbelly--it fits exactly as picture--sort of a slim fit.
4.0,"I do wear many wool and heavy wraps in the winter. This pin is large enough and heavy enough to keep the thick fabrics anchored together well, and is very attractive and unusual. It is becoming a conversation piece. I like it a lot."
4.0,"Very thin material, nice for summer."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:9d08ce0b165da0c9997fb08c3d4003e6]] Eexelente espectacular
4.0,"I love how dark these sunglasses are, because I have a big problem with glare."
4.0,"Super cute, works well with the FitBit Flex2 - looks adorable on.  I do wish it would stay at the length however the chain does slide so I find myself adjusting it several times while out for the evening."
4.0,Cute dress. Material is thin though and shows imperfections and panty lines.
4.0,"Fits great...the quality of the fabric is good. The only problem I have is the length, it fits above your knees."
4.0,The fabric is definitely more synthetic but it fits really well and is cute and comfortable
4.0,"Love the bottoms so much! The color is great but the top is just weird. Not flattering for the girls, though the bottom is! Returning."
4.0,"Excellent light-weight and moisture wicking socks... sufficient padding int he ball and heal but very thin elsewhere.  At the time of purchase, the image listed a 3-pack but I only received one pair... Amazon refunded 2/3 of the price paid and has since fixed the error in the image as well."
4.0,I ordered the rise gold and these are cute earrings. The post seems a tad bit and I had to force them into my earring hole but they aren't uncomfortable.<br />My neck is on the shorter side and they have a good length.<br />The &#34;diamond pavé&#34; part isn't shiny or light reflecting but it's textured and looks cute.<br />These are a very great buy for the price.
4.0,"They're cute, smaller than expected but I like them alot. Haven't stopped wearing them. Would definitely recommend"
4.0,"I really love PattyBoutik sweaters, but this one does have one major flaw that I have to work around, the chest area is sheer. I'll have to find something to wear under the sweater, no matter what bra I try they are all easily seen. Otherwise the quality, and color are all excellent!"
4.0,The material tore the first time worn. It's comfy and exactly as pictured.
4.0,"This roomy shirt has my favorite thing -- roll-up sleeves. The look is great; flowy, with good stitching on the seams and buttons. I love the pleating, which gives it a dressier look than the average shirt. The color is very attractive.<br /><br />It washes and dries well and it dresses up or down to suit any occasion. It's terrific with jeans. The material itself looks good, but it's too thick for summer. It looks like silk, but polyester simply can't breathe like natural material. I will be putting the shirt away soon and look forward to getting it out again next fall."
4.0,Great quality of fabric just a little bit too small ❤️⚜️
4.0,Arrived 10 days earlier than expected. Such a cute outfit! I'm giving it 4 stars because A) I'll end up having to sew the bow on the headband on better and B) The pants are a little small on my daughter and I ordered 2 sizes up. Other than that super cute!
4.0,I like the shirts will buy again.
4.0,These pants are okay for running around the neighborhood to do errands but I prefer a more tapered fit and less stretch so I buy a more expensive jeans for dates.
4.0,"they run small, the quality is ok"
4.0,Great shirt for a Clementine cosplay
4.0,"Weird sizing, but if one reads the size categories, they're greaf."
4.0,Good but heavy
4.0,It isn't super flimsy nor does it have a weird chemically smell. It fits amazing and has several buttons to fit to many necks. I love it
4.0,its not the real Zaruba but its still just as good. The craftsmenship isnt the greatest the ring has alot of errors but its still alright.
4.0,"As expected, happy with purchase"
4.0,"I really loved this watch while it lasted. It is the ultimate ten dollar watch. It has the time, a timer, month/day, military time, alarm, and it's easy to read. My only complaint is that it only lasted to years and two months, but if that's the worst thing that happens to me on friday the 13th that's not too bad."
4.0,"They are great, however a little heavy"
4.0,"Very cute dress.  It is a little large on me, but I ordered up a size to be sure it fit.  It is long, to ankles.  It does come very wrinkled and I suppose after ironing it will be fine.  I would recommend this dress.  Fun for any casual occasion."
4.0,It was just as advertised. Works for me.
4.0,"These are fun pajama pants. I like the wide waistband, but it was a bit tighter than I expected, so check the measurements before ordering. The fabric isn't the softest. The pattern, however, is divine. I know these are &#34;men's,&#34; but they don't make nearly enough awesome Cap merch for ladies, so I make do. These are my second-favorite Avengers pajama pants!"
4.0,"I really liked most aspects of this.  It was comfortable and fit well.  The net was lightweight enough that it didn't effect your vision too badly but thick enough to protect you.  The spacing was perfect for the mesh webbing which really surprised me.  I normally don't like anything interfering with my FOV and wouldn't wear this is certain situations but camping or hiking in a wetland area this is necessary.  It has a drawstring to tighten the top part around your head and another draw string around the bottom of the webbing to assure the bugs don't fly under it.  It isn't the best stitching but it certainly will hold just fine.  The net folds right back up neatly in the top and is concealed well if you do it right.  My only real complaint is the cheap zipper on it.  They could've incorporated a much better zipper for not much more if any.<br /><br />It's a little lighter then most and depending on your style you'll either love or hate it for that.  It's 100% polyester which is good for a boonie style hat.  I am very happy with my new hat and will wear it proudly when the need arises.  This style hate is used by Militarizes around the world for a reason.  This was a great buy, everyone needs one of these eventually."
4.0,I ordered Chicago Bulls in red. Received white. The size is smaller than expected. I would definitely recommend ordering a size larger than what you normally would buy. The quality seems fine. Just disappointed in the color and size.
4.0,"It's nice, good for travel and I will enjoy wearing it.  Probably not any skin protection as sheer as it is, but great otherwise."
4.0,"Love the cooler overall however, the place mention of the plug in my car was a awkward and managed to break the first time I used it."
4.0,Nice wallet! Slow shipping.
4.0,I love my anklet; it is so pretty against my brown skin.  It matches a silver necklace I bought years ago to a tee.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the fastner.  The fastner is shaped like an 'S' instead of a regular clasp.  I worry it may unhook and I may lose it so I'm going to have to have a jeweler replace it with a clasp.
4.0,"I love the fit of this dress.  I was hoping for a little bit more of a fancier material but as it is, it is very comfortable. The material reminds me of downeast basics t-shirt material.  I'm 5'5'' and 155lbs.  Very top heavy (36DD) so I went with a XL.  I could have gotten away with a large but I ordered up worried it would be too small.  It fits fine.  One perk I wasn't expecting is that if I had to I could breastfeed in it!  Wish they had more colors as I would order another. 4 stars as the material is pretty plain."
4.0,"I was able to put 6 or 7 shirts in the large bag and with the compression, the bag was much smaller.  I was able to pack more clothes (I always over pack) using these bags.  I also kept the items in the bags and put into drawer."
4.0,Love this watch band. Pretty and comfy to wear. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is the colors are not as bright as pictured on amazon. It’s more of a grayish purple and the turquoise isn’t as bright either. But so a nice option for when I’m going out and don’t want to wear a sport type band.
4.0,"Too small on top (34D), too large on bottom. Hopefully it can be fix because I absolutely love how it looks. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I got SO many compliments when I wore this shrug. It's sheer and lightweight. It has an elasticized cuff on each sleeve, which I liked, and it makes a statement. Get one!"
4.0,Feel nice and comfortable.
4.0,Gorgeous dress. Only complaint is there was a small tear on the waist Sam. Easily fixable.
4.0,"It fits a little smaller than expended, but still adorable."
4.0,It is well made and fits well. The only complaint is that the stays on the sides poke me under the arm.  I don't think I'd buy another one because of the poking stays.
4.0,"The dress fits nicely but is short for someone who is 5 foot 9. If you're short, this dress will do nicely."
4.0,"Pros: Super comfortable and easy to walk in, I'm not good w any kind of heel but I can move like I'm in flats w these, the angle on the toe really helps. They are light weight. Decent quality for the price. They look pretty good unless you really inspect them close.<br />Cons: It appears the sole is hollow and I'm concerned it will collapse over time. The materials and construction are rather cheap (though fitting for the price) I don't see them holding up for years.<br />Overall I'm happy with them, they were just as they appeared and worth what I spent."
4.0,I wish it had half sizes.
4.0,Cute! The material is thin and my bra showed but that’s fixable. Kinda bummed boot covers weren’t included
4.0,"The item was pretty and nice quality but the fit was much smaller than expected.  I normally wear a US small or size 4, rarely a 6, and the size large did not fit.  The seller, however, was very responsive and easy to work with."
4.0,"This is a very cute, loose sweater. My only issue is that there is a seam that falls mid-bicep that has absolutely no stretch to it (I have larger arms). Luckily this fits a bit bigger and looser (I ordered a size up). It is very cute on though."
4.0,The outfit fit perfectly loved it!!!
4.0,"Love these - turkeys armed with weapons & revolting! Comfortable, fit as expected, looking forward to wearing them this holiday season."
4.0,too
4.0,"tiene un diseno bonito, pero para mantenerte caliente se tiene usar  un abrigo  o mas abajo de esta chamarra. asi que recomiendo pidan una talla mas grande para que  puedan usar un sueter abajo de esta chamarra"
4.0,"Just a tad small for a size 11 foot. But they work and didn't bind at all. If they shrink on me forget it, they will be too small."
4.0,Nicely made but I'll have to wear a bandana under it-it runs a bit big
4.0,"One horn was snapped off and lying in the bottom of the package. Also the bag it came in was open inside of the shipping package. I was really excited for this item, and it’s super broken.<br /><br />Update this item was replaced very quickly. The item arrived in one piece and not broken."
4.0,Like it. No prob.
4.0,"Got these for my kids to wear, they love silly socks. They are well made actually, and pretty comfy."
4.0,"Fits my sister who wears size 4P, doesn’t stretch much to fit women who wears bigger size- hard to put on and if you managed to wear it, it doesn’t stays up and hangs down on your crutch as you walk or keep moving."
4.0,"I was a little concerned, but this jumpsuit turned out to be a winner. I received a lot of compliments. The material is thin and so your selection of undergarments is important. I am 5’6 185lbs. I initially ordered a large, but I returned it and had to get an XL. I will order the black in this."
4.0,Love the style but stretches as the day goes on. I bought a small I wish they had a extra small.
4.0,"Dress is adorable but definitely shorter than expected. I'm 5'6&#34;, 144~ lbs and it fits but definitely mid thigh in length.  The dress is well made, not see through but fits snug."
4.0,I read the reviews so I ordered up 2 sizes and it was still a bit snug but I do like the quality of the material. I would recommend it for the price.
4.0,nice and comfortable belt
4.0,It took me a while to get used to the look of the silver dip under the hook.
4.0,Fit fine. Smaller drawstring would help. But it works for a hawaii night beach barefoot wedding! 😉
4.0,"Love the bag, but the strap broke in the first use."
4.0,"I really love this dress! My only complaint was that when I received it, it had a horrid smell. I can’t even describe what the dress smelled like but it looked a new so I went ahead and washed it to see if it fixed the problem. Once the dress was washed, it was perfect. I’m not sure if someone return this and kept it in a stuffy smelly place or something… But regardless of my weird experience, the dress has decent quality it fit well and came as expected from the description on the website."
4.0,"The sunglasses I received are nothing like the pictures.  Instead of the shiny silver frame and stems, these have black stems and dark gunmetal frame. Not at all what I expected. They're awesome, so I'm only  dropping one star."
4.0,Broke almost instantly but was a super easy fix and has been fine since.
4.0,I should have taken off my badge 🤣 I’m not usually a pink person but I love this color! It’s soft and has a cotton like lining. Kept me warm in my office. I will be purchasing more colors 💖
4.0,Exactly what I needed. Only downside is - as other reviewers mentioned - the length does slip a bit over time.
4.0,Reading the reviews were helpful because people were saying this is not a compression top. I would consider it a fitted top and it works for what I expected.
4.0,"The extra flexibility of the glasses are great.....maybe more suited for small to medium sized head, overall for the price it's outstanding"
4.0,"Love these pants, great for the week-end."
4.0,Convenient that they come in a 3 pack.  Perfect for my morning walks and workouts!
4.0,I like the fit. I ordered one size up after reading the reviews & it fits perfectly.
4.0,really cute  not sure what I will wear it with  but if not  cute Xmas gift.
4.0,returned the item
4.0,Very cute and comfortable. I just wish the fabric was a bit thicker and heartier. I’ve already had to re-sew the seam at the shoulder. But despite that I would buy again!
4.0,Great shirt!  Turquoise color is spot on.  Only comment is that I ordered two shirts both LARGE - one long sleeve the other short sleeve.  The long sleeve shirt is a bit larger; sleeves go down to my finger tips!
4.0,"The amber is beautiful. The necklace and earrings are comfortable. The bracelet has a habit of slipping through it's &#34;lock&#34;.<br /><br />There are several different types of amber. Not colors, types. I do not know what type of amber this is. For the price, I have no problem if this is imitation amber.<br /><br />Everything that I have bought through this company (a lot!) has been fine, and it's been great doing business with them."
4.0,"They are beautiful earrings, however the &#34;crackling&#34; stone effect did not turn out on the earrings I received unfortunately. I would buy more colors for a little less price though for sure."
4.0,My phone with a case on it will fit in it. It does the job.
4.0,"Bought this for my 3.5-year-old. He loves it, but the pin on the wristband broke after about a week. You can order replacements on amazon of course!"
4.0,Very good quality for the price does the job well
4.0,Color was a bit different but I like it
4.0,"The dress is very attractive, but THIN. There is an area around the chest/clavicles where the dress is reinforced, but it leaves a visible line (I’ve included a photo of this). Undergarments including bra lines show as well. You will need to go bare or full shapewear.<br /><br />I’m 5’3” and 140lbs. I wear a size 8 jeans and got a medium. It fits perfect."
4.0,have to wear it on the 4th snap
4.0,"pendent chain. thinner then on picture , but. its nice. quality made. nice  good. price wood. recommend  looks very. nice  satisfy"
4.0,"Great basic dress to add to your wardrobe. Cute, comfortable and simple. Would love to buy again. Fit is a bit generic but the stretchy fabric mitigates this issue. Would be great with bold accessories to prevent a boring look. Easy to wash and dry."
4.0,"I have an size XL that is black.  I’d say that this size is a little bigger than I was expecting.  The straps are adjustable which is nice.  The bottom is very wide but has more of a flowy effect when it is on. The fabric is soft and comfortable.  I had no issues with washing the shirt, though I should note that it is indicated to hang dry instead of putting it in the dryer.  I do feel that the color of the flowers is a little different than is shown in the photos.  In the photos the flowers appear to be a dark pink, but in real they look more orange."
4.0,Lot of reviews complain about the smell - I took it out of the bag and let it sit aside for a few days and the smell was gone.  It has a stretch to it but I have a pretty small waist and it can be almost too tight
4.0,I would’ve given this five stars if it zipped across the top!! That said it does have two zippered pockets. It’s a great in-between size!! Love it!
4.0,Returned did not fit properly. ordered next size larger.
4.0,Gold is tarnishing but still pretty
4.0,I give this 4star because I didn't expect the texture of the fabric.Other than that it I'd beautiful
4.0,"Like the bra for what it is, however I found the back closure on the 2 I bought are very &#34;abrasive&#34; to the skin..."
4.0,"For me the quality is good, but they run small."
4.0,"Wasn’t as big as Expected, but necklace was nice"
4.0,"I always hesitate when I order clothes online because you take a chance with an illfitting garment or you take the chance with it appearing contrary to the way it was advertised. Well, I was pleasantly surprised when this dress arrived.<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />1. Fit: I'm 5'1, weigh 150 lbs. and wear a size 38k bra so it's difficult for me to find a dress that flatters my shape all the while compensating for my bustier top. Well, I ordered an extra large in this dress and the fit was just right. The top fit without being too snug and the waist laid smoothly and is tailored in such a way that even a short waisted person like myself has a more defined torso. My only wish is that the waist was at least an 1/2 inch longer. The way the it is made now, I feel that it draws more attention to my chest area which I try very hard to minimize.<br /><br />2. Style: I absolutely adore the retro style of this dress. It puts me in mind of the 1930s era when women wore highwaisted dresses and skirts. Although I tend to lean toward straight lines the flare skirt in this dress is loose and flirty and  hits about 6 inches below my knee.<br /><br />3. Details: Little details such as the three teardrop cutouts - which are modest enough not to expose too much skin -  the zipper on the side instead of on the back,  the two middeep pockets and the thin belt makes this dress very appealing.<br /><br />4. Print: Polkadots are one of my favorite prints with paisley coming in second. The polkadots on this dress measure in  about 1 1/2 cm. in diameter so they're big enough to make a bold statement but not too big to be considered gaudy or distracting.<br /><br />5. Color: The color I chose was red and it's a very vibrant almost cherry red tone. It's not the shade of red I normaly choose for myself so I toned it down with a tan sweater, tan heels, and I turned the white belt over to the tan side and it really made a splash!<br /><br />6. Material:  I'm assuming that the dress is made of a polyester blend. There are no labels stating this nor washing and care instructions so I took a risk and washed it before my first wear (the material is soft and has a bit of a stretch to it so I washed it in a lingere bag just in case), hung it up to dry and then ironed it on the fabric blend setting. It turned out just fine! The fit was still the same prewash, the fabric remained soft and stretchy, and there was no visible damage to the garment.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with this dress. I do have a few suggestions: since the dress lacks a liner it would be a good idea to wear a half slip underneath. In addition, be careful if you have long nails the material snags easily and always wash on the gentle cycle in cold water and in a lingerie bag."
4.0,I love it. It will help when I having a job cant wait. And it fits perfect me perfect. Yea
4.0,It’s very nice but collects lint and is super stretchy.
4.0,"These fit fine, but seem very cheap."
4.0,"These bralettes are perfect for lounging around the house in. Some days I don't want to wear a push up bra with an underwire when I'm just sitting at home relaxing and these are great for keeping me comfortable and giving me a bit of support. I'm a 36C and ordered the large and they fit perfectly. I love the colors they came in and the lace is gorgeous. I can wear these with tank tops and they look super cute. I wouldn't wear these in public just because they don't give enough support and don't have much lining but for around the house they are perfect. You could definitely see nipples if you get cold in these! These have definitely become one of my favorite bras to wear on my days off. They are just so comfortable, lightweight, and cute. Perfect for summer. *discount received for testing and review*"
4.0,This is not a small charm it is fairly large and heavy but is very beautiful.
4.0,"I love the style and design of these!  Very cute to wear with a dress or skirt.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is by the material of the straps I don't think these would be comfortable if you had a lot of walking around to do, I think they would scratch up the feet and heel, but for dinner or a night out these are great!"
4.0,This is a pull slide style bracelet.  Where you can expand and then close to fit your wrist.  The materials are all pretty decent.  Gems that decorate the bird are secured nicely.  The bird sits pretty flat on your skin and isn’t a big issue but the beads that hold the adjustments do dangle and can get annoying at times. I found that waring this a bit loose and wrapping the ends into it  is more comfortable then To have the beads dangling far all day long.  Overall pretty subtle jewelry that is well made.
4.0,I was kind of between sizes.  36 across chest but wear 34C.  Maybe smidge small? If you are between sizes might consider sizing up.  I am still happy with purchase as I wear mostly sports bras to work.  This is a nice and light.  Not made for impact .
4.0,"Received order, very cute collection. They are supposed to be in pairs and one came in single and other in three. Only pin I’m very confused about is the one that says “Don we now our ugly sweaters” - don’t understand what that means."
4.0,These were fun little gifts that were used for Valentines for my 6 yr old.  Though parents might not appreciate the kids lighting and aiming at their face!
4.0,These are a little snug for the size
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised. Bought this as sort of a one time only piece of jewelry, but it is so super cute and looks great on that I've worn it several times. It is made well, priced good, and looks great."
4.0,"I didn't realize they were not jeans, but still like them alot. Love the color."
4.0,This was a well made hat. It definitely looked nice.
4.0,Bought this for days my leggings don't have a pocket. Fits my phone (galaxy s21 ultra with a case). If it's zipped up it looks pretty lumpy but it's not a big deal. A little pricey but does the job.
4.0,Beautiful item will fit plus size color is vibrant blue & gold as advertised shoulders are open.
4.0,"I am 5'7&#34; tall and 175lbs  yet the small was still too big and the area that should have been covering my breasts ended up under my breasts.  I have since ordered the XS although still somewhat too big.  These look like spandex however they are not the tight fitting, hugging feeling of spandex.  they have no fat control or smoothing at all.  If that is what you are looking for, keep looking."
4.0,It arrived very nicely in the package with bags I can't wait to give this to my bridesmaids.
4.0,Really good mask. The adjusters in the ear straps makes it very easy for my son to wear it comfortably at school. The only thing is the color of the picture is not as vibrant admit is in the picture. Looks a little faded already. But it's still good.
4.0,"These were nice and comfy but too short to be flattering on me.  I'm 5'6. For me they ended at my ankles. But how you want your pants to fit is very individual, so others may have no problem with the length."
4.0,I originally booked us to get the feel if I would like to get the Medusa pierced. In my case the magnet just slipped off my lip decided to try it on a location on my ear and it works perfectly fine magnets are strong
4.0,"This fit well and are comfortable, but have a distinctly cheap look to them - a little bit shiny, a little polyester-ish, and the wide hem cuff at the bottom has almost a homemade look to it"
4.0,Kid loves it..it's sturdy
4.0,The ring itself is great for the money. The stones have a nice shine to them. There may be some manufacturer defects like mine arrived with a small chip on bottom of band and the center stone is set on a slant but nothing noticeable from a distance. The major problem that I've been having with ordering rings online is none so far measure true to size. I ordered size 8 the bag it came in even said size 8 but it measures at 19mm which is a size 9. I would definitely recommend this item to others just keep in mind you get what you pay for so don't expect something amazing. But i think this is worth the price.
4.0,Super cute and ridiculously comfortable but the fabric is a little see-through when it's stretched so don't go for your most flamboyant underwear. I think it's pretty worth it for the price.
4.0,"As others have stated, these are thin and not ones you would want to wear alone. However, I always wear them under other tops so it doesn't bother me. I normally wear size small in camisoles and bought medium since others said they fit small. They're quite snug but not so much that they don't fit."
4.0,arrived on time!!! A little on the heavy side (but NOT bulky at all). The weight adds to the look and feel I was after. The glow in the dark feature is very-very subtle. Overall very happy with my new semi-formal/casual watch.
4.0,Very nice! But it needs a better string to hold it.
4.0,"These are cute! I love that they match my purse strap. I just wish they had a lever back. It’s getting into winter and with all the cost, hat and scarf changes plus hugs over the holidays I’m worried these will fall off."
4.0,"It was a bit pricey for the type of material that was used. Wish the zippers were both the same material and matched, the top zipper was gold and the bottom zipper was white. It looked nice on and true to size. I’m 5’1” and 99 lbs."
4.0,"I use in all of my casual shoes and sneakers.  I have an average width foot but toe end is a little too tapered for running shoes, doesn't fill out the toe box.  But, support is very good and have been very pleased with them.  I wash them by hand and hang over my laundry sink.  Were recommended by my Physical Therapist and have been wearing this style for 10 years.  Hard plastic sole with cushioning holds shape."
4.0,My daughter is 9 and she loves this bathing suit it fits her really well she has a small waist and it's not really loose or baggy on her at all the only downfall I would say is it gives wedgies Lol
4.0,"Great fabric; back is a little thin, but overall the color and pattern are great"
4.0,great item!! was just hoping there would be more pockets
4.0,This is huge so I took it and cut it into 6 smaller ones. Now I can just throw one in my car and my bag and carry a small one with me and polish when needed.
4.0,My asics are more comfortable.
4.0,Just fine. The waist band is a little tighter than the Baleaf shorts but still ok. Good size pockets. They handle well in the washer/dryer.
4.0,"They were not the exact glasses.<br />The glasses on the left is how they’re supposed to look, they glasses on the right are how they looked.<br />These are also a Little bigger than the ones I previously had. But, they’re still nice if you don’t care about it not being as shown on the picture."
4.0,They feel really soft and it isn't see through. They stretch pretty well.
4.0,"I ordered these gloves due to the pandemic.  I've worn them when I go for groceries and they definitely make me feel safer when pushing the shopping cart or grabbing items from the shelves.  They also work well for cooking.  The plastic is noisy, but it fully covers my hands.  They are easy to take off.  Overall, they serve the purpose."
4.0,I bought the same bra at Target for higher price. Hard to find comfortable simple cotton inexpensive bra for the hot weather and hot flashes!! Not real smooth look under tight fitting shirts though.
4.0,No reason to spend a lot on aviators especially if you are like me and every time you buy a nice pair you leave them somewhere.  These are actually surprisingly nice and the price cant be beat.
4.0,"These are really nice, I haven’t had them long.  I do wish they were slightly larger."
4.0,"Great lightweight packable jacket.  Love the length.  A little tight in the hip area, but fine for walking.  I would buy a size bigger if a larger person."
4.0,"Great shoe, my daughter loves them and so far they are holding up well. Only cons is they run a bit small and not so easy to slip on."
4.0,Love the look of these sunglasses very modern. Nice quality. The only issue I had is a have a small head these are big I put them on and they fall right off. My daughter put them on and they look great so I guess I will have to let her have them. They are very nice looking on.
4.0,This one worked better than the regular magnetic ones.. my wife's wrist are small and this stayed on her and adjust better
4.0,"I really like this skirt. The color is like a deep burgundy. It is so beautiful! I wore it to church last Sunday and a few of my friends complimented me and asked if they could feel it! LOL! It is so silky, I don’t blame them.<br />I have washed it in the gentle cycle a couple of times and it was fine, I even put in the dryer this last time. It takes a steam iron like a champ. Polyester is tough, no matter what else we say about it.<br /> It’s really gorgeous!<br />All that said, it does have a couple of flaws. I don’t know how much longer some of the seams will last because they were starting to go when the skirt arrived. That’s ok though, we will deal with that later. For the price, I don’t regret a thing! I would do it again!<br />I am 5’9”, 129 lbs, 36” around bust and I got the medium.<br />By the way, I’m 45 and I totally pulled this look off with a black fitted cardigan, so don’t think you’re too old for this skirt!"
4.0,"Cute, clear design.  Bit smaller than appears in the picture."
4.0,Sooo comfortable! I forget it’s on. Only reason I give it a 4 is because I wish it had a better color variety. I only wear<br />The silver. I would like black and maybe blue. Not pink and white. Just my personal preference.
4.0,Bought as a before wedding dress.
4.0,Like the shirt and the concept. Brand logo is a little too prominent.
4.0,"I really liked the blouse I received, except I ordered 3/4 length sleeves and received short sleeves!"
4.0,"Function and fit are perfect. The sheen and color of the strap is maybe a slight shade on the grey'er side and matte versus the black and shinier of the watch or the factory strap. It isn't that noticeable, but its there. Getting it on is a bit tricky if you don't have some small tools to pry but I imagine if you are ordering this you have the tools or confidence. Buy it with confidence. The money you spend and also getting an extra strap compared to the factory issued one is well worth it."
4.0,"Love these boots so far.  Soft,  fit well.  They do run big. I wear a 7.5 to an 8 in boots and had to order a 6.5 and even They r slightly roomy but with a nice pair of heavy sox will be just fine. I would say there is a whole size difference in size of boot stated and fit.  Have not worn for any length of time as of today."
4.0,Beautiful for the price.. would buy similar items
4.0,"I REALLY wish they had put an easier to see color ""WHITE""? on the tips of the hands so I could easily read the watch. I love the color of the watch."
4.0,"These are soft, flexible and do not restrict my texting. They are borderline small for me. I usually order xl, so if you have large hands they could be snug."
4.0,This was perfect for what I needed.<br />The clasp however seems loose.<br />Sometimes pops off the top of my glasses
4.0,"5'4&#34;, 155 lbs, and I like it a lot. I got a medium. Fits really well and a great length for flats. May be a little short for heels. The material is a little cheap and it's made in China :("
4.0,"Very cute shoes. Fit as expected, not uncomfortable. Wore them around the house for a half hour to get a feel for them. Finally the never-ending winter is over and I can wait to wear them out!"
4.0,It’s looking good
4.0,"Pretty thin material but I still love it! For $13.99, it’s a fair price. It has a wide/boxy fit to it. I’m 5’8, 155, size 32DD and 6 jeans. I ordered a medium. It fits a little loose but I like it that way. Haven’t washed it yet so not sure how it’ll do. I def wouldn’t dry this."
4.0,"Good color in stones, impressive for price point"
4.0,breaks easily but worth the money.......... worth itt no doubt one my favorite bracelets for my girl i got her
4.0,The band is super cute. It will fit a large wrist. I wanted the pink one but it came rose gold and the band is not clear. It fits with my screen protector. So 4 out of 5 stars for me!!
4.0,These are great for the price I payed. Now judging on the quality I give it a solid 4 stars! I only have two complaints.<br />1: the glasses are rather thin and I feel like they will break in no time<br />2: the gold detailing is more of a metallic plastic material instead of real metal<br />But other than that the glasses are great with a vintage kind of feel! Can't wait to wear them out!
4.0,Very nice - easpecially for the price!  I would definitely recommend this product.  Having it in additional colors would make it the perfect gift.
4.0,For the money it was a really nice necklace gave it to my daughter
4.0,This fits great and does not ride up. You sweat alot and it looks great under clothes. The only down side is that you itch like crazy after taking it off.
4.0,"I have only worn these once, but the quality seems solid. The fleece lining is glorious! About the sizing, ladies this is important...there isn't any give to these at all. Also, they make my hips look huge. That may be because I should have gotten a larger size, but I've gained some weight since ordering. They were fine around the waist, but you can see the pockets bugging out because they were too tight around my thighs. Here are my details to help you figure out what size you need. I weighed myself before putting them on. 101lbs. I'm around 5ft 4.5in. I'm shorter, but have long legs so they are a bit short on me. That's no big deal, though. I just wore them with boots.  I ordered am xs. Waistband is about 13in across so 25-26.<br /><br />A quick note, the size tag on the inside shows size M; however this is sizing for the makers/distributors. American sizing was printed on the packaging. And my order shows size XS. Also, for reference, I usually wear a size 1or 3. I would compare these to the smaller sizes you fine at H&M. I wear a 2 or 4 at H&M. The most important thing to remember is that there isn't any give in the fabric with the fleece lining.<br /><br />Buying clothes online is so difficult. I hope all of this is helpful!"
4.0,They fit well a little bulky in groin area but they help
4.0,The shirt is beautiful! The fabric is very soft.
4.0,These are great! They are lightweight which is helpful for long wearing.
4.0,"The shoes are very good quality. The lights are nice & bright & sensitive to touch.<br />I purchased these as a gift.<br />The only thing that’s disappointing is that they arrived in a beat up, torn shoebox which was not good for giving. I contacted the seller, but no response.<br />I just hope they change their packaging material to something with a buffer rather than the plastic bag they were delivered in.<br />Overall, very happy."
4.0,Just long enough in legs though somewhat large
4.0,"The color blue is a little different, but still pretty. Love the fit and feel, little thinner fabric, but great for the price!"
4.0,"Good quality, but color was bright yellow instead of gold."
4.0,"I don't use these for luggage, instead, I use them as straps to cinch down my hub style ice fishing house before putting it in its bag. The width of the strap was what I was looking for. I did break the strap retainer and re-feed the strap through the male part of buckle to suite my needs. The buckles have not broke yet, and I abuse them in cold weather."
4.0,It is super cute but very short.  I ordered a size up and its still a little short.  But super comfy and flowy!
4.0,"I'm 5'6 weigh 145 and chest is 32DD. After reading reviews, it was recommended that I purchase a medium. The medium fit me perfectly except in the chest region but I have to find a great push-up and plunge bra not the cheap I'm wearing in pics.  I gave it 4 stars because description said gold but it's a rose gold. I still love it."
4.0,"For earrings, lightweight is the way to go. They won’t stretch your earlobes. These may bend a little if you handle them roughly, but I like being able to adjust them because my piercings are uneven. The teardrop shape is flattering and the slight shimmer doesn’t distract, or fade into the background. A decent pair of earrings."
4.0,"Larger than I expected, but is well made and fits under the seat of an airplane."
4.0,"This is really a cute watch, It doesn't look cheesy at all, which was what I was worried about. But after a couple of days I have to reset the time, it had never kept the time for longer than a few days. So it either came with a bad battery or it is defective."
4.0,"Its cute , no where near as long as shown more of a flowy at your jean pockets an flowy up some. Hope that helps i still like it just greatly disappointed i can find the style i keep searching for , picture is very misleading!"
4.0,This dress is beautiful it fits true to size the only little setback I had why I didn’t give five stars is that the material is really then it’s not stretchy but it’s thin you definitely have to wear like a body slip
4.0,Great little dress for summer.  I got the pink and the green.  I really like that  it can be  dressed  up or down.  The quality was good for the price.
4.0,so far working very nicely.  Lets see how they hold up to international travel
4.0,"This still fits, but it is a little smaller than stated measurements and fits rather like a too-tight glove. It is very alluring and very appealing, but it is not fully structured or sewn properly such that the two overlaying sides of the front of the blouse actually shift around, moving and becoming misplaced, as you walk around. That's no good. This is great for a nice dinner together at home, impressing your beloved, but this is not a good option for out in the world. If it were looser, it would be even worse, because it would hang oddly. It actually has to be tight in order to stay somewhat in place, but if you have hips this thin moves and shifts and doesn't stay looking like the pictures. I'm giving it four stars for a dinner at home where it won't stay on too long, but this is more like a lingerie top, for making yourself sexy for an hour, not a top you can wear outside and have it stay put reliably. It simply moves to much as I walk. Good luck in your search."
4.0,Fits perfectly on the top but the bottom seems a little awkward. Not sure if it’s because of the pockets or if I need a bigger size. It was still a good value for the money and the fabric was nice.
4.0,Perfect fit for my son which is unusual especially ordering online. The tan colored hoodie came lighter than what shows in the picture. I was a little disappointed since I ordered to match a pair of sneakers for my son.
4.0,"I love these shirts.  They're flattering, and soft, and they wash up well.  I take off one star here because this particular shirt is advertised as ""coffee"" and the photo shows a lovely coffee with cream sort of colour.  However, this shirt is not that.  It is as grey as a Seattle sky in winter.  So if you're looking for a nice GREY tie dye, you'll like this one - I do.  But if you want the creamy coffee colour that's shown in the photos, be aware that it isn't what you will get.  Other than that, really nice shirt!"
4.0,"Beautiful color, very versatile, water resistant, easy to clean. Inside pocket is a bit too deep to be practical for quick access, otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
4.0,Adorable shoes for the beginning walker!
4.0,Nice ring and well made. It's bigger than I thought.
4.0,Love the shirt.  Ran a little bit small - not too much.  My friend normally wears L/XL and this 2X fit her perfectly.  Nice quality.
4.0,Look at the picture to see the designs before you buy.  The shirts are basic t-shirts in a good fabric.
4.0,fits really well. and an excellent price.
4.0,They  more beautiful  on personal . I bought this for my wedding day.  But once o was gonna put them on the stuck part that u put thru ur ear bend then it broke. The home on the stud was to small. That is why u gave it 4 stars.<br />But not sure if I broke it cause I was nervous  n running late to my own wedding. Lol.. however the next day I fixed it with crazy clue and they r in my wedding box. But the r beautiful n not heavy at all
4.0,The draw string is a little too long and thick compared to the more expensive and fashionable versions of joggers. That would be the only give away that these are a cheaper knockoff version. Otherwise they are great and super comfortable.
4.0,"I needed a pair for driving when it’s cold. These are great for that. They’re thin and wouldn’t provide much help if I were outside for long but for being in a fairly sheltered environment they’re fine. They’re really soft and while I wouldn’t say they’re glamorous , they are attractive. I’ve not tried using a phone while wearing them so I can’t address that.  Overall a nice casual pair of gloves."
4.0,"Cute Christmas shirt. Sizes run big. Wish I'd gotten a Small,not a Medium."
4.0,Made the top of foot hurt!
4.0,It's pretty...very flowy though so I recommend a size down if you don't have a very big chest...otherwise the top<br />may be a bit snug...either way I liked it
4.0,"I like it come with band adjuster, lovely watch."
4.0,nice purchase
4.0,"True to size, almost wrinkle free, walking hem good idea"
4.0,shoes are great. The only reason for four stars is they do run significantly smaller. I wear a size 12 and every other brand of sneakers and this size 12 is a bit snug.  I have to wear super thin socks with it and even at that I really had to go through quite a long break in process before they fit reasonably well.
4.0,Make sure your golds match your gold. Runs kinda small
4.0,"The sunglasses look great, I received numerous compliments, this is my third pair you have to keep an eye out on the screws they tend to come loose and fall off."
4.0,"Although the sizes are way off and it didnt fit even buying two sizes up from my regular size, the company gave me a refund of my order no problem and I didnt have to go through the hassle or returning the item.. I really appreciated that."
4.0,Great quality for the price. Very happy with the product!
4.0,"This jacket is so cute! I am 5'2"" and ordered a medium. I hits at a perfect length. I naturally have long arms, the sleeves hit right above the wrist bone. This coat is not thick or bulky, easy to wear layers under. I typically prefer my sleeves a little longer, but they are not bothersome to the point of needing to return. It has a classy look and has a rich color. It is lightweight and warm perfect for cold windy winters."
4.0,Bought this ring as a work ring. I am a size 5 but from some reviews people mentioned I should go up a size. It was too big. But a beautiful color! Returning for a size 5.
4.0,"I do love this shirt!  I am a slow runner, and have decided to Embrace my Pace.  I have worn it twice, and have gotten giggles both times.  I did wash before wearing and did not notice any shrinkage.  4 stars because the design on the front is stiff, like an old time iron-on.  I am hoping that the design lasts and does not start cracking. Overall I am pleased, and  I would buy from this company again.<br />EDIT: Edited to add that it is now Nov 2022, and this shirt is still as good as new, including the design."
4.0,Too tight and I ordered from the size chart. Does not look at all like the picture.
4.0,Warm and comfortable! Our family loved wearing them on Christmas Eve!. All have pockets but only men’s sizes have a hood.
4.0,Earrings work with a Silpada necklace that I have but not nearly quality. You get what you pay for.
4.0,"I like the wood - it's a nice artsy touch. I do wish they made a version without reflective lenses, though. Also, they do have a slight orange tint."
4.0,love this key chain. I've getting so many complaints on it.
4.0,Shirt is a little stiff but a few washings helped.  Disappointed in the PRIME shipping.  Took 4 days to receive (not sure what happened and who was at fault) but it wasn't received for the purpose it was ordered for.  Not the first time this has happened and starting to wonder if prime is worth it.
4.0,My mom loves it....Yay! Nice n plush.
4.0,Mistakenly thought these were readers. They're really nice if you just want to be stylish. Lol
4.0,"Works great, just what i was looking for to time my dives, the one thing i am not really happy with is that the screen is not that bright. Apart from that all good !"
4.0,"These are very attractive bracers but be aware that they may have a strong musty smell that takes a while to dissipate. It is nice to have the laces on both sides that lets you really adjust the fit and you can wear them with the more pointed end over the back of your hands or facing up your forearms. The seller was very responsive to my concerns about the smell and readily replaced them. And the smell at long last has settled down. So you can feel comfortable that if you have any problems, they will take care of it.  And if you can wait a while for them to air out, you will have a nice set of bracers."
4.0,"Love this watch band! I have very small wrists and it's difficult to find watch bands. My watch is the Casio lineage lcw-m100tse-1aer, which has a 39.5mm diameter and 43.9mm lug to lug measurement. This watch band fit perfectly on my small wrist on the last punch-out. The double loops keep the excess band in place without issue. Installation was a breeze. I spent more time taking the lugs off my original band compared to the time it took to install this band.<br /><br />I'm docking 1 star because I'm not convinced this is genuine leather as described. It feels very plastic-y and was very stiff upon delivery. The hardware on the band is solid though. The metal buckle is secure, as are the lugs.  I will update the review as I continue to wear the band."
4.0,"This is a nice product for the price, but it's not accurate to describe it as being adjustable for both girls and adults.  At the longest length, it only halfway covers my ears.  I'm a female adult with a smallish head, so by the description I thought it would fit me okay. I've even tried wearing it across the back of my head, but it keeps slipping off.  I'm giving four stars because it's basically a good product, but it should only be described as sized for kids or possibly teens. These fit my nine-year old niece so I gave them to her."
4.0,"Cheap hat, get better hat, not bad otherwise"
4.0,Like it. Was as expected.
4.0,"Loved this dress. Bought it in a medium.<br /><br />Falls just below my knee, so length is appropriate. Wish the top material was a bit heaver though. When holding it in hands, seemed like the bottom part heavier."
4.0,"I like the hoodie. It's super comfortable and very soft.<br /><br />With that said, I am 5'6"" and pretty thin and the hoodie for new pretty big for a medium in my opinion.<br /><br />I attached a picture (with my cat who seems to love laying on the hoodie). As you can see, it is not the same as advertised. The hoodie I got is missing the white on the shoulders. This is not a big deal for me but it should still be noted that it does not look as advertised.<br /><br />I would have given it 3 stars if it weren't so comfy."
4.0,Very NICE
4.0,I fit perfectly ina size 8 and the size 8 I got from here was too small so I will return it and get the next size up 8.5
4.0,This is a nice belt.  It fits well and is nice that you can wear it with a lot of different things.  Looks great with jeans.  I like that there are many holes since I fluctuate with my weight at times and so this can be worn through thick or thin.
4.0,This bracelet was delivered on time this was a gift for my granddaughter she loved it !!!
4.0,"Definitely worth it over the economy shirt on hot summer days, though the materials are still not the same quality as an authentic soccer jersey."
4.0,My husband seemed to really like it and it looks good on him.
4.0,Okay for Driving!
4.0,"Fits well. A little long for me (5’3”). Main issue is that the white is see through, so sent back."
4.0,Mine were slow slightly to large for size 12
4.0,Perfect. Look very them and the case makes it th look very high end.
4.0,Good i like it great look and quality
4.0,Bought this for my son. He absolutely loves it!! Soft with a hoodie and pockets. Best robe he’s ever had.
4.0,"Beautiful watch, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's a bit bigger than I expected. Other than that it's lovely and shipped a lot quicker than expected."
4.0,EXcelente regalo!
4.0,This was brought for my grandson.color nice fit excellent would purchase again.
4.0,Nice but too small for my wrists. I had to give it to my 8 year old. Wish they came in different sizes.
4.0,Love this dress! Got great compliments.....Went  back to order other colors & they were completely sold out!
4.0,Product works well as described. Straps are somewhat uncomfortable as the material was thicker and rougher on my shoulders. Wish there was a way to not have the zipper be noticeable under clothing.
4.0,"I do like these sandalwood prayer beads. Upfront I have to say I have a problem with the picture the seller has up because it actually shows four or five of the different colors that you can get instead of the one. It would have been ok if she had separated the strand a little because it is somewhat misleading. The  beads do not looks like sandalwood. I am not saying they are not because I do take the sellers word for it but they seem to be treated  but there is no wood smell either. The length of this necklace is 20 inches and this can be used as a bracelet or a necklace. The beads are strung on elastic. There is an extra 4 inches on the bottom of the necklace with some nice handmade beads. I do have a problem with the very tiny jade bead. If I did not know better it look very close to a swastika. To me this is very insulting since my mother was shot in the back by the German's in world war 2, I hope the seller will change this in newer models.  The color of the beads is very rich. The elastic this is beaded with is pretty thick so it looks that this bracelet/ necklace will hold up very good,<br />I received this product at a discount/free for my honest/unbiased opinion. I read reviews before I buy a product online especially on Amazon. I hope this review will help you decide if this is a product for you. I would recommend this to my friends and family. This is my own honest opinion. If I change my opinion with more use overtime I will update my review. [...]"
4.0,"This dress is super cute but does run big. Nice travel piece, cute with sandles or sneakers."
4.0,"Needed for a school event, fit as expected although my daughter is slender for her size. The chorus used them for a performance and honestly all the styles were quite nice on all the girls, no matter shape or size. Just look at the cut for your body shape. I would buy again for a short term use, or once in a while...not certain how it holds up to extended, repeated use and wash."
4.0,the leotard after a few wears pulled from the skirt.
4.0,"I use this for my Samsung Note 5.  I have a fairly thin case on the phone.  Anything larger & the phone will not fit.  A plus for this bag is there is a compartment for carrying things i.e. credit card, comb, a mirror and a see through compartment."
4.0,"They were nice, but I ordered the wrong ones.  Sent them back"
4.0,Good quality. Lettering smears some when rubbed-even the using a sharpie
4.0,These are cute. But I would suggest you get your own backings. The ones the provide you with are cheap plastic. I lost one due to this.
4.0,Love the dress but it runs really small as the reviews advised. I’m wearing a 3X in the photo.
4.0,They are cute has 2 back pockets they are not denim. The are cotton leggings. They are soft. fits kinda big. I wear a size 16-18 . When I put them on my butt looks nice but the front was long in the crotch so they looked kinda saggy.
4.0,Came in packed nicely. Price right and looks nice.
4.0,"Looks good nice and durable, though, somewhat too high.<br /><br />Received discounted in exchange of sharing my opinion on this product."
4.0,It is a well made swim suit
4.0,This clutch is a good product and holds a lot of your money and anything else you need to put in there.
4.0,"its slightly big in the bust, but fits great everywhere else."
4.0,The product is fine there was much to talk about how small the gloves are. So instead of going with small I went with medium small would’ve fit my wife’s hands perfect.  Your size chart is not correct.
4.0,"I am very pleased but I agree it has a bit of a gold hue to it. I was pretty disappointed that it was delivered to the wrong address, I had to go hunt it down and I'm disabled which makes getting out difficult as well as very painful. I have prime so it arrived the next day. It's very thin, light and smaller than I thought it would be but it is still very pretty. Overall I am very pleased with the ring, I do hope it looks more silver than gold after a good polishing."
4.0,"Bought these for my boyfriend and me (and some friends) so that we can match at a music festival. Arrived nicely packaged. They fit everyone but me perfectly. I have a small head and they are slightly loose. They'll be ok, but I'll probably be pushing them up throughout the day."
4.0,"These seemed like nice slides, cute and comfortable, IF they had fit. I normally wear size 9.5, ordered a 9, and sent them back because they were a tad too big and an 8 would have been too small. The size wasn't a huge problem until they got wet in the shower, but then my foot slipped out too easily. I wanted them to use in campground or hotel bathrooms, but the slipping is unacceptable. It's nice that Amazon makes most items easy to return."
4.0,"It fits really true to size, only complaint I had was that someone said it ran small.  It doesn't.  It is a nice summer dress"
4.0,"Cozy. Well made. Thought there would be a little more fabric, but I still really like it."
4.0,"I loved the outfit, but it ran smaller than the size."
4.0,"Purchased for my 7 year old. Hat doesn’t fit him, but he loves the apron. Still a win, just wish the hat was bigger."
4.0,The ring is great and looks exactly like the picture when you get it! Although after a little while the rose gold starts to get rubbed off rather quickly and starts looking silver
4.0,One of my favorite summer dresses.  When it arrived the strap was broken once I repaired it all was great.  It's a little see through.
4.0,Awesome denim vest but it was to small for me.
4.0,Cute inexpensive set for my junior bridesmaids.
4.0,"Individually wrapped, 3 identical masks, 1 layer for light protection, perfect for outdoors at Disney."
4.0,I would have liked straps because the bodice was super loose and not supportive.  The wrap around skirt was a bit odd and probably would work better on someone tall.  I’m 5’4.  However for the price it was great for a poison ivy costume.
4.0,"Kids love wearing them, and they can actually do stuff on the playground with them."
4.0,"La textura del sweater es buena calidad, warm y ligero, no se hace flojo con las lavadas y lo que más me gusta es que no hace frizz en tu cuerpo."
4.0,perfect value & perfect fit
4.0,Work well on both mine and my wife's glasses...
4.0,Fun dress!  I love the material and the fit.
4.0,Thin material but comfortable
4.0,The fit and finish on this product work well. It met or exceeded my expectations. The problem was getting it to fit. I could not find a jeweler who would adjust it to fit and finally had to buy a tool to cut it to size myself. Having done that it worked beautifully. All you need is a friend or relative with a small electric hand tool with a saw blade. I have found a few other uses for the tool since I purchased it.
4.0,The star is sharp and stabs the wrist
4.0,"I like the shape, and they are very light weight.  I also like the tack on glade shield."
4.0,Just like the picture. Get it I got an xl n it fits perfectly and I’m 252lbs n 5’6
4.0,I love this ear cuff. Ive bought some from claires but this one is my fav. Its not a bright silver as the picture shows. But it is so cute.
4.0,This hat is well made but the brim flops down and blocks vision.
4.0,Cute workout leggings for a low cost!
4.0,These earrings are cute and they haven’t faded or itch my earlobe.
4.0,Fit and color good
4.0,They were too small but functional
4.0,fits good and its light weight
4.0,It was just what I wanted to buy. It fits good and looks good on my wrist.
4.0,Super cute good quality! Although it is hard to tie and it doesn’t stay tied very long.
4.0,Pretty dress and it shipped fast. Happy with the purchase. Thanks!
4.0,"A really good deal, they look great and can be worn without any sensitivity or coloring issues. I've gotten many compliments. My only issue and the reason I didn't give five stars was that they seem a little fragile, although I've not experienced a problem with fragility, it is just a perception."
4.0,It feels better as on a carpet indoors shoe.
4.0,"This romper dress is amazing! Its looks exactly like the picture and the material feels durable and genuine. I followed the other reviews and got a size up which wasn't a good choice. I'm 5 ft 2&#34; (128lbs) and got a medium. It was big and I had to get it tailored. Also, if I had followed the size chart I would've gotten a large so follow your true original size based on the other clothes u have. I believe a small would've fit me well. The tail of the dress is really long but it looked great with my 6&#34; pumps. Will upload a pic as soon as I wear it out. It's a great addition to anyone's closet."
4.0,Looks nice many compliments
4.0,"wish i hadn't listened to the reviews , ordered too big so it's not as flattering as i would have hoped..."
4.0,"FOR THE PRICE YOU CAN NOT BEAT IT. MORE THAN FINE FOR AROUND THE HOUSE, A LITTLE FLIMSY FOR GARDENING ETC..."
4.0,It's a cute hat for a lady.  Since it doesn't support any one team or anything you can pretty much wear it anywhere.
4.0,I love these slippers! They do have a “popping” sound when you walk but worth it for the cuteness and comfort.
4.0,Good quality and adorable.
4.0,buen producto y buen precio
4.0,"Very pretty,would order again.Lovely piece of jewelry."
4.0,I am a registered nurse and work 12 hour shifts. I wore the compression socks and it made a big difference. My legs are not as tired and don’t ache like usual. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because they are a little thin and I’m afraid they will rip. So far so good!
4.0,These are some nice pants.
4.0,"This is as expected...well made. The eyes holes take a little getting used to, and of course your head gets warm after a few minutes, but try it, it's fun!"
4.0,"This was very cute and I was pleasantly surprised to find it had snaps on the bottom. The size I got fit me, but the problem with this item is that it doesn’t have the boning to be laced up the back properly. So when you try to tighten it, instead of it pulling the sides close together equally, it pulls at only the points that the ribbon runs through. This makes it so that you can’t really close it without it giving weird gaps and looking ill fitting. You can keep it looser though for sort of an open back situation, however this results in the chest being looser. Still a good deal, but be warned if any of those issues are a problem for you."
4.0,Well their the color of brass. But color is peeling. Also brass baby balls would be more like it. Lol. But. I like them. Ya don’t want real size nuts hanging on your keys anyway. Lol
4.0,"Blouse is shorter than it appears in the picture.  It does not hit mid-hip, but at the waist."
4.0,Perfect size for  my bony wrist. Love the nylon band and satin nickel finish. The green indigo accents on the face are a nice touch. Only problem is the glass scratches easily.
4.0,Got great for the size I ordered and soft
4.0,"I am so comfortable wearing  this sunglasses, unbreakable. Thanks Amazon.<br />Muhammad N"
4.0,"Purchased two lengths to vary look when strung with large jade bead. Fit loop on bead perfectly. Fast shipment,."
4.0,"Brought it for my son, (size 18-20) fits good.  Would buy again."
4.0,"I ordered a few of these unusual items as gifts for my piano students. They look nice, but 2 of them have a slight flaw in the &#34;keys&#34; part."
4.0,very nice. use it everyday
4.0,"Listen, as a fairy godmother I am always on the hunt for a fabulous new dress. Now call me naive or whatever you will but this dress is so large on me I do NOT look like a fairytale. I look fairly like a whale. It’s not cute people. This sucker was huge on me. I am not a stick that makes big things look cute. I am chubby and I make big things look gargantuan. This was not flattering in the least. My heart is sad because I wanted to love it."
4.0,"Quick little Valentine pick-up for my earthy-girl. Adjustable, about the quality I would expect for the price. Daughter likes it, so it's a winner."
4.0,"This is a very soft top. Slightly thin, so I may have to wear something like a camisole under it. I wear a size 14 in tops, or an XL. I ordered this in the 3XL, which says it is for a size 14. Unfortunately it pulls a bit across my stomach, I was hoping it would be a little looser. However, it doesn't feel like it is pulling across my tummy. It is not uncomfortable, which is surprising. Normally when shirts look like that on me, I am also uncomfortable. I definitely think it will look better on me as I start to lose weight. The color is very pretty and true to the picture. The crochet lace is not at all scratchy.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"This is a very nice basic bra.  I'm a 34 B and I do NOT want padding, I like my breasts just the way they are and find padding to be uncomfortable and misleading.  This bra also doesn't have any underwire yet it does offer support, but don't expect it to be a push up bra.  It follows the natural lines of your breasts. It is very light and lacy, I'd actually like it in another color if possible.  As you can see from my picture, it has a solid hook in the back, that's adjustable - which is great if you gain/lose weight.  I'm not sure how well this would do for a woman with larger breasts.  Another nice thing about it is it came with a very pretty box that I'm now using to put some letters in.  Overall, it is a good bra for the price and good quality as well."
4.0,"I'm 5'4"" and got the medium which fits very well. The length in the black color is perfect, above my ankles. I got a blue one in the same size and it goes to the floor making me trip. I had to tie it up to be able to go for a walk and that's not really ideal. Why different colors would have different lengths I don't know, then again it's cheap and there's no quality control."
4.0,These seem really great. You can tell they are plastic by feel but do look like glass. Have to see how they hold up in the dishwasher.
4.0,I really like this dress. Very flowy and comfortable. I did have to readjust the the button snap so that my cleavage wasn’t quite so abundant. But I like how you can adjust the tightness. I bought a large.
4.0,"Bought this for my mother n law, she loves it."
4.0,"This is my second order of toe socks. They arrived early which is always a plus but as with the last ones I ordered the pinkie toe is always a little too long so toe slips out. I find that they are reasonably priced, wear comfortably  and will last a good while, if taken care of but I do have a tendency to walk outside a few yards to mailbox w/o shoes and just the socks😉. Other than the pinkie being too long and I wish they had a royal blue color, I recommend these to my friends for sure."
4.0,"I absolutely love these! I took off one star because it can be challenging to find and open the hinge to take them off once you have put them on. On the other hand, this could be considered a fantastic benefit because they clearly will not open up and fall out unintentionally. They're very comfortable to wear all day and all night. Perfect for sensitive ears and people with allergies to metals."
4.0,Están bonitos los colores.
4.0,"I REALLY like these sox! So very cute and feminine! They are a little snug and you have to be careful putting them on. You'll be okay unless you have very big feet or long toenails. In either case I wouldn't suggest these sox, as they are not stretchy but do have a little &#34;give&#34; to them. They look so adorable with my retro circle skirt, and two-tone mary janes! I bought two sets of these just in case at some point they become unavailable. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
4.0,Lovely color and style. The sleeves were way too long though.
4.0,I love the feel and color of these shirts they fit me but are a little smaller/tighter than i had expected.
4.0,It's super shinny material kinda looks like pleather pant material haha but it's cute with leggings it's warm too
4.0,Besides running on the large side…. My daughter loves them and they are cute shoes.
4.0,"What can I say... my DH loves these bras!! Probably not the most supportive bra I've ever worn.  The wires go through the fabric after awhile, glad they're not expensive!!"
4.0,"These won't give you night vision but they do cut down on glare, the green makes things appear more intense/bright. I use them when I walk the dog, in the summer they keep the bugs out of my eyes at night so I can focus on watching out for skunks. In the winter they keep the snow out of my eyes."
4.0,"Look, it's a nice little hat for a beerfest. But the feathers are a quarter of the size pictured. Not too big of a deal breaker to add your own, or leave without. But it needs a new picture."
4.0,"Cute dress, very tight up on the boob area like some other reviewer have stated and doesnt fit right. If I would have gone a size up it would have been too big on me."
4.0,"I was looking for a body shaper that had a thigh shaper as well as other i found are not really good material. This one has a very comfortable material that actually is able to breathe throughout the day without getting all sweaty like other shapers. The good thing with this product as well is it has a butt lifter in it to raise your curl up, giving you a juicer booty. I wore this under a dress you should even tell that i was wearing a shaper underneath. It doesn't have any lines showing or any tightness where you can see under clothing. The bottom where it comes to my knees wasn't actually tight but lose, I'm not sure if that's how it was suppose to be like that but i found it much better as when its tights i get rolls showing where it hugs onto the skin but since it was lose it was more freeing and able to move throughout the night. It has cut out holes where your butts goes as i mention it earlier but for me it was the only thing i didn't really like. I have a larger butt than most people so my butt didn't fit all that well in the holes and looked funny where some of my butt would stick out. It probably could stretch but didn't want to damage it. I purchased a 5x i am a 247 pound person and it did fit me good. I recommend to those wanting a shaper that feels comfortably and is unnoticeable under clothing. I received this product as a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,Cutest little hamsa grate for kids.
4.0,It's a nice pocket watch. Wish it came with a pocket chain instead of a necklace.
4.0,"Deceivingly attractive...... especially for the price. Very pleasantly surprised @ how good this pendant looks. I realize the sapphires are dark, but for the $ it was a shrewd and well received pc of jewelry. My wife wears it often and she can be picky about her jewelry! Well worth what I paid and am completely satisfied."
4.0,This necklace was much smaller than I anticipated but it is beautiful nonetheless. The metal is good quality and it lays nicely. Love the design and the packaging with the quote was a nice touch and would make an excellent and thoughtful gift
4.0,"I was dismayed that my normal size did not fit me in this jacket. The arm length was great and the quality was there but it was tight in the shoulders and arms and would not zip around my torso. I'm 5'5&#34;, 140 lbs, and wear a 2XL (18-20) in most brands."
4.0,"This poncho kept me nice and dry in the rain.  I like the print, the hood is generously sized, it is light-weight and seems like it will hold up well.  It is long enough on me to cover my rear when sitting down, but I'm only 5'1.""  Frequently I wear a poncho in a boat, and if the seat is already wet, back length is important.  The front is plenty long to cover everything."
4.0,"Nice joggers, but they run short. Typically, a size large’s inseam is fine for me. Not these."
4.0,"I love the dress, it was just a little too loose around the waist."
4.0,Love this shirt. From the picture I was expecting a waffle fabric but this is more of a soft poly-Cotten.still cute and very comfortable.
4.0,"Great for Chucks, not for Sperry's.<br />A little too much fabric on the top for Sperry's so the sock is too visible around the top to be worn with boat shoes.<br />Since Chucks go higher up on my foot they are more comfortable than my last pair of no-show socks that worked better with Sperry's."
4.0,"The feeling is standard t-shirt material and the stitching holds together well. It is not super loose fitting but it's not form tight either so it's a good in-between. not too tight across the chest either<br />my height is 5'2"" and it is the right length for me to wear to work"
4.0,"I love them! They were too long for me (I'm 5'5&#34;) so I cut about 2&#34; off and made a small hem. The shape of the legs is fine, and I use the cut-off pieces for a casual little scarf to hold the outfit together if I am being casual. Would give 5 stars but the &#34;waistband&#34; is over-large and the crotch just a bit high for my tastes. But they look and feel lovely to wear."
4.0,"Ring is beautiful. My hands aren’t but with a ring guard it fits nice. As a young woman I wore a lot of jewelry, but arthritis put an end to wearing rings. This one at least makes me feel like I used to even if my hands aren’t what they used to be."
4.0,Had knee surgery on one knee and arthritis in the other.  These sandals have helped stop about 80% of the pain.  I am wearing them through the entire summer.
4.0,I love these socks! They are sung and warm and don't make my feet sweat. =]
4.0,Absolutely LOVE this dress.  Can’t to wait to wear it.  Perfect fit.
4.0,Other than it being a little smaller than expected.  It is a great looking shirt.
4.0,It's a cap
4.0,"A bit smaller than I expected. I thought the width at the bottom would be larger. It's more the size of a briefcase. But it makes a very cool briefcase!  It IS Laurel Burch, after all."
4.0,"The plugs are beautiful! However, they do not match...One is more transparent, and the other is whiter..."
4.0,"work great, just not scratch resistant."
4.0,It's not small but it's very tight around the neck and makes it hard to pull over your head.
4.0,Soft fabric.  Nice fit without being too snug.  Great color options.
4.0,Love the ring. It's very dainty. I have the other all diamond stackable and I wish the stone size matched better. It doesn't look like the exact ring just with purple and diamonds. The all diamond has smaller stones.
4.0,"Sturdy, solid bag.  Love the zippered section and small pocket inside.  Holds a laptop (not a padded section) or iPad.  Two eyeglass/cell phone pockets.  The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the strap drop (length of straps) is a little too short for me.  For a petite person, it'd probably be fine, but I'm 6 feet tall. Otherwise - it's a great tote/bag."
4.0,I like the twisted pearls look. The pearl quality is good.<br />But it could have some extension ring near closure
4.0,I really like the material of this dress it’s super light weight nice quality! It’s a little lighter red then expected. I am 5’4 123 and a 32b It’s the perfect length but the top is a little too big for a small dress I wish there was an option I think it would have fit me better.
4.0,"I really liked it. bigger than i thought but great if you want to carry more stuff. i gave it 4 stars because i am a bit worried about the material is very thin, hoping this purse will last for awhile."
4.0,"Kids liked them, but destroyed them very quickly."
4.0,"Nice fit stays in place keeps moisture in doesn’t over dry beard. Worth trying, great for bedtime conditionings and keeping beard clean"
4.0,Cute. Gore here fast
4.0,better than jerking hearing aids off with mask
4.0,Great look! Protects glasses as expected.
4.0,I like to wear them over leggings.
4.0,I haven't wore them yet only poses with them but they look okay
4.0,Really like the materials.
4.0,"The feeling is so smooth, lovely material very cool ."
4.0,"I took off a star for one simple reason; the turtleneck portion has SO much extra fabric, its huge! I don’t know any human who has a neck that large…. I tried to like double-fold it but it didn’t look right. If it wasn't for that I would get this in another color but because of the turtleneck I wouldn’t buy it again. Otherwise it fit nice and was comfortable, I just can’t get past the turtleneck."
4.0,Fit was ok. Filter makes breathing a little difficult
4.0,"Love these. very comfy, a bit larger than comparable products of same size."
4.0,Can’t wait for my girls to give it to my mom for Mother’s Day!
4.0,I use this as loungewear around the house. It runs really large! The fabric is nice and the caftan is comfortable. I ordered a small on a friend’s recommendation even though I usually wear a large or extra large. Glad I didn’t go bigger!
4.0,Very good purchase.
4.0,"They arrived pretty quickly, so yay for that part! So far, I've had no issues with them besides the fact that they are pretty heavy. Also, a piece of advice, if you only wear normal ear rings, these may be a pain to put in."
4.0,"I love this hat and have worn it many times since buying. Great stitching, great shape that holds up well. My one gripe is the bill length though -- just a bit too long."
4.0,"This dress is pretty shapeless on it's own, but I use a belt to cinch in the waist and it's super cute. I first ordered the white, which was too sheer. The navy dress was not sheer. The colors are vivid and did not bleed when I washed it. I would not recommend drying the dress, however, as it shrunk a lot.  Either order a little bigger, or don't dry it."
4.0,"This is a pretty ring and stands out. It's sterling silver so I can wear it on a daily basis ( have had it on my finger for 1.5 months now) which is good as I generally get allergies with artificial stuff. Since I wear it daily, the colour has faded from golden to silver but I don't mind as it still looks lovely and not bad for the price at all!!"
4.0,Kept this one
4.0,"It is a great backpack with lots of space. I just used it on vacation and had to carry stuff in it everyday, like change of clothes for my kids and so on. Was easy to fit many things in it and also simple to keep everything organised. Good value for money also in my view.<br /><br />I just wish the laptop pocket had a separate zip so that at airports it was easy to take the laptop out during security checks."
4.0,They are slippers and have held up so far. Super cute
4.0,"I've only had the watch a couple of days, but I like it.  This style is very shiny which isn't necessary bad, but you have to view it at the correct angle or use the illumination function.  I would buy the same model again, but not with the aluminum base, it's just too shiny."
4.0,"This bag is above average. Lots of room to fit multiple items. It can fit all of your toiltries without any issues. I just hope two things were different. The hook is somewhat small. If it was larger, it would give better hanging options. The other thing an average tooth brush is somewhat too long for the sis pocket. It fits but has to be somewhat tilted.<br />The outside and inside materials are man made but looks very durable. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,"The earrings are very pretty and larger than I thought. However, they are also heavy and the backing is not strong enough to keep earrings on."
4.0,"I wear these while working as a RN. Fit is great, color is pretty too. They can be put through the washing machine which is key for my use of the shoes. Comfortable, but could use a little more memory foam"
4.0,I like it! Fits as expected and will be buying other colors
4.0,"The white flowers were a little see through, which I didn't expect from a dress that had a black background. Runs small. I'm usually between a 6 and an 8 and ordered the medium - it fits like a 6. (Medium is usually equal to 8-10)<br />Great length for work, I'm almost 5'8"" and it hits at the knee. Overall, I like it but I'm considering swapping it for a larger size just to have some breathing room. I don't love it but I don't hate it - decent enough option for work for the price."
4.0,The shoes are decent for the price. They have a very chemically smell to them that took at least a few weeks to go away.
4.0,"I will need to get a clip for the back.  I have a small chest and a loose dress like this isn't flattering, a clip will tighten the fabric in needed areas.  Material is very soft and not too thin or thick, sleeves are not too tight.  Great casual dress.  Nice rich color.  If you don't have at least a B cup or higher, it may need modification if you don't want to look like you are wearing a tent."
4.0,"These sunglasses come with 4 different lenses that are easy to change out and a plastic frame to fit your prescription glasses into. The lenses flip up and reveal the prescription glass or you can just flip them up instead of taking the glasses off your face. The comfort is 4 stars, after wearing them for a long time they start to get a little uncomfortable but overall they are pretty good. The case is very durable and high quality, it’s just a little big, so I don’t carry it around much."
4.0,"I don't write reviews but I had SUCH a hard time shopping for these because of the lack of reviews I thought I would try to help. The ones that had reviews were basically - ""SO sparkly and pretty, LOVE it!"". Not helpful to me as I wasn't going for hoarkin peice of glitter but a reasonably believable diamond substitute.<br /><br />I ordered 3 rings (photo top to bottom) 1. DovEggs 1.5ct equiv center, 2. This N/H ZBJGEMS Platinum Plated 925 Sterling Silver Engagement Ring  and 3. San Moissan double halo ring. They ranged in price from $69 - $150 all 925 sterling.<br /><br />1. Won hands down over all, the offset cushion cut. The setting was lovely and the cut and color of the center stone was definitely the best, for a moissanite if that's what you're looking for. BUT these manufacturers are so stuck on these large center stones and to me, they're just not believable as a realistic size. I mean, I don't know about you but, I'm not trying to pass off that I spent 8 grand on a diamond even if I am driving around in an Audi. Besides, with the color of a moissanite, no one is going to buy that story anyway. But is it lovely if you're announcing that you're bucking DeBeers and the entire diamond industry to everyone? ABSOLUTELY. I just wish there were more options in the .75 - 1ct centers for me. I may have stuck with this type of ring.<br /><br />2. This one supposed to be moissanite, fairly certain it's CZ. This one I actually almost kept. Funny enough. For the money, you can't beat it. It's a great cut, the color is WAY closer to a real diamond and from a distance, especially because of the smaller center stone, it's believable. Based on this experience, if you're trying to pass off a diamond, smaller, quality CZ like this with halos and pave is definitely the way to go. In the end I just didn't like this shape on my hand which is why I didn't keep it for my - I'm afraid of hurting my real ring - spare.<br /><br />3. San Moissan MilGrain Band. Really nice, believable setting and at first glace, the one people liked the best. But the center stone does not appear to be cut as nicely as the DovEggs one. Much more ""glassy"" looking at certain angles which I assume is light leak in the cut, but I'm no pro. And fyi, if you're looking for a more believable size, this states 1.05ct center - that's a moissanite carat which works out to be about 1.5 diamond weight. 1ct diamond rounds are around 6mm. You wouldn't think that .5mm would make that much difference in giving it a ""Home Shopping Network / QVC"" look but, it does. I mean if that's your thing, go for it. But that's not what I was looking for. With a stone similar to #1, this would have been a tougher decision.<br /><br />In the end, I went real, 1ct diamond - estate jewelry, making it more affordable. I'm an adult, with houses to pay for, cars to build and dogs to feed. It's a second marriage so I'm not going bonkers this time around. BUT in the end, it's just not a diamond. I know they're not investments, apparently they're just what I like. My advice is, for an anti diamond statement - go for it. Any of these 3 you would think were lovely. If you're trying to look ""diamond enough"" look up your local estate jeweler or reputable pawn. Pawn shops aren't what they used to be and many guarantee their jewelry, provide sizing, polishing, plating, etc. Do your homework, haggle, and you'll be shocked to see how fast that $4500 1ct ring ring turns into a $1500-$2000 one. Personally that's my way of sticking it to the jewelry industry!"
4.0,really cute and inexpensive belt. fits true to size
4.0,The fit looked nice but the sleeves were uncomfortably tight for my average size 7-year-old. Ended up cutting at the seams in the under arm so she could wear it more comfortably.
4.0,The guy I bought the hat for loves it. It's just a generic trucker hat and that's what he wanted. I had the name of our organization printed on it and the quality wasn't too bad either. It should last for a while.
4.0,"Stylish & edgy! These are my go-to sunglasses.  The only semi-downfall is that the weirdly shaped metal on the side makes it easy for your hair to get stuck and it really hurts pulling it out. These are the ONLY sunglasses I won't wear on the top of my head. If they make a design change for this issue, then this product would be a solid 5 stars."
4.0,"THe quality of the fabric is not the best, but Im realize how cheap was? That is Ok, and that what should you get. i wore yesterday and and my friends told me look good. Dont expect wear many times.. I am 5,7 (1,70cm) 150 Pounds, It does not fit like the picture, I do not know if because Im much taller then the model. But it's just a blouse."
4.0,Everything is good except the bands stretch out fairly quickly.
4.0,Nice feel - great for the price!
4.0,So far I like this product to organize my purse backpack
4.0,"Item was very nice. The length of the dress was excellent, but the width is a little wide compared to the length. Otherwise, all is very good."
4.0,Works for my costume
4.0,Tried it on it fit perfect hopefully it still fits in July for the wedding I'm wearing it too. Guess I better lay off the hot fudge sundaes.
4.0,"The ball on top is a little bigger than I had hoped, but otherwise it's pretty! I like that its shorter, but I could actually use an even shorter one if that exists."
4.0,"These glasses are of decent quality and seem to be well polarized. I have never owned polarized lenses, so I cannot compare their quality to another polarized pair. However, I am happy that they are a step above other cheap sunglasses I have purchased. I am not convinced that they are perfect, though: I still notice some glares that I expected to be reduced."
4.0,I thought these were going to be way too small but they stretch like mad.
4.0,Fit great. Material a little thin.
4.0,"I like the coat.  It fits nicely and has a good hood.  The zipper is a little tricky at first but is loosening up as I use it more.  The material is fine, not wonderful but very good for the money.  Good buy."
4.0,I love this but I wanted a black eye you sent me a dark blue eye
4.0,This is a very nice bag.  It is hard to find nice ones that are not made from leather.
4.0,Good quality shipping took awhile tho
4.0,"Normally I would take a medium, in this I take a small for sure.<br />It is cheap material, looks slightly faded rather than a dark black. I plan to re-dye it.  The neckline is a bit loose on me but the shoulders and cutouts fit nicely It is a bit more snug and fitted through the bodice then I would prefer, but it's still acceptable..  I am 5'1"" and 117 pounds.  I wear a size 34-36 C bra but have no cleavage due to having had breast cancer.  It would fit better if I had cleavage, but it is still ok."
4.0,"It was a bit more red in color than the burgundy I thought I was getting, but its still a super cute beanie. Only issue is the pom-pom is about to fall off and I've only had it for a week. It's a quick fix but it's not something I should have to worry about after only one weeks wear. Other than that, It's a really warm and cute hat."
4.0,"The red is much more of a bright red than what is pictured with that said I still like this shirt because the material is flowy and feels good against the skin. Also, I followed their size chart and it is quite large on me. Luckily, this shirt looks nice flowy and can be fitted by a waist belt if you so choose to wear one with it. The material is a bit see through. Not terribly see through but if someone looked hard enough they could probably figure out the color of your bra. Which was counterproductive for me because I wanted to wear this to work and because it's kind of see through it would be unprofessional in a medical building. I don't mind it for a night out with the girls or out on a date but not for work. All in all, it is a nice shirt that could be dressed up or down with dress pants or a with some jeans. It could be a very versatile piece for the closet. Also, my picture of the shirt is a little misleading as well. The red is bright but not quite as bright as in my picture. In real life it is more of a cross between what they show it as and what my picture has it as. Hope that helps. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Surprisingly nice! I was worried it was going to look cheap and flimsy but it isn't. Only reason I gave it a 4 is because the writing is a little faint and I have a feeling once worn a few times the lettering will start to fade. Will update once I've broken it in.
4.0,"I am no expert on rings, but the Zirconia looks kinda flat.  Are these things supposed to look like diamonds?  It is good quality though.  Didn't know what the ""Promise ring"" stood for, so there was some rather awkward explanations when giving it to my gf.  worth $20"
4.0,"For the price, these boots are amazing. I do see what other people are saying, they do slip down as you walk.. which can be annoying. But at the same time, I didn't want boots that were super tight on my legs and calves (as most of these boots seem to be) ... So it's worth tugging them up everyone once in awhile, to make sure I get the comfort I had been searching for in these boots."
4.0,Ok if you like really large earrings.  Like 3 inches long.
4.0,great for travel essentials like boarding passes and passports
4.0,My 7 year old loves these shoes!  Maybe because he doesn't have to tie them.  And they are super light weight.  They are his &#34;go to&#34; shoe!
4.0,Color is good but I received item with cosmetic damage.
4.0,"Cute cages for cheap! I got these for an activity at my sister's birthday party and they were very popular! Great variety, build is sturdy. Other sets I've gotten from Amazon dont close all the way, these have the opposite issue. Some cages are hard to open enough to fit the pearl/bead in, and we had to use a butter knife to pop them open. However, not enough of a hassle to deter from getting again in the future!"
4.0,This shawl topped off my mother of the bride dress.  I used it at our daughter's wedding and it was just the right amount of<br />warmth and style for the wedding.
4.0,Good material. Little short in the body for me.
4.0,Very comfy and soft. I sized up but would still not be able to wear over a long sleeve shirt. Works fine for a cami or short sleeve shirt. Love the pattern.
4.0,I was disappointed by how loose it was at the thigh
4.0,"Bought a US XL based on reviews here (I usually wear a fitted M), would purchase again as a US L next time. Shipping takes quite a while but overall cool shirt."
4.0,It is very nice. I got the same product that is there in picture.
4.0,"The material is pretty cheap and stiff, but it's really easy to reshape to make it fit onto your head. I have dark brown hair so the redness of the flowers didn't really show up that well for me. Pretty cute though"
4.0,I do love my watch this watch was made with care thank you<br />L'Serena
4.0,It's difficult to find pajama shorts.  These were perfect and it matches almost any t-shirt.  Very comfy and not constricting.  Lounge wear for sure.  You could almost get away wearing them like shorts.
4.0,"Liked product, just a little disappointed for a &#34;one size&#34; fits all garment that it ran so small."
4.0,Fits good quality is well
4.0,its for a gift so I dont know how it wears
4.0,Great fabric and stitching. Seems shorter than in the picture. Has more of a shirt-like fit than a kimono or coverup. But still a really pretty piece.
4.0,Wore them in a parade as Mr. Potatoe Head.  Quite satisfactory waving function.
4.0,I wear a size 36 waist. The XXL fit perfect. XL would have been to small
4.0,Well constructed and sturdy. Better than I had expected. If only it were water proof. I highly recommend it.
4.0,"Super cute!  Sons of compliments.  Big so I could layer.  Really liked it a lot but it is a mens size shirt. Often I can get unisex smalls to fit me okay, especially after a wash but this is quite a full body fit.<br /><br />In defense of the shirt I am on the small side even for me due to heath issues and not busty either."
4.0,My daughter is tiny.. she's 7 but wears a 4/5. I bought two sizes smaller for her and it made a super cute tunic! Anything bigger wouldn't have worked. If you find the right size for your little one it's a perfect addition to her wardrobe! It does run wayyyy too big like the other reviews have said.
4.0,It would have been nice to include the rubber silicone inserts inside just in case they needed help to stay in place. Otherwise it was ok.
4.0,"It is difficult to find all cotton shirts to wear over leggings, so happy to have found these.  I wish manufacturers would increase the standard length on extra long by an inch or two as these are borderline.  I have to buy shirts that are a little baggy if I want them to be long enough.  The cut of these shirts is a bit boxy as seems to be cut at same width from underarm to hem, which doesn’t help The result is a gap under the arms which is why I rated down.  I still bought multiple of this shirt as colors and fabric are very nice, and at least they offer in an extra long even if the standard for extra long isn’t long enough."
4.0,They are pretty but there was nothing to indicate that they were stretch belts but I will wear them but it makes your dresses less fancy look than you are going for.
4.0,"This watch is very similar to my dad's old Timex that he gave me recently, but sadly, it died beyond repair. So...he bought me this one. I love the color. The face lights up a bright blue in the dark, making it super easy to read. It was very simple to set the time and date and even use the alarm. The band is also easily adjustable. The only thing I can complain about is that the first watch he ordered me arrived with a broken clasp, but I had no trouble exchanging it for another. :) I think it's well worth the price."
4.0,"The fabric is pretty cheap and feels spongy in a way. Even though, this is super comfortable and awesome to wear"
4.0,"Cute, inexpensive glasses"
4.0,"These are inexpensive hiking shoes and although they work for hiking, they show their inexpensive side with how hard they are on the inside, too (comfort-wise).  These are for my husband but I bought slightly more expensive shoes for myself and they are more comfortable from the get-go.<br /><br />Traction is great and they're tough shoes, but you do get what you pay for.  If you have more sensitive feet, you may want to pay for more expensive shoes."
4.0,bought as a gift - had to buy a chain but the dragon is cool
4.0,"From to to calf, Everything about this sock is great! The only part i don't like is the 'neck' of the sock is soooooo tight that I had to cut it, and even after that it's still super tight. And no, my legs are not huge😆"
4.0,"These earrings are really pretty. They are a little shorter than I thought, but still very nice. The stones are glittery, but not gaudy."
4.0,"Terrific value, comfortable to wear, minor negative wrinkle's easily."
4.0,"This is exactly what I expected.  It's big, a little on the heavy side, but excellent quality.  I wish the backing anchors were clips rather than press fits, but the press backers seem to be decently secure.  It hasn't fallen off."
4.0,"Fits as expected but thinner than desired.  Wish for something to hide, hold or cover breasts."
4.0,"I like to wear this shirt to school. The colors and fabric are just as listed in the description. The buttons are nicely spaced. It's comfortable, not itchy, and the corduroy is soft to the touch. I rated this a 4 out of 5 because I had expected the corduroy fabric to be a little warmer and softer on the lining. Great for slightly cooler temps."
4.0,The dress fit great. The material is very soft. I'm a 12-14 and got the xxl it's only a little big. The only reason I returned this dress was I found one that I liked the fit better
4.0,These shorts fit nice. The fabric is exactly  what I wanted. The only thing I don't like is the waist band. The waist band curls with use and it makes wearing these shorts uncomfortable.
4.0,Great quality but the shirt has a smell to it. A smelly smell that smells smelly.
4.0,I like this top very much. Sexy and comfortable. Nice fabric too and I love the design on the shoulders. Highlight recommended. I wish It had in black too I would buy it.
4.0,i like the cotton texture of the product but everytime you wash them they seem to get smaller.
4.0,"Very pretty, I got a lot of compliments. The metal that hooks each side together was malleable and does not stay in the right shape to hold the belts sometimes."
4.0,Did not like it as it is. I sewed up the front to make a shirt. Lovely.
4.0,It is for a gift but seems very good quality at a great price.
4.0,"I was hoping for completely black steel, but the tip is still silver. Minor nitpick."
4.0,"Beautiful earrings but much smaller than pictured.  Advertised as being for women, the size is more<br />for infant."
4.0,Top is thin so if you have others around you might need a tank under it.
4.0,"I love that you can order two completely different styles for a great price. One for my work desk and one for my nightstand. They are sturdy and protect well, so much better than laying my glasses on my desk. These immediately caught the attention of two coworkers who quickly ordered their own. The only negative is a lingering chemical smell from the materials used."
4.0,It’s really cute but...the middle piece (the middle petal) of the big rose broke off.(i have no idea where it went)
4.0,Very sexy dress..I received the osfa and it fit great a little loose in the middle but overall a great buy!!
4.0,moms loves them very fashionable
4.0,"Cozy and warm but the hat could fit a little better, very loose."
4.0,"I think this sweater has a cute slim fit design. Shorter in front (near crotch) than in back and the back falls well below my bum. Nice coverage and true to size. The bat wing arms are not huge and are more like a larger upper sleeve than a true batwing, which I don't really care for. This bat wing design is more favorable look for my height and size of 5' 3"" 150 lbs and full-figured hourglass, 34DD. It is very soft to the touch and washed up well on delicate cycle and a damp dry dryer cycle with final lay flat to dry the rest of the way. The apricot shading is true to the picture as well.<br /><br />The reason for the removal of a star is due to the little strap that runs across the base of my neck as part of the design. It's cute but really doesn't sit where it shows in the picture and is basically a pointless feature of the sweater. The seam stitching was a tad crooked, but the quality of the garment is quite good. Feels like a high-end item.  The V neck is nice and hits perfectly on both sides of the sweater. Overall, it is a cute sweater and goes well with jeans or leggings. If you want a baggier look, definitely size up."
4.0,"This is an adorable sweater.  It's knit and the weave almost feels plushy.  Long sleeve, knit cuffs and crew neck.  In a plaid pattern, it has a lovely look but it seems am bit pricey."
4.0,"Excellet...rode 68 miles, comfortably."
4.0,A NEW APPROACH TO SPORTSWEAR.  OK
4.0,Nice high rise leggings at a affordable price.
4.0,"looks a little overdone. For more exclusive party,yes,but for everyday use it is for me to feminine. Quite okay and looks genuine."
4.0,"Very pleased with the fit, support, and comfort. Some unoboob, but I have had worse. Would buy again and very good price."
4.0,"I like it very much.  My iPhone 6s+ fits in there very nicely, which was my reason for choosing this one, although the wristlet was another reason.  I’m not convinced it is real leather, which is the reason for the four instead of five, but they claim it is.  Does anyone know if it is?"
4.0,Comfortable and a great price.
4.0,Love it ;-))
4.0,"The lights in these slippers work very well.  I can finally get to the bathroom at night without tripping on the way, or fumbling in the dark for my flashlight.  The sensor turns the lights off in bright light as described - so no problems there.  The fabric top is soft and pliable, the sole is pretty rigid so I wouldn't recommend them for lounging in or wearing on stairs but for late night sojourns to the bathroom they're pretty much ideal."
4.0,I needed something last minute for annoutdoor party and this was perfect.
4.0,"The t-shirt itself is pretty low quality. Printing is ok, but not great."
4.0,Was a gift. She liked it
4.0,"Half of my keys slipped off of my regular carabiner, and I misplaced them in my car for a few days. I was looking for something more secure.  This worked well."
4.0,Amazing shorts love the material they fit perfectly big fan of the zipper pocket for surfing
4.0,Love the dress but it runs REALLY small!!!
4.0,Wish the torso was longer but seems to be great quality so far.
4.0,"It’s a lot short than the pictures, the printing isnt the best but the quality of the t shirt material is really good! the delivery was also late."
4.0,Great quality.  But the size runs smaller than I expected
4.0,"These are fun, and it's not the first time purchasing them. But, the print is ridiculously small and we get complaints all the time about it. Works well though"
4.0,Love the style and color. Definitely needed a bigger size than recommended. Bought a Large
4.0,nice fitting shirt of my favorite band
4.0,Beautiful but large was a bit big for my liking. Made a great gift!
4.0,Nice shirt fits as expected
4.0,The only reason I did not give this five stars is because it is too small for my neck.  I just prefer something longer but for someone with a normal size neck (lol) it would be great.  The packaging was nice and the quality seems really great for the price.  It is beautiful.  I will be giving it as a gift.
4.0,Ordered for a 2T shrunk to fit a 12 month.
4.0,One star removed because the belt was useless. I do like the dress and will wear it with a different belt. The material is stretchy and the fit is pretty good if you go off of the recommendations. I found it to be a tiny bit large but it isn't enough to send it back.
4.0,"2 weeks is too early to give a fair review.<br /><br />I will say that my eyes feel less strained when I wear these sunglassess.<br />That is what I wanted from the Eagle Eye glasses, so that part is very good.<br /><br />Time will tell whether the clip-ons will last 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years.<br /><br />The lenses are a little smaller than the lenses on my glasses, but that<br />does not affect my field of vision.<br /><br />Mr. 'G'<br />Shenandoah Valley, Virginia"
4.0,Even XL is a little slim around the butt an thighs. Squatters be ware!
4.0,Great watch...it fits perfectly and works great. Although it doesn't really bother me much but my boyfriend thinks the ticking sound is unusually loud and annoying.
4.0,These are great for hot humid weather. The quality was disappointing.
4.0,"I like the midi length look, but I thought this dress was a little to plain looking. 5’5” 130lbs and wearing a small"
4.0,These are exactly what I needed! They really do keep my arms warm! They sometimes have a hard time of staying up but that is because I move around a lot while I'm working. However they are easy to put on and are not too tight!
4.0,Was as described. Inside lining is soft and we'll made
4.0,Great costume and accessories for the price! My ten year old daughter normally wears an adult small in clothing but I ordered this in a medium and it fits perfectly. The zipper on the jacket keeps snagging but overall good quality costume for the price.
4.0,I have some necklaces with various stones that I couldn't use liquid silver polish on.  This worked great as I could work carefully around the stones and take my time without worrying about making a mess.
4.0,"The outfit fits fine, good material and pretty comfortable. But the design just doesn't fit my style. Not a bad product!"
4.0,"The hat is a good hat but size was wrong, could have be me or could have been them which doesn't matter."
4.0,Love this jacket. It’s light weight but still protects from cold wind. The only reason I didn’t rate 5 stars is it came fairly wrinkled and wrinkles easy when you wash it. It just needs special care but is worth it!
4.0,A gift for granddaughter and she was pleased with it...
4.0,"Ordered these jackets for a production of the Wedding Singer & they look great-- the blue is a nice bright royal blue.<br />I will say the sizing is Asian sizing. The US size conversion is pretty accurate and true-to-size. Tho when in doubt, go bigger. One of the jackets fit lead actor perfectly, but another actor who wore the other one found it super tight in the shoulders.<br />Overall great jacket for the price! You can't find jackets in bright colors anymore, so I was happy to find these!"
4.0,"I ordered ans extra large, and followed the size chart for the bust measurements because I am blessed in my bust to waist ratio, I have to order larger, 38 DD bust and 24 waist so the XL was good around my bust but to big for my waist, which I expected, very pretty on, elegant even."
4.0,Nice material but the fit is to loose.
4.0,good quality  size run just a little small
4.0,I like these. The buttons are a freaking nightmare to use so only 4 stars.
4.0,"The fabric is cool to touch and it actually feels nice. I got the pink print padded. So the pads are little tiny circular pads. I don't know it kinda felt uncomfortable to wear, but had some other ones to see if that made a difference and it actually did. I normally wear a 34A and the small was too small for me. I should had taken my athletic built up top to account, but I didn't so that could be the reason it felt small. I'm actually going to return this and get the medium. I think the back is really cute and the color vibrant. I am looking forward to wearing this to the gym."
4.0,Cute shirt but ran small.  I normally wear a M but need to send this back for a L.  Kind of stiff but maybe that'll change once its washed.
4.0,Gave as a gift to my son
4.0,"I love everything, but they are very wide. Better as a beach bag than a grocery bag."
4.0,"Did a overall good job, some spots hard to clean"
4.0,Its a cute top. I bought a medium and it fits like a medium. The length is also good. No complaints.
4.0,Great baseball mask for Halloween!
4.0,Fit fine HOWEVER it came to me with a hole at the seam so pay attention. Otherwise it is nice
4.0,"It's ok! Don't like how it's made, but it's for my M&M collection"
4.0,Happy ez
4.0,Very comfortable I just wish they were a little longer.
4.0,"We purchased these with rather low expectations and were pleasently surprised.  We had 20 kids coming to the party and purchsed 3 packages (40 units/pack).<br /><br />We had a bowl of them near the dance floor and with the lights dimmed and the disco ball going, the kids loved them.  Each light has a little elastic strap which fits around the finger. Perfect for kids, a little snug for an adult. At the party the kids put 1-4 of them on each hand and dance away, waving their hands to create fun light effects.<br /><br />Only about 1 in 20 were defective, which I think is an acceptable rate given how cheap they are. I'd consider these as a disposible, single use toy.  If they work longer great, but don't count on it."
4.0,Well made fits a little tight
4.0,"These are thicker than they look. I do use them to workout in but only in late fall, winter months"
4.0,They are for xmas but they were exactly what I was looking for
4.0,"I really love these earrings. They are very unique, but a little heavy. I can't wear them all day, only a few hours at a time. I've been wearing supporting backs on them, that helps some."
4.0,"Didn't notice a tremendous change depth of tint in varying brightness, good sunglasses though"
4.0,Value and variety are good. Different sizes of items. Good for various uses.
4.0,Earrings came quickly and were as pictured. I like the colors and shapes. The backs that came with the earrings didn’t fit snuggly enough and I lost one somewhere in the first day of wearing a pair of the hoops. The other sets with the rounded wire tops are a little weak and I fear they may flex with time and wear. Still cute and a great value though!
4.0,Love it & will wear it proudly .
4.0,Its a cute shirt. Comfy but a bit large.
4.0,Sunglasses fit to adults. For the price paid was good. The only thing I did not like was that glasses did not have UV protection.
4.0,"These pants are adorable but if you’re looking for a classic “fold-over” or comfy waist, this is not it. There is a super tight elastic strip at the very top that detracts from the comfort and “looseness” as they were described. That being said, they do look really good and I still wear them higher up on my waist as regular pants instead of lounge pants."
4.0,It was little bit small but the material was great and the zipper added a very nice touch to the leggings.
4.0,love it but returned my medium for a large<br />up a size
4.0,Runs small I'm 110lbs and my belly shows I love the material it's like cotton.
4.0,It's a very nice wearing glove. I bought the black ones and used them as a part of a costume and they fit very nicely.
4.0,Very cute! Just a little too bag
4.0,It shrinks! So be careful
4.0,"it serves its' purpose. I am not used to this bra style as I'm new to exercising, but I love it."
4.0,"These are cute, although hollow in back, which was disappointing at first, but actually was not an issue as the pendant didn't flip around easily, so the ugly side wasn't really exposed. For the price, I can't complain. After a few wears, the cord broke on one, also disappointing, but easy enough to put the charm on a different cord. Overall happy."
4.0,it was a gift for my mothere and she loves it.
4.0,This chain was bought as a gift it Looks real nice chain would buy again if they had bigger chain lengths. The price was perfect. Ships from china
4.0,It's not as long as would've hoped it to be but it looks beautiful.
4.0,"It is a very nice top, but it is very see-through  and it wasn't as low cut as I'd like."
4.0,looks good and it fits my 2 and a half year old grandson very well.  Nice case.  Only reason I am not giving it five stars is it is too soon to judge durability.
4.0,runs alittle big
4.0,I've been looking for mult-tier necklaces for awhile. This 5 pack was on sale around Cyber Monday so I picked them up. They are definitely cheap metal but you can't tell from a normal distance. I'm happy
4.0,I wasn't expecting much but when I got it i thought it was pretty cool and I haven't taken it off since! ;)
4.0,"I love the way it fits on my wrist I just don’t like how easy it is to get dirty, but overall worth it!"
4.0,These earrings are very pretty and sparkly
4.0,Awesome and soft.  Great purchase
4.0,Light weight and nice for summer.  Take into restaurants when ac is cold.
4.0,Verynice.
4.0,4 stars only because they fit perfect as for performance they were very good until they faded only after a month and are rendered useless for blocking out the sun now
4.0,Very Nice....but hit my bunions!  so a return for me.
4.0,"So the band looks and feels great.  It is especially nice when you consider the price and that the steele band version of the moto 360 is $50 more than the regular leather band version.  I have a Citizen Eco-Drive watch and the metal band on that is nicer, but the difference is mostly that the Ritche band has sharper edges and larger links.  I'd go so far as to say that the Ritche band is probably 80% the band that my Citizen is.  It's a good band that is even better for the price.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars if not for the complete lack of any form of instruction.  I mean, nothing.  It comes in a zip lock bag inside a padded mailing envelope.  You get everything in the picures, but that is it.<br /><br />It took me some time to figure out how to remove links (Thank you youtube).  I had to remove two links and I have thin wrists for a guy my size. You can only remove 6 links if I understand the band correctly, two links from the end near the clasp and one link near the watch, and that is for each length of the band (both sides of the clasp) if that makes sense.  So it should be able to get pretty small if you were a lady, although I'll say it looks like a man's watch band and is pretty wide, but then the Moto is not a small watch.<br /><br />The screen protector went on no problem, just like any phone screen protector and it fit properly.  I think I'd be 4.5 stars if I could select that, because even the tiniest little paper with a picture showing how to poke the little posts how with the included tool would have saved me about 20 minutes of looking at the thing.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm very happy with my purchase and happily enjoying the classy look of a nice metal band on my moto 360.<br /><br />*** Update June 14th, 2015 ***<br />Thought I'd comment that so far so good with this band. I take it on and off a few times a day, it never sticks and there is no evidence of cracking on the back of the watch as I have read about. Very happy with it. I read another reviewer day they got a bad band and the clasp stuck and they had to break the clasp to get the watch off. I consider myself lucky since there aren't a lot of reviews so no telling how many of these bands are being used and performing good or bad.<br /><br />Price is still so cheap in my opinion that it's worth a shot.<br /><br />*** Update July 19th, 2015 ***<br />Still going strong.  I use the watch all day at work, check notifications and sometimes if my hands are full, I use the new gestures, flicking my wrist one way or the other to advance through notifications.  Band is still working like a champ."
4.0,"I have an average chunky baby, 2.5yrs old, 33 pounds- ordered a 3T and barely fits for summer days, i should have ordered a 4T for more wear out if it…. Be warned!<br />recommended otherwise"
4.0,"Not quite as brilliant as shown, but still a great buy."
4.0,"Comfortable, but not the best looking quality. But they'll do for a comfy fall boot."
4.0,"Love the look and style of the top. While the top looked nice and I received compliments, it fit a little tightly through the bust area. I'm about average bust size (36C). Still like it."
4.0,Ordered the black shoe but the white one was delivered. Luckily the boy is happy with them. Definitely fits tight and inconsistent with other Nike shoes. Hopefully it'll last him throughout the season without having to get a bigger shoe.
4.0,"This is a nice accessory, although the “red seams” could be a little lighter to match my LV."
4.0,"Could be bigger, but nice size."
4.0,I used it to go on errands and it fits what I need to carry for the task.
4.0,"A little clingy, but not too bad. Falls at a nice length for me to wear with my leggings. I like the fact that this tunic covers my 'assets.' Not so thin that I would have to wear another shirt underneath."
4.0,is a bit curved so it fits really well
4.0,These look grat and fit well.  Fabric is too fine and almost impossible to breath through so needs to be worn looser than I like.
4.0,The socks are very cute. The color palettes is classic that the socks can match with the various shoes easily.
4.0,"Very nice,soft,just a wee bit small"
4.0,"I bought the X-small and I normally wear a size 5/35. They are too large. However, they are very comfortable and warm so if the sizing were a little better, these would be 5 stars for sure!"
4.0,The watch is of pretty good quality; it looks exactly like the pictures and can be adjusted to fit any size wrist.
4.0,cute style and fit...the dress is casual enough and can be dressed up as well. i like the versatility of this and it's really soft on.
4.0,"I love the belt the only reason it did not get 5 stars is cause I have worn it twice and already lost 3 crystals. I found 1 and glued it back in and used the extras they sent and replaced the other 2. I put clear nail polish over the rest hoping that will help them stay in better. Otherwise the belt is great, made very well. I would recommend it to others."
4.0,Thin material had to wear camisole underneath of garment
4.0,"Great looking clock and seems to keep time. A little bit noisy, but not terrible."
4.0,This is a fantastic dress. I bought it as an option for a formal dinner. The material is real nice and the lace is soft. The neck line was beautiful and not too low cut. I am not a busty woman though. It is cut for plus size and unfortunately for me I am plus in my hips and arms but not in my waist. I bought a size 0X and although it fit my large hips beautifully and comfortably there was too much fabric in the waist. For those who are more apple shaped this would be stunning. The sash in the middle is a perfect width and would compliment the mid section well bringing the focus up to the neck line.
4.0,"I have these in the Large.  I am 5’9” 180lbs with an athletic build.  Typically, I wear a US size 10 or 12 in pants depending on the cut and most often a L in athletic pants.  These in the Large have a mild compression and fit well.  I did run a mile and they didn’t slide down but gelt looser on me then other workout pants.  The length, and seems all sit well against the skin.  I have washed and dried these with other gear and had very mild to no shrinking.  Color hasn’t faded.  The waist band is large and sits just across my belly button.  If you like more compression I think you could probably wear this a size smaller then your NORMAL athletic wear.  if you are new to athletic wear by a standard size and adjust accordingly.  Nice material and thick enough that no underwear shows though when doing squats or bending."
4.0,"I love the colour and the fabric of this dress.  I ordered a medium and it is a little large, but that isn't really a problem because I can wear it around the house and be comfortable!"
4.0,"I was impressed when they had peace arrived the fact that the horns are very sturdy and stand upright my only complaint is that it is a tight fit on the head so if you’re planning on wearing this for extended period of time in a party hopefully you have a small head because I was only able to wear this long enough to take family photos, and I have an average size head"
4.0,"It looks fantastic, but wish the belt material was wider"
4.0,These are absolutely beautiful.  They would look fantastic on someone taller perhaps.  They were a little too bulky for me because I am 5'0 and they were too big for my face.
4.0,Muy bien excelente y bonito vestido
4.0,"These look great. But they are a little tight for my (ample) dome. But for the price, they are very nice!<br />They are pretty dark which is good in a super bright environment. But not so good if you are trying to read your iPhone navigation screen while driving (not texting!)<br />But again for the price I really like them!"
4.0,"Honestly, I bought it only for the strap which is the closest match I could find for the old original Marlin (106 H110) made in Japan version of the watch I've owned since 1980.  Aside from that, the watch works and functions just fine and I put an old strap on it and gave it to my son."
4.0,Smaller than I would’ve liked but I was looking for a white purse and this fit the bill.
4.0,"Pendant is unique and diamonds are very sparkly.  The photo of where it sits on the body is accurate, but the description of the length is confusing, says both 16&#34; and 18&#34;.  It is 16&#34; and would have preferred a longer, thicker chain.  The chain is delicate, bright gold.  A feminine, inspiring design."
4.0,The shirt is nice. The style and color match the photo. Up close the lace is stiff and  the way it is sewn on looks a little cheap but overall I’m satisfied with it. The arms are a little smaller so if you have bigger arms this isn’t the shirt for you.
4.0,I don't know yet. They are a gift for someone else. Wish there was a choice to review these later or &#34;Are they gift for someone&#34;.
4.0,Love this necklace. Very sturdy (I've dropped it on hard surfaces & it didn't break or scratch)
4.0,Came in as stated!
4.0,"As others have said, a great cheap rock climbing shoe for beginners. I'm pretty new to climbing and these are great. They do wear down fast on the sides though, because there's just a small plastic coating there, but underneath it's just normal thick shoe material."
4.0,Dress fit as expected. Arrived quickly. Material is a bit more see through than desired. I intended to wear this as a swim suit cover up so for my purpose it is great.
4.0,"It's a beautiful dress and I like it, but the collar at the back is just raised up and I don't know what to do. Although, my thoughts are: if I can get a<br /> stamp button or something, i could tack it down underneath (with the button attached underneath the collar) so that it holds the collar down. Or I could use needle and thread to pull the collar down (from underneath the collar to the dress). I never expected that I would have this issue though with this beautiful dress and that's somewhat stressful to think about now."
4.0,They stay on your head through the night and the hair is not flat in the morning. I hope they wash up well.
4.0,"This dress is nice- it is stretchy too so it has a little ""give"" in the important areas.  I am 5'9 and 130 pounds and I ordered a small- see pic-- I used a strapless bra in the pic but a REGULAR bra works much better (not pictured).  Anyway, thought this was a burgundy dress- it is not burgundy like the image shows-- it is more of a cherry red with a hint of darkness."
4.0,"These gloves are really awesome, love the color settings."
4.0,"Nice but very, very small."
4.0,The material and design seemed to be great but I have to order a larger size. I returned these. I am not so sure that the sizing is according to American Standards. It seems that the zipper ought to be longer so as the pant may open wider so as to more-easily put the pant on instead of puling them up with effort.
4.0,Cute shoe for the price however it runs one size large.
4.0,"The quality seems to be good.  I can’t find any flaws in the material.<br />The one size fits all is a major dislike for me and limits usefulness.  Medium to XXL?<br /><br />I’m 5’8, 175 pounds.  Putting it on and tying it is a project. Picture putting on an apron sized for a 300 pound person, and then adjusting it to fit a 175 pound person.  I need my wife to tie it from behind.  It’s not something that you can leave tied, and slip it over your head.  I was looking for something with quick on/offs.<br /><br />This should be fine for extended time use after getting it on.  When you pull the lower straps, the apron assumes a good shape, going up as close to your upper chest as is necessary for most tasks. That should be useful for dog groomers, hairdressers, and for anyone trying to protect good clothing"
4.0,So far good product
4.0,"very nice applewatch bracelet, fits right on my apple watch size 38mm.. the rainbow color looks good but it also looks like dirty when looking on another angle."
4.0,Strongly made and durable. Very easy to clean.
4.0,"Nice colours, styles and fabrics, but much larger than the fit I expected."
4.0,"If you are debating in between two sizes, go with a smaller one.<br />Bra has absolutely no padding."
4.0,"I love the look and feel of this bra.<br />The color is awesome, reminds me more of an orange coral color.<br />The bra is high quality and made well.<br />I bought this for my daughter in a size 36D. I wear a 36 C and it's a tiny bit too big for me in the cup, but hardly noticeable.<br />The straps are very wide compared to what I am use to. But the adjustment hooks on the straps being metal do not allow the straps to slide which is nice.<br />The back enclosure is a 3 prong hook and eye. The back strap is also very wide, alot wider than I am use to.<br />The bra to me is over made for the size I received. These more heavy duty features are generally seen on larger bust size bras.<br />But I will say the quality is great all the way around.<br />I'm impressed with the quality and workmanship. This bra definitely keeps the girls where they need to be!<br />I'm not good at figuring out what size you would need but maybe by me giving my measurements and the size ordered you can get a feel for the size you would need to order.<br />I received this sample for testing purposes. My opinions are my own and I was not compensated in any way."
4.0,"This hat is great! The denim is a bit of a lighter wash than it seems in the picture, but the quality and embroidery is just as expected. It fits a bit large of you have a small/child-size head, but if you adjust it it fits fine! The button is also nice."
4.0,"The Mickey Mouse logo was off centered. Other than that, good fit. Its a Fruit of the Loom shirt so if you're wondering about the fit, try a size on at walmart so you can be sure."
4.0,"I'm enjoying it so far, Looks neat and elegant even on your hand for a watch under $20. Feels lightweight. It would make a nice gift for someone. Does feel a little fragile and the color is not quite gold but a darker shade almost like copper.  But to be fair  its under$20... I'm trying hard fo find a real prob but i can't.<br /> It even fell twice but it hasnt scratched. I've had it for over a month so I'll update my rating if it loses time or something like that."
4.0,This hat is what I want for my daily morning walk. Give 4 stars since it is  kinda heavy
4.0,The clothes are very comfortable! Great purchase
4.0,"I am a size 16w, apple shaped, and the xxl fit nicely. It is not as scratchy as some say. I washed w liquid fabric softner and hung dry."
4.0,"I love canvas bags and this one is super stylish.  I wish the shoulder strap was longer, but I can live with that.  Also, I tend not to like the three sectional interior; the middle section zips close which I guess is good for security reasons.  I guess I am just used to rummaging around in my old bag!"
4.0,This suit is great. It is very flattering to a wide waste like mine. I wear mine to water aerobics and the girls don't pop out so it serves its purpose well. The only down side is that it is double layered so takes forever to dry.
4.0,Just what I was hoping for. Very elegant. Goes perfect with my grandmothers pearl necklace.
4.0,"Unfortunately, they were too large to keep. But they appeared to be of good quality."
4.0,I will be wearing this as a house dress it’s SO comfy!!! Seems to be good quality. I wouldn’t wear it out though— it’s not very flattering.
4.0,"This watch has a pretty large face, which I like. The band is a metal mesh that closes by a magnet. It’s pretty, I love it. I just hope the magnet holds because I can see it possibly coming loose without me noticing it."
4.0,"My only disappointment is that the design is much larger than shown. I purchased this  for something minimalist, and it's much larger. Instead of centered as shown, it goes across the whole front, and is much wider as well."
4.0,Great hot. Great sound quality. Awesome price. And it keeps your head very warm. It even fits my big head.
4.0,"Cute,comfy dress. Fit true to size in a flattering way. It looked great for a party and received several compliments throughout the night. The four star score is because of the poor quality stitching and material pattern line up on the striped top."
4.0,Order a size up! I got the small and it was too tight all around but the medium fits amazing!
4.0,The pendant was so much bigger than I thought it was.  Still very cute!
4.0,I’m a size 18 and ordered a 5x it’s a little loose but it’s ok because it’s stretchy.  Overall it’s very nice.
4.0,"Daugher loved it, but it was a little big so turned a little and would catch on her jacket and come off if she wasn't careful."
4.0,"These are very good quality tights, very multi purpose, very stretchy, I however cannot use it because its too small for me but I plan on holding on to these until my daughter can fit into them!"
4.0,"A little tight on arms, loose on body? Looks great but a little too much loose material for me. I got a large I'm 5'9&#34; 170. Maybe I should have gotten a medium as long as the arms aren't too tight? Not sure. Other than that they are fine."
4.0,I would recommend to order a size larger than normal because they are very small.
4.0,I definitely stood out when I went to Dunn's River Falls in Jamaica. Absolutely fitting for the occasion.
4.0,"As others have said already, these do not provide a tight fit like control garments; they are the biker short equivalent of a slip.  That said, I think they could be improved if they were just a tad more slippery (they do catch a little on cotton), and I wish they looked a little more like a booty short, or a short that was meant to be seen.  The open detail actually makes it look more like lingerie in my opinion, and I like to wear them under short dresses for dance workouts.  I'm sure what I am looking for is out there, and this just maybe isn't it.  I do like the fact that the waist and thigh bands don't show under clothing, as other Spanx garments can often do."
4.0,"I'm a small, could've been tighter. The waist fits but rest of the skirt is rather loose"
4.0,"Good buy so far!  I'll update later if the color starts to come off but so far they're wonderful!  Came with the ball hard to get out on each but hubby fixed that.  Love the color but wish they were a tad brighter green like the picture, they're like a lighter lime green instead of a brighter Kelly green."
4.0,Good quality but over sized!
4.0,The rompers but pretty but it runs a somewhat small
4.0,I like the the variety but it’s like it’s no group god both shoes at a time it’s like 100 pieces of nothing that coordinates.
4.0,Not compression but super comfy tank top.
4.0,"I wear prescription glasses. Sometimes, I don't want to wear them but if I want to read, I need them. These can work for me outside when I want to read. When I go on vacation, I will take them so that I can enjoy reading around the pool."
4.0,"I might give it a 5 staring it was mine but it was a gift to a friend so I can speak to fit comfort or efficacy!  However she had a 5 ⭐smile when she opened it and planned to put it in her car to have handy!  Unfortunately not allowed to wear to work, lol!"
4.0,"This necklace is listed as being for a ""gift for Grandma"" but the ""generations"" inscription on the heart pendant can easily be gifted to a mother, granddaughter or child. It comes in a nice gift box. The quality isn't great - the writing is small and not particularly impressive, but it makes for a passable gift at this price range. OK but not exceptional."
4.0,"Nice t-shirts, I prefer that the material would be like elastic"
4.0,Sister liked it. Pretty big.
4.0,these are really nice joggers. I ordered a large and was sent a 3XL. There is no one in our house that can utilize these so I will give a review based on the quality of the pants.<br />These athletic pans are grey with white stripes and are 83% polyester and 17% spandex. They are soft to the touch but not that weird micro fiber feel. They are lightweight but feel like they would keep you warm. They come with a 1 1/2 inch or so elastic waistband complete with a heavy duty draw string. They have deep zippered pockets on both sides. They have open bottoms on the legs and a very classic look to them. They are definitely joggers you could wear to run errands. The are double stitched well and the quality seems high. I just wish they were the right size.
4.0,Muy bueno pero esta un poco pequeño es mejor para niños no para adultos
4.0,it keep me warm when I go for walk or run during the winter
4.0,I like this beanie. It fit nicely and the material was thick. It's just a simple beanie that goes with anything!
4.0,Really loved it fit as expected. Everything was good no complaint here :)
4.0,perfect for that special surprise after a night out with the hubby! comfy and love the way they come down lower than most - sexy!!  they were a little bigger than the size stated so order smaller.....
4.0,The color is beautiful. It is true to size. I may remove the buttons as they're a little too attention grabbing for me. This is form fitting and the seam goes under your behind so it is emphasized (not a problem for those of you who are slim or like to show off that area). My only complaint is the static cling is an issue so be sure to buy a can of anti-static spray.
4.0,I bought these on a Deal of the Day bargain. I like how well they block out sun glare but the downside is you cannot wear them on top of your head. They are too bulky and still to sit on your head. That's my only complaint.
4.0,Very comfortable and a great price
4.0,GREAT DEAL FITS WELL!
4.0,"The belt came in on time , but the way it was shipped to me could have been better when I got it the strap had a hole in it from the metal plate smashing into it an the main plate was a lil smaller than expected but all in all it’s still a very nice belt"
4.0,"It’s a nice jacket, but a little small for a medium."
4.0,"The quality of the product is great, design is unmatched - love this monkey thinker. They didn't fit me well, as I was looking for a more Muay Thai type of shorts. Great product otherwise. I would recommend for anyone doing MMA/boxing."
4.0,Works fine once you figure out how to install it.  No instructions in the package.  Little different than normal camera strap.
4.0,"Attractive, lightweight wallet.  I'm pleased with how it looks and happy that it has RFID blocking!  Shipped as promised."
4.0,Love how it feels....
4.0,Would have received 5 stars but I had to sew it after a few wears as the underwire poked out.
4.0,"Love them, bought as a replacement for the Walmart deck shoes I wear around the house as my homage to the sainted Mr. Rogers.  These shoes, however, are a full size too small.  I'm a 10.5"" purchased 11"" and they were tight front to back.  Put in the shoe stretchers, two days later, they're good not great.  SO if you're looking to purchase roomy/comfy over tight/maneuverable order a full size larger.  Again, love the shoes just wish I went for the 11.5""."
4.0,Love the dresses bought 3 of them and they all fit perfect. My only complaint is that the material is thin I wear a black slip or spanx underneath
4.0,I liked the socks but I ordered navy and received black. Now I have lot’s of black socks and still none navy.
4.0,Very soft and feminine!
4.0,"Overall I liked these shorts. They were very comfortable. I liked the high waist cut. I did size up as suggested by other reviews and description.<br /><br />I wish the shorts (outer part) were a bit longer so you did not see has much of the liner. I also did not like the color of the red. It was a little dull/almost rust colored. I was looking for a regular red.<br /><br />I did return these because of the color, but I will likely buy again when more colors become available in my size."
4.0,"Why didn’t the deliverer take a picture of the entire section of my front fence he pulled down to put it on my porch. It’s a soft, non- fragile package that weighed nothing. He could’ve thrown it over the fence as others have. Not very bright, this one"
4.0,I have them on now they are working well for me.
4.0,"I really liked the animal print so much I overlooked the fact that the zipper is in the front. I'm okay with it I guess, I'm just used to side or back zip skirts... I'll have to see if I warm up to it more over time. Everything else is more than satisfactory."
4.0,"Very cute pattern, runs a little big. I would recommend sizing down! But worked great for my 2 year olds party suit."
4.0,is very comfortable for when you are training
4.0,"This is a great deal for this pair.  I wear A LOT of tights.  I live in a climate where there are only about 4 months of warm/hot weather and I wear tights to work  most days of the year.  These are not for winter - they are not legging weight and not entirely opaque.  I think you could size up one size for opaque with no fit issues.<br /><br />I love footless tights to wear with boots.  The only issue with these for boots is that the don't work for me with booties.  They're a 7/8 length - which means, for me, they are above the ankle bone.  They don't quite go down far enough to wear with ankle booties.  For reference, I'm 5'3"" but have long legs and typically wear a 31-32"" inseam pant.  Likewise, I am short waisted.  So, these hit at my true waistline. They have no variation at the top and are not control top but do provide a decent amount of<br /><br />Nevertheless, these find a solid place in my wardrobe since I have many taller boots I wear with tights. "
4.0,"Very nice piece, very colorful. I bough it as a Christmas gift for my son and he was delighted. It is right to the size. I give it 4 starts because I haven't washed it yet, so I cannot tell about the quality of the fabric."
4.0,The top portion of the dress is a tad see through but overall it's a win! I'm 5'2&#34; and the dress is long enough that I could wear with or without heels. Definitely will be rebuying
4.0,After reading reviews I ordered up in size but it just feels weird. The sleeves fit fine but it feels snug around the chest area.<br />It looks fantastic though
4.0,"Fits good, nice design, arrived before expected."
4.0,"Bought them simply because they were on sale. However the quality really impressed me, would buy again even if they weren't on sale."
4.0,"Mostly love this! I keep it in my backpack which I take everywhere. When I am on a business trip or decide to have a few drinks after work with my friends, I pull it out of the backpack and us it as my purse. The only thing is that the cell phone pocket is a bit small for larger phones. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 which, with the protective case on, is just a hair too big for the cell phone pocket. The pocket will not securely close when the phone is in there."
4.0,honestlyit very cute light weight
4.0,"I liked the fabric, it’s thing and a bit stretchy, even feels nice to just use as indoor clothing but feels perfect for a good workout routine"
4.0,"The length was short as pictured and wearing leggings with the dress was perfect. The colors are good, though the green is more of a yellow green than true green. I'm about 5'4&#34; and wear a 36C bra size with a 29&#34; waist. The medium fit fine but with the elastic around the waist, the large may have been more comfortable on my waist, which felt a bit snug."
4.0,Definitely size up one size
4.0,"I like these and the pattern is nice but they are very light jersey knit and so remind me more of pajama bottoms than I thought they would. That said, I do like them for casual wear."
4.0,Print and texture were spot on.
4.0,Ordered large bottoms perfect fit /top tobig
4.0,"Hubby loves it. It was a little difficult to put on the watch but, once on it is great. comfortable and adjustable.......Maybe needed some instructions....."
4.0,"They are comfortable but thin, I am not sure how long they will last"
4.0,It’s exactly what I was looking for! I knew it would be a bit small but thank god the pants is amazing fit but the top won’t close which again I expected but it’s well made and for someone thinner it will be a great fit!
4.0,"Loved this dress. Ordered it in blue. For reference I'm short, 5'1 and weigh 160 lbs, I ordered XL. I normally wear size 12/14. I could easily fit L but I like loose clothing, it did drag on the floor.  Glad I ordered the XL. Very comfortable , thick T shirt like material with lots of stretch. Love the pockets."
4.0,"Bought these for my husband for Christmas.  The fit in the waist is as expected, but they are several inches too long on a 5’6” guy.  He says they are amazingly comfortable either way."
4.0,"Comfortable, good looking and a very reasonable price.  Fantastic with my casual clothes and easy off and on.  Will fit most wrists."
4.0,"This is not a sweatshirt it’s a long sleeved T. I expected it to be much heavier, but it checks all the other boxes for fit and cuteness. Keeping it."
4.0,I ordered a small and I love the way it fits it's baggy and very comfortable!!! I'm ordering two more colors!!!
4.0,I think it's made incredibly warm on Sub Zero days
4.0,The necklace is fine the pendant was small for me but it is cute:-)
4.0,"The arm holes on this jacket are very, very small.  May need to order a size larger"
4.0,I ordered a Large and everything fits perfectly except for my chest area its a little to tight
4.0,"So much larger then pic shows, my girl loves it tho.."
4.0,A little big but good quality. :)
4.0,Bought this as a gift for my grand child for the color sky blue. Didn't realize it was considered  fetish  where till I got the company labels.  Could have done with some with out the racey picture.
4.0,"Fits nice, However I do recommend going up at least 1 size."
4.0,Love the dress but size runs small:(
4.0,Normal dress but not without small deffects.
4.0,"Nice looking, but slightly  thinner material than expected"
4.0,"My pair fits perfectly. The quality is good. But personally, I do prefer it to be thicker or perhaps use other material that gives more protection. Otherwise, I feel it's not that functional."
4.0,"The 6-year-old Kirk in our house likes this shirt (we don't wear the pants) a lot, but thinks that it's a bit plasticky (I suppose, for the price one can't expect much more)."
4.0,I compared them to my polarized lenses from Oakley and realized they’re not as dark but they are much more clear haven’t had the chance to give them to my friend for him to have a pair of polarized lenses for fishing yet
4.0,"The bottoms were WAY TOO SMALL for me, BUT I was able to gift it to a friend and she adored it! You can definitely tell if you don’t have the cup pads in lol but the fabric is still good quality & it feels very sturdy! Beautiful, but unfortunately it came way too small for me as a Medium (it fit my XS/S best friend perfectly lol)"
4.0,"It's exactly what I expected it to be- an highly affordable watch with a few features.  Styled a bit like a rugged,  high-performance sports watch, it is a basic timepiece with alarm and stopwatch features (no timer).  There appears to be a compass on the face of the watch, but it is merely a design element and not actually a compass.  My watch came equipped with a several different colors available for lighting, which is a nice but unimportant little feature.<br /><br />The only misgiving I might have is that the watch is extremely bulky (about 5/8&#34; thick), which seems unnecessary except for keeping up the appearance of a sports watch.<br /><br />Bottom line- it's a good, basic watch at a great price, perfect for my needs."
4.0,Good dress. No complaints
4.0,"It's thin but I like it! Fits well, lays well! I would buy it again!"
4.0,Just what I was looking for. Bit pricey.
4.0,Metal colors nothing like pics. Gold looks like latex rubber. Others fit and look pretty good.
4.0,"The first one I got arrived with the loop on the pendant broken. A quick email with the seller remedied that, and in a few days I got a new one that was just fine. It looks shiny and nice. I used a different jewelry box to gift it to someone, and she liked it.<br /><br />She doesn't wear it often, but it hasn't broken yet. I'm still a little worried about how fragile it might be but no more problems so far. I paid more than 2x the current price, so my expectations may have been higher than a buyer right now would have."
4.0,I really like it....just was a lot thinner then I expected. I wore it to work and on Christmas Day.
4.0,"These worked perfectly as wings for flying keys and golden snitches at a Harry Potter / Hogwarts Birthday party! The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I feel they are maybe a couple dollars too expensive. That said, buying these wings saved me from buying velum paper, printing wings, and giving myself a hand cramp cutting them out. So, definitely recommend!"
4.0,Very comfortable!<br />I forgot I was even wearing jeggings... I felt like I was in pajamas all day.<br /><br />Love the zippers and the length was perfect.
4.0,"I love the fit and feel of this underwear. Everything stated about the 3 piece set, is true, except mine had to be sewn after just a few wearings.  If I purchase another set - I bought two - I know that I will need to secure the seams, and will do that first, before needed.  They are not tight on me, and the seams have not been stressed, this problem is from not securing seams well enough"
4.0,"I found it a bit difficult to figure out how to ""wrap"" this garment around me, but once I did, I found I liked the look.<br />I am barely five feet tall, and at 137 pounds, I'm definitely not what you'd call skinny, but even so this wrap actually looks good on me.<br /><br />It's comfortable to wear once it's on, but I don't wear it for ""pajamas"" as described; the garment loses its comfy-ness when I'm tossing and turning in bed.<br />Instead I wear it around the house on warm days. The fabric, 95% polyester and 5% spandex, has a cool silky feel against my skin.<br /><br />Laundering is easy: machine wash in cool water and hang to dry."
4.0,"I'm excited about this dress!  I am 5'6'' and 125lbs, small chest.  I was concerned based on the busty woman in the photo, but a size Medium fits me nicely.  It's a tad tight in the waist, but the large was too big for my chest.  The buttons are sewn on so I don't have to worry about seeing through that area.  I would've given this 5 stars except that the material is very thin and a bit see-through.  I can only wear taupe undergarments with it.  But I still really like it.  It will be perfect for my summer vacation!"
4.0,"Great shirt, not to tight sized properly. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because it took almost 1 month to receive."
4.0,"It’s a beautiful watch, large enough to read easily and yet not too large for my small wrist. The gold in the band doesn’t stand out enough."
4.0,They look great and feels great and are very comfortable and I love that they have pockets
4.0,I haven't used it yet but it looks ok. I like that it opens and closes with a push of a button. The spokes are some sort of plastic so that makes me nervous. But probably just me i always break my umbrellas. Overall it's above average for the price.
4.0,The shorts were a little large around the waist as the elastic waist band has a lot of give. The quality of the shorts are great but the shorts tend to slip down while coming out of the water.
4.0,"Needed the shirt for a new job. Other than tight around the shoulder, it fits as expected across the chest. If you are broad shouldered, it will tight while moving your arms."
4.0,"This mask is rather well-made, especially for the cost.  It's a good value, and it looks rather scary in a more realistic way than other masks available here.  The size looks like it would adjust to a variety of head sizes.  I wish there were a slit in the mouth to be able to speak easier or drink easier, but I suppose you could make one."
4.0,"Clear lenses, I wish the arms could be bent to adjust."
4.0,It works fine so far.
4.0,The bag is smaller than expected but great quality.
4.0,Super cute but just not what my daughter was looking for.
4.0,I was looking for this to be a M but it came a little larger than I expected. But other wise the person I got this for will hopeful wear it.
4.0,I  agree with other purchaser's.  Cute but beads do end upside down on wrist reguardless of how tight I tried to snap it.
4.0,"I like it, i just wish it was a little bit smaller. A little bit thin!"
4.0,Fits little too tight
4.0,"Belt broke after only a couple weeks wear, replacement was quickly mailed for free."
4.0,I love these earrings. I bought them because I had a pair before that I lost pne of and thought these were the same. These ended up being much smaller then my origional ones but still very pretty.
4.0,These are cute faux piercings. I don’t particularly like the variety but they get the job done.
4.0,"This was surprisingly well made for the price (I used to work in intimate apparel at a high end department store), but was just too small and uncomfortable for me. I normally wear an 18/20, 1X- 2X, and the 3X size was too small for me.  I like shapers with a bit more stretch, and this just didn't work for me-it was too structured. It would work better under a more formal gown. I ended up going with a Vassarette slip short that I found to be much more comfortable, but also provided coverage and smoothing.<br /><br />With Amazon's return policy I was able to return it without hassle, so it'd be worth a try. KSKshape's customer service is great, so you really have nothing to lose by trying this. If you aren't 100% satisfied (like me), they'll take care of you. In the future I will consider buying something from this brand knowing they'll stand by their product."
4.0,The original order arrived broken these are not so I'm glad about that. The earrings look like the photo.
4.0,It's good. Not great.
4.0,"I like the support provided by this sports bra and to have a front zip. However, if you have excess fat by your underarms it is likely this will start to dig into that area and make it uncomfortable to wear. I take that as my cue to set the girls free for the day."
4.0,"My girls love their lacey boots and enjoy the comfort. Seems to be holding up so far in this cold, wet climate here in Kodiak, AK. The material seems cheaply made, but for the price and style, we're not complaining!"
4.0,Looks exactly as pictured.  Only gave it 4 stars because the opal could use a Lil more sparkle to it ( sorda dull) but doesn't irritate my belly button ....so happy with the product.
4.0,"I expected this cardigan to be much thicker, like the one shown on the model in the first few product photos, but it was definitely thinner like the one in the last few product photos. I’ve included photos with my review so you can see that the sweater material is a little more widely weaved and basically just not chunky. I purchased the “1apricot”, for reference. Even if I had known the differences, I likely would’ve purchased it anyways, but only for the lower price (I got it under $14), as I don’t think it would be worth full price. It seems true to size (I got the small), flattering and wasn’t an oversized fit, which I liked. I’m hoping the price will go down on the grey so I can snag that one, as well!"
4.0,Mas o menoss
4.0,"Was about 2 sizes too small for me, i read the reviews stating this runs big but did not find this to be the case. Reordering a size larger."
4.0,hoodies are just as pictured very vibrant colors and fit just as expected but are very then thin are definitely not winter hoodies at all but good for wearing under a coat or jacket
4.0,I love the idea of the product. Very easy to clean. Depending on the mask and thickness of mask it is difficult to attach it to the mask. It plastic. So not the most comfortable I wish the would have something to make it softer on face. But it definitely does the job making it easier to breathe
4.0,Go with a size up you should be fine. Nice hot weather wear.
4.0,Worked as advertised. I like the shade of green. Only con is it needed some minor trimming to fit.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:4ebed42f75f3cfc413f8b26f1203311b]] Muy linda me encanto pero solo me llego una de dos que pedi
4.0,The product is exactly as we expect it in the price-quality ratio.
4.0,I ordered a small. Sizing chart was accurate
4.0,Love the hats... but was not happy that I had to buy two just to get the one mom of boys hat. But hey I was late on the order so can't complain much.
4.0,"It's a belt that works as advertised. Easy to use, doesn't slip, comfortable to wear, and it holds up my pants. Any other comment would be superfluous."
4.0,very cute in person
4.0,Pretty little things.  Just right for a teen.
4.0,This ring is beautiful and accurate it’s very true to sizing
4.0,"Definitely worth what I paid. Her outer coat isn’t a flat, patternless fabric and is why I chose this one in the first place. I’m glad I did, though! (In the photo, I am obviously not wearing a Hu Tao wig, it’s just the two-clipped pigtail wig i had on hand)<br /><br />SIZE<br />I was going for a size medium but the extra small was on sale so I thought I’d check out the fabrics and such to see if it was my endgame costume and it fit! Therefore, I would definitely say it RUNS SMALL and you might want to DOWNSIZE to avoid having to make size alterations.<br />This is not stretchy fabric, but it is still comfortable for me. I have full arm movement and am not worried about sitting or doing sick backflips.<br /><br />ALTERATIONS<br />All bow pieces will need to be sewn flat to keep their bow shape.<br /><br />I purchased a new vision to attach the the back but I just wanted something fancier.<br /><br />The socks, once snagged (easily done), are not salvageable. However, they’re just white socks and I’ve had no trouble finding replacements in my sock drawer.<br />The red flowers meant to go on the top of the sock around the calf are not super accurate to her in-game outfit, so I will be replacing those but they were not faulty.<br /><br />The hat is crumpled and I’m just not willing to put in the work to reshape it so I will be reattaching the details onto another hat.<br />The fabric flying from the back of her hat is boned to keep its flying shape, but it’s heavy! I might take the boning out due to it’s tendency to fall off, or I will better secure it to her wig once I get that figured out.<br />The gold front piece is bent but can be reshaped.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I do recommend this mostly due to the fabric used on the coat. It’s flattering when worn and any alterations I want made can be done."
4.0,Gift for my mom. She liked it.
4.0,"It's very cool, but a bit too big"
4.0,"Nice dress but I returned it. It fit as expected but didn't flatter my figure. Thick material, didn't feel cheap at all."
4.0,"Held my passport, other ID, credit cards, cell phone, money and change.  Cord is sturdier than on many other travel wallets.  Has a very long cord so I was able to wear it as a cross body wallet over my top and under my jacket and felt secure traveling while in a foreign country. When not required to show my ID, I turned the clear plastic side against my body so my ID wouldn't show."
4.0,Really cute but I thought the back was going to be see through like the image but it looks different
4.0,I found the shoulder strap in a side zipper weeks later thinking it was not in the package. Ordered another one so now ai have two.
4.0,"the slip is a *little* too short, but other then that, i love this skirt"
4.0,The Logo seemed a little over exaggerated but was over all cute ! Even got a compliment on it after trying it in. 💯🔥
4.0,Really like them but they're a bit to snug not for my round face
4.0,It sits way lower than expected other than that good product.
4.0,Made these into super cute earrings!! Love them! Some butterflies have marks or “bruises” on them but everything else is perfect
4.0,"They fit true to size (if anything slightly on the large side, but only a tiny bit).  The lower band on the legs is great and holds them in place.  I wish they were a couple of inches longer, but at least they aren't short-shorts!"
4.0,Fits really good. I’m 5’11” so I ordered a size larger.  I could not wear the face mask (I drive a school bus) because I could not see clearly out of eyes and no opening for the mouth.  The hoodie is really large and hard to keep on head. I will alter that for next year.
4.0,"Very nice dress, design not like anything I've seen in stores. Love the variety of color combinations to choose from. Fit was just right, you have to check size chart carefully since not American sizes. Overall, good fabric, nice color and just as described by seller."
4.0,"Kinda small, still hella cute though, as long as you're okay with some booty action."
4.0,"It fit well, not of the highest quality but worth the price"
4.0,"Love it, but, a size up would be better for me. I can wear it and do."
4.0,"Looks as in the photo, but a little tight om my 2 year old's head."
4.0,"I love the fit and nice look. The material has a slight itchy feeling, otherwise, I’m glad I purchased this."
4.0,"Nice and colorful. About 15% of them would not be able to be used to make jewelry, they are discolored."
4.0,"Soft colors are so pretty.  It is a silky nylon type fabric reminiscent of head scarves from many years ago.  I have yet to wear it because I think scarves in the summer are just too hot, but I will get a lot of use out of this when it is a bit cooler.  The colors online are true."
4.0,"5'3&#34; 123lbs ordered a size small. I usually wear size small, 4/6. Top fits well but the bottoms were just a little tight. There is a halter built into the top, but it is primarily a bandeau style, which inherently don't have a ton of support. The top is lined and has removable cups. It doesn't look or feel exceptionally premium but it is cute and a steal for the price."
4.0,A little large but cute
4.0,creased plastic band annoying but good enough for a hospital worker doing a lot of handwashing
4.0,"Not quite as dainty as I wanted, but I get a lot of compliments."
4.0,A little small but really nice pants
4.0,Very nice. Runs slightly larger than size. Maybe size down
4.0,"Me gustó que trae varios colores y es fácil de combinar, pero no está Muy ajustado y se cae."
4.0,ok for the $$
4.0,The lens seem well made in terms of clarity and magnification; the frames are thinner than other readers. So time will tell if they prove less able to withstand the constant 'put on and take them off' that I put readers through.
4.0,Doesn't look like support hose but hard to get on
4.0,I have more of a pointed up nose tip so you can tell it’s most definitely fake which I only bought them to test if I liked it before the real one. If you are getting because you don’t want to get the actual piercing be careful.
4.0,"The packaging for the glasses was excellent. In general, the glasses were average in reducing glare when driving,"
4.0,"Wore these for hiking, fit as expected, lightweight. Will definitely buy more"
4.0,Interesting look
4.0,looks and feels great. fabric is light and thin. i ordered a size up just in case it ran small nd it did. for the price its perfect.
4.0,"These are pretty cool. It almost feels like I'm wearing Raybans, but not quite. They are a tad crooked on my face though..."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:5d16dff887125b0efbcecd0a519a2558]] I really like the design on this sweatshirt.  As you can see in my short video, it is boldly striped but they are at an angle that lines up well with the sleeves when your arms are down.  The drawstrings on the hood are also intentionally off-centered.  It's a cool looking effect.<br /><br />The sweatshirt itself is fairly thick and I like the fact that the sleeves are long enough to cover part of my hand as well.  Too many times I get tops that don't cover my arms all the way.<br /><br />I also like the coverage that the hood provides.  When on, it completely covers my head and then some.  Great for keeping warm!<br /><br />The elastic bands on the sleeves and bottom help it to stay in place without being too tight.<br /><br />It's important to mention that this is definitely a ladies cut sweatshirt.  It tapers in the middle.  I usually wear a size medium top but I like my sweatshirts big and bulky.  I ordered an XL and although it fits well, it isn't as large as I had expected.  You can see how it fits in the screenshots at the end of the video.  Just keep that in mind when deciding what size to purchase.<br /><br />This sweatshirt provides great coverage and the pattern is definitely unique!. I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I like them, they fit nicely. When I got them, I did have to tighten one of the screws."
4.0,"Great space for all my stuff - including my iPhone X.  I wanted something to grab when I don't want to carry a handbag and this serves the purpose, but it is much bigger than I really wanted  Just have to get used to it I guess!"
4.0,I'm 5ft 9in. Size 10. I ordered a size 14. It just fits. Actually I wish it was a little bigger. The sleeves are nice and long. The material is beautiful. The ribbon belt is not good quality but that's fine for the cost of the cost. It's a perfect Kate Middletown-esque dress coat. I'm glad I ordered it. Plus it has pockets.
4.0,I used to complement a Halloween costume and I was a hit! People stopped me constantly for pictures on NYC Halloween Parade.
4.0,Super cute!!! Get it!!!
4.0,"Bought this for my Mom, who lives alone and she has been able to put on most of her bracelets without any help."
4.0,My 15mo old LOVES these slippers.
4.0,Nice and delicate as I was expecting
4.0,"The padding is rolling up on two. I do not wash them inside the bra so Not sure what is going there.<br />Besides that, they are comfortable. Fit well. I can easily wear them through the day with no issues."
4.0,Really like actual glasses. But recieved mine with scratch in lense. Want to reorder.  But scared to take chance . Very well built 1 thumb up if not scratched lens would be 2 thumbs up
4.0,Great product but a little big so the design was not shown on the face as expected.
4.0,I liked the material. It was very comfortable
4.0,"So far I'm happy with my new bag for work. I like that it has several compartments and it seems like it's going to be durable. I've been using it for just a couple weeks, but so far so good!"
4.0,"A little bigger and longer than most large, although the sleeves are a good length."
4.0,"I am using this as a desk clock. I like the contrast of the white hands against the dark face. This comes from overseas, so it takes a bit longer for delivery, but delivery is faster that the scheduled date. It's fun watching the mechanism.<br /><br />Unlike typical wind up watches, you can't let the stem return back while winding otherwise the mechanism doesn't wind the spring much and it takes too many windings to get the spring tight. Until I used this method, the watch would need 3 windings per day or it would run out & stop if I forgot to rewind it. I'm not sure if it needs to be broken in to keep good time & condition the spring, but it seems to gain about a minute per day. I couldn't tell how well it kept time when it it kept running out.<br /><br />This is a great accessory for a coat or if you wear gloves and can't easily see your wrist, but I wouldn't depend on it for my only timepiece. At least you don't need to replace batteries if you use it only occasionally."
4.0,They are well made but are a bit smaller than I was expecting. I’ll use them until larger replacements arrive.
4.0,"I like these earrings a lot. They are very small, which is just what I wanted. One doesn't open all the way so is a little bit difficult to put it in my ear, but I can and I like them. Good quality material"
4.0,I like the dress but is too long for a petite like me. I rarely wear it
4.0,These look so cute and are the perfect height when you just want a low heel! The ankle strap does come up a little high which caused them to move up and down a lot and rub my heel but I just plan to buy a heel cushion to put in them.I would definitely buy again.
4.0,I got the necklace for my gf and it's surprising decent size stone and also material overall was okay .<br /><br />Comes with a blue container that shine light on the necklace .<br /><br />Overall I will recommend trying to buy it as it's not a bad product.<br /><br />Plus comes with a gra  certification .
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8cf00164105ffc4ad874da77faccf70]] These are larger, cute bangles. I will say that there’s more in there than I thought which is really cold so you can choose to wear as many as you want. It was casually package, so nothing fancy, but the price is really good for these. I will say that a couple of the Bengals are a little bit scuffed. I hope to polish it up a little bit but they’re on the cheaper side. Obviously you can see what the price that they are on the cheaper side but there’s definitely something pretty if you’re looking for costume jewelry don’t expect us to be something to have for years and years but if you’re looking for something for now, and he like this style than I do, recommend them.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful."
4.0,Fit as expected. Wish the item haf stronger stitching.
4.0,"I like this necklace, it's cute and fits"
4.0,"5'7&#34;, 160lb, 36b cup<br /><br />Ordered a medium and it fits great. The length is just above the knee. It is a cheap material but it's definitely a fun dress."
4.0,The suspender skirt is great - the undershirt is really cheap and not cute- I bought this for the skirt....
4.0,It's fits nice
4.0,"This coat is ok for what it is.  I don't know why I had to order a 3X, I guess it runs very, very small.  I am usually a M-L."
4.0,"Love how the top fits, very comfortable but the bottom is too small, it looks like a thong on me."
4.0,"Pensaba que el material era,de mejor calidad pero es aceptable."
4.0,Not as heavy as I would have liked but very pretty and I did not get Dolphins as I ordered I got whales. But they're okay
4.0,Wanted a heavier shirt
4.0,The face and body of the watch is really nice but the watch links and chain seem loose ... But gotta say it is a nice watch
4.0,Very cute but not as sparkly as I was hoping for.<br />I have even tried polishing in case. to bring out sparkle but they just aren't.<br />If you know that and are good with that - then all good.
4.0,This shirt fits great.  I used it as part of a cover up for a two piece bathing suit.  Very see through (but that's the point!)
4.0,but  the snaps are opposite than my vest  had to return them
4.0,It's nice! The color is more beige than anything. I am petite so that's why it runs big
4.0,Great running shoes
4.0,Nice looking purchased as a gift.
4.0,Beautiful but runs large so had to return
4.0,My son loved these for his Christmas present but a little tight. When ordering may want to go up one size.
4.0,"I like the shirt a lot. Never disappointed in my purchases!!!  I am usually an extra small to a small and must have thought I wanted to layer this so I will because I got a medium. Love shirt, my mistake. Totally true to size. Shirt is well made and great material."
4.0,My son likes it and he's pretty picky about his hoodies.
4.0,"I actually really like the hat.  Unfortunately, it is a little large for my head.  I wore it on a slow casual bike ride and ended up holding it in my hand because it kept flying off of my head."
4.0,"The shirt is thin than I thought, its not as long as pictured, but it is comfortable."
4.0,Very comfy. Love them.
4.0,These were perfect for a toddler girl (2-3 years) and have held up for a year.  The designs are really cute and age appropriate.  Not comfortable for long periods of wear but fine for dress up.
4.0,"Very cute and light earrings. Great size. Love how they look. My only issue is that the backings fit loose. The earring has fallen out while I sleep, in the shower and while brushing my hair.  If I order a stud earring, I wear them constantly and expect them to stay on. I need to find a tighter fitting earring back."
4.0,"Did not buy this on Amazon but I got one for my new iPhone 8 Plus a few weeks ago. Well wouldn't you know it -- I dropped it last night from about 3ft onto a concrete surface. Upon initial inspection I thought my screen was cracked but after removing the (cracked) Samurai protector I realized it was in perfect condition. BIG relief! The protector was a little difficult to install straight and the very edges were still the slightest bit raised, but it did its job so that's all I care about."
4.0,the jeans were comfy and true to fit. my husband couldn't tell that they were not jeans unless he got up close. however they were too pricey for all that they were
4.0,"Love this shirt!  It’s comfy and cute, but I sized up after seeing reviews. Just get your normal size."
4.0,"I had already tried another more expensive brand of these stick on readers and had a heck of a time installing them so I figured I'd try these being a little cheaper . Once you get these to stick they work as good as your regular glasses . Getting them to stick is frustrating but if you watch the video these nice folks made and follow it to the T you will get them to stick with patients , getting all the bubbles out that's a different story . I took it one step further than just hot tap water , I used dang near boiling water , the more plyable the magnifier lens is before you put them on your glasses the easier they stick . Once in place they stay till you peel them off , they don't leave any residue on lenses when peeled off . Very pleased to have readers on my Costa Corbinas one of the few you can't get factory bifocals in . Seeing the electronics and flying knots is much better with sunglasses on ..... Also these folks send the instructions in big type , readable without readers .... Unlike the other brand....<br />Thanks"
4.0,Quality. Not good at all but looks fancy as hell<br />Love it
4.0,"Size Medium. I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs. Runs a bit large. Sleeves are very long - I cuffed them and it looks cute! Definitely not a fitted sweater. Loose and roomy; also, very lightweight. It's almost gauzy. Not really warm. Just enough to take the chill off. It will be perfect for spring! 4 Stars. Hope you find this review and pictures helpful! No chemical smell but very staticky on arrival!"
4.0,"I luv the look of this jacket, but it's not made well, & it runs really narrow. I'm a small woman [barely 5ft tall, barely 90lbs], but I took other reviewers advice & ordered a Medium, & I'm glad I did ... the Medium fits tightly ... I can't wear it over anything bulky. <br /><br />Since I'm so short, the jckt is longer on me than on the model or in the customer foto. The jckt ends at their waist, but on me it goes past my waist down to my upper hips, & it fits snugly all the way down. The sleeves are long on me too, they go down to where my fingers start, but I dont mind since I luv the way the jckt looks. I like the snug fit even though it's sized for taller women than I am.<br /><br />I've worn it 5 or 6 times, & the pleather sleeves have NOT started peeling as other reviewers have claimed, but one of the metal spikes fell off the lapel & was loose in the pkg when I received it, & another few fell off since then ... it's not noticeable [yet], but it will be if this spike-loss continues, & it probably will.<br /><br />Just like Fast Food, this jacket is Fast Fashion! Clothes like this are made to be worn for a short time & then discarded.<br /><br />As I said b4, it's a cool looking jacket that's poorly made. If the pleather sleeves start peeling, I'll likely just cut them off & wear it as a vest for awhile & then trash it when the whole thing starts falling apart, which I bet won't take long, but in the meantime, I really do luv the way this jckt looks!"
4.0,"fits a little snug, but that's my fault."
4.0,Soo very cute. I only gave 4 stars because the backs I think should fit alittle tighter. They kept coming off and i was loosing them too much so I don't wear them any longer. Other than that I loved them
4.0,"I ordered a large, I'm usually a medium but wanted extra room. This was very fitted, so it ran small.<br />Comfortable, too early to tell how it will wear."
4.0,"I am pleased with the fit and quality,  I think it's a good value.  The dress zips in the back so it's easy to put on.  Although it has a lining, it may still be somewhat sheer so I will probably wear a slip underneath."
4.0,I wish this was done better as it was almost perfect. The jacket is definitely the right color and size but the design on the back can neither be read as the “made in heaven” words cant be read and the design of the woman on the back had been modified slightly but can be fixed on your own if you know what you’re doing.
4.0,I love this jacket. I bought it in a cream color and decided to get the red one too. I ordered a medium (as I like it a little loose) but received a small. One star less for the wrong size sent but product is great!
4.0,Very comfy... Glad I bought them.
4.0,It’s a cute scarf. But it is definitely small than the one pictured. It doesn’t hang as low or as broad as the picture shows.
4.0,Love gow it looks on me
4.0,"Per many of the other reviews, these earrings are assembled backwards.  I used a pair of needle nose pliers to pry open the loop and flip the charm around.  Aside from the QC, these earrings are nice and a good value."
4.0,"Great Colors, Well Made & Knitted. Sized About 23-24 Cm. Across The Top. A Fine Yarmulke For The Price, Quite Nice."
4.0,Beautiful design & has a slip underneath.  I had this in my basket for a while & glad I purchased!
4.0,"This hat is awesome, the string broke but can be fixed. Perfect for my costume. Fit an adult medium sized head."
4.0,cool for the price.
4.0,Nice fit and made of interesting material...not cotton but kind of thin bathing suit material. Will work for the beach.
4.0,The garden shoes are very light weight and run a little small. I usually take size 8.5 so ordered a 9 and it is still a bit small. Otherwise as expected.
4.0,Great watch....!
4.0,Cute a bit more revealing than I thought and kind of lose in the back but overall will wear nicely
4.0,"I ordered the large in Navy (5'7"", 37"" bust, 29"" waist, 40"" hip) and could have gone with the medium. I was worried that my broad shoulders wouldn't fit comfortably, so I got a large. For the price, it's a decent dress. You may need a slip on the bottom, but the top is fine. I wish the cuffs had been a little tighter, as well as the skirt as shown on the model. The skirt is not so much of a ""pencil"" as it is just a straight down skirt. Also something to note, the belt isn't attached, so you have to iron and tie that separately (yes this is a dress that will have to be ironed as it wrinkles easily). Overall, I am happy with the purchase though!"
4.0,"These shorts, although quite comfortable, do slip in the waist a bit and you have to tug them up now and then.  This isn't a deal breaker for me because I was looking for shorts to wear in the house and working in the yard and I like them roomier for comfort.  A tug here and there isn't a big issue for me.  Other than that, they fit well, are true to size,  don't squeeze the bottom of my thighs, and are substantial (not see through) material.  The other thing is they don't cling so much as to reveal your butt crack...nice smooth fit.  I'm 5'4 around 140lb, am short waisted and got the large.  I'm not sure how these would work for exercise with the waist issue, but I wear them around the house and doing gardening work."
4.0,"Awesome shirt, good quality. Although I did slightly rip a seam near the collar trying to take it off. Aside from that, there aren't any other negatives, aside from it being a little tight around the shoulders, but that's probably just my weird body"
4.0,Great colors. Decent quality considering price.
4.0,Beautiful watch I know my husband will love. Wood is for 5 year anniversary dates and this was the perfect gift with the infinity sign as we have matching infinity tattoos. Fast shipping. Came as said it would.
4.0,"Shirt was more like a large, not xxl like I ordered. Pants were correct."
4.0,I love that the straps can be adjusted.
4.0,"I got a small and would have exchanged for an extra small if they made that size. It’s much thinner than the pictures make it seem. Robbed material, form fitting, just wasn’t thick enough for my liking. I was going to a fall event outdoors so I would have been too cold, and the ribbed non-sweater material looks kinda cheap."
4.0,"Very nice. Good price. I've been looking for a turquoise banded watch but most cost more than I wanted to pay.  I like the bracelet style except that it doesn't quite fit far enough around my wrist to feel it is secure.  Overall, very nice looking and easy to read. When  I'm wearing my turquoise jewelry this will be my &#34;go to: watch."
4.0,"My wife looks wonderful in this dress.  The horizontal stripes work very well to accentuate her curvy figure.  She is a shorty at 5'1&#34;, so the dress sits right at her knees.  I would have given it 5 starts, but her only complaint was that it doesn't breath well and causes her to sweat more than she would like."
4.0,Comes in a super cute gift box :)
4.0,"Very nice chain. It’s a thinner chain as I had problems after 2 years of daily use. It was very quickly repaired, but I did eventually get a larger size. Very good chain as a first chain or even for younger people in general."
4.0,Will be warm!
4.0,Pants are larger than expected
4.0,"Great pj's.<br />So cute,  he absolutely  loved them , so did everyone else.<br />I just wish they were thicker so he would be warmer, not that he cares lol he's 3 ( did we really feel the cold when we were ). Hahaha"
4.0,i loved them
4.0,I use it mainly for sun protection.  It is a mesh style fabric so it breathes well but may not be ideal for virus and dust protection.  You can fold and double it up for better protection  The size is a bit on the bigger side which makes it more comfortable for me.
4.0,"This coat is really warm and comfortable.  The pockets are not really well thought out, though.  The breast pocket won't hold my cell phone."
4.0,"The quality of this band was very good.  Instructions for removing links was not good but I figured it out.  If you get the rose gold color, be aware that it does not match the Apple Watch rose gold - it's more copper color."
4.0,"I wasn't expecting amazing quality so I was overall pleased with how nice this necklace looks and how sturdy it feels. However, I had to re-glue the magnet within an hour of use. It is holding up nicely now. I purchased it for my 3 year old daughter that is obsessed with snakes. She absolutely adores it and said it is the most beautiful thing she has ever seen and I agree it looks very nice. It is very long though; it would fit better on an adult."
4.0,"The picture was a rich plum color but the masks that arrived were more lavender. They’re comfortable on my larger-than-average head and easy to breathe through. The nose bridge likes to creep up into my eyes but it’s not too bad. All in all, I’m satisfied."
4.0,"Warning: if you are looking for a full coverage but a “will still make you feel attractive” underwear these  are not the undies.  The 4  stars is for the accurate description of the product. It is really soft Modal and  the panties have full coverage. And when I say full, it is really to the brim full and high waisted 🤪  This product is not for me though.  Although the undies are breathable, I feel like I am wearing a diaper and traps in the heat. These are bombastic sized underwear. I will not return. Instead, I will wait until I turn 90 to wear them, maybe then it’ll look attractive on me 🤣"
4.0,"This top is so cute, the colors are so vibrant! The only thing my daughter doesn’t like is that the rash guard on the chest is itchy."
4.0,Worked well for crafting event purchases for customers.
4.0,I love the slave bracelet.  I gave it 4 stars because the quality is great and the construction is sturdy and love how the size can be adjusted.  I have big fingers and I wish that the onyx setting on the ring was larger.
4.0,"The magnets are not very strong in the band, it easily comes undone."
4.0,Very nice dupatta. Very pricey though and not happy with the price at all. Wonder why I ordered in first place. It did have a long delivery date too begin with but was delivered ose to the minimum date range that was specified.<br />It's a nice beige color with beautiful embroidery and has small lace along the corner.<br />Price is my only issue and wish seller would lower it. For $10 it's fine but not for$17.
4.0,"It fit just like the original. Material seems to be a little stiffer, where the original felt more like silicone. No instructions, but just four torx head screws. The screwdriver they included fit those, but the replacement screws they included were not correct, so don't lose the originals! All in all, I'm happy with it, but those little issues keep me from giving it five stars."
4.0,I wanted to wait until I wash them couple of times to see how they hold up before writing a review. I think they are good products so far. I wear them for running so sometimes I feel they don't cover much but that's not an issue in a hot climate city.
4.0,So pretty but if you have larger arms it won’t fit well.
4.0,"Good size bell bar, opens on both ends, items rainbow is extremely much smaller than I would of liked.<br /><br />Otherwise seems to be well made"
4.0,"They screw in perfectly, don't skip thread.  They are difficult to keep as shiny as they started though"
4.0,"I like this bag, but I don't love this bag.  The zippers aren't the best quality ...  sometimes they separate, so you have to treat them gently.  As other buyers have noted, the pockets meant to hold cell phones are too shallow to do so.  But I just put my phone in one of the zip pockets on the front of the bag.  The color and style of this bag is excellent...  the canvas is decent quality.  It's a good casual bag for the price you pay."
4.0,"My fault - I should've double-checked the dimensions, but it was smaller than I expected after looking at pictures of girl holding purse.  I ended up passing it down to my 12 year old daughter, and she loves it."
4.0,"I love this item,  I just can't wear it because the leg seam shows under everything. If it were capri length I would wear it everyday.  If you have thick thighs like me and don't want obvious inventions showing on your legs in jeans or pants its not recommended, but would be great under a skirt!"
4.0,Nice crop top to style in but not enough support for a sports bra.  They run a little big.  I would suggest go smaller
4.0,Soft easy to care for fabric.  A tad larger than other sweats this size.
4.0,"Bought these headphones for my infant son. He is 4.5 months old and our family does a lot of outdoors, loud activities over the summer (i.e. Concerts, ball games, etc) We tested them out at a baseball game. When we were first seated, he was immediately startled by the loud cheering and clapping. I put the headphones on him right away and he was completely unaffected by the crowd afterwards! His face looked a bit smooshed and the piece seemed a little heavy for him, but he never fussed with them on. I tried them and even though they were snug on me, they still fit an adult. I was able to still hear, but it was most definitely not as loud as it was without them. The headphones come fold up pretty compact and come with their own carrying case. Overall, I was very pleased with the product. I purchased this product at a discount for my honest review."
4.0,"I would buy again, good quality"
4.0,Really soft I ordered the newborn but got the 0-3 so bummer but very pretty.  I will say the color pink on the bow of the hat is not the same as the pink on the writing on the gown. Not a huge deal to me but if you are picky that might bug you.
4.0,Perfect size. Easy to keep everything organized which means easy to find stuff
4.0,"Held up good for about 2ys ok, starting to have issues with the sliding sole coming apart. I bowl in 2 leagues and about 3-4 tournaments a year"
4.0,Well insulated
4.0,It's good stuff
4.0,Size ran a little bit on the snug side.
4.0,"I liked everything xcpt 2 things. They break easily, evn if U very careful with them & they don't sell them anymore!"
4.0,It is a good buy for that price.
4.0,"I normally buy name brands such as Michael Kors or Brahmin.  But with two kids in college, I was looking for a better deal.  This was a better deal.  I've been using the bag for a few weeks now and really like it.  The red color of my bag is very rich looking.  The bag seems to be well made and carries a decent amount of items (i.e. a book, 2 apples, shoes, bills, etc.) without seeming to strain the handles at all.  I would have preferred the bag without the middle zipper section since I use it as a tote, but I'm still managing to use it as a tote despite it. Also, I do wish the bag had 'feet' on the bottom to protect the leather when you set the bag down, but again, for the price, this is a really nice bag.  Finally, I'll also confess to 'stealing' the 'MK' silver decorator clip/chain from my real Michael Kors bag and clipping it onto this bag.  It looks great....and expensive!"
4.0,I brought this for my mom and she loves it.
4.0,"Seems to be of good quality and detailed.<br />Only problem is that you only get one and the Amazon listing doesn't specify that. Now, I have to go back and purchase another one and pay for shipping and handling again.<br />Overall, nice."
4.0,"The opening to the feet are TINY!! After I got them on it got better though. I bought a medium which I am. I'm 5'6 140. The crotch area is a little tight and the top band was a little rolly, but hey guess what they don't show cellulite like advertised. You get what you pay for and that's what I was looking for after all!"
4.0,Pendant was slightly larger than I imagined but pretty nonetheless
4.0,"I love these! They are so warm, I wore them to play in the snow with my kids. I would go down a size, though."
4.0,Its creepy. What else are you wanting it for?
4.0,"I SO much love this!  But sizing can be iffy so I'll try to help you choose, depending on color because as in some clothing, certain colors run smaller/larger.  I normally wear a woman's Large top.  I bought this in XXL (Secret Garden color) to wear as a big, comfy ""housie"" (warmth layer over a t-neck or long sleeve t-shirt).  I also bought it in an XL (Eggplant color) to wear as a less oversized pullover jacket layer for errands. Both sizes/colors work great for intended use.  Here's where color may matter.  I then bought another XL in Storm (almost black) which is insanely small.  A good 3-4 inches smaller around than the same size in Egglant.  I don't know if that's a function of the Storm running smaller across the board or if it's a random variation within a given size regardless of color.<br /><br />Review otherwise:  Fabric is butter-soft, thick, fluffy-ish comfy-wumfy, really nice.  It machine washes and dries very well.  Snaps are quite sturdy but not too heavy for the fabric and seams are sturdy also.  Due to fabric thickness, thankfully its collar is single layer, not doubled; and it'll lay flat behind your neck.  Also not imposing if worn straight up to block chilly breeze and the collar has flexibility  The so-called ""kangaroo pocket"" is just strange IMHO.  Made of a nylon-ish fabric, it's fine for a lipgloss or hankie but when a cell phone sinks to the center it pulls the sides in.  (I will definitely cut that pocket ""tube"" in half and hem each separated pocket because I'd like to keep my phone in one.)  Style is boxy (not nipped in at the waist) and has shirt-tail cut at the side seams.  Warmth:  Fabric breathes so it's not inherently hot, but it provides very nice, cozy warmth.  Since I wear mine as a jacket, important to me is that the neck hole unsnaps far enough to get over head without touching hair and I haven't found the fabric to particularly retain static electricity.<br /><br />Overall, undoubtedly the best Housie jacket I've ever had and since I'm fine with a non-fitted cut, I also find the not-so-huge Eggplant one is great for errands."
4.0,I gave  four stars because the colour is not what was depicted and it fits close.. I do like it though and would recommend but for smaller frame women
4.0,Chain was a lot shorter than I thought
4.0,"I'm giving this a 4 star. I only worn them once. If I had more time to use them the rating could be different.  This is the first time I used shirt stays.  It was NOT uncomfortable. They did keep my shirt tucked in.  Since the style is a Y shape, where the bottom attaches to your socks and the top attaches to the tail of your shirt, the top...one strap was snug while the other strap was a bit loose. There is not a way to lengthen or shorten the top straps. I probably need to use them more to find the perfect place to connect them. Overall, I am happy with them."
4.0,I bought this shirt to pair with a skirt I bought for work and it is just what I was looking for.  Really comfortable and fits great.  Perfect for a casual office setting.
4.0,Like the dress but the back hung longer in back no matter how I tried to adjust it. It served the purpose I bought it for!
4.0,It was expensive but nice
4.0,"The embroidery is a bit haphazard looking up close and the points are not fixed down as well as I would like, but you certainly get the look in the picture and it's comfortable."
4.0,"I was thinking this jacket was so heavily discounted from its original price because it was from last season.  I saw it last winter and wished I had purchased it. So I was pleasantly surprised when I found in on Amazon this winter.  The colors are beautiful, it is so warm.  I love the designs on the sleeves.  However, I am wondering if maybe this jacket is defective.  The left sleeve is a pain to get my arm into.  The liner inside of it is twisted the other direction (sewn in that way) to the outer liner and i cannot get it to untwist completely.  So there is a constant tugging feeling.  I can untwist it enough to get my arm in but it is still annoying.  A little disappointed but the defect is tolerable."
4.0,"Cheaply made, but for the price I feel you get what you pay for. Nice costume jewelry or for a girls stocking stuffer."
4.0,I love the ombre pattern and the green is as pictured.  The material is thin and stretchy and the legs are longer than I need. They are wearable and I look forward to cooler temperatures when I can wear them.
4.0,Lots of compliments and good fit for my aunt!
4.0,"This is a nice watch. I love the color of the watch face and the mesh band. It fits great and would be a great watch for someone who doesn't use their arms and hands a lot. The band has a magnet in the end which attaches to the band itself, no clasp. It gets knocked loose all the time form my work and I am afraid that it will end up getting lost or even broken."
4.0,"These are well made, but they are too big for standard size chickens. They are better suited for buff Orpington sized chickens."
4.0,no heel of any sorts more slipper
4.0,Nice enough suit...
4.0,I received my dress today and it is beautiful. the color pops and it is a great design. The dress is not true to size. I ordered a XXL and it fits like a large. Snug.. very snug. other than that the quality and material is quite good. not super stretchy but cute for the summer. if your the fluffy body type and your normal size is xxl go up a size.
4.0,"It is very well made, Burma little small.  I do love it."
4.0,"A nicely made, simple, slim wallet. Professional stitching, smooth leather material. It's labeled for men but I think it could work for either a man or woman.<br />I love the little ""owl eyes"" symbol in the bottom corner. It's not huge and cheesy like most company logos. Very subtle and cute.<br />Perfect for when you're going to anyone event like a concert and don't want to bring your important documents with you. Will hold your ID plus a couple cards and some cash. Card sleeves hold the cards in nice and tight but they're also easy to remove.<br />No complaints so far. Will update as needed."
4.0,very soft almost felt. Like wearing a blanket. Nice and warm but I couldn't get the small up over my hips. I'll try a medium but the waist in the small is very very small. Nice otherwise.
4.0,Love the belt… well made & looks authentic!
4.0,"This is a really cute hat.  I love the knit pattern with the fleece lining, it is warm and perfect for a cold snowy day."
4.0,Wife looked so so sexy in it  just like I was hoping so thanks
4.0,"It’s beautiful, but thought it was bigger. It’s actually about the size of a quarter."
4.0,It doesn't fit his head but I'm going to try to shrink it. He's 5 months and does have a smaller head. But it's huge.
4.0,Cute earnings! I Like them a lot!
4.0,Thick material for cape which is nice. The mask was pretty basic and the bat on the mask was glued on at a bitnof an angle. But otherwise my 4 year old likes it.
4.0,I purchased the necklace for a 60's themed party and got lots of complements on it.  It was inexpensive but of good quality.  I purchased the matching earrings as well and thought they were also good quality.
4.0,Everything is good but my wrist is too big  i need longer bracelet  please tell me what to do to make it longer please ? did you all sell longer parts so that I can extend it so that I can wear it  thank you.
4.0,"This top is gorgeous and well made, but the sleeves are tight."
4.0,Fit was great for my daughter and she loved it!
4.0,"Right out the packaging i love the detail. Sadly it was way to large. I ordered a medium after reading the sizing chart and was sad that it did not fit. All the buckles open and close on this corset which i think is cool. The detailing is nice however this corset has no support, there is no boning. If you have larger breast this may not be the corset for you. Also the back zippers look more silver than gold! This I truly love, and I hope I can return this for a smaller size because in all it is just right for my cosplay."
4.0,"Fit great, looks alright, works well as a shower shoe for college. The band cab get a little uncomfortable for extended wear however"
4.0,It fits a little loose but other than that its amazing!
4.0,"I had previously purchased a pair of black jeans of this style and really liked them.  I ordered the same size in this color.  These seem to fit a little tighter and are more like leggings than the black pair I have.  I will keep these as they are very comfortable to wear and hope that they stretch out a little with time, repeated washings and wear."
4.0,The overalls fit as expected. The shirt is on the wider side which made it fit in the overalls weird.
4.0,They look good but they fade very easily.<br />I got it for a friend because it looks just like her dog.
4.0,I really like it. Good quality. It does runs small.
4.0,Gave as a gift and they loved them!  A great value and lots of extra socks to make up for those lost to the dryer monster.
4.0,"This is a crop top meant to show some skin. It is not skin tight. I ordered a medium so it gave me a little bit of a boat neck but it might just be my own proportions. It's a great top, it's just not for me."
4.0,Off on size and very costly
4.0,The colors in the frames r awesome.
4.0,up close it looks like wood print vs actual wood.  otherwise not bad for &#60;$20 price point at the time of purchase.
4.0,"Top quality shoe, they run a little small however. Buy a half size larger than you normally wear. FYI, they might fit a little better."
4.0,I use this garment as an undergarment for modesty sake. It feels good to wear and keeps my opened armed garments from exposing my flesh.
4.0,The quality fabric. Very impressed.
4.0,got a lot of compliments on this one! great buy!
4.0,"I love the bra...but, it was to small for me.  I gave it to my daughter and she loves it.<br />I had bought a Lg and ordered an XLg for myself."
4.0,"Good quality Leather and nice buckle.  If you have a large wrist , you may want to look for one marked &#34;Long&#34;.  My wrist is average and I need to use the third hole from the tip."
4.0,"The only reason this is not a five star is because even with a slip (under garment), it was not a smooth look. Other than that, it was great."
4.0,These are good skid proof shoes and I would love to buy the next size up but they have been discontinued for some strange reason.
4.0,Ordered two for Christmas gifts for my sisters. They were just what I expected from the product description. Very pleased with my purchase.
4.0,Easy to install but it was just a little to small thought it would have been a bit bigger but I made it work
4.0,Small elasticity. And the price is slightly expensive. But not bad.
4.0,I take a large in everything. 40B. this is too roomy and theres no closure so I'm always pulling it around me all day. Order a size down
4.0,Runs small order size up or too
4.0,"Looks exactly like the one in the picture; however, after one week it started to rip. Considering how much I paid, I can't complain about the little rip."
4.0,"Good, but a lot darker than I thought they should be."
4.0,The pant would be perfect but it was too small in the waist
4.0,Nice and quiet 👍
4.0,"Fits well, stays on all night even when I sleep wild, and doesn't isn't so tight that it leaves a mark on my forehead. Is soft and silky and does what I med it to. My hair is medium length (past my shoulder blades but not past the middle of my back) and thick. It all fits into the bonnet easily with TONS of room to spare whether I have it braided or just out and wild.<br /><br />The one issue is that the dye from the black side seems to bleed into the pink side as you can see in the pic. Not a big deal for me, but it happened after less than a week of use."
4.0,This Dress is very sexy. I wear a size 10 and a C cup. I ordered a size large.  I have an ample behind. I am 155 and 5’3”. It’s a little loose in the chest area but fits perfect everywhere else. The slit does come up to mid thigh. But I wore it to work anyway. Professional and sexy.
4.0,"Great concept, however the size is a bit small. My granddaughter is 5 months old and is small. These &#34;sock ons&#34; fit tight now, can't imagine them fitting very much longer."
4.0,"I bought these for my 13 & 8 year old granddaughters. They did not fit the 13 year old-too small. Too large for the 8 year old. Both girls are slender, but normal sized for their age. I was disappointed that they didn’t fit. I don’t recall measurements-if they have them, it might help with the sizing problem, especially since kids grow a lot during that time of life."
4.0,So comfortable. My only issue is that is has to be hand washed.
4.0,My kids love them and it does help them being on the computer for school
4.0,Fit well and provided instant support!
4.0,"The way it looks is good. But holy poop, it smells so bad. Like oil. I had to wash it before wearing it. And it shrinks a bit"
4.0,"i love these so much! please make more! at first i got a pair to test them out because i always have trouble finding the right pair of super skinny jeans and these were the best ones i came across!! i have 5 pairs now and i want to buy more, two jeans came in a bit off but they still fit pretty good!!"
4.0,"I bought the regular size for my husband and it smooshed his face so hard, he had to wear glasses to push out the material from his face to see. Otherwise, it would press into his face so hard, it would pretty much push his eyelashes into his eyes, lol. Other than size issues, it's a good quality product. The material is durable and not too shiny like a lot of them on the market."
4.0,"Great look and super durable, but very tight around the toes. Definitely buy a size up."
4.0,"First of all, I gave these shoes a 4-Star rating because of the tan plastic heel tak. Why couldnt that be black? It totally off-sets the entire shoe. I plan on buying black ones and removing the takcy tan ones. BUT, this is a very cute shoe and its very comfortable. The heel is higher than it looks but its not too high. This is such a unique shoe and so versitile because the bow/flower is removable. The heart shaped heel is fabulous. I plan on wearing them this weekend after I remover the tan heel tak. I will most likely buy them in red and silver also. LOVE THE SHOE!!!!! The fit is true to size. I wear an 8.5 (US) and its perfect."
4.0,"I got this for a grown up. Luckily she has tiny wrists. It'll fit on bigger wrists, the thread will slide open and expand but there are only enough beads to go around a small adult wrist and not even that really well. This is a very colorful, cute and petite bracelet with a little gold star for donating a portion of the profits. I'd get it for kids or small adults only though."
4.0,I love these dark glasses. I love the color of the polarized shade. They are also very decorative for a woman. I use them all the time. Everyone has their own style preference so I would say that if you like this style than it's worth the price
4.0,I live this shirt! It’s perfect for work as I wear workout clothes to work everyday! It’s comfy and great quality
4.0,my daughter is a size 4T in everything but this fits her small.  I would order a size up.
4.0,I really like it came not a crack in it.  I purchased this because I thought it would wear well with my denim and looks great with all of my jeans and skirts.
4.0,"I love these! The rose gold color is perfect and they are very small and dainty. I ordered this package for the small ring for my septum. It is the perfect size, but it's really hard to open and close. I cannot get it closed and I've been trying for about 30 minutes. If I do ever get it closed, it will have to be cut out. In my opinion, it's definitely still worth it. Maybe just have a professional close the ring"
4.0,It's very pretty. i bought for a friend and she loves it.
4.0,"This dress is pretty and very comfortable to wear. The fabric is a midweight knit with stretch. There's a side zipper, but you can just pull the dress on. The ruffle around the top is elasticized, so it won't slip. There are pockets to make the dress even easier to wear. I added a belt for cinching. I sized up, but I could have chosen my normal size. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,Very pretty bras. The wire started poking me after a few months though. 😢
4.0,The sleeves were a tad tight around the arms. But overall so cute! My daughter loved it after I cut a small slit in the sleeve to open them up a bit.
4.0,I liked this dress but the material was a tad too thin for the specific occasion.
4.0,"I do like these socks, they feel to be around 15 mmHg, I am used to wearing 20-30's, so these are not too tight.  They are  easy to put on and off.  So far, they are doing a fine job with my legs.  I have lymphedema and venous insufficiency.  They are much easier to wear for me than my others, I can wear them for longer periods of time without any discernible difference from my other set.  So far, so good.<br /><br />Keep your toenails/fingernails trimmed and file any sharp edges, and they should stay on good shape.  Not sure why some people say they are hard to put on, I have the small size, it's easy as pie.<br /><br />After using this pair for the first week, I decided to order two more."
4.0,But nice for summer
4.0,"The pants are nice, good quality, great color.  They do run a bit short.  I'm 5'8"" and they don't come to the ankle area.  Would love to see a longer version."
4.0,Runs small. Very thin so it is see through. Cute dress.
4.0,"Kinda pinches, wish I could shorten it other wise nice"
4.0,"Nice soft material, fits well. Only four stars because the light blue is not like the picture at all. More of a turquoise"
4.0,"I loved it! Was comfy, cute design and everyone loved it! I've got many compliments! The price was perfect! The sizing however was my concern because I'm slim and petite (5'2, 120lbs) I usually wear a size 2/4 and I like my clothes to hug me, at the least my jeans....anyway, I got a small because they did not provide an XS, and according to one review I read, one girl was my size and warned that you may have to take it in, so I basically brought it with the intention of needing to take it in...she was right! So I dusted my sewing machine and took it in about 2 inches from the hip! No big deal if you sew or know someone who can hook it up for you...other than that, the story of a Shorty's life!"
4.0,"It's a very nice bracelet. Good quality and gets a lot of compliments, but...the print is so small, you have to be no more than 3 inches away in order to read it."
4.0,"Great boxy style and exactly as pictured. Like the light linen (must wear undergarment, as it's a bit sheer) which has a rustic feel, and the embroidery is a nice touch."
4.0,"Headband ears were off center and small, looked a little droopy. Was a good price though"
4.0,I thought it would be good fit but it seems like it doesn't have enough of strength
4.0,Ability to flip up is great but material to beread must be held close to face.
4.0,This is a great one. Too bad it's a bit smaller than competition. But it gives an elegant look though.
4.0,"My daughter absolutely LOVES this dress! She will have to wait to wear it for next year since the dress is at least a size larger than what will fit. She's 8 years old and I ordered the size 8. I usually have this problem though, so it's probably just her being small."
4.0,decent t shirt good price
4.0,Love this purse set.  I love the large purse because it holds everything I have without losing its shape
4.0,"A nice product for the money. Most others I have owned had a soft insole. These took a little getting used to. The insole is  a harder material, almost like tiny dots of plastic. Once you are used to this strange massage like feeling on the bottom of your feet they are quite  comfortable."
4.0,"It was a little tight for the size and the shirt was shorter then the image suggests. However, the material was pretty good quality."
4.0,"Good product, well made. Fits a little tight and short in the arms and the stomach puffs out a bit but I've never had a &#34;proper&#34; jersey so I can't tell if this is normal or not. If you have large arms it might be a bit tight but who wants all that weight up top! Don't feel it while riding and is cool enough for NJ summers."
4.0,I really love this product..  They are so comfortable and wash well. They also come in colors I like.
4.0,Un poco apretado para quienes tienen pies mas altos. Es medio strech.
4.0,Would be great if they had a pocket to insert a filter inside.<br />Other than that- exactly as  was needed.
4.0,The product was a couple sizes too small. I order a large for me and an xl for my friend . I usual wear a medium shirt sometimes a large . The xl ended up fitting me but I needed to order a xxl for my friend . Highly like the design and style . Just when you order this hoodie go a size or two what you normally would
4.0,"You can cut these into the right size to fit your feet. It has a lot of arch support, and is made from foam material. I think the only downside to these is that since they are designed to give you a good amount of cushion, and it limits what shoes you can wear them in (since they are thicker than other inserts). I've been wearing them in my running shoes and have noticed that my feet have been much happier since putting the inserts in."
4.0,Nice suit. The cups are slightly large and I'm a D cup.<br /><br />Bright colors and a nice suit
4.0,"Colorful frame<br />I love the vibrant colors and the fact that it's a woven band;  I just got it, but it seems durable.  The band is not as long as I thought and I have to wear it fastened on the second end hole.  I'm still glad I bought it."
4.0,Little snug for the size - go a size up!
4.0,As long as you keep up on keeping your boots clean and protected this product will work well.
4.0,I do like these sneakers I just wish they had better cushion padding inside. I have flat feet and these shoes need more support inside.
4.0,Great color and lots of room.  Light weight.
4.0,"This is an excellent hoodie but when the temperature falls below 45 it doesn't really insulate. It also lets strong wind through. I've had to use several layers of insulation below it to keep warm., But, at higher temperatures, it's nice and comfortable and well-made."
4.0,Made a great gag gift
4.0,I thought it would be smaller.
4.0,Not like expected.havnt worn yet
4.0,"Awesome fit!! My daughter is between 5'-5'1&#34; 90lbs, got the 4xl and SOOOOO glad I got that size. She actually has some room to grow in them length wise! Would have given 5 stars if the material was a tad bit thicker. So hoping these actually wear well because she is in soccer, track and dance so she can be rough on her stuff."
4.0,"The Curlbiuty cardigan is fantastic. It is long, stops mid-thigh. It is black with a cable knit design. There is an open collar (no closure – i.e., zipper, buttons) with traditional thick material. It fits true to size. It is warm and cozy. It is well structured and great. I love it!"
4.0,"This dress has a very nice swingy flow.  The fit is good however the fabric does not give and the bust could be tight if you are busty.  Very pretty and perfect for outdoor picnic, church or wedding."
4.0,"Parted my hair down the middle, put it some loose curls and added this piece. I received so many compliments!"
4.0,The doo rags themselves are really good. They have held up in the wash. I've bought others that were very cheap and poor quality. I would give these a 5 star but the buttons are awful! Do not use them. They will only make your head hurt. They need to be more flush or magnetic. I never even put them in because they would only hurt your head.
4.0,"The ankle bracelet is unique. It seems to have been made with care. Though, the charms appear to be too small for the rope. They do not hang as I thought they should. The picture shows the charms hanging nicely but they flip up so I am not sure if they will stay in place when worn around the ankle.<br /><br />I am updating my previous review after wearing the anklet all day. It is comfortable, and the charms settle nicely after manually pulling them down. I thought the knot securing the bracelet would come lose but it stays firmly in place."
4.0,I bought these as a gift for my dad. He loves them. He uses them so that he could listen to his books while he's sleeping and his wife doesn't have to hear.  He had tried the headbands and the pillow speakers but he found that the headbands stretched and the pillow speakers didn't really muffle the sound enough for his wife to sleep comfortably.
4.0,VerY like it
4.0,I like this shirt. The chest is a little snug when zippered up. The zipper is gold.
4.0,"Not 100% wool but a 50% blend.  Socks are thick and comfortable, but medium warmth.  They hold shape well, and color variety is nice."
4.0,"Cute top nd nice color.  The waist elastic seems tight, though."
4.0,"I bought this for my 3 and 5 yr old daughters for our trip to Florida. It worked out perfect! It was easy for them to handle and wheel through the airport. The dimensions online say it is 16&#34;tall but with the wheels and handle it's closer to 18&#34;. Wasn't an issue with us forn personal carry on measurements and fit below the seat just fine. Very spacious for size...we stuffed it full with blanket, stuffed animals, books and crayons etc, swimsuit, sandals, outfit and beach towel. I would recommend it for anyone planning to travel! Not 5 stars because I noticed a couple things after wheeling through the airport:  1. the straps got caught below the wheels a couple times and 2. there is a piece of fabric that is supposed to be able to cover the wheels or tuck under the back of the pack that fell over the wheels while in tow resulting in holes through the thin fabric cover. This happened in both backpacks so each has one hole from the wheel burning through it while being pulled through the airport. Not that big of a deal but just fyi. I would still recommend it to anyone traveling with young children!"
4.0,"These are fantastic, so comfy, so versatile. Can be dressed up or down, used for yoga or dinner out. I'm obsessed and have 5 pairs now. Heads up though, the rose gray pair is NOT gray/pink it is blue/burnt orangey-brown. I was disappointed to not get pink and gray, but the blue ones are cute too, just unexpected. Some of the stitching is a bit sloppy, but isn't noticeable considering the style. They're a steal for the price and versatility. If you're not sure, just do it, you will at the very least wear them around the house!"
4.0,Not the best quality but it will work for the price.
4.0,Love this dress! There is no stretch to the skirt but it fits true to size. The top does stretch which was nice for someone with a little more uptop than most. The buttons were a bit off center but that is an easy fix.
4.0,This mask is a lot of fun. My first box was damaged with some kind of liquid and was going to be a gift but I ended up just keeping it and purchasing a new one for the gift. That one was perfect. Cool product.
4.0,"I ordered this for my daughter for her birthday. It’s cute and the quality isn’t too bad, but the button on the bow was not in the center. It was very far to the left on the bow. I just cut it off. Otherwise the outfit seems to be an ok quality."
4.0,These Moccasins are really comfortable!
4.0,"Very pretty necklace. Lot's of options with different pendants, if the bale is very large. I felt the brass endcaps could have been cinched in a bit where it connects to the leather. Then it could've been used with a wider variety of pendants. This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Absolutely love it with enhacers though. The leather has a nice sheen to it, & it lays nicely.<br />Will be a go to necklace.<br />SWgirl"
4.0,"I was looking for a bow belt to match a dress I had for my cousin's wedding, I love this belt, it is big but not obnoxious, it fits comfortably and the bow is quite lovely. I docked it a start because the quality is not the best and I did have to re-glue parts of the bow back onto the belt portion, but for the price it was a great value!"
4.0,"This is a super thin super light jacket that keeps the wind out.  It also holds the sweat in a little more than expected, but for me I really wanted something to keep the wind out of my base layer on jogs and rides and it does just that."
4.0,"The dress fit perfect , just as expected ."
4.0,Good hat but he letters are really tiny
4.0,"Overall I love it.  The only reason that it isn't getting five stars is because once you actually start putting things into it, the thing won't stay closed."
4.0,These are great.... I only deducted a star bc I don't like the slight sheen the material has.<br />These are flattering & smooth out problem areas.
4.0,"Muy llamativos, excelente polarización"
4.0,"A little shorter than what I expected, but very comfortable."
4.0,"Amazingly pretty and flattering. I get a lot of compliments. It’s kind of see through though, so I have to wear a slip with it. Plus the slits were way too big, so I sewed them down a lot shorter. Still, it looks nice."
4.0,I'm a C cup so its a lil big up top but fits perfect on my hips.I got a size medium. I'm 5'7 157 lbs. Honestly I could have gone down a size.
4.0,Feels good and fits good. Great value. I see that the fabric pills up a little after a few washes but still looks good. I would buy again.
4.0,"This is a bit snug; fabric isn't great, but I love the pattern."
4.0,I love it! It definitely got here way faster than expected! Told me It would be here at January 22nd through February 9th but it was here way earlier. I'm definitely impressed.
4.0,I really do like these shorts. But when they get wet they tend to sag a little & have to keep adjusting. Otherwise cute & comfy.
4.0,"Update ::: I rec A new bracelet, I am thinking because of my review. I appreciate that the seller would stand behind their product. So I am Changing my review to 4 stars.<br /><br />I really Like the bracelet but the screw came out after the first wear."
4.0,"Very good quality, well-made. I was looking for something that was a little softer like an old-fashioned flannel but this is more of a finished cotton type feel.  It hasn’t been cold enough to wear it yet but I’m sure I’ll enjoy it in cooler weather. Overall, a good buy."
4.0,This is a well made bolero that fit as I expected. I take a large and bought a 16/18 based on other reviews. I bought this for a particular dress for my son's wedding and unfortunately the color did not go well with the dress so I had to return it.
4.0,"The hats are good quality and confortable. The shipping took a while but arrived within the scheduled window. The transfers (graphics on the hats) are okay. There were a couple that didn't transfer quite right so there were some blemishes at the corners. Overall, I'm pleased with the quality and price point."
4.0,"Love, love this!! Just like pictured! Love it!"
4.0,"The dress is comfortable, it fits the curves of the body, and looks sexy! I’m 5’3 and comes just below the knees. The downside is the stitching of the pocket ripped after one wash but otherwise, I really like the dress"
4.0,"while the dress fit me too tight on the top, I love the feel of the material and the dress had very unique sleeves.<br />I am returning it, but thought it was nice."
4.0,"I’m 5:4 and 135 pounds. Ordered medium. Fits ok, but little loose. Wish I ordered small. Fabrics is nice and thick."
4.0,So very cute . Btw It is only the jacket and socks u have to buy the uniform separately
4.0,"Like these earrings, just wish the stones were a little larger"
4.0,"For someone with a big behind.. they fall down a lot and they were some what short. I'm 5'7, 160lbs. Normally wear a size 8-10 pants. I got the large. Not bad, just wish they were a bit longer and didn't fall down so easilyz"
4.0,"This necklace would make a perfect gift. It is engraved saying ""Soul Sisters and Forever my Friend""."
4.0,Perfect size for an adult. A bit big for a 10 year old's costume accessory. But it worked fine and added the finishing touch. There are 3 snaps to choose from and we had it on the smallest. But definitely cute.
4.0,Very good. Am Happy
4.0,Loose fit and the color was pretty. I bought a large.
4.0,"These seem to run very small and are quite narrow. They are very cute and my daughter loves them. They’re incredibly glittery and are perfect for the little Princess. Once we got a size up, they fit her great. She owns these in several other colors as well. Love them!"
4.0,Love the material. I’m short and petite so I had to hem it some but it was perfect fit my event!!
4.0,They're a bit noisy! But look great and are comfortable.
4.0,"This mask is definitely creepy. My children are terrified of it. My mask arrived a bit misshapen from being in the bag, but it looks fine when you put it on. It's a good size for most adult heads, I would guess. I'm a 6'2"" 180lbs man and it fits me well with a little extra room inside. I'd expect it would fit people with larger heads as well. It's easy enought to slip on and off, as the back side has a slit opening. The strangest part is that the eye holes are slightly above the eyes that are painted on, and it looks really strange if you notice them. But the average person probably will not see the eye holes because the mask is so scary looking.<br /><br />It's a relatively thin, rubbery material and feels sturdy enough, but you get what you pay for. It could probably rip if it got caught on something, but I'm not going to try it. If you wear it for a long time, you're almost certainly going to get sweaty since there is no real ventilation. I expect I won't wear it for more than a few minutes at a time though. I like it and will have fun scaring my friends with it. 4 stars."
4.0,It's pretty but it's really tiny.I
4.0,Smaller than expected. Beautiful
4.0,"I'm 5'4"", 36DDD, 170lbs and the medium fit perfect. The material is definitely not the same as what's pictured. It's a sheer material but the bottom is double lined so it not a big issue. The color is beautiful and decent quality for the price. I knocked one star because the warm hole is pretty tight around my arms so it's just a little uncomfortable around that part."
4.0,These were more of a blue and not grey. Won’t work for what I wanted it for.
4.0,Glasses delivered quickly and they are comfortable to wear.
4.0,Cute... a little tight in the chest area but otherwise comfy!
4.0,If you have chubby wrists like mean I wouldn’t recommend it because it is a bit tight and sometimes could cut your circulation
4.0,Don’t listen to other reviews about this shirt running small. It does not. Order your usual size.
4.0,"This is a cute summer dress for the price. First thing I noticed when I put it on was that the seam was not finished which I’m concerned after washing may come undone. Just going to keep it because it was cheap and not worth sending back. I guess you get what you pay for! As for the fit, it fits very well so I would order your normal dress size. I am 5/6 and 120 pounds and got a small. I’m flat chested so I did not fill in the top part and may wear a Cami underneath due it being lower cut."
4.0,This sweater is cute!<br />I love the colors.<br />I normally wear a Medium but got an XL because that’s all that was available at the time!<br />I’m not unhappy with the oversized feel.<br />The knit is a little looser on the off white stripes than I would like.<br />I’m 5’5” 34C and143lbs for reference.
4.0,"Sadly we had to return this as it was a little low cut for my 15 year old daughter.  Fit was fine, a little long, as she is 5' 8"" and she would have had to alter it if we would have kept it."
4.0,Pretty!  Looks just like the picture.
4.0,This bag is well made sturdy I would have like just a little bigger will last a life time
4.0,Not as soft as expected but comfortable. Not too heavy and not see through thin.
4.0,"is exactly like the photos, i like them. they were a gift for my bf. only wish it came in white too. that was why i didn't rate it a 5 star"
4.0,I love the material my measurements are.  38 30 46 I order a small I feel the shirt is a little small the skirt fit great Overall it still looks great I want more colors
4.0,"I love this swimsuit!  I wish the material were a bit thicker and the straps are a bit large on me (I just cross them in the back instead....), but I am really happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Great quality.  It's a nice, sturdy jacket just as it appears to be.<br /><br />In case you are wondering &#34;do those flaps over the pockets cover additional pockets?&#34; (like I was) the answer is &#34;nope&#34;.  They don't.  I think they should because it would make this the perfect cargo vest for people who like girly camouflage stuff (like me) and need lots of room to carry stuff.  The 2 pockets are roomy, but a girl needs storage space!<br /><br />So, throw some more pockets on this baby and it's the best vest ever.  As of now, it's pretty cute as is."
4.0,I like that it’s adjustable. Buckle is a bit heavy and bulky. Otherwise I’d give it 5 stars.
4.0,Easy to throw on. Very cute. It is very thin fabric thus a little see through. Perfect for the beach or pool.
4.0,"Was pleasantly surprised how much i liked these leggings. Super lightweight, comfortable stretchy fit! Doesnt show cellulite and feels amazing in the water for a surf. I was even surprised they didn't hold onto my boardwax as much as they should, so not much of a waxy butt. Almost feels like I&#34;m wearing nothing. Will have to see how they hold up, but after one session on the waves, I like it."
4.0,"Beautiful watch but it was too small for my taste, I like a larger chunkier watch"
4.0,"The Backpack is amazing! Quality and durability is astonishing. The chest and belt clip straps help keep it in place which is great for whether you are traveling, hiking, daily uses, etc. I'm able to fit my laptop in the back compartment and its nice that they already have a built in strap for it. Now for the cons, Maybe this is just for me, there's a lot of loose straps just dangling around and  you can't roll them and keep it in place because there's nothing to hold it and last but not least it seemed very SLIGHTLY smaller than what I expected, but that doesn't bother me as much. Overall, Very high quality tactical backpack, price is worth it compare to all those other expensive tactical backpacks you see out there, exquisite appearance, quality inside of the compartments when you open, and I recommend it!"
4.0,"Great fit, a size larger than what I usually get."
4.0,really good quality but no coin holder
4.0,Polishes silver jewelry beautifully.
4.0,Super comfortable and great shirt. Shorter then I wanted but still love it.
4.0,It’s a cute shirt but the sizing is way off. I normally wear a large- and I sized up to a 2xl- it fits me like medium would. I’ll probably gift it to a friend with a smaller frame.
4.0,"Gift for my partner. Super solid, seems very durable. Aesthetically appealing! I took off half a star because some of the borders surrounding the band are very sharp and a bit rough. Also, the opening of the band was pretty wide and we had to bend it to be smaller. Another half star came off because the Roman numerals were much smaller than anticipated from the pictures. But all in all I’m pleased with this purchase. My partner is very rough on his jewelry, and I have no doubt that this will stand up to his abuse."
4.0,"Color wasn't as dark as the photo.  Its closer to a mint green or aqua.  Which I already have 2 other shirts like that color but oh well.  Fits fine, I bought a Medium.  Not too tight or too big, but I probably should've bought a large for it to be blousier.  Good length.  Thought it was thicker material but its a long sleeved t-shirt."
4.0,"This bag has classic lines, nice silver tone hardware. I purchased this bag for business travel, work and play.  This is a large bag. The great thing about this bag is the well made top zipper.  I wanted a bag that was like a tote, but had a large zipper for privacy. I found it in this bag.  The one thing the manufacturers could have done was to have a back side zipped pocket.  The outside pocket would allow easy access to your plane ticket, keys, sunglasses or other things need in an instant when traveling or shopping.  Otherwise great bag.<br /><br /> Dimensions (approx.): 17 (L at Bottom) x 12 (H) x 8 (D) in<br /><br />*Black leather.<br /> *Black leather trim.<br /> *Leather top handles with silver tone rings (approx. 8 inch drop).<br />*Michael Kors buckled logo plate at top center.<br /> *Full top zip closure.<br />*Signature lined interior.<br />*Interior: one leather trimmed zipper pocket, four leather trimmed open pockets.<br />*Four protective metal feet on bottom."
4.0,I loved them a lot but I didn’t expect them to be made out of a fabric that wasn’t breathable. They arrived quickly. They are long enough for my 5’8 height.
4.0,really great material vibrant colors and good fit
4.0,Runs a little bit small but is soft and comfortable
4.0,"I like these for the purpose they serve, especially if wearing a mask for any length of time in the South!  Being  blinded by sweat is annoying and painful. However, they have a tendency to slip backward on my head and are troublesome when wearing glasses."
4.0,"The only reason I didn't give this band 5 stars is because the clasp is a bit sloppy; not crisp. I bought a white faced silver Accurist watch in London, that had a stiff leather band. I wanted a silver mesh band.  But then again, what do you want for under $20? I have a Breitling with a mesh band and it goes for thousands. This one fits great and looks great! Buy it!!"
4.0,Cute but a little small
4.0,Karate party for kids  They were good
4.0,I love the fit of this dress. Will have to hem. The color was not as expected. It is more wine than red. Disappointed but not a deal breaker. I would recommend to my friends.
4.0,"I love the colors and the fit of this dress, but it is a bit too short in the front for my liking. But with a skirt extender, it's perfect."
4.0,My wife used this as part of a vampire Halloween costume. Great fit and comfortable.
4.0,"Material on this dress is great. Nothing fancy but perfect for summer weather & those hot sticky summer days. I ordered another one rt when I got this style but I noticed that the other styles don't have the same material. Scratching my head* eh, I guess two in my summer wardrobe is enough."
4.0,"great, the shoulder pad was not as comfortable as I hoped."
4.0,"This coat was very nice and seemed to be put together very well.  I gave it to my neice and she loves it!  She hasn't worn it much yet, so too soon to tell if the quality will hold out."
4.0,Nice- but bigger than expected
4.0,"Pros:  Super cute!  Comfy.<br />Cons:  Run small, order 1/2 - 1 size larger if you want to wear socks.  It fits snug w/stockings."
4.0,"Fits perfectly, good quality."
4.0,"My 9 year old loves the watch! She hoped there were more features, such as calling, better camera and a continuously active step counter. She also wanted to be able to use the photos taken on the watch as her wallpaper.<br /><br />I didn't like that the homescreen wallpapers were so distracting, they compete with the font used for time and date. It's a cool watch tho! I like it."
4.0,Not great idea for women with big chest.
4.0,Nice look and feel.
4.0,Was exactly what I needed... but alas too small have to return for larger size...
4.0,"Only thing I don’t like about the the watch is the light. Only brights up a corner so you Have to hold the watching at an extremely awkward angle to read it and it’s still not great. But other then then that, I love it."
4.0,They fit a little snug and are not too short but just barley long enough.
4.0,"very durable, and easy to install."
4.0,My husband loves these pajamas but they are too baggy in the legs. I worry that going a size smaller would be too tight in the arms.
4.0,this is a sturdy piece of jewelry. just as it looks here.
4.0,These can come bent up and broken. But when they are packaged right they are very nice. I have ordered this product several times.  When they work -they work! When they dont- they dont. It's kinda a crap shoot. One plus: when I send them back I am always refunded.
4.0,"Very cute... looks great on... the chain portion is very delicate, I broke the chain just taking the plastic off. I was able to fix it, I’m hoping it lasts and doesn’t turn colors or break. For the price you can’t beat it."
4.0,"I bought it not knowing the reviews.  Read the reviews later.  I like it.  I like that the time doesn't stay on, that you have to push the button to see the time.  However, I wish when you do press to see the time, I wish it just came on, not some digital thing to come on.  The numbers are big.  I like that it is black and silicone.  It would be great to have the color of time different colors like white or blue numbers. Concern how to change the battery when that time comes."
4.0,I really like the color of this swim suit cover up and it is a light weight material as well. I live in Arizona so it is always swim suit season here and I look for cute covers all the time. This swim suit cover is like a warp around dress so you put it on like a towel but it has straps for your arms to go through. This dress fits a little tight for me I have larger breast and it fits snug in that area. I'm a med/large size in clothing and the dress still flows. It is a little shorted than knee length on me. In the pictures the back droops very low but it is a little higher on me.<br /><br />This product was sold at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased t review
4.0,Loved this simple nighty for the summer.  Simple but cool.  Got the bigger size and had plenty of room.  However went back to get another and the bigger size had disappeared.
4.0,MY lady love it!
4.0,"Product is very easy to set up and use. Seems to hold purses well (even though some of my purses weigh about a pound because of extra lotion, etc. still in them). The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's a little clunky due to it just hanging on the door. The only fasteners are at the top and bottom of the door. Other than that it's just hanging there. I should have realized that when I purchased it. But it is nevertheless a great product! I am very pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"If I can find a remedy for the static, I'm sure this is a great robe"
4.0,"This is an adorable dress, and the tie front adds a lot I think! Super cute, good length, true to size. It's just not warm, and really shouldn't be classified as a sweater dress. The material is thicker than your average dress, but it's not sweater material."
4.0,"They work well, though I expected the cir ar bands to be thicker. Also some of the caribbeaners dont work as well as others. Overall, though, I am satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"The shirt was a little small for the size that I ordered.  It had a bit of stretch to it.  And I was hoping that it would hang more loosely.  But the design was so cute that I kept it anyway!  The stripes on the sleeve are navy blue, not black."
4.0,Nice glasses I love how this looks
4.0,Very cute and adorable. When you want a little something fun!
4.0,Very cute and simple! Doesn't look exactly like the picture but I've gotten so many complements on it
4.0,It’s super cute on me.
4.0,"I like this watch face for sure. Nice luxury looking wood. From afar, the watch bad is great. Love the contrast stitching. However, the quality of the leather in the watch band leaves a bit to be desired. Then again, this watch is very well-priced. As someone who frequently changes watches to match my look, price makes a difference and this watch works at this price-point."
4.0,It's cute ! 5'9&#34; 145 Fits great ! It is see through ..
4.0,"The material is very comfortable.  It is stretchy and breathable, just right for the warmer weather."
4.0,"The neck and shoulders seem a little awkwardly sewn, meaning I found myself pulling in down around the breast area as it had a tendency to rise.."
4.0,"Before I ordered I always read at least 25 or so reviews, you just never know and I will say the majority were very accurate.  so I will start with delivery.  I received it on time and the packaging that was mentioned in the majority of the reviews were very accurate,  they do take pride in packaging which is a great part to the over all presentation.  I was very impressed on the size and what this little purse actually holds.  I transferred what was in my shoulder back and it all fit.  I even have a portable charger that is not huge but not sleek either but fit great and did not add bulk.  The purse is very soft and not cheesy looking.  I really hate purses that are not actually real leather and are stiff.  I love how there is one zipper on top that opens up to the three open compartments inside.  There is actually 5 if you consider extra slots to keep say receipts or extra cc or gum so that does make it very nice. People were also commenting on the smell.  There  is a smell to it that is to me not natural leather but still not bad like some people had commented.  I do want to say the one thing I am not very happy with is the color that is why I am only giving 4 stars.  In going through the reviews before I purchased I was trying to get a read on how the color's were once they received the purse but could only find 1 comment on the purple one.  I will say that I ordered the brown/tan thinking summer is coming and that is a great neutral color for summer.  I was less than impressed.  In the light it is more of a burnt orange not brown.  I have had a purse in that color before and it is a good color but still not what I was expecting but would not return because I do love everything else about it and it's not so bad that I just would refuse to use it.  I really would recommend this purse to others.  Sorry for the ramble but hope this helps."
4.0,"We love the colors! They are just cheap summer sunglasses, but perfect for my 11 year old. She loves to coordinate the colors with her outfits. They are not so cheap feeling that they will fall apart just wearing them. They are perfect for a preteen girl in summer, or a summer party gift for kids.<br />*The ones we ordered were adult sized not child sized. Which worked for our daughter."
4.0,Fits snug but not tight. The material is nice and soft. It would be great for exercising. The only issue I have is that the arm length is a bit small. I have long arms and this barely reaches my wrist. I feel if it even shrunk at all it would no longer fit as a long sleeve shirt. Other than that though it is exactly as I expected.
4.0,I ordered XL base on the reviews comments but it was a  little to big . Large probably was better for me. Im 36 D bra and I use  L or XL top. Over all is a nice dress!
4.0,Its really soft and cute but a smidgen to small.
4.0,Love the fabric and the top. Perfect for any body type.
4.0,Beautiful ties!!!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 is because the gift box came to me crushed and if I was giving as a give(instead of to my husband) I would not be happy. They ties themselve are really gorgeous. They are nicely made out of fabulous material. Other than the gift box they would make a great gift!
4.0,Was a little snug but overall really cute and nice thin airy material
4.0,Fit is good and HeadBand doesn't slip.
4.0,Love the colors. But still fit too tight
4.0,I love my new bathrobe.  Fits good.  Would buy again.
4.0,I really liked how this dress fit but for winter I felt the fabric was too lightweight.
4.0,Shoes is great just bigger than my son's feet!
4.0,"Very cute... once you shake all of the access black stuff off of it, I took it out of the bag and black stuff fell all over my bed. I ordered the green shirt, so I am not sure what all the pieces were from but I had to vacuum it all up from my carpet."
4.0,Very comfortable & just a bit dressier then tossing on a t-shirt over leggings. I do recommend wearing over a tank top if very modest as the neckline is large & does like to slip off a shoulder.
4.0,Very nice jeans. a little big in the waist but wearable.
4.0,Cute shirt but after one wash the threads started to come undone at the bottom.
4.0,"It's a nice umbrella, but note that it does not come with a base.  That is sold separately.<br /><br />Also, the mechanism that opens the umbrella didn't work at first; the hole it was in was not properly ""punched"" and it got stuck and wouldn't move. It took me a while to fix it, but I was able to get it working.<br /><br />Now that it's installed, the umbrella itself looks and works great. We've been pleased with it so far.<br /><br />Also, the customer service provided by the company has been excellent."
4.0,"the leather reeks, but its a great wristlet"
4.0,I have not been able to wear this I will do it soon but looks very nice and light
4.0,I bought this in brown last year (size L) and it ran small & short even on my 5'2&#34; body! but I liked it for going out. So I ordered it in blue (size L again) and it's a completely different fabric and runs large! So this one is appropriate for work at least. Can't beat the price for fun summer dresses.
4.0,This was a nice  shirt but it fit somewhat tight/snug on my husband;  and he's on the slim side.<br />Unfortunately; I had to return it... I ordered similar other products instead.
4.0,Nice style.  Runs tight/small.  Returning shirt.
4.0,They are not bulky at all and I could probably sleep in them.
4.0,"Comfy and looks great. My only issue was that it comes with a funny smell that took *several* washes over a period of weeks to get out. If you don't mind the washes, it could be the staple in your wardrobe that it is in mine."
4.0,"They are so cute. Would have given this a five star but the packaging could have been a bit better. They weren’t in its own box, just a plastic bag, with nothing to clean them with."
4.0,nice product but one of the ball screws stripped in tightening it on the bracelet. But since it was going to be a permanent bracelet design I just industrial cemented it in place. Other that that issue I think its a good product...the other bracelet was fine.
4.0,"Waited 30 days to receive it tho thats earlier than given estimated date. As i open the package, the stone design isn't glued on the ring. Fixed it with hot glue gun since that what they used. Still gave it 4 star since it is really cute. Haven't worn yet so it could break again when i do."
4.0,Muy suaves y cómodos para los bebes
4.0,Nice bracelet for the price. My 11 year old niece loved it. Quick delivery.
4.0,These came in the colors as advertised and feel really soft. I haven't had time to try them as yet so I will update this review when I do
4.0,Strong sturdy belt.
4.0,"I was really ok with this item, nice product just too small, if I decide to order again it will be a larger purse. Very well made will say beautiful."
4.0,"I love the color of this shirt! However I think the length in the picture is a little misleading (or I have a weirdly long torso), and I find the slits on the side of the shirt are closer to the waistband of my jeans (rather than the pocket of the jeans in the picture). The shirt is a thinner material, but not see through, but I do still wear a tank top underneath.I think it fit as expected and the color hasn't faded, even after several washes."
4.0,Got what I was expecting :)
4.0,Metal buckles made me nervous to have around my new git fiddle. Returned. Otherwise a good looking sturdy strap.
4.0,"The material isn’t what I expected, I thought it would be thicker, but it served its purpose and thick enough that you can’t see through it. You really have to accessorize this outfit or it will look a little bland. Gave all the clueless, Barbie, 1990s vibes."
4.0,"This bag really serves the purpose I wanted it for: a solid everyday-use bag that's durable and can fit my tablet, which I carry everywhere.<br /><br />My only real critiques are that the zippers are a cheap plastic and are very loud to zip/unzip, and I dislike the two top straps. Those straps are very big and pretty unnecessary and kind of just get in the way. Would be great if they were removable."
4.0,This is going to be a gift for my mother on her birthday and I am sure she will enjoy it!
4.0,"The fit was perfect. Comfortable, rarely take them off...."
4.0,"I bought a small which is my usual size, but this outfit seems to fit more like Medium. Little baggy, but still super comfy and cute"
4.0,"Love the design. Very minimalist, clean lines, stylish.<br /><br />Only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because the rotation isn’t as silent as I’d hoped. It does a very slight clicking sound with each rotation. Definitely not loud by any means but enough to notice and that I don’t run it at night when sleeping."
4.0,Long tuck under
4.0,"They're kind of hard to clip/unclip, but as long as you have someone else that can do it for you, they work fine! Cute chokers. Love having a variety of colors."
4.0,"Like them, stayed in"
4.0,Very dainty.  Excellent for tweens/teens.
4.0,This is one creepy looking mask. I wore it while answering the door for my bf during the day and he was disturbed. Not as disturbed as I was answering the door to him at night and seeing the mask. Came close to screaming. For a cardboard mask it's pretty lifelike. Can't wait to terrorize the kids! 😉
4.0,but still very nice.
4.0,I like it! I have big calves so it was tight in that area. I had to cut off some areas to fit comfortably
4.0,"To start, the item is as advertised and is a great deal. However, you have to be mindful of the price. The quality is not top of the line obviously but it’s also not flimsy. This is a great buy to just get sunglasses that you can use and leave anywhere such as in your car, home, or any place you’d need them. In terms of reliability not the highest but they do what they are advertised to do and the price to quality ratio is fair. all in all, a good deal. You get what you pay for."
4.0,Gteat priced ring.  $199 @ a major jeweler for the same ring.  Not sure if I was sized wrong initially or if theses run a half size larger.
4.0,Very soft and warm. Length a little shorter than expected but still worked out ok.
4.0,I purchased this mask (along with a few others) for a Mardi Gras themed party. There was nothing wrong with this mask. It was surprisingly light weight and comfortable enough to wear! I just ended up liking some of the other masks I ordered better. So I ended up retuning this one.
4.0,Little small but nice shirt. I like it. Would never reorder it.
4.0,Bien hasta ahora
4.0,"Material is thick, like a blanket.  So it doesn't lay down well. Took a few wears and washes for it to stop sticking out on the sides. I wanted something warm, which it is. Overall,  very nice product."
4.0,Too tight. Nice fabric.
4.0,"Definelty meant for small to medium faces I'm 6'2"" 235 lbs and wear a 7 7/8 hat."
4.0,Rubber flexy like. Comfortable but eye holes will need modding
4.0,"Nice color but very cheaply made which I should've expect considering the cost of the wallet so that is why I gave it a 3. However, I still think for the $ I could've purchased something better.<br /><br />Update: 8.25.17<br />I actually love this wallet. While it isn't super high quality, it had lasted me and has shown no sign of breakdown. Great purchase!"
4.0,"This is a nice coat, with the one exception of it arriving with a small tear in the front. I think it's because of the fairly thin material used for the shell, but it's what I wanted/was looking for in a winter coat and I'm willing to repair this tiny flaw..."
4.0,"A little smaller than I thought, but good glasses."
4.0,Very comfortable to wear daily and to sleep in. They have yet too loose their color or tarnish.
4.0,This is a great swimsuit cover up. Wouldn't just use it as a dress. It is swimsuit like material so it will dry quick when wet from your suit. Runs large!
4.0,"It was ok in appearance, the bottom portion flared to much for my liking."
4.0,Birthday hats are cute.
4.0,"As other reviewers have stated, the pockets on the dress flare out and on me it looked like little cones sticking out. I feel like the only way to avoid this would be by sizing up because if you have wide hips like me you will get that weird flare. Other than that the dress and color and great. Thi her material and it washes well. I tied it at he bottom for a more stylish look and wore it with flip flops during summer and I have paired it with some<br />Ankle booties and a scarf for fall."
4.0,Nice and soft fits a bit over size but perfect I'll be getting more in different colors soon
4.0,I really like this pendant necklace. Nice size pendant. I actually wear it with two other chains.
4.0,"While this bag is definitely an eye-catcher - it is quite large and durable!  A great all-around bag for beach fun, running to the gym, or any such occasion!"
4.0,I have bought alot of leggings depot legggings. I gave it 4 stars because these were thin and haven't held up quite as well as the others. I guess it is because they are cotton.
4.0,"I normally wear a medium in leggings, so that's what I ordered.  They fit just right."
4.0,"Love it, but a little thinner than I expected."
4.0,Shoe is made of good material but it runs a little small. I’d order a size up just in case.
4.0,Cute shoes. My daughters say they are comfortable and will be perfect for camp - however they do run small. Size up a size! One kid is between a 12-13 and the other a 2-3. I ordered a 12.5 and 2.5 originally and had to return and order a 13.5 and 3.5. They are fine width wise (my kids have wide feet) but ran small in the length.
4.0,"Affordable, soulless Quartz watch. The light is a little silly, works well but only lights up from left side. Classic 1980s vibe, comfortable, sexy."
4.0,"Great looking watch. The smaller dials and side buttons dont work and are just for show, but I knew that already. And for $20 bucks it makes me look like I actually have money to spend"
4.0,Runs a little small. I got a 2XL bc I wanted it oversized and usually wear a L/XL. I ended up keeping it but when I zip it. It rises up bc of the elastic at the bottom. Material is ok. Kind of see through if you hold it up to light.
4.0,"I wanted to love these filigree heart charms. Instead, I like them. * sighs * They're very pretty. The color is a subtle rose gold and it's bright and shiny. The problem is the same as with so many mass-produced charms. Inside the loops, the excess material hasn't been cleaned out.<br /><br />I have used hundreds, if not thousands of charms just like this filigree heart style over the years. I've had them in silver, gold, and bronze. I was so excited to find rose gold (especially at this price!) and I am totally happy with the color. But the super low price makes more sense when you consider how they have-not been finished very well.<br /><br />When the loops are left gunked up and rough inside, it not only makes the charms look cheap when you notice it, it also makes them hard to work with. I string mine on ribbon. When I get to that point, it's going to be a nightmare. I'll either have to use one of my micro jewelry files to file down the inside of each loop one at a time, or else they will chew up my ribbon when I try to slide it through.<br /><br />Overall, they're pretty enough, but could be finished a whole lot better."
4.0,"very nice, will use it soon"
4.0,The shirt fits very nicely. It was a tad small in the sleeves but I pull my sleeves up most of the time anyway. It is nice for the price!
4.0,Didn't like the way it looked.
4.0,"This is very pretty, looks good with the pendant I had bought it for."
4.0,"So far so good. I have mostly skinny ties so the bars run the length of the tie, the more old fashioned thicker ties still leave some space so its just a personal preference how you like it to look."
4.0,"These compression socks fit fantastic. They are not difficult to get on, which is something I usually struggle with, they have a little more 'give' in the stretch department.<br />The prints are woven in and look as good as the picture.<br />They are comfortable and I like the variegated compression, my legs and foot don't feel like they were held too tight by the end of the day, they feel really good.<br />Comfortable and compressed without feeling squashed. I will be seeking out more from this brand/company!"
4.0,"Ring is in great condition, one small indent near the kanji but besides that it looks very nice. The only thing I would say is different is that the ring itself is not as dark as the picture describes. The picture looks like a deep plum color, however it's almost a pastel purple. Another thing to know is that other rings that I have bought are able to be adjusted-with enough force-this one is not. It seems to have been welded to ensure that it could not be bent. I will be gluing a small strip of fabric around the inside so that the ring does not slide off my finger, still gets a 4-star for quick delivery and a good quality ring."
4.0,"I bought this shirt originally for a man who is normally a 2x. It is a little small and fits more like an XL. If you are a 2x male, probably should get a 3x."
4.0,"Super comfy, super cute, fits as expected"
4.0,"Very nice looking, good strong clasp."
4.0,Really cute but the only thing I would do different on these is to have a claw clip on the chain instead of a drawstring effect for choosing the lenth of the neckelace
4.0,"I bought this tie as a gift for a friend, and it is about on par with my expectations. It's an $8 tie, it's not going to be super luxurious quality or material. But for the price, this tie is quite nice.<br /><br />It looks as it does in the picture. The floral pattern is fun and trendy, and the tie is on the skinny side. The colors are not extremely vibrant, but again, this shows in the product picture. The material is kind of thin and scratchy, but it's not too thin. I have bought several items of clothing on Amazon that were much thinner and worse in quality.<br /><br />I bought this for a friend that loves to wear floral clothes, he's a bit quirky and this was right up his ally. He absolutely loves the gift and has worn it several times when we go to the clubs.<br /><br />Overall it's a great gift, and it's of decent quality. I didn't really expect too much when I bought it, it is after all an $8 tie. But I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. I don't think it will hold up forever, but it's also not an article that is meant to be worn daily. So overall, it's decent for the price and it's a fun addition to any trendy guys wardrobe!"
4.0,Love it! Ordering another one a size smaller. Runs very large.
4.0,Beautiful dress! Great length as it sits just about a half inch above the floor (I'm 5'7&#34;). Figure flattering and comfortable! Fabric is a bit shiny and a little clingy but no other complaints!
4.0,"i like these a lot, but they are a lot bigger than i thought they were going to be so i gave them to my boyfriend. Good quality and packaging and looks just like in the picture. thanks a lot!"
4.0,The kit was easy to use overall I had the most “issues” with the size of the oval. The sticky part was easier to put on with tweezers. They came out great!
4.0,"This is cute. The colors are more of a muted orange, grey and coral color rather than pink and blue tones. It is lightweight and fashionable."
4.0,"Great with leggings, layers nicely. Good Material.  Well Made"
4.0,"Very good quality! Very roomy holds all my things, very well!"
4.0,I like the look of the shoe and how it fits but it is very flimsy and the mesh main part of the shoe is see through. When I wear striped socks you can practically see the entire sock pattern. But they are comfortable and breathable.
4.0,"I bought this badge to go with a western card game (Bang!) because the one it came with was flimsy and plastic.  It's great.  The star is about the size of the palm of my hand, it's heavy, it's bright brass and shiny, and it features a built-in pin on the back.  Unfortunately, the pin is safety-pin style, but without the guard that keeps the pointed end from poking you (so it may not be great for kids), and the pin part is actually so thick that I would not want to pin it through good clothes for fear that it would leave a hole.  That's a slight problem for me, since I purchased it to use during a game, and not as a costume item to be pinned to one specific shirt.  Overall, though, I'm happy, and I'll find another way to pin it without damage.<br /><br />Side note: I also purchased this Sheriff badge from the same seller:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00268ZSL0 B00268ZSL0]]<br /><br />They are the same size, color, weight, and style - though the picture makes them look different.  The Sheriff badge is much closer to the bright brass color shown in the Deputy badge picture."
4.0,"Very pretty, worn it once and one of the main jewels has gone missing."
4.0,Love the fit of the bottoms. Not crazy anout the top. Bought a couple others to have variety.
4.0,Beautiful!!! Can't wait to wear it
4.0,I was surprised at the quality of this bracelet. Dainty and pretty. And practically free!
4.0,"Sunglasses were very comfortable, great for driving.  The only complaint is that they are a little large, but no to large that I wouldn't wear them."
4.0,Loved it bling but it only lasted a month if that. Peel off quickly. Tried to reglue but didn't work. Peeled it all off and just use it as a black band.
4.0,They’re a good product for the price point.
4.0,"I really like this little clip on lamp.  It is bright, not too big, not too small.  It can be angled and positioned.  However, the staying power of the positioning is weak.  In my case it doesn't matter, I have it coiled around a toilet paper core.  But it won't stay on it's own if for instance it is angled up and at an arch, so for some others this product might not work.  Regardless, I am glad I bought it and it's perfect for me."
4.0,A bit tight around the bottom/leg area. Very cute!!!
4.0,very comfortable looks like the picture and washes great
4.0,"Was great at first, some days I still get Post tib pain after a few months."
4.0,Soooo soft.
4.0,"The suit is cute, and the colors are very vibrant. The shorts fit well and do not create a muffin top with too tight elastic. I do wish the top had a tighter area under the cups so that it felt more secure. Otherwise it's a nice suit that seems to be good quality. I ordered a 3xl- I am 5'7&#34; 193 lbs and wear a 38C bra. Probably could have worn a 2xl, but this size fits comfortably for now."
4.0,Just as described perfect chakra band
4.0,"I love the dress but I wear a size medium and ordered a xl and was still snug on the bust.The matrial is light and airy and the pattern is beautiful but the sewing is not 100%.<br />However,it is still worth the money."
4.0,"I’m 5’0” and this dress is perfect in length! I’d give 5 stars, but it’s a tiny bit thin. Not so bad I need a slip, but could be a bit thicker material. I get compliments all day when wearing it!"
4.0,Perfect just thin material
4.0,Worked just fine during my turkey hunt.
4.0,Just a little too small. I should have bought one larger to see it better but it's cute.
4.0,I love this look!
4.0,This top is very cute but it's a little shorter than I'd like.  One of those shirts you'd constantly be pulling at.
4.0,"I bought this for our daughter who just turned nine, We have multiple gators, however they all have to be adjusted to fit her because she is little. I thought this might work better. I think a child under 5 they would be great, however depending on the child's size, anyone older it will be to tight, and then become to thin."
4.0,"These are my favorite pants to waste to the gym, just don't run in them, they fall down."
4.0,"Nice, but a little smaller than expected"
4.0,"I love this shirt.  It's beautiful.  I got the Red XL...everything was great about it...color, size, flowy, not tight, length was great, but looks soooo frumpy on me  :(.  The fit was just too weird.  It was not what I expected it to look like, but it is a beautiful top and the colors are great...just didn't look good on me.<br />XL, 160+, 5'1""  (short and stout)  for reference."
4.0,"Very cute, but you can't really tell its an Eiffel Tower it just looks like the letter A with a rose below it. I've had it for a few months now and still hasn't broken and no Gems have fallen out."
4.0,"I was surprised by how nice this is - it is not lined, so you can tell that from the fabric at the bottom of the dress, but the size small fits nicely (5'5 130 lbs) and is flattering. I pulled the straps almost all the way tight though to fit it better. The top is a little big (extra fabric) but it looks like part of the design. Would buy again!"
4.0,"Other than a few loose threads here and there, this is a quality vest. I found the fabric to have a surprisingly nice feel to it, and it's just the right amount of thickness, not thin like cheap costume vests. The subtle pattern makes the vest a very complex and versatile piece of any dapper man's wardrobe, and I have found it to be one that I reach for often.<br /><br />I will note that these vests seem to target more of a slender frame, so if you have a large stomach you may want to order up a couple sizes and look to a tailor to bring it in where needed.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5'6' at 135 lbs, and I ordered the xxs, which fits like a glove."
4.0,Holds up well and is super pretty although not very long at all
4.0,very cute. Would like them better if they were a little larger.
4.0,It was a bit too big for our 3 month old but still worked. Exactly like picture shown
4.0,It worked pretty good.  Didn't work well on a wall or on metal.  My daughter liked it and will keep it.
4.0,"This was well made and comfy, but too big for me. Anyone with a 30&#34; or lower band size shouldn't buy this unless they come out with an XS."
4.0,These look exactly like the pictures. They tend to break easily but mostly it is not really an issue.
4.0,Love this so far
4.0,Great quality and the hat is super warm. The hat has fleece inside.
4.0,I love the belts. Except for the fact they have stunk up my entire bedroom. They are in a draw with other belts and I couldn't believe how much they have stunk up the bed room. It's a good sized room too.
4.0,Love them 😍😍😍😍
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:73ec5d76ec24b4872cf997885f5ca0e]] Final Decision:<br />I decided to return the dress....too much to alter it and while I think the dress is really pretty, it doesn't feel quite right on me. I do hope my review helped regardless!<br /> Update: After reading the other reviews I think 2 things happened:<br />1. The company/designer decided to sew in a slip that covers the front of you all the way down to just above your knees - I think this because I saw another reviewer show this dress and it had no slip in it.<br />2. Customers were complaining about there not being enough room for our &#34;ladies&#34; and unless you're flat chested - the top of this dress doesn't cover you - maybe that's why they now have extra material up front?<br />All I know if I probably would have prefered the older version of no slip and a tighter top up front. I'm still on the fence about this dress.  I'll update you if I keep it or end up altering it.<br />:-)<br />4/13/18<br />Okay, so I posted a video and some photos below. I got a good deal on the dress (it was on sale at the time, now the prices have gone up) so I may just take it to a seamstress and have it altered.<br />Things I would like altered:<br />Shorten the dress preferrably all the way around because I like the uneven hem line with it shorter in the front and longer in the back<br />Tighten the fabric around the breast area so it fits more smoothly on top - right now there is too much material<br />Perhaps even take out the slip that comes with the dress for a slimmer fit<br />I'll see how much money I want to invest in it.<br />What I DO like about the dress is the pattern on the dress is beautiful, the style of the dress - similar to a kimono is very nice and the flow of the dress is quite pretty.<br />For reference I am 5'4, 110 lbs and the dress is a bit too long on me - but I do have a long torso, shorter legs and am a slight pear shape. Overall, I like the dress, just not sure I will invest in it, by altering it or return it. I'll update what I decide :-)"
4.0,These lounge pants are nice and soft and fit great. They are a soft cotton and feel good on the skin. They wash well and are very comfortable.
4.0,"After reading other reviews, I ordered up a size (my daughter is usually a small or medium). The sleeves are still too short, as expected, but the length of the coat and fit thru the body are fine.  Definitely cut for a very petite frame!"
4.0,The only real disappointment here is that the elastic for the ears breaks very easily. They are still very cute and very functional they just don't last very long with the little kids.
4.0,"I got the Youth Large size for my daughter and it just barely fits her.  She is 55 1/4"" tall, 79 lbs.  I'd recommend 1 more size up for this height & weight."
4.0,I got the 1c which seems a little big but my wife likes them and wears them all the time. They dont bug her ears so the silver is good quality.
4.0,"Very good. Excellent fit. This hat is unstructured, overall good buy."
4.0,"She likes the hood and the fact that this coat comes down farther over her hips than her older jacket, without being shapeless like the barn coat I gave her last year.  We'll have to see how warm it is, and how it holds up, but giving it a 4 star rating for now just for style and fit."
4.0,Product runs a little big in seems to get bigger once it is wet
4.0,Fits very tightly. But maybe that good. It's for better circulation.
4.0,Love the convenience of just pulling this dress over my head and going.  I bought this dress for a cruise.
4.0,"The belt is narrow enough to fit through the belt loops on all my pants and so far its holding up just fine, no problem with the plastic buckle.<br />The reason I prefer web belts is I can clip a devise that employs a metallic clip to hold it on,  and the web belt holds up, unlike a leather belt that is damaged up by a metallic clip."
4.0,"I bought this for a friend for Christmas. I was unsure with how it would fit as I was unfamiliar with the seller. I purchased a medium, which is what she normally would wear. It seemed to fit well, the sleeves were a little long and the bottom of the shirt with the drawstring seemed to hit at an odd place."
4.0,I’m a little disappointed I thought it was metal but it’s plastic I wish the discretion was clear
4.0,The engraving for the brand is really not necessary.
4.0,You need at least two sizes up because it runs very small.
4.0,Very long but comfy
4.0,"Very soft, cool, flowy material.  Arrived before expected time in good condition.  However, the way the legs are sewn makes the front top of the thigh expose too much.  I got a medium.  It wasn't as flattering as I had hoped. I have thin waist and wide hips.  Maybe for a different body type. Unfortunately I have to return it."
4.0,the quality was wonderful for the priced i have to say that i was really suprised! i bought these for my bf and they only complaint is that it came in a purple bag and a purple box not really how i wanted to give them to him. all the reviewes say that they got a a free gift but i did not.
4.0,"SUPER comfortable. I got the larger and im 8 months pregnant and I love wearing it. I'm not a huge fan of how it looks on me, but hopefully after I have the baby I can use the scrunch and make it look more flattering."
4.0,Bottom fit well. Top was too small (size 36D in bra)
4.0,It was okay but it was short.
4.0,I got this as a gift for a family friend who is into the steam punk fashion scene. She seemed to lie it very much but I think it may have been even better with out the flashy little diamond jewels in it. Good buy none the less!
4.0,"I purchased in denim size small... I'm 5'2, 118lbs. While I love the way it fits, just like all the other reviews, the pants are really long. I wore tucked into a pair of uggs but don't know what I'll do in warmer weather. The suit is super cute and of great quality. Beside the pants being long, they also stretch out and get a bit baggyer after about an hour or so of being on. I wish they had size XS with petite lengths. I love the design and style,... Makes your butt look really good!!"
4.0,"Just got it, comes with an alcohol swab and its in a nice little box in a plastic protection sleeve, I'm impressed for spending only $0.35!"
4.0,"Wife bought these for loungwear. She often buys men's athleisure for the comfort and pockets. Loves the softness and flex of the material. And a plus is the depth of the pockets, which also zip. She says it fits true to size."
4.0,"Nice product, average quality"
4.0,"These earrings are really pretty, but are super hard to put in. They also both wrap the same way, I would prefer if they had a ""L"" and ""R"". They are very subtle and unique though and I like them as a small pair of earrings."
4.0,"Arrived quickly and as pictured but the black is already scraping off in some areas. Also, my wrist is 6&#34; exactly and this band does not go small enough. I've found a work-around but it's not the greatest."
4.0,Soooo pretty!!
4.0,I love the earrings but am wondering if they were Newvor used.  Being  that there was a  thank you note with the earrings I am puzzled as to if it came from a store or an individual.  I was under the impression I was buying my new from a  store
4.0,"Emacco's Adjustable Birthstone Bracelet makes a wonderful gift. The bracelet I ordered was silver tone. As I have a small collection of Alex and A*i bracelets, I thought this would be a nice addition. First impressions: The bracelet arrived in a nice black gift box. Immediately, I noticed this is not of the same material of the aforementioned brand (that brands silver tone has a specific silver tone). Nevertheless, the bracelet is VERY pretty and it IS made of stainless steel so it made well.  It has a few charms on it that pertain to the birth month you select. It has your birthstone and  your zodiac sign. It also has a a cute heart winged charm with the saying &#34;love&#34; and another &#34;saying made with &#60;3&#34;. Overall, I really liked this adjustable bracelet and am happy to add it to my collection. I received this product at a reduced rate for my unbiased review."
4.0,When I saw how small these looked for a large my heart sank. They took a long time to come. And came from Asia. But I tried them on and they supprisenly fit without the waist feeling uncomfortable but should have ordered an xl. Should go up at least one size if not 2. Seem well made.
4.0,Todo muy bien.  Viene en la medida normal y llego un dia antes de lo programado.
4.0,"This cardigan came in quickly and nicely packaged. It was wrinkled at first, but after shaking it out for a little bit, it was fine. It is lightweight and perfect for a spring day. I bought this for my trip to Las Vegas and it worked out perfectly. The weather was in the high 60s/low 70s and this was wonderful to have!"
4.0,"Fit as expected, ordering a larger size. Just didn’t care how it looked on ME. :)"
4.0,i really like them but sometimes i have a hard time reading digital screens.
4.0,"Received the Black today and I absolutely Love it!  I hate that it doesn’t fit through the chest & arms. I ordered the large: I am curvy, 5’9, 165, 36D and it was too small in the chest/arm area-that’s the reason for the 4 stars. Umgee has run large for me with a few other pieces I have but NOT this one"
4.0,Very nice and funky.
4.0,Quick delivery and it arrived in a nice favor bag. There were a few loose string but I was able to trim them away. Would buy again.
4.0,I thought I was purchasing a petite length. Now I have to find someone to hem them.
4.0,I really like this one the colors are the same as shown but the the hips are a little too large Maybe it is just my size other than that it is great
4.0,These are 8 3/4&#34; pocket squares.  There is a nice variety of colors in the box and the description is accurate. [[ASIN:B01LMRCYQW ciciTree 26 Solid Color Men's Pocket Square Handkerchief Hanky Polyester Silk Satin for Wedding Party 22 x 22cm Gift Box]]
4.0,Good quality key chain; the swivel top makes it easy to add/remove keys. It's really stylish/cute and not flimsy. Will last a long time. I'm glad I bought it.
4.0,The item wasn't match my needs
4.0,"Great for my Halloween costume but after a couple hours, painful to walk in."
4.0,Great summer weight item. Could be used as casual day wear or out dancing.  Its got some stretch and the scoop neck doesn't leave much to the imagination!
4.0,I just hope it last long. I love it
4.0,"I was compelled to write a review because I myself benefitted from the reviews on this particular boot, especially regarding sizing: believe the numerous points made on correct sizing - go down on size. That is, if you are an 8, get a 7.5. In my case, I trusted the reviews given the consistency by which they were made, and went 7.5 although I am normally an 8. In fact, I have a pair of Timberland boots (Colrain reissue, half leather/half canvas) that was sized 8 and it was about right, so I was a little worried to NOT trust the sizing. So when it arrived and fit, I was much relieved. Overall a good boot, well constructed. But in terms of comfort, it pales a little compared with the Colrain Reissue boot I bought just last year (the Colrain seemed to 'wrap' better around the foot, and the cushioning just right). But then again, that did cost more than twice as much, so I'd say this pair is very good value for money. Note that for some reason, Timberland themselves tend to keep this one off discounts even post Christmas."
4.0,This dress is extremely short
4.0,I love the dress it is comfy and flowy.
4.0,"Runs slightly narrow, but an amazing shoe. None of the glitter has really come off."
4.0,Kind of see-through.  Need to wear a tank under it.
4.0,Runs small and shrink more in dryer
4.0,This the second pair I have owned. Very comfortable and a quality flip flop. My only issue is the price has gone up significantly so it is no longer the value buy it used to be. Overall good basic leather sandal and great comfort.
4.0,There seems to be some visual distortion near the edges.  Otherwise they are fine.
4.0,It is printed unevenly
4.0,"It took over a year of washing before they started developing holes near the toes.  I typically wear socks and no shoes around the house so this was great for me.  Unlike other reviews, I wish the rim of the sock was tighter.  To me, they are a little too loose at the entrance."
4.0,A little big but otherwise as described
4.0,"Printed on not sewn, good quality."
4.0,looks great on my  cap with the skull wings
4.0,"I like the gold hardware on the ends of the bane makes it look high quality, the color is not as uniform as the picture shows. It is attractive but I had to return, it did not fit my Garmin vivomove watch."
4.0,Somewhat fit a bit too small but I can make it work. Its cute
4.0,"Looks cute on my daughter. It fit her a little on the small side for a women's medium. She wore it for the holiday parade in town and it looked great on her. The material is soft, and it did not appear to have shrank in the washer/dryer. The color is vibrant and she really stood out (we got her the red and white one). I think the price of $33.99 is comparable to what I would see in the department store, but I think it is a bit over priced."
4.0,"I received this product as a birthday present and I would like to say that it is a very adorable piece of jewelry that made a wonderful gift! It came in a little red box exactly like the pictures posted by the seller and by other reviewers.<br /><br />The picture of this necklace compared to the picture is almost spot on. the heart looks the same but the moon - instead of a crescent shape, looks more like a backwards C. Overall I think this product still looks very nice and presentable.<br /><br />If I was to have one complaint about this product it would be that the chain seems very fragile, I am worried that some day I will tug on it just a little too much and it will be broken. If they could fix this problem then I would give the necklace 5 stars.<br /><br />I just want to point out that if you are not careful the pendant will come off of the chain very easily and it is somewhat difficult to put back together.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have to mention this disclaimer however, I am not affiliated with the company and I am in no way obliged to provide a positive review. The opinions expressed here are entirely my own."
4.0,"Comfortable enough, but they ran small and had to return them."
4.0,As excited expected the only issue I had was if you drop it would pop open and everything falls out
4.0,"I got these for my trip to the Museum of Ice Cream. They were perfect! The socks fit well, and were super comfortable and cute. Delivery was on time."
4.0,"Lovely bracelet. I gave it to my daughter for Christmas. She had asked for one with Saint Michael, although I couldn't see if Saint Michael was on it before I bought it, she is still pleased. Still searching for one of Saint Michael."
4.0,"These were for gifts, but they appear to be well made."
4.0,"This shirt fits well and is of good quality.  I was disappointed with the material itself not being the color portrayed in the pictures. The dark grey looks like an overwashed black instead of charcoal and the flowers are very peach, almost bright orange."
4.0,"I had a pair of MAXX Rough Riders previously that was one of my favorite pairs of sunglasses. Nothing fancy, but Camo and extremely comfortable.  I went online and it seems as if they have changed up the design a tad bit and the style, but not drastically.  That being said, I purchased these and am content with my purchase, however, I would have preferred to have had the older style and design.  But overall, I am satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,Excellent quality but the fit is a little tight for an extra large
4.0,This shirt was really cute. The embellishments were really blingy. It is definitely a crop top. I have a short torso so when I buy crop tops I can usually get away with it but I couldn't wear this without my stomach showing so it is as advertised. I usually wear a small to medium and it fit comfortably but with room for me to grow.
4.0,"This is a nice-looking budget-priced ring for people who are into a Norse or a pagan style. Most of the ring is made out of steel treated so that it looks aged, and the interior is supposedly made out of wood but feels suspiciously like plastic.<br /><br />The exterior of the ring has carved runes from the Elder Futhark alphabet. There isn't any message here: the runes are literally the Elder Futhark alphabet in sequence! But it looks nice, and I doubt anyone is going to ask you what your ring says anyway."
4.0,"If you have used sprushes these feel different in the hand as they are not a smooth taper, they have an edge 2/3 down the sprush. They were far cheaper then sprushes so for that alone, I'd recommend the set."
4.0,"I am a bit busty and by the looks of the model,  I figured the extra would just push to the middle,  but in reality there are under wires that separate the cups  a little too well in my case, causing overflow. For the price,  I figured I was keeping it for the bottoms anyway,  so I tried removing the under wires and now it fits with cleavage like the picture with almost no overflow. The bottom of the zipper does dig into my skin a bit (with and without the under wires), otherwise it is comfortable and makes me feel confident!"
4.0,"This outfit is very cute and I like it a lot, but there are some things that could be better. The material is very thin and I don't care for the full white back. You can easily see the pattern on your baby's diaper through the back.<br /><br />I bought size 18-24 months for my large 6 month old. He is wearing 12 month clothes normally and this outfit fit him perfectly.<br /><br />The snaps on the legs are kind of weak. They pop open much easier than other kinds.<br /><br />The hat is so flimsy and won't stay on.<br /><br />I really like the look of the outfit so that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3, but I wouldn't pay full price for it.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate for my honest opinion."
4.0,This is a fantastic silk shirt especially for the price!! It is sheer but that is what I was looking for!! I am a 5’3 female 155ish lbs 36DDish and I ordered a medium and it is a prrfect light weight over shirt unbuttoned!! I will be ordering more just wish they had grey and white ones!! This is EXACTLY like the sulk shirts from the early 90’s so if you like nostalgia this is for you
4.0,"I wear a lot of ties at my job and these are a hit! They are unique, stand out, and really make an outfit pop. My only negative for these is that the quality isn’t strong. From a distance, they look great as well as up close. But, when you touch them they feel like inexpensive cloth/linen. I just wish these were nicer quality. Otherwise, I am very happy with these and will more than likely purchase a few more since they are such a hit at my work."
4.0,"These gloves are nice and waterproof. They are thin and as a result extremely light in weight also and can perfectly be work inside a thicker and regular glove if needed.<br /><br />However they run small. The size chart is also incorrect. I got an M for myself but there was no way an M hand could go into them. I had to give them to my spouse who is a size smaller and the gloves provided a snug fit for them. So, I would suggest order atleast one size up from your regular hand size.<br /><br />Attaching a couple of pics with my hand above and below the gloves to show the size difference.<br /><br />Update: Bumping up 1 star as my spouse loves these gloves. These work as a great inner glove over some thicker ones."
4.0,"The bottoms fit fine, but the top is a hassle to get on, but this is not new for me as I have a larger than average bust size."
4.0,"Bought it for a kayaking trip where it would  certainly get wet, and it did on the first day!  Worked beautifully throughout the trip with no condensation issues; was easy to read with the large face.  Only  reason for not giving it five stars is that the second hand is too similar in size to the minute hand.  It’s confusing when trying to tell time with a quick glance; would be much better if the second hand were a different color.  Also wish it lit up for reading in the dark, but nonetheless an excellent waterproof watch for a reasonable price."
4.0,This is nice Cardigan!<br />This is good as I expected it.<br />Made with good materials.<br />The color is great.<br />The quality is good.
4.0,First time buying shades online n I was impressed. Quick delivered
4.0,Fits well but just a tad narrow for a wider foot. Wash on cold in washer.
4.0,"Daughter likes them, soft to touch."
4.0,"As cute as it looks!  I took a star away since there is, as can be seen, a small gap in the clasp.  But I like it and don't think the gap will cause a problem if it's clipped to a belt loop or purse handle.<br /><br />I purchased five or six products here and this one wasn't in the package.  I informed the seller and got this replacement in about three weeks, with a small gift added.  The seller communication was excellent!"
4.0,Runs large but super cute!!
4.0,"If you wanna freak people out, Chewbacca will! Lol<br />Soaks up sweat around your neck too."
4.0,"It's a basic T-shirt with a flat silk-screened print. Pretty much what you would expect. I like the design and twist on the Christmas sweater, but it's a pretty basic T-shirt and not very comfortable for long wears."
4.0,It works great pulled down with leggings or pulled up with jeans.  Scoop neck is flattering as well as the loose fit around the middle.  I was happy with it.  Fabric is comfortable too!
4.0,Absolutely love the dress. Fits perfect and it's stretchy.. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star cuss it took longer than my expected date good thing I ordered a while ahead.. Other than that I love it and most likely will be getting more. But different colors. 😍😍
4.0,Bought two - feel good. Good fit.
4.0,Love this dress! I am 5'3 and ordered a medium.  The dress goes to the floor for me so I will have to have it hemmed but other than that it's a great dress!
4.0,Looks a lot fancier than i had expected. Was planning on using it for everyday wear but would also be good for a night out
4.0,"These are cute little butterflies, They are a little smaller and thinner than i hoped but I'll make them work for a cute embellishment to my purses.."
4.0,So huge but very soft and cozy
4.0,"Watch is Casio worksmanship quality,all nicely done.Its very accurate too,thanks to radio control wich watch receives every night,here in North Europe about 03.00 o'clock.<br />Watch is relatively easy to set up,it takes lots of pushing buttons but hey,its not so hard to push buttons anyway..After you feed your locations cordinates once it shows sun rise and sun dawn times correctly.Also it has calender for decades after you set date one time.<br /><br />Watch felt too light for me ,just as a toy so I swapped stainless steel bracelet and now it has  pretty good feeling and nice heft.At least I know when Im weararing a watch.I wish it would be little bit bigger,it sits so well  that it feels smaller than it actually is.<br /><br />Compass,barometer and altimeter, when calibrated they are reasonable accurate,definetly enough for such wrist watch.You count on them in the wild only on emergency,when you have lost your main equipment.Solar charging works as a  charm,its nice to give a s##t of battery change.<br /><br />This is my second  Pro Trek wich I bought to replace  my 2500t wich I lost for my son.It has better and faster sensors than older one but still...Im not sure wich one I like more.<br />Anyway,its not bad at all.Its nice for every outdoors lover,hiker,fisherman etc person ."
4.0,"While these were a little longer than expected, my kids loved the designs!"
4.0,I liked this jacket very much. It has an air of professionalism to it and the fit is well done. I did order a large which was a little too snug when zipped up so I wore it open mostly. I will also say that the construction of the sleeve will keep you warm & the wrists are tight. Recommend wearing in colder weather. I wore this jacket heavily & will buy again.
4.0,Love the quality and look but sorta smaller than expected
4.0,"Great pair of sneaks, but they were to small.  I usually wear 11.5 and they only had size 11, I thought I could get away with the smaller size, that didn't work out so well for me."
4.0,"This workout outfit is SO cute and long enough for my tall gals! This color is indeed squat proof great for working out. I only gave 4 stars because I wish the waistband was smaller and that it didn’t slide while working out, because I definitely had to adjust it a few times. Overall though, especially for the price, this is a great buy! I’m a 24 waist, 35 hips, 125 lbs, 5’10 and I got a size small"
4.0,"This dress fits more like a shift style dress. I typically wear a size L or XL. I fit into the medium, and it's still a bit baggy in the back. If you want a more fitted style, you'll have to size down 2 or 3 sizes. Otherwise the quality is great, especially for the price."
4.0,"This product works. But, it rattles loud and can be very distracting. Not the best quality product. It does have a strong vibration and does what it is supposed to do. That part was excellent. Besides the rattling batteries it's a good product"
4.0,"Super cute, fabric is thicker but still need to wear a tank top with it. I ordered a large (I'm 5'8 and 125 lbs) and it fits great. Very happy I ordered the large."
4.0,"Quality very good, initial problem with size(resolved)!"
4.0,"Pretty dress. Need a cami, the girls are on display without one."
4.0,"Love the sweater, but I got it for my unusually small 5 yo and it looked more like a dress... thankfully it fit my abnormally tall 7 yo. Sizing issues aside, it’s a great sweater. Looks great, nice material, etc."
4.0,Smaller than expected!!
4.0,"The fit is small bc they're made in China so I got 2 sizes up w that in mind. They're made well, comfortable, stretchy, & even long enough! (I'm 5'11&#34;). I'm currently online to order another pair in a different color."
4.0,"These boots have the classic Chelsea boot look. I have always liked this style and it is timeless and classic. Looks good on both female and male.<br />I ordered a black pair. They have elastic side panels which is helpful when slipping on the boots. These boots are made out of man made materials and that was a little disappointing. I was hoping it would be real leather and I would have been happy to pay more if there was real leather.<br />The sole feels a bit hard, it is not rubber but plastic. This is why I am rating these boots four stars. If the boots had softer supportive rubber soles, I would feel ok wearing them a full day. Because they are solid plastic, it makes my feet very tired quickly. The boots are also a bit on the tighter side. I am a size 9 and I ordered size 9. I wish there would have been half sizes, as I would have ordered a 9.5 size.<br />The boots looks great and especially with long pants such as jeans. I purchased these shoes discounted, in exchange I am giving my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"This was a very pretty skirt. I got the black, thinking it had lighter stripes, but it turned out to be sparkly silver. I liked it, but I bought it for work, so it was a little fancy for that. The fit was nice, and I liked the length."
4.0,Muy bonito y sexy.
4.0,Nice collection of black dress socks that are much more cost effective than buying them at a standard department store.  Lightweight.
4.0,"Got it on time and worked quite well. The only improvements for this item I can tell is it would be nice if it had a manual that tells you how to set the time (it took me a little while but I figured it out) and the minute a little bit of water from the sink hit it, the watch started glitch in out. But other than that it's a nice watch"
4.0,"Product fits as expected with the exception of sleeves are a little snug. Other than that, the dress is perfect!"
4.0,"It's ok, my kid looks great.."
4.0,"A fun pair of pajama pants that always makes us laugh whenever they are worn. The color faded some, and the length shrunk after washing, but that was ok as they were a little long to begin with."
4.0,"The only thing I don't like is it doesn't offer a lot of support, but it's a cute and comfortable swimsuit."
4.0,these things are well worth the money. very good wallet!!!
4.0,Material feels very inexpensive but the hat fitting is great.
4.0,Top part just fit. Botyom is huge.I ordered a 2x going by the other reviews its beautiful nice sateen material but its really long and its way to big in the waist. im almost 5'7 and it drags on the floor even with heels on. I'm going to get it altered and city off about 4 to 5 inches at least but it is beautiful and I brought 2.
4.0,As described. Material is more of a cotton than expected.
4.0,Great gift. Has it on her keys and hasn’t taken it off
4.0,"Fits good. I bought the 4xl. I am 6' and 230 #.  Of the others jersey sets at this price point on Amazon, I have found these to be the most comfortable. Wash cold in delicate bag on delicate setting, hang dry.  So far the chamois has been comfortable on my up to 40 mile rides.<br /><br />GET OUT AND RIDE! And have fun 👍"
4.0,Good quality and modest neckline. Perfect for our needs.
4.0,Didn’t really keep my Grandaughter glasses on like I expected it to.
4.0,I'm a size XL and it fits perfectly everywhere except the sleeves. They're a little short. For me that's no problem since I like them rolled up a little anyway
4.0,This nighty has an AMAZINGLY beautiful color! It is a very nice light fabric that is sewn nicely.  The sizing is WAY off though.  The pictures show the nighty on me (I wear a 2xl) and my mom (she wears a large). Yes the pictures are over clothes but I think it gives you an idea.  I COULD get it on but it was not attractive at all.  My mom was able to get it on and it fit much better.  It is sure to please your partner!  The neck is a halter and can be easily tied or untied!  Washes well on delicate! I loved everything about this except the sizing. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,They run in small but a cute style
4.0,"I really just wanted these to be warm, and they are, so I love them. The touch screen touch doesn't work on my cell phone (google pixel 3), FYI, but I don't really care."
4.0,"I bought this for my roommate for the holidays. She typically wears a woman's med, so the mens small was perfect. It was baggy in some places but that adds comfort to a holiday sweater. I would totally recommend."
4.0,This dress is very pretty. I'm 5'7&#34; about 150 lbs and ordered a size M. It's very long and almost touches the ground. I also love that it has pockets
4.0,A nice little coin. There was a finger print on the coin when I came but I was able to open it up and wipe it off. Other than that really awesome Dogecoin and the colored shiba inu really stands out well
4.0,Granddaughter liked these little items
4.0,Got these for 6yo daughter for car rides. They’re made of a forgiving plastic so I don’t expect them to break any time soon. The temples are a bit wider than the frame so the frame looks a bit small even for kids. But she loves them!
4.0,As described.  I like it.
4.0,"Very cute and inexpensive. Arrived quickly. I've never had this type of earring before, a first for me so they took some getting used to. Also had problems with them staying put, but I may not be putting the backing in the right position."
4.0,"I really like the design, but its almost see through, definitely need to wear under layers."
4.0,small but very beautiful my wife like it so much .
4.0,"the bottoms are too big, like grandma pants. But the top is very nice and comfortable"
4.0,"I did try it on before hand though and it was definitely interesting. Wasn't sure of what size to get but probably should've gotten a size up, totally my fault though not the product. It surprisingly does provide support considering it's just sticking to you. Takes a few tries to get it positioned properly but once you get it it's very comfortable. Now I'll have to find another outfit to wear it with!"
4.0,"Pretty nice watch for the price. A lot of detail on case, with nice view of internal gears. Pictures shown are an accurate representation of item, you get what you see. Chain and case feel sturdy enough, I do not anticipate any problems there. Rear glass is truly made of glass, while the face &#34;glass&#34; is actually plastic. Only negative I can find, is that the hour hand can be tough to see at quick glance. Not really an issue, but it can get lost in the workings of the brass background. I bought this watch to use as my daily watch. I enjoy wearing a pocket watch, and I did not want to take a chance of ruining my Great grandfather's 127 yr old watch, so I wear this one. Best part is that Amazon provides a 2 yr warranty that covers the internal mechanism, watch case, crystal, crown, stem, and buttons .You cannot beat that."
4.0,"This is the first time I bought a pair of slip on boots.  I am normally a lace up kind of guy.  I normally buy size 12 thinking they would fit like a pair of lace up, but they actually fit loser then expected.  They will still do the job just fine, using them as rain/mud boots, they will just be looser then expected.  I can not blame the boots or the sizing, that is why I still gave them a great review.  I would just recommend going to a store that sells this style to try on a size before buying online.  I would have gone with a 11.5 for a better fit. I was not able to go try on boots since I am overseas doing construction. Lessons learned.  So do your own research before buying online slip ons vs lace ups."
4.0,"Fit it a tiny bit tighter than I expected, but a larger size would be too big.  I wish the shoe laces were a couple inches longer.  If you only knew how hard it was to find these among all the other shoes out there.  I can NOT complain too much.  I am a happy camper even with the mild issues above.  Thank you Shoes For Crews!"
4.0,Didn't like the material that dress is made from.
4.0,"All around nice fit…sexy!  Love the material and floral print.  Would have given five star, but the “v” was too low."
4.0,Comfortable and good support
4.0,"I got this for my daughter birthday she like them because it’s a variety of styles and colors, I think are perfect for her age and she looks pretty, about the quality some feel like plastic and some treads were not that good and some fell but for the price this is a good amount of earnings."
4.0,These are great my daughter can only wear titanium. Beautiful blue
4.0,"I wanted comfortable every-day sandals to wear around the house, but also be able to use for prolonged standing. I've only had then for a week and so far so good. At first they were very tight (I have a wide foot) but after a couple of days of breaking them in the fit is much more comfortable, snug but not uncomfortable. They are a bit odd to walk in at first, the sole is thick and almost memory-foam like, but you get used to them quickly. I took of one start because for me, having a wide foot, I have to reach down and adjust the top strap to slide my foot all they way in, otherwise it tends to get stuck about 3/4 of the way in if I just try to slide my foot in. Overall, I'm happy, they seem sturdy and are comfortable."
4.0,"the underwear fit mostly just fine but for me the band across the top was way too snug and a bit thin, i thought the band was a bit larger than it turned out to be, that is my fault though.  I had zero problems with returns so I'd still try stuff out from the seller, they didn't give any hassles."
4.0,Cute. Pretty color and great length. It's not super warm but thicker than I expected.
4.0,"Bought this for my son.  Pretty nice, but I'd suggest to hang dry to prevent shrinking"
4.0,"This bracelet makes a wonderful gift.  I bought a bunch to give away at Christmas.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 starts instead of 5 is that the size might be too large for smaller wrists.  Otherwise, great product- good quality!"
4.0,I can't wait to were these this winter!!!!
4.0,Nice quality for the price. Thanks
4.0,As long as you size up one from your pant size you should be good. I did and it's super comfortable full length on me and I'm 5'9&#34;. I was a little worried it would be short because of that. Shipping didn't take nearly as long as the day I was given. Overall happy.
4.0,"Works well for baby watching fireworks for short period of times. It would have received 5 stars, but the earmuffs are super tight on the head which caused our baby to get uncomfortable within 10 minutes of wearing them."
4.0,"Over all fit as expected. For reference I’m 5’ 9” 36 DD bust and approx 155lbs. I ordered the large based on review suggestions to be sure it would be long enough. Over all colour is as seen, I haven’t noticed any cuts, holes, stains etc. right out of package the dress is pretty wrinkled, so traveling with it might require figuring out how to get those out. The martial is stretchy, soft, and a nice weight. The length was perfect for my height, brushes right above my feet. My only complaint is the X strap detail doesn’t sit right and the arm holes are pretty baggy. I’m not sure how the dress will hold up after multiple washes. Just based on material, it might start to pill. I love the pockets!"
4.0,Pendant is beautiful. Looks exactly like pictured. My only complaint is that it's smaller than I expected. I expected it to be a little larger than the size of a dime.  It's about the size of a dime. Maybe a fraction smaller.
4.0,"Haven't had occasion to wear it yet.  Love the big dial, readable numbers."
4.0,I love this. The only complaint is the latch on the frog pouch is a little too tight. I just have to bend the metal a little. Other than that it was perfect 👌
4.0,"This hat is beautiful. (Found matching silk scarf.)<br />Coffee color with delicate interesting pattern on it. Because of the black details it looks feminine. It has a character, but doesn’t “scream” on you, lol.<br />This design is very challenging to sew, as the threads used two colors at the same time, one color on each side.<br />Oh, well, someone at the end did whatever crooked stitching on the crown of the hat. And, because everything else was neat: the fabric cut to align pattern in a symmetric way, all other stitches made very well, layers of the fabric contracted well. For such price!<br />So, I fixed the wrong stitches by hand, I am very handy.<br />Because knowing how this hat made, I can appreciate the craftsmanship of such hat, that’s why it’s more special to admire."
4.0,"Nice quality, definitely fits on the snug side. Actual shirt is a much brighter salmon pink in person."
4.0,"I bought this to match some existing pieces.  It is just really pretty, matches my other CP pieces, and is the perfect length.  I don't know if it was who I purchased from, but the clasp looks as if it has been replaced.  Otherwise, five stars."
4.0,I like the length and the feel of these.
4.0,Very Nice Belt
4.0,The tag said mid rise they are not a true mid rise I own about 15 pairs of Judy blue pants all mid rise these were not have they been true to size I would have kept them gladly
4.0,"I love these gloves because they look good on your hand, they're warm and they're made well. In addition, the design, in 3 shades of grey, is quite nice. I gave the gloves 4 stars because they are somewhat large for my hands. &#34;One size fits most&#34; never works for me -- in anything. For those of us who don't qualify as &#34;most,&#34; I wish manufacturers would make their products, ideally in actual sizes, but at the very least, in small, medium and large or small/medium and medium/large."
4.0,"It is an awkward length for me. Way too loose at 4 wraps around, but way too tight at 5. Other than that, very beautiful."
4.0,"I liked the style ,and how it fit ,just wasn't crazy about the material, I would have preferred cotton."
4.0,"These sunglasses are a nice cheap option for me. I constantly break things, so these are a low-commitment option for me to get polarized lenses. I will say that they are a little wide on my face so that they slip sometimes, but generally, they do the job."
4.0,Love it but way bigger than I thought it would be
4.0,Good for fun and funky costume jewelry.
4.0,"Nice looking but a bit small, order the next size up."
4.0,"When it first came in it wouldn't fit my ear. I had to have my husband's assistance to adjust the piece to fit my ear. After it was adjusted, tail, head, and loop that goes behind the ear it fits just fine now. My only problem is that according to the pictures it should look silver but when you actually get the product it has a hint of gold to it. Really nice piece overall for the price. But I don't suggest jumping around or dancing at a club with it on."
4.0,"Oh my god this dress is gorgeous.<br />I read another review that said if you aren't a D cup this chest if this dress will be big on you anf I have to agree with that.<br />Its almost see through, so make sure you have either a slip or nude coloured bra and underwear for it."
4.0,Great gift for the pool player in your life.
4.0,I need to exchange this product for Small to Medium.  I’m happy with the quality it’s just to large for me.
4.0,Looks great but sheds a lot.  Be prepared to shake it outside or in the trash before use.
4.0,"Great top! It is very cute and fits better than I expected. I typically wear an xs, but since this is Asian sizing, the 6 fit really well. The length is great, and the top is loose and flowy, but not so loose that I feel like I'm swimming in it. The buttons on the back give it shape so that it's not boxy. The material is relatively cheap and wrinkles instantly, I may need to dig out my iron for this top, but I think it's worth it. I have already ordered it in black."
4.0,I like the logo and the quality. It was a little loose around the waist and hips but not a deal breaker for me. I was a little disappointed that the material wasn't as soft as some of their other shirts. I would still buy it again.
4.0,"It's a beautiful bracelet, but the colors aren't as vibrant as in pictures. Still happy with it though & am excited to give as a gift"
4.0,"Beautiful bathing suit and great material. However with that being said it was sadly too small. I'm 5'6, 130 lbs, and a 34D. I usually wear a medium but the top and bottoms were way too small. They both fit more like a small in the junior department."
4.0,"I love my bag! The design is lovely. I don't lie the extra fabric at the top, it folds in on itself if I don't zip it up. Other than that, it's cute! It's crossover straps can also be shortened and used for a dressier outfit."
4.0,"These is a decent little top. I can't say too much about how well it lasts, as my child needed it for a Halloween costume (Beatrice from Despicable Me) and never wore it again, but it fit as we expected, seemed like it was made of a decent material, and looked pretty much exactly as pictured."
4.0,"Little tight, not horrible though. Size up would have been better"
4.0,"Nice coat , for those that don't like wearing a heavy coat , only thing is arms are too tight !!!"
4.0,"It is a belt, easy to use with jeans."
4.0,"I love this dress! I feel great in it and get a lot of compliments on it. I say the fit is as expected because I had to order it in a much larger size than I usually wear, but the earlier reviews helped me with that. Just be aware. Other than that, the fabric is a nice weight--not too thin, not to heavy, with a just-right amount of stretch to keep it comfy. I wear the dress with a black cinch belt and that really complements it. With wedge heels, it looks like a dress for a girl of the 1940s or '50s. With Mary Janes, it's nearly an Alice in Wonderland look. Very versatile!<br /><br />So why the 4 stars? Mainly because in the photo, the sleeves look like regular cap sleeves, but really, they're little puff sleeves. Not the worst thing, but definitely not something I would have chosen. However, I like the rest of the dress so much that I decided to keep it anyway."
4.0,work great and look great!
4.0,"Lovely earrings, as picture. One came with obvious indentations, however, the creases eventually went away with a few wears."
4.0,"I (a dude) got this as a back-up to the more ornate &#34;Long Nose Adult Venetian Mask&#34;, in case the latter didn't fit. I'm glad I did; this one was much more comfortable. The masquerade lasted for several hours and I was able to wear it the whole time. The ribbon ties can be tied tight enough, and the size was large enough so it wasn't constricting and small enough so it wasn't slipping all evening. The eyes are large enough that they didn't constrict my peripheral vision.<br /><br />The mask is labeled &#34;unisex&#34;, and it works fine as a men's mask. There is a subtle glitter effect but it is offset by the rest of the mask, which is solid and matte. I got several compliments and nobody questioned whether it was for men. Overall, not the fanciest mask around, but doesn't look cheap and is comfortable enough to wear for an evening."
4.0,Fits face well.  Pliable  nose tab that holds shape when formed.  Easily adjusted ear loops that maintain positioning chosen.  Nice variety of colors.  Quality product for the money.
4.0,Super cute dress! Fabric was lighter than I expected but still very nice  especially for the price. I ordered the 2x. It  may be a little big especially in the top part  but I'm pear shaped so I got the 2x to fit tummy area. But if you don't have that problem them the 1x will do nicely. Stretchy material so it has plenty of give. I will wear spanx due to fabric showing all the curves. Length was good for me. Came to just below my knee. Well look vary nice with heels.
4.0,"Nice fit, color is vibrant. Easy to clean"
4.0,"It's exactly as it looks.  There's plenty of room for all my things and then some. Nice design and not cheap looking at all.  If you like oversized purses, I would recommend this one."
4.0,battery in back - hard to get to<br />there is no &quot;Y&quot; in back - both suspenders come off straight - making it bulky
4.0,"its not as mandible as i would hope it would be, but other than that its perfect."
4.0,"I have not worn it yet, but it looks fine."
4.0,I carry this purse everyday
4.0,"Dress is a bit sheer in the bust area. I am a 34DDD, 150lbs, athletic build and typically a size small in maxi dresses. Based on reviews I went with the medium and it fit perfectly. My only issue is the tops cuts in more than I would like and even with a criss-cross bra, my bra strap still shows in the front. I either wear a scarf or a jacket to cover it and you would never know. It is super cute and I feel skinny and cute when I wear it. I would purchase another color, but I'm afraid it would be too sheer."
4.0,Good quality but my husband was unable to use with his watch because the straps were too short and if they were 2 inches  longer would have been great for his wrist. Seems more for a man with small wrist.
4.0,If you have long arms get the large.
4.0,There are slight scratches on the hardware otherwise great size and it's a gorgeous bag. Got it for use while I'm in a business casual environment.
4.0,"Super, super cute! Unfortunately it’s a little bit in the chest area for me and seems to run a little large. I got a small which is usually the size I wear but HAVE to wear something under it at all times. Other than that super cute and exactly as pictured!"
4.0,"Can’t go wrong with Carhartt. Bag is good quality, nice size, and the brown is easy to spot in a sea of other black bags at the gym/airport/etc"
4.0,The first pair I bought for good! Ordered same size again and they are sliding down!
4.0,"Has a lot of cute-ness potential but mine arrived with the hem below the zipper unraveling so I plan to return and try again.<br /><br />Also, the dress fit me well but I'm quite petite at 5'7 and 122lbs and I was hoping for a somewhat looser business fit (not too loose, but not like a club/party dress fit) and it was tighter than I'd have expected the medium to be - if you're on the size border then you may choose smaller or larger based on how you plan to wear this dress. Hope round two works out!"
4.0,Fair price for overall product; arrived on time.
4.0,"Nice and fine bracelet. Not very good quality, but something to wear every day."
4.0,It shows a belt in picture but no belt came with mine
4.0,A little glue shows between the gears but otherwise very real looking.
4.0,I ordered one size bigger base on the reviews; it was very nice for the money. The fabric is cheap but it doesn't look cheap. Overall is a good look!
4.0,"This is a gorgeous bracelet. It's a very wide cuff, 10 rows of rhinestones, and it is extremely bright and sparkly. The silver tone that it is made out of is very bright and light, not dark and dingy like they sometimes can be. It looks a lot like rhodium plate, or white gold, instead of the slightly darker silver. This would be beautiful for a lot of dressy occasions. It absolutely blazes with flashes of the rainbow. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is very tight. It definitely runs small. If you have a wider risk, it's going to be a bit uncomfortable. It is stretchy, and maybe it would be a little bit more comfortable with time if it stretches out a bit. I'm not sure if that's possible though. It really is gorgeous though. If you have a 7 inch or smaller wrist it probably will fit just great. I received this in exchange for trying it out and reviewing its quality and performance. It's a very, very pretty bracelet."
4.0,I just ordered these from my daughter who is going to start school for the first time and since we are still in a pandemic I wanted her to be able to have a safe experience. these are super cute and I think they'll work perfectly but I just found one that was already broken super disappointing but I will continue to use the other one
4.0,"Very nice looking boot. Just what I was looking for. Fit in the width is a little narrow but, the length is good. I don't know if ordering the next size up will work for the width. I really like this boot so, I'm going to see if I can live with the tightness."
4.0,I ordered this dress in a small I’m 5’7 & 135 lbs it was a little big in my stomach area! I would recommend sizing down! Besides that pretty good quality & super cute!
4.0,Just like the picture I absolutely love this outfit.
4.0,"I really like the backpack but it s not not sewn nicely, some areas was not sewn shut and now have to do it myself."
4.0,They’re adorable. Run a little small.
4.0,Nice and well fitting. I like the look.
4.0,"I had my ears pierced a few months ago and wondered what it would be like if I stretched my ears and wore plugs. I bought these just to get an idea of what it would look like and they look so real on me that I think I'm just going to buy fake plugs from now on instead of having to go thru the pain and permanent stretching of doing real plugs. I have had people even ask me about my ear stretching saying ""did it hurt?"" or ""how big are you going to stretch them?"". I am happy with they way they look and the material they are made out of. The only thing I dont like is they kind of pinch your ears a little bit at first but you get used to it really quickly."
4.0,I've been using this for about 4 months now and it seems to work fine.
4.0,"Great fitting hat. Only complaint is having to pay for shipping, this hat was sent in a large box all by itself which was unnecessary."
4.0,"To start, if you buy this dress, please, do yourself a favor and take out the terrible padding! Initially, when I wore the dress, it fit terrible in the chest area, the pads were way too stiff and were placed in a way that sitting or moving caused nip slips all day. At first, I thought maybe I should have gone with a larger size, even though the waist zipped nicely.<br /><br />Eventually, I ended up tying the top around my neck and the lower strings on my waist unlike picture and it fit ok, but I wasn't that impressed. Finally, I took a seam ripper and took out the padding. This made a huge difference with the fit, so if you buy it and you're unhappy with how awkward the top part fits try taking the padding out and see how much better it looks.<br /><br />Also, make sure to wear some nipple pasties or covers as nip slips may occur. Someone also commented that material feels cheap, and I do agree, it's like a thin tablecloth type material, not awful, but definitely not luxurious. Lastly, the dress is somewhat opaque, but in the daylight may become see through."
4.0,"It is a nice chain. The only thing is I wish I had noticed it has a spring ring rather than a lobster claw which is more<br />secure.  The rings could have been a bit larger, so I wouldn't have to struggle to get it clasped."
4.0,The busy part of the dress was tight. The hem was unevenly cut.
4.0,"SUPER CUTE.GREAT FOR<br />EVERYDAY USE.LOVE❣.<br />THEM,GOOD QUALITY♡"
4.0,They run small but are very comfortable
4.0,Decent for dress up costumes.
4.0,"Love the boots, all though the top is kind of tight so I can't stretch them as long as they are , but good enough, I love them!"
4.0,perfect sized backpack; bigger than a purse but not as big as a regular backpack. it fits nicely on my back.
4.0,"I've always ordered a size 9 with confidence ....the left one is a little short on my foot, the right fits perfect ...they will work for the boat but for every day use  I will need a different pair ...they are comfy feeling but another downside is the straps are not complete velcro and remain loose and curl up .."
4.0,This is a cute and sturdy purse. I like that it has a solid bottom with metal feet. It is a good size and holds a lot. My one complaint is that it had a horrible fish like Odor when it arrived. It took weeks to sit out completely.
4.0,God i love this dress company but thy dont carry 3x i tried 2x nooo good very pretty dress very good quality nicely made but don't fit I am bummed out I tried 2 different dresses from them and they don't fit
4.0,The circle pair was broken in the package. The post is broken off of the chain.  The other two pair are in tact. I love them. They are my new favorites. I really wish I could wear the circles.
4.0,I love the earring but it was a bit tricky putting it on for the first time
4.0,"The dress is of great quality, abit long for me but it looks great."
4.0,I would have preferred a magnetic closure.
4.0,"I bought this for a friend for Christmas and love how it looks, and the liner inside of it. However the zipper on the liner seems a little cheap and it comes open when it's zipped shut. I hope this isn't something that will bother my friend, but I did give her a gift receipt just in case. (and she can always take the liner out too if it's too bothersome!)"
4.0,Purchased as a gift for my children's godfather.  Was just as expected.
4.0,"The upper part of the dress is very soft but the lower part is thick and kind of hard with ironing, i need also to shorten it, my length is 150 cm , i ordered XL ."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:5b6f19507eeac2b3bb83f8654f9c53c7]] I like the pad placement and the mesh lining makes it nice and cool to drive around Florida. I didn’t like that the spine protection is sooo loose. I want it to stay on my spine not my ribs. Maybe you guys could make an extra small or add a waist cinch or something 🙏🏻
4.0,I was pleased with the wider band under the cups.  They did not roll up as you might expect.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"Very good for the minimalist feel, store enough cards that I needed, only really downside for me is that its not sensible for carrying much cash, bc it makes it either look bulky and ugly or make me fear that money will fall out with the in and out of a pocket. But if you carry just a bit of cash, this is perfect for the new minimalist men."
4.0,"Made in Italy,good quality"
4.0,"Pretty, but the size fits smaller than the other size 4 dresses I bought from Ever Pretty at the same time, and there's absolutely no give when zipping. Would exchange if it isn't a hassle."
4.0,"Our little 16 month old is tiny...only 20 pounds, so figured she'd 'grow into these' by summer, but they fit her perfectly now.  The cotton is thick, soft and beautifully made, and the beautiful colors were just as fibrant after washing.  They do have extra leg and arm room to grow into, but very snug around the midsection and like I said, she's tiny...barely any 'chub' on her at all.  Cute, comfy, and wonderfully made."
4.0,"Sometimes snug, but I think it's me..."
4.0,my husband loved it so much
4.0,Worked great for big boobs
4.0,"Cute, comfy and warm!"
4.0,Bought this to wear at a wedding.... Hopefully it holds up. Looks just like it does in the picture. The fabric is light and stretchy.
4.0,"If you have grails that you want to preserve, this is a great way to do it. Sealing the shoes in will help reduce the possibility of oxidation and keep them protected from potential issues (humidity, smells, water issues, etc. -- low probability, but you never know!)<br /><br />The kit comes in a mini shoe box basically. The packaging definitely fits the theme, which is nice. This also makes it very giftable, it would be a great gift for the sneakerhead in your life who wants to protect their shoes. In the box you get 4 sneaker fresh bags and 1 hand pump, for more gentle sealing. I would not recommend a vacuum, air compressor, etc. as you want to gently seal away your shoes.<br /><br />As I stated, the packaging makes this giftable. The size of the bags are perfect and can accommodate many sizes of shoe. However, I would not say this is a necessity from a product perspective. You're basically buying vacuum seal bags (e.g. the ones used for packing, bedding, etc.) and a hand pump in nice packaging. For the ease of having the right size (vs. generally having to buy a multi-size pack).<br /><br />A necessity? No. A fun gift and great for those grails that you want to protect? Yes."
4.0,"Although I appreciate the safety of the tear away velcro in the back, it felt irritating on my son's neck and I don't think he will use it that much for that reason"
4.0,The pair of aviator glasses arrived with damagd lenses.the other three plastic ones were perfect and comfy.
4.0,I use the product in the gym.
4.0,This dress is comfy and fits well everywhere except for it tends to shift in the bust and straps. I will have to stitch the straps at the setting I prefer and the bust needs safety pinned or it slides around and exposes the bra or whatever you have under the dress. I safety pinned the edge of the bust to my bra so it wouldn’t move around during a bridal shower. The ruching is nice. It is decently thick and is not see through. Just super silky and slippery.
4.0,"Nice dress, a bit big order a size down"
4.0,"At 6' and 200 lbs, xl is usually large on me and leaves room for layers but not with this pull on from Montane. It fits but its snug. Its ok since I don't really see this as something to wear over another layer though. Its very nice looking and I like the long double front zippers that help you get it on and off easier and vent a little if you like, too. I had hoped for more warmth in what looked like a very warm hoodie to me though. I had it over a tshirt this morning at 45 degrees F and although I wasn't cold, I definitely was not warm either. I'd say 45 to 60 F is the right range for this. Its got a chest pocket but nothing on the sides or even on the arm. Another pocket or two somewhere would have been really nice. You can't really store much in the one pocket on the chest, especially for me since I already find this piece to be a little snug. I didn't buy it here although I bought it from Campsaver, who was selling it here. Kind of strange that it was 80 shipped  with a coupon of theirs at the company website and they ask over 100 for it here. Anyway, I also have a baja pull over from Outdoor Research and although I find the Baja does a little better job of keeping me warm and is a little larger/roomier of a cut, this one from Montane blows it away on looks.  As long as you aren't planning to wear it as a stand alone under 45 F, I think this is a great little hoodie. Definitely size up on the order though."
4.0,Good sporran chain. Good quality and weight. Make sure you account for extra length to let it hang. I added an extra 4 inches and it wasn't enough.
4.0,Runs large. Not a fitted top. Pretty colors.
4.0,I really like the product. I am an average size person who wears a size 7-8 and after reading the reviews I ordered a large but that too proved to be a bit snug especially around the bust area(32c-d). So I decided to give that one to my daughter and I ordered an X;large which ended up being the fit I prefer.
4.0,"I love this bikini, it is super adorable.  Unfortunately it runs extremely small.  I purchased an extra-large as I have large breasts.  The bottom was an extra-large and the top looked as if it was a small.  The top of the bikini had so much padding that it was impossible to even fit anything else in there.  Being a girl with large breasts I always have to buy an extra-large top and was really disappointed that this didn’t fit.  I think they need to realize that not everybody has small breasts.  I had to return this product for a refund but if you have a small chest this bathing suit is super adorable.  The bottoms are high waisted which seems to be the style at the moment.  The suit itself is made of polyester and spandex and made very well.  I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Super cute. Mostly true to size. Just a touch big. So cute though
4.0,These fit perfect and the color was awesome. Just didn't like the pattern as much as I thought once they arrived.
4.0,Very warm and cozy .. just needs to have pockets
4.0,Bowties came in quickly. Very pretty
4.0,Nice quality. Easy to wear
4.0,Functions just like the originals!
4.0,"I purchased the A Green in this top but the Green isn't as vibrant as in the picture. It's more of an Army Green. I do like the cut and fit. It is true to size. The back of the top is what drew my attention and also from others too, because  I have  received so many compliments. In this particular top the high-low makes a huge statement. If you purchase it, you won't be sorry. I'm very pleased."
4.0,"I love the concept of the dress and the patterns! I ordered the medium but wish I had ordered the small — despite that I have a large chest, I have a smaller waist, so the small might fit better. Like some others said, the pockets stick out if it’s a bit big and they did for me, making my hips look larger. I will order this dress again but in medium next time."
4.0,"Love them, so far no issues. They are comfortable and the lenses change out easily."
4.0,"A bit thin, socks can be hard to choose online.  I wear these."
4.0,"Beautiful design, lightweight and good coverage. Fit was bigger than expected."
4.0,"This is a very dressy watch ... good looking, indeed. I was lucky to buy it when the price temporarily dropped to $20, so its good value.<br /><br />I gave only 4 stars for the following reasons:- a) the date window is impossibly small and almost useless, b) the language of the instructions do not give a clear picture. As an example, the word 'day' is used where it should be 'date', and c) The seconds and fractions-of-a-second hands, of the chronograph (stop watch feature) noticeably, don't return to zero when reset.  These are features that don't detract from the good looks of this watch.<br /><br />I must say however, as a timepiece, it keeps good time, having lost only 3 seconds in 3 months of ownership"
4.0,Liked the product. Wish it came in more colors.
4.0,"This is a great scarf, but dumb me, I thought that it was all just polka dots.  I love the polka dots, but I am not as crazy about the border.  Still, this was a great value, and I will wear it often."
4.0,"This is a cute hoodie, but be sure to know it is a tshirt hoodie. I didn't catch that when I ordered it even though it's in the description. Lol! I just saw the picture, thought it was cute, and based on the picture, thought it was a sweatshirt hoodie. I will say the material is quite thin, but that just means my grandson will be able to wear it more often since we live in the south and don't have harsh winters. I am concerned that it may shrink some once it's washed, but we'll just have to wait and see since this is a Christmas gift. I would recommend this to a friend, but I'd be sure to tell them it is a tshirt hoodie."
4.0,Very cute pravely exactly as pictured. Happy with my purchase.
4.0,I'm 4'9 it's a little to short for me. It fit great it's just to short
4.0,"While on these are very comfortable, but they are not easy on and I ordered a larger size on purpose."
4.0,"full coverage, fits well and cute!. Size is as expected."
4.0,Works good don't keep your hands as warm as claimed.  Using them riding a bike early in the morning.
4.0,Nice belt.  It goes great with oversized shirts.
4.0,These are okay. They run a tad small.
4.0,Works great -  love it
4.0,"Nice earrings, but I thught they were smaller and the color was darker (they are really pink). Not the best quality, but good for the price they have."
4.0,Hey I love this watch the first one they sent the little clock didn't work I wrote to them to send me a battery cause know that was the problem. They sent me another watch instead hey wow that was great. I gave the one I had to my brother and said don't ever say I didn't never give you nothing you jerk by the way he is a jerk. Now people talk about both our watches they make simuliar one but this watch is detailed better. But I did notice it did lose about 20% of it's shine but I can only tell it because I wear it no one will know it's our secret.
4.0,"The skirt is super cute in the front on me but I do not need any folds in the back.  I am a curvy girl and I have hips (not huge, just not flat).  The folds in the back are not as flattering as a flat back would be.  So if you need a little boost in the backside area, this is the skirt for you!  The material is great and love the color!"
4.0,Dial is too good. But the band is too small.Giving 4 rating for it's dial
4.0,Comfort & quality at a great price.
4.0,"The colour was not as sharp and bright as seen on the site....but the finishing very neat, pretty and professional"
4.0,I love the mask image. The only problem is that it’s super big. It covers most of my face. Goes from bottom of eyes to almost neck lol
4.0,I love the dress but I wore it when I was  3.5 months pregnant and it showed me off.... I bought a medium thou am 5.3' and 140 pounds during pregnancy at the moment.
4.0,Great advice for life.  Love these earrings.<br />.Super cute.  Would be great if backs were for sensitive ears...
4.0,"Update:  If you're tall and intend to use this for both functionality and to appear good, you should do the following:<br />-  Only attach the two clips about 1 inch away from the seam/stitching that's on the sides of the shirt.  The further away from the side (i.e. more towards the front and back), the more the shirt will look like it's being dragged down against your body, creating a weird look.<br />-------------------------<br /><br />How good this serves you depends on what you want out of it - Looks vs. Function.<br /><br />In terms of function, it works quite well in keeping your shirt tucked in.  It's also comfortable to wear.<br /><br />In terms of looks... This is where things get variable.  I'm 6ft tall with a 34&#34; pant length.  The elastic on these stays is quite strong and pull down on the shirt a bit too well.  This creates a strange look of the shirt on the shoulders and chest area where the shirt looks like it's being pulled down hard, as if trying to stretch and mold the shirt onto your body spandex-tight.<br /><br />I don't know if the same case will happen for anyone shorter since shirt lengths tend to vary somewhat proportionally to an individual's height but for me, it makes me look weird.<br /><br />If you don't care about the look, just the function:  I do recommend this product.<br />If you do want the shirt to look naturally worn while keeping it tucked in:  It may vary, but I would not recommend the product especially if you're tall."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift, but am tempted to keep.  Very dainty and classy looking. Love it!"
4.0,"It's really comfortable and fit nicely, however the modal fabric is very clingy and shows every little lump and bump. Even with a shaper I could see underwear lines. Since I was trying this as a dress, I decided to return it. As a slip it would be fine."
4.0,Loved them returing for smaller size and return process was a breeze
4.0,Nice looking sunglasses
4.0,It's really cute but a lot smaller than I expected. I wish the chime of a little bit longer as well.
4.0,Comfort and warmth.
4.0,love this.  good quality
4.0,The ring is pretty but alittle more pink than I expected. But overall pretty.
4.0,"This top looks slightly different than the image (as I expected) but is still extremely cute! It fits me well, but being &#34;one size fits all&#34; is not very accurate. If I were anything larger than a small with any larger than a B-cup... Forget it."
4.0,Just slight uncomfortable but I've gotten used to the feeling.
4.0,"It's a rather thin material but it worked great with tights and booties.  It's true to size and not too short, but then again I'm 5'1""."
4.0,Absolutely my favorite dress now. The martial is soft and look great on...perfect for work and night out. Got both the red and the yellow stripe dress. I'm 5&#34;1 about 135 and the size 6 fits perfect. Homeyee line is now my go to shop for dresses.
4.0,Easy to use even for a none professional and perfect tha tyou get it in 3 different sizes for different part of your head.
4.0,It is a good wristband. I just wish the clasp was a press and pull instead of just pulling it to open.
4.0,"My wife loved it, but due to the bracelet being a little we will need to get an extender(My wife did admit she has large wrists)"
4.0,Dress is nice but doesn't look exactly like the picture.
4.0,"I don’t think it’s anything special, lights up makes a little tune. But my daughter was happy to get it.. as pictured."
4.0,Cute costume jewelry for cat crazy kid!
4.0,This is a nice watch but paid too<br />Much for it
4.0,About a half size smaller than expected but very comfortable
4.0,It looks exactly like the picture. The material used was great but it the neck piece holder broke within a month. I just keep it as a little charm now.
4.0,"A nice, durable fingerboard. Met all expectations of build quality and the thickness of the board was on par with, maybe even better than, the competition without being bulky. My son loves it and it’s still in heavy use after a couple months now."
4.0,"This bralette is cute and comfortable.  The band runs large, and the cup size runs small.  So it would be better for people with proportionally smaller breasts for their figure."
4.0,"I thought they were so so so cute and sexy, but unfortunately they were like a size 5 to my size 10! Also there is no button hole for the button (which you will see in the pic I posted) that would have been easy to fix though. Of course was disappointed but I have to give this company 4 stars because they were very willing to compensate me for my trouble....and the shorts were just what I would have wanted if only they had fit me. So the produst is great but beware of size, they run VERY small!"
4.0,Nice watch for the money
4.0,"Got lots of compliments but one of the pink &#34;stones&#34; fell out and I didnt realize it. The stones are actually colored plastic. Don't get me wrong, this a cute necklace but cheap quality. If it weren't for the compliments  (which lead me to believe the quality appears better than what it is) I wouldn't wear this. But people love it so even missing a stone, I wear it from time to time.<br /><br />Background: I own many levels of jewelry from high quality designer to...well...this peice which is probably THE cheapest (quality and price) peice I own."
4.0,"Nice, but not worth the money."
4.0,I needed a swimsuit just for lounging around in the back yard.  This one is super comfy.  I ordered an XL as I wanted the top to be flowly and not clingy.  The bottoms are a little short but luckily the top covers my rear :)  I like the little ties on the sides of the bottom.  I may end up sewing the two front top panels together as they are separated.
4.0,"This is a thick, heavy 1.5 inch wide leather belt that's a lot softer and flexible then most belts this thick, the leather is blemish free and of above average in quality, the stitching is also nice and it comes in a nice velvet gift bag, I liked it well enough that I ordered another one for my son."
4.0,"Very Nice Pants, I love them. They fit incredibly and they have a Retro feel!"
4.0,Nicely packed but delayed shipping. Very thin and not as largess I like them but I love the hoop look earring in general.
4.0,"I am overall happy with these shoes. They look exactly as pictured. I loved the color as it matched with my daughters Christmas dress. These are great for crawlers and non walkers. They are very thin leather and provide no support, so I definitely wouldn't put these on a walker outside. The soles surely would not hold up on concrete. They are good for the price, but would not hold up with a lot of wear. I purchased a green pair as well, and those surprisingly had a much thicker leather. I am not sure if it is bad quality control, or just a different style."
4.0,"Pretty, but smaller than looked in picture. Not packed well, broken upon receipt."
4.0,"Love light weegt dress for summer, the material is a bit thin, but it looks nice."
4.0,"Over all an adobrale shirt. wanted the black, but this was closest to what was available in my size. 10/10 recommend. Would’ve been 5 stars if I got it in black!"
4.0,"It’s cut lower than I expected, so just a little safety pin will help. I’m 5’1, so it’s definitely long on me, just need to wear wedges, otherwise, it’s super cute!"
4.0,Listen this dress is every thing however if you are a curvy girl I suggest size up
4.0,"Shirts fit well and made well, though snaps do not work that well.  Improve the snaps and it will be excellent."
4.0,Excellent work and craftsmanship.
4.0,Really cute for the price but a little larger than I expected. No worries though since my little girl will grow into them eventually =)
4.0,Great pjs very soft wash nice
4.0,Uncomfortable handel
4.0,generous fit<br />not as cool feeling as I would like<br />good quality<br />well made<br />I bought two more after I received my first pair
4.0,"This sleeves are very confortable, and protects you from sun ligth. I wish the have something  to hold the hands when u at wearing so they won't slip on the arm"
4.0,"Beware!  I wrote this review a while ago, and it was copied onto a different product from the same company.  I do like these pants, but I'm not really sure about the other ones.<br /><br />I am 6'3"", 198 lbs., and fit. I got size XL. The fit is good and the wide legs work well for me.<br /><br />The material is light and cool, though a little scratchy. They will hopefully soften up after a couple more washings.<br /><br />The front pockets are good sized: My 6.4"" smart phone fits well, but the rear pockets are small and kind of useless.<br /><br />These pants are great for kicking around at the beach or just hanging at the house. I like them."
4.0,"The fabric is amazing. It is warm. It is a bit small at the waist, however. I do feel comfortable in it. It’s just kind of not that appealing if s hoodie in general if that makes sense. There are better UA ones out there."
4.0,Kinda snug.  But ok
4.0,I like it a little big. Good fabric.
4.0,"If you are a bit of a exhibitionist this is the dress for you. The deep V of the dress is super fun. I was not brave enough to leave it completely open, opting instead for a cute tank. The skirt is not as flowy as in the picture, it is more of a sheath than an A line. Overall the dress is super fun and I look forward to dressing it up for fall and winter."
4.0,weird sizing. not american sizing that's for sure...
4.0,"I am happy with this. i would prefer a longer strap and pockets inside, but overall happy with this bag"
4.0,Good stuff...better clasp than most...it is a little sharp but hasn't been an issue so far.
4.0,However too small around the chest and way to big around the waist
4.0,I normally wear a 34 C and that is what I ordered.  It is very loose on me and unfortunately unwearable.
4.0,Ordered 2nd time & it ran on a slightly smaller size for men's design large
4.0,turns my arm green:(
4.0,Very pretty I would recommend
4.0,Good quality ring for the price. Love the design will see how the silver shine holds up. Delivered very quickly.  Would buy again.
4.0,"I received this attractive official MB wristwatch as a gift, however I am a bit disappointed in that the movement is rather pedestrian Japanese and constructed in China. I would have thought it would be sourced with Swiss movement (at this price point) and perhaps Swiss made. Additionally, the leather band, while attractively embossed with crocodile pattern, is very small and requires I latch it on the hole next last. I don't have large wrists and in fact need to do up most watch straps to mid to near top holes, so this one is sized on the small end of the spectrum. It appears to keep good time but the hour/minute hands are difficult to see against the silver/white background. More contrast would make it easier to read at a glance without needing to stare to discern the current time. As a devoted MB owner I like to wear tasteful official accessories, but I expect these items to be as well thought out and engineered as their cars. Unfortunately this example falls short of the mark.."
4.0,Love this tote bag! Do not wash it though. I made that mistake.
4.0,"I'm 5'1 and 115 lbs. an XS in this would probably be too small, but the skirt part seems big? Very flowy. Shorts underneath fit well, I like the phone and the ball pocket. The skirt is longer in the back, which makes sense since I'll be bending over golfing in it. The fabric seems nice, it's soft. Will see how it wears over time."
4.0,"Durable but still stylish. These bags have survived my kids carrying them for 6 months. Still have a lot of life in them yet. By now straps would be breaking or fraying apart but these are still as good as the day we purchased them,"
4.0,"Came sooner than expected. Package was in good shape. The lounger was in good shape. I haven't put it on yet since I need this for surgery. Needed something with a zipper. It's light material which I really like, don't like heavy hot loungers. It's great. 4 stars since I haven't used it yet. Good job."
4.0,"These retro looking glasses from WearMe Pro are so cute. I love the hipster/retro style. The square frame is unique. The lenses are polarized to help reduce glare. They have an amazing fit. They are very comfortable to wear. There's no rubber or silicone nose pads to pinching on the ear piece. They look great on just about anyone. The only complaint I have is that the top of the frame goes straight across and creates a weird look across the eyebrow area.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions expressed are my own based on my personal experiences with the product.  I received no compensation and I am not required to give a good review. This disclosure is in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."
4.0,"I love this dress.  It's a nice length. I could wear it to a picnic or wedding or whatever.  It looks exactly like the picture. It's soft and my partner loves it. My only complaint is that it's fairly thin. A bra would easily shine through the back. Without a bra...that's me in the picture.  I love it and can't wait to wear it out! I am  5'2"" and went off bra size. I want one in pink!"
4.0,"Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review<br /><br />I love this choker! Its thin and not overbearing, but makes a statement. My only complaint is it seems to spin around a lot so randomly, the clasp is in the front. Its also a little small so if you have a thicker neck, it may not fit."
4.0,"Cute jumpsuit. Very comfortable. True to size. Just as pictured. It's not super dressy, but it's nice enough and the black and white is very cute."
4.0,"I'm a medium size usually and this fit me perfectly, its feels very comfortable. The delivery took a little bit longer that I expected but it was worth it."
4.0,Order bigger than you think
4.0,"Love this watch, very stylish and a watch you dont see everyone wearing,getting lots of comments on it.I do wish the hands were a bit darker,maybe it,s just my ageing eyes.Very pleased allround though.Thank you."
4.0,Good for workouts. Dirt or water don’t stick on skirt. Modest workout wear.
4.0,Cute but run big. Will return and buy a size down.
4.0,Nice material cute<br />Design
4.0,"It feels kind of cheap, but what can you expect for the price? Easy to take the old band off and stick this one on, probably took me no longer than 5 minutes. It's been almost a month now and the clasp is still closing firmly. It does come with extra links, in case you have a larger wrist."
4.0,Meh. Not that great on  Support.
4.0,These definitely keep you from slipping! Love that it's a 3-pack. Would buy again.
4.0,"Very small product, very beautiful product"
4.0,The chain knotted at the ring where it connects to hasp.  Overall a very nice addition to my collection.
4.0,"So cute! Great quality, subtle statement earrings. They're simple enough to enhance my ears without stealing the show from everything else going on! They are everyday earrings."
4.0,"Got these for a quick mask for running into the store, also bought for my son to wear. They do not fit real snug so that means my son has a hard time wearing them."
4.0,Good fit and great for the summer. Extremely comfortable.
4.0,Que esta binito
4.0,"Oh!  I love this ring!  It is so feminine and dainty on my hand. The flowers sparkle and give off a not-cheap feel. I like that you can adjust the fit for any finger. I hope it lasts a while. I was sad that a petal fell off.  However, I found it and glued it on with super glue. Did the trick!  Very happy with this purchase."
4.0,"Nice quality, keeps your ears warm but they are a little bulky."
4.0,Love it!! They just arrived and a Christmas present for my boyfriend. We are going to Disney in March so it went with a theme! Very well packaged. Mine fits perfectly
4.0,Its a very soft easy to clean  and dries fast when hand washed ....Very happy with this product
4.0,I like them for the price. They feel a bit tight around the ears after an hour of wear but do the job and lenses seem quality enough no waves or distortion.
4.0,Value for money 👍
4.0,"Great gloves, but too small for me.  Hand to return."
4.0,"Loved this all summer. Wore many times to the pool, beach and even while on a cruise. Great material does fade just a little but not bad after multiple use. Out of all of the coverups I purchased this is right up there as one of my favorites."
4.0,"Front facing pouch with a 3-way over the shoulder strap to keep your goods up front and secure and within eye sight at all times. The black version is sleek and minimal with the exception of a small, rubberized Nixon logo on the bottom corner of the bag. Straps can be adjusted to adjust the height of your bag as you see fit - whether high up on the chest or lower on the belly. The bag is small-medium compact, similar to a standard fanny pack - so you'll be able to keep your phone, wallet, keys, gum and other tchotchkes stashed with ease."
4.0,pretty very sparkly earrings...for the price they should be better put together though...if you look behind them you can see some of the pieces glued on crooked...but they look great infront.
4.0,"Pretty good overall,"
4.0,Met my expectations.Thank you!
4.0,I like this bag. It's good for the price. It's a bit larger than I was expecting. Only buy this if you want a really big bag. I didn't notice the bag having a chemical smell like others have mentioned. It will work as a pool bag which is what I plan to use it for on vacation.
4.0,"Item is what it looks like, however was delivered with the feathers folded in half in a stud earring case... Hopefully they will straighten out over time."
4.0,I really love the material... The fit was too big for me... But it's cute and drapes well... The one thing I would do before you wash and wear it is to re-enforce the straps... I had a small travel sewing kit that I used matching thread to double stitch the straps to secure them better from snapping... Love both colors I ordered!!!
4.0,"As a woman with a slightly larger midsection than I’d like, this dress fits exceptionally well. It’s just flowy enough to hide my stomach without making me look entirely shapeless. The only slight complaint I have is that the pockets are a little higher than I’d like, and they stick out ever so slightly."
4.0,My daughter ordered this dress in yellow and loves it.
4.0,"It was way too long on me I had to get the hem lifted in order to use it, but then again I am on the short side other wise it fit good."
4.0,"Awesome, but didn’t last a summer for a boy wearing and playing to not get a hole in them."
4.0,Love the quality but I would order up
4.0,Buy a size bigger than you need
4.0,The fit was a tad big but not anything to really complain about. I am a tall woman and my husband loves it.
4.0,Bought this in a LG (I'm a size 12) and it fits differently than the black lace dress. It is tighter and didn't look as nice as the black lace version. I'm curvy and busty and the area from my upper thighs up to the waist was more snug than I was comfortable with but the rest of the dress fit like a charm!
4.0,"Nice shoe, just didn't like the extra glue on them"
4.0,"Shirt is great, however it runs small or should I say runs short. The length only goes about 1""-2"" past the waste line."
4.0,"I bought 2 of these. One for my boyfriend and one for myself. My boyfriend loved them however it didn't work for me. My hands were wayyy too small and so the fingers didn't work properly on my phone. I ended up gifting my pair because of that. I liked that the gloves had rubber dots on it so it gives you a bit of friction to grasp things, like your cell phone. These are just like regular knitted gloves so they are not water resistant in any way."
4.0,"It was an ok corset, but I'm returning it because I bought a size too small. I thought I could make it work,  but I can't because of the shape. Dont buy this one too small! Lol"
4.0,"It has a very cool look, design and print.<br />It runs a little large which is ok for me, because I wanted it large anyways.<br />It’s a nice quality, light and thin sweatshirt. It’s just not warm at all."
4.0,"Not as snug as I expected, but it is true to size."
4.0,"This ring is gorgeous although the black does wear off after time. Mine is turning a deep silver. This has become my favorite ring and I wear it very day, if lost I will purchase again"
4.0,"I am 5'1&#34; 132 pounds, 34b in breast size and 40&#34; in hips, based on the reviews, I ordered a large and it fit somewhat perfectly.  I got a lot of compliments on this dress, I wore it to work."
4.0,Color is pretty drab
4.0,Great top- comes in a plastic bag in a ball.  It will be very wrinkled. I couldn’t get the wrinkles out no matter what I tried. Had to send to dry cleaner for them to do it. It’s fine now- just be prepared not to be able to wear it out of the bag or when you first get it.
4.0,I like how the dress looks and fits. But I have to wear a tank top under it because the top part is almost see through if you have big breasts. It's a nice casual dress.
4.0,"These sandals are adorable.  I found them to be true to size and love how you can adjust not only the ankle strap, but the front of the sandal as well.  It was nice to be able to adjust them accordingly.  My 4 year old said they were comfortable, but the ankle strap seemed to eventually irritate her after a while.  Other than that they seem to be made pretty well, shaped well to the foot and cushiony with a nice rubber grippy sole."
4.0,"I bought this for a 5K that I ran that was being held at the same time as the Olympics. Fit was a bit small, but I had no issues with it. I'm a size 4-6, so I would say that it had more of a Junior fit than an adult fit. Still good for what I needed it for."
4.0,"So bummed because it’s so adorable! There’s was one spot on the edging that irritated my wrist. I guess I could try and “shave” the wristband but decided to buy a different one. Could have just been this isolated one. It’s easy to install and when I as wearing it, got a lot of compliments because it’s unique to have a leopard print band on an Apple Watch. Gave it four stars because I didn’t end up using it for long but maybe it was just this one."
4.0,"Love these glasses. I may not look stylish, but they are a big improvement. My other brand got lost. What a difference going without and between the 2 brands. Glad I choose this company."
4.0,"I really liked this dress, but had to return it because it was too big. But it's super cute! Got a smaller size and it is great!"
4.0,"A bit less quality-made than what I thought from the photo.  But, still cute.  Arrived quickly.  I would order again."
4.0,Vibrant and  comfy!
4.0,Wore it to an outdoor graduation party.
4.0,"Very soft, love the hood. Good quality for price."
4.0,"Love the design, it looks just like the pictures- very sparkly and cool design. I love the thicker band but I would say it runs a half size smaller than what it states. I got an 8 to wear as a thumb ring or on my pointer finger but its is a little tight, I can wear it when it is super cold out but probably not when it gets hot out. I just bought another ring in the same size and it fits perfectly so I know it is a fault with the sizing on this ring. Luckily I can wear it on other fingers since it is really pretty. The stones are set so that you cans see them in the back of the ring which lets more light in and they really sparkle. Overall this ring is great, it is beautiful just beware of the sizing."
4.0,These are super soft! The top is a little smaller than I like for sleep wear but It’s totally ok
4.0,"beautiful glasses, but they came with a scratch on them"
4.0,"Ordered these for a wedding. These suckers are humongous! I had to go with a different pair. They are beautiful though. If you’re looking for very large tassel earrings, these are the ones!"
4.0,It's kinds heavy. It looks nice. I haven't had any issues with it.
4.0,The snow pants are adorable and very warm but they seemed short on my petite four year old.  I could have gone with the 5T but then they would have been so wide I wouldn't have been able to zip her coat.
4.0,"They were a little smaller than I thought they would be, but they are nice for the price"
4.0,Got the matching gray elephant for my kids. Came frm china like a wish pkg... will see how long it holds up.
4.0,"It is very elastic, so don't plan to have anything heavy hanging off your belt."
4.0,Loves these boxers! They are 100 percent cotton and super soft. My son loves the designs and tells me they are super comfortable. They do run small and shrink a little. I would size up!
4.0,"I read reviews that said you could size down, so I did. Runs small but def cinches in the waist, should've gotten a medium but there's  no choice to exchange so I'll manage!"
4.0,"We like these pretty well. They’re not THE nicest quality pajamas but they’re comfy, the colors and print look nice, and they’ve held up well in the washer and dryer so far. We used them to take professional pictures and are pretty happy with how they looked in the pictures. They fit as expected."
4.0,Like the color and would purchase again in a different color.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:3475a5fd66373bfe02c60315ef9003a]] I’m 5.4. 145lb. Got M size<br />Fits great but the right pocket was broken.<br />I have a navy colored one as well. I like it!
4.0,"this was obviously worn, there are deodorant stains all over the dress. i dont want to review too negatively though because it is a nice dress, just wish it had not had someone elses deodorant all over it"
4.0,Beautiful pattern and delicate fabric. Low silk momme (thin) for the price asked. May not be durable.
4.0,Look great on my husband. They look like I paid way more than what I bought them for on Amazon.
4.0,"I chose only 4 stars simply because I want a sweater that has a wider, more substantial amount of material from the side to the front. I was looking for more of a “duster” type cardigan that would be fuller in the front to offer more coverage.<br /><br />If you like how it fits in the picture, you will be happy with this. It will not stay on your chest, but will open and rest on the outside of your chest near your arms. If that’s ok - this sweater is perfect."
4.0,"Great product, does what it's supposed to do and well."
4.0,I didn't expect the pendant to be big so I was really surprised when my order came. Whoa.
4.0,"Great price, more than a simple tote. Well designed, lots of zipped closures, shoulder room, plus sturdy canvas outer which brushes most grubbiness away easily."
4.0,"Very comfortable camisoles. I've been looking quite awhile for the perfect cami - of course the one I had before is no longer made. This pretty much fits the bill. The empire waist and separate cups avoid the &#34;uni-boob&#34; look. I was worried about the strap length because they're not adjustable, but they work well on me and of course could be taken up if necessary. The camisoles also long enough to tuck in, which is fabulous (I'm fairly long-waisted). The body is not fitted, but doesn't bunch up under a fitted sweater. I've washed them twice and allowed to dry flat, and have had no problems. I dinged off one star because the lace continues around under the arm. It's not too scratchy, but I would prefer a smooth hem for even better comfort. I do wish they came in a natural color. I'm 5-5&#34;, 112 lbs., 32B or 34A and ordered a small. Can't beat the price!!"
4.0,These are way bigger than I expected but they're cute and good quality.
4.0,"It’s great for the price. package it came in was good. The only thing is that the spring it came with wasn’t good, the spring pushes out the “button” to lock into the watch. It cause the button to pop out. So not very durable, but I was able to piece it back together and still use it."
4.0,"Very pretty, true to size, and high quality. Only complaint is when tightly twisted the tops are slightly off center."
4.0,"Shipped and received on time, well packaged, and it’s a good purchase for the money."
4.0,"Very good quality, worth waiting for though"
4.0,could be tweaked a bit in design so it didn't lay so awquardly on the shoulders
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised when I got this absolutely beautiful bangle! It has a decent weight to it, it's not lightweight....that being said, it has a beautiful pattern of colors and  goes well with almost everything.<br />It adds a touch of color without being blingy or being loud.For reference, I bought the purple one and I am in love with it!"
4.0,"The charm itself is gorgeous, but the chain chosen for it isn't. The chain is just very plain, so I would recommend having a silver chain ready when you get the package!"
4.0,"This necklace appears to be bigger in the photo, which is what I wanted for a friend.  It is, however, very pretty, was a gift and she loved it!  I would buy it again for someone else who likes amber."
4.0,"I've gotten a lot of compliments on my neckace and I really like it. The stone is very nice. The clasp is a little too big for the holes of the extender chain, so it takes a little work to get it on."
4.0,They were exactly as pictured.. Just a tad big even after ordering as directed... But they will still be enjoyed.. Love the color and the realistic look..
4.0,Small as usual for compression socks
4.0,"Very convenient, only for me the only con; it doesn’t reach around the sides of hips as much as my real shirts.<br />For ref: My waist is a 30 hips 38. Height 5’7"
4.0,"I like the dress. At first I thought it wouldn't fit properly because I'm short. I was thinking the color change would be too high up. I was wrong. It fits perfectly. I love the vintage look, but for me, the top was awkwardly plain and some type of jewelry or scarf (or something) may help...unless you just like to be plain. The top is thin and you can see through it. A hot pink lacy bra would not be ideal, but if you wear black underneath, should be fine. Overall I like the dress. It is thin, but I like it because the weather is getting warmer (doesn't apply to those lucky people who live in states that are warm all year round)."
4.0,"I'd give these a &#34;pretty good&#34; rating. Being a photographer with aging eyes in the new world of digital cameras, I was needing reading glasses like these to flip down and quickly check a shot for focus and exposure on the review screen on the back of my Nikon DSLR.  Doing it with regular reading glasses was quite slow, cumbersome and down right aggravating.  This also would cause me to miss some good shots on stage shooting dance and theatre in dark auditoriums.  I had to pad the nose pads a bit to raise up the frames on my head as the frames do not sit quite high enough for my needs but they do flip up and down nicely and quickly and I can keep them on while clicking away towards the stage. I wish they had fine tuning built in so I could custom adjust them to my particular head shape but I did manage to adapt them in the absence of such adjustments.  Anyway, a good value for the price. We'll see how well they wear over time!"
4.0,Very pretty. Not the best quality though.
4.0,"I was given these socks in exchange for thorough testing and review. I was not financially compensated for the production of the review.<br />The fabric is soft and gentle, there are no overwhelming scents in this one. the colors are great but I am not a huge fan of the psychedelic stripes in some of them. The animals are cute and they fit as expected."
4.0,This is a fine pack for the money however the picture implies black clips and accents and they are actually silver.
4.0,Feels like it's a little too snug.  I do love the quality!  Would probably order a size up in the future.
4.0,Beautiful design. Has a good natural weight to it. Can be worn with either side of the symbol being shown. Could be a little larger in diameter.
4.0,"Beautifully made, nice fabric and color. I ordered 1-2 sizes bigger than I normally wear, due to comments, but wished I had just ordered my size. I wish that I had just ordered my size."
4.0,My daughter loves the fabric and color of this sweater! It fits well and is great for lounging or getting a little more dressed up. One negative is that the fabric balls up very quickly - after just a few days of use it already looked 'used.'
4.0,"I give the watch a 4 because the two buttons on the side are just for show and the actual gauges inside the watch do not move, only thing that moves is the date and the time. Nice looking watch either way."
4.0,The material on this is very soft and comfortable. It is a little big in all areas.
4.0,"This was cute! it is fleece, so very warm! But fit as expected, although the hood is a bit loose and the antenna are weirdly attached and sort of flop a bit with the hood."
4.0,Smaller than I thought.  But it is very beautiful
4.0,So far these held-up well. We’ve been to the beach and they have been worn several other times while at the pool. Sizing may be a tad big but acceptable.
4.0,"Best leather affordable leather belt substitute. I've tried a few others and they've all disappointed me enough that I no longer use them. This one I use. Some of the decorative stitching has popped, but it has some flexibility like leather. I would really like to try the upcoming mycelium based products. I think there are a couple of companies working on this. Of course, they may not be within my financial reach, currently."
4.0,I gave this necklace to a visiting student doing research in our lab! It makes for a nice and meaningful gift to remind her fo the lab and her time here.
4.0,Material was heavy for this spring. The detailed embroidery around bottom of dress was beautiful.
4.0,"Although these aren’t the highest quality, for the price they are very trendy now (so I don’t need them to last forever) and they are very lightweight so I can wear them all day. I sometimes get a reaction from metal earrings, but these ones haven’t given me one yet."
4.0,So cute. Doesn't fit the best around my hips but I still give it 4 stars because my hips are probably wider than average... I still wear it around the house and love it!!
4.0,"I don't really know what to think about it yet. On first impression, it's seems cheap, but I guess silk is a very thin material and therefore that's expected. I am really trying make this review fair, because I wasnt impressed with price, it is certainly comfortable to wear. Overnight i actually forgot it was even there. The elastic didn't bother me at night at all. I actually really appreciate how the elastic portion is only in the back under your neck, and not surrounding my face. That can be very uncomfortable at night, so it was smart on their behalf to design it that way.<br /><br />$14 is definitely too much for this, but I guess you are paying for the material alone, 100% silk.  I also want to say, if you have alot of hair, move along, this cap certainly first have room for all that jazz! It's a little small, which I like because my hair is thin.  You definitely would not be able to put your hair in rollers in this thing.<br /><br />Bottom line, functionally, yes I'd purchase the product again, but not for this price."
4.0,"I ordered this for my 9 year old to gift to her after a gymnastics recital. The charms are cute and good quality. The bracelet was too large, and I'm not a fan of the type of bracelet anyhow, so I cut it and put it on a chain. She loves it. I would recommend."
4.0,The tutu was beautiful and very well made. Thank you guys so much. My daughter was every bit of a very happy and fluffy birthday girl.
4.0,"I like these  shorts, just thought there were a little long."
4.0,"I bought these boots in a size 9W originally and they were too big. I returned them and exchanged for a size 8M, my normal size, and they fit just right. I had a similar pair of Totes that I bought years ago in size 8M and they were extremely snug on my feet. I know the Totes brand runs small, but this time my normal size was right on the money. Do be aware that there is no ankle support with these boots. Material around ankle area is not close fitting at all if you have normal sized ankles. I have not worn these out in the snow yet, however, my previous pair did very well at keeping out snow and slush."
4.0,Great product I thought the key organizer would hold more keys than I could actually get into it so I won't be using it but the wallet is great and I will be using that daily
4.0,I'm a short person and the length fit seemed tight. other then that its a great suit.
4.0,Fits well. I really like the design and look of the shirt but it’s made with thin material.
4.0,looks great feels great
4.0,Husband loves this compression shirt except for we didn’t notice the neck doesn’t come up as high as others we’ve ordered. Great shirt will buy again
4.0,"Got here in a moderately good amount of time. Decoration was only on one side of the pendant. Otherwise, pretty sturdy."
4.0,"Live the fabric, it is very soft. Shorts are a little shorter than I would like but overall love them!"
4.0,Nicely made good material
4.0,"A lot smaller than I expected. It’s a gift for my 8 year old. It is cute, the red is a pretty color."
4.0,nice shirt for the money
4.0,"Superb hat, it was tight initially and not sits snug, after all these - years- well, it took kinda long to write this. The sun, sweat, washability, wearability is excellent. Quite a few people recognise it- and for a 'simple' sun hat, thats quite a joy, knowing that you paid premium bucks to get it. The hat keeps the sun out, and is very comfortable-<br />If you want nice, premium... buy this."
4.0,Bought to match ring- very light and simple.
4.0,I got a 3xl because I thought would big on me and I like to wear this type of jacket a little big.
4.0,The material on the bottom feels different that the top which was unexpected but ok<br /><br />Update edit. After 2 washings the bottom black is now gray.  The top is still black
4.0,The shirt fit well but we bought a medium based on the reviews that said it runs small.  My husband normally wears a large or X-large but a medium was a perfect fit for him.  Good quality for the price.
4.0,I use it every day!  I wish it had more pockets.
4.0,got this for a gift and they absolutely loved it.  I was afraid that the quality would be so great but it was good.
4.0,I love this design! My daughters have had several pairs and the quality is amazing. The only problem this time... They were too big!
4.0,Shirts feel and fit great. Feel cool and not too tight or loose either
4.0,Nice thick material fit almost perfect a little small in certain parts. (My boob area and love handles) I ordered a size medium and I am 5'7&#34; 145 lbs cup size 34 D.
4.0,Great fit but the shiny black parts look cheap and not my style.
4.0,"I bought the short sleeved dress in brown. okay fit and the length was to my ankles (I'm 5'1&#34;). EXCEPT the sleeves are too tight around the hem of the sleeve. Up near the shoulder and upper arm they are loose enough. But at the hem of the sleeves it's definitely too tight. I did hem it up to  a few inches below my knees, just to make it fit more dress-like. I love the way it feels: much like muslin.  I took off a star because it has to be hand washed. I'm thinking it would shrink radically if run through a washing machine and dryer. Really, in this day and age these dresses should be machine wash and dry."
4.0,Lounging around house
4.0,This is a very pretty necklace.  It is exactly as shown in the picture.  I haven't had any issues with it.
4.0,"My aunt loves this face shield. The only gripe I have heard is because she is a glass wearer, it can be hard to have this and your glasses on the way it is made. She definitely takes it to work with her still though."
4.0,It cute fit very well
4.0,Fabric does not breath making it hot to wear
4.0,"The product arrived on time however, the material was less quality than I thought; still fits my form. The &#34;buttons&#34; are lower quality and the straps come undone easily...this can be fited with saftey pins. The legs are also wider than pictured (not a huge issue if cuffed)."
4.0,"This review is for the Xenuay Men's Cardigan Sweater Button Down V-Neck Cable Knit Lightweight Slim Fit Casual Knitted Cardigans with Pockets.<br /><br />This sweater came in a plastic pouch.  When you pull it out, you notice the weight.  It's on the heavy side.  It does fit well, and the sleeves are a good length, but when I review the Amazon ad picture, it seems smaller on the guy. The length of the sweater reaches the sleeve length when wearing it.  definitely larger.  But I like it.<br /><br />The material is not the best there is.  For the money, though, it is a good blend and feels good when you wear it.  It's a mixture of cotton and acrylic, so you won't expect to get supper hot in the house.  Just enough to keep the chill-out.  The button holes were not sewn around the hole.  They were first sewn into an uncut material, and the slit was cut, leaving a ""rough"" hole.  This may open up over time, and the button will not stay closed.  The garment is sewn together in regular stitches, so be careful if it starts to unravel.  Repair it right away.  The sleeve openings may enlarge over time.<br /><br />For the money, it's not a bad sweater.  I wouldn't go to an important function with it, but not bad."
4.0,Bought for Christmas present
4.0,Love the skirt however it was a little snug but super cute
4.0,They are very pretty and comfortable. The back stem and the petals were a little bent but nothing's little fixing couldn't solve.
4.0,These are really nice tights. They are perfect in size and are high waisted with good stretch in them. They seem to be very well made and look great on. They would pair well with any type of attire and I think most shoes would look good and fit well. These are not super thick but thick enough that they will keep your legs a little warmer when there is a slight chill in the air. I really like them a lot!
4.0,Awesome product.  Great respirator  Straps could have been a little more quality
4.0,"I love everything about this ring but the center stone. From far away, it looks AMAZING! but the center stone is so big, you can tell it's a total fake. Still fun for costume jewelry, but it doesn't look like the real thing."
4.0,I had a low expectation for these light weight pants when I received them but have come to really like them for walking. They are nothing like &#34;spanx&#34; and I'm not sure why they chose to use that in the title description. They're just thin non-obtrusive 32&#34; inseem pants. They certainly would show underwear lines and have no panty shield so I pair them with a mid-thigh underwear. I think they're a good deal for the price and just hope that the high cotton blend (95% cotton / 5% spandex) holds over time and doesn't pill and shed.
4.0,Not bad for the price.  Now people check to see if they have food in their teeth when I wear them.
4.0,Like it but the arm holes are to big.
4.0,"These watch bands are cute and comfortable! I love sunflowers, so these were a great find."
4.0,"Came fast, great fit. I ordered a small and it fit great. I am a small/medium in women's."
4.0,Very comfy and cute top. I wore a colored tank under mine.
4.0,Runs a bit small but not too much. Pretty comfortable and solid material.
4.0,"I was so excited to get this cardigan. It's long, but not too long, and it's so comfortable. The pockets are a nice touch as well."
4.0,Me gusta el material solo que es un poco ancho en la pantorrilla.
4.0,Warm n very comfy.
4.0,Cute. Looks as pictured
4.0,I thought in reality it wouldn't look as good as it it looks online. but it is as beautiful as it looks in the picture. It took more than a month to reach me though..  :)
4.0,I like the shirt.  The material is heavier than expected but it's a nice shirt.
4.0,beautiful but took months!
4.0,Runs small. Ones I ordered initially were extremely tight. Great colors !!
4.0,It's nice for the price. I'm happy
4.0,"Cute costume. Fit as expected. It came in a shrink wrapped package which made for a lot of work straightening it out. Overall I thought it was a good value. Also, it has several tulle pieces that are white with lots of glitter. I didn't notice it in the photo. Cute but messy. My friend ordered the pink one. Not glitter on that one"
4.0,"The fabric and sewing on this jumpsuit is very low quality. I ordered the rose/pink color and it's see-through because the fabric is so thin and cheap. it's also for very short people.<br /><br />I initially wrote a poor review on this product as seen below. The seller provided excellent customer service by sending me another free jumpsuit. This time I requested a black one. The second jumpsuit sent was much better quality and the black fabric is very soft and not see-through like the rose/prink.  Even the second jumpsuit is however for very short people. I ordered a medium size. I am 5'8"" and 135 lbs- the legs of this jump suit are about 8"" too short. The top and torso section fits just fine- perfect. if you are only 5'0 tall this jumpsuit would be perfect.<br />The jumpsuit is very soft. and the company did provide excellent customer service.<br /><br />Initial Review: The fabric and sewing on this jumpsuit is very low quality. I ordered the rose/pink color and it's see-through because the fabric is so thin and cheap. it's also for very short people. Do not buy this item."
4.0,For 9 dollars this is an ok buy. The glasses feel flimsy but thats alright. The glasses came in a box and a bag. The glasses had some dirt but no scratches. Overall looking foward to wearing them out in the sun.
4.0,Keeps me warmer than a robe!<br />Zipper can be a little tricky though.
4.0,"For reference, I am 5'6&#34; / 36A / ~120 lb and ordered a large (after trying a medium one-piece from this company, which I didn't care for).<br /><br />Pro: Seems very well constructed. The ruching detail on the sides of the bikini bottoms is very cute. It hits me around my navel, which is what I wanted. The waistband isn't tight, but also not too loose. Covers the backside area well.<br /><br />Con: I didn't realize that the top tied both in the back and around the neck. I'm quite paranoid about it coming undone in the water, so I will be sure to enlist a buddy to help double-knot it : )  I'm also rather flat-chested, so it needs to be tied pretty tightly anyway. The cups are lightly padded, and I worried it would look comically large, like I was playing dress-up. When tied appropriately, it is not an issue at all.<br /><br />Overall, I've not yet tried this in the water, but at the very least it is a well-price and very cute suit to wear for poolside lounging : )"
4.0,Needed cases for several pairs of reading glasses that came without cases. These will do the job but... they are constructed out of a heavy felt-like material that is reasonably stiff. Rather that shove the glasses into them I used a TV Remote to loosen and open up the stiff material before actually using for delicate reading glasses.
4.0,"My daughter loves it. However, it would have been better if it had a solid strap. Her hair sometimes gets caught from the chain strap. We might probably buy a strap to replace it with. Good thing the strap is detachable."
4.0,"This tankini is adorable. True to the picture. I am 5'5 wear md/LG shirts and size 5 pants. I ordered a large and it fit perfectly. I did get it missing one of the pads that go in the bustop, I will be emailing customer service and if we can fix this issue I will defiantly change the rating to a 5 star. This is made out of a nice material and it's comfy. It's light weight and covers the areas I want it to cover.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review of it. I do not let a discounted price of any product influence my opinion or views of a product. I was not offered any sort of discount or compensation for a better review. I am not in any way affiliated with this company or Amazon. All of the above opinions are honest and my own."
4.0,I ordered a small and I am a 32B and 25 in pants. The top was perfect but for the bottom it was just a tad bit small. I still wore it of course! Please note the bottom shows a lot of booty.
4.0,"I have to admit I was quite skeptical because of the price, but it’s darling on and fits nicely.  The quality is so-so, but it’s so flattering I was amazed.  The bolero is too boxy but I don’t plan on wearing it.  I was very satisfied with the dress."
4.0,I got it for my husband. He said it was too slim for him and not able to wear it. He gave it to our adult son who can wear it and likes it.
4.0,Nice looking earrings they are a gift for my daughter.
4.0,"Pretty cute. True to size, ordered a size up but didn't need to."
4.0,Daughter like them
4.0,"I wear 32D- 34A. I normally wear size small in sports bras, but in some brands XS fits me better. I ordered size XS and it is incredibly tight! It fits me like an XXS. Even if I had ordered size small it would have been too tight as well. I should have got a medium.<br /><br />I didn't want to give this bra a bad star rating just because of the sizing issue. It is actually a beautiful and very well made sports bra. It has thick bands and provide great support. The fabric is soft but not stretchy, so depending on your bra size get one or two sizes bigger."
4.0,Good value and authentic
4.0,"It's good for the price. The only thing is that you have to be careful with the belt, it has to be tight, otherwise it will deflate."
4.0,Chic keychain. Very pleased with the purchase.
4.0,Comfortable! A little bit on the small side...
4.0,"I've seen these all over Facebook so I thought I'd try it. These worked the first two times I used them, but I didn't follow directions exactly. You're supposed to make sure to use them right after a shower, but I didn't. I'd give 5 stars because they do seem to work, despite my order terror.  But I'm big on things being convenient, but having to wash before EVERY time you wear them is pretty unrealistic for women."
4.0,Very cute.  Can't wait tho wear it
4.0,Good this for my hubby he loves it. The only problem when he wore the black cap to bed the blackish blueish color would bleed out on the pillows and bedsheets wherever he later his had at there was marks. I would recommend washing it at least 2-3 times before wearing it to bed.
4.0,I use it as an everyday pullover when hanging around the house. Very warm and comfortable.
4.0,"Love it, but wish the detailing was little more defined."
4.0,"I was really impressed with this jacket for the price I paid.  To order the size I read a lot of the reviews on this shirt and how it fit on other people. Typically I am a small/medium 34DD, I stand at 5'7 1/2, at about 130-135 pounds, and typically wear a size 4 in pants. I usually order medium size tops but, the medium I ordered was a little bit snug. If I put both my arms out in front of me I could feel the tightness in the fabric and I also could barley get the lapel's of the jacket to touch in my midsection. To be comfortable, I think a Large would fit better. I will have to return the jacket and get a size large, but overall it is a very nice jacket."
4.0,"I love this, it is very well made, comfortable, and the material is good quality. 4 stars because it shows sweat very badly... embarrassing to admit."
4.0,"Not really burgundy, more red than the picture leads one to believe."
4.0,I just want compression socks that fit a wider calf and that doesn't have a huge foot. These are great. Thick good quality socks. I have not washed them yet so we will see how they turn out.
4.0,Live the style.<br />Band broke after a couple of months.
4.0,"This was a really pretty ring and the stone wasn't too big or too small. I didn't ""read"" into the process of how it is made blue until I received the ring. When I received the ring, the stone isn't very shiny or sparkly as in you really couldn't tell that it was supposed to be somewhat see through. It's a really dark blue to where it makes the stone nearly opaque. Yes, I'm aware that blue sapphire is much darker than lab created sapphire. After reading the process of how this one is turned blue, I realized this wasn't my cup of tea. The delivery was very fast. The ring came in a nice box. The metal and size were dead on. I would buy from this seller again, but I'd probably buy a different stone or buy the lab created blue sapphire."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, soft fabric! It just runs a little bigger than expected. The tie that goes around the dress is hard to unwrinkle/iron after washing as well."
4.0,feels great. make sure you put the bands on the right way because they are a real pain to remove compared to the stock ones
4.0,"I don't like that it stands a little tall and the front has a built in support making it stiff.<br />Nice color, nice texture of the material. Logo is awesome."
4.0,"It fits as expected and is very elegant but I don't give 5 stars because of the zipper. The zipper gave us hard time to pull it up, it got stuck on the waistline. We had to look in youtube and tried different things. It took us like 3 days until we made it go all the way up. I was about to return it but decided to keep trying."
4.0,"Fairly easy to attach to your socks and are meant to stay attached. They’re not designed to be removed prior to wearing. I can’t feel them at all while wearing. I make it a point to snap the socks together upon removing. They stay together without issues in the washing and drying process. They can be somewhat difficult to get separated prior to wearing. That’s getting better with practice. Overall, these sock snaps are working well for my needs."
4.0,"Really like this hat and it does deserve 5 stars except that I need just a little smaller size.  I have been able to adjust it so that it works but it is at the max it can go.  I ordered the small, it is true to size, I just have a small head!"
4.0,"I got exactly what I needed and what I was looking for, a cute simple choker for fun nights out. I also feel I have a very small neck as other ""tight"" necklaces/chokers are loose on me and do not fit the way I like. These are very short and fitting around my neck, which I absolutely love! And if I gain weight they are adjustable so I can just make them bigger :)"
4.0,"These are cute shorts. The stitching in the back is scratchy, like a nylon or something. I’m 5’2, 130lbs, with a larger bottom and thighs and I ordered the size 8. Fits good."
4.0,it looks exactly like it does in the pictures! it also comes extremely fast! i was pleasantly surprised! picking out the fabrics for the bows and socks was easy! only complaint is that my dress came a bit too big than the measurements i sent. but I can easily fix it. myself! id recommend this to anyone!!!
4.0,Dress is very much like the picture.  The fabric is a bit stiff and scratchy.
4.0,"Product runs on the small side, but very nice, very cute. I gave it away to a friend and she loves it!"
4.0,I am 5'5.  And 145lbs.  I ordered an xl.  It fit perfectly after I took the wire out of the top.  I have A cup breasts so extra support isn't needed and they were kinda stabbing me.
4.0,Nice necklace but colors were wrong for what I needed
4.0,Love the print and it was very flattering all. The only thing I did not like was the belt around the waist.
4.0,I love these earrings I think they're very cute and for the price you really can't go wrong.
4.0,I bought the charm because there's not a lot of good bracelets that show I crochet and knit so even though I was explaining to get the crochet I still really like the knitting charm too.
4.0,Love this look!! But a bit snug around my boobs
4.0,"It fit my frame really well, the fabric was thinner than I expected but breathable for the summer months. The length was shorter than I expected, barely past the thighs, but I can make it work. The only downsize was that as soon as I tried it, one of the straps broke. Nothing that can be fixed with a needle but they are really flimsy. Except for that, really satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,The material was good. Didn’t like everything being connected. You should be able to put the gloves on separate. And the hood pc should of been just 1 zipper instead of two. But overall the costume was a good fit very true to size.
4.0,"I like the boots. I ordered them a size larger than I wear, because of the comments I read. Even at one size up, there is no extra room. So maybe two sizes up would be better."
4.0,"This is a lovely dress and I was so excited to receive it.  I'm 5'8"" and weigh 142 lbs. so ordered a medium.  The deal breaker was that this dress was not knee length as described.  It was way too short so I had to reluctantly return it."
4.0,"The design is very cute, exactly as pictured. I wish the fabric had a little more give to it, I think that would make it a little more comfortable. Overall I think it’s a great mask"
4.0,Love it. Wear it for dressier occasions. Looks high end
4.0,"Why all reviews are for some kind of sleepers or sneakers,these are work boots. What is going on?"
4.0,I love the glasses and I would have gave 5 stars but I received the glasses without a case and with out any bubble wrap just a plastic zip bag. Glasses fit my small head tight and don’t slip off.
4.0,"Nice material, good quality, size runs slightly small.  Good value."
4.0,They fit as expected and for the price these flip flops are not bad.
4.0,It arrived before the expected time which is great! The color is as bright as shown in the picture (i got the red one). My qualm is that becuase of my extra curves (cursed blessing i guess XD)  it rides up higher than even shown deapite being Xl.... but that makes it sexier for the bf 😉
4.0,I used it for a 70s party.
4.0,Very soft and perfect fit
4.0,"I decided last minute to add this outfit to my hospital bag, the shirt was nice and long , and the pants were nice and soft. After washing them once the color on the pants did bleed out a lot."
4.0,"seems well made and did its job as intended (keeping the sun out of my eyes)  However, when I put in on backwards to be like one of the &#34;cool&#34; group, I noticed that I start to say, think, and do stupid things.  AND I had to wear sunglasses and shield my eyes with my hand from the sun."
4.0,"Great belt, just make sure you trim the excess!"
4.0,"The bag came fast (without Prime shipping!). The color is a pale pink not bright like pictured (thank God!). To describe it as a ""hobo"" is a long shot-the handle is too short. I wish it would have came with a longer clip on strap. This bag is huge! If you don't like big bags then this is not for you. I love big bags and I think once I waterproof it it will darken and age beautifully! A great investment at a super price. I would have given it 5 starts if the handle had been longer."
4.0,A little big on my head but otherwise I think it’s a very cute hat!
4.0,"Dress is so cute and it's decent on quality the inside drees was a little too big but nothing to worry about .otherwise love the dress,dont think it's the best for well dotated big breast but check the size chart"
4.0,"This is a nice comfortable pullover hoodie sweatshirt. It fits comfortably enough and seems to run just about as expected. It has drawstrings for the hoodie and a nice big kangaroo pocket in the front. The material is semi soft and the sweatshirt itself is about mid-weight.<br />This would go so well with a great pair of jeans, and who doesn't love a to pair a cute hoodie with a cute pair of jeans? Perfection!"
4.0,Sadlly they do not stretch enough in length so I can't use them.  I was thrilled to find these as they were less expensive and sheerer than the ones I buy now.  If they were just longer I could use them.
4.0,For price will deal with it.
4.0,But material seems like it's rubbing off the dress making it look like those lint beads that you put certain materials in the dryer.
4.0,"It's not as bright as I would have liked but its. Good size, looks sturdy. Fits pandora bracelet no issues<br /><br />Keep you posted<br /><br />Update: months later charm is still great no gems missing.  The only issue i have is the trunk occasionally snagging on things"
4.0,"Cute, but super short."
4.0,"Just like many review I would not depend on too much on key chain, but it is extra, only thing I have complaint is it only permits limited card but obviously it states it only can hold 4 cards so nothing against. Magnet it definitely strong don't put it in your right pocket when you walk by your car it will definitely stick to your car"
4.0,good value for the price!
4.0,"The reviews that it runs small are right, it does.  But also remember, the generous lacing in the back allows for as much expansion as you want. Order by measurements.  Good quality for the price."
4.0,"Good for the price, had some loose threads. No frills, gets the job done when a black tie is needed"
4.0,"I bought this along with several other rather  inexpensive jewelry pieces to give away to my lady barber, hair stylist, nieces and grand nieces and female friends just to make them happy. The quality is fairly good for the  price and it came quickly considering some pieces were shipped from Hong Kong. Overall, I am satisfied with this particular ankle bracelet or anklet."
4.0,"Although it feels really light and cheap, it is a great watch. The compass works like a charm. I thought it would have been a little heavier, but it is really light.<br /><br />The ONLY issues that I have with this watch are:<br /><br />1. The LCD screen is a bit dim unless you are in a bright room during the day.<br /><br />2. The backlight lasts only 3 seconds regardless what mode you are in. There should be an option to make this a little longer.<br /><br />Overall however, I really like the look and it keeps time really well. The line around the edge of the watch, counting down the seconds (when in time mode or in stop-watch mode) is really neat.<br /><br />Display is large enough so that you know what information you are looking at.<br /><br />If they could make the information on the LCD display a bit darker and make the backlight last about 5 seconds instead of 3, that would make this watch a 5-star worthy product.<br /><br />Can't really complain for the price point though."
4.0,"The leggings are nice, thick and soft on the inside, keep you warm when layered beneath pants, I wouldn't wear them alone as they wouldn't be warm enough for the Michigan cold and I believe they are meant to be layered since the seems on the crotch are pretty unflattering on their own and they have heel holes to keep them in place when you're pulling your pants over them. Would have been a 5 star review but I feel the sizing is a little off I'm 5'1 and 160 lbs and i got a medium because that was the biggest size they had and because it listed the weight range was up 176 lbs for a medium (also the pictures show a bigger girl than me wearing them) but I do fit in them however it's pretty tight and I feel my movement it somewhat restricted in them, not sure if they will loosen up with wear and not be so uncomfortably tight but I would size up if you can. Overall they seem durable, and they keep me warm at work I just can't do anything that requires excessive mobility."
4.0,Top was way too large for my 13 year old
4.0,Runs slightly Large. Great quality and stretch is amazing.
4.0,I can only really wear these on my middle and ring fingers but honestly I don't really mind that...they're very fun to wear and always generate some sort of reaction/conversation. :)
4.0,"This is a bit longer than expected. I'm 5'2&#34; and its almost mid thigh. To me it runs a bit large, I am returning for a size down."
4.0,Well made. Attractive shoe. Lacking comfort in that inner sole feels thin. Good value.
4.0,Love love love Have purchased another color
4.0,Love her tops but runs very small
4.0,Super cute! Great quality! I would order more!!
4.0,material nice. Not as oversized as I thgouht it would be. Nearer to a reg fit.
4.0,Great. Fit over glasses great.
4.0,"this is the classic G-Unit tank top it’s not the softest, but it fit snug and stretch as well."
4.0,Got this for my niece I did order a 4t due to reviews saying it was a little small she just turned 3 and it fit her perfect!
4.0,Material is thinner than I expected.  Swimsuit was worth the price.
4.0,"Love the jeans and Amazon but they run small, but they look great"
4.0,"The headband is small, child sized i would say. So if you’re an adult, it’ll be a bit snug. The necklace and mask however, will be just fine! Just what I needed for my cat woman costume."
4.0,The strap leather seems like decent quality and it is well put together for the price. The only gripe is that the buckle is plastic. I suppose it may be asking a lot of it to be metal at this price point but thought I'd mention it since it was not mention anywhere on the product page.
4.0,"These are a nice pair of socks for cooler weather.  They are comfortable to wear and look good (for whatever that's worth--they're socks after all).  But as for them being ""cold weather"" socks, I'd prefer them to be a little warmer than they are.  The manufacturer claims they're 28% wool, 51.9% polyester, 3% Spandex,17.1% nylon.  If you're going to be out doing winter sports like skiing and snowboarding (as the socks are advertised for), then you might want something a little thicker and warmer than these.  For people who just want some warmer socks for daily use in the winter, these are just fine.  But for winter adventures in the snow, I'll probably reach for something else."
4.0,"Es delgada , pensé que era más gruesa pero está muy padre el diseño"
4.0,"This bikini is perfect for spring break because it's super cheap. The only down side is that there is no padding in the top, so your nips are visible if they're hard. I just slipped a piece of padding from another bathing suit in and that seems to work fine (but there is not a place to insert it, so I might get some fabric glue or something to attach it so it doesn't fall out). It feels pretty cheaply made, so I'm not going to do a lot of activity in the bikini. it's more of a lounge around in the sun type of bikini."
4.0,"I really like this dress, but it is so long! I usually wear a large but ordered a medium according to the measurements. I am busty and generally need to size up. The overall fit is good but it drags the ground. I am 5’4. I have to tie it up so I don’t trip. If you are taller you will love it!"
4.0,"This is a cute, breezy, little dress. It doesn't cling to your body. It hangs beautifully and flowy. The arm holes are perfect. They don't hang and aren't too tight. Bra straps do not show at all.<br /><br />I am 5'6&#34;, 170lbs, 38 D. I also have a long torso and  long legs. I purchased size XL just in case it was sized smaller.! The dress hits just above my knees. Not so long that it's an awkward length. It's just perfect for breezy days outside or even for a trip the beach, which is what I purchased it for - beach trip. I purchased the color that appears to be an Army Green color or some sort of green. However, the dress is BROWN NOT GREEN AT ALL. Not even kinda sorta green if you wink your left eye and tilt your head to the side. It's still BROWN. DEFINITELY BROWN. DARK BROWN. I wouldn't have purchased this color had I known it was nothing close to what it appeared to be as far as color goes. I'm not into a little brown dress. BUT, I've decided to keep it because of the way it looks on a thick body, the way it feels on the skin, as well as some great ideas I've come up with to wear it that I'll share below.<br /><br />I do feel very comfortable in this dress. I could've probably gone down a size, but I'm happy with the way it fits a little looser so I'm not self conscious about my little extra tummy. Yet it's not so loose that it makes me look like I'm wearing a big sack or moo-moo. You still have your curves and don't look huge! This is definitely a great little dress for ladies with curves!<br /><br />I wash the dress turned inside out by itself or with a few pieces that are similar material or colors. I was on delicate with cold water only. I DO NOT WASH THIS WITH ANYTHING THAT MAY SHED to avoid pilling on the fabric. I usually toss it in the dryer on AIR DRY (no heat) for about 10-15 minutes. Then i lay it across a bar stool or my couch to let it air dry. I don't want to hang it and have the straps stretch too much. It dries VERY quickly. I either fold it or hang it depending on how soon I plan on wearing it again. I will wrinkle a bit when folded but the wrinkles fall out EASILY if thrown into the dryer for a few minutes on AIR DRY. There is no reason to iron it. And honestly it can be worn without air drying it at all because the wrinkles fall out of this fabric so often.<br /><br />All in all I like the dress. I'm just not wild about the color. I can work around the brown by wearing it with a long necklace that hangs pretty low along with some other boho style jewelry (leather strap bracelets that wrap around your wrists or leather bracelets that snap) along with sandals. I've also thought ahead to fall and thought this would be so cute with one of those large &#34;blanket&#34; type scarves. I have one that's a cream color with some large plaid. I think this would look darling using a similar scarf or any coordinating large scarf with tall boots and some tights. Another fall look could be a chunky cardigan along with tights and tall boots that says &#34;I just threw this on and still look cute&#34;. It could also be paired with a short denim jacket for an easy, trendy look. This drew would also look great with some funky, fall, Aztec patterned leggings. I'm actually going to start looking for some now!<br /><br />Those are just some ideas for small accessories and basic shoes most everyone has or can find easily, and pretty cheap, that could change this dress to make this a darling, versatile piece that can be worn many different ways.<br /><br />Overall, for this price and the various ways to turn this simple dress into so many different looks its ABSOLUTELY worth every penny. I may purchase this in another color. I definitely recommend this to busty ladies (its not tight across the chest at all and not baggy). It's also great for curvy or thick ladies.?<br /><br />I do advise using the size chart in order to get the correct size. Nobody asked me to write this review. Nobody gave me this dress to write a review. Nobody gave me a discount to write this review. I purchased the dress myself and this is truly my honest opinion about it."
4.0,Definitely order a size up. Runs a tad small. Bought 2 different sizes for different people both are just a tad snug.
4.0,This 100% silk shirt shipped sooner than expected. It fits perfectly and the pattern colors very closely match the illustration. The only downside is that it was shipped in a bubble wrap envelope so it will take a while for the folds in the shirt to come out. I will hang it in my bathroom and the steam from the shower should do the trick.
4.0,"Beautiful trim line, easy to customize fit to your wrist and keep accurate time.<br />Love it."
4.0,I bought this piece of jewelry to go with a halloween costume but I wear all the time.  It is pretty.
4.0,Good for what it is but the light is vey dim.
4.0,"It's wonderful and soft, you could easily make it if you have the patience. It looks just like the picture. smells funny though"
4.0,"Love this purse. Bought because we were going to a baseball game and they have purse size restrictions in place, but I haven't stopped using it. I generally carry ALOT of stuff with me in a big purse, but this guy forces me to trim way down and really only carry what I need. Plus, the cross body strap allows me to keep my hands free to carry more important things...like my nephews without doing the purse juggle dance. The one hiccup with this purse is the clasp, it can be a bit finicky about lining up and clicking shut, but once you get used to it, it's fine. Great find, so glad I got it."
4.0,"Offered as ""free returns"" but when I tried to return its charging me 3.33 for a label.  Shirt is gigantic, cannot be worn. Not a great experience<br /><br />Updated-  LaRage shirts has been really great and has refunded the cost of the return label I was charged for.  Theyve had great communication, and I really appreciate it!!"
4.0,Cute and pretty. Fits as expected maybe just a lil on the smaller side. I'll let you know if it's still the same aftrr washing.<br />Update: slightly shrunk after dryer. Try avoiding putting it in the dryer.
4.0,"Fits like a glove.Material is not to thick or thin. Can't wait to wear it. I may add a nice jeweled belt to add some bling and some bling or clear heels . Purchased in a size medium(my stats 5'2"" 155 lbs). I'm not very curvy but this dress with the right under garments that lifts and tucks in all the right places with do the trick."
4.0,"This is a wonderful hat to have if you love the series! Very spacious and comfortable to wear! The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that all the logos and insignias are not sewn on but pasted on somehow. It makes the designs not as bolstered and it even looks like it starts to wear out quicker than other, more durable means. That aside, a magnificent buy!"
4.0,"I really like the fact that I have options to switch my wedding band up from time to time. Great ring, great bargain."
4.0,I love the color of this top. It fits a little loose for me. I tend to wear xs in most tops. The V is a little more open than I anticipated per the model pictured. I would suggest wearing a camisole underneath. Overall it’s still comfortable to wear with sweats or jeans.
4.0,They are warm and great but sizing is a little small in length
4.0,This hat does not fit like a bucket.  It was too large for my head but the hat is of good quality .
4.0,Did not give me allergic reaction. Smaller than I thought
4.0,the only reason I’m not giving it a 5 Star is because the colors are not the same as the picture and they run a little big other than that they are beautiful and they feel really soft
4.0,Odd material I think polyester? I guess I didn't read it to find out. Fits well. Comfy . Keeping it.
4.0,Ordered one to try and fits like a medium gave to my daughter
4.0,Very nice but way too big. Had to return
4.0,Delivered quickly. Fit correctly. Comfortable. Good price.  Can’t ask for more
4.0,This was perfect and will grow with my daughter. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the color was a lottle off.
4.0,I liked this band and had a lot of compliments. I wore it most of December and by the end a lot of the red had rubbed off underneath. But for the price I call that a win!
4.0,Very cute dress light but the material makes it so that it's not see through. Can be dressed up with a cute heel or boo  or dressed down with a fun pair of tennies.  I really like and am happy with the fit the quality and comfort of the material.
4.0,"Love the color, but too short in length.  Very spongy feeling when you walk, so if you prefer a more rigid base (ie.dansko) you won't like these."
4.0,I loved this shirt when I saw it and had to purchase it for my daughter.  My only complaint is that the material is a bit thinner than I thought it would be.  It's very cool though.  The colors are vivid and it's very unique.
4.0,Love the shirt but it was slightly to small
4.0,I ordered this for my wife and it delivered on time and it looks really great.
4.0,I love this sweater it's adorable and it fits well. I'm a kinda big girl so I ordered a 3x it fit perfect. It is light weight so you can wear it when it's a little chilly but I wouldn't count on it to keep you very warm. I would purchase again.
4.0,My only issue with the watch is the band.  It does not go through the clasp very easily as it is just a bit too wide.  I love the watch face and the color combination.
4.0,Real cool watch. It looks great for the price
4.0,Great product.  Looks and feels great.
4.0,"The thickness is good for fall, spring and summer.  Not winter."
4.0,I honestly loved it and I was a bit scared it wouldn’t fit right but i love how it looks in the front. however it is a bit to short for my liking in the back but that’s the only issue i have with it other then that loved it.
4.0,I really like these boots<br />Got a lot of compliment the first time I wore them<br />They don't keep feet warm so you need padding and warm socks<br />I wore them for 10 hours and my feet hurt when I got home. But I work in health care and never sit<br />So hey aren't built for all day wear<br />But they are very nice and seem sturdy<br />Just need to use insoles and wool socks
4.0,It leaves marks from being too small
4.0,"This bralette is nice, lightweight and comfortable. The only thing that would make it better is if it were made in a micro fiber material."
4.0,"These are all metal and wood, no idea why some reviews were claiming plastic. Out of the box I had one almost worthless and one that didn’t work at all. Luckily the problem and fix was simple, take the screw out of the side and just shave a little more wood out of the taper. Why the factory couldn’t come up with a better simple jig for drilling out the main hole is mind blowing.<br /><br />None the less I would certainly buy this product again if needed. You get two of them for a lot less than others are selling just one for, and despite having to whittle out just a little more wood from the center they work just as well and do exactly the same thing as the expensive ones. Since it includes two you can do both shoes at the same time, rather than one shoe for 24 hours, then the other shoe 24 hours later while the first shoe is shrinking back to its original size.<br /><br />1) Order yourself a course piece of sandpaper with these.<br />2) Take the screw out the side (don’t lose the nut).<br />3) Sand out some of the bevel in the wood that the adjustment tip slides up on and a little more at the very tip for the tip of the shaft.<br />4) They’ll work great unless you go insane with over tightening them on the first use."
4.0,Daughter love for her daily use.
4.0,"Nice fabric. Doesn't wrinkle. Unique color could be a bit hard finding shirts, tops to match. They were in my color pallet."
4.0,Color bueno tamaño bueno solo un poco pesado pero lindo
4.0,"The bows are a bit too feminine on a pirate costume, but the hat held its shape and I was very pleased with the accessory for my female pirate costume."
4.0,2nd one I have  owned .  Watch is great.  Band is rubber that cracks and separates.
4.0,Good piece for regular use on that price. get it
4.0,"but they were so cheap, and other reviewers warned of the same thing, so I was sort of expecting it. Kids find these pretty entertaining"
4.0,My sister and I wore these for a Christmas run. The hats are thin so we pinned them to our heads so they wouldn't fall off when we were running. Good for the price.
4.0,"Nice looking and comfortable. We ordered one large, two extra-large, and one 2XL, for my quartet. We wound up returning the 2XL and trading for another large, as two of us needed to go a size smaller. They honored our need, though, with no problems."
4.0,Just what my son wanted.  Good quality.
4.0,"Ordered a short sleeve dress from same place and loved it. Figured sizing would be consistent, but this cut is much smaller"
4.0,"Great fit and feel...and do what they are designed to do. Over time there has been some shrinkage which makes them more difficult to get on. However, they still have good compression."
4.0,My son complained it was putting to much pressure on his ears. I think if his frames were not so thick these would have worked better. Other than that it was really good quality.
4.0,"I was drawn to these earrings because I'm a music teacher.  I like the fact that they are long, but they are not heavy.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because one earring needs to be a backwards<br />G clef. Most people wouldn't care about that."
4.0,The green and red combo did not look like the picture. They are more of a highlighter yellow and pink.
4.0,Love the fit of these workout pants! I have another pair and they fit just like all of my expensive ones! Only reason I took a star away is because I ordered a pair of the “olive” color and they are dark grey and not green at all.
4.0,"I love this bathing suit, but unfortunately my top was too small."
4.0,I really liked this shirt it was better quality than I had imagined and super flattering I would purchase again
4.0,"Great value.  It fits me well.  100% cotton, material is a tiny bit but comfortable when I wear it.  I already bought a second pack."
4.0,"Love the style...Love the shoe...the 'width' could be just a smidge tighter but the wear was great. 9 hr work day and no sore feet, ankles or arches. I would definitely but this brand again. If only the shipping time was not so lengthy and the shipping was available with Prime. The shipping cost and 2-3 week shipping on some of the other styles is the main thing keeping me from ordering again and the 4 stars. Other than that... no real complaints"
4.0,Tiny but my six year old granddaughter wears on her pinky.
4.0,"Solid colors, cute caricatures."
4.0,"Satisfied, my daughter loves it and it fits har perfect, she is 7yrs old but I ordered her a size 8-9"
4.0,this real small and i had to return it
4.0,"the quality and detail is good, and it comes with a felt bag so it seems like an item that has been cared for. however, each pin is about the size of my thumb."
4.0,"I love the look and style of this dress. It made me feel sexy... maybe because of the lace. It is form fitting and does have stretch. However, I did have to return it because it wasn't true to size and they did not have the next size up in the black, which is what I preferred. I will warn you, although I didn't notice it in my interior lighting when I tried it on, this dress is VERY see through, even with the built-in liner. I held it up about 15 feet from my TV and could watch a football game without missing anything on the screen. Regardless, I would recommend this dress. Just wish my size was available in black!"
4.0,Picture is spot on. Like it a lot.
4.0,"I'm a petite size 4 and this fits almost perfectly. The waistband isn't too loose or tight; but, this definitely wouldn't be comfortable to wear if I wasn't so petite. The fabric is kind of like vintage polyester, kind of scratchy and thin. It's not bad wearing it, but something to keep in mind if that bothers you. I'll probably go ahead and buy a few other colors since this is exactly the type of piece that lets this northern girl survive living in the south."
4.0,"The band seems to slip a lot, however it is comfortable. Much more so than the plastic band that came with the watch"
4.0,Very good quality and quick to wear after unpacking from suitcase.  Comfortable and easy to wash and wear.
4.0,Color is slightly richer than picture.  Didn’t have the cross detail on the pocket like the photo. Light weight. Fits nice.  Delivered quicker than expected.
4.0,This dress is cute and casual.
4.0,"It is a beautiful dress, the fabric is a bit tighter than expected. But not tight that you can't walk just the material. Looks just like the picture and doesn't bring out the tummy as other people hinted at."
4.0,"Nice fit.  The waist is a little bulky with all the gathers, but it is nice material.  I think she will like it."
4.0,Bought these as a cheap carry on that could later be packed in my main suitcase. They did fine but the stitching started to tear on both of the before the 2 week trip was up.
4.0,"I am a 38DD: I ordered the large, baby blue, tan and black. It fits well, but does not supply enough support for anything outside of cleaning, yoga, walking. The fabric is very comfortable and breaths nicely. The nipple pads are very thick, but do not supply adequate coverage (really odd), I promptly removed them. Over all, I'll be using this in the privacy of my home, for light yoga and house work. Still on the prowl for something to tame the girls."
4.0,LOVe this hat! Obviously it looks a little strange to be so covered up if you’re going to be in the sun this will definitely protect you.
4.0,A very cute gift but this will have to be worn every once in a while. The bracelet eventually broke.
4.0,This belt doesn’t look or feel cheap.  The length is good and the buckle I own fits.  If I could change one thing it would be the feel of the leather.  I would rather the leather be softer.
4.0,This shirt was so very cute and looked great on my little guy at his feat birthday party!!! It does run slightly large so if you have a petite baby keep that in mind!
4.0,"These earrings are as lovely as the other reviews say.  They are sparkly, well made, and a beautiful addition to anyone's jewelry collection.  They also are a nice size, not tiny like the last pair of earrings I ordered from this seller and landed up returning. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the color is not as depicted.  They are a light pink which I am very happy with but not the same as their picture."
4.0,"These shorts are cute!  They fit exactly as expected and look just as they do in the picture.  Overall, I got these to use as cute PJ shorts, as that is what the fabric and look of them suggests to me, so that is how I will review them.<br /><br />The fabric is soft--no the best quality, but good enough that it doesn't feel like cheap cloth and uncomfortable.  The pattern is a soft blue with black-outlined white flowers.  Feminine and pretty.  The bow is as pictured as well and is a nice touch.  As mentioned, the fit is as expected, with no weird excess of lack of fabric in the wrong places.  It's not too short, but also not baggy.  The colors haven't seemed to fade and no pilling in the fabric with washing as of yet.<br /><br />Overall, cute PJ shorts.  4/5 stars."
4.0,Size is a bit small but nice material. feels like silk. Good quality.
4.0,Nice shades... give you that rich look
4.0,"Just as described. Quality rain gear. Jacket only. Fortunately I haven't had to wear it for rain yet but I have worn it as a wind breaker.  Hood rolls up and stores in collar, Has thumb ring to keep sleeves down. No complaints."
4.0,"this is def one of those dresses made cheap with only polyester, i have only worn this dress once its not one of my favorites the sleeves are super cute tho."
4.0,My son loved the hat
4.0,The product is very nice for not being leather and all my cards fit just fine. I hope it will be durable  but so far I am very pleased with the wallet.
4.0,This set looks like real amber. Its bulky and well made. Sits nice on your neck. For some reason I accidently ordered 2 sets. As the price was right I gave away the 2nd set.  The gift was well received. In going to order a bracelet to complete my set. Came quickly.  Nice buy.
4.0,i want to dress in winter
4.0,A beautiful piece of jewelry for such a great price. I wear it every chance i get. but the chain is very cheap.
4.0,The shoulder straps are great for a curvier girl.  The color is as shown.  The material is thin and wrinkles.  Overall it looks cute on and is a good deal!
4.0,I like very dark lenses
4.0,"I bought this for my 6 year old nephew.  It arrived very quickly and was exactly as pictured and described.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I didn't feel right as the product is a vinyl type material and even though it seemed to be well made, I know  it's meant more to satisfy a kids need to have a suitcase they are super excited about versus a sturdy functional suitcase that will last a long time.  I was pleased with the product and delivery and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Ninjago kids suitcase that can be taken for sleepovers etc."
4.0,"Love it, so cute, exactly like the pictures. Only reason it got a 4/5 stars is because it DOESN'T have pockets like described. I think only certain colors do."
4.0,A little tall but still good
4.0,"After 14 months of regular use, the belt seams are starting to give and both sides are beginning to separate.<br /><br />I like the look.  Wear it with jeans or dress clothes.  The buckle is good.  Easy to reverse.  Better than previous reversible belts I've owned.<br /><br />For the price, this is a solid buy.  Disappointed it is starting to break down after 14 months of almost daily use."
4.0,"Love the quality and design, just wish it expanded slightly wider, but otherwise it's great."
4.0,Cute but some earrings were too big for a child to wear.
4.0,I bought these  for my son and I guess I ordered the wrong size. I already took off the tags and never had a chance to return them. They look and feel amazing. I just wish that he could have used them. I guess I could wait a few years and they'll be good for my younger son to wear. They're a size 5 boys youth and my youngest is a size 12/13 toddler. That's awhile. sweet_pea_801@yahoo.com<br />The only reason I gave a 4 star is because he never got to try them on.
4.0,I wear these all the time. perfect for working out or just to run errands in.
4.0,"Only had wides available, but I ordered them and I wear normals I'll make them work. They are beautiful."
4.0,"I like wearing this bracelet.  It's adorable and makes me felt good wearing it.  The other thing I would say is that the gold seems a little fake looking.  But overall, it's good and I will continue to wear it."
4.0,Absolutely love it. Beautiful. Only flaw is it’s SUPER see thru! That’s why I gave it 4 stars. But nothing a slip underneath won’t fix. Can’t wait to get out of quarantine and wear it on a date with my bf. Also I ordered a size 8 and I’m 5’4 145lbs.
4.0,"Fits good, looks good"
4.0,"Comfortable, great fabric. Happy with purchase"
4.0,Good mask fits large head/face well. I hand wash it and this is the second mask the emblem fell off immediately
4.0,"For the price, this is one of the most comfortable thong underwear I've worn. I have a 32 waist and it fits nicely. But, you know chinese manufacturing standards can be virtually nonexistant in cheap production products so it worked well for me. Just wash in a lingerie wash bag and air dry and it will hold up well. I'll be getting more of these soon."
4.0,I wish the shirt was longer but slimmer..it's a Lil loose but both long enough..but still cute shirt
4.0,the watch looks good but it cane to me and it Didn't work but it had the look in wanted
4.0,"I actually purchase a large, however I wear medium and it came has expected large. My best advise to buy your fit."
4.0,Loved my set of HBY Women belt set!! Well worth the price!
4.0,My wife likes them. They look good. I would recommend if you are looking for this type of stud earring.
4.0,It fits  and the materials is soft
4.0,"Great hat, smaller bill (which I like), super-light and comfortable; runs a little big.  Really nice to be able to fold the bill and stick it in your pocket."
4.0,"I’m an adult woman the smaller side who uses this with my Alta HR.  It works well, but I didn’t give it five stars because the parts that attach directly to the Fitbit looked gray in the listing, but are actually snow white."
4.0,"This band exceeded my expectations. It has held up well so far and the clasp is 100% reliable up to this point. It is a little light for my taste.<br />I bought this band for my Moto 360 2nd get, it is a little brighter finish than the watch but it isn't noticeable."
4.0,"I ordered an XL, I'm really a medium. It's huge on me. I love it. Print is smaller than shown on the front.  The back looks great, the photo is about 8 by 6 inches big, the letters kind of look like they have glitter on them if you look close at them."
4.0,A little smaller than I like but other than that they're nice sunglasses
4.0,Fits nicely... would be good to be able specify pants length.
4.0,I absolutely love these sunglasses the fit is perfect ... Living in the Caribbean the protection and coverage from the sun is exceptional...
4.0,Love the design and the fabric of the blouse but not so much on the skirt. But over all it's great! Affordable
4.0,Just wish more sizes and colors were available
4.0,"The neoprene skin case I bought for the player is so so cool.  It looks completely different from all the other case styles I see out there everyday.  It goes very well with my black mp3 player and feels special to the touch.  The only issue I have with it is that the plastic see thru part that covers the screen is a little dented.  I think it happened when I took it to Rocky Point and had a few too many Dos Equis.  Make sure that when buying a skin for your player that it is the matched with correct mp3 player size.  Some players with more gigabytes have different size to them.  The armband is something I don't really use that much since I don't really go jogging or anything like that.  My girlfriend tried it and said the player seems a bit too heavy on her arm though.  The bands on the back of the skin sag a little too much so the player shifts all over the place at times.  Still, the option is great to have.  The Car charger and Wall adapter have saved me time and time again.  Very very happy with this accessory purchase.  Price was very reasonable as well."
4.0,"Don't buy this band. It would not fit my watch. The metal plates do not fit properly into the slots on the sides of the gear fit and will not secure to the band. The straps kept popping off and my gear fit kept falling off my wrist.<br />I really wanted to keep this band. The silicon feels very soft and flexible. Softer than the original band. I tried switching out the metal plates with the ones on the original band hoping that would be a quick fix. Unfortunately, it would still not work for me. I will have to return this band. It simply just doesn't work...<br />UPDATE:<br />After seeing my review, Moretek contacted me and sent me another band free of charge. Thankfully the new band worked out great. It was still a littlw troublesome to attach to my gearfit, but with some persistence it actually snapped into place and is secure. I've taken my gearfit on 3 runs with the new band and it hasnt fallen off. Thanks Moretek!"
4.0,I like th feel of the material and the weight and color.  I will wear this sweater often.
4.0,Great product. Seller addressed any and all of my concerns/questions.
4.0,I prefer the original but it's really close.
4.0,I like but it doesn't look like the picture. The front has a plastic shell that makes it look cheap.
4.0,Great watch for little money.
4.0,Cute mask however it has a bunch of fuzzys on it after washing and it’s definitely not for youth. It’s really big on my girl but she loves stitch so much she still wears it!
4.0,Boyfriend loves it. If your someone who needs to carry around a bunch of cards in your wallet than this isn't for you. It can fit maybe 4 cards max including an ID. Good for the minimalist.
4.0,I really like this bag. I dropped one star because it often flips over it I happen to have it over my shoulder and my phone has hit the ground.
4.0,These were cute but much smaller then what I thought they would be. They are almost like children's or young adult glasses. I'm still keeping them but I couldn't use them for what I need them for. Still a nice pair of glasses though.
4.0,This was a gift and the person I gift it to loved it. But I was a bit disappointed that the jackets has no real pockets?  Or no real sweater inning/ liner either.  It part and material all cut together and made look of quality but it really isn't.  But it very good looking jacket. It wasn't cheap either so I expected at least real pockets.
4.0,"The pull over is cool and all. It fits very strange. I am 5'8"", I got an extra large and the fleece comes to nearly my waist. It is Very short. Also the arms are big and baggy, like under my pit area. More less it is just wide and short ha!!"
4.0,These are nice but I would order a size up.<br /><br />They fit snuggly.<br /><br />They work as described.<br /><br />Shipping was fast and they packaged it nicely.
4.0,"Lovely dress, just do not like the color around the waist, so I bought a belt to cover it and that has made it look so much more classy. Love it."
4.0,"Great dress for the price! Fits as expected. The fabric is a bit thinner than I ideal in my opinion, but it's not so bad I won't wear it! Again, for the price it's a great dress and I would definitely purchase it again!"
4.0,Very nice piece for the price. I love it.
4.0,"nice shirt, colors are nice and bright."
4.0,"I liked the silver sequence, and the sleeves...but the sleeves do have splits<br />I could have ordered a large..instead of a XL"
4.0,Fits and supported but not one ti wear all day
4.0,"Super cute dress. Very flattering. The fabric is super soft and not hot. I took one star because it does snag easily,  my nail put a small snag the first time I tried it on.  Overall super satisfied!"
4.0,"Really soft, not see through.  Have washed 5 times and still in great shape.  I dont put synthetic fabrics through the dryer and have just been hang drawing. Also elimates any static."
4.0,"It's not high quality, but it's a good item for the price. If nothing else, you can rip it apart and rebuild it using sturdier string and it'll be cheaper than buying the components separately. Give it a go."
4.0,"gift and the gal liked them,"
4.0,"The collar is itchy, but everything else is great! I ordered an XL because I like a loose fit, and I'm glad I did because it was actually pretty fitted throughout. I have wide hips and the white undershirt actually sits nicely across them. This sweater is going to get a lot of wear this Fall!"
4.0,"I ordered this and received it probably 2 weeks after I ordered it. So the shipping was a little bit slow, which, no huge deal... However, although its really cute and I like wearing it, for what it is, its priced a little high. I can't complain much because I get compliments on it and its comfortable and fits well, I just know I could've got it cheaper. But that's my own issue for not checking more places first. Oh well! Overall, I'm happy with this product!<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Well they lowered the price since I bought it so I'd definitely pay $3.90 for it! My bad!"
4.0,Fit good to size and hid and stretchy
4.0,Fits great but easily tangles...
4.0,I do like these and will enjoy wearing them....but the buyer should understand that the blue plastic portion of the earring is flat...giving them a sort of two dimensional effect.
4.0,Great product.  Have had them before and love them.  Only complaint is they were a day late.
4.0,"Got them today and they fit!  They use to be half the price at Walmart but they quit carrying them and had limited sizes.  Glad I waited and got the size I thought I needed and they fit perfect.  I'm short 5'3&#34; and they are full length, if you are taller they are capris.  They are soft and cute.  I've not washed them yet but hope they come out good.  I belong to a womans camping group and some campouts include a group photo wearing these."
4.0,Delicate and beautiful my sister loved It.
4.0,"The GW-5600 series wears a little small, so I was hoping this would be a better fit. Instead, it's too big. The straps stick out where they connect to the case, so it won't lay flat against the sides of my wrist. I was hoping that being a Japanese model, it would wear a little smaller, but no luck. The one good argument for buying the import, though, is that has the multi-band feature where it receives the atomic clock time by radio each night. That's missing from the US model. Overall, I like the watch, but the lugs need to let the strap lay flatter on the sides."
4.0,"This purse has held up pretty well over the years. I used it every day for about a year, and then off and on for the next year. I like it, it's a good size. Fits enough, but not a huge bag. The only real negative is that the print did start to rub off on the top about 6-8 months after I got it (carrying daily, though). Stitching has kept and material has held shape other than that."
4.0,bigger than I expected for a Medium.. but fits loosely and is still cute
4.0,"The cris cross on shoulders had to much fabric, it was bunched up!"
4.0,"Cute, soft material, stitching not the best<br />VERY SHORT, I'm 5 ft 160 lbs and I wore bike shorts under it for wind etc.<br />VERY low iron setting"
4.0,"Very thin, not warm. Was a snug fit over my head and I do not have a large one. Stayed in place nicely."
4.0,"These are great socks. I enjoy using them around the house and especially at Pure Barre. The top of the sock doesn't quite seem like it's finished but I have not noticed too much fraying, perhaps that is how they are meant to be. The non slip grips on the bottom work great! It's nice to have four pairs for the price of one Pure Barre pair. But the quality is definitely not as good. Works well enough though."
4.0,Ordered true to size in a large. It fit nicely and the sleeves are actually long which can be hard to find
4.0,Little bigger than expected.
4.0,I seen this Ear ring and loved it.  The back of the ring (dragon tail) is a little looser than I would like but still stays on just fine. all in all I like what I got and for half the price of others.  It is awesome.
4.0,Wore this on a casual night on a cruise. It was perfect. The fit accentuates all the right areas. Glad I purchased it!
4.0,"The sizing on this seemed to be off.  My daughter normally orders a 2T, I ordered the size &#34;2-6X&#34; and it's pretty tight on her, the neckline also plunged scandalously low (and no, I did not have it on backwards.&#34;"
4.0,"Arrived on third day of order. Very impressive.  Since my hand is small, fits perfectly. Only  cribs - the light glow covers only hours display and there is no month/year display.  Overall happy with purchase."
4.0,I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend of me who absolutely LOVES anything Elvis! I think she will love it  --  it's one thing Elvis she doesn't have!
4.0,My son is 16 months and doesn’t care to walk. I am tired of holes in his pants from crawling everywhere at daycare. Unfortunately the knee pads don’t stay on his knees the slide off. Clearly if he was younger and not as active crawling I think they would work well for a first time crawler.
4.0,"The sleeves are just a touch too long. Overall the fit is good and flattering. The only thing I think might be a problem is a static cling issue, however for the price I think it is a good purchase. I will likely purchase in a different color also."
4.0,Great shoe for the price-- they look very nice with slacks and have good traction.
4.0,Item arrived as advertised and as shown. It arrived promptly and well packaged. I would buy from this vendor again.
4.0,Very cute - hasn't tarnished and I have been wearing for over a year!
4.0,Love heatwave. This is my 3rd pair.<br /><br />But seriously?<br /><br />At least glasses are fine.
4.0,The straps were just the right length and will work okay with my purse.  The only thing I don't like is the color of the clasps.  It was hard to tell from the picture but I thought the clasps were silver.  They are not.  :(  They're a bronze color.  I can make them work but wish the description would've included the clasp color.  Maybe even had a few options of color.
4.0,Very comfy.  Looks great!
4.0,Have 6 of these shirts and really enjoy the comfort and fit.  The yellow one stitching failing after 3rd use.
4.0,Very thin material which makes it comfortable for summer but so thin the white is a bit see through. Have to wear a cami underneath. Fits as expected and is a cute asymmetrical design.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and very comfortable, good material. It's a little bigger than I expected it to be. I'm 5'6&#34;, wear a 38D, and weigh 173lbs, bought a Large. The dress feels good on."
4.0,"I wear this hat regularly, great pattern and fit."
4.0,"These do run narrow, as others have shared. Given the material they are made from, I decided to keep them -- since I assumed they would stretch a little. After wearing them a few times, I was correct. They still feel a little narrow, but the give in the material makes them comfortable enough that I ordered another pair, in a different color. I find the sole on these shoes to be very comfortable for walking. A nice in-between Merrell shoe from me (i.e., a more cushioned sole than my Barrados and more ""shoe"" like than my Merrell hiking boots. These shoes quickly became my go-to shoes, for casual wear."
4.0,"Very Soft and cute color (I got pink), but the sleeves on the top is way too tight and the buttons keep popping open! I'm a small, for the most part, esp with stretchy clothing items. However, there is little to no stretch in these pj's so I would size up 1 to ensure you'll be comfortable. I'm 4'9ish 120lbs, 34C, 26 waist, 38 hips for reference. Length is not too long for me and I'm SHORT so taller women should definitely size up, for length as well."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:44a86a3d1a68aa55057c1edf94aa6c35]] Didn’t feel as expected but, surprisingly it’s super warm and soft if you like the oversized look then I highly recommend it I’m only 5”6 but it’s a lil past my knees"
4.0,This dress is super cute! Fits as expected. You could even go down a size because it's so flowy. You can dress it up or down. I took a star away because the strap ripped the first time I wore it but I was able to sow it pretty easily.
4.0,"One of the beads fell off, otherwise nice! Plenty of charms on it."
4.0,The shirt was true to size and very soft. The only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars is because of the picture. There stem of the pineapple wasn’t green at all but was the same color brown as the base. I was pretty disappointed when I saw that.
4.0,As expected. Good deal
4.0,"Super cute, only thing is the material is some-what stiff"
4.0,"As a nurse I wear those all the time, however this particular type must have a little bit more polyester or plastic in the material, because it makes my feet extremely sweaty"
4.0,It's for a friend for Christmas so I hope she likes it!
4.0,"This fits great and looks great, but the word &#34;sweater&#34; is used loosely. It's a very thin knit sweater, while I expected thicker with more warmth. It's perfect for a warm fall day or to wear in a casual office environment without a jacket."
4.0,"It's really cute, got this for my niece. I say a nice bag for kids."
4.0,Nice workmanship and size. I am very pleased.
4.0,Have 4 stars simply because I wish the waist part was wider but other than that it’s good 👍
4.0,Came folded in an envelope. Crumples cameout easy enough and I like for the price it a great buy
4.0,"This is a simple and very comfortable dress. The color is a light, soft green. I would describe it as a muted celery. It is flowy/billowy (not sure if those are real words). It comes to the knee and ties on the shoulders. It is a great weekend dress.  Inexpensive and functional. I’d recommend it."
4.0,"Extremely sharp threads. Don't tread together very well, but for the price it was an amazing deal. Don't use if gauging or with new holes."
4.0,"I wear a size 12/14 US. Normally a Large. I sized up to XL, glad I did because the arms would have been too tight. I'm giving 4 stars because the seems are very rough. If itchy things bother you, like tag edges, you may want to pass on this. I can feel every seem and may have to wear a long sleeve tshirt under it. For the price, it's great. Nice length, it goes to my hips, so wearing it with skinny jeans looks nice."
4.0,"Cute top, would be much cuter if it were a fitted top but it seems like it’s made to be a loose fit."
4.0,Good quality.  Lil hot for me but soft.
4.0,"Love them.  Shipping was fast, item was as appeared and I actually purchased a second pair they fit so nicely.  One pair for each car."
4.0,"Really cute top.  I'm not crazy about the fit...a little tighter and shorter than I would have thought, otherwise it is as pictured."
4.0,No stretch. Sequins were falling off. For the money it was the perfect top for NYE.
4.0,"Mom loved them, super comfortable. Only drawback was the pockets had large holes in them!"
4.0,The bifocal area is pretty large and good enough for summer-time reading.
4.0,"Haven't wore it yet, hard to match up with anything in my closet, however it's very cute!"
4.0,Small earrings perfect for a child. Easy to put on and take off. Very happy with this purchase.
4.0,"This was super cute! The bow really is not attached well. It falls down pretty quick. For short picture purposes, you could use double sided tape or a safety pin. True to size."
4.0,"Me encanto la camisa, súper cool. Pedí una talla L"
4.0,these are cheap so I shouldn't complain but the bottom part has no stretch to pull over your boot or whatever you would want to pull it over. I cut the bottom so they work better now. I wish they had a little more stretch like my others. They are cute though.  I gave 4 stars for their looks.
4.0,"I like it, it says hand wash but i put it on gentle cycle on my washer & it does fine. Its comfortable & soft, i will buy this product again."
4.0,I like the fit of the Earrings. They are small for piercing in the middle of my ear. I’m a little disappointed in the length of the chain I thought they would be a little bit bigger.
4.0,"Really love the rings they are so pretty, I received two white, one dark green, and three light green."
4.0,fun to use
4.0,"I love the jacket and the quality of it, but my son is super tall and the sleeves aren’t quite long enough."
4.0,Beautiful dress! But sizing runs too small. incentive to lose weight.
4.0,"Bought these for my son's wedding. So pretty, with a purple/black iridescence, I bought another pair for my daughter.  They are a bit light so a plastic back to secure them would be advisable."
4.0,Great tool for the money.
4.0,Perfect for my6 year old granddaughter!!!!
4.0,"Love using this for traveling, although the zipper broke, ( mentioned in a lot of previous reviews too ) for the amount of times I used and it and stuffed in it's still pretty good, not to mention you get some great use outta of it. Looks pretty cool and simple. Would recommend to get!"
4.0,too small for me.  gave it to my daughter instead and she loves it!
4.0,"Hard to hook on but not impossible.  Don't like that the middle  rubber tabs come out, I have lost several."
4.0,It would be nice to have a darker colour in the nude for black people
4.0,I did this
4.0,"The band is comfortable to wear and looks pretty good although the stitching looks cheap.  The rings flop around; just like in the picture.  Sometimes, this causes the band that I have tucked into the second loop to come out and flop around.  The leather is thin but very soft.  I am a little afraid it will wear out easily, but so far, so good."
4.0,Very convenient for supporting the baby feet
4.0,I liked the way they fit but were to small for my face so I gave them to my wife and they look so good on her. If your wife wants to match with you these will be good for her.
4.0,Needed to buy two sizes so I could layer underneath.
4.0,Wish I had known to buy a larger size.  The color is pretty and the rubber backs are comfortable.
4.0,"I liked these new jeans from Genuine Assembly. The skinny fit is great in the waist but the length for me is too long. These are size 32x34 and I could better wear a 32x32 or a 32x30. However I love the new cloud wash look. I am 5'8"" 165 lbs."
4.0,"5'6, 140, ordered a M - fit is perfect, nice and comfy in the waist and hits right on my knee. The jacquard print detail is nice, though the fabric weight and texture reminds me a bit of curtains. No pockets, which I know is standard... but who doesn't love a skirt with pockets.<br /><br />I am returning it because the red is a little too bright for my coloring; I look best in jewel tones and cooler reds, and this is a bright true red that is just the slightest bit on the red-orange side of the color spectrum. Also, the pleating in the front looks a little bit maternity on my body type. I had a c-section, and hold extra weight and loose skin in my lower abdomen - I need draping in an A-line skirt to smooth this, whereas these stiff pleats seem to accentuate it. I am overall a big fan of this skirt and would recommend it and honestly wear it if I had no other options. It just isn't perfect for my body."
4.0,"Got this the other week.  Just put it on last night.  It is quite light and the band material is nice and pliable. The fastening mechanism for the band took me a minute to get used to. The Blaze fits perfectly, doesn't require a ton of force to place it in or remove it.  It IS, however, a touch short. I have a large wrist and I am on the first hole. There is just enough band to go into the opening to keep it from flopping. It is very comfortable though. Not too tight, or lose."
4.0,"Fits as expected. The material and length are great, rests just above the knee (I'm 5'6&#34;). The pockets do add a little bulk to the hip area, but not a noticeable amount. Super cute belted. I've worn with heels and Chucks, cute with both"
4.0,I liked it my boyfriend did too
4.0,"Nice modern tie,"
4.0,I purchased a small and it was a snug fit but it looked really good and quality material was very nice. Cannot see through and has a little stretch.
4.0,"Wore this on a plane with leggings and a sweater. Can work for many seasons, if you layer. Color is true to pic and the fit is very flattering for curves."
4.0,Really cute sweater
4.0,It’s very high quality and it looks really good in person. Only thing is that it’s pretty big
4.0,it does the job takes a bit of getting used to
4.0,"After a long day of wearing these to work they dig into the skin a bot and i find myself constantly trying to adjust them, but they do their job"
4.0,"This is a very pretty watch and the size is about what I was expecting. That said, I would almost skip this one and find one that is easier to adjust. There are many nice affordable watches on Amazon. The hassle with the strap alone alone was probably more trouble than this $30 watch is worth. I haven’t owned a rose gold watch before, but surely they can’t all be this hard to adjust. It just seems unnecessary.<br /><br />The watch itself is beautiful though, so if you have the time and patience to screw with the adjustable strap, it may be for you.<br /><br />A few nice touches: the clear plastic cover that protects the face from damage, a nice cloth to clean it with, and a handy screwdriver to adjust the band. It also came very nicely packaged. The only negative is the hassle getting the adjustable strap right."
4.0,Nice produts ....
4.0,"Very nice, very comfy, perfect fit. Only complaint is that the fabric pills after the first wash :/"
4.0,Pretty nice sunglasses for the price and the case is nice too.
4.0,"This parka is quite versatile.  It looks great on a man or a woman.  I originally bought it for my husband, but it was a tad too small.  He gave it to me and I love wearing it - keeps me really warm!"
4.0,"Very soft and pretty, unfortunately I did not get a chance to wear it this year. since I did not get out of the house after I got it until winter was gone!  But I am absolutely sure it will come by again!"
4.0,Multiple purchases over past few years. Satisfied customer. Product quality and value.
4.0,"i'm a pretty big fan of the waist trimmers while working out ...not only do they help with extra heat, calorie burn, and targeted trimming - they help with forced posture while you are exercising. that said - i only wear these when exercising, it's a personal preference to limit my use to those minutes/hours.<br /><br />with the zipper styles you really need to ensure you quadruple check the size chart because you don't have as much flexibility as your size changes as with just velcro styles - however zippered styles do provide a much more fitted option so they are slightly superior in that aspect.  If you order too small, you're just going to be working your way towards fitting into it.  I do not recommend wearing one too small because you can do real damage.  If it's a little large - the velcro straps will help create a tighter look but as you trim down, you're just going to need to order a new one.  If you get the correct 'you now' size, the velcro will help to elongate your time with it as you tighten up.  just really make an educated decision based on the size chart - whether you like their size or not.  if you feel like you are in between sizes - go with the larger, it will allow you to eat and drink vs risking cutting off any level circulation because you tried to zip into something too small.<br /><br />final note - just my personal reminder - when you wear these HYDRATE extra.  you will sweat more than normal inside of it and it's not as noticeable till you take it off.  take care of yourself while exercising."
4.0,"This fabric is unlike anything I’ve felt! It feels like a really think swim suit and can get a little hot,"
4.0,O tecido poderia ser um pouco melhor
4.0,"I can fit a lot in this bag , the only thing is not much fits in the wallet other than that I love it made well"
4.0,Super adorable. Runs small. I am usually an adult med and got this in a large. Top fits perfectly.  Bottoms are still a bit small. Really cute for the price. Wish the top and bottoms were equally proportioned. Overall happy with my purchase.
4.0,"Nice dress, but too small."
4.0,"I own a couple pair of this brand in shorts so decided to get the long pants because the shorts are really comfortable and I love, love, love the phone pocket. The long pants were comfortable too, but I'm 5/4, 110 lbs and bought the small and the length was too short for my liking. I ended up returning and buying another brand that was a little more expensive, but with about 1 inch more on the inseam and they're perfect. If you're shorter or like your pants shorter, you'll like these."
4.0,Comfortable! Reduced foot pain.
4.0,I like the look.  Its cute.  I'm wondering if I should hv went down a size.  It is really high waisted.  Great for those who hv long torsos.
4.0,The skirt is pretty but does not stretch . I ordered a med thinking it stretched and NO. I can still fit it though
4.0,Fits perfect!  The zipper was stuck though
4.0,"Bigger than I expected when fully extended, so less dainty than I hoped.  Chain is rough.  It does work and is unique."
4.0,Worth the price. Does it’s job.
4.0,Beautiful but stones fall off after some time
4.0,Excellent quality..especially considering the price. If you are typically a US Med-Lg....I highly recommend buying the XL.
4.0,"It's VERY cute! Quality is crap, though. Super thin material that won't likely last long. BUT- it was cheap, so it's a 'get what you pay for' thing. I'd recommend it, for the price- which was like two bucks.  :-)"
4.0,"What an adorable product. I purchased it for a new born and while it's a Christmas gift, the personalized name and number on the back will be well received by the new parents."
4.0,Great color comfy and maded my uncle jealous lol
4.0,Looks nice but not sure it will holdup long term.
4.0,"Muy lindo, es más pequeño que como se muestra . Pero esta hermoso."
4.0,Definitely order a size up but it’s over all a pretty cute dress for a great price I ordered a medium then returned it and ordered a large and the large fit amazing a little loose in the Breast area but I have small top and large bottom 😂
4.0,"I can't find the color I ordered which seems odd, but ok. I only bought one pair and they are fleece lined, which will work fro cooler temps but I was hoping to use these during the summer. They fit really well, I am short(4'1'') and round and they fit really well. I will likely get another pair, and hopefully they won't be fleece lined!"
4.0,"I was intrigued by the story behind the Vortex strap. I appreciate all the small design cues the developers put into the strap. I think they look and feel great on two of my Casio Duros (blue strap on a Batman bezel and black strap on the classic black bezel). So why not five stars, you ask? Well, as mentioned in a previous review the strap length is a bit of an issue. While it fits my wrist with some room for adjustment, the are many more hole on the bezel side rather than the tang/buckle side of the strap. I chose to remove one of the keepers from each strap to make it work/fit/feel right. Is this a deal breaker or even a real problem? No, not really. I think they are fine for my 7” wrist, but any bigger and there would definitely be problems. I am very happy with the straps and will keep them, but a word of warning to you big wrists out there, you might want to try another strap for your beloved diver. Have a great day."
4.0,Great product and very fast shippment
4.0,"Nice quality, nice looking and these shoes are comfy, but they won't stay on my feet...although it may be my feet.  I have Nike slides that have an adjustable velcro strap, but to get them to stay on, I have to tighten the velcro so tight it actually hurts my foot lol"
4.0,"One of the fake clear crystals on the sides fell oout. I'll glue it back in, though, cause I think its gorgeous. Hands down my favorite snap charm bracelet."
4.0,"Good colors, arrived on time."
4.0,"Either it took a lot of time to get them, it was worthy. Size is good, bought the XL using the table that is in some other products of Baleaf and it is ok, I'm 177 cms and 88 kilos, even though the scale recomended a XXL as I'm going thinner I took a chance. I can't get one kilo up, but it is really good and if I loose some weight it would fit me even better. I like the materials and how it is finished, considering the price for both."
4.0,"Me encanto el anillo, Mi esposo me compro este anillo.<br />Fue una sorpresa que me tenía, cuando me entregó el anillo casi me desmallo de tan bello que es. El remplazo mi anillo de boda por este anillo. Muy bello.<br />Gracias mi vida 😍<br />My husband bought this ring.<br />It’s beautiful, I really love it.<br />A beautiful gift from my husband, thanks baby."
4.0,Very cute but also very form fitting and shows EVERY curve even the ones you dont want emphasized.
4.0,"It was really difficult to decide on a size to order.  I ordered a 38/39 based on product info and reviews.  I think the next size down would have been too small, but these are definitely large.  I decided t keep them.  They are definitely &#34;plush&#34;."
4.0,Its surprisingly adorable
4.0,I like this band overall but the quick release pins keep dislodging from the watch face.<br />**UPDATE** I contacted the seller regarding the issue and they immediately sent another band. The downside is it also had one pin that was too short but between both packages I have one complete band that works very well. I'd say if you have pins at home that work in your watch that you can use with the band it's an excellent purchase. I wouldn't rely on the pins included though. Overall I am satisfied and wear the band every day.
4.0,"This is a pretty dress, I was going to use it as a beach cover-up.  I ordered the extra large and it didn't fit.  The extra large is more like a size 12 and I wear a size 14.  I returned it."
4.0,"gd quality, but reviews about them running large was not true..."
4.0,Beautiful and would like another one.  Takes a long time to receive.  Have your glue ready to replace missing gem stones that fall out.
4.0,"I've put 4 of the 5 to use over the past week on the shorts I wear to work in a data center. I wear men's 40-inch shorts, but I guess I lost little bit of weight mid-summer because they started to drop down. A regular belt is pretty uncomfortable since I do a lot of bending and crouching all day. These have been pretty comfortable so far, but time will tell.<br /><br />The reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is that the size adjustment clasp is pretty low quality (fair enough; I got 5 belts for $10 after all...), and one of them slipped while I was working, then let go of the stationary end of the belt while I was trying to adjust it. I was able to reinstall it with the belt off, and it held fine the rest of the day, so maybe it was just a fluke. I'll try to remember to update when I've used them longer.<br /><br />By the way, if you are deciding whether they will fit you, bear in mind that they snap around a belt loop and don't have to go all the way around you. You could probably even attach them to a second belt loop instead of your foremost if you needed to, and they would probably still do the job. So I recommend these for anyone who needs a belt and doesn't want it catching on their shirt, flapping loose at the side, or to deal with the buckle on a trip to the bathroom. I personally don't find them particularly stylish (though I'm not particularly stylish myslef...), but I wear my shirts untucked, so it doesn't matter."
4.0,"Great bag. But Thin fabric. Bought it for work, I’m a caregiver so I need many things for work everyday. Looks like it will do the job! Fair product!"
4.0,Very nice quality but top is extra long
4.0,"Fun!<br /><br />Great for children or adults to wear to a party, for instance."
4.0,Great quality! Very durable!
4.0,I'm scared to wear these as nipple rings because they look like earrings or 16g but the look like the picture so that's something. ..
4.0,"I had to order a size large, as I am a medium and didn't want it tight. Its a very thick and lovey material true to color."
4.0,Runs alittle big.  Like the shirt thou
4.0,"Pros:<br />- Great price<br />- Classy, vintage look<br />- Not Sheer<br />- Comfortable & flattering<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Wish the elastic waist sat a bit lower on the waist. It tends to sit right under my bust. Whenever I would stand up, I would need to pull it down so it didn't bunch up around my belt and make me look bigger around the waist.<br />- Wish the fabric was more breathable.<br /><br />Ordered a size 6 because I have broader shoulders. Possibly could've worn a 4.<br /><br />In the pic I paired the dress with the following:<br /><br />White Belt: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HGYMYM1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Black Tights: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DLM3B6H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Black Pumps: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VZ81WY4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
4.0,Fits nicely above the hips. Comfy. Looks good and form fitting. Only problem is the fold at the bottom. After washed and dried the fold gets bent all wonky and I have to iron it back straight
4.0,"Very nice, high quality belt and buckle. Hoping that it will last a long time."
4.0,Love the size. Do not like the weight. Must be hollow.
4.0,"I'm normally a medium. 5 foot 7 160 lbs 36 ddd I wear size 6 bottoms in nine west and lauren conrad. I wear a medium top. I got a large due to reviews and glad I did. This dress is short and the width on the upper back and under arms is not as wide as a usual large. The model in the dress shows how the under arm pulls out so I assumed it was tight & to size up. So glad I did. It is a cute dress, but could be a little nicer. Seems a little cheap."
4.0,"i wear large seem good fit long wait but nice 12+ prices try it out so far great<br /><br />like the color and matches pic which big plus<br /><br />live in minesota ice box of usa,  or maybe boston got that this year award ?? lol<br /><br />would have ordered more , if did not take so many weeks to get here"
4.0,Love these retro cat styled glasses!<br /><br />These glasses are too die for.  They habe a nice retro style. Very well made. The framed are made out of metal..no plastic peices here. The lenses are a nice rose colored. You can see nice and clear. These have officially became my new driving glasses. I can clearly see everything and read signs. I have gotten a lot of compliments on these. My only complaint air wish they were a tad smaller. I did purchase this item during a promotional discount in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,"Order at least 3 inches bigger than waist size of pants.  Cloth good quality, leather cheap and tough.  Buckle is goldtone not silver as you might suppose from photo."
4.0,The shirt is cute and I bought it a size bigger so it would give me a little more room. Even going up in size it was snug. Sending it back for this reason
4.0,"Beautiful wallet but does not have a duplicate check holder, which I wanted."
4.0,"nice pj's,  very soft material."
4.0,Fits good looks cute but too high for me
4.0,"really beautiful but it's a little longer for me. I gave it to my sister, it's perfect!"
4.0,Great shoe for a great price.
4.0,"I like the glases, however the main reason I got them was for the polarized lenses and I don't think they give the protection that I expected for polarized ."
4.0,"These are beatuiful, but they are a little larger than I expected them to be so they hang down from my lobes."
4.0,"Band is large, and taking out links is a pain! The tool is almost useless, and oh...those incomplete Chinese instructions.......what a Joke! Unless you like working with TENEE objects, take it to a jeweler."
4.0,It fixed well!
4.0,Somewhat disappointed that it runs small. Not sure if I will return
4.0,"I like it, good quality"
4.0,Great comfortable fit and appearance. The power only lasted about a half day which was unexpected but he is very happy with the item.
4.0,Cute! Not anything I’d gift because I’m not sure about quality but it looks nice
4.0,"my 3 yo grandson loves them for the pool, but they are large and clunky.  They seem unsafe for running (which is what kids do), but he hasn't fallen or tripped"
4.0,Good value and does the job.
4.0,"I love the design but it's a strange in-between size. It's too big for a purse, and too small for a practical back pack. It does not fit a regular size notebook. 😕<br />If you have a smaller sized notebook, small books, and/or magazines,  it's great.<br />This backpack is very unique and looks awesome."
4.0,"Overall, the changing towel feels very soft.  As I tried on the towel, it was a little difficult getting the towel, hood part over over my head because the opening is pretty small... It definitely could be a lot bigger..."
4.0,"The color is extremely vibrant. I'm normally a size 4 and ordered a size M, its large and I need at least a size smaller. I read reviews carefully idk how folks said this dress runs small. I ordered a diff color a size smaller so hopefully I'll be able to see the difference. The material isn't the best and its def flows."
4.0,"I really like this shirt and was disappointed when it didn't fit.  I ordered a large and it was way to small for a 38D bust. I even tried it on with a sports bra figuring I'd flatten the girls down a bit and it was still too small, bust and shoulders.  I liked the length of it, the v-neck and the button front.  Was surprised to find it was a pullover.  Thought the buttons worked but they're just for show.  Bottom line - really nice shirt but just too small!"
4.0,"A little shorter than I hoped for, but otherwise fits great! I am 5'11, so that's probably why it's a touch short."
4.0,Compression socks Great fit they are a tad bit too long the part where there’s no toes it’s tiny bit annoying because there’s a little bump there but just wear thin socks and you’ll be OK I like them
4.0,It came exactly as pictured. Perfect size for a first or second grader. The little doll that came with it was deformed looking and the jewel was off her dress. But the backpack itself seems to be well made.
4.0,"This is much higher quality than I expected for the price. It's a little heavier than I expected, and I have trouble finding things in the multiple sections. But it is a very nice looking bag that is a good size, and for an amazing price. Great for summer!"
4.0,"Just got these today, fit a tad bit smaller but are super nice especially for the price. Only took about 2 weeks to get here which isn't bad considering it came from China. Would definitely buy again if I am going to go bigger"
4.0,"I normally wear a 32ddd and ordered this in the sister size 36d. Bra isn't super supportive but at my size what is lol. Panties are on the smaller size (I usually wear a medium in Victoria's Secret) but not uncomfortably so. Set looks great and held up after washing. You just can't beat the value on this set, so I will be ordering more sets in the future."
4.0,"I love this brand of shoes for daycare. They are cute, colorful and affordable."
4.0,These were nice jeans. Unfortunately I am short so the pant legs were too long. Still debating on what to do. They did fit and are a great quality of jeans.
4.0,"These are pretty good leggings, they fit the waist and the legs well.  My only qualm is the crotch groin area, it felt like the seem was set to low so I had to pull the pants up to my belly button so it didn't look like I had baggy pant syndrome."
4.0,"There is some glitter fall out, but for the price, it is an attractive bag.  I needed it for an event and it served it's purpose."
4.0,"Gave this a 4/5 stars because the tail was a huge bulky stuffed toy instead of long strands of fur.  This added some weight.  Otherwise, it gave me a great Halloween costume!"
4.0,It was a good deal price wise for this.<br />Sleeves are slightly shorter than I like but I have long arms but it works fine.  The color is a pretty red.
4.0,Very cofortable
4.0,"There's nothing super special about this dress alone - the fabric is thin but still good quality. It's super cute with accessories for a ""daytime"" flapper look though! I had a Roaring 20s party to attend, and wanted something other than the traditional fringe/sequin flapper dress. I went with a pearl necklace, long gloves, and a cloche hat (which I LOVED and plan to wear in the fall/winter). I got lots of compliments! I can also wear this dress for other occasions now - it just needs a good necklace and shoes!"
4.0,"This is a very thin lightweight cover that gets the job done and will protect your phone from any bumps and scratched. I currently had to send my old phone due to the finger scan not working properly and I am using a loner phone from my phone company, I decided to get this cover as its a very inexpensive and will protect this phone until mines comes back, it fits perfectly and it even brought glass screen protector, it has all the outlet and button cut outs. The image on the front is printed fells like a soft but mat. I think the design on this would be perfect for any teen. I love that it dose not add a bigger profile so it fits perfectly in my gym pants pockets."
4.0,"Vibrant, cool and comfy."
4.0,"These socks provide great compression for the lower leg - valuable for the prevention and management of varicose veins.  I would give them 5 stars but I have some minor bruising at the top.  Could be because they are brand new - they might relax a little with age.  The are certainly well-made, nice-looking, and compressive."
4.0,Fits.  No room for error.  True to size.
4.0,Could be softer interior.
4.0,"I work at a medical lab and bought this to block out the unpleasant odours of various bodily fluids- as well as the excess perfume/cologne my coworkers wear that trigger my migraines.<br /><br />This mask is very soft, comfortable and the wire bends very nicely. Without the inserts, the mask isn't too hot and doesn't muffle my speech too badly. The ear straps are comfortable and don't tug my ears forward, either!<br /><br />The only reason I took off a star is because the inserts don't fit 100% in the pocket and get bunched up inside, making the inner lining of the mask bulge out against my mouth. The mask by itself does a decent job of blocking out smells, so I haven't bothered with the inserts."
4.0,"Item was smaller than expected in terms of dimensions (look and fit). Material didn't look cheap, but it didn't look luxurious either. I probably would've kept it if it were a bit bigger."
4.0,just a tad small for most but otherwise this is a good product to use. lots of them in a pack and price is great.
4.0,I like this multifunctional keychain
4.0,Love it! Fits true to size:)
4.0,Arrived when expected. Good value.
4.0,Bought for my son - he likes it.  Quality was fine.
4.0,Very cool wear over tights for me
4.0,"Love the looks, but I would buy a size larger as it fits kind of snug."
4.0,Great quality for the price.i use it like a house gown. Just perfect for me.
4.0,"This is nicely cut and made, and a real steal at the Amazon price. Just don't be fooled by the open-work weave into thinking it's for summer. The yarn is medium-weight and best suited to below 65 F."
4.0,"Always on the lookout for any new, unusual or usual Packer memorabilia that I might not have, I came across this product.  Smaller than expected, but in excellent condition and worn very proudly on my running shoes--even during the recent Packers 5K in Green Bay."
4.0,Very good looking!
4.0,My daughter loves them...but some of the diamonds on the shoes have already come off. Cheap dress up shoes! That's all.
4.0,"The red plastic part comes off the hat for washing I guess, we shall see if it stays put when wearing it fits over but isn't really attached to the hat brim  The front is velcroed on and the building blocks are super tiny. Not sure if they are compatible with the tiny Lego ones or not, but they are so small it is difficult for me to put them back on.  Still a lego kid would probably like it for displaying creations.  The grey color is rather bland."
4.0,"Fits just fine, sleeves might be a bit longer than thy should be. The fabric feels very much like spandex even though it shows only 5%. Would’ve preferred a more cotton feeling. Also seems to attract dirt and dust easily. We’ll see how they clean up."
4.0,"very fashionable!  the material is thick enough to not really require an undershirt, but be sure to wear neutral undergarment still!  it's a very springy top, flowy and you can wear it for work or a night out... even to dine out!  the front is a bit low for the office FYI.<br /><br />overall, the material is very fresh on my skin!  perfect for summer wear too!  i love it!"
4.0,The shoes was very nice. It lit up very nicely. It just was slightly on the small side. But overall it's was good shoes.
4.0,"I'd like to start of by saying that this drone is a good deal for the price. That said it's not the best drone on the market but it is cheap and good.<br /><br />This drone is easy to fly and get the hang of. There is a little sensitivity switch in the middle of the controller that makes it easy to adjust for flying inside and outside. The landing gear and wing guards are amazing, I have crashed it multiple times and it just bounces back up! The throttle is a little bit touchy but it wasn't too hard to figure out.<br />There were a few features of the drone that I didn't quite understand. The battery capsule under the camera is hard to get into, we had to use a Swiss Army knife to pry it open. It may have been an error on our part but I didn't see any alternative ways to open the battery storage up. Another thing I noticed was that it was hard to figure out when the video feature was recording or not. Again, that could have just been us. (There is a page in the manual that describes how to record)<br /><br />The indisputable bad features about the drone. Number one, headless mode is extremely hard to use as you have to have the trimming balanced almost perfectly or else the direction will be thrown off. (Although it's fairly easy to learn to fly without headless mode) Number two, the video quality is pretty skippy and the audio doesn't line up. (Not that the audio matters) One last thing is that the auto-return simply sends the drone flying away, whether it is towards the remote or not. I would not suggest using the feature as it may result in losing your drone. (It's easy enough to avoid)<br /><br />Just some notes: The battery lasted longer than 10 minutes for me, but the battery life decreases when using the video feature. Again, small price for a hobby drone, I would use this drone more for recreational flying than any type of video production. Great drone for fun flying that won't empty your bank account."
4.0,"It does not have breathing holes like the picture, but it seems nice so far. I bought it to replace another brand that was shedding too much, and I haven't seen any shedding yet. It is nice and soft and warm. The picture just needs to be updated."
4.0,The top is too small but if you get the right size the bottom fits perfectly and is really flattering
4.0,I would buy these sweats again.
4.0,"I'm 5'3 & ~120 lbs, ordered the medium and fits perfect. Price is also great!"
4.0,Fits good .I didnt think it wood be so heavy but i like it alot i would buy again.
4.0,"Me gustaron mucho, satisfecha, pero el blanco tiende a ensuciarse mucho"
4.0,Nice shirt but it was a very small (large) and took a very long time to get here. But it is a nice shirt.
4.0,They are cute and comfortable (:
4.0,Got for my mom.  She loved it!  Super soft!
4.0,granddaughter loved it for the Renaissance fair
4.0,just what all the masks need. Easy to put on and work great
4.0,"I got these for my son who is a HUGE Harry Potter fan. He LOVES them however, definitely needed a couple of washes before he was happy with wearing them. He said they were a bit itchy but now he loves them. The reviews said the sizing is small. I ordered him a 14-16 when he normally wears a 10-12. They fit good!  I wouldn't throw the shirt in the dryer for fear of them shrinking. I want them to last for him.  The arms were a bit tight when he first tried them on....but after the washes and a couple wears hes incredibly happy with them."
4.0,"Simple and cute, I like these a lot!  The only thing is the shipping time.  Plan on waiting a very long while for these to arrive.  But once you get them you will be happy.  Perfect for the price and the sizes are nice."
4.0,It is a nice necklace and cheap
4.0,Logo was crooked but fits and works. I have an XL size head and this hat is very comfortable.
4.0,Little bigger than everything
4.0,"The only downside to this skirt is the belt, I'm too skinny and there isn't a setting small enough so it fits around me. The smallest hole leaves it drooping. I opted for replacing it with my own. It does, however, look insanely cute! I absolutely adore it."
4.0,a little smaller than I thought they would be but they are good for around the house!
4.0,Dress is beautiful but the hemming was set up in the red lace in the back so I had to take out that area to get it out and resew the lace embellishment back on
4.0,"Not a bad pair of casual pants, but they are about a size too big in length and two sizes too big in the waist. If you have a long lean kiddo this may not be the best pair fit wise. Stockier kiddos will appreciate the larger waist. Drawstring works but it's just not enough to keep these up for my thin built 9 year old."
4.0,"Good comfortable fit and a classic look right out of the box, but man... that smell. Like a fresh spill on a concrete slab at the gas station. Or perhaps a freshly pitched fishing pier. Or even prescription strength dandruff shampoo. First I did a gentle clean with mild soap and water. After letting that dry, I covered the shoes inside and out with a thick layer of baking soda overnight to no avail. Order these at least a few weeks in advance, and put them in a box with tons of odor-absorbing products, dryer sheets, etc. Change the odor absorbant frequently."
4.0,Over all it was cute I ordered a small but they gave me a large so it’s was big so I have to Sow it
4.0,The magnetic band didn't fit which was a disappointment since I really liked the design. Overall the material on both bands felt very durable. Inserting the band to the watch was very difficult at first since the pin kept falling out.
4.0,I would give 5 stars if they were thicker!
4.0,"Fit is small , fast shipping though"
4.0,I was hoping for a bit of a more form fitting shirt with a bit more stretch in the fabric.
4.0,I assume it is made to not button around the chest since I plan to wear it over another top. Showing it buttoned is perhaps a little misleading.
4.0,"Ran a little big, but washed & dried up as expected. 100% cotton. Flexible for shrinking."
4.0,Still worth it though
4.0,More of an empire waist. Made me look a bit pregnant but I loved the feel and look
4.0,"Looks pretty..is cheap quality the...warring were bent and necklace chain had bad knots n tangles...I finally fixed them, will work but very cheap"
4.0,"Im infatuated with this brilliant and striking watch. The way the second hand catches the light while a mesmerizing blue hue wanes across its face (if you're wondering the face of the watch is black, it has to be the glass or something that produces the amazing blue color, but man it's pretty). It's stunning and keeps catching my eye over and over again. Love the detail that went into this watch. I never knew they used jewel stones in watches to actually make them work too. Plain as day you can see the finely polished gem stones being used at all the high wear and tear areas like the bushings or the pallets. The band leaves you only feeling the weight of the time piece if you you get close enough, you can get that aromatic whiff of real leather. However, it is on dainty side and rather feminine in design. This leaves you with the feeling of a 2 year old who hasn't quite grown into his head yet clinging to your wrist at times. As this was my first automatic watch, I was left ill by the instructions. The first instruction is to wind the watch but how to do so are left in another part of the book. &#34;Do I continue to try turning it counter clock wise? It definitely feels and sounds like im going to break it if I turn it the other way but doing this is insane.&#34; (It is clock wise if you're curious, don't worry im pretty sure mine didn't break). The last bit is a toss up on how you feel about it but you might want to know. The hour and minute hands on the watch don't look like the picture. I would have given 5 stars but on principal I deducted a start even though I like the difference being the hands have how strips on them for night time.<br /><br />Update: I think I figured out the blue sheen. i believe it's a coating on the glass similar to the type used on eye glasses but produces a blue sheen instead of green to reduce glare and I love it still. However, this layer does not carry the same scratch protection as the glass seems to. So I have these oily shimmery scratches on my watch face. I scratched the face so I can't get angry but I've had 10 dollar watches survive more to the face."
4.0,Very comfortable. Has pockets!<br />Beware of windy days ;)
4.0,I've both a handful of these ruched dresses from Amazon and found that this one in particular had a very nice quality material! I found it true to size
4.0,Brought for my future husband to be for a wedding gift he love!
4.0,Dress fits nicely but has a plastic feel to it.
4.0,"Its a nice shirt,  the pocket was straight and its a little bit thicker of a cotton. I do wish the sides weren't cut up quite so high. I ordered the large and probably could have done the medium and it still would have been flowy. It held up through the washer and dryer, no shrinkage or color loss. Its a deeper black, which is nice.  I'd get it again"
4.0,I love this shirt! It was a little shorter then I like but it wasn't bad. It's very soft and comfortable and I have washed it several times with no problems. I am super happy with my purchase!
4.0,"Sized well, comfortable, I have a high instep and have difficulty finding sandals which  fit well, I am quite pleased with my Ultas"
4.0,Bien bello
4.0,"The quality of the scarves are are ok, the are made of a some what thin material which I prefer. The length of the scarves is perfect length I'm not on to wear everyday when I do I like them not to be too short. Only thing I didn't realize was one scarf was Skelton heads and those are not my preference. So other than that I enjoyed them so far."
4.0,I was about to return it until I was able to make it work with my Bulova watch.<br /><br />I just had to slide it to the counterclockwise position and also make sure the watch was running (no stopped after being stored for a couple of days).
4.0,Fun stocking stuffer for my boys. Sound is good but i hear the light is dim. Overall happy with this beanie.
4.0,Not the same quality as buying at a retail store
4.0,Really cute summer casual dress.  They size is pretty accurate.  Can't wait to wear it!!! Looks really cute and comfy!
4.0,Giving a 4 star because like others said it definitely is longer then I would of liked. My daughter got the size 11 and they are the only 11s she has that are that long. I couldn’t size down because of the narrowness of the sandal. I wish they were a little wider because it’s actually kinda difficult to get her foot into it. It does have a little stretch at the top foot opening part but with them being so narrow it’s kinda hard for her foot to go in. She loves them though. They are super cute.
4.0,Party favor hit!!
4.0,"No dislike, skidproof"
4.0,It's hasn't turned green or discolored in 2 weeks. It's stayed Shiney and the same.
4.0,"Bought it for the wife to go to a game. She loved it, except it was a very warm day and the bag was in the sun. Needless to say, everything in the bag that could melt...did."
4.0,Really cute! I always get compliments.
4.0,I bought these for my husband because he is constantly going through sunglasses and after a while buying name brand Oakley lenses gets expensive. These were a cheap alternative. He likes them. They block about the same as the name brand ones. They are a little more sheer than the Oakley’s though. Fit perfect.
4.0,"These were exactly the Joe’s cords Presented kn the photo, but I was sent the wrong size. I returned them and tried ordering again, and am hoping to get the correct size this time. Fingers crossed."
4.0,Awesome for sweaty summers.
4.0,"Got this one for my wife as a place to attach extra magazine holders and a radio pouch.  Seems to be pretty sturdy but it is very small.  Low profile means ""the size of a SAPI plate"" and not an inch more.  Overall seems to be a pretty good product.  Once the coronavirus apocalypse gets into full swing we will see..."
4.0,"I love the dress, I'm just sorry it doesn't come in a 1X.  Sorry to have to send it back, love the fabric and style."
4.0,"It is a really cute workout top, but definitely too loose for ""compression"" standards. The sleeves are not long enough to comfortably use the thumbholes. It is warm enough for running on days that are chilly, but not extremely cold. Best used as a top layer over a tank because it is not fitted. Good thing is it's cute enough to wear even when not working out."
4.0,"I bought 3 of these dresses in different designs. I originally ordered an XL and had to return for being too big. These dresses are supposed to fit loose, but XL was way too big for me. My US size is M/10/M-L. This red dress I got an L, and it's big. I am keeping it, I like the fit.  Material is thin, colors are vibrant. I got compliments when wearing it. Perfect for hot summer days."
4.0,"Not a bad dress. Looks kinda see thru when you hold it up to the light, but you can't see thru it when wearing it"
4.0,"They don't slide down but they're not soft at all.  Kinda itchy, but way worth it for a costume. Amazed at how well they stay up, super cuteee as well!"
4.0,Went to a 80's Birthday Party.
4.0,Super small doesn’t seem sturdy at all but I’ve been wearing it for two months straight and it’s still intact nothings broken I love it!!!
4.0,Love the watch... But the in built light is not that bright enough
4.0,"I'm 5,8"" and 185 pounds and got a medium fits me perfectly. I really love this cardigan. I wear it almost everyday. Only issue is the pockets came loose from the inside of the cardigan. Just a few easy stiches to fix. Great warm cardigan though"
4.0,This was a replacement for an identical watch I lost. I don't remember the light working so poorly as this one. Rest of the watch is fine for the price.
4.0,"This works well on necklaces that have big links; however, it is too thick to go through necklaces that have smaller links. Had to go back to my old safety pin trick for those! I am using it, though, on my other necklaces."
4.0,I liked the material and the style but the uncomfortable seams forced my hand for a return.
4.0,These are cute..plastic but still adorable
4.0,I think the compression is to high for me. I ordered 6 pair because of shipping charges. I do like the socks except maybe I should have ordered lower compression.
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my father and I think it will be very useful for his travels. It arrived in a very nice box perfect for gifting. It is a little taller than an average sized wallet. I give it 4 stars because it had a very strong odor of whatever is used to treat leather I guess. I hope that diminishes quickly because it is quite strong.<br />Overall, a very good quality travel wallet and perfect gift for men."
4.0,I like the bag but the top zipper keep coming apart
4.0,"Very cute and comfy outfit. The material does have a lot of stretch so I’m glad that I followed the reviews and ordered a size down. I am 5’5 measurements are 42-38-51, 5”5 and I weigh 251 lbs and I Do have quite a bit of junk in my trunk😂😂😂(big booty) but I am wearing an XL. The pants fit perfect but I think with this color with the stretch it makes the pants look a little lighter than the top as you can see in the picture (reason for the 4 stars) The top was a little big but nothing that a few pins couldn’t handle! I going to order more in different colors as soon as I figure out which one I want🤷🏽‍♀️And oooweee did I get compliments on this outfit."
4.0,My daughter says: “they are cute and comfy.”
4.0,"I bought the reflective black/reflective white/pink sand set. I really wanted one of these bands and thought the reflective ones were a bonus because I tend to walk/run early in the morning when it’s still dark. Anyway, I got these yesterday and wore the “reflective” white one outside while taking my kids trick-or-treating, including after dark.<br /><br />Maybe I’m not using it under the right conditions, but the reflective markings on my running shoes reflected in cars’ headlights and whatnot, but the watch band did not appear to reflect any light.<br /><br />Because it’s not really reflective, this is basically a white/grey band. I still like it, but if you want a true white band, don’t order this one.<br /><br />Otherwise it’s very comfortable and fits my 41mm Series 7 Apple Watch. You can’t beat the price for 3 bands, and it is as nice as the Apple one that came with my husband’s S7 Watch."
4.0,Love this skirt!  Zipper sticks a little just below the waistline.  Fits well and is very festive!
4.0,"The dress is beautiful but it was not flattering on my stomach area. I bought my normal size but it was def not appealing to my stomach. Unfortunately I had to return it. The material is nice and stretchy, stitching is good but just size up if you are worried about your tummy area"
4.0,"These were the size I wanted and a small diamond. Really only needed one, but the variety of sizes are nice.<br />The diamonds are the bolt that screw into the post. Make sure someone is willing to help you. Was hard the see the post to line up. Took me a while trying to do it alone."
4.0,"Run a little big, but adorable.  Great quality!  Ordered a smaller pair to fit now, and kept the bigger size for later!"
4.0,I did artwork on the hoodie but that is the color pink I received twice when I expected the pink that’s shown in the very attractive man above!!
4.0,This is the usual 33g Rodico. The price is good & shipping fast. Don't know why the 6033 is the only size available anywhere. Surely larger size is made. This product really works well!
4.0,"Really cute suit, but it was too short in the body for me.  I am very tall so it is hard to find a good fit in a one piece suit. If I was average height, it would have fit perfectly and I would have loved it."
4.0,This was my first snoga and it is so comfortable and breathable. I do not feel hot in this despite the layers. I use it to workout in and I plan to try it for swimming. It allows for lateral movement because of the design. I just wish it were just a tad longer. It tends to go higher on my knee than I expected and I am not a tall person.
4.0,"They seem good. I didn't give them 5 stars because, although i've never really had compression pants before, i'm pretty sure these are supposed to feel a bit tighter. I'd use them as a base layer, but if you're looking to get that nice compression feel to help with blood circulation during a workout, then look elsewhere.<br /><br />I've read other reviews and it seems like the compression is hit or miss. So maybe I got the 'dud?' I'll still enjoy these under my shorts during a workout though. Cheers."
4.0,I like the overall fit. I like the material. Very comfortable. Washes well. The was a bit of damage on one of the shoulder. Two small holes. I attribute that to they way it was folded and stored. The snaps in the crotch are imprinted on the shoulder...
4.0,"A little short (I'm 6'1&#34;) to where it fits right along my belt, but fits just fine. Prefer it to be just below my belt, maybe it'll stretch out over time."
4.0,The fabric is a little rough on the skin. I liked the color( orange). Can be accessorized to look a little bit more expensive.
4.0,Happy with soft material and coverage on baby.
4.0,It was a bit big/wide and long but I just needed it for a quick shoot- would look cute at a picnic or a brunch!
4.0,Had to cut the white strap off and pin the tail on my butt bc idk what you can do with 2 inches of a strap? It held up all night and I won the costume contest!!
4.0,I ordered the 7.5 (I’m usually a 7-7.5) and was surprised by the tight fit. I would recommend sizing up. They’re super cute and comfortable otherwise and I’m happy with my purchase!
4.0,Very good piece.
4.0,"These earrings are cute. The size is perfect. They are not heavy at all. They are a little cheap looking, but for the price they are okay."
4.0,Fitted very well and super comfortable.
4.0,"Pretty pink, good neckline, soft comfortable and looks better under my uniform black cosmetician jacket than the uniform provided by company, only problem is it is snug and rolls up my belly but they don't have an extra large to order and it was just the color I needed."
4.0,"I like this watch very much, it looks great, keeps good time<br />and has held up well.  The only complainant I have, is that the<br />buttons above and below the stem stick out to far and can<br />be ever so slightly uncomfortable.  It is a very minor complainant<br />but one that I did notice.  I have almost 100 watches from<br />the 1940's to modern, this is the only one that does this. though<br />I must stress it is very minor problem, and does not really keep me from<br />using it."
4.0,"Pretty, good thick material, will be very handy in winter."
4.0,Looks beautiful and nice and comfortable on my face. Perfect for a masquerade ball.
4.0,Beautiful glasses and great quality!! The only thing i would say is they sit far off of your face. I wish they didn’t stick out that much but it’s a look some people like.
4.0,"Quite nice, a couple pockets would be nice though untraditional, I suppose."
4.0,Pretty sweater!
4.0,"It flares out a bit at the bottom kind of like A-cut, but I still love it. I sometimes tie the front in a knot to fix that look. I get a lot of compliments on it!"
4.0,"I’ve worn it daily for about a week now and so far it’s very comfortable. I’ve gotten several compliments on the way it looks.<br /><br />Seems to be good quality. It lost one star because it rattles a little bit where it attaches to the watch, the tolerances could be a little tighter to eliminate the metal on metal noise from the band attachments being a little too small."
4.0,"Good, bright light.  Perfectly placed for walking the dog in the dark.  The only negative I have is that the batteries don't last all that long.  Not bad, mind you, for 3AA and the amount of light, but still, they do have to be replaced every week or so (we use it daily)."
4.0,"Beatiful cover up. A little larger than expected, I wear a 16-18 and syncing it as tight as possible, it's still a little loose. Definitely not going to stop me from wearing it though!"
4.0,Beautiful coat but runs small.  I'll keep it and hopefully get into it by next winter
4.0,Def cheap costume jewelry but it's flashy and sparkly and it works!!
4.0,Is good but little small
4.0,There are nice pajamas and my nephew loved them but they run small. I ordered him a 5T which is his normal size and they were to short in the legs and arms. Would buy again if they came in bigger sizes!
4.0,"These are super long, so expect that they will fit down to hour thighs.  the good thing that when worn under dresses they're kindof like spanx"
4.0,"Cute, comfortable fit. A little darker blue than in the picture but still a nice shade of blue."
4.0,"I love my black dress, soft and moveable"
4.0,"these are light and I love them, I wear them at the office because our office is always cold"
4.0,To wide...dinning
4.0,"Exactly as pictured, the fabric is nice and soft. If you have thick thighs like me order a bigger size. The pants fit me but just barely 😅 Some minor inaccuracies that I plan to alter out are the height of the hat (very tall), the colour of the fabric (which is honestly fine but I'm planning to tea-dye it for accuracy), and the bag is very unrealistic so I'm probably going to get a different one. Keep in mind that the ""patch"" is just a print-on. Great cosplay overall though!"
4.0,"Looks nice and neat, a little stylish.<br /><br />It was a little stiff at first, and the smaller strips of leather kinda stuck in a warped position because of the way it was flatly packaged, but they relaxed after a while.  I soaked it in warm water to help relax it, and applied leather conditioner afterward (conditioner darkened the color which I don't mind).  It feels completely soft and comfortable now.<br /><br />Fortunately there was no bad odor, although I see that a few other commenters received pieces with unpleasant odor.<br /><br />I have finer bones than most people, so it was actually too loose for my wrist; but I am handy so I drilled and moved the metal post over a bit to make it fit better.  There is a hidden staple that holds the keeper loop; you may be able to see part of the staple if you look carefully at one of the product photos.  I nudged it to be out of sight.<br /><br />I suspect there are going to be some variations in manufacture.  The piece I received doesn't look quite as wide as the one in the product photo, although the width listed in the official description is accurate for what I received.  The piece I received is a half-inch longer than the listed length.  And possibly the photo has a little distorted perspective; some of the product photos look a bit more impressive.<br /><br />Overall, the piece I received is really good quality for the heavily discounted sale price I paid.  I'm pretty pleased with my purchase."
4.0,holds lots of biz cards!!  the 3 smaller pockets were an added plus. quality appears to be pretty good.  very good for the price.
4.0,"Like these pants a lot. They are very comfortable, but they are not as long on me as they are in the photo. Also, they are a little sheer, so be mindful of what you wear underneath. I will definitely be wearing these a lot during the warmer months, but I needed these for BLACK PANTHER WEEKEND!!!!!!!! 🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️"
4.0,"This is a very pretty dress. It is super adorable, is nice and stretchy, and is pretty comfortable too. The length is great; it hits right at my knees (I ordered a medium and I am 5'5""). It is form fitting, though. I ordered a medium because that's what I normally wear, but I didn't think about how form fitting this would be for it to hang correctly. It isn't uncomfortable in any way, but I feel like I have to constantly be sucking in my stomach while wearing it (I just recently had my second child and definitely have the so-called ""mommy belly""). From the front and back, the dress is beautiful and I feel lovely wearing it, but from the side since I still have the ""mommy belly"" it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. Even with that, though, I really love this dress and look forward to wearing it more when I have tightened my stomach muscles back up."
4.0,Really like the metal frames and the UV lenses.
4.0,Cute an look great runs a lil small
4.0,My husband didn't like the fastners
4.0,"I really wanted to like this longer sports bra, but after an hour of yoga the band had rolled up under my boobs and definitely caused more problems than it solved. Maybe in a smaller size it would have stayed put, but then again in a smaller size I might not have been able to breathe."
4.0,My  Daughter loved it.
4.0,"Am glad i read prior reviews and i heeded by ordering a size ahead of my usual ,am usually a medium size and i ordered large,it was really fitted and its ok for me as i will wear it as an inner wear"
4.0,"Ordered purple, but top isn't purple. It's blue.  Tho I ordered the exact same size  as the yellow top, this is much shorter.  Therefore,  I returned the swim top."
4.0,Decent polishing cloth. I've tried it on a few things around the house. You still need some elbow grease to get it perfect.
4.0,"Great look, fits well, the material was a little less desirable."
4.0,"I love this style and the material is a nice soft, semi-thick material. I have ordered similar dresses from the same company, HOMEYEE, and I love them. However, i didn't like that print on the front does not extend to the back. (See photos) I should have noticed this before I ordered but it looks worse in person, to me, at least. If the colorblock pattern went all around the shoulders, it would look much better and not so cheap. Otherwise, it is exactly as pictured and very comfortable, a modest length while still very youthful and flattering. The side zipper is nice because it allows the dress to be more tailored while still easy to get into."
4.0,"Love the material, flow, fit and length. I’m 5’5 and 145 lbs. I normally wear M and M fit just fine."
4.0,(I order on my husbands account) I ordered the Blue dress in L. The color blue is Baby Blue not the Steel blue in the photo so it did not match what I wanted it for. I should have ordered an XL or larger. I have a brood back but an A cup. So my bust measurement is 40in. that was the only part that didn't feel comfortable. The style was cute and the fabric soft. I gave 4 stars due to the color being way off. I am returning this dress.
4.0,"Very comfortable, and helpful in easing aches."
4.0,Precio calidad excelente. Vale la pena.
4.0,"There's things that I like and don't like, but overall, it's a super cute dress. I bought a small and I'm thicker than a snicker.<br />Size 5 bottoms and med tops."
4.0,"Simply made, but expected that considering the price. It was easy to use, takes a little getting used to when trying to use my non dominate hand to fasten the clasp."
4.0,great price for a chronograph/watch. This is probably my 6th Casio over the years. They all fail the same way: the band cracks and eventually breaks at about two years. A replacement bands are the same price as the entire watch.
4.0,"I like the material , only problem is the front is kinda of not sewed the right way"
4.0,This is a pretty shirt. I have several tops by PB but this one seemed to run smaller than others. It's a true wrap shirt but struggled to wrap around me without looking too tight. Not flattering on my body. But the material and color were beautiful and I would have kept it if it fit my body style better.
4.0,Love everything but the clasp. It's a real pain!
4.0,"This is really pretty.  My daughter wears it in her cartilage piercing.  The way that the back screws on, she can't put it in by herself.  It also is hard to grip the ball shaped backing.  She has sensitive ears and is allergic to nickel & this doesn't irritate her ear at all."
4.0,I like everything about this watch except the price..Its def not a 295.00 watch..NEEDS A BACKLIGHT and thicker band to be at the higher price..
4.0,Got it for my daughter.  She loved it.  It was a little tight on chest.
4.0,"I will start by saying that I was sent the wrong item, which it seems as though others have had the same experience. I contacted the seller right away and they fixed it ASAP though. I got the right necklace and I love it, it fits perfectly and looks beautiful!"
4.0,Fits comfortably. Washes nicely. I think I will be enjoying this purchase. Ties could be a bit longer.
4.0,"Love these...super cute. It only gets 4 stars because one of my buttons is about to fall off, just gotta sew it on again. I get lots of compliments on these."
4.0,It fit great & I love the color
4.0,"I’m 5’4” 145lbs and ordered a size small. The jumpsuit is super cute and a good fit. I love the belt for extra sinching and there is a discrete zipper in the front for added ease when putting it on. I gave it 4 stars because when I tried it on, it was a little itchy. I’m not sure if washing it would change that, but under garments would surely help! Great price for the material quality too."
4.0,Love the cape so cute. Fits great around neck where no hair gets threw. Although it doesn't seem to be hair dye proof. But haven't tried it kinda scared I will mess it up.
4.0,Best for age 7+
4.0,The product is a bit on the bigger side but also I’m petite. Fabric is good. Design is not extraordinary but decent for office.<br />It’s a subtle dress.
4.0,"While this is a nice-looking, quality shirt, it's definitely what I'd call a slim-fit shirt. It's in my size, but the waist is still a bit tight and unflattering on my &#34;dad bod&#34;. If you're a slim, athletic type it might be a good fit. If you're the muscular type, it will probably be too tight in the shoulders and chest.<br /><br />For now, I'll take it as a sign that I need to keep on my diet and exercise and hopefully be able to wear this shirt by this time next year, though that may be wishful thinking because when I say &#34;slim fit&#34; I mean it. You have to be trim to wear this, no matter the sizing. They say it's &#34;regular fit&#34; but then suggest you choose &#34;one size up&#34; if you're &#34;big or muscular&#34;. So they're contradicting themselves a bit. Their second statement is the correct one: Buy a size larger if you're &#34;big or muscular&#34;. Do not consider this &#34;regular fit&#34; by any stretch of the imagination."
4.0,Love the style and comfort. However one strap is smaller then the other and you cannot adjust it.
4.0,the top was really tight and the bottom was a little big
4.0,"Like this dress. I bought the red one. Good fit,not very oversized, because I am size 16,but loose enough. It's shorter than expected, because I am 5'7&#34;. Looks unique, comfortable, 100%linen. Not great,but acceptable quality. Nice darker red color. Reason for 4 stars is :1.I believe it's overpriced and 2.I really would love it if it's longer. Still reccomend this dress and will keep it."
4.0,"Would recommend getting a size up, but the material is soft and thin, so wouldn’t plan on wearing this for the cold weather😅"
4.0,"very cute - small, order size up"
4.0,"If you are out in the sun for a long time, I would recommend wearing sunscreen even if this has UV protection. I wear this during hour long drives to work and when I still notice some tanning over a month. I've started using light sunscreen underneath just in case."
4.0,"I ordered the Grey Camo band. I received the navy band. I just thought it was bad lighting but in fact I received the incorrect item. However, it’s still a wonderful product. Just wish I could get the grey one."
4.0,"Wonderful gift for any Giants fan, i buy them yearly as gifts."
4.0,The color was different when I got it; I expected it to be a bit darker however it came out lighter. The best feature is the pockets though. Super excited to try it out this spring!
4.0,My niece
4.0,"Nice dress. Economical. Got 3. But material is essentially white with pattern on the outside. So if there is stretch, the white shows through the blue.... Doesn't look good. The other 2 patterns I took far more white in them so it was ok."
4.0,"I personally loved them. Everyone kept complimenting our ""Pizza"" costumes.  We sure had a good laugh.  I highly recommend this couples costume. It fit both our body types easily as well."
4.0,"Nice quality, just a little too large"
4.0,fits as expected. good quality for the price.
4.0,"This dress is great.  I didn't like the waist, but it was very comfortable."
4.0,"While it was just slightly snug, it will work great with a cargo vest over top. Loved the colors and striped sleeves. Saved me $15 from the one in a local boutique. The &#34;collar&#34; or top edging also kind of pops up, but again, will work with a vest! I'd recommend sizing up."
4.0,"I recieved my order quickly.  I purchased the red earrings and the color is nice and vibrant like the picture and not that awful dark brick red.  The design is the exact dupe of a pair I purchased at Nord****m for a lot more money but a beautiful grape color, so no regrets.  I knocked off a star because I have not worn them yet and cannot rate the comfort/durability of the earrings."
4.0,"Great, comfortable shoes. The cork has a nice, albeit, small arch. Runs a bit wide, but true to size otherwise."
4.0,My daughter wears them for dance classes. A lot of skin showing for regular wear. Quality is good.
4.0,These are nice every day earrings. Simple- big enough to be seen but not too big.
4.0,I don't know if really is leather but excellent presentation
4.0,I like these earrings but they are a little larger than I hoped or expected. But they are not too heavy for the size. They are very pretty and are good quality.
4.0,"This sweater is very comfortable, great over leggings on a colder day.  A belt helps give it a bit more shape definition."
4.0,"Has adjustable elastic on one end that allows you to adjust this to whatever tightness is necessary to keep this up on your face.  Nice material — very colorful.  Material is thin which is good & bad — Good because it’s easy to breath in them and they don’t make me sweat but bad in that, should you get a little winded and breathe deeper, the material is thin enough that it will pull toward your nostrils or mouth.  Overall, an easy item to keep around my neck in a COVID world that I can easily pull up to enter a store when required.  I don’t think this mask will stop much in the way of germs (does any mask that doesn’t look like Darth Vader or a HazMat suit??) but will at least get you into a store without having to trudge back to your car."
4.0,"These are cute, but the fabric is like a cheap fleece blanket. I didn’t want to try them on."
4.0,"This worked great for my daughter's Alien princess! However, it was a slightly uncomfortable fit for her head otherwise it wouldn't been a 5 rating."
4.0,"Comfortable but fell apart soon after bought i had to keep putting the back wooden part on, guess you get what you pay for."
4.0,They shipped super fast and arrived several days before I expected them. The gems are super tiny! So tiny I had to have my husband help me screw it in. They are exactly what I wanted. I ordered them for my cartilage piercings. My lower piercing it at an odd angle and the gem being so tiny it perfect for the placement. However I only gave them 4 stars because being labeled lip piercings is something they shouldn't be sold as. The gems are so tiny they would very easily pull/push through any sodt tissue piercing. Other than that they are exactly what I was looking for. I recieved all of them intact and complete. Picture included shows the lower piercing with this jewelry.
4.0,Very pretty but very cheap and insubstantial.
4.0,Is way longer than expected. I am 5' 10&#34; Will have to alter it. But still nice
4.0,This cape fits beautifully.  I get so many compliments when I wear it.
4.0,"This item was used as Christmas Gifts for my<br />Grand Daughters and<br />They are Beautiful, They<br />Loved the Gift and So Did I."
4.0,"I love the anklet, it looks great, shined, and was comfortable.  But it broke on a link and I’m still trying to fix it as it is a small link.  It broke 3 months in, so I couldn’t return it.  I would buy again, but I’ll try to fix this one first"
4.0,"When I took the hat out of the box and bag, it was a bit , well, oddly formed. The brim kind of curled in on the front and back. Hmmm. What to do? Got it. I whipped out my good ole Proctor Silex Iron, filled up the water tank, set it on synthetic, and dialed up the steam tab to full tilt. I started applying the steam to the undersides of the brim, tugged, pulled and bent a bit, and after about 40 minutes of trail and error, I got the bends out and a very nice overall lay to the brim. Next, I yanked off the thin ribbon and replaced it with a beautiful 1 1/2"" double sided satin polyester band. I also added it to the inside just to make it more classy. Take a look at the pic's. My little ugly duckling turned out quite nice, and there really wasn't any hard work needed to correct it. And it goes well with my Steampunk overcoat. Kind of a 1840's New Bedford Whaler look. A most cool little hat at a very good price."
4.0,Just got it today.  It is very pretty! Very sparkly and the heart is the perfect size. However my only criticism would be that the purple stone is very light in color...other than that its nice.
4.0,"Pretty decent shipping time, and a decent size and weight."
4.0,"Really a very nice hat. It didn't quite meet my needs, but I almost kept it just because it was so nice. This is definitely more of a cool/cold weather hat. No ability to have a neck strap. I needed more of a flat brim to cover my neck/ears. And it was for a warmer/rainy trip. This is very nicely lined as well. Very nice hat!"
4.0,Good material quality
4.0,I returned because it was too large. Cute dress however. I'm about 210 lbs (5'6') and the XL was too big on me. So I'm getting a L this times. Comfortable stretchy material.
4.0,Nicely frayed. Good Quality denim.
4.0,"The material seems a little thin to me, but nothing terrible. My daughter wore this about ten times last summer with a swim diaper underneath and she had plenty of stretch and flexibility in the suit. It's hard to find a long sleeved rash guard for kids but this one was affordable and did the job well. After some wear and wash the colors faded and were not as vibrant. I'm not fussy when it comes to aesthetics, I just wanted her to be covered, so this didn't bother me."
4.0,"I'm 5'5, 137, waist too tight and too short for me. Nice material."
4.0,"I love it, because it has my family name on it and it’s fits very well"
4.0,I bought this dress for an upcoming bridal shower. I really like it. I do wish it was longer (I am 5'10&#34;) but I bought some cute red sandalsto go with the dress. I love the pockets. I am 36 DDD and was concerned if it would fit...It does! Overall Happy with the dress.
4.0,Cut and comfort. But too large
4.0,Overall really comfortable- I’m regularly a side 14 in dresses and i bought an XXL in this like it was advised. My body is proportioned weirdly though so the top was very tight around my busy and arms and the skirt was huge with at least an extra 6 inches of fabric. Super cute though and fabric is silky like a Halloween costume.
4.0,While the stones are darker that the photo still a very pretty bracelet
4.0,It was big success. Granddaughter loved it
4.0,"This is pretty but a fair amount smaller than I had envisioned.  Regardless, there is a great color coming from it.  I know my wife will be thrilled to get this."
4.0,It was for my gd. It to 3 different brands to get one that fit. This one did. Great job!
4.0,cute as can be but small for my 6 yr old nephew. wouldnt get this for a kid over 4
4.0,"Just gave it to my boyfriend tonight, he says the cape should do the trick! He's no too excited about the UFO ring lol (we died laughing). Both are cheap quality, but are definitely worth it considering the bang for the buck."
4.0,I give four stars instead of five stars because I wasn't aware of the pattern on the stockings. I wish it would have included a picture of the pattern. Overall it was good.
4.0,Cute dress and very comfortable.  Waist is higher than expected and not as long as the picture shows but still looks nice.
4.0,I think this bracelet looks very pretty but it feels super flimsy. I doubt if it lasts very long but with the price point I can always just buy another.
4.0,Material is equivalent  to price. It’s a great every skirt for running around town running errands.
4.0,"These are compression socks and they are not easy to put on, take off.  What a stupid heading."
4.0,Looks more red then burgundy but<br />Hey It goes with the outfit I bought it for.
4.0,"This is probably the best overall running vest that I have found. It is very lightweight. The blinky parts on the back and front work very well in solid or blinky mode. There are large reflective parts on the front and back.It attaches on the sides. It has 2 pockets (1 large zipper) in the lower back. They are big enough to hold a cell phone, an energy bar, a flashlight, stuff like that. Each is about the size of your fist. There is also a key clip for your keys in the zippered pouch. It is very visible at night and during the day. It can be worn over winter-running clothes and light enough not to bother you in the summer. The shape doesn't interfere with my running style. I have had some trouble opening the zippered pouch when I have gloves on this winter, but I put a larger string on the zipper-pull and that solved the problem. I haven't been hit by a car (yet), so it works."
4.0,"Packaged Well. It’s pretty but the rose gold color is very coppery and it’s very dainty, more than I thought it would be. The rhinestones do not stand out, it’s all together a subtle piece of jewelry, which is not necessarily bad, some may appreciate that."
4.0,Clasps broke and bent already
4.0,"Real Nice, Real Thick, Real Expensive"
4.0,Comfortable Jean's and cute. They aren't kidding though when they say you will me amazed at how far they stretch. If I hadn't read reviews I wouldn't have even tried my pair on because they looked so small.
4.0,"I really like the style and crop of the shirt, but it was a little tight. Tight enough that it’s moticeable but it’s still quite comfortable material so I will still wear it on the daily. Wish I bought a bigger size, but otherwise, cute crop top!"
4.0,I got this for my wife. It fit her well. It is short and sexy.
4.0,Ordered to wear as a work uniform.  Will prob cut buttons off but they aren’t seen If you wear a sweater.  Love the pockets.  Will probably return for next size up as it is clingy.
4.0,My daughter loves it! It was exactly like the picture shown.
4.0,"I do like this belt. It fits me just fine, I just wish it was a bit stiffer so that it wouldn't get creases in it, but that's ok, especially for the price. Overall I'm satisfied!"
4.0,"The bottom runs a little small,  narrow at the waist but the top fits as expected.  For the price I'll be keeping it and using the top only"
4.0,Very nice jacket!! Just don't like the shipping...Jacket was delivered in a ziplock bag and wrinkled.
4.0,"Shorts fit as expected, strap length on bib somewhat small for taller folks. I'm 6'5&#34;."
4.0,"For this price, I didn't expect too much from these pants.  The cut and material were great although it was too long  and slightly too wide for me (I had to alter the length).  The fabric had loose threads here and there, but it is otherwise a nice pair of pants."
4.0,"Perfect fit I'm 5'7"" and 165lbs quality is good but not perfect. Washed a few times does need a light iron."
4.0,The fabric seems like it may shrink or so after a few washes but it is a pretty dress
4.0,"Fit my 14 yo son around the waist, length was a little short for my tastes so he just wears them for sleep. Fabric decent quality, like the color."
4.0,I’m 5’6” and 165 pounds and have a 32” inseam.  These pants fit great (L) but are a tad too short for me.
4.0,"Haven’t tried them out on the slopes yet but so far they’re good for the price. You can tell the foam fabric is cheap and could easily rip if not taken care of, but they look nice on.<br />The lense is perfect for cloudy & non-bright days, which is often what we get here. I’m glad I chose the 60% VLT. The tint isn’t overpowering which I like as well.<br />I’ll add more to this review when I use them outdoors, to see if they fog etc."
4.0,The &#34;e&#34; is exactly what is looking for. But the chain it came with is so short it looks like a chocker on me is it has to be child size. So now I'm left with having to buy a chain for the pendint which is kinda a hassle and makes this necklace more expensive.
4.0,Chain could have been stronger but it was beautiful overall
4.0,I wanted to add some color to my wardrobe and this was a perfect . this item is very warm and soft. I got it in a size medium and it fits perfect.
4.0,Got this for our daughter who is a bit obsessed with Thor. It looks great and seems fairly sturdy. We had to tie the elastic in back to make it fit our daughter's head. Some of the edges are a little pokey/scrapey so beware of that when putting this on or taking it off.
4.0,Extremely short dress. Closer to a shirt than a dress.. Definitely cannot bend over in these. However the dress is very pretty.
4.0,Casual and extremely comfy! Great winter outfit to look cute in!
4.0,Perfect. Just what I wanted for my daughters wedding
4.0,"A bit tiny, but still work."
4.0,looking forward to giving as a gift
4.0,Awesome but did have a strong rubbery smell
4.0,"This bag is bigger than expected.  I read the reviews and still didn't realize how big it is.  I purchased it to take on our boat so the contents would stay dry.  I do have one issue, the handle screws unscrew and the handle comes off with no warning.  I try to remember to tighten after each use and it's fine when I remember to do so.  Overall, it is a good bag and keeps my stuff dry."
4.0,Bought this as a replacement band for my watch. Works as a truthful replica of the apple watch band for people with the quick-release watch.
4.0,"This dress is pretty cute and fit nicely! I am a size 16/18 typically wear an XXL and this dress fits really good, but is on the long side. Which I love since I’m almost 5’10! My biggest complaint is the material. It’s comfortable but feels like I’m wearing a night gown or a silky robe. I was getting this for beach pictures and it’s very thin and I don’t like the material. Overall, it’s a nice dress but I will likely be returning due to the fabric."
4.0,"This is a bracelet for a larger wrist, but the opening is narrow, so if your wrist is very large, you might have some trouble getting it on. But I will say it's gorgeous. Its quality made with nice detail even on the inside. It also looks like old sterling silver, which I love. However I wear an 8"" bracelet and, while it fits, it tends to turn sideways on me, like my wrist is trying to escape through the opening. I've tried to adjust it, but it is resistant to that. I don't want to force it and possibly break it, so I'm just living with the occasional inconvenience of straightening it out. I will say the turning is slowed somewhat when it's stacked with other bracelets. I do that often and it looks fabulous worn that way. With those reservations, I still recommend this bracelet. It really is of surprisingly good quality and quite beautiful. I'm glad I made the choice and will enjoy wearing it for some time to come."
4.0,"This purse is real nice, great price I have a ton of purses so Im very picky, I got this purse and it fits everything great the only downfall is I don't like gold accessories, the picture looks like silver but when I got it, its all gold :(  Slightly disappointing but will still buy from amazon :)"
4.0,I love reef sandals and these are as good as any other.  Though I'd rather it cost a few bucks less and not have stupid bottle opener in the sole.  That's just lame.  Its pretty much like mounting a bottle opener on the back of a mens urinal...No thanks.
4.0,Good looking and beautifully made. Thanks
4.0,Zipper can be difficult without help from an extra set of hands. Fit is awesome. I felt like Marilyn Monroe in it!
4.0,These fleece pants are pretty & very soft.  My only negative comment is that the waistband is tight!  Does not fit the size.  It’s elastic though so I’m hoping it will stretch out in time!
4.0,Great quality. Arrived on time.  A little bigger than expected for a compact wallet.
4.0,A small gift for a girl. The price is good. I have not given it yet.
4.0,Cute and comfy just got it today. Can't wait to wear it at the beach next week.
4.0,"loved this necklace and the packaging it came in, even included a beautiful card.  I bought this for myself and enjoyed opening the blue envelope it came in, also great for storing."
4.0,Order one size done
4.0,"This didn't include any sizing info when I ordered, but the belt I received is marked size 38. It measures 37-41 inches inside when buckled, with five holes 1 inch apart. (That's not the same as pants size, which is typically a couple inches smaller than actual size, so size 38 pants are usually at least 40 inches inside at the waist--keep that in mind when sizing for a belt.)<br /><br />The leather is nubuck, which is like suede except that the outside of the top grain is sanded to make it soft instead of the underside. Nubuck is tougher, holds up better than suede for a belt.<br /><br />The leather is a good thickness, a bit over 1/8"". The outside is soft like suede, the inside has the usual leather grain. For as thick as it is it remains more flexible than most leather belts.<br /><br />It's 1-9/16"" (just over 1-1/2"") wide. The buckle is 2-1/4"" wide.<br /><br />The color, on both sides, is a lighter gray than appears in the current Amazon photo. You can see in the photo that the thread used is red and gray. It shows in front of and behind the loop. The edges of the belt show a little of the native leather color, which appears as an indistinct tan stripe along the length of the edges.<br /><br />The metal buckle has an ""antiqued"" finish that makes it look like it's been used for a while.<br /><br />Comes in a sheer black fabric pouch with an elastic drawstring.<br /><br />Daniel Marlin is recent brand from India. The dark mark on the lower left corner of the buckle in the Amazon photo is the logo."
4.0,I returned these earrings after determining they'd be too small for the intended tecipient.<br /><br />They were very cute and sparkly & I would have kept them for myself but I would rather have the doves be a mirror image in both ears. These faced one direction. I also felt they were a bit over priced considering their size.
4.0,"This is my first ever two piece bathing suit, and I love it! My only issue is, I thought the top would be longer ( a little more coverage), but overall I love it!"
4.0,"I got both the green pair and clear.<br /><br />The green are truly unique and look more expensive than the clear.<br /><br />Perfect for dinner parties going into holiday season.<br /><br />Great size, not too big, not too small...a great statement size.<br /><br />Just gorgeous.<br /><br />The only problem is that the backs should fit tighter for the size and weight."
4.0,"This lotion has a very nice scent that is noticeable without being overwhelming. It's just thick enough to hold it's shape when you squeeze it out of the tube. It has a creamy feel to it, and a small amount of it goes a long way. It doesn't feel greasy or heavy, and it leaves a very silky feeling behind after rubbing it into your skin.<br /><br />It's being marketed as two separate creams, one for hands and one for feet. But both lotions feel the same. When I checked the ingredients to see if there was something different between them, both lists were exactly the same."
4.0,a bit see through but otherwise its good as long as you wear a white bra
4.0,"this item is excellent.  great for working out, I bought one for me and one for my girlfriend."
4.0,"I love this dress, runs a little big but a quick trip to the seamstress got it in top shape. Ladies, don’t go a size up."
4.0,Very beautiful dress just run small
4.0,"Great quality material and I got so many compliments. Only complaint are the buttons aren't that great and the material is thinner than I like, but its still great."
4.0,"Ok its nice, its just a tad &#34;tent&#34;ish for my liking but it is still falttering enough to wear out and adds a little spice to an outfit. I love the shoulder cut outs and they are flatteringly shaped. The cut out in the back is a nice touch as well. There are so may holes in this shirt its hard to figure out where put your head at first lol  but once its on its ok. I am 5'2'' 145lbs, have a 36 D chest, and I got the Large bc it is a juniors shirt. I am happy with it, but I think I could have also gotten the medium and been happy with it. I like the shirt a lot and may consider getting it in another color for early summer!<br /><br />Im going to FL next week and I cant wait to wear it  with some cute ankle pants and nice earrings."
4.0,Looked cheap arrived broken don't  waste your hard earned money
4.0,"I like them, thanks."
4.0,So adorable and somewhat adjustable. Just a bit small..my granddaughter is just getting into a size 7 at 2 years old so I was surprised when these shoes were smaller than expected.
4.0,"Bit creased, but sure the folds will flatten out soon. Love the scarf it came with."
4.0,"Lovely,  will enjoy this for a long time."
4.0,Silky soft.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:3b7400fd3ae4ebf5ed187b0cf2163b12]] Love these!! My original<br />Pair I bought at a swap meet store in LA!! These one have poor rhinestone work other than that I love them I will order more and fix the rhinestone work myself!! It’s very true to size
4.0,I love the length and feel of these pants but the elastic around the waist is really loose  and the ribbon doesn't lie flat which I don't like.
4.0,Small but not too bad for the price
4.0,"The watch arrived earlier than promised.  The case is a little larger than I expected, and probably thicker than it needs to be.  The strap is faux alligator, but very thick and looks sturdy.  It is stiff out of the box.  I don't feel the need to replace the strap, and a genuine alligator band would cost more than the watch did.  It's a nicer strap than I have received on some much more expensive watches. The gold hands contrast sharply with the face, and the dial is uncluttered, making the watch easy to read at a glance.  Casio's date windows tend to be too small for me to easily read, but, hey, this watch doesn't have one so problem solved.  It has a second hand, which not all watches in this style have.  That is a big plus from my perspective.<br /><br />The packaging was minimal and might not make much of a presentation if this were a gift, bit it was not a gift so I don't care.  The instructions were generic, but if someone needs instructions to set a watch as basic as this they probably lack the skills to log onto the Internet, anyway.<br /><br />I was looking for a quiet, two tone watch.  This one fits the bill nicely, and at the price it is offered is a bargain."
4.0,The stuff is nice but might not be used in summers and hot places...only good for cold weather...I got a discount from Amazon and amzreviewtrader.com....thanks...
4.0,"it is a nice belt, fits a lot of dresses or long shirt, also it won't make your waist looks big. It is a little cheap made, but well deserve the price."
4.0,"These are better quality than the straps the Fitbit comes with; last longer even though they seem flimsy and lightweight, they can take the beating I put them through."
4.0,They are convenient. They work. A little uncomfortable on the nose at first. You don't wear them long enough for it to be a bother.
4.0,"It fits very well, but I'm only 4'11. The sleeves are the perfect length for my arms, so I don't believe someone taller will be able to fit this. When I tried the coat on, it was perfect! When I put it on yesterday to wear to work, the part of the zipper that you pull- broke off. That was disappointing, especially since it was my first time wearing it. The coat is very warm though and that is saying a lot as I live in Minnesota and I'm anemic. Overall I am very happy with this purchase, I just wish the zipper thingy would have lasted longer."
4.0,"Love the shoe, bery comfy and light. Ordered larger than needed yet was just about too small. Had to return (pay $10 shipping), then reordered another 1/2 size up"
4.0,"I liked the style of these pants, very cute V front. I order based on the size chart for my weight and it was too big. I am 5'5"" and 177lbs and ordered the XL. It was roomy in my waist and hips, which I didn't expect based on the chart. I was actually expecting it might be tight. It was like the chart's measurement for your hips (35in) was the waist on this XL pant. The material was soft and the length was just barely right for me at 5'5"". I'd say these might be petite lengths."
4.0,"great fit, sleeves could be longer, I'm only 5'5&#34; and the sleeves were short. The fabric is stiff, I ironed it but every move every sit makes wrinkles."
4.0,Was very coiled once I opened it so maybe stretching and playing with it a while will help it to relax. Fit well on my 6 year old and could be used for maybe up to a 10/11 yr old
4.0,It was real cute it was for my daughter who is 15 and she so small it fit perfect on her! Great price too!
4.0,Very pretty dress but I would maybe size up for a better fit. It is very form fitting and the front is a little low.
4.0,I ordered this for myself. I had to give it to my daughter. The torso length is so short it rode up in the crotch area. The rest of it fit me fine. I am 5'7” so average highth. Comes with a same  fabric belt. Can be dressed up with heals or with flats.  The material is nice heavy and soft. It dies hang low in the arm area. A bandeau will be required. I am bumbed I cannot wear it but my daughter looks great in it. It is a bit short on her Torso as well but workable.<br />I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest unbiased review.
4.0,"This sweater is cute and warm. My 4 year old wore it on our trip to the Canadian Rockies and she didn’t complain about feeling cold at all. It’s also super soft, stretchy, easy to wash and maintain. It’s slightly long on her but the body was just fine and this was a 5 to 7 year size. Overall I feel like nice and warm for the price but runs small."
4.0,The first picture is a bit misleading as it appears that the metal is more of a silvery color. It's my fault for not looking at the other pictures to see that it was actually yellow gold tone. Pendant is still pretty. The chain is a bit much.
4.0,I just wear this around the house and love it for something fast.
4.0,"I loved the suit, but it seemed big (it was long on me). I get lots of compliments on it."
4.0,The socks are seamless so there's a few stray strings along the edges but otherwise these are really great socks for shoes with open ankles like Vans or Keds or &#34;boat shoes&#34;.
4.0,Love these head snoods they are perfect<br />Only giving it 4 stars because i didnt got nor black nor red nor white 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
4.0,Great for water aerobics!
4.0,They fit like I had hoped. Would have been helpful to have some size indication on the product details.
4.0,Good fit nice material little stretch but not a lot.
4.0,"Buen artículo, el único problema es que no existe la combinación Negra, Roja y Azul o Negra."
4.0,"The watch is a great value and the fit and finish is very good. The reason for not five stars does relate to the movement not hacking, otherwise a very nice purchase"
4.0,Beautiful and very comfortable. I am 5'2&#34; and the sleeves are a little long. Besides that I love it!
4.0,I really like the material but the sizing is way too small. I’m usually a large but according to this brand I’m an XL
4.0,Great band!  It snaps in securely but takes a little time detaching when I want to change bands.  The color is true to the online photo and the closest to Dark Navy I could find.  I have a medium size wrist and bought the small because the reviews mentioned the strap being too long and the small is plenty big.  4 stars only because of difficulty detaching but love the look!
4.0,"I orders this necklace for myself and I was very pleased with the necklace. it would have gotten 5 stars but there were some flaws... One, the pendant itself is bigger than i was looking for but it feels heavy and well put together, and Two, the string is not the best quality if feels more plastic when you first get it, but other than those two things i am very pleased."
4.0,"It's a neat package with the quality case and different lenses but the frames sit crooked on my head. I wear glasses daily and have a number of different sunglasses that i habr no problems with so I dont think its my head. These are not a super great fit but for the price and the fun accessories, they're worth it."
4.0,"Estan muy bonitos, el pequeno detalle es que los aretes estan muy grandes, aun asi muy hermosos"
4.0,Cute but snug. They would be good for someone with skinnier calves.
4.0,"Very nice quality and style, but really too small for me (guess that is why it is called a &#34;Mini&#34;).  Nonetheless, I decided to keep it and use it for an evening out.  I would not use it for an everyday bag because it can not hold too much, and I carry a lot of stuff!"
4.0,"The colors of this dress look exactly like the picture. Really pretty. I'm 5'7, 140lbs, DD breasts and bought a size 8. Everything fit great except the amount of cleavage was just obscene! There is one reviewer who said she had the straps brought up for more support up top.  The straps are stretchy, so heavy breasts make the dress go lower and the cleavage is, well, a lot. I could have taken this in to be altered,but chose not to do that and returned it. I think a good fit is possible for large breasts if you do some work with the straps. I felt very sexy in this dress. I do recommend it."
4.0,My husband wears size 13 shoes and I was surprised that these fit him so well.  Heavy duty snaps to close. Good product for the money for Halloween costume.
4.0,Loved it it was a little large but you can tighten it with the front ties so that helps.
4.0,Daughter loves these.  There is a door to protect the wheels but it sticks easily.
4.0,"Way too long for me and would like better without the pockets.  Otherwise, comfy.  I use it as a winter nightgown."
4.0,"Only four stars. I would give it five, but there were no care instructions with the garment, and with the amount of wrinkles and the distinct smell of sizing, it needed washing before I would wear it out.<br />The fit was as expected. I ordered a size larger than I would normally wear, after reading other reviews. And I don't believe that I will be able to wear a crinoline underneath, due to my height being 5'11&#34;. Otherwise, it fits ok."
4.0,One shoe had a little less support than the other but the price was  really good so a thicker sock worked. Great walking and travel shoe. Not as ugly as most orthopedic shoes so I was very happy about that. Really good value for the brand
4.0,"This dress is super cute! I just wish it fit me.  I read the reviews and some said it fit fine and some said it fit too small.  I went against my better judgement and ordered my size (a large) and it was more like a medium.  I was super disappointed, however the company was great.  They offered to replace, refund, or give a discount if I kept it.  I opted to keep the dress and it fit my friend perfectly.<br /><br />The style of dress is true to picture, the fabric is not thin and flimsy, it is made to wear.  I did order another dress a size up so hopefully I will get one I an wear.<br /><br />I did receive this item at a discount for my honest review.  The words and experiences expressed here are my own."
4.0,"I ordered a pair of these cute shoes for my 14 month old in the size of 14-18 months. He's a fairly small baby for 14 months and these shoes have just barely enough room for his tiny toes. I would recommend going bigger from what your child's age rage is for each different size. Otherwise, they are soft, seem comfy, and are too dang cute!"
4.0,These are a great pair of sunglasses for $10! They're cool looking and they fit really well. Just wish they didn't come a little dirty when I got them but I was able to wipe it off without much trouble.
4.0,"These are child sizes- so order WAY up. I am normally a size 8. I ordered the XL and it is snug. Other than that, appears to be good quality. FYI the arm band stripes are screen-printed, not actual fabric stripes."
4.0,Run small because of fleece and memory foam.
4.0,arrived as advertised.
4.0,Definitely worth the money. Was surprised at the quality although the pants were a bit large. Other than that it was perfect!
4.0,Le quedo un poco largo de  la manga
4.0,Just ok for around the house
4.0,Didn't like the fact that the silver turned the ear black. Nice earrings though.
4.0,"Really like these- comfortable.  However, I bought size L as wear 7 1/2 and that was per size guide  These are a bit loose and could probably have gone for a medium."
4.0,A really nice looking top.
4.0,"This is definitely a summertime top, very thin material but very cute!"
4.0,"The material was not what I expected, and it was to sheer for me"
4.0,"I absolutely love the look of this all on its own... I have all 3 colors and the only thing I would recommend is to size up, even if you're not the body type that would usually size up for any reason. 11/10"
4.0,"Purchased for slim preteen(5'2, 85lbs) & the XS actually fit well. The quality is good& color vibrant. The shorts themselves are slightly shorter than pictured. But the green nearly reached his knees. He loved them."
4.0,"Nice band but a little short for a man's arm. Being fabric, it is very comfortable."
4.0,Sizes are a little off. I got a 4t for my 2.5 year old and they fit great. Actually returned the men's small for boys 11/12 and this fits my 9 year old boy.
4.0,"Good thin simple cotton fabric, but, seriously? no buttons? It makes it easier to adjust, but it is unconventional"
4.0,"I wanted this watch as a kid, and now as an adult I wanted to just make the inner kid in me happy. Watch was smaller than I remember it, but I still loved it. Showed it off to everyone, got some laughs and it was ok. But I love how plain and simple this is. Super light, you don't even know it's there! I even put my GW9400 on the shelf to keep this baby on. This morning I realized this big gash on it. And I guess that's the only draw back. It's just not durrable. I don't remember doing anything too rough but somehow I did this with only a few days of wearing. Bummed. But for a moment I was able to make the broke kid of the past happy. And that was worth the price I paid for the watch. Thank you."
4.0,I like them. Comparing them to my old pair of fingerless gloves: these are a bit tighter because they are less stretchy. There is actually a seam sewn around the thumb. They look good. Can wear with black or brown coat.
4.0,Easy to put on with the zipper. Not warm like a jacket but keeps kids warm after swimming at the beach or pool. My kids are always cold after getting out of the water so worth it.
4.0,Very nice purse the only issue I have is the liner is Very cheap
4.0,"Great product, good quality, came as described. Well recommended"
4.0,Well made. The pockets are a good size for larger cards.<br />I only wish I knew if it works.
4.0,Small around the chest and a little bit long.
4.0,PERFECT I LOVE THE DRESS !!! The material is so soft and good quality it’s pretty long but I’m 5’4 and it fit just find no need for heels definitely worth it the chest ear can be a bit small if you have a large chest but over all a perfect dress !!!! I got a size small
4.0,"The waist was in a weird in between place on me, so it was not flattering, also didn't love the fabric-it was the kind that rough skin sticks to. On some body types this may be flattering, so give it a try."
4.0,"Looks like a real mandalorian helmet. It is a full helmet, all around the head, but goes up a little in the back when it is on. My 12-year-old liked it."
4.0,"My necklace arrive fairly quickly. I don't really like the chain, it looks kind of cheap. The pendant is very beautiful however, and the sale price was excellent!"
4.0,They seem to be a little short in the foot area for me but have enough stretch that it's doable. Not to uncomfortable. They go up to about the knee area.<br /><br />I liked their appearance. Very pretty! Colorful.
4.0,"Skinny women or teenagers will find the 18-inch chain more comfortable. For me, being a plus sized woman, the chain was not quite long enough and felt more like a choker. This would however make a nice gift for the right woman. The pendant is sparkly and pretty. The heart shape is nice for Valentine's day or Mother's day. I'm talking off one star because the chain is so short. Otherwise it is really a high quality item.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one free necklace for review purposes."
4.0,Super cute hat and good fit bit have not even worn a week and the logo is starting to scratch off
4.0,"This necklace is quite pretty, but the color is not as expected. But the color is still quite nice to me, so I still pretty much like it."
4.0,Worth the wait on shipping
4.0,"These are very cute, quality socks, only wish the price were a bit lower. Have never spent this much for a single pair of socks in my life!  But the cherries are irresistible.  :)"
4.0,its a good wallet :)
4.0,Wanted it for a jack skeleton costume accessory. Did the job!
4.0,I loved the dress but it is a wrap dress. I was not expecting that . But I got so many compliments. I’m 5’8 1/2 like 200lbs and this was a great dress.
4.0,"It fit really well. It was a stretchy material for the shirt. With the hat it is a velvet material and it wasnt too big. Still wore it like in the picture. Necklace was really nice, but it broke while I was wearing it."
4.0,"I love this skirt so much, but it is not for small waists. I have to wrap it around more than normal and then crisscross the strings to hold it up."
4.0,Nice top. I ordered it bigger than I normally would and it fits
4.0,So pretty n fashionable just love to ware it all the time . It goes with everything
4.0,"Comfy,  waist high, pretty"
4.0,Runs a little small but great quality
4.0,Thick material soft very pretty shirt high-quality really pretty sequin work. If it’s a bit small for my five-year-old granddaughter I ordered a size 6 she is slightly taller than a normal five-year-old and is thin I kept the shirt because she likes that I would likely Where at seven I’d guesstimate she weighs 45 or 50 pounds
4.0,"I got the biggest size, but still a bit small. I normally wear a X-Lg to 2X. It fits good, just tight in the stomach area."
4.0,"i like this shirt very much.  It goes with shorts, jeans or just about anything."
4.0,Well made and good quality but recommend buying 1 size up than you would normally buy.<br />I ordered medium (my normal size) and these are more like small.
4.0,My daughter has a small foot and didn’t realize how small. Cute shoes! She will wear them when she gets bigger
4.0,"Good product the beads do not slide when you move your hand, which I like"
4.0,"Yes, these are actually warm and comfy. They are not very flexible; but they meet the warm criteria and they also can be worn to go outside in mud, snow, etc."
4.0,"I lift weights like 3-5 times a week and wear this brand almost exclusively on leg days! They do roll, but I honestly don’t care about that, all shorts roll on me. They are on the tighter side and hit about mid waist, so I do sometimes have a camel toe, but again, I that’s not a MAJOR concern to me. I prefer the shirts that this brand makes that is high waisted, but for the price, I’m VERY happy!!"
4.0,Ok so normally I don't have a problem with workout pants but I did have a little issue with these ones. They were a little big in the hip area and rolled down a little bit. It could probably be an easy fix with a size down so I'm going to go out on a limb and say order a size down in these. I am normally in a as large and that's what I got here but I think I could have easily had a better fit with a medium. The pants themselves are super comfy and feel more like cotton than spandex which is a bit of a difference for workout pants. I myself like the cotton feel more so I did not bother me one bit.<br />I received these pants at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review
4.0,They fit just a little small but I can still wear them comfortably. Nice color.
4.0,"The vest runs so small, I didn’t get to try it out. I’m 6’ 170lbs and XL wasn’t remotely close to fitting, probably would need an XXXL. Immediately upon opening the inside packaging, I noticed the vest looked dirty. Although the bag it came in was sealed, it was dusty on the creases where it was folded. Phone camera overexposed image for some reason. Other than that, nice styling but I’ll oribably go to a store to try vests on."
4.0,"Very pretty...date loved the look. Definitely different and unique. However, by the end of the dance...which was only three hours. It was falling apart. Hope she can fix it to hang onto it as a keep sake."
4.0,"It's a $20 purse, and for $20 It's a good one. I wish the straps were not so cheap feeling. The place for your cell phone isn't deep enough for a bigger phone. I like the pocket on the outside for my keys and the little purse inside is great for holding gum.  I love the size not to big or not to small and for the money it's not bad. Not bad at all"
4.0,"The dress is beautiful! I bought it to attend The Beauty and the Beast live show as Belle (Village Scene). I did noticed a few seams came undone when I opened up the package to examine the dress. Especially right under the zipper on the side, the seams came undone about a couple inches so I had to stitch it back together myself. But overall, the dress fit perfectly & I was comfortable the whole night enjoying the show."
4.0,Fots and feel great but they gave me a size up lol its ok ill just wash and dry it to shrink it. But if you want to keep it the same size just hang dry it. I would go true to size and if you want it loose just go a size up
4.0,This is a birthday gift for a friend. I think she will like it.
4.0,The color was not exactly as pictured. It's more of an off-white than white. Also it fits larger than I expected.
4.0,Very small. I ordered a large and it fits like a small. But its good quality. So just make sure you order a size bigger.
4.0,It is really cute but to small
4.0,"Ordered a size larger like it says to, but still on the small size. When you have a built Marine it’s hard to find the right size."
4.0,"Cute dress but measurements a bit off @ top half of dress. The day I wore it, quite a number of persons commented that they like it. If the other patterns didn't have the same colour belt, I would buy another. Oh well..."
4.0,Great dress other than the weak zipper.
4.0,Soft. Very pleased.
4.0,"I love the color, material, and fit of this dress. It is loose and comfortable in all the right places, and fitted where it needs to be. It is very long and I have to hem it (I'm 5'6"")"
4.0,"You can have a real snugglefest with this pullover. It is soft, wooly and warm. It looks nice and doesn't shed. True to size, it fits well. Easy care, machine wash. Fun piece for chilly weather."
4.0,leggings are a little large but still will work.
4.0,"We picked these up for our 13y/o daughter's Halloween costume with the hopes that she'd wear them as a daily boot but they weren't very comfortable to her so they've been sitting in her closet ever since.  They seem decent for the price point.  I would put them on par with a show you get at Target or Payless Shoes.  I think if we get her a decent insole, they might be a bit more comfortable.  Here's her review:<br /><br />""The boots are decent. They have a good style and quality but it feels like they have no insole to them. I suggest you add your own insole to the boots. I wore these for a Halloween costume and my feet were in pain after an hour. (4 stars)"""
4.0,"Appear to be well made. They feel solid and the optics are good. They'll work well for carrying around due to the well designed case and the overall compact size. They'll never become my go-to glasses, however. I was hoping for something that I could read with and walk around with at the same time. Unfortunately, the lens falls kind of midway in my sight line. Its thus too high to either read with or to look at a distance. If I pull it down lower on my nose its better but I really don't want to wear them like that all the time. Thinking I'll be happier with a bifocal like design that puts the reader part lower."
4.0,I wear a us 16...I got a XL. It fits perfectly. The top is very cute & flirty. Nice fabric too.
4.0,Like the boot but very very light weight not sure how it’s going to hold up
4.0,"I would have given it five stars except for sizing.  I ordered XL based on prior reviews.<br />Probably should have ordered Large.<br />I weigh 135 lbs,<br />33"" waist,<br />36DD,<br />5'4"" tall.<br />The dress waist is 37' and therefore the whole top is too big.  If you get the right size, it's a beautiful product, very well made.  I think the blouses might be on the smaller side and possibly will be a bit difficult to put on."
4.0,Will work great for my project.
4.0,"I have several things wrong with my feet having had frost bite in the past, these being leather have a tendency to stretch so i ordered them one size smaller. Going up stairs is the problem as they have by force to slide off the feet so they can be a little hard to walk. However, on a flat ground they work great because of force. So far they are working just fine, i would recommend them if there is a interest and trying to make a decision. Beware you will feel when you first wear them as if you are leaning forward but that is done to take the pressure off the heal you will get use to it if you understand that."
4.0,I love Lizzy James jewelry. This is the sixth necklace I have. I was expecting a true royal blue pearl in the center but it's more of a dark gray. It's still very nice but different than I thought it would be.
4.0,"Awesome ring, good quality, slightly large. Can I return it for a smaller size? Size 12"
4.0,Such soft and silky but thin fabric in the back. I took one star off because the lace in the front is a bit stiff and could be a softer companion to the back. The back does give full coverage (I am 50+) and is comfortable.
4.0,Nice quality silver. Works as described.
4.0,Love the pockets but they fit weird really tight in the legs lose in the waste
4.0,"They fit was perfect.  They were comfortable and warm.  The only criticism is make sure you wash them before you wear them.  Where they touched her skin irritated it, this did not happen once they were washed."
4.0,Smaller in the waistband area for the size but worked for my daughter to use for what we ordered it for.
4.0,Typical costume jacket
4.0,Looks just like the original.
4.0,My grandson loved his new pj’s and that’s all that matters.
4.0,"Not sure who wrote the copy for the listing, but there isn't any cotton on these (and you wouldn't want cotton winter gloves anyways, so that's a good thing)  The gloves are quite large which I guess is to be expected since the 3AA battery pack has to package in the gauntlet.  The fit of the gloves on the hand is a touch larger than typical but not unreasonably so.  Heat is definitely noticeable on the back of the hands, less so in the fingers.  The blinking lights on the back of the hands is hard to see in direct daylight and would probably get to be pretty annoying if you were doing something at night.  I would have preferred a more discreet or less noticeable status light, or perhaps something that is inside the cuff.  I wasn't able to tell how long a fresh pair of rechargeable eneloops would last."
4.0,Very pretty on my 9 year old.  Wore them to a special Etiquette class brunch and brings them out on many occasions.
4.0,Great material. returning for a Large.<br />5'8 170 small is too tight
4.0,Good Amazon find! The fabric is very lightweight but there is a thin lining layer so it's not see-through. The cut and pattern is cute and true to the picture and the fabric feels fine. No stretch though! The sizing was a little odd - the waist where you see it cinches in is tight while the arms are baggy on me. If you have a big chest or broader ribcage you may have to size up.
4.0,They came with a really nice case & microfiber lens cloth. The fit is better for youth than adults.
4.0,"I dig these! I wanted Red tassel earrings. I like the length, and it's a nice blue red ( not an orange red ). I was surprised by other reviews saying that they are cheap. Uh, yeah, hello! They're under $10 dollars!! So what do you expect? They don't look ""cheap"" to me, and they are exactly what I wanted. If they don't last,  it's not a big deal, as they were UNDER $10 Bucks!! 😁"
4.0,Good fit and he doesn't find them distracting when he wears them. They are a nice looking pair of glasses.
4.0,Was too big between n way too long sleeves
4.0,Very nice but fits large making it difficult to wear.
4.0,"Well made and warm, good workout basic leggings.  Doesn't ride down when doing squats as expected so all and all a good value.  Great construction and materials.  You can't really go wrong IMHO."
4.0,"Love the color but it does run big. I wish I would sized down. Sleeves are too long and neck is kind of loose, looser than I would like"
4.0,This dirndl is really cute but runs a little small. Would recommend ordering one size above your normal dress size.
4.0,"Maybe it is my head shape, but the front of the hat is &#34;domed&#34; a bit for my head and it fits different than expected. Other than that, it is a quality made hat that has started several conversations!"
4.0,"I got this for a gift that was used to put a half dollar coin in that corresponded it the recipients birth year. All the people who got them loved them. 4 stars because I thought they were going to be a but bigger, but still not a bad gift."
4.0,"This is fantastic product,light weight, stylish, fit on my face very well. It protect my eyes from strong sun light. It is good for sport, I like it during my jogging. It is same as displayed on page. Keep it up."
4.0,Enough storage for a gym backpack. Nice breathable mesh for when you have wet and smelly gym clothes and shoes. I only wish the bottom of the bag was sturdier so my clothes could lay flat and not bunch up. Still a great backpack!
4.0,"I love the style off the shades, i thought they were a little larger but can cope with them."
4.0,"They are great, much better than what I have been using so far because they easily stretch and almost have no impact during the ride.<br />I am glad I read the reviews and saw you need to be careful with the sizes, so mine fits perfectly.<br />The one issue I have is that the pockets are too small for my phone. Seriously, I don’t know what they were thinking fits those pockets."
4.0,Worked for my costume
4.0,"I received that package it all beaten and looked as if someone tired to take that hat out of it before I got it. But the hat was in good shape and satified with the product, but the shipping and handling was terrible."
4.0,Material very soft fit great
4.0,Fit well and filters were great quality. Kids liked the patterns and cousins wanted masks like them quickly. They were a nice option for masks for the kids to wears. 4 stars because some of the stitching was not the best quality- not bad enough to return as we still needed to use them but noticed and a bit of a pain.
4.0,Beautiful colors in this 3-tiered necklace. The beads are smaller in person but I'm still happy with it.
4.0,"Had a thread out on the top area, doesn't effect the shoe, just the look."
4.0,For the cost this ring is beautiful. My husband really likes it!
4.0,So we gave this to my husband for father's day and he said when he was in zipping through the store that everyone was commenting on the awesomeness of his t-shirt.  Well done!
4.0,"This is a cute, lightweight summer dress, but it does run small. I usually wear a medium, but will have to return it for a large."
4.0,Good quality. Ran a bit bigger than expected so if you are between a large and medium go with medium.
4.0,Cute little romper
4.0,This #as a nice dress but it was very small and I had to send it back.
4.0,"Daughter loves it, but everyone else thinks it is a giraffe......which is equally as cute!"
4.0,Very comfortable and material is thicker than I thought but breathable. A little bit larger on the legs.  Looks like dress pants.
4.0,"good design, more than adequate size, effective when used"
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; 145lbs 36DD. It fit nice, length was good. Just looking for something a little more elegant."
4.0,My BF just loves them!!! I love them too!!  Will see about ordering another pair or two!!
4.0,"Watch is stunning, but... Aren't watches supposed to come with extra links? Or as advertised?"
4.0,I absolutely love this pendant....my only concern is the necklace it could be a little thicker.
4.0,Great value for the money. Very soft and washes well.
4.0,Does the job.  Search for best price.  All about the same quality.
4.0,"A little cheap looking, but otherwise very durable and comfortable. People compliment them all the time"
4.0,"Fun, pretty colors. These aren't the softest or coziest socks, but they do keep my feet warm. There are a lot of small strings on the inside. They do seem well made. I was initially concerned the strings indicated they wouldn't hold up after several wearing and washings, but they are a durable quality."
4.0,haven't used the goggles yet they seem to be good quality.
4.0,"I LOVE this skirt! It makes me feel like a princess. It is a little long, but I am a short gal so I made sure to size down since the elastic is stretchy and I’m glad I did. This color is see through so you’ll have to wear a slip underneath. I’m 5’ 2” with a curvy build and got a small."
4.0,"I couldn't be any happier with my new watch. It came very nicely packaged. It came 2 days early. I can't say nothing bad about this watch, other than it's kind of hard to see at night, but that's Okay! The price was great! A good quality watch overall. In fact when I get paid next week, I'm going to buy another one. Very happy with my purchase!"
4.0,"I love it. I am short, so the length in the sleeves are a little long. I just folded it over. I love the material which feels smooth on my skin. It washes beautifully without shrinkage or fading.  I definitely would get it in another color."
4.0,"I bought this to accompany the Baggallini Everywhere Travel Crossbody Bag & have enjoyed using it.  There are multiple segments for money & other papers that one accumulates & often get misplaced.  There are a reasonable number of slots for credit cards & more in the crossbody bag.  I have only two suggestions for improvement: 1) there should be a small opening in the plastic covering the driver's license slot to facilitate removing the license & 2) it would have been nice if the tethers for the keys & the wristlet were both on the purse so that you could put them on either side of the zipper opening.  As it is, the wristlet is always on one side & the spare, which I use for keys, has to go on the other side.  Personal preference would have been for the keys to go on the side where the zipper opens.  But these are small complaints & I would recommend this wristlet."
4.0,"I wish that this shirt was more flexible in being worn on/off the shoulders. It's got a very wide neckline so it doesn't stay on as well as I'd like, but is fabulous for wearing off the shoulders. I love the sleeves though."
4.0,"These are pretty but poorly made, which is understandable considering the price. Everyone I've tried on has broken within a few hours of wearing. 🙁 Some places aren't covered in gold paint and other places are actually misshapen. For the price you get a lot of cute bracelets, they just won't last.<br />Edit.<br />This seller's customer service is outstanding. I didn't even ask for a refund of try to return them, cause I thought I just got what I paid for, but the seller contacted me offering a replacement or refund😯<br /><br />Give this product a try if you're looking for cheap pretty jewelry👍🏼"
4.0,"It was good, but I tried to put it on and the thumb broke. it was also a little tight but after all  it was normal! quite nice over all! I would say be careful when taking it off and on, and if it is a little small, a bobby pin will do. So I would say good for casual wear!"
4.0,Very pretty. Would be 5 stars if there was some elastic in the waist. Still pretty nonetheless. Got lots of complements.
4.0,Plush footbed and good outsole— comfortable on hardwood floors. Good quality for price.
4.0,Color never faded. High quality material and very well made. I’ve received many compliments. It’s a little bigger than I wanted but can still wear it
4.0,I would like to give the bag a 5 star but the first time that I used the shoulder strap the connection became unsewn from the side of the bag. Otherwise it’s nice!
4.0,It's cute .  .
4.0,"The first picture is me in Medium, the second is me in Small. I am about 5'3"", and about 128 pounds, and vary between a small and medium in everything, so I ordered a pair of each.  The smalls fit my waist, but were snug, and they were tighter over the hips. The main weird thing though is they are smaller around the thighs.  I might have kept the smalls, although they were a little shorter overall than I wanted, but they were too tight on my legs (not TIGHT, just no extra room).  The Mediums were bigger in the waist, but not too big, plus the tie string would take care of any extra looseness. These were still smaller around the thighs that you would think a pair of shorts like this would be, but it was fine.  They are a little balloony above the bottom and below the top, but my rashguard tops will cover that, and I don't care so much about it. They matched my tops perfectly and have pockets, so I""m keeping the medium. UPDATE: wore them snorkeling in Grand Cayman and in the river waterfalls in Jamaica. Color has held up great while washing and they definitely weren't too big."
4.0,I ordered two of these for my daith piercings. They seem to be good quality but I was expecting it to be a more silver color. That’s why I only gave 4 stars.
4.0,"Product fits as expected, is silky<br />  Only negative is the button is ugly."
4.0,"My daughter wear size 10 in  regular USA Size , so this jacket was perfect for her<br />Why 4 stars because the fabric of the jacket was not stretch enough so make limitations in the movement of the arm"
4.0,"Not quite as heavy as I was hoping for, but overall great quality for the price."
4.0,It is great came fast and is nice came in a cute bag aswell if you love four leaf clovers this is something to get
4.0,Very warm and cozy. Only issue was that it’s a bit long and needed to be folded in half to not be too bulky on my neck.
4.0,Adore although the clear one I wear is more a cloudy white which I didn't realize but good quality
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He enjoys it very much. Just the right size and thickness, not to bold.Quality is very good."
4.0,"I wanted a light colored, sleek, durable, easy to clean sun glove to protect the backs of my hands from sun spots while walking, boardwalk, lounging, sitting in car.  I gave it 4 stars because I wish they offered a color darker than bone, such as a light tan, to match skin tone better and would show less visible stains.  I wear &#34;black&#34; fingerless leather gloves while driving so I don't have to worry about stains.<br />My ladies hand measurement is 7&#34;, ordered size small and the fit is snug but not tight.  Material is smooth and rubbery.  Length is comfortable just above my knuckles.  Logo is in white on top of both wrists."
4.0,"Not one size, a lot longer than expected. Pinches skin sometimes"
4.0,The dress was very nice but did not fit me at all. I followed the size chart and ordered a medium. The dress is really stretchy and kind of heavy which made it look like it was sagging and way to big for me. I ended up returning it.
4.0,I was pleased.
4.0,"Nice watch; easy to set, easy to read dial. Basic and stylish."
4.0,"Was a little big for my son, but he'll grow into it in no time. Material was nice."
4.0,Get the size bigger. This runs smal. Thankfully he only wore it for a few hours
4.0,Super cute! I haves very tiny 8yr old so I normally order 6/7 but after reading some reviews decided to order an 8 and I'm so glad I did tiny bit big but a 6/7 would've been too tight.
4.0,Feels good on skin
4.0,Stone looks great but its smaller than I expected. I was hoping it was a tad bigger but I'll still wear the neclace.
4.0,"Great product for the price. It's close to being true-to-size but I would recommend buying one size larger than you need. Also, the drawstring is just for show so the shorts cannot be tightened."
4.0,The gem is nice.  The chain could be a little thicker and really should be able to see that it is 14K gold.  It does not say it anywhere.
4.0,"The material is very soft and comfortable. It does run a little big. The long sleeves were a little long and that made the v neck not fit right. But the short sleeve one fits very nice. But for my price of $10, its a very nice shirt"
4.0,"This is a really cute top, fits as expected & is lightweight but well made.  The fabric is sheer as described, I'll need to buy something to wear under it that doesn't show thru, and the coral color is, well, coral.  I thought it would be more pink like the picture, but computer monitors vary in color displays.  Overall I really like it, would buy again in another color if the price were a bit lower."
4.0,Poorly sewn together but otherwise cool gloves!  Mine came with a hole in the finger at the seam which is disappointing but can easily be fixed with a few stitches.
4.0,"very nice, just right size. I have black one just like this one and love both."
4.0,"i have large male feet that depending on the brand range from 13w to 15 in the us. these fit me just fine there warm and soft and snugly as you could hope I love wearing them. the leds are bright and constantly cycle tho the rainbow of colors when on. however to turn them on/off you have to bend down then unzip the battery compartment and pull out the battery holder and flip a very tinny switch. they do not light up when you step or turn off after a limited amount of time there either on or off, and trying to turn them on in a dark room is very hard and so it turning them off before bed with the lights off, so there is not much point to the leds. if i had it to do over i would of got the ones with out the leds. and if they were to ever improve these i would either make the switch be like squeezing the pony's nose or have it work like little kids and light up on each step."
4.0,"I have no problem with the jacket except the zipper is sometimes hard to zip up. It has a great look, the material is great, it is warm, and I was pleased with the shipping and manufacturer."
4.0,Le entra agua no pega bien
4.0,This dress is beautiful i love it. Only gave it 4 stars bc its see through on the bust. Im a c cup so it shouldnt be. Otherwise its great very breathable.
4.0,Dress worked for the bridal party I went to. It was a little tighter on my butt (I do have a bigger butt) so it was very fitted.
4.0,"Came in such cute packaging and in a reasonable amount of time, as well. One thing I wish about this product is that the steel was a little longer. My cartilage gets irritated easily causing it to swell, and this earring was too small to allow the bead to have enough room to screw on once in was in my ear. Pay attention to the gauge size too!"
4.0,"I love this sweatshirt,  it's a little short,  but I love it!"
4.0,Great fit doesn't fall down
4.0,"Just your basic pair of riding gloves. I'm not to picky about my gloves there not expensive, they fit and keep their grip on the handlebars, that is all I need."
4.0,"Comfortable socks, but I was expecting 12 pairs of different socks not 2 packs of 6 pairs of different socks...not really a big deal, but just to make it known"
4.0,"Warm and cozy with thick, soft fleece lining, but also heavy and bulky. (Reminds me of an old-fashioned kid's snow suit.) Perfect for lounging around the house; definitely not for ""athletic"" activities, or anything but the most casual occasions."
4.0,"Nice glasses. I did not like them for me. They are nice and big (which is what I wanted); but, they just didn't look good on me. Maybe I would have liked them in another color; but, they are going back. I ordered a different pair in another style. It is free to return them, so, I would definitely give them a try if you're interested. They were also very comfortable."
4.0,I love this style.
4.0,I have been looking for boots like this for a while. Comfortable cute but they run a little large so go about 1/2 size smaller!
4.0,The color is as pictured. Soft and comfortable material.
4.0,I like this piece very well. I feel this is a nice piece to round out an outfit. I am a turquoise fan and this is very pretty.
4.0,Great looking!!!!!
4.0,Item received
4.0,I couldn't believe these would fit!! Glad they do! They remind me of Halloween gear though. Kind of loud. Very stretchy. Love the zippers. Definitely not your daily wear. Club gear maybe?
4.0,"Beware if you have a thick neck, I bought this set for me and my girlfriend. She has a thicker neck then me, so they ended up fitting a bit tight on her but for me they fit perfectly. They also look exactly like in the pictures."
4.0,I am 5'5&#34; and 165 lbs. I ordered the medium. I had to get the dress altered in the bust and sleeve area because it was too loose. Overall I loved the dress. It was stretchy and fit like a glove. Great look for the price!
4.0,"Pros: great sparkle, ok quality for the price<br /><br />Cons: they sit a little wonky on my face. I’ve never had this problem before so I’m pretty sure it’s a design flaw with the sunglasses, not my face."
4.0,"Although this chain looks very delicate, it is holding up very well."
4.0,A little big but I can still wear them. Also I haven't worn them yet but I can already tell they will probably get very uncomfortable if I have them on too long. Other than that I think that they are so cute and look exactly like the picture. They will be perfect for my bridal shower.
4.0,"Too small,. kept it anyway. Was a gift, didn't want to hurt anyones feelins at Christmas so I didnt send it back, I kept it."
4.0,This swathed is whimsical.  The only reason I did not give it a five star is because of the material. I thought it was a knitted sweater but instead it is a cotton blend. It is not see through. It is still wearable.
4.0,"A pair or two were broken, one doesn't stay on my ear for some reason; but you get what you pay for, for the price I'm not mad. Other than that they are great; don't make my ears green, are comfortable to wear for a long period of time ( I work 12-14 hour shifts at work and wear them the whole time.)"
4.0,"Very cool looking,works well but expensive and not so easy to put on/off.I bought a ton of them though.Not for large wrists !"
4.0,this is an extremely nice product however it runs quite large it actually fell off my wrist even though i tried to make it smaller. I will gift it to a larger cousin as it is too nice to return.
4.0,"Fits well. The bottom is a cross cut design, that worn with high waisted skirt or pants, won't expose your belly button. Which is something I am glad about! It's less green, more teal. Like an Eagles teal. Which I don't really like. Arms and bust fit nice and it's quite slimming. Another like!"
4.0,It works great it came a different color that I didn’t order but still works great.
4.0,Serves its purpose for putting a tile on my car key chain after losing my overpriced car key....only two wishes to improve it wish the strap was longer so I could wear on my wrist and wish the screw didn’t come a loose in my purse almost lost my tile maybe some loctite will hold it
4.0,Always get complimented for the shirt when I go out. Nice material feel. Moves well
4.0,"It’s light and soft, not too thick. Intended for daily use and to layer in mild cold weather. Great to use over thin garments like a v neck shirt or spaghetti strap. Buttons haven’t come off yet. Here’s hoping."
4.0,Very happy with the fit of the shoes.  They are comfortable especially as a back up pair of shoes for an emergency.  So small I can carry them in my purse. The elastic does not cut into back of heel which is nice. Sizing was correct in description.
4.0,"As I have not worn them yet,it's hard to review.But,initially I like the look of them."
4.0,"Love how dark the lenses and how oversized the frames are. They are lightweight and yet they look expensive, alike to Celine. My only gripe is that everyone else mentioned receiving a hard case with their order and I did not! Sad to not have a proper case for them but at the low cost you can’t expect too much."
4.0,"Very sturdy, does not bend like a metal clip would, it's a little large, but that's my fault for paying closer attention to the details.  Over all a nice clip."
4.0,Very comfortable just a little short
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:69028587c933035aace6f623e6127b12]] Looks good but kinda cheaply made.<br />Bought it as a gift, hope he will like it. Seems sturdy, i got the double one since both our names start with D so i'll be wearing mine. Only one came with an extra bag covering which was a little weird<br />If i change my mind about this product ill edit my review"
4.0,Order a size smaller. Maybe even 2.
4.0,"Super cute Choker options! I loved the variety this package offered; however, I felt like the claps slipped off of the choker too quickly. I wish they would have lasted a little longer."
4.0,"It fits fine. A little baggy under the sleeves, but not too noticeable. Comfortable."
4.0,"Great little vintage look dress! Classic pinup cut with a fitted bodice and a full skirt is perfect for every day casual wear but versitale enough to dress up for a night out! My only complaint is that I feel it runs a bit big and wish it came in an xs because the s is a little bit big on me- but luckily it's easily fixed by adding a wide waist belt, which I planned on doing anyway! I was thinking I might try washing it in hot water and putting in the dryer to shrink down to fit, but I'm sort of confused by the care label which says 95% cotton, 5%spandex, 10% spandex, 90%polyamide with a lining 72% cotton, 28% polyester so I'm a little hesitant to try shrinking it<br />For size reference, I'm 5'7&#34; 110lbs, 32D, 25, 34 and typically wear dress size small/2, occasionally xs/0 and got this in a size small and it's a bit too big around the bodice and at the shoulders. Wearing a wide waist belt remedies this some, however above the belt it does look a little large around the bust and arms still.... not that it looks TOO big, just not as fitted as I'd like this style to fit.<br />Overall this is a fantastic dress, it does run a bit big so side down would be my recommendation. Other than that it's perfect classic pin up attir"
4.0,"Great quality, works well"
4.0,This is great! Love this bag. The quality is great. The color is good. Super comfortable and has great storage and different pockets. Very light weight. Nice to take on bike rides but also works great for my son at school. This was shipped quickly and packaging was great. Very happy with this. I would deffinitly recommend this to others. I recived this product free/ discounted in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,Wonderful quality for my child's school uniform.washes nicely and needs little Tom no ironing. Only compliant is minor pilling after multiple washes.
4.0,Came quickly. I thought it would fit better. And not that warm. But maybe that is just me.
4.0,Looks great and my wife likes it's loose fit and comfort. The print is pretty and the fabric thin and cool to wear when hot.
4.0,"Good bag, it is lightweight and the material seems to be waterproof. The backpack is made to hold an good amount of weight. My only complaint is that the arm straps are small in width. I am about 6ft tall but skinny so they tend to fit slightly off where they should. But besides that one small thing the backpack is a good purchase"
4.0,"The wig was not exactly as it looks in the picture, but close to it.  The front on the wig was slightly longer than the back and there were a few strands that were fuzzy and not curled.  I purchased this item for a concert and I got a lot of compliments, so it fulfilled its purpose.  Overall, I was pleased with this item. I also received it very quickly."
4.0,"It’s good, does it’s job! Nothing fancy. I got it as a Halloween costume, but then I poured during trick or treating and I was the only one dry when we got home!"
4.0,Cute! I wish they came with a backing of some sort as they kept falling out. I lost one the second time I wore them. :(
4.0,I ordered a medium it turned out to be larger than I thought. The quality is good.
4.0,Nice and durable. I would buy it again
4.0,These shorts are super cute! They are a little longer than I would've liked but I just rolled them up a little. Very cute and very comfortable.
4.0,This actually arrived before schedule. It was exactly as it appeared and runs  a little small.
4.0,Cute pair of Barbie looking shoes that were really cheap when I got them. Better quality than I expected and comfortable to walk in.
4.0,"Tested these out this morning in Toronto, Canada.  It was 23 degrees fahrenheit, wind of 20mph, and windchill of 3 degrees fahrenheit. Wearing thermal socks underneath these boots keep my feet warm and allowed no wind in.<br /><br />These boots are bulky and I wore them for 3 hours as I walked the city outdoors doing night time photography.  I could of went longer but the sun was up when I finished along with crowded streets.<br /><br />My pants fit over the boot and no problems getting them on or off as I ordered 1 size up.<br />For the price they appear to be a great boot.  I will be back to post pics and an update as I get more use from them."
4.0,Love this sports bra but if you have big boobs it’s not for you. The cup fits great but the back is SUPER loose...
4.0,It came in time and the colors a beautiful. For some reason I thought it would be bigger but it looked great with our indian clothes at my sisters wedding. Some pics of it are on my IG: parinpink
4.0,its just what I expected! really cute in person
4.0,"Nice necklace, good sturdy chain."
4.0,I have purchased Genie Bras before and knew which size to get.  They arrived sooner than the estimated date.  The box was obviously from a different batch of bras as the colors listed on the box were wrong but the bras inside the box were what I ordered.  The size tag which is stamped inside the back of the bra has already worn off whereas my older ones still have their product stamp and they seem a little thinner than my original Genie Bras.
4.0,"Runs super small! I’m normally a medium in swimsuits but had to order an XL in this one. Still a little tight on the bottoms, but overall happy with it! Order two sizes up."
4.0,it came in red color :/ but it is still a good duffel
4.0,Dress is overall cute. I did not expect it to be two pieces so that surprised me but it's not a terrible design. The color is nice but the dress is surprisingly warm. I like it even if it isn't exactly what I was expecting.
4.0,Super cute and classy! Only down side: the tassle constantly flips upside down...**Update: I put a tiny dot of glie with my hot glue gun & foxed the problem**
4.0,"Love these wonderful little finger gloves, I am able to use a curling iron without burming my fingers now!!! They need to be a little thicker, so, we can hold our hair on the end longer, but they are really the best idea ever!"
4.0,Lightweight fabric<br />Can be worn a variety of ways<br />As expected
4.0,These very colorful shoe laces are a perfect enhancement to high black sneakers and they get a lot of positive attention and comments.<br />I am enjoying them
4.0,"The watch is nice, but the pins to remove links are stuck in the watch and ended up pieces of the (2) links in the process."
4.0,"I really like the pair I got for moderately cool temperatures. They're super comfortable and keep my feet warm at normal temperatures. However, in winter they're not keeping my feet as warm as I imagined they would. That's a disappointment since a big reason I bought them was because they're labeled as polar fleece. I'd gladly buy pairs in additional colors if their fleece kept my feet warmer on cold winter days. (That would be a whole lot more convenient than getting another pair in a larger size and wearing extra sock layers...)"
4.0,Good quality. Heavier than anticipated.
4.0,"Cloth is very thick and nice quality. Colors are great. Style is great. The shape fit perfectly. But this is not just 2 or 3 sizes too small, it is like 5 sizes to small on the length size. The width for the US medium version is perfect, but it is so short I thought it was intended for children.<br /><br />And for those of you wondering, I have purchased a number of Korean shirts before and they were proportionately longer for their American size medium (XL in their country) and accurately described for size measurements. This brand will run very short just be aware. If you are a sized medium and about 5'4&#34; you will be good. Anyone taller beware."
4.0,"For the most part, the colors shown are accurate but there is a lot of dark blue which must show as black on the computer. It's a good fashion accessory with a loose knit that does allow the air to circulate."
4.0,"These split skirt undergarments are great for the palazzo pants I wear frequently. They are lightweight but smooth and very comfortable. However, I found the pettipants a little skimpy...I was expecting them to be less ""clingy"" and I REALLY dislike the lace trim. I find it scratchy ( even after washing ) and will remove it, besides it's extraneous to the product."
4.0,It was a smaller than expected. But good quality.
4.0,"I like the look of these, they work great and hide all personal info except the one strip where you can put your name. They are aluminum so they bend or dent fairly easily."
4.0,"The Good:<br />-Comfortable material and GREAT construction<br />-Good colors and sporty design<br />-Reebok logo reflector + other reflectors for the detail conscious.<br />-I am 6 ft and it perfectly sits on the knee.<br /><br />The 'Can do better'<br />-A bit too 'lightweight' so, very summery.<br />-Shallow pockets. My phone fell off when sitting in a chair."
4.0,Material is a bit thin but flattering dress.
4.0,Made from a soft formed material that was very comfortable to wear and not too heavy. High quality ribbed ribbon ties and nice saturated color.  Was a bit large for my 11 year old but would fit an adult fine.
4.0,"I’m 5”1 112 pounds and ordered an xs!! For the price the material is nice! I would definitely recommend this dress, the only downfall is the chest area, if you have a bigger bust you might have underboob and you can’t wear a bra because the back is sheer"
4.0,"Booty shorts for sure. It’s maybe short if youre tall? It wasn’t too bad on me. (Large, 5’8)"
4.0,"Very pretty bracelet, smaller than I thought.  I had to take a link out since I have small wrists.  I will be wearing pearls on my wedding day and this will match perfectly since it has pearl fillings inside the hearts."
4.0,"I bought these for my Samsung Gear 4 and they  fit perfectly and look great, my only issue with them is getting the sizing right as these will stretch out a bit over time, I do like my watch a little on the tighter side so it isn't sliding around and these loosen up over the course of a day. Over all Happy with my purchase as they look great and do fit great."
4.0,"My little brother and I are avid legend of zelda fans, so when I saw this, I knew I had to grab it for him as a Christmas gift. However, I didn't look into the product enough because it's a mini backpack. Don't make that same mistakes I have and make sure you know for sure that you're purchasing exactly what you think you are."
4.0,"These are very stretchy and comfy. I bought them because they are high waisted and I was hoping they would help tuck my tummy in after the baby is born. I'm stil 37 weeks pregnant and I tried them on when they came in and they stretch right over my belly. I've already worn them a few times because they are so comfy and don't roll down. My only complaint is that they seem to snag easily. I would wash them by themselves, inside out, and on gentle. However, for the price and comfort I definitely think they are worth it."
4.0,"too big, but most hats are"
4.0,Small in the arms
4.0,its cute. just what i wanted
4.0,"This bra is not bad. I'm a 38A, so it's hard to find comfortable bras in my size.  I bought a few other bras at the same time and this one is slightly tighter than the other two.  It's definitely the best push-up bra I've found in that size, though. The decorative back doesn't always lay flat and It's hard to mess with it while the bra is on.  It is a cute bra though, and I would recommend it."
4.0,One of the only options available for pumps
4.0,Just like the plastic sporks you get at Kentucky fried chicken!<br /> Agre utensil to leave at school for lunches !
4.0,"This is a nice ladies bag. It is a midsize bag. The exterior looks well built and looks nice but the interior looks cheaply made. Its hard to get to the bottom of the interior compartment. Well, who looks the bag from inside, it looks nice and fancy from outside and I guess thats what matters."
4.0,This dress was very flowy and fit as ordered.
4.0,It's awesome but a little smaller than i expected.  It's doesn't hold as much as I thought it would.  I would have liked it a little wider. I love the skull design!
4.0,I like it very much I believe it will be something my daughter will have time to wear and grow in to. It's her favorite colors.
4.0,"Got the socks as an addition to my girlfriend's birthday present. She loved the assortment of colors, and they fit just fine."
4.0,"This was given as a gift and the recipient loved it! It's very pretty, lightweight and airy."
4.0,Great size to fit all my stuff. Nice knowing the safety and security features it has. Only one thing I sort of don't like is that the material is kinda shiny. But the good far outweighs that.
4.0,"I just my shoes in today, my son was super happy wouldn't take them off!!!  They feel and look very nice, i like the material !!! A good buy."
4.0,"Beautiful tie for the price, but not the best quality."
4.0,Cute sunglasses. The nose support also made of metal and is hard compared to the silicone style.
4.0,"They are too long for me, 5 ft 6 in tall, otherwise good after alterations. Glad they are made in the USA 🇺🇸,!"
4.0,It’s sturdy and can stand on its on. Has three compartments. Only down side for me is it doesn’t have a pocket on outside for quick access to phone. Has short handled and a shoulder strap. I removed the shoulder strap.
4.0,Smaller than expected.  Chain is gorgeous
4.0,These are a good bit large even though I measured appropriately. the pockets don't go down very far at all. They are very nice material wise and they have a Layer underneath the top layer shown but its a bit too big once again to be effective. Overall the main problem is that they're just too big and I would get a size smaller than what you think you need.
4.0,"I guessed the size, based on all the reviews, to go one size larger. I fall closest to the XL on the chart, so I bought XXL. Very glad I did. It’s a tad large, but looks great, not like I’m swimming in it. This has a very flattering sliming hourglass shape. Drapes nicely without too much flare.<br />I like the material. But was not happy with the black details on the hemline design. It’s screen printed on with some heavy thick ink stuff.  I’m not sure how that will wear, if it will crack and peel off or fade out. I’ll hand wash and dry flat just in case. The olive green is fantastic so I’m keeping the shirt. The hemline is not too short in front for leggings, but I’m 5’4”.  Now that I know my size, I’ll be ordering more 👍🏻"
4.0,Bought this as a gift for my sister in law and  she absolutely loved it!
4.0,"The neck wallet is very functional.  No more fumbling in the airport boarding lines or at customs. The neck strap length seams a little peculiar but does the job. I carry my phone, boarding passes and passport in one place. I will be buying additional ones for family."
4.0,"I bought a small and it fits like a large. Also, the fabric is very stiff and scratchy."
4.0,Had to give it away!
4.0,"Update: After one use the picture is already getting small scratches. Boo. Not a bad product by any means, just won't stay pretty as long as I'd hoped.<br /><br />The smaller one may match, I'm not sure, but the one I got doesn't match the photos. Realistically, it may be better long term given it has a release button. Still, it's annoyingly unexpected. The holder is a bit fatter than I'd expected. Design is good. Build looks durable."
4.0,"I ordered a large thinking it would be better to have the shirt fit alittle loose. However, the long sleeves were too long for my short arms. But, the color was good and it has survived two machine washings."
4.0,I've used this bomber jacket for a while and like it. It looks good and fits well. The only bad thing I've noticed is that some of the stitching has come undone after a little bit of use and I see little strings of cotton every now and then.
4.0,"I like these shoes a lot, they are easy enough for my 4 and 6 year olds to put on.  I bought blue and pink.  The pink ones had a bubble in the material but it’s hardly noticeable.  The kids love them and after a couple wears, seem to be holding up well.  My kids also have wide feet but these fit fine for them."
4.0,Bought this dress to attend my brothers wedding in Mexico. The dress was navy blue with a beautiful floral pattern. I liked the high neck. It was a bit large around the armholes. I ordered a size medium.
4.0,The fit was very snug but it was great for my costume.
4.0,Pros<br />It's very light weight<br />It feels very comfortable on ear<br />It's stylish<br />The cuff is easily adjusted<br />The price is good<br />It came with a box<br />Con<br />The inside of the box looks very cheap<br /> It's smaller than I thought
4.0,"Very nice watch. I really enjoy the transparent back to view the mechanics of the watch. It has been sturdy and withstands the rigors I get to put it through. It is a bit loud as previously mentioned in other reviews, but I have not found it excessively distracting. Its self winding mechanism is a nice feature, but if you do not wear it for several days you will have to reset the time and date - just a note to those who may be used to battery operated watches. That being said, there is a nice vibe about it being self-contained and not attached to disposable power that needs to be replaced periodically."
4.0,Super cute for the price.
4.0,"I am 5'3"" and 150lbs. I really love this costume but I'm thinking I needed an xlarge. I'm afraid to bend over in fear that a seam might burst. This is a really well made costume and super stretchy but I feel like its not true to size. I don't know I guess it could be that I have no curves and look like a damn rectangle but I normally wear a medium in just about everything and that's what I ordered but it's too small. I would give this a 5 star if the size was accurate. Anyways I'm still gonna wear it!"
4.0,Nice bag.. Packaging could be better for the price
4.0,The tie wasn't as red upon arrival as it looked in the picture.
4.0,"I am a female with a pretty normal/small head and I thought this fit me fine.  It isn't watertight, but I didn't buy it to keep out water, I bought it to cover up my alopecia head (bald).  It is adorable but one thing that drove me crazy is that the thick rubber covers both of your ears, so if you are trying to chat with friends or hear your children you will feel like you are in an isolation cloud and wonder if you are talking too loud.  Or you will hike the whole thing up and look like a conehead so your ears are exposed.  Or give up and yank it off and then let your toddler play with it until it drifts off into a lake and is lost forever (that's where mine ended up).  Also I had to put in contacts because glasses made the whole thing bulge out weirdly. I also managed to rip off a flower when tugging it down over my ears."
4.0,"Although some of the reviews mentioned that this article tends to run on the smallish side, I thought ordering a large would do the trick.  It fits snugly, but not uncomfortably.  Love the pop of color and its softness."
4.0,"They run little small but if they’re even a little small they’ll rip easily. Order a size up, the elastic is super tightened anyways. You very likely won’t regret ordering a size up based on how they fit me. The ones in my size haven’t ripped yet in months of use but the small ones did. I ended reordering these in a larger size because they’re the softest pajamas I’ve found. They stayed the same in the wash so far, still like new or at least too close for me to tell any difference. They don’t get the little pills on them from washing either"
4.0,The material is really thin but seems breathable for the summertime. The design though is absolutely beautiful!! Just as pictured if not better. My dad wasn't disappointed and I'm so happy
4.0,"I was super excited to receive my jacket in the mail and opened it right away.  The material is VERY soft and plush - more than expected.  Wearing it feels like I am wearing a blanket (in a good way).  I read the other reviews that said that the jacket runs on the larger side and I 100% agree.  I ordered a size smaller than I normally order my jackets in and it fits well.  I wear XS/S tops and usually order size medium jackets so that I have more wiggle room if I am wearing a sweater under the jacket.  I ordered this jacket in a small and it works well if I was going to wear a sweater underneath.  If I was only planning on wearing a shirt under the jacket, I could have probably even gone to an extra-small.<br /><br />You can probably tell from the picture but in case you can't, the jacket does not have any buttons to hold it together.  The hood is super cute and overall the jacket feels warm."
4.0,"A little heavy on the face, but they look good!!!"
4.0,These workout pants fit well and are very comfortable. I can wear them for the purpose intended or just around the house and neighborhood.  I was not disappointed although to fit my waist size I needed them shortened.
4.0,"This ring is great looking, with a nice weight and comfortable smooth inside. The ring is very reflective and shiny so it tends to pick up the colors of what it reflects off of. This is common with a shiny ring; I personally don't like this but that is a matter of preference. I only gave it 4 stars because all the pictures show it being a little shiny but still flat, so it won't really reflect which is not the case. If you don't mind the shiny outside this is a great value for an everyday ring.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review. I also want to say that I take my reviews very seriously regardless of any discount because I myself rely on the great reviews found here on Amazon."
4.0,"I have extremely small wrists so I’ve found that when I tighten it as much as I need to, it doesn’t stay on that length well. But that could easily not be an issue for someone with average wrists. LOVE the color in person, however I was expecting something a little more golden. Not what I expected, but still pleasantly surprised! Super cute and overall happy with my purchase. Finally get to wear my watch and have it elevated to go with cuter outfits"
4.0,"This is a cute top for work or fun. My only complaint is that the pictures are misleading. It appears to be lined but it is not, it is completely see through lace like material. For me this is fine, I can wear a cami underneath, but I thought I was buying a lined top. I'm a 34ddd and a size 5/6, I ordered a medium. It's a tight fitting shirt. If you're in between sizes you should go a size up."
4.0,"My daughter wears this several times a week. It’s a great lightweight, reasonably priced hoodie."
4.0,4 stars only because holes and one of them was as strait as a banana other than that they are real nice
4.0,"It fits perfectly, true to size, neckline plunges a tad too low for me, but great buy"
4.0,".this product is cute and is like the product described, but it was a little smaller than i had expected, but overall, it's a cute sweater."
4.0,"The dress is so flattering and is tailored well. However, the material of the skirt portion is a cheap weave and pills easily. It’s not a durable piece, sadly. I have worn it maybe 4-5 times and already notice visible wear and tear on the fabric, despite the dress only being worn to work."
4.0,My daughter likes these a lot!
4.0,The dress is amazing!!<br /> I'm 5 foot 9 my height is in my ribs and the dress actually touches the top of my feet.<br />  I'm a DD 42 and holds the girls just fine.
4.0,"Like other said, Scarf is not light pink like in picture, a kind of a darker salmon pink, the other color is a darker blue-greyish color.  It is big but not as big as picture seems to suggest which is great because it might have been too big.  I like it, it is very soft and feminine. Took 3 weeks to get here, If you order and don't mind the wait I would recommend it to others and would purchase from vendor again."
4.0,I gave it 4 stars because it didn't fit exactly as I expected. I thought it would be more like a shift dress but it is pretty fitted. I've had 2 kids so I dont like anything tight to my baby flab stomach. I ordered the Medium but should of got a large so it would have been looser around the stomach area. I am 5'3 135lb and wear a 36 DD. It fit perfectly on my top area and it was a long enough in the front and back. The material is very nice and well made. It feels very similar to piko material (bamboo & cotton).
4.0,very cute shirt.  have'nt washed it yet to see if it will shrink.  Very much like the pictured one
4.0,Love this bikini! The top was a little snug for me. I'm normally a 34A so I ordered a small and it fits a little tight around my sides but nothing to bad. Bottoms for perfectly!
4.0,"We like it very much, only one thing that we concerned about is quality of the lock. Seeming this is small, it stuffs a lot."
4.0,It's nice color we with good quality of the products.<br />I bought it as a gift for someone..
4.0,Smaller than expected but is silver.  Great purchase to match a ring.  Hooks are well made and not too delicate.
4.0,Fits me well.  I don't know how it will wash or clean.
4.0,"Fits as expected. The shiney material on the outside of the dress is very itchy and uncomfortable BUT it's a beautiful dress! It definitely doesn't make your boobs like like that unless you have implants :) for the price,  its still a good buy."
4.0,"Very cute item.  Fun for a Christmas gift for a teen or child.  Fine item for the price.  Soft, cute."
4.0,"Overall the outfit is really cute, but the sizing is too large. Our daughter is wearing 9m clothes right now, so I ordered this in size 6-9m. It's way to big for her right now and I should have bought a size smaller than I needed, but she will grow into it so it's ok. The pants are ok, but we really like the shirt. The quality is good enough. The hat is already to small for our little girl too, but she has a big head like her mom and dad :). We like it enough to keep it, it's cute!"
4.0,The pin is great but within a week both backings have fallen off and I'm not happy about that.
4.0,"I love this watch!! I would give it 5 stars, but the watch pendant has fallen off a couple times...really easy fix, but it did affect my rating."
4.0,I believe I needed a half size ring but I still like the ring
4.0,run a little big
4.0,"Very pretty dress! Great price. I normally wear a 12/14 (L), but bcz of the reviews, I ordered the XL. Fits perfectly! I took a star off bcz the lining underneath has two holes I’ll have to sew up before wearing."
4.0,The pendant is beautiful but I replaced the string/rope necklace part immediately. It looks so much better on a chain.
4.0,"I think for the price point, this is a decent sweater that fit well. It's a little bit of a boxier fit but fit true to size. The one I received was actually thicker and of better quality than I expected - more of a heavier weight knit than I thought I'd receive. The material is smoother than many more expensive cardigans I have in my closet. I think it's a decent, classic item that for the price, fits the bill!"
4.0,Love the skirt!!! It is a little snug at waist line though.
4.0,"Great with shorts or leggings. Was a little large, but still fit well."
4.0,"The dress fit tightly, order 2 sizes bigger for my daughter for her chest, and it was tight"
4.0,I was surprised to learn that there are so many hats/caps the more or less fit the description of this hat there are Newsboy caps and golf hats and Ivy League hats and Ascot hats (I knew what an ascot was--its that silly puff of material under the chin of pretentious fools in 195o's movies.This hat is good enough tho I wish it had a greater range of sizes (this was called &#34;Large&#34;). I wear a 7 1/4 but this might be comfy for a guy who wears 7 1/2 if he had a somewhat pointed head. but I am happy with the quality of material and workmanship as well as style I just inserted a little parachute type cordage behind the hat band and a few stitcheds to hold it in place which will suffice unless I have a high wind (then I might add a bit of elastic cordage).
4.0,"Super flattering, true to size. Only negative, the bottom hem came unraveled the first time I washed it. Would be an easy fix if you sew. I did not bother sending it back because I was able to wear it twice & I feel that was worth the price."
4.0,The pajamas are cute. The fabric is nice and soft<br />They look true to size.
4.0,"Stretches well enough, fits about same as any, pretty run of the mill stuff. I deduct 1 star for the scratchy feel. The look causes instant amorous intent as desired."
4.0,I'm usually a 7.5-8. I ordered the size 8. They were both too long and too wide. I love how they look so I sent them back and reorder them in a 7.5 I hope they fit!
4.0,"It's really tight and not adjustable. Long wear (2 hours) makes you want to yank it off. On the good side, it definitely works."
4.0,Baught this dress in a 16 and it fit nicely but it also told me what areas I needed to work on lol.the dress is very sexy and fitting great item to have I'm getting another in a different color
4.0,"I don't know what the business plan is, but these were really cheap even for Chinese products.  But they look really good.  Lots of ads enclosed so I guess it is loss leader.  They arrived well ahead of schedule - it still took a couple of weeks to get here from China."
4.0,Super cute!  But...this sweater is NOT as long as it appears in the pic. I’d buy again one they have the size back.
4.0,Nice Watch.... but the battery was dead when I received the watch.  I had to buy a new battery...🙄
4.0,I liked the color and the way it fit.
4.0,Love the look and feel of these guys. The woodgrain frames are very grippy and very light. The clear iridium lenses are great for low-light situations and clearly not for very sunny days. The tint is reflective enough that your eyes are still visible from the outside.
4.0,"Tried them on, size Large fits true to size. (I’m a 11-12). The only thing I didn’t like was that I expected the green to be green, it’s not, I got a dark grey instead. Otherwise, I would be 100% satisfied!"
4.0,It works but I wish they were a little bit longer than this cause we had to hold it with zip ties
4.0,"Well, I was so disappointed because this is such a soft, comfortable top, but it runs way small.  I am a medium and ordered a large because I'm tall, but I don't even know if an extra large would fit comfortable.  This is for a small, petite sized individual.  It is very, very cute, just with it did not run so small and short."
4.0,"True to ECWS size (ie they run large so that soldiers can wear gear and multiple layers under them).  This is just a shell.  No lining: No insulation.  It fits well over my US made, drab grey U.S. Military Surplus ECW Gen. III,  Primaloft Parka.  I'm 6', 240LB, 39&#34; waist,  45-46&#34; chest and I bought a large regular and it floats on me.  (As desired because I layer up under it as needed).<br /><br />Camogrom pattern is very similar to my true spec Multi cam but just a shade off.  Interior is a yellowish green hue.  Like all these nylon PTFE treated outer garments, they are not fleece quiet, but in the rain who cares?  (The true US Specimen is Gortex).  Seams are taped, has lost of pockets, zips opposite of typical US jackes (like most european jackets I've owned... some would say woman's zipper) zipper allows the bottom to be opened or the normal top down. has snapping snow gusset and bungee adjusters.  Tons of pockets.  Flap over zipper snaps as opposed to Velcro like on other Military Gore-tex gear I've worn.  Hood rolls into collar just like the other ECWS gear I've worn.  Velcro straps on wrists to adjust wrist fit.<br /><br />Very pleased with what arrived; Need some field use to give it five stars.  Will update when I get some use out of it, and can tell you how it fairs against wet weather (all I bought it for is to keep the wet off of my ECWS Primaloft parka and it fits well over top of it).<br /><br />Update:  Hunted in light rain.  Stayed dry, but it wasn't a full down pour test.  Hunted in winds.  It did its job to break the wind.  But remember this is just an outer shell, and if it is cold you will need layers under it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Hunted ducks off shore in North Carolina, last day of the season in a prolonged down pour.  Got soaked to the bone after the water made it through the armpit zippers and soaked my fleece I had on under this... also got me around the neck...  considering the huge prolonged (over an hour) constant downpour, and the cost of this jacket I'll leave it at 4 stars.  All my buddies didn't fair any better with their different types of outer shells.  But having the experience I made sure my dad got a 'real' US Goretex ECWS OCP shell.. and having compared it to his much costlier shell I wish I would have saved up and got the real US Goretex article.  I have one in blue (as I was in the USCG) that has been through bad weather and faired better than this one.  However  I still wear this whenever I hunt in the rain, and if it isn't pouring it's ok... but I don't doubt the US article is superior in regards to extreme exposure."
4.0,This is really bit on me you might want to go down a size.
4.0,"The quality was better than I thought and since I have small fingers, all the rings fit. However, this set wouldn't be ideal for larger finger types unless they're worn as knuckle rings and even still, they might be too tight."
4.0,Was a very good product I might just buy it again.
4.0,i like the hats color and materials but they where to small
4.0,Cute and not expensive
4.0,"I'm 5'5, ordered size large. The dress fit great! True to size. But it is very short. I added heels and man I was like I cannot bend over."
4.0,"I love this it is sooo pretty in the sun especially, I have bought it twice now, the last time the clasp broke after a few days, but hopefully I can just pick up a clasp at Michaels or something.  I will definitely order another one though, cause it's so pretty"
4.0,"Great light jacket for when its chilly out or if its rainy. The hood is detachable so if you dont need it you can store it in the inside pocket if you want. The fleece on the thin side but comfortable since this is not a winter jacket per se.<br />The stitching is great, no loose threads anywhere that I've seen. The zippers are smooth and dont snag on anything.<br />Ive had it out in heavy rain and its kept me dry, although eventually it would soak through and get wet.<br />For the price the value overall is great."
4.0,"I think this dress is cute for a younger age, not for me. The pleated stitching  is not comfortable, but okay to wear around the house. I did like the color and quality. Good price and fast service."
4.0,Can hardly wait until I am able to wear this dress out.  It fits perfectly.  The fabric is not of the highest quality but it suits the price.
4.0,"Nice and cuddly, just looks a bit weird on my feet :)"
4.0,"They seem to be decent quality. Good for the money. They make things clearer. They are good &#34;driving&#34; glasses, but only OK for &#34;sunglasses&#34;. I was going to give them a three, when I realized the description didn't say SUNglasses. They are good driving glasses, but need to be darker to be good sunglasses."
4.0,"they are a little bulky, but otherwise they work really well and stay on tight. I would reorder this item if needed."
4.0,Runs very large but actually still cute. I just wear high waisted and fold down a roll or two
4.0,"Los compré para mí hija y le bajan hasta el cuello, son para mujeres altas y con cuello largo."
4.0,I bought these for a gift and they are high quality and have the sticker for proper UV rating. Fits adult's heads both men and women. Comfortable and everybody likes heart glasses.
4.0,The dress looks just like the photo. Like it a lot.
4.0,Arms were long and the body snug
4.0,"Love the length and softness. The waist band gets wrapped and turned after the first launder. I will continue wearing these, though. The pockets are awesome."
4.0,"Nice hat.  Warm with the fleece lining, but fit my head a little big (although I'm pretty small)."
4.0,It's so beautiful. I've only worn it once because I don't want to ruin it. It fits snug which I didn't like. Maybe if I lose 10 LBS I'll feel more comfortable in it.
4.0,Good glasses. I wore my glasses under them along with a face mask.  They tended to fog up a little because the face mask created a gap where the Googles.  Seemed fine with no mask.  They have different colors lenses for the sun intensity.  I would have gotten something a little bit lighter than purple because with a cloudy day the visibility was cut back quite a bit.  So two pair with different lense would be optimum. Fit over my glasses well.  The strap fit well over my helmet. Well built and sporty.
4.0,Es bonito pero la tela de la falda es muy delgada para mi .pero bonito
4.0,"I liked it, but if you have a bigger chest then it doesn't fit properly. Plenty big, just not in the chest."
4.0,"Was jogging 3 miles a day and going to the gym.  The plastic circle would crack.  However,  I might have been harder on it than recommended.  Fits perfect, looks great and is very comfortable."
4.0,"These are lovely for my teenage granddaughter.  I'm sure she will enjoy them and at the price, I won't be disappointed if they get lost!!"
4.0,Nice pants but way too long! I had to return. I am 5’5” which is average height but I was walking on the pants. Pants were medium weight and appeared to be nice quality but pants were in excess of 35 inches long.
4.0,Good quality tote but wish it would be bigger. It's too tiny. Had to return it
4.0,"Two things I love about the no-drag backpack.  1.  The lack of exterior pockets.  You can't steal anything from the pockets because they are all against your back.  2. the sturdy construction.  I carry a heavy laptop and papers in this back daily and I've been using it for 2 years.  Its showing some wear but the handles are yet to fail me.  I also love the built-in helmet holder<br />Now my cons:<br />1. the pocket on the strap is useless.<br />2. The interior side pockets have started to rip at the top where the elastic meets the nylon.<br />3.  The waist strap has no where to go so if you aren't using it, it dangles uselessly.  Worse, I've had it snag and catch banisters as I head up and down stairs.  There's a pocket for the helmet holder.  A slight design change to the zipper and the waist strap could fit in there too."
4.0,polarized<br />the size is nice and I wish I could find them made with real materials not like 99% plastic
4.0,It is a romantic gift. My husband has the key and I have the heart. It was a little small but still cute
4.0,"I ordered and XL which is my normal size on top.  This is bit too big, but I think a gentle wash and dry will make it just right. I normally hang all my tops to dry to prevent shrinkage, but I give this a little heat."
4.0,"I like the softness of this shirt, but the M is big in the shoulders. Will wear anyway due to the topic. Design is stamped on rather than screened. Hope it lasts."
4.0,"I'm a size 9, ordered a 9 and my heel doesn't quite fit, it goes a little over. Comfort is fine"
4.0,"fit perfect,  arrived days before original ETA"
4.0,"Comfortable, fit well, nice price point."
4.0,Very nice - fabric is beautiful - a bit too small for my size (size 12)
4.0,"I ordered the black version of this sweater. The picture looks as if the speckled aspect of the fabric is maybe gray or some other muted colors mixed into the black fabric. When I opened it I was surprised to find to be black with confetti like colors as the speckled part of the fabric...orange, red, yellow, blue.<br />I wouldn’t have ordered it knowing it was this way, but I will keep it because the fabric is nice."
4.0,"It's a little longer in the legs than what I would have liked, but it's still nice and fits close to size. I used this as a bathing suit cover up, but material was kind of heavy for that. Still like it! Recommended!"
4.0,Good for the price. I normally wear a medium and this one was just a little to big but still wearable.
4.0,I love it! Perfect for my meditation.
4.0,Arrived bubble wrapped. The box and pouch are elegant. Looks fine but no labels if this is genuine leather.
4.0,"I like this uke leash for the soft fabric, nice bright colors, and the cord used to connect the hook to the strap.  The one aspect I don't like is the hard plastic hook, which I am worried will scratch the top of the uke near the sound hole.  I have tried it a bit on a Kala soprano laminate uke with no scratches yet, but I cannot bring myself to try it on my solid koa uke.  Fortunately, it can be used in another manner with the cords wrapped around the headstock and the loop placed around the right shoulder.  I actually prefer the support at the headstock, because that is where I need stability to move my left wrist around for various chord shapes.  Please consider some sort of soft surface for the hook and/or a slightly longer strap to allow it to pass behind my back to the right shoulder."
4.0,Fit perfectly! It is a bit then but other than that it’s awesome
4.0,Great fit and great to wear under uniforms.
4.0,Great shoes. Awesome price.
4.0,the flower wasn't on but super glue is my best friend
4.0,Good color and fits well
4.0,Really liked this product. The one thing I will say about the fabric is that it makes u swear so wear them on a cool day
4.0,Great driving glasses...should've bought 2.... one to leave in the car and
4.0,Showed up with a dent in it.  I was able to push it back into place but was a little off putting.
4.0,I love this necklace! I only wish it was adjustable so I could have it hang a bit higher.
4.0,"It was just a little bit too lose, I should read the materials and would have seen it wasn’t a stretchy material"
4.0,"These glasses are cute but fit just a tiny bit snug on the bridge of my nose. Other than that, they are lightweight and flattering.  Currently there is no listed price for me to compare value but they do a great job blocking the sun. I would probably expect to pay between $10 and $15 for these and would definitely recommend aside from the slight snugness."
4.0,"I absolutely love this watch. The LED backlight is awesome, it syncs up every morning with the atomic signal so I never have to worry that it's not set properly. The only downfall to this watch is the beep for the hourly chime/ alarm. It's almost inaudible. For the life of me I don't know why they offer a chime and alarm and then make it so quiet that you can't hear it unless the watch is hanging on your ear. If you can get past that the watch is absolutely amazing, but if you need a watch with an hourly chime or alarm you can actually hear then stay away."
4.0,"Product was fine, just didn't like the size of the pearls.  They were much larger than expected.  Paid better attention to the sizes listed and ordered a different necklace (Aobei Pearl Single Necklace) which were smaller and exactly what my daughter wanted."
4.0,I love this hoodie its perfect I do recommend ordering  a couple sizes up I read over comments  and some others said it ran small I got a 2x and usually wear a medium or larger and it fits perfect on me I would say they are and do run different sizes but like I said order a couple sizes up or a size up. Its also worm and can be worn in the summer with no issues I also love the color I got the charcoal and green its perfect will order again soon maybe even order one or two more in different colors.
4.0,Love this shoe! It was very flexible and fit my daughter well. Good price for quality of shoe. Would buy again.
4.0,"Fits, comfortable, I use it often."
4.0,"Loved the suit, just too large.  These run true to size and I upgraded and it was just too big."
4.0,Nice . Very nice!
4.0,"Nice, stretchy fabric, but the cut is very small!"
4.0,Great product for the buck.
4.0,Great as a dress or over leggings.  I'm enjoying it.
4.0,Plain but classy design
4.0,"My daughter only wanted boxers like her brother, but she wanted soft ones. These fit the bill. They're a bit smaller/shorter than boxer briefs, but that doesn't bother her too much."
4.0,"This shirt is great. The colors are vibrant and the fit was loose enough to be sexy and stylish, but not so big that you look sloppy. The only teeny-weeny &#34;con&#34; I have is that it's not as &#34;off-the-shoulder&#34; as I thought. It's not a turtleneck 😜 But a little more of a slant would be nice. DONT go up too high in a size to get that though, your shirt will look ill-fitted. Just up one size should do it. 👍🏾"
4.0,"They're super cute. The only problem I have with this product is that they feel cheap and have that cheap metal smell. But after wearing for a few minutes, I don't even notice the smell. I also had to use plyers to pinch the opening so it would fit snugly on my nose. But overall great product! They might feel cheap but they don't look cheap!"
4.0,"Material was thin, not quite see-through, thinner than I prefer."
4.0,"I’m 5’6, 36C, 28 waist, 35 hips, pant size 6, normal legging size small and sports bra size medium. I looked at their size chart and went with a medium. It definitely runs big, through the bust on the top and through the hips on the medium, but not to the point where I couldn’t wear it or it looked funny. If I was my pre-covid size 4 I would have fit better in a small I think. They were full length on my long legs, which is rare, and the material itself is awesome. It’s soft, stretchy and light with a bit of compression. It’s a tad on the thin side, but still squat proof. Very comfy to wear and my sweat didn’t really show through. I got the grey, but it’s not a legit grey. It looks very deep navy/denim blue/steel gray in the gym light. All that being said, I really like this set and will wear it again. The leggings have almost a denim feel and I think they’ll go really cute with cropped tshirts. If you’re on the smaller end of the size chart they provide I’d size down!"
4.0,It's a little long but I am short so it fits just fine
4.0,Gorgeous bathing suit made out of great fabric. The only issue was it ran a little small so I would go ahead and size up.
4.0,Pretty! Nice charm
4.0,"The quality of these shorts is much more than I expected. The length is perfect and the material is much nicer than I thought it would be. The only issue is that they run about a size or two too small. So don't hesitate to order, but size up."
4.0,"Son loves it, runs a bit small. He normally wears a large and this fits more like a medium."
4.0,I was totally satisfied with my purchase
4.0,Loved the coat was adorable but was not a womens size
4.0,Very comfortable after a few hours of wear to conform to your wrist shape. On the longer side since it's meant to be worn over a wet suit so bear that in mind. I wear it casually on an everyday basis and it looks and feels great!
4.0,"Look & fit as advertised. Let kids play thru this winter & ask again. For the price, even if after year......Still dry & warm - a success."
4.0,"For reference I’m 5’2 and on the thick side, my butt could use a little bit more coverage but nothing I can’t work with and the top part was very big so size accordingly I bought an XL"
4.0,pretty good except it was a little to big
4.0,Little do they know they're off Amazon. Cute comfortable and good price in case I lose them?
4.0,"It’s nice for the price. In hindsight, I should have got the black with white instead of the the black on black. It can be very hard to read in certain light.<br /><br />My dad only used the basic functions. He said the directions were a little hard to understand.<br />It does it’s job."
4.0,"The title and description says this is an adjustable hat. The picture is clearly not, but I figured it may have been inaccurate since the description said otherwise. It is big on my toddler, but he still wears it & will grow into it. It looks just like the photo, flex fit, no way to adjust the size."
4.0,Nice shirt but for a 2X it was small.
4.0,"Trust the size guide. It is accurate. I am 5'8, 158 pounds, long legs, 34c bra and curvy but not in that &#34;fat&#34; way. The large did not quite cut it as even though it fit, there is a piece of material that is loose and designed to cover you back skin under the lacing in the back. When the laces are too fat apart, the material will not quite cover your skin and looks bad. I liked the quality a LOT and for that price even more so. Truly. However, it does flatten your boobs somewhat and I want more of that pumped up look."
4.0,This dress is soo comfortable. I actually have three in different colors. The one I wear the most is starting to pill a little but it was very inexpensive so i'm not upset but that is why I only gave it four starts - otherwise it would be five!
4.0,These socks are a looser fit on my 7/8 foot than I like but the total sock was comfortable at the time my ankles were swollen and painful. These are looser than normal socks and were not tight anywhere. I hope I never need them again but I was certainly glad to have them during that time.
4.0,"These 12&#34; Balloons are really nice! They are assorted colors. They are great for teens or children. My son really likes them!<br /><br />They are easy to blow up and tie. I have blown them up myself or with a pump with no issues. They are high quality and hold up to hours of play. They would be great for a birthday party! You will receive 100 balloons in several different colors. I like the colors that are included in this set. The apple green is really pretty!<br /><br />I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but all opinions are 100% my own. I welcome both positive and negative feedback. I did not receive compensation or payment in any way."
4.0,These are totally awesome!!!  I think I found one of my new loves...The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because like most pajamas they kind of lose their shape after wearing for a while and look a bit sloppy to wear out in public....Not sure what I expected for PAJAMAjeans though haha.
4.0,I am in love with the dress but it runs a little big
4.0,Most of them I really liked. They hang nicely.
4.0,Color is just like the picture. It's a pretty big wallet. The slots for the cards are very tight. i kind of had to jam the cards in there. The material feels a little cheap but i won't complain for the price. I like it
4.0,"I ordered a size 11, but it arrived as a 11 ""wide"". The flip flops are good quality, but I wish there would have been an option on ""regular"" or ""wide"" rather than a being surprised by a wide."
4.0,I seen another reviewer get her dress altered under her knees and I thought that was a great idea 💡 and plus the dress was super long! But I loved it. It’s sparkly in person so the navy blue was not dull.
4.0,Very stylish but has a strange long lasting odor.
4.0,I usually buy only designer skirts but I needed this I'm a hurry and decided to give it a tr. Fit nicely and very sexy.
4.0,"..it runs WAY small,  be aware it's like at least an inch too narrow.<br /><br />But the return process was extremely costumer friendly so thats good if you do order too small"
4.0,"I was looking for a large, durable, multi-pocketed black textured bag for everyday (intensive) use to load up with text books, lunch, water bottle, makeup bag, etc.  This bag suits what I was looking for well.  The shoulder straps comfortably support the weight and the two front and one back exterior pockets hold keys, phone, and small accessories like my phone charger so they are easily accessible without getting lost.  The inside front has two pouches and the inside back has one zippered pocket which holds my pens, lip gloss, etc.  There is also a full width zippered pouch sewn on the inside back wall.  I prefer that to a pouch sewn in the middle of the bag dividing it into two compartments because this bag holds more and the contents of the pouch don't get as crushed. I have two complaints. The first is that the buckle holding the shoulder strap to the bag often irritates my arm (I also tend to hold the strap/buckle as I walk so it irritates my hand/knuckle), but it's not a big concern.  My second, greater complaint is that the zipper to the inside back pouch broke off after less that one week of use. I don't plan to return the bag because the zipper is not visible and the pouch still holds what I want it to but I am concerned about the longevity of this bag.  I'll try to remember to update this in a few months!"
4.0,For Gear S2 Classic. Fits perfectly. Easy to install and adjust. One thing is that the band is slightly darker than watch but not really noticeable
4.0,"My head is not fat but this hat makes it feel as it is- I have a size medium head, hat is snug."
4.0,"Let it hang looser. It's a bit smaller than I thought & I'm 120 lbs 5'8&#34;. I got a small, but medium was my next order. It fit but it was a bit too short. It's lovely. You will be noticed, but more importantly, you will feel like you're wearing nothing & the sleeve can hold your iPhone right if you're out for a walk & have no pockets. It's lovely & likely will look lovely on you. I received comments on it from women asking where I got it. But all said it was a bit small. Better order one size up & let it flow."
4.0,Material is that of a T-shirt. Falls to 2 inches above my knees. I would warn against a lite color as it would be see through.
4.0,"Product is decent for the money.<br />Size runs a bit small though. I am 5’ 10 195 lbs, based on the chart & reviews I went with a Large.<br />Too small, I will return & try an XL."
4.0,"I like these yoga pants, I ordered the size large because I normally ware a size 5/7 in jeans. The blue color looks great at the top around the waist. I am glad I ordered the large because they fit me perfect. The material is thin, silky, very comfortable and stretchy. I like the length also, I am 5'7 so I was worried they would be short on me but they are not. I am happy with my new yoga pants, the design around the waist makes it look like I have curves which is great.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I found this product at a reduced price for testing purposes."
4.0,"These are the most comfortable shoes my daughter has ever owned!  We have had them in 2 different sizes now and 3 different colors!  I love that they are easy to put on, are closed toed (for school), and are easy to clean. You can use them with fancy clothes or casual!  My only complaint is that the padding inside the shoe comes out easily!"
4.0,I liked the socks; however they were  not available when I tried to order more of them.
4.0,"I bought a 3x expecting it to be too small.  It actually has room.  Fits very nice.  It is not a drape-type of fit, like the picture depicts.  It is clingy, and I like that when I am layering tops.  If trying to hide body imperfections, this is not the top."
4.0,It's a shawl. Not much to it.
4.0,Very cute and felt great when putting on.  I found that I shrunk a little in length when I washed and dried them.
4.0,Fits well.. Nice and stretchy plus lightweight.. Great summer jeggings! The material is somewhat cheap but they've been holding up well after washings. I'm 5'8&#34; and 180 and the XL works great for me.  I like how they bunch up a bit at the ankles. Also true to color described.. I got them in charcoal. Highly recommend. I'll probably get them in a different color.
4.0,Definitely good quality and easy to put in for even my sensitive nose… just too bulky to wear often.
4.0,Well made and durable.  Well fitting. Have many pairs.
4.0,Great for summer but it's weight suggest a robe is needed with it in the cooler months. Colors are deep and rich. Unfortunately there is only one small pocket in it.
4.0,"This purse is smaller than we expected, but still really cute, and we are keeping it."
4.0,nice feel nice look
4.0,Very pretty for inexpensive costume summer jewelry.  Have already paired it with a top.
4.0,"it's cute,,,I ordered a size smaller than I wear,,by reading what the top is made of,,good thing I did cause it runs big,,,"
4.0,"I like the design, cute and trendy"
4.0,Cute and sexy. It is a little short in the back. Silk and soft.
4.0,"Needed cases for my readers; I like that these came in subtle finishes, not garish colors. A few of my readers are a snug fit, but overall these were a good deal."
4.0,"It fit perfect! The only problem was there was no padding. And after a few uses, it started to tear a bit. But overall, I am happy with what I bought."
4.0,"This is a great cardigan. Stretchy, good fabric. I am 5'1 and 120 pounds so it fits me a little long but nonetheless I love the cardigan as it looks like really good quality (it is not thin, sheer, or see through). I ordered it in the &#34;dusty pink&#34; color and the color is as shown in the picture, maybe just a tad darker but very close to what is shown."
4.0,"They're okay. Thought the lenses would be larger, but it's okay, I have a fat face. The metal piece that's supposed to lay on your nose, doesn't. It doesn't really serve a purpose. They fit well and don't fall off your face."
4.0,"These sunglasses are decent for the price point. They are really good at keeping the glare out of the eyes while driving. The work well on sunny days and the polarized lens is nice.<br /><br />The drawback for us is that these sunglasses don't look great on narrow faces which means they don't look great on myself or my husband. They come out too far on the sides. We were hoping they would curve around the sides a little more for a better look. For those who have a wider face, these may look better.<br /><br />As for comfort, the nosepiece is comfortable. I'm not a fan of the metal sides but my husband likes them and since he will be the one wearing them, that is all that matters. The earpieces are comfortable. We were hoping to use these for running but will most likely end up in the car as a pair of driving and wearing around town sunglasses.<br /><br />Overall, those looking for an inexpensive pair of sunglasses, these aren't bad."
4.0,"I bought these after a calf/Achilles injury to provide a little addition support.... I used the size chart provided after measuring my calf, and the sleeves fit my calf nicely. The only negative is that for me, the ankle opening is small considering such a large calf.....but since these are too long for my shin anyway, I just plan to trim off the ombre selection to alleviate that.  I definitely recommend these as an affordable sleeve option whether for athletes or for long flights or other sedentary issues."
4.0,The fabric used in this outfit is cheap but it is put together very well
4.0,I am 5'7 and about 147 lbs and ordered an XL after reading reviews.  I had a baby so I prefer loose fitting and size XL was perfect (I normally get size med-large).  Sleeves do run a bit short. It is long and more dress like than tunic. Very comfy. The material is slightly see through. I wore a cami underneath and it was perfect. With the bigger size I felt I was able to hide my post baby tummy well. I got a lot of comments on it!<br />The leggings I'm wearing in the picture also come from Amazon. It was easy to match with anything due to the color palate. You can probably pair this with whatever you already have at home.
4.0,"Big, looked and felt a little different than expected but. Still 9k"
4.0,"Comfortable, like the material. Much tighter than expected based on my review of other reviews though. I’m usually a M/L at 5’7” and 145lbs - I ordered a large. Should have ordered XL. I use it to layer under other shirts since it does not feel flattering and feels too small."
4.0,My daughter is ten years old. When I measured her she was a 9/10. After reading reviews I decided to order the next size up. Glad I did that. They fit her perfect I just ordered another one. I don’t know about the absorbency yet but will update when I know.
4.0,Use this for my golf simulator at home works great. Wish they made one slightly longer .
4.0,Me lo pueden cambiar por XL gracias
4.0,My son loved this for Halloween!!
4.0,Great boots for Halloween costume and was comfortable. I got a scuff mark before I even left the house but it came right off.
4.0,"Sooo cool! My niece absolutely loved it, she was so excited."
4.0,"Warm, neck warmer is great."
4.0,"These bracelets are so adorable. I love that it is Sterling Silver ! No need to worry about green wrists while in the water. I wore this in the shower and have washed my hands with it on and have had no issues!<br /><br />The fact that it’s a pull like bracelet is a nice plus because most times bracelets do not fit my wrist due to it being big.<br /><br />A nice bonus was the envelope and card that was enclosed!! I am so thankful for that because now I can ship it out to my BFF without having to go buy an envelope! They also included a nice sticker to seal the envelope.<br /><br />It also came with a cleaning cloth and a bag to keep it in.<br /><br />The one issue I did have, was the strings were a little hard to open and close. I’ve had these kind of bracelets before and never had that kind of issue so I’m hoping it’ll change over time."
4.0,Thin material and not as bright as shown would be my only complaint.
4.0,"Smaller than the small size in blue, but just by a little. I would have preferred it a little looser, but not worth sending back. Otherwise, I like the top."
4.0,"Fits great, but order one size bigger"
4.0,Decent belt. Good value for the money. I wish it came in a 1/1/2” variety though. It’s rather slim.
4.0,"Overall I really like it! The color is so cute and pink with the adorable purple flowers! It’s a bit looser than expected and not quite as fitted. And it’s thinner than expected. But honestly, it doesn’t bother me! I adore this dress!"
4.0,I misread the title/description and didn't realize it's a crop top. The picture makes it seem like a regular tank top. The quality is decent but I don't have the midsection to pull off this style of a top.
4.0,"Looks nice, but when you hold it you can tell it's not high quality.  Good for the price though."
4.0,These lanyards with international flags are great! I only wish that the flag on the detachable key chain was the USA flag instead of the Canadian flag as I live in the USA - but they'll do just fine.
4.0,Very slippery. Not very good for staying covered but my husband loves it. Will attach some fasteners.
4.0,I wish I would have ordered a smaller size. I got the same size as usual but these are big. Otherwise really comfortable
4.0,"I got it to go with my black jewelry collection, but its got gold and diamond in the face..it stands out so much, i have to pair something gold with it. It hit hard in the light but its black. I am happy with this watch for now. I've had since may and only a small portion of the black ion plated has scraped off Completely unnoticeable, because its shiny polished not a matt. Could of gotten 5 stars if the clasp wasn't so loose."
4.0,Shorts are big on me.  I would like to exchange them for a size 6 if possible.<br />Where can I return them?
4.0,"Nice bracelet, I bought for my God Daughter and I hope she likes it, it came in a black pouch that cinches up. The bracelet has some weight on it which I like and the actual pendant weighs nearly nothing and somewhat cheap feeling. Overall though it is cute and the clasp works well."
4.0,These are decent leggings. I bought the charcoal and brown leggings. I'm a size 18 and they're pretty snug - I can't imagine these fitting 3x-4x. The material is a lot shinier than shown; it does not look like matte cotton. They are comfortable and I'll get use out of them this winter. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,"I like the cardigan very much. Used for  occasional wear, day and night."
4.0,Nice and pretty inexpensive earrings.  They are sizable but weren't too heavy.  They kind of look cheap up close but they worked out great for a Gatsby party.
4.0,The quality is good . The color looks great on<br /> my kid as well . Good stretch makes it comfortable to wear . I feel its little lengthy for my daughter thats the only concern ..The water resistance is good so makes the swimsuit comfortable . Dries fast so kids can go for swim again and again after play time . A good product for the price
4.0,We got these socks as a Christmas present for our sister because she is a nurse and she is always on her feet. The design is super cute and she absolutely loves them.
4.0,"I think this is a nice item overall. Pretty color, good fabric, nice quality. Pockets are useful. My one complaint is that the velcro will stick to any part of the towel so I'm constantly having to fumble with pulling the velcro off of the wrong areas. Other than that, a good quality product."
4.0,The costume was better quality than expended and had a great fit that was true to size. However the lightsaber was very very cheap! I expected it to be cheap since it is only a prop but it was even more so. I loved the costume very much though so the lightsaber would not stop me from purchasing if I ever needed to again.
4.0,"In the picture it is very close to the girl's leg, however it is very baggy. Still great lacey texture. Also was on the short side, only went to the middle of my calves"
4.0,"I absolutely love it! the package came right in time, and it looks super cute!<br />But I'm only giving 4 stars because..for some reason, it came with some really weird orange stains and scrawls in the shirt :/ I wonder if thats really going to get out when I wash it."
4.0,Very warm just a little small for me because I have a lot of hair should have gotten a different style but works great
4.0,tight around the arms
4.0,I love the pants. But I wear a 5 so I ordered a 5. Make sure you order a size smaller then you wear. Super cute pants!!!
4.0,"Cute and the chain is decent,  just not very long."
4.0,"These are good little watches and I have been using them since they came out 20-30 years ago. I am not sure if the model number has changed but the simple basic Casio digital watch has always been long lasting and dependable. They are not expensive but have served me well. If it gets broken while working or playing I don't worry and I never have to be concerned that someone will rob me for my watch while traveling to other countries.<br /><br />But from a display standpoint it could be better. Although the display is common with all of these style watches, the illumination button is useless. It does not produce enough light or at the correct angle to read the numbers. I since have started using the Casio F-105 Illuminator, same basic watch but with an outstanding back light feature.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a good basic watch with typical features such as 24hr time, alarm, stop watch and large clear digital numbers then this is a good choice. But, if you want to see what time it is at night or in poor lighting then get the F-105."
4.0,"We have only had the umbrella up for two weeks, but so far we are satisfied.  It is very nice looking and relatively easy to assemble.  Our only concern is that it doesn’t seem very stable, even after bolting it to the deck AND securing it with concrete patio pavers. (A weighted base is not included.) Even the slightest breeze makes the umbrella bounce around erratically and causes the frame to creak loudly. (The pole & arms rock/flex/twist in the breeze, which causes the noise.) It’s hard to relax when the umbrella sounds like it is going to come crashing down on your head.<br /><br />Also, while the foot pedal is very easy to engage for rotating the umbrella, actually turning the umbrella can be somewhat difficult. Because the crank handle is plastic we don’t want to risk breaking it by using it for leverage when rotating the base. So we turn it using just the post with the lower arm as leverage, which makes it more challenging. Maybe we’re being overly cautious, but we want the umbrella to last.<br /><br />While the umbrella isn’t the highest quality, we suppose it’s decently made for the price point. As long as it lasts a few years, we will be happy."
4.0,"I'm sure it's not their fault but the factories & chemicals used to make this.,  it has a terrible strong chemical - gas smell to it! :("
4.0,Worth it I use them under HLG 600 v Spec r - ROI 680 - ROI E420 Full Blast in Flower My Eye's Do not see Star's No More Cheep is 20 These Wil work in the Garden in full sun as well I'd rather just keep them indoors though do not want to scratch them I Can See Clearly every detail on my plants without eye strain perfect spectrum light bought the FX a year or two they were okay but not half as good I don't think you can beat the price for what you get
4.0,"I wasn't quite sure how this ring worked but bought it anyway.  I looked at the picture of the girl wearing it and turned the buckle in the same direction.  Then guessed at what size it had to be to fit on my finger.  The only issue I had was that I wasn't sure if the ""belt"" snapped in.  It does not.  You lay the belt in the buckle and snap the buckle in place.  It takes a little pressure but once in place, stays there.  I like it."
4.0,"Like this dress,but will need to cut alter the length to my 5&#34;2 height"
4.0,Very nice tote bag for the price.  I thought the top zipped the entire bag but it only encloses the middle section.  Good value.
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter to wear to a party... she liked their look, and feel (apparently the rings on the bracelets are silicone/rubber, not plastic or stone)<br /><br />Her issue is that of the 10 or so she was wearing at the party, 4 of them had broken by the end of the night, without any real explanation as to why.<br /><br />Still, she had me repair 3 of the 4, so she likes them.. and being that this girl has every type of costume jewelry under the sun, the fact that she's insisting on continuing to wear these, says she's a big fan of them.. or at least their style."
4.0,The items were just as shown nice but a bit small
4.0,Price was reasonable
4.0,"Numbers indicate 21mm bridge and 44mm lenses; 21mm seems to be inclusive of the lenses’ frames because the space for nose’s width is more like 15mm. I have a small face for an adult, but the arms are too short (they do not reach behind my ears when I try setting the lenses up on top of my head), and the bridge is too narrow for me. I was pleased that the lenses appear black rather than red looking through their backs; the red is attractive but I was unsure about how red lenses would distort colors. If they weren’t so lightweight and small they’d be closer to five stars for me."
4.0,Its really cute... the leather is a little stiff so it sticks out on the sides.  I have small wrists and this is adjustable so it fits well.
4.0,I have a smaller wrist so ended up taking out several links the tool the provide was nice just bent which made it a little tricky to remove the rest of links needed.
4.0,"Beautiful earrings....they match bracelets, necklace and ring that I also have.  Wear it often."
4.0,Easy setup!
4.0,"nice, fit for me being a larger woman and the length is great"
4.0,I bought these for both of my kids and the seam on one of my daughter’s masks started to separate and come out the first time she wore it so I’m going to have to sew that myself I guess but the kids do seem to like them and they fit well
4.0,The collar is a little stupid.
4.0,Perfect fit. Thin material that wrinkles when washed & dried. Lovely pattern. So light and airy!!
4.0,These are exactly as you see in the picture and are very comfortable. The memory foam makes them really nice for walking around the house (although I can already tell that it will be the sort that quickly stops being so spongy - but you almost can avoid that I find with shoes). These were a size 7 which is what I normally wear and the fit was great. The back is a little lower than I would like although once the foam settles it will probably stay on better.
4.0,🤌🏻
4.0,"This fits great, very flattering, and supported my chest very well. The material isn't all that great but for the price it is totally worth it. I would buy again in a heart beat."
4.0,Nice look and fit.
4.0,I wear a size 6 in jeans and bought these hoping they'd fit. It's a bit tight but I can get them on. There is not much give in the butt area. I am very gentle putting these on based on other reviews of them ripping. So far I have only tried them on and have not worn them out and about yet. They are cute and will look good with my planned outfit.
4.0,Fits snug after 1 washing (and i hung to dry) still shunk.. it is also very short you would have to wear a skirt with it if you're over 5'7... still I found it comfortable and I liked it
4.0,"I have plantar fasciitis and have been trying and using various compression socks and sleeves and arch inserts to help reduce the pain and prevent a recurrence once the pain is gone.<br /><br />These socks are not only stylish, but they feel great on and actually have compression in the arch area. There is also good compression in the calf area. <br /><br />I ordered the large/extra-large because I take a 9 to 9.5 shoe. However, I find that these are a bit long (and looser than their small/medium) as I have to roll the top over to prevent it from coming above my knee. They fit me perfectly, otherwise. However, since they are on the large side, I'm passing them off to my boyfriend. I have several pairs of these socks and have worn their socks all day. It feels great wearing them. I also love the styles they come in.<br /><br />These are not only ""fun"" but they are medically helpful for my plantar fasciitis. I wash socks like these in a lingerie bag and lay them flat to dry. Currently, there is no price listed on Amazon for these socks but I would expect them to be priced in the $12.99 to $16.99 range. The only reason I lowered my rating one star is because they are larger than the size specified; otherwise, these are 5-star socks in my opinion.   "
4.0,These leggings are very soft and comfortable.  Good to wear around the house.
4.0,"This hoodie dress was a bit tighter than anticipated, but then again, it does say ""Slim Fit"". However, it is wonderfully tacky and, actually, very warm. The pattern is bright and cheerful. I am looking forward to wearing it for the next ugly Christmas Sweater party."
4.0,Size disappointing. Not as comfortable and plush as I had hoped.
4.0,"Socks can be hit or miss for me, especially since I have big feet. These socks are a little longer than I expected for them to be, even for crew socks, but they feel great. They're loose enough for my ankles and feet to still be able to breath but they fit well enough that they're not flopping off my feet. My only complaint is that the cotton or fibers from the socks tend to stick to the bottom of my feet. They're still good for me despite that."
4.0,"I really like this tanking. Its cute and hides the tummy. I like that the bottom is maximum coverage but still sexy. I'm 5'5' 195 LBs and the XXL. The only reason I gave Lee's than 5 is because the bottom has faded a lot after wearing about 5 times. Some pools and hot tubs have a lot of chlorine, which is good but fades some fabric colors. The bottom was a pretty bright orange but is now yellow.<br />Otherwise nice. I ordered 2 more in different patterns because I like to change my suites when wearing daily on vacation. The others have black and navy bottoms so hopefully they hold up to the pools/hot tubs."
4.0,It's a good quality cute tee. Runs big. I got a large and should have got a medium.
4.0,It was a little large for my girl but we definitely love it.
4.0,"This band arrived very quickly and it seemed really nice. It had tools to install it and it came with extra bars. It was in a nice little box too. I was really impressed. Unfortunately, the band was not even close to long enough so I was unable to use it. If you are sure this is the right size, I would recommend trying it, but be aware that it's not really long."
4.0,I got the blue version with the sunflowers and I love it!  It is true to size.  I can’t wait to wear it when the weather warms up again.
4.0,"Right out the bag, the glitter was everywhere but I expected that. It fit my 6 ft frame, 167 lb body below the waist but I couldn't get the zipper up past my rib cage.  It had absolutely no stretch.  My event was in a week and it took several weeks to be delivered so there wasn't enough time to re-order a larger size so I returned it.  It was a gorgeous dress, just open it outside and shake it before trying on.  I would order it again. Definitely order a size up."
4.0,Super cute! The only thing is that the rhinestones fell off a week after I bought them
4.0,They are cool. My beef is with the style..I wanted more burning man but they are more Elvis. Not the glasses' fault. Quality is okay but they are cheap shades so no big.
4.0,"Awesome suit, but I'm short 5'1&#34;, and the torso was WAY to long :( the stripes in the v direction  are super flattering and help to disguise imperfections. I'm an avid sewer, and if I had time before our trip I would have shortened it. It was really that cute."
4.0,This dress is nice but whoever made this dress messed up on the stitching so it fits kinda awkward. Easy fix I might add and other than that it's a nice dress for summertime
4.0,I love the bottom! The top has an odd fit that does not suit my fancy. I will be wearing the bottom with a different top.
4.0,I liked the fact of being able to wear the same mask and just having to clean it off easily. I don’t recall a size option and this one is a little to open around the face. I’d love to exchange for a smaller size if available because I love the idea of not having to continually purchase masks and throw away.
4.0,"absolutely beautiful material and sewing on this robe! I bought the black one and LOVE it! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because their size XL is really closer to a tight L. Buy up a size and No, ladies they don't make it in plus sizes. Such a shame because I like my robe a size bigger to fit over my whatever underneath!  Maybe, they will see this, and make some larger ones.  Otherwise, it's a great robe at a great deal!!"
4.0,They were fine for everyday ise
4.0,My only complaint is that the grey one is a significantly darker gray color than the picture suggests.
4.0,Beautiful top but runs small.
4.0,"spend many hours a week in a chlorinated pool.  Having lost an emerald out of  wedding band setting, I learned the devastation of chlorine on many metals.  Purchased this to wear in the pool.  Know I could do all swimming and pool activities with a naked finger, but wanted a band to fill the void.  This arrived perfectly packaged.  I wear it in lieu of my wedding band.  A wonderful value..  Most sororities have crests.  My college sorority had a rose, so added significance.  Bottom line, a beautifully designed band."
4.0,"This looks good on my round glass table. It's definitely better than any old table cloth, I'm not sure on the dimensions of my table but it's definitely on the larger side, maybe about a 50 inch diameter, and this fit very well and snug.<br /><br />It's comfortable and the color is very good. I ironed out the wrinkles and it looked great.<br /><br />My only wish is that it was a little thicker so it would soften the edges a little more, but overall I'm very happy with this for game night."
4.0,"Wonderful dress, fits as expected. The material cheap don't expect  last long ordered medium 5'5&#34; 144 lbs"
4.0,Soft and not too big
4.0,nice shorts but little small
4.0,"Absolutely love these bought three pairs for myself,daughter and sister. They are comfortable and easy to wear. I don't wear a lot of jewelry due to having sensitive skin.  But no issues at all.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the amount of time it took to get them"
4.0,It is a little tight but it is a nice classy look.
4.0,"I wish they were bigger; the material is comfy, and the design keeps mask away from my mouth and nose."
4.0,"I love the pattern of the shirt and wish it had fit better. But it was a little too big, and when this style doesn't fit me well, it has the unfortunate and unwelcome effect of making me look like I've just gained 15 lbs around the middle. I hated to have to send it back, but there was no chance I'd wear it. What makes it even more disappointing is that a smaller size wouldn't have fit my chest. Still, I'm giving it four stars because it was very pretty, well packaged, and arrived quickly. It's just not my style."
4.0,"PROS:<br />Cool design made of nice soft material, lightweight, easy to breathe through, meets the COVID protection requirement.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Not the best protection for extended, close quarters breathing (e.g., airplanes, small office spaces, etc.). Started to tear at the seam after about two months of extended use, due to stretchy stitching. Can be repaired but the cost to do so might not be worth it. This is the only reason I deducted a star. Otherwise, this is a 5-star product.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Overall satisfied with this stylish, lightweight, easy to breathe through COVID-required mask. Just be aware it may not provide the highest level of COVID protection from others."
4.0,"Love the look, comfortable and they fit perfect.  The reason for the 4 stars is the bottom is a bit slippery, luckily they are flats and I am decently coordinated mmmkay."
4.0,"Fits well , comfortable , soft"
4.0,"This is a long line sports bra for sure. Very cute but I am long waited and it comes almost to my belly button so the band is wide around my stomach. Other than that, so cute and comfy."
4.0,Looks great but is a little rigid and tight for the phone pocket.
4.0,"This is actually great quality. It is a lot more stretchy than I thought it was going to be which is alright. It fits well. I am 5' 2.5&#34;, 115 lbs and I can wear flats with it or a small heal. I enjoy the pockets and it did not wrinkle which is nice. I do recommend this product"
4.0,I love the style. The idea and concept is awesome and it looks great on. Just wished they paid a little bit more attention to the sewing details. That's why I gave it a 4 if the sewing was better it was have been a 5
4.0,Very comfortable. Wish there was a bit more compression. Stylish!
4.0,It exactly what I expected but it’s very small. I ordered an xxl and it fits more like an L.
4.0,I love this hat but it’s SO small. My 4 year old<br />Is tiny and it barely fits on her head.
4.0,"Very thin material so it breaths well, just be sure to pair a cute sports bra under"
4.0,The items come late and I’m 210lbs 5”5 I ordered an xl  it’s a little too tight and too long but good material
4.0,This was pretty much what I expected. Definitely as described. Bands are soft t and easy to put on. Does not come with instructions so if you've never changed the bands you may need to watch a quick YouTube video. Makes it much more comfy to sleep with the watch on to monitor sleep.<br />Actually came early so that was a plus!
4.0,Loved it but ran large and it didn't come in extra small
4.0,Took it to a jewelry store to have links removed. Worth the $8 they charged.
4.0,Tinier than I expected. Pretty flimsy. But very cute! Would be perfect for a little girl.
4.0,Doesn't stay stuck 100% but still pleased.
4.0,Ocasional use .decent quality
4.0,"I like them. They don’t hug my ear lobe quite as much as I’d like and thus sag a bit, but that’s just my earlobe. Super cute. Exactly as pictured"
4.0,"The metal is sturdy, although one edge came bent due to fitting in the box and shipping. The arm straps and addition off leather back straps are nice. Good for decorating, dress up or kids play. It’s sturdy as a frying pan medal, if that helps."
4.0,"Bought this for my husband for the Super Bowl and he LOVED it and so did the rest of the Super Bowl party. Only downfall is the material is VERY thin. When looking at it on the picture, we assumed it’s the same material as a typical hoodie but it’s not. Still nice, just need to layer it for warmth. It’s also true to size- 2XL"
4.0,"As expected, grandsons loved them. Found some others for better price however. Oh well, at least they are being worn."
4.0,I got these ties for my husband for church and they do the job!
4.0,"This is a Christmas present. The recipient has worn them yet so I don't know how they'll fit or feel, but from appearances it they seem to be really cushy and well made. The merchandise arrived timely."
4.0,"When you put it on, it feels like a feather. Sherry but has later underneath it. I also received several complaments."
4.0,I ordered an adult 3x it's more like a large or extra large. Love the hat. It's made out of a heavier material.
4.0,"It’s okay,I have not used it yet"
4.0,"I have not worn this swimsuit yet, I’ve only tried it on. However it is quite comfortable and very flattering. My only wish is that I could get one size top and a different size bottom. This suit is going with me to Disney and depending on performance the review may be edited."
4.0,Very nice casusal shirt. Wore with slacks to a concert.
4.0,Very cute - but disappointed with he size. They fit very small.
4.0,"Product was good until it was dropped, setting came off and this was after the return date. So I have a shell that I Cando nothing with. Can you help."
4.0,Very nice dress for the price
4.0,I would say this fits up to a large or a slimmer xl. The under layer of the skirt was too tight on my daughter who wears an xl. She has thicker thighs and a bigger behind than most her size though. Gave it to a friend and she loves it!
4.0,"I bought larger size so they would fit him loosely, but they are tight & he is only 30 lbs."
4.0,"I'm actually surprised this bag is as nice as what it is. Not quite 5 star worthy. When you snap in the removable pouch, there is no room for anything else except maybe a notepad underneath. I just kept one snap unsnapped to allow my wallet to sit along side the pouch. The straps a bit weird to figure out, and I don't like the metal hanging loose like the pictures. I ran the straps through the eyelets and the metal tabs, and it seems to be working fine. The short strap that comes along with it is way too short, unless you're good with digging in your armpit to remove anything from your purse. Yes, it holds it that tight in your armpit, so you've been warned. I can't say for sure whether it's real or faux leather on the exterior. It's a reasonable price, so I don't think it matters. You can get generic Walmart purses for more and they don't look as nice. Hopefully it holds up, but if it doesn't, it does have a one year warranty, which makes me think it will. You don't offer warranties on junk that falls apart. Overall, I like this purse."
4.0,Length and material was good. Colors were nice.  I liked it
4.0,It fits as expected.  I should have read the product details.  I didn't catch that it was 95% polyester and 5% spandex.  It still worked as a part of my wardrobe.
4.0,Of the bazillion sports bras I have bought.. this one is probably the best for stopping my &#34;spillover&#34; problem.  I have other bras that I have to do the &#34;tug/adjust&#34; every time I do a burpee... this one tends to be much better.  The only thing that is a little difficult with this bra is the double hook back closure... there are two straps to hook and you have to be sort of flexible to do that.  I can get it done but could see how someone might have an issue.<br /><br />I like the color.. has kept it's shape through several washings.. Oh.. and you have minimal bounce.. would definitely buy one again.
4.0,I ordered 2 sizes up and it fit good
4.0,good for wearing flip flops after you have softened your feet.
4.0,good  looks nise
4.0,"I was a little worried that it wouldn't fit but it does I really don't care for the top part much, I'm a little nervous something is gonna fall out. But for the price I'm not complaining too much"
4.0,These fit my 14 month old and look really cute.  They do get scraped up pretty quickly though.
4.0,good look on my non pierced ear. Fools folks all the time.
4.0,I have small feet but big calves so the feet part are extra long ignored to fit my calves and they scrunch under my feet and at my toes.
4.0,"3yo wanted a watch like mine and Broncos (school) colors. Inexpensive toy from my perspective, and he gets to be like dad."
4.0,"This seems to work just fine in that it's water-resistant and keeps accurate time.  However, I've only worn it about five times, and one of the 4 little plastic nubs that hold the clasp together already broke off.  Also, unless I'm doing something wrong (which is possible), you have to press the button for the display to light up.  If you're running through an airport and your hands are full, this is really inconvenient.  Otherwise, for the price, it's practically disposable."
4.0,I wore this everytime Cincinnati had a game I love it. The only negatively thing i could say is I wish it said the Reds on it
4.0,"Its very pretty but mine has unfinished areas where it looks like the metal was never buffed when it came out of the mold. I have attached pictures since it is hard to explain in words. Also, I never received any extra gift.<br />All of the negatives aside, it is very pretty and I may end up buying another one. My granddaughter loves it."
4.0,"I sewed it on another mask. There is no protection at all, but it's beautiful.  The material is rough on my face scratchy even. It is mesh just as advertised.  I love the glitter.  They are beautiful.  You must protect you. Don't depend on anyone else to protect you."
4.0,I just ordered to big!
4.0,"Bought this wallet to replace my old black leather billfold.  I wanted a wallet with an ID window, but could also accept both cash and cards in decent numbers while remaining as thin as possible (the wallet Holy Grail).  I carry my wallet in my front hip pocket, so the slightly larger size of this wallet wasn't that big an issue (a positive, even, as it makes it a little harder for the wallet to come out unless I intend to remove it).  It is about half an inch taller than my old wallet, but that extra room is required to hold the metal zipper, which I love.  The leather looks very nice, and feels thick:  not smooth out of the box, but has a texture to it that adds friction.  That will smooth out with use.  The stitching is nothing special, small thread with small stitches.  Mine does have some glue on the fabric surrounding the zipper, but I am assuming that was for initial placement before the zipper was stitched in.  It does appear that the zipper is stitched, as there are little pull marks when the wallet is stretched.<br /><br />The downside of the wallet is the removable inner pocket, which has the ID holder.  With cards on either side of the wallet and the ID holder in place, the holder sticks out too far to allow for the zipper to pass.  It takes a solid minute of holding the zipper at exactly the right angle and dragging the bottom of the zipper over the edge of the holder to zip the wallet.  I imagine that after enough time to allow the leather to soften, it will stretch enough to allow for easy use.  I didn't get that far.  I dumped the ID holder, put everything in the main wallet, and now it's sleek and zip-able.  It's a shame, really, as the ID holder was what I wanted in the wallet, but it is easy enough to live without."
4.0,"I loved it but tying a bow is a bit challenging. Next time, I will buy something already tied, easy to put it and remove it back."
4.0,"The size of the jacket was good and fit properly.  Even though I am a rather small old lady, ordered a medium in case there was a sweater needed underneath.  It came in a sturdy, zippered canvas bag.  Only thing was, it was terribly wrinkled.  Thinking the wrinkles would evenually straighten out hanging in the closet.  Still, good warm winter coat."
4.0,"My new black  velvet loose fitted crop .. came in the mail last week . I love it . It’s the perfect amount of right while loose . And it’s adjustable . Yea , it does ride up sometimes . But I like the different looks I can make with it . I ordered a small . And I use mine to wear over my tank tops /cover up my tattoos sometimes when I go out . It’s also very comfortable to go braless in and paint 🖤🎨✨"
4.0,"This item was boxed excellently in a nice glasses case with cleaning cloth, inside a cardboard box. Very impressive. The glasses help with my night driving. Lightweight and easy to put on."
4.0,"I don't give them 5 stars because I don't love them, however I literally have nothing to complain about these. Decent quality, confortable, good looking. I am tall with big thighs and they fit me perfectly, the stretch is great."
4.0,"this gets 4 stars instead of 5 just because the band breaks after like a year and can't be replaced. however, this watch is so cheap i don't really mind spending $10-15/year to replace it. i still have the broken ones (the oldest one being like 6yrs old) and they still work. if they would make the band more durable, i would be willing to invest more money for a longer lasting band. i'm also pretty hard on everything i own so that might contribute to the band always snapping on me. anyway, i've been wearing this watch 24/7 except for showers for about 6yrs. i'm really sensitive to texture/sensation and i like that i can't really feel this watch on my arm. it's comfortable and stays in place. i also like that it has an option for 24hr time. bottom line: it does everything i would want it to do, it's comfortable, and this is probably the only watch i'll ever wear."
4.0,"Good size, easy to open and close, and even easy to get into it's little storage pouch.  When closed it barely takes up any space, ridiculously small.<br />However it isn't wind proof and a good wind push it inside out!  So far it comes back but I don't know how many times are too many!"
4.0,"The bottoms are on the skimpy side, but the top is SOOOO hot. I get a lot of compliments in this suit."
4.0,Does not look like leather . That’s the only reason I did not give it 5 stars
4.0,"These are gorgeous, but I am a 150 pound, 5'6&#34; woman and I had to get them in XL. They are tiny."
4.0,"Well made but a little too tight for my comfort. Critical care nurse, I prefer the Vitalsox VT1211's personally."
4.0,A little loose. But sturdy
4.0,What I didn't like was going to order another and Amazon hiked the price $5.
4.0,This is a very comfortable and warm winter jacket. Easy to put on and take off. It’s not too puffy on my 3 year old boy and don’t have the need to take it out in a car seat. Very reasonable price and the quality is good as well. My son loves this jacket.
4.0,It was pretty and simple.
4.0,The only reason for my 4 stars is because of price but otherwise a nice long sleeve T
4.0,"The product was made very cheaply. The rhinestones that weren't purple were painted and the paint was flaking off. The stones were attached to the settings by hot glue. I only know that because some of the hot glue had dried into sharp points on back which poked me when I put it on.<br /><br />After writing this review the company reached out to me directly and offered a full refund without having to return the item. They promised to get with their manufacturer to make sure issues like this never happen again. Even though I was really disappointed with the product itself, the company is very professional and highly concerned with their customer's satisfaction. I would buy from them again as long as they improve the quality of their products as they promised."
4.0,They are really cute and with a retro classic look!
4.0,"The shirt is just as pictured and seems to be well made. I was expecting the fabric to be I bit heavier like other similar shirts have been, but it is the weight of a normal T shirt. It does not feel cheap or thin, I just thought it would be weightier. I have not washed it yet, so I can't comment on that aspect."
4.0,"I love the overall short but the zipper is annoying. It’s heavier than the shirt and it’s scratchy. I took a lighter to it to fix the scratchy part of the zipper. Otherwise, the fit is great and I like it a lot."
4.0,"Beautiful, quality product at an excellent price."
4.0,Comfortable one
4.0,"Love the shirt just wish we could have paid the same price it was originally at walmart before they sold out. Worth it though, so cute"
4.0,Queda bien y es buen material de ropa
4.0,I would of gave it five stars but find the buckle is magnetic closure but come open easily.
4.0,Better than expected. Very elegant yet Casual.  The only reason I did not give it five stars was the difficulty it to get on and off the Fitbit.
4.0,"These leggings are comfortable and thicker than other leggings I've tried. Not see through. I purchased 2 blacks and a burgundy. I like the thicker waistband. I've ordered a Medium and a Large. I'm 5'6"", 155lbs, size 8 or 10, and the medium was a bit snug on my mommy muffin top and back @as.  Haha I used small scissors and slipped them through the material and cut the waistband partially through on each hip and they're totally fine. The large fits perfect. My one BIG complaint about these leggings is that they pill..pile...HORRIBLY!  I have to say that the one pair of 3 that I've actually worked I have ONLY worn around the house and slept in so maybe the pilling won't be bad for normal wear with an outfit? However, other reviews also say pilling is bad."
4.0,Perfect with baskets and I like it.  It's so cute bee!
4.0,Love this top. I get compliments every time I wear it. Really soft fabric and completely comfortable. I would buy this one again.
4.0,They were a little large
4.0,"Edit 11/09/20 - I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement right away.  So far, the rest are holding up.  My daughter wears a different one to school everyday to hold her mask.  They are a good size for my elementary age child.<br /><br />Original review- These would be great if they wouldn’t break immediately."
4.0,A little bit smaller than expected
4.0,"Loved the boots, looked exactly like the pictures. Only problem was I couldn't get my foot in the shoe! I wear a size 8.5 in every shoe and boot and the opening for the shoe would not allow my foot in. Maybe if I had gone with a 9 it would have worked. Its just hard to get them on without a zipper like most boots. They are so cute though! bummed they didn't work out for me."
4.0,I haven't worn it but did try it on. It fits good but I probably could have gone a size smaller then again it does say oversized.
4.0,"Very nice costume for the price I paid, arrive on time. The material is thin but covers you well, is long but not that long as the picture, (for me I am 5’7” 200 lbs ordered a 3XL) the longer part of the dress, the back part arrive 7 inches above my ankle; the other thing is that the sleeves are not assembled correctly, the red piece of the sleeve is longer that the black one and ruin the looks. Above all, works for me like that, I will make some adjustments."
4.0,"This is a good band. Took away one star for the amount of time and pain in the butt to size it. They need to come up with a better system in my opinion. But once sized, it wears well, holds up to daily abuses. The color on the clasp is wearing off a bit I noticed but you can't really see it. Beware, once it is sized, that's it. If your hands/wrists swell in the heat, it will be tight and there is nothing you can do unless you have sized it to where you can move band to another pin hole, which I failed to do. All in all, it is a good band."
4.0,"This is a nice looking polo, the style is great. The fabric is not as soft as other polo shirts but still good"
4.0,Super cute and great quality and value however be aware they run small.
4.0,Seems pretty nice. Just got it and adjusted the links. Only complaint is it has some paint and scuffs on it so I hope it holds up for a ling time but looks sooo nice! And it matches my rose gold watch! It comes with the link remover too which was nice
4.0,"Cute earring , GREAT customer service. They did send me the wrong earring but they weren’t so quick to get me a new one plus a free one for all the trouble. Would def recommend a 8 mm or a 6, I believe the 8 is the typical piercing size they use for the rook."
4.0,Good quality. Color fades after some Time but i use it for bed time now
4.0,"The medium fit well and snug as stated in the sizing.  Quality seemed good for the cost.  I am waiting to see how the jersey lasts after a few more washes, and if it holds up well I will move from 4 to 5 stars.  But I recommend this jersey to others."
4.0,A gift to a young lady who loved it!
4.0,"When I looked at this I thought it was what I was looking for!! After I got it, transferring everything over from my backpack, I realized there isn't quick releases on the shoulder straps? So, they drag the ground and get nasty dirty!! Cleaning after each use is impossible, have to wait to get home for a cleaning or get to the hotel and hope the bath soap will clean the should straps and they are dry by morning so I can reload the bag.<br />Also, the center compartment, or the large compartment forward of the handle, is about 1 to 2 inches too small. You see, I'm a big guy and by the time I get a change of clothes, medications, and toiletries in there isn't room for a pair of shoes. Other than those 2 things I wouldn't change anything else."
4.0,"Great compact umbrella, but i find it very hard to close.  I actually struggle with it."
4.0,Decent quality for the price. I receive SO many compliments every time I wear it! Great buy!
4.0,measured wrist correctly - band is too big; too much hassle to send back - gave it to someone else
4.0,The color is gorgeous and the rose color accents are great. I have very tiny wrists and when tightened enough it has a lot of extra band that adds to the tightness. Not the seller or products fault. I will simply wear this when not working out so it will fit more comfortably.
4.0,"I am reviewing “Maco Johnston Slippers for Women, Soft & Washable Cotton Slippers w/Deerskin Suede Insoles”. These slippers do not match the description. The insole is fabric, kind of like a micro-terry cloth. The inside lining looks like a tricot knit fabric. The outsole is faux suede. The striped fabric on top appears to be lightweight cotton. These slippers are very light. I did not find them to be too large as other reviewers have stated. I ordered 7 ½ -8, and I wear women’s 7 ½ wide or 8 medium width shoes. I found these to barely fit the length of my foot when I wear a medium weight sock. I found the width to be fine, and even though the slippers did look a little different in sizes because of the way they are packaged (the right slipper is stuck into the left slipper, heel first), I thought they felt equally sized on my feet. I like the cushioned insole.<br />I ordered these because they were described as “deerskin suede insoles” and they certainly are not deerskin suede insoles. They are supposed to be washable, but I haven’t needed to wash them yet. They do have some cushioning to them and they are comfortable on my feet. I used to live in Japan, and these remind me of the type of slippers that many people use in their homes in Japan. They are kind of wide and shapeless, but that is the intended style and the overall look is exactly what I expected to receive. I do think they are fine as lightweight summer slippers, or to bring on a trip in my suitcase. I wouldn’t wear them outside. The overall quality looks fine to me, with everything neatly sewn and no loose threads."
4.0,These are soft and fit well (I wear size 7 shoes). I have washed them just once so far so I cannot speak to their longevity. They are bamboo viscose.
4.0,Fit as expected however i have a long torso so it was super short on me. Used it for a costume and it worked out fine
4.0,"Great belt for a Halloween costume (Rick and Morty). Otherwise, look else where for a legitimate belt."
4.0,"I will start by saying that this dress is beautiful and I am blown away by the quality. It’s really well made and the details are beautiful. The dress has some stretch so fit well on my curves. The only reason I couldn’t give it 5 stars was the length. I am 5’9” and the dress didn’t go to the ground. If you are shorter, this dress is amazing! If you’re tall like me, this dress won’t work..."
4.0,"The print and cut are as shown in the photo. Super cute and preppy. The fabric is like rayon and there’s a lot of cling to your body because of static. Super thin fabric, easy to wash and steam iron."
4.0,"I’m 5’11” - 190 to 195 pounds<br /><br />Medium is just a tad too small for me. I’ve worn these tanks 6 days a week for a solid year and they’re still kicking and haven’t taken on stink like some polyester stuff will.<br /><br />Buying again in large. Photos with green shorts are the large, which is better for for my size."
4.0,"I like it.  I was shorter than I expected.  My LO 3 years old is tinny and I bought a 3t expecting it to fit a little longer, but it was bellow the knees.  No big deal.  As expected for the price.  She looked beautiful that day."
4.0,"Four-stars because the hat material is painted silver--not dyed.  [I put some water on a inconspicuous area to see if the paint runs --noproblems].  Also the hat is kind of flashy --kind of a Kardashian look which is not my style.  I debated returning the hat.  And yet.... The hat fits perfectly and looks great on.  Something about the silver color, the black head band pattern and the rhinestones pops.  You will get noticed; you will get compliments. I would have been sad giving it back--so I kept the hat.  This hat would be perfect/five-stars for an outdoor party or everyday if you like glam and flash."
4.0,This looks great on but it feels a bit cheap. It’s fine to wear but I wouldn’t give it as a gift.
4.0,"Great material, wish there was one bigger link at the end so it would be so hard to link."
4.0,Comfortable. Soft material. Order at least one size up.
4.0,I thought it had more pockets.<br />Quality is not bad
4.0,"Very good slipper for the price, but I wish they had a no-slip sole"
4.0,"The denim colors really look like denim material, not like terry or sweats, but they are as soft and forgiving as a sweater.  The drawback for me is that I'm short (5'3&#34;, 29&#34;-30&#34; inseam) and the Large (which was too large but they have a drawstring so you can tighten enough to keep them on) has a 321/2 &#34; inseam!  And they are made like real jeans so it has the contrast stitching, so hemming them is above my skill level.  I really should have returned them, but I didn't have any clean jeans the day I got them, and I wasn't going anywhere, and they were so comfy that I rolled them up, pulled the drawstring, threw on a long shirt, and wore them right away.  I would recommend buying these but check the inseam length for your size to make sure  they fit."
4.0,This was a great value for the price. I would recommend this product and buy it again.
4.0,Purchased as a gift.  I really think she'll like it.
4.0,These are super soft and warm just not quite as big as I thought but I like them a lot.
4.0,"Me agrada el material y la horma de la talla porque es la esperada, sin embargo me pereció que se ve muy elaborada por retazos o a mi me tocó que tenía diferentes tonos en mangas y tronco, pero el mismo patrón de rayas muy estampado de los 70’s."
4.0,It matches my watch really well down to the color.  Very comfortable on the wrist.
4.0,"I really like this shirt. The decal is applied nicely with no issues like lifts or cracks. It’s super soft, too. It would make for a great lounge shirt. My only issue with this is the sizing. I ordered a 2XL because I like my shirts a bit bigger on me but this is super clingy on that mom belly I’m desperate to hide. I’m in the south so wearing shapewear underneath isn’t happening. Great shirt, just size up one or two sizes depending on how you like your shirts to fit."
4.0,The shoes look nice and has good support at the heel. Wish the toe and upper has more padding.
4.0,"Cute dress. Fits good, a little longer on me than I would like, I’m 5’3 and it comes to about my knees. Definitely size up. I’m normally a large and ordered an XL. The fabric is a little different than I expected but still overall a nice dress."
4.0,"We bought matching pull overs for our grandsons soccer games.  Color was perfect and the price was perfect.  I looked at Under Armour but the price was way too high for the purpose we wanted it for.  I bought one for my husband and myself and they run a little small, so I would order 1 size larger the next time."
4.0,"Top was beautiful! Loved the square neckline, my reason for ordering it in the first place.  Sleeves were comfortable.  What I didn't expect was the top being so tight.  I wear a Medium and the torso seemed very snug.  Was hoping it was a little looser, but still form fitting.  Still love it though.."
4.0,I like the idea that the gloves with scrubber. Its been about a month i have used these and these are good so far. I use them while doing dishes and these can also be used for general household cleaning. These comes with a small whole so you can just hang them to a hook once you are done. These are extremely easy to clean and more over these are dish washer safe. I am happy with this purchase.
4.0,"Nice size, pretty!"
4.0,Dress is nice and comfortable.  Faded a bit after 1 wash.
4.0,"Other than the length of the pant leg, the product was satisfactory."
4.0,"These came in an almost too tiny pouch, which had them bent a bit awkwardly, but I was able to straighten them out. I have a wide face for a girl, so these suited me just fine. I wouldn't recommend them for smaller frames. They do seem to be a bit too flat, not slightly rounded as sunglasses usually are, and sit out from my face more than I'd like. Perhaps I need to work on shaping them a bit more. They are light and comfortable. The color is nice. Plus, they came with a bonus cleaning cloth."
4.0,Comes Handy
4.0,This glasses are great although the pair i got had the lenses like mirrors not brown like the picture. Still my husband says i look good wareing them.
4.0,"This shirt is so cute and I've gotten a ton of compliments on it at work. I normally wear a L-XL shirt, and it's a little too big for me."
4.0,cute little heels that are comfortable and great for the business look
4.0,"the fabric is a tiny bit scratchy, but other than that, this gown has been great for keeping me warm and cozy during the winter chill."
4.0,"Okay so like any retainer jewelry it can be a bit pokey when putting it in so be careful. Also! Quick tip! If you cut the tops of the labret and nose pieces really small, just large enough so they don't go through the hole then you can't see them as much! I used one of the nose pieces trimmed down for my vertical labret and it worked really well! My family thought I took it out"
4.0,I would give this product 5 stars but we had to return the size 10 by it was too small and the back of the shoe was rubbing against the back of his foot so we ordered it in the size 11 and he is still having the same problem. He says that they are comfortable but I've noticed he has a blister on the back bottom of his foot where it has rubbed on his skin in just the few days that he has worn them. He only wears them for about 2-4 hrs a day when he wakes up and then when he gets home. His shoe size is 10.5 M and he could could probably go up to a size 12 but we will have to see how the size 11 works out for him over the next few weeks as he wears them in.
4.0,Love this shirt! Perfect for work with a cami under.
4.0,"The material is good quality, the colors are vibrant, and it fits well for a one size fits all, I just wish it was a tad bigger. Overall I am pleased."
4.0,"I love the feel & fit of the fabric on this top. It can be dressed up for work or casual for the weekend. The price is reasonable. My only complaint is that it's not offered in a crew neck style too, same colors."
4.0,"Once again I've purchased something without considering the care instructions, which aren't listed in the description. The tag on this one says to not tumble dry but to hang dry... With my situation I'm gonna have to tumble dry it anyway and hope for the best.<br /><br />Otherwise, they're very soft and smooth pajamas, very comfortable."
4.0,"Yes, I liked them. They weren't small enough for my infant. So I'm wearing them!"
4.0,This women's watch looks very attractive and stylish. Its dial' white color is perfectly matched with its rose red colored band and aslo with extra yellow band. No problem in time given by this watch. My wife likes it.
4.0,i LOVE these! only thing is that they may not fit the thicker leg... I bought these for my stepdaughter and myself and she is a bit thick from all of her years in sports.
4.0,Love it. Was initially afraid to purchase because of the one negative review but it's actually a beautiful dress. It looks just like the picture and looks beautiful on. I'm 5'2 size 10 and the large fit me perfect. If I was any bigger it may have been too tight. I couldn't get into the medium so it does run a bit small. But I'm very happy with my purchase and can't wait to wear it!
4.0,"The reason for 4 star is due to when I was sizing it, some of the pins were rusted and I couldn’t remove, so it was hit or miss when taking the links out on wether that pin was rusted and may not come out."
4.0,"I liked everything except the pockets.<br />If you’re a fan of kangaroos, then it’s perfect.<br />I’m not (I mean, I like them, but not as my dress design).<br />I still like how the dress feels and fits (very comfortable). I will probably wear it.<br />It could easily be one of my favourite dresses if it weren’t for those pockets..<br />For the reference: I’m 5’4”/ 118lbs, ordered small and the fit was perfect."
4.0,"Packaged in a nice gold ziploc style bag with tissue between folds. No odor like other customers have mentioned.  Nice soft cotton-feeling lining which will keep me warm outside. They’re snug but not so tight like spnx. I like these better. Be careful with your long nails bc you really have to grip the leggings with fists to pull up over hips.  Just sayin’ 😉 I’m 5ft5inches, 120lbs and I ordered the small.  Comfortably snug, not tight. Pants reach my ankles, these are not caprís.  Better than I expected and not too shiny."
4.0,Worn for a Harlem Nights Theme Party. I wanted blush instead of white for the pop of color against the black. It was long enough to wrap twice and still knot.
4.0,"Very pretty, the silver is very shinny (obvious costume jewelry trait) but still very pretty and shimmers. Made true to size and color, great for the price."
4.0,"Great shape wear for the price, didn’t cinch as much as I expected, but oh man it gives nice shape and smooths out the rolls."
4.0,"Wear 10.5, initially thought they were small but actually fit pretty well for workout socks"
4.0,It's just a little tight on my back but super cute<br />I have a wider back I suppose but I love it
4.0,"Very soft and very light. Fit was pretty large. I have big shoulders and a 42 inch bust so I got the XLarge and I was swimming in it. I have started the return process and plan to buy a size, maybe 2, smaller. It was light enough that you may have to wear an undershirt underneath if you live in Wisconsin like me."
4.0,"I ordered this a long time ago, and ever since it's been my favorite! I think it's a little bit on the large side but that's not a problem because you can tighten it with the drawstring. I would definitely order more soon."
4.0,"Sizing was pretty normal to your actual size. I'm 5'4 - 135lb and I got a medium.  I get compliments every time I wear it. It came wrapped as a gift , made me feel so special for getting work out pants 😀"
4.0,"This is a great size.  I bought it for a day bag while walking around during our travels in Europe.  Can still get the essentials in it without carrying around a big bag.  The leather is really nice for the price and the strap is a comfortable width.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my iPhone X doesn't fit easily into the outside pouch.  You have to really pull on the flap to latch it.  It will be difficult to find small things in the bottom of this purse because the opening is small at the top, but I didn't purchase it to pack it full."
4.0,"Very pretty, just not the color I needed."
4.0,What a buy for 🎁 to family!
4.0,"This is an awesome piece of jewelry, however the back has a rough finish. Typically that wouldn't be a problem, however it gets caught on shirts, causing issues with certain fabrics."
4.0,"It’s a nice shirt. Nice quality, soft. Fit as expected."
4.0,The band looks good with my watch and easily installed - it just needs to be longer
4.0,I only thought this would be a cross body and it isn't but it is a great purse.
4.0,"Fit is great but I wish there was a little more room I. The ancle where the Velcro is. When my daughter is wearing leggings if closes just fine but it she has on socks and jeans there is Bailey enough room for the Velcro to close, leaving most of the Velcro showing instead of being covered up. Other that that she seems to like wearing them. They are very warm."
4.0,This top fit perfectly.  The material is so soft.  Love it!
4.0,"This is a very good wallet and durable, my few complaints is the outside has gotten darker and scratches easily. Rubbing it seems to erase a few of them, but some are still noticeable.  What doesn't make sense to me is the RFID protection is the zippered compartment in the currency pocket. Why??  Wouldn't it make more sense to line the credit card pockets instead?"
4.0,These were great for my daughter's beach themed birthday party.  I was able to give out as part of the goodies
4.0,"The gray shirt says ""Triceratops Rex"", which I find pretty funny, but might bother others"
4.0,"Everything about these gloves works well for me.  The length covers the wrist, the finger length is right and the size is large enough without being baggy.  The cotton works well for handbell ringing and I am hoping they will hold up well after washing.Thank you."
4.0,Since my husband likes both bands will keep.
4.0,Ordered this for my son and he had no complaints
4.0,Thin material but overall cute coat for the price.  I have had several compliments.
4.0,Good fit but not much cushion. Bought it to wear them with Tobias who has flat sole.
4.0,Nice masks - they are not consistent in size - some are much smaller than others
4.0,"So two of these shorts have a pretty typical gym wear feel and two of them are sort of meshy. The blue and yellow ones tore at the crotch as soon as I put them on, but when I contacted customer service, they refunded me 25% of the sale price (since 1 out of 4 of the shorts tore). Additionally, because they are made with a mesh-like material, I was able to take them off immediately while the hole was still small and sow it together. The other pair of mesh shorts tore in the exact same place a few weeks later. I didn't contact customer service this time since they already refunded me with me continuing to get use out of the other pair, so I just sowed up this pair like the last one and they both work great. So, for the price, it's a great set, but don't buy these if you can't sow or if you don't have access to someone who can. Otherwise, half your shorts will be useless pretty much immediately."
4.0,Nice readers - love the frame style! It’s great to be able to read and look up to see the tv without taking off my glasses. The top distance lens isn’t a complete “zero” magnification but it still works well.
4.0,"Did not think it was heavy enough for these Indiana winters,but my Grandson loved it and wore it the first day of school after Christmas break! I probably should have given it 5 STARS!"
4.0,Love the shoes.  Very comfortable
4.0,They are  very colorful and attractive.  The rubber loop that fits onto eyeglasses tends to slip off more easily than eyeglass holders I have used in the past.
4.0,Foot bed too long for a small.
4.0,They two piece set fit great the only thing is I’m 5’4 and the large bottoms were too long. All in all the set was comfortable and soft. I should have bought two sets.
4.0,"I like the tanks and the way they fit, but they are definitely not compression. They are more of a fitted tank.  Work well for working out and the colors are vibrant (pink and royal blue)."
4.0,The material is heavy but wash up really nice
4.0,Good item at a good price. I only bought it for costume..
4.0,Fits fine just near neck area feels odd. Like I want to pull it down more. For office it’s fine price good. Material not bad just not as awesome as other one they sell but it’s nice not  as uncomfortable as the other  dresses from them was amazingly comfy.sticking near neck feels like choking me awkward may be just a defect as other dresses are amazing. Hoping they send one tht is not this way near neck so tight stich but doubt it
4.0,"Too small, but wonderful shirt. Just buy a size up and you’ll be golden."
4.0,"I like this bag. It is really pretty. However, be aware that the colors are different shades than the pictures on this listing. The straps are more of a peachy-pink instead of a tan. I was a little disappointed about this but the bag is still cute. It's also very roomy and has the perfect amount of pockets. I am actually returning my order to Amazon because I found this same exact bag for much cheaper ($23 instead of $33) at a department store in my local mall. Aside from the pricing, I would definitely recommend if you want a cute and unique bag."
4.0,"I chose blue and burgundy. The colors are great.<br />The size runs big. I ordered large and wear size 8-10. I should have purchased medium. Although washing has reduced the size a bit. Still should have purchased medium.<br />The ""drawstring"" does not adjust for size. Which made me not appreciate the look in my midsection. The material is all cotton and the extra fabric does not lay well.<br />However I wear it and it works for what I need."
4.0,Nice. Not as comfortable as the ones I ordered from wish. Wish had ones similar and the fitting was better (and style) but I do like these. They are nice for work at my desk but need to use something more protected when around co workers as it will no protect you from anything being so thin .
4.0,I loved the dress. I am 5'7 and  a little overweigh. The dress flows so any bulges are hidden. The length is a little short but not too much so. I bought the XL and would recommend it.
4.0,"I bought these to cosplay at a few cons this year...the instructions are not in english and really REALLY hard to understand by picture alone..i had to youtube it,didnt find the exactly same one but one similar  (although i forgot to save the page) took me hours to figure it out,had to watch the video over and over lol.since these are japanese size it was alittle small for me..im 5'5&#34; 170lbs so im a littlw bit of a bigger gal..i was on the very end of the straps when putting this together..if you are any heavier then me these will most likely  not fit!!<br /><br />Plus side is it smells wonderfully like leather (i always love that new leather smell lol) its pretty good quality it seems like..looks pretty awesome when put together<br /><br />Downside is..takes forever to first figure out...then about 10-15mins to do after you have mastered it..<br />if you are female..going to the bathroom when you are wearing it is a PAIN as you have to remove nearly ALL of the straps and then re do them!!! Also if you are big chested it may be alittle more uncomfortable in the bust area!<br /><br />Over all these are pretty cool.."
4.0,I ordered these but they were smaller than I expected. It was probably my fault because I should’ve looked closer to the size. They would be great to throw on a table as confetti or decor.
4.0,Was able to fit my passport and cash into the Leg Wallet quite readily.  Felt better as I did not have to leave my passport in the rooms at remote locations.
4.0,"Battery was dead when it arrived, but I was provided options (including return) to correct the issue. Repair cost was quickly and seamlessly taken care of by seller. The watch is boss. Wore it during All-Star weekend in Charlotte. Got mad complements on it, even in the team store!"
4.0,"I love this octopus ring! However, the only issue I have with it is that it turns my skin green after several hours of wear."
4.0,"Would have given a 5 star but the waist is too loose. Very comfortable, fits great in legs/butt though and enjoy those envious (and admiring) looks however I have to keep pulling them up. They are squat proof!"
4.0,"A little thick, but my grandson loved it."
4.0,"VERY PRETTY NECKLACE, BUT ONE OF THE BEADS WAS OFF. I WAS ABLE TO PUT IT BACK ON."
4.0,Great color scheme but I should have found a bigger size these run a bit small and pull too tight around the calf.
4.0,"I am very happy with the product. It's very soft and is nicely finished. It makes a wonderful gift because of the nice box it comes in, and the scarf itself is wrapped in a resealable plastic case. The presentation is beautiful and makes it look much more expensive than it is. It's available in a lot of other colors via a different listing, though most have the longer fringe. It's hard to find a scarf like this without the long fringes, which I think cheapens the look a bit. The shorter fringe, which is less common, is not as thick and it makes the scarf a bit more dressy. I would definitely buy it again for myself in another color, and have already bought a couple to give as gifts. I feel fine recommending it. I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4 if the product name didn't falsely state it was cashmere!  I did submit a suggestion to Amazon that the misleading product name be changed, though I was aware when I purchased it that it wasn't cashmere thanks to some of the other reviews I read (for other colors). At this price it was unlikely to be genuine cashmere, but because of its quality, I feel it is a good buy."
4.0,nice quality shorts
4.0,Love the glasses. The wooden case was not delivered.
4.0,"Love it, the only downsize is that it is pretty thin...the consistency of a t-shirt...I was expecting a light sweater feel."
4.0,I really like this dress. It’s work appropriate while also being a little sexy. Great length and fits my curves perfectly.
4.0,Point blank for the money this is worth the purchase.  I give it 4 stars because of the thinness right on top by the bangs. If you try to style it certain ways you can see right through it. Also it needs to be combed for it to stay smooth. But I still love it. Expect to trim the bangs also.
4.0,Went by everyones reviews of how small it was and ordered larger and it came larger and is too big so shouldve order her regular size but it's a cute dress
4.0,"The blue color bag I received was a dark Navy, almost black. The pockets were great on this for what I wanted, but ultimately I bought this to carry folders of paper. Based on bag dimensions this would have worked fine, however, the main compartment opening was not big enough for folders to clear the zipper without significant bending. If it had worked for my needs, I would have exchanged for a different color. Instead I returned it. Overall nice bag with great pockets and solid construction though."
4.0,soo good
4.0,Feels plasticy but looks nice. As expected with the price but definitely a nice looking pair of sunglasses to wear around and not worry if they become scratched.
4.0,I really love how the top looked and felt on. Very supportive and flattering! Pants are just okay
4.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter’s birthday photo shoot, it was perfect! The material is kinda like a shiny silk, super soft and cute."
4.0,Good quality suit. My only issue was it was tight in the chest (32dd trying to fit in the small) but I made it work. Overall I recommend
4.0,this thing is huge....thought it would be smaller.
4.0,love the material and price was very fair.
4.0,This was a gift and i was pleased with this purchase.  Nice weight also. You can't go wrong with the necklace.  I recommend your purchase
4.0,Very attractive and looks nice combined with other bracements.
4.0,This was vrey cute and fit me well. I am 135 lbs and the large was a perfect fit.
4.0,"The boots are adorable, comfortable, and well-made, and my foot feels great in there. Unfortunately, as many have commented already, it was too tight around the calf. I couldn't even zip them all the way up. I will be returning. It's too bad, because I know they'd be great!"
4.0,Super cute big enough to last my 20 month old daughter!
4.0,"I like this purse for its nice size and stylish look. I gave it a 4 star only because the strap is too wide and falls off the shoulder. And the pebble leather looks a bit fake, though it is real leather. I have bought items that imitated leather successfully, but never the other way around. Still, I needed a grey purse, a rare thing these days. But this one is made well and sturdily, and it does the job for an occasional use. The price was very reasonable, as well, so it was worth it. Maybe in black the leather looks better."
4.0,The product was crammed into a TINY reasealable baggie and when I took them out they were tangled but once I was able to unknot them they fit really nicely and look very sexy on!
4.0,good quality and as described. Happy with purchase.
4.0,"Size i bought - B36. Similar to something you'd find at a Forman Mills. I'm very satisfied with what I've received for the price. Fits very comfortable,  no poking, stabbing or tightness. Happy with my purchase, got here in 2 days!"
4.0,Love these PJs so comfy and wash up real well.<br />Top fits<br /> a little small compared to bottoms.
4.0,"Love it ,go jags!!!"
4.0,Good deal and beautiful necklace but the clasp was loose so it will need to be replaced.
4.0,It’s pretty and small. I didn’t have any issue with the product. Good for neat everyday wear. Will be great on my daughter too.<br /><br />If it’s not durable will update. So far at the price it’s good. Shipping wasn’t too bad.
4.0,"I’m an 11 size in regular shoes but after reading a couple reviews, I decided to go with the XL and good thing I did. These do run small so go up a size if you tend to get these slippers"
4.0,They fit comfortablly and I’ve had no problems so far.
4.0,Wore this to Opening Day at Del Mar. Holds shape very well. But make sure your iron is warm enough to get the creases from packaging out...
4.0,These are elegant charms.  I'll happily buy another batch when I use these up.
4.0,Cute skirt. The medium fit as expected (I’m 5’4 and 135lbs). A bit bunched in the front but not a big deal. Hit at my knees.
4.0,"there is a plastic liner in it to help keep the forehead shaped, wish they made it of cardboard or something, but you have to take it out due to condensation build up. otherwise the hat is great."
4.0,Overall it was a nice gift and enjoyable.
4.0,"It's a short dress,  beautiful patterns and it grabbed all the attention from the ladies.  Since it  is short I'm assuming that the top would have been better if I was smaller."
4.0,I use this as an undershirt for work...under my uniform for sun protection but unfortunately the neck area is too low....do like the tight long sleeves
4.0,"Comfy, but on the shorter side"
4.0,"The skirt is cute, however in the back in 2-3 inches longer than it is in the front. wish it was the same all around."
4.0,"Arms are a little tight, so I would size up one size"
4.0,"I love the purple color of this sweater I purchased for a family member.  She loves purple, and loves soft.  It was very soft, as well.  I just am not sure how this sweater will hold up after washing.  It felt a little flimsy, and might leave lint on other clothing in the wash??  I could be wrong.  It was a gift, so I can't really say for sure."
4.0,"This is the best basic hoodie!.  I can see how it could be too long on some people, but I'm 5'8&#34; so it's perfect for me.  It hits mid-thigh.  I usually wear a size L ('cause boobs) and ordered a Large.  It fits exactly like I wanted.  My only issue is that the sleeves aren't QUITE long enough.  They're close, but I have long arms and if I stretch them out in front of me, at least 3-4 inches of my wrists are exposed. I tend to roll things up anyways, so not a dealbreaker, just a note."
4.0,Super soft and warm! I am 5 feet tall 110 pounds the size small is nice and loose and hits me at my lower shin. I only give it four stars because I think it is overpriced. It’s the name I guess.
4.0,There was already a hole in the seam though-
4.0,Good thickness.  No issue after a month so far.
4.0,"I like the sweater very much. Since the feedback said it ran small, I purchased a size larger. Perhaps it's a preference thing, but the sleeves fit a little too snugly for my liking. No complaints otherwise"
4.0,"Looks good. Feels a bit scratchy at first, but after being washed and worn several times feels soft and delicious. Fit is true to size."
4.0,I ordered the wrong size of the Emmalise Fold Over pants and will be returning them for the right size. Thanks. Dragonfly in VT
4.0,Love this bag!!!! Just said it had a small rip on the handle
4.0,"A little cheaper looking in person, but they're the perfect size. I really like them."
4.0,"These run a good whole size too small. Once I bought ones that fit I like them just fine. They are a little stiff, but since they aren't flimsy, I think they will hold up well. Love the colors they come in!"
4.0,a gift to my Daughter
4.0,"I bought this watch but ended up returning it. The watch is excellent quality and looks nice as well.However, this watch is too big for someone who had small to medium wrists. The watch measures about 47 mm in diameter and I have realized that with my medium sized wrists- watches closer to 42mm look much better. The watch is also quite thick and heavy (reason for the 4 stars instead of 5)"
4.0,I am so specific about how mirrored my sunglasses are but these did not disappoint. Very comfortable too. Also they are polarized which is a major plus. Its hard to find sunglasses that are polarized and mirrored.
4.0,Just got this ring in a size 5 for when I am unable to wear my real wedding rings. I can't speak for the quality and hoping it holds up. The ring is shiny and pretty and I like the detail. It would never compare to a real diamond but does the job for a temp.
4.0,"Love how you cut these to fit, and the ""cut end"" is hidden forever. The grey color very cool - different, but subtle. I will say they are a little stiff in the area of the ""small of your back"". So sitting in a car it kind of folds in that area. All good overall."
4.0,"If you're hippy, Order up a size.  I ended up wearing mine as a shirt and still got compliments on it."
4.0,"Sufficient quality for the price I paid.<br /><br />I was cosplaying Mirajane Strauss from Fairy Tail, so I had to put the bangs into a ponytail, which didn't work as well as I had hoped, but it ended up looking okay. The wig is very long though, which was great, and the fibers are of high quality. It was a bit thin in places, but I suppose you could buy two and use hair from the second one to improve the thickness of the first. Overall, I was happy with the product."
4.0,"Is a nice bracelet, looks good and seems to be made pretty well. Can't remember if it was advertised more for guys, but I'm thinking it must've been...I have big wrists as a female and have had to return watches in the past because of the band being too short... definitely didn't have that problem with this bracelet, going to need to shorten it/remove a few links...but overall am happy with my purchase!"
4.0,"Good for the price, order at least 1/2 size up"
4.0,beautiful glass piece.  you can actually wear it on either side too ..if you wear it backwards it is flat and black.  beautiful
4.0,"I love the dress overall. The only drawback is that the top doesn’t fit the way I thought it would. On a smaller breasted woman I think it would fit as pictured, but I have more than enough up top and so instead of framing at the waist, it stops right under my breasts. It still looks fine but would have framed my body better the other way. It’s just hard to find nicely fitting clothes for big busted women."
4.0,"Nice hat for the price a little small but not to bad. I like it, something you'd wear outdoors like fishing or camping ect.."
4.0,my mom is a eucharistic minister and wanted it for mothers day.  very nice and the price was right. good quality and generally nice.
4.0,Good fit. Nice support. Not a lot of breasts space though. I sized up to xl. Im usually a large.
4.0,I wanted a compartmental tote to take on airplane. Wish it was a bit larger but should suffice
4.0,"This shirt fits true to size, is fun to wear and comfortable.  I got a bunch of compliments when I wore it to work.  A great price doesn't hurt."
4.0,"They are cut small, order 1-2 sizes up. Otherwise, Lightweight and snug on feet."
4.0,It fits my needs
4.0,I do not agree that the hook is on wrong you just have to push your earlobe in the middle that's basically the confusion. But I love my little pet
4.0,"Dress fits as expected, not too stetchy by it wasn't skin tight. I'm 5'1 130lbs and I ordered a small. Dress looks much better when your hair and makeup are done. I wish it was more snug around my boobs. Doesn't look cheap at all in person but it did shed some sparkles. I got lots of compliments. Only downside is the inside of my left arm somehow rubbed on the dress all night and it got irritated. Hopefully I can wear it again somewhere!"
4.0,The fit is great and works really well but it does roll down a little bit. It trolls so little it doesn't bother me. Worth the purchase.
4.0,"VERY COZY.  Got the gray black-model a.  Great color combo.  The lopsided cut gives this wrap character.  It keeps you warm when you wrap up in it.  I'd love a traditional ruana made from this knit!<br />To solve the shedding problem I saturated it with water, squeezed it out and put it in the dryer with dryer balls.  Then picked off a few pilling places.  No more shedding problem!"
4.0,The glasses that I received where not this coloring. They were a blue tortoise shell pattern. I just decided to keep them rather than go through the effort to return. Otherwise fit is good and I am satisfied.
4.0,"I have an affinity for aprons and own quite a few. This one is very cute and made “well enough” for the kind of use it will get around Halloween. It’s not daily wear sturdy, but for the occasional use around a holiday, it’s fine. I would buy it again."
4.0,Good shoes but take some fiddling with back strap every time you put it on.
4.0,This ran a little bigger than I expected but other than that are super comfy and look great!
4.0,A little big around the lower part
4.0,"The only reason I’m not giving five stars is because the pink color i purchased was so bright it was almost blinding lol but pretty, hopefully after a few washes the color will dull"
4.0,"I wear a women's size 9 1/2 or 9W.  I received this set in the S/M size which is listed for women's with shoe size up to 8.5 And I would say that is correct.  I could wear these but the heel wasn't in the perfect spot.  The L/XL would have been better.<br /><br />Compression is decent but not overly tight.  These were comfortable while running, although if you have very large calves I would go up 1 size.<br /><br />Washed/dried normal settings and had no shrinking."
4.0,I  love this bag for my swim workout. Only one complaint  the pockets on side are not big enough for the current size water bottle sold today. I had to undo some of the sewing to make the top as wide as the bottom then the bottle fit. I had to hand sew the seam back to keep it from continuing to undo.
4.0,"I ordered this KAMONG Women’s Leopard coat for my daughter and she likes, and says it fits her well, the zipper works, but the shade of the beige color was a little off from the pictures. Otherwise, she says it keeps her warm as our neck of the woods gets pretty cold during this time of the year. She says the fleece is comfortable to wear, loose, and extremely soft, smooth and fluffy. She likes that the coat was made of polyester and spandex materials and it seems to be good quality. She says the beige color matches some of her outfits, and she has worn the outwear with leggings, boots, and denim jeans, and they all look good with this coat. Though she doesn’t like that the coat isn’t good for rainy weather, because she had it on when it rained 2 days ago, and she got really damp as the fluffy material on the outside soak too much of the rain. Other than the rain issue, the coat does well with the cold weather."
4.0,I’m a 7.5 but ordered an 8 due to no half sizes. Fits like a 7.5! A bit stiff in the beginning but they are breaking in pretty easy. Look great!
4.0,ove the fpants but to large return will order in a smaller size
4.0,"Really pretty dress, was a little big. Material is very thin but not see-through."
4.0,This is the first time that I have bought a pull on pant.  I usually purchased button and fly type pants which are hard to find in the current size that I wear which is a zero/small.  Very comfortable and figure flattering.  I will most likely purchase again.
4.0,Very good materials with low price
4.0,"Wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments. The threading did come loose in a few areas which is why I didn't give it a 5. Also, the arms bunch slightly which can look a little sloppy in pictures. As long as your arms are straight, it photographs well!"
4.0,Great could use an extra band catch
4.0,"Inexpensive lightweight hiking pants, perfect for warmer climates. No restriction of movement."
4.0,"The shoes look exactly as expected.  I did not like that the ankle strap is higher than previous models so the heel doesn't stay in the shoe as well and you get that annoying flip flop sound against your heel when you walk.  There isn't any way to adjust for this, so they're going back.  Sad because they feel good, but not practical for me."
4.0,"I went With a size up and it came fast , looked very small when I took it out of the package but they stretch! and they’re actually to big but once i was Them I’m sure they will shrink , I’m usually and extra large but decided to get 2x . . Go with your true size.  Very cute tho! They look like jeans but feel like leggings 😊"
4.0,They were a gift for my niece.  She likes them.  They are nice.
4.0,"I recently purchased a Pandora bracelet, and bought this to keep my charms clipped. It works best on a silicone band to secure it to your bracelet."
4.0,Sent as a gift and they enjoy it. Says it's really warm
4.0,"It was not the color listed and the buttons were not the same as the picture, but it was really cute and my fiancé loved it."
4.0,"Straps are adjustable, good length (even for long legged people like me), a bit see through but nothing that seamless nude shorts undies can’t fix. I’m about 5’ 7” ish and about 140 for reference. I have a short torso and very long legs with a bit of a broad back/ ribcage. Size M worked for me."
4.0,"This is a very nice dress, love the material.  My only problem with this dress is the sleeves, there's elastic in the sleeve which takes the loose flowing look that's pictured away."
4.0,A nice keychain I would have given it 5 stars but it didn’t come exactly as shown. The small circle was blank on one side and the other had the name of the maker unlike in the photo. But everything else was perfectly as shown.
4.0,"Nicely crafted, easy to remove links with tool provided.<br />*IMPORTANT *  take care when attaching to your gear fit. I wasn't careful & snapped the locking tab off. In no way was it a manufacturers defect, just too much pressure exerted on my part."
4.0,It's a little larger than I had wanted but it worked for my Medusa costume.  The little jewels on the snake's eyes are cool.  It does sit on the neck funny but if you turn it to the side it lays nicely.
4.0,"I like this band but it is rather bulky. If they were to incorporate the OEM clip style with the hasp on this band, it would be 100% the best on the market!!!!!"
4.0,"I purchased the indigo and turquoise and loved them so much that I purchased the navy plaid . The first two were soft flannel but the navy plaid (a few dollars less) was not flannel and a little rough. I know it will soften up with a few washings, but wish it was soft flannel like the others.<br />The fit is wonderful. Roomy, but with a flattering drape. I appreciate the long length at 5ft 9in."
4.0,"Great flip flop, except it broke in 4 months. However, their customer service is good, and they are sending a replacement pair."
4.0,"This is the best top! I don't like the bottoms, but I paired the top with high waisted bottoms and it's perfect."
4.0,I bought one while I was in Japan and was sorry that I didn't purchase more while I was there. I saw it on amazon and bought one just to make sure it was the same product. I'm happy to say that it was and I will be purchasing more in an array of colors.
4.0,"Product fits just fine. Im about 5'8 and 195 pounds and it fit just right, maybe go a size bigger if you plan on putting more than 2 layers on."
4.0,Was great quality but had to return due to size was a little big for my steering wheel otherwise would have kept it
4.0,Very pretty I like  them  alot but more for  a wearing  to an affair  or occasion. I was looking to wear just for  every day wear. I guess  too dressy for  myself to wear  everyday.
4.0,Runs a little big but I am pleased with the quality!
4.0,"It fits my grandson fine did not it didn't come with hem in the legs, sticking in seam at bottom of leg games out up 4 I chee on left leg."
4.0,"Fits a size small as stated, material is very thin, but otherwise they are great compression pants."
4.0,Runs a little big ....but My son is in Iowa and he says it keeps him warm.
4.0,Cute and fuzzy keep you warm
4.0,This is a good looking mechanical watch and It's affordable.
4.0,"I got everything in description. I guess others that left bad reviews misunderstood and thought they where getting 6 cages. For the price very good deal. As you can tell from picture the pearls are oval shaped, I would have preferred round ones, but for the price there ok."
4.0,Love the oversized shades!<br />Little tight on side of head. Hopeful will loosen some with more wear.<br />No rubber pieces on the nose which is a little uncomfortable. The<br />Too big for my overhead sunglasses compartment in car. LOL<br /><br />Arrived with no damage. Very timely.<br />Feel they are worth the money.<br />Would buy again
4.0,Fits a little small.. Should've bought a bigger size. I wear a large in shirts got a medium.Material feels very comfortable tho .
4.0,WAY larger than expected!  Definitely NOT newborn size (they're more than half the length of her body and right now we could fit both of her legs inside each warmer!)
4.0,"They are nice feeling glasses, but the lens is in no way, purple"
4.0,I loved the way it looked on my sister. I got it for her. The color was great too & it went great with what she wore.
4.0,"I really like the slippers, they have a sturdy sole. Shhh....I even wear them to the corner store. The fit. Is a tad bit larger, mostly in the heel area. But I love them and wear them all day at home. Highly recommended."
4.0,It’s adorable I love it . Quality could be a bit better but it’s definitely breathable and comfy. Not at all see thru which is what I was worried about but I would definitely buy again.
4.0,This would have been a 5 start but I order a size 6 and got a size 5 1/2 they were a bit tight at first but I had no time to exchange them due to my flight out the following day. They have stretched a bit and feel fine now.
4.0,Exactly like pictures. Fits perfectly and so many choices
4.0,Not shabby. Lasted about 2 NFL Seasons.<br />Not bad.
4.0,received no problems at all
4.0,"I like everything about this dress: the fit, print, and collar. Will be wearing this to church tomorrow. Pictures are of me just trying it on straight from the box."
4.0,Ordered an extra small and got a small which looks like a youth med or large
4.0,"I wore this yesterday, and I received some many compliments. The bust area was a little tight, but it could be because I'm bloated."
4.0,I love these. Already used them 2x! Makes packing so much easier & unpacking.
4.0,"The material is a little heavy it will make a nice holiday dress, true to size, pretty red, can't wait to wear it"
4.0,"Cute earrings. But, the color isn't quite as bright as pictured. Still nice though"
4.0,"I bought this based on the video from a verified purchase, and it was what I expected. The sleeves are a little short, however; if they went down to my hand I would've given this 5 stars. I'm a fan of the tie around the waist, but you can't adjust the length of it. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,Wife is happy so am I!
4.0,My mom absolutely adored this and it is a beautiful necklace. The only thing that we didn't like was that they didn't center the design in the middle of the necklace. It was about an inch off
4.0,"I initially ordered the mediums because I’m a medium in other gloves but they were too small, way too tight, hard to get on, couldn’t even close my fist, finger lengths were not long enough. So I ordered the large and while they are a bit too big at least they are usable. For the price I’m keeping them, but keep in mind that a medium is not exactly a medium and you might have to size up."
4.0,"The fabric and design on this dress are lovely, with a classic flair. The color is exactly as pictured. The tailoring is actually quite good, which isn't always the case with clothing purchased online. The only issue I found with this dress is that the hips are quite narrow. The upper half of the dress fits perfectly, exactly on target with the size quoted, but, once you reach the hip area, where my sizing is standard, in line with my torso size, the hips do dramatically narrow. In laying the dress flat, I noted that the hips are narrower than the bust. This is not typically how our bodies are shaped, unless they've been altered or we are very, very lucky. I wish I could give this five stars, as it is so pretty, but the narrow hips make it very tight and would not make for a pleasant day, when attempting to sit. If they widen the hips, this will be perfect. As to the collar, it is perfect, quite flattering, and has a nice easy closure, with a little button at the top of the zipper on the back. Actually, this would make a very nice top if cut off several inches below the waist detail, so it won't be a total loss. Good luck in finding the dress for you. If you have narrower hips, the fabric on this is nice and thick and quite appealing."
4.0,I bought this as tribute to those in my family who have passed. The stones are very tiny but I do love it!
4.0,"Comfy and warm.  Oversized to cover ears completely.  If you hate having cold ears, buy these, just do it.  Well worth the price.  They dont mess up my hair either."
4.0,"Fit a woman, cant see them fitting a man!"
4.0,"It was very comfortable, just a little large in the cups.  I needed a plunging bra for use with my wedding dress.  Worked perfectly for what I needed."
4.0,Only giving it 4 stars because it is so tiny it should really be for a child not an adult
4.0,Beautiful style dress was what I expected
4.0,Taking the bracelet and earrings out the package they were shinny and sparkling it's a beautiful set I tried the bracelet and earrings on they feel nice I'll be back to add to my review after I've worn it a few times
4.0,"Snug as a bug in a rug, that'd be a good analogy for how my head felt inside this on a cold winters day. The dual layering keeps the heat in, and the cold out. There's some minor annoyance with the tags inside the hat, but nothing deal breaking.<br /><br />Sadly not everything is covered, the cap is 'just' not large enough for a big head like mine. Leaving the earlobes hanging out and getting chilly. The whole cap is very tight and hugs my head pretty tightly, making for a nice warm feeling, but taking it off reveals marks on my forehead there the brim of the hat was laying.<br /><br />Overall, a good hat, perhaps for a smaller head."
4.0,Fits well for price
4.0,I have ordered these 2 times. Worth the money. Fit great.
4.0,"A very nice, full size, sturdy waterproof apron! My grandkids love the cute puppies. Good for washing dishes if you get the ""wet belly"" syndrome."
4.0,This is so super cute. I love the little crown head hand that came with it. Its kind of small for my daughter's head but the crown is just a clip you can take off and out on something else. It came with a second headband with a flower. It was too small and the flower was coming apart a little bit though. The shoes fit my daughter who is a size 5. They are crib shoes. For a first birthday outfit this is perfect and good for the price.
4.0,I like the back pack - it's cute -however the ears and little &#34;nose&#34; make it look more like a pig than a cat. That's OK - but we were really hoping for more of a &#34;cat&#34; look.
4.0,Just right for brisk walk on a very cold day.
4.0,As expected. They were all jumbled in a tiny bag together.
4.0,pretty and got a good price on it .
4.0,"good,happy with this"
4.0,It was as expected. Cute! If you are looking for something made for costume jewelry!
4.0,There are some rough edges that get caught on clothes and scratch your skin
4.0,"Took a couple tries to get size right, ran small"
4.0,Love the string (had to knot it in the center to be a decent length for a toddler) so they don't get loss. Not super thick material but still a sturdy and warm pair. (Not waterproof!)
4.0,"Synthetic fabric and would work well except that it's a tad too small and gives me a headache. I think that frequent wear might stretch it out, but I have other cycling caps so it's not so important to me.<br /><br />The colour and construction of the garment are great. It's just a tad too small"
4.0,It has a flap of material on the front that shows through the top. I had to have it altered. It is very 'see thru' so def need a cami under it. It's a very cute top for the money.
4.0,Does what a glove should do
4.0,"The chain was made like all the others but the necklaces itself was amazing, couldn’t have ask for better"
4.0,"Exceeded expectations. Lovely, nice quality. Could be overly large for some but I prefer bulky earrings, big very light."
4.0,"I don’t know why the bars are so thick it kinda hurts, but they still go in and look great"
4.0,Product was nice and customer service was great as well. They answered back right away when I had any questions.
4.0,It came when I decided to take nap....
4.0,It is a nice sweater beautiful color but the sizing ran much smaller than the other one's I ordered.<br />It had to go back
4.0,It’s very cute my my baby headed to small for it
4.0,"Very nice robe, I'm 5'7"" 165 lbs, order a xlarge it fit tight in shoulder and belly area. XXlarge would probably fit better. Length is right on."
4.0,Ordered this for a friend and at first she wasn't excited. She put it on wore it for a little while and decided she loved it. I loved it on her...and she received many compliments. She wasn't excited about the bottom hem part but she unstitched it to loosen it up and continued loving it. Received pretty quickly and with 0 issues.
4.0,"Much better quality than other ninjago jackets in the market place. I really appreciate the fact that this is a cotton jacket (as oppose to all polyester), it has been great for all kinds of weather and after many washes it still looking great!"
4.0,Good product!  I was able to remove two links easliy with no problems.
4.0,"This tutu is really pretty, but I do wish the sections were all sewn together. It's fine with some leggings under it, but wouldn't be ok worn alone."
4.0,"One pants I bought  is a very strange khaki, a gold-orange shade of khaki. The light blue color is excellent.  The pants when washed must be ironed.  The waist has a good wide elastic.  The draw string is heavy cord and not needed. The fabric is good, woven, and appears to be 100% cotton.  The pants leg bottoms are wide- almost a bell bottom, but officially classified as a boot cut.  Nice deep front pockets that can hold a cell phone.  The inseams (on size medium) are 30"".  I would consider buying buying more in other colors."
4.0,Very pretty. Got it for my god daughters b-day.
4.0,Awesome but a lil large
4.0,order down a size.
4.0,Material soft fits ok
4.0,A good support sock.
4.0,"This shirt has a good fit and I really like the look of it. It's an interesting material with a really nice, tight, woven look. I'm generally skeptical of the quality of clothes bought online, but it's held up perfectly well to routine wear/wash. Considering the ridiculous prices and terrible quality of some well known brands, I'm definitely happy with my purchase."
4.0,"The lock part of this doesn't push through far enough to lock, but luckily two pieces fit into the holes tightly and stay put.  It will do the job and as long as it doesn't start coming off when I'm doing my activities, I'll be fine with it."
4.0,"Tight, even for my 2.5 year old.  And not adjustable or easy for him to put on himself. However, they get the job done.  He can help me (a little) with vacuuming now."
4.0,"I like the look, the fact that they are lightweight and most importantly, pink. What i dislike is they do fog up and they were advertised as no fog."
4.0,"Although it is described as washed cotton, the material is less broken-in than I would like it to be. The size runs bigger than other polo style baseball caps I have owned or seen out there. I will make an attempt to shrink it with some hot water to get it down a size to fit my 23"" head."
4.0,Shoe is comfortable.
4.0,Good quality and is pretty it fits and can go with most shirts
4.0,very happy with service and product..
4.0,Was good.. I'm short so it was upto my knees
4.0,Did not remove them out of the bag. It appears to be thin material. Bought this for Christmas for a 5 year old in a cold climate.
4.0,My son absolutely loved these. Be sure to wash on gentle cycle. I washed one in with regular clothes and there are now snags all over the front making it difficult to recognize the picture.
4.0,"I was very hesitant to purchase this item. This was a purchase outside of my comfort zone, and I am so glad that I did it. It fits very well. It's super stylish and sexy. I got lots of compliments. It's my husbands new favorite outfit of mine."
4.0,"Belt was as advertised, but I have a 36 in waist and ordered a 40 in belt. I should have ordered 38 in as this to long, but I will cut it off and punch another hole in it.Otherwise I was satisfied with it."
4.0,"I'm 5'2 125 lbs 32d. Bought size small. Sidefeel/white. Slightly loose around the waist and short, but i kinda expected that thus i'm ok with it.  I'll probably wear this as a casual dress around the house,pool or at best to the grocery store etc. Slightly see through from the rear when you bend over. Not so much when walking around since the dress is loose. I feel good with the overall purchase."
4.0,rolls down at the top when bending
4.0,"This is very warm and light weight.  The only issue I have with it is the neck.  If I leave it open it doesn't hang well, snapping it up is too warm for my neck."
4.0,Holds more than you’d think
4.0,"For reference I am 5’9” and 160 lbs, athletic build.<br /><br />I typically wear a medium in these types of dresses but this one the sleeves and chest area were too tight. I’m exchanging for a large which I think will work well. Super cute dress, lots of colors. It is long enough too, which is a huge bonus."
4.0,This is a nice bra.  It fits as expected and feel like it's made of good quality material. It's very pretty and feels nice.  The pads do move around quite a bit which is a little annoying but not terrible.  It does provide some lift but not as much as I was expecting.  Overall I would say it's a pretty decent bra.
4.0,Love the dress fits perfect very comfortable
4.0,Cute dress but probably will only get 2 wears out of it as the sequence falls off
4.0,My husband is a a small/medium.  The medium was too small.  Pattern was fantastic though.
4.0,"Beautiful and unexpensive dress,  good quality fabric. I recommend to use it as swimsuit cover cause is really  see through. I'm giving four stars only because of the size, I'm 5.6&#34; , 127 pds, usually I wear small, but in this case the small is still too large."
4.0,"So cute! I actually bought these for the larger earrings but like the smaller set better! The first picture is both earrings side by side for a comparison, second picture is the larger earrings, and the third picture is the smaller earrings.<br /><br />My ears are fairly sensitive so I usually wear sterling silver or stainless steel. I’ve had no issues with these irritating my ears. I do not wear earrings overnight, but do wear these quite frequently throughout the week."
4.0,"Was expecting it to be way bigger but it fit perfectly, I went with a higher size because I wasn't sure if the 14 would be tight. I recommend it!"
4.0,It's a very nice time peace
4.0,It is much smaller than it appears in the photo -- harder to see the detail but it's all there.  I'm happy.
4.0,More of a support T shirt than compression shirt
4.0,"They are SO cute. I have the braid style. I am finding that that it comes loose a little easily, especially for the white one, so I'll see how it goes but I really love them :))"
4.0,I really liked the belt ordered a large and should have ordered the small. Other than that i really did like the concept of the belt.
4.0,"I love this ring!  My husband surprised me with it for Valentines Day .  I love the unique design .  However if he had not told me it was a pink pearl , I don’t think I would have known .  Beautiful none the less!"
4.0,Received in expected time.  Love the way it looks on.
4.0,Comes smaller than expected but still is cute to wear.
4.0,Excellent fit and support
4.0,Super cute and I get tons of compliments. Bought it a few months ago and the material is starting to show obvious wear and tear but awesome purse
4.0,I am a heavy user!! I bought 5times same clothes
4.0,I love this outfit. Fit great.
4.0,Got this today and the delivery sent it right in front of our door wich is good. It looks really good just not expected to be big for me. If its a little more smaller then its a five star. I like that the handbag gows down.
4.0,Extra-long earring.
4.0,I used it through the winter while riding my electric bike to work.  It is breathable and warm.
4.0,I got this on a gold box deal.  Great sweater for the cost.  It fits a little small so I went a size bigger.
4.0,"Would have given 5 stars; however, this dress was much shorter in length than the other two dresses (different colors) that I ordered."
4.0,"This is a cute shirt especially for those who loves dogs. I ordered this in size medium and I think it's a little bigger than what I prefer it but not too big. The shirt is made of 100% cotton so it's very comfortable and breathable. The shirt brand is Hanes which is known to product really nice quality and comfortable shirt. As for the print, it's well done and looks exactly as in the photo.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,I used some blue nail polish to colorize it and it looks great.
4.0,looks just as photo
4.0,Such a cute top but the breast area was cut smaller than the rest of the shirt. I get a lot of &#34;cute shirt&#34;comments though.
4.0,Very cute shirt but definitely a juniors fit/cut.  Not made for a woman with womanly curves.  It is more of a slender fit.
4.0,"I really like this purse. It seemed pretty small at first, but I was able to fit lipstick, gum, credit cards, money, and my iPhone XSMax inside with no problem. You probably could also fit a single car key in as well, but not much more."
4.0,"Good looking, fits as expected.  nice addition to may summer hat collection."
4.0,Not the best for someone with wide feet.
4.0,"These work well except they are very silky which feels nice but also causes foot to slip around in shoe, would prefer them to not be as slippery but otherwise nice"
4.0,Smaller than anticipated but it is cute.
4.0,These are great for staying warm in the cold.
4.0,"I loved this watch. It went missing recently and no one seems to be selling them anymore. Makes me sad, but I suppose that’s life."
4.0,"I like everything about this watch except I noticed some condensation under the glass while working around water on a hot day outside.  I didn't get water in or on it to my knowledge.  It is still working fine, but I have only used it a week so far."
4.0,"I love the style. However, the fit is really for non-curvy women. It's a little tight on top for me. If you're curvy, order one size up from what you normally wear. The waistband is easily adjusted."
4.0,This is beautiful. A nice gift!
4.0,"Item is what it is. Noting fancy, And nothing crazy quality wise but works great for a costume."
4.0,"Love this shirt so much, I only wish I had gotten it in a bigger size. It's still wearable and not too tight either but it does run a bit small but just get a size up. But I love it overall!"
4.0,"I like the feel of the material. It was mostly comfy, except for the neck area."
4.0,"This dress is sure a great one but the only downside is the length of the dress, it’s a bit long for me. It’s little over the midi length otherwise this is a great looking dress for taller women.  I’m 5.3ft and weigh 135 lbs, I ordered a medium"
4.0,"T-shirt has a great feel, and washes nicely. Guts, Grit and Lipstick...  every time I wear it I get compliments!"
4.0,I play pickleball 5 days a week and the shoes grip very nicely.  I would recommend these over shoes that cost 100 dollars more and do the same for a lot less
4.0,Product as described so read carefully before ordering. Quality  is good.
4.0,I wanted to keep these but the strap will probably loosen as I need to stretch it to get it into the tip of the strap. As you can see the straps don't reach to the holes so I can't secure my shoes on. They are beautiful though. Recommend for people with thin legs and wide feet.
4.0,No Fur in the inside. But a good sole you can walk outside
4.0,"I received these little gems much sooner than I anticipated. They are small and quaint but I bought them to go with another set of hoops. My purpose and their size are a match made. They are very pretty and would be perfect for a young girls first pair of earrings or just everyday fashion for someone. Inexpensive yet very pretty. They are comfortable in my ears and I tend to think I have thicker lobes, which sometimes earring hurt. Very pleased with the look, price, and time to arrive."
4.0,"This is a pretty good pack for the money - only thing missing (1 star) are exterior strap attachments but, it seems most packs these days are made without those: contemporary streamlined style. I'd recommend this for casual weekend campers."
4.0,This underwear kept me warm working in the cold all day. The underwear runs small for my size XXL.
4.0,Smaller than I expected. But for an adult but to small. Received it fast and it is nice. Will gift it to a nice.
4.0,I love the shirt but it ran a little small.
4.0,"The earrings are very pretty, but they are a little heavier than I would like."
4.0,"Love square frames, I got these to replace my square topped round bottom ones like them which I preferred but these are a decent replacement"
4.0,"Very sturdy belt and so easy to use.  No more searching for loop holes, etc.  Pull taught and move along.  I didn't give five stars for one reason....the belt and buckle had an odd smell when it first came out of the box....not like leather...but something else.  The smell did go away after first day of use.  Other than that, this belt is very good."
4.0,Beautiful coat!! The only snag is that the end of the pockets aren’t secured to the coat. If you put your hands inside the pockets are immediately visible as the coat moves.
4.0,Beautiful shirt. The material is a dry fit type. Snags on everything.
4.0,"Item definitely worth the price! The only thing that would enhance them; list the compression range. I wear compression socks; making them available with different ""specific"" compression ranges would be a definite plus."
4.0,It fit good! Wish the dress stretched a bit more.
4.0,"Good overall, but is a little overpriced."
4.0,So cute. Sheds a lot
4.0,"fit is slightly big. I returned the large (my normal size) got a medium and there is still plenty of room. otherwise, great! kept me warm and dry skiing in single digit temps. zippers are a little cumbersome."
4.0,got this to stop the top of head cowlicks from my CPAP headgear. It goes down the back of the head so as to not ride up during sleep. and not a bunch of extra hat to interfere with the head gear.
4.0,The product is a great value overall the only complaint is the color represented on line is a little deceiving they are more yellow than green.
4.0,"This turned out to be different in color than I expected, but I like it.  The color limits which outfit I can wear it with.  I have lost my hair to chemotherapy and ordered seven scarves one day.  It is well made and easy to wear as a head covering."
4.0,Nice and lightweight.  Easy to get on.
4.0,I really like this dress. It is a perfect spring or date dress.
4.0,Fabric a little thin but dress is still cute and easy
4.0,"I really really liked these earrings, but had to return them because they were to long for my ears."
4.0,"Good for the money, and as it was used (for a costume party), but not a super high-quality piece. A little uneven in the construction. It would probably not be suitable for anything that was a constant or professional use. But for a single use costume it was fine."
4.0,They look very cute but they are not so comfortable
4.0,It is cute and probably won't blow off in the wind.
4.0,Very nice Spring color.
4.0,Fabric is as expected for price. Easy to put on.
4.0,Not too heavy but great to take along to a restaurant or football game.. You can dress it up or down.. It takes a little longer to arrive. I thought it was worth the wait..
4.0,it's ok not that long though.
4.0,"Great sunglasses!  Super comfortable, lightweight, and they stay in place with the nosepiece.  I highly recommend them if your on the fence about picking up a pair.  You won’t find this quality for the price anywhere else.  The packaging is better nice as well. I was not expecting that at all.  I do have a second pair, not the same style, but same brand and I never know which ones to wear because they are just as nice.  Big shout out to their customer service team as well!!!  Amanda has been super helpful and extremely patient!!"
4.0,"I'm a curvy, plus size gal. Normally an XL is just right. This ran a bit tight in the chest, as you can see. I would recommend going a size up. The material was a great weight, the length was perfect for leggings, and the color was vibrant."
4.0,"It’s a beautiful shoe, but it runs a bit small. I ordered a 7 and I could have ordered a 7.5."
4.0,"(Written by my wife) The sandal fits well and looks nice, though the part/strap that goes on the top of the foot is wider than expected based on the photos, but it's still nice. Disappointed in the amount of support, however. I have an issue with my heel and need extra cushion and more arch support, and while the amount of cushion feels fine for now, you can tell it will get worn down quickly, and there is absolutely no arch support to speak of. Again, overall it's a nice sandal, but not what I was expecting."
4.0,Shoes work as advertised. Fits well. The power button needs to be relocated. Presently it’s inside and it irritates the ankle. I’m overall statisfiied
4.0,"The post is a bit too long resulting in me having to fix it from rotation every so often. Other than that, these are beautiful and of great quality. They are sturdy and have not tarnished at all. I've worn mine to bed overnight and in the shower."
4.0,This is a good watch and the sale price was amazing! The clasp is really sensative and comes open a couple times a day. I wanted something durable for work so I am hoping the crystal holds up.
4.0,This is a really delicate and pretty piece of lingerie. The bottom is a light pink thong with the lace skirt attached to it so it is one piece. The top has two straps and a tie around the back. There is a sheer overlay underneath the flowing lace. The top was a little tight. I normally wear a size XS/S in shirts and a 34A bra size but the straps were a little tight. Not enough to make me unable to wear it. I love the shade of pink. It's very delicate. I'm very happy with this product. I would be very delicate in handling and washing as the majority of the outfit is sheer/lace.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,I really like this elephant but it fades out after 2 weeks and it doesn't look pretty. I just found the same one later at a store for only 3 x $10.
4.0,"Attractive and slim. Just fits my cards keys, comb and lipstick and phone (note 9). Wish just a tad bigger"
4.0,very comfortable. They could be used for slippers and outside use.
4.0,It looks good!
4.0,"Super nice shoe! Solid and very clean in details. Straps are quality and thick. as nice as any malor brand, as I have been shopping around! Sizing is accurate, a 43 fits my 9-9.3 foot."
4.0,"The Roman Numeral for 4 on the watch is incorrect. It should be IV not IIII. Other then that, it has worked great."
4.0,"Thought I'd ordered a small (receipt said medium) and was 2 seconds from returning it, BUT it fits perfectly. I got a medium, and I'm 4'11&#34;, ~130lbs."
4.0,"The shorts are well made, but I wish the cut was quite a bit fuller to fit a size 3XL man."
4.0,"Tried several compression socks and these were by far my favourite socks BUT they are too long for my legs so the top band tends to fold over and lodge right in the crease under the back of my knee and it gets uncomfortable.  If these come in a petite I will snap them up because the socks are wonderful - nice thick sole, great pattern, not overly long I the foot - unfortunately too long in the calf for me."
4.0,Super cute skirt but fits extremely snugly. I appreciate the zipper in the back and the slight stretch in the material. My hips were just a bit too big for this skirt to be flattering on me but I love it so much so I will keep it in mind in case I ever lose those last 20 lbs.
4.0,"A few days after receiving the bracelet, I had to glue two of the hemp ropes, as they were coming out of the braid. I have not worn it since I glued it, as I want to be sure it is OK first."
4.0,"Already sized a couple watches in record time.  Kinda fun, just make sure you push the pin from the correct side of the watch and remember which side to replace the pin, but that is for any of these tools.  Great bang for the buck!"
4.0,I wasnt sure how short/long the crop would be but it is actually just like the photo. I dont have a large chest and it fit comfortably
4.0,"I bought the 3 XL. Normally, I wear a size 12. (Sometimes 10 or 14, depending on cut and store). My chest size 42 inches, under-bust is 34 inches, with a bra size 38 C/D. There are two little hooks to close the front a little more, but I would have to wear a cameo underneath it. It is a nice dress but it fits so snug, like a second skin, that I am afraid I am going to bust a seam with a wrong move. I had hoped, it would fit, because I would love to keep it. The material and embroidery are nice and the skirt and front of the chest are lined. It says army green for the color, but it is more of a grey-green. I am sad I have to return it."
4.0,"It's cute. I'm not a tiny person and it fits as expected. The cape is loosely attached to the tank, so if you don't want it, you can pull it off."
4.0,"Comfy, but why do all pajama jeans fit so different? This is my third pair, I like that they are a thinner material than my others. Of my three pairs all the same size, these are in the middle with the originals running most true to size. If you want a real loose boyfriend jean look, size up!"
4.0,I love this dress. It fits great. It is definitely not a summer dress. The material is very thick and heavy.
4.0,"Nice, work good and easy to adjust."
4.0,Thought it would of been a bigger buckle but nice still
4.0,I love the bracelet is very fashionable . The only thing I'd every time I have to take shower I have to remove it to prevent it from getting wet . Beside that I really love it
4.0,"The only reason it's not 5 stars is because they have really small flares, but besides that I love them!"
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress. It is well-made and fits well. The tassels had to go though. I'm not quite sure what the designer was thinking, they are neon!"
4.0,"I love the color of this dress!  It is a fave to wear for sure!  I am 5'8.5"", 133 lbs and this dress touches the top of my feet."
4.0,"Fabric feels great, seems nice and warm. Mine came with a hole in the interior pocket, I was able to sew it up, and since its an inside pocket, it does not show (I'm not great at sewing.)"
4.0,"They are nice and do what they are supposed to. I use them to cover my tattoos and work.<br />They can get a bit hot during summer. But they look just like in the picture, feel good and do not warp or deform even when washed."
4.0,Got it for my girl and she loved it.
4.0,"Lightweight, nice easy fabric for Summer but it wrinkles easily. Be prepared to iron it. Otherwise, I like it."
4.0,Daughter wore to High School dance and felt comfortable.  Arms were a bit short in length
4.0,"For the price you really can’t beat it. It’s a solid bracelet, the chain snapped, however, in a few hours! I kept seeing these on Instagram and really wanted it! Thankfully amazon had many options of what essentially is the same item. I just randomly picked this one bc in reviews it said fast shipping. The ONLY complaint other than a cheap chain) is that after opening it once and putting it on, I unlocked it to show my daughter who is begging for one, and it WOULDN’T close again, it took a few minutes and I didn’t want to force it in fear I might break it! It’s a super cute concept and I’m overall very happy with my purchase. I’d recommend putting the key on a different chain bc thankfully I was in my house when it snapped but if it had happened In public I’d be without a key! I don’t see a grown man wearing  the key which I guess was the point in the design. I’m giving the necklace to my son bc he always has a key to my heart! Will for sure be purchasing two more! Cake super fast and again, can’t be the price!"
4.0,"These are cute but they don't last long. A couple of them broke off before the end of the day, you can super glue it back on. My 2 girls love these rings and are super happy with them. They are fun and cute."
4.0,Like the plain solid colors- runs about a size small. BUT doesnt shrink and wears well
4.0,"Fits me like a glove. I'm asian 112 pounds, 5'3&#34; tall. The material is great and the color is just too cute to resist. I ordered this through Prime and I was supposed to get it after two days but arrived 5 days later."
4.0,"Bought them for skiing in Utah and they worked out great! Warm, comfortable, look great and fit just right. My only suggestion would be a zipper by the ankle to allow them to go over the ski boot."
4.0,"I like the shirt, and its well made, its just a bit small."
4.0,"This is a decent Tshirt. I like the pattern of black and white stripes and the quality of the shirt as well.<br /><br />PACKAGE CONTENTS:<br />- One Tshirt (pattern exactly as pictured)<br /><br />PROS:<br />- The quality of the material is good. The t-shirt feels really soft against the skin.<br />- Well stitched. No frayed ends or stitching.<br />- The pattern is great.<br />- Whites actually look like whites. No yellowing or bluish effect anywhere on the t-shirt.<br />- Good if you plan on layering.<br />- Striking pattern.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I expected the sleeves to be a little longer. They end right near the elbow and its a little uncomfortable when it creeses up when bending the elbow.<br />- I feel that the t-shirt is slightly loose, especially in the neck area and that it slouches a little.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this t-shirt at no cost in exchange for honest and unbiased review."
4.0,For the price I think they're nice. They don't seem to cheap and the lens is actually crisp. I need to see how they hold up.
4.0,I really like the style but it is a bit hard to put on by myself
4.0,Comfy and comfortable
4.0,It’s a little long but I don’t mind. It’s very shiny material which I wasn’t expecting but it doesn’t look bad. I like it.
4.0,I have a 36C cup size and I got this crop top in a size large. It fits really well and the material is soft and stretchy. The only downside is that gap between the buttons opens up because of my chest but its not super uncomfortable so I deal with it. Other than that its c cute and simple top that goes with lots of bottoms.<br /><br />Let me know if you have any questions or click the ‘Helpful’ button if you found this review to be helpful 😊
4.0,Roomy..wish it was just a little bigger
4.0,Nice look!!!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c45c3dccbc4475d09fd53cebdf003980]] Purchased for my husband who is 6' 1"" and about 265Ibs. Not sheer at all. He did find it a bit too warm but he overheats easily and the weather was pleasantly warm. For a Halloween costume I'm pleased especially since he is a difficult size to shop for."
4.0,"I am 5""9' and thought I would go with the large to be safe on the length side. I would not be able to wear this with tall shoes, but it does fit me nicely other than that. There is lots of room."
4.0,For children or people with small hands
4.0,These are nice. I like the marbling effect. It gauge says is accurate. For some reason though these make my ears itch when I am wearing them.
4.0,"Very comfortable, easy to breathe. Slightly looser fit on my face than expected. Simply put slip knot in earloops and prob resolved. Overall very happy with my purchase."
4.0,Huge dark black glasses. Work great. Only 4 stars because the quality is not as good as it should be so I a not sure how long they will last.
4.0,This glasses are really nice and my only complaint was they were kinda small but it doesn’t really bother me so if you’re trying to get a just right size go with the medium.Kinda makes me look weird though but I don’t care.
4.0,"I bought these for a trip to Europe. I think they will fit nicely in my pocket as I walk around, but the lenses are smaller than expected, so I’m not sure how good the coverage will be for glare. We’ll see."
4.0,"I bought the 'orange' short-sleeved dress. I am 5'7 and weigh 150lbs. Jean size is between a 10-12, tees are a large, blouses are a medium. With that out of the way, and after reading the reviews, I decided to go with a Large on this dress. The fit is very flattering. It hides any imperfections, and flows beautifully. The material is very soft, and the colors are vibrant. The 'orange' is more like a bright melon (which is what I was going for) so I was really happy that it was so bright. The material is a bit thin, but it's what I expected when I ordered it. This dress will be the perfect spring/summer/autumn dress. It's so versatile, that you could pair it with sandals in the summer, and boots in the fall.<br /><br />Pros and cons to everything, right? There are a TON of tiny buttons on this dress. If you're like me, you're going to button each little button up, and never unbutton it again because there are just SO many tiny buttons! The arms holes were a little snug. With wear, they'll loosen up, but out of the box, they are tight. I took off a star for the arm holes, otherwise, the dress is exactly what I was hoping it would be. I'm going to get some of the other colors.<br /><br />I will update this review after I've washed it to let you all know how it holds up in the wash."
4.0,"This robe is very soft and warm. If you run warm, it might be too much warmth. I ended up giving this to my husband because he is always cold. It was a little too warm for me, and he liked it. It's a little too feminine for him, but men's robes are not as warm and usually have a belt to hold it closed. I'm the only one who sees him in it anyway so it's ok for him to wear it. This can stay completely closed to hold the warmth. It washes and dries well. It doesn't look as well made as some others, but he'll enjoy it while it lasts."
4.0,"As written before these thigh highs are pretty fragile, thin but have that nice see through quality I was looking for. So far they have held up for me. But do note that these are a cheap buy and the quality is equal to that. Treat them nicely and they'll last!"
4.0,Not a flimsy mask
4.0,The fabric's a bit cheap but feels okay and the hot pink color is terrific. Vibrant.
4.0,LOVE IT! I ordered 2 sizes up just to make sure it fit and it was a little too big-probably should have ordered just one size up.  It still looked great even a little loose.  It is super cute and comfortable.  I wore it with black tights and black boots to a concert.  I would have liked it to be a little longer.  I am 5'7&#34; and it was a little short.
4.0,"The only thing I didn't like about this dress was how high the neckline was on me, so I had it altered a little lower. Everything else is great! I ordered my size, XL, and it fit perfectly. The maroon color is gorgeous, especially for the upcoming autumn season with a gold scarf or jacket. Very warm and comfortable."
4.0,"If you fill up all of the slots, it won’t close.  Yes, I need every piece, which is why I give it 4 stars. But it looks good."
4.0,not a problem but I should've gotten the red mask instead.
4.0,"Nicely made and fit ok, but for some it could be a bit small"
4.0,I like this belt but it's a bit snug (34&#34; waist) I can still wear it but it's tight
4.0,Great glasses for the price!  Nice fit
4.0,"Fit perfect! Got an XL- I’m 5’7 about 185 lbs. super cute for my red riding hood costume. Loved the dress, but the zipper had issues because it’s so cheap and poorly put in."
4.0,"It is cute, but seemed a little large for the size I ordered"
4.0,It’s beautiful I love the metallic fabric and the drape of the garment. Good for the money paid. I had to purchase it a little larger than normal dress shopping but it had some wiggle room because of that and sagged a bit on the off the shoulder side.
4.0,The fit is great but it does take a little maneuvering to get into the body-shaper.
4.0,"This is a great shirt but its definitely &#34;compression&#34;. I bought a double xl and it fits me (230lb, 6ft male) skin tight. Material seems high quality, nice and thin for summer workouts."
4.0,The fit and quality were good. Does have an opening for your thumb and pinky.
4.0,The fit and quality of the shoe is perfect. worth the price and beyond
4.0,"Talla Perfecta, es muy bonita, sin embargo la calidad de la tela no es tan buena"
4.0,I thought I would be getting a more vibrant hue.  It's more mauve that I expected.  It's good quality  and the measurements are spot on!
4.0,I like it. But I would like it better if the midsection wasn't thin and different. Just same material consistently through tie. Description should have mention that. But it suits my purpose for wearing.
4.0,"This is a nice pair of glasses. Wide, and I've got a big face, but still nice. The only reason I didn't keep them was because I found another pair I liked better."
4.0,"I ordered the white and it is sheer, but nice and light weight. It’s the perfect robe to wear while getting ready when it’s warm weather. I like it!"
4.0,Good but too small
4.0,Very expensive and low quality.
4.0,A fine shirt for the price.
4.0,"I got these for a bachelorette party where we were at a wine festival in an outdoor park. They were cute and everyone seemed to like them! I thought they were a tad small for my head and heard a few other girls say the same. But they were really cute, great color assortment, and a hit!"
4.0,Item shows a Justin tag on the bag but it's not there. Saw that others had put that on their review before I purchased.
4.0,"These straps are a good value for the money. They are about 6-8 inches long which is long enough to wrap through any basket and around any handlebar or stem. Use these and your own basket to save lots of money ! The only negative - The straps are not nearly as heavy duty as shown in the pictures, but they still serve the purpose intended !"
4.0,Not much to say. They’re what you pay for
4.0,"So, are these a dupe for a high end brand.  No.  Are these a nice brand of leggings, yes.  Would I wear them?  To lounge in, yes.  My issue is the color... the color I purchased was identical to my skin, so I looked naked and that’s not my aesthetic, haha.  In any case, give them a try, you may like them.  They were buttery soft, and seemed like wonderful quality and best of all, there was no branding!"
4.0,"Very easy to switch out, and a pretty close color match to the watch face. Lots of compliments on the appearance of it. I shower and swim in the pool with it and have had no issues.<br /><br />However, I’ve found that it detaches at the lower side of the watch face unintentionally. Also, I have BIG wrists for a woman, and had to remove all but one of the removable links to make this fit. This band will likely be too large for most female wearers."
4.0,"This is really great for getting my envelope system and my wallet together in one place! It's not the nicest, best looking material but it's very functional!"
4.0,I thought it was going to be larger... it's nice though...it's 4&#34; from the top of the ring to the toe of the shoe...
4.0,"Too large but worth keeping. I am 117 lbs 5' 1"" and normally a small in everything. Ordered a small and it's huge but so oversized and cozy. I would swap it for a xsmall if they had one but since they don't I'll keep this. I hope it will shrink overtime. It didn't after the first time in the dryer."
4.0,"quality is good, I didn't realize how high the front band is, kinda less fashionable and more functional but the brim gives great coverage and the velcro strap stays put. I have a small head and this fits find. Washed it once in a lingerie bag and it held its shape. I ordered white and it is tennis white."
4.0,The quality is excellent. Extremely soft material. The only thing I would change is the length. It’s a bit too long.
4.0,"would have given this dress 5 stars but the length is short.  I am only 5'5&#34; and I got a small.  I really can't wear with heels.  But I will still wear it with flats. for reference I am 36 bust, 30 inch waist, 39 inch hips."
4.0,Un poco ajustada nesecitare una talla más grande
4.0,"It is compact, easy to use.  I will use it when I travel, keeping vital info in  my front pocket, not in the back pocket for security reasons."
4.0,Very fun bag
4.0,"These shoes are really precious, pretty and cute.  My little one LOVES them- she has her own ""high heels"" now.  Unfortunately, the bows fell off the shoes within a week.  But that didn't bother her at all, she still loves them and insists on wearing them all the time.  I supposed if I really wanted to, I could try to reattach the bows, but they'd probably just fall off again.  She's happy, so I'm happy."
4.0,Pretty comfortable. I dont like to sleep without a bra on. This is perfect for sleeping as well as wearing during physical activity.
4.0,"Good for the price. Thin material, a bit roomy on the hips. Comfortable"
4.0,This outfit fits nicely when you go by the measurements. although the fabric is pretty thin and if you dont wear accessories then it looks like you are wearing pajamas.
4.0,they are very pretty put run small and shrink a little when washed
4.0,Doesnt fit my boobs nor keep them in place for my workouts was expecting a certain fit like my other sports bars and thought id give them a try. The material i liked would have been comfortable if they fit right had to return them still gave it 4 stars
4.0,Bought as a Christmas gift for my grandson. Love it.
4.0,"It did not fit like the picture, however the customer service was great."
4.0,Very pretty and lightweight.  I had to bend this bracelet so that it would stay clasped.
4.0,Sadly had to return these sunglasses as they arrived with piece broken off the bow. Otherwise they fit well and had great color. Very cool sunnies indeed.
4.0,"Elegant, pretty lines, construction adequate, not something you'd find in a boutique, but at the price it is fine.  Neckline a bit too wide and plunged for my taste, but would be beautiful on someone else.  Returned."
4.0,The necklace and earrings look nice and you’re good for the price. But they just weren’t as big as I expected them to look
4.0,"Arrived sooner than expected! Loved the material, perfect fit!"
4.0,"I ordered this ZXZY Women Loose hoodie for one of our daughters as she needed a light top but that will still keep her warm as the weather in our neck of the woods has changed. She normally wears medium and after reading the fitting recommendations from the seller, we decided to get one size up and the blouse fit her pretty well and she said it was comfortable to wear, easy to put on and off and we were glad to have gotten a size up. Our daughter does like the pink color, the V neck design and styling of the hoodie and baggy long sleeve. She says she likes the words written on the blouse and the printed heart shaped pattern. She likes that it was made with cotton, and elastic fabric materials, and they seem to be of good quality, durable, and breathable. She likes that the blouse is lightweight, soft, smooth and gentle on her skin. Overall it is a good quality blouse for the price point if you don’t mind the baggy sleeves."
4.0,"These are cute, but I thought they would be tiny since they are for kids. They are much larger than they look in the picture, so I wasn't able to put them on the toddler I bought them for."
4.0,Something is not right
4.0,I would have liked the dress a lot more but the pockets made my hips look bigger than they were. I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear and it ended up too big. So just order your normal size and it should fit fine
4.0,These are cute but only fit my 8 year old daughters.  Not me.
4.0,I would have given this 5 stars but it was w little shorter than I expected and the colorvwas more bluevthan navy.
4.0,"I have a medical condition called Photo-sensitivity, I have a rather severe case can not for any reason stand direct sunlight in my eyes.<br /><br />I can not only go outside with these glasses, I can do it in the winter with snow on the ground and not end up bed ridden with a migraine.<br /><br />The only issue I have with these is the arms. They grip you on the back of the head behind the ear in the most uncomfortable spot. This is my second pair and the first pair I gave my father to wear after his cat surgery. I had to put those comfort pads on the arms where they grip your head.<br /><br />This pair I heated the arms with a heat gun and formed them to contour to my head.<br /><br />The issue with the arms would normally give this a 1 star rating because comfort with glasses is paramount, but given they give me the ability to go outside for long periods of time I had to give them a 4..<br /><br />I would give it a 5 but people just see the 5 star reviews and do not bother to read them....<br /><br />If comfort is paramount then do not order these!!! I also ordered the goggle version of these but the goggles are no where near as effective. the only advantage to goggles is the anti-fog that is needed if you are going to wear a balaclava..."
4.0,"I love the way it feels so soft!  This is a little big on me but it’s one of my favorite t-shirts to wear! The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because this t-shirt needs to be hand washed and lay flat to dry, or dry clean it. Which is DEFINITELY A NO GO for me!"
4.0,More yoga pant than casual dress pant. Fit as expected and comfortable.
4.0,"Love the colors, but one pair came without the piece to put into your ears."
4.0,"Liked, washed well and love the color-pink with black jagged stripes!"
4.0,For the size I ordered the arms could have been about a little bit bigger around...probably about a half an inch.  Other than that I was happy with it.
4.0,Pretty great but pill up a little
4.0,love it got so many compamints
4.0,"Fit a little tight, but seem ok. Have not washed yet. Great colors!"
4.0,"I'm very happy with this box. There were no flaws in the stitching or etching of the glass. I was worried that the Old English monogram would be difficult to read but it is very clear. My only complaint is that the latch feels a little flimsy, but it's not loose. The quality is great for the price.<br /><br />Just a note, the pillows that hold the watches fit loosely inside the spaces (so there is room for the watch bands). I would recommend keeping the box upright or putting a bit of double sided tape under each pillow if you are giving this as a gift, just so it looks nice when they open it and the little pillows aren't all askew."
4.0,I love the shade of pink. It’s not a stretchy material. I love it though. I have big arms so it feels a bit snug but it’s such a cute dress 👗
4.0,Great value. Only a little difficult to push one end of the wrap through the other.
4.0,"Too Small, for me.  I think if your top is not over a 34b you will be fine."
4.0,"Honestly, you can barely tell it isnt real! Especially from far away! The only reason I did not give it five was because the band was pretty thin. Even so, it makes my fingers dainty."
4.0,"This looked a lot cuter on the model. I think the cut of the shirt and the shape of the neckline detail is a bit boxy. It just hangs weird and isn't very flattering. Maybe a more exciting color would help if you are set on ordering this shirt, otherwise I'd pass on it."
4.0,"I absolutely love this sweater, it was packaged nicely. I liked it so much I bought 2 the only thing I'm not crazy about is the color,  either I'm color blind or it came in a not quite the same brown but a little more mustard color. But I'm still going to keep it."
4.0,"I looked around for a while for a hooded bathrobe that wasn't too expensive and was made from cotton terry. I'm very petite (4'10) and this robe is maybe a few inches above my ankle - admittedly it is quite large but I don't mind. In the dorm our showers are outside the room, so I can just put this on and I won't need anything else; the hood eliminates the need for an extra towel to dry my hair, at least until I get to my room.<br /><br />The robe itself is pretty soft after a washing, but I did notice a few threads coming loose. There was a LOT of lint when I first got it, but again, a washing solved most of that problem. Overall I definitely recommend - it's a great robe at a great price."
4.0,Practico y de buena calidad
4.0,"Exactly as pictured. Very cute. Mine came to me a smidge scratched up on the lenses. Nothing too obnoxious, but it does make seeing through them a little difficult."
4.0,"Cute little water shoe.  My kids loved how fun they were outside in the summer.  Great for sprinkler running!  They don't look super durable, but most water shoes aren't because they are made to dry quickly.  The sole is thick enough to stand up to poky rocks etc."
4.0,Fit nicely and stays on feet well.
4.0,"It’s very very cute, but the inside is very slippery. I would’ve liked a fabric with more texture so it would have enough friction to stay on my face without having to adjust it so often."
4.0,Very pretty and wears nice
4.0,"I had been considering getting this necklace for awhile, then my fiancé gave it to me for Christmas. After wearing it every day for a few weeks, I can honestly say that I couldn't go back to not having a ring holder necklace! It securely holds my engagement ring any time it becomes inconvenient, such as when I'm doing dishes, in the garden, or using the bathroom.<br /><br />The pendant itself is great! The sterling silver seems heavy and solid and is very smooth. I took off a star because the chain is not the highest quality and the latch is TINY, hard to open, and gets caught in my hair. I may end up getting a new chain because I couldn't go back to not having a ring keeper necklace on me every day."
4.0,I like the pattern! Unfortunately when it stretches the greys get a lot lighter. Just a little snugger than a normal xl but the top doesn’t roll down/stays put! Overall a really unique and cute pair of pants
4.0,"4 stars for fit, material and color. They are almost identical to Amazon Essentials, but cost more."
4.0,Good quality and I love the pockets
4.0,Nice product wrinkles easy but cute.
4.0,The glasses were delivered quickly and came with a very sturdy travel case which included a lens cleaning cloth. I have coronal implants and driving at night is very difficult because of glare caused by the headlights of oncoming cars. For Thanksgiving I needed to drive at night on an expressway with heavy oncoming traffic  for close to two hours. I specifically purchased these glasses to see if the glare could be reduced. I have to say that there was an improvement which allowed me to drive with reduced glare.
4.0,I would suggest ordering a size larger.
4.0,"Nice product,  a bigger fit then expected but still wearable."
4.0,Bought this for post surgery and it doesn’t button as described. Just another pullover dress. If you were hoping to wear it after breast surgery then don’t bother.
4.0,Amazing product!!! Easy to you use!
4.0,"Brought this with me to my vacation in Costa Rica. Worked really well. I think the lock itself is a huge deterrent, people see it and they don’t even think about messing with your bag because of the extra step. The cords are a little tough to pull in and out and the lockable strap is a bit rigid but they said those should soften with use so will have to see after a while."
4.0,"It fits as expected, but starts coming a part after you wear it a few times."
4.0,"I am a repeat customer of the Ameribag product.  The quality of this bag is top notch.  The size is larger than a medium...it’s even larger than the large I had, but it will work nicely for travel.  I sprayed it with a spot/water repellent to keep it from staining. The design with the magnetic fasteners is an improvement over the velcro fasteners from the past which tore away.  There is a roomy compartment for my iPad on the inside. There are also several compartments to keep one organized.  I intend to use it for my purse, even though it’s very large.  I like that one can distribute the weight of the bag across the front or back in a more healthy, ergonomic way."
4.0,"Pretty, look expensive."
4.0,This sweater just doesn’t fit the way it looks on the model. I expected something oversized- I would definitely order a size up. The turtleneck part is also not as flattering as shown. I still have 4 stars because maybe I just didn’t order the right size.
4.0,I saw this item for like $4.99 and was excited to purchase it but felt a bit tricked as the Amazon Prime shipping didn't apply and it ended up costing me $9.99 before I could re-do it.  I will watch for that in the future.  I was/am wondering if you could make a handbag strap for my purse in this same material/similar design.  It would be a superb complement to the purse I purchased recently.  Thanks
4.0,"Good, cheap quality."
4.0,"Really like the quality of the workmanship, the adjustable holster is a plus. I just wish this was a size or two smaller. I want to carry a gun not all of my worldly possessions! If the shoulder strap was adjustable like a belt, I could at least make it more comfortable under my arm instead of at my hip. If I decide to keep it I will probably try to get a buckle put on the strap."
4.0,The waist is high and quite snug. Couldn't go larger or it'd be a terrible fit. But it's a beautiful skirt.
4.0,shoe is full size short
4.0,"The charms are cute, but the bracelet is quite large and can't be adapted for my six-year-old's smaller wrists."
4.0,after several uses the integrity is still present.
4.0,The mask was beautiful but packaging sucked. The mask was bent up nd dented even broken in one place due to poor packaging ...i had to fix it without breaking it more. Had no choice but to use it for my event was the next day. It worked well enough after i fixed it
4.0,"the length is perfect for my tragus, helix and lobe piercings. they weren' t that hard to put on and I thought the piercings were very pretty"
4.0,I wear a 20 or under normally.  The 3x just fit. Very snug. Sleeves are VERY long
4.0,"I ordered two pairs of the capris to just wear around the house.  They are really nice, fit well.  Exactly what I thought i would get."
4.0,"I was hesitant to order these, thinking they might be too small for my earlobes or impossible to close if I could even get them on. Now I am glad I took a chance, because these fit perfectly and were literally a snap to close. They are attractive, lightweight and very comfortable to wear. I don't even know I have them on! I will be looking for more &#34;huggie&#34; type earrings in the future."
4.0,"I love this bag. It fits so much! I use it as a work bag and our looks professional while also having my style. The only reason it's not 5 stars is some of the fake leather came off on the seam. It's not something noticeable and doesn't effect the use but I would want to know that before buying. I would buy this bag again. As a vegan, the trade off of a side effect of fake leather is worth it to me."
4.0,"It was perfect. The beard was weird.  Fit was great, quite comfortable!"
4.0,"Ladies I am 5'8"" 135lbs size 34 C bra. I purchased a small and this dress fits perfect! It comes to just above my knees so I am not too uncomfortable sitting. The material is not scratchy at all. It has just enough give to scruntch it over my belly. The ONLY draw back is neither piece has any kind of tag on it to help identify front from back. I would purchase this again and I cannot wait to wear it on Valentines Day!"
4.0,Shipping was fast but it’s very loose on my wrist.
4.0,They are very nice for the price.... i paid like 2 dollars. They are pretty but I thought they would be bigger... my fault for not looking at the size. I do love the way they look but I expected them to be bigger and heavier. They were listed as being marked down from something like $20  so I thought I was getting this AMAZING deal but they are just costume jewelry and I wouldn't pay more than maybe $10 for them. For $2 they are wonderful!
4.0,"Was very comfortable and nice quality, but I thought the waist was too high.  It made me look bigger... and that’s not good."
4.0,Nice colors and  price was perfect.
4.0,"Also, if you have larger breasts, it is a little bit revealing of cleavage! But still so cute and would wear at the beach or something"
4.0,My photo tag came out beautiful and I love how personal it was.  I chose to use mine as a keychain.  It has gotten some wear and tear; the image scuffing slightly because of it jumbling with my keys.  Photo is still easy to see but I knew when I put it on my keychain I was taking a chance of the image getting scuffed up.  I plan to buy another as a gift for my mom.
4.0,"Love this dress! for size reference im 5'3 and roughly 165lbs. this dress is perfect fit, it does hang on ground a little but thats due to my hight, just wish the bottom was alittle more flowy its hard to tie up so it doesn't drag.  But i love how it hides my mom tummy. Color is exact and the fabric is more cotton"
4.0,"I got this for my little 4yr old girl got it in a 4t-5t. It fit great she looked so cute in it of course. It does look a bit like cheap material but still very cute little princess dress. It was long but short enough to see her shoes and so she would't trip. I was a bit disappointed with the color. I bought the pink colored one it was a bright bright pink definitely did not look like the soft pink one that is in the picture. I was able to iron all of it the mesh and under material with some trouble but the end product was nice. For the 1 and only time she would wear it, it did the job."
4.0,This is a really pretty dress. I love the fabric. It is a bit long though. It comes almost mid-calf on me.
4.0,I got a bigger size just in case which actually ended up being the true size. I recommend getting a bigger size than usual.
4.0,Love the style & fit of this dress.
4.0,I ordered a large and normally that's a perfect fit if anything on the loose side. I've also currently been loosing weight and this is still a little snug. It's good as a compression bra for me right now I'm going to keep it for my high impact workouts but probably will order a size up if I get more
4.0,The product came on time and was as advertised.  I don't think the black coating will last very long as it is already showing signs of wear.
4.0,They took awhile to be delivered. I order the wrong expected them to be bigger.
4.0,Love  it bought one for my daughter.  I wear a large but bought X-large looks great. Simone B.
4.0,"They are a little smaller than I expected, but they are lovely! so light, and beautiful!"
4.0,I buy these again and again but this one seemed a bit larger than usual.
4.0,"STUNNING dress!  Alas, it is too small in the chest for large-breasted women and FAR too short for leggy chicks. :(<br />The company, however, is wonderful, and they were VERY prompt to reply graciously and are making things right for me.<br />The fabric is SOOOO beautiful and the texture is lovely.  This dress would be perfect for a tall, leggy woman...if only it had about three or four more inches of length.  I have offered that suggestion to the company, at their request.  If you are short, slender, and with a small bust, this should fit you well. :)  For anyone thicker around the middle, this would not be a good choice."
4.0,Longer than expected but material and color are good
4.0,Beautiful  and the Crystal's are so nice
4.0,Nice set. The front area of the shirt doesn't appear to be sewn the best but so far it hasn't fallen apart and I have worn it  and washed it a couple of times.  Its not see through and the shorts don't roll up.  Overall a good buy for the money and is comfortable.
4.0,I'm a 90's girl so this pack was really fun.  I took off some of the tacky charms and put my own.  It's a great deal.
4.0,I don't like the backs
4.0,"Beautifully soft scarf. I deducted one star, however for the misleading color description. The color I ordered is called ""Milk"" but the scarf is actually a light butter-yellow. This is definitely NOT the color of milk so my daughter is unable to use it as a pashmina with her wedding dress.  Other than the yellowy hue., it is a  beautiful scarf."
4.0,"This set is adorable and it was comfortable for my little guy to wear for our whole event (where he got LOTS of compliments) Couple things... the shorts were a bit small. I have a tall 2 year old who is fairly thin. I ordered the 3t/4t size so the shorts would be long enough. The shorts definitely fit like a 2t around the waist. Also, the green coloring on the shorts rubbed off all over his diaper and parts of his thighs. It came off easily with a baby wipe, but was quite a bit of color runoff. I have a feeling these shorts will need to be washed separately a few times before being able to be put in with other clothes to wash. In hindsight I should have washed them before he wore them.<br /><br />Overall, good value and I will likely order other sets for events- I'll just size up! :)"
4.0,"I ordered this for a warm, light jacket for jeans.  Ordered a size larger, but still snug.  Very warm and comfortable.  Worth the price for sure. Quick and easy to pack in a small suitcase as well."
4.0,Very high quality for party favors.
4.0,"While these necklaces are pretty, the chains are shorter than pictured"
4.0,"I used these very small earrings for my second hole pearcings. Unfortunately,  I thought that they were of high quality enough to leave in permanently. After several months of wear, shower and swimming, the outer layer peeled off and look bad now. I guess I should have taken them out but FOR AN OLD LADY LIKE ME, they are very hard to put in by myself. They are very pretty, just douse them as an everyday earring imho"
4.0,First one’s chain broke...was cheaper and easier to buy a whole new one than to buy a replacement chain somewhere...needs a chain with a very thin clasp to fit through the cat’s paws.
4.0,Very cute but where larger then other shoes that are same size. Hopefully daughter can wear them in a few months
4.0,Nice comfortable sweatshirt.  Use around the house and keeps me warm
4.0,Love it! Fits great and looks like like the pictures!<br />I wore it Thanksgiving and everyone love it. Buying another for Christmas! 💃🏽<br /><br />Con: the stitching came a loose a little in the back after first washing but the variation in the print allows for easy fixing to go unnoticed.
4.0,"Nice shirt ordered as a gift. My bad on size, should have ordered 2xx. Don't know how it will wear."
4.0,"I really like them, keep my feet super warm"
4.0,I order the mix ones. You could have the option to choose the color that coustomers want
4.0,Bought this dress for Mother's Day. Fit great! I ordered a XL and I'm a size 14. The color is bright and it's very soft.
4.0,"My two year old wears 2t bottoms and 3t tops. I bought the 4/5small, thinking I'd have to cinch it, but it is actually almost too tight on her."
4.0,Much larger than I thought it was going to be.
4.0,The dress is really cute stretchy material very nice I purchased a size large which I usually wear. I should’ve purchased an extra large it runs a bit small
4.0,Recommend sizing at least 2 sizes up. I like this top except for the sizing.
4.0,"I’m around 150 pounds and I got this dress in a size large, here are my thoughts on it<br /><br />Pros<br />- The design is really simple but also really cute<br />- The tie and the space in the back is a really nice touch<br />-  it’s a little short but that’s what I wanted and it really hugged my figure<br /><br />Cons<br />-  Immediately I took it out of the bag, one of the straps broke and I had to sew it back on but it wasn’t difficult and considering how cheap the dress was I wasn’t too angry about the fact that it broke"
4.0,"Fits as expected, light weight, comfortable. I normally wear a medium since I prefer my shirts not super tight. I was a little nervous about getting this shirt after reading some of the reviews, but I also believe in you get what you pay for so I went in knowing this could possibly not be what I expected. Happy to say I was pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and I have received multiple compliments on the shirt every time I wear it."
4.0,This shoulders where a little weird. Part of the sleeves were tight. Which made the shoulders loose and fall down. I had to constantly keep reagusting. This picture is from after the date.  Boyfriend highly approved. Almost didn't make it to our reservation on time (:
4.0,longer than i expected and i didnt realize it was longer in the front and the back than the sides.  My husband says it looks like a nightgown. The material is super soft. I got it for family pictures but its a little too nightgown'ish for them so I went with another dress. I will still  wear this to work because it is comfortable but not as fitted and cute as I expected.
4.0,"The item was well made, however, size-wise I need a bigger size. So I sent it back.<br />My suggestion would be to recommend anyone who fits a Small to Medium, this will fit you fine.<br />Large or ExLarge, Forget it."
4.0,They are comfortable though I am glad I read the reviews and bought one size larger than my usual size.  They fit well and seem sturdy enough to last a few summers.  I'd buy 'em again.
4.0,"great for school uniform, although I wish the fabric was thicker."
4.0,"Cute earrings. I have a hard time wearing regular pierced earrings. The only downside was they really hurt after awhile, but they're great for special occasions."
4.0,"Cute dress! Received many compliments on it and can easily be dressed up for a special occasion or dressed down for a casual one. I love the ruffle on the end of sleeves, only drawback is that the sleeves are narrow, so they felt tight whenever I moved. So tight it left red marks on my arms. I ended up have to do a little altering to loosen the sleeves a bit, but now the dress fits perfect. I'm typically a size 16 and the xxl is what I ordered."
4.0,"These are less expensive than similar products on Amazon for a reason: they are both shorter overall and have a thinner ""hand."" These bear the number ""8108"" on the inside of the cuff, and are sized to fit up to approximately a women's size 8.<br /><br />I still feel I got good value for my money, because they were still in a size range that would fit me, but if you have larger feet, beware. Look for the more expensive version bearing the number ""9106"" on the inside of the cuff, which are 2"" longer overall.<br /><br />Overall thinner and 2"" shorter than similar socks bearing the number ""9106"" on the inside of the cuff, which are sized to fit larger women's sizes (9+)"
4.0,"I have a booty so, it was a little tight but not terribly. If I had gone up a size it wouldn’t fit. The breast and waist was good! I just didn’t like that, if front of my arm was a pocket of material. This is a sexy mom suit."
4.0,Fun necklace.  My daughter loves it!
4.0,"This item is comfortable, neat  and affordable. I will buy more 👍🏽"
4.0,Nice shirt. Runs a little small.
4.0,"I Love !!!!!!!!! this swimsuit adjusts your curvs in your body its a great fit .i'm 5'1 ,135lbs.. Cup size is a little small but other than that its a great swimsuit !"
4.0,It stop and go
4.0,"Very nice skirt. I was looking for a hobble skirt, so I had a tailor sow the slit closed. Regularly this is a very easy to walk in and comfortable long skirt."
4.0,"Purchased these for Easter photos . The large fit me OK, but it is a little form fitting on my stomach and hips, but great price and quality."
4.0,I like this product but some of the colors aren't that good.. for a full review you can click here! [...]
4.0,this product works great for antifogging.
4.0,The seams seem to be separating I. Some of the crotch and the striped ones are pilling pretty badly but they are worn often.
4.0,"I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it :). he has a large head too, and the xxlarge fits just right. the ear flaps are extra nice in the freezing cold weather here at school too! All around happiness: he has a hat that he likes and keeps his head warm, and I get to admire him in a rather handsome hat"
4.0,Pendants are a little bigger than expected.
4.0,"Really cute dress, but too big around on a petite 5’ 2” person. But, really cute."
4.0,Very pretty and great sparkle!
4.0,"Looks as pictured; made of high quality materials.<br />Plug-in part sits right near shoe tongue. Looks like it would be uncomfortable, but my son doesn't complain. Maybe if you have a sensitive kid, they would be bothered by it.<br />I was surprised my 4 year old could use the tiny button inside the shoe to change the LED display, but he could.<br />Fun lights; he gets lots of compliments on it and likes showing it off."
4.0,Great fit. Nice material. I would have liked for the neckline to be little bigger for a true off the shoulder look.
4.0,"Runs kind of small for a dress that you'd want to be loose, but it is really cute. Also beware it shrinks in the wash! size up"
4.0,they stretch after wearing them
4.0,Was the right color needed but the size does run small ... So I would say go up a size to fit comfortable
4.0,Perfect fit! Good colors!
4.0,"Very cute dress, color is true to the picture. I did return the dress as I bought a few of the same style. I decided I just didn’t need so many."
4.0,Super warm and snug. I work outside in the wind and this thing saves me every-time. Love it.
4.0,"These sunglasses are awesome, but I reported 4 stars because they don't fit me. I have a slender face, and I tried to gauge my selection by the product description's measurements, but they are huge on my face. I gave them to my daughter, who loves them and they look great on her."
4.0,This is very thin but nice
4.0,I like the fact that the size was listed correctly for US standards. Listed as XL US which means XXXL in China sizes.<br />The shirt has many untrimmed strings from the sewing machine. I will cut them myself but expected better quality from the supplier in that matter.
4.0,"The overall pendant is beautiful, although it looks stamped. The back has the letters YZ engraved in them, I have no idea what that means. The edges where the star overlaps with itself are a little worn. But whatever, I like what I got and am not going to return it. Theirs no point"
4.0,Great wallet for the money spent.
4.0,"I like this hat. It's a little bigger in circumference, not the fit but the hat itself. It's more of a fall/winter hat. I do like it but I probably wouldn't order another one. It is great quality of material."
4.0,Pretty but very small. Nice for a child.
4.0,Sleek and beautiful. My girlfriend gets compliments all the time about her watch
4.0,"Looks good although more shinny then expected, quality is ok for the price"
4.0,Really cute but the crossbody strap isn't big enough for larger individuals
4.0,Great little watch for my daughter. She loves it and it has fun games on it.
4.0,I really love this shirt. I am tall 6' and wear usually a M - L I ordered the biggest size in this and it is a great different type shirt! love the material :) must have. Just order two sizes up!
4.0,Very pretty and as expected. Only thing that is a &#34;con&#34; is that it is scratchy when it's on your wrist.
4.0,Ordered 0-6 Mo. Dress is beautiful but too big for newborn.
4.0,"Looks great , I am not sure about its performance ioutdoor."
4.0,"Ordered the shirts for me and hubby for Valentine’s Day. They’re super cute, the print looks good, and the shirts are soft. However, mine definitely ran small. I ordered a large for it to be a little baggy on me, and it ended up fitting like most medium shirts would. It was also a little short for my taste but it wasn’t anything bad (just more like a shirt shirt than a t-shirt). I recommend ordering a size up if you don’t want it super right. Other than that, we love them and thought they were a perfect girl!"
4.0,My son received these as a Christmas gift.  He seems to like them and the price was so much better than the Oakley he asked for. He likes the different lenses
4.0,"Like the shirt, didn’t like how it fit me (I’m a bit broader through the shoulders/back, so it was snug there and I wanted the front to be longer).  Meant to send it back, but I missed the window.  Fits my mom perfectly, however, so it all worked out...she says she feels very “beachy” when she wears it and that it’s her new favorite shirt..."
4.0,Fits well. Wish the v-neck was a little deeper. Well made.
4.0,cheap looking but still very cute
4.0,The rounded metal loops which hold the watch strap in place after its on tended to get in the way of my wearing it without discomfort. But the the durability is excellent.
4.0,"Lovely blouse, runs very loose, so size accordingly."
4.0,"This is a VERY cute dress. I was skeptical with the price when ordering and even taking it out of the bag (great packaging, by the way) I wasn't quite sold. But I slipped it on, and the fit was phenomenal - very flattering shape. I will say though, that I did return this dress... only because this particular style emphasizes the hips, and I'm somewhat pear-shaped. If you're more hour-glassed this will probably work for you. If you have more of a straight figure or are top-heavy, I would highly recommend this style - it'll give a more hour-glassed appearance.<br />I ordered a L/SZ 8, and my measurements are 38.5 chest, 31 waist, and 41 hips. I'm 5'6. Perfect fit. The dress was the perfect length as well - just above the knees to provide a sexy but conservative look.<br />Regardless of the style, I definitely think I found an affordable dress brand that I can feel confident in at my corporate job. The material is thinner, but being a Texas native, that is a huge positive! It's not sheer, and it's thick enough to disguise those little body flaws. Seriously impressed. Keep in mind that free returns are offered for some styles and sizes. What do you have to lose?! I will be looking for another style in this brand!"
4.0,This is super cute runs true to size
4.0,"The skirt is nice. I ordered a XS size, so I have a waist of 23 inches, and I was not mistaken. The skirt fit perfectly. I take off one star for the lock on the skirt, it is difficult to fasten it."
4.0,I was looking  for an alternative to the standard lanyard for my work keys. The bracelets are lovely stone and neutral enough to good with everything.<br /><br />In terms of fit the bracelets are  comfortably loose around my wrist. That does mean the keys can kind of bounce again and jingle. The band is not stretchy enough to put on your bicep to lock in place like  you might with the phone cord style key rings.<br /><br />The only real negative is that there were threads from the elastic cording sticking out in a few spots.
4.0,"I wasn’t expecting much for the price, but was pleasantly surprised with the quality! It fits perfectly."
4.0,Felt great
4.0,"This visor fits my K1 Defender well. Not too heavy, but it is thick and might be a bit warm for some. But it does the job with out looking too goofy. Seems sturdy."
4.0,"I bought this necklace for my grandson at Christmas, replaced the plastic shark tooth with a real one and he has worn it every day to school.  It was a big hit!"
4.0,"The black pair fit perfect, the grey are too small despite being the same size."
4.0,tight in the bust but I'm not exactly small chested.<br />super cute<br />made it nightgown
4.0,"Latch loose on one of the earrings, but overall great quality and fast delivery"
4.0,Myself as a professional boxer I have gave this item to my son as a early Christmas gift and he love it.
4.0,"This dickie arrived in good shape; the collar is a bit wonky -- kinda like there is just a bit too much material in it for it to lay perfectly, but it is still in an acceptable range. Love the plaid."
4.0,"These gloves are QUITE cute!!! :) Althou & havent yet worn the gloves out & about they seem very well made, very soft comfy leather. The reason I did 4 stars instead of 5 is the finger length is a bit long for me - I do have small hands but was hoping when the review said they fit snuggly they might work for me. My hands are 6&#34; 1/4&#34; & there is about a 1/4&#34; room at the end of all the fingers (size s) but then again most gloves are even worse on me. Also the bow over the wrist is looser than I expected but my wrists are 5&#34; 1/2&#34; probably a lil smaller than the average womans, other than that...the width of them fits great! They are really nice gloves at an afordable price....I can live w/ the wiggle room ;)"
4.0,Thank you very much!  My Son was very excited to get it and wear it on the Last Day of School!
4.0,"Purchased these sandals for my husband.  He loves them!  He had a toenail removed and needed a sandal with no toe coverage.<br />These are perfect, as his toes are free to wiggle.  Good quality leather, velcro straps run a bit large, but can be trimmed to fit tighter.<br />Heavy soles give added arch support and protection.  A good looking, comfortable sandal.  Would purchase them again."
4.0,Good but it's not going to fit if you have regular 18g ear holes. 16g should fit though
4.0,Watch came in good condition very cute and true to color. Sadly I have to return because the wristband is too big and the watch turns upside down and hangs off.
4.0,Need to replace my existing frames which broke after two years..still like the style. Relatively durable for such lightweight frames.
4.0,"We bought two of these watches for Christmas gifts.  Of the two, one had an immediate problem:  The pin fixing the band to the watch wasn't seated properly, so with one wrong jiggle of the watch, it came popping out (under spring tension).  Fortunately it was easy enough to find on our hardwood floor.  Then we tested the two watches.  One runs very well, accurate to within a minute per day -- not bad for $20!  The watch looks great and has a substantial feel -- very nice bling for the boy who will get it!  The listing doesn't tell you, but it's also self-winding and has a jeweled movement.  (Surprising!)<br /><br />The second watch didn't do as well.  No matter how much you wind it, it stops -- sometimes after 10 minutes, and sometimes after 3 hours.  But it stops.  That one is going back, to be replaced with another one.  Hopefully Santa's elves did a bit better work on the one we're receiving next.  ;-)"
4.0,"Did add warmth for skiing - was in 10 to 20 degree temperatures and had the gloves on medium, which helped keep my hands warm.  I'm concerned with battery life as soon as I turned the gloves to medium high they would die pretty quickly.  Going to perform some battery life testing."
4.0,I bought a medium... it was more like a small
4.0,"These sunglasses came before they were supposed to which is great! They did come with a little crack but it doesn't really matter to me. They fit on my head perfect and they don't come off when I put them on top of my head when I'm in a building, unless I bend down and pick something up, but no biggie. The only reason I gave these 4 stars is because of the tiny crack, otherwise they would be 5 stars! I recommend these knock-off Ray-Bans!!"
4.0,"I ordered this item august 5th and it came in yesterday (8/12) I was so surprised it came so quickly, considering it said between August 29-September 16 it would be delivered. It's pretty, just be careful because it is fragile! I can't wait to wear it to the beach or a night out!"
4.0,"I got this belt because I missed the ratchet type belts that I had as a child. This belt is comfortable to wear all day.  I also like this belt for when I want to carry my concealed carry firearm as it does not stretch and lose the fit through the day.<br /><br />The one issue I have is that the release in the buckle often gets hit when standing up or sitting down, which causes the belt to loosen unexpectedly.  Otherwise, it is a really nice belt.  If this didn’t happen it would be 5 stars."
4.0,"instead of crying saying its made in china be happy u got fr for 25 bucks what the hell do u expect, but black stallion is good for the price as well i work for hess and all u need if fr so for price u cant beat it"
4.0,The size 6 I ordered fit me perfect.  Use them for work all day. goes well with my dress pants.
4.0,"I would definitely go up a size. Otherwise, very cute and provides good support."
4.0,Really cute top.  Runs on the large size. I would order down a size.
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for. Fast delivery.
4.0,"Very warm.  Quality of the vest was not extremely great.  The zipper broke the first time I put it on and the neck part didn't work.  I sent the first one back as defective and the second one worked better, but still had some issues.  It keeps me warm though, thats what was important!"
4.0,These boots are great quality for the price! They look just as they do in the pictures.
4.0,Nice Boots
4.0,"These have a shiny look in the material once they are on you. They are decently comfortable and fit fine. They really hug your tummy though, so if you have a little chubby, don't get a size too small!"
4.0,"To me it looks like 18K gold. I even like the safety clasp. The clasp can be a little hard to close until you get the hang of it. you kind of have to align the clasp and then squeeze the bracelet just a tad, and the lock snaps in. I just wanted something gold to replace my silver bangles, which I have grown tired of, but I didn’t want to make an “investment”. I already have several real gold bangles and I don’t want to risk wearing them daily. This bracelet, for the price, is quite a find. That said, I can’t predict how well the gold finish will hold up over time, but after wearing it daily for two weeks, I see no signs of wear, and I am hard on my jewelry. I’m really pleased. I actually bought two, a plain one and a wavy one."
4.0,"Really cute, construction seems good.  They run a little large.  My granddaughter's foot slides around in them, hopefully she'll grow into them before the summer is over."
4.0,Clasp does not  stay in place. It continues to slide down
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter which normally wears a size Junior size Medium in Girls clothes, so this runs very small. It was snug but she was able to wear it. It's thin weight, but she liked it. The printing of the letters on the back of the shirt was also printed backwards."
4.0,"I wore it to a tailgate and I had tot be careful, because it kind of looks like a Cinco de Mayo shirt more than a fun, cute. summer shirt."
4.0,"Nice for the price, more of a spring/winter dress."
4.0,"This purse looks just as it does in the picture. It is beautiful and well made. The only thing I do not like is the gold chain shoulder strap. Thankfully, the chain is detachable so I am able to use the purse as an oversized clutch"
4.0,More cropped than I thought 😬 but still a cute shirt just need to pair with very high waisted pants. I’m 5ft1 125 pounds and I ordered a medium.
4.0,"If you're a light packer and need a carry on that will hold a few nights worth of clothes, a lap top, iPad, cables, and etc then this is the pack for you."
4.0,It's a great waffle type hoodie. It's more like a light long sleeve shirt. A little see through. But a great product.
4.0,Good belt but it is a bit tough to use. Very well made product!
4.0,Good vision and frame.
4.0,These are Asian sizes. They're not child sizes... before I buy anything online I ALWAYS look at the sizing they have to offer if it's going up to xxxl its probably for us Americans lol so I ordered one for me I loved it. Some of the thread started snagging but for that price what do you expect? I'm constantly having people ask me where I got it and I ordered my mom one as well. I would say go 2-3 sizes up from what you normally where and you'll be set.
4.0,"Me gusto mucho, un detalle ,Si su talla es M pida una L,"
4.0,Really cute crop shirt that I purchased for my daughter. Comes to the top of her belly button.  Image of the Cheshire Cat and style is cute. Ou'd order again.
4.0,"It has pockets!!!! Fairly nice material, love the material of the skirt."
4.0,Nice material and looks as good as pictured. It fits well.
4.0,"I was a little hesitant due to reviews but glad I went forward and bought the &#34;witch craft&#34; zipper jacket. The screen printing on it is perfect as a silk screener myself I look for that stuff. The fabric is a bit different not bad but it's almost like a fleece but not, yet still looks like run of Mill hoodie material? Perfect weight for mild fall temps. The hood is large but that was part of the appeal for me. I am 5 ft 3 and weigh 150 pounds carrying most of my weight in bust 34 DD. If you undecided I say go for it at the price point I find it to be of excellent value."
4.0,Nice lightweight summer gloves. I got these when I couldn’t find disposable gloves to wear while shopping. Very nice and lightweight. And I can wash them and reuse them.
4.0,"Got these as a gift off my wishlist from a friend for my birthday! Overall these bracelets are great for the price! Only issue really was that the thin gold one is black in areas, but it's easy to overlook."
4.0,"Hard to close, but beautiful!!"
4.0,"My hands get cold in the winter, even if it's not that cold inside, and I use these gloves to warm them up while I work on the computer. They're great for typing and they keep my hands from getting stiff. They've solved a real problem for me."
4.0,"I like the product!. Its very soft, warm and comfortable. Loved it!!"
4.0,"Its made out of either rayon ( - it says ) silk soft material, so it is lightweight and doesn't bother. I have been using this to double up on the covid disposable masks whenever the need arises and it is very useful. Highly recommend it."
4.0,"I’m 200 lbs 5’6 and wear a 42 DDD  and the XL was perfect fit, it’s a tad bit long but I’m sure will shrink up a little bit. But very nice soft fabric , shipping was fast. Good price"
4.0,Very nice for the price would recommend
4.0,"Overall it's a decent quality product. I am an average guy, it fits a bit tight"
4.0,"This is a great basic tankini, material seems high quality. The fabric isn't as bulky as other Miraclesuit tankinis, so it works great for petite women or women with a shorter torso. I'm 5'3&#34;, 148 lbs, 36DD, carry my weight in the middle and I fit into the 10. I might have even fit into the 8 so it was tighter in the chest area but didn't want to deal with sending it back and reordering - and risk it being too tight in the stomach. I think this would be too large in the chest area for someone who is much smaller than a C or D. It is fairly supportive, but doesn't seem like a typical Miraclesuit where it sucks everything in because of the fabric. But I liked the minimal fabric and it was long enough that my stomach looked flat. The double straps are really cute, just wish they were adjustable."
4.0,Very pretty dress and fits as expected. My only issue is the thin material on the bottom part if the dress. Its see through so would need to wear something under the dress. Got a lot of compliments about the dress. Would purchase in other colors.
4.0,"Fits good, easy to install.  It is however a little narrow than the apple watch bands.  We'll see how it holds up"
4.0,A couple of the plug came broken/chipped
4.0,Very elegant and classy.  The chain is a little flimsy but could easily be replaced.
4.0,Product was exactly as expected.  Good fit and my son loved it.
4.0,The 26-inch luggage had ample space for a 2-week vacation. Beware that the baggage conveyor check-in process can cause scratches and minor dents. I somewhat expected that to happen but they do provide clear luggage cover that might have eliminated this problem. The luggage seemed to have been built solid and will use it for many future trips.
4.0,La talla es fiel al tamaño es suave comoda no es strech
4.0,"Very cute shirt for the holiday season for those cozy moments watching Christmas movies.  The shirt runs very small.  I usually wear a L or XL in tee shirts.  Because I knew that this shirt would probably end up being a pj shirt or lounge wear around the house, I didn't mind if it wasn't the perfect fit.  I ordered a 2XL and it fits almost perfectly with a little wiggle room.  I am by NO means normally a 2XL size.  So the shirts are definitely undersized.  Make sure that you order at least 1 size up.  The shirt is a good quality fabric, not too thin and not too heavy.  I haven't washed it yet but it feels like it will hold up fine. I am actually hoping it will shrink up just a bit."
4.0,Love these earrings but you need to check them constantly... they work their way out easily.
4.0,"No complaints. Bought these for my girlfriend since she loves turquoise and lost a previous similar pair. The thing that stood out most was a very sturdy and attractive box, great bonus for gifting! Be advised the earrings are sleeved in plastic so be sure to open up first before wrapping these up if you intent to gift them."
4.0,I love this dress. It’s comfortable. I just had to tuck in a bit of fabric at the high waist in the front because I felt like I looked pregnant.
4.0,Good quality but as others say they run a size below standard.
4.0,Was very pleased with this dress. Material is very thick
4.0,I am 5'4 and 124 pounds and I ordered a small in these pants. They fit very tight. I would size up next time. The length is longer than I expected. It almost touches my ankles. The waist of the pants reaches just beneath my belly button. It helps tuck in the little pudge. The burgundy color is really beautiful.
4.0,Nice shirt! I ordered my size and it was a bit snug you may want to order a size up. Surprisingly the material was much thicker than I thought which makes it great for fall/winter.
4.0,It is very hard to decide a size to order
4.0,Little thin and tinny...
4.0,"Material is very soft, great for a toddler that is just getting used to wearing shoes."
4.0,Nice product. My son's hats don't stack as neatly as I'd like but that cou lmk d be him not the product.
4.0,"Great for working out, size up thou."
4.0,"If your bust size is a C cup then it fits a bit tight, but otherwise it is perfect, and that is why the four star rating."
4.0,"Cute holographic like design. It is cheap feeling but very light and comfortable. They aren't solid, but they haven't fallen out which is great."
4.0,Good for that price
4.0,I thought this item was a good quality material.  I am returning because it was too large but I would buy the next size down if it is in stock.  Very soft material.
4.0,"A little big for my nose ( I have small nose) but looks great.  Very light on the nose, which I love."
4.0,"This nose is pretty good the squeak was not what I thought but it’s still good ,  although the string digs into the sides of your head ."
4.0,"This is a fun version of a cowboy hat that's shiny, sparkly, multi-colored, lightweight and comes in exactly one size with no means of adjustment. So if it's too large or small, too sad! If you wear it anyway, it's light weight will allow it to fall or fly off. Keep it for use in limited situations and stay out of the wind!! It looks amazing though..."
4.0,"I chose my size based on the reviews. I am 5.4' and 135 lbs and a size medium fits perfectly. It's not very fitted, there's some room to move a bit (as shown in the pic). I love it. I didn't realize there were other colors though 😞"
4.0,It’s nice quality for the money
4.0,"Very pretty and unusual, it's nice for a gift  and you can wear it with any casual clothes, I love it ."
4.0,When I opened the package I thought I’d send it back.  The color of the print was much more melon-orange than the pink I had envisioned.  I went ahead and tried it on (fits true to size.  5’3” and 125 lbs wearing small) and is super soft.  I decided I could live with the color :)<br />This isn’t a sweatshirt-it’s more like a heavy long sleeve tshirt and the sleeves are like a soft legging type material.
4.0,"The sleeves are 3/4 sleeves not full length. I would give 5 stars if had longer sleeves (the picture was a bit misleading concerning the sleeve length). A little too sexy for work because I'm at a school, but great going out dress."
4.0,"Lace isn't as thin as I thought, decent quality. I would not was and dry each day. Not fitted , definitely enough room. I am large/XL and fits like 2x wich is great to wear over tank or as cover for swim suit."
4.0,"I read several reviews complaining about the difficulty of removing cards from the holder, but I will happily take the compact size and the ability to carry several cards over the large billfold that I was carrying."
4.0,"Very cute with splashy colors. I just wish they came left- and right-facing horses, hence my four-star review."
4.0,"Jacket runs small so I ordered an XL. A little loose but fine. rolls up into it's own pocket, great for Backpacking."
4.0,gorgeous dress but we measured and it was still just a little too big in the chest and back.
4.0,"This is a great large standard size backpack & lunchbag set. Can carry large books, notebooks, folders, etc. Very simple, one zipper for the large compartment of the bag and one zipper for small front compartment. Lunchbag comes with a little freezer pack & a plastic reusable water bottle is included. Nice, colorful graphic as well. My kindergartner loved it."
4.0,"These socks are very comfortable.  They are more for dress shoes, they also are good for low top sneaker' s. Your feet do now sweat in these socks. They also hold up very in the wash. I do not recommend these socks for boots because these socks only cover the bottom and the sides of your shoes. All in all, these socks fit well and fit up to a size 12 comfortably and easily so by them because fit very well when you need them"
4.0,"I love Alain Mikli glasses. Everything came intact. Unfortunately, this model did not fit the shape of my face. It was easy to return."
4.0,It's not the best material
4.0,"Today i received my Sunglass,actually it's great,i love it so much"
4.0,Perfect for what we were looking for. They were soft and beautiful!
4.0,Smaller than expected but good
4.0,The shorts fits good. But the top fits me like a sports bra. And I could have went a size down on the shorts only. I have a funny shape. Big at the top(large chested) and small at the bottom. Overall I'm very pleased. It's comfortable and cute. Thanks 😊
4.0,"I love the band.  It is pretty and more secure than a previous one that I had.  I would give it 5 stars, but the color is just slightly off.  Although the casual observer may not notice, but it does not match my rose gold watch perfectly."
4.0,i have been trying to use this. fits easy and doesnt bother me when working out but i just have to remember to wear it more often
4.0,I’m about 5’5 and 120 lbs the small was still too big for me but I made it work.
4.0,"Esta bien, solo el top está un poco pequeño la tela es perfecta"
4.0,I've worn the product once and fit good with a top that is not to snug.  Not too fond of the gray color and wish I could have gotten a different color in the hose as I have very few outfits this color will go with.  .
4.0,"It's comfortable, pretty color."
4.0,We had to order the size up what the size chart said but otherwise works great for our needs
4.0,Excelent from gift
4.0,I like the product. I normally wear a small but since I ordered for exercise I wanted it to be a little bigger. It runs small.
4.0,It’s a nice fit
4.0,"Let me start off by saying that I LOVE these sun glasses, I was in love with them before they even got to me.<br /><br />They're a much more ornate style than I typically go for, but I'm definitely not disappointed. I typically stay away from things that have ornamentation due to how typically they'll just fall right off.  Definitely not the case with these. Almost immediately after removing them from package my 1 year old ripped them off my face and tried prying off the roses. They stayed put. Sunglasses 1, baby 0.<br /><br />I also have to note that I was seriously skeptical over how sturdy these sunglasses would be for their price and if they would look different than pictured. Jokes on me, they're actually sturdier plastic than I have ever had on a pair of glasses and look ALMOST exactly as pictured.<br /><br />I can't tell if it's the lighting or the picture quality, but the recesses that define the rose and vines look deeper/darker or, more defined than they appear in person. Regardless,  it's a sincerely minor difference<br /><br />These are absolutely beautiful sunglasses and work really well against glare for me in the bright southern sun.<br /><br />I highly recommend these!<br /><br />* I was given a discount on this product for my 100% honest and sincere review."
4.0,"These jackets run large. I normally wear an XL because of my chest. This coat was big on me. I could have went down a size. Possibly 2. I seriously swam in it. The good news is, it is just as cute in person as it is in the pic. I ended up just giving it to a friend that is larger than I am."
4.0,This fit me perfectly and looked super badass. I love it.
4.0,Fits and wears well even after many washings.
4.0,"I am 5'4"" and almost 190 pounds. The XL fits just a little bit small in the elastic around the waist. But it is still basically comfortable.<br /><br />I think I will just remove the ties. They attach at the sides of your waist. With my curves, that bow would end up sliding up above my waistline. With my curves, I don't think I want to add a bow at the front as well. I never tuck in my shirts either so the bow would just add poof.<br /><br />The length is pretty good for me. With shoes on they'll be perfect. I can wear these around the house or as pajamas. I would also feel comfortable hanging out with friends in these.<br /><br />There is no tag in the back of the waistline. There is a tag on the left side. But this makes it challenging to figure out which is the front or the back. I think I will stitch in a bright bit of string in the back so it is easier to see which direction to put them on."
4.0,Really cool key chain.
4.0,Satin like fabric
4.0,"This dress fits as expected I ordered orange and blue. These dresses are very thin/ light weight. I rated this as 4 stars because it's see thru. This is a great summer dress, paired with some shorts underneath and a tank/cami top (cami is needed for the orange dress)."
4.0,The 40R US sleeves are just a breath too short (I have a 36 inch sleeve length) but it doesn’t look bad at all with the right shirt. It all fits quite well. The pants are even a slim cut which is rare in a suit of this caliber. I am quite happy with my purchase and recommend it. The fabric is polyester and has a high end costume shop feel but that’s expected at this price point. The colors are phenomenal.
4.0,"Following reviews I sized down one. It fits okay, and I won't bother exchanging, but if I were to order another I would actually size down two sizes. I'm normally a medium and a small was still a roomy fit. Not unflattering, but a bit looser and longer than I expected."
4.0,"I'm 140 lbs, 5'7 and I got this dress in a size medium. I love the color and corduroy feel of this skirt, its very unique. It's just really short and I hate the fact that it rides up so much when I walk because I don't wanna flash anyone but other than that it's a nice skirt.<br />Let me know if you have any questions or click the ‘Helpful’ button if you found this review to be helpful 😊"
4.0,"I've worn OTG shades for years &amp; these seem to be a good value for only $13. Thanks, Amazon Prime! The main lens is polarized but the side panels aren't. Side panels are a lighter tint &amp; blurry. Does blurry matter much for peripheral vision? The screws holding the lens to the hinge are ferrous (reactive to a magnet) so they may rust after a dip in the pool or ocean. The logos on each temple are also ferrous. Mine pried off easily with a fingernail to reduce weight by a trivial fraction of an ounce. Hinges are plastic. The bridge adjusts vertically, pressure fit. The rubber pads behind the ears are easy to remove...or to lose?"
4.0,Other than not being embroidered the hat is very nice.
4.0,"My husband usually wears a size large in sweatpants, as he is 6'4&#34;. However, we ordered a size XL in these, and they are still not quite long enough. He has to stretch them out while they're wet between the wash and the dryer. Other than the length, though, he loves everything about them, the color, the fit, the feel etc. Just beware if you are a taller guy or buying these for one."
4.0,"Works better than most of the bandeau bras I’ve tried in the past. After reading the reviews I went with the next larger size than my regular size and it was perfect. Not much support, but then I didn’t expect it to. It is very comfortable. Purchased this to wear after shoulder surgery so I wouldn’t have a strap over my shoulder. I was able to wear it all day with comfort and it did not feel like it was falling down. I had to shift the pads to be in the right place, but that is fairly easy. Overall, definitely worth the money."
4.0,These are cute and fit ok but for $8? They are fine.
4.0,i bought 2 of this and one of them last like 3 weeks
4.0,"I loved this necklace, I wore it everyday, but it started to get a bit faded on the side that touched my skin after a while.  I still really like it and would purchase again if it was still $10 as it was when I originally bought it.  I received a lot of compliments on the necklace."
4.0,"Loved the outfit, and so did he. However the apron was not in english, so that oeice went in the trash. I loved the rest of it."
4.0,"This is a good dress for the price! The material is thin, so it's a great dress for the fall or spring.  The color is spot on!  I got the teal dress is size small and I am 5'4 and 122lbs.  Fits great!"
4.0,The material is a bit see through but cute costume.
4.0,"This is a very comfortable dress, pretty lightweight, but ok for winter with some tights. My only problem is the color. Definitely not dark grey, it is heather grey, which is not a color I would normally wear to work."
4.0,"There are a little big for my face to my surprise, not saying that they fall off. Other than that, they're cool."
4.0,"Color just as pictured on website. I got the gray and pink. I ordered a small I’m 5’3 and 130 lbs. The inside sleeves are a little itchy, but not enough for me to send it back. I wore a tank top underneath."
4.0,Bought as a gift and my niece loved it. The packaging looked cheap so I put it in a nicer gift box but other than that it is nice for the price.
4.0,"Very nicely made, though the sleeves were longer than 3/4 length.  Fit well otherwise and comfortable enough to wear all day into evening."
4.0,Fits as expected. Just thin material. Not good for cold weather but ok for 60-70 degrees weather.
4.0,"I love this umbrellas because it is lined with a material that totally blocks the sun!  I always felt nerdy walking around with an umbrella, but this one is so cute it just makes people smile.  It is large and provides great coverage!  It's a bit heavier than a regular rain umbrella because of the sun blocking lining.  It opens and closes efficiently.  I wish that it would open with a push of a button, but that's just me being lazy...LOL."
4.0,pretty cool earrings for an &#34;animal&#34; themed night on a cruise ship
4.0,"I measured my waist and followed the sizing guidelines but the skirt is still a size too large. It's not exactly about to fall off but it's definitely loose and if I wasn't wearing a corset with it, I would need to have a belt. The fabric is very stretchy. But it looks nice and is perfect for my Mad Hatter costume. I'm not entirely sure where others are saying its adjustable - I have not found where I can adjust the length of the dress in the front. The only ""adjusting"" is where I decide it will sit on my waist before I put my corset on. The front is knee length and the back is about mid-calf. Shipping also came in sooner than expected, but I strongly suggest ordering well in advance. just to be sure."
4.0,Wonderful look exactly like the pictures!!
4.0,Dress seemed to fit a little big but we added a belt and it looked really cute!
4.0,"I have received so many compliments on this necklace!  It goes with almost everything and it arrived so quickly! I'm leaving only four stars because there was some flaking on the gold finish, but it's not noticable unless it's extremely close to your face."
4.0,"Used in my pool and loved them. No leaking, snig enough to keep water out but comfortable also!"
4.0,very simple wrap. Hard to find these that aren't a print or floral.
4.0,"The shape isn't 100% my favorite (I still really like them though), but Jesus these cannot be broken (and I've broken several Otterboxes)."
4.0,Worked well for a halloween costume and now my bf wears them to work.
4.0,I love the color and quality is really nice.  It’s not far from the expensive apple bands.
4.0,Great ski gloves
4.0,"Sturdy, good quality pin. Slight darker than my previous order of the same item."
4.0,"They’re super soft and I do like them but they sent me the wrong color. Ordered grey and received camo. Definitely thin, like in cold weather your legs would be chilly. But not see through"
4.0,"They color is amazing, but I've been spoiled by sunnies with larger frames. I used to have shades this size and I loved them, so I thought I would love these, but they're too small for me now. I don't like how they sit on my cheeks (my larger frames sit further away from my face) and they don't cover enough of my face. The color is so beautiful and the quality is really great, so I still recommend them! They're very chic!"
4.0,"this bracelet was such a beautiful gift from my grandchildren, the poem made me cry. - Tears of joy -  I wore it for a few years and noticed the finish was wearing off.  I am buying a replacement, because I love it so much.  I plan to use a clear coating to  help keep the bracelet looking shiny and new"
4.0,Beautiful jumpsuit; however I’m 5’9” and it wasn’t long enough for my torso.
4.0,"Very good materials , durable and excellent stitching. Runs a bit tight around the waist but not too much.<br />I’m a 6’1 and 207 lb well built wearing normally size 34 and it feels pretty comfortable. If you’re not lean go one size up"
4.0,Wore for a Thanksgiving 5K.  A little loose on a “normal” head but fit my husbands big noggin perfectly
4.0,"Good price, dainty, shiney, cute."
4.0,This is a lovely watch except for the band. Wore it twice. The hook on the band is not gripping anymore. Wish the company do a better job with that. Very disappointed
4.0,"I was a skeptic at first, but once I used these I became a believer.  There are 4 packing cubes- extra large which is good for jeans and pants; Large which is good for shirts; Medium which would be good for under garments, and a Small which is ideal for socks and misc items.<br />There is also a small laundry bag that can be packed away for use while traveling.  There is a small zippered pouch which is good for toiletries.  Each of the cubes is 4&#34; deep and has a dual zipper system so you can close it easily.  Each cube also has a handle so you could use them individually as well.  They would be great to send with the kids to the pool for wet clothes because there is mesh which allows for air flow.  The mesh allows the air to leave the cubes so they are compact as possible.  The material is made from 100% recycled polyester and that is important to me on a personal level.  The bags all nest into the extra large bag for easy storage when not in use.  I actually just keep mine in the suitcase when they are not being used so that I always know where they are when I am getting ready to travel.  These bags are well made and should last for years of travel and use,<br />Disclaimer:  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion and review."
4.0,I normally buy athleta or Lulu Lemmon yoga but I thought I would try these. Pretty impressed with the great fit (goes up high enough on waist but not too high) and pretty thick. Will buy more
4.0,"I bought another brand, due to my owl cap shrunk on warm wash, looks too wrinkled, and heavy cotton!  This brand fit n style is the same: no shrink, light cotton no wrinkle cap!  Super cute, satisfied!"
4.0,"This jacket is super cute, but it is way too big. I bought it in a size 6, which is my daughter's size, but I should've bought the 4/5."
4.0,"Kind of difficult to put on, but not the fault of the product. Was hoping it would be identical to the original thumb sticks, but they are slightly smaller and made a more durable and hard plastic. The difference is barely noticeable when the controller is your hands."
4.0,"Nice assortment of colors. They seem sturdy enough, and the price was right. But I can't believe, they packaged the two parts separately. Fortunately, my daughter was good at putting the metal rings onto the wrist bracelets."
4.0,I wanted to wear it over a dress but it's way too short
4.0,"Gave this Moonstone bracelet as a gift to my sister & she loves it. It’s well made & having the beautiful sterling silver adjustable size wrist band is great. Especially when putting, taking off & the ability to adjust how you want it to lay on your wrist.<br />My only reason for 4 stars is I wish the Moonstone was a clearer, less white & more colorful stone. In sunlight you can see more of the colors but I like to see them all the time.<br />I’ve purchased other Moonstone jewelry & some have more clarity & color but not all of them. I’ve also paid more when I’ve received the higher quality & colorful Moonstone’s.<br />With that being said, I’m still pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"Fabric is thin and lightweight making it perfect for summer weather. T-shirt laundered well and came out of the dryer without wrinkles. The snaps are not very attractive so I won't wear the t-shirt outside of the house. But, the functionality is great."
4.0,"Very solid wallet. I am very happy with it. It looks really nice and has tons of pockets for various things, probably a lot more than I'll ever need. In fact maybe too big. I was looking for a credit card today and thought I had lost it, but later found out it was in the ""Secret"" button down compartment in the front. There are so many places to stash things you can lose them in this wallet. If you are looking for a wallet that could almost double as  a purse, this is it.  Be aware that it is bigger than a normal wallet. I still carry it in my front pocket, but it is a tight fit. Be aware of the dimensions before you buy it to make sure you want something this large.<br /><br />Two improvements I'd suggest:<br />- Make a version of this wallet about 25% smaller. I love the style and features, but would gladly give up some of the ample space to make it a little easier to carry.<br />- Change the opening on compartment with the clear window so that it opens on the top instead of the side. It would be easier to get your ID out of the wallet if the opening wasn't on the side.<br /><br />Positives:<br />-Seems very well made and durable.<br />-Zipper and snap down sections are really handy<br />- If you can't fit all of your cards in this wallet, you have way too many credit cards.<br />- US currency fits very well in billfold section with a bit of room to spare, which has two compartments.<br />- Cow logo (I think it is a cow) is a cute touch."
4.0,"I saw T. Hardy Morris wearing some heart-shapes and I was convinced I needed some. These are a little tight on the face, but serve their fun purpose all the same."
4.0,"Fits well. Arms a bit tight, but it doesn't bother me."
4.0,Didn't like color on me
4.0,"Beautiful pattern and color. The stitching around the top is a bit funky but not noticeable when wearing. I’m 5’6, 145, 41 years old and the large fits but it is tight. I could have probably went up one size. Hits right below the knee. Looks super elegant and sexy. I got the blue color and it is not at all see through so not sure what the other reviewers meant by that, maybe there were other color options. Would buy again."
4.0,"I'm a true size 14,  40C, and the large was perfect for me. I really liked the material. I didn't really like the extra material hanging in the front area like flaps. The cardigan would've been perfect without that extra material."
4.0,Pretty piece of jewelry.
4.0,Good ventilation for those of us with big heads.
4.0,"they are comfortable,  but very cheap looking.  okay for home and walk the dog."
4.0,Like the purse and different pockets. The material is great.
4.0,"I love the skirt, could be a smidge longer.  The only downside is the Velcro catches my shirts."
4.0,I'm 5'3 inches 128 pounds ordered small it fits great.
4.0,This came as promised and my friend will love it!
4.0,"I think this is a perfect flouncy style skirt, that is light weight...perfect for the beach."
4.0,"Gave as a gift, she loved them! Very beautiful. recommend them to whoever loves rubies for a very good price!"
4.0,Very comfortable. Love slim straps instead of wide. Need more colors.
4.0,"I read reviews that the suits are a little big, and they are. I wear a large size shirt and this fit more like a 3XL - the neckline falls off my shoulder easily. We wore corresponding colored shirts and pants and I think that helped. If you are a last minute lucy, this is still a fun costume to wear."
4.0,Excellent quality. Very professional
4.0,"These are nice little keychains. Sadly, the images are stickers on the outside of the plastic, rather than inside, but so far, the stickers have proved very durable and have not experienced any scuffing in spite of lots of use."
4.0,"It was a great deal for the shirt! Don't expect it to be good quality, but it works for its purpose. Order size up to ensure good fit."
4.0,Watch is awesome however no directions on how to remove links to make it smaller.
4.0,"This dress is very cute in person. It fit as expected for the most, and the fabric is a nice quality. The only downside is to how the high-low is made. The bottom is a square, so that makes the dress long in the front and back and short on the sides. Also, the material is flowy, so a good breeze will blow the dress up, so wear shorts underneath."
4.0,"This shirt is cute! It’s a little baggy in the armpit area, I got an XL and could have gotten a L. I have a long torso and the length is pretty good.  The material is somewhat thin but not see through."
4.0,"My daughter loves these earring backs.  She has a yellow gold pair and now a white gold pair.  She is 9 years old and says they are easy to sleep in.  They stay on well, but come off without much difficulty when you want also."
4.0,Awesome Case!!
4.0,"Love these, this is my second purchase on these. I bought them my my lol trendy bro after he admired them in my hubby from last year. If you are between sizes go up a size for sure."
4.0,Comfortable and sexy. The cleavage area is open and gives a hint of sensual and sex appeal.
4.0,Fit great at first. Some colors would shrink after use while some wouldn’t. Still good for the price.
4.0,Not  Great but well worth the price.
4.0,I like this ring I wear it with other rings.  It looks as good as My expensive rings.
4.0,"Love it, quality fabric, beautiful print and bright colors , wish it came in sizes instead of one size fits all ."
4.0,It’s a nice necklace.  The chain is short though
4.0,"For the price, ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT! The sleeves are sewn on very minimally so my sleeve came off the first time I put it on, but nothing that a little needle and thread couldn't fix! It certainly hugs my arms more than the image provided."
4.0,"This is a very beautiful dress, when you take it out of the package you really get to appreciate the full affect of the pattern of the flowers and the flowing style of the dress itself.  It has many details that make it special like the way the material drapes and the three quarter sleeves have a tie on the ends.  I also like the v-neck. I did find though that it was a little snug in the bust for the size.  This dress can be worn to many occasions such as the beach, to a shower or even into the office.  I wore mine to Church.  I would recommend the dress for anyone and it does have a good price and it comes in other colors."
4.0,"This is my first time to be brave enough and purchase a butt lift underwear. First off, the seller is great, the item was shipped fast and arrived in good condition. I did not follow  followed the size chart and ordered one size up, which was accurate. The panties weren't difficult to put on and were surprisingly comfortable. They also seemed to be good quality.<br /><br />Now for the bad part.  I bought these with confidence. All it did was cause MAJOR spillage, and I mean major. This product was intended for women that already have a FIRM bum but are looking for a little more lift or &#34;oomph&#34;. If you have a jiggly butt whatsoever, save yourself the time and money!! This was not at all designed to cheat your way into a nice butt!<br /><br />This review has nothing against the seller or product itself, it's just my own body shape and how it translated through these panties. Maybe after several months of squats and lunges my bum might be firm enough to use these, but for now they are banished to the darkest part of my closet.<br />I got this item discounted to test and review."
4.0,"I was looking for slippers to wear around the house that would give proper arch support, but would be easy to put on and take off.  These were exactly what the doctor ordered.  They're great to wear around, provide good support and are very comfortable.  They do get a bit warm if you wear them for long periods of time, and if it's really dry, they can cause a bit of static, but otherwise, no complaints.  I do like that the sides of the slipper can be adjusted via Velcro to make the shoe tighter or looser as necessary, so it easily accommodates all sorts of socks.  In fact, I liked these so much, I bought 2!"
4.0,TruTread  Non Skid socks are so much more stylish than the Hospital issued non skid socks.  These socks are nicely made.  I bought them for my elderly mother and she loves them!  She is very pleased with the warmth and feel of them and remarked on how she could where  them outside of the house and no one would know that they were non skid on the bottom of the sock.
4.0,Very clean and adjustable.
4.0,Inexpensive looking but cute.  Meets my need for high school senior golfing student.
4.0,Bought them before my trip to Mammoth Mountain. Gloves were a bit small but overall worked great. Left my hands warm and dry through a whole day of snowboarding.
4.0,It is sturdy and good quality. Looks exactly like the photo! Only problem is that it was a little wide.
4.0,Put your own inserts and it can be used as a shoe.
4.0,"Definitely order a size up. Other than that, decent quality for what I paid."
4.0,bigger than showing
4.0,I like these legging I'm 210 5'7 and they fit well on me and are thin but not see through. They do stretch out a little but not enough to be falling off or anything. I love the skull and roses theme too!!  I would recommend these to a friend.
4.0,"It's very pretty but the elephant is VERY tiny, I thought it would be larger"
4.0,"This product does what it intends to do, which is to act as a durable RFID wallet. For anyone with a handful of cards who wants something more protective, this is the route. The problem is that it is built to hold 8 cards. With some luck, you'll squeeze in 12. I need a wallet or card holder that can easily fit about 20 without being too bulky for my back pocket, so this is not an ideal product for me.<br /><br />  That being said, this is not a problem with this wallet alone. I've been wanting a card holder that fits my criteria for a long time, so this does not stand out as a problem. If you want something that holds a small wallet's worth or a secondary wallet, this is ideal."
4.0,"First Impression<br />Edgy and dainty!  Came in separate plastic baggies.  Not tarnished.  Love these.  So cute!<br /><br />Quality and Would I Buy Again?<br />I would love it if they came in even larger sizes.  I would definitely buy again.  You can't beat 15 bucks for 3 pairs of earrings.  I've seen earrings (a little larger) in places like Macy's charge $100 for one pair.  Okay and yes, I've paid it but those were a little thicker and a few inches longer and solid silver.<br /><br />Cons<br />The only draw back is that they need to come with those little silicone/rubber pieces that some earrings come with to keep them from coming out of your ear.  I &#34;lost&#34; one earring three times the first day I wore it, but I guess the earring angels were with me and I found it every time.  I now only wear these earrings with stoppers from a different pair of earrings.  Because they are transparent, they don't take away from the minimalistic styling of the earrings.<br /><br />Shipping<br />I ordered on Dec 10 and received on Dec 18.  No complaints."
4.0,"Runs a little big, I don't mind tight and form fitting, just wish it didn't show so much cleavage.  Should have sized down."
4.0,Not best quality but super cute for summer sunnies for the price.  I was able to have fun doing summer water sports and not worry about ruining them.
4.0,"These socks come beautifully packaged in a lovely gift box and each sock is individually wrapped. They are very soft, moisture wicking material.<br /><br />But, the length is a little odd.  They are not ankle socks and they are not crew socks either. They are positioned in between!<br /><br />They are made of cotton and feels very soft. They keep your feet dry, cool, and comfy. Machine washable and dry quickly.<br /><br />Great pair of socks if you are okay with the unusual length.<br /><br />Summary:<br />(1) 97% Combed cotton/ 3% Spandex<br />(2) Chitosan is blended in the yarn to provide anti odor effect<br />(3) Relieves athletes foot<br />(4) helps to get rid of embarrassing smelly feet<br />(5) “Y"" shaped deep heel pocket ensures sock fits the contours of the foot<br />(6) seamless/reinforced heel and toe<br />(7) breathable and lightweight<br />(8) keep your feet ventilated and comfortable"
4.0,"A little small, but nice material, soft and comfy.."
4.0,Very well made and constructed. Just wish it was a tighter elastic around the waist.
4.0,"This is a comfy velour set but it is more form fitting rather than loose fitting.  I got it in my usual size large and while it fits, it is snug.  I have other clothing items by this brand, all in size large, and this velour set has the tightest fit out of all of them. It looks nice on me and is flattering but if you prefer something not quite as form fitting, I would go a size up. I have an average to maybe even below average size rear end for a woman and if mine was bigger or my upper thighs were bigger, I would definitely need a larger size.<br /><br />I'm 5'6"" with a long torso, and short legs. The only thing I don't really care for is the cuffs on the pants.  It just looks weird because the velour kinda poofs out a bit before the cuff starts.  But that's being pretty nit picky as this is just something I am going to wear to lounge around the house.  The bottom part of the pants might be an issue for shorter women.<br /><br />Overall a good set if you want something comfy to wear. I washed according to instructions (inside out, on cold, and tumble dry low) and it came out just fine. The set also comes with Proposition 65 warning labels."
4.0,This polishing cloth has worked well on a flute and metal parts of a banjo.  I would purchase this again.
4.0,"The small band is a little weird, but they are soft and work otherwise."
4.0,Good item to use with my shades and keeps them secure around my neck.
4.0,Great looking and good quality for the price.<br />Only downfall is it was not true to size as jersey is snug. I would order a size bigger than normal. I wear a 2XL and wish I got 3Xl.
4.0,"My daughter loves this purse, though I took a star off because it is very small inside."
4.0,Well I have a few pairs of muck boots so I do like muck boots .... this pair are heavier then the others.... I like the wide cafe part but I like my others without it so not a big deal some people say camo scratches mine haven't done that as of yet but dont really care if they do it's about the protection not the look ... first day using I thought they were to stiff but 2nd day they were fine..... I got these boots for a few reasons mostly cuz they say good to -50 below I was hunting in plus 25 and my feet did get cold just sitting once up walking around they were great but sitting not so great.... witch we all know that feet get cold sitting but I was expecting these boots to limit that cuz of its rating of -50 but still a great boot just got to be moving or put insulted boot leaves over them as u would other boots
4.0,"Not exactly clear - more like a soft white. They do work, but I wish they were REALLY CLEAR... It is also a bit of a hassle to have to re-hook these behind your ears when you take off your glasses (as I do, to switch between reading and regular ones). But there's really no way around that, since they are ""ear grips"". I am going to try the temple silicon strips as an alternative, though."
4.0,"The color and style of the boots are amazing, but I have wide feet so I was unable to fit my foot into a size 9 which I usually wear.<br />If you have wide feet or bigger calves then I would suggest ordering a size bigger."
4.0,"relieves leg cramps legs are not so tired after long day. really, really tough to get off."
4.0,"Island vacation dress, a little tight on sleeves otherwise good buy"
4.0,gift for my granddaughter..won't know until she gets it for xmas..
4.0,"as the items are good and made as keys would have been maybe 150 years ago , some are to large for what I do with them. I make necklaces for gifts . Hopefully the next order I will get  more small ones"
4.0,Bag it's great for the price but after reading other reviews I thought it would be bigger. It's about the size of a hand bag with shoulder straps.
4.0,"Love this, I wear it all the time. The white is my favorite. The dark blue has faded a bit already, but still fun to wear."
4.0,"Weird material. Going to try to make it cute tho for 10$. Usually wear an 2x, ordered an XL fits good"
4.0,expected it to be small so I ordered a larger size... glad I di . Cute and a flattering  fit
4.0,Perfect for a classy liner in flats.  Perfect to prevent sweat stains in your shoes.
4.0,LOVE THIS DRESS! I got so many compliments and it has pockets!!  Very comfy and cute.
4.0,"I only gave it **** because the dress<br />was so badly wrinkled, very disappointed<br />about getting a dress with so many<br />wrinkles, but I will probably keep it<br />because it fits really good."
4.0,"These shoes are super soft and flexible, but runs very large. They are also super cute!!!"
4.0,This bag is so adorable.  The only thing I don't like is how small it is.  My daughter is only 2 so she's tiny everything will be able to fit.  Love this bag .
4.0,"Overall, I give these a 4 star for a few reasons.  First off, I love how light weight they are. It honestly feels like they are not even on and they don't irritate my ears like most earrings. I also like how I have the option to just wear the first piece alone or add the second piece for a fancier look. Additionally, the company included an extra set of backings just in case the others get lost.  So, overall these earrings are pretty and I'm happy with them.  Now, there are two reasons why I didn't give them a 5 star. One was because even though they are pretty, you can up close that they are kinda on the cheap side. Second of all, they were really hard to put on. It took me a long time just to get these beauties on and I ended up just having my husband help me. If it wasn't for those two things,  I would have definitely given them a 5. I did receive these earring for a discount in exchange for an honest and unbias review."
4.0,Gift for my grandson and fits like a glove
4.0,"The quality and material are excellent , but they definitely run small ; so I recommend buying a size up at least .  Even up one size this time didn’t work for my daughter ; so we had to return them - which I did get a prompt refund for .<br />Prior to growing out of them , these were her favorite , most comfortable pairs of panties and I hope I can find a similar one that fits her ."
4.0,"I ended up having to go a size up on these. I typically wear a large, however that was a bit too small for me. I fit, but not comfortably per se. However, the flat colored ones seem a smidge stretchier than the more decorated pairs. Overall, though, I ordered an XL which should fit. In some cases, I've needed to do that, but the XLs end up fitting perfectly. My dimensions at 6'1&#34; at 162 lbs with a 33&#34; waist and a 38.5&#34; bust for sizing panties. I advise ordering a size up unless you're on the very low end of a size bracket, just to be safe. These do have some stretch, but not as much as other materials. They are suuuuuper cute, though!"
4.0,I’m a bit disappointed.  They don’t fit my wrist.  I am wearing the larger size band that comes with the watch.  These are too small.  I gave them to my daughter who has my old series 1
4.0,It looks just like the picture very pretty. Except the it's hard to put on. The silver part is not very flexible. As the other ones I purchased.
4.0,"Material could have been a better quality, but for the price, it's fine.  I love the style and fit if this track suit!"
4.0,I really like these sunglasses...but I got it for less than a week and one of the nose pad came off and lost it... If there is a way to replace it I would give it five stars. But I'm very sad and disappointed in this.<br /><br />UPDATE* they had gave me a full refund after I posted about the lost nose pad and they were very nice and patience with me. Thank you again for being on top of your customer reviews!
4.0,"The material is nice and thin, should dry fast. Runs a bit small though."
4.0,"Beautiful, soft material--almost like velvet so does not hold you like other No Nonsense pants.<br />Runs larger than other jean leggings I have from them."
4.0,Looks nice. Almost 9 dollars for shipping and it was shipped with something else.
4.0,cute mud boots!
4.0,"This is a very cute exercise bra and it works good for medium to low impact exercises. If you have large breasts it wouldn’t be a good choice for high impact activities. Also- the color is not quite how it shows. It’s not a bright sunflower yellow, it’s almost a Dijon mustard color."
4.0,"These ties are lovely, especially the red one, but they are a little too thin for me"
4.0,These socks were just as cute as the picture! I love the thickness and they wash up nicely. They are a printed fabric so the image is stretched when wearing them.
4.0,"These bands are soft, comfortable, and easy to adjust.  They don’t get slimy with sweat like the silicone bands.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the “pink/sand” color band is not pink, it definitely looks more like sand or a tan color."
4.0,"It may be because they are too big for me, but I do not like how these look. The cuffs hit me at the bottoms of my ankles and they are very very loose. if I try to pull the cuffs up, they will not stay put. I do not have particularly small calves, I am usually a 2x and I would need to buy wide calf boots ~30% of the  time. These are fine for pajama pants but this size literally falls off me and looks strange with the leg shape."
4.0,"Tangles easily, but great colors"
4.0,"This is a nice, lightweight dress.  I got the white and wore a long slip under it as it is pretty sheer."
4.0,"Super comfy.  Very soft.  A bit big for me… I am 5'7""  and usually size 12-14 and ordered xl. Should have ordered large instead"
4.0,Very comfortable and nice material. Looks good with heels or flats!
4.0,"They look good, wash good and are soft but they don’t absorb milk great !"
4.0,Can't make a 100% assessment since I still haven't used it but visual and tactile inspection says well made.  I reserve the right to add a star once it gets put to the truest test.
4.0,"Odd color. Swirls kind of reminded me of mucus, like when your sick."
4.0,The design and craftsmanship is superb. Irs Jima and Tun Tavern are iconic to all Marines. My only negative comment is that the sizing runs about a quarter size small.
4.0,Please bring back. I would love these.
4.0,"So cute!!!! Runs small though so order 2 sizes up. I wear a size 4 pants and ordered a medium, it’s too small."
4.0,"Color says wine but is more on the maroon side. I was expecting it to be more on the purple side of wine, but regardless still pretty."
4.0,I can fit my water bottle and my ipad. It's a great little backpack for traveling!
4.0,They are very soft I no that there on size fits all but they are a little loose in the waist I were 8 in jeans but very comfortable.
4.0,"A couple of bare spot. For someone new to wearing a wig, probably need instructions on how to use the tightening straps. Someone showed my halfway through the day, but the first half was not fun."
4.0,"It was a hit with grandson, these pj's are cute and fit well."
4.0,This is cute but almost too small. A lot of pockets but my cell phone won't fit with the case on. Durable and worth it but just pay attention to dimensions.
4.0,"I got this for my daughter-in-law to celebrate 4th of Jily. She's 5 months pregnant. It looks darling on her.  Fits well, and is very comfortable."
4.0,"Let me start by saying that I have a fat neck. it is very difficult to find a shirt that fits well. if the collar fits, the rest of the shirt is a circus tent on me. if the rest of the shirt fits, the collar is usually way too small. These even out the playing field and make wearing collared shirts bearable again. The only cons are that if you have a beard, they can pull out hairs on your neck and it hurts. also, it is pretty easy to tell if someone is wearing one. neither of those are enough to stop me from using them. In almost 6 months I have had to get rid of 2 because they became stretched out."
4.0,"beautiful dress ran a little big for me. I reordered it in a size smaller , YAY!"
4.0,Great product and arrived on time.
4.0,"I really loved this dress.  I ordered it in a Small and Medium; the Medium fit a little better in the arms.  I did, however, return both of them as the &#34;medallions&#34; that show up by the shoulders in the picture actually land right on the breasts."
4.0,"These are comfortable and generously sized. The fabric of these black/peach/pink floral shorts is much thicker and softer than the same product in the blue color, which I also ordered. The blue shorts were of thinner and stiffer fabric. I still like the blue ones, too, though.  These aren’t flattering. They’ll make your hips and butt look 10-15 lbs heavier, but, they are really comfy. Great non-sexy jammy shorts, house cleaning shorts, knock around comfy shorts. They don’t make me feel thin or sexy; but they sure are super-soft and comfy."
4.0,"Color is not pink it is tan/light brown.  If you have a fuller bust, you might have to order up.  The bust is made a little small but &#34;just&#34; fits on me."
4.0,work fine ok
4.0,"Very nice skirt, a bit big like fluffs out! If you like that look then this is a perfect skirt!"
4.0,I like the headband jus didn't like Nike sign jus came off
4.0,"Nice packing , light weight jacket. I felt the size is a little smaller than expected. But otherwise looks same as in picture and has cute little zips for the pockets."
4.0,Very light weight. I wear a size 8 1/2 shoe and they are almost too small.
4.0,"I love those shorts, I gave it 4 stars just because the rips were not that even but the way it fits is great. I recommend it."
4.0,A little hard to clip in but after a while they went in. Photo is of the medium size.
4.0,Good for the money.seen others @ stores less quality for about the same$---_some times have to try many different shoes but these fit right away
4.0,"The shoe seems to be made of good quality product. I love the color, but they do seem a little snug across the top of my foot."
4.0,I found the band to be a bit stiff and inflexible.  It is well made.  I ordered a 16mm and it barely fit  through the little pins. It was a bit wide  - it did arrive quickly.
4.0,"So so soft! I'm 5'2&#34;, pregnant, and already chunky before hand..so leggings are my only pants tbh. Only problem is there needs to be a &#34;short&#34; option, the waistband goes all the way up to my chest, with a wider waistband it'd be better to fold them over. I'll make due tho, bc they aren't in any way see through, and the softness...worth the $13!"
4.0,"the fabric was too dark and rude.<br />Really good confection, and look amazing. I like it!"
4.0,This cute is super cute however it is cut. A little weird - u can see bra where the cut out out begins - solution would to be make draw strings fighter to oull  it down
4.0,"Just because it fit, doesn't mean I love it. I'm 5'3&#34;, 36D-32-43, and based on reviews I bought an XL in Apricot. There's nothing technically wrong with this. It's a pretty good length at only a couple of inches above my knees, and the back is mid-ish calf. I just didn't feel it did anything for me. I'm in the process of trying to lose weight (4lbs down, 11ish to go), and I don't want anything shapeless on me that may become more shapeless later, even if it is semi-sheer. It's not a bad material, and probably looks better than I think. I imagine the sheerness could be considered sexy."
4.0,Dress fit as expected.  Was delivered in a timely manner.  Loved the color and the fabric.  Very comfortable and pleasing style.  Is a little stretchy so there is some give to the material. Loved it and will order from them again.
4.0,Nice nice excellent I like
4.0,It's a tux shirt.  White with pleats.<br />Maybe a little loose around the neck (or maybe I'm too scrawny).<br />Nice price.
4.0,"i love these! i don’t ever really go in the water at anywhere, whether it’s a pool, the ocean, or anything else.<br />however i tried them on to make sure they’d fit for when a friend comes back from out of state, he has plans to get me into a pool this summer, lol.<br />i general have small measurements except for like, length? my waist is roughly 26in, so i was barely able to get away with getting the size that fits “9/10yrs”. My thighs are a bit disproportionate to my waist and made them a bit hard to put on, but otherwise the swim shorts fit really well! i’m very happy with them. the fabric is nice, and the color is good as well! my phone screen is dark, so i was expecting the red to be a lot more dull. but, it’s a bit brighter— i still love it!<br />very grateful that it’s a drawstring and not elastic or just a button for closure, typically once swimwear gets wet, it just immediately falls off of me.<br />they sit at a good spot on my waist, and the inseam is a good length as well, not too long but not too short (for reference, i usually order a 28x36 for jeans— my legs are really long)<br />i plan on ordering a size “11/12yrs” in the future (especially since i think i might gain some weight between now and then)<br />before i forget, i should probably mention that there’s also a separate mesh part on the inside! i don’t have a problem with it, but if you or your kid feels uncomfortable with extra liners, take it into consideration. i used to be that way when i was younger and my mom was always so mad whenever she got me that stuff and i threw a fit because i didn’t like the way it felt.<br /><br />overall? matches pretty well to its size chart, i like the fabric, and i’ll leave an update after multiple uses!"
4.0,"I'm petite and wear usually small sizes, so this fit fine, it might fit a medium size, depending on how tight you like it. I like wearing it with dresses or long blouses etc. It's a nice touch."
4.0,This are roomy shorts but fit well.  As described they are not just above the knee shorts.  These are mid thigh shorts.  Great for running and jogging.  For the money I would definitely recommend these shorts.
4.0,So pretty! Wish it was larger....clasp could be sturdier.
4.0,The watch looks well the band is a little small it barely fit me and my mother who has a small wrist over its cheap and a clear watch I was looking for.
4.0,"Perfect chiffon scarf!  I like how long it is, I'll be ordering more colors!  You do need to wash at first, does have a funny smell"
4.0,"It is very comfort, fit me perfectly, will buy it again"
4.0,"Fits beautifully. Style is very flattering and the fabric is just so cool and comfortable. My only complaint is that the color is not as shown. It's more beige than mocha, which although also pretty, is a little disappointing."
4.0,"I agree with all reviewers here. Yes, it does look like a preschooler painted it, but I don't care about the paint job. Fact of the matter is I'm African American and this wristband lets people know where I originated from and to represent Africa. Besides, nobody really gets that close to notice the paint. You have to be really close, but then you would be invading my personal space. I like it. It fits, looks good, and shows what I represent. It was overall worth it. I can swim, exercise, bathe, even work with it on. I approve."
4.0,"Works as it should, the only reason I didn’t give it five stars is because of the shoulder straps. I don’t care for them because they are too thin and need the be stronger in my opinion."
4.0,Simple watch for work. Like it and glad it included a tool.
4.0,ITS CUTE. CAN'T TELL THE BACK OF THE TOP FROM THE FRONT. LOL. SOFT MATERIAL.  I ORDERED TWO OF THE. LIKE IT.
4.0,I don't know if I like the sleeves
4.0,"It's perfect,  just right size and I like it,  it's great for women how wear hijab to covering the chest and neck."
4.0,It is underwear what more can you say.
4.0,Quite nice for the price! I'm 5'9 and 175lbs. Typically I wear a 10-12.  XXL fit very comfortable.
4.0,Slightly sheer if worn at all snug
4.0,I like this set but I burn up in this fleece material..  can't wear it to bed because of it.
4.0,"The color, the fit, the texture was great. Will definitely buy this prodcut again."
4.0,They're perfect! I can't wait to wear them on a night out. I love that it's not hard to get in and out of them. Love the material and the zippers!
4.0,"Right fit, I like it overall of this than $100 plus priced other brands."
4.0,runs small but I like it!
4.0,These fit nice an snug ive worn them a few times already an they are still in tac
4.0,Just what I thought it would be. Gets the job done.
4.0,"Was very pleased with this item.  Picture does not do it justice, very cute."
4.0,Cute. Well made except one garter was shorter than the rest. Don't bother with the thong unless you are tiny with no butt. Really small but I just wore a red one I already had.
4.0,These tend to slip off after time but work alright for the first few wears.
4.0,"I had really high hopes for this set! But there is no removable padding like it said in the description (which was what I like in my sports bras). Other than that, its super cute. I’m a 32B, usually in small (2-4) everything and I ordered a small. I just returned it cause I wanted removable cup pads."
4.0,"If you place your mouse on the bottom of these jeans, you’ll see that they are frayed.  They are not sewn above the fray, so you can expect them to continue to fray as you wear and wash them, unless you decide to sew right above the fray yourself.<br /><br />The “pearls”, down each side, are “riveted” into the fabric.  So, hopefully, they will not pop-off easily.  They certainly give these jeans a lot of extra “oomph”.<br /><br />These jeans have a “vintage” / “used” look to them. They are made of 83% cotton, 12% modal, 4% polyester and 2% spandex.  Even with only 2% spandex, there is some stretch to the fabric, including the waist.  You’ll notice some of what looks kind of like “bleaching” on the front lower leg.  This actually gives them a bit of a “dirty” look.<br /><br />I have the size 26, and they measure 40.5” from the top of the waist to the bottom.  The inseam is 30”.  The leg opening at the bottom is 11.25”.  Made in Vietnam."
4.0,La prenda cumple con lo esperado de acuerdo a la reseña y descripción del producto.
4.0,"Good quality for the price, Nice design and does not wrinkle after many uses and ties."
4.0,"I was so excited when I saw that my package was delivered. When I opened it, I couldn't help but smile. Everything was great. I only rate this a four star because it's mostly a choker meant for smaller type necks. Although, it fits just fine, I had to put it on the very last chain or else it would have been way too tight on me. But thank god the last chain was just right. I honestly love it.<br />I'm very gentle with it because it seems as if it may break if I'm not careful. The jewl is a beautiful red (I know that's random)"
4.0,"Cute. Just as it’s description. Was a little compressed for packaging but I’m sure once it’s full and I’m use, it’ll plump up"
4.0,"Cute little jammies - ordered a 3T Received 18 Months, so disappointed."
4.0,Two of these seemed smaller than the other and broke righty away. The rest are awesome and I've been able to wear multiple times.<br /><br />Great buy for the price.
4.0,"This dress is as you see, decent fabric for it's price but it doesn't feel like it will last a long time. You get what you pay for though, and I think this is a great little dress I will wear for a few summers. I am 5'4&#34; and 120 pounds (not a thin person) but the small is very big and loose on me..if you are very skinny I would not order this dress as they do not have an extra small."
4.0,This was perfect for my daughter’s third birthday party with a mermaid theme! She loved it.
4.0,"I love this pin. It is really pretty. I would say it is a bit too large to use on a collar, but I truly love it."
4.0,Sleeves are too long. Had to put elastic at the wrists. Falls just below knee.  Otherwise fits true to size.
4.0,Looks and fits great.  Quick shipping.
4.0,"Dress was very nice . I liked the soft material, however, it was close fitting and showed my stomach too much. I would’ve liked it to be a little more loose but the dress itself was so pretty!"
4.0,Soft and comfy but tend to slide down when walking or running
4.0,"It fits okay, I wear a 12 and it fits pretty good.  I will probably wear a slip underneath because it is very thin, that is if I wear it to dinner, but on the beach it should be fine."
4.0,Love the messaging. I actually have two of these. One was self purchased and one was a gift. I received them both the same week.  I love the length and the material but the tank itself itself runs big (or I run small). I am 5'3 and 103 lbs so it is too big to wear without a smaller tank or bandeau underneath.  Would love an XS.
4.0,Not bad I bought it for the kids to enjoy. My friend decided to use it for his kids. the quality is great and looks pretty Cool. make sure you have good batteries to power the fan to inflate the suit and breath. you only have a clear area for the face.
4.0,"This bikini makes me feel so cute, but the bottoms are disproportionately too small to the top. I am 5'3"", 135 lbs, 36B, and had to buy both the medium and the large size to use the large bottoms and medium top."
4.0,My husband loves his new belt. Nice soft leather. Great looking!
4.0,"I like this a lot. It's a little bit thinner than I expected, and sometimes the stones kind of flip, but I still love it. It's very dainty."
4.0,"Pretty cool. Doesn't always stay up but I like it more for when it's sitting on a table or bar and if I bump it, it doesn't move :) no more phone falling off the bar 👍🏻"
4.0,"Beautiful, comfortable dress. Long enough for my 5-8 height, but a bit large to be a size small. Love the pockets."
4.0,"Like the style, but this suit does run small.  I'm a natural 36D and top is super small.  I'm falling out on all sides.  I'm an 8-10 on the bottom and it doesn't come up/ cover up as much as I prefer for my momma belly.  The quality is great, just not for me."
4.0,I like it but it came with something on it so I had to wash it to get it off before considering wearing it. Other than that it’s cute.
4.0,Looks great and fits great. Very comfortable too for such a high heel.
4.0,It was definitely soft & warm only thing I would said was the hole to put the other piece thru was bigger enough to slide in....you have to fold the end to put it thru
4.0,I must have asked for the wrong size
4.0,"Expected it to be more tight so I went up a size, yet was pleasantly surprised that it's actually very true to size. Good quality material and very vivid colors, only would recommend to stay true to you're size."
4.0,He wore out the last one I got him and likes this as a suitable replacement.  Now if we could only get him to remember where he keeps the keys.
4.0,"The dress was amazing!! I'm a 44&#34; bust, 37&#34; waist and 51&#34; hips. I had to make adjustments to the halter section because my bust was smaller than the dimensions... Once I did that, the dress was perfect!!! So many compliments."
4.0,"This is a Carnival brand watch. For the most part, it looks and feels like a quality piece. However, the watch I received has the day of the week in Chinese rather than English. Not a big deal for me as that is not a feature I value much, but some might find it a problem. So far it has proven to be waterproof as advertised (swimming and showering, no diving as yet), and the band is reasonably robust, although I'll be replacing it with a velcro one as a personal preference. The tritium is easy to see in low light, even the second hand.  The screw down crown is nice, and I had no difficulty setting the time and date. Delivery is via DHL from China, and takes about 3 weeks."
4.0,"Matches my white patent leather shoes perfectly. Haven't used it yet, it's for church on Easter Sunday!!! I loved it from the moment I took it out of the package."
4.0,Bought as a gift and she loved them! Earrings were a little bigger than I thought from the pictures.
4.0,Was gift for my son. He is very slender and they fit him just right.
4.0,Product fit fine used it for self
4.0,They don't slip and are super cute
4.0,Loved color and design. Although large suitcase locking mechanism is only one that doesn't work
4.0,Looks lovely. It's different.
4.0,"Excellent quality product, great price"
4.0,"Fits ok. Pretty much what I expected, nothing special"
4.0,Overall I love the suit. 5’7” 170lbs. I wear size 12 jeans and ordered the xxl.<br />I am ordering a different top that is a little more conservative. I think most women would be fine with the way the top fits but I like to be covered more.<br /><br />I hope when I am done nursing my baby I will feel differently about the top.
4.0,Very pretty and sturdy feeling.
4.0,"Runs a bit large, but nice sweater"
4.0,"My husband loves wearing tool watches that do more than just tell the current time. I asked if he would test out this Men's Stainless Steel Chronograph Quartz Watch by BENYAR. So far, he has been very impressed by this watch's looks, performance, and many features. Beginning with his initial impressions, he found the watch tastefully and securely packaged in a neat signed box with a magnetic closure. The watch came with product information material, a guarantee card, a cleaning cloth, and a small bracelet adjustment tool. The stainless steel watch together with the bracelet have a sturdy heft and feel solidly manufactured. The watch dial is aesthetically pleasing with a broad vertical grey stripe running down the middle, which my husband thinks alludes to the look of vintage racing watches. The three chronograph subdials at the 6, 9, and 12 o'clock positions are well balanced and easy to read. The date window at the 3 o'clock position is framed nicely. The subtle BENYAR logo appears next to the date window and balances out the dial. There is a Tachymeter ring that runs around the inner bezel. My husband said that the watch also has glow-in-the-dark luminescent hands and hour markers, but noted that the glow only lasts a few minutes after exposing the dial to bright light. The chronograph stopwatch pushers are fairly responsive, but do require a firm press to activate and reset. In terms of time keeping, my husband set the watch when we received it and it has kept perfect time all week. My husband said that he had to use a watch bracelet resizing tool to adjust the bracelet to his wrist size. He recommends just taking it to a watch/jewelry store to adjust if you don't own a resizing tool. The small tool that is included can only be used to move the spring bar of the 2-position micro adjustment at the push button bracelet clasp.<br /><br />The only issues he found with this watch include the following: The center sweeping second hand does not hit squarely on the second markers as it ticks around the dial. The lower sub dial at the 6 o'clock position has a bit of play and rocks slightly to the right when he wears the watch. My husband noted that some of the product information in the Amazon listing does not seem to match the watch. The Amazon listing says the watch is water resistant to ""10 bar pressure,"" which is roughly equivalent to 100 meters. The watch's case back, however, shows that the water resistance is only up to 30 meters. Additionally, the listing information says that the watch is ""equipped with sapphire crystal,"" but the specification information at the bottom of the listing just says that it's made of ""glass,"" which usually means mineral crystal. Despite these few issues, my husband is thoroughly enjoying this wonderful new tool watch."
4.0,"Ordered this for a night out with friends and it was perfect! I typically wear a L/XL and ordered an XL based on previous purchases from the company. Material was a little stretchy which I wasn't expecting, but loved! There are also built in shorts which is really nice. Giving 4 stars because the top button is a little easy to come undone, however was not bothersome while I was out. Overall, would recommend if you are looking for an inexpensive faux leather skirt."
4.0,"I bought two pair of these in 12mm and one pair in 14mm. I like the gold over silver look. They are solid metal, not hollow tubing.<br /><br />My ears did not react to these earrings, so that means there is no nickel, lead or rhodium in them, yay! (I'm allergic to nickel, so my earholes get red and irritated if there is any nickel, and sometimes I get a reaction to rhodium plated silver that stays &#34;shiny&#34; via the rhodium.)<br /><br />They're pretty sturdy and once you fasten them, the catch stays shut. I caught my earrings on my brush one morning while brushing my hair -- and they didn't rip out of my ears like other hoops earrings have. Instead, they stayed put, but the brush movement yanked on my earlobe!<br /><br />They come with instructions on how to store sterling silver earrings when you're not wearing them. They don't *look* like sterling... they look gold.<br /><br />However, I found out they tarnish like sterling will. I had an acne breakout so I put a sulfur mask on my face. I got some of the mask on the two earrings lowest on my earlobes and closest to my cheeks. Sure enough, they tarnished.<br /><br />This is not a big deal, as I can easily remove the tarnish the way I usually do. But people might want to know that, despite being gold over sterling, they will *still* tarnish.<br /><br />(The way I usually remove tarnish on my silver jewelry is the old beginner chemistry way:<br /><br />Put a piece of aluminum foil on the bottom of a clean coffee mug. Put jewelry in mug on top of the aluminum foil.<br /><br />Set tea kettle on high flame on stove, to boil.  When water boils, pour mug about 1/2 to 2/3 full of boiling water.<br /><br />Holding the mug with the foil, jewelry, and just-boiled water over the kitchen sink, sprinkle about 1-2 tablespoons baking soda on top of the steaming hot water in the mug.<br /><br />Watch the water fizz and foam up quite a bit, sometimes overflowing the mug if it's filled with too much water.<br /><br />Let everything sit for about 10 minutes. There's a rotten egg smell from the tarnish (from sulfuric compounds in the tarnish, which come from pollution, the air around us, etc.) as the tarnish leaves the silver jewelry and bonds to the aluminum foil, and the bubbles from the chemical reaction rise to the surface of the water in the mug.<br /><br />And that's all there is to it. I wouldn't use this method with super intricate, antique/heirloom silver jewelry or a set of silver service for dining/entertaining. But for everyday, mass produced sterling jewelry, this method works fine and is way less expensive than buying special silver polishing clothes or silver polish. It's grammar school chemistry! And, as far as I know, it does not harm the jewelry.)<br /><br />Bonus: You can &#34;twirl&#34; or turn these earrings in your ear holes. I like to put hoops in my ears and forget about them. But after I shower every morning, I turned these 1/4 turn in my ear holes. They didn't stick, and the hing and catch have about the same diameter as the rest of the hoop, plus no sharp edges. So you can actually turn the entire earring a full turn through your ear holes without it hurting or harming your ear holes on the inside."
4.0,Worked well over this last moose season? Carries a lot of gear is quiet and easy on the back.<br />Zippers could be a little more skookum but at that price I can't complain. Still working and nothing broken yet so it has paid for itself.
4.0,I ordered a size smaller and it fits just right!
4.0,"This is a great design, but the fabric is really thin.  You can totally see pantylines through this dress regardless of the type of underwear that you use.  I tried using a slip, but you can see the slip seams through the dress.  I'm really sad that this didn't work as I loved the design."
4.0,I have only worn this piece this so far and I like it. Lot.
4.0,Cute and comfy dress.
4.0,"I purchased this hat to wear to work. It's nice, lightweight, and comfortable. You may have to pin it right after you get it, it's needs to be broken in. I wear it almost 5 days a week. Probably gonna order it in another color soon."
4.0,The shell bracelet has an unusual design.  I really like the idea that it is adjustable and is easy to pull tighter or looser.  The tails that are created by tightening the bracelet are attractive on the underside. The shell design is ok but I would likely choose another design if there was one. I like the bracelet overall.  4 stars.<br /><br />**Review by Mrs. WryGuy2**
4.0,I loved them...Grandson didn't really want to wear them until I showed him what a Jelly fish and Sting rays are...lol
4.0,Overall very comfortable and flattering. The straps of the sports bra are long and did have to be altered.
4.0,I like this bag a lot. The zippers aren't great but otherwise seems sturdy and is exactly what I wanted.
4.0,"Cute, but didn’t work well as headbands like I wanted. They are still really pretty for bag accessories though."
4.0,The color and size of the keychain are as advertised. I expected it to be a ball but it is a flat circle. I still love it though.
4.0,"This dress is a thicker knit material with a bit of stretch and a quality feel that drapes beautifully.  It is very flattering.  It is a bit tight in the bust but still fits well.  The neckline is wider than expected with overlapping material at shoulder.  I plan on wearing a scarf so it will work out well.  It has nicely placed darts at the bust and pockets sewn in the seam so you don't see them.  I have larger arms and the sleeves fit well with room to move.  The length is flattering and will go well with boots or heels.  It will be nice for the cooler weather, but would be too warm for summer.  It doesn't need a slip.  I really like it and can't hardly wait to wear it.  It fits just like it does on the model.  If you like this style you will not be disappointed."
4.0,Material is a bit hot
4.0,"You can wear it when it is not very cold. The colors are vivid like in picture. For medium it is small, not very but still not medium. The rest is fine"
4.0,I ordered the rose gold little leaf earrings. They're so small and dainty. I bought them to wear to work. My style is very minimalistic and chic; these earrings encompass both of those adjectives. They're a tad pricey but they're made at a New York company (supposedly). I really really like them.
4.0,"I needed a pair of sunglasses and these were the right price. I believe that sunglasses should all block the necessary harmful rays and be polarized and again, these fit the bill.<br />Sunglasses came with a cleaning cloth, a polarized visual test card, and a nice hard case. The reason I'm knocking it down the star is because my wife tried to wear them but her hair got stuck in the part of the arm where it turns from just the hard plastic arm to a rubber grip. If you don't have long hair this is not an issue.<br />Visually, I like slightly smaller lenses as these tend to make me look a bit bug-eyed, but that's no reason to knock them down any other stars. I should have been more picky when I chose what I was going to wear on my face :-)"
4.0,The skirt is beautiful.  It fits as expected my only hiccup is the material. I was expecting more of a cotton blend but it's seem more like a silky feel
4.0,"Two pairs of wicking socks for 10 bucks - what's not to like? They seem a bit thin compared to name brands I own. Definitely lightweight, for summer."
4.0,"Fits well, comfortable. Nice shirt!"
4.0,"I followed the suggestion of a prior review and bought a size up - from M to L, which worked perfectly.  This runs a size smaller"
4.0,My wife likes it...
4.0,I love these pants.  They are comfortable and stylish.  I bought these for work but they are not dressy enough.  I didn't realize they were nursing pants until I received them.  These are great for hanging out on the weekends or running errands.
4.0,"Light, make the sun glare & brightness manageable, happy with purchase."
4.0,I like the Gambling Box better than the winners bank200 because the Gambling Box has a regular key to open box. The slot on the Gambling Box is easy to insert the money.<br />The Winners Bank 200 has a  skeleton key .  It’s a little difficult to open and put money in the slot if you have  Arthritis.
4.0,Fit as well as expected.
4.0,The ring is very pretty.
4.0,Super cute! Just know you only get one.
4.0,Great food great color
4.0,Have not had to use it yet as our temps have been very warm.  Was ordered during an extremely cold snap.  Feel sure it will keep my face nice and warm when taking my daily walks during the cold weather.
4.0,"Not that high quality, but I wasn't expecting it to be. Perfect for a one-time wear."
4.0,"Cute jammies, good quality, but shirt runs slim."
4.0,"Served me fairly well for the price, developed curves over time due to my figure and had to reattach buckle at times, but otherwise no issues till now."
4.0,"Very cute, but also kinda little heavy for my one year old."
4.0,"I just picked these up the other day, and I LOVE them!! They are just as beautiful on as they are in the picture.  My only issue with these is that you have to order TWO--they only come in singles.  This doesn't make any sense---it was like buying two separate shoes instead of a pair."
4.0,The inserts are as described on web site but just a little bit big.  Bigger than I thought they would be.  My bad.
4.0,A little to small.  My bad.  Sized wrong.
4.0,My 5 year old loved these sandals because of the xomfort and the design however they were slightly larger than i expected. I suggest ordering a half to a full size smaller
4.0,"The watch is light-weight, sometimes I forget I'm even wearing it. The clear strap and watch are super trendy and go with  my casual outfits. The time is easy to read on the bright white face, the numbers are large and the minute ticks are far enough apart to tell the difference between. If you look really closely, the numbers are little blurry where they were printed, but you have to look close. For an inexpensive watch I like it a lot.<br /><br />The one thing I would not about this watch is that is SMELLED strongly of chemicals when I first took it out of the package. I let it air out a few days and now it's fine, but be careful if you want to wear this as soon as you buy it!"
4.0,"Fantastic for the price - especially with a potty-training 2yr old. We need A LOT of backups. They were a tad loose brand new but after the first wash they shrunk to the right size. I do wonder if the leg holes will stretch out too much over time, but so far they're great. (NO front pocket, by the way! In case that's something you actually want)."
4.0,"As expected, beware may not be made in America, and some stitching may unravel and fray. Otherwise good."
4.0,Looks as good as can be expected for the price.
4.0,Really like these socks for walking around the house on tile
4.0,"I bought these in a size M for my 6 year old daughter since they said it was appropriate for 5 to 7 year old.  She is pretty skinny, so the legs of these were a bit baggy on her and they were longer than she needed, but she loved them.  Wore them all day on Halloween and with her witch costume for trick or treating.  She'll probably be able to fit into these for another year or so.  Due to her petite frame, a small probably would have worked better."
4.0,"who doesn't love a novelty pair of sunglasses? perfect for a lolita costume or just looking very 70s fly with a demure twist. these are cheap, bad at shading sun and should not be worn for serious use. these are fun and perfect for costume."
4.0,Very cute but super thin material. It's see through.
4.0,"These aren't super-high-end socks, but so far they hold together fine. Remarkably good fit, even though I have rather loooong toes.<br /><br />Fun novelty pair for us normal folks, and probably not a bad choice if you're a fan of 'all toe-socks, all the time'."
4.0,Fits as expected... Pretty sexy looking on Miss Claus! Nice quality!
4.0,"Stylish belt. Good quality. Had to add a couple holes for a snugger fit, but this doesn't seem to have affected the integrity of the belt. No breakage of any sort so far, seems to be holding up well. Four stars not five bc the buckle is a bit bulky and you definitely know it's there when you're sitting."
4.0,Good earings like how they look. just a little heavy.
4.0,Black leather mens belt.  This is a nice black leather belt with a sturdy gold belt buckle.  I also have this in brown leather.  The black leather belt is patterned and measures 42 inches long with a 2 inch long buckle. This belt looks great with jeans and is made with sturdy quality materials.  Great multipurpose black leather belt.
4.0,I got this as an accessory for a Halloween costume. It was perfect! I don't know if it would be an every day accessory but was well worth it.
4.0,"This is a really cute and simple bracelet that is worth the price I paid for it, great gift for my mom."
4.0,"I like it. Looks pretty good,shiny. the band is easy to adjust"
4.0,Fits well for my 14&#34; size neck. There was only one choker whose clasp broke but I fixed it easily. Quality matches price.
4.0,"Was somewhat small but after a few times wearing it, I was able to break it in. I just had a baby and this really helped to keep my tummy in. After a few wears, I noticed that my belly shrunk tremendously."
4.0,Nice quality and looks beautiful.
4.0,The sleeves are too small it won’t fit but the rest of the dress fit
4.0,Thicker back width than the pics and I'm a very wide backed person it fits perfect just wish the outter threads were softer around the chest and arms holes. And the back was a lil thinner
4.0,"A little tight on his head. And he doesn't really like to wear but not the product, more the kid."
4.0,"I Received My Braclet A Week Early Which Is Awesome! It Came In Protective Packaging, Lots Of Bubble Rap... It Fits Well, Hasn't Faded Or Changed Colored. I'm Very Pleased :)"
4.0,"It's just as geeky looking in person as the photo but it works well to keep the sun off the back of the neck, an area that I, for one, never used to think about...glad I bought it, skin cancer is no joke...."
4.0,"At this time I have not used yet, so far it's beautiful, feels sturdy yet light weight."
4.0,"I bought 4 different pairs of linen (or linen blend) pants for an upcoming cruise.  Two pairs were instant dismisses as they simply didn't fit well.  The other pair I really liked was the 28 Palms pants, but these fit the best and in my wife's opinion, they made my ""rear"" look best.<br /><br />I'm not a tiny guy.  6-1, 235.  I usually wear an XL in shorts, shirts, and pretty much everything, but after reading other reviews and how they are sized, I had to order an XXL... which makes me a little grumpy.  Regardless, the reason I knocked them down a start is simply that their material isn't as nice as some of the others.  Material-wise, 28 Palms were the best, but the fit on these was the deciding factor.  The material is nice and breathable, but it's not 100%... but rather linen blended with cotton."
4.0,The medium is a little too big the small it's ok
4.0,"my daughter loves this set, so im happy.  BUT its not really sweatshirt material, its more like a long sleeved t-shirt.  this want be too warm, but if used for appropriate temps it wont be an issue."
4.0,versatile
4.0,"Loved the bag.  Right size to fit my needs.  As another reviewer stated, inside of the bad feels like a paper bag but that wasn't a really big deal for me."
4.0,The bust fits perfect.the skirt part abit too loose
4.0,"No me fije bien en las medidas al pedir el vestido, es algo largo, me gustaría que hubiera sido unos 2 cm más corto al menos, pero de ahí , esta muy bien, me gustó 8 de 10"
4.0,Runs small in the butt area ..<br />Overall the material is very nice ..<br />They fit but bending over to much shows
4.0,This is a great thicker fleece sweatshirt. The color is a navy (not sure what new navy is exactly). The size is as expected.
4.0,"The solid bottoms tend to twist where it’s two layers of fabric and causes a lot of wrinkles, but other than that it fits good and is comfy."
4.0,Work well wish they were just a tiny bit larger as the button is small
4.0,"Pretty spendy for toddler undies (hence the 4 stars) but they are much nicer than the standard toddler briefs I've found at Target. They have much more stretch, they're much softer, and the openings are much kinder. My 3.5 year old daughter loves them. And because of the extra stretch, they're easier for her to manage on her own. I will buy again."
4.0,"i get a lot of compliments on this purse.  it looks much more expensive than it was.  it's very soft and has a lot of pockets.  one drawback is that is so soft, the material inside gets caught in the zipper, so be careful and make sure it's hanging down when you zip it.  otherwise, very nice."
4.0,"I love these scrub caps. I’m a Dental Hygiene Assistant & I polish, floss, and suction 24/7 during the day. My hair is long and these caps were able to tame my mane! Couldn't stand the idea of all the bacteria in my hair after a long day. Especially when I have a little one at home! Suggest washing them on gentle cycle so that the colors don’t run and the fabric stays thick. Other than that they are great especially for the price!!!"
4.0,"This band looks great, especially for the price. My only complaint is that it began to smell over time, I think from getting wet and drying when I wash my hands."
4.0,"The torso part is a little short but other than that it fits well! Also, it does not have underwire for the bra portion so if you require that support this might not be for you.  However, I'm a D cup and felt fine."
4.0,"This product was really good. I mean the necklaces looked really nice and expensive. only thing was the chain, it's really short but this was worth the buy.<br />all I had to do was go to Walmart and buy two new chains for like 15$ together. (I mean they were too Chains so)"
4.0,"for the price, a great product"
4.0,Feeling like a real cyclist now
4.0,"Gives you a smart, casual look at an affordable price. The quality of the fabric is alright, but haven't had any issues with color or fit."
4.0,"Really cute! Looks like the pic but definitely runs small, size one or two sizes up because the adjustable straps can pick up any slack there might be. I ended up stretching the leg holes and popping a few stitches to make it a more comfortable fit. 5'3&#34; 150lb pear shaped with 30&#34; waist and wish I would've gotten the extra large"
4.0,I want to really love this shirt.  I got many compliments on the uniqueness of it.  I just had an issue keeping the long sleeve side wrapped over on top of my shoulder.  It kept falling on my back as you can see in the picture.  I dont think it's a sizing issue because it fit perfectly on my torso.
4.0,"Pretty and received many compliments. Without the liner it’s seems thin and you can see through the seams, with liner difficult to get items out. Would buy again, but won’t be carrying it for everyday"
4.0,"I get tons of compliments on this quite frequently, and the price cannot be beat. Quality was better than expected given the price."
4.0,Great!! God look for the price.
4.0,I return it!!
4.0,I received this waist cincher and I was so excited.  I couldn't wait to try it out.  Unfortunately it seems to run a little large so I didn't quite work for me.  Which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I would order a size smaller.  I did give it to a friend of mine and she is very happy with it.  She said it cinches her in in all the right places.  She wore it for 6 hours the first day and said it was very comfortable and she has continued to wear for several more days.  She says hit holds her in really firm yet not so tight that it is uncomfortable.  Its too soon to tell if it is actually doing anything at this point but I will update this review if there are any changes.  I did receive this cincher at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  Although it did not work for me it seems to be working for my friend.
4.0,This dress was very loose and comfortable but I did not like how it looked on me.
4.0,"I love this swimsuit! Exactly like he picture and came in two weeks, only thing was the top is smaller on me, but I'm a C cup and I got a medium, it just shows side boob, but I covered in the picture 😂"
4.0,I was looking for a swim suit that provided bust support for my 36DD s. This bathing suit did all right but didn't provide the support that I needed. The padding provided was odd and it was hard to line the cups up with my bust and I wouldn't recommend removing the pads completely as you will not have any support. I also found that the front design is not flattering if you have a pouch. This will be emphasized if you do. The design was cute but I wish the top was tighter to provide more support.
4.0,"Vest is lite, speakers are nicely done.<br />It would be perfect if the top shoulders straps Gould be adjusted for someone who is taller.<br />Get a size bigger<br />Nice product"
4.0,Really nice soft lace stretch
4.0,I liked the material and back side mesh but did not like the side flowing cut by the waist. Good work out top in general but did not like the side style.
4.0,"Me agradó mucho , es tal como lo esperaba ."
4.0,A little small but pretty
4.0,"It is very good for holding back bangs or hair that generally falls in your face,<br /><br />It is well made and sturdy, it is real leather, which is so nice because I hate that fake leather smell. The leather is soft and flexible.<br /><br />It has an elastic band that can stretch from a child's size t an adult. It holds n pretty well but the elastic can fold, and slip on hair easily (Around my neck it always slips off if I am not careful putting it on.)<br /><br />The studs are cute and shiny but If you are like me with plenty of hair that thinks on its own it will get under the studs and be pulled when you take off the headband.<br /><br />I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Good bracelet. But hard to lock the ends.
4.0,Great trendy look
4.0,Warm And comfortable. A little to thick for picking small stuff up
4.0,"So the material is decent, the look is good, the feel is pleasant, but the fit was quite snug, especially in the waist and crotch. The size was correct for me, but it just runs on the snug side. They fit, but they can squeeze you a bit after a while, so I don't wear them for long. Maybe they'll loosen up after a while, but for now I have to say they get four stars for decent quality but a too-snug fit."
4.0,Just lovely for owl critiques
4.0,"These are so well made. Nice and thick. Not think like hot thick but as in made well. Not able to see thru them at all. I would have given them a 5 star but the band around the top is way to tight unless you have a super slim waist that is perfect and flat. Not realistic there. But I would buy these, just in a larger size. If you wear a medium buy a large. You won’t regret buying them. They are very well made. Very nice material and stretchy. Very comfortable except for the waist part. And it rolls too. I do love them so bought a larger size. I wish I would have requested a larger size in the beginning. Live and learn as the fits is not always correct. Size up people.. Enjoy."
4.0,"I wore this to a 50th anniversary party and it was perfect. The dress was a good fit and the color , was spot on from the pictures online. It fits great. I am 5’3.5 inches tall, about 139 pounds. The material is in thick and is not see through. It’s a great value."
4.0,Works as advertised.  Would be nice if it would have come with a plastic pouch to store the cloth. Not bad for the money.
4.0,Not real sturdy but a good price.
4.0,Grate item my son loved it wish it was engraved would have been better but still liked the item
4.0,So thin!  Not sure if it will protect against drops.
4.0,Para mi perfecto para mi niña muy escotado adelante
4.0,Great Quality for price.
4.0,"They look good and feel very light, the finish on the mold is not the best, but a emery board got that sorted out, the one thing that I find is that after wearing them for a long period I get tired.<br />I have since worked out that it is because they are narrow, so a hot iron and greaseproof paper, I reshaped the arms out, now no headaches."
4.0,"Super cute, got a lot of compliments.  It might be a bit too small, but then again I am in between sizes.  Only downside is that the skirt gets very wrinkled if sitting (and from my seat belt.)  Still like it though!"
4.0,"Very pretty , with good color but the infant must be infant not for six month old. Gotta be real small ... Ended up just being put up as a keepsake"
4.0,Takes time to get learn how to handle.
4.0,"Love this top.  It fit well, but is designed for persons with slender arms."
4.0,They are very cute.  They are also very very large.  I bought them for an infant and they look like they would fit an older toddler or small child instead.  They are also very thin so I don't know how warm they will keep her legs.
4.0,I should have read the reviews. The arms are tight but it will do. I was pleasantly surprised by the snaps. I am 5’2” so it is super long on me. I ordered a medium. I have a 36” chest and it DOES snap close without gapping👍🏼!
4.0,Looks great! I wish the fabric underneath started a little lower on my chest and not so close to my neck but it worked perfect for my bridal shower. 5’9” 155 lbs - medium worked great!
4.0,"This is my second pair of these boots.  I ordered these as a backup to my other pair due to the price reduction because they are very comfortable.  My guess is the price cut is due to the fact that the first pair of lugs from the standard laces typically falls off due to the poor way Dunham attached the backing(see a previous review comment).  I don't know why they attached that pair differently from the two top pair of lugs...dumb.  I replaced that pair of lugs with a better designed grommet type(readily available), although the color doesn't match exactly and that works fine."
4.0,I bought this for my daughter who is a size 5 but has a 32f chest. Needless to say it’s hard to find a flattering dress that doesn’t show major cleavage or look like a potato sack . This dress has stretch and is a great option to wear a little snug. She looked great a graduation and the dress was cute. Dress it up with cute shoes and jewelry 😀👍
4.0,It didn't fit well on me as a plus-size woman but my daughter loves it and it looks beautiful on her she's plus size with little curves she's a size 16-18 and 59 in height.
4.0,"I like this top a lot  The material is great, style classic.  I am so disappointed that this top is very small  I usually wear a size largo but decided to get X large for comfort during summer.  I've kept it because  for me returning is a big problem  I am wheelchair bound."
4.0,"I love the color and warmth of this sweater, the only thing I’m not too crazy about is the notch on the front goes down lower than I’d like (my bra shows), so I would recommend wearing a tank top if you have your bra showing. The sleeves are pretty long too (I don’t have broad shoulders, so I pull the sleeves away from my wrists), so maybe a size smaller would fit better. I’m normally an xxl which is what I ordered and it fits roomy."
4.0,"This dress is so cute! I love it! It fits me, but maybe just a tad too big. I guess you could say it has a little room for growth. I purchased the smallest size, I am 5'3&#34; and I weigh 116 lbs. It's also a bit long, it reaches just past my knees. But I love it anyway!"
4.0,Perfect fit for an I-Pad.
4.0,"The quantity is great for the price. I like how they are already made. It saves me a lot of time. They seem to be made well enough. I also like the length of these and the adjustability. I just don't like that when you wear one, the clasp part always shifts to the front of your neck."
4.0,"The red one wasn't a red or fuschia ones, wasn't their  true colors. overall okay."
4.0,"I always get compliments when I wear this scrub top.  It looks athletic with the zipper and the fit is snug, but that is as is should be.  It can show your bra - so I wear a cami under it."
4.0,This is not a heavy sweatshirt but it’s warm. Polyester material but not shiny. I found a little big so order your regular size. I like it. Ordering another color  in my regular size
4.0,"Nice fit.  Disappointed in clarity of picture of emblem and writing.  Dull colors, not very bright like advertised online."
4.0,Nice dress. Fast shipping. A bit shorter then shown.
4.0,"This thing is made of really comfortable,soft,  kind of stretchy material. It is so handy to have while traveling. You could sleep in it but still wear it to go out  for coffee. You could reverse it for a different look as well. It's not gorgeous looks-wise in terms of how it flatters the body but it's cute enough And I don't  even have to wear a bra because of the thick, snug material. . Very practical, especially for the price! Get one!"
4.0,its beautiful and fits perfectly well ! the fabric is really good and the dress looks elegant !
4.0,"nice bracelet, although could be slightly larger to allow the wrap to go around the full 5x which looks the best and still have enough room to have this move freely and not bind...."
4.0,They are great. Nice colors and perfect for reading the newspaper!
4.0,"Extremely fun to use, but not a tight fit so I would not use this mask in a crowed area.  Recharges fast.  Love this, just the fit is not tight and there is no way to change that"
4.0,A little bigger than I thought they would be but otherwise as expected
4.0,"There is definitely a strong plastic odor at first, now its faint. My daughter loves these boots though. They have glitter and light up. She can put them on her self which is a huge plus."
4.0,"I initially purchased something similar from China and while I really liked the concept, they quality was poor. That's when I found these. Very pleased with what they do. Get nice and warm but not hot. Ozone time is a little short, but seems to work. I do like the fact that they stay on then entire time they are plugged in and ozone cycle is automated. Great for warming shoes on a cold morning as well!<br /><br />Would easily be a 5 star product if, like others have mentioned, the cables at the back were designed better. They aren't sturdy enough for multiple removals and insertions. Add a 90 degree plug on the back and call it a winner!<br /><br />Pro tip: plug them in to a smart plug/outlet and control them from your phone from anywhere, never have to worry about unplugging them!"
4.0,Exactly what I expected. Faux suede with &#34;silver&#34; metal ends. Cute and worth the $7.
4.0,This is a great buy and all the jewelry was good quality no rashes or bumps from the jewelry.  Worth the money.
4.0,"First, the material is very soft and isn't see through. The dress is definitely form fitting. I am 5'4"" and 188 lbs and bought a large (I normally wear a large). I'll need to wear spanks with this dress but that's okay. When buying the dress, I definitely would recommend looking at the pictures of the actual dress hanging by itself rather than the model wearing it because the model makes it look more like a wrap dress when in reality it is all one piece and you get the belt to tie separately. That was my only take away. Would consider buying it again."
4.0,"Very thin - more shirt-like than sweat shirt, but my daughter likes it."
4.0,"overall the shoes fit well. They are a little narrow, only complaint. Seem like a good deal for the price. Leather is breaking in nicely after 5 wears. Only other note is that the insoles are not padded, so long walks probably won’t be comfortable."
4.0,"I use mine as a gambeson is meant for, padding for under the armor, and it works well as cushion for under my lamellar armor for SCA. The product it self (mainly the buckles) where sloppily put together the rivets are pounded all the way out and the buckles themselves arn't even in the leather slot the cut out for he tounge of the buckle but all and all I don't see needed replace on this any time soon."
4.0,"These leggings are buttery soft.  That being said, they are not my favorite material for working out in.  I prefer this material for leggings I wear outside of the gym.  That being said, they do fit as expected- I am 5'4"", 140lbs and the Medium fits perfectly.  They are high-waisted and have pockets- always a nice attribute for leggings.  Because of the material, they attract pet fur/lint.  Also they are very, very slightly see through when stretched out fully.  You should be fine to wear these with a shirt that covers your bottom, just in case."
4.0,"Like it ... a little small, makes a nice light jacket too."
4.0,Tight fit for a larger head. The description had me hopeful for a good fit!!!
4.0,great suit but ran small
4.0,"Good item, comfortable, legs kind of lose some elasticity after a few wears, making them closer to straight boxers"
4.0,"I love this belt. Nice looking and so easy to use. If your weight changes all the time, this belt is the one to wear. just pull or release to make it tighter or loser and nice looking.  When this wears out, I will buy more"
4.0,"The green color is much lighter than expected.  more like a light pea color, not dark, army green as pictured."
4.0,A little thick but ok for cold weather
4.0,"I have a varity of masks. I even have a set like this but w/o the ear holes. I was hoping the filter(s) would stay in the pouch better but they do not. The ear holes are more for a kid or small ears and not really for an average adult (which I consider I am). I'm  sure you can stretch them out but they don't seem to stretch without the fear of ripping the seams. They also are a little tight around the neck. I'm 5,10, 200lbs. So I feel I'm avg at best. You do need to stretch them out before you put them on or you will feel a little uncomfortable. The material is nice though. Air flow was fine as compared to other masks I have. Just note the ear holes will make your ears stick out like dumbo."
4.0,I got for a friend. they looked like they liked it
4.0,"Headbands fit my daughter perfectly. My only complaint was when I washed them on a gentle cycle with my babys clothes, the bows detach from the headband."
4.0,the legs do ride up a bit.
4.0,I received the ring 2 days after i ordered it and it's a nice looking ring. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality ring for a great price
4.0,"The shirt was extremely soft and my son loves it. It fits as expected. It was for a very slim young man so it is not very fitted on him. It is a little big, but he is in that in between stage of growing. He still loves it. The color is light red as shown in the picture. Overall it is what I expected. However, if they had a smaller size I would have loved that."
4.0,The fir
4.0,"nice, my wife loved it"
4.0,Very nice shirt.  I studied the size chart carefully and ordered a large.  I should have ordered an XL (normally a size medium)<br />This fits much smaller than expected.  I recommend going 2 sizes up
4.0,these earrings are pretty and light but tassles were bent when I received them.  I had to iron them to straighten them out a little.  They should package better.
4.0,Awesome color and fit! 4 stars because I think it may show wear quickly... but maybe not!
4.0,The outside of the hoodie is a bit stiff feeling. The inside is nice and soft at least. The hole for your head to go through is a bit on the small size but the rest fits well.
4.0,"Comfortable, nice looking, but too long.  Even with heels they're too long for me (I'm 5'4&#34;).  They have small front pockets (not big enough for a phone)."
4.0,SOFT AND COOL
4.0,"I received this watch strap yesterday and I was very impressed with the speed of delivery and the promptness of the shipper.  But, in the description it says the length is 12&#34; including buckle.  It was shorter than that.  The length is 10-3/4&#34; including the buckle.  That is the only thing I noticed.  It fits nicely.  The hardware is nice polished stainless steel, the material is strong yet not too thick and rigid like other NATO straps and the hardware is not heat sealed only.  It is stitched.  Very nice quality.  So the good outweighs the shorter than described length.  I would recommend this one."
4.0,"Bought these to add to my collection of store bought Wearfirst brand shorts. These 34's were tighter and not as stretchy as my store bought shorts. Aside from that, I'm a fan of the brand and still am after this purchase."
4.0,Everything was perfect except the pants. They were a little tight on my daughter.
4.0,"I went as Raven for Halloween and bought this as an easy alternative to DIYing a belt. I was thinking I would have to deconstruct the belt to get separate wrist and brooch amulets, but thankfully it came with three separate pieces already, in addition to a gem that I attached to my forehead using eyelash glue. I removed one star because, as some other reviewers noted, some gems may fall off. As I was creating the costume, one of the wrist gems fell out of its gold casing and I had to reattach it with superglue. It lasted the whole night but by the end the same one had fallen off again. Not too bad if you’re only planning to use this for one night and are looking for a cheaper alternative to DIY."
4.0,"This is so comfy, it would be perfect if it had pockets! I would buy again."
4.0,"Seem nice, washes well."
4.0,"So I ordered this in S, I’m about 151 lb and about 5’4. if you want it to be fitted, I would order a size down. A there seems to be a lot of extra material around the chest area, had to keep pulling down dress to stretch material out. Otherwise, it’s a very cute dress, I think the color of the red dress is a little lighter in person, not as dark as it looks in the photo, but not too far off. Pared this dress with some knee length boots for Christmas party. I plan on buying the one in blue and yellow too."
4.0,Money well spent!
4.0,Nice quality for the price actually. Runs quite big though! It is for sure sized for men I feel. Great shirt for the festival I needed it for!
4.0,Im deciding if to send back or keep. Its see through.  It does look cute and casual which is what i wanted so i mean it looks nice i guess my only problem with it is it’s see through.
4.0,"Nice tunic, fits perfectly. I'm 5'3&#34; and wear DDD bra so the large fit perfectly.  I returned it because of the elastic waist.  I didn't realize it was there when I ordered and it is too high."
4.0,Great job at keeping the pocket square folded and neat.
4.0,"Thinner then I thought they would be, but overall awesome locs and love the colours."
4.0,This is very nice but I found it is too heavy to hook onto my purse is I had hoped.
4.0,Nice hat. Good quality. But unfortunately the size was too large.
4.0,"The straps feel fragile, so be careful putting it on. A bit tight at the neck when buttoned all the way up, but cuter w/ one unbuttoned anyway. The creases were easy to get out. Instead of ironing, I spritzed some wrinkle release spray and tossed them in the dryer for a few minutes. I would recommend wearing with a slightly thicker shirt to avoid seeing the bib lines."
4.0,The material is good but small
4.0,"this thing is huge on the inside, although the opening is pretty small. it will hold a lot, but it s very heavy on its own, so anything that goes into it only makes it heavier. You can't wheel it everywhere and will have to pick it up for stairs and into cars and such, so keep that in mind when buying this bag. It is very heavy."
4.0,High quality well made Lederhosen. You're getting what you paid for.
4.0,It's a nice piece and made great
4.0,Why are there metal balls inside of the cup paddings?
4.0,"Pretty good glasses, I use them for mountain biking and tennis. I like the interchangeable lenses, the polarized lens are pretty decent<br />Silver lens are not photochromic<br />Anti-fog coating is not the greatest"
4.0,"It’s a nice watch but has a cheap feel to it? I normally wear heavier diver style watches and could be I’m not use to a smaller, thinner, lighter watch. The second hand is blue so it can be hard to see at times."
4.0,"great price, I never got to wear it, a friend fell in love with it and I gave it to her"
4.0,It’s well made. I use it to hold my FOB for my GMC Denali. I was really looking for something that I didn’t need to unzip to access the FOB buttons. It works.
4.0,"I wish I would have ordered a size up for a little extra room, but it still fits by ordering my size. I wash it and the fabric became super wrinkly. I tried drying it and trashing, still wrinkly. But everyone assumed that was supposed to be the texture of the fabric, so no harm done. I got a ton of compliments. It is a very pretty dress, and flattering."
4.0,Very soft material and squat proof. Only downside is it’s not as hugging as I thought it would be so def size down. It’s decent athletic wear for the price
4.0,Thumbs on mitten odd shaped. But if you work down knit it does fit.<br />Doesn't come packaged
4.0,Absolutely love this bracelet! It came in sooner than expected. Although it is ceramic the photos look flat and turned out to be a glossy bracelet. I was expecting a flat finish but the gloss isn't so bad. I have a 7 1/2 wrist so the amount that came was too many and I had to remove three from the chain for it to fit exact. I used a watchband remove tool kit to remove the extra chains and was very easy to do. Definitely an all purpose/ any occasion stylish bracelet.
4.0,I really like the look and very easy to adjust to the correct wrist size. Not sure why but removing this band is very hard.  Seems simple enough so I don't know why it is so hard to remove the band.
4.0,Gift for Grandson?
4.0,Shirt came nice and vibrant
4.0,Cute dress if u have enough to fill it out
4.0,It’s really nice . Looks expensive and chic. Will definitely buy agian . Makes a good gift . The small wallet is very useful. I don’t know about the durability yet but it does look good for now and I am satisfied
4.0,"I ordered 1.75 then I liked them a lot so I ordered a pair of 2.0. Easy to apply with water and easy to come off to wash them. I've been using them for about 2 months and does it's job well. I can take them off and put them back on when I want to, not like progressive or dual vision glasses that I stuck with them unless I want to buy entire lenses again paying over $100+."
4.0,"I got a solid black pair and the pair with white crosses on them, they feel very soft and the pattern didn't stretch with my large thighs and calfs. The only problem I have with them is for the pair with the white crosses holes have developed along the seam on the front and back of the leggings. For me that's fine I have been wearing the legging with a skirt or a dress so it doesn't show. The seam along the legs seem to be fine and have not developed holes."
4.0,"some of the spots on it are messy and i’ll probably have to fix with white paint, but it’s still super cute for the price and i will definitely be wearing it!"
4.0,It is what it is as advertise
4.0,I love Eeyore and was glad to find these pajamas.  I really only wanted the top and it will work fine.
4.0,A bit smaller than I was expecting. It is shorter than what I would like as I planned to use this with leggings. Every time I go to wear this shirt I continuously think its a bit to short. But otherwise it is a beautiful shirt. That's the 4/5 stars.
4.0,Going from a full waterproof mid rise to this feels bad. Its Ok as a shoe itself. But I'm honestly struggling to find a upside from a full gortex mid. I understand its not a full gortex maybe at this price point arcterx would have more value.
4.0,"Super cute, but bigger than I was expecting."
4.0,I think I order the wrong size or I got bigger because there to small
4.0,"It's somewhat small, but I can make it work. LOVE the print and material. Finally, a romper I can wear! I'm 5'9&#34; and rompers are always too short! The length is perfect on this one!"
4.0,Very pretty but a tad too small. Otherwise...well-made and a good value.
4.0,"Fits well, but very long. I'm 5'8"" & will need to have it hemmed unless I am wearing it w/ heels which I don't plan on doing. Very cute otherwise."
4.0,"The product appears to do what is intended although I was hoping for longer, larger connectors."
4.0,The fingers are so long that the extra length makes it hard to use for touch screen.  For me.
4.0,Not black and white.  More of black and cream colored
4.0,"They are really stretchy so I wish they were a bit more snug, however, they are cute."
4.0,"Nice, but its toooooooo hard to open because of the metal"
4.0,"I use them for floor socks, not with shoes ."
4.0,"It is a really cute piece to wear. The only drawback was that it was a little to big on me for me. It was only the shoulder strap area, everything else fit just fine. I'm 4'10' and 103lbs. The length of the skirt stops about mid thigh."
4.0,Really pretty and comfortable but one pocket came with a small hole in it but its really cheap for a long dress. Luckily I can sew
4.0,These are the best gloves I've ever owned. They fit perfect. And they are very stylish I also love the bags for storage
4.0,It's a cute dress but the chest area was a little loose and the frills/buttons were sewn on crooked leaning towards the left of me as it went down to the skirt. Petticoat not included and the bonnet was bought separately. The turned down collar of the dress was not attached and held together by a button. It was way too loose as well and sat very awkwardly so I just trashed it. Still overall very satisfied with the dress though. 8/10 would recommend
4.0,"A handy little backpack for trips to amusement parks. I got this as a cheaper alternative to the Fjallraven Kanken Mini, and I'm glad I did - since it was cheaper I didn't have any qualms about tossing it around or getting it dirty. Plus this version has more pockets which helps with organizing things. The only complaint I have is that the straps can be a little scratchy on bare skin."
4.0,"I really like this dress but it shrank so much in the wash that I can't wear it without leggings underneath. Not a huge deal though, I've got tons of leggings."
4.0,"It's great to have these bright colored straps to help me find my conventional luggage.  They are not as heavy duty as I anticipated, but they get the job done."
4.0,These leotards are great quality and price. I knew they run small in advance. I got the 8-10 for my size 5 daughter as the 4-6 was getting too short in the torso. It's a little big but workable. We used the previous one every week from September through May. It held up beautifully with no pilling or fade that I noticed.
4.0,"I am 6' 1"" at 235 and bought the largest one they had.  I'm just able to squeeze into it but would have deffinitly preferred another 1 or 2 sizes bigger.  Using it for spring kayaking in MI.  It does serve its purpose."
4.0,"I love this barbell, the only issue I have is that it's a tad bit long. The turtle is adorable and it is good quality. The turtle is completely attached to the barbell and does not move. I had slight difficulty putting this in my piercing but it was not bad. Over all I love this especially because I love turtles!... Update, after wearing this for a few months the silver layer on both sides of the turtle wore off and caused infection in my ear. For those of you with sensitive skin, I suggest to stay away from this product."
4.0,"Good sweater, no problems. But not relaxed fit unless you get next size up. Warm."
4.0,loks good and price wasn't bad
4.0,I  bought it for my granddaughter for her home coming . It fit just perfect. She loved the fullness  of the dress.
4.0,If your a large go for an xl or even a 2x if u don’t like it snug<br />The fit isn’t true to size but overall I did like the colors and material
4.0,"Nice material, but not warm as i expect"
4.0,A little tight on the toes but still okay fit
4.0,"I purchased the dress in white and it fit absolutely perfect. The thing I’m disappointed in is that the color of the top was white (which is what I wanted) and the bottom was ivory. The pictures look like it’s all white so I was quite disappointed. However, after this customer service contacted me and made things right so I’m quite satisfied."
4.0,Great hat for sun (heat) protection.  Looks good also.  I just wish I could shape it as<br />good as the picture.
4.0,Nice jacket looks good
4.0,Pretty but not stunning. Expecting the gems attached to have a little more shimmer
4.0,Love this purse. Not as big as I thought it was going to be. Love that there are different size handles. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice purse.
4.0,"Update after wearing for a couple weeks. The color is a bit off of the expected brown and has a bit of a purple-ish color to it - if you will.  The leather is definitely decent quality and is very comfortable and fitting rather than the rigid leather you find with many inexpensive belts. Do note, it is a thin belt but not 80's style thin.  I recommend this belt as a nice addition to your collection.  I received this product at a discount for a fair and honest review."
4.0,They stick a bit out from the back of the earlobe but other than that very happy
4.0,Okay purchase. Not very impressed with these.
4.0,"I usually take a medium , but ordered a large . Glad I did , runs a little small. Nice shirt . Yes I would recommend ."
4.0,Nice but not great
4.0,"Great socks! After a 12 hour day, these really help my legs feel better. They ended up being a little too long, but that’s ok."
4.0,It fit perfectly. I was pleasantly suprised. I read the other reviews about ordering a size larger and it fits perfectly.
4.0,"As usual I wash every clothing item before I wear it and see how much, if any shrinkage has occurred, etc. This washes very nicely, following the directions. It is so soft and comfy I would wear it all day except I would feel like a lum. Great purchse!"
4.0,"The tag rubs your neck, but the arms are long enough to cover a tee shirt and the material has a nice hand."
4.0,"I like this belt a lot.  Seems like a quality belt.  Looks good with the texture (that's the version I got).  I wear it for work with suit and would even consider wearing it with more casual clothes.  Reversibility works well.  My one complaint -- I have to walk through metal detectors to go into a federal government building regularly for work and the buckle is just big enough to set those off.  It does not look any bigger or different than a regular belt buckle, but has just enough metal to do that.  I assume that is not a common workplace phenom, so if you don't have that issue this is a 5-star belt."
4.0,"Excellent product if you don't mind some maintenance with pliers every time the rings fall off.  Altogether a good product, lightweight and comfortable."
4.0,"I will be using this for my ballgown wedding dress. I am 5'8&#34; and it falls at tea-length for me and I am size 10 and I can't even et the velcro close, let alone touching. But, it has a tie and I can sew in a panel if needed. All I wanted was the breathable skirt So I don't sweat to death, and this will provide that. The hoops stand firm and hold out the skirt well. i figure for $25 I can handle a little &#34;rough around the edges&#34; under a dress."
4.0,"For the price, it's okay. Quality is just ok. Some seams are unraveling already. It's a good mid thigh length on me, I'm 5'6&#34; and an athletic 160 lbs. I got a medium."
4.0,"Bought this for my wife who has lots of scarves and is always looking to add to her collection. I thought having one with a pocket built in would be the next great thing. The material is not very heavy, I would say more like a t-shirt material thickness. While she said she liked it, she has had it for a few months now and not worn it."
4.0,comfortable Would like a slightly tighter fit. No problems with delivery!
4.0,Was exactly what its description states and was what I wanted & expected.
4.0,"I have really small wrist so bracelets like these are normally too big. It fits perfectly. I went out and a woman had a real one on and it was so similar, just the size is a little different. I saw reviews asking about getting it wet. I kept it out of water when hand washing. Will definitely get the black one next."
4.0,Ordered this as a gift. The receiver liked it but wished it was a little larger. :( I think it's perfect! It's a cute gift for any dog lover!
4.0,It came in just in time. Fit nicely. A little worried that it would not survive the washer though so I hand washed mine. Over all happy
4.0,Material a little cheap and needs to be soaked in softener. The holes are placed ok on my shirt so I can wear with a bralette.<br />Runs a little small so buy a size up. The holes are a little itchy because of the way they made them.
4.0,"Nice material but zipper was easily broken, loved the design. Definitely should continue making these"
4.0,"The daylight vangough was super cute but came damaged with a dent in the corner of the wallet. Otherwise, great!"
4.0,It's very light weight. Not very many pockets tho
4.0,Looks good. Need accessories. It's sorta plain. Yes I know it's a plain purple dress. Love that it has pockets
4.0,"This is such a cute swimsuit! I have been trying to find a high waisted swimsuit to hide my sad saggy mommy tummy after having 3 kids! Even though I have lost all the weight things just aren't the same so I figured a high waisted suit would do the job! I ordered a medium because I always need a little bigger on top to accommodate nursing boobs! I wish you could order the tops and bottoms separately because the bottoms were a little too big and the top was much too small. The cups are like too close together or something and the girls were spilling out of the top, bottoms and sides haha!!!  My pant size is a 0 or 2 and bra is 34D to give you an idea of what size you might need to buy. I ended up giving the suit to a friend since I couldn't fit in it but I really wish it would have fit me because it was so cute!"
4.0,"Bought this thinking my 3-year old would be able to use it as her trick-or-treat bag for her Ariel Halloween costume.<br /><br />On the one hand, its super cute, vibrantly colored and very soft. It will make an adorable addition to her costume, and since she is a big fan of The Little Mermaid I think she will want to keep this out all year (not just for her Halloween costume).<br /><br />On the other hand, it is much smaller than the picture led me to believe and will definitely not work to hold her trick-or-treating candy. He's more of a stuffed toy than a purse, and the stuffing in him makes the opening for the ""purse"" very squashed. You won't fit much in it. Which for a toddlers purse is probably fine (she doesn't most of the time have much she needs to carry around), but as a candy-bag definitely won't work. And for the size the price seems too high....<br /><br />Buuuut....as a stuffed toy for a Little Mermaid obsessed toddler, its kind of perfect."
4.0,Not as long as I had hoped it would be
4.0,"good quality, but something small for me!!!!"
4.0,Decent but you have to tie it tight to keep it on
4.0,"I love the idea of these glasses, and when my daughter is wearing them, I am very glad that her eyes are protected. I believe in the usefulness and purpose of these glasses and will continue to use them often because I agree that it is important to protect her eyes from the sun.<br /><br />I also laugh a little on the inside when she is wearing them, as the wraparound style of the glasses looks a little funny, reminding me of the awkwardness of a kid in their night brace or a pet wearing a cone.<br /><br />I would suggest to the designers of this product that they look into putting some kind of non-slip material right at the back on the inside of the straps to help keep them from sliding down on soft or straight hair - kind of like the stuff they put on non-slip barrettes and ponytail holders. They constantly slide down the back of my daughter's head and need to be readjusted often."
4.0,"Just know, the top is kinda like a crop top (i didn't realize that) and if you pull the shorts up to cover your stomach, then your butt cheeks hang out. The string to tie the shorts are fake too. You can't tighten them. Other than that, I really like them."
4.0,These shirts run a little on the small side.  I love the fabric and if I had gotten at least one size if not 2 sizes larger I would be much more comfortable.
4.0,Fits very well. Very comfortable.
4.0,The item I got was not at all as described. That was a bummer after waiting a while for it but the refund was quick and they allowed me to keep the product so 4 stars for great customer service
4.0,"These earrings are really cute, the belly area of the owls is pinkish and kind of translucent. They are sooo much bigger than I expected them to be, as well, half an inch wide and little over half an inch long, they are also quite heavy. I bent the post (which is Very long and thick) while trying to put the backing on, they are very weak. Also, because the earrings are so heavy you will probably need plastic disk backings like I did, otherwise the top of the earring won't touch your earlop. Although not entirely what I expected, I'm  still pretty satisfied!"
4.0,My son loved them. The only reason I gave 4 stars is the package was straight from China.
4.0,"I really like this case, it very pretty & it's my favorite color. Arrived sooner than expected so that was an added bonus. Thanks so much!"
4.0,"This stylish, quirky hat has a semi firm brim I wish were a touch stiffer, as it bends ever so slightly but not enough to be a floppy hat either. Aside from that, it is simply built and uses color blocking for an interesting look.<br />The velvet band is full removable, so you can always switch it with something else if you like, but you definitely have to use something because it hides some very visible stitching.<br /><br />The style is really neat and makes a statement, so if you like the photo, you’ll definitely like the hat!"
4.0,"Love them but the center stone shakes a little, I'm hoping it doesn't fall out because they are so gorgeous!!"
4.0,Packaged well. Works well. Satisfied.
4.0,"Cute, the ruffle is not as dramatic as pictured but it’s a cute evening gown."
4.0,It's a little different then you'd think. But still a great cover up for lounging around the pool.
4.0,I wish the beads were a little bigger. Im not sure if a grown man can fit this... we'll see ..other than that.. Great !
4.0,"Really cute dress and fits very well.<br />The beads do fall off, so if you have young kids or pets i Would be careful"
4.0,"Scarf, wrap, shawl, mantilla, whatever you call it this is a versatile part of any wardrobe.  It’s great to take on vacation because it’s a multi-purpose accessory that can be used day or night.  This is oversized but can be rolled to fit in a tiny corner of your carry-on.  Good choice that serves many purposes."
4.0,"nice and the small if good for a very slim guy, hopefully it won't shrink...really nice and looks like in the picture"
4.0,It arrived neatly folded and packaged up well. I tried it on and it is very cute and a good length for a swimsuit cover up. It is sheer but not too much to where it is pointless to even have it as a cover up.
4.0,My boyfriend started using my leggings under his workout shorts and I knew there was a problem. So I figured it is time he gets his own and stops taking mine. He loves them!
4.0,Purchased for my daughter for her trip to Disney
4.0,"Giving a four star just because I haven't actually worn this to work yet but first impressions are great! Looks exactly like the pictures but it is a little big considering I have very thick hair and a fat head. My plan is to wear the headband underneath for stray hairs and use the ribbon on the back to tighten the cap a little. The headband buttons are placed right above my ears, so I'll probably use those one for masks. All in all very happy with my purchase!!"
4.0,"The zipper gets stuck, but it’s VERY warm and VERY flattering."
4.0,"Pretty good glasses, do cut glare some at night in rain, but rest of time I can't tell a lot of difference.  Nothing to do w ith the glasses, but it was shipped by Amazon in a flimsy barely padded envelope, the box the glasses were in smashed, but amazingly the glasses were fine."
4.0,"I am confounded by something taking nearly 6 weeks to arrive but...that being said...It's a good quality piece of clothing.  It is NOT a sports bra as stated.  More like a casual bra.  The straps give too much for it to be a sports bra.  In other words...support is not it's best feature.  But, for casual wear it's great and for the price you can't beat it.  If the delivery timeframe had been reasonable I'd have given it 4 stars.<br />*Update*  It's been a few months since I recieved this purchase and I am impressed with the quality so much so that I've ordered 3 more.  Knowing ahead of time how long they will take to arrive helps greatly.  Because of the quality of the item I'm upping my rating from 3 stars to 4.<br />**Update** - my second order took about half the time to arrive as the first one.  The quality is still great."
4.0,Nice stylist bag
4.0,Nice quality!  Runs big.
4.0,"Really cute tank top and funny little saying for my wine loving friend’s birthday gift, she loves it, we went up a size to an extra large and it fits great.  She loves that it’s not too tight around her stomach.  We’ve attached a video for y’all to see!🎉🍷🥂 Cheers!"
4.0,I like them very much.  I like that they're light on your face.  I've had a few compliments. 👍
4.0,Bought a medium based on reviews that the skirt ran small. So glad I did! The skirt looks better than pictured. Fabric quality is excellent and not see through. I would recommend a size up just to be on the safe side even if you have the slightest bit of curves. Isn't too tight around the hip area and fits my waist perfect which is usually an issue with unbelted skirts or pants. Arrived in great timing. Smooth transaction! Wish they had more polka dot colors. I'd buy all of them. I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,Needed this suit for a fun Christmas performance and it did not disappoint.  The battery operated lights in the suit coat are great!  Material is what you would expect to get with a suit designed like this and the price.
4.0,Bien para su precio y a tiempo
4.0,"I want to apologize for my other comment where I stated that I had not received these pendant converters.  I wasn't at peace about not finding them and decided to unwrap the one gift that had the t-shirts in it to see if they were on the bottom of the box and I just didn't search very well.  And, they were there which was great!  Again, I apologize and looking at them, I like these better than the other ones I have.<br /><br />Merry Christmas"
4.0,Size up! But great for the price! I usually wear a S or M and ordered an XL. Perfect fit at that size.
4.0,It's a nice lightweight hat.  It's a little snug.
4.0,This band fits my watch and stays put!  Would like to know if it's washable though.
4.0,Beautiful dress but way too long. I had to hold it up to walk.
4.0,They were just what was pictured. worked perfectly for the project
4.0,"The sizing is on point, and the dress is really stretchy. It's really an adorable dress, well all except one problem with it, it's extremely short. I read the reviews before I bought it and thought to myself it couldn't possibly be that short. Well it's true this dress is short. I put yoga shorts on underneath, I also tried it with leggings. It'seems still wearable and such a comfortable dress.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review of it. I do not let a discounted price of any product  influence  my opinion or views of a product. I was not offered any sort of discount or compensation for a better review. I am not in  any way affiliated with this company or Amazon. All of the above opinions are honest and my own."
4.0,"Good for layering. The necklace is delicate and is much smaller than it appears in the photo. Shorter than a toothpick and simple. Cute and dainty again good for layering with other necklaces or to wear alone, made in Thailand stamped 925."
4.0,The fabric is similar to a cheap reuseable bag.
4.0,pretty decent shirt
4.0,Beautiful dress but was too big had to return it ..
4.0,I ordered a double xl which I'm glad I did cause it just fit if I order another one I will definitely get a 3xl.
4.0,I ordered a size larger than my measurements called for but they were too small and the tops  were much too tight and cut painfully into my calves.<br />  They are a good heavy material and the open toes were nice to have.
4.0,"ScoteVest makes a wonderful product and we have a few of them. However, I had to return this because it was too heavy for our weather and would never wear it."
4.0,"It's long enough, but the spacers in between are too small for more than a couple keys on each side. I can't put more than 4 on it. Good thing I only have 4 keys. :)"
4.0,"Runs a tad large (I am smack in the middle of the measurements for a small and I had a little extra room) and the zipper is flimsy (I’m concerned it won’t hold up long). For the price, however, it’s a flattering and comfortable dress in a great color."
4.0,I just dosnt like the fact he had brown elbow patches but I love the product
4.0,Cute necklace but it is on the cheap end so there is some discoloration after only wearing a few times.
4.0,"I liked it, though I definetly would have gotten a way smaller size to make it more of a choker. I did not realize at the time that I wouldn't be able to adjust it, until I got it. I will be changing the necklace though to make it a choker. But this is really pretty and goes with any outfit!!"
4.0,Great hat for Easter.  Matches dress I have.
4.0,"Nothing like what I expected. Very small & it's to be for men or woman? It' smaller then I would like for even me! This was the first time I recieved something I was dissappointed in, I kept it it is a nice piece just way smaller then expected. Sorry. It came up when I was searching for a mens pendent for my grandson. I still gave it a four because it was nice, just not what I needed."
4.0,"The bag is absolutely beautiful! It’s spacious and I love the snap in insert bag. I’ve used it everyday for about a month and have had absolutely no issues with it and is holding up great!! My ONLY issue with it (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that it does have a very peculiar odor on the inside. It’s not so bad that you smell just holding the purse but while you’re digging for something in it you will smell it. I can’t describe the smell. It’s an odd chemical smell maybe and obviously from the pu leather that it’s made of. I tried spraying perfume inside of it and it only made it smell like a perfume/chemical. Although over time it has lessened. So I’m betting that within another month or so it will be completely gone. All that being said, it wasn’t enough to make me return or not use the bag. Its just a not so great quality."
4.0,This is a very comfortable dress and wonderful for a warm spring day! I only wish it had pockets.
4.0,So pretty but the heart fell off during first time use.  Was still able to function it and clip it where I needed but I could see how this could be an issue for some customers.
4.0,"I purchased the 5/8"" opalite flared tear drop plugs and they are a tad small for my ears. I definitely wouldn't wear these if I were to be moving around a ton. Other than that, they seem really well made and they're very pretty."
4.0,Cute and fun but too heavy to throw directly at TV.
4.0,the suspenders are to small for me
4.0,"I like them, they're cute. I should have sized up but they still fit! I ordered a medium."
4.0,I'm 5'2 and this garment's length just didn't suite me.  It came to almost mid calf.  too short to ear it alone with boots and too long to wear with pants.  I could have hemmed it up a bit and wore it with loose fitting pants and it would have looked great.  I also had to roll up the sleeves because I didn't like where they fell.  Bottom line is that I'm just not cool enough to pull off this look.
4.0,"Very cheap. Gets the job done, but starts to fray at the patch seams after a wash or two. For the price not bad though."
4.0,"Arrived with minor damage from packaging, but I was able to repair it.  The style and color are as advertised."
4.0,"I bought these 2 weeks ago on July 9th, 2019 and so far my son loves them and loves wearing them. The only thing I don't like about them is they gave him blisters on the side of both his feet. But other than that it's still going good."
4.0,"This was pretty good quality for such an inexpensive suit. It was comfortable and looked pretty good, helped me get swimming after some weight gain from medical issues. I bought it at last minute before summer vacation so really relieved it worked. Sizing is small, which another reviewer pointed out, so I recommend ordering size up."
4.0,We've only used it once and it worked well
4.0,"Nice soft cotton feel. Great appearance. All the stiching looks solid, the snaps are well made as well. All in all, this is a quality product. I am looking forward to wearing it often. (Only one caution. This shirt comes with a couple small straight pins in it to keep it folded for packing. Just give it a once over to make sure they are all removed before trying it on)<br /><br />Upon further inspection, the tag says 65% polyester, 35% rayon and 100% polyester lining. So I'm a bit confused how the description says 100% cotton??? I must say I'm disappointed. For this price I was expecting cotton."
4.0,"Fits well, good material. Very satisfied."
4.0,"They work just fine for me, just make sure you attach them facing the right way or you risk damaging your joy con. Other than that, no issues here. :)"
4.0,Runs small so order larger than usually look at the size chart and exactly by that. I wear a 12-14 I had to order a XXL. It hugs every curve....so keep that in mind when ordering. Its a cute little dress.
4.0,"Good product, but not better than Sigvaris.  I probably will not purchase again."
4.0,"I am actually wearing the jeans as I write this review.  Comfort wise, they are okay.  Slim fit is true, the legs and butt are form fitting but not too tight.  There is plenty of room in the crotch so that I don't feel restricted like other slim fit jeans.  My favorite part is the zipper is nice and long so that I do not have to take down my pants to take a leak.  The front pockets are not as deep as most jeans.  Actually, I think the pockets are the shallowest ones I have for any pair of jeans.  There is some stretch to the jeans so the slim fit is not as bad as it could be because it moves with you.  The color is nice and solid but I have noticed some fading after several washings, especially on the top of the thighs.  Overall, nice jeans but not my favorite cut.  I will go with more of a relaxed fit next time."
4.0,"Super cute, but arrived with the left nose pad piece broken off; will be returning them. :(<br /><br />Update 08/09/2018: The company reached out to me, and offered me to try out another pair at no extra cost to me (I ordered a different pair from this one, to avoid the possibility of the nose piece breaking off again). Props to the company for doing so; I'm updating it from two stars to four."
4.0,Fabric was somewhat thin.
4.0,"Very pleased. It’s a good size for all the essentials I need to carry, and I don’t lose anything in it. I guess I didn’t realize it’s perforated all the way through—as in, there’s no solid liner. Not sure why its made that way , but it’s not an issue for me. I can’t imagine what I’d ever be carrying that could fall through."
4.0,Very pretty and dainty but sturdy. Just received it so hope it holds up well. Looks like real gold.
4.0,The material on this tshirt is fabulous.  The color of the tshirt is beautiful shade of green. Maybe ordering more soon.
4.0,I love the top! The bottoms have a lot of sticky residue from the sticker protector that suits come with it for trying on. The bottoms were a little cheeky for me so I got a different pair anyway.
4.0,"I love statement and funky piece jewelry items to wear.  These are pretty comfortable rings.  I wear a variety of sizes ranging from a 7 to 10 (standard ring position).  As stated these are adjustable rings and they do lean towards a more masculine look and design.  The bands are wider and thicker.  However, about 1/2 are thin enough to compliment my bone structure and don't feel overly bulky or like I am wearing my ""boyfriends' ring and I need to tape it up.  It was pretty easy to adjust the size (press in or with mild pressure adjust band out)  Most of the rings are in a bright high polish silver which I didn't like as much as the darker rings.  The snake ring oddly enough is by far the coolest ring, fantastic color, great fit and look amazing.  It is the perfect statement ring.  Not a bad price point.  I would put a clear coat on the high silver rings as some did leave tarnish marks on the skin, not all but some."
4.0,"It is a bit shear and somewhat see through, but it’s fine if you wear nude undergarments! Super cute dress!"
4.0,"This was a nice dress, but the color is more of a cranberry. But the material is good and the fit is nice."
4.0,"It looks really cool .... I had lots of compliments .... I wore it with my Chucky costume .... and, I might even wear it for other occasions just to freak people out ... lol ... But, anyone buying this should know that it can come with some wrinkles and bends to the rubber .... I had to lay it flat on the bathroom counter and use my blow dryer to heat it up and then press it into shape and make it flat ..... (which does work fine) .... It's a worthy buy."
4.0,Didn’t match the metal on my watch. Much brighter and more pink than my watch.  I’ll try it and maybe it will fade.
4.0,"This watch is of excellent quality considering the low price.  Easy to read, light weight, and low profile are also a plus.  Great value!"
4.0,"Way to tight. I bought for my daughter, I wasn't able to see it on her. She wasn't crazy about the color combination. I looked like it would have been a nice dress, too bad it was too tight."
4.0,"This wallet has the wrist strap I prefer, but it's tight for space. With my S8 phone in it, not much room for anything else. Zipper is taxed with phone in the wallet."
4.0,"Very nice quality dress, exactly as pictured, except color. I ordered navy xxl and dress is more of a light greenish blue. I usually order xl( 16 top, 10 bottom), I was concerned about my broad shoulders and carry my weight up top. Fit is perfect, dress is very billowy in front, just like picture. Material seems to be nice weight linen. I'd order another but I don't know what color I'd receive. I really wanted navy, * I've lowered my review to 4 stars since I see company changed color name from navy to celestial blue. That does seem accurate for color they are NOW showing, but color was navy when I ordered it."
4.0,"Not much fabric to cover on this, good as a body suit with shorts but not as a bathing suit"
4.0,Happy with the look and feel
4.0,"Bought these for an '80s costume. So far, they look nice and feel comfortable. I followed other reviewers' recommendations and went a half size up, and I found it to be completely unnecessary. I'm typically a 7.5, bought these in an 8, and they're big on me. Keeping the ones I ordered because I don't feel like going through the hassle of returning."
4.0,Thankfully I checked reviews before I ordered this.  It is slightly large on her now but she will have outgrown it in about six months.  Definitely buy a size larger than you think you need!  I can't imagine she'd even fit in it by the time she was 4.  The color is burgundy and very pretty.
4.0,"gave as a gift, recipient says it looks good and fits well."
4.0,Liked it. It's for sleep
4.0,"It is very stylish and convenient.  The color is perfect fit my own personality, and it totally fit my daily dresses' color."
4.0,"Reading the other reviews stating &#34;these run small,&#34; they do.  I normally wear an 11 but I got a 12 and it fits great with and without socks.  I wanted a boot that I could quickly throw on and take my dog out in the snow, and the zipper is easy and accomplished what I was looking for.  They do have a crinkle sound when putting them on, so I'm not sure what material is underneath the leg part, but my feet are warm and dry (I usually just throw on sweats, coat, and boots w/out socks and my feet have never been cold).  I would buy these again, but I'd probably buy a size up.  I gave four stars because the material around the leg doesn't feel as sturdy as other winter boots, but these will work for lighter snow activities."
4.0,The arm sleeves are like cool looking pantyhose for your arm ..  I am a truck driver and my left arm always is in the sun and used them on a 10 hour drive worked vary well.  They should last about 2-3 weeks per arm sleeve maybe less then that at work but defiantly keeps my arm from cooking in the sun
4.0,Fit as expected but wouldn't recommend for undividuals with a long torso. Super cute and vibrant colors.
4.0,I bought this for a night gown and that is all I would were it for very thin but comfortable
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for,  it does have a smell to it that took a bit to subside but I am happy with it!"
4.0,"I was surprised to see these sold by the maker,  Sojos, and for much cheaper than on their website. They also were sold out on their website but so happy I found them on Amazon. I would buy these again as I do enjoy wearing them but I will say they are a bit too light weight."
4.0,I had ordered hotshot underwear before and the legs didn't come down as far as I expected. These fit perfectly and were just what I wanted.
4.0,"My daughter likes them to wear over her tank tops to school because of dress codes, but it sheds on too her clothes."
4.0,Item was just what I was looking for.  A bit small though
4.0,"These are super cute, but my daughter is either a size 3 or 4.  I simply ordered the wrong size.  Am ordering in the next size up.  They're super cute and my very picky seven-year-old really liked how they looked."
4.0,Love! Love! Love! Especially being 33 weeks pregnant. Got lots of compliments on this dress.
4.0,"Great replacement for my Ugg slipper insoles. After a few years they have become very worn, now good as new!  I will get a second set for my other ones too!"
4.0,Very happy with the quality of these gloves.
4.0,I bought this for a gift for a teacher and was happy with the quality.
4.0,"Arrived very fast. From the photo, I was expecting a thick shearling/sheepskin coat. This isn't that. It's a leather coat with a thin layer of fur inside. Not warm enough for what I wanted, and the fit is off for me, but quality seems good."
4.0,"Nice bag! It is a bit bigger than what I would consider a wristlet, but I'd say that adds to its versatility."
4.0,"It’s not as long and baggy as I was hoping it to be. I’m 5’9 and it fits like a typical shirt on me. I was hoping to have it as some lounge around the house with the kids clothes but it’s not going to work for that. Definitely NOT long enough to wear with leggings. But overall, it’s a nice enough shirt. I’m keeping it. Will just have to wear it with jeans. It’s also pretty thin. When I took it out of the bag and held it up, it was see through. Will have to wear a tank top underneath."
4.0,Great fit as expected and great material<br /> Not too tight on the arms and I'm happy with it (so far). I tend to have issues with my deodorant/BO smell over time sticking on my underarmor wear. We will see after a few washes how it goes (if no follow up review then I have no issues!)
4.0,Cute item however one of the fingers broke but I'm still able to wear it so it's ok.
4.0,I was a bit disappointed with the packaging. But I still like it.
4.0,"I'm pretty sure I ordered this hat in the 0-6 month size and it is HUGE!  I have to fold the cuff under (not rolled out) or else the Moby emblem won't show.  Still cute, and I love knot hats.  Matches perfect with my Eggplant Moby and organic purple Moby BabyLegs.  Just know that it will be very big, 0-6 months will probably fit your 1 year old."
4.0,I use these at the gym. They are comfortable.
4.0,it's very pretty but the fabric is very thin.
4.0,"This cardigan is very nice and wish I could have kept it, but unfortunately it’s super long in the arms.  It hung about 1 inch over the tips if fingers.  It’s sad because it fit so nicely everywhere else.  I’m 5ft 4in, 150lbs, 36DD, 28 inch waist.  Had to return it 😕"
4.0,Didn't work out of the box.  My opener has a purple learn button but these were originally configured for red/orange.  I was pretty sure it was the switch setting but couldn't identify the switch until I saw a picture of it in one of the other reviews.  It would be helpful if the instructions covered configuration and included a picture of the switch. Once I flipped the switch everything was fine
4.0,"Got this as a gift for my sister, and she loves it. She is 5""0, and very slim. I got her a size small, which fit her nicely, with a little extra room. The material is a bit cheap, overall, pretty decent. Great for cosplaying and Halloween. Would recommend!"
4.0,Just OK. The tabs on the side that help keep it in place dig in and become annoying after a while.
4.0,"These have been the most comfortable, cute, and functional shorts. My only complaint is they’ve begun to pill some in the hiney area from sitting on my front stoop. But I love them and the pockets are amazing. Great value for sure!"
4.0,It’s a little more cropped than what’s shown in the picture but I still loved the look of it.
4.0,"I would have given this watchband a &#34;5,&#34; but it took a very long time to get it.  It comes without instructions of any kind, so it took me a little while to figure out how to adjust for size.  Once you finally get it and figure out how to adjust it, the watchband is a pretty good buy.  It's heavy and durable and looks more expensive than it is.  The only concern I have is the durability of the clasp.  It seems a little flimsy compared to the rest of the band.  Given all that, I still think it gets a solid &#34;4&#34; review."
4.0,Used for leather seats and they did the job
4.0,exelent for the gym
4.0,Very nice. Fit well according to the size chart. The top is a little drapey but it still looks good. It is the perfect combo to dress up or dress down. Think I'll take this on my next cruise.
4.0,"Not quite as &#34;gripping&#34; as toe socks, but also not as expensive.  Work well for most positions."
4.0,"It's very soft and cozy, and the colors are pretty. I just wish it was smaller. It is quite huge, and I may actually return it."
4.0,I needed these for my 2yr old Grandson when He came for a visit. The fit was Great. The back strap did tend to push his feet forward but He seemed to walk just fine & actually kept them on his feet. YAY...
4.0,"I've worn this dress to work and out, everytime I've gotten compliments!!  Good fabric, could wash and air dry. The qualoty is great for the price!"
4.0,I should have paid more attention to the other reviews which for the most part said the top runs small.  In honesty in runs very small and long as in a tunic length.  Kudos to Amazon for the easy return.
4.0,"It's not leather but it's large, with extra pockets.  Bought it to carry art supplies for a workshop outside.  Didn't want anything precious.  I think this will fit the bill and it's kind of attractive for what it is.  Will update after I use it."
4.0,"The ball was kind of hard to unscrew. Other than that, they were great and super cute."
4.0,"Seems small, but I bought it for a Halloween costume to wrap around my waist."
4.0,I love this ring however it is not true to size. I bought a size 7 and it didn't fit but was a bit bigger than a size 6.  I had to return it and buy the size 8.  It is a very delicate ring so becareful or you will bend it.  Don't put it in your pocket.
4.0,"Not baggy and a bit short, but very warm."
4.0,"Cat eye is one of my favorite shapes because it goes well my my square shape face.<br /><br />These glasses look super nice and I liked the color very nice. They are polarized, which helps with glare in bright light."
4.0,But for my niece and she loved it
4.0,"Good bang for your buck, nice quality and accessories to install on watch pleased with my purchase! I don't think much of the screen protector I'll buy another."
4.0,a gift for my wife
4.0,"This is a really pretty bracelet.  I like it much more in person than I expected to.  It's not overly large and the stones are quite pretty.  I think they might be dyed, but they are still quite nice.  They are real, not plastic.<br /><br />Very pleased."
4.0,Got this to use for popping a gender reveal balloon. We had to sharpen the pin tip but it worked well. It's kind of flimsy and bends easily. It worked for our purposes.
4.0,"Putting on decorative arm sleeves is easier however, the plain colored sleeves seem to offer more of the compression effect."
4.0,These are actually quite nice. I get so many compliments on them and no one can believe I got them off amazon. They do run a little bigger than I would have liked but I wear them often anyway. I am 5'8 135lbs
4.0,I think it's a beautiful gift !!!
4.0,"Not same as the originals, but significantly less money.  Seem to be okay so far, although clear that not same as OEM"
4.0,Very light and soft cardigan. True to size and so comfy. I will definately be ordering another one. Glad I checked this one out.
4.0,"Nice hat, nothing super special, 8 year old son was happy so I'll give it 4 stars!"
4.0,Cute suit for the price.  Not super supportive up top but still cute for a fun suit.
4.0,The p j ‘s were nice but so wrinkled at delivery. They were a gift.
4.0,"Love the zipper and the colors.  I am 5’1” and usually wear a size 8 bathing suit so I ordered a medium, but it a bit snug."
4.0,I haven't worn it but it looks just like the pictures.
4.0,Super sweet little anklet!  Great design and a surprisingly decent quality for the price.  Runs a little large and wouldn't do terribly well for a small or petite ankle.  Overall great buy!
4.0,The dress is beautiful and it fit just as it should. The only disappointment I had with the dress was the cheesy bows. Other than that the dress itself is very pretty!
4.0,I like the patterns on these stocking. They are tighter and harder to get on and off. Once you get then on they feel great.
4.0,Adorable! I wear this with my summer dresses and I tend to get compliments on it.
4.0,"Fun and versatile, not terribly durable but that’s to be expected."
4.0,My only regret is that I wish they sold a &#34;left&#34; ear so that I could wear two. This cant be worn on both ears.
4.0,"These are nice glasses, look nice and fit pretty good. Would recommend, come in variety of colors. I like them!!!!"
4.0,"I ordered 1 size up. The bottoms fit perfect. I've got quiet a little extra in back, but not a whole lot up top, So I figure top can be adjusted. The cups for the top piece are fairly large, but it fits and feels great. Would totally recommend. I love my new suit"
4.0,"It is very attractive, but the weight of the stones brings it down a bit in time and one has to adjust it."
4.0,Looks like the original laces to my son's ridiculously expensive pair of shoes that he can't keep tied.
4.0,"I love the boot color and fits true to size.  Easy to get on and off (no inner zipper) and look great, fairly comfortable.  My only complaint, if any, is that the soles were very slippery on slick office floors."
4.0,"I only gave it 4 stars bc the sizing was off. My son is normally a youth large and this youth large is much bigger then I expected. Otherwise he absolutely LOVES the shirt. The material is more of a wicking, so it is not cotton and no matter how many times I dry it, it's not shrinking."
4.0,"It’s cute but has a weird leather tie with feathers on it, which is weird but I just cut it off. Otherwise a nice piece."
4.0,Very weak material.
4.0,I loved how real they look.
4.0,"I am a 34C and 140 lbs, the top fit great but the bottoms were on the smaller side. Definitely go up one size!!"
4.0,In using essential oils on the bracelets it weakens the elastic string and sometimes it breaks at the most inopportune time.
4.0,"The visual aspect of the camisoles are pretty, but as a 5'6 athletic build it doesn't fit me quite as I hoped. When I leave it untucked it just looks boxy and doesn't hit me at the right point on my waist and when I tuck it then the sides get baggy and just make me look boxy. It's very possible that I just need to improve how I'm styling it but the material isn't as flowy as I hoped and is a little more stiff which is why I think it's boxing on the sides the way it does. Also, I am bigger chested (normally a 34DDD and currently breastfeeding so even bigger and the tops were a little tight there and didn't fit my figure how I hoped it would. But as for the color and feel of the fabric it is nice and the colors are beautiful."
4.0,Figure flattering which I like but not tight in the stomach. Love the pockets. The neck is a big strange but I can live with it. I'd buy it again.
4.0,Super cute and I love that they have a button so you can turn them on/off. I wore them to a night time Jack-o'-lantern event and received so many compliments!
4.0,"These are the first pair of goggles we've ever owned that have lasted for the entire summer and are still wearable.  The edges aren't bent in or fused to the sides.  My kids said they were comfortable, but they were disappointed that the anti-fog treatment didn't work for more than a few uses.  We were super careful to keep fingers off the lenses and rinse in fresh water after use, but that didn't seem to matter.  We did love the cases."
4.0,"I give it a 4, it's a beautiful dress!! The color is great and is just like the picture... but is a little tighter than I thought it was going to be. I'm 5'1 and 110 pounds and got and XS and I wish I got the small"
4.0,NIce suit but the cup size is very small. not enough coverage.
4.0,Its good my son love it
4.0,I like it but it's very hard to open.
4.0,Lol OMG if your kid likes to jump in puddles at the age of 3-4 make sure you know they will have a lot of water in boots and soaked socks... I sure was a fun time and we didn't mind at all. Just left them on the porch before entering the house.
4.0,I love them. I just wish the sleeves were a touch longer. I have four different colors!
4.0,"I wear rather wide frames and these fit over them perfectly.  They do a decent job of handling the sun.  (Unfortunately not as well as my old, scratched BluBlockers), but they do the job.  The flip up feature is nice.  And they're made well. I'm not totally convinced they are polarized but I haven't really evaluated that carefully.  If they were a bit darker, I'd give them 5 stars. Still a good buy."
4.0,"Material is very smooth like silk, however the banding seems to fold over regularly and I don't even have the belly to fold over the banding. Not really a big issue and fits as expected. Hugs nicely without cinching yourself down there. Definitely wouldn't sport these for daily wear more than active wear for brief periods of time. Worth the purchase."
4.0,"Just a tad smaller than I was expecting, but still look good. I would strongly suggest you handwash these, otherwise they are not going to last. The lace begins to break down after one trip through the washing machine. They are cute, but not durable."
4.0,"I love these under tee. Tight neck so be aware ,<br />I don't fold I just bunch it. Hides wrinkle neck without being too hot"
4.0,Love these earrings… I'm not sure why anyone says it difficult to put on in fact I find them very simple. The only reason four stars instead of five is that I wish they were slightly thicker
4.0,"sporty and keep most of the breeze out for the price. Tint does a nice job during the day,  would recommend the style to anyone."
4.0,"Looks good, just a little sheer"
4.0,"I likw the style of this blouse, very cute."
4.0,"Nicely made, took a long time to arrive."
4.0,"I think this one was sewn improperly, otherwise, the quality is good. I purchased this same style from another seller in a different pattern and it fit how I expect based on reviews. This one had very small cups compared to the other one. The sewing where the skirting is attached to the suit was tight and felt as though it would break. I mention these issues because I have read several reviews of these suits and had seen a couple (very few) sighting sewing problems. I do recommend this suit, but order and assume you may have to exchange if you get an oddball."
4.0,Really cute dress but material is thin
4.0,"It holds the stuff I usually carry: wallet, cheque book. 2 cell phones, small pencil case and small diary. The only problem is that things fall down, do not stay upright once you take out anything, which to be expected.<br /><br />Typical Kipling quality with professional finish. Wanted a black one, but there was none, a pretty red though."
4.0,love this dress got great compliments. i could have gone with a medium but a large was cute as well. i am 5&#34;2 170 lbs.
4.0,Not sure why they are so long - not a particularly bad feature.
4.0,Love love love the dress so much it’s absolutely stunning! But not for bigger chested women. I will not be returning it however because it’s everything I was looking for in a dress as a wedding guest. It will just take a lot of finesse to find a way to wear this dress & not flash anybody at the same time.
4.0,"Size is way off. Great pair of pants if it fit. I was hoping the size 18/20 would fit my kid, but it's more a size 14. Too bad...they look and feel awesome."
4.0,"Nice quality, pretty nice dress."
4.0,A large is not very large. A very difficult band to change.
4.0,This product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.
4.0,For the first year and half it was awesome. I guess i use up all it's life.<br />The clips don't grip the shirt like it used to when i first pick this up 2 years ago.
4.0,"This dress is comfortable, fits well, and I enjoy the pattern. I am 5’8” and 160 and typically wear a large. Amazon recommended a medium, which fits and isn’t too tight, but I wonder how much bigger the large would have been. I like the neckline because it’s looser than a typical t-shirt style. And the dress has pockets! ☺️ It is not knee length on me (which is why I need the tights), and the material is on the thin side (I wear a slip; otherwise, you can see my bra slightly), but the price is nice! I have worn this dress several times and really enjoy it."
4.0,I expected a different type of material but the pants are fine and fit well.
4.0,Very short. Lies BELOW ankle bone. Feels like they’re going to slip off my heels.  I wear size 7.5 US shoes.
4.0,A little cheap feeling but very nice. Got many compliments. Very nice paired with a belt. Length was nice. Not too hot not too light. Wrinkles came out easily with a clothing steamer. Held up well after wash which was my concern.
4.0,"Love the necklace. Durable in water aside from paint wearing, which doesn't ruin it. One issue is the slipknot came undone very quickly. I'd reccomend being careful with it when taking on and off."
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable. The picture is deceiving be ause it is not long. Pants come above my ankles. I am 5’4” 125 lbs and ordered a medium. I’m happy with it overall but if you’re wanting floor length, you’ll be disappointed. Ankle length, you’re dead on! I may order in another color!"
4.0,"LOVE this suit, and I hate myself in bathing suits! The pattern is gorgeous and it fits perfect! I'm 5'3&#34; and 158 lbs and the large fits perfect! Helps camoflauge my post kids belly! THE ONLY THING I noticed that I don't like is when you're swimming the cups act as, well, CUPS! The water gets in them and pulls them down when you swim, had a few times where my boobs almost came out ! lol, other than that totally love this suit!!!"
4.0,"These work great as replacements for my Oakley Juliet sunglasses.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I had to trim off some of the excess material on the ear socks  with a blade (from the molding process, I guess).  The temple shocks were fine and I had no problems with them.  They're not the same high quality as Oakley parts, but so far they're fine."
4.0,I got these pants in black. I like the back elastic waist. They fit fine. The material is thin and wrinkles. They are comfortable and are perfect for casual days.
4.0,"In brief, very good quality but may present issues with airline travel.<br />This Carry on is well-constructed and can contain at least two suits. It is however bigger than it looks in the picture, and although it has a strap on the back to allow you to attach it to a regular carry-on, it felt too big to put on mine. I have not traveled with it yet, but I am not sure if airlines would consider this my ""personal item"" or if they will count it as a carry on."
4.0,Works great feel safer driving at night now
4.0,"shirt is super cute,but runs a size small."
4.0,These worked great for fishing!!!!!... but get yourself some straps to attach so you don't knock them off your face and loose them in the river like i did on the 2nd day of my trip
4.0,"This dress is super cute and comfy.  Fits as expected, but maybe a little tight in the chest.  That happens to me sometimes as I am busty."
4.0,My only complains are it slides off easily and the temple tips are very flimsy.
4.0,The color is just lovely and I really like the sherpa trim. The soles of these boots are pretty thin though and very slick. Walking on my wooden floor I can feel them sliding. The outer part of the boot isn't rigid at all which makes them comfortable to wear. Overall they are a super cute fall boot.
4.0,"Takes forever to get,comes from china. Zipper catches a lot,but works. I got cause of price."
4.0,"the color is beautiful, the sleeves come up a little in the arm pit. Finding a bra to wear with it is difficult.. everything else is great."
4.0,These slipper socks are comfy and  really soft against the skin.  I wear a size 7.5 - 8 medium shoe and they fit nicely.  I really appreciate the instep elastic band holding them in place. The no-slip grippers on the sole are very noticeable when walking on a hard floor and a bit uncomfortable at first.  But I got used to it and didn't notice after a while.  They are fast becoming my go to for &#34;not as chilly&#34; spring mornings and evenings when my moccasin slippers are too warm.
4.0,"For the price this dress is very nice! Here's a few of my personal experiences with it.<br /><br />I'm 5'3, about 190lbs I wear a 40D. My Measurement's are Bust:45&#34; Waist: 38&#34; Hips:45&#34; - Think of a large hourglass lol<br /><br />I bought a XXL - the biggest size available.<br /><br />This dress is quite long, which I actually like, but for some under 5'3 you will most likely need to get it hemed.<br />The band under the bust was a bit tight, which I found odd because usually things are much too tight in the bust for me.<br />The top fits quite nicely amazingly I'm not falling out! Actually might even be a little loose on the side of the top.<br /><br />Ok, lets talk about the straps...Hate em! This dress NEEDS straps, it has nothing to keep it up without them and the clear straps are awful. I will have straps added to the dress, for the price I don't mind doing this but wish I didn't have to.<br /><br />The dress is very beautiful, I originally ordered it as a possible wedding dress for my garden wedding. It's still in the running but has some contenders. Honestly the biggest issue I have is that fabric below the bust being a little tight. So off to the alteration place for straps and to see if that can be fixed"
4.0,Adorable but very itchy
4.0,"These are very oddly shaped, but they aren't bad. Definitely a different type of shoe, but for the most part, I like them!"
4.0,I LOVE IT BUT IT NEEDS A STRONGER SNAP.<br />I've LOST MY ITEMS TWICE ALREADY BECAUSE IT OPENS WHEN I GET OUT OF THE CAR.<br />AND OF COURSE IT IS UPSIDE DOWN.<br />LOVE IT ANYWAY!
4.0,"Comfortable, flattering and not see through"
4.0,"I am 5'7&#34; 170 lbs 36B, I bought the X-large because I like coverage on my backside.  It covers backside well, doesn't cut in much on the sides and the ties are adjustable.  Top ties are adjustable too, so you can tie up the top tighter or looser depending on your chest size.  Good size, medium thick pads in the top can provide good coverage for a larger chest.  Overall, super cute and takes away the focus on my wide torso to my sides and hips!"
4.0,"Our teens loved this, but we had to tie elastic straps to keep it on their heads!"
4.0,These are really cute rain boots that actually fit my calves which is awesome. But they had a really strong skunk-like smell when I got them. I rubbed white vinegar all over them and washed with soap and water which got rid of the smell! Now that they don’t smell I’m really glad I got them.
4.0,"The colors are pretty and the dress is comfortable and flattering. I need to have it altered in the waist though because it's too loose and causes the bodice to be less defined. I'm only 5'6"" and thought the dress would hit below the knee as pictured, but it hits just above my knee. Washes well and wrinkles steam out easily."
4.0,"Sleeves are a little tight. Other than that, dress fits amazingly. Can't wear to a wedding or evening event."
4.0,I love the color and all of the room of this purse and the optional shoulder strap. The only problem I had was the shoulder strap broke from the purse after only 2 days of use. I love the purple color and everything. I hate to send it back but the shoulder strap is necessary for me.
4.0,They are super big so it wasn't much of a choker. I put it on the tightest setting and it just sat like a collar. Still cute thouhg.
4.0,Worked perfect for my &#34;Where's Waldo?&#34; Costume for Halloween!
4.0,They look great with my jeans.
4.0,"Beautiful, the fabric is better than I expexted, it feels really soft. I am size M, I bought an L and it fits just fine."
4.0,"Half way through winter,  I wish I found these sooner & in a bigger size. Lands End bib snow pants. For a size 8, my six year old cannot fit. Good brand too."
4.0,Fits extremely well and the pattern is quite nice. Love it!
4.0,"A little looser than I hoped. My waist is 26&#34; though. It looks like it would have good stretch, and the clasp stays shut. The metal looks heavy but all in all it's pretty light weight."
4.0,"These are really cute tiny tiny pearl earrings.  I have a cartilage piercing at the top of my ear and 3 holes in my lobe that are very close together.  I like tiny earrings for 2 of the holes in my earlobes and for the hole in the top of my ear.  These look very cute and classy.  I love the screw-on back so the posts don’t dig into the skin behind my ear when I sleep.  I have EXTREMELY sensitive ears and I had ZERO redness, swelling or itching with these earrings.  The only con is that the back unscrewed fairly easily and I lost one within a matter of days.  I was disappointed because I love these but I will just keep ordering replacement pairs."
4.0,Too small<br />Shirt is about two sizes smaller. I returned
4.0,I ordered two sizes up because this was Asian and it was a bit big I should’ve just ordered one size but it’s OK.  Have not worn it yet so I do not know if it’ll hold up!
4.0,"These were just as pictured and fit my size 8 feet perfectly. I bought them because I have narrow feet, and I liked the adjustable strap. That said, the sole of the slipper is on the narrow side as well--3.5 inches across at the widest--so it's an ideal slipper for someone with more narrow feet. Calling them orthopedic is a stretch. They do have a memory foam bottom that is thicker than your average slipper, but no arch support. Overall, a good purchase!"
4.0,Item was exactly as described! Worked well.
4.0,It looks like it is going to work well but I have not used it yet. i am waiting for the brass hammer that I ordered and my new watch to resize.
4.0,I’m 5’9” and 165 lbs. I bought a large but was a little too tight. I exchanged for an XL and I’m happy with purchase.
4.0,THAY HAD THE RONG SIZE ON THEM. THAT IS WHAT I THINK IT SAID 5XWAS WAY TO SMALL FOR ME
4.0,the medal end broke off.  but I really like the look.  the 2nd one I bought like it
4.0,Adorable and comfortable. Fit true to size.
4.0,Fits as expected but it is VERY LOW CUT. I cannot wear to work without alterations.
4.0,"They were cute and made well, the size was a little smaller than the size shoes we buy her. so go one shoe size larger."
4.0,This is super sheer and quite lovely. A very very lightweight cover up.
4.0,"Overall the earrings were okay, but really don't like the back.  Even with no stones, if the finish were smooth they would look better.  I would return them, but don't want the hassle."
4.0,Fun dress.
4.0,"After a few months of wearing these, I still like them a lot. They're a bit thin, which was expected, but may not be what others expect. The design/logo on the top of the sock is not appealing. Otherwise I would recommend these. Great for the price!"
4.0,"The colors are nice, the plastic seems sturdy and they do fold up tiny as advertised.  I think the bigger one will be great to keep in the car for small purchases at &#34;bring your own bag&#34; stores."
4.0,Run a little small<br />Very tough fabric
4.0,Very thin but my little sister loves it!
4.0,"Nice hat, I like it."
4.0,It should be longer in the front and should be $15 or ten dollars.
4.0,not what I thought it would be but seller gave correct details just very tight
4.0,"This is a great wallet. It is well made, nice looking and a convenient carrying shape. My only complaints are that there is no coin compartment and some of the longer coupons will not fully fit in and need to be folded in half."
4.0,"I am going to exchange this for any other color if they'll allow it. It does stand up when wet; it does open smoothly, it seems sturdy and is more manageable in the wind than single-layer umbrellas. I'm confident after a year of use it will prove to be a good umbrella. But the green sakura pattern is just a horrible shade, not turquoise or sage but more like creme de menthe."
4.0,It's a good glove but there are better ones out there.<br />Hear me out as I work at a carwash. These are advertised as water proof (up to certain meters).<br /><br />It's pretty water resistant but not fully water proof. It can still get soaked at the finger tips. Not worth it if you're outside in really cold weather. It does mention its temperature limit so be aware. The touch screen feature wears out so fast.<br /><br />I think it's ok. It's not meant for the work place but its great for wearing casually.
4.0,I was looking for blue workout pants and these weren't too overpriced. They are a bit larger than I would have expected but it doesn't bother much. I like that the fabric is thick enough so that your underwear line isn't soo obvious.
4.0,Attractive swim top. Needs a built in bra.
4.0,Single lens causes some distortion at a distance. Close up you would notice.<br />I like it I would buy this again.<br />I use it in the pool.
4.0,I love the dress<br />its so pretty
4.0,Good strong belts
4.0,it was fine.  I returned to find a more substantial weight robe.
4.0,They are very very pretty and Petite.<br />I wish they were a little bigger<br />They are BEAUTIFUL and very believable♥️
4.0,"a little rough on the ears and a few pairs had sharp spots so i just can’t wear them but overall decent product, they were very lightweight and i loved the look"
4.0,I like the shoes the pink at the toe does dirty fast and darken may want to choose a different color.
4.0,Nice and warm. Love the color. A little large in the shoulders for a large. Almost like an extra large.
4.0,My grandson loved the hoodie! It certainly met his expectations. Wondering how it will hold up after washing???
4.0,Got this as a little gift for my sis-in-love as she loves elephants and wears blue a lot. I hope she likes it. Great price point and is right in line with today's trend of layered bracelets. Not good jewelry by any means but cute and not too cheap looking. It will last long enough to make it to the next trend!
4.0,Pretty pattern and decent fabric. Not thin like other dresses I tried purchasing in the past from other sellers. The style is as it looks on the pictures from the seller. My only gripe is I possibly should have went a size down because the dress is a little looser than I expected. But the belt helps with cinching the waist in.
4.0,I really love these bracelets. They are reasonably priced. They are durable and wear nicely. The bracelet stretches and I think most people can wear it comfortably.
4.0,Nice variety to get creative with all my recent projects. Variety in sizes and design.
4.0,I do love this bag but yes the smell that comes with it is awful. All in all it's a great bag!
4.0,My son ordered this for his first girlfriend for Christmas. It seemed to be of good quality and she loved it. I am not sure of the long term quality.
4.0,I bought this for my wife. She finds it comfortable and usable for a variety of dress styles (casual/business casual/etc). We would consider purchasing another color in the future.
4.0,fits well eazy adjustment
4.0,We are satisfied with the size which is smaller than our old duffle.  It also has lots of pockets.
4.0,"This looks a little creepy if you wear it into a store, but it provides warmth with breathability for the cold winters here."
4.0,"Beautiful, delicate, soft & lovely rose tone.  Adjusts easily and stays, doesn't slip!"
4.0,"I used this heated base layer each day all winter and it kept me pretty warm. I like that the base layer is washable just don’t put in in the dryer- air dry it (the plug-in stays in the jacket during washing, but there’s a little leak proof cover that comes in the pocket to cover the plug). The battery is to be removed before washing the jacket. My only dislike is the size of the battery (it’s about as flat as an iPhone and less rectangular/more square shaped). When the battery is in the jacket, you see a bulgy square spot (which is why I’d use the jacket only as a base layer, but not by itself- looks too awkward with that giant battery). Fabric is stretchy and a tad clingy. Good thick quality though. It’s pretty warm. I like it, but don’t like how huge the battery is."
4.0,Hard to find good length for 6'5&#34; frame without being huge at waist. This is good length and waist size
4.0,It's a cute purse but smaller than I expected. It would fit a phone and wallet but not much else.
4.0,Great no show belts
4.0,"Coat fit as expected. However, the sleeves were slightly too short."
4.0,"These are great. Soft, fit well and have the compression."
4.0,"The items comes in small black pouch which has a drawstring attached. Inside the pouch is included the bracelet and jewelry sizer. Both are packed in plastic to prevent scratching.<br /><br />The color of the bracelet is silver like and is a bit duller than that shown on the website.  The bracelet is light weight and barely feels like it is on once worn. The bracelet is resizable to the smaller wrist as all of the links are removable, which is a big plus for smaller wrists like myself. Another handy item included is the resizer typically sold for removing links in a watch. The resizer appears to be a little on the less durable size, but with care each of the links of the bracelet can be removed. Care must be taken that the needle of the resizer stays straight otherwise if it goes in on an angle it can break the resizer needle. After resizing the bracelet, the bracelet is nice and is a nice fashion accessory. I am not sure yet about the claims of the pain and fatigue claims. I will need to wear this for a longer duration to test this claim.  The bracelet does appear durable and strong. The bracelet closes with a clasp like mechanism and appears that it will last a while based on the build. How the item behaves long term in water remains to be seen.<br /><br />It would have been nice to have smaller links and less gaps within the links so that it would blend better for smaller wrists.<br /><br />Overall, the bracelet is great fashion addition and looks nice and the price is reasonable as well especially with the included resizer. Therefore, I would recommend this product.<br /><br />I have received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review for the product. I am in no way affiliated with the seller or product. I write reviews based on previous experience with similar products. I hope you find this review helpful."
4.0,in the shoulders. fabric slightly see through.
4.0,"The jacket definitely doesn’t look like the photos, it doesn’t look bad, just not what I was expecting. The color is darker green and does not look “distressed” as it is pictured. It fits large but it does have a draw string at the waist on the inside of the jacket. The material is pretty thick and seems to be decent quality so overall I can’t complain."
4.0,"These are listed as compression socks and they are very tight.  I find them comfortable for walking and working out, but change out of them for around the house wear as after time they do tend to restrict more than I prefer.  I think it would just be personal preference on this product, but they do exactly as advertised."
4.0,Nice fits great it's hard to get right size first time nice to have size chart I'm chesty but small after that so hard to get a nice looking suit thank you that fits
4.0,"I am familiar with the GEOX shoe and knew this was a good deal when I saw it. The shoe had several scuff marks on top and the Velcro closure on the shoe was coming undone. It looked like the stitching that held the Velcro on the shoe was coming off. the shoes were in otherwise great condition, so I decided to just clue the tab back on the shoe."
4.0,There were a few loose strings off the lace but what I loved is that even though it was a tank top and shorts the material was very warm and thick. I recommend washing normally but hang dry just so the material doesn't shed or shrink.
4.0,"I received several compliments on this tunic the first time I wore it. It’s so comfortable - feels good on my skin. I wish it was tumble dry instead of needing to be dried flat. Otherwise, I’m very happy with it."
4.0,The multicolors really accent my brown skin.
4.0,"Love this corset.. however the straps aren’t very sturdy, I’d recommend sewing an extra stitch to keep them from tearing like mine."
4.0,Great value perfect starter set
4.0,Would of given a 5 just wished the band was thicker
4.0,The top is beautiful loved everything about the look except how it looked on me. The high collar mad my face look chubby. Wish it looked better because ti was well made and really nice.
4.0,I like the clearest and the color
4.0,I only like a few of them. But the ones I like are cool. Kinda cheap.
4.0,Me gustó mucho el vestido pero el cuello v no me gusto viene muy grande....es transparente el vestido no trae forro.
4.0,I like the pockets in the dress and it’s great bright colors! But I wish it could be cotton or smth mix of cotton and polyester
4.0,"Love this dress! You can dress it up or down, and it has a very flattering fit! I am 5'2 and the length was perfect.  Love the fact that it has pockets (always a plus) and the way the bottom angles and flows doesn't make me look short and stumpy!  Very good purchase!"
4.0,"The materials off this sun glass is make of high-quality and designed oriented, even when I don’t need the +1.00 in my eyes I will keep for the summers!"
4.0,Its a pretty decent watch. I'm thinking of buying another in a different color.
4.0,The suit fits all over ....except the bottom is larger.
4.0,I liked how it had no metal.
4.0,Fit great.  No roll down!
4.0,"Good size (width) both letters and cuffs. A little bit big, I have small wrists.  It since I have ordered multiple Yes Sir cuffs and Puddin chokers, from multiple vendors and sites- these are good. I will be keeping them.<br />With they were a little tighter and a deeper purple color; but overall- good product."
4.0,VERY IMPRESSIVE!
4.0,Dress is gorgeous and fits right! It is a little bit shorter than I expected it to be....and the skirt is see through so you will need to wear a slip under it.
4.0,"Bought this to wear on trips.  Recently my husband and I were in France for a month and my husband was pickpocket twice in 1 week!!!  Every since I've been paranoid about pickpocketers and realized we were so unprepared for our France Trip.  Previously we were in Korea a month and had absolutely no issues, but Europe is a whole different ball game.  We plan to continue with our travels after this Coved 19 situation, so I decided to use this time to prepare.  I love these shorts, so much, but I think they run a bit large, so I wished I had ordered them in a Small instead, but at the time they were out of Small, so I just kept these.  I personally will be wearing these over my underwear beneath my skirts, but during the summer months, I don't think it would be a bad idea to wear these even as regular shorts.  The material is nice and the zippers are also attractive.  I has two really deep pocket that can be securely zipped up.  I bought this in the nude color and the black color and gave one of each to my daughter.  She loved it and thought this would be perfect for when she goes to clubs, so she doesn't have to carry a purse."
4.0,"This dress was really nice , but the straps showed the size being a bit larger than I expected. But nice dress for Hawaii!"
4.0,"Soft fleece with convenient pockets. A little longer than I like and a little more slim fitting than I like. Overall, decent fleece for the price."
4.0,"Ended up not fitting my watch and it took longer then expected to receive, but unfortunately had to return for that reason."
4.0,belt was OK but not solid leather
4.0,Comfy gloves but mine came ripped between the thumb and index finger. This is a late review but I highly doubt I managed to rip them. They are good quality and don’t seem to rip easily. Also are not meant for touchscreen devices because it’s too soft. Seller was nice and gave me a replacement pair. Can’t wait!
4.0,super value
4.0,These socks are adorable. They are a little big on my 3 month old and I followed the size chart. I would recommend them to others. I wish the colors varied a little more.
4.0,Very well-made Except material inside pajamas is more rough than would like. Sleeves are slightly too short.
4.0,"I really like the the different textures and look of this bracelet. However, it is small and does not appear to be something that will last long.  Couldn't figure out how to &#34;open&#34; it to get it over my tiny wrist then saw that it was a skinny leather string that you pull open which I can see will fall off in no time. If there were a more secure way of getting it on and off such as a hook it would be way better, I may just add one on myself,but what a pain!"
4.0,"This robe would be absolutely perfect except be aware that there are NO pockets.<br />the workmanship, material and delivery are unmatched for the price thus only 4 stars."
4.0,"Firehose canvas plus spandex  makes for toughness as well as comfort.  Does lack the gussett in the crotch which is found on the original.  No flaps on rear pockets...top seam fits  well...don't think wallet will fall out but might attract pickpockets.  No small pockets for keys, I-phones, etc.  Total of six pockets (originals have eleven).  Good quality snaps on front cargo pockets but velcro is faster and probably more secure.  Has six 1/2"" wide belt loops plus one ""double"" for key ring.  Originals have five 1"" wide belt loops plus a ""4"" at center-back plus one ""double"" for key ring.  You probably get what you pay for, but quality on both."
4.0,Have trouble deciding which is front vs back of stone pendant. Maybe both.
4.0,"This shirt is so beautiful! I do have a large chest (40DDD) so my boobs don't fit all the way in the designated area. It doesn't look too bad, just the ruffles at the bottom are a bit warped and oddly placed due to my chest size. It's not SUPER noticeable with the black so i will still wear it. I ordered the XL but if it came in a 2XL it would definitely work. The shirt is kinda stretchy and soft. It's so cute and feminine. I really want the ""yellow"" brownish one ! Make in larger sizes please :( ! Would recommend for smaller chest girls."
4.0,I really loved this dress and wanted it to fit.  It looked great - covered my bulges where I needed it.  I'm only 5'4 so the length was great but it was tight through the back and I am all into comfort at this point in my life. I would have re-ordered it in my size but they didn't have any.
4.0,Great gift but the tree needs to be more durable it broke off
4.0,It's great quality.. just wish I ordered bigger. I'm keeping tho
4.0,The ring is beautiful but measures a half size too big. Otherwise I am super happy with the quality. I will be returning it for a size smaller.
4.0,A tad bigger than I would have liked it to be and looks better in person than the picture. Wish they would of made a pin stripe one that would match my suite better but it will work and since it's not pin stripped I could wear it with other things.
4.0,"Fit as expected for the size stated, not as close knit as I was hoping for, but are comfortable and cotton."
4.0,"Nice small scarf, I like it ."
4.0,Nice and shiny. The person I gave it to was impressed and shows it off.
4.0,"These are cute and seem well enough made, but they are a little smaller than I expected from the picture."
4.0,"Super cute, comfortable summer dress lightweight and attractive. Straps run a little big on the outside but overall the fit is good. This is my 2nd of these I liked them that much. True to size."
4.0,This item was great.  Came just in time for my birthday and I love it.  Color is amazing and writing on shirt was awesome.  I have washed it and didnt shrink at all.  Wonderful product to buy for us 1980 babies.
4.0,"Love the baby French terry fabric and it's well made.  Didn't shrink in the dryer.  Design is quite nice and I will definitely enjoy wearing it.  Having said all that, the sleeves were 4 inches too long and the overall length was 6 inches too long for 5' tall me.  So I cut it all shorter, hemmed it up and now I'm fine with it."
4.0,"I really like the shirt, but they are not kidding when they say that the sizes are completely screwy. I usually wear a large and after reading the reviews, I ordered an XL and it is still a bit too tight."
4.0,"I received today in brown and got a very nice first impression. Packaging was wonderful and very thoughtful. The product fit very well and looks beautiful,luxurious .But for me  looks like made of rabbit mostly. There is mink  contour in front.You can see the difference. So I will keep it,but reducing 1 star ,because I still have doubts about 100% mink statement by seller.<br />I ordered the black one too.Will update when receive it."
4.0,"For the cost, the pin is beautiful, not too heavy and has a nice finish.  Will look great on a sweater."
4.0,"bought this for a gift for my nephew,  Havent givine it to him yet,,however he loves dinosaurs so i know he will love it"
4.0,Im going up in size with my gauges and it’s hard to know which size is what because the bags aren’t labeled. Once again I love the set they bags just need labels on sizes
4.0,"Stretchy, vegan. Fits and looks good."
4.0,Was a gift. She said loved it. Never really wears necklaces but she wears it a lot.
4.0,"Although this dress fit well, the material was rather rough. A wash and dry helped quite a bit! Surprising that the material wasn't the same as the other two purchased with different colors."
4.0,"We just got this today and the print is super cool! Light weight, dry fit material but it has NO draw strings - the picture shows draw strings and my son is super disappointed it came with NO drawstring for the hoodie."
4.0,Very cute bought both red and black .
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised when I found that this set came with a matching earring for the other (non-cuffed) ear. The cuff fits and says in place and the whole set is very cute. The only downside is that the ear cuff can hurt after a couple of hours because of the way it squeezes your ear. My solution for that so far has been to scoot it up or down to an area that isn't already tender.
4.0,Great but not long enough 4 me!
4.0,I bought it for a gift. It looked nice.
4.0,"Really wanted these to work - material was soft and I loved the colors included in the pack (black & greys). Unfortunately, they were a little awkwardly sized for me. The shelf bra fits just a little bit on the small side (I am usually a small, but these in a medium were pretty tight in the bust). Meanwhile, the camisoles are also on the true-to-size/fitted side ... but very long! Going to try to find ones that aren't quite so long."
4.0,"Great gloves, seem to hold up well. More color options."
4.0,These are very good but i order the same size as the boot size and they where a tad large struggled to get them in boot but did
4.0,I got my necklace today and I love it but I'm giving it four stars because when it came it didn't come in the box like it said it would be it was in a little plastic ag inside of a felt jewelry bag which would of been fine if the chain had been packaged a little different because I had to untangle a couple of notes out it and since the chain is so small and delicate it was kind of a pain. But like I said I love it and I also love the face that it came with the cleaning cloth as well.
4.0,These are adorable and I wish they were available in larger sizes.  God son is size 5 but these were VERY snug.  No bigger option.
4.0,They make my ears burn
4.0,Very pretty and warm but it seems to snag easily.
4.0,They are cute but really hard to get in your ears.
4.0,the fit is not like the picture  it is very stretchy and form fitting. some loose strings and edging on border of lace a little messy. for what I'm using it for not important. for the price u get what u pay
4.0,"These LOOK cool and they work well. They’re also comfy.<br /><br />But... the actual ear “muff” separates from the headstrap regularly and needs to be snapped back in. Frustrating, for sure, but we still love them."
4.0,I bought this watch as a gift for my boyfriend and he liked it very much and said he was going to wear it a lot.  I think it looks pretty good for a fashion watch and for the small price tag it's a good watch.  The company that sold them to me included a couple of wood bead bracelets as a gift with the watch.  I don't really see my boyfriend wearing them so I removed them from the box before I presented it to him but maybe someone else likes that style.
4.0,"i got a medium and it does run kind of small, but the shirt is super cute and it still fits pretty well. i ordered a medium and i am 5'6&#34;, 120 pounds. it comes down to my jean line and is not super loose or baggy but not too tight or uncomfortable. i can definitely wear this with like a cute skirt and tuck it in or just jeans!"
4.0,"Not practical in sub zero temps, I would suggest turtle fur for that. Does hold body heat from the head well but in a slight wind this won't help you."
4.0,Seems to be a well made watch; it's keeping good time; just on the small size.
4.0,"I do like this swim suit. I am usually a medium but ordered a large, not sure if ordering an xl would of helped. The torso is short, and it is high leg but that part I like. It’s not too cheeky, my top area does peek out a bit more then I would of liked. But it will do for now and overall isn’t a bad suit just wish the torso was longer."
4.0,"The only negative for this leotard is that it is a little too &#34;french cut&#34; for my daughter and she found the front area between the leg holes quite narrow, but it is still comfortable and she just wears her biker shorts on top. Fabric great, colors very pretty and the straps are nice and wide and do not cut into her shoulders. She is 11, 5 feet 00 inches and 100 lbs and the XL fits perfect"
4.0,"I usually wear a medium but I ordered an XL due to some of the other reviews recommending to order a size up. I'm glad I did, if you're going for the oversized baggy look in the main product photo definitely order a size up or even 2 like I did. Shirt seems to be good quality and does look like the main picture."
4.0,"After reading the reviews I knew I had to get the xxl. I'm not even that big. However  I am 5'5 160 lbs pear shaped and my bottom is round. Glad I did I can wear my thick sweaters under the coat. It is very thin and will not substitute having a winter coat. It's not fully lined, very stylish and looks just like picture. Shoulder area is a little snug and is another reason to get larger size. It's worth the price!"
4.0,"I like this bag, it is not white like is shown it is a metallic silver instead. Also the button accents are not metal they are hard plastic and cheap looking. It is also a lot smaller than I had thought as well. The clips for the strap are very easily broken as well, so be careful with that. I do love the idea of this bag but just wish it was better made and white like shown."
4.0,Looks nice. Is a gift
4.0,"I am a US size 16 and ended up purchasing the size 6XL. It does fit nicely and I have room for lunch too. It has enough stretch in it to decently fit two sizes up in my opinion.<br />If you love the beach but hate showing off arms, legs, tummy and tush  then this is the most modest and demure swimsuit to purchase. It covers my chest without any problems (love that). My tush is covered by the skirt and the bow and cut of the suit accentuate my curves and disguise my tummy. It has a very comfortable boy short liner which I also like. The suit fabric is soft, stretchy and comfortable. No awkward pads or stiff cups to push and pinch my top. All the seams are finished with no threads or pulls. The suit could last for years with proper maintenance. The color of the suit is bright and cheery.<br />I received the iPretty swimsuit at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. The thoughts and feelings expressed above are my own from my own experience. I hope that my review and photos are helpful to others"
4.0,Buena calidad del producto...
4.0,Ok for all occasions
4.0,Good sun hat for yard work. Comfortable. Fit my head well 7 3/8th.
4.0,I am not a &#34;large&#34; person but the large fit well. It was not right on my arms and looked nice with a black dress
4.0,"Light, but warm."
4.0,A little long on me & I'm 5'9 & it's pretty thing so I had to wear something underneath it but I did get compliments
4.0,Very tiny charm. Cheap chain.
4.0,"I have mixed feelings... For the price, it’s a decent undershirt. As others have mentioned, they run a little tight and are a bit longer than I care for. However, I use them as undershirts and not as hipster douchbag outterware. They look better under a T-shirt than the standard tank top undershirts. Again, for the price they are a decent buy if you don’t want to fork out double for CK ones."
4.0,Nice and good for the price
4.0,"I like the glasses over all , the only thing which I don't like is they are a little hard to close up. The hinges seem to be stiff. I will have to see if oil will loosen them up. I really like the cloth bag that was included. Maybe now I won't get them scratched up like all the others."
4.0,"A little smaller than I'd like, but otherwise a great bracelet!"
4.0,beautiful dress but waist band is a little too tight. Go up a size of what you think you might be.
4.0,I ordered quite a few tops to wear in Batuu. This was the only one I kept that really fit the bill. I am happy with the fit. It is flattering and well made. I would buy more colors if there was a larger selection.
4.0,Great look but tag says 5percent cotton
4.0,Cute but the black looks a little cheap. Overall happy w it tho for the price.
4.0,cute scart and great price. Will be wearing it tomorrow!
4.0,"I'm a size 16-18 with large hips and butt, so I ordered the largest size. It fits just a bit snug. I can get into it, but it's hard to get thru the top straps because of the way I'm shaped. Also, I have a long torso, and this fit me perfectly in the length. I could never find a one piece for this price in a store because of that. Once it's on, it fits well and will be great for swimming laps. The colors are great and the quality seems good. Will update after some use."
4.0,This sweater is very cute. It’s quite thin and not very warm but cute and soft.
4.0,"I got this for my wife, and while she thought it was cool it was just a bit... much for her style. You really have to have an occasion to wear something like this! We attend the occasional musical but not with enough pomp and circumstances to pull of an opera cape. Still, the design and materials are lovely, and I will have to find something fancy enough to lure her into giving it a try."
4.0,I love it!!<br />It looks very good and stylish!!<br />The only downside is because is white it gets dirty quite fast but with a wipe is good enough to keep it looking good!!!
4.0,"Great! Look super,she loves them."
4.0,I really liked these earrings. I recieved a lot if compliments when wearing them. The customer service ia great too!
4.0,"I purchased this to help attach some of the smaller balls on my body jewelry. Unfortunately if the balls are 3mm, this doesn't seem to help very much, as the ball can be picked up, but not attached to a post. The prongs close on themselves with the 3mm beads,  at least for me. 4mm seemed ok. Hold is nice and tight. Will keep for future use. Thnaks ."
4.0,My daughter is enjoying this very much.
4.0,love it but i would go one size up from expected
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter and had it shipped direct to her. Doing so I have not seen it in person, however she sent a pic of her wearing it and it looked very nice. She seems to really like it. I like that it is different and not your average Eye of Horus imprint on a silver disc or just the plain silhouette  hung on a chain. Very unique."
4.0,"A little large but still can use it,<br />Thanks !"
4.0,nice and great price
4.0,"This dress looks so good on and is beautiful. However, whoever is charge of quality control needs to look closer at the pocket seams. My right pocket had a hole, where the machine did not pick up the material. I was able to fix it, however, my fixing does not look as pretty as the rest. I like this dress and do not want or have time for a replacement."
4.0,"Great feeling fabric - soft with some stretch to it.  Sizing is definitely off.  I ordered a size 10 for my 10 year old, who is small/ average for his age.  It fits like a size 7 or 8.  The sleeve length in particular is shorter than expected.  His 7 year old brother will get some use out of them at least."
4.0,"I'm 5'1 and 105 pounds and the small was a liiittle too big. If you're anythig below a C cup the top will not fit you at all. That being said, the colors are beautiful and the material is definitely neoprene!"
4.0,"My second one. I've been losing weight, so my XL needed to be replaced with an L. Good fit, good protection against even heavy rains."
4.0,"Mask are amazing! The only issue I had with them was that I did not feel comfortable with fake eyelashes, the eye socket was not that wide but if you dont wear eyelashes it's perfect!"
4.0,I have boobs so I got it a size larger. It fit like an empire right under the girls. The length was right under my knees. The dress was so comfortable! I wore it with simple jewelry to a memorial service in Kansas in 100°. Got compliments all day and never broke a sweat. Highly recommend.
4.0,"Love this simple line. Great fabric, soft and comfortable. Would buy again."
4.0,"Dress is great, the length is not too short and I am 5'3&#34;. I also wear a size 16, normally I wear XL shirts so they aren't tight on me, I ordered a 2XL for this dress as I read it runs small and it fits as expected, so order a size up. Only giving 4 stars versus 5 as I have not tested the quality, we will see how long it holds up and adjust review if needed."
4.0,This dress fits so cute!!!! It’s very comfortable and a nice length. I’m 5’2 so it’s just the right length.
4.0,I bought the light grey ones. These fit perfectly and look good but I'm pretty annoyed that the drawstring is white and not black like it shows on the picture.
4.0,"a little bit smaller than I would have liked, but it's still enough.<br />I would recommend this to anyone in need of a normal sized umbrella. Pretty steady."
4.0,I would wear a camisole underneath as the v shape of the neck comes a bit low for my comfort.  The material is soft and the color is a nice grape.  I like it - would not wear as a dress but as a nice long tunic top with leggings or pants it works well.
4.0,Very nice and thin for kids who sweat a lot. They tend to be a bit slippery on wood floors.
4.0,"i love it but i ordered a large and it was small. the 3xl is like a medium on me, and im 5'1"". its comfy but the material is kinda thin so it's not super warm. really cute tho just small!!<br /><br />-danny c"
4.0,I wear these alot.  I purchase them all the time when I wear out the previous set
4.0,Got for a friend for Christmas! She loves it!
4.0,Well made boots and comfortable.  Need to adjust to them because I can't feel the clutch pedal while riding.
4.0,This really are high waisted… i don’t love high waist but do love these shorts. They are so cute and soft!
4.0,"Well made. I little short, but my son is quite tall. He was very pleased."
4.0,"These look great! I ordered 2 sets, using the larger hoops in my 2nd and 3rd ear piercings and the smaller in my 4th and 5th. They did not work for my upper ear cartilage. They are fragile, but then all hoops like these are. Just be patient and take your time when putting them in. I’ve had them in for a few weeks and they are staying put."
4.0,Only issue is the zipper is a little rough.
4.0,"I liked them immediately.  Still new, but happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Just opened, put on and something snapped.  Beads were flying everywhere!  Had a previous one, it was fine, no problem.  Buy with caution."
4.0,Minor flaws in the sewing
4.0,They are awesome! I love the thickness and the the design. My only complaint is that they run a little small for an adult face and leave red marks on my face
4.0,Dress is so pretty and material is light and airy. I got a small and unfortunately it was too big. Some people may have not minded the for but I knew I would not wear it so I returned. I'm 5'4 115 lbs - I tried on with 4 inch heels and it still dragged significantly enough that I would have tripped. See pics for reference. :-)
4.0,I like the simple stripes print.  Material is perfect for my 3 year old grandson who loves to help me when I am cooking. His parent got him a kitchen set and grandma got him this cute apron/chefs hat.
4.0,The image on line was not the same when I received it. It perceived to be more fuller on-line! But I love style! I found cheaper one @ flea market.
4.0,"Right size in terms of waist and length but it’s not really a slim fit.  Wish there was an additional option to select for persons with a slimmer body type. It’s way too baggy around the legs, however still an awesome pants"
4.0,bought it for a girl turning 16 - looks nice
4.0,"Bought these because my test glasses were always falling off, for the most part they stay on my face now"
4.0,So far so good. As expected .
4.0,Wife Loved the design however the watch did fall off the band after awhile
4.0,I like this outfit. It’s a thin material so in the stomach area if you have a pouch it will show. Also might wanna size up because the bra part runs a bit small ;)
4.0,It's really sexy and nice to wear. I find the underwear to be a little bit small around the leg area thou.
4.0,"This is cute.  It's costume jewelry.  The watch/label, is small, so definitely not a 'statement' piece.  The watch works great and it is as pictured.  I like the long chain and it doesn't look super cheap.  Although, clearly, it's not an expensive piece it looks more 'grown up' than something you would buy a small child.  Pleased with the purchase."
4.0,"Fit was ok, have to raise the glasses to use bifocals well. Good in the car, not so much for gardening, reading seed packets."
4.0,"Great material, feel very light and don't interfere in the game but it they move even though you are using the fixing solution provided + the external socks. You need to keep repositioning them during the game all the time."
4.0,It 's nice I just expected it to be a little bigger but it's OK..
4.0,"Product is suppose to fit a bit lose. Very cute dress, cant wait to have a party to wear it for. The mesh is a bit itchy and coarse - however the under slip is nice and soft and protects from a lot of the outer mesh discomfort."
4.0,I purchased this for my husband for Valentine’s Day and he loves it. He put his keychain on his key ring but the metal doesn’t seem as though it would hold up for very long.
4.0,"My son always wears a Large t shirt. This one got good but he said a little tight in the arms. But it is wearable. So is tall, then and a little muscular."
4.0,"Too tight on the arms, very tight. Its beautiful but too tight on the arms"
4.0,The dress was beautiful. Would of been perfect for the party if it would of fit. It says run small to order a size larger than normal so I did and it is way too big. Do not have time to re-order as party is tonight.
4.0,On time delivery. Nice product for the price. Camera looks secure when attached to the strap. Highly recommended.
4.0,"Smaller than expected, but still very well made."
4.0,I am happy with the mittens. These will be perfect for the kids. It will help to keep them from losing them!
4.0,Thought the pendent was smaller
4.0,Light weight and very warm pullover. Fit is body snugging and good for layering on a real cold day. Highly recommend this brand that I have discovered during my visit to Iceland in the winter.
4.0,"The bracelet  looks awkward on a guy and the necklace is wayyy to small for a guy.<br />I'll give it 4 stars since the bracelet did give me a sense of well being when I started wearing it (probably since I started wearing it at the same time I started taking 5THP)<br /><br />I feel this comfortable tingle/ sensation when I rub it , it calms me down A lot."
4.0,"The pin is not in the middle of the rainbow, so it will shift to the side of the ear.<br /><br />The colour of the rainbow is not sharp enough."
4.0,"I would give this dress 5 stars if it had better support around the boob area. Although I taped my boobs, I had to constantly pull up the sleeves and not make extreme movements with my arms because it's feels as if you're going to flash your boobs to the world. Other than that, I loved the dress, and it gave my body a really nice figure. I received many compliments, and a friend even told me it looks like a classy and elegant Marilyn Monroe dress. Even my husband loved how the dress made me look. It has a beautiful burgundy color and the material looks and feels elegant and durable."
4.0,"Nice watch, good quality."
4.0,Nice but very light weight no where close to military specs.
4.0,"Cute blouse, but the fit is kind of strange. Colors are exactly as pictured online (at least on my monitor). It's kind of short and clearly cut for a tiny woman. I ordered up a size or maybe even two. Follow the guide and order according to your measurements."
4.0,"The bra fits great and it’s comfortable, but it’s not the same as the picture.  (It doesn’t have the lace/scalloped edging - just a very plain seam all around.)"
4.0,Very cute and soft. Thinner than I thought it would be.
4.0,"For the most part this looks exactly as pictured, except the colors are nowhere near as vivid. The Wizard of Oz is all about vivid, bold, Technicolor! I wish the case was as vivid as the photos shown. Other than that, it's awesome."
4.0,"Adorable set and my little softball crazed daughter LOVES it!! I would have given 5 stars if the earrings were nickel free  (I understand, you get what you pay for) the rest is great quality.  My daughter can't wear them at all because they irritate her lobes, sad because they are so darn cute!"
4.0,"Haven't worn it just yet. But the quality is good. Very sexy look, can't wait to wear it for my upcoming photoshoot. Also I love the cute little container that it's stored it.. Will update my review once I get to wear it."
4.0,Niece likes them.
4.0,Cute for goody bags! It's a little cheap though since it's just a sticker over the lens. But still worth the buy - was looking for baby's 1st bday party favors that wasn't candy or easy to swallow/choke
4.0,I thought both sides would be able to open but only the gold side opens up. It’s still a great keychain though.
4.0,"Nice leggings, fit fine, not the best quality"
4.0,Yes it’s very good thanks
4.0,"It’s okey, the things are cute but a little overpriced."
4.0,"Definitely runs small (but their sizing shows you that). I am 5'6&#34; and 115 lbs and I ordered the medium and I definitely could have ordered one more size up. They are made of a stretchy material so they fit more like leggings (although the material is nicer looking than legging material) so if you are looking for the baggy sweatpants look that are typical for joggers then these are not for you. Also, the yellow is sort of a dark mustard color and I was expecting something a bit brighter. Still cute and flattering to curves (definitely gives a little butt lift)!"
4.0,This is a gorgeous print flannel shirt/jacket. I'm 5 ft. tall and it comes almost to my knees so it is more like a shacket.
4.0,My boyfriend liked these but the regular pockets are way too small he cannot get his hands into them or his phone. He likes the fit and style.
4.0,Looks more like a toy than a real cosplay accessory.
4.0,I wish the necklace was a bit thicker... I feel that if it gets cought in something it will snap off... other then that I love it!!
4.0,great to work in
4.0,"Super cute for the price, the shirt fit great! But the leggings are baggy amd all around arent great. I would buy again just for the shirt though. Super good quality!"
4.0,Not sure if I like the lining but it is a pretty color.
4.0,"Very nicely made, just a little larger in size than the pair I was trying to replace.  They are comfortable and light weight on my ears."
4.0,"Good quality, not too thick and not too thin."
4.0,"Took awhile to get it, but is is just what I needed. I am a teacher have papers to carry, lunch etc handy  accessible pockets for my T pass"
4.0,I love love LOVE this suit! It's exactly like the picture. This suit gives me confidence by being cute and but also still feeling more modest (it shows just enough). Flattering and cute one pieces can be hard to find but this one takes the cake! The material also doesn't pill as much as other cheap suits on Amazon. The material is pretty thick as well and the padding in the chest is nice as well.<br /><br />That being said here's the one con I could find: the fit for my body shape. The padding was overkill for my chest (I'm a 36 C). For bigger chested folks this may be a huge plus! In fact this suit may provide you with a bit more support than other thinner and more flimsy suits (although if you have a massive rack I don't think this will provide enough as it doesn't hold and lift like a bra would). I also had some fit issues because my bottom half is larger than my upper half. The bottoms fit perfectly but the chest part had some extra fabric around my arm pits. You can't tell visually but as the wearer I could feel it. I would have preferred a more snug fit. Again I think if I had more up top to fill it out I wouldn't have had this issue (or if I was more proportionate). I thought about exchanging for a smaller size to see if that would fix the issue but I figured if I did that then the bottoms would not fit.<br /><br />All in all I love this suit and may have to buy it in different colors!
4.0,A very pretty blouse.
4.0,"This dress is meant to fit looser and have a swing but even the small is bigger than I thought it’d be. But I liked its softness and feel and it’s comfortable, so I kept it. It looks really cute to wear casually with a denim jacket."
4.0,Bought for a coworkers birthday. She like them.
4.0,"Beautiful pendant but the 18 in. necklace chain is pretty thin and flimsy.  Fortunately, my wife has several 2mm or greater thickness chains to wear with the pendant. Also, the &quot;dancing diamond&quot; effect is very striking, and the pendant looks great with either silver or gold chains."
4.0,"Bought 2 of these and really like the style. The only draw back I found is the length. I do not like long t-shirts or tops, if they sit on the hip yes, so I did some alterations on the hem and it fits perfect and I really enjoy wearing them both!"
4.0,"Good quality, soft comfortable fabric & design as aspected. Runs slightly smaller than other tees I have in the same size. Won’t be able to throw in dryer for sure but overall happy with it."
4.0,I love the color and the style but the arms are too wide and don't fit fight against my head.
4.0,Love Lafroi but all their shirts are not created equal.
4.0,"Milacolato earrings are thin - very thin. The shape and thickness kind of reminds me of a fish hook. They are comfortable. I accidentally slept in one pair Thanksgiving night. (I was exhausted) They're so thin that one can't tell that one is actually wearing anything. Two pairs of hoops close with one end going through an open circular catch. I didn't include pics because it would've been redundant. (See customer review photos) The silver is paper-thin and a nice enough quality. One pair is shaped like a wishbone. I'm not crazy about that pair because they look odd on. I wasn't sure how to put them on at first. Came in a gift box. A decent set of hoops for those with sensitive ears.<br /><br />*Update: Do not sleep in the earrings. Originally, I said they were comfortable to sleep in. Obviously I don't know jack! I never really sleep with earrings on because...OUCH! However, it happens. Again, I accidentally fell asleep wearing the middle pair pictured in product description. Oh my goodness! It left an imprint on my ear so fierce that I thought my ear was being lopped off. They're thin. The thinness can cut life a knife. I didn't become Picasso, yet, it was close. Whew! I do not recommend falling asleep in any of these. That said, the earrings are holding up surprisingly well and are still very comfortable...during the day!"
4.0,"I like it, I was trying to replace the original one that was stolen but this one is different. It doesn't have the marking &#34;bronze&#34; on the back of the rose. It's a but sharp on the petals. It not like the first one I had purchased."
4.0,I like this sweatshirt.  The weight of the sweatshirt is nice-it is warm and not bulky.  I like the retro color and style.
4.0,"3XL: I'm 5'9&#34; 300lbs. Selves are long; it's a snug fit for me but this is one of the best rash guards I've ever owned. I use it under my kimono, it stays in place and keeps me cool."
4.0,I did like it but....decided to exchange.
4.0,The zipper is a little frustrating to work with and it's a bit lighter than I thought it would be. Not bad at all though 👌
4.0,"It looked nice and might have been a good fit for someone an inch or two shorter.<br /><br />The dress is very shapely and doesn’t have a lot of give, so every time I moved my arms, the back rode up a little and the rear bunched up. The chest also sat just a little high on me. On a mannequin that didn’t have to move, it would have been a perfect fit.<br /><br />I loved the overall style, the neckline, and the fabric pattern (although the fabric itself was a little starchy, not sure if it would have softened after washing).<br /><br />I knew I wouldn’t be able to live in it/with it, so I returned it. My personal rating would be a 3, but it’s not their fault for not being a custom fit for me, so I gave it a 4. Wish it would have worked out because it looked stylish and was a good deal when I purchased."
4.0,"The lady's review:<br /><br />This three-pack of strapless, tube-fit bras gives you a great fit. It's very comfortable, and it provides a decent shape with padding. It's not super supportive, but it provides enough support for small- to medium-busted women.<br /><br />It's probably not enough support for larger-busted women. If you order, I recommend a large size for those with a full B or small C cup. The price seems reasonable for what you get."
4.0,"Everything is great with shirt as far as delivery date, color, softness of material and washability, but small fits like a medium."
4.0,"Finally!!! This was I think the third or fourth “rugged” band I had tried for my Apple Watch. The otters were very similar to this one but at least twice the price. I just wanted a good quality, nylon band with Velcro fastening that wasn’t $30-$50. This one is perfect. Reasonably priced and well made. I like it so much I want to see if they also have an olive green and dark blue version."
4.0,These were pretty but the post was really short. Could not wear in my ears because of it.
4.0,"These are very comfortable tunics but not terribly flattering. There's a bit of a tent-like look to them. I have tried them in different sizes, small and medium but it's the same effect. I wear them but they are not my favorite. I have to add though that when I was heavier by 15 lbs they looked better somehow."
4.0,"Purchased as a gift - the recipient was very pleased with the shirt.  It is very comfortable and fits well.  It is sheer, but that is apparent in the photos, as well, so no surprises there."
4.0,My daughter just turned 13. The bathing suit fits her perfectly! She is slender and wears an A cup. She bought a size 12.<br />It’s a beautiful suit and vey appropriate for a young lady. Not too revealing like many suits are for young girls now a days. Good quality at an affordable price. What more could you ask for?
4.0,The pins are on the wrong size making it hard to attach to watch face
4.0,This was new to me. Great idea. Works so much easier than teaching my son to tie a tie.
4.0,Great coat. Good value. Only mega to e would be the pockets are higher than expected.
4.0,"Great quality, but they fit like a size 4. The top was kind of short, even for a 4 year old. But fits well, very cute."
4.0,confortable and nice
4.0,This slipper is comfortable and has a good sole and fits a bit on the snug side. Order a full size or two up if you want to wear this with socks.
4.0,"Comfortable, but I don't own any other size L shirts and only a few size M's. I also have a short torso. These are size L and they fit me but I almost think size XL would look more flattering."
4.0,"I purchased this pack of socks to take to Iceland on vacation. I knew I needed wool socks to keep my Florida feet warm and found these. They are super soft and were as warm as expected. My feet were still cold but after all, it was Iceland in the winter. The elasticity was good, the size was perfect, overall, great sock."
4.0,"Great bracelet, I get complements on it all the time, but the magnets seem too weak to have any real effect for me. 4 Stars"
4.0,"Only issue is the shirt comes out of the washer and dryer really wrinkled. Other than that, it’s really cute. Lots of compliments."
4.0,These little gems are so cute and useful.
4.0,Cheap kind
4.0,Minimal support for high impact and its rather thin but it’s comfy and wearable for low impact activity
4.0,I ordered a size up but didn't really need it. It is quite loose enough already. The material is very pretty and fits comfortably. The material is thin but I like that about it.
4.0,Very nice arm bands.  My delivery date got pushed back.
4.0,"The tie worked well.  After taking it out of the wrap, it had some wrinkles, but they sort of shook out after I laid it out for a while.  My only complaint is that it is claimed to be &#34;extra long&#34;...which I disagree with.,..it may be 2 or 3 inches longer than standard, but is hardly like the extra long ties I have bought before (maybe 12 inches longer than standard)."
4.0,"This tiara was not what I was expecting. Most of the time when we get tiaras they are very flimsy plastic. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box and a sturdy tiara was in there. I showed it to my daughter and she was so excited that she wanted to wear it all night. She notice that it looked just like Princess Elena's. Because of the weight of it though I am going to be watching it closely on her head, since she is young child I expect the combs will be able to hold it  but any major movements may knock it loose. Other than that it is a great piece and I think will last in our dress up station for a while."
4.0,"Muy buen producto, lo recomiendo"
4.0,"Looks nice, but it's still too big for my so to wear."
4.0,"This was a really cute and pretty well-made cardigan! I thought it'd be a risky buy, but it was worth it. Almost exactly like the picture, but the sleeves don't roll up as much (for me, at least)."
4.0,"Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! The only problem I see is that the top metal piece opens often, allowing to charm to fall off its necklace easily."
4.0,This belt is cute. Wasn't sure at first. But once I got it out of the plastic. It itself is plastic! I bought this belt to wear with some of my Rompers and jumpsuits. This is all I wear in the summer. I just put it on with my romper I bought it for. It's really kinda cool. I don't feel like I am wearing it. It lays perfectly flat but it weighs nothing. A lot of my leather belts are a little too heavy and the excess of the belt will hang down funny. I don't even feel like I wearing a belt. Which is great for the summer. Looking at it you can't tell it's plastic. Only until you feel it. I am pleasantly surprised! I really digging it. I'm definitely keeping it. Trust me I was totally on the fence about it. Neat buy!!!
4.0,No complaints.  Exactly as advertised.  Looks great matched with a flapper costume!  Beads stay attached even after my toddler has played with the beads.
4.0,I had a little alterations done so I could wear this beauty with confidence.
4.0,"Very comfortable and high quality. I appreciate that there are rubber grips on the bottom as well as on the heel. Unlike other liners, these ones did not slip at all and I wore them for miles of walking. I wear a size 6-6.5 shoe and these fit well. I wore them with Toms, and a little bit of the sides of the liners did show but nothing too noticeable (this is the only thing preventing a 5 star rating). I definitely feel like these were a good value since you get 4 pairs and no slipping."
4.0,Cute belt. Have not wore it yet with an outfit so don't know how well it will hold up.
4.0,I love the color (got blue) and the clarity of the lenses. All though these are light weight after a few hours of wearing them they seem to all of a sudden get real tight behind the ears. I dont know what would cause this. Maybe my head swells or the glasses shrink. Who know but that is the only downfall I found with them.
4.0,"I love these yoga leggings! I ordered the 2 pk and received as a Christmas gift, loved them so much I then ordered the green. I love the fit and feel of these pants, very soft not really think and stay in place really well. So cute and comfortable. My only complaint is the colors aren’t true to how they are represented in the pictures. The heather gray is really black with a dark charcoal print and is much darker than the picture. The green are not green at all, they are more of a turquoise blue which I was super bummed about because I only ordered them for the green color. Also all 3 pairs I ordered were the same size (xs) but the turquoise pair are noticeably a little bigger. Oh well, order your usual size, they seem to be true to size. I’m 5’6, 115lbs and ordered xs. Overall I really love these leggings and think the price is great!"
4.0,I used it traveling through Europe. It was nice that it folded and fit in my back pocket.  The one drawback is if it is hot the waterproof liner can make your head sweat.
4.0,Kush
4.0,"I love the look and texture. The top fits, but the sleeves are tight, I normally wear a xl. I order the xxl I’m a size 14/16. In clothing  it’s a very nice looking top!"
4.0,Update: I washed it and it shrunk. Big time. Now it's too short to wear alone. I could wear it with leggings I suppose but i specifically bought it to wear alone with boots and long socks. And now I can't. :( I miss it tho it was my favorite dress. Ever. Before it shrunk. :( It was so comfy amd warm. Guess i should have got a size up. Took a star off.<br /><br />Ok ladies. This is short. But omg super cute and warm. I wear it with over the knee boot socks and warm boots and it works so well for fall. I am 5'3&#34; and the small is short but functional. Just can't bend over a lot lol. The more i wear it the more I like the shortness though. It's so sexy.
4.0,I bought this one and the pink bunny one. My children love them! They get so excited to wear their backpacks they don't hardly notice the leash. I like that the leash has an elastic stretch so if they get too far it gives a gentle warning before pulling on them. The only thing I don't like about it is that the handle for the leash is child sized and not stretchy so I can't put it around my wrist.
4.0,"Smooth fabric, nice color but there is NO glitter on it as advertized.  Adjustable ear loops are a good idea."
4.0,"I’m 5’5 and these are the XL. They are a little long on me but I still think they are cute. Love them. This is my 2nd pair. The 1st pair the zipper broke, but i was sent a replacement fast."
4.0,Love this purse the only problem is the snap broke the first day. I actually just glued it back on. But I love the bag
4.0,Vey cute.
4.0,It was a little big but I loved it.
4.0,"My Favorite Socks are Under Armour Phenom No Show but, they can make my toes a little warm in the summer months. These socks are a nice summer substitute. They fit perfectly, incredibly comfortable and no slippage. The colors are basic, so they match everything.<br /><br />Side Note: Depending on the shoe worn with these, they may show some. I have a few pairs of summer tennis shoes with open areas in the bridge area - and these definitely show."
4.0,Was more of a red than wine color. Fit was good and find to be very comfortable.
4.0,Good workout gear
4.0,"It's beautiful, but the size runs small."
4.0,"This Kryptek fishing shirt appears to be well made, but definitely runs small by a full size or a little more.  I wear an XL, but this fits more like a Large.  Other than that, it's very similar to a 1/4 zip product that Huk used to sell.<br /><br />Update:  I bought another one in XXL size, and it fits like an XL should.  So buy one full size larger than normal."
4.0,a nice suit
4.0,They fit nice Nd came fast.
4.0,"it keeps good time as long as i keep it would at least once a day,"
4.0,"Like everyone else says, this suit does run a bit small.  However, it is very stylish and has the look of a much more expensive suit.  Would definitely buy again."
4.0,Covers head perfectly
4.0,"The undies are fine. The bralette too large. But that's just probably me, thus the 4 stars. I luckily am rather crafty and adjusted the bralette to fit."
4.0,Good quality shirt; runs a bit small
4.0,This dress was very cute but it was big and loose. I bought a size large.... the size medium would have fit perfect.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, classic design and figure-flattering. I am 5' 1'' , 100 lbs, and the small fits very well, although it's just a tad too long (hits mid-calf). The only down side is that there's only one layer of fabric. Overall, very nice purchase for the price, a perfect day dress for the summer."
4.0,"They are gorgeous earrings,  I got them for my sister's birthday party in August, it's now December and the gold has turn, they also broke, but I fixed them"
4.0,They are very nice and stretch out enough to fit any size.
4.0,I love this band.  Color & print even nicer than photos.  You won’t regret buying this watch band.  This is the 3rd replacement watch band for my versa and I would buy another from this company.
4.0,The stones are very nice better than I had imagined and I'm very happy with this. If I had concern it would be the stretchy cord could be stronger
4.0,nice shirt. Fits to size.
4.0,My sons gigi fell in love with this gift! I get all my personal gifts from this company and my family laught and enjoys each one!
4.0,"It's great product actually, but it's too large. I kind of have bug head, but it's still big for me"
4.0,A little wide otherwise I would have given five stars.  Nice jersey friendly fabric.  It’s similar to another style short she has but this one is much more boxy.  I plan to use some darts to make more fitted. It’s a very versatile top.
4.0,"The bathing suit seems well made, the stitching is good and it has good stretch. The drawstring for the shorts is on the inside, which great-grandson didn't love, and there is no mesh lining -- a minus. Mostly, our granddaughter was flummoxed by the lack of tags other than one for size L -- a moveable feast for toddler sizes! Also, while the swimsuit came with a water gun, that did leak right away."
4.0,"Good product, better than the original band."
4.0,Nice dress for this price.
4.0,"Very cute, is as expected"
4.0,"I ordered the sea green color, received the blue. But needed the dress for an event so I am unable to return it now. Otherwise dress does fit and compliments, tight form fitting but some stretch."
4.0,It came on time. Just like advertised. Fits well.
4.0,Great delivery. Very nice watch for the price.
4.0,The material is a little thin; def will want to layer your clothes if going outside.
4.0,"I love this hat for my new baby, it's a little big but she'll grown into it!"
4.0,Looks great in my bathroom
4.0,"Well made, vibrant color, reasonably comfortable (as much as underwire can be anyway), fits as expected and gives great lift/separation. Overall I am pleased with this purchase."
4.0,This show is so cute and comfortable. I was disappointed that the heel broke off the shoe though. I would buy again and hopefully the same thing doesn’t happen.
4.0,"Nice bag, arrived on time, not Super heavy duty but gets the job done. Measurements are accurate."
4.0,"love it, a little snug even in the 2X size, but still comfortable"
4.0,Very cute but too loose on my wrist so I had to send back.
4.0,Got it for my mom but with the size I have to help her put it on.
4.0,"These are very soft as other reviewers have said. I ordered up a size and the fit is great. I ordered three-red, white and a floral pattern. The floral is not sweater material-it is like a very light jacket material. It will look very nice over a sleeveless top or dress. Perfect for work.  The only reason I took off one of the stars is because the floral jacket had a really strong smell. Almost skunk- like.  I sprayed it with Downey fabric refresher, and it didn’t help. So now I have to wash it before I wear it, and hoping it washes ok."
4.0,"I love Legend of themed apparel! This is the second necklace I have ordered and I have received other kinds from friends and family. The pendant itself is great, flashy to symbolize power and pride, and large enough to be recognized across a college classroom. My only problem with the overall product, is that the attachment-clasps on the chain itself are too large to be removed from the ring in the pendant; so you cannot exchange chains for the necklace without breaking and reconstructing something, but if the chain length suites you, then you're golden. I've had it for a couple of weeks now with no complaint besides the chain."
4.0,Runs larger than described but my kids loved it and that all that matters
4.0,"Quality lenses, easy to install and look like the original. Bought these because of the anti-saltwater delamination, because all my original lenses began to delaminate rendering the lenses useless. Hope these hold up but for the price it’s worth a try."
4.0,"For the most part, I like the suit, the color and the fit with a slight exception; the bra is a bit to large and support could be a bit stronger.  I would still recommend buying the suit."
4.0,"Sweet little ring, thats sparkles, I smile every time I look at it. A lot of bling for the buck!"
4.0,"Although these socks feel far from soft  to the touch, they feel okay when wearing them. They fit well and have kept my feet warm so far. I like the fact they are thin yet warm."
4.0,It was cute. Bought for a friend.
4.0,Shirt was hood quality and glitter looked vibrant. My little niece loves the tutu also
4.0,"I would give five stars other than the fact that the original one I received was broken.  I contacted the company and they sent me a new one free of charge right away.  As for the quality of the necklace itself, it looks like an expensive piece...the only downside in my opinion is that the chain is thin and snags easily on clothing."
4.0,"Its a cute wallet, but when I opened it up the plastic card holders were ripped."
4.0,I usually wear a medium and after reading the reviews about how it was a little small I ordered a large. It was a little bit big but almost perfect. I washed and dried it before wearing.
4.0,Very nice necklace! Great for GIFTS.<br />Got mine on time which is a plus! :)
4.0,"Honestly, I wanted to love this but it just isn't my favorite. It could just be my figure but it doesn't sit right and if have to wear leggings because the lace goes so high up! It is cute as a pattern seems well made!"
4.0,Nice fit. Love the color. Keeps me warm
4.0,This is adorable and comfortable. I wish I would of ordered more. so I guess that means I will have to get more. :)
4.0,Comfortable but run a little small
4.0,"I have the black version too. The white doesn't look as elegant as the black and gold. The locking mechanism is flimsy too, it takes some moving around for it to close properly."
4.0,"i'd like to know exactly what is it,a big glass marble or a real crystal?why did you paint it black if its real crystall,what are you trying to hide by painting it?i was twirling'em in my hand like bengwa balls and thats when the paint started to peel off,so i went to the sink and scrubbed the rest of it off now it looks like two golf sized marbles.i need black gem stones,something that absorbs my negative thoughts(bad things i'd like to do to certain people,because its not easy living in this mad city,queens ny) will these marbles help me with that?"
4.0,The earrings are pretty. They look nice. The diamonds are small and the sparkle is okay but it is what you would expect for the price. It is nice to say they are real diamond earrings. It is nice that they are real sterling silver. They are comfortable to wear and would work for pretty much anyone. They were easy to put on. Overall I liked them.
4.0,"Purposely ordered an XXL to be loose , and it’s very snug. Might want to order up."
4.0,"Good, serviceable daily use crew socks. Cotton construction with this one is neither too thick or too and is comfortable to wear over the entirety of a day. Socks have good support and have yet to slip down on their own.10+ uses so far with no fraying or noticeable wear."
4.0,"This dress is exactly as pictured! Although, it is much thicker than I expected. I ordered a medium- I am 5'5 and 130lbs. I was a bit confused when I first put it on- the front and back look identical. However, the neck hole is way lower in the back. When I first put it on, I had it on backwards and I was bummed thinking &#34;how am I supposed to wear this? It shows my bra and everything!&#34; Then I quickly turned it around, realizing I was just having a moment. Haha. Only con: cannot wear a regular bra with it. It will definitely show your bra straps."
4.0,This worked perfectly for my costume.  Was a nice added touch
4.0,Long Flowy roomy
4.0,I read the reviews and still didn't listen. The dress ran really big.  I hardly ever wear a small so I ordered a medium and it didn't fit me anywhere. It was just hanging off of me. I had purchased for an event but I had to return it. Beautiful dress and beautiful feel.  Size down!
4.0,"Cute pattern and soft, high quality material but they don’t stay on my head very well, especially when I’m working out."
4.0,Some people posted that it was cheaply made but I say for the price you can't go wrong
4.0,These leggings are great... JUST NOT RED AT ALL.  The color us more purple/brown as shown in the photo. I decided to keep them because I can never have too many leggings and the fit is great. They are very comfy and the price is good.
4.0,Easy to work with. Product as expected
4.0,"Good value, nice weight"
4.0,Needed some adjustments but a cool ring non the less
4.0,"sexy,light weight and comfy."
4.0,"This headband is quite comfortable & well made. It has just right amount of stretch to stay put & keep all those loose ends of hair in place without getting in your face. Absorbs perspiration well & washes/dries easily. Other colors that are reversible would be nice to complement any outfit. I thought it was just a tad overpriced, but it’s still a good product."
4.0,This was a gift for my sister who is moving out of NJ. She loved it and said it was perfect!
4.0,"Just what was advertised, and it came in just a few days. I loved the fact that the chord was adjustable and black is the perfect cord for the silver pendant. One thing I which this pendant had just a bit more weight.I'll probably buy more from this seller and I also have the Wunjo necklace."
4.0,I like that I have great coverage of my face.  I love that it attaches with a zipper versus the velcro.  I also like that you can adjust the strap to loosen or tighten the bucket hat.
4.0,"Pretty thin material, and fits very large - I ordered a small and it is way more than enough room to fit loosely. For source - 5’7” and a DD."
4.0,It fit great except I had to make my own button hole. I thought that was weird but I kept them anyway!!
4.0,"I do like these but some of the sellers on here (including Amazon) are charging WAY too much for these. They are what they are, so if you NEED them for an outfit fine, but they are made in China and meant for &#34;decorative use.&#34; The girls I gave them too loved them for their 80's themed Halloween outfits but if I were to buy them again I wouldn't pay more than $1.99/pair."
4.0,"I normally wear an 8 or 10 size. It was a bit tight. I'm tall too, so it was a bit short-waisted. If it had been a little looser, though, I would have probably kept it. The pattern was nice."
4.0,Good quality. Just as expected.
4.0,"I typically never use ear warmer because My pony tail or hair get in the way this changes that, It fit comfortably over my ears and the pony tail easily slips thru I am actually giving this to a friends as a Gift she is alway cold and has even longer hair then me she will absolutely love this. The material is warm but not over hot or thick perfect for fall thur winter<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in order to conduct this honest review of my option of the Non Slip Headband Fleece Ear Warmers with Ponytail"
4.0,"Okay, first off, the boring stuff: I received this item heavily discounted (sometimes free!) in exchange unbiased and HONEST feedback. And yes, I mean that.  If it is not a quality product, you’re gonna know it (check my reviews, there are several three and two star ones).  This seller has no influence on my review whatsoever and all opinions are my own.<br /><br />Now, the fun stuff…<br /><br />This is actually the second product from this company that I have reviewed, and this one is just as nice.  So far, it seems like it is Sterling Silver as advertised, as I've had no issue with turning green.  The ball on the bead is nice and sparkly, and embedded in a coating much like some of the high end Swarovski products are.  The thread is a nice length, also.<br /><br />I docked a star for two reasons.  One, the packaging REALLY needs to be rethought, as they arrived all jumbled together in a plastic bag inside a gift box.  It took me a second to untangle them.  Two, the ball is just heavy enough that I would suggest placing plastic earring backs on the thread to make sure they don't fall out.  The balls pull the threads.<br /><br />Feel free to ask me any questions below, if I can help in any way in making your decision, and thanks for reading!"
4.0,"Like it so far, used it for the first time since receiving the item.  Haven't filled the salt part yet, but the pepper grinder works great."
4.0,loved the colors and next time i will order smaller size
4.0,"Really soft but like most thigh highs doent stay up id sugest buying garters. But very cute, fit well and the colors were just as vibrent as they were in the picture"
4.0,Wish it had more compression but fit great otherwise.
4.0,Everything is great on these hats except the bill of the hat flips up when the child is swimming. It's just a bit too flimsy right at that section where the bill of the hat meets the rest of the hat.
4.0,"These are great.  I have to admit I am lazy when it comes to putting on shoes.  I don't like having to tie them.  I put then on a pair of running shoes I used to walk my dog about 1.5 to 2 miles.  The other day I used them on a 6 mile walk and I got blisters on the balls both feet, right behind the big toe.  I think it might be because I didn't make them tight enough.  If you're as lazy about tying your shoes I would recommend these."
4.0,It was super cheap but some of the beads aren't glued into their whole so they look a little off but overall it' great for the price.
4.0,My daughter does not like the fabric.
4.0,"Comfortable enough, however, VERY slippery on hardwood floors (particularly the stairs). The bottoms are hard plastic with little to no traction. 4 stars because of the price, and they are what I expect for such a low price."
4.0,"This choker is pretty cute, the letters move around and the buckle is good quality.  I gave it 4 stars only because there were a few scratches on the letters when it arrived, but it'll still work for what I need it for."
4.0,Awesome quality has lasted quite a while with not a lot of wear or tear
4.0,Pretty much loved it. I can fit all of my thicc locs in it and the hat doesn't look lumpy. It is a bit big though(this isn't really a con for me). I had to tighten it all the way so that the sides wouldn't flare out so works great if you have a bigger head or really thick hair
4.0,I totally love this. It was soft and very comfortable. Not perfect for outdoor skiing but works well.
4.0,"The ""J"" was missing on the bottom of the dress."
4.0,"My grandson requested unique hats for Christmas.  This is unique. However the word ""worry"" is spelled ""warry "" making it unique in a whole new way."
4.0,"Great Look, Perfect Fit, Nice Style, True Color, but Paper Thin.  Just plan on wearing a quality cotton under shirt or compression shirt underneath.  For the price you can't beat it, so I still would recommend..."
4.0,"This necklace is actually really nice for the price. Its shiny and looks good on. The only thing I didnt like was how small the initial was, it would fit a child more than an adult but anybody could wear it. Its very durable and isn't cheaply made."
4.0,A previous reviewer mentioned that these socks went up to her mid thigh which is impressive since I consider myself a short person (5') and these just reach the bottom of my knees. I really like the colors and the style of these socks but just wish they were slightly more over the knee and not as tight at the top. They're also fairly thin so those from colder climates might want to invest in thicker socks.
4.0,I am 6’4” and over 300lbs and I have plenty of room in the poncho. It is long but can be trimmed easily.
4.0,"they are super cute! they are definitely worth the price and they come with a lot of great add-ons like:<br /><br />- hard case<br />-goggles bag<br />- cleaning cloth<br />- hook on hard case<br /><br />the goggles are of great quality and the UV protection is legit.<br /><br />the only things I could point out that led me to the 4 stars are:<br /><br />- looks a bit too big for a female face.<br />- the interchangeable lens is a nice option BUT it is a pain to put the lens back on the frame, it took me epic amounts of time.<br /><br />good item I would just say not to change the lenses only if absolutely necessary. I tip I can give is, if taking the lens out when placing the new one start from the sides and work your way in, cause otherwise it is a mess.<br /><br />overall worth it."
4.0,Main Stone fell out on one side... I was able to super glue it back in. Other than that it is very nice. The attachment points need to be better quality though.
4.0,"These are just as pictured and I'm mostly happy with the quality. As one other reviewer noted, in some cases the front screws off and in others the back. I have at least one pair that has to be inserted by pushing the post in from the back of my ear, which I've always found a little tricky. I have allergies to cheap metals, but these don't both me a bit after a couple weeks of constant wear. They are very comfortable to sleep in. My main disappointment is that the splotchy designs don't show up well from a distance. I wanted earrings that make a visual impact and these seem to cause people to ask, &#34;What is that?&#34; and come in for closer inspection only to realize it's just swirls and planet-type patterns. Just plain colors would be prettier, in my opinion. The saving grace is that they are also pretty worn backwards. The back is a plain, flat silver disk that you can see twinkling behind my hair. I'd happily buy more earrings of this type from this company if they came in a set of plain colors I liked."
4.0,More of a beaded price of fabric than beaded jewelry. Other than that very true to color. Matched perfectly with an African print skirt I purchased. Well worth the price.
4.0,The glasses are attractive and seem sturdy enough for a child.
4.0,"It is very well made.  The straps are attached and I don't believe the attachment point is any kind of weak spot.<br /><br />It has two zippered pockets.  One inside and one on the front.<br />Also it has a few inside slots for pens and other small things.<br /><br />It seems to be a medium sized backpack, but I don't believe it is large enough for a high school student carrying a lot of books.<br />But for a day outing, it is great.  I used it for a day trip to Disneyland and it carried everything we needed which included sunscreen and water bottles.<br /><br />The leather is soft, but not super soft such that it will scratch easily.<br /><br />Overall, very nice."
4.0,"These are a good replacement for the originals. They are not quite as thick, but new and comfortable."
4.0,Great gift for my boyfriend and dad this year for Christmas. Shipped fast and in perfect condition. Definitely will get more for the OCD in my life.
4.0,Loved these. Kind of a pain to get them on but you get that with compression socks. It really stepped up my work outs
4.0,"I had fun with this watch. The watch comes with the band long enough for Sasquatch, but band the links are easy to remove. Use an unfolded paperclip to push out the pins holding the links in place. Push out the pin from the side that has the pin slightly indented, remove some links and push the pin back in place with finger pressure. I had to take out two links from each side of the band, a total of four.<br /><br />There is a thin soft plastic film over the crystal to protect it. Work from a corner to peel that off.<br /><br />To set the time the watch has to be in the normal time mode.  Push the &#34;B&#34; mode button, the one in the lower left, until a day of the week like &#34;FRI&#34; appears in the in hte upper left window. The window says WEEK. but it is really DAY. The sequence described on the instruction sheet works. The watch will automatically find the day of the week, so you don't set it. However, it seems the day is only calculated at midnight, so when you are done with the setup the day will probably be wrong. Just wait overnight.<br /><br />The analog hands set like a conventional watch by pulling out the bezel and twisting it. The analog watch is not coupled to the digital setting, so you can set it to anything you want, perhaps a different time zone.<br /><br />The watch is not just large, is it halfway to being the size of travel alarm clock. The resin construction is lighter than a conventional stainless steel case and band, so the size may not be bothersome if you can get your sleeve over it. The digital display can only be read if you hold the watch just right to reflect the ambient light, but the analog hands are fine. I think the idea is to use the hands unless you want the day and date, for which you can fiddle with the angle to the light. The illumination, actuated with the top left button, is dim, but it works fine for very low ambient light.<br /><br />For the low price, its an amazing gadget. They should fix the instruction sheet. I included an old convention watch in a photo for the size comparison and to show the relative ability to read the face."
4.0,Touch screen does not work.
4.0,The soles are made of composite foam...not sure how long these will hold up.
4.0,Love this dress.  Love the blue!  I also got the white one and it is waaaaay see through.  Suggest you get darker colors instead.
4.0,"Fit true to size, a bit longer than I expected. I'm 5'8&#34; and it touches the floor. Very comfortable."
4.0,It is nice although mine did Not come in a nice gift box as it stated. And the lil screw thingy fell onto the floor...
4.0,Very thin material. I'm a short person and they are very long on me...don't roll or fold easily.
4.0,"Cute color and fit. It isn’t the usual flannel material, it is much thinner. I still enjoyed. Just think it’s a little over priced"
4.0,These were given as a Christmas gift.  My son wears custom made shirts of all different fabric patterns and these looked really good with his white-on white shirt.
4.0,My husband wears size 10-1/2-11 shoes but the size Large was a bit too snug.  Probably OK if you're going to wear inside a shoe or swim fin.  I think the XL would have fit better but I did not reorder because the sole was not sturdy enough for the intended purpose (kayaking with the ability to walk on gravel for short distances).  No fault of the seller or manufacturer.
4.0,"Love this hoodie, I've had it for a couple years now. The colors are still bright as ever only problem is the pocket seem came undone at the top so it looks kind of like a kangaroo pouch lol but I have had it for awhile before that happened and wore it often."
4.0,Nice pants way too long for me. Returned
4.0,"It is very pretty,  could be a little bigger,  but other than that the quality is very good..."
4.0,Beautiful bracelet.  But after a month it fell apart... the string is not very strong.
4.0,This is a great little number.  I'm 5'2 and 110lbs so even the small was way too long.  But I'm short so nothing that can't be fixed!
4.0,My son loves these shirts. I presume that this one met with his approval as a Christmas gift as well. He likes to wear them to work.
4.0,Soft material and not stiff.  Bought these for my 13 y o daughter and she wears 14 in youth and 1 in juniors.  I ordered 16 and they fit her perfectly.
4.0,"I ordered this shirt in different colors from 3 different sellers using the same picture. This one has four functional buttons and the bottom hem is straight. The material is thin, almost see through. I ordered a size down for a more fitted shape."
4.0,"The locket arrived in a dirty, crushed, beat up box with a torn card so it was not very giftable. Very disappointed and not enough time to replace for a Christmas gift.  It did presentable.  It did not look like new"
4.0,I was surprised at the quality of the garment for the price.  It runs a little large.  I was able to size down.  Pretty and well made.
4.0,"Decent shades...Passable for quality sunglass, aesthetically speaking...You can feel that they are cheap when handling them though. The glass has a light blue mirror tint with a fair amount of transparency. They block light well but give off a blue/green tint to the world. Included microfiber bag, cloth and screwdriver are all nice.<br /><br />Ovearll, not bad if you come in with realistic expectations for a pair of cheapies."
4.0,"This dress fit as expected.  I'm 5'7&#34;, 125 lbs and measurements are 34C, 27&#34; waist and 38&#34; hips for size reference.  I'm pretty slender but the small would have been tight.  It does ride up, you will be pushing it down constantly unless you are okay with all the messy looking 'gathering' at the waist/hips.  Neckline not too low which I like.  Very stretchy and although the small would have fit like a glove I like that the Med gives just a tad in the right places.  It hits me right at the knee while walking but as I push it down it goes a bit below.  CONS - fabric seemed thick and good quality at first but once on, you CAN see through it in the rear area!  I plan to just wear this around the house, to run to appts or the store..it is NOT a nice enough dress to wear &#34;out&#34; out really.  AND i received it with a rip in the seam under the right arm like other reviewers.  It's small enough that I can stitch it back up easily by hand but was kind of annoying.  I dont have time to return and repurchase another or get a return as i want to take it on a trip with me in 2 days as it is pretty comfy."
4.0,"I ordered a size large, since it was the biggest they offered. I definitely needed an XL for this dress to look flattering on me. It doesn't really fit very well, but I still plan on using it as a tunic or shirt, and I am hoping that if or when I lose weight, it will look better. For most girls who are size 12-14 or smaller, you can fit into this. It just may be too short to wear without leggings. If you are short, like around 5' to 5'3, you can possibly get away with wearing this as a dress.<br /><br />With that being said, the material feels a little bit cheap synthetic blend, but it's not any worse than the clothes you find at places like H&M and Forever 21. It also has a similar price point. So you basically get what you pay for, and if you are looking for a print like this, it's worth it.<br /><br />I got this for free in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,They came right away. I love the gadget on the side that makes it easy to spring down and release. The problem was that the gadget stuck out and the leather band didn't have enough room to incorporate it and when I got it stuck into the band then I could not use it. I did get it onto the watch not using the gadget and it seems strong. It may work better with a Barton band. It was cheap but it is strong. I am glad.
4.0,bought this for my brother..
4.0,Holloween  of course!!!
4.0,Mu daughter loved the color and makes the quack quack sounds EVERYTIME she goes with these on while using the potty.
4.0,They fit just right and look great on her.
4.0,"Too big but it's a nice belt,  have to send it back and get smaller size."
4.0,The dress is absolutely beautiful. I purchased it for my daughter. My only advice would be to order 1 size up.
4.0,"They're great gloves and I didn't want the mittens function anyway, but as fair warning the thread pulled right out and they came off before I actually cut them. Otherwise they're very good gloves, comfortable and warm and they look great too."
4.0,"The pants were fine.  It would have been nicer, though, if they hadn't been wadded up and stuffed into an envelope that was too small.  (Wrinkles!!!)"
4.0,Nice pants.Fit s expected..happy with this purhcase.
4.0,"Super cute, light in color"
4.0,Really cute and looked just like the real thing! My only complaint is that is rides up in the back a bit
4.0,Very simple but very comfortable
4.0,"These are the softest loungers on earth!. Feels like bunny fur against your skin. They  run big. I’m 5’6”-145#, I ordered a large, and I swam in them. I will order a small next. The seller had processed my refund back to my original method of payment, before I had even made it back home from dropping them off at the aUPS drop off store…now that is FAST 👍"
4.0,ORDER UP 2 sizes! Super cute style & color. There’s a nice soft material inside. Thankfully I read the reviews and ordered 2 sizes up! And it’s still snug! I’m normally a medium and ordered the XL. It will still be a cute jacket even if I don’t always zip it.
4.0,"Love these stylish bands. Delivery was fast and easy.<br />I ould like the clasp to be slightly beefier, but thats just my reference mot a knock on the product. Highly rcommended."
4.0,"This romper is very on trend and comfortable too. The Rayon fabric is very smooth and flowy, and looks good this summer. I like that there are several colors in it as I can match it to many different wardrobe pieces, jewelry, shoes, cardigans, jean jackets, etc."
4.0,Add says cotton but it's 50 percent polyester. Overall a nice shirt.
4.0,It's dainty and I often get compliments whenever I wear it.
4.0,"Absolutely gorgeous shoes! The only problem was that this pair of 51/2 B shoe were more like a super narrow 51/2 shoe. The length, color, and quality is perfect. But I had to stretch them for a couple of weeks before I could wear them. My feet are not wide nor narrow. But I really wanted these beautiful shoes; therefore a deduction of a star. Now they’re perfect...after a stretch."
4.0,"It was a great well-made bra. If it had fit correctly, I am sure it would have been my favorite strapless bra... however, I recommend going down a cup size. I would have included a pic, but my bits would have been exposed.. ;)<br />I had to return the bra. I will most likely order another with a smaller cup."
4.0,They are a bit flimsier than I had hoped but they seem decent enough.  They look nice and are very light weight.
4.0,"You won't find a better pair of shades for the same price. Not the darkest lenses, but a significant amount darker than a lot of other cheap shades. They look and fit great, I'd definitely recommend."
4.0,"These gadgets are great for backless and strapless dresses. You want to make sure your skin is completely dry before applying. Don't moisturize the area. You might want to use spray deodorant to prevent sweating. If you're larger than a D cup, you can cut one and add the halves to the outside of another whole one. It will give you extra coverage and lift.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,His favorite show. I took off one star because it does shrink after a few washes. Particularly the shirt.
4.0,This top is so cute! It does shrink a bit so I suggest to order a size up. It is very flattering and flowy at the stomach
4.0,"Was too long for my 5'2"" frame but other wise a nice skirt.  Color is not red, more burgundy."
4.0,I really love these keychains. I really wish I could get the black cat macaroon because it looks like my cat. But I’ve alre ordered 3 so I don’t know if I can get anymore.
4.0,"I like the feel and look of the pants, exactly as pictured. As for my taste the size chart if misleading, the 1X should be marked 2X. unless you like and want a baggy look. Not as fitted as picture., yet still like and wear them mostly as casual house wear."
4.0,"These boxer briefs are soft and comfortable.  I prefer a shorter length, but these work as long as you are wearing parts that are longer. The soft texture makes me wonder if the will last. I will report back when I find that the briefs are wearing out."
4.0,Great shirt...slightly bigger than expected
4.0,Wide opening at the top not sure about durability because they won't be worn much by my daughter but she loves them so I'm satisfied
4.0,"I really like the shirt. I was excited to apply my tee shirt transfer on it for an event in two days. It is however, quite small. I ordered a XXL and I don't like the size. The waist on the shirt measures 19.5&#34; across right out of the package without washing it. I hope this helps you pick the size you need. The mesh on the sleeves is unlined by the way. It looks just like small football jersey material."
4.0,Affordable compared to others.
4.0,Beautiful and fun. I had to order 2 sizes larger than I am but it fits great
4.0,Great arch support. Fits a bit large even with the straps tightened all the way
4.0,I wish it was longer in the back.  But it does the job.
4.0,Cozy comfy get lots of complements!
4.0,"Good and light. Only problem I'd say, is the lenses seem a bit loose in the frames. Not enough to actually fall out, but enough to feel as if they might"
4.0,"very nice and comfortable pants, but just a little too short for tall men"
4.0,Cute. I will turn it into an infinity scarf! Decent shipping.
4.0,"This is really loose, comfy, fabric isn’t best quality but will do. I’ll probably put a belt with it to give it some shape. Worth keeping for the price"
4.0,The lamps worked beautifully for the camping trip.
4.0,"great. it was a gift for someone and they loved, price was decent and shipped fairly quickly. they loved it."
4.0,This item came packaged very well.once I pulled it out of the package I noticed that it had a lot of pulls on it see picture two. It also runs small I'd say this would fit a typical 0-3 month old. The color is nice but I'm afraid to wash it because I feel the animals could peel off so will wash inside out.  I received this product at a reduced rate for my honest opinion on the product.  I pride myself and giving honest reviews even if I don't like the item .  I feel honest reviews keep the marketplace safer for buyers and sellers alike .  If I were to buy this item again I would size up .
4.0,The quality of the towels was the most disliked.
4.0,"For this Money I didnt expect something gorgeous.<br />But its pretty god for the money, printed synthetic"
4.0,Really cute minor proportion issue but all together a great find.
4.0,"It was smaller than I thought, or I'm bigger than I thought. It was pretty much what I wanted otherwise."
4.0,"These earings were delivered on time and are absolutely gorgeous.  They are a lot bigger than I expected,  but I am very happy with the purchase."
4.0,Product as described. Fine finished
4.0,okay fit and length. they are a little big around the waist
4.0,"High quality hat, a little wrinkled on arrival. I'm hoping I can work that out with some use. No issues."
4.0,"I bought the men’s sweatshirt because the women’s sweatshirt I bought ran too small. I thought about getting the large mans shirt but decided to go ahead and order the XL since I wanted it to be baggie. The fit was just right although it is a bit long, but that’s not unusual for a men’s shirt. It’s not a real thick sweatshirt but it is nice and soft. I hope the transfer holds up when I wash it. Overall I think it’s a good shirt, it will be perfect for cold evenings watching cheesy Christmas movies. :)"
4.0,Why? Because the back support is awesome. The lift and coverage is great. The downside? It fastens in the front by three hook and eyes and they pull out of the fabric. They just are not secured well. It's a lot of money to keep spending on what could be a truly phenomenal product if they would just fix this issue.
4.0,Appears to be a quality product.  Card slots are somewhat tight but that is not necessarily a bad thing.
4.0,"Very cute, but there's not a lot of support. It's a hammock for your ladies."
4.0,Thin but comfy
4.0,"This is a very cute dress! Simple fit, very cottagecore, aline. Only complaint is the material isn't quite as soft as I was hoping, & it's a wee bit on the thin side. But honestly for the money, it's a great deal & adorable!"
4.0,We used this as prizes for a emoji themed birthday party.  They were a big hit with the girls (all 9 yrs old).  I took away one star because one of the necklaces had to be adjusted so the charm stayed on the chain.  (it was off when it arrived.)
4.0,I like the cost and the comfort and color of the band. The band color does fade along the edges.
4.0,Really like this product and the company was great to deal with
4.0,"it's exactly what you'd expect for the price: a cheap, lightweight, small scarf. I'm expecting it'll probably rip after a couple wears.<br />perfect for Memorial Day, Labor Day and July 4th cookouts or whenever you feel like reppin 'merica."
4.0,"Right fit, tight and shows your body off."
4.0,"They look like the real thing, look really sharp, of course they will hurt a little if your wear them for a while, but you'll get use to it. I don't suggest wearing them to a club as I have bought two pairs and lost all of them... oopsie Vodka."
4.0,Nice shirt but runs a little on the small size.
4.0,Nice fabric.  Runs small...  I would &#34;love it&#34; if it were 1&#34; or so wider..
4.0,"This crew neck pullover/sweatshirt is super comfy! The fabric (a polyester/cotton blend) is a pretty color, seafoam green.  It is soft and comfortable. I like that it has pockets. It fits true to size, so don’t order up. I did but like my sweats baggy. The only thing I am waiting on is the season to change so I can wear this while running errands."
4.0,"I am 5ft 4 inches and this dress could be longer. 160lbs I bought the xl, blue floral colour, the black floral 5 stars bought it in large, the white floral in large could be longer but not bad<br /><br />Now for the blue and white floral it is made from umbrella material the surging at the ends are still raw the belts are short and not sewn properly I would not encourage any one to buy the blue and white floral it is 100% junk worst piece of clothes I bought from Amazon worth 1$ I cannot wear this."
4.0,The hat material is very good 👍<br />The printed logo however is very light and hard to read. Not as vivid as portrayed in the photo.
4.0,This corset is very cute and I'm impressed with the quality of it.  It shipped rather quick.  The fit runs just a little bit big.  I usually go for the large corset and a medium would have fit perfectly.
4.0,I'm typically a size 2.  I ordered and XS.  They are not skin tight but fit nicely.  Hopefully they will hold there shape.  Not sure if I can machine wash them.
4.0,"ordered a 4/6, usually wear a 4. I am 5'2 110 lbs. Dress fits well, stretchy and cute. It was a bit short for me about 1.5 inches above my knee - that was the only draw back. Strange as another reviewer same height as me said hers was too long."
4.0,Its a liitle short in the front (for my personal taste). Over all a good buy though.
4.0,There was nothing wrong with the dress but it was too short for me and I didn’t like how it looked on ME.
4.0,Nice and beautiful colors. Totally stands out.
4.0,Me gustó mucho esta video. La talla m quedó perfecta
4.0,"Well made, well fitting thongs for men.  The t-strap in the back is the perfect width for comfort, does not bind or &#34;cut&#34; between the legs.  The pouch in the front is well designed for support without being uncomfortable, and it compliments your package nicely under jeans, khakis, or without...  So far, the bedroom response has been positive, too!  I have worn thongs (not every day) for decades, and these are some of the most comfortable (back, pouch, waist-band) that I've worn in a LONG time, even compared to those I've paid $20-30/pr for....<br /><br />I normally wear 32-33&#34; waist pants, and US-M underwear.  These Asian-L (US-M) fit perfectly for me.  I am also above avg size, and the pouch is plenty stretchy enough to maintain comfort, even if slightly aroused.<br /><br />These are a low-waist (hip-hugger) design, so don't be tempted to pull them up high like a boxer... things should be held low and slightly loose, otherwise the bottom seam will dig into you and the t-strap will slowly saw you in half, lol<br /><br />My only complaint on quality has been one pair (orange/black) has an issue with the outer black piping on the right leg, where the piping did not catch the orange material for about 1.5&#34;, so it appears as a &#34;hole&#34;.  I am sure this defect will also allow the material to tear, but we shall see.  I don't want to return the entire batch to get one pair replaced...."
4.0,"The shoe is really comfortable to wear while doing chores, but not for a lot of walking.  If you have a low arch, your foot will hurt because the shoe doesnt offer any support."
4.0,"These are not a thick fleece, but they work very well and are a GREAT price!  thank you..."
4.0,Exactly as described. But it took way too long for delivery. China!
4.0,Sturdy shower flip flops. Fast delivery. Great for college.
4.0,"I got this for my wife as a present because her birthday is in March.<br />The color looks nice and the earrings looked premium and well made.<br /><br />My wife liked it and she put it on for whole day. But when she came back, she mentioned about little irritation on her ears. She has allergy to sterling silver earrings but these earring were white gold coated.<br />She is more sensitive than most of the people so it could be just her, but we will see how she reacts on long term usage.<br /><br />Overall my wife seems to be satisfied and I would recommend it to other people."
4.0,I purchased this dress for ball I was attending. I used the size chart and ordered according to my largest measurement. When I received the dress it was too large and needed to be taken in at the bust and should have been hemmed at the bottom as it was VERY long. The dress had many fly away strings but overall it was a great purchase. When shopping I saw a lot of other options for $200-500 range and this dress looks expensive with only being $70. It is a steal so doing minor alterations was totally worth it. Plus the dress garnered a lot of attention and I received many compliments on it. The wine color was very flattering.
4.0,I like the style. Sizing is small.
4.0,"thought this was a good deal. It is , but no instruction came with it.  As a beginner it would of been nice to know all of the functions that one could do with this kit."
4.0,"These slippers were easy to put on and definitely nonslip. I sent them back though, because they were much too big. I'm female, but wear a size 12 shoe. I bought the extra large slippers, and assumed they would fit since reviews were saying the slippers ran small. They were much too large. I would have exchanged them, but the return slip did not offer that option."
4.0,"This mask was perfect for my daughters Halloween costume, it was bright and sturdy, she received a lot of complements on it!"
4.0,"Hermosos, aunque en la foto de descripción no se  veía que el borde fuese negro si no mas entre marrón y rosa."
4.0,"This is a snug fitting dress. I definitely should have ordered this one a size up just so it would be more comfortable. The length is modest and can be dressed up or down depending on the cover and shoes you wear. On me, this dress stops around mid calf, but because of the tight fit, some open toe heels or black pumps dress this up for a night on the town. On the other hand, it is simple enough to wear with some flip flops around town, too. And for work, my sister rocked this dress with some boots and cardigan. Who knew? I really like this dress, but it worked much better for my taller and leaner sister. I had to wear spanx with mine, but she was able to rock it like a pro. She loved it. I would definitely recommend this dress. The material is stretchy and the forest green color is complimentary for about anyone's skin tone and eye color. And it's light and moves well.<br />I purchased this at a reduced rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. These opinions and experiences are solely my own."
4.0,It fits for a 0 gauge but my husband has hard time getting them in and they are not super comfortable. It is a perfect skin color for light skin people. He's a red head and you can't tell unless you really pay attention.
4.0,Straightforward. Does the job. Good quality.
4.0,"Nice and warm, feels good to."
4.0,I got these for my son.  Thy fit well and just need broken in.  The strap over the foot is thick and seems strong  There's nothing wrong with these and nothing fantastic.  Just a decent flip flop for a decent price.
4.0,"Very pretty, lots of compliments.  Umgee has beautiful clothes, but they seem to be rather delicate - something to keep in mind when washing, etc."
4.0,I’m happy I ordered the XL so they will fit over tees.  I’ve been looking for reasonable priced sun screen tops and these fit the bill.
4.0,Not as neon purple as on my computer monitor but still a good dark bold pink color. (not Pepto-Bismol color) Fabric feels nice and good for the appearance of stockings without the squeezing of fat thighs look! :) Well worth the money.
4.0,"Somewhat large, but that being said, I wear a size 5.5 shoe in womens."
4.0,"Fits as expected, I wish the material was softer but it’s a good, cute tee for the wardrobe."
4.0,This is a nice necklace- it is delicate and perfect for someone who wants a unique necklace. It can be worn with a casual outfit or something more dressy. . The chains are thin but well made.
4.0,"good hat - I got the L/XL and it's a little tight (but I've got a huge head). Nothing wrong with this hat, but as I'm on the upper end of the sizing - it's not comfortable for more than an hour or so. Leaves my scalp a little tingly after wearing."
4.0,"Good quality, exactly as pictured on Amazon.<br />A little tough to get on and off, but manageable"
4.0,Great bag for our first backpacking experience.  I<br />Carried about 25 lbs.  I wish the tent straps were thicker but really that was my only issue.  I worried about them snapping.
4.0,Buenos lentes
4.0,Nice shoes. Size up half size. Runs a bit narrow. My feet medium width
4.0,"This dress is cute and warm, and IT HAS POCKETS! It looks professional, and again, I love the pockets. The pockets maybe make the torso ""pooch"" out a bit, but I'm so dang happy to have pockets in a dress, that I am willing to overlook that. This dress makes me feel like I'm ready to kick some butt in the courtroom, which is, after all, what I bought it for."
4.0,"Edit: the clasp came open really easily. Even just wearing a long sleeve shirt that brushed up against the band was enough for it to pop open. I requested a replacement and so far the replacement clasp has been much better.<br /><br />My wrist is six inches in diameter. After removing all spare links with the provided tool, it is still a little too loose on my wrist. The watch face is also a bit large for a woman's watch. I will have to wear it a day to decide if it's too big or not.<br /><br />Quality seems fine for the price. It came in a wooden box that surprisingly nice, unexpected for what I spent."
4.0,The color is not light purple it’s more grey. I will still use. Maybe it’s my eyes playing tricks and the image on Amazon is actually grey and not purple. It’s a great size!
4.0,"Cute, fashionable good bargain"
4.0,Looks nice and works for a busty woman.
4.0,My grandson loved it but the football was kind kind of cheap looking
4.0,To small= in listing it appeared that it would a little bigger-it's a lovely purse for a 5 yr. old.But to small
4.0,"Super cute. Fits great. Super slinky material, looks great on. Thicker almost water resistant material feel."
4.0,Super cute and not too tight on my daughter. I bought them for her 1 month Photoshoot and they looked great. I might even use them again for her 2 and 3 months Photoshoots as well.
4.0,I love them. But with all the fur they run a bit small! Im a 9 1/2 I ordered the 9-10. I should have sized up!
4.0,Order smaller I ordered two sizes smaller and it was still quite large.
4.0,"Such a cute top! Kind of a spandex/swimsuit material, but not too thin. Higher neck line than I usually like, but doesn't choke or anything. Decent length; even with my DD's, the top still covers down to my lower ribs; no under boob showing ;) Next order of business is to find the matching skirt big enough to fit my butt! :)"
4.0,Every day wear>
4.0,order up one size
4.0,My sister love this
4.0,Once I put it on it broke immediately. Still a really nice product.
4.0,This was a gift. Just right.
4.0,"Well worth the price, very nice hat."
4.0,It's a beautiful skirt but fits a little small
4.0,My sister absolutely loved it. It's a very tiny bar with a slight curve would only recommend smaller wrists
4.0,Pretty but I really didn’t realize they were pants..lol<br />I have to return them since I have large hips and they don’t fit over the booty. I went a size up and ordered a XXL. But these hips don’t lie. Gorgeous concept of product but not suitable for my body.
4.0,"power tie for my guy, he loves it!"
4.0,"This hoodie has a nice cropped design, but the fabric is not exactly what I expected. It's thinner than your average hoodie. The garment itself does not have a sewn on tag telling you the size, what it's made of, or any washing instructions."
4.0,Get so many compliments on this blouse
4.0,Love the way this looks.
4.0,"I ordered this product because I was more curious than anything about it.<br /><br />The description says that it'll keep you cool in summer and warm in winter.  The day I got it was 114 degrees here.  I immediately opened the package, folded it diagonally, and draped it over my head.  I immediately felt cooler.  The mesh kept the sun off my head, and the openings allowed the breeze to flow through nicely.  However, that airflow is the problem.  In such a low humidity environment as here (5-10% RH for the last week) that airflow is going to cost you a lot of moisture.<br /><br />One of the other things I noticed was the smell, which was a fairly strong chemical smell.  I brought the product inside, and washed it in the sink with cold water and dish soap.  I would recommend you take this step because it not only got rid of the smell, but it bled off the excess dye.  The water, only 2"" deep, was quickly turned black by the product's dye.<br /><br />I wrung the extra water out of it, and draped it over my head again.  The cooling effect was immediate, but short lived.  The product doesn't hold a lot of water and dries quickly.  This could be a real problem if the moisture you're trying to conserve is your own sweat.  I'd say it was dry to the point of losing effectiveness within about 45 minutes.<br /><br />In contrast, I soaked, then wrung out, one of the shemaghs I got from Rothco.  It retained moisture and worked effectively to cool me for over 2 hours.  The closer weave is much more effective at holding moisture, and I would recommend a shemagh over this veil for the purposes of cooling.<br /><br />However, the mesh weave of the veil does make it very effective as a concealment aid.  It's very easy to see out of the veil when it is draped over your head, while it makes it very difficult to spot the wearer.  It also does a great job of breaking up your outline and allowing you to blend into the background.  While a shemagh can break up your outline effectively, you obviously wouldn't be able to see through one as well as through this veil.<br /><br />So, thumbs up for this product for concealment, but a not-quite-thumbs-down for it as far as cooling."
4.0,"I really like these earrings.  I have very sensitive ears that get covered in that unpleasant green gunk if I try to wear fake gold or silver.  I’ve worn these earrings for days at a time, including in the shower and haven’t had any problems with ear sensitivity.  They look great, bright and shiny but not overly shiny to the point of looking fake.  They’re also a great size – again, you can see the earring but it’s not a giant, gaudy fake diamond in your ear.<br /><br />My only complaint is the short posts on these earrings which make the earring backs susceptible to slipping off.  The posts don’t feel significantly smaller than other pairs I’ve worn but I’ve had several instances where I barely touch my ear (with the phone, with the back of my hand moving hair out of my face) and I hear a little noise and realize the backs have fallen off.  Once I woke up with my two earrings resting neatly on either side of my pillow.  Fortunately I’ve been able to stop the earrings themselves from falling out but I fear I’ll reach up to my ear one day and realize I’m an earring down."
4.0,"I like the look, it runs a little smaller than most size larges.  Seems to be good will know more as I wear it and launder it. Service was quick and packaged well."
4.0,"I'm surprised the finish is so polished on these earrings at this price!! They are both beautiful and have a nice length, (Just under 2&#34;). I would give it 5 stars, but I had to replace the clasp, in order to keep them from coming off. For around a buck, add these to your order, as they fit &#34;Every&#34; earring I've bought for my wife and they don't hurt her sensitive ears and they come in a pack of 144. (sorry for the run on sentence) ASIN # B009LIOEHM 5x4mm Earring Backs (144pc/bag) http://www.amazon.com/Beadaholique-Rubber-Bullet-Earring-Backs/dp/B009LIOEHM?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00<br />The clear rubber clasps I copied/pasted above have worked for all 30 pairs of earrings, as they seem to stretch over just about &#34;anything&#34;."
4.0,Soft. Comfortable. Doesn’t fade.
4.0,Fits well i.e. loose like it's on the photos. I didn't like that loose fit so it's just personal taste and not the product's problem. It's really good material and good stitching and detailing with the buttons on both sides.
4.0,Stabs skin a bit. The rough end of Velcro touches skin. Otherwise I love it. But it’s definitely annoying.
4.0,"This dress is so cute! The colors are bright, the fabric is nice and light and the cross cross tie back is just adorable! Unfortunately my 12m old is tiny and at 18lbs the XS was too big for her. If I tied the ties tight the front of the dress came all the way up to her neck. If I loosened them it hung off her weird. So Im sending it back. Hopefully when she gets a little bigger I'll rebuy this!"
4.0,"The chain it comes with is cheap and fragile. The stone is have. So I switched to a sturdy silver necklace. It is a beautiful stone. All the way around, GREAT for the money!!!"
4.0,This is fine
4.0,I took this to Mexico and it was perfect! Once you get it aired out and unfolded it looks adorable and does the trick. Kept me looking cute and saved me from the sun.
4.0,"Loved the top, but for me at my age the bottoms dont give enough coverage.  but overall a good buy"
4.0,Love but too short
4.0,WORTH EVERY PENNY  JUST NEED SOME BOXES
4.0,"if you buy this bra, go with 1 size bigger. i bought my normal size and it did not fit me. however; i gave the bra to a friend and it fits her perfectly. she loves it. she said it is very comfortable and provides just the right amount of support. she actually ordered 2 more of these for herself. i give the product a 4 based on the sizing error. my friend gives the bra 5 stars. i really wish they offered 1 size bigger!"
4.0,they are what they are
4.0,Tne description is pretty accurate. It’s super cute I can’t wait to wear it
4.0,"Quality is really nice and the material is not too thin. However, it runs large. I usually wear a size Small and this one fits like a Medium. Print is beautiful."
4.0,"This is a 5 star item, style is and pattern is super cute. Material is thick and well stitched.  Unfortunately,  I don't think its true to size. You definitely have to size up. Im normally a size 12 and this didnt zip. I also don't really recommend this item for someone with a big bottom as the skirt lifts up from the back, therefore its literally below the cheeks, and when u bend down, well you get the picture.<br />This is really cute though. Just size up if you're on the thicker side."
4.0,It's a little too big. But everything else is great.
4.0,I love oversized glasses. But that nose part makes the glasses fit a little awkward. I’ll still wear them once or twice. Cute minus that nose part.
4.0,The fabric is not as &#34;flowy&#34; as I thought it would be. But it's a nice casual summer dress. The colors are very bright.
4.0,Got it for a friend and she loves it
4.0,It took two months for it to arrive but I’m glad it came and it’s fine
4.0,Looks cute.  True to size.
4.0,"The look and quality of the shirt is what I expected however I usually order a XL but the fit was too tight.  I ordered a 2XL and it was a comfortable fit.  My recommendation is to order a size larger than what you usually wear.  I am only speaking for the long sleeve shirt, do not know how the fit is for any other type of shirt."
4.0,The dress is adorable! The tulle is a bit rough but the skirt is lined otherwise might not be wearable.
4.0,"Very pretty, but odd to put in.  I don't wear it often, but I don't regret the buy. Good purchase."
4.0,Just ran a little short.
4.0,"I wear a medium in women's and I wear a 32A. I'm lanky, so it falls a few inches above my belly button. I'm 5'7 and 130 pounds.<br /><br />The print is nice, but very very thin, akin to exercise shirts, but thinner. I like it  :)"
4.0,These are disposable gloves. I use one glove every time filling up my car. They do their job to keep gasoline and viruses off my hands.
4.0,They served their purpose but seem to be easy to rip or destroy especially at the ends of the finger.
4.0,"Smaller than expected. However, product did meet my organization goals when packing."
4.0,"I’m going to give this a 4 out of 5 only because the material and design is really nice. The only thing I didn’t like was that it was too big for a large. I wear large for sports bras and medium for pants. Both were too big, I might go lower to a medium. They certainly pass the not see through test and they are very comfortable to wear"
4.0,"Love the shoes, stay on well and are comfy. They really n Big so I buy a size down for my girl."
4.0,"This bracelet is just so cute!!  I bought a few different ones for my daughter and her friends.  I am so happy that I was able to get these for them.  They are so girly and love playing dress up and anything that looks like it is for older girls they have to have. These are perfect, the price is perfect.  The quality is not the absolute best, but I haven't had any problems with these.  My 2yr old even has taken this one on a daily basis and nothing has broken on it at all."
4.0,Where a little thin but otherwise they are comfortable.
4.0,Exactly as described in the description. Thank you. Would order again
4.0,"Love them,good fit"
4.0,Pleased with the result this product offers on the maintenance of the cork handles on my fishing rods.  It is now part of the annual maintenance ritual on my saltwater rods and reels.
4.0,Amazingly soft. Great for work
4.0,It was smaller than I expected.  The quality was just fine.  I would order again.
4.0,"A nice, simple dress. Straps are not adjustable or elastic in any way. If you happen to take a nap while wearing this, the straps will probably dig into your shoulders. That aside, it's nice to wear casually."
4.0,"Great price and great quality. I only wish it was adjustable bc it's a little big. Overall, looks beautiful."
4.0,"I wear Yoga pants every day because of back pain (Jeans are just too much pressure on my back so Yeah I wear many types of yoga pants to say the least). I got a med I have 40 in hips they fit perfectly. It definitely does not have the boot cut either it is just a longer legging, that is barely more loose at the bottom. They are very cute though. I just wish the lace panel was attached in more than two seams. (top and bottom of lace). I will probably those these on the sewing machine and through a few more lines around the lace panel so it isn't caught, stretched or ripped. that is why 4 stars instead of five."
4.0,Not as bright as pictured but I still very much enjoy them.
4.0,I never give 5 stars. Nothing to complain about. It’s a beanie. Buy it.
4.0,"The colors are great, the material is good, the assembly is great. But the tags say hand wash..... No tag can tell me how to run my life.<br /><br />I'll admit I'm lazy. I didn't check the washing instructions before I ordered them. So when they came, they look equal to the bras I bought at penny's in the same style. But I'm lazy and if I can't wash it I don't want it. So I took on fate and machine washed them. And then machine dried them. (With some towels) they survived!!!!<br />Although if you are brave, don't let them sit wet for too long because previous experience, that can mess up the cups."
4.0,Cute dress. Very simple
4.0,"It is a a very cute outfit. However, the pants and head band run very small on my already small framed child. I would definitely size up 1-2 sizes. Also, the pockets sit a little strange when the pants are on. They almost look like the mc hammer pants but they puff and come out, if that makes sense.<br />Shipping was crazy fast considering its coming from China. I received it a week and a half before the fastest shipping estimate."
4.0,Looks great but it doesn't have very much to offer for breathing to be easy. Makes you sweat
4.0,"Love these glasses. They are oversized and a little see through (I can see my eyes) -so be careful there. But for polarized glasses that are comfy and large, you can't beat it. Feel well made and sturdy. Would purchase again."
4.0,Nice piece of jewellery...cute
4.0,"5’4 and 140lbs and I got a medium. Was a little challenge zipping, but I expected this after having a baby. I wanted dresses that would give easy access to nurse my babe and this did the job! Very cute as well!"
4.0,"These may have shrunk a little bit in the hot dryer on the first washing.  They still fit,  but not as loosely as I would like for PJ's..  I think if sizing up,  they would have been too big.  Quality seems good, and I am hopeful they will last a few seasons."
4.0,"Although the shorts were little bit tighter for the waist even though its the same size I wear for all other shorts and pants, the length and regular fit was fine. I usually prefer to wear belts but for this one it almost felt like wearing a belt without having put one. Other than that the quality seems alright for a summer shorts. I liked the color and material seems to be streachable and feels comfortable to wear. If I have to buy one again, I would probably go one size up."
4.0,Soft and comfy material.
4.0,"It fit ok, but she loved it i think it's bit amllerthan 8.5"
4.0,I love it! But it's so painful to get in and my ear was swollen from trying so much. But after the swelling went town it was very cute lol
4.0,Looks great but it's hard to keep the jewel dude facing out
4.0,"i got an ugly neon pink color with rainbow animal print, womp. likely going to leave it in my lobby for someone to claim. i like the green color though, and how it’s packaged sanitarily."
4.0,The material is nice and light. My kiddo loves the design. He is just to the point where size t are too short in jammies and so we ordered a 6. These were a bit big in the waist on him but we roll the waist down and he still likes them. I would still recommed just go with your normal size :)
4.0,"Super fun, good for beach accessories or summer style. Good quality!"
4.0,"The dress fits,  but the length of it is long. I made a tie like a knot on the side of the dress that works for me."
4.0,"Returned due to the fact that I didn't like the watch. However, the watch band looked good and functioned well."
4.0,"Stone is smaller than I expected, but it’s a pretty necklace & my daughter loved it."
4.0,"This item is not what I thought I ordered and it took over 3 months to get here, so that blows, however the item itself is actually better than anticipated.  I am 5&#34;1 and 110lbs.  I normally wear an xs or s but I ordered up a size because Asian sizes run small and the medium fit like an xs, which is perfect for me.  However, if you are average sized you will probably want a large or plus.  I expected something very lightweight, what came is actually fleecelined and the material is just thicker.  However, it fits far better than it looked like it would.  Wouldn't order again because it took too long, but over all, I'm happy with it."
4.0,Product looked amazing
4.0,Just arrived and they are beautiful. My husband and I will be replacing the Chains because they are the beaded metal crappy quality things. but the pendants themselves seem to be decent quality. only time will tell.
4.0,I love it .I love it .I love it .
4.0,"Was excited to receive, once received wishes they were thicker. But they were definitely festive and so very colorful. I work with children who really enjoy them."
4.0,"It just what I needed for my hospital stay and for future beach trips to keep valuables safe. Big enough for my Fire, phone and more. As noted, it's hard to get grommets out at first, but doable with their guidance. Happy customer."
4.0,Love them! Only thing I wish I could change is if the buckles could be adjusted.
4.0,"It was cute looks exactly like the picture. I ordered a Large,and I wear an 8, but it was still cut too small."
4.0,"Good value for money. Fit a tiny bit small, but nt by much."
4.0,"love it, the colors as shown , the fabric more of a sports  wear material"
4.0,Works...
4.0,"Material is comfy and the fit is nice.  However, I just discovered that the buttons don't work--they're just for decoration!!!<br />Still cute though!"
4.0,"Dress seems to be a quality material and looked like the picture. Color was nice (I ordered the light blue) I wear a 16/18 and ordered an XL. It was  tight on my arms but big everywhere else. It did nothing for my shape, so it will be going back.  But overall good quality for the price."
4.0,It's kinda see through so it's thin but it fit larger than expected
4.0,"The order was processed quickly, the shades where darker than the image so they didn't work as well as others I've had. Returned  them with no problems."
4.0,"Very cute and thankfully proportionate to the foot, unlike most baby shoes that are too wide.  They are still a bit large for our toddlers right now, but should fit better soon.  Exactly as pictured, too."
4.0,"Very roomy. Comfortable, and cute, even though it's too large for me. I still wear it."
4.0,I like the style of it even though it’s somewhat small
4.0,Too big for me. Also a Iittle heavy; So I gave them to my sister. She LOVED them❣
4.0,"The screen print quality looks like it may not last very long before fading and the graphic doesn't appear to get resized based on shirt-sizes. What I mean by this is the graphic was a bit too big for the shirt. The shirt is an anvil brand shirt, ringspun, and of good quality.<br /><br />All this said I like the shirt, and have received a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,"i really really do love this wand, i got it for my collection to display and its so pretty and makes some pretty good sounds my only issue with the wand is that the empyrean jewel is pink instead instead of silver,i under stand that they felt that littekl girls might like it more if it was pink, but i thinks that littel girls would have still liked a silver crystal as long as it still looksed pretty ^_^"
4.0,I would have given it 5 stars except one of the watches was already rusted by the time I received it. Returning items can be a hassle so I decided to keep them all. But it would be helpful if they checked their products for quality. It comes with three replacement batteries for each.
4.0,Watch met my expectations and band is not too heavy
4.0,I bought this umbrella as an extra for my new car. It's very nice and sturdy. I like how it opens and closes with the touch of a button. No issues in the winds. Comes with a nice sleeve so it will not snag or tear.
4.0,The only reason I didn't give 5 stars that are hard to get on over your calf but they work very well. I have M.S. and my lower right leg and foot get cold and these work very well
4.0,I like it<br /> It could have been a little bigger.
4.0,"It's a good top nice material and very flattering, however I don't think I will rver wore it because I ordered a medium and it turns out to be a little large for me. The top looks good if it is a little tight and not loose. I can't return it because I don't have a receipt"
4.0,They are really cute but look strange if u have muscular legs
4.0,This romper runs small. I’m a size 14-16 pants and large T-shirt. I ordered the 2xl. It doesn’t stretch. My arms and chest could barely fit it. I do have larger arms and breasts (38G). If you’re top heavy I suggest ordering a size up.
4.0,These are very pretty and a nice price. They would make a very nice gift. I bought them for  myself because I love  the color. They are a little smaller IRL than they seem in the description. But I would definitely recommend these.
4.0,Nice blouse. Cut smaller than expected
4.0,Cute and small didn’t come with stickers zipper is yellow and blue which is adorable and it has 3 compartments
4.0,was cute and fitted
4.0,"Super obnoxious and totally ugly - perfect for what I needed it for. I wish it wasn’t so “box-y” like and wish it were more form fitting. I altered it by gathering material and sewing together to get more of an hourglass figure (as I have). If you are too heavy with small waist, you will want to alter so that you get a figure - otherwise you will look like a box. IMO. Still, worked for what I needed and everyone loved it. Happy purchase."
4.0,I love the style and look. I have these in several colors.  It would be nice if they came in more 1/2 sizes.
4.0,Love this purse just wish it was bigger
4.0,"So cute and pretty but after a couple weeks, the stones get really loose! Not bad price so I can't complain too much :) just wish I was able to wear them longer before having to replace it"
4.0,"Super cute, fits perfect, only downside is that it is more of a microfiber type fabric and isn’t as absorbent as it could be."
4.0,Beautiful cozy perfect coat
4.0,"Lovely blouse, perfect color (orange) for my granddaughter who loves bright colors and they look good on her.<br />The asymmetrical cut and styling complements full figures.  The bottom fits just to the waist, not quite a crop<br />this looks really nice over a bodysuit or close-fitting tank top tucked into skirt or slacks.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars except for the odd texture of the outer surface, which takes some getting used to."
4.0,Nice and cozy. Could do without the lace across the back though.
4.0,"This shirt was a nice, lightweight, and airy beach shirt for our trip.<br /><br />I ordered this for our beach trip.  Our daughter-in-law said we were going to take pictures on the beach as a family and that we needed ""beach clothes""  I ordered a few different items.  We never found the right time to take family pictures but I still wore this and enjoyed it."
4.0,"Loved the color, the material looks OK, for the price is not bad, the print looks very attractive in red. I am 5'8"" and I wished the beach cover all would be a little later longer. If you are not too tall this might fit longer on you.  I wanted a red print for my red bathing suit and it does the job well for the cheap price I paid."
4.0,"These are really nice leather gloves, but I think they do tend to run a little small.  I bought the Large, and then the XL size and quite frankly, I notice no difference in the two sizes.  They fit, but they are snug.  My hands are long, but not very wide."
4.0,"nice, tight fitting slippers - good for my new walker, who would trip over big clunky slippers.  Only downside is that they fit so snugly, he cannot put on himself."
4.0,After ordering multiple sizes I found that the xs work best.
4.0,I really like this top unfortunately the color wasnt for me.
4.0,Tag was nice but chain was cheap
4.0,"It is a bit smaller than it looks like in the picture but I'm sure I'm larger than the model. When I hold my arms out the wings theyc do not spread out so beautifully. Its hard to see the adorable designs when standing. However I have gotten tons of compliments on the creativity.Bottom line, its worth the money. The material has like a thin, silky like feel ( not meant to keep you warm) and the way it attaches to your arms is through a finger hole sewn onto the wing. Also the neck is a velcro collar"
4.0,Item is super cute. I find it to be comfortable to wear.
4.0,"The black and white ones were nice lightweight fabric, the grey one was a cotton, not a huge issue. Great shirts"
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this dress.  Decently made, but not the best quality.  I wanted something lightweight that I could easily pack and wear anytime.  It's definitely a good buy."
4.0,"The black part looks like fake, cheap plastic, but only if you look closely. They look lovely, overall."
4.0,These are lightweight and comfortable. The included case is a great bonus. Great for sports.
4.0,"These are really pretty and actually pretty comfortable. They are a bit small for the size I ordered, I'm a size 11 and got the 43. The toe box very hard at the end, but I put a little cushion that you would normally use around the heel and I was good to go!"
4.0,"My daughter still loves the sweatshirt because of the art, but the material is thin and probably not that high a percentage of cotton."
4.0,Delivered on time and looks like we expected.  Happy with the costume.
4.0,Soft and good quality. Recommended
4.0,"Buena calidad, pero la talla demasiado grande"
4.0,It’s pretty cheap but that was fine for what I needed and was as expected for the price
4.0,bow tie was a little small
4.0,Love them but tend to get dirty really easily
4.0,"I really love everything about this dress from the colors , to the way it fits my curves ❤️🙌🏾"
4.0,It fit perfectly with the right amount of stretch!
4.0,I wore this to a concert and got quite a few compliments.
4.0,I have placed an order of these and like them a lot.  I get great compliments when I wear them.
4.0,"I ordered this skirt to wear for my sister's wedding this summer. I followed the size chart and ordered a 3XL because I am 5'10''  140lbs and needed the larger size skirt for the length. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase. I had to take in the waist but the length is just about perfect."
4.0,Love the shirt and the look. The first was was a bit too small.  Wanted to exchange it.  I ordered a bigger size and when it came to returning the first one I ordered it was requested to &#34;jump through hoops&#34; so I never returned it. It just wasn't worth it.
4.0,"Really cute shirt, but small in the bust area."
4.0,Not crazy about the clasp.
4.0,"I am on feet all day and at the end of the day my feet hurt.  I started wearing compression socks and they are awesome, but in the Summer it gets really hot and I just want to take my shoes and socks off without having to go through the trouble of taking my pants off just to get my socks off.  I already had 1 pair of calf compression so I needed more.  I like these calf compression tube sleeves.  And I like that you get 3-pair. It's definitely worth it.  I plan on getting another pair."
4.0,"It's kinda flimsy, but incredibly adorable! So far my phone hasn't broke with it, I've dropped it several times."
4.0,"So as you can see from the photo of the buckle - the prong of the buckle was installed considerably off-center. However, in use this is not an issue nor can it be discerned when worn. Just an annoyance to me, personally.<br /><br />I received a size 36, as can be seen in the photo as well.<br /><br />Overall this is a high quality leather product with good stitching and a quality metal buckle. I have used this for many months now, a couple times a week probably, with both formal and informal clothing."
4.0,My brother said they fit great.  Comfortable!
4.0,I like the necklace it is beautiful it is standard for its price. I would not have paid anymore for it
4.0,"I am 6’ 3” and wanted some pants for playing sports outdoors in cooler weather.  These work for me.  They are not quite long enough, but at 6’ 3”, I am used to “off the rack” clothing to not be an ideal fit. These are described as “slim fit jogger shorts”.  I’m a skinny guy and these are slim fit. I would describe the fabric as medium/lightweight,  twice as thick as t-shirt material but with a thermal look and feel. The waist drawstring is fairly flimsy, but so far it has performed well. The elastic waistband and ankles are snug but not tight. And the pockets are made out of the same material as the pants."
4.0,Look bigger than I thought :(( so kinda hard to do stackable ear party or multiple cartilage earrings on a row
4.0,"I bought these to go in my Lugz but they're much thinner than the Lugz originals.  So far, though, they're holding up."
4.0,Perfect for spring and fall.  Looks neat and clean.
4.0,"The quality of the suit is great.  The sizing is way off.  I ordered an XXL for my husband, who is 6'3&#34;.  It is too short through the body.  An XXL should have given him plenty of room."
4.0,"If you don’t like being covered in hair, this is perfect! It’s a little snug for me, but I’m a big big. The quality & function is definitely worth it. The mesh back is perfect!!!"
4.0,"Love this thing. I try to travel light, so this perfect-sized Tortuga is just the backpack I need. Although compact, it still held a week's worth of clothes and gear — 2 pr long pants, 2 pr shorts, 3 t-shirts, 5 pr briefs, 4 pr socks, 2 thermal shirts, sandals, bath kit, laptop, books, and more. Its clamshell design really makes packing easy, and it feels good — light and balanced — on my back. Can't wait for my next trip!"
4.0,The washing instructions said do not tuble dry but I dried it in the dryer anyway because it was much larger than I thought it would be. Rather tent-like. And YES it shrunk a lot! I think it will fit just fine now. It is slightly see-through.
4.0,Super cute outfit ! Fits just right !
4.0,"This was very good, however it felt just a touch small."
4.0,"I am giving this four stars, in spite of having a bust that is quite large, because the design of the dress allows for it to be tailored down rather easily. The waist is accurately sized, as are the arms and the hips, and the dress is attractive enough to be worn, when trying to protect yourself against harmful solar radiation. It isn't the nicest dress they have ever made, but the fabric can be dyed easily and the bust can be adjusted and it has those nice long Coolibar sleeves, that protect your arms. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
4.0,"I purchased this for a gift. It’s folded, and felt so it showed creases but it’s not a huge deal. It made for a cute little basket, and if they don’t use it as a diaper caddy they can use it for storage in the car."
4.0,These are really cute.  They have a wide piece of elastic in the waist band which can help suck things in.  I do find the legs roll up but I like the length of the legs when they stay down.
4.0,Very flattering..love the material
4.0,A little snug but I love these pants.
4.0,"This dress was very short-waisted. It really hits like an empire waistline, right under the bust. (I'm 5'7'' and large-chested.) I don't like that and almost returned it. I'm glad I didn't though, as I get tons of compliments when I wear it!"
4.0,"This definitely runs small. I wear a large sobi thought an xl would fit, nope. Had to order again in a xxl. Do not dry or it will shrink! I didn't return my first order as I just chose to give it to a much skinnier friend of mines. Size up 2 sizes if you want it to look like the model. I will also add that the quality of the material is good."
4.0,Thought it would be larger
4.0,These are great for the price. I have noticed a little wear on the balls of the studded pair but nothing serious.
4.0,"Perfect for my gypsy witch costume. The tall feather, however, was bent and broken during shipping. I didn't have time to send it back for another one. It still worked for what I needed that day."
4.0,Fits perfectly well
4.0,This is one of the better mask I HAVE to wear at Work
4.0,Perfect for bridesmaids
4.0,"These pants are very comfortable.  They fit very well, too.  The price is a bit high, but otherwise I like them."
4.0,A little small and a little flashy
4.0,A good product. It wish it were made of a stiffer material as it can be hard to find things in this soft sided bag.  Lots of good pockets though.
4.0,"They are super cute.  A bit big but, it is something the baby will easily grow into."
4.0,I absolutely love this bag!  It has a lot of pockets of different sizes.  It holds up well while traveling.  It is very attractive for its' practicality.  I only wish it was just a tad larger.
4.0,"Great shoes.  Lots of oos and ahhz. However, the wiring stopped working after a few wears.  The connection is not very sturdy...one shoe would occasionally light, but then it would no longer charge...seemed like the wire was not carrying the signal from the on button.  I dont see a way to repair or examine the wiring. These are morw for show than playing.  A real novelty shoe ."
4.0,"Great quality, durable. Only complaint is the size and texture of the picture window."
4.0,"It is good one, though the voice is a bit metallic."
4.0,This outfit was better than we thought it would be!
4.0,"Exactly what I needed to fix a similar clasp on my kids favourite pair of goggles. They are more secure and easier to clip than the original clasp! And I appreciate that this is a 2 pack so that if one does break, I have a back up.<br /><br />I would have appreciated an instruction leaflet or link to an instructional video on how to put the clasp onto the goggle straps (I didn't pay attention getting the old ones off) and it took me a while (and a lot of google image searching) to figure out how to get them on."
4.0,Wife loves her hat.
4.0,It was a tiny bit small for the size I ordered. It’s a tad tight around the lower belly/hip area. The neck can tug and be a little tight as well. It is a cute sweater though!
4.0,I like the dress but was disappointed that the bottom was navy blue and the top is black. Wish I had read that somewhere.
4.0,I love these and they are very comfortable but my legs looks like hail damage in these
4.0,make sure you get either for adults or children
4.0,Love the dress fit. However less then 2 mins on the lace ripped at the seam. Luckily it was covered by my arm.
4.0,"The white lines almost ruin it. Otherwise, a very nice dress with very good quality material."
4.0,I prefer hat with top zipped out.  It shades most of my face and is very light.
4.0,Beautiful colors. Just a tad bit shorter than I like. However I am 5'8. I do recommend.. nice quality sweater material.
4.0,"Looked very small when I took it out of the package, but it actually fit very nicely. My daughter in the picture wears a xl and we bought an xl."
4.0,Super soft! Just wish you could see the logo more clearly.
4.0,La calidad de la ropa y lo colorida
4.0,"This dress is beautiful, runs a bit small but its great for a night out. You’re man will be blown away of how sexy and flattering it makes your body look."
4.0,"I usually ware a medium so that is what I ordered. The material is of good quality, but a little see through. It is really long almost comes down to my knees. I don't plan on mailing back because I can wear as a dress or if you tuck it in can still be worn as a shirt."
4.0,"I love this necklace and would have given it the complete 5 stars, except that I ordered it in black and received silver. It's a great necklace, a big hit, once everyone realizes what it is!"
4.0,Got these as a gift for my dad. Had to return for a larger size- they seem to run small. Other than that he loved them.
4.0,Nice look but basically not even Silver plated....
4.0,Very pretty! I've received a lot of compliments on this dress. I love the bright color and floral pattern (I got the pink).  It's a little tight across the chest so I would recommend going up a size if your bigger in the chest ares. I got the large and it's perfect length when I wear small chunky sandals; I'm 5'3&#34;.
4.0,Runs SMALL. I love this top. It came in and it is good quality but runs small. I even got the largest size they had but it isn't flattering. So definitely bump up sizing.
4.0,A decent watch for the money. Doesn't look cheap. Does have some weird quirks.
4.0,"The dress fits okay in the body, but the chest is huge. I am 5’3, 148lbs, 36C bust and ordered a medium. Even if I pin the chest, it would look awkward because there is so much extra material that can’t be hidden. I’m reluctant to get a small because it may be too tight in the body. Returning unfortunately."
4.0,"Summer, here I come! This dress will have you dreaming of the beach in no time. With off-the-shoulder sleeves and adjustable straps, the dress is comfortable and cute. The lace and lightweight fabric make it filmy and feminine. Although lined, the material is super sheer. Even the additional layer over the bodice does not cover up what’s underneath. Therefore, I will use the dress as a beach cover-up rather than use it for regular wear. This limits its versatility. Personally, I would have preferred a less revealing lining. As it is, the dress—which really is very cute—is going to be used for the beach only."
4.0,The chain is beautiful. It just tangles way too easily
4.0,Colors are vibrant but I feel as though it feels a little tight... But it's just my preference.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful! I chose the white dress with pink flowers and it is so pretty. The quality is really good. The material is like a thick cotten, and the stitching is very nice and neat. I'll be using this with a petticoat, I think it makes the dress look amazing.  I think it's a nice length, I'm 5'3 and the dress just goes about an inch past my knees. The skirt is a full circle skirt, when you stretch the skirt out it is wide, and if you spin around it will go up.<br /><br /> The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is kind of big for a size small. I did measure myself before buying. I was able to find an easy way to fix it though, by adding a belt so that it didn't seem so loose on me, and then pinning the bust area together to tighten the front a bit, and it provides some modesty. The sweetheart neckline is not that deep, but I like to cover my chest a bit. I can't wait to actually wear it out. I'm so excited."
4.0,so vintage and unique. over priced though
4.0,"Thee top is cute and fits well (true to size).  I only gave it 4 stars because it is thin and I am not sure it is worth the money, but I am going to keep it."
4.0,The material of this suit is pretty good. I will say this is a heavy suit. Great for training. Not so much for competition. This suit is part of a three suit rotation and it is holding up better than one that cost almost twice as much and has a swoosh on it.
4.0,"I’m not sure how I feel about this, it’s smaller than expected and the higher cut on the sides is kind of weird. I will say it’s a nice material but just to snug at the top for my taste. I ordered a medium which is what I normally am but just to tight  at  the top. For reference, I’m 5’7, 137 lbs and 34DD/DDD. Also a mama of two, youngest being 6 months so still nursing. (Definitely not nursing friendly [which I wasn’t expecting] in case anyone was wondering lol)"
4.0,"This fit as expected and will work fine under my renaissance faire dress, but the material is not high quality. You definitely need a slip under it if you are planning on wearing it without an overdress. It is fairlly sheer.  I hope it softens up a little after washing. It is a little stiff right out of the bag. The cream is a nice color, nearly white but not quite. Way brighter and less yellowy than the photo."
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings, but are not hypoallergenic so could not wear them as often as I would have liked"
4.0,"pretty and nice packaging , they are just very large but you can squeeze them smaller."
4.0,"These definitely work as advertised, but my husband finds them to be awkward feeling. I keep telling him he'll get used to it..."
4.0,"I actually have wide feet (skinny girl with wide feet).  If a pair of shoes fit me with out squeezing at the toes it's a victory.  I only wore these once so I'm hoping they will stretch and give a little over time b/c although I say the width &#34;fit as expected&#34; it actually was a  bit narrow for my feet...but i do have slightly wider feet than the average.<br /><br />Great quality, awesome casual posh look.  I'd recommend."
4.0,Seems to work well. I like the features. The battery installation was a little difficult. I had to use the edge of a pocket knife to split the ear muffs apart. Just got these so now I can't wait to get to the range. I will update you on their performance.
4.0,A little bit bigger than I would like but really well organized. Wish there was a slightly smaller version of it
4.0,Pretty but a little too big for a pendant and the hook it hangs on keeps twisting upside down.
4.0,Too small to be used over my glasses though it is of good quality n doesn't fog.
4.0,Looks like the picture. Pretty top. It does run large. I purchased a small because the xs was not available and I had to cut and re-sew the straps to be tighter otherwise it was way too big. Maybe the xs would’ve been a perfect fit.
4.0,The fabric is super soft and the fitting is as expected. It is a tad thin so definitely plan to wear as leggings and not pants. The stretch waist band is also not hemmed in so it gets twisted underneath the fabric easily and you’ll have to flip and adjust it regularly.
4.0,"I got this for my friend that is going to school to be a nurse. Maybe I didn't read the description but I was hoping it was a bit smaller and discreet for wearing everyday. Although it was big, and if you're getting this for someone, it's the thought that counts, and its very pretty!"
4.0,this is an essential add on for a 2240
4.0,Needs buttons for mask straps. Other than that’s it’s great!
4.0,"I used this for a hunted house. We were indoors and couldn't use the old gas saw with no chain trick and professional specialty props were too expensive to even consider. I looked at real electric chain saws, but they are either corded, short battery life, and sounded wimpy. What I did was tape a lavalier wireless mic to the toy and amplified it through a speaker. Its the sound that really scares people and having it controllable by the actor wielding it was essential. It survived all four days of the haunt with only the little spinning chain malfunctioning. It feels on the cheaper side, but it has some weight and the handles didn't break. The saw is realistic in size and shape. The paint job isn't awful and can be improved easily, people shouldn't be able to get a good look at it anyway if your haunted house is scary enough."
4.0,"When my daughter wanted to order these bracelets from China, which are a 3rd of the price of one at a retail store, I assumed they would be junk and discouraged her.  They took about a month to arrive and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality.  If they are &#34;fakes,&#34; they are a pretty decent knock off.  And really, does anyone actually believe that the water is from Mt. Everest and the black from dead sea mud?"
4.0,"Nice fit!  Accentuates your curves.  Looking at the reviews, I bought mine one size larger, and it fits nicely.  Good quality material."
4.0,"They look nice but don’t stay up like ad photos and the posts are bit thick. I contacted the seller and they informed me: “ Our posts are made of sterling silver to ensure they're hypoallergenic. Sterling silver is a soft metal, which is why you may find them easy to bend. As far as them being too thick to pass through, we have not heard that before. Perhaps your piercings are smaller than average.<br /><br />We always want our customers to be happy, so if you'd like to return them, we do offer free and easy returns!”. They didn’t fit me but I gave them 4 stars for great customer service."
4.0,It was more fitted than slouchy but nice quality
4.0,Fits a bit large so size down and also a bit thick material so it gets kinda hot. But overall great product!
4.0,Tried it on when I received it. Fit find just haven't worn it yet.
4.0,Made my daughter super happy. Just wish it was a little bigger and a little bit better quality
4.0,It's not as colorful as the picture but it's really nice I get compliments on them all the time so yes! Worth the money!
4.0,I bought this watch for my son he needed a waterproof watch and it works just fine
4.0,"It's a little big, but with socks or tights it works. These shoes are darling!!!"
4.0,Love it nice and neat
4.0,"Just what i was looking for!  Quality leather strap that isn't thin and cheap looking!  A great buy for the price.  It pairs perfectly with my converted pocket watch.  I was worried that it would be really thin leather, but i am very pleased.  It is nearly a perfect fit for my wrists (7 1/4"")."
4.0,Worked great for 550 cord survival bracelet. Could be stronger if were made of metal but the price is right for plastic.
4.0,"Nice design, good quality, vintage look well made."
4.0,"This band is good as a replacement band when original band/strap wears out ir breaks. I have replaced bands on 2 of my watches with this model. I like the look and deployment clasp is cool. Takes some work to fit to your wrist size. You have to remove spring bars and cut rubber at even spaces to make it fit right. Tools needed would be sharp blade of scissors and pin bar remover tool. Clasp is not super sturdy, but locks tight and seems secure with daily wear.."
4.0,"Perfect Fit for the size I got (large). The material is decent. Not really see through except maybe some certain situations, but great for under longer shirts and/or dresses. the length is mid calf. I did not realize when purchasing that there's a small/thin strip of lace at the end of the leggings but its not super noticeable. And hidden when I wear with Uggs. I liked them & the price that I went and bought them in another color as well. Great deal."
4.0,"Love it. Thick, heavy, warm, but order one size up. If you have a beer belly + 2 sizes, made for slimmer body. I would send it back for a large size but don't want to deal with shipping hassle. I've been looking for a Robe like this for over a year. Great price. Washed and dried @ medium heat with minimal shrinkage If the size was correct definitely 5 stars."
4.0,nice quality plugs and tapers work very well for my stretching purposes
4.0,Great quality!!! Runs a little big.
4.0,"Got the shoes, so absolutely adorable, but won’t give a 5 star rating as they are a very dark orange color, almost like they were dyed near blue jeans. Still cute and I think worth the price!!"
4.0,I'm into value watches and this one fits the bill.  Nice looking and unique watch.  Keeps good time (+/- 7 seconds a day).  Looks good on my NATO bands.<br /><br />Only reason not 5 stars is the crown bent when I initially set it (my fault but still) but I was able to realign and did not harm watch.  Also I did not like thick leather strap that it came on.<br /><br />Overall I would purchase this again.
4.0,"Great product! I use this in place of a watch because the band on watches irritate my wrist. This necklace is very light yet sturdy feeling. Though I didn’t realize it didn’t have a button or anything to open it with and the door is spring loaded to snap shut. It is still really nice and easy to use, it keeps time well and doesn’t tick loudly, and it is easy to read. The only thing I would criticize is how easy the links come apart on the chain where it connects to the little clip. The link is easy to squeeze back together, I just wish it wouldn’t come apart."
4.0,"It has not striped, its a good belt"
4.0,Material not cotton. Customer service is amazing.
4.0,The shirt looks very much like the photo..  the material is a bit thin.
4.0,4 star only Because they unscrew easily resulting in losing the gem. Idk if it's Bevause the threads are short or what but for the price I will just keep tightening them. Colors are nice and bright on the gems.
4.0,It is nice because large dies (50/48 46/44) are included. There is no button to lock it during the pressure and the dies should be deeper for thick watches.
4.0,Bought these for my daughter to wear to the beach. They fit well and worked great.
4.0,Looks like real leather and has lots of room with pockets.  Very nice!
4.0,"The dress is very cute, and fits my granddaughter well. The fabric is thinner than I expected. But with tights it will be perfect."
4.0,Just a bit larger than expected but very nicely done. Gave as a gift to a friend.
4.0,"Having had multiple experiences where cheap, Chinese clothing was way too small, I ordered this is the size 1X. I normally wear a size large or xlarge. To my surprise, this was very large on me (maybe one size too large).<br /><br />The material is thin and a little see through, but soft and has a nice drape to it. If you wear it tight, you would see every bulge. The material is also easily wrinkled. That said, the stitching is very well done and crotchet work looks more expensive than it is.<br /><br />This is a nice casual top and overall, I am happy with it."
4.0,"I'm usually about a US 14 in pants, so I got both a L and an XL. This review is for the L. Pulling it up on my thighs was a struggle, so I gave up and went with the XL. The light blue print with lemons was lovely and the suit seemed well constructed."
4.0,Very cute bathing suit but bottoms fit a bit small. Other than that it worked out great for my Jamaica vacation.
4.0,"They are pretty, but a little bit too big."
4.0,Beautiful macrame but moonstone is very cloudy but overall very pretty and comfy to wear
4.0,"The color is definitely darker than pictured - by a lot.  It's more of a hunter green mostly rather than the pretty light turquoise that's pictured.  That said, it's still pretty comfortable and fits ok even on my small wrist.  So I guess I'll keep it, it's just not quite as bright and summery as I had hoped."
4.0,"I like these alot, I bought them for my seven year old for her birthday because she was having a snowflake themed party.  She wore them every day for almost a week, until randomly one fell out and we can not find it. They looked very pretty on her though."
4.0,I really would have like this product if it wasn't for were the sting ties right between your legs. The string hangs too low.  If it didn't have that then it would be a great peace.
4.0,"Looks and feels great, no iPad compartment!!"
4.0,"My 15 year old son used this as his good luck charm at his baseball games because every time he wore it he believed it increased his RBI’s and fielding. The only thing is, I wish it were made in bigger sizes because it starting to fit like a choker on my now 6 feet tall son."
4.0,"This shirt feels soft. The fabric is slightly light for a french terry (the navy sleeves moreso than the indigo floral body). It has good stretch. I've only washed and worn it a few times so far but it has held up fine and I'm back to order another color because I like the heavier weight of this shirt as compared to a typical cheap tee because it feels a bit more polished. The sizing on this is typical of what I would buy from other brands.<br /><br />The only slight negatives are that I don't love the shirring on the sides (has a slight maternity aesthetic to me) and the arm fabric being slightly thin (for french terry, but still thick compared to double-brushed polyester), but these are minor."
4.0,Pinches arm but it’s cute
4.0,I've only worn it 4 days but the material seems trustworthy and durable. The only issue is sometime I wish the knotches were a bit closer together. Its a &#34;Goldie Locks&#34; case were I am in a &#34;too tight&#34; or &#34;too loose&#34; predicament.
4.0,"The lingerie is beautiful and sexy, but when it comes down to unsnapping the clip it is very difficult. It not as easy to undo as a bra clip. I mean it is a real mood setter, when it comes down to it . it really can blow the moment. If it wasn't for this it would be perfect."
4.0,"This is a little short and there were some knitting issues with one of the arms. Also, there was a VERY strong chemical smell when it arrived. But overall it was a good buy for the price!"
4.0,Exactly as pictured. Arrived on time and in the box. Condition: New.<br /><br />Good summer sandal for easy off and on.
4.0,"I love the patterns! My only concern is the durability of the zippers, but time will tell!"
4.0,Nice belt - fits well - they run very long - no need to order a size up.  I bought it for hiking but now wear it daily...
4.0,cool man cool
4.0,"This is one of the nicest scarves I have - and believe me I have a lot!  I am a little shocked at the low price - the quality would warrant a much higher price at most department stores, but I am always happy to find a bargain.  This is advertised a being grey in color, but it is more of a grey-blue and is the perfect color to wear with jeans, I just love it.  It is soft and does indeed remind me a bit of cashmere - sort of silky soft.  I would highly recommend this - both for the quality and the price."
4.0,"These fit very comortably, and stretched a bit so that they were looser than I'd like. I bought these as my first pair of climbing shoes though, so I knew this would be a learning experience.<br /><br />After 2-3 months, the toe started peeling away. I was a bit upset, but these were really cheap so not a huge loss.<br /><br />Overall I wouldn't dismiss these as a beginners pair. They'll last you long enough to know whether you want to continue climbing or not at a reasonable price and offer a very comfortable experience. I replaced these with La Sportiva Katana, and there was an immense improvement in climbing, albeit considerably more expensive."
4.0,"Beautiful dress - it was just too small.  I ordered up a size, but it looks like I'll need to order up another size. I decided it's worth the effort of returning and ordering again.  My advice is to go up 2 sizes when you order."
4.0,"I ended up returning this dress because I do not like the material. I have a small chest and the top of the dress did not fit right because of this. I likely could have exchanged it for a size smaller and it would have fit my upper body a bit better. The material is very stretchy so going down a size would not be an issue.  The colors and length of this dress are nice, just as pictured."
4.0,Absolutely beautiful and versatile.  Chain can hold pendant vertically or horizontally.  4 stars due to an area on one knot where a flaw is in the metal.
4.0,"I wore these to last weekends Spartan Beast and they did well, really no complaints. Orange was a good color, not too bright but colorful enough to pick me out of the crowd."
4.0,"Nice hat... but not a whole lot of adjustment. Even though my head is only a 7 3/8 it is open quite a bit, it's secure but not much overlap.."
4.0,"I am giving 4 stars because they arrived wrapped in bubble wrap with no box and because we haven't yet tried them out since they're a Christmas present. The shoes look great and the lights are bright and beautiful. My daughter wears a 4 and I ordered big, had a 5 in mind, and got a size 37. They fit as expected with nice toe room and look great in action. They did come with a charging cable and I found that I'd the flashing is adjusted while they are plugged in it syncs them up."
4.0,Looked great with the prom dress at a reasonable price compared to stores.
4.0,Absolutely beautiful! The only downside is that it can hurt when putting it on and off.
4.0,At first look they seem perfect what I need.  I’ll update once I get to crafting with them
4.0,"Just as described.  Fits nicely inside button up tops, significant enough that it doesn't disappear.  Arrived intact and undamaged.  I can see quite a bit of versatility with this."
4.0,kind of flimsy
4.0,"This bra looks like a sports bra to me, or a bra for very large breasted individuals! I am not one of those. I typically wear a 34B, and that is the size equivalency I ordered. When I opened it, it looked huge!!<br /><br />After putting it on and wearing a couple of times, here is my assessment…<br />Cons:<br />- too many hooks for my needs, very wide strap left me indifferent<br />- the padding does not lay super straight without some finagling, and even then, they moved up or folded over at the top while I was wearing it<br />- white bra with nude straps is unappealing to me<br /><br />Pros:<br />- super comfortable<br />- No underwire<br /><br />I might recommend this for large chested people who need more support - may want to remove the pads."
4.0,"Beautiful  purse, I love it.<br />At first I was a little disappointed  in the  color but it has grown  on Me and I like it now."
4.0,"Nice white belt..good quality and built to last..I ordered two belts, both were too large so I sent them back and reordered a smaller size which arrived within two days.  The tan belt I previously ordered was a bit too orange in color for me."
4.0,"Right out of the package I can’t say that these pants automatically make you feel that you’re holding a garment that is of the quality of a big name brand, but then, you’re not paying the price. Mine are size 34, but fit a little bigger in the waist. However, they’re not so big as to bunch up when I put the belt on. The pants are black and the belt is a pretty nice, albeit a little cheap, looking green, white, black woven design. The cheapness mostly lies in the buckle. It’s a spring-loaded type of buckle that I’ve had fail on much more expensive pants, so I’m not having a lot of faith that this one will last. We’ll see. The belt is actually long enough to fit someone with a much large (I’m talking 40+) size waist. They use a clasp to hold the excess belt length in place. It’s not a terrible thing, but I think they could do better. The “fleece” inside actually feels pretty good. The material of the pants has an elasticity to it, but not too much, which I like. The waist has elastic and probably stretches at least an inch over original size. There are regular front top pockets that are nice and roomy, with fairly thin nylon inside. There are angled front leg zippers on both legs. I struggle to call them cargo pockets, but they are still pretty roomy. Certainly plenty of room for a large cell phone. There are back pockets on both sides, which I really like. I won’t buy pants that don’t have a left side rear pocket, and to have on both sides is a plus. Inseam is a little over 30 inches.  Made in China."
4.0,These are indeed thicker than the other brands. I don't know how long these lenses will last but so far they look good
4.0,I buy a lot from this componey and have never been disappointed. I am docking a star for the fact that it does run smaller then the other products I have gotten from them.
4.0,Everything thanks please make it come sooner
4.0,"I got this dress for my tween daughter, who typically wears medium to large shirts (depending on fit) and around size 10 jeans. We opted to get the dress in a large, which fits her loosely but isn’t huge, and is about knee-length. The material has a decent amount of stretch, but the seams for the ruffles aren’t stretchy, so those areas are more uncomfortable. My daughter is not a fan of the uneven ruffle style of the dress, though I think it looks cute on her. The dress is about the thickness of a typical t-shirt, so it provides adequate coverage. I’ve had no issues washing the dress on the gentle cycle and hanging to dry."
4.0,It fits really a nice loose comfy sweatshirt
4.0,"it was a little bigger than expected but it was still comfortable and looked fine ( for reference im 5’1, roughly 115, a D cup and i ordered a small)"
4.0,This is a great outfit.  Love the design. The jeans are so soft.  I took the rope belt out immediately though.  Wouldn't have tied/worn well and wasn't useful.  The shirt is also very soft. Ordered one size up and fits very well. I wish they had lots more outfits to choose from.
4.0,"Orient watches are a great value for your money, the pictures on the computer do not do the watch justice. If like the watch in the online photo you will LOVE the watch in person!!!"
4.0,Had to return the silver with gold spike twice haven't had any problems with the gold one.
4.0,"I bought this to wear to work and it fits well, not too long on me even though I'm pretty short. I like the color and design, but I kind of wish it had pockets like other pencil skirts from Grace Karin do. The material is fairly thick, it's not see through and doesn't show panty lines at all. It is a little noisy and stiff though, but overall a good professional style skirt for the price."
4.0,Fair support
4.0,"Bought it for my daughter, she loves it"
4.0,It sits a bit crooked because one side is noticeably heavier and it's a little uncomfortable to wear unless you install padding around the nose.<br /><br />It is beautiful though and great quality.
4.0,It's a nice sun glass in every thing like a frame and lens
4.0,Love this sweater... fits just right and looks great on.. wear it to work.
4.0,"Pros:<br />-Its very cute<br />-Looks like the picture<br />-a little longer than I expected but not a bad thing(didn't pay for express shipping)<br />-inexpensively pretty<br /><br />Cons-<br />Not really a con I can think of we will see once. My daughter comes back and I can give it to her.<br /><br />Notes:<br /> iIt's like kids/costume jewelry and it seems like decent quality(but i mean can i really complain at the price i paid). I bought this for my daughter's 8th birthday and I like it. It's very cute(I know I've said that alot) but it's the truth. I think she will love it. as it didn't come til about 2 weeks after her bday (everything else she got came on time, I just didn't bother to pay shipping to get this since it was so cheap) she hasn't seen it or worn it so I will have to update with more pictures to show better quality when she's back (see yall in Sept)"
4.0,"This is a really cute shirt but it fits a bit more snug than I would prefer. The sizing is accurate, it's just cut on the slim side. There's nothing fancy, just a solid t- shirt that goes with anything. Size up if you don't want a slim fit!"
4.0,"It's like really awkward prison underwear. As far as butt lift, absolutely not, the opposite effect for me. And difficult  to pull back up and smooth out properly once you are clothed with your bra one. Somewhat slimming but not enough to justify the cons. I am 140lbs 5 ft 3 in with 2 c sections, and not that bad out of shape actually but looking for more than this can provide."
4.0,"Was nice, but did not come with the bow on the shirt."
4.0,Bra fit well around and over shoulders but cup size to big.  I will return for one of better fit.
4.0,Nice looking on the inside but the material inside feels cheap and the inner pocket zipper broke the first day. But great for the price.
4.0,"The product was the compression I was looking for and material was tighter than the silky kind I previously used. However, I still feel my shin splits at my step class which is why I bought them."
4.0,"I usually don't write reviews, but I seen so many bad reviews on this purse! I just got it in today because I needed a last minute purse for a wedding I will be attending tomorrow & this matched perfectly with my outfit! I carry my life in my purse so it's big enough to carry all my stuff but it doesn't look extremely big and over baring like some tote purses! It doesn't look fake at all unless you are a purse expert! I love it & it looks exactly like the picture except the leopard print is sparkly which isn't a bad thing! The only problem I have with it is the metal, some of its gold & some of its rose gold but you can't really tell unless you are staring at it! It was definitely worth the money & the shipping was fast!"
4.0,"I really wanted to love these sunglasses, they look just as pictured and come with a case. What drew me into them was the black and they really are dark and keep the sunlight out. But they were just too small for my face and I would say I do not have a large face. These ended up fitting my 9 year old. If they had a larger version I would definitely purchase them."
4.0,"I bought this for the sole purpose of lounging around in a cover-up and a bikini for a tropical getaway at a resort. And used for this purpose, I think it's very pretty/feminine and does the job.<br />I would most definitely not wear this as a dress with normal undergarments on, as it is completely translucent... Unless of course, you don't plan on keeping it on for very long ;-) In which case, this can double as a sexy nightie<br />To elaborate on previous reviews, there is a separate low back-tie (almost like a low apron string) to help keep the front booby area more snug to your chest. I, too, think it looks a wee bit out of place but hey, it's a bathing suit cover up..  I untied it then tied it back and definitely think the overall look is more seamless when tied in the back.<br />If you're expecting an overt high slit in the leg region, you'll be disappointed. There's a middle panel of fabric that is overlapped by the side panels of fabric for the flowy part. You will not show any leg unless you're completely windswept with like 60+ mph winds<br /><br />That being said, I still love it and think it's a great buy. For reference, I'm 5'6&#34; and 130.. Length is perfect for flip flops without dress dragging on the floor"
4.0,very comfortable for work.
4.0,"it is a beautiful piece, but so massive, I didn't expect that, it works well if you attach it to a rose quartz beads neckless."
4.0,"Nice dress for the price, a little big in the hips but I can take it in. I am larger on top that in my hips and wear A size 12. That is what I ordered. Pleased with the dress and would recommend."
4.0,"The material is not breathable hence more sweating, not comfortable for working out bc of that but overall cute style."
4.0,"I love Brighton jewelry, and I love this bracelet. For some reason I didn’t expect the side chains to separate from the inner chains.  It’s still beautiful, and I wear it every day. Surprisingly, I have not received any compliments on it."
4.0,"Problems, but all good in the end, I hope.<br /><br />I labeled &#34;fit as expected&#34; but add this caveat. According to the size chart I fall into the Large size slot. I have a very similar hat sized Large that doesn't fit as I like. I bought from this seller in size XL and it fits as I like! Great!<br /><br />The problem I have is SNAPS! I say that in ALLCAPS because I don't like them and I don't want them, but I got them. Also because the photos do not show them and the description un-clearly mentions them. I phoned the seller and they are sending the no-snaps version that I wanted, with a return label for the unwanted snaps hat. Seller really should take inventory, write a better description, and update photos to let buyers know their full options.<br /><br />Lastly but not a deal breaker for me. The description says it's 100% cotton. Label on inside of hat 60% cotton, 40% polyester.<br /><br />Will update once I receive the replacement, hopefully no-snaps hat.<br /><br />Replacement came with no snaps. Also no adjustment strap. Also it's a fishing hat not the boonie style hat like the picture. Replacement IS 100% cotton. Seller told me to keep the snaps-hat. Over all, happy with product and seller. I think I'll just pop out the snaps on the original hat and live with the holes."
4.0,I will re-order.
4.0,"Pretty dress , not the material I expected<br />Too tight for"
4.0,A little thin but work just fine
4.0,My husband hates anything with a logo. He really likes this hat. Will order more
4.0,it's a little big from arm side
4.0,"Nice shoe, but was hoping for better comfort when standing on feet for hours."
4.0,"It is a little harder than I expected, and the hood doesn't totally extend over my eyes but I do enjoy this pillow."
4.0,"Color is vibrant! Very thin material and is shorter than expected. I’m 5’7 and will have to wear it at the beach or with pants, but I love it!"
4.0,These were fun to create gifts for friends.  Due to the amount of them I was able to experiment with different effects! My favorite ones were made with redwood! That i ordered previously. These are such a great deal I couldn't pass them up!
4.0,Good color lenses fits well stays where you put them.
4.0,"I bought this to replace an old purse which had been ruined. It was similar in price. Slightly smaller, but I thought I would be fine with that because I never filled the old one to capacity. Loosing an inch here and there DID make a difference, though. That's not the purses' fault. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that it has the look and feel of a lunch box. The material is very lunchbox-y. I decided I can't get used to the way it looks and the lost space. However it is exactly as pictured and described, so 4 stars."
4.0,"My husband bought this for me as a Christmas gift. It is very lightweight, super cute, and came with two wooden bead bracelets. The band is made from a lightweight suede-like material that I'm pretty sure will need to be replaced come sweaty summertime, but I am pleased overall with this product."
4.0,"I love the style, color and fit, but it is pretty thin fabric."
4.0,Nice but smaller then I thought they would be. I like them.
4.0,The price is decent . I will suggest buy a size a little bigger than what you'd normally get for your kids just to be on the safe side.
4.0,Very soft. Great for Baby Shark enthusiast!  Fit is on the large side. But not too big. Washes well with no fading or shrinkage.  Would recommend.
4.0,Excellent product and better value that similar straps.
4.0,Love the just below waist fit & cotton covering on elastic
4.0,"Hat was good. Came in a small box but after steaming it, it was great. I loved that you can use either the headband or the clip.<br />I ended up adding flowers to it since I wore it to a Kentucky derby themed party."
4.0,"I got this tote to use as a beach bag.  It held a lot; however, I would have preferred it to have an inside zippered pocket or two to keep some items stowed away but able to be found quickly."
4.0,"Like feel on foot, but very tight on calves."
4.0,"Delivered fast. I get a lot wonderful comments about my necklace. Very fragile though by fragile I mean cheap, but it's not that bad. I just can't leave it on all the time and to put it up I have to be very careful. I just think this necklace is phenomenal, but I bought it for 15.99 and don't think anyone should pay more than that"
4.0,They appear a little lighter grey than photo but they are squat proof which is a plus. Over all comfortable
4.0,"The shoe was slightly smaller in length than the size purchased, but overall, a good fit and very comfortable."
4.0,"My husband needed these due to damage to a finger, they didn't hold up well in his line of work."
4.0,"They are a far cry from Crye Precision pouches, and a lot less expensive. However they are close to the same quality as Blackhawk gear, and about the same price range."
4.0,I did not like the necklace around the orcbe.
4.0,Looks really cute on.  Its very true to size.
4.0,Very cute and cozy top but it had a small hole in it. I was able to fix it since it was right by the hem.
4.0,"I didn’t pay attention to the size so it really is larger than I needed however the product itself is well made with no uneven seams or jagged edges. The actual look and design is just too cute to resist!  I have placed them on my grandchild head and I know the y are gonna look so cute! It doesn’t take a baby long to grow into much less out of things so, it won’t be long at all!"
4.0,"Good quality cotton, picture was exactly like shirt.  Good buy."
4.0,I do like the dress it looks a bit different then I was expecting maybe a tad bit cheaper then I had pictured.. the sequins r much larger then I would have liked.. but all in all I do like the way it fits my body it is a bit big but I am very small chested.. I ordered a small and am 5'3&#34;  and 117lbs if u have my build I would recommend an XS of u would like it snug on ur body;)
4.0,Thinner then i thought it was going to be but still a great top !!
4.0,They don’t look cool in person
4.0,It has a small hole on the seam. I can fix it. Good thing it was ordered in advance and not for day of performance.
4.0,Pretty nice but a little small
4.0,These trunks are a bit snug but overall very comfortable for competition swim trunks. They are relatively quick drying and have held their color for over a dozen times in the pool.
4.0,"I love Black....and bright red....I would prefer the flower to be larger, but this cap is charming and classy...so gotta have it!"
4.0,"Not really living the fabric but they are fine otherwise, go with a size up if you like more coverage"
4.0,"I put &#34;fits as expected&#34; because somehow I ordered a Med when the order was supposed to be for an XL - it fit like a Medium. I bought it for my daughter who's around 5'4&#34;, 190lbs. I bought it as a work shirt for her, she is a server in a nice Italian restaurant. We both thought that the shirts looked good, the tailoring was nice and the material seemed very durable and easy to wash - perfect for a restaurant server! I went to order 2 more in the correct size, but alas, they are sold out. I'll update my review if we ever get to buy the correct size. Incredibly good value for the price! Please restock soon!"
4.0,Size fit well just a tad bit heavy on the face.
4.0,My 8 yr old loves this game. I was a little nervous putting it together because I had to shave a couple of posts to get the men on but that was the only problem I had?
4.0,"Looks exactly like the picture. But I'm a size 12 (5'9) so this fits me like loose t-shirt. Still cute tho, I'm glad I bought it"
4.0,"This tank top is so cute! The only thing is the arm holes are a bit big. When you put it on it doesn't fully cover the breast area (half your boob is sticking out). So you may have to wear another tank top or cami underneath. Other than that, I like it and it's comfy."
4.0,"Great quality but ran a little big, the bottoms were fine since you can tie them tighter but the top was too big and I couldn't fix it"
4.0,Too big had to send it back
4.0,"My nephew requested that I buy this for him and when I saw him at his mom's party, the first thing he did was show the watch on his wrist and he was grinning from ear to ear.  Glad to oblige and made my nephew happy!"
4.0,Love the suit
4.0,Very cute and like the twist on.
4.0,THe manufacture size was a little off.  I used that as a guide and so the flip flops are a little tight.  They do fit alright because my foot covers all of the surface with out excess.  After wearing them for awhile you get used to them.  I would recommend them to others.
4.0,Were to ride my Bike they do run more true to size no need to go up a size
4.0,It looks nice but it's a little bit too small
4.0,"The gloves are warm and heavy duty. The sizing runs large though, it's more like an extra large."
4.0,"Only 4 stars as it feels heavy.<br /><br />Otherwise, it looks great and my 3 years old daughter loves it."
4.0,"They have an elastic strap so they don’t fall, very comfy!!"
4.0,The shirt is very cold i’ve been wearing it to sleep af so it’s always warm 10/10
4.0,"The nightgown is light and airy, the color (blue) exactly as pictured, and the embroidery a nice extra touch. It is, however, huge. I think I could have ordered it two sizes smaller and still had ample room. But, it's nightgown, so its voluminousness isn't a critical issue."
4.0,Bought for 2 sons both love them and say so warm
4.0,"I had ordered the 22mm black and white model after reading the reviews. The product arrived on time. Replacing my old straps was a breeze task with the tools bundled with the package. But the 4 pins that came along were of the wrong size (20mm I guess) and hence did not fit my watch. Eventually i had to reuse my old pins, hoping that they will hold good for some more time. Apart from this glitch, the straps looked good, ang have a new look to my 6 year old watch."
4.0,"The hat is super comfortable & warm, very fluffy, and feels like a real hat, not a costume prop. The emblem is already attached (no attachment issues that some have noted) and it's removable & of decent quality. The furry material is very soft. The only gripe: all sizes Large and below are quite small. I bought this for my 13 year old son, and assumed the sizing was adult sizing. It took us 3 tries to get the right fit (we tried Small, Medium, and then jumped all the way up to Extra Large which finally worked out). If you're above the age of 10 you'll probably need large or xl. On the upside, they made it extremely easy to return & exchange, so that made up for the hassle. The other warning is our shipping on the last version we bought was delayed several times, so be sure to order well in advance if you need it for a specific timeline."
4.0,"It's SUPER small. You shouldn't plan on using it to carry a cell phone or medium-large wallet because there is definitely no space for it. I was able to carry a small wallet, some lip gloss, lip stain, very small bottle of lotion,  and that's about it without being super stuffed. My cell phone, which is an S9, couldn't even fit by itself. However, it is super cute and unique. It's also very well made and good quality. When I wore it, I received lots of compliments."
4.0,Beautiful. Bigger than I expected. I’m very happy with this purchase
4.0,"a little bit cheap looking.<br />but it is really pretty when you wear.<br />I really love the design.<br />As a clumsy person, I dropped it once or twice. It still stay intact. :)<br />The customers service is really good too. They take their responsibility so well.<br /><br />(I received the wrong pairs of earring first, they exchanged with the actual one)"
4.0,"I was happy with the first band after 3 weeks, so I bought a second one with a different color. The first one was pretty durable in my opinion. Unlike my other band of a different brand which started to have fibers coming out from the areas touched with the velcro strip. The 2nd Huadea one, however, did not fit the quick release mechanism on both end. I can only get it to stay in place with the longer end on the lower side of the watch. The 1st one (Grey) worked fine on either way. It occurs to me the different color bands might have slightly different plastic thingy, and I was right. The proper working set has longer / deeper plastic on both ends while the newer one (Black Sand) has one end shorter. While those bands do look great and work properly on some copies, watch out for duds."
4.0,Thought that color would be truer navy blue. More of a total blue.
4.0,The gaps between the buttons are too big but I will fix it by adding more buttons because other than that the dress is ok. For a person with a larger chest clothes with buttons are a problem.
4.0,"WOCCI's Alligator Embossed Leather Watch Band is made of high-quality Italian leather and fits wrists up to 7.8"" in diameter.<br /><br />What I liked most about this watchband was its quality. When I received my Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch I immediately wanted to upgrade from the silicone band that was attached when it arrived. I purchased several bands including a couple of other leather ones. This one immediately caught my attention due to the pattern on the leather and the stability of the buckle.<br /><br />What I liked least about this watchband was its size. I have a large wrist and it was a struggle getting the band to close. After just a couple of days of usage, I could already see stress lines where the last two holes were being stretched to accommodate the circumference of my wrist. Wocci should have done a better job of anticipating the length necessary for the US market.<br /><br />Overall, I love the look, feel and quality of this watchband I don't wear it as often as I would like because of the tight fit. I wish Wocci had added a few centimeters more in length and they would've had a 5-star product on their hands. As it stands, I mostly recommend this band for those with small and medium-sized wrists. Those of us with larger wrists will likely have an uncomfortable experience with the band or break it altogether."
4.0,It was mildly uncomfortable around the thumb aside from that it was breathable and light weighted.
4.0,"I love this jacket thicker than expected, but not good for winter in upstate NY. Super cute! Also came with a hole in the pocket."
4.0,Good selection of colors. Much cheaper than L&L with the same great look. I have bought 18 bracelets so far and only one has a flaw - coming apart at the join.
4.0,Very nice! Shipping takes about a month but the product is very cute.
4.0,Nice one and the quality seem pretty good.
4.0,Beautiful color!!!!  wished it had a dart or 2 in the back to make a little more form fitting in back.
4.0,"Other than the elastic hurts my ears after a 12hr shift, these are wonderful."
4.0,Dress fit well but DONT WASH IT!!!!! I washed on cold and dried low and it SHRUNK! My beautiful dress is now a shirt. I wish the label on the dress said to dry clean instead of wash. Now it is the same size as one of my shirts.
4.0,"Very cute top, but lots of material — so much that it makes me feel a little like a balloon in the middle. Really nice fabric and great colors, though! I ordered a size down and could have easily gone two sizes down."
4.0,Very comfortable. Fit good except the band is a little large but okay. Will buy another pair.
4.0,This is a very nice statement piece. It arrived on time and as described. I had read reviews and expected some flattening but there was very little and a touch of steam perked ti right up. The hat looks exactly like it did int he picture - the color shape and style are right on. My only hesitation is the alligator clip it uses to hold to my hair. My hair is very smooth and I'm having to do some ratting and use additional bobby pins to keep it in place. Once it is secure it looks great and I get tons of compliments. I would definitely purchase again.
4.0,Light weighted. Looks great. Could use some airflow holes in the cap to prevent heat entrapment
4.0,"These shorts are great, fit great and feel great... but only one color? I would buy again if they had more than one choice."
4.0,"I pick the size based on the hip measurements which fit great, but they were a bit big in the waistband. My daughter loves the silicon because it gives toy the grip of full seat britches without the bulk. Very comfortable."
4.0,"this is a fun necklace, I like it"
4.0,Nice comfortable shirt. True to size. Quality is above average. Buttons are thin and not well sewn
4.0,It’s a little smaller than i expected but good for holding money and ID
4.0,Saw this and thought that it would be nice for an upcoming trip to Jamaica. It arrived 2 weeks earlier than expected and is made of good material. I am 5'3 and My measurements are 34 32 43 and I purchased a Large. I have a longish torso and it feel a little bit too short but overall it is a nice purchase for the money.
4.0,The bottoms are a little slippery. I thought it would have more grip. My six year old says they are comfy.
4.0,Shipping was fast and they stay on like they should. The wife loves them.
4.0,awesome nice perfect fit.
4.0,"The XL id is just a tad smaller and shorter than expected, but doesn't keep me from wearing it"
4.0,"This was so cute and very comfy. Perfect for throwing on, on a warm day with some sandals. Glad I purchased it."
4.0,These are super cute. They seem a bit heavy for my 3 year old's ears so I won't leave them in too long. But fun for her first trip to Disney Land
4.0,I like the lights & look of it. It fits a little small.
4.0,"I ordered up based on reviews and I'm really glad I did. For the price, I love it. I would say it definitely won't work for anyone who is taller. The torso was just long enough for me and I'm 5'3."
4.0,"I didn't find the fabric to be ""silky"" as advertised, but the quality was decent for the price. The shirt arrived on time. The fit was slightly bigger than I expected."
4.0,"This sweatshirt is made of 60% cotton and 40% polyester.  It’s nice-and-soft on the outside.  The inside is terrycloth, and not the usual “fuzzy”.  This sweatshirt is Made in China, so it’s a bit pricey for a single sweatshirt.  There is a tag in the neck area.  I have the side Large.  It measures 21” from the top of the shoulder to the bottom.  The arms measure 22.5” from the top of the shoulder to the end.  It measures 16.5” across at the midsection.  The design on the front is printed onto the material and is not the “rubbery” sort of material you often find."
4.0,"My 2 year old loves these to the point that he slept in them so they are true to size and comfy for him.  I think their stylish but the color was not exactly red, more of a burnt orange and the flowers are a light blue. Not a big deal they just don't match the solid red shirt I purchased separately."
4.0,Great turtleneck sweater. Very warm. Have worn it with jeans and dress pants. Many compliments.
4.0,Could be more relaxed fit
4.0,"I'm 5'7&#34; and 120 pounds, 34AA cup size. I wear a small, size 3/4, so I bought a small. It fits a little loose. The back clip for the bust strap turns so that it looks misaligned and as if it is about to come undone. The shoulder straps are also loose fitting. I have them at the tightest adjustment and they still tend to slip to the edge of my shoulders. That said, the cups are made for women with B to C cups; but they are hard formed, padded, and provide good coverage. So while there's space in the cups for me, it isn't obvious. While there are some fit problems, it is a very inexpensive suit, so for the money it's a a good buy."
4.0,Fits well my fit bit
4.0,This dress is super cute. I’m 5 ft 7in so it was short me so I just wore shorts with it. I wish the smaller was a little tighter but it was still a good dress. I had to sew in cups since you can not wear a bra with this dress.
4.0,I really liked this dress. The berry color is flattering. It's  very easy to wear and the fit is good. I would buy it again in other colors
4.0,love how it has a buck and doe on it and it hasnt tarnish yet
4.0,"Everything of what I expected, that’s great."
4.0,"Very comfy and cute. Be mindful, they ship from Asia, so it will take 3-4 weeks to receive product. If I would have been more aware while ordering, I would not have purchased. But that's me, if you are patient and don't mind a long wait, great pants!"
4.0,This is a great item and good quality.
4.0,"Heavy and high quality dress (though the zipper pull is cheesy rubber and I immediately removed it) - I am 5’4, 135lb, 36D and normally an 8 in everything but had to get a 10. The laces allow me to tighten (laces are cheap too) so if you’re worried a size up might be slightly too large you’ll probably be fine.<br /><br />The white shirt is absolute junk I don’t know why they include this with the nice dress. It was actually aggravating it see it- super scratchy cheap white tissue fabric no fabric softener could save. The cut is not great either and it kind of sticks up all over the place (too much stiff fabric) under the dress. I ordered a different shirt which is a bummer because this dress is expensive and really should come with a nice shirt."
4.0,"Like others, my skin on my arms has gotten thin and bruises easily. These do a good job of protecting and preventing bruises. I do not understand the poor reviews about fit and performance. These come in different sizes, if they don't fit then you probably ordered the wrong size! Nothing is perfect but these are a great help for those of us that need some type of protection. Do your homework, and order correctly and you will be happy."
4.0,"Nice hat, well made. Easy on/off without having to fuss with ties."
4.0,"Felt much like plastic, but the haven't tore or faded yet. The shoes get a lot of use."
4.0,"For bathing suits, I always order one size up and so happy I did.  I worry about the top not giving enough support, and this was perfect. The top fit better than expected, hangs nicely and fits comfortably.  I found the bottoms to run a little small, so that was disappointing."
4.0,Not exactly the model as the picture show. Instead of windows it had little circles with needles. Complicate to read. Same watch different front a star less.
4.0,There are lots of versions of these out there - these are a nice matte black color
4.0,"These are really nice shirts. Made from comfy materials and look good. Worth the price, and I would recommend it.<br /><br />*I was sent the wrong size at first. After some back and forth with the seller, we realized there was an error on Amazons listing where 3XL on my order showed as Medium in their system. They have since fixed it, so sizing should be correct for future orders.<br /><br />**They eventually offered me a return. But I decided to let someone else in my family use the shirt, as I didn't want to deal with returning it when they can wear it.<br /><br />Overall after the fix, and customer service, I can say you should try these shirts."
4.0,I bought this dress as a lounge dress to wear out on a lazy day or to wear around my house. It fits well and the fabric isn't constricting at all. I would purchase again!
4.0,Very cute earrings.  I’ve gotten many compliments!
4.0,I ordered a 3x and 4x and ended up keeping the 4x as the chest wasn't as tight in that one. I usually wear a size 22 but have a size F chest so I always buy based on the size of the chest lol I am 5'3 and this goes to my ankles so the perfect length for me. It is a little see through in parts when they are stretched out but the fabric is very stretchy and the dress is super comfortable. Im not sure if I like the pockets or not as they kinda stick out and could make your hips look bigger. Overall a good dress for the price.
4.0,Shirt was cute!  Thin material. But if you are larger breasted the Xlarge will not fit.
4.0,"I’m 5’2 and weigh about 190 lbs, 3mos pp. the leggings feel really, soft, nice and the length is perfect for a short person like myself. Can’t beat the price either. The only reason why I didn’t give 5 star is because on the lighter color, you can see the tag. This item is perfect otherwise!"
4.0,Cute but sized for a child's neck. I took the tag off and put it on a different choker.
4.0,It looks great on my Seiko srp777. Quality made with nice leather. The stitching and the Craftsmanship is top notch.<br />The only reason I did not give five stars is that the spring bars seemed a little short and loose so I replaced them with original seiko spring bars and now it’s perfect.
4.0,"Used it for the first time today.  First time using this style of goggles/strap combo.  Not an exessive length as I've seen some of them.  Only used them once so I can't rate durability, but they didn't slip or loosen.  Good vaule @ 2 for $10."
4.0,"My kid loved the colors,. Its comfy too"
4.0,"I love these gloves. At first I thought that the  index finger and thumb were touch sensitive. Then I discovered it was only the index finger, so due to the pictures and that's how I've been using it until I used my thumb by mistake and it kind of worked. Since I'm accustomed to typing with my thumbs. I bought these because I have other touch screen gloves but the lined fur isn't thick for me. I get cold very fast. The lined fur is thick and soft and keeps my hand warm even on those windy days.<br /><br />Update.<br />Since I bought the gloves the Grey glove's have lost their sensitivity to touch screen and don't work anymore. But the tan ones work fine."
4.0,"Quality product, will continue purchasing"
4.0,"This suit is nice, flattering, fits well (although, I didn’t need the tall, it still works) and I like the slightly higher neckline.<br />It is a one piece suit, although it has a “faux tankini” look (something I missed when ordering).<br />The “faux” tankini tends to ride up (to your waist) when swimming, which is ok since it is one piece, but the look is a bit different.<br />I gave it 4 stars because, with the “faux” top, there is a total of 4 layers of fabric on the top part, which feels kinda much."
4.0,"Handsome, well made, sturdy band.  Installing linkage difficult. Took 1/2 to 3/4 of an hour."
4.0,"Nice and soft, fits as expected."
4.0,Very cute and fits well. I can't wait for the right occasion to wear it!
4.0,"Not a soft, sexy material"
4.0,Very pretty little chokers. The clasp is very cheap though and will likely have to be replaced
4.0,Has guns on almost all but 2... so dont buy if it is for school
4.0,"It's decent quality, a bit stretchy, definitely runs small. I purchased an XL and that normally is a bit big (especially for white, a little room is necessary) but it's not a little big, fits but if I were to buy again def would go up."
4.0,"We had a hard time finding a mask that fit my husband and was comfortable, this one because it<br />came in an extra large fits him great."
4.0,"Not a bad little bag. Was looking fir something just big enough to hold my cell, sun and reading glass and maybe a couple credit cards and tissue. Fushia isxa nice color. The bigger the bag the more junk I fill it with."
4.0,Usually u wear a large but the xlarge was a little too snug
4.0,Very nice-looking watch for the money.  It comes from China.  Fits the wrist nicely with a soft leather strap.
4.0,"I bought black and red color. The quality is great, but for some reason red pants are much bigger than black ones. Black S is truly s, red S is a big M. Confusing<br />But outside of that like I said the quality is great and these are super comfortable."
4.0,Looks  great it's  a  gift  so I'LL  get back with  you  but I love it I may get one for  myself -He loves it and it 5 stars👍
4.0,Very cute. the adjustable size was perfect for a flower girl gift to match the bridal party at our wedding! Something she can wear now and still grow into and keep as an adult if it makes it that long!
4.0,I suggest you size up two sizes if you have any type of curve. I ordered a size up and will be returning to reorder TWO sizes up. Cute skirt and good material!
4.0,"Its cute, nice to throw on for the spring or fall. Material is soft. Fits good, ordered a large.<br /><br />Reference 5'7 154lbs 36D 30in waist"
4.0,"I finally came to an epiphany last summer that bootleg/bellbottom style isn’t at all bad for a shorter curvy woman like myself, particularly if it’s higher in the waist.  I love this Ginasy Women’s Boot Cut Yoga pant, although my dream version would have more of a control waist and tummy.  (I’m not about to size down because I want to keep the cut through the thigh and knee area.)  If it did have more control, I could wear this higher waisted model with croppier tops, but as it is, it works great for me with drapey blouses and tunics.<br /><br />If you’ve never or rarely touched a sewing needle, you’ll probably love the trim to fit inseam feature.  Note that the guide marks are just a suggestion.  If you have a dressmaker’s tool or just a carpenter’s square to help mark off a certain length at the seams or all around, you can do the same thing, with will be helpful if you are particularly short or find you’re perfect length to be somewhere between the manufacturers mark.  What you may really want/need though is a fabric marker in a light color so you can cleanly mark off that line and so that the line will show clearly against black, charcoal or dark blue.  ( I like the Fons & Porter 7757 Mechanical Fabric Pencil:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UAKL4Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)<br /><br />For me, I cut it a bit long and have worn it enough to trust that it won’t ravel shamelessly this way.  But now I’m going to hem it to my perfect length because I can and because it will just look neater hemmed."
4.0,"very nice, it feels heavy and weighted. nice chain it dosent look cheap. the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the image is a little light would like it to be darker but I'm ok with it it's a gift and not for me, I wouldn't mind either way. very nice highly reccomend."
4.0,They are little to long for me but fit perfectly everywhere else
4.0,"nice style, reasonable."
4.0,I like this shoes. They are very comfortable
4.0,Nice small umbrella. Nifty light. Easy to mount in footwell. Came scratched around handle. Battery already included
4.0,"The length definitely seems shorter than 1/4 inch so I may not actually be able to fit this in my helix piercing. The lizard also looks noticeable different from the picture, but overall the earring is still cute."
4.0,Had a few spikes fall off after being used a few times. But overall great product.
4.0,Size up a couple of sizes for a comfortable fit. I have a normal sized five year old and got her a 6 and it was too small. But it was cheap so I'm not too bothered by it.
4.0,"These socks are especially soft and comfortable.  They are designed well to fit your feet and provide cushion and support.  They are promoted as ""work boot"" socks, and I think they would work very well for wearing in work boots.  They would also be suited for any casual wear.  They are thicker than the current trend of moisture wicking or quick-dry athletic socks.  While these are also promoted as moisture wicking, I would not describe them that way.  They are thicker than other moisture wicking athletic socks.  They do not have ""left"" or ""right"" socks as many athletic socks do now."
4.0,"Bought for a relative to wear to a wedding in January.  Cannot comment on product more, except that we have bought from this retailer before and had no problems."
4.0,Pretty and material is the best.
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this watch.  The only reason that I didn't rate a 5 is the fact that the sizing is strange.  I had to take out a bunch of links, which wasn't that easy for me.  Other than that, I love it!"
4.0,"Girls will like the slouch shoulders and the warmth from the material. Since winter is coming, it is nice to get two different colors that young girls will like. The size is based on age, so if your child is considerably larger than the normal 8-10 year child, you may want to look for a bigger size."
4.0,Easy to use and looks way cool n durable
4.0,The colour is more grey then I expected but the size was too perfect I’m not complaining. At the same time I feel the fabric feels a touch cheep but honestly it fits so perfectly and is warm and comfy I stilll give it 4 stars. Might buy it in different colours👌🏻
4.0,Nice style and good quality. Can get a smidge too right after 6+ hours of use though.
4.0,The only bad thing about this bag is that the platform it rest on will close on it's own if left standing.
4.0,"It kind of shrink after the first wash, but still looks good."
4.0,A little tight. Good quality.
4.0,Fits snug but isn't uncomfortable!  It will actually stay on in the boat.  Looks great too!  I didn't give 5 stars because there is a strong chemical odor but it seems better after a few days.  I think a good hand wash with soap should take care of it.<br /><br />I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,Too rigid to fold
4.0,Great for the price.  It is what I expected.  It is light weight and the question mark is larger than than it appears but nice necklace.
4.0,"The necklace was super small😔😔, there's  no way it could fit around my neck."
4.0,"Really nice hoops but too big for my liking, wish they were smaller. Gave them to my daughter. If you like really big hoops you will love them, they're even prettier in person. See photos for size reference."
4.0,I like the weight of the mask
4.0,Bought as a gift that was received very well.
4.0,"Get a size up!!! This is not true to size. If you wear a large, get an x-large. Don't think you are large, just understand this sweater really isn't true to size."
4.0,"These panties are great, they are soft however they fit big, i normally wear a medium but i ordered a large and they are big but wearable. the fabric is very stretchy, a small would have fit me perfectly. I recommending buying a size down in these underwear."
4.0,Cute dress but it's a sort of orange-red.  The material snags easily.
4.0,"Es suave, es tierna y es calida. Pero llego mas pequeño de lo que esperaba, al final de cuentas es marca asiatia"
4.0,"Don’t love the Long Eyelashes label on the bag above the duck, but the bag is cute and my college age daughter uses it instead of a purse quite often and likes it. It’s cute how the feet hang off the bag. After several uses the threads on the edge of the strap are starting to fray a bit."
4.0,"This is a nice top, I would have preferred it to be be a sweater material but it works."
4.0,I have on a medium I usually wear a small i should've ordered a small but still loved the outfit.
4.0,I usually wear Large/12. I had to re-order an X-Large for bust
4.0,kid love love
4.0,Fit as expected. Arrived earlier than I thought it would.
4.0,"Great, modest, comfortable swimsuit, just tough to go potty when wearing it since it's one piece.  Flattering, forgiving, flowy, lots of positive feedback from others!"
4.0,"This is a good visor that is lightweight and fits anyone. It stretches to fit a kid or on an adult It is unisex and anybody men, women or kids can wear it. It fits the same on my son as it does on me. Its light weight and super comfy and stays put. There is no pressure on the forehead. It has practically no weight and so light that you don't feel it. Other visors make you sweating under the material and discomfort from the heat. I like the neoprene material because it is lightweight and easily wiped clean and easily packed in a travel bag. I have received this product for discounted price or free for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"These socks are downright adorable!! They really are.  However, I would consider them infant socks, not toddler.  Our granddaughter was 12 mo. when I purchased them for her and they were too small. We used about half of them, but they really needed stretched to work.  That said, I'd definitely purchase for a 6 mo. old... they are so cute how they look like shoes."
4.0,I typically wear a large in leggings in various brands but this large was uncomfortably tight. I really liked the pants and was bummed they didn’t quite fit. The material was thicker than other leggings or ponte style pants but was still very stretchy. They looked great and fit well other than being too small. I considered exchanging for an XL but have decided to return due to the zipper being broken upon arrival and not wanting to risk that happening on another pair. These pants were almost great.
4.0,"This is a very cute halter style, open shoulder, tie sleeve top. The fabric is very soft, but a little clingy. I probably would order one size bigger if I were to order it again, but it’s not terribly small. I am a very warm person, so this top will be perfect for me when it gets a little cooler outside. I have a hard time wearing long sleeves in the fall and winter because I get too hot, so this is a good in between."
4.0,"Shirt looks like the picture. Material a bit cheap, but that's okay. The print isn't perfect either. It's kind of long on me, but that's alright. Overall, it's a good t-shirt."
4.0,They do not look like high quality but they are cute.  For the price they are amazing.  Everyday type of earnings.  I gave it only 4 stars because I have bought CZ for less and they look higher quality but they are super cute.
4.0,These bands are wayyy to long for my little wrist. Not even in the smallest hole would it fit.  I need a shorter band. It slides down my wrist
4.0,Live the pattern
4.0,"We have two of these for our two youngest kids, ages 4 and 8. They both tell me the headphones ""sqeeze"" their heads. My kids have petite heads. BUT they work! I would not recommend them for older kids (too small for my 11 year old)."
4.0,I've worn it twice both tines great
4.0,"Color and fit was what I expected. I'm a little tall and the length was what I wanted. Sleeves are also long enough to cover my wrists.<br />Soft material inside.<br />However, after 2nd wearing there is already pilling near the armpits. I have a fabric shaver, but it's kind of disappointing to have to use it so soon."
4.0,"These glasses are nice and stylish, and flattering to the face. They are reasonably sturdy and well made. My only comment is that the reading part of the lens comes up quite high, so there is about a 50/50 split between the reading portion and the plano. This is fine when you are reading, but it's not as easy to walk around in. So if you want something versatile, ie a pair of sunglasses to run around in and occasionally read something small, these may not be for you."
4.0,"I bought these for a womans wallet its a little wider than expected but will do fine ,cards fit perfect but when zippering , the plastic insert all most catches in zipper. Thinking maybe I bought the wrong one and its for a mans wallet"
4.0,"The masks seal quite well, but they run small, and with the chin cupping, can move when you speak. A large face or jaw would have trouble fitting. The copper must help with any germs/viruses, they don't have to be washed very often. Comfortable interior."
4.0,great gift for someone
4.0,Beautiful but does not hold the glasses. Kept slipping out. I bought the V eeer fra Bradly also and had some problem.  So disappointed.
4.0,"I got one size larger than what I normally wear, and am very happy with it.  a very dressy look for a reasonable price."
4.0,"***As a Follow-Up one year later (October 18, 2019) - Still love these socks, but they lasted only the season. Though I was careful with them (washed them separately, hung to dry, didn't walk around in my stocking feet), they are wearing in the heels and starting to pill. I found they were a good value for the price, but, of course the price has gone up this year. I will be trying another brand this year to compare. . . . Also, LOVED the striped option, but they are not available this year.<br /><br />These socks are good quality and the same weight as a cotton anklet (a bit thicker than hose but they fit in a shoe the same way -- no need to size up your shoes for winter in order to fit a wool sock). I could definitely tell they would be much warmer, though, as soon as I put them on."
4.0,El material no es el mejor pero por el precio y como me queda bien al cuerpo a mi me encanta!
4.0,very nice earrings and great size.  i was looking for a small stud plumeria earring and this was perfect.
4.0,Nice material since I can only wear cotton.  Good style and pattern.  Fit well though I have to order one size bigger.
4.0,"Lovely scarf! My only complaint is that it's a bit smaller and thinner than I expected. Other than that, this is exactly what I expected."
4.0,Material was cheap but fit ok and all around cute suit for the price
4.0,Very nice but I thought the Front nd back V necklines could have been cut lower.
4.0,Really like the top of this 2 piece. Bottoms are meh due to the cut. Definitely could be more flattering.
4.0,Love this dress but it almost looks home made and the pockets puff out on my hips.
4.0,"This shirt is super cute, flattering, just has a weird situation or extra fabric in the armpit sleeve area. Very light weight"
4.0,My wife uses it as a night shirt and is very pleased.
4.0,I like these watch bands because you can tighten or loosen it while it’s on your arm. I also like the color variety that they had offered.
4.0,"These socks really do help keep your feet nice and warm. Not sure how they do it.  The reason they get 4 and not 5 stars is they are somewhat significantly smaller than expected  There is not much difference b/w the small and the large size, actually.  The large socks fit, but I have small feet (size 8/5 US Mens).  So I was expecting to have to wear the small, but couldn't.  The large are not really &#34;large&#34;.  But again... they work good as socks you wear under socks.  They are very thin, so they work well as the inner pair of socks.  I would not wear these socks alone on a cold day.  Just too thin.  That said... it is weird how they really work."
4.0,Kind of short but served its one time purpose as part of a costume.
4.0,"Great dress, VERY thin, I had to wear a slip underneath"
4.0,It was a gift for my sister's son's daughter and I believe she was very happy with it.  I was a little disappointed by the fabric choice.
4.0,"I ordered this form my niece - she loved it, it was an early present but I just couldn't hold on to it. She wasn't sure of the meaning of the ""evil eye"" so the great aunt that I am- I told her it woudl ward off all the mean girls at school. She laughed.."
4.0,"Looks great, unfortunately I got the wrnog size costume so it could not be used for the party I required it for. Wig looks good though. I will use it for other costume parties I go to"
4.0,It was just a little snug at the waist. Had I gone up the top would have been too big<br />Overall I’m pleased
4.0,"Stretched too much now loose fitting,"
4.0,Love the color! Love the material! Love the fit! Nice casual church dress!
4.0,"Cute sandals. Not quality materials, but expected due to low pricing. I'd buy them again. :)"
4.0,Bought as a gift for soon to be mother. Simple and plain  bodysuits. Soft and comfortable looking.
4.0,Very good choice for the money.
4.0,Tried it on and it feels amazing it will need hemmed and went to adjust the dress in the belly area and the tie fell off it was not sewed on well but over all this dress is gorgeous.
4.0,"5'5"", 135lbs, ordered a small. So, I'm really quite confused. When I first opened the package and felt the dress I was shocked as the material felt so weird. It took me 2 days to actually try it on. I finally tried it on thinking my body was going to reject the material but was once again shocked that it didn't feel weird once wearing it. For this I'm confused. I'm keeping the dress, hoping that 1-2 washings might make the material feel less weird in my hands but regardless I like it overall. It does fit a little loose in the waist for my liking but I think it's made as advertised and this is just a personal preference for me. Also worth noting. The color was spot on with the color I ordered."
4.0,"Definitely a good quality product, but when I try to zip the second zipper, it is a bit too snug. Granted I am a big man and hopefully if I loose just a few pounds, it will fit well."
4.0,This is a really beautiful bracelet and looks exactly like the pictures. If you’re someone who loves sacred geometry and your spiritual this is a really great piece. The only thing that I don’t like about it is that they only have two sizing options on the bracelet. They really could do much more if they want a better fit. If you know you have either very large rests or very small than this won’t work for you.
4.0,"The dress is very pretty and will work for what I ordered it for with a little bit of tailoring work. The dress is held closed with a couple little squares of velcro. Will probably add something a little bit stronger and trustworthy. Also, the hole in the back is WAY too large. We will tailor that as well and bring it in. For the price I paid, I am happy with this dress."
4.0,"These are cute, but my girl's feet must be too narrow as they are constantly falling off of her feet.  The material at the heel is not rigid so the back breaks down pretty fast since the feet slide in and out with each step.  But, like I said, my daughter's feet are narrow. The rest of the shoe has been pretty durable and she loves them."
4.0,Everyone compliments me when I wear it
4.0,Seems pretty durable. I never have it open in the wind though. The tilt feature is nice! We often sit outside for dinner so its nice to block the evening sun.
4.0,"The shoes are comfortable, but I need to get more comfortable being this high off the ground.  Feel a bit unstable on thick carpet...but I think I just need to wear them more to get comfortable."
4.0,Cute but a little small. I bought the size according to the chart and it doesn't hang well. A little snug
4.0,"I will need to adjust the elastic on the underarm area, and there is no solution for the neck which is big enough for a barbie. I feel like I am strangling wqhen I wear it, but it looks pretty good, and that's important. Right? for about 5c more, they could make this fit a normal person. Just saying."
4.0,"Nice piece.  Prettier in person and makes for a comfortable wear ...especially in Summer where all the necklines are lower and the pendant acts as the show piece.  For cat lover's, it's definitely one to add to their jewelry collection."
4.0,Fast shipping. Love the product but they're super big on my 3 month old. They fall right off. Nothing else wrong.
4.0,Great costume.  Straps will fall unless sewn or attached some other way
4.0,super cute and lightweight.
4.0,"Only confusion was that it is marked as earrings (plural) but only comes with 1 which doesn’t bother me because only 1 of  my ears is pierced but otherwise love it, one secured it stays in place really well, even while sleeping,"
4.0,The diamond cutting on these earrings is well done.  Can't wait to see if my granddaughter likes them as much as I do.
4.0,"I like the shoe, though I wish wide widths were available in all colors. I wanted the black with the black sole. These are comfortable for walking in. I plan to use these while using the treadmill/elliptical."
4.0,Muy buen precio
4.0,Very cute only issue is that I guess they are for taller women. I'm 5'1 so the waist band is up to my bra line.
4.0,"Not what I expected but they are really pretty. Tiny, very shiny & cute. Would recommend I mean less than 3 bucks you really can't argue that 😉"
4.0,"This is a very nice robe. It is, however, NOT flannel. It’s woven cotton, and not brushed or fuzzy. It is high quality and soft (especially after washing), but I wanted flannel so I subtracted a star. It’s long, and fits great. I’m 5’2” and wear a size 12 pants...got the medium/large size."
4.0,"Rubs my calves raw. Upper is very stuff, I hope it loosens up. Looks good though."
4.0,You can see every little imperfection when the wind blows.
4.0,love it! great sun protection and stylish as well! took a while to get it though.
4.0,"Came packaged cleanly. Unfortunately, they're not for someone 6' 2"" plus. They're too short, for me. Nicely fitted for athletic to thin build. 4 stars to be fair, because they may fit you much better."
4.0,Looks exactly as shown. A little bit small for a man's normal size head.  Maybe stretching will help.
4.0,"Very cute scarf, great quality, and beautiful color. My only issue is Im not sure how it looks like ruffles, more like a really large used scrunchie. But still very chic! Love it, goes with everything of mine."
4.0,Wanted yellow background from yellow garage. Otherwise I loved the shirt.
4.0,looks kind of cheap but I like it so I will be keeping it
4.0,"At first I was disappointed, and almost returned these because I thought they came with an integrated “ball pouch”.. they don’t, just a contour up front.. but decided to keep them and they have worked well as everyday boxer briefs, the cotton mix is just right.. quality is better than I expected"
4.0,Good quality leggings. Washed well. My daughter wears a 8. I got the 10 and they fit perfect. Very cute. So maybe just get a size bigger for length
4.0,"I love these pants! Beautiful and flowy and an absolute blast! They were a bit small around the waist which is bothersome as I hate binding clothes. I got the largest size. Would've preferred 1 size higher but didn't have that option. Otherwise, very cool pants and I get lots of compliments on them"
4.0,Love this hat. It looks good and feels great. Time will tell if it is worth the price. I have purchased hats from New York to the west coast and even Italy. A good hat is a great fashion piece to have. So I recognize value. American Hat Makers have nice line of hats.
4.0,"I ordered these in Rose Gold and 24 Gold to replace the lenses in my Gloss Copper Kahuna frames. (24 Gold was a closer match in MJ's HCL Bronze color)  Normally I just send them 2-3 at a time to Maui Jim to replace and straighten the frames. I decided to try these this time around.  The lenses were easy to replace. They are fine, not great. The weight of these are about 1/3 the weight of the official MJ lenses and don't filter out as much light. (MJ are darker than these)<br />I can live with that. In the future, I'll probably go the official route but these aren't too bad if you're on a budget."
4.0,A Lot more of little Keys then big ones. We loved them!
4.0,"The packaging was great* The glasses came shrink-wrapped in a black box. Then there's a nice case that you side the glasses from on end/side and the end flaps over. The glasses themselves are in a zip lock bag. Also comes with a eyeglass tool, cloth, and a card to see the polarization. All in all, nice set for the price!<br /><br />They look great as well! One lense was popped out and a little more challenging to pop back in."
4.0,Stretchy enough to cover my big butt without being sheer.  I'm 5' 8&#34; and 175 lbs.  I bought XL but I can fit into Target's L.  I wish sizing was consistent for all clothes.
4.0,Had to trim the top to fit in my shoe it was a tad to Pointy!
4.0,"Cute dress. Accurate color. I'm a size 24 with 49"" chest. I didn't realize the 50"" chest chart size was the dress measurement. It is tighter than I thought it would be.  Will probably buy the bigger size and return this one."
4.0,"Somewhat small, and quite see-through...make sure you're wearing your bra! Haha."
4.0,Would have rated at 5 starts but no caps were included as per the picture advertised.  Now I’ll be shopping for caps 😕
4.0,These pants were cute but they run about 2 sizes small
4.0,My husband decided to keep them because they are comfortable house slippers.
4.0,"These earrings are really lovely, I wear them all the time! Very nice quality and they go with almost everything."
4.0,"These were not quite what I wanted, thicker than I expected and I am not sure I can use them.  If not, I will gift them.  They are colorful."
4.0,"These are cute, but a little larger than I expected.  Nothing wrong with them, just a little large.  My daughter still wears them, however."
4.0,is good product but a bit larger than expected and most importantly had to use scissors to cut excess plastic and trim molding residues of the manufacturing its not well finished.
4.0,I wear a size 16 and the xl did not fit.  Returned them with no problem and got the xxl.
4.0,"So festive and cute, just wish it was better quality. One of the bells did fall off /:"
4.0,"Perfect size hoop. Even cuter than the pic. The back fell apart after 5 min of wearing, but the earring itself is ADORABLE. Just buy your own backs"
4.0,Love It!! Got so many Compliments on It!
4.0,"I ordered one of these back in November 2009 and have been using it on cold mornings since then.  Initially the fit was really tight, but it seems to have stretched a little bit and is now more comfortable (or I'm just used to it!).  It probably needs to be pretty skull-tight so one can wear one's bicycle helmet over it without slipping, and I've had no problems in that regard.  I don't remember if I loosened my helmet straps at all, but when I now put on the helmet without the Serfas, it feels slightly loose, so when the weather gets warmer I'll just tighten the straps a little (no big deal).<br /><br />Using this head cover along with a neck roll pulled up over my nose (a scarf would work for covering the nose too) has allowed me to ride my bicycle to work in 42 degree F morning temperatures here in the Phoenix area, and I've been warm enough that even if the temperatures were a bit lower it probably wouldn't bother me.  The only improvement I'd suggest is to make it a bit more breathable, since it can occasionally get a little sweaty inside (though it's really not bad at all)."
4.0,"Love sunglasses that are different, but yet ya don't have to sell your kidney to get a pair---- price was right,especially if u like to own many 👓 S... was pleasantly surprised. Arrived lovingly packaged in lil black bags, well made,but lite on face. Didn't get 😜 colors. U can if u like. The first day I wore the silver grey pair,2 women out shopping 🛒 asked me about them..... happy happy 🐥 here!"
4.0,Got many compliments on this cute dress. The only drawback is in some spots the sequins itches really bad!
4.0,The leggings are cute but run small.
4.0,"Needed some dress socks for work that wouldn't constantly slide down my ankles, but also wouldn't cut off circulation to my third leg. I took a chance on these and they came and worked like a charm. Nothing fancy, just soft comfy dress socks that even with my razor sharp uncut toe nails seem to defy getting holes in them.  Wearing a pair right now at my desk. just don't tell my boss i wrote this at work."
4.0,Decent mask. The eyes are ugly/scary unless you add some sunglasses. My look turned out great.
4.0,I used the measurement info provided but the gloves were still too tight.  Ordered another  pair a size larger.
4.0,A little small but if they made them a little bigger by about a size or so they would really be worth it.  Comfortable otherwise.
4.0,"Nice colors, nice fabric, but the arms-eye on these shirts is too snug for my slender daughter's comfort."
4.0,"I like this band with its blue accent and various components (i.e. flat thicker middle band with round side bands).  The only issue I've had is that the fastener slides loose and needs to be tightened several times throughout the day.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase."
4.0,"The weird pipe cleaner bits attached to it were not what I expected. I took those off. It is ivory, not the white it appears in images, but was fine."
4.0,Runs small order larger size
4.0,Only reason for 4 stars is the smell once the container was opened. We used them for goody bags for my daughter's birthday.
4.0,pretty nice dress very light and fits well
4.0,This is a good package of underwear because you get so many.  The underwear are comfortable and I like that they are stretchy so they don't bind anywhere.  They fit well and are true to size. They don't have a fly and I prefer that they did but overall they are very good underwear.
4.0,These socks run a little small. I wear a US woman's size 8 shoe and they are very snug. I still wear them but I'm not sure how long they will last. They are pretty thin. Decent quality for the price.
4.0,"Cant wait for this Halloween, we will be putting a fogger and some lights in it for a hopefully spooky effect."
4.0,"The shirts is very nice, but runs extremely small. I ordered a large and it is too tight."
4.0,I absolutely love these but in certain lighting they have a slight yellow look in the lens otherwise they are perfect!
4.0,"I really love this bag, it's great and has way more pockets for cards than my last wallet. The only problem is there isn't really anywhere for me to put change. There are little holes in each side that would let coins(and other small things) slip out."
4.0,The socks are very comfortable but they do run a little small for guys that have bigger feet. I wear a size 12-13 and the socks are a little smaller than I expected but they are still very comfortable and I would recommend them to anyone. I would just say if your size is at the higher end of the range go with the next size up.
4.0,The material is so light and airy. Sizing is relaxed and loose for max comfort. I sized down and love the length
4.0,Very small - size guide is way off. Ordered an XL (I'm a 12/14) and it is small.  lightweight which is perfect for summer but wish it were made of cotton. But still a super cute skirt.
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34;, 150lbs. I bought a size 10. They fit great everywhere except they are a little long and get a bit looser throughout the day. The length is fine boots. Also, the waist band starts to scrunch up and flip down after only a couple of wears. Not sure I would buy again."
4.0,"Mostly use it for everyday use which is fine, but you cant do any exercise or fast movements with it. it came off couple times while playing soccer."
4.0,"Not hot pink but more rose pink color. Size large enough to be comfortable but not too heavy. Would have given five stars if BOTH sides of strap were leather, rather than one side of cloth. Also, similar bag on Amazon wouldn't have arrived from China until mid-April."
4.0,I love the shirt. It’s very pretty. Just runs a little small.
4.0,"Not as thin as my previous chain which broke, but thinner than I thought it would be.  I am hard on my chains.  I hang pens off my chains. I had a thicker box chain before my dog broke it.  I need a chain thin enough to fit through the bails of my pendant, but thick enough to stand up to my pens.  Box chains tend to generally be very sturdy chains.  I don't think this chain is thick enough to stand up to pens being hung on it.  I ahve already broke a 1 mm box chain like this.  It's a nice sturdy chain, but not up to hanging pens on it.You can't beat the price though.  If you are going to use it normally you should have no problem."
4.0,Nice heavy material.  Looks like advertised
4.0,"I like my tops to be oversized, so I bought a lg. It fits me like the it does on the model. I am 5'5 and weigh 114lb."
4.0,"I really like these pins! They look nice and are a great size. They even came with extra rubber backs just in case you lose any! Just received my pins today so I’m not sure how they hold up over time, but I really do like them and they seem to be good quality!"
4.0,"It is a great skirt. I wore it for a '50s style Halloween costume, so the style was perfect. I plan to have it hemmed before I wear it as a day-to-day skirt. I'm 5'3&#34; and 120-125lbs. I ordered a large. The skirt sits at the top of my hips and hits below my knee. If I had ordered a medium, it probably would fit more appropriately without tailoring."
4.0,They are ok sports bras
4.0,Flattering is not frequently used to describe sweatpants. But it accurately describes these. A cotton blend they are trimly cut in a way that enhances the figure. They are lined but not with fleece but a smooth cotton type material. The drawstring waist is elastic and it has usable side pockets. They are a smidge short and small. If you are taller or curvier go up a size. They are comfortable and well made.
4.0,"Pick a color that will stand out, I got green and already on my last trip I could see the tag on the conveyor before it even got near me!"
4.0,I bought an anti-packers one for my boyfriend and an anti-vikings one for myself. I also received a book about samurais in my package so.... there's that.
4.0,Nice bag. Be aware of the size.
4.0,"The hat fits well and is super warm but the pom pom came off after like 3 wears and had to be resewn, which was annoying."
4.0,Very nice pattern the material is on the ligjter weight side but overall a nice beanie
4.0,"Same as ever, good quality and delivered perfectly,  but unlike my kids I needn't any stickers on it."
4.0,"I must admit I was pretty surprised that you can actually use your phone with these gloves on! These lambskin gloves come in a beautiful box ready for gift giving. They are very fashionable and love the fact that you don't have to take them off to use your smartphone as the new smart touch technology allows for you to stay warm and be able to text and do whatever you need on your phone. In the past, I have had gloves that I was able to keep on when using my phone but they had ugly white tips, these are beautiful and functional. The lining is soft and warm and the gloves are overall very comfortable. I got them in brown and it is a beautiful rich chocolate brown color. The only issue I had was the finger length of the gloves were a little long on me, but I am not a big person. Great quality gloves overall, would make a wonderful gift. I received these gloves at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review regarding my experience with this product. (I will add pictures to my review shortly! )"
4.0,"Quality of the socks is good and fits well, very comfortable"
4.0,These are really pretty and I like how the gems are set in just right.
4.0,"I like this cardigan, It is how the picture is, only mine is black. At first I did not like the hoodie for I thought it was too small, and it is but it wasn't so bad.I do recommend that this cardigan hoodie is a small size, but it will fit perfectly for those who are usually medium like me so it works both ways."
4.0,"low quality , for the price is good"
4.0,"Love the necklace, and it looks like the picture."
4.0,"Absolutely love these, they fit so well. However, the patterned pair of shorts in my two pack can damaged with the seam ripping away completely. I can’t figure out how to contact the seller or to replace just this pair, as the black pair came perfect."
4.0,It fit as expected.
4.0,It was perfect! Well made!
4.0,Cute dress with good definition under the breast area.
4.0,Very nice work.
4.0,"GREAT festive scarf - especially for the price. My stepdaughters thought that it was very fashionable! It's lightweight, which works great with our very hot and humid 4ths in the mid-Atlantic. My only complaint is that because of the weave, it does tend to catch a bit on rings or earrings. And definitely be careful around sparklers! I'll be using this for many Independence Days to come."
4.0,these do what they're supposed to do altough I have had a few of the earrings break
4.0,"These earrings are super cute, but feel a bit weird on. The backs are much bigger than I thought they would be and really stick out. The flowers are a hard plastic and the post goes into the clear plastic globe. I felt like they were going to fall off because of them being so big. Maybe I just need to get use to them.  These are shipped from China and take 3-4 weeks to get.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Fashion-Earrings-Spherical-Transparent-Flowers/dp/B01DNQBGZA?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0<br />I received this product at a discount for an honest review. I am in no way affiliated with Amazon or the seller. I only review products after I have received them and tried them. If this review helps you please check yes at the bottom."
4.0,"This was a gift so I didn't see it myself, but my grandson said he loved having a place for his water bottle.  He plays flag football at his school and is in 4th grade.  Seems to be the perfect size for these needs."
4.0,"Small, but nice...only thing is bear kinda look like a giant rat. But good!"
4.0,"These are advertised as workout shorts. And they work great for that, as long as you are at home or no one else is around. There is zero support so you need to wear something underneath.<br />They do fit well. In fact, they fit just about perfectly. They're really comfortable and I'd say a medium weight. They're a little on the thick side to be running shorts.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the metal zippers. I would have preferred fine tooth plastic zipper. The metal zipper doesn't operate smoothly. It catches a bit. A fine tooth plastic zipper might have a little more resistance, but it would still operate more smoothly.<br />Overall, a decent pair of exercise shorts that could use some minor improvements."
4.0,"For the price, I love it!"
4.0,"These worked perfectly to replace a broken buckle on my fishing sling bag. Easy to slide into place, secure, and worth the purchase price."
4.0,"Got this turquoise cross for a gift to my mother, and it was exactly as they said it looked ! It was worth the price and it arrived in about two weeks."
4.0,"I wanted to love this, but it was too large and bulky in the arms for my 7yo. The embroidery/logo is beautiful, so if it had fit, it would have been a favorite. The material is very thick, which is great. But unfortunately that also meant that it did not slouch in the arms enough to make it fit properly.  Had to return it."
4.0,This is really cute on. I wore it to a family get together and got lots of compliments. The only issue I had was that it was very short-waisted...the waist/top of pockets fell very high which was strange because I’m neither tall nor long-waisted. I therefore couldn’t wear the cute tied belt that came with it. I just wore a wide belt though which covered it fine and looked great.
4.0,"The UV protection is great, comparable to the much more expensive Maui Jim line of sunglasses. But the feeling of the frames are heavier and feel a bit klunky. But for the price, I'd say they are a real bargain. And the fit around my face is great. I'm a big guy, and these glasses frame my face very well."
4.0,Satin Lined Sleep Cap stays on your head during your sleep.  This product is affordably priced.
4.0,"This top is beautiful, but it fits smaller than expected."
4.0,"Did not fit completely under the seat on my American flight, yet I was not made to put it in the overhead bin.  I am not sure that on a more crowded flight or in a basic fare seat that I would be allowed to keep it on the floor.  Just the right size for my necessary items to keep with me.  Wheels work fine."
4.0,"Love the rings. I purchased them so I can continue to have a ring on in place of my wedding rings while losing weight. I had purchased some of a different brand before and they made my skin peel and itch under them. So far after wearing these, I hardly have noticed them. They aren't snug, but they aren't to lose either! And I can change the colors of them with there being so many. I did give my daughter the white colored ones because I have vitaligo, and they blend...lol. My favorites right now, are the purple and black braided bands worn together!  Only reason I'm not doing 5 stars, the gold braided band has a very visible line where the silicone didn't match up correctly down the middle of the band. But otherwise, no issues so far."
4.0,It's more of a headband than ear muffs like I wanted but it is warm and stretches after wearing it once so now it fits perfectly and goes on easily.
4.0,These work amazing.  They stay on my head.
4.0,Use size chart.fabric is thick enough to be comfortable.
4.0,"This jumpsuit is adorable!  I got the blue and I love the pattern.  I'm 5'3"" and 145 lbs and bought the medium.  It fits like a glove.  I'm 34dd and if I was any bigger the medium would not have worked.  The top would have been too small.  If you're more than 145 lbs I would suggest going with the large."
4.0,"One of my biceps is about 13"" and the other 12.5"" and I got the size large and they fit perfectly. Just took them out on a ride and they were very warm. Not as wind resistant as I was hoping, but they did just fine. Good product for the price! My only issue with them is the elastic they used, instead of a line of silicone like most cycling elastic bands, it is several wavy lines of rubber which makes them less comfortable than other cycling gear with grippy elastic. But I will use them and it's more of an annoyance than a hindrance. I would recommend them."
4.0,"Looks nice, has some Chinese writing on the back that isn't on the usual chucks, but overall nice shoes."
4.0,"Sizing is way off BUT it&#34;s lovely. It is NOT chiffon but rather a polyblend that's not great quality. Still, it is a great valua, and should make the wearer feel beautiful."
4.0,It's a beautiful bracelet but it runs quite small for it to be for a man. The combination of steel and leather is so elegant.
4.0,"these glasses are made well, do not let water enter the eye. The only comment I can make is the color of the glass: it is too dark to swim in an indoor pool where the light is not intense"
4.0,The color is nice and vibrant but does not go all the way thru.
4.0,Husband loves them!  Colors are so vibrant and cool. Packaging was very nice. Great quality. Would purchase again.
4.0,"Very well made. Comfortable, soft, just really large."
4.0,They are a little too big and I ordered my correct size but I still love them.
4.0,"The tips of my glasses are metal and with the heat and sweat the metal was bothering me, with these now on my glasses it feels fine now"
4.0,"As others have mentioned in reviews, they are form fitting. I ordered XL and they are snug - but not uncomfortable. Material is a tech-type, and thus is not soft like a cotton undershirt. They seem to be a good a-shirt, although after wearing these I now know I prefer a cotton undershirt and so will likely not order more of these. But just my preference. If I preferred the tech material feel I would order more of these."
4.0,Love the look of it and fits my iPhone 5s!
4.0,Great gift or be selfish.
4.0,Fits well and is cute. Covers my back fat rolls haha
4.0,I love how the upper fits custom to your foot because it's thin and stretchy! Super comfortable shoe. Wish it were a bit less expensive though.
4.0,"Very pretty.  Nice size, too."
4.0,"A mi hijo le quedó bien,lo usa para la nieve"
4.0,Very very thin dress. No lining and the material is very thin and delicate.
4.0,soft and flows nicely.
4.0,I couldn't find what I was looking for...a duster with short sleeves and zipped with side pockets.  This was the closest. I fits a bit large but appears well made.  I haven't washed it yet which usually is the test.
4.0,love the fit and the size is perfect but they are see through. As long as you wear a longer shirt to cover your butt its fine.
4.0,The back doesn't fall in place it's too large.
4.0,Shipped fast. Stretchy material. Fits fairly well (Im a size medium in womens) but its a bit short on the length. Overall good shirt.
4.0,Heavy but A Beautiful Sexy Piece....
4.0,Great fit. A little see through depending on the bra underneath. Stretchy and form fitting without being too tight. I usually wear a L or XL and I purchased the XL in white
4.0,Nice fit around.  The elastic doesn't dig in and the straps stay in place.  The overall fit is great. It is comfortable to work out in.
4.0,"I can put down my other spying 🕵🏽‍♀️ ⌚️watch now. ⌚️simplicity is the way to go now. As long as it can give me the time and it goes with my outfit.<br /><br /> 🤍 Love the silver, clear and white on this watch. Easy to set also. So far it’s accurate… unlike the cheap one I bought on Shein.<br /><br />((Update)) The band is little rigid, and keeps on shifting on my wrist. 🤷🏽‍♀️"
4.0,"I'm a size 18-20and bought an XXL. This is a little snug in the stomach-hips  on me, but I'm a little heavy in that area. It's very pretty and comfortable and slenderizing.  I'm short and it hits me mid knee.  The stamped border print is just in the front, not the back. I haven't washed it yet, so don't know how it launders."
4.0,Super cute but the charm is attached incorrectly. It should be attached by an o-ring because it turns around the the undecorated side of the charm half the time. I've got some jewelry repair parts so I'll fix mine because it's really cute otherwise.
4.0,Top & bottom perfect sizes. The eye cover is useless.
4.0,I loved this bag. but it was way smaller than I thought it would be and sadly had to return it.
4.0,"I got these sunglasses for myself, but after trying them on, and my daughter trying them on, we tried them on my husband who they looked much better on. They are  larger style sunglasses that I think look better on a man's face.<br />They are well made and come in a nice sunglass case. The front is a mirror look and they give the wearer a very clear view."
4.0,My 2 year old loves the pajamas. The arms are a bit tight but overall a good fit.
4.0,"Gorgeous dress! Beautifully made - attention to detail and nice fabric. I really wanted to love this dress, but it runs very small. I ordered according to the size chart. I am 5'7&#34;, 125#, 34A. I ordered a size 6, but I could barely zip up the dress  and I definitely couldn't breathe. The area around the rib cage is so tight and there is absolutely no stretch to the fabric. If I were to order a size up, the neckline would be too wide and gape and the skirt would be too wide. This is a heavier fabric and if the skirt is too wide, it will not lay nicely. Maybe I'm just the wrong shape for this dress but I love the Jackie O. look."
4.0,Very cute hats for the money.
4.0,"They are okay. Not my favorite leggings. They fit my legs, but are large around the waist. I went by their sizing chart. And they only pass the toe touch test if you have on black underwear. Not the most seethrough leggings I’ve seen, but you can still see through them when you bend over. I got an XL for reference and I wear a size 10-12 pants."
4.0,A little hard to Breathe through it but fits well.
4.0,Nice looking watch but bad service: with a dead cell and a wrong pamphlet nothing to do with this product.
4.0,"This is a sturdy, heavier cotton very traditional German dirndl with embroidery and a front zipper. I am a 12 (36d) 5’5” tall and ordered a 14 based on the size chart. It is a snug fit for me. I do like the color and cut of this dirndl and the longer length. It came with a white blouse and apron. I think a pink apron would have been nicer with this dirndl. Overall I’m pleased with my purchase."
4.0,starting to crack in the middle of the brace which is perplexing
4.0,"These are very cool looking sunglasses.  They remind me of ones that I saw in an optical shop by a fancy designer (can't remember?), but at probably a 10th of the cost.  They feel nice and sturdy, too. They aren't titanium light, but that may be the trade-off for the cost."
4.0,Exerlent thank you
4.0,These dresses run small.  Order a size larger.
4.0,Super cute. Has a thick waist line. Pattern is good color and looks as it does in photo.
4.0,"I love the product its worth the buy. The size is perfect and the color is true to what you can see in the picture. It's has a lot of amount of storage. I like how the bag has textured on the front making it looks more classy and expensive. It's perfect for any occasions, you can just detached the shoulder strap to wear it as a handbag or either way you want.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchanged for my unbiased review."
4.0,I bought these to use while grocery shopping during the pandemic. They do the job. My only complaint is the wrist is super small which makes it hard to put on. The fingers by comparison are very long. Touch screen only works some of the time.
4.0,It's cute! But the fit was on the smaller side and the material is rather thin. The decal has held up very well in the wash though.
4.0,"This dress is flattering and fits like a dream, but I am 5’5 and it is way too long. I’ve nearly tripped several times. It drags the floor. Now I wear it around the house (very carefully!) because it is so comfortable and pretty! I love it."
4.0,"Beautiful mix of stone gauges. I would have given it 5 stars but the flares on the ends are pretty small, so I do struggle with them falling out."
4.0,"Flattering dress, just was somewhat smaller than expected in the torso.  Good length and love the design."
4.0,It fit very nicely just thought it would be a heavier material and longer but was fine none the less
4.0,"Love this top, I think I could have gone down a size at least."
4.0,Love it. Very soft inside and outside. Large fit well and loose enough and I am generally a size 6-8. Would order another in a different color.
4.0,Fits great. Super deep pockets. Prolonged wear makes it stretch out a little bit but nothing too bad.
4.0,Sturdy. It's not plastic so won't break. Worth the money if you need to resize your watch and if it is difficult to take the pins off
4.0,"This dress is adorable, however it runs a little large. Its more billowy then what i was hoping for, so I'm planning on taking it in a bit."
4.0,"Great for exercising. I run in these glasses because they don't move and are clear to see through in changing light conditions. If you are a cyclist like I am as well this will really pay dividends because they are great on the bike providing clear vision , eye protection and don't move even at high speeds or on bumps."
4.0,Looks and feels great. I am 5’5” and 145. Is a little big under the arm. After trying it in I went to order more but the price trippled. Will be watching for a sale again.
4.0,"Great quality, fits well (not to tight not too loose) But not long enough for me. Tall skinny dude"
4.0,"I got this dress for a wedding I was attending. The dress is super cute but in my opinion, I think it would look better on a slimmer body."
4.0,"Love the material and design of this top, unfortunately it is a little too snug for me to wear comfortably and I sized up just incase. The material likes to cling to my little baby bump belly, lol."
4.0,Great swimsuit. I'm 5'9 and wear a size 12/13 with bigger boobs and bigger hips. I ordered a 4X and it fit great so definitely go bigger rather than smaller.
4.0,I wish it had pockets. The wrapping fit as expected however the top around the chest opens a little wider than I thought.
4.0,"I love it.  It is really cute.  However, if you have a longer torso it is just a bit snug.  Overall, I really like it."
4.0,smaller than picture very dainty but still nice
4.0,"two short for me. It either ok at chest area (covers bra) and two high at crotch. Or ok at crotch, but too low at bra level. It probably will be ok over swim suit. I have long legs and torso slim and average, not long, but someone shorted with bigger butt / waist  should be ok.  It doesn't stretch and looks dressy. I am 5'7, 145 lbs and got Large"
4.0,Very soft material very flowy and nice the only downside is it is completely see through and with the open back you can't exactly wear a tank top or cami under it.
4.0,"I wear a size 7 (37.5&#34; hips) and I have a 29&#34; inseam, and these leggings fit great. I love the shiny green mermaid scales and the fabric is very stretchy. My daughters are so jealous of these, I'll have to find some in their size now 😄.  I found it a little odd, but the front and back of these leggings are the same, so the back is very low-rise, and slides down quite a bit. If these were made more high rise (like the picture), that could easily solve the problem.<br /><br />I received these at no cost during a promotional period in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Very pretty and handy.
4.0,Was a gift for Garfield lover she's very happy
4.0,small but pretty scarf
4.0,Love this bathing suit top. It’s very flattering and cute. Fits well. Not sure how it will hold up washing yet but I intend to hand wash due to the ties in the back. They seem a bit flimsy and may not do well. All in all a cute top at a good price
4.0,The sleeves are too tight....The manufactures should rethink the size of the sleeves. I am thinking of returning what could otherwise be a fabulous shirt.
4.0,"I normally wear small, I ordered a Large wanting an oversized fit. This large fit me more like a Med. also its shorter length than what I would expect a large to be and I'm 5 ft tall so that says alot. I did love the color and the feel of the fabric, softer than regular T shirts so not mad about that, i will still be wearing this since it is cute, print quality is o.k.<br />Second shirt (black shirt) I ordered this in XL hoping for a bigger fit but it didn't really do much of a difference compared to the Large purple shirt I ordered before. Fits me as a Medium shirt would. Print quality is nice, shirt is soft material not just cotton-like."
4.0,Makes a huge difference in sleep quality. Only downside is that they slide down the nose. We fixed it with the pads made for regular eyeglasses. I highly recommend these for effectively blocking blue light.
4.0,Its a little bit smaller than i imagine
4.0,My husband says the fit is nice and the material is soft and comfortable. My only grievance is the silver on the white shirt isn’t the same as pictured. It’s more rainbow (see attached photos). I’ll probaby return it since the color I’m after is silver. Repurchased the black version and we were pleased with it.
4.0,Heaviest robe I could find - might be too heavy for some women.  Warm and thick for winter in the Midwest.
4.0,Love the fit of the top and bottom. My only complaint is that the top isn’t at ruffled as pictured. It’s more like 2 flat layers of fabric.
4.0,"Super cute but way to small. I'm a 29 pants and ordered a large based on the sz chart. Way too small. Very disappointed because it's a super cute skirt and I wanted it for St. Patty's day :( however, the return is free so yay for that!"
4.0,"Excelente,me gusto"
4.0,"Very nice bands, the color combos are great, I received compliments wearing the band.  I had to cut the band due to my small wrist, but they cut with scissors just fine."
4.0,Good at this price.buckles lite duty but perform.
4.0,"The only complaints I have about this suit is that it's a little tight in the arm pits and shoulder.  It looks great on, but it may be made for a shorter torso.  I bought a medium and I'm 5'6&#34;, 130 lbs."
4.0,Two of the shirts are a good fabric the third shirt is a different fabric that doesn't stretch.
4.0,"Good shoes for the money and prompt service by seller. Not a fancy pair of shoes.  If you are looking for something really durable and fancy you need to find something else.  Now if you are looking for something cute, inexpensive and comfortable enough to go to school for a kid whose feet will grow much faster than you can control, this may be a good choice.  My daughter likes them and she has been wearing them for nearly a month now about 2 or 3 times a week."
4.0,Children and teens love them
4.0,"I like it, but ended up returning it. It's ALOT of fabric. Would have had it taken up in the length."
4.0,"Shipping was incredibly slow, but really like the product."
4.0,"Nice for when you go out and want to take a small bag. Fits your ID, credit card and some money."
4.0,"This dress came in a different color than the picture shows; still beautiful but not the color I was expecting. I guess you get what you pay for. I have large breasts so it was a little snug in that area, but it was prom so it was okay to flaunt it. Overall it was comfortable and good for the price I paid."
4.0,Cheap but cute. Get what you pay for.
4.0,VERY PRETTY AND I LOVE IT
4.0,"This thing is super cool. Good size and detail. The only drawback is that hitting the head only snoozes it. You actually have to flip the “off” switch on the back to shut it off, which my son forgets to do all the time!"
4.0,"No, these aren’t the younger Viking Runes, they are the Elder Futhark Runes but if you know your stuff, you’d know the difference. Regardless, these are very nice. Good for the price as it’s my first set of rune jewelry that I will use for protection etc.. They’re Much bigger than I had anticipated (about the size of a water bottle cap), and are thick with a nice design front and back. My only concern is that the loop for the necklace in some of them needs to be tightened so they don’t fall off. I’d personally inspect that area anytime before use. Given the material, I would not shower with them because a little residual water can lead to rust. As a starter piece of jewelry/full set, they are good as long as you take care of them."
4.0,"The gloves are nice, and I bought them because of the reviews.  They just don't have padding where I need it, i.e., the palm edge of the glove and the center lower palm aren't padded"
4.0,"The dress is very flattering but it runs large. I bought a medium and it was way too big. I am 5'5 125lbs. I was gonna return it and order a small but they were out of smalls so I kept it and altered the dress to fit. With a little sewing, the dress fits fabulously!"
4.0,This item was nice.
4.0,"Super Cute. Very Flowy & Flattering. It is a smidge short in the front, but you cannot tell unless you raise both arms. The flow of the dress allows much more room when you sit down, so the length is not noticeable. FYI, the fabric in the arms are fitted, so may be a little tight. I am 5'4&#34;, 145lbs and a small is perfect."
4.0,Great shirt. Great quality. Runs SMALL. Got my husband an 2XL I’m going to have to return it to get a bigger size
4.0,"Because the small was sold out I got the medium. (Normally size 4-6) Next time I'll buy small. Fit is a little loose but fine. So I guess it's good that the sizing is forgiving.  They are super soft, and living in the desert thinner fabric  isn't so bad, very versatile. If I still lived in the mid west I bet I'd wish they were thicker."
4.0,"I bought the ""blue4 washed"" skirt. I wear a size small all around in everything so I ordered my regular size. I usually wear a size 4 in women's clothes as I am 5'2"" 120 pounds, athletic, so thicker thighs than the model shown in the pictures for this item. As soon as I opened the package, the skirt revealed this very strong odor. I love the skirt, I really do. I just feel like the backside could use a touch more fabric as naturally the backside will ride up a bit because of your rear end. It looks a little weird with the front side at a perfect length but as I turn in the mirror, it gets shorter in the back. Almost to the point where I'm not sure I will feel comfortable wearing in public. I may be contacting the seller and ordering a size up. Will let you know if I do and update my review. Overall, beautiful looking and well made, soft and comfortable to wear."
4.0,The wallet was an accidental purchase in the sense that I clicked 'one click purchaser's but I needed a wallet anyway. It's a lot larger than I thought and barely fits into my pocket. I'm 6'2&#34; 260 for comparison size. But overall it's a solid wallet and I like the feel.
4.0,Product fit as expected but the color was a little lighter and more pastel than I thought it would be.
4.0,It was as advertised. It's not high quality jewelry but it's great for the price
4.0,"Decent quality. However, they did not specify what size ring it is,  I'm assuming it's a size 6."
4.0,"Overall, it’s has a good thickness to it, a bit boxy and a little bit itchy. V-neck was not too low and hit just right. I got a size small."
4.0,Were as described 👍
4.0,I like them for the most part! A little too big but not bad for how inexpensive they are :)
4.0,"Very comfortable, good quality, fits as expected"
4.0,I love the design & feel of this gown. So soft & comfy but it is starting to peel up.
4.0,It's a weird material almost like a dry fit but my son loves this guy and the shirt so he wears it all the time
4.0,Kinda of small in size but cute still
4.0,Web said 90% modal and 10% spandex but tag says 90% modal and 10 % polyester.
4.0,Not like a rouge cloth / jewlers cloth. But works well on variety of metals. Has some what of an oder to it from cleaner on the cloth.
4.0,"Nice casual work shirt, it did shrink after first wash but did not fade lake others I have purchased. It’s a little more heavy than expected but easy to wear and breathes easy."
4.0,I love this shirt. I have been wearing it to work ( as a bank teller) and I receive complements on the necklace constantly! It is comfortable and flattering!
4.0,I love the way this dress feels I also love the fit.
4.0,I liked the fit didn’t care for side pockets. Overall very satisfied. I use it for working out.
4.0,Very nice product fits well on my daughters wrist
4.0,"I generally like the case. All my glasses fit easily in it. The only reason it is not 5-stars is that it's so soft it is hard to zip closed without crushing it... I really did expect it to have been so soft...<br />And the softness is nice, but maybe it too soft?"
4.0,It is a solid 4 and only missed a 5 because the material is so thin.  We bought two more so it works for us.
4.0,"Got for my 70 yr old mom who goes on walks... just in case she happens to fall, the phone would be easy to access.  It's pretty cheap looking and feeling but for the price, it works"
4.0,"Good product, nice color and arrives on time"
4.0,I love these. They are bigger them most sleep masks and that makes them very comfortable.<br />Great for blocking out the light.<br />I would highly reccommemd them.<br />UVH
4.0,"Really enjoy this dress. Material is soft and stretches. Be careful not to let it get caught on things, will in thread be gentle. Material is very thing so must wear a slip underneath with tank top. Really cute dress!"
4.0,"I use these when I am fly fishing. I clip them to my polarized sun glasses. They are a bit too heavy. Granted, the 4x power makes them fairly thick, but the lenses are larger (wider and taller) than others I have used. This makes them a little clunky and they make the sun glasses slide down a little more. I am a man, but I definitely would not recommend these to a woman with a smaller face. I think I will go for clip-ons with a little smaller profile next time. Otherwise they seem to be made well."
4.0,I got the tank in the mail today! I love it very cute and fits well! My only complaint is in the picture it looks more loose fitting and it’s more of a tight fit look. I got a medium and fits fine I’m 5’7 and 155 pounds
4.0,"This is a wonderful dress! The top is stretchy and fit perfectly (I am 5'6&#34;, 260lbs, and 44G so that means I am delighted to say that). The skirt is a very heavy fabric that holds the pleats for a delightful swish. The waist line is high, coming in right under my bust, which gave me a lovely hourglass look while simultaneously hiding my belly! The skirt fell just to my knees.<br /><br /> I was too impatient to iron (I ain't about that life) so I tossed it in the dryer to get the wrinkles out and it survived my callous treatment. I also promptly dripped hair oil on the bust and it survived a soap and spot scrub and came out clean! I am not gentle with my clothes.<br /><br />The dress loses a star solely because of the zipper. Not only is it cheaply made, the zip is tiny so it can be hard to keep ahold of, and the fine plastic teeth catch constantly. Even when not wearing it the dress is difficult to both zip and unzip. It required two people and a few minutes to get the thing closed because the zipper continually jammed.<br /><br />Also, no pockets, but the skirt is heavy enough that I feel absolutely confident putting them in myself! The pleats at the front are positioned perfectly for a couple of nice, deep pockets and the folds would hide a wallet and phone."
4.0,looks good nice and thin band does fit my wrist price is set at a good price
4.0,Excellent quality of the frame but the lenses are a miss. I was feeling psychedelic looking through the lenses with all the rainbow of colors. A better quality polarization coating is definitely needed. They would be 5 star glasses if they fix that.
4.0,"This VERY sparkly and looks really nice. My only complaint is that I have wide hands amd I could not get this on....I wish it had a open clasp. I gave it to my daughter, she loves it, but even she has a little problem getting it on....Best for a small built woman or older teen...IMHO"
4.0,"Very pretty color.  However, please read more about the size of this item."
4.0,"I have used this for a year and a half and the exterior has remained solid--and I'm pretty hard on things. The interior however has literally come unglued. The interior of the case is covered in a thick cardboard and it detached from the metal. I glued it back together and it's fine now. For the price, how long do you want something like this to last? I'd buy another, even knowing that at some point I'm going to have to glue the lining back in. Oh, and because it's metal it will stick to anything magnetic."
4.0,"I love the way it looks, it exactly like pictured. My fault for not reading the description carefully. I thought it came with 2 wrist cuffs, not 1! I will probably send it back, I really was disappointed in only having 1 cuff."
4.0,A bit small in the sleeves but super comfy and LOVE  the pockets!
4.0,"though it was a little big, he still looked good.  Thank you"
4.0,Fun. Good value
4.0,Very cute! They look great and look exactly like the picture.
4.0,It was very pretty I've got it for a gift from a friend and she absolutely loved it I just wished that it would have got here sooner
4.0,"Very nice necklaces in 2 lengths. Easy to make a different look each day, just by changing my pendants. This is a great choice for people with allergies. The silk rope is soft & will not cause itching or &#34;green neck&#34; from skin reactions to metal.<br />Also the color (black) is classic and goes with anything. The lobster clasp is a bit small for arthritic hands--that's my only drawback. Am very happy with my purchase!"
4.0,A little big but nice quality. Seem to keep my feet warmer.
4.0,My grand daughter asked me to order it.  She wears it with other clothes
4.0,"It's made of quality material and stylish. Unfortunate the size S, which I usually wear, is too large for me. I have to return it."
4.0,"En la descripción del producto es necesario especificar, colores sólidos (negro) 100% algodón, en gris (88% algodón 12% poliéster) y en puntos (60% algodón 40% poliéster) lo demás todo bien, pero si pensé que eran todos 100% algodón por lo que no me encantó el producto."
4.0,This necklace match many of my outfits. There is a nice clasp. The metal is a little cheap which is why I would only give it 4 stars.
4.0,These are nice and comfortable. Colors are vibrant. They do run small like what many other reviewers noticed. Better order 1 or 2 sizes up. The sleeves do not compress around your biceps (I find the sleeves a bit too loose fitting for me) so take note if you care about it.  Not very noticeable and neither good nor bad - just a style thing so it depends on your preference.
4.0,I’m happy with this sweater.  Pros:  It was true to its description.  It arrived within a week of ordering!  Downside: the material is on the scratchy side vs soft.
4.0,Wonderful soft quality fabric. Too large but use them to sleep in.
4.0,"I’m 5’7” and 170lbs and got a medium and it fits the right amount of flowy and covers the top part of my arms that I always want to hide perfectly. My only dislike is the color of the red, it’s not a deep maroon/burgundy like the pic shows, it’s a much brighter red, not bad, I’m keeping it, but I will wear for July 4th."
4.0,"Solid material.... however, the buckle is small, but it works for me."
4.0,"It's an ok item, not overly excited about it for the price..."
4.0,These are adorable. They seem like they would hold up to my 5 year old and serve their purpose.
4.0,"I will say thought I waited a little while to receive this, I really like it and have gotten a lot of compliments on it. I take into consideration the low cost and the elbow patches make sense - they are not of amazing quality but they do get the aesthetic one would hope for. I got the red one, but its more of a blush pink - but I still love it. It's a great piece for your fall wardrobe and  doesn't feel like it will unravel after the first wash."
4.0,"Runs small. Order the next size up. Other than that, it's very cute."
4.0,Overall the dress is cute. It's a little tighter than I thought it would be and the fabric is kind of see-through so I'll have to wear a white slip or shape wear under it. The red is a little darker in person and the fabric is cheaper than it looks on the model.
4.0,Seems tough and easy to install. Lightweight and compact.
4.0,"Perfect size not too small or large, My wife like it a lot especially the weight of the chain. Hard to break."
4.0,I'm 5&#34;2.5 and 135lbs and these are a little big on me. They are not at all like lularoe leggings as some reviewers said. They are a more shiny/silky material. I purchased the pack of 6 for $30 which makes them an excellent value for the price. Even at $10 a pair they are good for the price.
4.0,"I took my measurements in order to get the right fit, but it still was a little off. I love the dress, however, so I will keep it and a couple of alterations to make it fit. I'll have to take in the hips... my waist is thicker, so apparently I am also supposed to have a pair of formidable hips to match. I don't. I will also the have to do a couple of small darts to lessen the gaping armhole areas. When that iui s done, though, the dress will be perfect!"
4.0,"I got this for my wife who is traveling to the Caribbean in a couple of weeks. She loves it! The hat is soft, folds in half, and is easy to pack. It provides UV protection, which she really needs.  It is reversible, which gives you 2 for 1. That is a nice feature. This is a bucket hat, so there is nothing too fashionable about it- but it does the job."
4.0,"This sleeveless, vertical striped dress is very retro and classic looking.  It has a slimming design that will look good on almost all body shapes.  There is no designed waist – this is achieved with the sash belt – but it can be worn without it for a shift style look.<br /><br />The material is machine washable.  I use warm water and permanent press cycle for 100% polyester.  This is an attractive dress for casual wearing."
4.0,Works for what was needed
4.0,It fits the Pandora bracelet I am giving my 12 yr. old granddaughter.
4.0,Somewhat small but does have a zipper in back the length is nice I'm 5 foot 10 and some of them are half Way line
4.0,The leather is lush and feels expensive. I recommend this belt. Just be sure to accurately (and honestly) order your waist size.
4.0,"I'm short and quite skinny, and had the time of my life a few years ago when Amazon was flooded with ""Chinese sizes"". Now some of the same companies no longer make clothes for extra-petite people, so I often have to pass on clothes that are beautiful otherwise, just because they turn out to be an unflattering fit for me. I had high hopes for this Grace Karin cardigan and it's a really good-quality cardigan in every possible way (warm, cozy, good stitches, buttons sewn on tight), but eventually for someone taller than me."
4.0,"Fit as expected and I have received many compliments, my friend even ordered one for herself."
4.0,"The only thing that I don't love about this sweater is the pockets are a bit low for me.  My hand barely touches the top of the pocket, but the overall fit is great!"
4.0,"Good size. Good quality.  Held 2 water bottles,  toilet paper,  sandwiches, wallet and more. I only wish the straps were longer. Worked well enough."
4.0,I have worn these 4 times and the side popped as I was stepping on the curb
4.0,I used this for work when I was pregnant. Its comfy and profesional looking blouse.
4.0,"So very warm,will be great during winter!"
4.0,"Cute dress, fits well. A little thinner fabric than I thought it would be, if you get the light color you need to wear a slip."
4.0,"nice packaging, delivered as said.  I rated it 4 stars because the clip that connects the end of the necklace was broken.  Luckily I was able to find one very similar to it in my house.  Be weary of that, but other than that the necklace key chain and bracelet looks good!"
4.0,Bought this for a semi-formal evening wedding.  Comfortable and fits well.  Not too long with 2 1/2 inch heels or higher.  Drawback:  NO POCKETS.
4.0,Great blazer for work. The color is just as pictured.
4.0,Love the style....Make sure you take off them before you wash your hands to keep from tarnishing.
4.0,The print looks more like bats in person.<br />Still a nice gift for a cat lover (like me).<br />Goes with most outfits.<br /><br />Item does take a long time to ship (overseas).
4.0,I ordered a Large and it was more like a XLARGE or 2XL
4.0,Nice heavy duty belt thank you.  I'm sure it will last many years years.
4.0,The only complaint is that this item is losing color after about 6 washes. Very comfortable and stretchy though.
4.0,This is the most comfortable sports bra I have ever purchased.<br />The color is more pink than red but it looks like the picture and that's fine.<br />Not high impact but given the prior reviews I expected to have to double up anyway.<br />Would recommend and have already done so.<br />A hug from a fluffy ☁ cloud.
4.0,"These are very soft and seem to be squat proof. I am five feet five inches and weigh about 125lbs. They seem a little long on me and also just a little baggy in the front when I’m crouched. When I’m standing you don’t notice it. I might try to shrink them a little bit. These are not what I would call a dupe for the Gymshark ombré but for the price they are nice leggings. If they hold up well I would consider ordering another pair. But at the end of the day ladies, if you want Gymshark quality. You’ll have to spend the money. I own many of their leggings and I’ve just not found any “dupes” that really live up to that quality."
4.0,The sweater was a little short but looks great
4.0,"Love them, but size chart is off. Very comfy, cute and not to warm...as I live in South Florida...most slippers get to toasty and can't wear long.  Gave 4 stars because the size chart is off...I am a size 9...says to order large....too big...see photo...I will order again in the future..but a medium."
4.0,"Sizing is on point.  It's stamped and seems more sturdy than what you'd normally get for an item this inexpensive.<br />We shall see how it holds up.<br /><br />The card that came in the box, finethat is something I'll let ya'll rate yourselves.."
4.0,My son absolutely loves them but they are much bigger and heavier than we anticipated. He still wears them a lot and gets comments every time.
4.0,Wish it didn’t wrinkle so easily.
4.0,"The material is stretchy and a really nice sparkly black color. The style is cute and classy. I am usually a 6, and the 6 fit me perfectly on top but at the tummy area the dress is too narrow so that any tummy you have is very conspicuous through the stretchy material. My sister who is very thin (she's a size 2/4) tried on my dress and had the same problem.. I don't know who can fit into this, a shame because it is so pretty."
4.0,The neckline is boat neck. Bra straps are always showing.
4.0,The shoes were a lot smaller than I anticipated but my mother loved them so I guess it didn't matter much to her. A little piece of home for her to wear. Good quality and looked pretty.
4.0,"Easily fits pumps and high heels. Sneakers fit comfortably as well, but require some wiggling to get in. I use these about 2-3 times a week for my trainers. Zipper is beginning to separate from the bag (after 5 months of use) but still usable for now."
4.0,Very cute but if you sweat the rings on the back that touch your skin will rust and leave rust marks on your skin and or clothes. Be careful.
4.0,"These garters look nice, but they aren't super high-quality. I wore mine at my wedding and one of them started to come apart a few hours in and kept sliding down. Since I'm not planning to ever wear them again, I'm not too upset, but I do wish it would have stayed together better."
4.0,Good product. I just got this in today and I already love it but I do wish they had a size XXL. I knew that the sizes were going to come in smaller than normal so I ordered a 1X seeing as I am a large — because I like the sweatshirt a little baggy — so I thought the 1X would do it but it fits like a Large. I’m glad I didn’t get the large otherwise I would be able of wear it. The product is good but I recommend you get a size or two larger depending on the bust and how baggy you want it to be. A 2X would have been perfect if they had the size
4.0,"It met my expectations, as an everyday wearable necklace."
4.0,"The logo emblem is a bit small, but it is exactly what I expected. No frills, nothing fancy, just a less oppressive headgear than the hard-hat I got with my CERT gear last month. Something I could more comfortably wear during a non-catastrophe event."
4.0,"These are really nice, though they are a bit heavy and pull down slightly on my ears. Also, one of the backings broke the second time I tried to put it on. I have never had an earring backing break - the hole expanded so that it will no longer fit and is useless. The earrings look great if I secure the backings high enough to keep them from drooping. Maybe I need to get the smaller sizes for my ears."
4.0,Great hat but the L/XL was bigger than size chart stipulated. My friend sewed in velcro to inner ban to tighten.  Worked great!
4.0,"This visor/beanie is pretty comfortable and extremely soft. This will be great for running in the cold, or really any other fall/winter outdoor activities. Suitable for sports and sweat since the inner bill is made of plastic and can be washed easily. The inside of the beanie is lined with super soft, stretchable fabric and the outside is a stretchy, soft pink knit. Perfect for buns and ponytails too! I would definitely recommend this product."
4.0,These are cute and light weight but are a bigger earring.
4.0,"I love this style and the support is just right, but they are very thin and look like they could tear easily."
4.0,Shipping was long .. Beautiful product
4.0,This necklace was just what I was looking for.  It has a lot of sparkle and is recognizable as an apple.  I tried to get the 18&#34; chain but ran into roadblocks so I ordered with the 16&#34; chain which is a bit short for me.  I am a retiring teacher who will enjoy wearing this as a reminder of my wonderful career.
4.0,They were pretty good even for my chubby legs they do tend to roll down but thats to be expected of my body type I personally wear them folded or scrunched with my doc martens
4.0,I really like this shirt but do have to be careful to wash it on cool gentle cycle and either air dry it or dry on low/no heat for a short time.  It is so much comfier and warmer than so many sweatshirts that I'm OK with the care it needs during washing.
4.0,It arrived late<br />.
4.0,Leight weight
4.0,"Good quality hat.  I have a larger head (I normally wear a L/XL flexfit), and this ran a little snug."
4.0,Really fast ship.  This necklace is beautiful.  I wish it wasn't so small around the neck.  I just bought extenders so it won't feel like a choker.  Otherwise beautiful.
4.0,Super Cute Can't wait to wear this in the warmer months
4.0,"CONFIE, looks good"
4.0,"Runs a little big, I could have got the next size down for a better fit but it's super cute and comfy!"
4.0,Its soft leather good quality wallet. I like it for the price paid
4.0,"I typed in ""cotton"" dresses and this is not cotton.  Disappointed that it is not cotton, but like the dress.  I would like my directions followed when I put in a request."
4.0,Very cute and fit perfectly! Just didn't need anymore!
4.0,It was nice but unfortunately it’s big for me so I’ll gift it to my sis in law
4.0,"Shipping was a lot faster than expected and estimated by USPS.  I think the ring is actually a bit longer than stated, but that's not really an issue; my usual barbell was beginning to rub against the top of my piercing which was making a small blister on my belly, so longer is better in my case.  The irritation is almost completely cleared up after wearing this ring for two days.  It's flexible and comfortable.  I made sure to sterilize with alcohol prior to putting it in to prevent any further irritation or infection.  I wish it had come with an invoice or some kind of paperwork but I'm satisfied with my purchase and hopefully will remain that way."
4.0,"I like the plain style and the navy color.  Being silky on the outside makes it easier to turn over in bed , and the fabric is a year round weight.  I do not like having to hem the pajama bottoms because of their being extra long."
4.0,Surprised that the quality was decent with the low cost and the fact you got 2 instead of one. I had to return mine though for the color was off from what I was looking for.
4.0,My 14 year old daughter is into steampunk jewelry - I am fine with that as long as it isn't too big. This bracelet made both of us happy.  She loved it! It was a little smaller than I thought but it fit her wrist perfectly.  She hasn't taken it off.  I love that it isn't &#34;over the top&#34; and the infinity sign symbolizes our faith in God - no beginning and no end.  It was a win-win!  I did not give it 5 stars just because it was a little smaller than I thought it was going to be - but that turned out to be a good thing anyway.
4.0,These are comfortable I bought more than one pair you do have to wash them and then hang them up to dry but that’s not a big deal
4.0,It's good quality for the price. The only problem is that my work uniform is a white polo and there is a clear color transfer. After a couple of times wearing it I had grayish/ black marks on my white shirt.
4.0,"I bought this shirt because of the attached face mask, it really comes in handy."
4.0,Has a few unusable cards in the deck.
4.0,Everyday use .
4.0,"The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the small fit. I usually order Medium jackets, still alowing me space to put some underlayer. Not with this one. This bomber jacket fits me only if having a thin underlayer beneath. It's very thin, with almost no padding, so it feels like a windbreaker. Nonetheless, it's very pretty. I would recommend you to size up if you want it for something else other than just aesthetics."
4.0,I feel like the beads are a little &#34;plasticy&#34; opposed to feeling more natural and porous to hold oils.  But great price and attractive piece.
4.0,Little bit pricey but overall I really like these. The draw strings around the ankles dont really work that great so when I wear them out walking they end up lower than I like but around the house theyre one of my favortie pairs of lounging pants. Very comfortable material and the fit is nice
4.0,"Is cute, soft and comfortable. I really like it."
4.0,Pretty Pretty Pretty Burgundy Color
4.0,"I appreciated how they had the dress inside out for shipping so that it was easier to fold, Fits as expected and looks great"
4.0,fits perfect. nice and long and love the pockets
4.0,Good wallet. I hope the RFID blocker works.
4.0,"Let's ignore this is an homage watch, you can't get a lot better for this price. Is it going to be equal to an Omega? No, it can't, but the fact that is halfway there by 90% less is impressive. I mean, how many cheap terrible watches are sold by fashion brands at this price point? I mean, you could get an Invicta, but they tend to stamp their branding everywhere, or you could buy a plain Seiko 5 field watch, but it would be plain looking with its silk printed dial and uniform vessel. Finally, you could go for a replica, but I think is a different conversation when you say ""I bought this watch because I like how it looks"" when you have a plain or no brand then when you are faking a brand. Because then you didn't buy it because you like it, you bought it because you want to buy a social status, and you would be miserably failing in doing so.<br /><br />With this watch, you get a Miyota (Citizen) movement with, and I agree it sucks they lied and said it came with a Seiko, but I read the comments and knew what I was getting into. I still think is a pretty decent movement for the price, thus why I qualify it with 4 stars rather than five."
4.0,Love what it says. Runs small.
4.0,"Lovely chain, but very delicate! It looks nice when I layer with other necklaces."
4.0,"Good fit, not enough arch support"
4.0,"They worked for my costume, but the boot is a bit slim and the feet part of it are too narrow, despite being a bit long on my feet. I have average-sized calves and average-length legs for a 5'5&#34; person."
4.0,"At least a hand lengthy too long. Overall too baggy, I usually wear an XL and this is more like a 2x"
4.0,This was a gift.  Very cute.
4.0,"Only worn once, worked ok"
4.0,It's a nice skirt I'm 5'5&#34; about 150 pounds I ordered a medium bc I wanted the prime shipping but I should have gotten a large bc I don't like it when my clothes are super tight around the waste. But the colors and fabric are nice
4.0,This is the only brand of swim trunks my dad will wear. I got him another pair for his trip and he loves them. The only reason I took away a star is because the color isn't the same as picture.
4.0,"Purse is beautiful. Soft leather. Beautiful camel color. Convenient wallet organizer in the front. Great purse for a minimalist. Be aware that if you stuff the inner picket with too much it lessens the space you have inside the purse. The only cons are the strap adjustment mechanisms. There is a little leather loop that holds the spare end in place. This keeps slipping down. When it does the buckle slips and the strap comes apart. My purse fell to the ground. I’ll secure it and that won’t happen again. The only other con is with the seller, and I’ll provide the seller feedback. The picture shows the strap is removable. My straps are sewn in. In the end, I’m very happy with this purse."
4.0,Pretty light weight skirt<br />Perfect for summer
4.0,"Nice cases, good price for 3 pairs.  Not spring hinged and quality of lenses was just OK.  They are certainly wide enough frames for any head."
4.0,"Casual wear, thin dress."
4.0,Gee
4.0,The fabric was just to clinging to the body thru bust and waist.  Shows everything including pantry lines.  I might have been happier with a larger size but the other drawback was the fabric.  It’s a blend that tends to be “hot” on these hot and humid days.  It’s a real shame because the dress truly is cute as a button and just my style.  I ended up returning it.
4.0,It's exactly what is says in the description. My daughter loved it.
4.0,"Nice sturdy leather, great look and fit. Four stars because the leather color of both boots didn't quite match up and you could see the difference.  One was a lighter shade than the other. Since I do like the boots overall I am solving the problem by weathering the lighter one a bit and then putting a good polish on both of them."
4.0,Very nice for the price.<br />Good for stylish girls.<br />Definitely would buy again.
4.0,A little larger than expected but over all very cute
4.0,Noted mild shedding of fur
4.0,"The Bella Ryann bracelets are less expensive versions of the alex and ani, but are of really great quality.  They are lighter in weight, but wear extremely well and have not tarnished or turned. (I've had the clover one for over a year)"
4.0,I ordered in my regular size but it is a pretty big shirt however I tend to wear a lot of leggings and long shirts in the fall/winter so I’m good with that! I couldn’t tell in the photos but the sleeves at the end are ribbed. I purchased the green and it’s a very nice shade and the material of the shirt is SUPER soft and stretchy so it will be very comfortable for the colder months! Can also wear it off shoulder with how large and roomy it is as well.
4.0,My dad loves these
4.0,"I have been wanting this dress for a while, but being a 34 DD it is hard to find dresses that fit. I read the reviews, looked at all the pictures people posted, and felt pretty safe just going up one size, nope, the waist and hips look great, but my entire chest is exposed!  Love the dress other than that, I may try a large as it is a true wrap dress, I would highly recommend this dress, just make sure you get the right size. go up 2 sizes if you have big boobs!  just tried returning this dress, if you live in a small town you either have to pay for UPS to come pick it up, or pay for gas to go to a UPS store, was going to order another one. but not now, I will give this to my less well endowed friend"
4.0,"I bought three belts from different manufacturers in one order, and this was the only one that was actually leather. Is it the finest belt I've ever owned? Nope. But, it looks nice, has no apparently flaws and it the exactly size it is supposed to be."
4.0,They work as intended.
4.0,It's a very nice belt. can NOT give it a 5 star rating because I ordered black and recieved tan. So I returned it.
4.0,Super cute dress! It does have shoulder pads but if you take them out it’s perfect!
4.0,Easy enough to use . Just had to figure it out
4.0,brought for my twins birthday so cute
4.0,I was recently in a motor vehicle accident and I am spending a lot of time at home.  These have a nice weight and provide good support for every day around the house.  I give them a 4 because I wish that they are a little more &#34;soft and plush.&#34;
4.0,"Surprise for my husband for Father's day. The loves the fit, and comfort. He's a 10.5 and I ordered 11. They are a little tight but have stretched out just enough to fit snug but not slide off."
4.0,"I bought this belt because I previously had a braided leather belt I really enjoyed. I love that you can tie the belt anywhere and not have to make additional holes.<br />This belt looks nice and does not seem cheap or flimsy. But because it's not very wide, it will struggle to stay flat on your waist"
4.0,"The only negative thing is I had a pair of gloves like this before but it had buttons by the wrist so I could unbutton them and take my hand out, with these gloves I had to keep taking it off an on. Other than that, they are comfortable and fit well."
4.0,I read the reviews before purchasing.  It's cute.  Wish it was larger.  But I'm a bit round!  Hahaha....<br />Don't have super high standards and you'll be pleasantly satisfied with this.  The other reviews helped me in what to expect so I wasn't surprised when I got it.
4.0,Wanted to use them as crossbody for my handbags good & sturdy product  I couldn’t use it was too wide
4.0,I really like the dress. It was just what i hoped for.
4.0,"I have been on a mission to find the perfect pirate corset and this one was spot on as far as the look I was going for.  Unfortunately, it was too big in the bust and I was afraid to try going down a size as it fit well every where else."
4.0,My stepdad is passionate about golfing. He has always golfed. I bought this jacket as a surprise for his birthday. He loved it!
4.0,I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this shirt! So unique and beautiful! It’s like gypsy meets flapper! Only issue I have is that on one side it has this weird gathering that makes these little pockets on the one side. Don’t know what that is all about
4.0,"Very nice solid poster very durable, color coding of players easy to read and handle placing on board. Only hang up is we draft late in our league and some players are not available but the good thing there were plenty of blank stickers to write in."
4.0,The beanie is very comfortable.
4.0,"I have had the boots for a month. The soles are very comfortable, Upper boot seems a little tight even with the laces loosened. Zipper functions great, and is a huge convenience.<br />I ordered them a half size bigger the my normal boot because of all the reviews that said the boot was a bit tight. Even in a half extra size they are a little snug.<br />After a little time they will ware in just right.<br /><br />Very fast delivery."
4.0,The dress was nice quality. I’m 5’3” 134lbs and ordered a medium. It was longer than expected and too big in the shoulders so I’m sending it back. Prettier then expected
4.0,The rose gold is very pretty but I found the earrings too large. Gem stones also didn’t look authentic.
4.0,"Pretty, but heavy and thick."
4.0,Gift for wife who loves it.
4.0,Safety precautions during Covid.
4.0,"Overall a good product, but the headphones fit a little weird on me, maybe it’s just my head shape, but it’s nothing super uncomfortable and I’m still gonna use them"
4.0,"Colors are as shown. Delivered timely. Just a touch itchy, but its very warm."
4.0,Fits my crocs. Good buy
4.0,"Got this for my 5 yr old.  She absolutely loved it.  I actual like the fact that it's not super thick.  She sweat in her head and hates hats for that reason, but she loved this set.  First it ""looks"" just like her.  Second and more importantly, shes willing to wear it and last,  it doesn't make her sweat in her head."
4.0,"I am giving it four stars because the garment was of good quality. However I didn’t get to use it because the dress was not ready, it had to be taken to a seamstress and I did not have the time. I have to return it. I don’t know what are the chances that I get invited to a Hindu wedding again in this lifetime"
4.0,"Pretty colors!! Runs small through the chest, but will be fine if I lose 10 lbs!!"
4.0,"So far, I have only tried the blue pair.  The first time I wore them, my ears became inflamed, and I could not tell if it was from the sharp edge on the ear post or the metal itself.  I let my ears heal, filed off the sharp edge and tried them again.  This time, they were ok.  The manufacturer needs to smooth the end of the ear post to prevent injury."
4.0,Fits as expected for my son. He loves it. Soft material but more on dry fir material. Would purchase again!
4.0,"The skeleton watch look is pretty solid with this watch, though the finish it noticeably low quality.<br /><br />I'd personally save this watch for times where you want it slightly poking out the sleeve of a button up so you get the feel without drawing too much attention to its detail, but it's passable as a nice fashion accessory."
4.0,"Maybe I have hands that are the wrong proportion or maybe I just got the wrong size, but when I try to use these gloves on my screen, there is extra glove material at the fingertips which makes using a phone pretty non-precise. I end up clicking buttons I don't mean to and for anything other than just accepting a call, I usually end up taking off the gloves anyway.<br /><br />Touchscreen compatibility aside though, these gloves are really good as, well, just gloves. Overall I'm still happy with them and they work great for dog park runs in the wintertime!"
4.0,"Slit not as open as shown, but dress is very flowy and sits well on the body."
4.0,Adequate quality for price but face of studs a little large & other end a little small
4.0,Daughter seems to love it.  But definitely not as fluffy as it looks in the picture.
4.0,A gift for my brother and he loved it.
4.0,Received both the light and dark version today. Both are a thin material and not at all hoodie like which I was expecting from reading other reviews. I like to layer so this isn't a big deal for me. The shoulders are very cute and a nice touch to make the shirt feminine. There is no material under that mesh/lacy fabric if anyone was wondering.<br /><br />I ordered a medium in both. I'm 5'3 and about 135lbs. I also wear a 36B. This size fit me just right. A little more room wouldn't of been bad but I think the large would of been too much for my taste. The material is a little stretchy which has me believing that over time it will get more loose. The sides on the very bottom of this hoodie do scrunch a little as part of the shirts design which I did not notice before receiving this item. Not a fan of shirts having that look but it's only about an inch long so I'm not upset about it.<br /><br />The only thing I thought was a little weird was that the dark gray had a larger neck/hood to it. I have to pull the draw strings out to help control it better. The light gray is perfect as is and doesn't feel like it has excess material for the neck. Not sure what that's about.<br /><br />I will give it four stars until I experience multiple wears and washes.
4.0,Fits great went with a large despite being a small in US sizing and it looks awesome! Pretty good quality
4.0,Overall this dress was a really nice quality and looks very cute. The cut of the top was a bit of a weird fit for my body; came up very high in the front even with the straps loose.
4.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; and 133lbs. Bra size is 34 C. I have a small waste, but thick thighs. Due to the form fitted nature of this garment on the legs, I went for a Medium and it fits. The fabric is light, soft and stretchy, but it does show a few lumps and bumps. As others have mentioned, it is a bit long for my height, but I don't mind that. I read a review about the wine color being much brighter than the picture, so I expected that and it's true. It's not a dark wine color but it is a pretty blue-based red. (See photo, this is the WINE.) I ordered a couple other jumpers to try. So if this one is the best of the bunch, I'll keep it. But it isn't quite as flattering as I had hoped."
4.0,I liked this shirt so much that I bought another.  Great shirt for the money
4.0,"These compression socks are a great value.  They are on the tall side for me at 5’4”, but they are nice and snug, as they should be.  Seem to be quality made to last a long time."
4.0,Fits as expected. Nice & warm even outside in the cold but not too warm inside. Good quality. I wear them all day on weekends & by the end of the day my feet hurt but I bought some foam inserts at the Dollar Store & now they're perfect even all day.
4.0,Great slipper only thing is the stitches holding it starts to undo.
4.0,"I like it, the fit is perfectly.  I just wish it would've been advertised as a maternity dress because although I'll still wear it, its definitely a maternity dress with all its stretchy gathering around the middle."
4.0,Separate compartment for Shoes.<br />Nice space.<br /><br />Lot of slots for difference purposes. I use each one and happy with product. If you take protein shakes and all. It is small for that.
4.0,"This is a replacement for a grey one i lost thay was a few years old and... at least its seems to be the same quality that one was, but this one being white (creamish off white really) shows all the dirt you put on it... so learn to wash it as you'll need to - frequently!<br /><br />Aside from my idiotic colour choice, i still like this hat, its lightweight and warm for its size, you can shove it in your jacket without it taking up much room and it hopefully will hold up well like its predecessor.<br />I actually choose this over a much warmer one that lives in my car unused everytime as i dont like bulky winter gear, FYI.<br />(And btw. the white was the cheapest to buy at the time)<br /><br />Recommended."
4.0,If your buying for a youth with a small head the ear plugs will be pretty far back and not really usable. They are larger than most youth goggles and took a little work to get the eyes sealed because we were used to smaller youth goghles6
4.0,"The elastic in the waistband and slim legs make for a very flattering fit and perfect length in Short for 5'3&#34;. The fabric feels a bit heavier than some of my Columbia hiking pants, but is lightweight overall. There is no attachment to roll up the pants.<br /><br />The only negative was that the hook closure broke the first time I wore the pants! The metal the hook attaches to fell off, but the hook was still there, so I just attached the hook to the hole left in the fabric and it held (thank goodness!).<br /><br />Except for the hook, I really liked these!"
4.0,I bought the todoroki jacket and when it came in it was like 2 shades lighter than what was pictured. That was pretty much my only problem.
4.0,"This Mask is Clearly not for a 6 year old.. My Son wore it to School, once I picked him up he had a different Mask on. He asked his Teacher for another Mask because he could not see. It covered his Eyes..Great Design.. Great Material.."
4.0,These are my favorite sunglasses! I like the blockage from the sun - it's kind of a greenish blue tint. I've had these for about a year and the lenses are starting to rub off. I may get them again and expect them to last a year.
4.0,"I have worn these outside now a couple times in calm 20-25deg F weather, once just standing around holding a cold beer, and another time doing some yard cleanup.  I was pleased with how warm they kept my hands, even my fingertips were not too cold.  They are soft and flexible, and not at all bulky or heavy.  Medium size fit my hands perfectly; I am average build 5'8"".  Can't speak to the durability but for the price if I can get a few years out of them I'd be happy."
4.0,"These are quite lovely and exactly as pictured. I really like the cut because they cover more of my bum than some other thong style underwear. I have been wearing boring underwear for a while now because I just had a baby, and these are a happy medium between comfortable old lady style underwear and something a bit more sexy.<br /><br />I like that the package comes with a variety of colors so that I can match them to bras. They are also not that visible underneath pants etc which is always nice.<br /><br />The fit is good, I always tend to order my underwear a size up so that they don't dig in.<br /><br />Be careful when washing these as they seem quite delicate. I would wash them on the delicate cycle or even hand wash with your bras and other delicate underwear.<br /><br />They seem like decent quality, especially for the price, and I would recommend them. They are definitely on par with big name underwear retailers' quality, look, and style.<br /><br />I did receive a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,What have been a 5 if dolphins emblem was on it. But I love it!
4.0,"This dress was super cute.  I sized up because any others I have bough are always really small up top.  They are also usually really long.  This one was not.  I'm 5'4"" ordered a large, and it is almost too short.  I think it will be fine with flats, but it is definately way shorter than others I have ordered."
4.0,looks more tapers in the picture but its still nice material and comfortable to wear
4.0,Only thing I didn't like about it was the fabric going into my mouth.
4.0,Nice color selection and were light weight as described.
4.0,These are so super cute! I ordered a second immediately after receiving the first. My only hang up is the color combo. I got the pink to match my nursery -- but I'm not sure why the makers are so attached to red and pink together.
4.0,"It is a nice wallet. There is plenty of places for credit cards. The only negative is that the pocket for cash is a little small. However, I would purchase this item again."
4.0,"So far so good! They are comfortable and fit as expected. Just tight enough but not restrictive, and the padding fits my rear nicely. Definitely made rides more comfortable so far... I will update after a few more rides and some longer rides."
4.0,"These are nice, but beware that the finish is gold tone, not the more silver that the picture looks more like."
4.0,Love this but totally disappointed it did not come with the bottoms. Had I caught that when I ordered I would have passed.
4.0,Runs a little small and pocket kept coming out of the rip on the upper right side so I had to cut the pocket.
4.0,I thought it was SS : guess I should read all the fine print lol
4.0,Ordered the size 8-10 for my 9 year old and it fits perfectly. It is too long but she doesn’t mind she’s wearing heals in the photo. Material is thin but good quality.
4.0,It's beautiful love it
4.0,"This top is pretty, but looks a bit maternity-like on me."
4.0,These masks will do the job but they aren’t the softest. They are a bit stiff and textured. They might be better after I wash them.
4.0,Very satisfactory purchase.
4.0,"I love these leggings, the amount of favorable reviews made my decision to buy them a very easy one. The leg openings are a little loose, but personally, I prefer that look. There weren't many color choices in my size (large) so I went with the brown/gray. I'm tired of always being in black leggings it was great to get a different color. I'm 5'5 and weight +/-130lbs. I have a 3 pregnancy belly and the waist sits a little below that poor tone area, which I really like because I'm not constantly being reminded of the fact that I should be in the gym. The fit is definitely compression but the dark color hides the underwear lines and they are absolutely not see through. I highly reccommend them"
4.0,"I haven't really got to use it that much yet just playing it, it seems to work well with heat and sweat, I have some scenario's coming up where I can put it to the test"
4.0,So i wore this product for the first time last night to a party. I only had it on for about 4 hours. In that time i had no slips or mishaps. You have to realize that the nature of the beast is nothing is perfect but this product will keep your shirt tucked in and your socks up but not perfectly. Over all is a good product that works.  The only reason i gave it 4 stars is its not the most comfortable.
4.0,"My stetson was a little too big, this is really doing the trick.  Probably overpriced, but it works."
4.0,This fit true to size and looked great. Also washed well.
4.0,Good comfortable jacket. I have worn maybe 5/6 time and stitching seems to be coming out. Would not recommend as a daily jacket more weekly.
4.0,"Super cute, hangs well. It's a bit short, so depending on your job, you'll need to keep this for date night or wear leggings underneath (I'm 5'4&#34; with a 29&#34; inseam, 38D. Bought a L)."
4.0,"I’m a hat connoisseur, & have purchased many hats in a variety of shapes and prices, from $15 to $350. I find the pillbox style to be very flattering & easy to wear. Just place it at a jaunty angle & secure with a hat pin or stick pin. I bought this hat in black in preparation for a funeral. It arrived a bit smushed, but very easy to get back into proper shape. The length of the netting veil is very appropriate, covering my eyes. I’m looking forward to wearing it for other events that call for a black hat. It’s definitely something that will travel well. Just put the veil in the hat, fill the inside of the hat to encourage it to hold its shape, & put in a suitcase! I hope to find the best way to do my hair so that it looks great! I’ll probably add a photo once I’ve found the best way to wear it!"
4.0,"The top is very nice. As pictured.  I usually need a XL in Pattyboutik. I work out and have muscular arms so L is too tight in the arms.  Even some XL are beginning to be cut too slim in the arm. PATTYBOUTIK should take note and add more fabric as most items include lycra or similar item so they'd still remain smug even on those with slimmer arms. That being said, only a L was available so I tried it and on this top it fit beautiful. A bit snug in chest (36DDD), but was able to stretch the fabric a bit and wear a minimizer bra.  It is low cut. Had to pull up a few times throughout the day so if you don't like cleavage you'll need to wear a camisole or tank underneath. The fabric is soft and warm. Thin enough to wear in spring and warm enough for winter for inside. Need a coat if going outside."
4.0,Nice oversized tunic sweater.
4.0,Stayed on my dog only for a few minutes.  He will never wear them I am sure
4.0,"Beautiful, however few wrong stitches. Mine had a button coming off, and too large, but she can still grow into it and she looks gorgeous!"
4.0,This little hat is simply adorable for baby. It is shaped to look like a strawberry and easy to slide on babies head. It does have a strap to adjust the fit of the hat. The biggest plus for me is the SPF protection for vulnerably baby-scalps. It is a cute and functional protection for a day at the beach.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful, it fits on my daughter perfect, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the dress doesn't actually puff out, I had to buy a shimaly to do the job. Other than that beautiful dress."
4.0,Like it but material pils  after 1st washing
4.0,Quality is good.  Interesting example of a Chinese product whose labels exhibit Chinese pride.
4.0,"Really cute for work. Needs a cami underneath if you don't want to show a lot of cleavage. Washes well, but holds static like crazy. Use fabric softener and air dry to avoid this problem."
4.0,"This cut is sooo cute! I originally ordered a size medium, it was VERY tight. I’m 5’7” & 155 lbs. I am exchanging for a size large<br /><br />The dress is a very tight fit but so fun and flattering. Good material"
4.0,"Love the color!  It is smaller than I really would like, but the pockets are good.  I don't tend to change purses often, so this one is good for shorter uses.  It was quite stiff when I first started using it, but it is stretching out.  All and all, I like it, but I wouldn't purchasing another."
4.0,you should just but this! it is very cool and full of features. READ the instruction manual! you will love its feel and look
4.0,Works nice but way to expensive
4.0,They are a little tight on my big feet but still work just fine.
4.0,"I absolutely love it. It is a size smaller than I expected, but I am handy with a needle and I am happy to adjust it where I need to to make it fit a bit more comfortably. It is lined, but not fully. I will still wear a slip underneath it because I think the lining may be flimsy. I am happy with the purchase overall, but I would recommend you order larger than you expect and prepare to do some work on it for maintenance of the lining."
4.0,"they came very late, but are very nice"
4.0,"I ordered one, and accidently ordered two. It was also difficult to order. I wish they were larger. Onr pair had the plastic backs  were missing."
4.0,A little snug and a little thin compared to some others I have.<br />Can't really complain with the price though.
4.0,"I just received it and time will tell, but so far it appears to be sturdy and functional, with plenty of pockets for organizing items, and a padded laptop section in the center. I especially appreciate that it is lightweight and has a comfortable shoulder strap that is long enough to be carried cross-body."
4.0,"working well, though i would need to use a little more strength to polish on stubborn areas."
4.0,"I ordered Large but perhaps should have ordered medium.  Sometimes these inexpensive dresses run small, this did not,"
4.0,The bra was a bit big for me but it's a great product
4.0,"I like these leg warmers and use them as boot toppers, as shown in the company's photo.  I feel like these grey warmers with the buttons are a little big and get a little floppy/bunchy/I don't know what word I need but they are a little big and don't fit me as snugly as the model in the photo. That said-- I'm still grateful for a SUPER affordable option that is cute and goes with so many outfits."
4.0,Nice set. I always get compliments when I wear these cute bracelets.
4.0,Arrived on time. It is very cute. My daughter looked nice in it. Would've given it five stars but one of the flowers fell off during the party.
4.0,Comfortable and easy care!
4.0,It’s not a bad cardigan just not what i expected. It’s not as long as photo it’s short. This is a very thin material dimensions might be off
4.0,"The material is very soft, but very sheer. Although I intended to use it as a summer dress, the sheerness is more appropriate for pajamas."
4.0,The wallet looks great.  Pockets are small.  Over all good product
4.0,"As stated, arrived in good time. Quite pretty, though slightly longer than I expected. That is not the sellers fault though, that's just my measuring skills lacking!"
4.0,"i bought this dress in the F14 Geometric color. When it arrived it was packaged beautifully, i was kind of shocked when i actually took the dress out, it felt like plastic and was shiny, it was cotton amd spandex, which i did'nt see in the product review while purchasing it. At first i thought it kind of  looked cheap, but i tried it on and it was lovely on,, the skirt was full, really gorgeous with a petticoat underneath!!. It is a beautiful pattern and is a fun dress, and doesnt look cheap at all when its on. So i am going to.keep it as ibreally love it now, its hanging on the door of my closet in my view right now, in waiting for its debut wear in 2 weeks to my friends wedding.....theme is Grease the Movie!! Happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Nice quality , well made shirt ,  also  love the color,  but it is way too small ,  I order 2 sizes up and it's still too small"
4.0,"Arrived quickly, all settings in tact.  Costume jewelry, but this necklace came looking better tan pictured.  Happy with."
4.0,Comfortable to wear. My husband has a large hand so it is a little awkward to get on. But it is easy to fasten.
4.0,Great shirt just ran a little small.
4.0,"i gave these in a favor box to the boys at my daughters Bday party, they were a big hit."
4.0,This item went from fitting perfectly to looking like a doll dress after one wash in cold water and dry on low heat. It's too bad because it was super cute.
4.0,Product was on time and exactly as described. Well made and I prefer items made in the United States.
4.0,Loved the pattern
4.0,Lightweight oh so comfortable!!
4.0,Love this dress! So cute and flattering! I am pretty busty and this fit my girls in it just fine! The belt doesn’t want to stay in place but nothing a couple of safety pins can’t fix.
4.0,"So glad I bought this... In 3 different colors :) Great fit, soft fabric. Lost one star for the finishing seam on the inside wrap: could be better."
4.0,Great for my Halloween costume.
4.0,"Not really a strong compression tank top, but it is functional as an tanktop to wear under shirts to make them fall smoother across you torso. I'm a bartender and I wear these under my Tshirts so they don't bunch. Runs a little shorter than expected. I'm 5'8 and 205bls. I ordered the XL. I would of put 5 stars if the length was longer."
4.0,very cute for my halloween costume but probably won’t wear again
4.0,"I had this product for almost a month now and it definitely does what it's supposed to do. You can use it even when you're not doing much exercising, but best when you do exercise for better results."
4.0,"These are exactly what I wanted. Nice quality. Shipping took forever, though, beginning in CA, taking a vacation in NH (!) then to me in MO."
4.0,Good cardigan for over tank tops.
4.0,Nice quality lined front and back. Made for women larger than b/c cup. Cupsvqetevalso oddly sewn. Sad because it was so very cute! Fit well otherwise. 5'8&quot; 170 ordered xxxl
4.0,"Great for the pool or the beach! Love this hat's color and style. Great benefit is the notch in the back to allow for pony tail.  Only negative and why I only gave 4 stars, is that it is not fold-able to better fit in suit case."
4.0,Wish they were real leather but I do like the boots and the color is great. They still look pretty good for not being real leather.
4.0,Didn't like that they were just thrown in with a huge package because I almost threw them out
4.0,"Nice light weight cotton socks with an eyelet ruffle. Great for summer or late spring. They come in three colors, white, baby pink, and baby blue."
4.0,My daughter wears a 7/8 but the Large 12/14 fits her. These really run small.
4.0,"I love the top and the cardigan, they are very form-fitting and look great and very comfy.<br />The shorts come up super high and that's cool if you like them that way but they do come up to your ribcage.<br />Kind of have to roll them down 3 times to be at my hips. Will probably sew them later.<br />Not a big deal but be advised the shorts come up very high"
4.0,Material is nice and soft - is not see-through sleeves are perfect length and so isn’t the length of the dress
4.0,"I think these are a good value for the money.  They are made in China where sizes generally run pretty true, but these really run small in my opinion.  I am 6 foot and 190 pounds and I originally ordered XL but had to send that back for XXL.  In shorts I generally wear large...so that's two sizes larger.  The legs run very short...shorter than I prefer.  With cycling ""underwear"" rather than ""shorts"" that is often the case, but these are even shorter than expected.  I generally don't wear them as underwear...most riders don't...which is why they accent most ""underwear"" with decorative lines and logos so they can be worn alone.  People that ride are into whatever is most comfortable and cool in the summertime.  Usually that means you don't wear anything under your shorts...your just asking for things to rub you the wrong way!  These are made of borderline see thru mesh, so know your comfort level if you are going to ride with them alone.  You wont be flashing anyone...but still.  Anyway, these are both cool and comfortable as long as you don't mind short shorts."
4.0,All three necklaces are the same size.  Good quality though.
4.0,"Good for the price. Possibly too thin/transparent for work, depending on how casual your office is."
4.0,The quality is to cost. I wish it stayed compressed longer.
4.0,"I love these masks. I have a big head, I got the smaller size, and it just fits. I wear it every day for work, and it works well. Only negative is that it bleeds color onto the collar of my shirt. Even after multiple washings, it still bleeds. Since I wear white shirts, it’s very noticeable, but I bleach the shirts, so not a problem. The bleeding has been getting less, so maybe after 10 washings, it will stop."
4.0,"My son has sensory processing disorder, this shirt works for compression, but after a period of time he finds it itchy. It does not make it through an entire school day."
4.0,This product was amazing quality however they only had one size available and sadly did not fit but a great onesie regardless.
4.0,Havent worn it yet but it looks beautiful
4.0,The bottoms flare out waay too much.  But they arrived fast and fit nice. But it just threw the look I was going for off.
4.0,Wonderful..on time. Great item
4.0,"They are super big so work for bigger faces! It is a very thin material and comes with 5 masks. My bf was able to use them and they are hilarious, he always gets comments on them."
4.0,The chain was detached on arrival //  I was able to correct // Great for the price.
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress, I have to have it altered up top because I don't fill out the top but it fits perfevtly everywhere else. The fabric feels amazing I can't wait to wear it to my event."
4.0,"I like the fit and feel except at 5’6” they are short on me. I wear jeans inseam 32-33”, they are 3-4 inches above ankles:( and loose on my lower calf:("
4.0,"Hat looks like picture & is nice size as described. It is nice, but it lacks pizazz."
4.0,I replaced the band straight away with a nice steel button release band now I rate it 5 stars..<br />The orange dial works well with my HD attire.
4.0,The Dress is definitely on the thiner side it's definitely see throw. The dress is very lose fitting size is pretty stop on.
4.0,"I’m in love with this wheat chain bracelet! I’ve worn it every day since I received it (almost 6 months now) and am happy that it is so sturdy yet comfortable and light. I prefer it’s spherical catch to Pandora’s version, and it holds all of my charms well. I would give it 5 stars if it had threaded bits at the ends to keep charms from sliding off when open."
4.0,Runs a little larger than expected.  Washes nicely.  But the fabric is rather thin.  Not the best quality fabric.  But okay for the price.
4.0,Love the picture but the case is slippery to hold.
4.0,necklace is not top quality. bought another  necklace  and it looks beautiful
4.0,"Love that I've never seen anything like these, but they do need adjusting throughout the day so they are even on both sides (they can slide back and forth on year ear)."
4.0,bought these to add a little eye candy to my French cuff shirts...It works and adds a personal touch.
4.0,While the watch is attractive it comes a little large and may need to be fitted. The packaging is nicely done and compliments the watch well.
4.0,Nice clear frames they look good for the price.
4.0,fits my head well but comes with a chinstrap that does not look authentic to the movie and makes it look weird so I had to cut it off to make it look more authentic. had some sticky stuff in the forehead part inside of the mask and it stuck to my skin and hair but I got it off. Ears where a bit flimsy so I had to stuff paper towels into them to make them stand up. All in all it is a good mask for the price.
4.0,"Rugged easy to store, would buy again."
4.0,The material is a little softer than I anticipated but the look and quality seem good.
4.0,Great necklace and pendant. was loved as a gift
4.0,Was expecting something a little more crystal looking. It's a metal cut out with a crystal decorated face. Still debating on whether to give it as a Christmas gift or not.
4.0,tried it on fitted right but to warm for summer i will have wait for cooler weather
4.0,Very nice looking and sturdy.
4.0,My fiancé is a blue collar worker so he doesn’t prefer to wear a metal band and these are great! Love the selection and not bad for the price and they seem to be holding up pretty well definitely will buy again
4.0,This top is really cute when I pulled it out of the package I looked at it and I thought how small it looked but then I put it on. It is very cute it has a snap so if you want to show a little bit more décolletage or cleavage you can undo the snap. I will say that this is not a size 20/22 for the size 2XL I’m a dress size 16/18 with a 42D bust and I cannot imagine this fitting anyone larger than a size 18 in my honest opinion.<br /><br />The material is actually very nice and I do like the lace and the spaghetti straps I’m usually very insecure about my arms but I think that this is really cute and would look nice with a skirt or a pair of leggings.<br /><br />If you have a long torso and you don’t like tops that are short this may not be for you it does go right to the top part of my hip which is fine for me but as I mentioned I do not personally feel that the size chart is accurate.<br />I did expect for it to hang on me a little bit more loosely based off of what the size chart said it was and it doesn’t quite look like it does on me as it does on the model but again that’s just because I do have a longer torso.<br /><br />With all that said I just want you to know what to expect there are so many positive things about this top that are good first of all the price is amazing I really like the material it does have stretch to it it’s just a great summer top.<br />I do like it.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.
4.0,The shirt is nicely designed but very unforgiving if you have lovehandles or manboobs.
4.0,"I read the reviews for sizing and ended up with a good fit.  Sometimes clothes are fitted/tailored like the picture shows... sometimes the pictures are pinned back at the waist. This is pinned in the picture. The cardigan just hangs and doesn’t hug the waist,  it you can see that in review photos. I would order again in more colors."
4.0,"I bought a pair of very expensive Zeiss binoculars used from an online auction site. Got a great deal, the only issue was no strap and no covers for the eye pieces. No worries.<br />Amazon to the rescue!<br />This is a very nice little strap for the price. Neoprene is decent quality and thickness. Strap is good. The clips are pretty cheap and of course it’s made in China 🇨🇳.<br />But hey, for $8?<br />C’mon<br />I recommend<br />Thanks for reading"
4.0,"I ordered a large red pair and usually wear a small medium (usually size 8 petite womens). Definitely size up! Satisfied with this item, quality is about what you'd expect and color is accurate."
4.0,"I am 6'-2"" and am always disappointed if I cannot get a tall size. This pull over is too short on me. I wear a XLT typically. I wear a 17.5"" neck with a 36"" long sleeve shirt. It will work OK as a pullover for warm-ups."
4.0,"Cool look , no problems"
4.0,Not sure if this is the real deal since it fell apart 5 minutes after wearing it! Such a disappointment as it was a gift. Buyer beware…
4.0,This backpack is super cute for everyday use
4.0,"The only reason I’m giving these 4 stars is because one of them came with a hole on it, other than that my daughter loved them"
4.0,"Love the dress, but not the fabric I imagined. It’s not the same stretchy loose material as a maxi dress it has less give. I would have chosen one size bigger to fit my hips better."
4.0,"nice glasses for the price my only complaint is the nose piece keeps coming off or j would give 5 stars i am going to glue it on they r very dark so great for mid day rides , if you are looking for glasses to ride early morning not the ones for you"
4.0,Kind of thin and smelly right out of the box. But eventually that goes away and these fit over my head fine. Will be good for use this winter. Material is thin but that is good for breathing so I don't sweat a lot.<br /><br />I'd order again if needed. Good for the price and Heald upokin the wash. But I don't think I'd do that to often.
4.0,Went with the suggestion for a larger size and it was too big so ordered the next size down and so far perfect but quality is concerning.
4.0,I am wearing them right now
4.0,Great cardigan dresses up jean outfits
4.0,"Great hat, just a tad tight--though I have a fairly big head!"
4.0,Nice quality 👌 Pictured is my 12yr old wearing them.
4.0,"I'm in between a medium and large in bottoms, or size 8/10, so I got a large to be safe. They are a little big especially in the tummy area but they still work. They are comfy, good quality material and don't wrinkle, aren't see-through at all, and they aren't too short."
4.0,"Ugh.  Well, where to begin. A lot of these bags, including these particular sling bags, are part of the Chinese market knock-offs.  My particular problem is the male to female connector of the strap are of different designs.  Clearly, the male connector belongs to a different bag.  In the decades I've been alive on this planet, that's the first time I've ever had a problem like this. I asked the seller to correct, and to be fair I'm awaiting a reply.  But, that's just...weird.  These bags must sit on a mass production line, and someone just forgot to put the right connector onto the bag.  What you get is this:  a frustrated customer.  Other have made comments that these bags are small, and they all must come from the same place far away, that is, notice how ALL these bag types appear the same?  I should have known from the price this wasn't going to work. QC obviously is lacking.  I hope these good to great reviews aren't blitz's from the seller.  I wasn't expecting Hazard Plan B bags, but straps that don't fit...that's pretty telling.  In short: you get what you pay for. Buyer beware.<br />UPDATE:  SELLER PROPMTLY SENT A REPLACMENT TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  SELLER FIXED THIS EXTREMELY QUICKLY, WHICH IS APPRECIATED."
4.0,"You can see straight through this skirt. I had to buy a slip to wear under it. The colors are beautiful, quality is mediocre. Much longer than expected. I ordered an XL I’m a size 12 jeans. I could have went with an XXL. Waist was kind of small."
4.0,"It's okay; decent quality. It doesnt entirely match the one shown in the picture or on the tv show, but it gets the job done."
4.0,It is real nice and cute.  Looks just like my nieceses dog.  She loves it.
4.0,"Based on the reviews, I ordered 1 size up.  Big mistake for me, they were way too big.  Unfortunately I had to return - will order a size smaller and see how they work.  That being said, the cargo shorts were lightweight and had plenty of pockets.  I took away 1 star because they did not come with the belt shown in the photos."
4.0,I have hips and a small waist so I order slightly larger so it would fit the way I wanted it to. The belt doesn't fit but that's to be expected with these sizes.
4.0,At first I didn't think it was going to work.  Then I realized that I needed to adjust it by pulling it down further in the front.  It's very good at blocking sun that's coming right at you.  And all you have to do is tilt your head a little bit to the left or a little bit to the right to compensate for direct sunlight coming from an angle.  It fits very well on my sunglasses.  Just make sure that you pull it down far enough in the front to cover the space between the visor and your glasses.
4.0,I washed & dried it a few times. Fits better.
4.0,Runs a little large. I ordered small even though I wear medium and it was still big. I am 5'5 and weigh 150 pounds.
4.0,Got this earrings. They are beautiful.  They didn't come with backings.  I was in a hurry getting dress and didn't put backing on them.  Within a half day one earring was gone.  Add the backing.
4.0,Super cute but runs small. Order a size up.
4.0,It’s beautiful and I love wearing it. I wish the USN was silver like our color devices.
4.0,"Great earrings. As other reviewers have stated, they are rather large. The shipping came extremely late, and when I contacted the seller I found out that USPS had sent them back. They came in cute packaging, and I've managed to make my friends jealous of me for having them. I wouldn't recommend buying them for young/petite persons, as they are still rather large. I posted a photo of them next to a quarter for comparison."
4.0,I measured my hand the same way as described in the picture and the XL size was too small so I returned and reordered the XXL size and they still are alittle snug but thinking they will fit better the more I wear them. The lining is nice and they are really soft and they work when texting!
4.0,Ive been using the under garment products for years. Only reason I didn't give them five stars is there stitching is not up to par. My wife re sows the factory stitching after about six months of use. That being said I will continue to buy them.
4.0,A little shorter than I expected but still worked for my costume
4.0,I really like this hoodie; the only two drawbacks is it does run just a tad small and the quality is good but just don't be to rough on it overall.
4.0,145lbs 5’3”.  Went off the reviews and bought the large. I was swimming in it. There was a good 5” extra fabric in the waste. I then bought the small since the large was so big. Slightly snug but there was a hole in the pocket that made the vest pertrude out. I liked the material. Almost water resistant like. Bought it to wear over scrubs all day. After returning it twice I’ll eventually try a third time but go for the true medium.
4.0,"great fit, but a little big. I hope they shrink up a little when washed. They re longer than normal &#34;wife beaters&#34;and almost come to my knees."
4.0,"Socks work as expected. The length is about mid calf. Some are more stretchy than others, which is somewhat expected with the different designs. The designs made though weaving of the material.<br /><br />The packaging gave a nice experience and was a well designed (the actual graphics on the box) one-piece cardboard box with lid. Once you open it, there is a tissue paper layer covering all the socks that look cute arranged in tight spirals."
4.0,many compliments<br />great for work or play
4.0,Love but could have used a size up. Very pretty.
4.0,"Little expensive, but great pair of compression socks that don't shrink or have problems after wash/dry each time!<br />Recommend to nurses!!!"
4.0,The jewelry delivered at a very reasonable time considering it came from China.  It was packaged in a red box and it came with a little mesh carrying pouch. The pearls are much bigger than expected.  It looks to be a very sturdy and nice necklace and earring set.  I am petite so the earrings are a bit too big and long for me.  I will regift it to a friend.  The necklace is very nice and the pendant is a very nice size.  It isn't too big or too small.  The chain also seems to be very strong and well made for 18k gold plated.  I would recommend this jewelry set.  I received this set at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,Fits pretty true to size. Not tight. It don't look like the same as pictured. Total diffrent than what I ordered.i do like it though. Just it's not like the picture I ordered.
4.0,The bracelet is beautiful. Keep in mind that it is a bit large and may need to be taken in. The clasp isn't always easy to use in order to get the bracelet on. Our daughter loves the colors and the way it looks and is very happy with it.
4.0,Smaller than expected. Super cute!
4.0,"Simple stated bracelet as described. The only downfall is that I have a small wrist, and this metal is really hard to bend to conform to my wrist size."
4.0,Was bought as gift but they seem to be of high quality.
4.0,Light weight and looks good but it runs a little small.
4.0,I was expecting the darker university red and the shirt was the bright gym red.
4.0,"Liked this very much, fit was true to size, thickness was unbelievable and an absolutely great value for the money spent."
4.0,"Overall, it was cute. My biggest issue is that on a windy day, you could end up pulling a Marilyn Monroe. For chilling around house or a casual non-windy day, it is great. Not really for business or if there is any wind..."
4.0,Wore these outside on a hot day around mosquitoes. Not 100% mosquito proof as that's not what this is for but they offer a little bit of protection. The material is pretty thin compared to other compression pants that I've purchased (from Ross and Target). I know these are thin because they aren't really strong enough to keep your junk down and invisible. I wear shorts over them anyways so whatever.
4.0,My daughter has a ton of fun and enjoys these boots immensely.  They're great for puddle jumping! They are also scuffed easily and EVERY time she wears then I hear from my mother in law how I can just use a sharpie to fix it or that she needs new ones
4.0,good watch except when its a little dark its hard to tell the time because the white tips on the hands blend in with the day/date area
4.0,"good fit, nice material"
4.0,"It's a little smaller than expected, but still fits great, and it's comfortable as well. Good for the price, surely."
4.0,I bought two pairs of these for gifts and I really liked them especially for the price unfortunately both pairs have since broken
4.0,"I buy one of these shirts once a year, my family and I vacation a lot, they fit and work exactly as described, they only last about a year and they get super stretched out and drag in the water needing replacing but my expectations are reasonable. I would still recommend this shirt and plan on continuing to buy them annually."
4.0,Love the dress it’s as picture but I wld order it one size bigger if your kinda big in the stomach and gut area.
4.0,"Bought these for my mother, who has a very small foot. She loves wearing them and gets compliments all the time!"
4.0,wonderful !
4.0,"it was fine.  a little tacky. the front flap felt weird. overall, it got the job done"
4.0,"Solid made, looks great"
4.0,"Cute ring, don't really see the skulls and runs big"
4.0,"The head fit fine, the jacket was a bit small."
4.0,Pretty much what you see in the pic.
4.0,Very comfortable waist band let's them slide down
4.0,"These were great. I wasn’t too much a fan of the colors once I had them on, but that’s a personal thing.  Felt they ran a bit small but overall really great (I bought another color I liked them so much)"
4.0,Just what I was looking for.  However the brass color wears off and you are left with silver coloring. Overall though I am happy with the product.
4.0,The hole for the head was a little snug to get on.
4.0,Finish is great! Slightly heavy but very nice
4.0,I like the Design and the price was right---------
4.0,"It’s a cute print and style. The fabric is very light and thin, so care with undergarments is needed depending on age and fit. Looks very pretty on, fits about right.  It’s not the highest quality construction, so hard to say if it’s a good value because there’s no list price at time of this review. I wouldn’t recommend paying more than a comparable Carter’s or Osh Kosh at a big box store."
4.0,No problems with this item.
4.0,"The picture showed the color a bit more intense than it really was. Also, the shirts with the ties seem to be slightly tighter at the bottom. That being said, this is a wonderful shirt!"
4.0,Great quality and picture.
4.0,"Ordered this dress for summer, and the print and back is flattering and fun, but there is a lot of excess fabric around the middle. If you tie the back tighter it makes it tighter around the bust but still very large and bunchy in the waist.<br />Recommend ordering a size smaller but still a nice dress might be able to accessorize with a belt"
4.0,Love this watch its just like the f91
4.0,I thought they were for pierced ears.  But other than that they were alright.
4.0,"These are nice gloves. The skeleton detailing is fine. They arent very heavy, but fit really well. I'd buy again as a gift."
4.0,Nice thick t shirt material. Very comfortable. Just wish the stripes in mine were lined up a little better. Overall very happy with it.
4.0,Should have gone with the large.
4.0,"Very cute! It arrived 2 days before it was suppose to. I love the 2 different ways to wear it! It looks JUST like the picture. However, the moment I took it out of the box it felt like it was cheaply made. Its definitely not worth 30 and some odd dollars. Besides the type of material & price, I'm happy with it. Will write another review after a little while of using it!"
4.0,Very nice and came on time
4.0,Across the back of the dress was way to wide to fit on shoulders...
4.0,it was too small. the size run small
4.0,Really like styles fit inconsistent
4.0,"The quality of this top is nice - it's very soft and drape-y rayon blend, and the color (dusty rose) is pretty true to the picture.  Based on the reviews I read, I decided to order a size S despite normally wearing a size M in tops.  Even with a small, it's a bit too loose around the bust (I am 5'7&#34;, 128 lbs, 36B for reference).  I'm debating about returning it, but I'll probably keep it, since I bought it to wear over leggings and tops of this length aren't easy to come by (I'm 51, and even though I'm fit, age and genetics aren't on my side when it comes to wearing pants/leggings where my butt is visible...IYKWIM)."
4.0,Very nice thick zip up hoodie.<br />Graphic detail outstanding.<br />This company's sizing is usually 1 to 2 sizes smaller than average so take that into consideration when purchasing.
4.0,"This cute little guy is perfect for any baby. The black and white pattern makes it an easy switch between use for boys or girls, so there you can keep it around if you have the desire to have multiple kids or if you want to second hand gift it to a friend. The product is listed as the front: 100% soft cotton  and back is 100% polyester fleece and to machine wash cold. I don't wash my clothes on hot so I can't report if anything bad would happen or not, but just a little shout stain remover works well. Either way, this big is a cute way to add a fashion accessory to your baby's outfit while at the same time saving their neckrolls from all of the drool that seems to come in buckets from their mouths. I think this is a good product overall, my only complaints are that there are only two &#34;snap&#34; sizes (I would really like another &#34;snap&#34; or two for tinier necks) and that it looks like at the tail end of my bib the stitching got caught and it pinched in the bottom of the bib to a curve (but that most likely is just an individual happenstance).<br /><br />I received this product at no charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Four stars only because the quality is not great and the seams tend to have inconsistencies but for this price, you really can't beat it. I got a LARGE and it fit perfect (I am a 34DD) such that I decided to buy one in each color. The support is surprisingly good! Perhaps it's the wide spacing of the straps on the shoulders but I don't have to double-bra during my workouts, which are purely HIIT training with sprinting intervals. Now, if I were running long distances on a treadmill or outside, the no-double-upping theory might be reconsidered but for gym workouts, I think the support is solid."
4.0,Fabric is amazing and the color is rich
4.0,"The sweater itself was cute and the fabric was nice, but I returned it. It was not long enough for me."
4.0,"I bought this dress in blue.  It's an oversized dress so it fits a bit large, but I like it. It allows your body to breathe."
4.0,"I am only giving 4 stars because I am not sure how well it will hold up over time this is my first impression.<br />The purse and wallet are very well packaged I was extremely impressed!<br />They feel pretty well made, the purse was larger than I expected but I can get used to it, the wallet I'm not so sure I like but im going to give it a try. But over all I am very happy with it just out of thr box I think it will hold up really well I'm looking forward to using my purse"
4.0,"Nice jacket.  Mrs. says it runs a bit larger than expected, but this can be a good thing for the colder months."
4.0,"I used this for my coins when I go do laundry, holds up to 20$ in quarters which is pretty neat and the headband is part of my style and reminds me of my childhood."
4.0,Wifey no likey.....
4.0,I wear this hat a lot. My only complaint... the gray bull in the background does not stand out like pictured. Unless you are in the perfect light you can't even see it. :(
4.0,Ordered the soft blue for my husband. The soft blue shade is a nice color. The shirts have been washed worn several times and there’s no shrinkage. Ordered his regular size. They do have a slight wrinkled look more so than some others we have in this brand.
4.0,Super cute top even for my sorta larger chest (38C/36D). I got the Large and the fit is perfect. Not a huge fan of the bottoms. They aren't high waisted (at least not on me...I'm 6' tall and slim) so that's kind of disappointing but the top is great and made it worth the order.
4.0,It was a gift for someone ekse
4.0,"I ordered three dresses.  One was a solid bright pink.  It is perfect for Easter with a sweater and pearls. One said it was black and the skirt had a floral design.  I was not impressed with that one. While the top was black, the skirt was Navy with the floral design.  It just didn't match well.  I gave it away. The third is a gorgious purple with a floral print on the skirt. I absolutely LOVE it! I have worn it to dinner as well as to church.  It fits perfectly! I have had many compliments on it."
4.0,Unless you have a tiny head this is not for an adult lol. I actually bought this for my 9 year old daughter's costume. It fit her fine but it was super tight on me. I couldn't couldn't hear with it on. Had a small scuff on it when I got it but nothing major. The stitches were faded so I used some white out on the stitches it brightened it up perfectly. Back of it had a slit about 4 or 5 inches for hair. I actually braided her hair to lay flat in it. Worked fine but won't hold a pony tail unless you adjust it accordingly. Also I suggest maybe cutting some of the chin strap and adding some elastic band for comfort.
4.0,Love the overall shoes it just is a bit bigger then i thought and i went down a size too
4.0,Adequate for what they are.
4.0,"This dress is ok for the price. There is another dress sold on Amazon that looks exactly the same, but is about $7 more expensive. That dress is much better quality than this dress and worth the few extra dollars. This dress is really short and the material doesn't feel as soft. Again, this one is ok, it's just not as nice."
4.0,"This is a super cute cami with a nice lace accent. PROS: It's delicate and lightweight, but sturdy enough to throw in the washer. It is a bit roomy, which I prefer. CONS: This top is see-through so you will have to wear another cami underneath. My major issue is that the top is too short for me... I am 5'8"" and I prefer my tops to be at my hip level. This is about 2-3 inches too short for me, which is a no go. I ended up giving it to my mother who is 5'1"" and it worked nicely for her."
4.0,"Way too big for our baby, but she has a smaller head for her age. Adorable hat, hoping it fits next winter."
4.0,"I love these sleek, minimalist like wallets. Enough pockets for my 6–10 cards any given day, and some cash and loose coins. I only gave 4 stars because bought a gray one this second time around to replace my dark yellow one. It came already torn inside the pocket. I’m sure was just a defect though, because my first dark yellow one came in pristine condition. I’ll just return and buy another one in near future. Really awesome if you want something small but still chic or even functional."
4.0,"Earrings themselves are very nice, but the backings seem way too tiny. Besides that, I wear these during swim practice day and even during swim meets, and they look exactly the same as I bought them. I'd recommend them, though I'd keep some backings handy in case you lose the tiny ones these come with."
4.0,It's a funny tool for dnd night. Its plastic is super cheap. But it functions well and for its size has a good sound output.
4.0,"This is a pretty bracelet and I love the concept!  However, the jump rings holding the playbill charms on the bracelet are too thin for the weight of the charm.  This causes the charm to come off almost immediately, which is what happened to me.  I replaced all the jump rings with sturdier ones and that seems to have done the trick."
4.0,"Overall I am happy with this wrap, it could be<br />a little larger but it does what is neede."
4.0,I used these for micro four thirds prime lenses and they work good but the strings fall out eventually. For my purpose I don't need the strings. These can be used for a lot of small items you want protected from scratches and marks.
4.0,I purchased this hat because I was tired of having my hair against my neck when working out or hiking. It seems to get the job done as I am able to put my hair in a high bun while wearing it. It is adjustable as well which I appreciate.
4.0,"These glasses are hot, however they didn't work for my narrow face.  So I returned them."
4.0,"Very nice comfy socks, but too big for my feet. I wear 6½ shoes-so if your feet are rather small, think again."
4.0,Liked them.  Quality fairly good
4.0,"The face is smaller than expected, even on the wrist of my 10-year old boy. The yellow LED light was not quite bright to see the digits in the dark. Other than those, it worked and served the purpose."
4.0,These are nice sweatshirts. But I have one complaint. TAGS. Just about every other maker is doing away with them. They are ANNOYING. Yes it is a reason to return them.
4.0,Too scretchy.
4.0,I will be buying more clothes from Roswear
4.0,Solid watch for the price. I wear it for outside workouts and even on very hot days it functions well.
4.0,cote
4.0,"I bought one for my wife and I. It is extremely warm so it is great for those below zero days. The furry fleece lining not only helps with maintaining the shape of the hat, but it provides additional warmth right along the hair line. It does stretch, so don't worry about it being too small or tight. Would definitely buy again, I just wish they had more color options."
4.0,"Use the measuring advice to get a perfect size. The gloves are great for warmth! The touchscreen feature is laughable at best. If you're shoveling or digging (larger tools and grips), they work fine; however, if you use smaller hand-held tools, the layer inside will make it difficult for you to hold on to them (like a hammer or saw). Overall- yes, for warmth, but I would not recommend it for work or rely on them to use your electronic devices."
4.0,"Very short and sexy, also a great long top to wear over yoga pants or leggings."
4.0,It is a lil hard to use at timei already reviewed this.
4.0,If you are full breasted this bra is not for you. But it is well made and I love the options they gave for the back
4.0,"This was a gift for both my husband and father, both thought it was a great gift! My dad loves that he can wear it while jogging and gardening, and still get calls and listen to music. The speakers can be a tiny bit bulky, and the hat fits pretty large so this would be ideal for someone with a larger head."
4.0,Love the way this hat looks...great for male or female.
4.0,"Absolutely love this dress!  The only thing I don't love is that it's very see through, so I have to wear something under it. Other than that, for a perfect."
4.0,Good mask. Great volumes and doesn’t fade washing.
4.0,Thin but gets the job done
4.0,"arrived fast, a little smaller than i expectex but good"
4.0,"It's a cozy hoodie, I only took a star off because the stitching isn't the best in a few places: the fabric is bunched at a few seams and a section of the elastic at the bottom didn't make it into the machine so it's open. It looks better than your typical hoodie because of the cowl neck and skinny arms. Order a size up as these do run small."
4.0,"The only thing I don't likes the magnetic buttons. If I hook them right no prob ,but as soon as I pick up by the handle and It starts to drop I know I didn't hook them right. The quality of the product is 5 star.<br />Have had many complements."
4.0,7 year old wanted starry night socks. These were the smallest I could find. They do not look very big but there also may be significant give that I am not seeing. Child is thrilled with selection.
4.0,Love it!!! Received the item pretty fast and is a conversation piece with my friends!!! Highly recommended!!! Buy it and enjoy
4.0,It fits well and is warm.  It's well made.  Totally worth it.
4.0,"I love my new wrist bans. The only negative this I have to say is that every now and again if the watch is to tight then it does pop out of the whole. Personally I have to use the last hole, so the excess is quit a bit, but I also think that it helps hold it in place better."
4.0,"Delivered as pictured, however, keep in mind this is definitely a crop top. In the photo it looks like it might come down to your belly button, but in real life, it stops at the ribs. Overall, loved the quality but just a bit shorter than I expected."
4.0,My 10.75 inch (27.3 cm) feet just fit into the USA 11-12 with my heel at the back edge of the sole. Extra cushioning in the sole is nice. Comfortable to wear around the house.
4.0,"Watch is very attractive. Directions were not that good - you need to set watch in opposite directions than from what instructions say.  It is a huge watch, though, very thick (high?).  It's easy to smack it on counters, doors, etc.  But still, it's very nice looking."
4.0,"At last a sock that I can pull up without extreme, exhausting effort. My only issue is that they are very long ---I could pull them over my knees but instead fold down them down."
4.0,Nice slippers but run very small had to get a 12cto fit my husband & he wears 91/2.
4.0,It is cute and I do like the soft fabric. Its runs rather small in the bust. The only reason I didn't give five stars is that it has pockets in the skirt and one is set significantly higher than the other. Hoping it wont be noticeable. Otherwise no complaints
4.0,"The color is more beautiful in person than the picture shows but unfortunately it is a slim fit with thin, stretch, clingy material so it shows EVERYTHING…but I will say the shape is flattering. I am returning and buying a larger size to hopefully allow for less cling to my trouble areas."
4.0,Seemed more leather-like than real leather. Beyond that it was practical and retro-styled. Happy with it.
4.0,"This is a really cute hat. The only thing is, where the line is on the bill it folds in half. It is a little flimsy. Other than that it is a great hat. I am not sure I would have bought it if I knew it folded like this."
4.0,"Very flattering however, it does run on the smaller side."
4.0,"They're different but I'll have to get something to glue to the bottom because they're slippery to walk on.  Otherwise, good deal!!"
4.0,It’s kind of uncomfortable cause of the sequins hurting my skin but nevertheless it’s so cute
4.0,"The problem with online shopping is that you can't be sure what you are getting until you see it in your hands, no matter how detailed the description that they give is. The ring is not what I imagined but still nice. The setting is beautifully made, fairly heavy and has a substantial amount of gold. The metal is smooth and shiny. I bought a tiny .27 carat diamond to go with it, and I feel that the setting kind of overwhelms the diamond. The ring is still pretty but if I were shopping at jewelry store, I might choose a different setting or a bigger diamond. But there is just no way you can get this kind of price from a jewelry store. Overall, I am quite satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,Pretty shoe for the price. I did received  the wrong color but decided to keep them anyway. The suede is pretty thin so I doubt they will last more than a season.
4.0,"Love the print and style of this bathing suit but it was very small. I wear an XL in just about any top and bathing suit and I could barely get this on. Seems to be good quality, just need a bigger size or two!"
4.0,"The leather disconnects from the frame around the lens too easily, but an unnoticably small dot of hot melt glue has fixed that issue. I'm assuming that was why it was returned as have I have not found any other issues with it. I used to have a pair of glasses like this when I was a kid in the 80's and I really missed being able to drive and attend desert festivals without the sun blinding me through the side of my usual sunglasses glasses."
4.0,"This hat is a little small for my head, so I gave it to my wife. It seems to fit her very well. In the package, it comes with buttons that can be used to replace ones missing on other articles of clothing. And an adult face mask is also included. Kudos!<br /><br />Only a small negative. The hat is not quite perfectly symmetrical when viewed straight on. The stiching just ever so slightly leans the front bill. It's minor and probably won't be noticed by most people. I would still say this hat is a good value."
4.0,The dress is very flowy so I got a size lower than usual. It fits nicely and the color is as expected. My only complaint is that the material pilled from my car seatbelt rubbing against it the first time I wore the dress. It's not super noticeable so I'll probably keep wearing it.
4.0,"The dress is cute, love the colors! BUT - it’s not very comfortable and the material is not the same as the more stretchy styles which I was hoping for. Overall the sizing is off too,it runs small. I wanted to keep and like but ultimately I ended up returning it for the bad fit."
4.0,They worked perfectly for what I needed them for thank you
4.0,These have really come in handy.  I have had a couple situations where there wasn't enough room to get a flashlight in the space if my hands are there at the same time and these give enough light to see.  They are easy to put on and not uncomfortable to where.  The only down side is when you have to change the battery you have to take out a screw....not a big deal but a hassle vs just slide off a cover.  I would see these being useful to many and would recommend them if you have the need.
4.0,"Out the packaging I thought the bag looked the part, it was cute yet functional.<br />I haven’t taken it out for a spin yet, I’ll do additional grocery shopping for a few items and see how it stacks up. I like it though, hoping it’s a good purchase after I put it to the test with milk, eggs, meats, fruits, veggies, etc."
4.0,Softness lightweight
4.0,"Arrived quickly and very sparkling. Not too big to be gawdy, just right size to add some sparkle."
4.0,as everyone else said the color is nothing like in the picture. Much more muted the black is actually grey. There are no vibrant colors in this top. I still like it love the fit but i was actually shocked when I saw the difference in the colors from the picture to the real thing. Don't know if it's worth the price.
4.0,Good sound quality.
4.0,"This is teaching me flag language. And they do work, I've used several and am flying 6 now!"
4.0,"I love this dress. The color especially.<br />It fits well, and hugs my body like a glove without making me look like a sausage.<br />Only reason I took a star off is that the seam under the boob area isn't reinforced well and opened a bit when I put my boobs in the first time.<br />I whipped out my serger and fixed it and voila good as new ^_^"
4.0,Great little shoe but way too small for a 15 month old.
4.0,I love the bag but it did have a funky smell when it first arrived.  Usually a true leather purse has an odor of well leather - this did not.  Still not sure if it is real leather but I like it anyway.
4.0,I love these dresses.  They are more cotton than most.  Very good material & great quality. I have two & I love them.
4.0,Some pairs fit differently???
4.0,"The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is that the ties slip and don’t stay up. Other than that, I love the dress. You can use a safety pin to hold it up. Will probably order another"
4.0,"This fit awesome and is an adorable dress. However, it wrinkles very easily!"
4.0,"This soundbot could have been so cool, but it is too small for my head. I cannot wear it. Sadly, this only comes in OS (one size).<br /><br />Update: My wife gladly owns this. She loves it so much better than a pair of earbuds. She uses it mainly to listen to podcasts."
4.0,Worked great for our Audrey Hepburn dinner!
4.0,"just as advertised and pictured, the bottle opener looks good and works good"
4.0,"These are lovely earrings, but so small it is hard to see that the stones are heart shaped."
4.0,"This is a pretty piece, well worth the price, and the dealer was very helpful."
4.0,"It’s a natural fur, the color of my is more to gray than gold, but it’s pretty. It’s well done and good quality. The only concern is that it lacks of density. Some parts of the fur is cut so it doesn’t have as much fur as described in the picture."
4.0,"This hoodie is very thick, soft, and comfortable! No problems with the zipper either! I ordered a large and it fits more like a medium, so definitely size up 1 or 2 sizes if you want that oversized, comfy fit!"
4.0,"These earrings were a gift for my wife before a trip.  She brought them with her and liked how they complimented a variety of outfits.  She loves the quality of swarovski and these earrings did not disappoint in that category.  She has super sensitive ears though and found that she was able to wear them for several hours at a time but by dinner time she was ready to take them out.  The design of the earrings makes them not as easy to get in as other similar styled earrings, however, the upside to that is that they stay in well.  They come with small clear stoppers which are helpful but due to the design of the earrings may not be entirely necessary...they are not likely to work themselves out of the ear like other hanging earrings.  I received this item at a discount for my honest review"
4.0,"This apron is very light weight. A bit flimsy but it didn’t seem to be an issue. In fact, it’s a little easier to move in than a sturdier one I have, and I don’t get as hot wearing it. We didn’t have any problem with it coming loose while wearing it. The clips that hold the rings for hanging bottles are plastic and don’t look like they would hold up for long if your bottles have any weight to them."
4.0,Bought this for my daughter’s 21st birthday. It is a beautiful and well made. The banner is ok but once pressed served its purpose. Would recommend.
4.0,Tee shirt is a bit thin.. But overall pretty cool🤓 And delivery was very quick. Thanks
4.0,It’s was a really nice product for the price. Looked almost like a Elsa dress off a body lol but very sexy on. Just can’t have a belly
4.0,"The dress is pretty, but in the picture looks prettier. Size up when you get it"
4.0,These are nice and soft socks for my AFO’s wearing son. But wish they wouldn’t be so costly since we need lots of pairs…
4.0,Es muy linda la tela y el estampado es tal como se ve.
4.0,A little to tight scraped your head putting it on and off.
4.0,Love the earring. The ball on the end was too small to screw on so I had to use a larger one of my own. Otherwise it's very nice and sparkly.
4.0,While I really liked this dress...it felt like a petite size and I ordered XL. I had to constantly pull it down as the waistline was too high and a little uncomfortable for me. The fabric is nice and I could wear it without a slip.
4.0,It's a good shirt. That's all.
4.0,I like that they are light and easy to use.
4.0,I am 5'7&#34; and wear a size 16. This is cute and long enough to cover rear in leggings. I like it.<br /><br />Feels kind of &#34;rough&#34; not bad just can tell it's not premium cotton so if you are looking for a Lularoe &#34;Randy&#34; Knock off this probably isn't it. Feels more like standard cotton tee shirt but still super cute and may be softer with washing.
4.0,Quality is not the greatest but fair for the price.  Material wrinkles easily.
4.0,This fits as stated but the fabric is not as expected.
4.0,Came exactly as pictured. I wouldn’t consider this a “sweatshirt” but rather is a thicker long sleeve shirt if that makes sense. Comfy shirt to lounge in. I would size up if you’re going for more of an oversized look
4.0,"These set is so cute. I purchased the beige in a small. The shorts are a little snug in the waist but not bad. I think over time they'll relax anyway as the elastic stretches. One huge downside is that the beige shows everything through unless you're wearing nude underwear. I started to return them but just couldn't make myself do it because they were so cute. So instead I just ordered a package of nude underwear so that I would have enough. I mean it's not like I'm planning to wear these outside of the house anyway. The shorts have nice deep pockets and a front tie. I love the texture of the material. I think over time with washing it will only get softer. The beige is such a soft, pretty neutral color. I couldn't resist."
4.0,"This is nice costume jewelry. It’s comfortable to wear and I like that it’s soft so it doesn’t hurt if I bang it on a table or desk or something.<br /><br />It’s also adjustable to fit any size. The strings can require some tugging, which is kind of awkward one handed, but the nice part is it doesn’t loosen up through out the day.<br /><br />On close inspection the tiny crystals look like they have the potential to come loose and be lost in the future, but I tend to expect that out of jewelry at this price."
4.0,I like the jacket but thd sleeves are really big.
4.0,Way too small..but would be very cool if fit right.  Pretty sure my wife is going to have a good laugh when I put them on
4.0,"I was sent the wrong size that I ordered, & it was too tight so they refunded my money. I decided since the lace was so soft & the feel of the dress so flowy to change to the sleeved version of this dress. It's a beautiful gown, the color is deep, the cut modest and elegant. Very pleased."
4.0,"The summer cardigan is cute and seems to be well-made, and fit exactly as I expected. However, I ordered WHITE -- I  know I did -- and I received OFF WHITE. I would never have ordered off white because the dress I bought the cardigan to go with, is pure white with a blue print. I don't know what to do but the off-white sweater won't look right with the white dress. I'm disappointed. Probably will return."
4.0,"I bought it for my husband to go with a pair of blue shoes, but it didn't match. It's still a really nice belt and my husband likes it a lot, but this is not blue. I read the reviews and thought the person who described their belt just got a defective one, but I also received a turquoise belt.  I'm sure it's not just the settings on my screen, either. It's not just a discrepancy of light vs dark; this belt is an entirely different color. Still, it's a very nice belt."
4.0,"This is a multi strand set.  The bracelets are banded together with a single metal ring (you can see it in the photos).  The ring isn't welded together so this could easily be removed and you could wear less strands /bracelets if desired.  Total there are 5.  My wrist is 2 inches across and when wearing this it measure 3 inches across.  The beads are all nice to look at and have no ruff edges.  No tarnish marks showed up while wearing.  LOTS of stretch to put these on, again you can see in the photo, how easy it is to put on/take off.  Price point is pretty competitive to local buys of similar style and quality.  Packaging is very cute and would make a lovely gift.  Overall, happy with this set."
4.0,"Purchased for my daughter's 5th birthday as a special dress-up prop for the Birthday Girl! She was very excited that she was made special as the guest of honor and that while she enjoying the party with her friends, she had an extra touch of ""special"" on her day.<br /><br />I would say that this item is best suited for a child aged 7-10 as it is BIG. My daugther is an average sized 5 year old and this was very big on her. Also, the headband is a waste of money, really unattractive and not sure at all the purpose of the headband.<br /><br />Would the description provided a better picture of the headband, I probably would have gone with a nicer robe for the same amount that I spent on this set OR would have bought the robe on it's own for less $$$.<br /><br />A great match to the spa slippers in pink that all of the girls enjoyed. Just wish I would have had better pictures at the end of the day and would not have dealt with a RUDE seller (NOT Amazon). Ugh -- seller really discouraged me from purchasing from them again.<br /><br />Cute robe that suited it's purpose and I know my daughter can get use from future games of dress-up ... headband was a waste."
4.0,"I'll be wearing this dress when the weather gets warm again. It fits me a bit tighter than in the photos, but I am about 15 lbs heavier than normal currently. Hoping by summer it will fit just right."
4.0,"I love the size of the watch face, easy to see. The face isn’t too large.  The red band is a nice, not too loud of a red, and narrower of some I’ve seen. A little more feminine."
4.0,"Love it. I’m 5’7 and 150 Pounds, medium fit well. It hugs the right spots However it looked weird when it arrived. That’s just me tho."
4.0,They work for me at night
4.0,Decent quality and fits correctly.
4.0,They work really well but the straps are small. My eight year old will only be able to use them for a year or two before needing new ones. I imagine they would work great for younger kids.
4.0,buen producto. gracias
4.0,I love the quality of the fabric and the fit  I got a medium and it's a perfect fit.
4.0,"The frame is thing plastic and the logo is a sticker. But, I paid very little for it. If you want something sturdy, go metal with enamel paint."
4.0,"Cute for summer time or beach get always, it is on the thin side which is good for hot weather."
4.0,"Very nice blouse.  One of my favorite.  White is not really white, more off white"
4.0,I expected this shirt as pictured with the folded sleeve cuff and bunched bottom but its just a normal t shirt. I give 4 stars because the person I m gave it to still absolutely loved it.
4.0,It's a good product for what I need its just that the perforations of the holes aren't completely taken off so now I get little round plastic confetti on our floor whenever I use one unless I take the time to individually take them off before each and every use. Just very annoying.
4.0,"I’m not giving four stars as from the front the colors don’t really stack well and it’s hard to see all of them, but for the price it’s a good size and cute. Don’t love the black cord it came on but a cheap good chain fixed that right up."
4.0,"The Charis Allure Women's Elastic Waist Umbrella Skirt in Black Lace is pretty, and can be dressed up or down for many occasions.<br /><br />A good black skirt will take you anywhere.  While this is not the style I prefer, I like to change my image from time to time and I decided to try this as a result.  This is black lace with a loose, sewn in black slip.  On my 5'2"" and 150 pound frame (approximately) this was a bit tight.  I can wear a small in most things, so this surprised me.  However, I felt that the skirt looked good on me.  Please be aware the lace on the outside of the skirt does catch on things, so beware of door locks that stick out and pointy desk items.  For that I took off one star.<br /><br />I wore this at work with a tucked in white dress shirt and this looked good.  I also wore this to a recent Xmas party with a red fitted shirt and this looked great also.  For this time of year this is very versatile and can be put with many different things.  The gold zipper in the back zips well and has a sturdy clasp to hold the zippered part in place.<br /><br />I recommend this-I just feel I would have been better off with a medium. That is probably no fault of the manufacturers. That was just my wishful thinking wanting a small."
4.0,It’s cute but it was tighter than expected returned it and will buy a size up
4.0,"I adore this design and as always love this brand of compression socks they are excellent for nurses, the only downside to these is the designs on them are an overlay of threading so they're adorable but towards the end of the shift when your feet are really swollen they cut into your skin. So when I took them off I had little heart pitting going on down my left calf where my leg swells the most. If you're not prone to swelling and just need the compression thought these are excellent!"
4.0,I love the shirt but the size are smaller they need more bigger size for big guys.but I love it
4.0,"Came with a terrible, terrible odor!  I could not even store in our closet with our clothes! Hung them outside on the porch fan for over a week!  Finally they were odorless!  And they are great little belts. I love them and they seem to be sturdy enough to me. Great versatile colors. Some reviewers said they were cheap and flimsy. I disagree. Can not beat them for the price. Now they are my favourites! One star off for. having to air them to make them usable."
4.0,"got for a Halloween hat, it is snug, and I have a small head,  more a children's fit I think,  but cute and well made"
4.0,I would Go up a size it was a little tight. But besides that I love it!
4.0,"On face value, this dress is very nice. It's not quite perfect as it seem a bit big on the top but it does cinch the waist quite well. It's opaque enough were I don't need to worry about flash photography and it's short enough to look perfect. The front bow adds a very cute aspect to it and the feel of the material is good. Washes well and has gotten a lot of use lately. I'm fairly happy with it."
4.0,These pants would be great if the waistline wasnt so tight :(
4.0,The zippers were a little stuff but work and the jacket is very comfortable really works well with all the rain we get
4.0,Great material! True to size. I ordered a medium because I get worried about Asian sizes. This one I got too big. I should have gotten a small. But still wearing it. Overall great product.
4.0,"I liked the material, it was comfortable and I love the blue color"
4.0,"I purchased this as a  replacement chain swiped and broken by an infant and wanted something shorter. For the money, I feel it is a good value. The chain is delicate and shiny, which is what I wanted. It is a bear to fasten, so don't wait til you are ten minutes late to put this on. It holds a small diamond pendant and I have not taken the necklace off in the week or so I have had it,,even sleeping in it and it is holding up well."
4.0,Runs very big. They are definitely not for playing outside. Very thin & cheap material.
4.0,"Got this for a family member as a Christmas present, she loved it. I just wish it didn't take a month for it to be delivered."
4.0,I like it would be nice if it stated sizes
4.0,"These looked really neat, and although my son loved these shoes and thought they were really comfortable, the edges/piping started fraying and ripping apart within 3 or 4 months. I was really hoping they would last longer than that, like other Geox shoes I’ve gotten in the past."
4.0,"It's super soft fabric on the outside, not as soft but still comfy on the fabric that touches your skin."
4.0,"It was a very nice romper, the end dress back was very flowly. I wish there was a bigger size as it was tight in the thighs, but it was alright."
4.0,"I really like those and will get another pair, it fits me just like i wanted. Gave 4 stars just because instead of receiving black/black as ordered i got grey/black"
4.0,Nice look and fit.  Good  to wear on colder days.
4.0,I love this shoe but it gives me a blister on the back of my foot if I walk more than half a mile in them. Not for city living but works if you don't walk a ton.
4.0,It’s a good thick sweater. Haven’t been cold since I got it. It’s just a little shorte in length than I’d like. I’m 6’ 3” and it’s rides high on the waist. I’d have given 5 stars if they’d make them 2 or 3 inches longer. Overall a tough sweater thatll work great under your coat or over.
4.0,Nice but not for a baby. They fit my almost 3 year old
4.0,"Awesome shirt, but size up one size because it is small."
4.0,"It looks good, feels good. No problems with"
4.0,Tight on my 4. Yr old
4.0,Really like the hat but I have a small head so it is really big on me.  Still wear it.
4.0,Doesn’t look as great as I thought on me
4.0,"They are a bit big, but that is the risk one takes when purchasing shoes online for a 3 year old, right?!?!"
4.0,We really like this !
4.0,Great shirt but the size was too small. I recommend buying one size larger than you think you'll need.
4.0,Got them for my daughter for after soccer  practice she loves them
4.0,Was pleasantly surprised by quality of the dress for price. It is very comfortable and flattering. Perfect casual dress.
4.0,"A little big.  But what can you expect from a beefy-type t?  Otherwise, good, solid colors!"
4.0,"Good product, very useful for my husband's surgery"
4.0,This was a gag gift<br />Way too small for an adults head<br />Bright colors<br />Good quality
4.0,Pretty and practical. I have the matching earrings.
4.0,"I liked the shirt, but as always when you receive items directly from China they are too small. I'm returning the shirt."
4.0,"Great casual dress! I would definitely buy other colors. This dress is longish, so it goes down to about your knees for those of you who want something form fitting but not short"
4.0,"Loved the fit, however after I washed it for the first time it shrunk a little"
4.0,Its a nice quality but a little small.
4.0,"This purse lasted a year and I'm OK with that.  I tend to overload it but the zippers have held up as has the strap.  This is my every-day purse so it's gotten daily use and I'm impressed that it has held up as long as it has considering my tendency to overstuff it.  The purse is still mostly in one piece but the lining pulled loose on the side with the two open pockets on it, the ones where I keep pens.  So I'm buying another and I hope it will hold up as well."
4.0,"There good and comfortable, the only reason for 4 star was the color, not a normal Tan but more like a gold color.  But I do like them"
4.0,"Gorgeous, unique, and striking.  But WATCH OUT!  The material is so filmy it catches, and pulls appear.  The pulls are unsightly and very difficult to straighten out.  Scarf is never the same afterwards.<br />ADVICE:  Handle the delicate silky material gingerly and store it in a safe place."
4.0,helps me see dates on my coins
4.0,"I really love the looks of this band, but I am returning it, because after a week of wearing it, the pin that holds the links together in the piece where it attaches to the fitbit won't stay in.  We even tried replacing the pin with one of the pins from the links we removed sizing it, and it still wouldn't stay.  Very, very disappointed.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The seller of this band sent me two new bands at no cost, with an explanation of what went wrong with the first band, along with an apology.  They even followed up with me to make sure I received the package.  I really do like the looks of the bracelet, it makes the fitbit look like a nice watch instead of a fitness band.  I'm hopeful that the manufacturing correction made makes this bracelet last."
4.0,"The ring is of good quality and arrived very quickly.  The price advertised was absurdly low, but you pay high shipping costs for each item.  Even if several items were shipped in the same envelope, you get charged the high shipping fee for each item.  I would much rather have bought a higher priced item with no shipping fee or a combined fee.<br />Even though I loved the product, the hiding of the true cost seemed a little underhanded.  I knew what the total cost would be when i ordered the rings, but i did decided to order from another company who offered similar rings for a fair price and fair shipping costs."
4.0,"A great piece of clothing, however it should be a little longer."
4.0,Wow these are the best! Don’t wait buy buy buy!
4.0,It is what it says!!! ... love it ... it's delicate and cute
4.0,"Overall this is a pretty nice belt. The buckle is made entirely of metal, most likely aluminum as it is mostly non magnetic with the exception of a small round bit that is magnetic. This is good because I got this belt as a work belt, so this will likely not gather much grinding dust. The quality of the belt itself overall is ok. It probably isn't made of real leather and the ratcheting bit is made of plastic. Most likely the first place this will fail is the plastic in the belt, so if you aim as far back as possible when fitting the belt for the first time you can progressively trim the belt as the tabs break.<br /><br />Edit: Turns out the belt itself was the weekest link. The belt ended up tearing at the base of the ratcheting mechanism. Ot still lasted me a good 2-3 years though so overall I am still happy with the product. The buckle is still going strong 4 years later too"
4.0,"Lovely earrings! Impressed with their looks.<br /><br />My only concern is that they are quite lightweight and a bit flexible because of how thin they are, which makes me think that they could break easily. BUT since they aren't broken yet, I plan to use them as much as I can!<br /><br />Recommended!!"
4.0,"These are pretty awesome.  Would be nice if you could choose the brand of casing you got, but not the end of the world.  Wife did say they are pretty heavy though, but liked them just the same."
4.0,"This is cute.  Definitely not long enough for a dress, but cute with leggings.  Fits as expected according to size chart."
4.0,I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He loves it.
4.0,Excellent quality good price
4.0,"Everything was there and looks good. I am happy with these half face masks. It took a while to get them though, over 1 month."
4.0,"The reason for the four stars is because I see nothing about the wallet relative to RFID ability. However, the wallet itself is slim and fits into my front pocket as intended. I have a custom chain and together they work nice."
4.0,My body type is not like the picture. It isn’t what I expected but still a nice top.
4.0,It was a little longer then it said.
4.0,Very nice. Snug fit. Just as presented.
4.0,"I purchased a size 8, and am a women's size 9, medium width. This shoe fits me well, although I should say that I use an orthotic inside for arch support in place of the memory foam insole that comes with it."
4.0,extra sexy
4.0,"This comes with an included scoop so you can measure per the instructions. I let mine soak overnight and cleaned it the next morning. I did use a toothbrush to get into the cracks, my shoes were clean and looked like new. I am very impressed"
4.0,"This is exactly as pictured and described. It is a very good windbreaker and what little rain I have been in , I stayed dry. I gave this only 4 stars because I wish TNF would make these in retro style with the longer hang and more pockets.  At least one inside pocket would be nice. Other than that it is what one would expect from The North Face"
4.0,Gorgeous & very high quality . Looks like a very expensive piece
4.0,"It's a bright yellow umbrella. It's good in the wind but I don't think it's as good as advertised. It's good for what it is, just a bit overpriced"
4.0,"I got these as a gift and they've just arrived. I haven't opened the package or worn them since they aren't for me, but they look good. You can tell what it is supposed to be."
4.0,"I'm happy with the product,  I use them for golf"
4.0,"I like this dress and for the price it was great.  However the buttons are not functional, so they are just buttons sewn onto the front of the dress.  Definitely not what I was expecting, but for the price its a good dress."
4.0,"I am 5'8&#34;, 160lbs and I bought a Medium in khaki after reading reviews. The color is accurate from the picture. The fit is good except I am constantly tugging it to close and there is definitely enough material hanging on the sides. Picture one is how I would like it lay but picture two is how the sweater falls naturally on me. I wondered why all the models had their hands in the pockets and now I know that the cardigan wants to hang by your sides and you have to pull it forward if you want it to look like that. Otherwise the material is really soft, good quality product and had good length overall. If the sweater would have fit better on me, I might have kept it or at least tried another color- but I will be returning it."
4.0,Good for the price. I wish it was more of a &#34;lady cut&#34; (tapered at the waist).
4.0,"Feels nice, really warm doesn’t feel cheap. It runs very small! Had to order one size up and still barely fits! Had to reorder in a size large and I’m pretty small guy. 5’8” 155 lbs. so unless you like a front to back wedgie order a size up"
4.0,Love this being suit. It is a brighter red than I expected and the clasp at the neck doesn't stay very well. Overall I'm very happy with it though.
4.0,Very nice. Fits good. Good purchase.
4.0,On time and good quality.
4.0,Good for the money. It is not as stretch as I thought...
4.0,"Overall, it was what I expected.<br /><br />2 of the bras are great and very comfortable, but strangely the purple one is tighter."
4.0,Really tucks in the right places. Comfy fit. Love them.
4.0,larger fit
4.0,"I like this dress, it is flattering to the figure but even with my assumption that it may be made for Asian market sizing, I ordered a size Large to fit my 5'6&#34; size 10 frame and it seemed to be one size too small. Unless someone wants to wear a really form fitting dress for the club scene, I would think an XL would fit a curvy size 10 better for weddings and special occasions."
4.0,"This was bigger and boxier than the picture portrays. The cut of the torso is box shaped, not fitted, but over all the fabric is nice quality and the color is as pictured."
4.0,"It was purchased for a grandchild. I’m happy with the quality, feel and design. It was just too large. But I ordered another in a smaller size !"
4.0,Kid likes them but not the best to roll...probably better other double rollers available with other companies. Very limited choice of colors
4.0,"This beanie is rather small and snug for an average sized male head. I bought it for my husband and tried it on myself because it looked so small, it was snug on me too! The quality of the material is excellent. He liked it and kept it anyway."
4.0,Nice sandals. I wear between an 8 and 8.5. I got a 9 and they fit perfect.
4.0,Great hat.  Sheds a tiny bit of rabbit fur.
4.0,Nice concept. The belt itself wears out quickly
4.0,Not too snug and it falls really nice.
4.0,"Super cute, but not as comfortable as I had hoped"
4.0,I  like the way these jeans look and fit.
4.0,Necklace is different than a traditional necklace but my wife liked it because it was different.  She would buy again.
4.0,"I keep feeling like something is going to pop off of these glasses. I snapped the outer visor on. So far so good. Maybe I'm just worrying for nothing. But when I put the glasses on, the inner frame gets in my way. It's not a bad design, but it's definitely not for everyone."
4.0,Fits larger than expected but overall nice.
4.0,Basically a wax boonie hat made with heavy cotton. I couldn't find a decent picture anywhere online so I hope these ***pics help.<br /><br /> I usually wear a 7 1/2. Tilley in general recommends to size up one size * because a sun hat should have a brim that fits comfortably over the face. This 7 5/8 is a little snug but I expect it to stretch out a little due to it being made from cotton. The Upside to having the hat a little snug is the form keeps its shape better. If it fit looser I'd be stuck with a floppy hat. I turn this into a fedora by bending the front brim down. It stays for the most part.<br /><br />Expensive but I haven't seen one this nice in black. If you look around several australian vendors sell really nice ones in brown...but not in black.
4.0,Genial.
4.0,"This wristband looks as good in person as it does in the product picture. You may have some trouble with the small strings when putting and taking off the wristband. Other than that, it is a great buy with a good shipping time. Enough said."
4.0,"I like the wallet, just wish it had a clear window for drivers license."
4.0,Good fit nice hat
4.0,"This outfit is super cute, but I thought the bow would already be tied and put together and it is not. So for that, the purchase lost a star because I do not know how to make a proper bow from ribbon. Outfit is super adorable though!"
4.0,No dislikes just what I expected.
4.0,My wife brought one home from Costco and I was in hat heaven. Despite my enormous head It fit. We ordered 2 more from Amazon. These two have a smaller brim which is floppier and it fits a bit too tightly. It is a decent hat but not perfect like the one from Costco. Maybe it is just a different batch from a different manufacturer but not the same hat.
4.0,The only issue with the earrings is they are thick so I’m afraid they will get caught on clothes. Other than that they are beautiful and sparkly.
4.0,Nice little dress. Lovely design and lightweight for spring.
4.0,"Cute top, just wish it was not so loose fitting. I kept having to pull it back."
4.0,not quite how I thought it looked but it is ok
4.0,Pants are really long. My LO will be able to wear the shirt along before the pants.
4.0,"It is a bit snug in the upper arms, but that might be my disproportionate body.  The rest fits GREAT.  I love the length of the bell, it is short enough to not drag into my food and such, but long enough to add a flair that I get a lot of compliments on.  I do wish it was a bit sturdier fabric.  But overall, VERY satisfied!"
4.0,"Stylish and cute... my two year old loves them. At the moment, they also seem to be prettt durable."
4.0,Built tough.  They look like they'll last awhile.
4.0,"I purchased this dress to wear on Christmas! It looks expensive and had so many compliments.  Very comfortable, just didn't care for the shoulder padding but other than that it's perfect!"
4.0,Great for all my makeup for every day & travel!
4.0,"great shoe for the price, not as much arch support as I like, medium support I would say but defintely much better than any new shoe is the price bracket."
4.0,"Like most of the sticky socks, the rubber dots on the bottom of my feet hurt when I wear them on the hard wood floors, but these socks do stay on my feet during workout and my feet don't slip around much when I'm using them. They are VERY grippy, so I'd definitely recommend them if you need to use them for safety. They also wash well, just make sure you turn them inside out when you dry them."
4.0,This coat is absolutely beautiful however it did not fit in the bust area for me.
4.0,This material is so soft and not see through like some of the other lighting deals I’ve gotten. I’m 5’7.5” and currently about 170. I am a true pear shape so this dress fit nice on top as a medium and the areas that are thicker are fine under the looser fitting bottom. It is a little longer and hits me almost at the knee (just above)
4.0,It took a few times practicing to get used to it. Good for everyday dishes.
4.0,Don't get this wet because it's not waterproof!<br />Other than that it's good.
4.0,i both this as a gift and the person loves it but its smaller than what i was expecting
4.0,A Tiny bit too small...leaves the rings on my forehead when 7 3/4 usually don't.
4.0,"being pretty much straight up-and-down and big-busted, I am pleased that this jumpsuit is cut straight up and down with a functional drawstring waist (not elastic) for custom shaping. the pockets aren't sewn right into the sideseam, so dont stick out on sides.  the crotch is cut a bit long, but does allow for strap and waist-length adjustments.<br /><br />am 5'5"" and 168 lbs.  I ordered a 3X and it fit just the way I wanted to. nice silky fabric drapes over body with no unflattering squeeze anywhere.<br />one thing I didnt think about is bathroom visits, but this jumpsuit slides down and back up with ease.<br /><br />only reason for 4 rather than 5stars is the way-too-long length.  even at 5'5"" I had to cut and hem 6"" off leg hems to bring them up to floor-length."
4.0,Shirt was appropriately sized and very soft.  Washing left it reasonably wrinkle free.  Looks good while worn.  Overall a nice shirt.  A<br />Little pricey and that’s why I gave it a 4 Star rating.
4.0,"Incredibly cute case.  Doesn't protect from fall damage the way thicker cases seem too (still shattered my glass screen protector when dropping it), but super cute, prevents side nicks and the like, didn't rub paint off on my pants or get discolored from being in my pockets, and is overall really great.  Plus I constantly get compliments on how pretty it is when I use it"
4.0,The dress is beautiful and would be very comfortable but it is not cut for a person with breasts. I ordered a XXL and the item that came was closer to an XL maybe L on top the body was also tight. If it had fit better I would have been very happy.
4.0,"Perfect width for jeans, some are so wide they will not fit thru belt loops.  This is a perfect size and love that it's adjustable."
4.0,"All of the chokers are simple and pretty.. I ordered the pack with 6.. I think they are well worth the buy. The materials used look sort of cheap, but you can not tell unless your close up on them.."
4.0,"Perfect for driving and walking at beach on windy days. I usually wear long brim hat, which is not doing job(shading) against winds."
4.0,Nice looking and fitting though they do get scuffed on the toes easily.
4.0,I had a salad the morning of my purchase and thought “I’m probably an extra small”. I almost had to dip myself in grease to squeeze into these things only to have my muffin top to be visible for a mile away. Don’t kid yourself just buy your size. I have these pants in a small blue color and they fit to size. I don’t recommend these pants for running however because you have to hike them up during your run. They are more meant for workouts where you are lifting weights or doing yoga.
4.0,"I love this skirt. Super cute. Fits great, but the first one I received (on the left) was missing a stud on the corner of the left pocket. Reorder and you can see the skirts are identical ( except for the missing stud). 💯"
4.0,"Great t-shirt, but ran large. I had to wash and dry it to shrink it."
4.0,"Kool shades,nice fit"
4.0,Light weight. Not heavy around the neck. Beautiful gift for a young lady!
4.0,Not a bad watch for the reasonable price.  Light weight easy to set all functions and easy to read display a sun or shade.
4.0,"I am 5’10” and considerably overweight. I bought one of these.... then five more.  I fell in love with them.  Of note: they run very large.  I wear a 2x normally, ordered 2x and they are fine, but I could probably wear a L and definitely and XL Would do.<br />I took off a star for inconsistency.  Between the 6 I have, there is a couple of inches fluctuation in length and fabric.  My dark green one is just a SMIDGE short and I sometimes trip over the coral one.  The dark green and bright blue ones are a nice, slightly heavy, very flattering fabric with a perfect bounce to it.  The other colors are a much thinner fabric that can get a bit clingy (though not badly) - I wear them with breezy kimono tops, so my rear is covered or I might have more of an issue with that.  Only one - the royal blue (which looks a beautiful purple to me) seems a bit see-through, so I only wear it around the house or with a slip.  Overall, I love these and plan to spend most of my summer in them.  Can be dressed up or down and couldn’t be more comfy.  Tall girls, go for it.  If you’re short, plan to hem it."
4.0,fit great and love the colors
4.0,"I really like this shirt.  The material is quality, the color is as advertised.  I should have sized up for comfort value.  For reference, I am 5'2 and 138lbs.  I ordered the 3XL (international sizing), and it fits, but a little snug.  I will be washing on cold, and air-drying.  Or, hit the the gym. :)"
4.0,Easy dress to throw over a swim suite. fabric was cool and airy. Was a bit too open in the front for me. i returned it because there was not way to pin it closed without lots of fitting issue.
4.0,"Bought this for my stepson and he LOVES it... unfortunately it rips easily.  The lengthy sleeves tend to catch on things if you're not careful, and the material rips fairly easily; thus I've had to order a secondary one for him.  Bummer."
4.0,"I wish the base was just a little wider.<br />Other than that, great compartmental storage."
4.0,"Was hoping it would be a little longer or thicker, but its very cute and still looks great."
4.0,"Such an adorable outfit! Love the stripes and the dinos. This outfit did come with a strong chemical smell when it was opened. It has dissipated a bit after being opened, and I'm hoping it will completely disappear after opening. The material is very soft. The crotch area snaps open and close, but if you look closely at the ankles you will see the pants do not open down the cuff. This can be a good thing - if your little pops a snap, the whole outfit won't open and the legs are stretchy so it is easy to get the feet in and out! Simply adorable! Can't wait to see my little one is this one! 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!"
4.0,"Runs a little big. I wish I had sized down as this fit was too loose on me. I really don’t like the flap in the area below the belly, there’s like an awkward fold there, where it should be more accentuated. The sleeves fit well and the off The shoulder look is good. The wine red color leans more towards red in reality as compared to the photo on the listing. The material is thick and high quality, not cheap looking or cheap feeling. It’s a fashionable peeve overall but could be better. Def size down!"
4.0,"I bought this to work with some polishing fluid to use on coins.  Although I was not able to clean the coins, it was not the fault of the cloth.  It is of excellent quality.  If this one won't work, I'm not sure it can be done"
4.0,Bust area runs smaller than expected but probably would work for average bust women
4.0,"i LOVED these dresses on amazon, and was convinced that i'd be absolutely in love once i saw them in person too.<br /><br />i do LOVE them, but unfortunately, was disappointed by some very minor flaws.<br /><br />the fabric is a nice weight, and the fit looks fine (my daughter is spending time with her grandparents, so i haven't had a chance to throw this on her body yet), but there are some quality issues with the specific pieces i received. there are no sewn in tags, only stickers where the tags should be, so i'll be in a bit of a pickle when it's time to pack/give these away since there will be no indicator of size.<br /><br />the stitching on one part of the rainbow was also noticeably flawed, and, in my opinion, shouldn't have passed inspection. i could have lived without the tags and still felt like the quality of these items was five-star, but this was the ticker on these dresses.<br /><br />the collared dress is beautiful and perfect though! i may have just gotten a bum order, so i still trust the brand, just wish there were more stringent quality controls in place so i wouldn't have to go through the hassle of trying to replace it"
4.0,"The only hiccup is the identification pocket.  My licence gets stuck. Other than that snafoo, I love it"
4.0,The stone colors are not as they appear on the site. I like the design and it is good quality though
4.0,Keeps the fabric off your face but takes time to get used to.
4.0,"I ordered too small a size; it looks great and I think I would like it if I had a size that fit. Unfortunately, I cut off the tags before I tried it. I might reorder in a larger size."
4.0,"like it but i can't fit my iPhone 6 in it.  for the price, it's decent."
4.0,"We can't all wait to get out of masks.<br />As a member of church choir, it is nice to have a mask which isn't getting pulled into your mouth, and allows better air flow.  This one does.  Still get a little steaming of my glasses with this mask."
4.0,"Super cute, but they run too small."
4.0,would buy again .thank  you
4.0,The clasps/hooks aren't very sturdy But otherwise good variety for price.
4.0,"Loved it! It came perfectly in the mail, but took a little longer than it said it would. But the product is good."
4.0,So cute and comfortabe material!
4.0,Incredibly adorable but the fabric isn't the best quality.
4.0,Only issue is neck piece could be longer. However husband loves it and that is good enough for me.
4.0,This watch combines the convenience of atomic synchronization with the freedom from battery replacement as it is solarly powered. The only drawback is that after some time the night light feature stopped working.
4.0,Bought for lady friend. She likes it a lot.
4.0,"These are cute socks, nice with low sneakers, or peaking out the top of booties. They're a little thin, but as I bought these more for aesthetic rather than to be super functional, this doesn't bother me much."
4.0,Cute and it has plenty of room. It isn't the best quality though
4.0,This dress is really nice and can be dressed up or down. The fabric is soft and not see through.
4.0,good quality..fast delivery
4.0,Cute and functional for anything. Not extremely flattering but it’s not boxy. Will serve its purpose. Sleeves are cute and fabric is decent so far.
4.0,"Pretty, but very, very thin, fell apart quickly."
4.0,Very nice dress however thin material
4.0,This was a gift from a friend and I sure do like it. It's so cute and pretty.
4.0,"Pink leather turn darker... but doesn't smell, zipper is smooth, holds alot of cards. I like it"
4.0,"This is a good size for braiding into hair styles. It is a true navy blue in color with bright white polka dots. The hem is wavy, not straight, but it is completly sewn. Mid grade quality. Maybe used as a bag scarf if you get creative with knots and take up some length, otherwise it is a little too large for that."
4.0,"The socks go up to my thighs rather than above my knees, but I just roll them up. (I'm 5'1) Besides that, it's a pretty good product. It's comfy and cute. I would buy again."
4.0,Good for the price. Non slip is great.
4.0,A little heavy but still love
4.0,Runs a bit small.  Pretty though
4.0,"Right away I’ll say the only reason I’m giving it four stars is because it puckers a bit between two buttons when I try to button it up all the way. But wearing it either open or with merely the top button fastened made for a lovely added layer, and it kept me warmer on a chilly breezy evening! °o°"
4.0,My girlfriend liked it a lot looks very real doesn’t look plastic
4.0,las bandas elásticas marcan los pies.
4.0,"Great fit, but very delicate. The lens has popped out a couple of times but easily goes back in."
4.0,Loved the color and girls it has POCKETS! Ordered for my mom for a wedding and it fit her good and it was a corset style on back which has a little hole to pull strings through. The sleeves were beautiful but very loose and large we had to get them fixed. It was also long length wise in my mom she is about 5’ ft and even with heels had to take about a few inches off. Her bust is about a 36 C
4.0,Awesome value. Everyday casual shirts!
4.0,I didn’t realize that they didn’t have a bra inside.  I wear them instead of a camisole.  Very comfortable.
4.0,this outfit is great for going out! very flowy and classy looking
4.0,"For the price it is really a nice little summer top - but you have to size way up.  I bought the XXXL, when I am normally a Medium.  For reference, I am 5'4/135lbs and small chested.  I got the XXXLarge, and it fits just right across the chest.  It is somewhat loose in the waist.  Btw ladies,  I always find it so helpful when you include your dimensions in your reviews.  I would otherwise have ordered a size that would have ended up way too small."
4.0,like it very much - works much better than slip over -
4.0,My granddaughter loves her frog shoes.
4.0,"I wanted a Tiger's Eye drop to wear on a silver choker or chain, so this does work. The stone has a pretty color and the silver is nicely made. I gave this 4 stars only because the pendent was so small. Wish it were larger."
4.0,Length is perfect. Lots of fullness. Will work week for my Elsa costume. Came with a rip at the seam and a small hole. Can not be seen when on.
4.0,Small watch. Light is a little dim. Hard to see at night. Good for the price.
4.0,I found this lightweight jacket easy to wear but it is way too warm in 75+ degree weather. I had to use sunscreen in lieu of the jacket I felt like I was going to smother in warm-hot temps.  I live in the NW and when the sun is out and the temps are in the 50s-60 the jacket is perfect especially when driving.
4.0,Tried it on when I received it however have not worn yet due to being too hot for the season.
4.0,So fat. So good. They fit perfectly. They look great and the are much lighter than the original lenses. Vision and sun-blocking seem to be perfect. I’ve only had them for a few weeks so hoping they hold up like they should. If so it’s a five star rating. Fingers crossed
4.0,"Its a simple dress, lightweight fabric, soft and drapes well. I dont like my dresses above the knee and was happy this one provides adaquate coverage."
4.0,Somewhat smaller than the one I bought last year
4.0,The sleeves are too large. I like the color and the fabric. Light weight.
4.0,"They were too small, and I only got one earring."
4.0,"Love this crossbody purse but it will not fit my phone with the proctor case on. It won't snap. It's about a half inch to short from fastening to the snap.<br />I do like it thou. So I thought I  would buy some double sided velcro to attach to the case.<br />If I  take my phone out of the case  it will fit.<br />I would of given it a five star ,but its too short."
4.0,"If you have small boobs, this is a great fit, looks sexy without making you look slutty. Docked one star because it doesn't have padding around the nipples"
4.0,Great fit and my great grandson loves it. Good product for the price. I would recommend this slipper for children.
4.0,Very good hat for the low price nicely designed with a cool stye.
4.0,"It was a little cheap, but I ended up with 3 different colors regardless.  I like the sheer coverage and hides my belly. I usually hover between a small and medium,  medium was perfect fit"
4.0,"Cotton, spandex blend is good quality and the fit is comfortable."
4.0,"Panvbo 8 Pairs Womens No Show Socks Casual Low Cut Invisible Loafer Liner Cotton Socks<br /><br />Perfect shape and fit for my new slip ons. These no show socks are the perfect solution for my theme park walking days.<br /><br />They have a low-cut invisible design, makes these casual socks fit my shoes perfectly!

4.0,"Extremely soft, stretchy and great for getting out of the shower. You wont get over heated getting ready, so flexible and lightweight. Only thing that was different is the waist tie isn't attached, it just has loops to hold in place."
4.0,"The fabric was nice and as described, but the fit was too small for me.  I returned the top."
4.0,Super comfortable but on the expensive side.
4.0,"When I received this friction ball in the mail I thought it was a child's toy. It looks like a small bounce ball and it feels the same too. It even has a weird character/image on it. The image looks like it came from a foreign cartoon. However, despite it's toy like appearance it is very useful for screwing on watch case backs and it's a great aid in opening watch cases. If you are looking for a tool to open a watch back buy a watch wrench, and use this after you loosen the back to continue opening the watch. With a watch wrench you can scratch the back of your watch if to much force is applied. This friction ball works great once the back is slightly loosened. As far a shipping goes it came a whole month early, and it only took 2 weeks. Useful product!"
4.0,It runs small. It didn’t work for us due to running too small
4.0,"Look exactly like baublebar. But if you have sensitive ears, these will bother."
4.0,"This product was worth it for the price. These chokers are adjustable, however, they are much smaller than I expected. They are mostly comfortable, but pretty tight. Very cute colors, well made. It only looks like 30% ""cheap"". Would be great for cosplay, 50/50 might buy again if on sale. Great presentation and would recommend."
4.0,"The pants are great color, fit, long enough if tall or shortened if 5'4"". Cute and my granddaughter loves them but fabric is thin in colder climates great if you live in warmer climate. Worthwhile buy."
4.0,Love the color & fabric.
4.0,"I purchased two a solid and a print. The dress fits perfectly and are adorable. The print dress fabric was really nice prior to washing. After first washing (hanging to dry), I noticed the fabric already looks a little worn. The solid black dress I bought isn’t as soft of material, but held up better during wash."
4.0,Really like the color and material. Neck fits a bit odd as if they couldn't figure out exactly which side was front or back. Not a deal breaker but unusual fit at the neck.
4.0,Overall I love the design of this band. I immediately fell in love with this hook type attachment when I bought a backpack from Timbuk 2 that had similar design for keeping the bag closed. Overall the band material is decently made and is not showing any fraying and the hook seems to be pretty sturdy. If you have larger hands and/or wrist... this band might not be for you. I wear a size large glove and have a medium sized wrist and even this band was almost too small to put on. My only gripe would be that the leads that attach to the watch body look like they are plastic... so hoping they last.
4.0,Pretty much want is advertised. They don't hug my head like I'd like but I won't pick nits. For the price you get what you are offered.
4.0,Perfect for my homeless drive
4.0,great bracelate! it all just mixes together
4.0,Works like it should- need to have phone close by for Bluetooth technology- speakers ok (not a Bose earphone) but convenient and a cool gift idea for those men who have it all or hard to shop for
4.0,"These were a MAJOR disappointment.  The post, the part that goes through the ear and attaches to the earring, was glued on, not soldered on. Needless to say it fell apart immediately and I never got to wear them. That’s two pair of useless earrings I received from Amazon in October. I’ll do my earring shopping in brick and mortar stores from now on."
4.0,Lo ocupe para un evento en la Iglesia
4.0,It is somewhat small - not awful
4.0,"This top is beautiful, fits great and nice material"
4.0,I wish it was smoothed down or glossy. But it's still a beautiful bracelet.
4.0,"These are ao comfy!  I will probably end up using these as my &#34;get home from work and change&#34; pants.  I won't be wearing them out, though.  The waist band is just a bit too tight and leaves an unflattering silhouette on me."
4.0,Very pretty light pink
4.0,Was what we expected to get.
4.0,Good gift item.
4.0,Very cute alot of compliments ever time i wear but they do not stay on very well if head is facing downward .
4.0,It's extreamally cute but it got 4/5 because it's so freakin loud! I love it anyways. Comfort is 4/5 too
4.0,Beautiful and feels comfy too :)
4.0,Good for the price...although chain could be a little thick..
4.0,"This jumpsuit is pretty,  but it wasn't for me. The color is prety to."
4.0,Very warm and cozy!
4.0,Very thin and a little small. Next time I would order a size up.
4.0,I really like how long it is so I can pull it up over my nose and mouth but I wish there was some way to tighten it when it's on my face. I also really like that its thin enough to run and breath through it but thick enough to do the job!
4.0,"These are a great deal for the price.  not as durable as original Rayban, but for the price they are great.  Hinges on my move easily."
4.0,"The jersey looks great, everything I had hoped for. I just wish the description mentioned it was sized for  wear over pads. I bought it as a gift for someone who wears an XL and the XL is too big."
4.0,The loop for the pendant gets caught or bends allowing the pendant to fall off
4.0,"This  is very comfortable, the quality is good, I like it very much!"
4.0,This shirt is super comfortable and the quality is very good. The color is beautiful & the fit is slightly big as others have said. Fits me exactly how I imagined though!<br />**Update: the letters are a little frayed  on the edges.
4.0,"I ordered a medium after reading the other reviews of peoplecin my height and weight range (5ft2in 130 pounds) and I'm hoping it will shrink a bit in the wash because it goes all the way down past my knees and is very wide around the waist. It's more like a large, loose, flowy non form fitted dress than just a loose dress. I think paired with a waist belt and some leggings it would look amazing. Also the fabric is thick enough that I don't have to wear anything underneath. I ordered the purple one and it's not in any way see through even in bright light. But it's still light weight and comfy,"
4.0,"I have such a hard body to size for swimming suits; I really need to go with custom suits so I generally just don't buy swimsuits at all.  I wear size 6 jeans but a DD bra cup size,  so anything that fits one part of my body doesn't work well for the other.  I opted for a large, assuming I'd need as much space on the tops as I could get.  And as I expected, the cups built into the top are comically small, but the mesh top keeps me in place a little better than I expected.  There's just a lot of boob skin showing under the mesh, so I do wish it was all a little more opaque, but the description says mesh, so I knew what I was getting into.  However, the bottom portion of the suit is great.  It hides a little bit of stomach very well.  The suit is probably one of the most flattering suit styles for my body that I've found in years.  If you're an average chested woman with a little bit of tummy you'd like to obscure, give this one a try."
4.0,"Perfect fit, stay up like they should. So nice we bought a 2nd pair!!"
4.0,The kids thought this was hilarious on Halloween. It was kind of hard to keep it aired up around the head (I had to hold the strap up for the head to be up) but in all worth it.
4.0,Honestly didn’t think they would turn out as nice as they did!
4.0,Cute top. Runs small.
4.0,It is a beautiful blouse but it fit smaller than I was expecting. The fabric has good quality and good details.
4.0,"It's pretty cute! The size is about right! You can tighten the skirt with the little belt that came with it. Just a tiny little bit thin, but not too bad that it become a problem"
4.0,"Other than the paint looking poor in aome areas, and a burr in the blade, its nice n big amd looks good as a wall decoration."
4.0,"I'm surprisingly happy with it. It is decently well sewn and constructed. It's has a very modern look to it. It's made out of thick shirt'esq material and it's fun and fancy. It stretches and it gives. Very comfy too. Tho, the two side tail part is a bit long, in my opinion. I'm 5'4&#34; and the tip of tail touches the ground when I wear it."
4.0,"Blade-Tech holsters are my favourite, but this assembly should come with instructions, for adjusting for different belt widths.<br />The adjuster looks symmetric but is not, and pops out of position if not installed exactly right.<br />For the cost, the unit should come with a spare adjuster, as they will break if handled roughly."
4.0,"This is a warm hat not to be lined. The delivery was swift and the packaging was good. I love that the pom-pom/fur ball can be interchanged with two other hats I ordered in a different brand from a different retailer. The faux fur is good quality, but you can tell it is not real, which is fine with me - fake a pom-pom, save a racoon! LOL"
4.0,Beautiful dress. Fabric is much thinner/lighter than I expects so it falls flat on the body not stiff as appears in photo. The color is more cranberry than red but still lovely. The edges are simply cut in the ruffle pattern and not sewn into seams so I worry it will fray once washed. But so far so good.
4.0,"really cute, not too much of a difference between the large and extra large but still a good fit and super comfortable"
4.0,Has a tendency to slip off but it is very comfy. I would recommend.
4.0,A little wide but nice glasses and durable
4.0,"Loved the shirt, but too small"
4.0,I love the print on the lanyard. Fall out is life. But the breakaway clasp is a little uncomfortable and scratchy and it doesn't lay flat against my neck. It twists a lot. Still worth the buy though! I got one for me and a friend and we both like it a lot.
4.0,The bag is very stiff.
4.0,"These slippers looked really comfortable in the reviews and photos posted online on Amazon. When I got them I immediately put them on and I found that they were comfortable but not real sturdy. They were a little too wide so not real snug, and the padding in the sole is not very thick so I’m not sure how long they will last.  I like that they are lightweight and easy to pack in my suitcase for travel and I like that they are so easy to put on in the morning. They aren’t sturdy enough to wear outside but they are very comfy!"
4.0,Its a beautiful hoop. Just wish I coulda exchanged for a smaller one. Made great n gorgeous stones 👍👍👍👍
4.0,"I like it, its pretty and the quality is not bad. It does run a little big , I should of gotten a medium.  I am 5'6 and weigh 160 that should give you and idea.  It is loose but I will keep it, because I am using it for vacation and I don't have the time to wait for a different size.  I believe it runs true to size. So if you are normally a medium no need to size up.  I listened to order reviews and order a size up, there is no need for that unless you are bigger at bottom or top, because it doe snot have stretch.  If you weigh more than 180 I wouldn't get the large, I would get an x large. Hope this helps ladies."
4.0,"I just used these for a road ride in the evening and an off road ride in bright sun.  They work great for both.  There was a slight glare in the dark conditions.  It made closer viewing more clear than the bare eye, but my distance viewing was reduced.  During the day, the glasses provided very clear high def vision and made obstacles and variations in the ground surface very visible.  All in all, a good pair for biking.  My only complaint is that you can not buy additional lenses to use with the frames.  As advertised, you can change out the lenses.  However,  Dragon does not sell just lenses.  So if you want a different color, you have to buy another set of frames and lenses to obtain different lenses.  That is my only complaint."
4.0,im 6'5 and 320lbs.  its a little tight but still great quality shirt.  i will enjoy wearing it when i lose another 5lbs. :)
4.0,Two beads were missing and the bottom stone. Other than that it is a beautiful necklace. Looks like the picture!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:866401de3479ab555ea096df122d1820]] This item isn't that thick, but it doesn't look cheap either, it has style and the color is nice. The inside of the clothing has cotton/fur material, I didn't like the feeling of the cotton against my skin, but my daughter loved it, she said it was soft and warm."
4.0,"Got many compliments and it’s very cute. The sleeves were tight, so I had to tuck them in. The material is also very lightweight and thin, so I wore shorts underneath or else everyone would see my undies.<br />Perfect for hot weather though! I wore it to the beach. I’m ordering in another color!"
4.0,"This dress is beautiful and elegant, well made, and an amazing find for the price. I normally wear a US size 12/14, but based upon the size chart, I decided to order a size 16. I wear a 36C bra, not what I consider to be very busty, but I  can just barely button this dress up across the chest. If you’re well endowed, this design may not be for you."
4.0,"Nice,it look very good on my face and it is very clear."
4.0,Very thin but good for older ears.  They are vey feminine.
4.0,Very cute I just didn't care for the way the fit on my ears.
4.0,Smaller than expected. Back was bent but I was able to straighten out without breaking. Good for the price. Giving as a gift.
4.0,It’s well made and so cute.
4.0,"Stretchy, easy to get on and off. So far I haven't had a rash like other watch bands"
4.0,Best rfid wallet
4.0,"They don't go on very easy but being compression socks, I didn't expect they would.  Feel great once on and are holding up well at the gym. Will come back with a long term report in a few months"
4.0,These are great product for a great price. They are very thin but they still nicely and they're great for wearing around the house or even under other clothes. I would buy them again. They fit as I expected.
4.0,"Couldn't find this at Airventure, so kudos to Amazon. Waistband is snug, but the rest is a very roomy fit, almost like a skirt with a divider."
4.0,"These fit about as well as you'd expect and have a perfect satin feel. If you find these kinds of pajamas comfortable, you'll love 'em!<br /><br />For me, they're just ok in terms of how they feel- but they are SUPER cute. They have a little drawstring on the pants as well in case you need a little extra to keep 'em on in addition to the elastic."
4.0,Haven't had for a week and a gem fell out...but customer service was tip top.
4.0,"Good summer tank top, but material is almost see through, not what I expected."
4.0,really comfortable and collects the right area tight
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress! Fits just as expected and is a nice comfy stretchy fabric. The color is just like it is online and I love the sleeves. Nice quality dress! The only thing that I don't like about it is that it wrinkles REALLY easily. And when you go to iron it, make sure to cover the fabric with a damp cloth & go on a low heat....I made a mistake and now there's a burn mark on my dress :( ....Other than that no complaints!"
4.0,Perfect backings for lapel puns. They work great. Takes an extra minute to put them on and straighten the pin. But once you get the hang of it your set.
4.0,The chest area of the dress was quite large. I decided to size up like I usually do with online purchases and it fit perfectly at my waist but the chest area was much to large even with the adjustable straps. I am a 34 DD and had this problem. It also has a very low back which is hard to wear a bra with!!!
4.0,It's great but wish I had gotten one a bit longer.
4.0,"These are very soft and warm; however, they are fairly tight and stiff, not much give. If you have a high arch, or wide foot, these may not fit you comfortably."
4.0,Cute shoes but run big
4.0,"Wanted something flat,  which these are.  Definitely on the small side."
4.0,They are the most comfortable slippers I've ever bought. No complaints
4.0,The dress is beautiful<br />Thank you!
4.0,Good purse.  Can hold all my essentials and comfortable to wear.
4.0,"The pants and the flak vest fit perfectly I only had issues with the the top, it was too tight. After taking the top to a local taylor for an alteration they where able to adjust it to my body. After those alterations where done I was able to put on the suit perfectly. I can't wait to get the armor plates for it."
4.0,"When the skirt arrived it was wrinkled within an inch of its life; that is the only reason I did not give five stars. I set the iron to medium-ish, turned the skirt inside out, put a towel over it and said three hail marys. I was so relieved that it did not melt or suffer any abrasions. I wore it for 12 hours and it didn't wrinkle. I am super pleased with the look, fit and solid construction. It's high-quality faux leather, not thin or flimsy. It allowed me to create the perfect ""Office to Out"" look by pairing it with a retro-inspired blouse and tall leather boots. I am 6'0 feet, 165, Sz 12 and the XL fits perfect, landing right below the knee."
4.0,"bought as an xmas gift for my dad.. was worried the largest size was going to be too small, but they ended up fitting just right.. he lives up north and needs these a majority of the year! He loves 'em or at least he says he does.. who knows, he's a dad.. i'll update the review if he makes any complaints about the quality in the future"
4.0,"This dress fits really nicely! I purchased the dress in a large,I'm 5'2 and 180, and the dress is the perfect length!"
4.0,It was easy to attach and seems to be exactly as described.
4.0,They don’t compress asbestos much as I would like it too and it’s not as high waisted as I’d like it but they’re super comfy and definitely outstanding material. They look exactly like the picture.
4.0,"Super simple tool, gets the job done. It’s basically just an alligator clip fixed onto a wooden handle, but it’s not like it needs to be fancy. Clips onto the bracelet and allows me to hold it in place while I clasp it without trying to bend my wrist and fingers in awkward positions."
4.0,"Fits true to size, thin but nice looking material"
4.0,"Very small sizes had to send back size 9 and reorder a size 10, so go one size up, very comfortable to wear"
4.0,only thing i did not like is one back pocket and no way to secure wallet.
4.0,Cute blouse. Fits well at ordered size. Only thing I don't like is wrinkles easily..
4.0,"A little smaller than I had anticipated, but it works for me because I like small. Nicely made. Seems to be of good quality. Good service."
4.0,zipper gets stuck a lot. real nice leather
4.0,Love this bag.Fits everything needed to a quick trip to the mall.
4.0,"Not at all what you see on the photos, I mean is for sure retouched, material looks way lower quality in real life, I mean for the price is not bad, I have got many 12-18 USD ones with not that far same quality, so for the relation with price is a good option. If you are the kind of people who likes to change multiple colors over the week is not bad, but for sure is not a heavy duty daily thing, or at least from my point of view. Closure system is good, tho"
4.0,"Love them just wish they made them for specific frame  shapes.  Aside from that, no issues."
4.0,"I will definitely be grabbing another pair of these. I like the fit, look and the cost is good."
4.0,Scarf for a child perfect
4.0,"It came later in the day when I was too tired to try it on, and it came damaged.  I will have to get some of the buttons sewn back on, otherwise, it is beautiful and I love it."
4.0,"Warm, help me to deal with -20 degree celsius in the midwest winter."
4.0,I liked the adjustable in the belt. But I thought they were magnetic. Still a good belt.
4.0,"Ordered the medium so I could wear pants underneath & these are pretty true to size. They're pretty long (I'm 5'3"") so I had to roll the bottoms a bit, but they kept me warm and don't make too much of a swish noise while walking."
4.0,"A little bulkier than I thought, but SO comfy!"
4.0,"This is a nice hat, I love the liner. It isn't quite as slouchy as expected but it looks fine. Mainly there is a chemical smell when it first arrives which might be alleviated with a light run through the dryer with a fabric softener sheet."
4.0,Adorable and good quality. My sister loved it.
4.0,This umbrella is very heavy duty and the spring action to open and close is very useful! Im quite happy with the purchase :)<br /><br />Disclaimer:i did receive a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
4.0,It is handy but it picks up a good bit of dirt outside my purse or even inside. It is handy!
4.0,It is a lot heavier then I expected but it is pretty
4.0,"Swimsuit material causes no breathing room.  Colors are awesome and pretty true to pics online.  The cut outs on the back are as such and look like someone did a hack job ,none of the lines are even and had to trim because of the impurities.  Runs a little small went one size up and it's tight but manageable.  Cotton would've been better."
4.0,The buttons make it so these pant go with absolutely nothing.  It can only be worn with a white Or tan cotton like fabric for a shirt.  Cute pants.  Just didn’t realize it would be so hard to match it with anything
4.0,"So CUTE! Feels very well made. I can see the slight areas where the price comes into play, like the bottom of the front pocket not being lined (the rest of it is though) but it doesn’t really make a huge difference at all.<br />The straps are adjustable in a belt type of manner and you can always get a hole punched in the rest of them if you want it to sit like up against your back instead of kinda hanging loose & low. Most jewelry shops and watch repair shops (or maybe a tailor?) should have a leather punch.<br />4 ⭐️ out of 5 because mine came with a horrible smell in it... bad. Fishy. It’s completely clean definitely not a return product resent. Dryer sheets did the trick.. don’t know how washing it would work out."
4.0,The backs don’t really click on well so the earrings are really loose in the ears. I already lost a backing less then a day of wearing.
4.0,This is even more pretty in person.  I got the hot pink and blue and love the vibrant colors.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"NICKER Men's Jackie Moon 33 &quot;Flint Tropics&quot; Basketball Jersey came nicely packed without any damage. This jersey is made of polyester mesh and the stitching quality is good. This jersey is anti-shrink, anti-wrinkle, and Anti Pilling cloth and is very comfortable to wear. Letters and numbers on the Jersey are sewn and stitched on the jerseys."
4.0,"So far so good. They look great. They fit great. I can easily read with them outside in the sun. The semi hard case protects them. I could not ask for anything more. If you like the aviator style and need bifocals, I highly recommend these."
4.0,Color is as shown. Beautiful emerald green. Love this dress. Fits well!
4.0,My grandson is 13 and I have been buying since he was 5.  Now in mens
4.0,"Loved the shirt and it fit as expected. The only reason why it is missing a star is because it seemed as if the color faded after a couple of washes. Not too noticeable, but I wished that did not happen!"
4.0,"This most annoying thing about this jacket is that it arrived with factory creases that were difficult to get out. Finally had to hand steam to release the creases<br />Other than that, I loved the fit of this jacket. It’s loose and not body hugging. Very comfortable and light. Exactly what I wanted."
4.0,"Doctors orders I get these. These are nice socks, wish they weren't as long as they are, but I'm making them work."
4.0,This item is very pretty but a bit smaller than I was hoping for. Put it on a different chain as the one it came with was very very thin. I like the looks of the pendant on a more substantial chain. It’s a keeper despite the smaller size and flimsy chain included with this pendant. I really wish sellers would include actual human photos so it would be easier to judge the size.
4.0,Very cute shirt. I love how it fits.
4.0,My boyfriend loved them. They are good quality and look great
4.0,"Love this bag!  I’ve had it for just over a week now, and use it to carry things back and forth from my car to work. It’s a little smaller than I expected, but it’s a good size for me. I can stick lunch, glass case, spare pants, and a few other things in it and still have some room left. There are a TON of pockets on this, so there always seems like room for more. The small pouch is great also (I use it to carry a work phone on my belt), but it does snap on the bag super easy!  They are coming out with a full size bag in the next month or so, and I’m interested to see if that bag is just as functional."
4.0,"I love how these pants feel, they’re soft and they look great. They’re a little big, I’m 5’7” and 166 pounds"
4.0,Slippers are comfortable.  I just wish the top came up higher on the foot.
4.0,It was the perfect gift. My daughter loves HP. The only issue she had was correcting the time and there were no instructions included.
4.0,Super cute swimsuit but runs small in size.
4.0,"This watch is very attractive and looks like it should cost much more than $26.00.  On the plus side the chronograph function does work as does the 24 hour dial and day number.  The movement is a pretty much standard quartz system with one second increment.  The band appears to be of high quality and is both durable and good looking.<br />Because of the nature of the quartz movement the chronograph timing increment is one second so fractional second timing is not available. The bezel is not movable so there is no slide rule function, it is purely cosmetic.<br />It is a good looking watch and certainly worth the $26.00 price tag.  But if you want a fully functional chronograph you ill have to spend a lot more money."
4.0,"Not the best socks i've ever bought, but not bad."
4.0,I like the grips on the bottom of the socks. They are very cozy and useful on slippery floors. The down side is that the stitching on the top of the ankle comes out easily.
4.0,These are great for blocking the blue light. I definitely notice less strain on my eyes. The only thing I don’t like is they’re so lightweight that they feel like the 3D movie glasses you get from a theater.
4.0,"People tend to fall into three camps when it comes to sunglasses:<br /><br />1) Can't understand why anyone would spend more than $5-$10 on sunglasses<br /><br />2) Fully appreciate the visual quality difference between $10 sunglasses and &#34;expensive&#34; ones<br /><br />3) Buy fashions regardless of practical effectiveness<br /><br />I generally like to think I fall under #2. Most of my friends roll their eyes when, every few years, I spend over $100 on some sunglasses. They just go &#34;uh huh&#34; when I try to explain the visual quality difference.<br /><br />But, it's true. There absolutely is a visual difference when wearing (most) &#34;expensive&#34; sunglasses verse the kind you buy off the rack at the local grocery store checkout. Now, is it worth an extra $100+? As long as you're not the type to break/lose one's sunglasses, then the answer is a resounding yes. A pair of Oakleys tend to last me between 6-8 years before wear and tear force me to replace them. When you divide the money spent on some Oakleys over that time span, well...<br /><br />As to these particular Oakleys. The sizing is standard/medium/normal. If you have a truly huge head, then these probably aren't for you, but that's true for the vast majority of glasses. The &#34;Asian Fit&#34; aspect...well, it's definitely preferable to non &#34;asian fit&#34; glasses. If you don't have the facial structure glasses like these are aimed at, you really can't understand how low-level aggravating normal glasses are...a low-level aggravation that just builds up over time. &#34;Asian fit&#34;, no matter the brand, doesn't cure it completely, but they are definitely far less strain-inducing, and there's far less of the push your glasses in firmly and have your eyelid/lashes brushing the lens vs leaving your glasses loose, and having to push them back in place constantly.<br /><br />As for the lenses on these particular Oakleys...color is so very subjective. All I can say is these are exactly what I look for in my lenses (slightly cooler look than &#34;natural&#34;).<br /><br />Now, Oakleys continue to come with the &#34;rubber&#34; ends, which is supposed to be made of some &#34;superior&#34; material, and while I don't have an answer to what I'm about to say, I will say that this is what tends to go first on every pair of Oakleys I've owned over my life."
4.0,Think they are nice love the different colors comes with a extra not to long not to short just right no complaining about it I actually referred these to my sisters I am most definitely going to be sure I add these to my Christmas list
4.0,Like soft material nice dreas
4.0,I thought it was hysterical and held air fine.  It comes really wrinkled but its still cool. A big hit with the kids and adults. Only problem is the draw string around the waist doesn't stay tight to keep the air in. I had to keep pulling at it to try to adjust it so it stayed more inflated. But was a great costume.
4.0,"Runs a little small.  I am 5'10, weight 172lbs and I ordered a XL just in case they ran small, and of course they did. Little shorter than they should be.  But nice material."
4.0,Much happier with this shirt than I was expecting to be. It could be a tad longer for me but I'm 5' 10 so it's a common problem.
4.0,"It is a nice leotard of decent quality. We used it for a ballet Xmas performance and it looked good. My only complaint is that it is a bit too open in the back. I would've preferred if it had come up a little higher in the back, but I should've noticed this from the pictures. I had to sew in some ribbon to close it up a little, and to keep in from falling off her shoulders.  Otherwise it's a nice leotard."
4.0,Not quite as good as expected but durable and at a good price.
4.0,Plush.  My niece loved it.  I didn’t like the eye lashes on the Dres.
4.0,Pretty. I ordered green and got pink though. Pockets would also have been nice. Will be good for working around the house to keep clothes clean.<br /><br />Note: I do not have a very large chest (34D) but if you did this would look funny. It’s about as snug as I would tolerate on top.
4.0,Nice but not as detailed as photo shows. Colors not as brilliant. All in all a cute bead for the price though
4.0,"Very stylish and I get a lot of compliments. Pretty comfortable as I’m able to wear them all day at work. I would’ve given 5 stars if they had a pull loop attack to get the boots on easier. Still a good boot, would recommend."
4.0,Fit perfect and looks exactly like the photo
4.0,I wear XL but bought L based on the reviews here. L was still almost a little big. This sweatshirt is a little big and bulky for my taste.
4.0,The glasses are very good looking. They are large on my face but that’s how all aviators look on me. I absolutely love the color of the lenses and the frames are sturdy. The only thing I didn’t like about the glasses is that they don’t really block a lot of sun which is the whole purpose of sunglasses so it’s a little bit disappointing.
4.0,Grandaughter.... Slightly snug.
4.0,"Decent build quality.  comfortable.  I wear a 10.5 shoe (US) and these fit well, just slightly bigger than a 10.5 i would say."
4.0,Nice gift for my wife
4.0,"The sides of this mask were not tight-fitting enough (maybe just a question of my face shape) and buckled slightly. Again, they may fit better on another person's face. It's very difficult to judge mask sizes (in the past I've ordered KN95 masks that seemed to be for any adult but on me they were far too small! That is not the problem with these.) They do come with an ""ear saver"" back-of-the-head attachment piece which is nice -- I didn't try it out, however, as I was not intending to keep them, so I can't pass judgement on how well that works. I found the nose wire at the top a little uncomfortable on the one mask I tried out. Worth trying out, given Amazon's return policy."
4.0,"Little smaller but exactly what I was looking for. I don't like my arms to show, but sleeveless tops are so cute. Now I can wear them."
4.0,"These are fun,  easy to throw on depending on outfit.  Look nice."
4.0,I was purchased for my mother in law as a gift from the kids and she loved it.
4.0,"Very cute and worth the money, but slightly itchy."
4.0,"Love it!!  Exactly like picture and well made. Gave it a 4 star because this dress runs very small. I'm  5'8 1/2 and about 135. Because of some of the reviews, I ordered  a large...so glad I did!! The large fits like a small and is very fitted. So ladies if you wear a small like I do..you need to order a large!  Hope this was helpful"
4.0,"All but one, unfortunately the only one I was actually purchasing this bunch for, came beautifully. The stones are made with very nice quality, and are beautiful! The opal, which I was excited for, was drilled incorrectly, and tilts to the left on a very jagged angle. I suppose I can still use it, but I now use the obsidian pendant. I was also able to put it on a necklace, which I wear daily."
4.0,I am happy with this scarf. It looks like the photo. The fabric is nice.
4.0,"Very cute shoe, I have a wide foot and usually wear an 8 1/2. Only whole sizes so I ordered up. Couldn't keep them on my feet. Returning but I will order 8 hopefully they fit."
4.0,"Cute inexpensive necklace, looks like the picture.  Lightweight fun jewelry.  I’ve gotten compliments when I’ve worn it."
4.0,"Fits perfectly. The only issue is the spaghetti strap isn't adjustable, therefore I can forsee it loosening after a couple of washes."
4.0,I like them. they fit awkward though
4.0,Overall good slippers for a little boy.  Just wish I would have gone up one size.  Next time I will go up a size.
4.0,They're good for the price.
4.0,Me gusto mucho pero esta un poco grande para ser  mediana llo diria que es L
4.0,It's a bit smaller than expected. Material seems a bit cheap.  But it's really cute and the kiddo loves it.  It's kept her dry so far!
4.0,"I mean, it cost less than 10 bucks and it looks nice so I can't complain too much."
4.0,"A little big on my 2 year old with no way to adjust. But the mask is cute enough for her to want to wear it, so it's better than nothing."
4.0,Perfect combo I love them I want every color
4.0,"I got the hubby to cut off the third and fifth rows, from the top, and then I touched it up with a little bit of black paint.  My long earrings fit just fine now!  Perfect!"
4.0,"I'm sure this kippah is fine.  I don't remember it specifically, which (if you have a lot of kippot in your home), is perfectly fine."
4.0,Very fun to wear.
4.0,Excellent value...
4.0,"I think this top is cute, good to run errands in, or throw on real quick for a walk in the summer. I wouldn’t practice yoga in this only bc it goes everywhere while you’re upside down. The grey was nit what I was expecting but I still like it."
4.0,Cute watch my daughter loves it
4.0,I used this to attach to a crochet purse I made.
4.0,"The babric and the design are nice. The company should provide a chart of the measurement, besides &#34;All in American size&#34;. Because American size can be vary, too. So please provide the customer with your detail measurement. It would help us to order the right size so we will not need to send the merchandise back to you/sellers.<br />Thank you!"
4.0,"The main thing I want to report is that these are not as easy to get on and off as the advertising might lead you to believe. I expected a firm fit. It's FIRM. These are a bit tight at the bottom of the knee/ top of the calf, but I half expected that. (My calves aren't large or typically swollen.) These do the job they're supposed to do, but for people with occasional or more than occasional arthritis in their hands, getting the socks on and off could be a bigger challenge."
4.0,Great addition to a Halloween costume.
4.0,Nice good for 1 summer. Looks a little cheap
4.0,"This nightgown was exactly as advertised.  The pink was a little sheer, but it’s really soft and I like how long it is."
4.0,"Love these. Good quality, a little thicker than I expected but works well"
4.0,Very classy looking and can wear with jeans or dress up an outfit.
4.0,"This is a very pretty beach cover, however it runs very small.  I am 5'8&#34; size 6 and purchased a medium. Didn't feel like returning and my dupaughter in law loved it, so I have to her.  She is about 5'2 or 5'3&#34; and it fit her perfect."
4.0,"They are very nice, but Mosley are the samne colors.  But I will keep therm.  Would like the ones that we had in the ficfty and sixties"
4.0,Nice neck chain for the price
4.0,Im 5’3 and I ordered the US2XL/Asian size 4XL and it fits perfect! It does get a little loose through out the day but that’s not a problem. They’re light weight and comfortable. The only issue I have is that the pocket was not completely sewn but I can easily fix that. Looking to ordering more! 😊
4.0,Very small size for your needs.
4.0,"Comfortable, good buy for me."
4.0,This is a very pretty piece it's larger than I expected I expected it to be smaller than a quarter and I would have to say it's about the size of a half dollar it is beautiful the rope chain that is with it it's just the perfect size for it but it takes a very simple dress to go with it
4.0,"I purchased this as solid cheap watch for work, looks and feels good, but no instructions at all, so hard to guess whats going on, stopped working before i could use it, the 2 buttons operate the display lights, but 05-45 lit up then froze in that state, now it won't do anything, until the battery fails i guess. sad i didn't get to use the watch even for 5mins. so a waste of money for me, as i brought it home to the UK with me.<br /><br />UPDATE: excellent customer service , i emailed them and very quickly they delivered a 2nd brand new watch free of charge, i seriously can not fault this seller."
4.0,I’m 5’2” 130lbs 34dd and purchased a small and it fits as expected. The length wouldn’t work with leggings but I planned to wear with jeans and it hits at the perfect length for me. It’s super duper soft too! For the price I would recommend.
4.0,"I have a job where I bend over all the time.  These no buckle belts are great for keeping the pants up with out biting into my belly.  They even have an attachment so that when I want a buckle, I can have one."
4.0,It’s really colorful and cute. My only concern is the ‘hand wash’ warning. I’m hoping that  there’s no color bleeding and that the white cloud stays white!
4.0,Very nice sunglasses. Fits well and it's very chic.
4.0,"I'm 5'11, 140lbs and I ordered a M, lengthwise it reached right below my calf, so it wasnt as short as I expected"
4.0,Cute cropped hoodie. I returned it because it just wasn't for me but really cute.
4.0,They are sharp looking. It was long but I am short so I tuck the legs under and it looks perfect. My thighs touch so they do make a bit of a swishing sound sometimes. The high waist is great. I dont overheat in them. I powder but it still seems breathable. Overall I defiantly would reccomends.
4.0,"Super cute and fits well its my everyday ring, however after a month or two of wear the black paint at the back has chipped off, but not off the cat. still worth the buy though!"
4.0,Very cute and looks real
4.0,Fit my girls well. There a 6-7 on the size chart
4.0,I have enjoyed this product. They were exactly what I thought they would be.<br />  I wear them when I want a little extra glamour.
4.0,"Love the color.  Cool/comfortable, but not that thick/sturdy.  It's a trade off. Won't last as long as other gloves but good in warmer weather.  At this price, this many pairs will last a while."
4.0,Comparable to very expensive derby hat.I buy all my derby hats on Amazon
4.0,"About what I expected for $18, the face seems to have a plastic cover, only the back is glass? That's about my only complaint, its a pretty cool pocket watch,  comes with a chain, and has a nice box to keep it in. Its not something I would carry every day, only time will tell if this is durable, but all in all I'm satisfied, it would of got 5 stars if the dial face was glass. It is lighter than expected, and probably would break if dropped? I have a lot of watches I paid under $20 bucks for, and this is well worth it, I'm impressed with the skeleton movement, the way its built and its simplicity!!!"
4.0,"Only thing, where we live, it's wet alot. Instructions say can't get wet. So my son son can't wear them very often."
4.0,kept my head warm!
4.0,it takes two people to snap it up but that’s expected. my only problems w/the shirts are i wish they came in tall sizes and the snaps should be the same color as the shirt. i would definitely pay more for those additions if i ever have shoulder surgery again.
4.0,Purchased a 4-6 year old size & it runs Very large. It would probably fit my 8 year old niece perfectly! However it still fits & she can grow into it! Cute and SUPER soft!
4.0,Great fun glasses. Came in record time for delivery. Thank you.
4.0,Earrings are dimmer and somewhat faded in person compared to the advertised photo presented but otherwise are good.
4.0,good way to spend the afternoon
4.0,"I liked everything EXCEPT when I wore it to doctor’s appointment, I had to remove it to get X-ray of shoulder.  THE METAL snaps were the problem!!!  I did not think of that when I ordered the shirt.  If you could find a way to make the snaps a good quality of plastic, you would get 5 stars."
4.0,"These are cute boys pajamas and the shirts glow in the dark, but the material can be itchy for some kids as its not super soft and has thermal shirt like sleeves which can bother some kids who are sensitive to material.  Overall, nice and good price for a set of 4."
4.0,Tight around the chest and ribs area. Nice design.
4.0,"Initially, this coat arrived without the inner coat. I contacted Amazon and a new coat with all the pieces was sent without any problem. Amazon assisted in the return and replacement. The coat is perfect for wind,, rain and snow. The length makes it very warm when outside for extended periods. I wear it for walking in inclement weather."
4.0,"Comfy, but not as flattering as I’d hoped"
4.0,It wasn’t able enough  to cover my chin and nose together but it’s good i like it
4.0,Smaller than it looks but is nice
4.0,"I wish the bust was better form fitting. I'm 5'5&#34; weight 125, 32D bust, 26 waist full figured hips & fanny. I ordered size small. The lacing up takes considerably longer than the removal. The length in the torso is perfect. I cut the garters 6 inches shorter, just to keep my stockings mid thigh, instead of my knee. The lace is remarkably soft, the quality is A+, the fit is a little big for wearing to work, fine for the bedroom. I gave 4 stars because of the ridiculously long garters. I've worn this 4 times, washed twice and recommend this bustier!"
4.0,Fit perfect. I expected one black and one gray.  I got the gray and a dark burgundy.  I kept them but really wanted black.
4.0,"Buttons are a bit far back, kind of difficult to use, and the print is such a weird way. Great for price."
4.0,"well made jacket, warm in winter, price was great for leather, and very well made, this is a 500. dollar leather jacket for low price, anyone would be proud to wear this."
4.0,I do really like the shirt but I'm going to get a size smaller. I got a larger size than I thought I was going to need because I was worried about it not fitting. I shouldn't have worried.
4.0,Ordered these for my cat lover friend.  She adored them! She said they fit great.  Only gave 4 stars due to it taking over 2 weeks to recieve.
4.0,"Super dorky looking but works well. I wish the neck cover was removable, but at this price you can't have everything"
4.0,"Warm, and comfortable - almost perfect PJs.  Just not the most flattering :)"
4.0,I found this bracelet at a store on a vacation and loved it.  I wore it one day though and the magnet clasp opened and it fell off my arm and I lost it.  Fortunately they have it on amazon so I could buy another one.  Now I really keep an eye on it when I'm wearing it.  Just be careful of the clasp opening up on you.
4.0,These goggles were great for swimming laps.  They fit great and the straps did not move while swimming.
4.0,My daughter are using the glass to use the computer bc she’s doing remote learning!
4.0,A little baggy but worked out well for what I needed
4.0,Looks really nice on the ears!
4.0,Super cute.<br /><br />But scratched very easily.
4.0,"They are quite pretty and I like them.If I can figure out,how to bend them abit,to keep them on correctly,they will be even better."
4.0,"This is a great hat for keeping sun off.  It stays on your head well and has a strap to go under your chin if you are In the wind.  I will say the bill is pretty long and if the hat is pulled down tight on your head, you can’t see where you are going. :-)"
4.0,"I was looking for a basic and comfortable dress to wear on a cruise. This dress fit the bill. I am 5'5' and the length is perfect. I love the pockets and the material is super comfy! I ordered it in Navy and it is not see-through. However, I could see that it would be if it was in a lighter color. It will be a great staple for my wardrobe."
4.0,"This thing is really nice and VERY warm. It actually fits over my HUGE head, but the part that goes across the face is too tight for me to wear. (because of the whole HUGE head thing)"
4.0,"Cute! This skirt fit perfectly. It’s a hit wrinkled so I hung it up. If the wrinkles don’t come out over the next few days, I will put in dryer on low setting per the instructions."
4.0,"I like the look of the clip but with several shirt and tie combinations the depth of the clip sticks out too much. From my left side it looks fine, but on the right the clip part is very visible. I have to be careful when taking it off as the teeth on the clip will stick the threads of my tie. Overall, it looks nice but my next tie clip purchase will be for one that slides on. (This is my first tie clip)."
4.0,Cute and nice fabric but it runs like 3 sizes too small.
4.0,"These boots are very cute but not all that comfortable.  They feel true to size.<br /><br />they look great with dark denim jeans tucked in.  I have a hard time finding boots b/c I have<br /><br />large calfs, but these have great spacing."
4.0,"A little smaller than I thought.  I wish the chain was a little bigger, but it does the trick."
4.0,Great pair of sunglasses though they are a bit large for my face (usually buy children's frames).  I use them daily for driving.
4.0,The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the hat is a little small. I had no problem pairing it with my iPhone 6 and I have found it to be loud and clear enough to wear while working in the yard and commuting to work this winter. The only issue is that because it's small it has a tendency to ride up and needs to be pulled down occasionally. Still better than wires!
4.0,"I thought this was a sweatshirt.  But, it's not.  It's a long sleeve t-shirt.  Looks cool.  But, definitely NOT a sweatshirt."
4.0,Pretty dress. Elegant.
4.0,Didn't look so well on the measurements...but they are super cute
4.0,Runs small. Seller was excellent to work with. Refunded purchase due to small size. Skirt was extremely cute.
4.0,it is matching to shirt.  perfect match.
4.0,"Great fit, cute style. Loved that it hides my tummy!"
4.0,"I like this shirt... very cute on, easy to care for. I prefer to hang dry and lightly iron for the best wear and flow of the material"
4.0,"Big and attractive! Very heavy, much more than all my other Protrek watches. Probably not for smaller folks. Silicone band not comfortable on my hairy wrist. Replaced with a lower profile Amazon 24mm nylon strap. Need good tools to unscrew the pins but feels much more comfortable now. Looks great!"
4.0,"hinge breaks too easy, but still got good wear out of it"
4.0,These slippers are extremely cute and very soft. Any girl would be lucky to have them. They are super soft inside and give good cushion to the sole of the foot. The outside is white so I wouldn't wear there outside or they will get super dirty.
4.0,The fabric is shows every curve and dimples.  I recommend a spank be wormed with this dress. The dress is simple but sophisticated!
4.0,"A little smaller than I expected, but still fits all my books and notebooks, so that's all I really needed. Very good material, strong zipper, overall satisfied."
4.0,"Good quality, however, much larger than expected. Bought for my daughter and had to return. No problems returning."
4.0,The toe part is a little narrow.  Otherwise this is good for one season I believe.  Not bad for the price.
4.0,A little smaller than I expected but quite nice none the less. I love it
4.0,"I have a Gen 3 version in the classic brushed silver and black rubber strap. I really liked the aesthetic but when I saw the improvements that Gen 4 made, I wanted to try it out. I thought the green strap would be pretty cool but on the wrist, the color felt a too kiddish for me. The fitment of the band was also very strange. Gen 3 fit me pretty well but the Gen 4 was strangely too loose even on the the smallest setting. However, despite the slight disdain for the the color in person and the poor fitment on the wrist, the build quality and look of the material was nice. If they offered more colors, I might try again, but only if they make the band adjustment better suited for medium wrists (6.75-7"")."
4.0,"Good quality, very cute."
4.0,a little too much pink in hats but great
4.0,"All-poly fabric, good for wicking and breathability for working out.  Quality construction, color scheme accurate; doesn’t fade.  Like all 100% poly clothes, don’t use softeners (dryer sheet ok). Also, since there’s no drop in the front waistband (like most other bottoms), the rise is a little higher.  Unless you have thicker legs like the model shown and are instead leaner like I, these won’t be as snug-fitting as these look in the pic. (I had the bottom hemmed and tapered.)"
4.0,very elegant!
4.0,MY 6YR OLD LIKES IT
4.0,This sweater is very soft and fits very well. I got a L so it would be oversized. It’s just long enough in the front. The sides hang well and don’t make you look big. Would def recommend!
4.0,"Muy Bonita, buena calidad"
4.0,"Great quality and look, small to size."
4.0,They’re really cute shorts! My only problem with them is the tan ones are pretty see through
4.0,Super cute! Held up my large ladies through a long night out in Vegas. The color is adorable and I can’t wait to wear it again. Material is breathable too.
4.0,Love the looks of this item.  It is just not as thick as I anticipated based on the photo. I would still recommend purchasing this item to others.  I gave this to my daughter as part of her college graduation gift.  She liked it a lot.  My son saw it sitting on her vanity and commented on how cool it was.  He is 30 so I was surprised that it caught his attention so much so that he stopped to read it.
4.0,I bought this to transition into fall and today is my first time wearing it. I think it looks great and fits very comfortably! The color is nice and material is very soft. It does wrinkle easily so that’s kind of a bummer but not a deal breaker. As others mentioned it is slightly longer in the front than in the back...but I also have more to cover in the back so that could be the cause of that as well lol. It’s not crazy noticeable though! I see myself wearing this regularly!
4.0,I thought there would be a zipper to get me in the dress so I need someone to help me in it. It’s very long I’m 5”5 and have to wear 5 inch heels and it will just be right off of the floor. Is a beautiful dress I’m wearing to a ball! Great for the price! A big complaint is it’s a magnet for dirt and hair! The top layer kept getting coated with cat hair no matter how much I lint rolled it wouldn’t go away.
4.0,I wanted a nicer band for my Fitbit Blaze to wear when I dress up but I didn't want to buy another Fitbit just yet since the one I have still works well for me.  This champagne gold metal band with frame is perfect! It goes well with silver or gold jewelry and makes my old Fitbit look new. The magnet closer is sleek and works well.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I am having a little problem with the left side button.  It gets stuck in and doesn't always engage.  I have to keep pulling it away from the frame.<br />It arrived quickly and was packaged really nicely. I am very pleased overall with this band and would recommend it!
4.0,For the price its reasonable quality. I am not very careful so 2 broke while taking it off.
4.0,Definitely much bigger than what I was expecting. Rather plain - nothing exciting. Silver in Color.
4.0,"Nice fit , nice price!"
4.0,"This bag is surprisingly handles every thing from tight commuting to speeding through airports. Bag as not let me down in any capacity, works, could not ask for more."
4.0,"I am very self-conscious about my mom body. My second-born child left my waste and hips wider and with a muffin top that I can't make go away. My husband suggested this bathing suit and I thought ""there's NO way I'll be able to pull this off."" But he was totally right! The style of this high waste bottom camouflages my muffin top and mom pooch nicely, way better than those trendy bathing suit bottoms that have full mid- section coverage.<br />It was refreshing to put on a swim suit that doesn't make me prefer just skipping the pool. The only down side I'd note is that I wish I could order the top and bottom as separates. The bottom fit perfectly, but the top was a bit small, so the zipper would kinda gradually creep down if I moved around a lot."
4.0,Comfortable and cute. Wore this jumper to a summer brunch and it was a great fit. The material is a little thin but it's great for hot summer weather.
4.0,"It’s exactly what I was looking for. The material is a bit thin and I’m not sure it will hold up, but o love it and I have this shirt in two colors already."
4.0,"Pretty but was too big. Also the loop around the middle of the bust only goes halfway down, you can see that in the picture.  So it looks kind of weird, why not just go down to the end of the purple.  The material is good, was worried it might be very thin but its not."
4.0,My daughter loves it wish they came in. Two pack since school is starting soon
4.0,Paired this with cute accessories and heels!
4.0,You get what you pay for & for cheap sunglasses these are good.
4.0,Nice 😀
4.0,I am using this large sun hat when in the water for water aerobics. I found that the tie (bow) that is in back can be tightened to make the hat just the right size for your head. The under chin tie secures the hat during physical activity or in windy conditions. Overall I'm very pleased with the hat. It dries very quickly and water beads up on it. There can be a problem with peripheral vision because of the coverage so beware of your surroundings!
4.0,Cute but they kept falling out without a backing - which I felt would make them less cute.
4.0,great quality.... perfect
4.0,I suggest for anyone to order a size up.
4.0,"Wonderfully thick, warm material. Skirt too tiny and too tight, it clings under the back end. Just 11/2&#34; longer & a tiny bit more material on the skirt & I would have bought the rest of the stock."
4.0,Gorgeous. Look very dressy and dainty.<br />White is not snow-white though. It's ecru.
4.0,It's a good top with good quality but it was too small for me.
4.0,Nice concept and creepy mask but repainted the whole thing. Now Looks Even creepier...
4.0,"Looks like the real thing. Very fast delivery, very happy about that. Great for memorial displays.<br /><br />UPDATE 10.8.19; Went to open the packaging today for a memorial display and that's when I discovered that this thing didn't include the mounting bar? Apparently I didn't notice that in the product description. Still, ya think for the price, they could include a 5 cent mounting bar! Or at the very least a link offering one in the ad! Very disappointed about that I have to wait by the mail box tapping my foot waiting for something that should be included with the product in my opinion...5 stars on the medal, less one for no mounting bar."
4.0,Purchased mainly for sun protection
4.0,"these are for my granddaughter and they are a little large, but she can grow into them rather than to return & exchange them."
4.0,Very comfortable but not fitted as picture.  Loose.
4.0,"Beautiful!! Lots of compliments and so fun to wear. I did have to reglue some feathers that came not attached (probably fell off during shipping). I also glued the biggest feather to sit a little differently, so that it wouldn't cover my eye. It was an easy fix, but I was disappointed I needed to at all. Having said that, I would still purchase this."
4.0,"The quality is there but the size is not, too tight for credit cards"
4.0,That’s what she said<br /><br />This bag is a lot bigger than I imagined.  I could fit my current laptop bag inside of this bag.  My current bag is a Joy and Iman tote.  That’s all I really needed.  I want something like my current bag but with wheels.  I’m not going on a trip with my computer.  I’m walking from the parking lot to an office.<br /><br />This bag will fit a computer and an HP 250 portable printer easily.  It is bigger than my current carry on that I have.  It would not be a practice carryon since it would not fit under a seat.<br /><br />I’m going to have to return it because it’s just not what I need.  Otherwise the construction looks good.  It is stiff material.  I got the Caribbean blue/green color which is nice.
4.0,"It’s pretty, and it could fit two passports without passport covers. I thought it would be able to hold passports with covers but was way too small. It fit around my waist fine, but I’m petite."
4.0,"Fast shipping, just wished it offered more colors at this price (that’s why I didn’t give 5 stars). Very comfortable"
4.0,But seriously cute!
4.0,This product is great for people with smaller hands. The “tweezer” part is a little difficult to navigate but everything else is great!!!
4.0,"It's a big bag so I can put a lot of &#34;stuff&#34; in it so it gets heavy, but, I wanted a big bag. Lots of zippered compartments to separate stuff :-) and  I'm going to use it when we fly in March--it's my cheater &#34;carry-on.&#34;"
4.0,"They are beautiful, but are a bit small and pinch a bit at the top of the toes, Other than that, they look fabulous."
4.0,"The reviews really did help with sizing.  I am short and curvy and didn't know if I should get a medium or large.  I am bottom heavy, so I usually have to go a size up.  I went with the medium and I am glad that I did.  It fit really well, a little big so I could have went with the small instead. (The material is VERY STRETCHY, almost like a costume)  Cleavage is really out there.  Alot of people said that they pinned it up and i can see why.  It was still a really nice dress and I am glad that I made the purchase.  Would definitely buy from this seller again!  I may even get this one in a different color."
4.0,These packing cubes are really cute but one of the seams came undone which was very disappointing.  I had to toss that one out while I was on vacation.  It wasn't overstuffed and it still had plenty of room to put more clothing into so please make sure you look at all of the seams on arrival before you use them on your vacation.
4.0,Very versatile necklace. It is light and simplistic. A great layering piece.
4.0,"I like this bathing suit. I didn't know what to expect because I have never ordered a bathing suit without trying it on in the store first. I'm so glad I took this chance. I love the top. Because of the underwire I feel supported, which is usually hard to find in a bathing suit. I like that the straps are removable and interchangeable. You can not wear them, wear them as shown, or cross them at the back for extra support. The bottoms fit as expected and because they are high waist bottoms they hide the tummy areas I'm concerned about.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion."
4.0,I ordered the wrong size.  Product itself is good.
4.0,"The shorts fit even better than I thought they would. They run a little small which was actually perfect for me because I typically wear an xs, but they only carry size s. The material is a little more rough than expected, but overall, I really like them!"
4.0,I got a medium which I normally wear. A little to form fitting than what I expected. Maybe I should of got a large.
4.0,Could be a little bigger but O.K.
4.0,Beautiful dress I got a lot of compliments
4.0,"Love this dress! Very flattering and received many compliments. One drawback, it wrinkles very easily."
4.0,Beautiful leather gloves. I know leather is supposed to stretch and read a ton of reviews but still feel they're tight-ish.
4.0,"I bought a medium thinking it would fit  , the top  fit nicely im at 34D but the bottom (i usually get small) didnt fit it was WAY too tight on my hips , im 5'3 and weigh 130 i think if i went up to a large it would be more fitting."
4.0,Fun piece for my grand daughter to wear. Quality workmanship.
4.0,"I love these earrings! Unfortunately one of them doesn't close as tightly as the other, so I'm always fearful its going to fall out but either way I absolutely adore them! I get complimented on them each time I wear them!"
4.0,"I am a big fan of tortoise shell, and an even bigger fan of cat eye glasses. My only issue is the fact that one lens keeps popping out. It is easy enough to pop back in, but they are definitely $8.95 sunglasses"
4.0,Nice watch looks expensive. My rates are not base on wearing the watch style an looks only
4.0,"Everything fit the kids perfectly. Great items for at home, grandma's and day care. One set was shipped the incorrect size.  So I need to replace that set."
4.0,It’s worth noting the only genuine leather wallets are listed as “genuine leather” in the color selection. The others are not. But I’m happy with it.
4.0,"Arrived on time. It was a bit big, the size I got was small but it still fits and very cozy! I loved it"
4.0,Very cute. Bought for a friend's birthday. The only downside is that it doesn't always stay put.
4.0,"I like the fit, style and fabric but the stripe on the bottom panel is uneven."
4.0,"I have worn Isotoner gloves in the winter time ever since I started driving. I love that they are a substantial glove to keep your hands warm, yet they aren't so bulky as to inhibit finger movement. I also like the grippy bits on the hand and fingers, though I wish they were leather (older styles had this) rather than velvet-like material (these gloves). My only complaint would be that the fingers are on the snug side--almost like a compression fit--not what I expected from a one size fits all glove. I do not have chubby fingers by any means; if anything, my fingers are on the slender size. If you don't mind that, then these gloves will be a great winter staple!"
4.0,"This is a cute and dainty necklace.  This feels like costume jewelry and I expect it to last about one or two seasons due to its very light chain.  It is still very pretty and for a piece to update your wardrobe and be in style, this is a good piece.  It is versatile enough to wear for work or casually."
4.0,"Simple packaging, seems made well enough, breathable! The rubber on the inside is good for keeping the heel in place. I just wish they were a bit longer. I am a size 10.5/11 and feel like they're a little snug. Afraid of what will happen when I wash them. We'll see. Worth trying!"
4.0,My wife likes em.
4.0,nice shoes. great support
4.0,Too small for my wife. Sent back for refund.
4.0,"Prob should have gotten one size bigger, but still pretty awesome looking hat. Chicks dig it. First time I wore it, cute girl insisted on wearing it and have me take her picture in it!"
4.0,"I have a huge head.  I wear like a 7 1/2 or larger cap size.  They fit fine but looked way too small on my face.  Instead of sending them back, I gave them away.<br /><br />The quality and style was good.  Because of this, I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,Larger than I expected. Not a bright green. Mine are kind of an olive green.
4.0,"Nice shirt, great price"
4.0,LOVE IT! This was an early “just cause” Mother’s Day gift from my son. We saw Endgame yesterday and he couldn’t resist the urge to wait till Sunday. It’s super cute! My only issue was the chain. I wished it was longer!
4.0,"I love this dress!  I've gotten so many compliments both times I've worn it so far.  However, it's been washed, and the black has already faded a little.  For the price, I still love it and it was really the perfect dress to wear to a wedding."
4.0,"good deal for what you get, but the watch isnt the most well made, and i dont think it really needed the little ring. im not really even sure if the ring has any actual connection to fullmetal alchemist."
4.0,It's a bit confusing to put it on! But bf loved it!
4.0,"Very comfortable. I ordered two of these--one in XL and one in XXL, and I returned the XXL because the smaller size fit."
4.0,Very cute outfit! They do hang a little off of my feet but that's only due to the fact that I'm barely 5'2&#34;. It felt a little damp for some reason when I received it but a few minutes in the dryer will take care of it. Very soft and stretchy material. It's 5% spandex which means that it fits so great because it's very stretchy. It buttons up at the top or unbuttoned if you want to show a little more. I will definitely wear this with a nice pair of heels whenever I get the chance because it is so cute and so comfortable. It comes with a belt that goes around the waist and makes it look slimmer and your hips nicer. I love it so much! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,This band is beautiful! Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the band is really long. I had to make an extra hole and there's a lot of excess strap left when it's on.
4.0,These are good socks but the box came smashed up. I have the photos.
4.0,Should have an elastic adjuster not cord! This leaves a mark on my sons face not to mention it starts to hurt after awhile. I altered them with elastic and they are much more comfortable!
4.0,"Cute, I got them for my boyfriend and myswlf, we like the look it has a lot of character"
4.0,This shirt is not the rich shade of purple shown in the pictures here. It is just a washed out purple. Also the design is not exactly as shown. Close but not exactly. It fits nicely though and I like it. I normally wear a small but I ordered a medium. Some people had issues with their sleeves I didn't my sleeves for me perfectly just as pictured. 8\10 for color and design differences. Other then that I like.
4.0,I wish these had better coverage around my booty cheeks but they are nice.
4.0,This is a great tunic to wear with leggings.  It is somewhat thin.
4.0,Easy to mix and match with tights or pantd
4.0,"Very nice dress, but does not fit my body right. I am heavy on top,so it's tight on chest and loose on the hips. will be returning."
4.0,Loved every moment wearing these.  Pple assume that it is real.
4.0,"&#34;Pitch Black&#34; is right .even in full sun these guys are DARK . maybe a lil too dark for most folks . very well made hinges and frames .<br /><br />On a side note , took nearly 2 weeks to receive them ."
4.0,"This dress was super cute, but did not look great on my short, round body. The material was very soft. I'm 5' and ordered an XL. If I'd kept it, I would have had to have the dress hemmed about 2 inches."
4.0,Beautifully made and is a great gift.
4.0,I ordered these for a picture size I accidentally ordered in my son's soccer pictures that were too small to do anything with. Everyone love the keychains. Awesome for the value. The only downside is a couple have had the back fall off as it's not very secure but I'll add a bit of super glue next time and will be stay in sure. Really can't be the price.
4.0,"These are absolutely gorgeous. My only issue is that they are extremely delicate and look like they could break really easily. But they're still worth it in my opinion, and I will just have to be careful. I own a lot of bling and these are the prettiest ones I own."
4.0,"I posted a photo with a full-size US Passport in the pocket.  If fit well.  These pockets are bigger than the other brand I have.  The entire short is also both bigger and longer.  I think I like the shorter ones better.  You can see in the photo that the fabric is not thick enough to wear these as shorts.  I doubled them up for the photo so there is no show-through.  I wear these under dresses and love having pockets both for when I have extra cash (or a passport) I want to secure and for when my dress has no pockets.  I would not wear them as shorts although they do look cute with a very short dress.  They have no fabric tag, but I do not believe that they are cotton."
4.0,Appears warm & comfy. Nice material. Gray is as shown. Medium is bigger than chart would indicate. Very loose long legs etc.. Five star except for sizing
4.0,"These glasses are very stylish! I have purchased a few pairs, in all different colors, and the blue is my favorite. Plus I love the carrying case it came with!!<br /><br />Although I love my glasses, they are not what I thought I was ordering. My one and only issue is that these sunglasses don't have a full mirror lens. It's more see through than past sunglasses I have purchased. I would have liked them to be fully mirrored.<br /><br />Other than that, great product! It's made very well, so it will hold up.;"
4.0,"This was a much brighter yellow than I was expecting, but it's still a very pleasing color. This sweater is not soft, though. It's a bit scratchy so I'm going to try to wash it to see if that helps. The arms are also cut a little weird. It does have the cute bell sleeves, but it's like they're tight on the upper arms (near my shoulders) then the poofy bell part is sewn around the elbows, and then the cuff that goes at your wrists is also super tight. The fibers may loosen after a wash and some wear, but it's just a little strange when you first see it. Other than that is a good length and a pretty color. Good to wear to school or the office when you're not outside for a long time, but want to stay warm."
4.0,Very cute and comfortable still holds in the wash and dryer (delicate) so high quality than expected. The neck is lower than expected for the bow so beware but overall very cute
4.0,Runs bigger than expected.
4.0,"good support, comfortable"
4.0,Material too thin but looks good.
4.0,Nice color but is a little heavy
4.0,"Bought for my grandmother in the nursing home, she loves them!"
4.0,"Is a good product so far, I had to buy as I was having skin problems from masks hoping these cotton ones won'tirritate me. If you wash you should iron it because it looses a little its form and they were a little big for kids so I am using them for myself, and bought them a second time."
4.0,VERY NICE GIFT FOR MY 10 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER
4.0,My daughter had to have this.  She is happy so 4 stars.  It is a bit thin and sizing is iffy. She is 5'3&#34; size 6-8 and had to get an XL. Its still very fitted.
4.0,I bought for one of my sons.  He’s 6’5” so clothes can be a challenge to fit.<br /><br />My son said they are comfortable and recommends. He’s received lots of compliments.
4.0,"The glasses were fine. Not as sturdy as brand name, but fine for the price."
4.0,Love my scars! They are large enough to truly wrap your head and quite stylish. My only hang up is that they are really thin.
4.0,It isn’t wash and dry. It’s wash and drip dry. A tee. And it’s really very heavy fabric for a tee. It’s cute though. But it’s super big. I should’ve sized down.
4.0,"Cute little dress, came nicely packaged and protected. Fabric and quality of dress is good.<br />Ruffles look just as pictured! Impressed My grandbaby, as she loves the ruffles!"
4.0,"Definitely size up. Got the XS in brown and the waist and hips were slightly tight, but the legs were way too tight to be comfortable... and my legs are extremely skinny, so I'm not sure who can wear the XS - unless they want a lot of compression. Will be returning the brown ones. I reordered the pink in S and those were much more comfortable, but it gave me a very slight ankle gap even thought the legs were just right. Wish they made the ankles skinnier that the legs, since that's how human bodies are. Also wish they had the brown in a S because the pink is a bit too close to my skin color, and the lighter color shows everything. They're comfortable, but keep in mind you'll be able to see everything, such as underwear lines, your bellybutton, pelvis bone, etc.<br />I made it sound like the product isn't great, but I do like it because of how it's made to fit Asian bodies (shorter length, smaller waist, skinnier ankles), and I'm glad I can buy Korean brands off Amazon. Will be buying their shorts as well!"
4.0,"I like the cute fabric, but when it stretches out...it loses the color.  I don't know what the cartoon characters are saying, because it's in a different language.  However, I love them and I will wear them under shorter tennis skorts for extra flair!"
4.0,I have to give 4 stars because it's much smaller than I thought it would be. Other than that it's beautiful!!! Beautiful craftsmanship
4.0,"This dress is lovely and looks exactly like the stock photos. The wide waist band is very flattering and the print is classic and vivid. This is a lightweight dress (some sort of chiffon fabric with a thin liner attached to the inside) but very flouncy and came delivered without any wrinkles!<br /><br />There were some hanging threads and minor quality control issues with the buttons/button holes, but nothing that wasn't easily fixed with a pair of scissors.<br /><br />My main gripe is that I followed the size chart to a T, because bottom down tops often pull against my bust. I expected to have some fit issues with the waist, but unfortunately the whole thing seems to be sized down a bit from the size chart and while the waist fits perfectly, the bust area is tight and on the verge of gaping.<br /><br />I am a 34G so I am sure this dress would fit a smaller busted girl better. Just size down about 1""-2"" from the size chart for a more accurate fit."
4.0,My 7 year old son loves this thing and gets complements all of the time. The neck is a little small. Hard to take on and off.
4.0,Fits great and it's so pretty and flattering for a woman with curves. Only reason I knock off a star is that the side slits are high! Beware...I discovered this when I sat down at church.
4.0,Still probably the best think I've seen lately no kidding it's cool
4.0,Item is blue. Not black.
4.0,The material is some what thin and of course re extremely long.
4.0,Very comfortable durable I would buy the again.
4.0,I bought the tan colored pants and they are a little see through but I'm sure other colors are fine
4.0,"I love the glasses, but the blue pair had a flaw in one of the temple pieces. They work very well."
4.0,The dress is flattering just a bit too long and I had to tie up so I would not trip
4.0,"This is another favorite shirt of mine. I only have given it a 4star because it is shorter than pictured on the model.<br />I ordered a size up because I am aware of how tall I am and that is not the sellers fault at all.<br />Oh and I did have concerns about how the neck would fit as I don't like feeling of strangulation in my garments 😏But again, was very pleased.<br /><br />I don't have a full body shot of this shirt but wanted to point out the neck in the close up I snapped."
4.0,These do work as advertised but I stopped using them as they would ride up and show
4.0,"I am 5'7, about 130 pounds, 34DDD. I bought a medium. The dress is on the cheap side, but that is to be expected from the price. The medium was too large for me, so I say go a size down if you are looking to buy. Wish I had. I took the sides in about an inch on either side. Turned out okay. Feels a little delicate, I am afraid I might rip it. It is a couple inches too long, but it will do (I don't like super short dresses either). Somewhat see through, will have to wear spanks and a tank under it.<br />Overall, decent purchase. Still wish I had bought a small."
4.0,"These are good, not see through.  They don't stay up great when I run."
4.0,"Earrings were nice enough, just that the drop that the setting provided was too short.  I was trying to get the same type of setting the wife has in gold and these hugged the ear from her piercing while the gold ones have more of a drop and separation from the bottom of the ear.  Partly due to where the piercing is, but just didn't work out.  Probably need to find a pair with a 16mm leverback setting."
4.0,"Love this shaket, I wear it as a jacket out side and in the house when I get a little cold. Only thing I don’t like is the buttons, they rattle 🤷🏻‍♀️"
4.0,"I think these will hold up very well and will not lose their elasticity.  I think someone with thicker wrists might find them uncomfortably tight if worn for very long as they do not have much give or stretch.  I am happy with using them for short jaunts in stores, etc."
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress!  I purchased it to wear to a dance, and I was not disappointed.  I would recommend purchasing a petticoat to go under it.  I didn’t and regretted it.  The dress does have a few areas to of improvement.  The sleeve length should either be a tiny bit longer or shorter.  They came right below my elbows and it was difficult because if I bent my arms the sleeves would go up and the dress wouldn’t lay correctly.  Also, I wish the dress came in an XS.  I am 5’7” and almost 140 lbs, but I’m a size 34 A.  It fit a little loose on top, but it would likely fit ladies with a bigger bra size a little better."
4.0,Used this on a below 40° morning and kept my feet warm. Can't even feel any breeze going in. Haven't tried on a rainy day. The fabric it's just amazing but the stitches on the velcro strap might break at any time. It was sewed in a way that when you pull the strap if not careful you will have the tendency to pull both sides off the fabric.
4.0,"These are great rings. I purchased these for my septum and unfortunately, the spikes are too close together to be able to flip it up inside my nose to conceal it. They don't clear my septum. The thing looks great on me and the spikes are tight, but I won't be able to wear these all the time because I need to be able to flip it up and down whenever I like. Oh well."
4.0,"It is a really pretty dress. Great fabric, perfect length, and stylish. Color was vibrant and lovely. But I ordered a Medium, usually wear a Small-Medium and this dress was far too small. I am giving it 4 stars because it really is pretty and perfect in every other way."
4.0,Pants are so silky soft and a great fabric! But they did take a while to arrive but worth the wait.
4.0,"When you first put them on, they look and feel nice,but after only a little shifting a few minutes of wear, the back part moves up the cut the bum in half and the top squeezes the skin up and over. I'm 5'4&#34; 115 with athletic build. Got a small."
4.0,Great pants but a bit long. Warm
4.0,"Does what it says it will, makes you sweat. I've had better quality and I've had worse, it was a good price and fit well."
4.0,The wallet inserts are a good replacement item.
4.0,"Just what I was looking for, visibility, comfort and price."
4.0,"bought the largest size available, and it's still small"
4.0,"I bought the pink version prior to the black for my Mum who has tunnel vision. She loves the pink, so I bought the black and just in time too as the battery died in the pink after about 6 months. Everyone she meets loves the band."
4.0,It was the perfect size for my 1o year old.
4.0,"Pretty shirt, but lacing at the bottom of it ripped about 1 week/1 wash in."
4.0,A little bit different material than the original but pleased with everything in the package.
4.0,this comes exactly as shown i just didnt find it exactly my style as much as i thought it would be
4.0,Love the Rings!
4.0,"Casual, everyday"
4.0,"Arrived on time, and they are very comfortable and fit just right. Only issue is they say they are customizable, but there is no way to choose the color you want. Got a hold of Amazon, they said the color I wanted would be shipped, but it was not. They need to fix that. Other than that, I would recommend this shop for wedding flip flops."
4.0,I want another. Great to dress down or up. I must get the red one. Lot's of complements
4.0,"They  perform as advertised.  I purchased the correct size but feel a little small would be better.  They slipped a bit from time to time.  Fortunately, I didn't get any abrasions."
4.0,"Had to return. On the short side and since there's not straps I was concerned it would slip down. Material is better than what you would find at a local shop and headband it cute. If you wanna be semi conservative I would size up. I bought a medium 5'3, 135lbs"
4.0,for the price and for the brand I expected better quality like other brands that are in the same range
4.0,Soft and comfy but huge. They look like all terrain house slippers..
4.0,Ridiculous price but it looks like you have to pay it or get a new shade.
4.0,"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my 11-year-old daughter.  She really likes the necklaces, and they are cute."
4.0,"Kind of a tight fit, I don’t have big hands. Strangely tight along the palms too. They work well with a smartphone though and they’re warm."
4.0,"I am 5'3&#34;, 120 pounds. The Medium was too big, I went with the Small. The length is great for heels or a high boot. Not my favorite things I bought, but def a fun boho look. I was expecting a softer, more cotton like material. Mine was a more synthetic , polyester material. I have read review that some materials are different for some."
4.0,"Fits perfectly but had a funky smell that stuck to it even after a few washes. They are also lint magnets, after one wash they no longer really look nice. Really comfortable and warm though."
4.0,"This tassel keychain is very long.<br />I use a small crossbody bag and these tassels are longer than the bag when attached to the handle clip.<br />In addition to the pom, there is a standard key ring and a clip ring.<br />I docked this one star because this looks very cheap when you are close to it."
4.0,These are cute but they are too long for my earlobe.
4.0,My wife is too tall for this Robe.
4.0,Nice - looks like metal - but it isn't. Very lightweight.
4.0,had to order the next size bigger. No problem with the return. Now the wast fits but the legs are short.  I kept them but if I did it again I would get a size 2 sizes biger
4.0,Good fit but a little baggy in legs
4.0,"It is what it is. Not much shape to it, but nice for a long dress. The Price is Right."
4.0,Awesome shirt! I'm prettt normally sized (5'8 and 140 lbs.) It is super cool and elegant. The only part that bothers me is the sleeves because the little hem comes down a bit (think like a button up shirt or flannels sleeves)
4.0,"Good product!  Fast shipping!  I would buy again : )<br />The connectors sort of fell apart after a short while, but from reading reviews prior to buying I sort of expected that to happen.  I replaced the original connecting cord with metal jewelry connectors.  Presto fixo."
4.0,"Cute horns, comfortable to wear. Not too big and not too small. Horns are cute and sparkly. Horns do not feel cheap. Trident is very flimsy, that's why I only gave this four stars. Trident does not feel as high quality as horns, but not low quality either. This is perfect to complete my red devil costume for Halloween."
4.0,Solid ring for the price. Had no issues getting it engraved either. Purchased it as a wedding ring knowing that I probably would not wear it all the time. There is some bulk to it and I could see how everyday wearing might take a bit of time to get used to.
4.0,"I love this dress but I had to use argon oil spray for hair to finally get the static cling to go away. Nothing helped, not even the special static spray. But I adore the funky pattern and I get tons of compliments"
4.0,"Love this reusable face bandana/neck gaiter which also protects your neck.  The only drawback is the ear loops are a little small/too tight, but is guess that's better than too loose if you're wearing it for biking/ high winds."
4.0,Nice fit soft should last washing on gentle
4.0,"This is a good quality bag. I just don't understand the plastic clips.  Everything on the bad is classy and well put together.  Then, huge PLASTIC CLIPS!!  The pic really doesn't show how much of an eyesore they are.  Really bummed.  The search continues."
4.0,"Cute pants, thin material but comfortable. Only complaint is it fits percent in the waist but is a bit large in hip area so it is a bit baggy in the back but I can fix with safety pins"
4.0,it seems each style is somewhat different in sizing so take the time to read the reviews before ordering. but I have to recommend the line I really like the quality
4.0,Nice fabric but too baggy. Makes you look pregnant. Sent back.
4.0,The material is nice and smooth. I didn't expect the white blank canvas on the other side but it didn't matter much.
4.0,"My 8 year old loves Apex. It doesn’t stretch as much as I would like so it might not fit him by next year but other than that, good purchased"
4.0,What I expected for the money - nice shirt
4.0,"colors are great, fit is flattering.  great casual look with comfort."
4.0,These are great - used them for a monster truck show and it really kept the sound down. I now use them for mowing to keep from destroying my hearing. Would give them a 5 star but they are a little bulky.
4.0,"Cute and cool summer day dress!  Easy to care for.  On a previous order, which included pants and a top, the owner was kind enough to email me to ask specific measurements to ensure a good fit.  I was most impressed and will certainly buy more Mordenmiss in the future!"
4.0,Dress looks nice on but it is on the thinner side.  Does not appear to be see through so that's a plus.  I did purchase two colors.  Worth it in my opinion.
4.0,"Wish it came with more filters, it’s ok, I can’t breathe in masks and I was hoping this one would make that easier but it’s ok for breathing"
4.0,"A very cute mask, colorful with great comfort. Only down side is it's fairly large, so if you have a smaller face it is a little too big and will ride directly under your bottom eye lid."
4.0,I did not like that I expected the dress to be gold but it was more black than gold and I had to switch my entire birthday outfit. However when i tried it on it did fit great
4.0,"Excellent fit, quality, and color. The design is very cute. I am just bothered by the fact the price tag attached to the shirt was $3.00 cheaper than what I paid. What's up with that? Either way I'd pay it again for this T-shirt, as I am very picky about them."
4.0,"I love the light-weight texture. The color and details look just like the picture. I ordered an XL and it fits well. I’m a size 12 jeans, large top,  and 14 dress. I bought it for a summer wedding. The buttons pull a little at the chest, but I plan on fixing those with some darts."
4.0,"There was nothing wrong with it but my husband said it looked a bit like a hospital gown when i tried it on. Maybe it was the dark mint color. I hate to give it a poor rating because it is exaclty as advertised, but it just didnt look awesome on me. If you have a hot body like the picture i bet it would look great.<br /><br />I hope this review helps. If so, please click the &#34;Yes&#34; button below. Thanks!"
4.0,Navy not black ! Still cute and not itchy
4.0,The pants weren’t the same as the picture. The picture has white strings but it’s fine they fit me on my waist so it’s okay
4.0,Very nice fitting and colorful
4.0,The only issues I’ve experienced is that it’s a little tight in the chest area and the zipper is kind of cheap and seems like it could easily break. But it’s doable and it is very flattering!
4.0,just as expected - just like the photo. Quality is good for the price!!!
4.0,"It's really comfortable and DOES give you nice cleavage. However, it made my boobs look flat. I usually wear a 34B. My band size is actually about a 35, so I usually size down to a 34, or my bras don't stay down (flat chest problems). I probably should've gone with a 36C. Maybe my boobs wouldn't look so flat!"
4.0,Instructions are easy to follow and the magnets generally hold the desired band tightness well.
4.0,"I had a similar dress in a medium and it shrunk when I washed it on cold and lined dried. So I sized up to a large (5'7, size 6 dress) and it is generously sized but should fit after a wash. Mellow colors and great for lounging around or running errands."
4.0,"They were cute, but had thought they were going to be a bit bigger (was planning to use them for keychains). I used them for different jewelry instead though and they worked well for that."
4.0,"We ordered this for my husband to replace his plain wedding band. He's been wanting a black titanium ring, and loved this design and that it was so different.<br /><br />His narrow wedding band was a 9 and he ordered a 10 in this because it was so much thicker. Wished it came in half sizes because it was a little loose on him but not enough to be a problem.<br /><br />Great price, shipped fast, we both love it!"
4.0,"Great looking dress, but it runs very small. Bought a large for my daughter who is a medium and it was too tight to zip the size zipper up. Ordered an XL which fit snuggly and looked fantastic."
4.0,"These are really cute. However they show cellulite really bad. if you do not have that issue though these would be perfect for you. Also, they make you really hot like they don’t breath. You can see sweat stains from under my butt cheeks in between my thighs and backs of my legs as I’m working out and start getting hot and my other leggings do not do that. I’m 5”4 and weigh 140 and got the large and they fit great."
4.0,"My favorite dress of the summer. It’s super light and soft. The pockets fit an iPhone 7+. It doesn’t look great with the weight pulling it down, but it fits! I usually wear it with a belt, and wearing a bra with it gets a little showy. But all of that is just part of that boho look. I’m 5’6” 175lbs and I bought a large. The straps are adjustable."
4.0,"soft, warm, chic"
4.0,Very Decent quality. Except! The button. Every movement unsnaps the button. And it drives me insane.  Please alter that. Love the thy pocket. Needs a few more spots like that one to quickly set a pair of channel locks or an adjustable wrench.
4.0,"I didn't give these gloves five stars because the lowest setting (blue) seems to be the same heat as the highest setting (red). No difference. My fingers do stay warm though. I would like the gloves to get a bit warmer. If I lived in a much colder area, the gloves would not keep my fingers warm enough. I like the fact that I can get the gloves on and off easily. I live in north Texas and we don't usually have multiple days of glove-wearing cold weather, so I don't wear the gloves that often. After about six uses for 40 minutes at a time, the battery is spent."
4.0,Great material and Fit. But I went to large size since previous one was too small for me and still small. I'm a regular medium.
4.0,"These are thin water shoes. If that's all you're expecting, you won't be disappointed."
4.0,"I haven't gotten to swim in it so I'm not sure how it holds up there.<br />I can say that it's true to size.<br />No real bust support so not good if you're large in the chest.  If you don't care to have your boobs squished to you then it should be fine.<br />I ordered the size 20.. it fits like it should. I'm 5'8&#34; 240 ish and wear an 18/20 in jeans and a 2x top. I'm 44-46 B if that helps.<br />I gave it 4 stars because it is slightly cheap feeling but not too bad. The bottoms need about an inch more coverage for the legs (I could see my butt cheek, it wasn't a full moon though haha)<br />Oh and the lack of bust support..What's in there reminds me of the tank tops with shelf bras...Doesn't hold crap!  Eh. I will keep it and see how it does..<br />Oh the top comes down to my pubic bone and hides my pooch!  Yay.. it's not too baggy either."
4.0,These glasses are super cute and look like a kiddie version of my Ray Bans. My son loves wearing these because they look like mommy's glasses. He's put his grubby fingers all over the lenses and tugged on the arms and they've still held up nicely. Definitely also a plus that they came with a case. Highly recommend these!
4.0,"I like it a lot but it is not gold, it is copper orange color."
4.0,A little large but good pair of shorts.
4.0,Fit great hugs in all the right spots
4.0,"The small was a tad large, but I took it in and it's perfect."
4.0,This is supposed to a cold weather rainproof coat. It is only a standard rain coat with no way to make it cold weather proof. That aside it fits well and works very well as a rain coat.
4.0,I’m sure the rubber bands will deteriorate way before the hat stretcher.  Where do I get new ones?
4.0,This was on daughter's wish list so I ordered it. It looks and feels flimsy so I am not sure how it will hold
4.0,My coworkers loved it and it received lots of compliments.
4.0,I really like the weight of these socks. I think they will be great when the weather gets hot.
4.0,Loved the print but it was a bit big.
4.0,"You cant beat such a cute necklace for under $2!!! It did tarnish the first week I had it but now it just looks gold. I still get compliments on it all the time! For such an inexpensive price, Ill just order another one if needed."
4.0,"VERY quick, I was suprised. Object is pretty much what you see is what you get. I am a traffic signal designer and it is my keychain. I bought several because they were so cheap and gave them as little gifts last December to co-workers."
4.0,"A bit harder to put on than The Malinese, but decent enough.  I suppose one benefit is that you can’t over-tighten it."
4.0,Love these! The are so cute!
4.0,"To be honest i was kinda scares, i mean, i just bought a product from China with no reviews or anything... It was to my surprise when my item came almost 2 weeks before expected, a great looking, perfect sized bag. No complaints at all about is. Is perfect for the prize."
4.0,its  bigger than i though it was gonna be but i still like it :) wear it all the time
4.0,"Ok, the lower pole seems less heavy and weaker than the one I replaced. It also seemed to get scuffed in installation. That seems a little unfortunate. The last umbrella I had, used dual paracord pully. This seems to only have one, that being said, this one seems to weigh less than the last one. So hopefully the single paracord will hold up. The tie also seems a little small and weak for the amount of wind. I think overall it is a nice middle of the line patio umbrella. I took away one star for the less sturdy lower support. The last one also had a hole in the bottom to affix the base and lower support, which this one lacks."
4.0,Got these for my wife who normally wears a 7 or 7.5.  The 8 fit perfectly and the shoe was very comfortable and stylish.  Tons of compliments and perfect for a night of dancing. She will buy Fluevogs again!
4.0,"These make the earrings feel fairly secure, but I'm not sure I would leave my good earrings in overnight or for multiple days in a row using them.  They may be fine, but because they are not that hard to take off, and there is no latch (or other mechanisms) needed to remove them, I'm not sure I would risk it.  I do feel fine wearing my &#34;regular&#34; earrings with these when I go to work or out in the evening."
4.0,"I like these but they are not compression tops. I ordered small and they are more of a relaxed fit. I am thin and athletic build 32 DDD 27"" waist. Order down if you want tight."
4.0,Cant wait to start wearing it
4.0,"Super thin and transparent, could be made better"
4.0,Very cute! bottoms were a little small.
4.0,It's cute. love the necklace that came with it. fits great. I get lots of compliments every time I wear it
4.0,Love love love the shirt
4.0,Great value and very cute. A bit cheaply made but very low price
4.0,Nice sleep wear
4.0,This dress is really cute! It fits great and is actually the color I expected it to be.
4.0,These will be great for biking and around the house I have not been disappointed yet by the product.
4.0,"I like this shoe, but couldn't really tell if it would be comfortable or not because it was too small.  Returned."
4.0,Love the options and pricing. Would have liked them to not hang as much as I have thinner lobes.
4.0,"Excellent, prompt service. A good product; I will be wearing this around the house, running errands, etc. Unfortunately, it is see-through, unlike the longer skirt item; it doesn't ride up, it doesn't cling. Very comfortable. . Also, it runs small. I usually wear XL but, having read other reviews, I ordered 3XL, and it was a perfect fit. No washing instructions at all. Why?"
4.0,I have loved this cardigan. The only problem is that the fabric pills up a little. Still love it. It's worth buying a new one when the old one gets too bad.
4.0,"It's definitely a novelty item, but it is so stinkin' cute!<br /><br />It's a little too large for the little boy I put it on (I forgot to take a picture). But that is okay, it rained earlier today and then got a little chilly. The hat fits okay and the booties are a little too big, but the baby isn't walking yet so they are really socks at this point. The price is $9 on Amazon, hence why I called it a novelty item."
4.0,perfect gift for niece
4.0,"They look great on me, but SO HARD to remove or click closed."
4.0,Very good wallet
4.0,It’s a cute skirt but I need to get rid of a little of my stomach for it to look great on me. Good material and it’s stretchy.
4.0,Good quality and price but had to buy size 12-14 for my 8.5 year old daughter and was almost fit to her although she's an average size girl
4.0,Good product but I like my Bontrager version a lot better.  These are half the price.
4.0,Everything was super cute and soft. Bought for our petite 9yr old and the gloves fit IF we roll the wrist part
4.0,I ordered X-Large I normally wear large to X-Large..they were a little tight. Should have order a size bigger. But they  still kept me warm!
4.0,The pockets ripped out after a few days of wearing the coat other than that it's a comfortable coat keeps you warm and dry in the rain!
4.0,It arrived with a small stain and got a big crease during shipping but other than that it’s super cute. Hopefully I can get the stain and crease out. lol considering it was very expensive
4.0,"Much larger than expected. Needed them to be about 1cm, but these are more like an inch."
4.0,We really like the look and feel of these goggles. My daughter could even wear her glasses with them. I have to say that the anti-fog part was just okay. They were worn for snow skiing and they did the job! For the price I would certainly order them again!
4.0,I should have gotten a size smaller...if you think you would get a large I recommend a medium.<br />Only negative the buttons and button holes are small. If you lose a button might be hard to replace.
4.0,Nice boots. Good quality. Had to return because the shaft was too large.
4.0,son geniales pero el resorte de la cintura apreta muchisimo
4.0,"Very cute, lightweight fabric"
4.0,It’s very slim and looks good just like I wanted
4.0,[[VIDEOID:47dbdd65b28b1ba804542790b6bcd0]] This hat is a good buy! Very warm and fashionable.
4.0,I love it. Everybody that sees it likes it. It looks vey nice. Good for the discounted price I bought it.
4.0,"You can hear but when sudden loud noise, it muffles sound. As such, my son is afraid it won’t work when hunting."
4.0,It is elegant and functional
4.0,"I reordered this in a size 3x up my normal size. It is a VERY cute and flattering suit, but it's still a little small. I'm keeping it anyway hoping if I lose some weight it will fit better. I have a very long torso so one piece suits are hard for me anyway.<br />Other than ordering up a few sizes, it's still a great suit. The color and lace work really well together. Makes boobs and butt look great! The mesh goes right across my belly button which is a little strange feeling but it still looks fine!"
4.0,I love this shirt except for the fact that the sleeves fit too tight.
4.0,Wish the material was softer only because I use it as a lounger and 😴
4.0,It's both too small around the thighs and too large around the butt :(
4.0,"It's somewhat large but maybe it's because I have a small head. The adjustable strap in the back is velcro and I've had to drag it halfway across to fit my tiny head. It looks great, i bought it for a basic Halloween costume but I'm afraid to wear it out in public because I'm not a certified life guard..."
4.0,"Really plastic, but good quality"
4.0,Beautiful earrings.  Look expensive.  Wore to wedding.  Very pleased with them.
4.0,Comfortable and adjustable...would by again
4.0,Looks great on my wife. She actually likes it better as a necklace than a bracelet.
4.0,"I love this bag! It is the perfect size and very stylish. Can be used as a handbag, or an over the shoulder tote to carry all of your daily essentials. Unfortunately, the straps started to wear down after a month of use and then completely fell apart shortly after that. The insurance plan offered with the bag fully reimbursed me, so I will be purchasing another one just like it."
4.0,I love the skirt but it is way too long. I will have to take it to be shortened...hope that can be done. But it's beautiful.
4.0,My husband's new favorite shirt!
4.0,"I really love these earrings, but after a couple times being shoved in my pocket, the red paint on the outside of the beads began to chip revealing their clear plastic interior. If you do wind up getting these, be sure to be careful with them."
4.0,"Fit is nice, washes and dries with no wrinkles which is a big plus for me.  Has a small side zipper which helps give you a little more room to get it on and off."
4.0,Love this hat. A bit wide though.
4.0,This dress fits great.  The sleeves were a bit boxy but I have worn a blazer over it so it was not an issue.  I am 5'2 127 pounds and the small fit perfect.
4.0,looks exactly as picture but it is a little less sturdy than described
4.0,I just wish it was a bit longer.
4.0,Loved how these looked. They came in their protector and everything. Super cute.
4.0,"I love this dress!!! The material is cool and soft and very stretchy. I love the sleeve length and overall dress length. It has some weight to it in your hands but feels so light on. It seems to be pretty well-made. I almost gave this dress five stars but took off one for a few very minor reasons. The material is on the thin side. It doesn't feel cheap, but it does show lines underneath. Also, I think it runs a bit large. I usually order things bigger than I would buy in the store because these lovely affordable items online tend to run small and are cheaply made. This one I ordered in the size I usually buy in person because it seemed like it was more true to size, but I think it is actually quite generous in the sizing. I will definitely be ordering one in another color but the next size down. That brings me to the actual color. I ordered the mustard yellow color. In person I think it's a little less vibrant yellow and more mustard colored. That worked out perfectly for me since that actually made it a better match to the LuLaRoe leggings I wanted to pair it with, but I thought it was worth noting the difference in case somebody is looking for something closer to the color in the photo. It is a really beautiful color and I love the feel of the fabric. It makes for a great substitute for the LuLaRoe Carly dress and has the added perks of having pockets! This dress is really a great value and I would love to see it made in even more colors and maybe some prints."
4.0,"Great style swim trunks, very nice material but they run very large."
4.0,La tela muy suave muy buen producto.<br />Solo me quedo un poco largo.
4.0,I didn't want to spend much for a glass case to protect my backup readers. So I need three and a reasonable price! These are great for my needs! As describe. Sturdy case and nice thick quality cleaning cloth! Recommended 💯
4.0,Very cute romper but runs way big. Order a size down.
4.0,"It's a great costume but it fits me too big from the waist and bust so I look like I have a no waist and a big tummy. I'm 5'4, 139lbs., and medium build. I ordered medium because this costume was coming from overseas (UK) and I knew I probably wasn't going to return it, so I figured I'd order a size bigger so it can be taken in if need be. I wished I had gotten my usual size small (6) to avoid alterations but oh well. Anyways the arm cuffs are way too big. They just slide right off, so I need to alter those. FYI the head piece is not plastic but it stays up and looks good either way. I had no issues with the cape or the boot covers, they looked and fit great. I also like that it isn't too short and comes right above my knee. I have to keep it family friendly! The shipping did not take as long either. The estimated date of arrival was between October 30 -November 11th.  I ordered it on October 2nd and received it twelve days later, so I was happy about that. Overall it's a cute costume at a great price."
4.0,"The item itself is meant for cosplay but it’s a bit heavy and I personally struggled to adjust the strings and hold it in place to fit it onto my face. The size of the item to me personally is small. So in other words, it’s great for home/room decor but really nothing else lol. At least for me personally."
4.0,I purchased to use as compression hose and they are very comfortable for my sensitive legs.
4.0,Well made shirt. Excellent colours
4.0,"Good functional mama hat, but no matter how I try I cannot look remotely cool in this thing."
4.0,"This was thinner than what I expected in terms of material. So, I caution potential buyers that this is not thick enough to provide some sort of insulation. I got this for my lady because our fashion designers think women are partial to Marvel characters....even male ones. This was a great fit for my lady. It's loose, light, and sexy. No complaints here really. She loves it."
4.0,"My friend gave me her old vivosmart HR activity band and so I ordered this new band. It gives the ""watch"" a facelift and looks really nice. I thought it was going to be a clasp that holds the band around your arm like in the product picture, but it's actually a magnetic clasp. It's fairly strong, so I'm not worried about it coming off. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because if you see in the third picture the button is sunken into the case and not sticking out like it did in my previous case. Other than that I mean for the price it's a great deal!"
4.0,"These are very soft inside and warm. They did stretch as I wore them, and now fit a bit big even though I followed the sizing instructions. I don't mind too much and wear them daily."
4.0,"The fabric is a little thin, but overall it’s a nice piece for the price. Perfect for a night out"
4.0,These fit well but are really long.
4.0,The price was right but the earrings were “wearable” after trimming the ends to be even. You get what you pay for!!!!
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Thin, silky material."
4.0,"A bit thinner than I expected, in regards to material, but the fit and color are more or less as advertised."
4.0,"Great shirt! But has a minor downside that at least mine has a lot of strings, other than that it's awesome!"
4.0,"Smaller than expected, doesn't hold full size toiletries like shampoo bottles. Nice quality though"
4.0,"A little big, I would size down."
4.0,"it was good fit, it was just the shoulder longer 3/4 both sides and hanging on my arm a little bit of alteration needed so thanks I am happy with it."
4.0,"While these fit smaller than expected, their customer service was amazing with handling everything to make sure I was happy! They’re really quick with the responses too!"
4.0,It was way smaller than I expected.
4.0,Nice necklace so far have worn it for 2 weeks will update in a month to see how the gold last
4.0,"So, this band is pretty awesome. It’s light weight, and very comfortable. I’ve been using it pretty consistently since I got it and it’s worked great. It hasn’t broken yet, and it’s been a month of consistent use. It’s probably the most comfortable band I own for my watch at this point.<br /><br />My only complaint and why it doesn’t have 5 stars, is because when you install it into the watch, it looks like it doesn’t click into place completely? The watch band hands off the sides of the actual Apple Watch a bit? It hasn’t gone anywhere and stays where it’s supposed to, it hasn’t slid off while I’ve been wearing it, but it does hang off the edges just a little. That’s not enough to make me not use it though, it’s worked perfectly. And I’ve been wearing it consistently for like a month or so."
4.0,This gown is very nice for the price however it runs VERY SMALL I normally wear an XL but due to other reviews I ordered a XXXL it barely makes it around my chest very tight 😳 I’m hanging out everywhere. The fabric is lovely and it seems to be made well. Nice an thin for hot summer nights.
4.0,"It’s a little longer & more bright than I expected, but over all it’s a nice dress. Fabric isn’t flimsy, and it’s  easy to take care of."
4.0,"These boots feel like they run a full size smaller than they are listed. I normally wear a size 11.5 US. So that was what I ordered. Sadly my toes were jammed into the toe of the boot liner which became worse when I wore the liner in the boot.<br /><br />On the positive, they are very nice looking and high quality snowboard boots. I am returning these for either a size 12 or 13, because there was no 12.5 US size available."
4.0,Bought for a grandson and he was happy with it.
4.0,Great colors on the bracelet.
4.0,Good compression and feel. There are a few loose threads so I’m hoping they last and don’t fall apart. Will update if they do.
4.0,"This definitely is more of a scarf than a shawl, based on the pictures I thought it would be wider.  The fabric feels really nice and is very good quality"
4.0,Had my Fitbit 1 year when the band broke.  I have had replacement bands that would not snap in well on other fitbits so I was leery.  I cleaned the ends of my fitbit and the band snapped right on in a way that seemed quite secure.  I've worn it a few days and have taken it on and off check to check if the band is on securely.  I am quite happy with how it looks/feels.  It is better looking by far than the original black band.  I have no idea how well it will last but I am happy with appearance and how it feels on my wrist.  I like having a choice between the pink and black leather bands.  I have a fairly small wrist and there was only one hole available to go tighter so it might be a problem for someone with a particularly small wrist.  The long end is not an issue because it has the 2 keeper loops.  It had 8 additional adjustments for larger.
4.0,"I thought it was more like a purse, I use it going over night and holds my electrics."
4.0,"These Anti Blue Light Blocking glasses are very cute and stylish. They fit my face well and they are comfortable. I’m able to wear them all day without them hurting me. I really haven’t noticed much of a difference in wearing them. It comes with a card and light to test how much blue light gets through, but that’s about the only thing to verify if it’s working. I guess it’s something you can see long term benefits from."
4.0,"I ordered a medium and it's WAY to big. I was shocked, next time I will order a small.  But they are so comfy, I feel naked. I wear these to sleep without pj's. So comfy. Gonna get diff colors next time"
4.0,It was puurfect
4.0,"Well constructed, sharp clear lenses, just a little bit tight with the frame contour. Still a great value."
4.0,very cute. somewhat small
4.0,I love these slippers are super comfy. I have hard wood floors and it was killing my feet. So I ordered these and my feet no longer hurt. Only problem I have is they are big on my feet. I wear an 11 and they are so loose it's crazy but overall I do love them and that's all that matters. I gave them a  4 because of the sizing.
4.0,It’s tight and has Uv protection
4.0,Fit perfect / Right north american size
4.0,These are literally perfect except for the fact that they will hurt if you wear them for too long but that will happen with every magnet product you find :) I 90% recommend this product.
4.0,"I don't recall the price but I remember it being very reasonable.  I wear a large in most shirts but like a hoodie to be a little big and the XL was perfect for me.  It's roomie like I want it without being ridiculously long like some XLs are on me.  Overall I recommend this sweatshirt.  I do not, however, recommend anyone rooting for IU unless you just don't have enough stress in your life."
4.0,cute but unfortunately baby still slips with them
4.0,"Only wore once, so I don’t know how durable they are but they are really pretty."
4.0,Slightly big for my 4 year old
4.0,Really cute dress but was cut kind of small.  I had to return it.
4.0,Not at allllllllll winter gloves for Maine. But the first pair I've ever had that actually do allow you to text in. Very cute and fit well. Have held up better than expected even through throwing down salt and snow removal.
4.0,"Well made shirt. Just fit larger than expected. Told my son, he's just gotta bulk up."
4.0,Love these for riding and with regular street boots too
4.0,I bought this for my grandmother because all of her jewelry was stolen.. She absolutely loves it and receives compliments on it all the time. Only thing is the rings shift a little bit and dont necessarily sit how they should.. but you cant beat it for the price.!
4.0,My wife loved this!
4.0,Still a little small. I first ordered the 1X-2X and they were snug. I then ordered the 2X-3X and they are snug in the waist.
4.0,"These are great for gardening, but just know they will not protect you from prickers.  Those suckers go right through with no resistance.  These were great to have on my hands when I accidentally found a baby snake in the garden!"
4.0,"The color was beautiful. The watch face was much bigger than expected, and the watch band was huge! I had to take it and have 4 links removed. If you’re a smaller person this watch is not for you. Overall, I like it a lot and will definitely wear it."
4.0,The material was not what I expected but was happy with the feel of it over all happy with my purchase
4.0,"It's ok, i expected it would be much more slouchy. It's pretty stiff. When my boyfriend wears it, the beanie literally sticks straight up in the air. Also, I understand its a branding thing, but it would probably be much cuter if it didn't have that Sport label sewed on to it."
4.0,As previous people said these do run slightly large which is great for layering. The coat is warm seems well made looks good and is comfortable
4.0,not at flaring as expected but looks really nice!
4.0,Fits a bit larger than expected. Order size smaller. Works well. No issues with smell stated in other reviews. If you're on the fence with sizes order the smaller one. Works well during exercise.
4.0,A bit larger than anticipated but looks good.
4.0,Not so comfy and a little small
4.0,The outfit is cute but way too big for my daughter. I got her a XXL she is 5'3 140 lbs and it was big. Going to reorder a LG in hopes it fits better
4.0,I like the art work. Masks run smaller them I thought.
4.0,Very comfortable.  Nice flat buckle.  Buckle catches on belt loops a bit (I'm sure that will not be an issue with practice putting it on and taking it off).  It looks great!
4.0,I have 6 year old twin grandsons so I bought these to take up with me when we visit before Halloween. They love getting all holiday jammies. They haven't tried them yet but they look like they will fit well and are nicely made and a good weight. They will want to wear them right of way so already washed them and they came out fine
4.0,"I’m trying to decrease my plastic footprint.  But the bags are plastic, since they are reusable I guess I am still doing so.  The bags are great, heavy duty, large.  Even the cashiers like them because they are easy for them to load.  I am very happy with them."
4.0,"Cute, ok quality for the price. For as expected."
4.0,A little thicker than I wanted but had a pendant that it works with so I will keep it just for that one.  Awful pretty and sturdy.
4.0,A little less attractive in person than online.  The material seems to stretch out of shape a little.
4.0,"This swimsuit was very cute and I debated whether or not to return it. In the end, I did send it back, because the top gaped a little too much in the middle and I feared an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction on a water slide. It fit pretty much true to size, but the triangle cutout in the center of the top piece is wider in person than it appears in the picture. Boyfriends may like it, but it'd be risky with any active swimming."
4.0,"I thought it was a little larger than it turned out to be, would have like to have been able to use it to carry my computer.  Otherwise it is perfect.  Nice quality, pattern looked even better in real life.  Nice pockets in side, very much like the latch and over all appearance of the bag, had a nice over the should strap as well.  Guess I should have just been more attentive to the size"
4.0,It's a little tight but seems like excellent quality and it looks just like the picture which I was super happy about.
4.0,"I purchased this as a bathing suit cover-up. Cute and very vivid color. Very slightly frayed on the bodice.  It falls above my knees and I like the way the fabric flows on the body. I'm 5'6&#34; 175lbs, I purchased the red in X-Large, it looks like neon orange and it fits a little tight on top. I'm keeping it because I'm going on vacation, but I don't think it will last in the wash."
4.0,Work well!!
4.0,For quality I give a 4/5.  The red material is not the softest and of course you want soft materials for your baby. The fit was as expected. Everything is as pictured.
4.0,"It’s so cute, a little tight around the arms, but I’m not a tiny person either 😝"
4.0,This bathing suit is so cute and vintage! At first seeing the top was white that it would be see through but it isn’t at all. It fits to size and is a slightly thin material but it is great for its price.
4.0,I really like these but they were way too long for me. I have a short neck and these just laid on my shoulders....I gave them to my daughter..They fit her better....
4.0,Están cómodas pero se rempen de las orejas
4.0,"This was a gift for a friend of mine and she absolutely loved it! It is not overly stylish IMO but smart looking nonetheless. The pockets are deep enough to stash your goodies without fear of things falling out, as well as keeping your hands warm. It is on the short side where it rides at waist level; it is very much bomber jacket length. The hood is a nice touch for those blustery winds that inevitably strike at the most inopportune of  times. The cuffs are very nice to keep the elements out. Although not water proof  as a rain jacket, it is water resistant so if you get caught in the rain it will suffice temporarily.  It is a everyday, go most anywhere jacket to keep you warm on cold days. That said this is not the jacket to pack for a trip to the mountains, unless you'll be staying in the cabin and venturing out only to the balcony. I don't believe this is a jacket to be used in extremely cold weather , such as in the Midwest, or say, New York or east coast in the winter. Fall weather maybe. It works perfect here in Southern California , where winters rarely get below 40 degrees. I live in San Diego and it is perfect for the mild winters here. This casual jacket is perfect for outdoor activities such as walking the dog, hiking or out and about running errands in mild winter climates. I would recommend this jacket for most everyday use, so long as it is not below freezing."
4.0,"These operators are much better than the plastic geared ones. The installation for retrofit can be troublesome as the hole pattern is not the same as the kind that comes with the shades. The mounting pattern is so close that drilling new holes in the wall is too close to existing ones and would make the mounting weak. Filing the bracket slots wider is best, but time consuming and then washers are needed which do not come in the package. Once mounted these work great."
4.0,"A great watch, a great price. The display is clear and easy to read. There are only three buttons, but they have to the job of four and that can be annoying. The alarm is loud and clear, and the controls take some getting used to, however they are fairly intuitive. The light doesn't work great but it does the job. This a fairly priced, good, convenient watch."
4.0,"Overall, I like the dress. The criss-cross at the bust area is a little tight, it makes your breasts look smashed instead of supple and perky. The fit is perfect and so is the length."
4.0,The description could be better - these came up in an over-the-glasses search and reading the narrative on the product it was not clear that these are just regular sunglasses...which is why I put too small for what I wanted.<br /><br />But they arrived undamaged and are really super cute if you love bling...these are for you!!
4.0,"I really like this dress. It’s super cute. It looks kind of sporty but I feel like I can wear it for a lot of different things. I honestly don’t go out very much lately and also I live in Florida so I can only wear long sleeves during winter. I am glad that the air is getting a bit cooler so I can wear this more often. I love that it has pockets and a hoodie. It just looks very cute. It also fits great and is super comfortable. I think I’ll be wearing this often when running errands this winter. I have no complaints so far. I’ll have to see how it passes the test of time. If I find any issues, I’ll come back and update my review. Until then, I would recommend this. The price right now is $30 and I think it’s well made and definitely worth the price. Make sure to get the right size by checking the size chart."
4.0,Super cute! But run a bit small! Perfect for cosplay. But are a bit see through!
4.0,Beautiful....well done
4.0,"I loved everything about this top, the color was as pictured and the fit is true to size.  I received a ton of compliments on it."
4.0,"I like this, kind of frumpy, but if you wear it with the right thing can look cute."
4.0,It is super short mannnnn
4.0,"Worst looking watch ever, but man does it get the job done for the price.<br />Instant classic, If you want a reliable, small/compact watch that you aren't afraid of losing or breaking (not that you can) this is the perfect one."
4.0,Good quality t shirt<br />Not too thick but not sheer. Color is nice and has not faded yet.
4.0,"Well made, wish it was about five inches longer but it works"
4.0,"Awesome! Looks so expensive, I've had so many compliments on it, I have had to share the link! I.plan on buying another one in a different color!"
4.0,My Granddaughter loved them!!  Used them with her princess dresses
4.0,"I like the band a lot. Tho upon close inspection, it looks inexpensive. Bottomline, nobody needs to get that close to me. I'd purchase again. Yep, I would."
4.0,"It is actually blue and green plaid, not green gingham as advertised, which is normally okay, but I specifically needed a gingham pattern."
4.0,Love it but just a bit too long
4.0,"I really wasn't expecting a lot due to the price. However, this is a very pretty necklace. The color of the gem is absolutely beautiful.  I honestly didn't get to keep it too long. My sister in law saw it and fell in love. Due to the price, I had no problem handing it over it her. I would definitely purchase this again. I would definitely recommend this."
4.0,runs large and long and thin fabric
4.0,"I am 5'6"" and wear a size 16 or XL in most clothing. This top is a 2XL and is snug. It's not too tight that it is uncomfortable though. The material is thin, but not see through. I will have to wear a better t-shirt bra for a smooth look.  The arm length and body length are good so I don't have to pull them down."
4.0,I dont care
4.0,"Love how this bra fits and holds my girls up. The closure on the back is different from what I'm used too, so its going to take a bit to get used too. I am used to the VS ones that have the simple hooks. This one has more of a butterfly type design which makes it more difficult to put on since its a cross back. BUT once on, it fits very well and holds them in place without them being smashed together. I also went a cup size up since DD and E are different with each brand. I ordered an E and I'm glad I did. Band size stayed the same for me 36."
4.0,Colors are true to picture and it looks great on. The overalls part of the outfit was a little big but in general such a cute outfit
4.0,"I consider myself average,  but these tanks are small all around... short torso and very tight."
4.0,"I like these earrings but like all the other reviews, these are quite loud. I separated the pieces and use them as two separate pairs of earrings which is nice."
4.0,"My granddaughter's hair gets caught in the head straps and it hurts when she needs to take the mask off.  But otherwise, we all feel safer when we all wear these masks when we get together."
4.0,"It is really two big for my wrist, but that is not your problem.  I like the watch"
4.0,Very cute the shape is weird
4.0,I like the area covered.
4.0,They do everything I want a pair of sunglasses to do. And they look good.
4.0,Good fit. shirt material vert thin.
4.0,they should come with rubber backs but they are very nice
4.0,It's very hot the material is like the inside of a hoodie it's just too hot !
4.0,looks just like the picture.  good fit even for unisex for a woman.
4.0,"Yep, they're a pair of shorts"
4.0,"This mask is breathable. It’s noisy in quiet settings. The magnetic shield in front finally fell off on the subway in NY after falling off almost everywhere. I definitely miss it! I am using it without the shield now. Then the leather attachment broke away. So I now use a piece of double stick tape to hold it. It’s ONE month in, but it still works, just hobbled together, but effective. Could use a little more durability."
4.0,very well made with excellent material. only issue is that it doesn't quiet fit me as well as i had hoped. but it is still well worth the purchase
4.0,"Nicely made.Kind of sheer though. I normally wear U.S.size4-6 in dresses.I'm 5ft and 34DD .I ordered a xxl because reviews said it was small.Big Mistake!!! I wanted it loose especially in the chest. It is a tent! Iys very cute and I'm accustomed to altering my tops so I am keeping it and taking it in. If you choose to order up,only go one size..."
4.0,"Looking good on even if it's a little big. I'm 5'9&#34;, 160lb, pear shaped, and usually am between sizes Medium and Large. I ordered the medium and the length is perfect but it's a bit big in the chest and shoulders. It looks good on if I tug the shoulders down to adjust the crossed straps. If you have a bigger bust or a full figure, this would look perfect on."
4.0,"I wanted a really lightweight windbreaker for cycling on coolish days. I had borrowed my husband's jacket and really liked the feeling of added visibility in the bright color. I first ordered a Medium - I liked it and the length was good, but it was too tight in the bust and hips, especially for a jacket (I am normally between size 10 and 12). This one is a Large and is still form-fitting in the torso but a lot longer, both overall and in the sleeves (too long, really - I am 5'4"" with short arms).<br /><br />I really like the light weight, the feel of the fabric, the quality construction, and the big pockets. The zippers work smoothly. While I wasn't that excited about the zip-off sleeves, I've been wearing it as a safety vest almost every day now that the weather is warmer. Overall I'm happy, just not delighted with the fit."
4.0,"Super thin fabric, but super cozy and perfect for yoga. Fits a tiny bit small. Seller was INSANELY fast at shipping. I got it within 36 hours of ordering. Only down side is that the shirt tag ripped off as I was taking it out of the bag, which makes me question the quality."
4.0,"Nice skirt and very form fitting.  It hugs your curves nicely.  For a looser fit, you better size up."
4.0,It doesn't look as cute as on the photo. The underskirt is too short.
4.0,"Have used it twice as carryon and while handy to use, looks like it may be starting to come apart on rubber covers by zipper.  Hope not since it is light and rolls very well."
4.0,"It was overall made of good materials, but you really need to spend time getting measured to have it fit right. I'm a pretty standard 40R guy, and I've always fit &#34;medium&#34; clothese, but when it came the proportions were really off. The people that make it are super nice though, and were willing to alter it for no extra cost. The armor provided isn't really worth having and were held in the jacket with nylon pockets that can get pretty itchy. I would suggest just ordering it as a good looking cosplay jacket."
4.0,"This is a good cover up for the price, there are some loose threads, and I wish it had pockets. But for the price it was what I expected and fit per the description."
4.0,Dress very cute on and light weight. I wish I got one size up as it's very tight to put over my head. This dress wrinkles very easy so don't expect this to be packed in a suitcase and pulled out and worn right away.
4.0,"Exactly as pictured, form fitting, curve hugging and soft."
4.0,"Fits a bit tight for my head, but it keeps the sun off my face and shoulders and looks amazing!"
4.0,Cute and colorful. Grandaughter loves 🦄 so these were perfect for her. Socks seem a little small. Not much stretch but she's wearing them!
4.0,"Gave as gift to daughter,she liked...I think"
4.0,"Beautiful dress!! It fits somewhat big,even though I ordered a small, which I expected because I'm only 107lbs. I got it altered and shortened and it looks great. Can't wait to wear it to a wedding in 3 weeks!"
4.0,"Item pretty much what I thought, no complaints here"
4.0,"First, as of the writing of this review, there is a significant error in the Product Description. More than 200 copies of this box set were manufactured. How do I know? That number sounded low to me so I contacted the record label. They told me just Amazon's initial order was for a lot more than 200! So don't pay big $$$ for the deluxe box if you think you're getting something ultra rare.<br /><br />Now then, on to the actual set. I think casual fans will be very happy with one of the more basic editions. Yes, there's some cool ephemera included here but the music is 99% the  same across all versions of Joe Strummer 001. If you love The Clash, as I do, or Joe Strummer's post-Clash work, the deluxe book is pretty interesting. But at the end of the day it's really about THE MUSIC, right? So don't spend more than you need to."
4.0,"This top fit as expected, I carefully read the reviews and ordered the size to what others had said,  I normally wear a Large, some shirts Xlarge ( I have boobs) so i ordered the XXL and it fits well. For the price it was great, I do have to wear a tank top under, but have gotten lots of compliments. The material is a soft, thin cottony material, like a well loved tshirt! I would have given 5 starts except it doesn't lay quite the way I expected it to in the picture, it gets smaller at the bottom and tends to ride up a bit."
4.0,Great as beach cover-up!
4.0,"Comfortable, stay pretty well but I do have to adjust as expected but I’m used to that when I run/workout."
4.0,"I have a rain cape with a hood, but found that the hood dripped the rain right onto my nose.  I bought this to quickly put on to prevent that— I wanted something cute, cheerful, rain-resistant (it has a plastic core covered with comfy fabric).  This does the trick for me.<br /><br />I have long hair so I did NOT want a “head BAND” that went all the way around my head.  This slips on, is well padded, and is easy.  Plus I do love the sparkles."
4.0,"Love this dress and husband does too! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the black material that is shown in pictures to be on the back is actually on the sides of the front of the dress as well. It looks good, but that should be more clear."
4.0,Very good quality for the cost. Smaller and paler than they appear.
4.0,"Wrap tops, and any other article of clothing that you have to wrap, slips and rides up as the night goes on and you move around. This is unavoidable.<br />The product was as described, is a beautiful color, and super comfy. I love it &#60;3"
4.0,Love this dress! Fits beautifully. I'm 5'6&#34; 140lbs and the medium is perfect.
4.0,These are not my favorite true religions. Their very plain. They do fit as expected. They just don't have the &#34;wow.: factor I am used too.
4.0,It was compatible with my Fitbit Versa but it doesn't enclose it.  Instead you feel like it's going to pop out of the band.
4.0,This item is very pretty in person. Can’t wait to wear it with one of my birthday dresses :)
4.0,"I really like the color and the fabric is very pretty, but not much stretch.  The size runs smallish and shorter than depicted."
4.0,Great look. Great quality. Have had several compliments
4.0,Goes well with my Christmas Collection
4.0,"Very nice wallet, nice leather smell and feel."
4.0,"This worked great for my niece's birthday cake. I personally don't care for the look of the cupcake toppers, but my niece loved her cake."
4.0,I like them better in the picture. They look sort of cheap in person and the tassel strings just isn't saying it but for the price I will keep and do something with them.
4.0,"I LIKE THE SIZE,  ITS WHAT I WANTED"
4.0,Looks good but too tight around face.
4.0,Really cute shoes although they look at bit weird when folded down especially since the bright white tag shows when you fold then down. Failure in planning on someone's part. Really cute shoes all in all though and they match with tons of outfits :)
4.0,"I like the height. I like the color, and they are comfortable. I have no complaints. The shipping date was as expected."
4.0,Medium quality and serves the purpose as a sitting jacket.
4.0,My granddaughter loved it! I was the bomb at Christmas! Just be careful and only wash in COLD water; the print tends to fade.
4.0,nice color and sturdy feel
4.0,The shirts is shear but true to size the color is more of a bright red. It arrived within 10 days so it was fast.
4.0,"Waistline too high for a tall person, but otherwise it's a good buy.  Light, packable, and the bottom back tie is easy for fit."
4.0,Bought as gift...seems to be of good quality.  He hasn't gotten it yet so not sure how well it will hold up...but appears to be a great deal for the money.  May have to order more for my sons!
4.0,Size up! I got a small but it was still slightly to small :( I think it's great for a lot of cleavage!! Very pretty shirt but I really dislike the chain it falls out a little easy :(
4.0,This dress is very nice. I just wish it had pretty buttons.
4.0,"Have to do a little shimmy to get them up, but they were warm and made it so I could wear some of my favorite skirts over the winter."
4.0,"Nice lanyard however the black coloring on the clip came off very quickly when i attached my metal ID/badge holder. Nice, but kinda disappointing. If you don't mind that then it's a good product."
4.0,"I have several different pairs of this brand of earrings. They are something I would imagine seeing in Morocco, India or Egypt. I just love the designs. They come cleverly packaged in a little plastic case and with a nice little cotton bag. The wires are a bit thick for my liking, but they are still manageable. They are a bit heavier than the earrings I usually wear. I wish they were hollow. Maybe they are, but the metal is pretty thick. they don't pull my ears down or anything. I just think I'm used to small earrings. Overall, if you're used to somewhat heavier earrings, these might work for you. They are definitely gorgeous."
4.0,Beautiful design! The sleeves are a skosh smaller than expected for the size.
4.0,Es bonito luce bien siempre y cuando lo ves de lejos. Ya de cerca se nota que es un reloj barato mal logrado ligero y con materiales de mala calidad lo venden caro cuando la realidad es un reloj barato y de mala calidad una estafa total!!!
4.0,"I couldn't wait for this item to arrive. I am 6ft tall so just a warning this dress is right above my knees...so the right breeze and its, I'm, ""showtime."""
4.0,I kinda wish they would have started with a better shirt to put the Crimson Ghost on. It's not too bad though. Fits pretty good and it is Crimson Ghost and it does glow in the dark.
4.0,Embroidery could be better
4.0,"I am 38 weeks pregnant and it covers me completely.  The only down side i find it that the sleeves are a bit restricting.  I can't move my arms up completely, which bugs me.  Other than that it is a nice robe."
4.0,"Super cute, looks just like the pic. Only issue is that it has a strong metal smell. Like having a bunch of pennies around your neck."
4.0,Cute top. Runs small. Order up
4.0,"It is fine, not super ....."
4.0,This is a nice shirt.  Runs approx true to size
4.0,"I don't know if earrings are stamped 14k but these aren't. They are really pretty though, and a nice big size."
4.0,"They're more comfortable than pads, and I appreciate the environmental impact. Make sure to wash with cold water only, so they actually get clean. Warm water will set bodily fluid into the fabric; it'll never smell clean again."
4.0,Finally found a sock to wear with my Ballet flats for work. They do tend to slip off my heel some though.
4.0,Bonito y barato ! :) a mi esposo le gusto
4.0,"No complaints. Everything's as it should be. It's washable, comfortable material and looks good."
4.0,"Just order up a size, note that it is short but not too short"
4.0,"Looks get 5 stars!! However, sadly, already cracking open! I get that the shoes are on an 8 year old who plays hard. But that is why I took a star away."
4.0,Nice but for some reason hurt in my ears
4.0,"It does what I want it to - stretches out the waistband to remove wrinkles introduced by the dryer to make it easier to put my jeans on. I also bought a similar unit to stretch a hat that was a gift, but about 1/2 size small."
4.0,These are very simple.  I think that they could be a good gift for a little girl.
4.0,"The dress is a lovely light fabric, perfect for casual wear. I ordered a medium (5'6"", 145lbs) and it's a touch tight around the torso. Maybe I should have sized up? Not sure, I think the large might be too big. I like the dress, so I will keep it."
4.0,"Cute, good bargain"
4.0,"The dress is what I expected for the price! My only complaint is that it’s not quite as long as I expected. I am average height and usually my maxi dresses go to my feet and sometimes even touch the ground. Overall, it’s cute and I will wear it for the event that I purchased it for."
4.0,"Almost perfect! One of mine twists slightly too far so I have to leave it slightly loose, but other than that, very nice!!"
4.0,Very soft and cute my little pony pyjamas bottoms. I am a size14 and the XL fits me fine with plenty of room. I experienced no problems as the other reveiewer stated. The drawstring is adjustable and there is an elastic waistband if you need to loosen or tighten a bit.
4.0,"I purchased the green color and was pleased with this understated stylish canvas tote. I can easily see this as a regular extra bag for those days when there are a few more things/snacks to bring along, as a purse for minimalist minded or animal-free people, or as a yoga bag minus the mat holder. I especially like the long straps and the fact that it is very neutral. I can fit my normal tote style purse on top with ease. I personally plan to use it  for toddler supplies since we are over the huge diaper bag phase. There is a zippable pouch in the middle and a zippable pocket on the side. Although it is long and narrow, the lining means I can still find things. I only gave 4 stars because the straps came a bit dirty, and that will presumably only get worse. Fine for my intended use, but not ideal for a brand new purchase. If I could give 4.5 I would though. Overall, it feels well worth the price! Recommended. Please like if this helps you!"
4.0,"Love the print, good material.. but it's a little big.  It wraps all the way under the chin"
4.0,She's happy I'm happy
4.0,-quality material that is thick<br />-fit well<br />-the image is my favorite part. It has vibrant colors and the image looks clear<br />-unique piece and would even make a great gift
4.0,"My last glove lasted almost a decade, so I knew I wanted something similar. This pair of gloves came very close. The softness and warmth are right on point. My only issue is that I couldn't find the size that was the perfect fit. The first pair I got ran small (my fault as I didn't follow the instructions that clearly suggested to measure your hands first). I returned that pair hassle-free and got a second pair (after measuring this time) but somehow these ran big - short fingers problem lol. Anyways, I kept these gloves because while they're somewhat oversized, they're not too bad that they fall off my hands.<br /><br />Disclaimer: there was a gift card promise for leaving a review, but my review is based strictly on my opinion."
4.0,Gave 4 star because is longer than what I normally wear otherwise it is a beautiful pendant
4.0,"The dress is just as pictured. The material is very thin and I’m not sure how it will hold up when washed. It is limed so it isn’t see though which is good. Got a small, I’m 5’5” and 110 lbs and it fit as expected."
4.0,"I've owned a few Casio watches over the years. They are good basic watches. Two drawbacks in my opinion are that the light function is basically almost worthless and I wish the bands held up better. Band failure is the reason I've had to replace several watches. When I wanted to simply replace the band I found that they are not easy to find and when you do they cost about the same, or even more, than an entire new watch. That's ridiculous and wasteful!!"
4.0,Super nice wings and mask.  Antennae are a lot cheap looking.  My wings did not have loops for the fingers which was disappointing.  Nice costume for the price.
4.0,"It fits GREAT, however being a woman with curves it was too short!! I had to wear it with shorts!! I still love it!"
4.0,I like all of it but wished it had open spaces as the one I had many years ago.
4.0,"I purchased this dress to wear for Zoom calls for remote working as well as weekend outings (e.g. brunch, shopping). It definitely fit the bill. It pairs nicely with a wedge shoe.<br /><br />PROS: The dress is lined and the jeweled designs on the collar are a really nice touch. I dry cleaned the dress recently, and it still looks great…all the jewels on the collar are still there.<br /><br />CONS: This is a really minor detail, but I assume the designs on the dress would be embroidered. The blue designs on the dress are printed on the fabric.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy with the purchase. This dress was consistent with the fit and quality I expect from Shelli Segal clothing."
4.0,"This actually is a great support bra. I’m a 36 D. It has great support, the style and lookis great and sexy. The only problem is that it’s too tight and would suggest to order a size up."
4.0,Have an older Tilly's Tec Wool Hat that wrinkled pretty bad. Steamed it with starch but only held up for a couple of days. Used this product and it held shape much longer than the starch. So I gave it multiple coats with a little steam and now it holds shape even longer. Happy with purchase.
4.0,"I like it, a and it is a go with everything bracelet.  it does come from overseas so it too a long time to get it, but well worth the price!"
4.0,Nice color; nice style. Runs somewhat small
4.0,It was very nice but not workable for my husband with his job
4.0,Worked for what I needed it to! Only wish my shoes would've been comfortable!
4.0,"Tons of compliments, very feminine and flowie."
4.0,its a Hanes T-Shirt with a Tie-Dye done. wanted something for a 70's party ! did its job !<br />no complains !
4.0,Not too warm for really cold weather
4.0,Good quality good size fits my 7 yrs son fin
4.0,"Lovely little gifts for myself and my sisters. My middle sister fell of pretty quickly, they replaced the complete set so now I have extra of the other 2."
4.0,"These are ok if you can put your earrings in backwards, almost impossible to put in from front to back"
4.0,"This shirt is really cute!  I am glad I purchased it.  Only thing is it runs a little smaller then I thought.  Usually I wear a Large to X-Large and since it was fitted I ordered a 1X and it just fit.  It took a while to ship after purchasing it which I wasn't happy about but other then that I love the shirt and would recommend it to anyone.  Great purchase, very cute, good quality, and Go 49ers!!"
4.0,"I very much like this belt, and it has worn well with almost daily use this past year, still in &#34;like new&#34; shape.  Only problem is that it runs quite large, make that very large.  I'm a 42&#34; waist, and having some experience with stretch belts, I ordered Large (36&#34;-38&#34;).  I'm still a 42&#34; waist, dammit!, and I'm now ordering Medium (32&#34;-34&#34;).  We shall see."
4.0,"PROS: very lightweight, comfortable, and adjustable. My 13-year old has been able to wear this out now that masks are required. It has gone through the washer and dryer multiple times with no fading or other issues.<br /><br />CON: This is very minor, but the way the design is cut, if you want the skull out to align with your mouth, you have to do a very awkward fold/roll of the eye-portion of the mask. Because of the adjustable cord (which is great) you cannot simply roll the mask. I'm not sure why they didn't just put the nose and mouth of the skull higher and not print the eye portion. With a different print, this would not be an issue and the mask would have easily pulled 5 stars from us!"
4.0,"This sweater is exactly what I expected.  I can't seem to find tunic sweaters much so this was a surprise.  Could have been a little softer but oh well, it washed and dried in the machines."
4.0,"I currently use this strap with my Cpap Mask and helps keep my mouth closed through out the night. The best part of this strap is that it is wide at the chin and the stitching is on the outside. Other straps that I've used will cut into my skin under my chin. This strap does not leave marks on my face or under my chin and is very soft.  If you do snore heavily, the strap might be a little to soft and stretchy.  Mine came with a plastic / rubber smell but was not too strong or overwhelming.  Plus with my cpap mask I don't smell it. The only problem I have is with the ear holes. The holes work well to keep the strap on my head, but when I woke up, the back side was rubbing and pushing against my ear lobes and I can still feel it.  I've used many strap because of my cpap machine and this one so far is a keeper. If you use any type of apnea machine, I recommend this strap.  I also use a dentist prescribed night guard which I recommend as a must use with any chin strap.<br /><br />I did receive a discount to review this product."
4.0,Not quite what I thought but still beautiful
4.0,"Beautiful dress, lovely color. Purchased this dress for my daughter she is a small. Material does not stretch."
4.0,"Very pretty earrings! Much larger than I expected. I wanted some small simple studs that are pretty so I can keep them in for a couple days and not have to worry about changing them. Since these are larger I will probably have to take them out at night, but I am still happy with my purchase."
4.0,They are heavy and don’t fit well
4.0,"Pants fit at waist, but were about 4 inches too short. The owners contacted me with a very nice apology."
4.0,"I just tried this on, well, the best I could without any help. First go round, had a back strap around my neck. Not good. Finally got it over my head and shoulders but was not able to put it in place without someone to help me. I feel it is too small right now but should fit me in a month or so."
4.0,"This is an excellent product, however the material will split open. It did it twice on me. I still love the item."
4.0,This swim suit fit perfectly. The style was just what I wanted. The only down side is the stitching around the band is a bit itchy
4.0,"These lightweight tights are true to size; however, the top portion doesn't expand as much as I would like, but they still fit well... they are high-waisted, so there is no muffin top. They go on nice and easy, I didn't have a hassle getting them up my legs, so that's a plus.... Definitely body shaping. I was able to see my panties through the tights.... these tights are thicker than pantyhose, but not as think as yoga tights.  Its a happy medium....."
4.0,"The needs were loose, and didn't want to stay connected."
4.0,Only reason for a four stars is it is little to big and barely fits in his back pocket
4.0,"I really like this purse.  I am a sucker for purses w/built-in wallets.  I am unsure about the material really being leather.  If I had to guess, I honestly would have to say it is not genuine leather, but it is still a nice looking bag.  Seems to be sturdy w/a good solid strap.  I bought it in navy & it is a true navy blue. After I fill it full of everything I put in my purse, it is still very light to carry."
4.0,"I'm on my dad's account so ignore the name, but I got sooooooo many compliments in this! The top was a little weird because the elastic in the band would get twisted, but it wasn't a big deal at all. I wore this to Vegas and all eyes were on me. I'm about 5'3/5'4 135 lbs and wear a 34b, I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly!"
4.0,Helps with my photophobia.
4.0,"Overall, I'm pleased with this dress. I love the fabric and print, and I love the pockets. You should know that it's pretty short waisted, which can make the fit not quite right, especially because it makes the pockets feel too high.  It's nice and breezy, suitable for summer, and a good warm weather dress if you're self-conscious about your arms.<br /><br />I don't think I'm especially long waisted, but nor am I short-waisted.<br /><br />The imperfect fit on me means it isn't my first choice, but it's close enough that I'm still happy wearing it.<br /><br />The coloring looks great on a fair completion with olive undertones. I'd say the fit is pretty good, maybe just a little smaller than average--but that could be the short waist talking. If you're borderline between sizes, maybe go up."
4.0,"I feel bad I brought a size bigger as it fits perfectly. But it is comfy, a little bit large maybe but very good to walk around the house"
4.0,"Smaller than a shoe brush and the bristles are little more stiff.  Just perfect for hats, even my baseball caps."
4.0,I wish this chain necklace was rather antique gold (love that type of gold!) But it was somewhat I was looking for. It fancies up anything I wear with it. Very fashionable.
4.0,"I bought them a 32 waist because that's what I wear in all other clothes but they are very long and baggy. If you are a 32 I would recommend a 28 or at most a 30. They are good quality and elastic, so I will be buying them again in a smaller size."
4.0,Fits lose
4.0,"The medallion is perfect and I love it. Could not even stand touching the chain (hence minus 1 star) Pulled chain off, added leather piece, a magnetic clasp and made it into a lanyard for work. Groovy"
4.0,These are really cute. They are a bit longer tha I had expected and a little smaller than I thought. But that's my fault. They work great.
4.0,I have not wear my dress because I don't like the way it fit and the look in the back
4.0,"These fit well overall, but need to be hemmed as they are too long for me.  I am 5'3&#34;. They also have a strong odor that doesn't wash out and will transfer to your other clothes, so you may want to wash them separately."
4.0,"I really love the look, fit, and quality of these glasses.  The only reason I rate them four stars instead of five is that the tint is too dark.  It's actually a little bit difficult to see in other than bright direct sunlight."
4.0,Nice but a bit small.
4.0,"My husband loves them and so do I . Only thing is it can - like most all cargo shorts- wrinkle if not hung up and may need steaming on pocketed, if he is persnickety."
4.0,"Excellent,  exactly what u was looking for and came right away in about 3-4 days. I do wish the black spiked cuff hung behind the ear like the gold though. It hangs more on the edge of the ear than the front."
4.0,i love this dress the material is so soft will definitely order more.
4.0,Top is not as tight as I would expect it to be. But it fits well
4.0,It was just as expected. Wore to a themed night as a troll. (Don't Ask.) Great length.
4.0,"These sneakers are a tad too small but I’m hoping that as I wear them, they will stretch out a little bit. Overall they are very comfortable and supportive."
4.0,"I loved the shoes they were just to tight for me. The heel height, color and style were great. The price was Excellent!  But I had to return them"
4.0,"These vintage aviators fit comfortably. I have a fairly large head, and it can be tricky finding over the counter sunglasses that don't squeeze my head and cause headaches. They also have a cool vintage look and do a nice job of protecting my eyes. All that said, I was expecting something more given the price point. These are a nice pair of retro aviators. But I'm not sure the price is justified."
4.0,"I couldn't be happier with this suit! It looks amazing on my figure. I'm 5'10 so I was a little worried about the length.  It is a little short through the torso, but it actually rides up on my butt and makes it look amazing (which is hard to do because I don't have a butt).  I am a 36DDD and of course I was a little worried about frontal coverage. But it covers nicely. The strings cover a lot of my cleavage but it's still very sexy. I had to remove the pads from the front of the suite, but the material is thick enough that there isn't see-through.  Overall I am very pleased!"
4.0,Will be great come summer. Lightweight and comfortable.
4.0,Very cute but very small it was about the size of two quarters.
4.0,These items were comfortable for my granddaughter.
4.0,"Have only used it once but it seems to be doing the trick.  Easy application, and has helped in water proofing my Red Wing boots."
4.0,"My kids got a pair of these for Christmas and they haven't stopped playing with them.  They are so much fun to change the colored faces and straps around, and very easy to do-- even my four year old can do it on her own.  They are well-coated too.  They don't have sharp edges or peel easily the way old snap bracelets do.  Durable.  They also are the right size.  I was worried they would fall off my kids' thin wrists, but they hold on there pretty well.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the clock face is pretty hard to read for a little kid because there are no numbers, only hashes.  My 8 and 9 year olds can do it with no problem, but my first grader who can read our wall clock at home has trouble with it.  I'm sure he'll figure it out eventually, but if your kid isn't fabulous at analog clock-reading, this watch will be more decorative than helpful. The Acczila slap watches have the numbers."
4.0,Definitely low cut but if you have the boobs for it why not
4.0,It was bigger than I expected
4.0,Does its job and isnt uncomfortable for the most part.
4.0,Doesn't come w the metal nose clip but still awesome!!!
4.0,"It's OK for the price I paid. Bigger than expected. Should have ordered  one size smaller. No arch support but, good grip in the shower. Would buy it again."
4.0,"Beautiful dress,fabric is very nice and stretchable"
4.0,It fit great but it does ride up due to the lining being a tad short
4.0,I am 5’8.5 with 155.  I wear size 10-12.  I got the XXL because I figured they run VERY small.<br /><br />Order several sizes up and they are great.<br /><br />Very cute and will be fun to wear under a skirt while bike riding thru Europe next year.
4.0,"I liked the lab coat, my son is thin and tall, his regular size is 12/14 and I thought for a lab cost it would be a bit more generous in the sleeves, however he really likes it.  During his STEM class it was very useful. I will post again after the first washing."
4.0,Did not come with the tail
4.0,"I got this shirt earlier than expected!  The shirt itself is good quality but sized very differently than standard American women’s sizes; it is an XXXL but fits like a common XL, happy I upsized.  I haven’t washed it yet, but I am hoping it holds up in the washing machine.  It is very clear where the appliqué starts and stops, so the quality of that part I am not sure.  It looks very good and it is cute, it’s just as it was advertised.  I am very satisfied with this item. I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,Not flattering for ppl with a protruding stomach.
4.0,It arrived quickly. The collar is a little bigger than I imagined but it lays nicely and is comfortable to wear. Nice material also.
4.0,It’s a great mask but it kept following from my face.
4.0,"Great fit. Actually flattering as a mom of 2, and I’m pleased for sure  ! Got my true size, 120 lbs, 5’2”, small."
4.0,"The only reason I gave this top 4 stars is because you can tell it wont hold up very many washes. Other than that it is very cute, easy to dress up or down. Worth what I paid for it. Would recommend to a friend."
4.0,It came in earlier than I expected  it's a little small but it's super cute and the color is actually what I wanted
4.0,Fun pajama shirt. Soft material
4.0,"very cool and retro, I had a hard time figuring out how to make the lace larger"
4.0,"This was a gift for a teenager, but when it came  I could easily see it on my wrist too. Pay attention to previous reviews where the leather looks more red than brown. It's ok though as this lends to some of the uniqueness. The snap closure seems to be pretty secure and its just fun. I was thrilled that I picked out a winner for a hard to pick for teenager, and the shipping was very quick, which helped my last minute shopping problem!"
4.0,"In all honesty I am size 6 and i ordered the XL.<br />I am pretty fit with a little room for improvement.  These shorts do fit funny but they are comfortable.  I would say that a tall, thin girl would fit in to these well. (This is NOT racist) I truly believe they run in Asia sizes so be aware or the difference in sizing."
4.0,Too early to talk about durability.  Fit was a bit too large.  I should have ordered the smaller size but I just bent the clips in a bit and they work fine.  Easy to put on and take off.  With all the metal it does add noticeable weight but not uncomfortably so.
4.0,"ok, but had to return them, was not as expected"
4.0,Nice lightweight shirt
4.0,I have a high arch with a plantar fasciitis problem in right foot.  I have great difficulty finding a good shoe with arch support I need.  These are really good.  I'm sure I will purchase another pair in the future.  I learned of your shoes from a friend!
4.0,"Love these shirts for my 97yo uncle. He recently had a stroke, and these allow for easy dressing, without hurting him.<br />I did order a larger size than he wears, because I was concerned about how they would fit.  Since the shirts are a bit pricey, and I wanted to be sure they fit him, I ordered xl.  He very easily could have fit into a large.<br /><br />These shirts are very soft, wash nicely, and are very easy to get him dressed."
4.0,"These shoes were super cute and were exactly what I wanted. I ordered a 7.5 and they were definitely a little small. I'd say if you are going to order these shoes, order a half a size bigger than you normally would."
4.0,"My husband complimented me in this dress. It’s comfy. I don’t like the ruffle that goes all the way around the shoulder hole. Either no ruffle at all or only have the ruffle as a sleeve. Overall, it’s nice. I got the mint green so it’s a nice change to what I usually wear"
4.0,Got one for each holiday
4.0,The quality seems really good and the price was great! I haven’t tried them out yet but I’m excited to
4.0,Dress fit perfectly and looked terrific for a very impromptu wedding reception/celebration.  The review would have been five stars except the dress arrived later than originally stated and made it just in the nick of time.
4.0,"Bought these because I don't want to take my expensive sunglasses on vacation. These are great. The frame definitely feels cheap, but they fit nice, they look good and they will work for what I need them for. I didn't expect too much since they were so inexpensive but I would buy again for travel and such. Especially if you have nice glasses you don't want to lose or take with you."
4.0,"I like this shirt but it’s not what I thought it would be. I’m 5’5 and I got xl. I usually wear l (10/12)or xl (12/14) on top because of my chest and shoulders. The shirt is very wide and not as long as it thought it would be. The model must be shorter than me!  But it’s a great material, I love the neckline and the shoulders fit well. It’s just shorter than I thought. I did keep it because it still looks good even though a little more bell shaped than tunic.i thought  about returning for a smaller size because of the width and but I didn’t."
4.0,A little pricey for plastic but my granddaughter couldn’t have been happier
4.0,Didn't  like the way it felt
4.0,"This was exactly as pictured save for the chain material being of cheaper quality that you might imagine. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase."
4.0,It has been difficult to find a 22mm watch band to fit my 9+ inch wrist for my new TicWatch Pro . This fits my wrist with extra to go. I like the silicone band. I've had it only a week. So far so good.
4.0,"Really nice material and all, love them but I find them a bit too dark."
4.0,Love the print! And it looks like it won't fade with wash. One star off perfect is that the neck string is not adjustable and on me it hangs kind of low.
4.0,I was looking for a simple feminine watch with numbers and one that didn't have a huge face. The face on this watch is still a bit large but not glaringly so. My only complaint would be that the band is quite thin and I can foresee it breaking with daily wear and tear.
4.0,The purse is very lightweight which is famastic for me. I didn't like the lining so I removed it.  It may be alright for someone else but I just didn't care for it.
4.0,"So the quality is variable with the masks in the package. One of my orders was missing the plastic adjuster piece for the ear. Overall I am so happy. I even bought my husband a set and kept the pink one for me. I wear them all day,8-9 hours, and wash after each use. They have held up for three months and seem to have more months in them. I would recommend for sure."
4.0,"nice but a bit thinner than the real deal.  Plenty durable and versatile<br /><br />some folks wearing these things have fought and died alongside our servicemen. Others have shot at us. I got a better one from a Pakistani friend but do not wear it in public out of respect for those who it might stress, despite my respect for many in the Pansheer valley"
4.0,Fits a little snug but I can still wear it.  Nice dress for the price
4.0,"I like everything about this coat, however,  both pockets have wholes in them to the extent that I have to sew them."
4.0,Runs a little small but great deal for the price.
4.0,&#34;Love them&#34;! They fit just right!😎
4.0,"They're good rings, they work, not chipped yet. BIGGEST THING THOUGH the colors for blue and gold are completely different. Blue is a dark midnight blue and gold is a dingy yellow"
4.0,"This is very pretty.  I'm going to a Kentucky Derby-related event and was really discouraged by the price and selection of items in local stores. This is just as nice as the items in my local department stores but is far less expensive. It's not as nice in the details and construction as the actual hand-made millinery items in boutiques, but I wouldn't expect it to be at this price, and honestly you'd have to stare pretty hard at someone else's head in a critical way to notice the difference, so it seems perfect to me.  I purchased the red, and the color is very bright--almost an orangey red, in case that helps anyone. It came unsquished in a nice display box. The satin-covered platform this fascinator is built on is heavier and more substantial than the more common mesh ones on other pieces. I really prefer the look of this one, though it does add a little weight to it, if that's a concern for you. My only real criticism is that the clip the whole thing is mounted to is cheap and a little skewed and doesn't anchor well in my hair. I may clip it to a headband and wear it that way."
4.0,"This bracelet is very pretty, feels well made  and looks fairly classy.  However, the stones left blue stains on my wrist.<br />Edit: I’m updating the review because after the first day, the bracelet stopped leaving stains and I’m really enjoying wearing it. Very pretty."
4.0,"My husband uses this on overseas trips and he says it's comfortable, he hardly knows he has it on.  Only thing is he thought it would fit up around the calf but it's too loose for that so he has to wear it around his ankle. But he pulls his sock up over it so even if he crosses his legs it's not obvious.  He was able to put a half-inch stack of bills in it so the capacity is good."
4.0,"These were fun little masks for my grandson's birthday party. They were a great value, and lasted for the entire party. They won't last for years, but I definitely got my money's worth out of them."
4.0,I loves these because I can easily graduate up to a size!! having a change of color is great too !!
4.0,"These seem a bit small, not as much stretch. Probably won't buy any more.  Updated: this company was very responsive to my comment and mostly made good on these socks.  The socks are good, just not for me. I gave them to my sister and she loves them. Don't hesitate trying these."
4.0,Little shorter than it appeared in the photo
4.0,"Very nice, I only wish that the bottom came down more and covered the tops of my shoulder but it still gets the job done."
4.0,"Awesome style, but face too small for my liking. Gave it to my nephew. But that's my fault for not knowing. The description is accurate."
4.0,Great Selkie dupe!
4.0,"This band it so beautiful, I absolutely love the color!! Just know the mesh style band likes to find and grab any little string on your clothing, blankets, and other items which - to me - is pretty damn annoying. However, the fit (I have SMALL wrists and finding a band that was small enough was difficult!) is perfect for me, it has never fallen off, and it looks absolutely fantastic for the price. Would recommend."
4.0,"Bought these for my mom, she was pleased with the color, quality, and size for the price paid."
4.0,"This is my own fault for not noticing that they were sublimated velvet, but if you ever experience any kind of chub-rub, these will be a nightmare. Only a small area of my thighs touch, so it's not the end of the world for me. I normally wear a size 4 in Old Navy and Mossimo jeans and these fit great with no struggle. The pattern doesn't warp once you put them on, but because they are velvet, the pattern is only on the top of the velvet, but the pattern still looks beautiful.<br />They are slightly see-through, but not bad. I wore dark panties in the picture just as a test (easiest way to find out!). The tag is printed on (not sewn in) and it is ever so slightly visible from the outside.<br />Seams are well done, crotch is not reinforced (ie, these are not exercise leggings). The rear actually has more material than the front, so there is no butt-cleavage when you sit down (no small miracle with leggings). I'm glad manufacturers are starting to remember people have butts!<br />I am 5'0&#34; and these leggings are almost the perfect length on me. If you are more than 5'2&#34; or 5'4&#34; they will /definitely/ be too short.<br />They are incredibly soft and super adorable. I can't wait to get my Bee sweater to wear with these leggings, they will look awesome!<br />I took away one star because they aren't my preferred material. I would much rather have the printed spandex than the velvet. But other than that, these are a solid pair of leggings!"
4.0,I am very happy with this purchase. Item is in great condition and was better than I expected it to be for the price. I will enjoy using this daily. Can’t beat this deal.
4.0,"Perfect grift for your daughter , or wife , I bought it for my girlfriend and I know she'll love it . Great choice."
4.0,A bit thin but well made and attractive. My daughter loved it.
4.0,The headband is comfortable to wear and very convenient when riding my Harley.
4.0,The only difference in the picture and the skirt you receive is the asymmetry down the middle is less exaggerated in real life. Other than that its a god quality cute skirt for what you paid for.
4.0,"They were great but small. They barely fit me, it you have big forearms forget about it"
4.0,Great for those of us with wide width feet.  Purchased because well... look at them  and then was pleasantly surprised with comfort and  durability.
4.0,I ordered blue one and the color is gorgeous. Material is nice and soft. It's true to size. I bought S and it fits as expected. I wish the sleeves were a bit longer but may be it's just the way it's designed.
4.0,The fabric is different Thant in the photo but still a never beautiful dress
4.0,The shorts fit great under whatever you like to wear while riding.
4.0,It well constructed and functions just as any backpack without wheels.
4.0,Very well made. Credit card slots are very tight.  Obviously don’t want things falling out but I don’t want to carry a set of pliers to get a card out either. Hopefully it loosens a little
4.0,The gray one is impossible to read
4.0,"Love these joggers!  They are super super soft and I love that they have pockets.  The fabric is not thick, it is sort of thin but still very nice.  These wash and dry very well.  I did not give 5 stars due to the sizing chart and size of these.  I went by the chart which suggested a L, when in fact I normally wear a S to M.  I should have gone with the M, but possibly even the S.  Thankfully these still work even though they are long and bigger, due to the cuff and the tie waist.  So, order your regular size."
4.0,"My shoe size is 8.5 US/26.5cm, but even in the Large size,  the big toes of my not-so-large feet extend past the forward edges of the sole of these slippers. Luckily the material is stretchable/flexible enough so that this is not a major issue for me, but someone with a size 10+ foot will likely find them to be too tight. Also, I feel the bumps on the bottom should be made of a slightly more sticky/rubbery material, instead of the current ones which feel more like plastic, and thus are still rather slick/slippery on hardwood floors. The sole should be thicker as well. It feels like there are only 3-4 layers of very thin cloth between one's feet and the cold floor. Other than that, these dogs are warm and toasty on the sides and tops, and they look great!"
4.0,Very cute but fit very large had to return for smaller size.
4.0,This is the second time I bought them.
4.0,This chain is heavier than I expected but is not something I’d wear normally. I got it for an event. I haven’t actually worn it out yet so I can’t speak to how well it will hold up but it seems more than adequate for my purpose. I did try it on and wore it around for a while with no issues.<br />I didn’t have any tangling issues but I look after my things. It was easy to put on and I have a smaller frame at a size 4 and it still fit.
4.0,Not a perfect fit but worked fine for the one night I needed them.
4.0,Very useful organizational item. I would buy more as needed. I use one in my briefcase and one with my laptop. Only minor drawback would be zippered pouch on back- a bit flimsy so don't overload.
4.0,"Decent 3 pack value, nice racerback cut. Ordered US size XS. I am 5'1"" , 105 lbs and they fit right.  These are not compression fit, it was not a problem to me but I find that description to be misleading for those looking for that feature."
4.0,Great fit but top straps are a little weird
4.0,"These are so awesome and comfortable and warm and non-slip! I would give these 5 stays if they lasted longer. I'm ordering a second set because I've worn holes through both pairs I purchased 3 months ago. But, they are worth it!"
4.0,"Love this I get so many compliments on it, the only thing I don’t like is it’s very see through"
4.0,I wish it was a bit longer but I like it
4.0,I use it a lot and have had quite a few compliments on it.  I tell everyone to watch what they say and do because there is a camera in the flower - hahaha.
4.0,It wiil shrink after getting wet.
4.0,These glasses are a good intermediate choice for the summer<br /><br />I have bought very expensive brand name<br />Glasses and cheap glasses for the car as extras or as temporary replacement that fall apart way too quickly and you have to buy another one or just aren't good enough<br /><br />These are solid.  A little clunky 'retro' but substantial<br /><br />They are not terribly dark that you can't see hen coming in the house but they Definately do cut down the glare on a sunny day<br /><br />Love the mirror look too - especially in colors that are soft not distracting to someone else looking at you<br /><br />Gets a thumbs up if you want to spend twenty bucks on a pie of glasses as a backup to more expensive ones or if you need a summer pair for multiple cars<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price for my honest opinions
4.0,Just barely fit the head of my 18 month old grandchild. Freaking adorable for sure and decently made. But runs small.
4.0,It’s a bit big but it’ll do bc I need a coat NOW
4.0,Wish it was a bit smaller so it would fit better
4.0,I'm usually a size 8-9 depending on the shoe. I bought these in size 8 but a bigger size probably would have fit better.
4.0,"Tie us a good deal, but is a little orange."
4.0,Love the design. The inside has started to come apart in the corner a little bit which is the reason for 4 stars. Doesn’t effect how it’s used so doesn’t bother me that much
4.0,This skirt is super cute my only complaint the waist is a little tighter than I like. I suggest a bigger size.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at how warm this jacket is and the collar keeps me extra warm. The fleece material feels soft and thick. It has a polyester liner. I like the leopard print, it's sharp looking. There's a pocket on each side and the pockets are lined in fleece to keep your hands warm. The zipper feels sturdy although sometimes it's a little tricky, it gets stuck in the bottom when I try to zip it up if I'm not careful. As far as the fit, in my opinion, it's true to size. The jacket feels comfortable. The only thing that I don't care for is the cuffed hem located below the waist, it's a little tight, but the cuffed hems around the wrists fit well as well as the rest of the jacket. I washed it and dried it on delicate cycle and it held up well."
4.0,The boys wear them a lot.
4.0,I really loved these but I didnt spray them with protectant first like I should have! So now they have white salt Mark's! Need a new pair! Spray them!
4.0,The dress didn't fit around the girls
4.0,"My 17 year old son purchased these earrings.  He really wanted to get his ears pierced, but this was a better option.  He really likes them and they look nice on him."
4.0,Size up if you’re heavier chested
4.0,Product was exactly like shown in the picture!! Fit perfect. Didn't like that it took a really long time to get to me only down fail
4.0,Cute! Well made and looked cute on my dog but too small for me to feel comfortable in. I just misread it and didn’t realize just how small. Wish it was bigger I’d have kept it.
4.0,seems ok; not tried yet.
4.0,"Loved the earring. They aren’t heavy at all. However, one arrived missing the tiny stone for the eye on the hummingbird."
4.0,These shorts have very wide legs. Bought for my daughter and she didn't like how wide the legs are
4.0,I bought for a loved one's funeral-<br /><br /> fits as expected - very comfortable
4.0,"Simple, effective."
4.0,Fits good .a tad bit shorter
4.0,Overall it is a great product for the price. The cups were a little smaller than I would like but still gave a flattering look under the shirt I wore it with.
4.0,"At 5'-2&#34; and 120 lbs, I ordered the small. When I first pulled them out of the box, they looked way too small but upon trying them on they have a good amount of stretch and are a great fit.  The material is a good quality and is substantial, not light or flimsy at all.  They are well made; the stitching at the seams is strong.  I like that they are a high-rise fit at the waist so there is no chance of them causing an unflattering muffin top. I will say that since I am on the shorter side they did fall a bit lower on the leg than I would prefer, however they can be pulled up to just above the calf and they will stay put there without ever sliding down."
4.0,The dress was beautiful! I only returned it because I didn’t need it for the event I was going to anymore
4.0,"Sadly, this very cute bathing suit does not fit my 6.5 year old; it is WAY TOO SMALL. Ordered the 9/10 (XL) size, expecting there to be extra room for growth... nope, not at all. The 9/10 size looks like it would fit a 4 year old. My daughter is about 65 pounds and wears an 8-10 (depending on brand). She is very sad that this did not fit her."
4.0,It is good for walking at night with dog.
4.0,Very comfortable fit and also  a pretty bra
4.0,"The neckless is nice but to small, cant hardly see the name thats on it."
4.0,This Necklace is pretty but a little smaller than I thought.
4.0,Very soft.  Doesn't seem like it will last a long time but it's super comfi.
4.0,I like the case however it arrived without the cloth.
4.0,Great look love the quick release under chin padding is kind of thin is only complaint.
4.0,It is beautifull but too big I order Medium because it said runs small
4.0,"Seems to be good quality make.  Watch bands can be hit or miss, so I'll update after it goes through some wear and tear.  Note to those buying this for a smart watch like the LG G;  you'll have to remove it from the watch before charging because it obstructs the back of the watch.  Doesn't bother me since it goes on and off relatively easy."
4.0,"Got this as a gift when my dog passed away. The pendant is a lovely design and has a nice weight to it. The chain pinches a bit so I might use a different chain.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have is that the end of the tunnel is too small for pet ashes to go through. I ended up cutting a centimeter off the end, which made it a little more precarious as the end no longer fit snugly in the opening. But I managed to fill the chamber without too much trouble after that modification, by scooping the finer dust with a knife and trying to avoid larger pieces.<br /><br />Also, does not come with a &#34;gift BOX&#34; as it claims to in description. Just the black bag pictured."
4.0,Love the soft material. Cute and comfty. So
4.0,Value fore price is fine
4.0,Only issue is its alittle hard to remove.
4.0,"Pretty dress but was a bit shorter than I’d like. I’m 5’9”/155 lbs, purchased a medium and the dress just came to my ankles. Was wearing it for a photo session and didn’t have to time to return and find another option so I kept it. Not sure if I’ll wear again. On the plus side, it is a thicker material so I didn’t have to worry about seeing undergarments. Seems to be higher quality material. Would probably work much better on a shorter woman."
4.0,The amount of steam it puts out.
4.0,I did not expect it to be THIS GOOD!! It’s definitely beautiful and fits amazing!!
4.0,"Nice purse.  Happy with size and quality.  Just an FYI... the photos of the interior of the bag are switched between the two color choices (beige and brown).  The inside of the brown bag, which is the image shown when the beige bag is actually selected, is orange.  The inside of the beige bag... yeah, shown when the brown bag is selected... is actually brown.  Probably doesn't matter, but thought I'd point it out."
4.0,"Pretty good, not as good of a lens that oakley provides, but pretty good."
4.0,As expected. Chain is a bit short (and shorter than the chains as I saw them in the various movies) but could be replaced I think.
4.0,"Nothing special,but ok for the cheap price."
4.0,I use this because of the top carry handle but the backpack straps unsnap often and the design of these straps stink.. The pack itself is roomy enough and not bulky like many packs. Pretty design and color too. If the backpack straps worked better I’d give r stars. If you plan to wear in your back you might be disappointed.
4.0,Very pretty and perfect for what I needed!
4.0,Adorable and fits great!!!
4.0,Different material but it's cute
4.0,This dress is nice not as soft as a Navy Blue one we bought. and the belt is sewn in the front I think too high it doesn't cover the seam. It came with a cute flower crown. My Granddaughter really likes it.
4.0,"The product is ok, I don't like the plastic thingy that attached to it like a holder."
4.0,"This dress is very cute and it fits well, my caveat is it appears to have the potential to easily wrinkle and that's what keeps me from giving it 5 stars."
4.0,Good value and quality product.
4.0,"The costume is cute! I ordered the 5T for my kid who is 2 months away from being 5 years old. She’s average height and weight. It fits like a 6 though for sure. She’ll be able to wear it for years lol. The mask fits her perfectly, so it will probably be too small for a lot of kids that order true to size.<br /><br />The hands and feet are attached. I can see it being a problem when she’s ready to eat, and her shoes will cover the design on the feet.<br /><br />Lastly, your kid will definitely need help using the restroom. It would be difficult for an adult wearing this costume to be able to unzip it without help."
4.0,"I'm about 5'4"" and usually wear a size 16/18 and this fit perfectly. The material was a little different then expected, but there is pockets!! Super excited about that, will look great with a petticoat!"
4.0,"This sweater is super cozy, warm yet lightweight. It fits true to size."
4.0,"I like the brightness of this light , but it’s a pain to strap it around your body, especially in the winter while wearing bulky coats. I just decided to put it over my head instead. Much easier. I use this to walk my dogs at night at it makes me feel much safer."
4.0,Nice print and comfy
4.0,"I sent this to my friend for Christmas, she loves elephants and anything pink.  She said she loved it!"
4.0,I love the simplicity of this pair of earrings. Worth every penny I spent! Met my expectation.I have people notice and ask about these earrings.
4.0,It has a quality look and feel. It was a little hard to put the bands at first. May do a follow up review.
4.0,"They look great. Only issues I had were that the shiny one started to chip and flake rather quickly, and they started irritating my skin. I don't think that is any fault of their own, I just must be sensitive to whatever is on it. 4 star is only for the flaking."
4.0,This Key chain is beautiful. It looks just like the photo and has a pretty detail on the other side of the dragonfly. For me this was a statement piece because its very stylish. I love it!
4.0,"I bought this for my 14 year old nephew and I took a chance and got him the XL. Glad I did, as they run a bit small. The length is perfect since my nephew is 5'10.  Now he wont stop wearing the damn thing ...lol.<br />Wish they were a bit cheaper so I could buy more often."
4.0,The upper part is not body shaped. Too high in front part. Not comfortable. Only legs are ok.
4.0,"I was hesitant to buy this dress without any reviews, but it was so cute on the model that I decided to take a chance. I am normally between a small and medium and went with the medium just to be on the safe side. I probably could have bought a small, but it may have been too tight in the bust (36D), even with the elastic smocking. The hips/waist of the dress has a little extra fabric, making me look a little larger than I am, hence why a small would have fit better in this area. It has a small zipper on the side, which is not the best quality, but it works. The dress looks pretty much like the picture, though the straps are a little smaller and set slightly further in than shown on the model. All in all, this was a good purchase and I might buy another color in size small."
4.0,"Feels good, like the material."
4.0,"Great shirt, just undersized. The emblem could be better defined and higher quality. Overall it's just an OK shirt."
4.0,Great shirt. Not too flimsy like others I have bought.
4.0,Good &#34;one size&#34; robe. I got it for after water Aerobics classes that are outdoors. So far so good
4.0,Quality is expected for the price. Decent.
4.0,It’s a tad bit snug around the waist but other than that I love It!
4.0,They look quite fetching on my wife. The fit however is a tad more than just snug and the fingers are about 1 cm too long. (I purchased size L)
4.0,"I purchased this for my husband, it has been a great ring, few scratches on the metal but resin over the carbon fiber still looks great and is clear. no complaints here!"
4.0,I was hoping the arms of the glasses would be thinner. They are too thick for my smaller face. They work fine and are a cool concept if they were not so bulky.
4.0,Christmas present for my daughter she loved it and it's really pretty almost kept for myself especially since I love butterflies.
4.0,"Although it states gold, it has more of a rose gold tint to it.  Beautiful, nonetheless.  I am choosing to keep because it is beautiful."
4.0,"Great coat. I get lots of compliments on how it looks.<br />The hood doesn't stay up while I walk in the wind and rain so I have to hold it in place.<br />It's a pretty thin coat. Perfect for this cold California winter, but wouldn't be good for temperatures below freezing."
4.0,I bought these to wear under button up shirts. Bought a size smaller than i normally wear. They look great as they have a higher collar than regular tank top/undershirts. It is not a traditional tank top fit but they work very well for my purposes.
4.0,"Purchased this for my child's school project. It was much smaller than I had hoped for, but it will work. In my opinion it does not look antique.  Received on time."
4.0,"This is a very nice dress, but in my opinion there's way too much fabric that is doesn't allow split to be visible. I am a size 12 regularly and ordered a size 14 based on other reviews. I sent in my custom measurements, which were closer to size 14 than size 12 so size up.  I still had to get the bust area altered. I got lots of compliments nonetheless."
4.0,I’m impressed with the quality of this leotard compared to others I’ve ordered. The fabric is thick and perfectly stretchy. I’d give it 5 stars if the fit was adjusted so that the top was higher cut- it’s a tad low on my 4-year-old.
4.0,"These socks fit well. They have good stretch and come up almost to my knee without feeling tight or cutting into the skin. They are soft and warm, but I don't consider them either heavy or cushioned. They are warm and very comfortable, but not as thick as I'd like for really cold weather. I would recommend if you're looking for a warm and comfortable sock, but not if you're looking for a ski sock."
4.0,frames  are crap but the lenses are awsome
4.0,"Easy fitting, light and replaceable. A no worries, casual layabout."
4.0,I bought these as a gift and my daughter absolutely loves them!!
4.0,"The top area of the dress is a bit thin so may need a certain kind of bra because it is visible , I'm curvy and it was flattering to my curves , bueatiful bright pink color .I however didn't notice the ruffles arms in the advertisement photo so didn't expect or care for that part of the dress"
4.0,"Great mask! I've received compliments and pictures all evening. One issue though. After an hour, the bridge area of my nose began to hurt. After partying in it for several hours and taking it off. I was in pain. My nose hurt for two weeks.<br /><br />I have a small framed face and I don't have big nose, but for those that have a bigger nose than I?  Don't purchase it. It fits very snug."
4.0,"I was *very* skeptical about this dress when I ordered it and it was definitely a gamble. One size up and I would have looked like I was wearing a drape. However, ordering a small was the right call, if a little small around my wider hips. I can see how easily this dress could be unflattering on certain straight/square body shapes especially if you order the wrong size. The material looks/feels a little cheap, but with the right accessories I think it'll be fine. Also! The wrinkles are very hard to get out so if you're getting this for a certain event definitely give time for wrinkle removing!"
4.0,"This wallet is exactly what I've been looking for. Great look, seems durable, great for front pocket carry.<br /><br />But this is for basics only!  3 credit cards, a little cash and an ID (BTW: there is no cover for the ID, it fits snugly under the edges).<br /><br />Like I said, it's what &#34;I&#34; was looking for. If you need to carry more, this isn't for you. It's carbon fiber and not flexible."
4.0,Super cute although I havent worn them yet due to the fact that i didnt realize they were double flare
4.0,"The first pair that arrived came with a broken clasp, which Amazon let us exchange for a new pair without a problem. These are lovely, delicate earrings. For the price and size, they're understandably thin. Not the nicest, but if you want big cheap white gold hoop earrings, they do the job!"
4.0,Like the material.  I am a size 16 and bought an  x-Large and fit as expected.
4.0,"Fabric is not my favorite as the outside is kind of rough, but otherwise a fantastic dress."
4.0,"I like the earrings - they have a nice finish and feel to them. They are fine for casual, everyday wear."
4.0,"The tag says it's an XL, which fits my daughter like her other shirts which are Juniors large.  I believe because it was made in China, i'm thinking it runs small. I bought an XL so my daughter would fit in it for awhile, she is 14 and 5 ft 8, she usually wears junior large shirts. But this fits her perfect now.  It's really cute too. She gets complimented often.  Would reccomend getting one size up than what you usually wear."
4.0,Like these for price!
4.0,"My boyfriend loves it, hes a truck driver and it was the most fitting Valentines Day/Birthday Gift. Now he'll always be reminded that he is thought of and how he should always drive with caution."
4.0,"Looks great wife loved it, so far so good"
4.0,Fits well for my 6 years son.
4.0,Liked the pants! Just too small on the waste! I’m 160lbs 5’9” and XL didn’t fit my waste.
4.0,Looks just as pictured...pretty! hope stones don't fall off
4.0,"Very cute and moderately sexy. I ordered the XL based on the size chart, however, I'm normally a L and that's what I should have ordered."
4.0,Would buy these again
4.0,"Very very elegant dress, but also casual. Pretty and light but very see through, i bought the white one and it needs a slip"
4.0,"One of the zippers gets stuck, but this bag is great overall! Very happy"
4.0,Too cute. Too small but cute
4.0,It's an ok hat for the price! I was hoping for more of a classic baseball cap fit but it's the more modern &#34;slouchy&#34; type. Works great for the price and I like the simplicity.
4.0,"My daughter asked for new seamless underwear. I thought this was a nice assortment of neutral colors. She wears a juniors size medium to large or a misses small to medium. She's 5'7&#34; and weighs about 130 pounds. These fit her well and are very comfortable. They do seem a little longer than other boy short styled underwear that she has worn in the past. Because they are longer, they do hang below some of her shorts so she has to push the legs up at times. Overall, she does like them."
4.0,Very pretty fits good<br />Pretty colors
4.0,The sizing is slightly off but great quality of fabric and feels great
4.0,Love these shorts they're super cute but the hips are so wide.
4.0,"Quick delivery and very nice looking. I get compliments when it hangs out, and it's very eye catching. Not too big, not too small for a average man's neck. Quality is good."
4.0,"Very nice, tried to buy more but they had no more in stock"
4.0,"Love love love these. First off they are adorable. I do wish these we as warm as the regular sorel joan of arctic boots but they are warm to an extent. Totally waterproof. They do slouch a little by the ankle but iys not really unflattering. Pricey so I would have hoped for wjay I mentioned, a little more warmth and more sturdy. The tread is awesome and they are reallt comfortable, even at 28 weeks pregnant the wedge doesn't bother me at all. If you're looking for a warmer winter boot these aren't it. But for regular snow and rain id recommend."
4.0,"Beautiful product! My only qualm is that the fringe isn't secured so the threads come loose, but other than that it's absolutely gorgeous!"
4.0,Love the style and colors. Great price for the watch. Perfect compliment. Only dislike was the size of the date. We are seniors she has difficulty reading date in the small window. Other than that a overall nice watch.
4.0,"The boots are very nice and not cheaply made,sadly they rin about a size too small,so my daughter cant wear them and size 12 is highest sizing that they have,So I'd suggest getting a size bigger cause the lining is thick and fluffy (comfy) Overall I love them if they fit"
4.0,"If you're planning to put this with a Green Submariner, be aware that the color is close, but not quite there. This strap has a little more of khaki undertone as opposed to the pure green of the Sub. It might be close enough for some, but it would bug me personally.<br />On the Milgauss, however, it looks perfect! Matches the edge of the crystal like it was made to go together, and fits the lugs seamlessly.<br />It comes with spring bars, and isn't too difficult to install if you have the right tools.<br />My only real complaint is that these are relatively short. I'm 6' with an average build and can wear it and even still have a hole to spare, but another 8-10 mm of length would have been appreciated.<br />Overall, it's not quite as nice as the name brand straps. I've worn Everest and RubberB and they are admittedly a little better overall... But for a fraction of the price, it's hard to beat."
4.0,Very nice necklace. Received lots of compliments.
4.0,Good quality. Perfect for my baby.
4.0,Cute and my daughter loves it. A bit pricey for what you really get.
4.0,"Decent for the price. My old bag finally gave out, so I needed to get a new one of the same style. Will probably last for a while. Seems adequately constructed for my needs."
4.0,"Total rip off at $25, but wanted 100% cotton short set with Anna on it and this was my only option. Definitely was purchased at the Disney Store then resold (still had sticker on it). Pjs were as expected. I prefer a non-skin-tight fit and size 7 worked perfectly for not skinny kid who is between a 5-6T in clothes. Shirt is a bit long but that’s okay."
4.0,"Okay, but not as comfortable as other brand I bought. Feels a bit scratchy. Length good. Colors good. Also seems to run a bit small."
4.0,Me gusta mucho el vestido. Mido 5'2 peso 133 lbs. Compre size S y queda un poco mas grande de lo que esperaba. Usando un cinturon ajusta bastante bien. El Color no es el de la foto pero creo que me gusta mas el color que recibi. Ya habia visto un review anterior y tenia en mente que el color talvez seria differents al de la foto. Llego en aprox 5 dias y esta muy bonito.
4.0,"I wish the fabric was a little lighter.  This bugger is heavy, but it's exactly what I wanted.  Comfy for curling up on the chair or couch."
4.0,Theyre a little loose but theyre beautiful! But i have pretty skinny legs
4.0,"This wallet just arrived so I don't have any info about the long term durability, but it looks nice. It is a pretty minimalist wallet. U.S. Dollars barely fit in it and with cards in the pockets it has a tendency to pop open when not in a pocket. But I really like the idea of it being made of reused bicycle tires. On mine you can still see the seam from how the tube is put together."
4.0,Got this for my boyfriend and he gets tons of compliments. It's light weight and looks really good on his wrist. We did have to buy him a little watch repair kit to remove the extra links. Also there was a tiny little chip out of the face which is barely noticeable so we didn't bother sending it back. Overall I would definitely recommend this product.
4.0,Nice but the sequins itch. Can't complain too much though I looked great. Out of the 1920s.
4.0,They have a denim look to them with a twist over the toe.  They are comfy but not super cushy so I'm not sure I could wear them more than a few hours.  The heel in narrow but the toe box fits my wide feet.  These fit me but run a little on the shorter side so if you are between sizes size up.
4.0,"I just received this watch so I can’t really speak about durability, but if any issues pop up I’ll be sure to update.  In my opinion this is a nicely made watch, true to picture. It is a bulkier watch, I think the size would typically be worn by men, but I’m a female who prefers a more substantial watch, so the size is perfect for my purposes. It’s a very simple design, not to busy or flashy but it is unique enough that it will attract some eyes. Despite being a large watch it is not heavy at all, so it doesn’t feel like it is in the way, or weighing down your arm. I’m actually used to heavier metal watches so that it something I’m having to get used to. The band is a bit big for my wrist, and it may be adjustable but I haven’t bothered trying to figure that part out yet.  The sandalwood watch is dark enough that it is hard to really see the wood grain so it is a bit more subtle, than the lighter on would be, I think. That said I do plan on getting one of the lighter ones for some variety.<br /><br />Watch arrived on time, in simple but nice packaging. Would be great as a gift.<br /><br />My only issue at the moment is that i  wish the logo was a darker font on the face of the watch."
4.0,"Stretchy material like all of their other dresses, fits very nice. I purchased the small, I'm 5&#34;2, 36C, 29 waist.... The only small flaw is that The pattern of the plad is printed on the fabric so if you stretch the fabric too much you can see the patter separate/crack which makes it look a bit cheap.... But as long as it fits you and it's not being overly stretched it is a beautiful dress."
4.0,Happy with my purchase. Very nice company.
4.0,Shoes are very comfortable. I am a older marshmallow lady. The shoes are comfortable but after a month I got a bad case of plantar fasciitis. Had to mix it up and wear the hard core shoes I have to clear up the problem. But the shoes are great for around the house. Great I don’t slip and slide on my concrete floors too.
4.0,"I'm a 5'3&#34;, 120 lbs, cup B, size 4 and ordered a size L. The bra fitted perfectly and the bottom part was somewhat large but it did fit me. I cannot wait to wear this bikini!"
4.0,Probably my fault but I ordered a large and it is way too big. Buy your typical size. It’s cute but really thin.
4.0,"Very wearable/comfy! Just a tad thermal-ish, as in, kind of heavy and not breathable but typically sequins aren’t known to be breathable. Totally perfect for what I needed though."
4.0,They fit good and are cute for the price. They are a little thin and don't look as good as the picture. I like them for the price though.
4.0,"Super cute suit, got lots of compliments. I ordered a large (I'm a 32 DDD) and the top fit well. Bottoms also fit well (size 8/10)."
4.0,"This shirt is really cute exactly what I wanted, but the only think i find to look weird and bad is the collar of this shirt looks stretched out and worn, so I'll have to send it back and order a new one to see if it was just the shirt I got or if it's the design of the shirt."
4.0,I love the dress I really do. It fits and looks cute but a diagram on how the removable peices fit would be nice
4.0,"So I got this tie because who does not like a tie that showcases Unicorns? Well, I had to see how it would functionally fit on a medium sized guy that is 5'8""  before I gave it a public debut so I compared it to one of my favorite ties that fits perfectly to my body type. First off the tie has a nice feel, but not as ""soft"" as a silk tie, because this is 100% polyester... It does allow you to tie a decent knot (I use a double Windsor) but that is where the good points end with this tie. On a preference negative, it is a bit skinny, on the functionality it is over 6 inches shorter than my standard favorite tie. The skinny part I could see past because it is a specialty print, but for the 6 inches shorter, well you will not be able to tuck in the tag end of the tie when wearing it, so eventually it will look a little sloppy if it pokes out from behind the already skinny tie. This would work great for a kid or a smaller person, that does not need the length or width of a standard width/length tie. Overall a nice tie with a cool print."
4.0,Very nice shirt with good saturated pink coloring. Highly recommend if you like shakets.
4.0,"Blouse is ok, a little big and wrinkles easily. But I like the color and can wear with belt."
4.0,Very nice for the money. Longer than most
4.0,Muy pequeña s
4.0,I'm always on fire.......
4.0,"I love this dress! I put on high heels and jewelry and wore it to church, and later wore it with sandals to a summer party! My one criticism, the top part is too long to be empire waist and too short to be at the natural waist, it lands somewhere awkwardly in between. But it's perfect for a breastfeeding mommy!"
4.0,A gift for a friend that likes novelty socks. She said they were cute but on the thin side.
4.0,"Good product.  The thing is that card holder that holds 3 cards in 1 slot (at the edge of the 1 side) gets a little loose and if you shake it, the cards will fall out.  I like the money clip function as well as the quick card access on the other side."
4.0,"The item description at the time I purchased said it fit a head circumference of 50-53cm.  I measured my son's head and it was 52cm.  When it arrived, we put it on and it is far too small.  It's great quality, hence why I give it 4 four stars.  But I think the head circumference maximum should be 50cm or possibly smaller.  Be sure to measure before you purchase."
4.0,These sunglasses are awesome. They're really comfortable. The nose supports fit my nose perfectly. I love the shape. They look really good. They're big just like I like them. I love oversized sunglasses. I love how the lenses are lighter on the bottom and darker up too. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because I bought the red pair no they're definitely not red. In the light they're a deep maroon and inside they look kind of purple. I really wanted a true red pair of glasses. However I love the shape so much I still wear them everyday. I will be buying these in other colors. I've added a picture to show anyone who wants to buy the red what they look like in dim lighting. I took this picture in the shade. So if you want a true red then this isn't for you but if you're getting black then you'll love them.
4.0,Lot cheaper than buying in stores and decent quality.  Washes OK
4.0,"I was surprised by how well the magnets hold the shade lenses in place. I've bumped them all over the place riding public transportation and they've stayed put.  The clear lenses can be traded for your prescription if you want - that would be more convenient than always trading off but, for now, I'm satisfied with these sunglasses as is.<br /><br />I think they look cool.  They're not aviator or military style but lean towards that look.  I like them."
4.0,Cute! Pretty much what I expected.
4.0,Fits nicely.  Material is a bit thin but based on price it is to be expected.
4.0,"The material is nice and soft, and the color is rich, however, the XS, which is the size I almost always wear, was too small, not like the one the model is wearing. I would not recommend the XS except for a child, in order to get the right fit."
4.0,I like that now I can carry my contents without have to carry a really larger purse.  Like that it has firm sides.  Just wish that the magnet closure was a little stronger.
4.0,"I gave these as stocking stuffers for Christmas.  Just in time fir the winter.  Wow... everyone is happy with them. Sound is fine when talking on the phone, but haven’t used it for music yet.  So glad everyone loves these hats."
4.0,Quality was good but the size ran a little too big for me.
4.0,"The dress was purchased for me to wear to my daughters Debutante Ball. I felt it was a little to revealing for the occasion being the mother. I probably could have wore it had the skirt part underneath been a little longer. So, I gave it to my 23 year old daughter who loved it. She received a lot of compliments that night."
4.0,Lovely fit material is thick
4.0,"Bought these for a girls camp. We used them for a craft. They turned out to be perfect for tie dying with Sharpies! The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is the tags made small holes in the bandana. But overall, product is as expected."
4.0,"I received this watch on time and well packaged. The watch is a beautiful blue with just the right amount of bling surrounding the face. The roman numerals are easy to see on the blue face. Style wise the watch looks good and it keeps time. What I don’t like is the fact it is large and I have to take out links. Well, not me actually because I was not having good luck with trying to maneuver the little tool that came with it, but my son somehow managed to get it done for me. Somewhat inconvenient but livable. For the price point, this is a nice watch and I guess if you look at the link issue positively.. at least you can get the watch to fit you exactly (as long as you can get the links out).<br />Disclosure – This product was received at a discount in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.

4.0,"Looks really nice, seems to be well made and will last. Wife loved it"
4.0,This was a gift to one of my best friend. She loved this chatm
4.0,Love it. But did not fit the way I thought it would
4.0,"I wear a 7 1/8 fitted hat and the S/M fits a little loose but snug enough to look proper. It's decent material, and the letters shine nicely at night. I'm law enforcement and I recommend it."
4.0,Work well for me. Wish more sizes were available so i don't need to cut the larger sizes down.
4.0,I have 38h girls. I wore this with a black bra and wore it as a top not a dress. Stretchy material that you can adjust with the open sides ties. Loved this.
4.0,Very nice. Wonder if they may be to warm in the summer.
4.0,"I love the way they feel,  but was a little disappointed that I have to tie them,  was hoping they were velcro also . ."
4.0,Love rocket dog perfect support
4.0,So these are a gift. They do feel super comfortable though and it looks nice.
4.0,It's cute just alittle bit long on me lol I'm 5 feet ordered small  the material is thick enough
4.0,"They were a little tight , but I cuffed it below my knee and it resolved the issue."
4.0,Need these Magnified Glasses for small objects around the house. My every day glasses on reader side just were not Clear enough. So my Eye Doc recommended me to get a pair of these glasses!<br />WoW they are great - maybe now I can finish my honey due list!!! LoL
4.0,"The purse is a little STIFF, hard to get things in and out of, hopefully this will relax with usage.  I also had to add more holes, there are only a few holes on the strap which made it very long, and the little loop that holds the strap is stationary, I would have liked for it to slide on the strap to hold the two straps together."
4.0,Nice looking belt. True to size in my case: some people complained it runs small but it was perfect for me. It didn't come with any instructions as to how to attach a buckle but it's very straightforward. I'll see how the buckle mechanism holds up.
4.0,"First of all; it's well constructed, of good-seeming material. The denim is not thick or stiff, but soft and comfortable to wear. As for sizing; I'm 5'10&#34; and about 170, not fat or particularly broad-shouldered - I'm your prototype Average Sized Guy, and the Extra-Large size fits EXACTLY. Not loose or tight, big enough to wear A shirt underneath. It's also unlined, so if you're looking for a jacket for warmth this isn't it. It's for looks and moderate temperatures, and for those criteria it works very well. The faded look is also well done, doesn't appear badly artificial. Good deal for the monehs."
4.0,Nice light weight fishing shirt. Fit is loose and comfortable.
4.0,"Beautiful dress I wore for my graduation pictures and for my graduation ceremony. It is the perfect burnt orange color and I love the sleeves, however it was too short for me. The waist would roll up under my boobs, due to the stretchy fabric so it made it even shorter and I had to keep pulling it down as it almost showed my butt. But it is a beautiful dress nonetheless."
4.0,A little smaller than I expected so can't get much in it but I do like it. Reminds me of the 60's when I had one.
4.0,Ok gift to a young person.
4.0,Nice if you want some thing for just a gag gift or one days use
4.0,This dress came in a timely manner and was beautiful!! Great price as well! My little sister loved it.
4.0,Bought for my daughter for Christmas. They are cute but small so be aware of that.
4.0,"For the size, I expected a little more room in the chest. The little snap seems a bit hard pressed to keep everything in the top.<br />Color is pretty although the belt and dress seem a bit off. The gathering on the back creates a bit of a bubble above the booty; I think a tighter/wider belt might help create more of a hourglass look."
4.0,Feels sturdy and gets the job done. A bit disappointed that the tinytan chibi is not 3D<br />:( but it’s still adorable 🥰
4.0,"They're light weight and feel like a toy but they look cool and the lenses check out. I got the matte finish. In hind sight, I think the regular finish would've been better. I took them to an optometrist office and had them checked. They confirmed the UVA/UVB rating and that they're polarized. I already have a similar style of sunglasses that are Polarized/UVA/UVB protective. I bought these as a spare pair in case I lost mine. When I tried them on, I was blown away by how much more clear everything looked through these than through my old ones. They're now my primary sunglasses. If you're just looking for eye protection but don't want to spend a lot, these are perfect."
4.0,"4 stars only because it says mid-rise but they are not, these are low-rise"
4.0,Extremely cute runs a little small but loved it on grand baby
4.0,Fits Moto 360
4.0,Nice piece.....looks great !  Son...loved it !
4.0,"The material was weird, but it dressed up very nice."
4.0,"Very nice boots. I wear a size 7 comfortably with socks normally, but I have to wear nylons with these boots to be comfortable. I would go half a size bigger in the future."
4.0,"I've had other casio watches, the night light on this one is basically useless. It only has a bulb on one side. At night, you can only read the hour. the minute side is too dark to read."
4.0,"Just arrived, so have only tested in-house.  A little tricky to figure out since there are no instructions, but the clips are locking clips, with no springs, so should be very secure.  You have to lift the tab on the back of the clip to open the toothed jaws (see photo, shown with one clip open, and the other closed.)  Then press the tab to lock shut.  No metal parts to rust that I can see, so should be good at the beach.  Coiled cord should absorb shock if wind grabs hat, so should hold well.  Bottom line, a little tricky to use, but I expect it to work well, presuming the plastic parts are durable."
4.0,"The fabric was more slinky than I expected but it is very comfortable.  I ordered a size larger than I usually do but I think I could have ordered my usual size and been fine.  I am 5'3"" and 240 pounds.  Most of my weight is in my stomach and hips.  This dress covers them nicely without being too clingy.  I would recommend this dress."
4.0,Good quality. The silicone top doesn't stay too well after a couple wears. But very opaque and good quality stockings
4.0,Slightly big. Should have purchased the medium. Good otherwise
4.0,"I love this dress... it's beautiful! Fits great. I had a baby 2 weeks ago and it is super flattering. The fabric does not feel cheap at all. And it looks like it will be super convienent to breastfeed in. The only problem is the design placement. On each boob I have a flower with a dark center... it looks like nipples!!! Like I'm trying to draw attention to my boobs :(  ugh, if not for this it would be perfect for the wedding I'm attending in 2 weeks. I'm going to return the dress and order another to see if I get luckier with placement."
4.0,"The light weight & 3/4 sleeves robe was good for a cover-up when doing housework.  Not binding, comfortable.  I would have liked it better in a dark color"
4.0,"I have mixed feelings on this thing. My skin didn't negatively react to it, so that was great. But it is TIIINNYYYY. If I am not very careful it falls out. It is so thin you really cannot even feel it moving, which is nice until it falls out and the only reason you know it fell out was the sound it made by hitting the floor. I don't hate it and will continue wearing it, but I don't just love it either."
4.0,"They shoulda put an actual cuff on this thing. It's for very small ears BUT you can bend it carefully, not sure how, but I manage to make it stay on my ear"
4.0,"Comfy, but thin material"
4.0,"This dress is incredibly sexy and I’m using it both as a cosplay piece and as just a sexy dress for Vegas, and it definitely works for both. I just feel like the picture is a bit misleading because it’s not as smooth as pictures, it definitely has more of a crinkly look because of the patent leather, but it still looks hot. Still recommend it!"
4.0,"Just the style I was looking for, for a great price."
4.0,Little wider than my bra but made it fit.
4.0,"Pretty.  Smaller than I thought that they would be, but work well with my Swarovski necklace and wrist chain.  The earrings back is small, I changed it out of fear of losing the earrings."
4.0,"Cute, but make sure to size down! I normally wear a large and definitely could have went with a small."
4.0,"So cute but runs large, I got a small"
4.0,Pants fit as expected. Arrived on earlier than expected. Thread in some areas is very loose. After my first wash I had a huge hole under the zipper area.
4.0,"POCKETS!! We need subtle, small pockets, just like every “ Grecerelle” dress that I have purchased. This label will not be visited again"
4.0,I love the cut and fabric. I read all the reviews. It’s just too big. I need a large not and extra large. Will send it back and get the correct size.
4.0,Now I can find everything. Would be even nicer with side pockets.
4.0,It's cute. The elastic gets all disambiguated and twisted while wearing.
4.0,I love the ViV collection. They are so soft and comfortable!
4.0,"very nice for the price, actually looks like genuine stones."
4.0,"Nice, a bit unusual, and looks like good costume jewelry.  I expect it will be worn often."
4.0,"Really cute, cheapish material but it IS a costume. Fit as expected, and also had a little stretch in it so it was comfy."
4.0,"Nice chain that feels sturdy but not too heavy, however, the one I received is not 1 cm, it's about 5 mm.  Too skimpy looking with my bag so returning it. I can't say anything about how it holds up but looked nice."
4.0,The recipient didn't like it so much.  lol  But it was authentic.
4.0,"Soft, very thin and stretchy material. Would suggest getting a size smaller. Is not see through."
4.0,"These tights are great for hiking or if you just prefer a thicker legging. The zipper pockets are very useful. I bought these because of the UPF protection, but was happy I had these on a recent hike where I had to climb over a huge down tree. The tights did not snag on the bark! Will probably purchase the higher rise, as well."
4.0,"So far the wallet is nice. The metal lettering is scuffed and damaged. The wallet itself has some discoloration. It almost looks a little dirty, and has a random blue streak. I will try cleaner on it and see what comes off. The zipper sticks but with some wax that can be fixed. The wallet is a nice size. It holds all my cards and is not bulky feeling. It smells really strongly of leather. It seems to be holding up well. Overall I really like it, and I think it was worth the money. I will update if that changes."
4.0,"I believe that there are several types of rubber watchbands available for Luminox watches. The soft silicone one that came with my Series 8200 watch (a $75 pawn shop find) was torn, so I replaced it with a cheap PVC strap from WalMart. Aftermarket 23mm bands aren't easy to find. At that time, I was seeing genuine Luminox rubber-type straps going for over $60 online. The $12 one from Walmart lasted a couple of years and is still wearable...but since it was apparently made from PVC plastic, it was initially pretty stiff. That stiffness only got worse as time went on and I figured that it wouldn't be long before a crack developed. So, I decided to bite the bullet and buy a genuine Luminox replacement.<br /><br />Luminox apparently made some design changes to the Navy Seal-type watches over the years and the new watches have narrower bands. The FP.L ES 23mm band I received is made from polyurethane rather than silicone. Polyurethane is a much tougher plastic than silicone so this one should last quite a while. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a bit stiffer than I expected...no where near as stiff as the PVC WalMart cheapie I had been using but somewhat more so than the old (torn) silicone band that originally came with my watch. I will say that the double clasp system is really secure and the two keepers (rectangular loops the free end of the band go through) are as heavy-duty as the band itself. If anything, this band is actually a bit of work to take off. Again, not a bad thing in a watch band intended to be used on a watch where vigorous activity is involved."
4.0,Liked it but a little bit overpriced...
4.0,I love it! Everyone asks &#34;where did you get that?&#34;
4.0,"Great costume. The material was kinda see through so have your child wear dark undergarments. It’s a full one piece including the hands, so you have to take everything off to wash your hands. There is a zipper in the crotch for your son to go to the bathroom but it’s better to just take it completely off so your child’s hands don’t get dirty and he can wash them. For the price, this is a great purchase. I would recommend"
4.0,I loved this tracksuit. It was form fitting and was bright and screamed springtime.  The bright pink just made you feel confident. The bottoms were tight and if you wear dark colored underwear it will show through. This could be a negative or a positive but the material is a little thin. It may just wear out a little faster after several washes due to the thinnest of the fabric. But I liked the texture and how it fit. Other may not like that it is a little see through on the bottom. The top was less see through.
4.0,Great colour and quality but even at the tightest part they are loose on my wrist
4.0,"This bag is well constructed with the exception of the zipper. As another reviewer pointed out, the zipper does not go completely across the top of the bag. That said, the bag is so attractive and useful that I don't really care about the zipper. I use this bag for everything, from carrying my laptop for work, to packing a few things for an overnight stay, to transporting a few pairs of ballroom dance shoes and accessories for recreational dancing. The bag is stylish and is easy to carry, either by the handles or using the included cross-body shoulder strap. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4.0,Nice bathing suit. A little small but very cute.
4.0,"For the price, these are not bad. Just smaller than they appeared to be. I like them and they included what I assume was a free gift, a gold rose charm and a tiny “ruby” heart. The chain is not long enough for me, but I can use my own chain. They very nice."
4.0,"These are beautiful little shoes I bought for my daughter who loves to run around the house and dress up like a ballerina/princess. Boy did she put them through the ringer. I imagine if someone were to buy them for a performance or something it'd be just fine but within the first couple of days, the rhinestones and stuff were falling off. The actual shoes seem to be surprisingly well made as in they aren't actually falling apart yet, and I like that they have rubber soles which means she can't slip while running in them, but most of the decorations have fallen off by now. If you don't mind that or don't mind gluing rhinestones back on, the price is great and they are adorable."
4.0,"I purchased these for a Night Nation Run in Chi. I  ordered a XL, but could have used a 2xl for my 5'4""/178lb body. Soft fabric, no rolling at the waist, just needed more in the rear.  I would buy again"
4.0,Comfortable and fits as expected.  Great to wear around the house.
4.0,"order a size up. for reference I'm 5'4 138 just had a baby 11 weeks ago, I am normally a medium I ordered a large.  it's a cute little dress personal I feel like in person it looks a little.... old lady ish lol. just not really my style but for a beach day or cover up its cute and if your worried about it being see through... it's not necessarily see through but if you have a big but and little dimples or cellulite yes you can see it a little bit"
4.0,Needs pockets!!! But comfortable and stylish.
4.0,They are great better construction than the last pair I had which were my favorites even though they were hopelessly scratched up.
4.0,"Very flattering, as they hug the ear in a simple, classic design. The posts are a bit wider then other hoop earrings and were a little uncomfortable at first but I got used to them after a couple of wears."
4.0,"Ran a little big, but I’m really petite. My only complaint is that it wasn’t like the picture at all; but more of the big wide petticoat. I thought from the pictures this one would have more of a flowing look. I wasn’t able to use it but it’s a good product overall. It received 4 stars for not being as described or pictured."
4.0,Beautiful. Nice quality. Colors were not what I expected but still beautiful.
4.0,I loved this sweater and got a lot of compliments on it but I was quite surprised at the fit.  It was very fitted.  I usually wear a small and in sweaters I like to go a bit bigger.  I ordered a medium and it fit me like a small.  It wasn’t suffocating but I certainly recommend ordering up 2 sizes
4.0,"I really like this bag and I have a few similar to it in style.  Many times I don’t want to lug around a huge purse everywhere.  Sometimes I just need my phone and my card/id.<br /><br />I like how simple this looks as it would go with any outfit.  I like how the strap is adjustable.  I like to wear it crossbody resting at my hip level.<br /><br />This bag has two zippers.<br /><br />With the larger zipper, the interior has a single pocket where you can place a few credit/id cards.<br /><br />The second zipper could accommodate small items.  I placed my phone (iPhone 7) and the top of it pokes out of the second zipper.<br /><br />The front is embossed with “Just For You Fashion Accessories”.  I ended up going over it with a sharpie as I don’t like branding.<br /><br />I wasn’t a huge fan of the hoop placement for where the strap attaches.  I don’t like how the loops are on one side of the purse.  It would feel more balanced while wearing if the loops were instead caddy-cornered.<br /><br />This bag came with some nail trimmers too.<br /><br />It’s a nice looking bag."
4.0,"The writing in gold is a little hard to see and at my mom's suggestion I took a thin point pen and outlines the letters to make it easier to see.<br />Shirt fits perfectly... which is great!<br />The red is vibrant red... a little too bright for my taste, but a wash should dull it out:)...<br />I wish it didn't come with the arrow through the heart, but it was a good price and it said just one simple thing, thankful, and not a whole paragraph of words like some of the shirts out there.<br />I'm thankful for all the good things God's given me, and even through tough times like now, I'm still thankful for the things He's given me in the past. Hopefully things will get better. Bless his name. That's why I wanted the shirt:) I'm Thankful. Also good for Thanksgiving:D!"
4.0,The color is perfect for the outfit I bought it for and they fit my arm just fine
4.0,"Read the reviews before purchasing but bought the pants anyway. Really like the pants will admit they fit real snug & they ripped on me in the leg area. I sewed them up, haven't worn them since washing. If they fit more comfortable I would buy another pair."
4.0,I like the comfort and fit of these bras.  They are a little large around.  They provide good coverage and are nice to exercise in.  They are super comfortable. I recommend them.
4.0,Small on my arms
4.0,There were so much glitter! It was everywhere. But the costume fit true to size and was super cute and lightweight. Probably not the best for a cold Halloween night.
4.0,"I like it is very well done, pretty strong. Maybe is a bit to rigid but it is a good product."
4.0,"Beautiful, vibrant colors, just as pictured, flattering fit, and I and have received many compliments on it.<br />The only drawback to the dress is the fabric is not super durable but it's such a pretty dress that the durability isn't an issue for me."
4.0,"Washed before I wore, softened the materials and tightened up the knit top. Adorable dress, amazing price."
4.0,"Love these, they don’t slip around or fall down inside my shoe.  I haven’t had an problem with the quality, no holes in mine the way some have reported in their reviews."
4.0,"Attractive however,<br />Unfortunate.<br />A bit larger for my face than optimal for use.  I’m a relatively small person but normally so. A large(er) person would love this mask.<br />I will likely use the filter to place into a smaller mask (trim if necessary) and keep the mask as a backup.<br />Has an artificial materials byproduct odor. You may desire to spray with an odor remover prior to use."
4.0,Polishes great.
4.0,Fun.  Lots of dinosaurs.
4.0,These were pretty comfortable. For me they rubbed a bit under the arm. Would be nice for casual wear but not high impact support.
4.0,"This is a very interesting, necklace.  First of all, the blue colored stone, is beautiful. It is surrounded in loads of shiney crystal chips.  When the lights hit it just right, it gives off an amazing sparkle. The pendant itself seems a little heavy, for the size of the chain, that it comes with.<br />I love the 3 dimension, shape of this necklace, It hangs very well.  The clasp is a lobster claw, so it opens and closes with little effort.  I received this product for free in exchange for a fair and unbiased opinion"
4.0,beautiful scarf - i would buy from this seller again
4.0,"Cons: one: I got a medium, my normal go to size, should have ordered large for it to look the way as advertised. Two:See<br />through<br />Pro: even tho its smaller that expected, still fits nice if not more flattering. Little tight on the arms but workable. Im 5'5"" 160# 36DD, size 8 in dresses normally. If you're underwear and bra are ""nude"" color, it blends and it being see through is not an issue. Would definitely buy again. For a fitted look I would do medium, for the advertised look I would buy a large."
4.0,helps keep luggage safe
4.0,had to figure out how to put it on but cute
4.0,"I wasn't sure about this type of band. I've never had much luck with them. But loved the look. Well, the watch has fallen off twice. Once just making the bed, the other time was in a store. I think it fell off when I took my coat off. I had to search for the slide clasp that had landed up against a bottom shelf.<br />I am returning it for a replacement. I'm hoping it was just a bad clasp and I don't have to return it for a refund.<br /><br />UPDATE: 2/26/20. Received the replacement watch within days.  Have been wearing for 2 days and, so far, the band clasp seems to be secure.<br />I do love the look of the watch, so I hope the clasp isn't an issue with this replacement."
4.0,"Wife wears this while riding horses...works great! However, I have a large battery backup 30k I believe, and it barely holds up for the whole ride (2-3hrs). South Dakota winters so take that for what it is."
4.0,"Very nice watch. Looks more expensive, than what I paid for it. Good deal."
4.0,The fit is good and comfortable. I didn’t realize they are lined with shorts. Love them!
4.0,nice but think i'll buy a wider band soon
4.0,Very cute skirt. Nice quality. Same skirt I’ve found in downtown stores. The style seems to run small. I’m a size 6 and ordered medium<br />Then ended  up buying a large to fit comfortably.<br />The customer service was very good in making sure I was a happy customer.
4.0,"Took the ball out, placed it in my ear, then couldn't put the ball back in. Ridiculous."
4.0,it will change the silver color
4.0,So cute!  It's very thin so just ordered a long slip.  At 5' it still comes above the ankle.  It's baggy but very cute.  I thought the stripe was pink but it''s black so I  didn't enlarge enough for all the details.
4.0,"These are absolutely beautiful, but after a few washes they stretched out quite a bit. I have many fluffy socks like this and this is the first brand that really stretched out after less than 10 Washings."
4.0,"Very comfy and they fit well. I’m 5’3 and 130 lbs and ordered Small.  I read the reviews before buying so to me, they’re exactly what I was looking for... fitted but not compression.<br /><br />I would like more different options of colors..... I was looking for the red one but it comes with a green I do not like and a blue (that I already got from another combination). Maybe the seller should offer the option of single item."
4.0,I like that these goggles are big enough to cover the eyes but not take the whole face. I also like that the band is thick and clicks instead of trying to wear it from the top which used to pull my son's hair and bother him.
4.0,They were for a family member and fit as was described.
4.0,I like it but chain to short have a hard time putting it on. Looking for more necklace but bigger ones. Thank you
4.0,very comfortable and durable. I received several compliments.
4.0,it's just somewhat large for me
4.0,nice neck round scarf
4.0,I ordered lightweight PJ's but I would consider these mid-weight.  I will keep them to wear in late spring & late fall.
4.0,My son was very happy with the towel
4.0,It’s very cute and good for wearing when running
4.0,"I purchased the slip-on gore boot model. I'd recommend going down a half size if you prefer a secure fit.<br /><br />Otherwise, great style and cool look. Very much a great value for the price."
4.0,Didn't fit my husband  but he insisted I tried it on and lol it fit...gives enough room to wear long sleeve knit underneath or thin sweater. Thank you
4.0,very nice made for small hands but nice
4.0,a little larger than expected but I still wear them
4.0,Nice slim wallet that doesn't crimp the credit card slots as some of these wallets do.  The RFID is a plus but I mainly bought it for the size and construction and pretty design.
4.0,"It was a bit big for my grandma’s wrist, but it was an easy enough fix"
4.0,"I say for the price it is a decent backpack, I love how stylish it is & I love that it’s anti theft. Only complaint I guess I have is that’s it’s super easy to adjust the straps so when I sometimes grab onto the straps it adjusts on it’s own. That doesn’t really bug me too much, but figured it’s worth mentioning."
4.0,"Nice, they have elastic bottom. They are very thin, but cute. More le pajamas or lounge wear."
4.0,These I like a lot better..more comfortable and fun colors
4.0,"Goes well with leggings, covers up enough of backside. Hang promptly from washer, will shrink"
4.0,"Lightweight, comfy. The liner many have complained about isn't bad unless you're trying to wear these with your boxers on."
4.0,"It's pretty big and heavy, like bigger and heavier that I thought it'd be, but at least it's not a cheap piece of crap that will break."
4.0,To be honest this was a great purchase because it came in two separate pieces. The dress fit perfectly however the white undershirt was a bit snug on the arms. All in all it looks great and I love the material.
4.0,Straps in back had to be altered to stay on.
4.0,Very cute and comfortable ☺
4.0,"My son is a huge fan. He's 10 yrs old and 55in bought him a thw ""150"" size and it's perfect.  Pants reminded me of MC hammer pants and when I showed him a video he actually did the dance. Great buy. And surprisingly the attire was well made despite that it came from China. Fabric was a sturdy, thick fabric not that light swishy see through fabric you normally see. 👍🏽"
4.0,They seem to work but I wish it had some sort of handle on the ends.  I have a VERY difficult time getting them out of my boots. Definitely easier to get in then to get out. I do not want to pull on the wires to do so which I have had to do.
4.0,"The zipper kept disengaging.  Had to keep zipping up snd down until it catched on both sides.  But., overall these boots are Hotttttt!##!  Awesome!  I want them in Black.  Do you have Black????"
4.0,The hat worked for my purposes and I liked it but I didn’t get a keychain and I’m sad about it.
4.0,"the lace is pretty, so is the color, but unfortunately the bust didn't get sized up with the rest of the dress so the waistband comes right under the bust. decent choice for the price tho"
4.0,The size was not true. Probably because they are used to wearing socks and tennis shoes. These are thin plastic shoes that are worn barefoot. It seems to be 2-3 sizes too big. My oldest typically wears a size 1 or 2 in children’s but could fit the size 11 perfectly.
4.0,I like these they are very pretty
4.0,Runs small. I wear medium and ordered x-large. They fit good except legs are tight.
4.0,Had a few that the connectors broke. Very bright color
4.0,"Got quite soft after I washed them, but overall, they fit great and are not see-through."
4.0,The designs are very cute and the price is great for good quality cotton shirts. I bought a 4T for my 35-pound 2 year old and it worked great -- maybe slightly large but I planned on that because cotton always shrinks in the washing/drying. It fits and he can wear them all summer!
4.0,Cute dress very fun and flowy. My daughter wore it to her junior prom. It's a thin sheer fabric so remember proper undergarments.
4.0,"Very nice pair of socks.  Purchased to try and eliminate some of the swelling that I have been having in my feet.  i haven't wore them long enough to know if it will help with the swelling.  Even if it doesn't, they are still a nice pair of socks.  I would purchase another pair.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Good for travel. Did not fit under seat. Had to place in overhead. Attached battery pack, but airline made me disconnect at security checks. Nice feature, but with heightened security cannot use battery pack."
4.0,These are great. Not easy to put on. But compression socks are not easy to put on. If they were wouldn't they be to big. lol. They are very comfortable.  Helps the legs and feet hurt less.
4.0,Like the design and the fit
4.0,"Beautiful, just  big on my stomach and under arms. I'm 100lbs , 32C, 5ft2in, hour glass figure/medium build and got size small. Love it though! Perfect look"
4.0,"Ordered smallest size for boyfriend, and they fit me better at 30+lbs heavier.<br />Good quality!"
4.0,Loved the slippers but my granddaughter did not like to wear them ?!?!
4.0,"Nothing to brag at here  but they are cotton so don't last forever but remain cool and comfortable. A bit long, loose and stretchy. Overall I'd buy again assuming the price was right"
4.0,"These came in early and fit just as expected. Love the look. The only reason these aren't getting 5 stars is because while they don't seem to easily rip, they are nylon and so on the second time wearing them, the black pair got a major rip. I don't mind because the other 3 look amazing and I already have another pair but these actually stay up and look very nice. Overall do recommend, but make sure you are careful putting them on, or have short nails."
4.0,"Nice Quality, but runs WAY too small.<br />Hubby usually wears a 40, ordered 42 to give him more room. Bought 2 pairs...both same result. Wasn't even close to buttoning them up! Sending back will buy something larger."
4.0,"The medium is pretty big, I can wear them & I usually order large. The non-fuzzy sensatec gloves are more true to size. My daughter cannot wear them, she needs a small.<br />The med will fit me, but my other sensatec gloves are ladies large."
4.0,"Showed up much faster than promised (like 4 weeks faster).<br />The only reason I'm holding back one star is I had NO idea how to size the band, and figuring out how to contact the vendor for the information wasn't very clear... it would be great if they could include the link to instructions in the packing...  fortunately my BIL was visiting when the watch arrived and was experienced with this kind of watch band, so he sized it for me in about 5 seconds.<br />I'm really hoping it holds up - because it looks fabulous!<br /><br />I also have to comment I was leary about this purchase due to the volume of reviews in exchange....  I paid full price and feel it was an excellent value."
4.0,"This is a nice, comfortable pack of hipsters.  A comfortable panty that provides a smooth fit underneath clothing."
4.0,"It runs a bit bigger. I ordered medium when small would have been perfect fit. But, not bad as you can layer."
4.0,I like it. I think my friend will be vry happy with it.
4.0,"This is a very cute yet comfortable outfit!<br />I am 5'3&#34; and 170lbs, typically a 14-16 in most clothes. I ordered an XL, but honestly think I should have gone with a L instead. But I am wearing it for an outdoor wedding next week, so I don't have time to return it.<br />It doesn't have a care tag inside, but their description gives an idea how to wash it.<br />The legs are too long for me, but I expected they would be. I'm now looking for tall summer sandals, or possibly will try the iron-on hemming fix.<br />The top is a tad big, and gaps open when I bend over, exposing my bra. I will safety pin it to help.<br />The material is forgiving, and this is very cute on!<br />The background color is very dark navy. I had to look at it in several different types of lights indoors and then in the sunlight to make sure it wasn't black. Not a big deal, but just FYI.<br />Even with the sizing issues, I love it, and will work around them. That's why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.<br />The company is in the UK, and advertised 5-7 business days for shipping. I ordered it 7/15 and it arrived on 7/28, so it wasn't on time, but it barely made it for my trip, so that's good! They did not provide a tracking number, so that made me nervous, but all in all, I would order from them again.<br />Bottom line, order it! But if you're in between sizes, I would get the smaller size."
4.0,very pretty and the mechanism works well. keeps time appropriately.
4.0,"I think its very cute but does stretch out quickly through the day. Basically a long muscle shirt but thicker. If you're trying to hide lumps in your figure, this is not the dress. Great for layering though!"
4.0,It nice and super soft from the inside and it fit nice and it super bright and i match with my converse
4.0,"Good shower flip flops for the gym.  Dry quick and are light.  I wouldn't want to walk around in them all day, but again they're comfortable enough for what they are."
4.0,"I love that it has pockets. The fit is great and it is cotton ,but it is a little heavy.That just means I can wear it in other seasons too"
4.0,dislike the zipper
4.0,"Brooks have been my go to brand for years. I've had two previous pairs of these lightweight trail shoes and loved them. I've run in Cascadias for years as well. Brooks have always run true to size meaning if you measure a 10 on a branick device then that's your size in Brooks. In Solomon, Saucony, Montrail, etc I've always gone to a 10.5."
4.0,Nice product but would like them to cinch up a little tighter.
4.0,"I like the uniqueness of this t-shirt and bought it for my son.  However I was surprised to find an eye in the top border of the design which I did not redily see when ordering.  Gave the shirt a more new age feel, and I am not into the new age.  I just like the keys sprouting and growing into a tree because music is life and I thought it was kinda cool.  If you don't like the new age then don't get this shirt."
4.0,"Beautiful!  Great sizing, soft as a tissue, plenty long enough to wear with stretch pants (modesty, ladies!).  Only warning...it develops terrible &#34;shoulder bumps&#34; from hangers!  Not sure what to do about this, as it seems like it would badly wrinkle if not hung.  I washed in cold, tumbled on very low for 20 minutes, then hung to continue to dry.  Minimal to no noticeable shrinkage.  Not all black/white/gray...there is some blue in the floral print patches, albeit muted."
4.0,very light weight but looks good
4.0,Very nice suit for the price!  Double check the sizing chart as I normally wear an 18 and ended up ordering a 7X for a perfect fit.
4.0,it's of good quality i just wished it came with instruction on how to use
4.0,"It's beautiful, and the cord is strong, and easy to wear! &#60;3"
4.0,"It's very pretty and functional with pockets and compartments.  Just one thing of complaint, the handle won't reach to carry on my shoulder."
4.0,Great cross but received with a small hole in center so a little disappointed and no variations as pictured
4.0,"Very pretty, does run big<br />Sellers very responsive and helpful"
4.0,"I really like this sweater. It's very comfortable. It's does run bit big though, but I would definitely buy again :)"
4.0,"As expected, thank you!"
4.0,Small fit but great quality
4.0,"There must be a &#34;new&#34; and an &#34;old&#34; version to this hat.  I have, what I'm pretty sure is the same hat in a different color, in the same size, and they fit very differently.  Not so much so to return it, plus I really like the blue color.  Using it for when I'm out on the ball field coaching softball.  Material is nice and thin and doesn't make you hot.  Also, there was a sticker on the bill, on the outside, that didn't come off very easily.  Took some hot water and some scrubbing to get the sticky residue off."
4.0,"I am 5' 9&#34; 145lbs 37x32x40 at the time of the second picture, and somewhat larger in the first picture. This is a good dress in which to lose the pregnancy weight. It's so comfy and I love the pockets. I hid a banana in there the other day. The pattern does look cheaper in real life than advertised, but it's still cute. I miss cotton, but this dress doesn't feel plasticky or sweaty, so I'll take it. This is a great dress for chasing the kids around the yard and taking pictures."
4.0,Nicely made hats and good value.  Unfortunately I got them as a gift but the person wound up not wanting it so I'm keeping it for Halloween or some other time I may need it.
4.0,"Great shirt, well printed picture... huge!"
4.0,"Looks good, got it for my husband who has a collection of Nixons. This one was his company colors, I wish it was metal though."
4.0,a nice fun stylish hat for my child.
4.0,Real Great
4.0,These were purchased for my 12 year old son who uses them for homework or school testing. He has a mixed sensory perception disorder and this headset successfully buffers all distracting noises.
4.0,daughter loves it -a bit too short from mom's standpoint.
4.0,"Very nice clip and you can expect good quality with NFL affiliated products. However, there is no box and it's in a cheap thin little cellophane wrapper. I wish this clip was in a decent box as it is a gift. You will gave to find a gift box if you get any of these NFL money clips."
4.0,"These socks are soft and adorable.  The size large has enough stretch to come to mid-calf on my 9 y/o granddaughter who wears size 5 shoes, and the elastic at the top holds them in place without leaving red marks on her legs.  Made of cotton, nylon, and spandex, the socks are thin but nicely made and can be hand or machine washed. A word of caution: in addition to the plastic cord near the tag, there's a metal staple holding each pair together at the toes so be sure to remove that as well before giving them to your child.<br /><br />Sample provided by manufacturer for evaluation."
4.0,"This is beautiful and is just as the picture appears. I am giving it 4 stars as it is actually 6.5 inches with a one inch extender, not 7 inches. Yes it still fits, but I definitely needed the extender."
4.0,"First, let me start by saying I do not review products often.  The picture, in my opinion, does not do the bracelet justice.  It looks much better in person.  Now, as to the &#34;Four Elements&#34; aspect to the bracelet, I am uncertain.  I have never worn a bracelet of this nature or even a magnetic therapy type bracelet.  I do have to say, after wearing it for about a week now, I have noticed a little better balance, but that could be because I just broke my ankle a few weeks ago and am having to balance myself all time.  After a few days I did notice a slight energy level increase, but again that could be due to all the relaxing I was doing.  Since I am starting to go back to work, I may come back and do an update review if I decide to give it 5 stars.  The bracelet itself, on looks, deserves my 4-star rating.  A word of advice on using the link removal tool; watch the Youtube video first and then do it slowly, take your time, and be patient.  I had no problem with pins bending and I that's what I did.<br /><br />UPDATE 5-13-15:<br />I've had this bracelet for quite a while.  It does scuff up and will begin to show scratches.  I've used polishing cream and a cloth which helps a little, but mainly that just helps it shine more. I have added a picture the shows the scuffing and also tries to capture the beauty of the bracelet, but my camera (more than likely operater error than the camera itself) just cant get it right.<br /><br />Also, let me warn you to keep this bracelet out of water.  Try to remove it before you shower or go for a swim.  And do not let it sit in puddled water.  I accidentally did so when I went swimming and it sat on a table that got splashed for a while.  It will ruin the epoxy or whatever it is that holds the magnets in bracelet.  Algae or something will start grow on the magnets after they tarnish.  I have added a picture to show the tarnished magnet and the algae growing magnets marked with a 1 and 2 respectfully.<br /><br />I kind of wanted to downgrade my star rating to 3-stars, but the bracelet still looks pretty good and I am more so responsible for the ugly magnets than the bracelet is.  I do feel as though a better quality method should have been used to seal the magnets.  I paid $50 when I purchased it.  It is now $55.  Would I buy it again at this new price?  Probably."
4.0,"Good bras, fit a little smaller than I expected, so at the end of the day it can feel like it’s digging into my skin a bit. But overall comfy, great for everyday wear."
4.0,/Users/jovellelaforest/Desktop<br /><br />i fits well...
4.0,Everything is excellent excepts the size to a bit small. Make sure you purchase 1 size larger
4.0,"I thought these were white they actually came cream, they wont work for what i intended to use the for but Easter is coming."
4.0,Fast shiping .. looks like picture got medium in mens size for 8.5 mens size
4.0,Cute and comfy!  Looks great with leggings and boots.
4.0,Wish it had more color
4.0,I bought these for my granddaughter to wear with her Elsa dress. They are Very cute both shoes light up but have not tried them on yet as she has not received them yet
4.0,very comfy. not a shirt id wear out of the house however
4.0,"Love these! Only thing that surprised me was just how low the &#34;crotch&#34; of the pants fall. I'm 5'3&#34;ish and it falls below my knees, making them feel much more like a skirt. The crotch placement (for me at least) also makes it slightly odd to cross your legs. Still, I think they're pretty cool and expect I'll get a lot of use out of them."
4.0,"My lady loves it, the colors are good just kinda hard to see what it is"
4.0,"I love these boxers! The only problem I've had with them and it's every pack I've bought, they are coming apart in random places. Mostly the completely black ones with white writing. IDK why. I like them so much I've gotten 4 packs sense my first purchase. I also got these for my 13 year old son and he loves them as well. I can wear a size 32 in men pants and I ordered these in a Small. The elastic in them has help up very well also around the waist and thy."
4.0,It said they would be good for helix but they were too short.
4.0,"I like the hat, especially for the price. Most others are &#34;stuctured&#34; with the firm front that sits high and looks silly...on me at least.  I do think it is made a bit small, as I have it adjusted to nearly the end of the velcro strap and it's still a bit tight...otherwise I like it."
4.0,Best price I was able to find and items look there are good quality.
4.0,"Very cute top, super soft material. It did shrink a bit in the wash. Originally went to my hips, now several inches above. Washed in cold and hung to dry. Still wearable but not as cute as it was."
4.0,"I have a 34” waist, 43” hip I got the XL and they fit as expected. The waist rolls down about a .25” but that happens with all my leggings. The quality is very nice but I’m so sad they aren’t squat proof, I can’t find a good pair of black leggings"
4.0,The fabric is comfortable and they seem to be well made. They fit snug like a compression shirt.
4.0,"Nice soft material, but it came in a size far too big. He'll grow into it,  I'm just hoping he doesn't grow out of the game before he grows into the merch."
4.0,Fit was good. Is comfortable for exercise and jogs around the lake.
4.0,The size was more men's large not xx large. Way to small
4.0,Its absolutely beautiful on. But it didn't fit me in a large or and XL I normally wear a medium to large. The shirt didn't fit right on my chest or arms. And the pants are a bit snug. If you are a smaller person it will look fine on you. get a size up if you can. I would have gotten the 2x to see if that worked however the shipping for the 2x wont be until August the con I'm going to is in August and can't risk it not fitting.
4.0,"Just received today and they fit perfectly. I'm 5'11&#34; , wear a 35/36 inseam and weigh approximately 156 lbs. Hope that helps any of you taller women out there. They are a little thin, but overall, I'm quite happy with them."
4.0,roomy and comfy
4.0,Soft material and loose cozy fit.  Little more boxy shaped than pictured but still good to lounge around in.
4.0,"Wow, this hair piece is truly beautiful.  It is quite large and heavy as others have mentioned.  The quality seems to be good.  I actually would prefer it to be smaller for my taste.  It would be a great accent piece for an up-do style for an adult.  Unfortunately, it is not going to work for my daughter's hair.  Such a shame since it is such a striking piece.  Shipping took a good while.  I ordered another hair piece at the same time from another company overseas and it arrived 2 weeks earlier than this one did."
4.0,"Very nice color, run a little small and a little bit to thin material! But you can make it work!"
4.0,"Looks and feels similar to what I thought it would. Slightly rougher, but still comfortable. It is very oversized, though. I ordered my usual size, medium, and it fits more like an extra large. I was able to pull the draw string and make it look cute, but I probably would’ve been happier if I had order a size or 2 down. It is pretty sheer, but I don’t mind because I got it mainly for as a swimsuit cover-up for a beach trip. I think it will be perfect!"
4.0,"Quality matches price.  They're not the highest quality, but I didn't expect them to (or need them to).  They look great when dressing up for something a bit fancier such as a wedding or New Years Eve."
4.0,It's cute but the material is really thin and it does fit tight.  I will keep it because it's different but I will wear a small sweater/shawl or something over it.
4.0,Fits well....I love it!  Great price and looks expensive.
4.0,"The material (as with the shorts from same company) is much like swim trunks - great at wicking sweat away and breathing very well. Quality is what you'd expect from the price point. Once I lose some more weight, I will purchase more from them."
4.0,These are a nice solid plastic and dark lens the sparkle is a nice touch there flashy but classy
4.0,"I love sunglasses and I have every price range from these $12.99 ones up to some Christopher Cloos that are quite pricey.<br /><br />I wear my cheaper sunglasses when I want a different look, for fun, or when I am doing something where I don't want to risk messing up or losing my Cloos. For $12.99 (at time of this review), these Macjero sunglasses are well made.<br /><br />Just remember you'll often have just what you pay for, so don't expect super quality. These feel like cheap sunglasses (though they don't necessarily look that way once on!).<br /><br />Frames: Frame/ear things are all  light plastic.  What I particularly like is when everything is basically all one unit from frame to nose bridge to ear things, though of course there is the metal things holding the ear parts on. I hate glasses that have the wires with the rubber ends - ugh! They become caught in my hair, they aren't comfortable, and I don't like the look. So I'm pleased with these.<br /><br />The fit: I have a small head so a lot of sunglasses (including my Cloos) are too loose on me, but these fit snug but not uncomfortably so. I can move around, bend down, etc, and they stay put. The nose bridge doesn't sit on my nose and that's fine with me. Those these are a little large, the bottom part doesn't sit on my check area either, which I also like. The metal hinges holding the ear things are very secure and tight but I do worry over time the screws will come loose as what happens with most cheap sunglasses.<br /><br />The look: This pink is very subtle so if you want bright pink or really pink you may not like these. I like the subtle very light pink. They aren't opaque but a bit clear. The lenses are brown. When I look through them things turn that kind of brown cast but that's okay. They are a little bigger than I thought but that's fine.<br /><br />They shade my eyes well enough though in super bright sun they may be a little lacking but these are great for when I don't want things to be too dark."
4.0,"Band has held up nicely, however required a jeweler to replace with my original band and the measurements were a little too large (wide) and required some modification from the jeweler. Also because of the silicone nature of the band it has a difficult time staying in the supporting loop during exercise."
4.0,"L 014 Red<br />Great style for a wedding, kind of felt the squished at the chest<br />Red was true not cherry red but not red/orange love the polka dots and belt that was included<br />Did notice the dress was a bit see through in some lighting at least for the 014 Red did not have a lining (under skirt)<br />Got tons of compliments.<br />Flattering on most shapes didn’t think it helped me necessarily but it looked great nonetheless<br />Loooveee the pockets"
4.0,exactly what we need. hope it would cost a bit less
4.0,"I really like this dress, it is rather fancy but beware it shows all.  It is a bit thinner than I would like but with the right undergarments the dress will wear beautifully.  Definitely a seasonal dress, does not look great in the fall or winter, spring or summer only!"
4.0,soft and true to color.
4.0,It would be cuter if I were slimmer and without a huge stomach. :)
4.0,I love the dress and I like how it looks but definitely size down. And you know the little bumps you get on your clothing you get that really fast but it looks really cute and that’s reason I’m giving it a four out of five stars.
4.0,"Very nice pants, I love it. I gave it 4 stars just because I’m usually a size 6, ordered size 7 as the size goes from 5 to 7, no 6. Found out Size 7 is a bit loose and it sits way up my belly button. Will return and reorder a size 5."
4.0,Fits wonderfully and is cute. Only thing is that the white skirt is a bit see through.
4.0,"Very cute, nicely made. I bought these for my daughter’s birthday."
4.0,"The green stones surrounded by the cz really pop!  Size is about a fingernail, have lever backs, lever part thru ear is not thin or fragile.  Since I have multiple piercings, I can wear these in lower spot and they dangle a bit and really catch the eye w/movement.  When worn higher up they stay facing the front unlike some earrings w/stones that face down with the weight.  I would like better if these were cheaper, but, whatever :)"
4.0,"Really like the fairly inexpensive skirt for rehearsal.  Lightweight.  I wear light tights under, as material is thinish.  Moves well, hangs well.  Sometimes the bottom ruffle gets caught on my shoe while dancing, so length could be a hair shorter.  Comfortable."
4.0,Fits like I expected and gives me good arch support.
4.0,The quality of the beads are really nice considering the price. I took off the star because the back of the earring is poorly made. The earring back seem like they could easily fall apart from the earring itself. But they are super cute and lightweight and for the price I’ll take it!
4.0,The print is very cute and daughter likes.  Shirt almost looks like a sleep shirt with it being a little shorter and the collar is wider.  But is is very cute.
4.0,Hold enough so I don’t take everything I don’t need.
4.0,"Though the listing calls this a “sweatshirt”, it’s really a long-sleeve tee-shirt. It’s thin, like a tee-shirt.  It’s very colorful.  The colors are nice and bold / bright.  This shirt is “tagless”.  It’s made of 95% cotton and 5% spandex.  There is a lot of stretch to this shirt all over.  The fabric is fairly soft both inside and out.  As long as you’re not expecting a thick heavy sweatshirt, then this is nice.  It’s Made in Malaysia, so at the current price of eighteen bucks, it’s quite expensive."
4.0,"I bought a pair of these shoes a little over a year ago. Their claim was they are help bunions, which they do not. But these shoes have so much cushion that they are great...I have not found any other shoe to compare and i am now buying a 2nd pair. But there is a tradeoff.....they don't last that long for the price you pay. The mesh is all torn and the inside is coming apart, seams are ripping. But obviously they are worth it because I am buying them again. My kids make fun of them because they say they look like moon shoes.... but I don't care because my feet love them.  So if you are looking for a pair of super cushioned shoes, I would recommend them.  Can't say if they help with heel pain as that is not an issue for me."
4.0,Love the style but it’s too small
4.0,"It’s longer then expected and my daughter is tall,"
4.0,"This is actually a good fun wig. The hairs are just right and 'float' in the air as you Rock Out!<br />Got great results from this, as I am bald, so when i showed up with this... XD<br /><br />and then I start rocking my head around!  XD"
4.0,"One fit perfectly and the other one was quite large, making it look like a parachute around my neck."
4.0,"IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT, COMFORTABLE TO WEAR ALL NIGHT LONG BUT IF YOU HAVE WIDE FEET OR THICK LEGS, WOULD BE WISELY TO CHOOSE ONE BIGGER SIZE."
4.0,They fit as expected and work great.
4.0,Only a little hard to pull up yet the size was correct
4.0,Very small kinda cheap feeling
4.0,Love these. The adjustable part of the string kept sliding open so I put a tiny dab of glue to keep it in place. I can’t take it off now but I like that. The silver on the Buddha head wears off eventually but ends up a nice patinaed copper color. A nice reminder to stay in the moment.
4.0,Comfortable but fits on the large side
4.0,My daughter is happy with the purchase of this cloak.
4.0,"Dainty, pretty bracelet. Purchased for my daughter. She loves it!"
4.0,"comfy, thin material. what you pay for is what you get and it worked perfectly!"
4.0,"I got these for myself and they fit perfectly. (I am 5'2"", 120 lbs,) They look nice and are well-made. I wouldn't call these compression tights but they keep everything in place during a workout. Very happy with these and recommend for both a girl and possibly a petite woman looking for good, stylish workout tights."
4.0,"I love them.  My daughters loved them but they are too small.  I'm afraid the size 13 replacement I ordered will fit but I am gambling on it because the 12 was too, too small.  I loved them so much that I am willing to take the risk.  I'll keep you posted."
4.0,"I like this as it's so hard to find more form fitting clothes now with this ugly baggy fashion the last decade or so.  But, it does run a bit large for me around the neckline sadly.  I think the sizes just run a bit larger.  The colour is great, and the fabric is decent and not too thin."
4.0,Awesome dress! Super comfortable with pockets which is my favorite. Fits as expected. Feel like I can use for both a work day with a sweater and for a summer fun day. Highly recommend.
4.0,"Where can you buy a suit for $20 these days? I am a few months post partum and I have been on the hunt for a cute suit that I can feel confident in. I was skeptical to buy a suit online and for this price. I read through the reviews and decided to take a chance. The suit is cute! The quality is as good as a regular department store. I did find the bottoms to be a bit snug, but perhaps this was due to me undersizing my new body. I look forward to wearing this at the beach soon!"
4.0,Cute but don't expect them to hold up against heavy wear. The materiel bends warps if you're not careful when handling.
4.0,"I am not sure impressed with this product but it is well worth the $, I don't see a very long life span for it but I really like how it looks and fits. Just seems a bit cheap but it was very inexpensive so seems a reasonable quality for that. I like it, just don't think it will last too long"
4.0,It fit nice & was delivered really fast
4.0,"Very colorful and fun bracelet.  Although mine broke after not too much wear, I really liked it before it broke."
4.0,They are pretty but not anti fog
4.0,"Pros:<br /><br />1) Wood grain siding looks well-crafted<br /><br />2) Sunglasses hold up to mild-stress test (mild force applied to hinges, and mild force applied in attempt to bend frame -- no reaction)<br /><br />3) Lenses are polarized in way which contrast can still be seen in dark environments<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) Worried about durability, afraid to put more than mild force on hinges<br /><br />2) Plastic-y sound when placed on counter-top (strictly personal preference)<br /><br />These lenses are by far the best I have seen in a budget brand of sunglass. Although summer has come, I live in a complex with a large covered parking garage. I don't do too well with the sudden change between darkness to bright light that happens when I drive out of the parking garage, so I usually put my sunglasses on before I drive out.  I have no problems driving in dark areas with these sunglasses. Clarity is still high, and no distortion occurs in the lenses.<br /><br />My only question about these sunglasses is their durability. While my present pair is still holding up, and has suffered no damage so far, I worry about dropping them from a high countertop, or other tall surface. Additionally, while the plastic-y sound of being placed on a countertop doesn't bother me too much, it definitely reinforces my fear of dropping this product.<br /><br />Overall I recommend these shades for any who is looking for a pair of quality shades at a low price, and plans on treating them a little gently."
4.0,"slightly larger than the previous insert, but still fits"
4.0,"Overall it was good, but the box was a little dirty in the front."
4.0,The color combinations were not the best but the bracelets are pretty and I know my granddaughter will love them. I saw very similar bracelets at the Hallmark store yesterday for $12 each. Those might be a little better quality but I know she would rather have a bunch to mix and match so I just ordered another set. I should also mention that I ordered these on Friday and they arrived on Monday!
4.0,These ear cuffs are very nice and unique as being made in Niobium.  I really like these ear cuffs.  They wear very nicely.
4.0,"I bought these as a gift for a family member and he absolutely adored them. The fit was perfect and the design, although small on a size 0, was still visible."
4.0,This band is well-made and looks very good. No complaints.
4.0,"The product is great, but I need a larger size."
4.0,This dress is so pretty. I'm not sure it is a great cut for large busted ladies. I am a 36D and I just couldn't make the top sit nice no matter how hard I tried. The quality was good and the cut/shape was exactly what I was looking for it just didn't lay nicely on the top. If you aren't in the D cup range I highly recommend this dress!
4.0,Love everything about this dress but it is longer than I expected (falls at/a little below my knees) and I'm planning on taking it somewhere to have it shortened a bit.
4.0,The hubby selected this plate carrier for the rows of webbing for add-on's. He wanted to customize the magazine holders...depending on what he was carrying that particular day - easy swapping.<br /><br />He did replace the foam insets with PE plates. The light-weight PE plates allows him to go all-day without too much discomfort.
4.0,"Cute shirt. It was a gift for my husband, and he was very amused by it. It's a nice quality shirt and the graphic is good. It does seem a bit large, but it may shrink when it's washed."
4.0,"These are beautiful and unique, love them! Just kind of sad because one of them is kinda wrinkled from shipping :(<br /><br />Con: my earrings came with absolutely NO backings!!!! What!? Make sure you have some extras lying around"
4.0,Cute shoe but runs smaller then your normal size.
4.0,But SUPER DUPER cute. Still love it. My daughter was very excited that I ordered the Hello Kitty charm to represent her on my bracelet. ;)
4.0,I ordered a small but would have sized down.
4.0,Present for my mom. She loves it. Comfortable.
4.0,I work as a nurse so I wanted a silicone ring. The other one I had was a bit to bulky/ thick for my finger. This is perfect. It's the perfect width! I wear a 5.75 and I sized up to a 6 and it feels just fine. My only reason for giving it only 4 stars is because the quality wasn't as good as my original silicone band and my daughter told me it looks like one of her loom bands!
4.0,Looks good and has the right amount of shade
4.0,"Dress is beautiful, I ordered a medium and fits like a large. This is my 2nd dress, I returned the first one. Gave 2nd one away as gift to someone who can fit it."
4.0,The length on this nightshirt is perfect...just a little longer than others I’ve tried.
4.0,Nice Shirt But Short Sleeve Space Is Too Wide.<br />Its Worth the Purchase. I Make It Look Great.
4.0,"The first one broke, but they replaced it quickly and I’ve been wearing it for a few weeks. It’s comfortable and nice looking."
4.0,Sewn edges great. Couple are disfigured but would order again.
4.0,Beautiful rich colors but can snag easily if not carefully handled....pretty style!
4.0,"I've never been a fan of big glasses but I wanted to try something new.  I felt in live with how much they cover and I also like how they sit on my face!  Very comfortable I forget I have them on. GREAT FOR THE PRICE!  OH, when I received them one of the lens was out but I managed to pop it back in place, hence the 4 stars"
4.0,"They could have made this better.<br /><br />The romper was put together as 4 pieces of fabric sewn  and there is a line of stitches right in the front which is well, I'll say it like it is: UGLY.<br /><br />They could have done 2 pieces, or even 3.  The attempt at making it off the shoulder is awkward because one sleeve is much shorter than the other and if you're not placing it off your shoulder exactly right all the time, it looks lopsided.<br /><br />For me personally this is a 3.3 but overall to be fair because the fabric is very nice and the color exactly as pictured.  I am willing to give it a 3.9 once expectations are set.  My expectations were that this would be better made.  Now you know what to expect so for what it is... it's not horrible."
4.0,Nice bag but it was a little too big for me.
4.0,"I’m happy with the band, confortable and right size. Can’t comment on durability since I got it yesterday."
4.0,They’re soft and comfortable but not tight enough to be considered compression.
4.0,I’ll give 4 stars since their was a minor qc problem. But looks great and strong. Use it one already and fits great as a carry on bag.
4.0,"Great gloves. I've noticed that I get cuts on my pinky fingers, maybe blisters? I generally try to use punch with the right knuckles so it may be because my hands are a bit wider.<br /><br />Not terrible, just something to contemplate."
4.0,Really cute and great color except the waist is several inches above my natural waste.  I decided to keep in in the hope that by losing 10 lbs it will work.  I'm just over 5.4 and 167 lbs
4.0,"These are soft and comfy. No weird smell. I bought them for$20 so the price was good even though they are 60/40 cotton and modal, not the 90% cotton listed. Another reviewer said these can pass as dress pants. They definitely can not. The line down the middle is twisted and bumpy. They shrunk quite a bit after being washed and dried. I’m 5’5” and 120 pounds and the xs fit before washing but I had to stretch out the elastic waist after. The length is still ok. I should have sized up to small."
4.0,"I recently decided to better my body and wanted to start exercising to help combat some of the negative body image I have about myself. The last time I had a sports bra was in high school (I'm a junior in college as of writing this) and I loved that sports bra. Sadly, I had to dispose of it because I had worn it out completely, so I didn't have a sports bra when I decided to start working out.<br />I decided on ordering this one because of the reviews and because of the price (again, college student) and I like it so far.<br />I got a little tangled in the straps as I put it on, but it fits well and doesn't restrict my ribs but keeps my breasts in check. There's a little bounce when I hop up and down, but not a lot. The fabric is soft and it is something I could wear for an entire day.<br />There was a slight smell when it came out of the bag, but I expect it'll go away in the wash."
4.0,"My mother-in-law will be wearing this to our wedding. It's a beautiful burgundy color and the fit is very flattering on her. It's excellent quality for the price - especially compared to other dresses from Amazon. She did purchase a bit of extra fabric that matches the color to line the back since the lace is see through where her bra will be, but even that was a less than $5 fix. Pay attention to the size chart because she had to order a crazy large size compared to normal street size, but it matched the measurements they gave when it arrived."
4.0,My kids liked wearing these for school. They were comfortable for them and fit both my 5 and 7 year olds faces. The stitching did start coming out after multiple washes but overall they held up pretty well for the cost.
4.0,Sizing works well. Shipping took a while. I would wash this on a delicate cycle and the same with the dryer to keep its some feel
4.0,"My 3yr old granddaughter could hardly wait to wear them, however the back heel strep was very loose and didn’t hug her heel for a nice fit.  There was no way to tighten it due to the way the sandal was made😩.  So they are a poor fit.  She cried because she couldn’t wear them. Too bad they are cute sandals."
4.0,"Very cute swimsuit. However, the button on the top was very loose."
4.0,"Read carefully if this is what you are looking for, as its a specialty item in that its a carabiner that is made of Titanium and thus may be more special and the price will reflect this. The small one is I think VERY SMALL. The larger one is more fitting for a key chain if you have more than a couple things to put on there. When you order, you are ordering only one and you must choose the size.  The Titanium makes them apparently higher quality in that they won't break or break down.  I like it just fine and use it to hang some keys."
4.0,Love the detail on this. The cord isn’t very high quality; it’ll start to fray within a few weeks.
4.0,Just what my daughter wanted to be VSCO
4.0,Runs a little wide but are comfy.  Flat with no arch support.
4.0,"I am just under 5’6”. 124 lbs.  32dd. Usually wear size 2-4 or small. I ordered a medium which seems to fit perfectly.  It’s a wrap dress and the overlap is not extensive in the front so be careful when you sit if you don’t wear leggings or pants with it, the edges may splay a little.  The fabric is a little light weight but it drapes beautifully.  Might be wearing this for family pics...  :)"
4.0,"Maybe I made a mistake and bought it too small.  I was 116 pounds. I tried the small size, but the waist was too tight.  I don't like returns, I hope I can lose weight.  But the style is still very fashionable, I like it very much."
4.0,Fun necklace. Cute.
4.0,They’re comfortable going on hardwood floors so you don’t slip that’s the main reason I bought them they are warm and comfortable
4.0,Bought these shoes in a size 12 for my son who wears 11.5-12 size shoe. They were way too tight. He even said his toes hurt after just tying them on. I measured them up next to his current size 12 shoe and these were notably smaller. I am gonna try a 12.5 because the shoe is adorable and looks well made. I will update my review upon testing longevity (if the new size fits!)
4.0,This was a hilarious gift. We got this for my dad who is not interested in gag gifts like this! We had a fun laugh when he put it on but he refused to wear it out of the house so we had to send it back :(
4.0,This n95 face mask came in package with all the parts. NO Intructions of how to put together.  They should be put together ready to wear.  Next time I buy the mask I will swich brands
4.0,"I ordered this dress for a summer wedding. I didn't see any pictures of the black dress with roses and a side slit but that's the simplest one without too many designs all over.<br /><br />Material: it's a very nice material, something comparable to something you'd buy at forever 21 which I'm not disappointed with because of the price. The black dress is not see through and it feels durable.the front halter part is double layered.<br /><br />Design: the flowers aren't embroidered instead it's like a patch that's swen onto the front.<br /><br />Fit: I'm usually a medium and a size 6 and 34c, I'm 145lb and 5'4&#34;.... I ordered a large based on the reviews and it fits well bit the side straps that go up the back to link with the halter are a bit loose, I could have ordered a medium by the looks of it but this will be fine. The front halter part is a bit narrow for my liking which is why I docked off a star. The left side seems to be a bit swen weird which makes it look &#34;loose&#34; and rippled as you can see in my picture. It does show alot of your chest and maybe 1/4 of my side boob... Borderline uncomfortable for a wedding but I think if I wear pasties I'll worry less like. The slit is perfect and you can see it over laps with the under layer so it gives you some coverage down there.<br /><br />Overall I really like this dress and think it's super cute! I would say purchase via prime so if you don't like it or it doesn't fit well you can return it. I'm happy with my purchase and i may get another color! :)"
4.0,"Great quality, rich colour"
4.0,"Coolest hat I've ever seen! Eyes are embroidered. Teeth printed on bith sides of bill. Just total awesomeness! Gonna order a 2nd in case anything happens to this one. If you're a fan of Venom, you should already have this hat.<br /><br />Taking 1 star off for cheap, CHEAP, plastic trucker style fastener in the back. Should have been Velcro cloth strap! I guess this is what it means by snap back."
4.0,"This costume accessory was exactly what we had hoped for.  It was adorable and perfect for what we needed it for, which was to complete my 3 year olds kitten Halloween costume!"
4.0,This product is as advertised.  I have found it useful for reducing eye strain in my lengthy use of a computer.
4.0,"Updated Review: A week or so after I posted the original review I was contacted by the company and offered either a full return/refund or to keep the robe and get an additional 10 dollars. I added another 2 stars for customer service.<br />Original Review: I'm 5'3"" and 180 lbs. I thought getting a large would be big enough. It's not. The large barely covers my double E chest.  Other than running SUPER small, the robe is great quality and color. Pictures attached are to give representation of body type. I'm not skinny by any means but I should definitely fit into a large."
4.0,Very comfy and easy to wear.  I bought a size up and it fits well.
4.0,The piece was beautiful and cute. I reciieved a lot of compliments. However the stone came off in two days .
4.0,"I bought this solely for the clasp, however it was still disappointing that I couldn't replace the whole band - the connectors on the ends just did not fit my watch."
4.0,"The bird print fabric received tons of compliments.  The dress is definitely body con but the whimsicalness of the print balances that so it worked, even in my conservative corporate office. I wore it also for a graduation ceremony,  both times with flats. It has enough stretch to be comfortable but if you are a bustier gal you may find the girls are showing more than would be appropriate for certain settings. Those of us who are smaller (32-34A/24/36; 108lbs., 5'4&#34;) can appreciate the draping at the top which adds volume without being too exposing. Some cons: I do wish it had a zipper though -- it has to be pulled on over the head, which means for some wiggling. Don't do your hair or makeup or put on deodorant until after you pull this on. Also, the bird print is great but the fabric tends to crease during the day; however, because the top was already drapey/folded, it actually ended up looking almost like it was pleated,  as if it was supposed to be that way. It wrinkles after washing and must be line-dried so prepare to iron if you want it perfectly pressed. However, the bird print kind of hides the wrinkles-- it gives it texture without looking too &#34;crumpled&#34; so you could probably get away without ironing if that didn't bother you."
4.0,I live in the PNW (did you know it’s rainy here?) :) I love these flats for days I don’t want to commit to wearing boots but don’t want to potentially ruin a fabric or leather flat if it rains while I’m out. Flipside of the material is that your foot gets soaked inside and needs some TLC once indoors. But a great shoe in rotation & I get a ton of compliments (bought the yellow)!
4.0,I purchased a large...I weigh 168 perfect fit
4.0,Nice hat. Just like the picture.
4.0,I bought these slippers for my husband.  They are a little larger than the actual size but he loves them.
4.0,"Product performed well,The wire cable is strong and secure. The tag is durable."
4.0,Very Cute! Pants were very thin and were capris not full length but still very cute!
4.0,The shirts are really cute but they are a little small. Order a size bigger.
4.0,"Very cute & comfortable. I am a true 2X and the top runs a little small but was ok. Do not put in dryer, even on low if you do not want it to shrink. I would buy another set and would purchase from this buyer again."
4.0,I'm 6'ft 240 lbs and it's a bit loose. I bought a XX Large
4.0,Love these belts. They are colorful and fit me well. I have a 33 inch waist.
4.0,"Very good quality, smart look"
4.0,"I haven't worn them out hiking yet but just trying them on i like they way they fit i am 5'4&#34; and they are a bit long but with boots on or shoes they will not drag. The pants are a mid-rise so if you wear them a bit low there is a little extra space in the crotch for squatting and bending. the knees are extra reinforced for kneeling. They are light weight but they do not breathe because they are waterproof, so the few minutes i had them on walking around the house i did get a bit sticky. So far i give them a 4 out of 5 stars because i am impressed with the fit and the construction of the pants."
4.0,"I bought these mainly for the large size - my old bandanas are 20 inches square and are really too small to fold in a triangle and wrap around my head and tie in the back. I've been wearing bandanas for years - whenever I work outside or go to the gym. These bandanas are only printed on one side - but that is not an issue with me because I fold them in half (in a triangle) anyway. They are also on the thin side - but again, that is not an issue. I love the large size, and the colors are very vibrant - even after washing them. I paid $10.79 for three - so I feel that I got a very good deal - good quality for the money. Buy them without reservation!<br />***Update (2/27/17): Well, the colors started fading after a few months, and now - after 8 months - the colors are almost gone, but the bandanas are still usable. Overall, they held up pretty well, so I'm going to order more."
4.0,"I thought they would be a bit thicker but overall, they're good quality and fit nicely.  Love the pockets as it's difficult to find sweat pants with any pockets at all much less the amount of pockets these have,  I'll definitely buy another pair.<br /><br />I wouldn't count on these keeping you overly warm during the winter as the material is much too thin for that but they're definitely nice lounge around the house/make a quick run to the store kinda pants."
4.0,"This set is very soft, and while lightweight, feels very warm. I have large hands, so the gloves are a little more snug than I prefer, but not too small that they don't fit. I did not get that itchy feeling from the hat, which i get when I wear wool. The hat was a good size, and did not crush my hair against my head. All together, this was a really nice set."
4.0,"Runs a tad small, but really cute.<br />Will not return, but will size up next time.<br />I normally run S/4/C/D.... 5'4"" 115# (bust/muffin top... slim person would be perfect)<br />Design is SUPER flattering."
4.0,Was very festive for Christmas. Really like it.
4.0,Good quality.  Worked well for my costume as long as I wear a wig.
4.0,"It looks good, but it doesn’t stay up well. We tried everything but it kept falling over."
4.0,"So soft, great vibrant color! Got a 2xl, could be a little longer but other than that it's a cute shirt."
4.0,"Even though these are a bit big, they are so incredibly soft and a great material as well as fun design."
4.0,"Pretty durable, no coverage for screen though."
4.0,"I like this time piece. I got it for my birthday and am very pleased with the watch. Only negative, the metal is thinner now than in the past, but then my other pocket watch is over 30 years old."
4.0,This is heavier than the Hanes sweatshirt. It is double the weight. Decent price at twenty five. Unfortunately this price is only for the navy blue. I would not buy this if higher than 25. Warmer than the Hanes sweatshirt as expected.
4.0,"With the exception of the blue strap,  I'm happy with the watch. After 7 days of tracking the time against a quartz timex, it was only fast by 26 seconds.<br />I wound it, fully, every 36 hours.<br /><br />I really overpaid on Amazon, by 60 dollars, as compared to the Sugess website. But, because it is keeping such good time I have decided to keep it instead of possibly getting one that is not set as well, for accuracy.<br />UPDATE, the chronograph can not be turned off. Quality control seems to be an issue. Its still keeping good time, fast by about 2 minutes in 2 weeks.<br />I would have returned the watch, but I love the sodalite dial and the cool Oriental font."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:afeb28b59b2c5bba582347259c84c486]]
4.0,"Nice looking, light jacket"
4.0,Not bad for the price. The only thing I will say is the sleeves are a little tight around my arms. Other than that I like it
4.0,"Love the ring!!  It fits and is just a nice as the picture shown.  My only complaint is I thought the ""stone"" would be bigger."
4.0,"Love this one. Good quality, fits great. Only downside is that the silver is wearing off. But I don't take this off, I wear in the shower too. Might last longer I'd taken care of better."
4.0,Feel and looks Great
4.0,Kinda tight around the shoulders but this was so sexy on me turning heads
4.0,This color is not what I thought it was but I like it anyway and it is warm and comfortable
4.0,quite comfortable and I feel that I looked good in it boosting my own confidence before even wearing it outside.my husband and children say but I don't even look like a mom in this swimsuit. I receive this product at a discount for an honest review
4.0,very pretty as shown in the website
4.0,Great quality but runs a little small.
4.0,"Got these for my child last year and they lasted all throughout the hotter months. He outgrew them but I definitely recommend them. They’re great for beach wear, hiking, running around, amusement parks."
4.0,Great belt like the way it ratchets open. Just would like a little more length.
4.0,This ring has the blue stone and little clear rhinestones.  It is really cute for the price.
4.0,In a situation with rain and wind the water will still get inside through the spaces between the buttons
4.0,"Very pretty, nice sparkle<br />Fits as expected a little tight around ankles but pretty comfortable"
4.0,Quality wise product is fine but handle is not strong which is issue with all Carry on. I like this product as it has Lock which i see only in costly models. This looks stylish too while handling inside and out. Worth to Buy this product within this price instead of spending more than $60 on other models specially which dont have locks for a safety.
4.0,"This band was very easy to remove links from with the tool provided.  However, the pins that hold the band to the watch constantly poke my wrist.  Otherwise, the band is great."
4.0,"I got the white in XL (based on the size chart for waist/hip size) to wear under a particularly short Halloween costume. I usually wear 12/14 in shorts, and these felt tight around my thighs, though they fit pretty good everywhere else. I am not athletic, probably average. They are also pretty see through. Since I am going to be wearing them under a skirt, most likely at night, this didn't bug me, but I would not wear them (especially the white!) for yoga or even out of the house. Maybe the dark colors are better. They are good for what I'm going to use them for though, material feels nice, and shipping was fast."
4.0,Great warm sweatshirt
4.0,"cute, wish earrings were a little larger"
4.0,"I really love this suit, however, the bottoms are extremely small. I am keeping, just wearing w different bottoms. I normally wear size<br />10, and L fit perfect. Colors are great, and very well made."
4.0,This product is true to size and so cute! The glittery material of the big sun came with smudges in it but I ultimately decided to keep it.
4.0,"Not bad, just a little snug"
4.0,"The seam on the toe is a bit more pronounced than I would like.  I must make sure the sock is properly positioned before putting on my boots.  Otherwise very soft and, overall, not too bulky."
4.0,"These face bandannas fit nicely on various sizes of heads. My husband and I can both wear them comfortably. I am not sure how effective they are in preventing the spread of sickness being that they are so thin. However, this lightweight material is very breathable and doesn't feel as thick or hot as wearing other forms of masks."
4.0,"Fits nicely. I like the color as well. The zipper on the side is nice, too."
4.0,"Nice, soft comfortable material. Runs a little small, I ordered a size up to be on the safe side and it fits perfectly."
4.0,Not too durable
4.0,Decent all around watch for the price.
4.0,"This blouse is a bit small. It is tight in the pits and around the girls. However, the design and color are so great I just had to keep it. I would definitely order one size up. Also, this is not a long blouse, but a shorter one. I would say it its the top of my pants in the front and just a little bit longer in the back."
4.0,"The chain seems a little flimsy so time will tell how it holds up, but it was a great purchase for the price and a nice design."
4.0,These are NOT for heavy days.  I bled right through these the second day I had them while out on a hike.  They work well for spotting days or in addition to using a menstrual cup.
4.0,But cute tops
4.0,Very comfortable just like all the other airmax!!
4.0,"I love the fit of this skirt. Many reviews say it’s baggy or too big but I personally am trying to hide a belly so this was perfect for me. I’m not a huge fan of the fact that the back is longer than the front (not into the high/low look) but it’s not too noticeable. Be careful with the placement of the holes/distressing and the panties you wear. Overall, great purchase for me."
4.0,Bought as a gift and she wears it almost daily so no problems so far.
4.0,"The hood seemed stretched and the sweater was a little large. I weigh 111 for reference, but that's about the only negative... I did wash in warm water and dried it to try to shrink it a bit and I feel like that helped a little.. very nice thick cozy fabric."
4.0,"Although it doesn’t have a retractable reel for swiping my badge, it was the closest fit I found to serve the purposes I need. The positives are that it has a small metal lobster-claw claspe to attach and detach a keychain I need at work, and the ability to adjust its length around my neck. Finding a lanyard that had all 3 features proved impossible. The fabric is soft, sturdy and plainly tasteful as well."
4.0,Very nice necklace and earrings set!
4.0,It is ok but sound could be better.  Neat Christmas gift for my snowboarding kids.
4.0,"Really good suit. I think it's a little long, but I'm satisfied."
4.0,I bought this bag as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He (and his dad) love it! It did have a slight smell when it came out of the packaging but he says that it's natural and he likes it. It's not near as bad as the other reviews made it sound. The only time I had a problem with it was when we were sitting in a hot car waiting for him to get done with a phone call. He put a stain on the leather and it looks really nice! The buckles are a little hard to get undone but that means nothing will come flying out if he's riding his bike across campus. Great bag at a good price.
4.0,"fit great!. after sitting in the closet, glue came undone on one side."
4.0,"I purchased this several months ago and left it in the package to use at a later date. I just opened it this week, used it for a day , and I’m already done with it. This is one of my favorite brands of purses , as they hold up well, very sturdy, and last a long time. This one seemed to be made cheaper, or looked like it was. The short handles ( which are the ones I always use) , feet like they were made of a cheaper material than the purse. It also really STINKS .  The odor probably would have dissipated after using it for awhile, but I won’t be using it again. It’s too small. I like smaller sized purses because I don’t carry a lot around, but this was so small, width- wise, I had to buy a small wallet to fit. It also has the divided compartments inside, which seemed to make space even less. I always bring my Kindle with me ,but not in this purse. It doesn’t fit. I have 2 other purses made in a different style by this company which get 5 🌟easily. This one was just not as good in my opinion."
4.0,Well made. Not much bigger than a thumbnail. Colors are bright and dealer's choice.
4.0,Not sure why this isn't advertised as unisex.  I wear these with my Toms shoes and they work great.  A little large for me at Size 8 feet.  Front fits but some room in back that gets bunched up.  Soft and doesn't irritate my skin.  The different colors are helpful in matching with my different shoe colors.  Comes up far enough so it doesn't slip around.  Works.  Wish it was a little smaller in back but it is Mens shoe sizes.  I got this free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.  GOOD
4.0,"They work just fine, but sometimes they are a bit hard to remove which is a problem if you have a medication on them that you don't want on your own skin.  However, you can always wash your hands afterward."
4.0,"These are nice. They are sufficient PJs. The fleece lining is just a super thin brushed layer on the inside, so don’t expect warm thick fleece fabric."
4.0,"Great dress, just ran big. Very disappointed it didn’t fit!"
4.0,"Fabric feels nice, light and soft. Thought it would be longer, but the color is nice."
4.0,"To short , great sock but not any height"
4.0,"Very comfortable, very soft. Thought it would be a little warmer but I really like it anyway. It's 4 stars only b/c I thought it'd would be warmer. All else would be 5 stars."
4.0,The seam on the back is right above my rear so it doesn’t make it that flattering. More of a cotton/ lounge material rather than workout.
4.0,"cute and comfortable, I like the little ruffle"
4.0,As advertised. Nice leather bracelet. Have gotten many compliments on the bracelet and asked where I got it. Would recommend this bracelet to anyone looking for a leather bracelet that's great for casual dress.
4.0,"THIS WAS NOT A GIFT, JUST SOMETHING I HAD ON HAND AND DECIDED TO GIVE TO A YOUNG FEMALE FROM A FAMILY THAT DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES, IT WAS FUN MAKING HER AND HER MOM HAPPY:-)"
4.0,Fun for work zoom meetings.  Only complaint is that they slide a little down my nose.
4.0,I took the little tie thing off but other than that it's cute
4.0,"Very stretchy material! I would have gotten a size large but there were none left. One size down because I like my dresses a little tighter. But, very cute and comfortable!"
4.0,"Good quality. Very cool in heat. Not scratchy. Does not shrink much in wash. Use a measuring tape and the size guide, these are not American sizes. I wear a 12/L in US sizes purchased an XL in these pants and they are snug. If you want drapey loose size up."
4.0,My son liked it and it fit perfect.
4.0,"they are great for just hacking around.  not sports shoes, just lazy shoes."
4.0,"Cute hat.  Was part of an adult birthday gift for someone who never got her ears when she was a little girl.  Only negative, the ears don't stand up, they lay back... :o(  but it's still a cute hat...."
4.0,I LOVE these bracelets! I have now owned 3. I wear them every day. Until 2 out of the 3 have broke. They DO tarnish. Your wrist will turn green BUT they look waaaay better tarnished. I just wish they didn't break in less than a year.
4.0,"Great style and shirt, not fond of material"
4.0,Very pleased with the quality of this shirt for the price.  Graphic has nice dark ink that I suspect will be slow to fade.  Quality fabric.  Fits true to size with a slight flare on the bottom.  As mentioned by a few others it does need a tank underneath as most white shirts do.  Wore it to a Beatles tribute band concert over the weekend and got lots of compliments.  Definitely recommend.
4.0,"You can't beat these for a good, well-made pair of workout shorts at a decent price.  They fall to what I'd consider a ""vanilla"" length; not so long as to come below the knee or be too baggy, and not short enough to be considered retro short-shorts.<br /><br />The pockets are narrow, but they're relatively deep, and you can easily fit your keys, a minimalist wallet, or a regular-sized phone in them and the zippers will make sure that everything stays in place."
4.0,"I like the light weight of this product.  Some stay up real well, some do not.  They are easy to breath in and not pulling on your face.  I certainly will be buying again as they are comfortable for our mask mandate.  My boyfriend also likes them.  The ones that are too big for me fit him just fine."
4.0,I love the color of this sweater. I was expecting an oversized sweater but it’s actually just really long. BUT it is a sweater dress so I can’t complain about it. I folded it under and makes a perfect sweater with jeans or I could roll it back down and wear it with leggings. Fast shipping! I got a size medium by the way. 5’3 165lbs. Kinda see through too.
4.0,"The material on this is gorgeous. I wish it were a little longer and not more like a halter top leaving a good portion of the stomach exposed. I purchased the white version of this too. I ordered a small, which fit well with my 34DDD chest."
4.0,"Color came out as more purple than blue. Plastic feels cheap, but seems to hold well."
4.0,will have to take it in the waist and hip but had to order the extra large to get chest measurements.  I am a 34DD
4.0,The necklace is beautiful but came as a super dark blue almost black. I ordered the Solidate color. That is why I gave a 4 out 5 star rating. I'm bummed it's not like the photo shown when I checked out.
4.0,I got the bag shipped very well in a box with protectant paper. It came in 3 days. Very nice service overall.
4.0,It's super cute but to small
4.0,"I am normally a size 7, so I got a size 7. They fit well, weren't difficult to pull on, and didn't smoosh my toes (I do however have narrow feet). I put them on with a pair of fuzzy socks, slightly thicker than regular socks and walked around my house...I could already feel that they were rubbing on my heel and with time, they were going to hurt. I'm hoping this is something that will diminish once they are broken in a bit, but only time will tell.<br />Knocking of 1 star as I feel these are for minimal wear, not all day use, or else you're going to (POSSIBLY) have a blistered heel."
4.0,got one for each of my daughters for Christmas. They look dainty and colorful and I'm sure they will love them.
4.0,"GREAT LOOK, STURDINESS AND GOOD QUALITY, GREAT FOR PRICE."
4.0,Size comes a little larger.
4.0,"These sunglasses are incredibly light, and extremely comfortable to wear. They are polarized, however I took one star off from a five star rating because they could have been darker. I bought these to replace some Maui Jims that I lost while commuting on the Metro one day. I was surprised to receive them directly from China so quickly. If this company can make these same exact sunglasses where they are darker to protect even better from sunny days, these would be my go to sunglasses and the only ones I would wear since they are so comfortable."
4.0,The hat fit fine. US AIR FORCE spelling is filled in with the same color thread so there is no clear separation of the letters. The US AIR FORCE words are raised up from the same colored back ground behind each letter which makes for a blur and the letters do not pop out from the cap color.<br />I would have payed a little more for this hat if the letters would have been single stitched on the black background of the hat.
4.0,"Runs small, I got xL and fits like large ."
4.0,The quality is really good but I will be returning it due to confusing & incorrect description.  I read the first line of the description.  It says &#34;square&#34; it is not square it is a rectangle.  it is not 32&#34; either. It is 31&#34; X 22&#34;.
4.0,Great purchase runs a little small definitely a sexy fit 135 ordered a size small
4.0,"The are really cute, but heavy on your ears.  My ear lobes hurt after wearing, so I cannot wear them that often.  They do not fade and are very sturdy."
4.0,Provides good coverage. It is also easy on the skin and the pattern on the fabric is stylish.
4.0,The bust was kind of small. I'm a 40 J and my bust to too tight for comfort. I'm a size 20 280lbs 5'8. I bought the 3xl
4.0,Works good. Comfortable. Doesn't make my head too hot. I do need 2 of them for an hour of racquetball so I can swap out half way through.
4.0,Light weight but thought it was going to be longer.
4.0,Caftan is one size fits all. I normally wear a size 16 and there was plenty of room in this caftan. It is very roomy and comfortable.
4.0,It will work for what I wanted.
4.0,Awesome fitting shirt. The material is very soft and comfortable. Wear it to work all day.
4.0,"I like my products, so far no problems with either the necklace or bracket, received both really fast shipping!<br />A week after I bought this it turn brown and my neck broke out, buyers be wear false advertising on this web site not I say not 925 sterling silver, don’t waste ur money!"
4.0,The shirt is nice and the quality is great.  The pink hibiscus color is a more coral color but still very pretty & bright.  The only complaint is the item runs small.  I'm returning for a larger size so please order 1 size up.
