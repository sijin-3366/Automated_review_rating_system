3.0,Def smaller than I anticipated. I'll read the fine print next time.
3.0,"I really wanted to  keep this dress -- the fit was great and really comfy and the colors were nice, but....the stripes on the front and back of the skirt portion did not line up at all. That, I probably would have let go, however, the top portion of the dress was a mess. The stripes were not straight but were slanted down which was really visible at the seam. The neckline hem was off center and uneven along with the rest of it. It just looked sloppy. I realize it's  an inexpensive dress but I don't  want to look slouchy either. I am returning it. Not sure if I want to take a chance on another striped one or not."
3.0,"While I did think this top was cute on, it is nothing like the description. it is more tight fitted and short on the torso."
3.0,"Rather attractive, but cheaply made. Worked for my purposes (a one off)-- probably wouldn't withstand multiple wears. You get what you pay for!"
3.0,If I didn't already have 3 pairs of grey boots I would have kept them.  I wanted beige.
3.0,"I loved it because is simple elegant look. Has a lot of storage space, the only thing that didnt like is you cant use it over the shoulder..."
3.0,Used very seldom as this tends to slide down from your hand/leg.<br />Elbow use seems to be a bit more practical...
3.0,"Unfortunately, this hat was much too big for my 6 5/8 sized head. The size along with the floppiness of the fabric made the hat come down over my eyes and I looked a lot like that kid in the Fat Albert cartoon as opposed to the woman in the photo. The hat itself was as pictured, I liked the material (seemed like it would dry out fast if wet) and the pattern. If you have a large head it might work for you. I re-gifted the hat to someone with a bigger noggin."
3.0,The dress was too short. It’s a nice fit when I wear shorts with it.
3.0,"Its a very good light weight jacket, i use it for my cycling.. but the size is too large. I got US S/L thinking its size S...<br />size chart and the size posted are confusing."
3.0,"I bought these pants because I needed some warmer gym pants for the Winter and these had pockets. They deliver on the warmth, considering these are still meant to be breathable active pants. The pockets are small and barely hold my phone. I'm a US16 and bought the XL, which fits perfectly around my waist and is a bit tight on the thighs to the point of limited mobility for stretching, which rarely happens with pants. These are ok pants for jogging or just wearing around, though you may want to keep an eye on your belongings in the pockets."
3.0,If your hat size is 7½ the Large/X large will fit you...
3.0,Tiny!  Tiny! Tiny! A Waste of money.
3.0,I ordered a small..couldn't even move my shoulders lol<br />Gave it to my 8 year old granddaughter<br />And I bought 2
3.0,"Pretty cheap quality, but expected that.  My daughter is 4 1/2 and has recently decided things need to be comforatable as well as pretty so she isn't really wearing these."
3.0,"It is a cute shirt, but I don’t like how fitted it is around the armpits. I prefer a looser fit"
3.0,"The fabric is thin/lightweight - it's summer so I am fine with that.  The dress pattern/design is pretty but it runs small. In order for the dress to have fit me, I would have needed to order a size larger."
3.0,"I like the fabric this headband is made of: a soft and stretchy knit that feels nice on your face.<br /><br />I like that it is reversible, so I can wear it either all gray, all pink, or half and half.<br /><br />I was surprised that the headband was not continuous. The fabric band is joined in the middle by a narrower gray-covered elastic band. This joining section would hide under your hair, so no one will see it, but I would have liked it better if it was continuous.<br /><br />The band is made of acrylic material, and is machine washable. I would not put it in the dryer if you want to preserve the elastic."
3.0,"The dress came in and it was bright red opposed to the darker red it appears in the picture. Slits in the shoulders looked a lot smaller on, was not very flattering."
3.0,"pretty shoes, looks like picture, but smaller than expected."
3.0,"I really want to love this band, but it comes undone easily. It is really good quality material, sturdy and tough.  I really like the quick release pins.  I don't know why, but I really like the butterfly opening.  The release buttons on the sides are very sensitive and will release randomly when wearing a jacket.  Sometimes it doesn't release at all and will be fine all day and other times it will release itself every few minutes."
3.0,Need to use 3 lines so they can enlarge the font.  Can't read bottom line.  Overall quality is satisfactory for the price.
3.0,"Upon reading the reviews, I expected it to stay in place but it didn't. The material is sturdy however."
3.0,"It's cute, but wasn't expecting just a tube of fabric."
3.0,"Crotch is cut kinda high, not to much room for comfort for a male"
3.0,.The Lock got stuck and I can't open it
3.0,Good looking shirt but you better have a flat gut. Not really a large. Tight in the shoulders and arms too. I gave it to my son.
3.0,Too Large for me
3.0,These were disappointing. They are cute. However the protection I am used to from a SUPER dark lenses was not there at all.  It does give sun protection but not to the level of being super dark
3.0,"It's super cute but also runs huge! I ordered a size Small and it fits so long and baggy on me, so I wear it as a night gown."
3.0,"yep, tight"
3.0,"There beak mask doesn't open & close when I talk or even when I tell (exaggerated mouth movements).<br />It's still cute, but super disappointed."
3.0,"Came ripped on the side but its so cute and I didnt want to wait , I just sewed it myself . Very pretty tho"
3.0,"I order d a size 10 in a different color they fit, but I haven't worn them yet.  This is a 1.5 size smaller than my normal sneaker size."
3.0,They hurt my ears after a couple hours and the metal starts to itch. My ears aren't very sensitive to metals but these did not feel great. They look great and for the price they are definitely a good option - maybe just for a couple hours wear rather than a full day.
3.0,Product looks great. But out of my 4 pairs of sunglasses none of them fit into it. Sad!
3.0,"In fact, possibly a mistake in shipping?  Manufacture?  Item is way too short to be necklace and too loose for a bracelet.....except for ankle or bicep.  Too Bad...…..."
3.0,"It's my fault that I didn't notice it wasn't a set, but I am sad that it was just too small for me."
3.0,"Since buying the shorts version of these leggings, I was expecting much of the same in a longer length. I like them, except for the seam in the front on these. There isn't a seam on the shorts. Unless ur skin & bones, most women have this issue. Its totally up to the person if they don't mind this, which for me is not necessarily about the way it looks, so much as it is the way it feels. I hate it. I shouldn't have to wear underwear w a pair of workout pants, especially if there's a gusseted crotch. I really don't care for longer leggings anyway, always having to pull them up when doing any jumping exercises. Of course, the more u have to pull them up, the more camel toe ur gonna have..lol..I'm sure the guys don't mind. I do!"
3.0,"Great bag, however the shoulder straps are too short."
3.0,Not true to size! Thigh underarm.
3.0,"They are ok sun glasses but too tight, I thought that so called XL sun glasses would be wider"
3.0,"They're not very comfortable and the nose piece catches my hair ALL THE TIME. They are very cute, but the plastic nose piece broke off after about 3 months. Considering they were only $13, I guess that is to be expected."
3.0,"Nice knit and very warm, they just run really small."
3.0,"So these tarnish and stain the edges of my piercing dark gray if not taken out before getting sweaty, wet, etc.<br /><br />I have slept in them, but now I only wear them for a short time here and there because of the risk of staining.<br /><br />They arrived with both posts bent, but they are sturdy enough to straighten.  Also they can be bent when putting the backs on, and the long post stud has little grooves to keep the back from sliding off.<br /><br />Also it is a little weird that both bikes face the same direction.  There isn't a left and a right, but I think they look good anyways."
3.0,The fabric an printing is just perfect but the size of the mask is definitely not for someone with a small face. For kids it is definitely a no go too huge.
3.0,It's pretty good for the price.
3.0,"Great price and good costume overall, but sizing is a little off. Hair piece is cheesy so will prob use something else"
3.0,Really pretty but much smaller and shorter them I hoped
3.0,"I'm always leery about buying pants online as sizing can be hit or miss. These pants were a miss for me.<br />The waist band while elastic does not stretch so if your hips are wider than that waist measurement (think 36 inches at most) these will not fit you. I wasnt able to pull them up my thighs, normally I'm an 8-10 so not too big.<br />However they did fit my 13yo who is 5ft 2 and 95lbs and a juniors size 2 . She loves them. The material is strange however. Kiddo says it reminds her of a halloween costume almost but it doesn't bother her. The belt is pretty flimsy, may need to reinforce the stitching later.<br /><br />So overall they aren't terrible but they wont fit most adults"
3.0,Not what I expected not a swimming suit.
3.0,"The shirt is about the quality expected for the money. Biggest disappointment was the color...not even close to the &#34;Sand&#34; color shown. My wife asked me why I would order a color like this. I explained that the color was not like what I ordered. Probably would not order the shirts again. I also ordered the chocolate brown, and the color is good."
3.0,"I like the product ,I didn't say the adult size and it  was  a sample"
3.0,Yep. It's a watch cover
3.0,It hurts to wear.
3.0,Queda pequeño
3.0,[[VIDEOID:e02cdf119c7baf18fcdea9f071e47a47]] I really like the style of these shoes. The gold trim makes them unique and the off white color would be very versatile. However all the straps were too wide for my feet. And the ankle strap has a weird clasp which I try to show in my video. Not sure how that is supposed to work but I could not make them tight enough to fit me. Have to return.
3.0,"I like the top, a little loose but I'm still gonna wear it, it's nice. The bottoms for weird and I'm not the biggest fan of them"
3.0,Cute if your a doll....
3.0,"I really loved these sunglasses, but am sad to report that they broke on the hinge out of nowhere."
3.0,"I’m 5’5, 150, the dress fit will however it was way too sheer. Had to return, if the material was thicker I would have loved to keep the dress."
3.0,"It looks gorgeous and fits well, but there is absolutely NO support whatsoever. There is no boning and the bust is all material with rigidity at all. Plus, the feathers bend and break easily."
3.0,"I thought the fit was a little tight. I loved the cowl  neck style, but that’s about it. The tie dye was primarily yellow, not the pretty tones of pink and other colors in the product photos. If i fit a little loser and was a little longer in length, I might have been able to overlook the disappointment in the color. But with those three issues, I decided to return."
3.0,"2 oppisit facing zippers make it difficult to get started zipping up, and will result in being wet in sudden rain storms."
3.0,"Often i purchase 2 packs close in time.  Those packs often have different nations of manufacture.  In the past i have been pleased with ones made in Central America.  This time i am pleased with ones made in Vietnam, but have to keep pulling out needle and thread to repair the ones made in Thailand which have so little fabric overlap at seams that they keep coming apart there.  This is not my first time encountering that, but there is no way to check beforehand where the factories existed.  If i had rated them separately, my new ones made in Vietnam would get 5 stars while my new ones made in Thailand would get one star, indicating a subcontractor which is not up to the task."
3.0,Bigger then I expected but still a nice pair to own.
3.0,Cute but Fabric is very stiff and scratchy. Afraid to wash it.  It seems shorter in actuality but i get a lot of compliments when i wear. Neck hole is wayyy small cannot button top button
3.0,Uncomfortable for me... had to return.
3.0,I like the mask but it said pack of three when I itcherpurchased it and it was only one in the pack but other than that nice mask
3.0,"I need a bag that can hold all my stuff and because it had a strap that can go across the body. I liked the fact that the bag had a lot of pockets. However, with in the first month one of the outside zippers handle broke, then the thread on the outside pocket seam started to unravel.  I still use the bag, but disappointed."
3.0,It is very small and has the manufacturer’s details on the back side.
3.0,No son resistentes
3.0,Some are not true black
3.0,Way too big but soft and pretty.<br />Had to return mine
3.0,I like it but I  got a xxlg so it would fit loose. I normaly wear a xlg. This was tight and really showed the belly for someone with a big belly. I would say it runs small and order a size larger if you want it loose fitting. Also mine has a funny line on both sides of the sweater where the seems meet. It looks like your wearing it inside out or something.
3.0,"Cute,but cut a bit small"
3.0,"I didn't take a photo because I don't like how this looks on me. I'm 5'3"" and 190 lbs, uaually wear a Large or XL, and I'm bottom heavy with average breasts (36C). With all that said, I usually expect tops to fit loose but the entire dress was just saggy on me and I'm very shapely. It was also pretty heavy. That part is good and bad. Good because I can tell it'll keep me warm. Bad because who wants to wear a heavy dress in the winter with a heavy coat? Lol! The material is nice and soft and the color ia beautiful just like the photo. I would still recommend this item. Just size down.<br />#HappyShopping"
3.0,"These WERE very nice, warm and comfy... BUT, they shrunk severely after the first wash in luke warm water and hung up to dry..."
3.0,Elastic where skirt joins the bodice is irritating. Otherwise the dress fit is perfect. Still deciding if I will keep it.
3.0,"Nice material, fits well. The lace straps in the back started to come unraveled after 1st wash."
3.0,I purchased the XL and it was SMALLLL. Had to return it sadly.
3.0,I liked the look of these but the fit was too narrow for me so I returned them. Wish they were a bit wider.
3.0,"I'm 5'9 it hits my calf. I order a medium and my waist is 27inches, it's a little tight. Returned it. It's cute but not as full or as long as in the product photo."
3.0,"I thought they looked cute and sexy on model but not on my friend because they were too tight and uncomfortable for him. Also, upon opening the package, we were a bit concerned as briefs were so small, they looked like kid underwear. We thought they would stretch upon putting them on, but they didn't. The only plus is that they were very soft. Maybe if underwear would have fitted him properly, (or better, comfortably) his experience would have been much better.<br /><br />I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,if you purchase this get one size bigger unless you have a flat chest then it will fit fine--seems tight in shoulders
3.0,She liked them a lot.
3.0,Quite a bit bigger than I thought but color was good
3.0,I was looking for something that looked a little more like real leather. These look a little more like cheap purse leather. I still use them every work day. They work fine for the price.
3.0,The clip part in the middle stands out quite a bit. I wish they would smooth that out a bit more
3.0,"Arms are narrow, good length."
3.0,"Correct size, good quality, hand washable. Turns brown quickly from outside use. Probably best for indoor or pool use."
3.0,"These boots are cute but have a terrible smell. I read the reviews and was aware of this but it was still stronger than expected. I sprinkled baking soda on the inside and sprayed the outside with acv, and let them sit for 3-4 days. The smell was definitely lighter, but unfortunately after researching, almost all rainboots have this negative. Also with these there aren't insoles/padding so you'll either need to purchase insoles or wear thick socks. I was ok with thick socks. I'm also going to replace the laces as it's more threading/decorative and it's already unraveling."
3.0,Second top I ordered from this company but fit nothing like the first. It's wider than it is long so useless for me.
3.0,A little too bulky. If they were a little smaller I'd love them.
3.0,I like the cut and material. Do fit on the large side
3.0,I like the look of these earrings but they are heavier than I expected especially with the pearl at the end. I used them couple time without the pearl but the chain itself was too thick for me and cause irritation for me. I kept them to have casually chic earrings but if you are looking for something you can use everyday would not recommend it.
3.0,Was disappointed. The sleeves were really loose and shorter than expected. The burgundy color was much redder than I wanted. Still a good product for the price just didnt meet expectations.
3.0,It can be worn on light chilly days. The size small is too big. The stitching is poorly done.
3.0,"Ok, so I use this little pack all the time, and it's great, except for the small pouches on the shoulder strap. Also, the Velcro is weak. But the main pouch is good, and it hold my small MacBook, my passport, and my lithium battery charger easily. It's great for those quick flights."
3.0,"Oh, so, soft!  These pants remind me of the old 70’s velour outfits, shiny and soft and comfortable!  The fabric is actually velvet and looks great!<br /><br />Perfect for fall weather to keep warm outside or just the right warmth for a cool evening at home!<br /><br />They are so comfortable (if correct size) due to the elastic waistband; they also have a tie cord if needed.<br /><br />Super comfy and easy to care for, just throw them in the washer and dryer and they are ready for another day!<br /><br />These pants were sized XL, which are close to size 12.<br /><br />Summary:<br />*Soft Velvet Fabric<br />*Wide Leg Pants with Side slits<br />*Elastic Waist with Tiecord Closure<br />*Machine Wash"
3.0,"I was so excited for this dress... But when I took it out of the bag, one of the straps instantly snapped. Broken. It was poorly sewed on, and like another reviewer said, its not made of a cotton blend, its more polyester... I'm not sure. But it's cheaply made. I guess you get what you pay for. But anyway, if your willing to sew it up its fine. I still kept mine because I sewed it up a lot better and it finally holds up. I only use it as a bikini cover up because the white of it is see through."
3.0,Hood is kind of short so it doesn't cover well and the memory foam pillow is kind of heavy not the best for travel.
3.0,"La tela muy hermosa, me encantó el diseño y el estilo, pero tuvo un problema en el entalle, no me queda del todo grande, el problema es que las sisas de las mangas son demasiado grandes y se siente incómodo al usarlo. Fue necesario hacerle ajustes en esa área como también en el cuello para que quede mejor el entalle y no parezca grotesco."
3.0,Got most of the earrings that was advertised  but one set is missing from both times I ordered it
3.0,"These boots are a hit or miss. I ordered a size 7 in  yellow and I received a size 9 and the color was more like beige (I loved the color) but when I wore them I felt that I was walking barefoot on the ground, I thought it was because they sent the wrong size; however they were so cute that I reordered a size 7 again same color and again I received a size 9 but this time the color was more like a khaki and they fitted and felt more comfortable on my feet despite the clop clop sound of the heel.  Every time I wear them I receive nothing but compliments."
3.0,"I love the color and the size. The complaint I have is about the zippers. They are hard to zip. I absolutely hate them. Whoever continues to produce these needs to consider the importance of why a woman needs to zip or unzip the purse without struggling, especially someone with fibromyalgia or RA."
3.0,"Somewhat small in size.  Material is not exactly soft - it feels like cheap fabric.  Colors are not quite what they appear like in the seller photo - all are much darker and the whole set is close the same darkness.  Guess it is okay for the price, but next time I will spend more money for nicer material and better fit."
3.0,"i need to order a smaller size,. i ordered a 2xl and i think i need a 1xl. the other one is way to big."
3.0,"Very pretty, but much to small. if they were enlarged to 2X the size, they would pick up more light and there be more beautiful."
3.0,Didn't keep was too large.
3.0,Item can be uncomfortable after wearing it for more than 30 minutes
3.0,"I love the shirt, unfortunately  The stitching is not very good quality at all. I had many snags before I ever even put it on."
3.0,Came quickly but elastic around shoulders was very tight the picture of the shirt makes it look like it drapes down and is loose but the elastic was very tight :( Material was light but overall size was way smaller than a normal medium I ordered two other shirts in size medium and they were fine but this one was not as expected.
3.0,Size up. Synthetic material. Red is more burnt dark orange. Did not like. Medium fit grabd daughter xs size
3.0,"They are cute but very large.  They were a gift for my sister.  Also, they took a long time to arrive given the out of country status."
3.0,"It is nice but a little smaller than I expected, the color is nice."
3.0,I ordered a large and it's too small but the quality is very nice I expected more
3.0,I got this for my 64 old mother for Christmas. I was looking for a jogging outfit that was affordable stylish and durable. Well it was the only thing about it that I didn’t like is the jacket was a crop top style of jacket. But it was cute but not cute you are great grand mother. My mother is 5 foot 170 pounds. The length of the pants was great and the color was fabulous.
3.0,The swimsuit is super cute on but I found it<br />To be a little snug on my chest area.
3.0,"It doesn’t look as good as it does in the picture in red, but otherwise a good solid keychain"
3.0,Good shorts but I had ordered two pairs to see which I liked better and these just weren’t as comfortable as the other pair I bought so I returned these. The pocket is a great though.
3.0,"My daughter is very happy with the size and look of the purse. However, it is not made well and the strap fell off within 2 weeks of using the purse."
3.0,I like the shirt but not the material. It's very stretchy and clingy.
3.0,"the fabric feels very nice and it looks good in the front, but in the profile it is very figure-unflattering, makes you look like a fat square. I were it once and donated it. For reference I am 5'7&#34;, 145 lb."
3.0,For the price i was expecting something a bit bigger.
3.0,THESE SLIPPERS ARE REALLY CUTE.  THEY ARE CUT SMALL. SIZE 9=10 IS A NEW SIZE FOR HER AND SHE COULD NOT GET HER FOOT IN THEM.  THEY HAVE NO STRETCH SO YOU WOULD WANT A SIZE LARGER.
3.0,Good but not great!
3.0,These are pretty but won't fit in a regular earring hole. Mine were gauged at one point so they fit into one of my earring holes but the other one feels like it is being stretched--uncomfortable!
3.0,Buckle was difficult to undo.
3.0,Kids love the look but they seem to fit a little wide and my kids feet are narrow.
3.0,"These are tights, not pantyhose. They are somewhat opaque but not as opaque as I needed. The color is a nice true beige which has a slight sheen to it. They are not one size fits all. For reference, I am 5'3&#34; and they just barely fit me. They would not be long enough for a taller person. They fit very snug, almost like compression garment, which does give the illusion of being slimmer but it took a lot of pulling and stretching to get them on. I am keeping them anyway but am not sure how many hours I would want to actually wear these. I need them for short-term event use so they meet my needs."
3.0,We purchased this item as part of a Halloween costume. It's a good buy for the price and will work for the costume but it looks faded /ashy as if it were dyed and the black didn't fully cover the fabric consistently.
3.0,Much smaller than it looks in the picture.<br />Very stiff and rigid.
3.0,"The chain in very pretty and sexy too.  However, like most body chains that I've tried, it broke very easily.  Just enjoy it while it lasts.  It looks good."
3.0,very unattractive fit. will wear around the house but not in public. it's just plain ugly to me.
3.0,Material is thick and you can see through even when in a squat! Only issue is you should order a size up. The material does not stretch as much as you would think! Other then that they are great workout leggings!
3.0,"The XL fit was loose on me (5'11"" tall, 155 lbs) which is OK for me.<br /><br />What I disliked was the design: there is much gathered cloth below the shoulders so that it is all puckered right above the chest on 2 slanted lines.  It looks like they purposely designed the shirt so that it was not a tailored or structured look.  But it is not flattering at all.<br /><br />The orange color is not what I expected either: it's not a nice dark burnt orange, nor a bright orange--some place blah and in between.<br /><br />I had planned to wear this on a trip to Southeast Asia in a few days, but it does not look nice enough.  I'll just wear it when doing yardwork."
3.0,"It’s a decent shoe for my husband who is on his feet all day, but the laces keep coming out and that’s because the loops pop. We also added gel cushion to them to increase the comfort."
3.0,"I put this on my utility trailer to discourage theft. But I also chain the trailer to a post with a stout chain. The wheel lock cover latch is flimsy and could be easily broken — but as I said, I think the boot provides a degree of visual deterrence. The bright yellow color has faded nearly to white after months in the sun."
3.0,"It should be noted that in the pic the gray color is much darker than it really is. In addition, the belt seems to be wider than it really is (maybe because there is no scale reference in the pic)."
3.0,"This product is honestly good for the price. The colors are great and it’s very comfortable. But, I’ve noticed after a couple weeks of use the underwire started coming off and started poking me. So now, I just use it at home. That was the only thing that bothered me."
3.0,Great cut but run big especially in waste.
3.0,"Love the colors, material is a bit scratchy while wearing it. If I reorder, I would choose 1 size up than what I usually wear."
3.0,I didn't get the waist tie in the picture
3.0,"My wife makes a big thing of jewelry and Valentines Day. Her birthday is the next day - the 15th. I bought these earrings for Valentine's Day and the matching Valentine necklace for Valentine's Day.  As I was listening to my headphones on my computer she walked up behind me, unbeknownst to me, when two Amazon &#34;RATE YOUR PURCHASES,&#34; emails showed up displaying her gifts in 200% size. She tapped me on the shoulder and said, &#34;Is that my Valentine's Day gift?&#34;<br /><br />Amazon, you screwed up. Why would you need to have your damn product rated when it could clearly be a gift and in many cases husbands and wives share emails? You Suck!"
3.0,Black marks/lines around the pandas eyes. Other than that seems pretty durable for the purpose it will serve.
3.0,My shoes came with red shoe laces.
3.0,Very nice if you're petite not for large wrist their smaller then picture would given 5 stars if they were like picture
3.0,The material was not what I expected and the colors are not as crisp as pictured. But it is a nice sized scarf.
3.0,"A little big. Wife has problems turning in bed, they seam a little binding."
3.0,The ear elastic cut into your ears pretty bad so definitely need an ear protector.
3.0,"Very cute and comfortable summer dress. However, per the title and description, I was expecting pockets. I'm rating 3 stars since the title and description of this dress are incorrect."
3.0,Some of the charms with words make absolutely no sense at all
3.0,Cute but I ordered a 13.5 and the shoes that arrived match a USyouth 2 rather than US youth size 2.
3.0,It was nice but didn't realize how big.  Also took a long time to ship.
3.0,Love silk love pink love lace but this pair fits like its to small for its size .verry comfy but snug fit
3.0,"A little too big for my taste, but I should have measured."
3.0,I bought this ring for my fiancé and I’m a size 6. His finger is a little bigger than mine so I ordered a 7. I tried the ring on and it’s tight. Order a size - size and a half bigger than normal.
3.0,"Nice watch. Very eyecatching design. It is comfortable, and weighty. The only problem is it gains 2 minuets a week, not so bad but could be better.<br />Update: watch has lost the day hand and it has gotten lodged inside of the watch mechanisms which has rendered the time piece useless."
3.0,Not flattering on me.
3.0,very tight in the thigh area
3.0,These seem flimsy.
3.0,to tight not a good fit for men
3.0,"Instruction was put into the original packing box, watch didn't find the quality problem at present."
3.0,"These feel kind of like ""old lady"" material.  Not very soft and I don't see them very comfortable for working out and not dressy enough for anything.  Sizing is ok, but capri?  They are full length."
3.0,The lenses arrived with a poor lens finish on one lens.  The left lens is fine but the right lens has very little tint in the center which is very noticeable in all light conditions.  I purchased a pair of lenses from Revant before so I am a returning customer based on that previous purchase.  I'm disappointed at the lack of consistency.
3.0,I got these so a group of adults could wear them during a performance.  A little on the small side for adults.  The elastic was long enough but some noses didn't quite fit and they were small enough I needed to breath through my mouth.  But they're still cute!
3.0,It’s just okay<br />I don’t like the buttons<br />I would prefer a zipper<br />I’m keeping it<br />It should be cuter
3.0,Great piece of lingerie but it is barely a scrap of fabric with some mesh/lace. It also has an awkward and VERY visible seam across the middle of both cups. I generally wear a cami or tank top under all of my shirts and even with the multiple layers you can see the seam very clearly. Also don't wear it if you get easily cold if you catch my drift as it hides NOTHING. That being said it is very flattering and sexy for special nights.
3.0,"Looks nice, ut I don't think it will e very durable..."
3.0,These hats are incredibly small. Very cute but smaller than an iPhone 6.
3.0,Horrible smell to them I washed them a few times the smell still lingered
3.0,"This dress feels like velveteen, and it is pretty.  I wear a 14, but read it ran tight.  Of course, it was too small across my chest (38C).  It is also shaped like a bell, so I think unless you're willowy it will not be flattering."
3.0,Cute. Note for all body types. Perfect for teens
3.0,"I guess what you would expect... looks good on the first or second wear, but after a couple washings it's not the same. Just doesn't hold up well..."
3.0,"They sizes are 1 to 2 sizes to small a XXL is a XL to large.<br />Over all the material is ok, sizing is like wearing insulated underwear."
3.0,Thought it was silver!!! But has 2 tone gold/silver. But still nice!!
3.0,"I like the look and the feel of this coat. I love that I can move around in it easily. The only thing that makes the sleeves long enough is the knit that is at the bottom.  If it weren’t there the bottom of the sleeve is about three inches above my wrist, but I have longer arms than the average bear. The fur lining is soft and warm. I’m disappointed that the directions for washing says to take the fur out before laundering. None of the fur comes off! The zipper grabs the fabric and often gets stuck. I’m on the fence about keeping it. If it weren’t so comfortable it would be on its way back to the company right now. Oh yah, it came all wrinkled and though I’ve had it out of the package and hanging for a couple of days, the wrinkles are still there."
3.0,"This outfit is perfect for the Renaissance Festival. It’s cute and fits perfectly! I only took stars off because I was sent the wrong color. I ordered bright red for the “Celtic Christmas” weekend but was given a salmon/coral pink color instead. I was pretty bummed about the color, but still wearing it!"
3.0,"Every hat, helmet, and visor I have ever worn had been a medium. this item claims to be a medium but it fit like an extra large. You might want to purchase this brand from a brick and mortar rather that Amazon in order to get a correct fit."
3.0,"I like that it is fitting, but the dress is too long for comfort. I hope I'm able to return it. I really resemble a ruffled sheet."
3.0,Didn’t fit like I hoped. It had a lot of extra fabric up top that bunched weird.
3.0,a little too small for my liking.
3.0,It OK not perfect. It was slightly damaged
3.0,Arms too small
3.0,"I thought they would be bigger, longer."
3.0,cute design but it was WAY too short in the waist.
3.0,It fit okay... but the sleeve were a bit to short for my taste.
3.0,"Very cheap, but still cute."
3.0,Sizes were a little big in comparison to the same product that I purchased in store.
3.0,The earring is nice but is very delicate to handle. Need to handle it with lot of care!!
3.0,its more polyester and it looks nice
3.0,"Some of the plastic pieces randomly break just by taking them off or putting them on so far I've had about 3 or 4 different ones just break, which can be a bother when they are part of a matching pair like the ones for the lip or eyebrow"
3.0,Love the color.  Great for the summer months.
3.0,"Pretty, and actually looks just like the pictures but runs large, sleeves end a couple inches past my hands and the dress length is just above my ankles. I think a large would of fit much better. I'm 5' 1"" and 140lbs. The material is stretchy and the sleeves don't itch which is nice."
3.0,I ordered a large based on recommendations on item.  I normally wear a medium and should have ordered a medium in this item.  Good quality just wrong size.
3.0,The glasses are wonderful but I was a little disappointed on the bag it came with. It shows a black triple crown bag but I got a pink bag.
3.0,Too small and the material was not what was expected
3.0,Too big for my face and doesnt sit balanced. Otherwise it looks cute
3.0,"All of these are cute, though they're pretty low quality. Also, the description states that all of the rings are hinged, but half of the fourteen I received are not hinged. This means the only way to get them in or out is to bend them, so those won't last very long since bending them destroys the shape after one or two times."
3.0,little small order size up
3.0,"Held up great , not as warm as I would have wanted but overall a good glove."
3.0,"The description says they are 8 mm.  I assumed they would all be 8 mm, but the white ones were the only ones that were.  the other 2 were 6 mm."
3.0,More of a blouse than a button up. Very cheap feeling material and quality. The white one I got has a textured material and isn't matte like in the photo.<br />Returned.
3.0,"This did not look good on me but I just want to say FIVE STARS for the way the seller handled my problem and I highly recommend them, they are awesome!"
3.0,"This item is well-made and can be folded easily to fit in a suitcase. Unfortunately, raincoat didn't come in my size. I had to return it."
3.0,"I bought these to try out a new brand instead of Nike or Adidas. It isn't comparable. They aren't strong enough in the waist area to hold you in tight. With lots of movement, they slide down to where your constantly pulling them back up. I wouldn't recommend these for working out."
3.0,Very warm! The only thing I didn't like is that you have to wear them with a long shirt/blouse because the seam in the front looks a bit awkward
3.0,"Love the material, I am not a large breasted women yet there was tugging in the breast area that opened between buttons the rest fit well.  I did see together between buttons to modify and not have the gap ."
3.0,Pretty watch.  The band was extremely short and no way to expand it.
3.0,"I would’ve given this 5 stars but as u can see in the 1st photo, this is wat I received. In the 2nd photo , it’s wat was advertised! Completely different from what I thought I was receiving! A bit disappointed, is cheaply made but it is comfy, All in all it’s alright for the price!"
3.0,Cool was off. More like a dusty black
3.0,"It's not horrible, I just wouldn't wear it to a wedding or to anywhere too fancy. The style is fancy & cute, but the quality is a bit cheap."
3.0,"I ordered this because I am short and even petites are too long.  Unfortunately,  it is two inches too long. I called to see if they could use the measurements and photo and replace it with one shorter. They seemed unfamiliar with the made to measure and after chatting with three people, I have to return it and try again."
3.0,"The Velcro bands are fairly thick, so if you use form fitting slacks/jeans, people might be able to see a line in your tights. Same goes for the broaches that hook to the shirt, they are not slim at all, so you'll see some bunches around your pants. If you use looser pants then you'll have no issue whatsoever :)."
3.0,They only come high  just under the knee.
3.0,"The sleeves are tight and the picture is misleading. The design on the sleeves is only stamped on. I should have known for the price it wouldn't be embroidered. It didn't shrink and it is nice and warm. If you want it roomier and longer go up a size (or 2). All in all, I wear it a lot, but just to knock around in. It's not the unique piece I was hoping for."
3.0,"They are sunglasses. They block the sun. They are &#34;Ok&#34; hence three-stars but seem to me no different from any generic supermarket brand. Would I buy them OK- shrugs - not really as I can go to the local market and pick up a generic pair without waiting to have them shipped.<br />Polarized- hmm well - again you wouldn't notice it outside of any &#34;dark' sunglass. It's not like you will be looking through water, cutting out the clear to see whats underneath. Nope these wont do that. They are simply a dark sunglass.<br />."
3.0,"Very cheap material and unflattering, fits small.<br />I would have returned but it was not worth the hassle."
3.0,"These shoes are okay. Not the greatest quality, but work for a non walker."
3.0,Nice shirt. Materal a little thin but OK.
3.0,Product ok. Runs big. Not for walkers.
3.0,The dress fit mostly but one sleeve is smaller than the other which makes it kind of uncomfortable.  But it’s hard to complain for the price.. this will be a one time wear for a wedding.
3.0,My daughter wore them about 7 or 8 times before one of them ripped. They looked good on her though.
3.0,Good sized but does not distribute the weight comofrotably. So it felt so heavy with only a few things in it.
3.0,So they held up for a little while by begins to tarnish if kept in too long and The clamp on rings was very hard to get out of my septum
3.0,"Our 4 year old has minor SMA and has weakness in his legs, making him a lot more prone to falls. I went looking for some comfy slippers that had extra traction..got these and the soles were more like hard plastic..making them more slippery. My son loved the feel of them, but they increased how often he'd fall. Now, I'm just looking for DIY ways to add traction to them."
3.0,the horshoe rings are a good fit for nearly any nose type but the gemmed rings are a bit to flashy and large for a smaller nose
3.0,Its alot bigger than I wanted .  I gave it to a friend
3.0,"It’s pretty cute but not the color pictured…much lighter brown. The Swiss for dues not match the darker brown. I loved the fit, though. I will probably dye the kimono."
3.0,short in the back and not true to color. the item i bought isn't here anymore but it showed a red in the picture and it was  more of a hot orange
3.0,Amazing and works well. Only issue is the app to run it kills your battery. I tried it on both my phone... I phone 11 and rog phone 3... Definitely has you waking up right before though so you don't get zapped. It works amazingly.
3.0,It was beautiful but too big
3.0,"The backs on these are really hard to screw on/tell if you've screwed them on.  They are so tiny that they are hard to hold and don't give you anywhere to grip to twist them.  Since the front of the earring is round also, I basically stand somewhere easy to recover the backs and then test them bug wiggling furiously to make sure they're secure before moving on."
3.0,Tight Fit
3.0,Love it but my underwrite came out after three uses needs to be in there more secure and maybe use just plastics not wire
3.0,"The arms are a little tight but with the stretch it works.<br />The length is mid calf on me (5'4"") and perfect for my needs."
3.0,Went up in size and it fit my 8 year old perfectly.
3.0,"I really love this swimsuit, the reason for the 3 stars and not 5, is first the sizing is WAY off.....I'm normally a size 12, so I ordered a large.....only to have to return it, and order a 2x.<br />And that was even a bit tight, although it was fine......2nd, the first time that I wore it, I didn't wash it before going to the beach.....I don't know what happened but when getting wet. The blue color bled, only it the back of the bathing suit....I had blue dye on my skin when I took it off.....I still got a lot of compliments on it, but now I can't wear it, because of all the dye.....I would like to get another one, but afraid it will do it again......the instructions did not mention to wash b4 use."
3.0,I had ordered four different styles of masks but three of them turned out same exact print.
3.0,"When washing these socks after the first use, they were half the size. I do not recommend this product."
3.0,"These are really cute but lost a star due to comfort. There are 2 very thick seams that run up the buttock. I've seen some reviewers say these seems go up the front, but the toe of the tights has an almost double seem for comfort. That seem would run under the toe where pressure is applied if worn the opposite way. I'll still make it work because the color pattern is so cool"
3.0,Elastic on sleeves too tight.  Bodice on dress is too large in bust area.
3.0,They will work in an emergency which is what I bought them for.  I just expected handkerchiefs more like the old ones I had.  I must have been dreaming that day.  They are just OK.
3.0,"These earrings were nice, but too small for me."
3.0,I got this for my oldest daughter for ref is XL in most clothes but for tops she ranges from XL-1X and this I ordered a XL just because I didnt want the pants to be too big on her. This comes in vacuumed sealed which I think is nice given whats going on in our world that gave me a sense of ease. However you will need to air this out as there is a very strong smell to the fabric and not the most pleasent but it does go away after a few days. The material to the set feels very strong and soft and comes off just as its pictured on the sellers page. The fabric itself does not have much stretch or give to it. My daughter was able to fit the pants with no problem but the top almost looks like a L instead of an XL. Overall I do think this comes across as a jogger you could buy in any retail store there wasnt anything special to it but I do think the quality comes off a little better made and matching one another than one you would find in any retail shop. We are disappointed that the top wont fit her but she does have a sister that can wear that and she can just keep the pants to wear with other things.
3.0,"for an XL this was very snug. The fabric is ok, not as opaque as I had hoped but with a white bra and maybe an under shirt it would be fine... if it wasn't so snug. It's hard to layer when it barely fits. The length is perfect for a shirt, not a dress.  I'm 5'9'' and it barely covers my butt.<br /><br />For the price I won't complain but I also don't plan to wear it except with one specific wool skirt I have."
3.0,"Not for me, returned."
3.0,The body fit okay but was way too short. I'm 5'5&#34; 150 lbs. and ordered a large.
3.0,They dont look like the pics they would be perfect if made medal. They did come with a bonus rubber pair free
3.0,"This hand and foot cream is pretty thick. It has a nice lavender smell. I have very dry feet and it does soften them. However, it takes forever to absorb. When I put something on my skin I’m usually on the go I don’t have time to wait around five minutes for a cream to absorb. If you’re using this at night and put socks on your feet it would be fine. But you’re not going to want to put it on and then get right in bed or it will end up all over your sheets. I probably would not get this again as I prefer my creams to absorb quickly and I don’t want to wait on them."
3.0,Love the sweater but arrived smelling like someone wore it for days and didn’t use deodorant. Disgusting!
3.0,"It's pretty and you can definitely make out the picture. But, it'd have been nice if the picture covered the whole thing."
3.0,Cheaply made. Would only but it for a gag gift.
3.0,To big for me and they were broken
3.0,Smaller than anticipated..It is pretty but there is no give at all in the fabric.
3.0,"They don’t look like the photo with the lenses being multi colored, they look worse in person with solid red"
3.0,"I don't put them in the dryer,  I'm afraid they will shrink up,  but they are very warm"
3.0,It’s a nice sweater but it’s thin. I really thought it was like an actual sweater and it’s not. It’s still nice though! It’s just not what I thought.
3.0,It is an ok shirt. Not really fancy looking. I thought it was a bit baggy. The material was not that appealing.
3.0,Poor detail
3.0,"Definitely need to size up. This is very narrow. Normally a size 8. When I tried the shoe on with thick socks, and thin socks the  heel and arch expanded over the sole of the shoe. Strange sizing. They seem to be waterproof but need to return for different size."
3.0,The chain itself is great. I ordered rose gold and it appears to be a regular gold color compared to the rose gold chain my girlfriend has. She has long enough hair in the back so I didn’t bother exchanging it.
3.0,Came with the strap ripped off but was rasy to repair. Just sewed it back on. And daughter loves it.
3.0,Very thin material. I wanted to wear this by itself for cycling but I'm going to have to still wear a bra under it. I wear a 40DDD.
3.0,It was not really butterfly wing like I thought and it was tighter than the other shirt and they were sent together. Oh well…smh
3.0,"I like the color and the feel of the fabric.  It does the job of keeping me warm (as warm as expected for a thin scarf).  I give it three stars for that combined with the price.<br /><br />I am taking off two stars because I have a beard and the fabric comes loose and sticks in it.  I'm constantly finding myself ruffling my hands through my beard to remove pieces of fabric.<br /><br />For the price, this scarf has both form and function, but it's not worth it because of the fabric issue."
3.0,Runs small. My son size is a xl bought an xl. It was to small. Tight in arms and stomach area.
3.0,The back on one of the earrings is all bent wide open....can't wear them ;-(
3.0,"These are cute, but the size is strange for me. I'm usually a small in shorts like this (any size up would have been way too baggy), but the elastic on the waist is way too tight for me. Bummer because they are super cute!"
3.0,"cheaply made with a piece of wood...it functions as expected, but for the price it should be mother of pearl. I could DIY this!"
3.0,The glue dots provided do not stick well and the pom Poms fell off.
3.0,"This shirt is really cute, but runs VERY small.  After reading the other reviews I ordered a 3XL, I usually wear a Large or XL.  Also the top part is extremely short, more like a scarf."
3.0,Smaller than expected. Ordered a 3x when I'm normally a xl/1x and it was tight.
3.0,The bag was a beautiful bag but a lot smaller than I anticipated.
3.0,Love the softness and the color but these pants don’t hold their shape after a very short time wearing them. I have the cozy chic lite and the cozy chic original and they are both fine but the ultra light stretch too quickly and don’t look flattering
3.0,"I ordered the white one in a size Large. The pattern is very pretty but I have to return it. I didn't see anyone saying in the reviews you have to be nearly 7 ft tall for the length to not go way past your feet. Yes, I am short, only 5' 1&#34; but it was atleast 6&#34; to be taken off to still be long and have to wear high heels with it. The struggles of being short. Lol I was thinking about having it altered but not sure if its really that possible with the stretchy material. I dont think I know anyone tall enough to wear so have to return it. Hopefully I dont have to pay for the return."
3.0,I don’t like the material. Feels very cheap . Worth for a night
3.0,Don’t like the feel of the material
3.0,Great suit but it broke the first time I wore it.
3.0,Working with them on a replacement as the item broke after first couple of uses.
3.0,Loved them till they broke
3.0,It's really cute but more of a top than a dress
3.0,"I love my African lunch bag and my t- shirt,  however the bag had alot of creases from the 2 handles and my the way it was folded. The picture on the bag looks  damaged. The seller needs to find a different wat to fold the bag so it would not damage the picture. Overall everyone loves my 3 pieces."
3.0,"The dimensions listed for a Large were my size, but the arms are a bit long and the jacket is very full."
3.0,"Fit well, cute and comfortable but very lightweight so that I was aware of temperature in restaurant- maybe just me but when one wears long sleeves it must be at least Fall, not Summer…<br />That’s why I took away stars."
3.0,"I’m a pear shape and this did NOT work ,  it made me look fatter and stockeier ."
3.0,I liked the product but it had a tear on one of the sleeves
3.0,I’ve found the bottle opener gets a lot of crud stuck in it. If you wear these only on the beach and street they’ll be fine but watch out on dirt or mud.<br /><br />The toe strap broke very quickly (less than six months and not particularly worn) which was disappointing.<br /><br />Higher arch support than rainbows.
3.0,"A bit bigger than i expected and longer. Ordered a small, needed an extra small. Other than that i have no complaints. Fabric is a sateen material and heavy. Doesn’t feel cheap. Getting on shortened and taken in."
3.0,It's cheap and needs to be ironed a lot and was somewhat large but it's still really cute and I'm excited to where it on my vacation to the beach.
3.0,"Very cute. But, the headband area irritates my forehead."
3.0,Looks nice. Fits a little tight up top if you have a larger chest. Had to light iron because package wrinkles did not come out in wash.
3.0,Still haven't received the fabric cover for the hand bag as promised.
3.0,"Does not match series 3 “rose” gold, but it’s pretty close; a little too pink. Seems like the “color” will wear off relatively quick. It showed some rub off in a few places right out of the box."
3.0,"The case is really cute. It looks a lot like the picture and is quite vibrant. However, it's a little smaller than my phone. The corners pop off at least once a day and are difficult to readjust. I may have gotten a defective case."
3.0,"Soft enough, after washing still like size 3X instead of 2X that I ordered."
3.0,I didn't pay close attention to the length of the front so it is shorter than I care for.  The fabric is great!  Nice and soft.
3.0,Disapointed because the white one is not like the picture it is off white/cream.
3.0,"Body type: 120-123 lbs, 5'4 1/2'', broad shoulders, rectangular shape<br /><br />Received a very wrinkly thin dress in clear plastic amazon packaging. In the age of package thieves, it's a little worrisome because anyone could see what was inside.<br /><br />Despite the dress being folded neatly, there were deep wrinkles everywhere. I tried to iron out the wrinkles and used a wrinkle release spray. It got most of the wrinkles out but not all of them. Material was cheap looking and was loose on the chest. Sizes run big and the sleeves would fall off my arms. Even with the loose fit, the sleeves don't allow you to move your arms much without pulling the dress off the chest. Would be best to use bra tape to tape the dress to your chest/bra.  The light blue was darker in person."
3.0,"My package came with lots of bats!! But only 2 Different kinds & sizes. But the bats themselves are nice, soft, rubbery, & look good. Should be lot's of fun for my grandsons"
3.0,"Okay, but quality is on the low end."
3.0,"My insole keeps moving every time I walk on my left boot...bothers me.  Otherwise, for the price very comfortable, attractive shoe!"
3.0,It does make your head look weird. The ones with the space for you hair might be better.
3.0,Bright colors and grandson loves it! It is a bit too long for a boy's size small.
3.0,"I didn't read the size description closely. Though, really cute it is a bit too big for me."
3.0,"This is seriously cute, but the hearts are almost white, like an off-white pink. Also, there was this tiny hard substance stuck to one of the backs of the tiny pearls, but it is hardly noticeable. The locks/backs were rubber instead of what was in the picture, but i prefer it that way anyway."
3.0,Very fluffy
3.0,"much smaller than the photo , hard to make out its dolphins"
3.0,The pockets on this dress are quite low and they push out making your hips look wider which I do not need.  It's also quite long and runs a little big.  Not flattering.  It was returned.
3.0,the material is good quality except for the top part which unsewed.
3.0,"The lot was pretty good, only drawback was one of the diamond rings came missing a diamond making that one unwearable. Other than that, great value for the money."
3.0,"Snug fit for a 10 year old,  it fits 8-9 year olds better."
3.0,They were not as anti-glare as I expected.  Purchased another similar pair to compare but I received two of the same pair.  Disappointing especially since I contacted the merchant and never heard a response.  Oh well!
3.0,arms a little tight so didn't get to wear it
3.0,Loved the watch till only 6 months later battery died which should last longer.
3.0,The material is super thin and it ripped at the seem the first time I wore it. I sewed it. It's light and airy and the pattern is pretty. I didn't expect anything amazing given the price but I didn't expect it so cheap
3.0,These are hard to see the skull. I should of gotten a lighter color. But love the size & quality.
3.0,"The robe was to small, I sent it back."
3.0,La polera la compre hace tres meses y ya presenta pelusas.
3.0,Static dress dont like it
3.0,"They're rather thin! Definitely for decorative purposes only. I wore them for a 2 mile Christmas fun run & the front seam had pulled a little in just those 2 miles. I think they'll last maybe 2 holiday seasons, but don't expect high quality."
3.0,I had to cut them to open space for the finger. Came closed
3.0,"it is not what I expected, more like a hosiery to wear with skirt or just under pants to keep warm."
3.0,I liked the overall design. I don't think its made from real leather as advertised
3.0,This specific color stated men's. It was my fault for not paying attention. For women it's too big. Other than that it's a great product.
3.0,Nice material and quality made
3.0,Mu bueno cabe perfecto el control y la llave del coche además de las llaves de casa.
3.0,"Quality is just ok,fabric has absolutely zero give/stretch"
3.0,"I returned before even trying it on, could easy tell a very tight waist."
3.0,Sill trying to figure it out.
3.0,"I’m 5’6 and weigh 153 lbs. and the large isn’t big enough. I’m not sure what I was expecting, but this is a piece of fabric that you tie on. The pattern is pretty but I can’t imagine using this style wrap skirt for anything but a coverup."
3.0,it was a hit with the kids but they break so easily. I dropped one in the kitchen and it just went into pieces. Some of them didn't make the shipping process either.
3.0,"The dress is pretty big, I would stay true to size or size down. I wish I would have got a small and I’m 5’1 140 pounds."
3.0,Cute little bag.  Base is 4x3.  It is 4 inches to top of clasp.  I love the small details like the lace inside.
3.0,"The rhinestones did not go all the way around as I expected.  So, although the belt fits (I can fasten it), my larger than a medium<br />waist makes the plain area become exposed and it's not very pretty.  Wish I would have purchased a large.  (Did not try to<br />return it - too much hastle. I am sure they would have complied if I would have requested to do so)."
3.0,"Way too long, and I bought a small and will have to cut a foot of it off!! Pretty."
3.0,"These goggles work really well, but for a short period of time. If you swim regularly, they start getting foggy within a month."
3.0,"Soft fabric. Great color. Cute style. Stretchy. Cannot lift your arms as the dress rides up. Way up. If you pull the dress down, it sits at the perfect length, however if you move, the dress rises significantly. I have to return. I am 5ft 6, short-legged and weigh 115lbs.size small.  Fits as pictured, but about 4 inches shorter than the photo when you move. Might be cute with cropped leggings."
3.0,"The unit is a lot shorter than in the provided pic.<br />Covering my nose and under my eyes, it barely covers most of my neck.<br />I does not drape down to any part of my chest.<br />If you want coverage for your face and neck, it's fine."
3.0,It's nice. It is what I was looking for. I would buy from them again. I liked the time it came in too.
3.0,"I usually wear an X-large for Miusol, but this x-large was either a little bit bigger than what I usually wear...or I lost weight. It is however very pretty and the quality is definitely Miusol worthy."
3.0,"I got these gloves for early morning long winter runs near my home in Arizona (elevations 3500-4000').  They are fine for temperatures above 45F.  For temperatures 35-45F, my hands start too get cold after an hour and I end having to switch to a different pair of gloves.  I suppose that should not be surprising considering my hands have by then had hour to sweat, but these are supposed to be made of wicking material.  These gloves are certainly more stylish than cheap three for $2.00 dollar store gloves.  With the bright yellow they are probably more visible to passing motorists.  But having used both. I do not think they are any warmer, and that is why I purchased them."
3.0,"cheap material and thin, but you get what you pay for"
3.0,Mine ran small.  Fabric is warm and has no give or stretch.  Too uncomfortable to keep especially tight in underarm area so I sent back.<br />The print was stylish and colorful.
3.0,"It’s an “okay” shirt. The colors are perfect, and match the picture. The material is “eh”. Good enough to keep, not good enough to order again."
3.0,"It works for storing jewelry, and looks nice on my dresser, so overall am glad i bought it, but is very wobbly and may comes apart easily.  Some of the connections can be secured and others not so much."
3.0,The adhesive is not as strong as I had hoped but luckily my dress was tight so it held it in place. I am a full C and was able to wear it all night out in Vegas where it's hot. It served it's purpose.
3.0,Too big for average size face
3.0,Quality not as expected. Returned.
3.0,"I bought these thinking they might serve as a quick coronavirus mask.  Turns out they are much too stretchy to be of any real use to keep particles from passing in or out, but in a pinch pulling this up over your face is ""better than nothing.""<br /><br />I've also found if you double it up and slip a sheet of ""shop towel"" in between the layers, covering your nose and mouth,  it does indeed offer more protection.<br /><br />If nothing else, it's easy enough to slip this over your head and wear it around your neck like a scarf or necklace.  And then, if you see yourself getting into a situation where you might want to have a mask, you can quickly pull it up over your face,  as I say...better than nothing.<br /><br />At the very least, wearing this band around your face like a mask will send a message to others that you are taking your safety seriously and may prevent others from coming in too close."
3.0,"The denim is quality material and is a perfect weight for summer, and the hardware is going to last forever. So anyone with a normal figure will probably love these overalls. But after reading reviews that said 'order 1 to 2 sizes larger' I went 2 sizes up. I did that because I have a shape no one ever designs for. I am the same measurements in my bust, waist and hips. It never mattered what I weighed (at one point I weighed only 96 pounds and I'm 5', 2 and my measurements were equal even then). If I order pants that fit in the waist, I look like I'm wearing a clown outfit in the hips, legs and length. So I ordered the pair according to the sizing chart, went up 2 sizes on the pair thinking it would at least fit my waist and I could have the rest of the overalls tailored... but the waist was simply HUGE. I would love to get the size that works, but then I'd be playing the &quot;try every size you  have in stock and I'll keep one and return the other 18 pairs.&quot; Even then I probably wouldn't find the right size. So I'm giving up. Someone please call me when they design clothes for women like me."
3.0,stiff skirt. kinda rough. the elastic waist band created a puffy stomach pouch. Length true to picture. Runs large. It's very shinny and somewhat looked cheap. Something for a mature older lady. I got the M... if i liked it I would've had to return it for a S. Not for me.
3.0,good quality just too small for me..
3.0,I thought it was a sweatshirt but just cotton.very lightweight.
3.0,"I got these any they are so SOFT!  But the pants are short on me. I am 5’4”. I ordered a large as I wanted them to be a bit baggy. The 2 shirts and shorts fit wonderful, but the pants are like high water pants. I am a bit bummed. I only had washed them in old water and let them air dry. They should not have skunked."
3.0,The case itself is nice and works well for the glasses. The hook is plastic but I thought about replacing it with a metal one anyway. I didn't have to worry about. Not one full day that it was hooked on my work bag did the strap that goes from the hook to the case itself completely unravel and disintegrate. I purchased this for the sole purpose of clipping it to my bag or belt and it didn't even last 24 hours.
3.0,Normally 12/14 so ordered XL.  Too snug
3.0,I liked this dress! It was just way too sheer and I couldn’t find a pregnancy garment to go underneath. So I returned it.
3.0,"I've had this bag for a few years and wear it to work several days a week, so I use it a lot, and the edges on the handles and the top of the bag have worn off, it looks terrible.  The bag itself is great quality leather and great shape, but compared to my Coach bag, this is one does not hold up"
3.0,EHHH
3.0,I like the colors! Its ok for my toddler son!
3.0,This dress just hung on me. It didn't feel comfortable at all
3.0,I really wanted a mustard yellow statement necklace. It was harder to find than I expected. This one fit the bill. It took a long time to arrive. Also? At times the stones get stuck & the necklace won't lay flat.
3.0,Too many duplicate bracelets.
3.0,"it is nice, but it look wired because it is yellow,no like gold"
3.0,"Not as wide as I thought it would be,if phone rings hard to get out fast,"
3.0,"If you want to be bothered every hour with beeping, this is the watch for you.  My spouse hates these beeps and wants me to return the watch.  The instructions have info to stop the beeps, but it does not work.  The watch beeps anyway.<br />If anyone can tell me how to stop the beeping, I would greatly appreciate it."
3.0,Really cute dress but not for busty me. It was an XL and fit everywhere else. I gave it to a friend who was grateful.
3.0,"Bought this to replace my current lulu define jacket and had to return because it runs large and does not have the same compression. Decent quality and material, just not the same."
3.0,Cute and worked for my performance but tarnished after I left in a moist bag. Shame but affordable for the price and I love the different sizes. Good for once in awhile use
3.0,"Not very flattering, the fabric is not my favorite, you have to iron and iron and is very stiff. I kept the dress but definitely not my favorite,"
3.0,Beautiful dress unfortunately I couldn’t wear it. It runs too small. I ordered an xl but it was more like a large.
3.0,It was cute but the colors are a little different in person. I ordered a small - I’m 5’3” and 105 lbs for reference - and it was big on me. I don’t mind a loose fit but this was too loose.
3.0,"Pretty earrings, but just a little to small for me, but I kept them because I needed a black pair."
3.0,"These are just okay. The length is good, the color is pretty, although not same color as photo. They do not fit well. Very tight waist that doesn’t stretch much at all. I have found others that are way better fitting"
3.0,Quite heavy however the tassel looks nice
3.0,"A fine watch. After wearing it a little, I began to realize that you can get a much better watch for the same price. Try a Seiko 5 or similar on eBay. Much higher quality and same price."
3.0,"It arrived creased because it had not been packaged properly and was squezed in the package. If it hadn't come from China and hadn't been cheap enough I would have returned it. I had to put it in water and reshape it by putting towels inside. It's still not perfect. It's a little too big, and does not have a way to adjust the size, so I had to buy something at &#34;Head Covers&#34; to adjust it."
3.0,"These ended up being too small for my face lol, I'll have to pass them onto a friend whos face isnt as wide as mine! The quality is surprisingly good though!"
3.0,Too small in the thigh area
3.0,Good quality. Just be aware they’re small and more fit for children than adults.
3.0,The sizes run larger then expected
3.0,hands are still cold
3.0,"It's kinda cute but it's not at all what I thought I was getting, lil upset but whatever"
3.0,More slim fitting than it looks in the picture.
3.0,Shown as picture but small and way overpriced.
3.0,Fiance really likes the jacket after the 2nd time we reordered still a bit small even though we went up a size. I assume it is just the trendy tight fit style of the day.
3.0,It was a nice band but it wore out in 6 months and now I am buying another one. The piece right along the hinge of the watch wore out with normal use and finally split. I would not recommend this item.
3.0,"Cute, but slips when advertised that it does not."
3.0,I liked the jacket but it was damaged when I received it.
3.0,"These Bamoer Cubic Zirconia Platinum Plated Flower earring came in a nice sturdy earring box with the logo Bamoer. There are 2 color options but I selected the rose gold plated and these earring studs are beautiful and perfect size for my ears (half the size of a dime). The mixed of rose gold and clear cubic zirconia are very sparkly when lights reflects off of them. I like to wear these earrings on when I'm going out for dinner with my LBD, they make my outfit feel sophisticated. They are light-weighted and comfortable to wear for long hours. After wearing for 2 weeks the 3 crystals have fell out. I was offered these earrings at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"There doesn't seem to be anything deluxe about these. They are not larger than the average W.G. posts, which is what I was looking for when I ordered them. But the price wasn't bad and so I kept them as spares."
3.0,I ordered an extra large and it fits me like a medium. I wanted it to be baggy but it hugs my butt very tight. I normally wear an XL and I expected it to fit. I like the material and the shape but it just runs way too small.
3.0,Does the bag have warranty? the wire support around the bag pushed through the bottom of the bag. My email is jessecannon10@yahoo you can also contact me at 701-240-8717.
3.0,Fits and looks great but is not made very well.
3.0,"The belts have pen all over the side that shows, and are glued on, despite the appearance of riveting."
3.0,"You get what you pay for, for the buck this item is okay, the stamped writing is almost gone and unless you hold it in the light you can't read it.  The seams are even, the plastic zipper inside doesn't work but for the price, it's okay.  I'll give it to the neighbor kid."
3.0,"This is good quality. Thin yet warm, delicate, snags a bit easy. It is a blanket scarf so it is quite large. If you are small in stature this scarf might overpower you- and forget about gathering it around your neck...if you want to wear it in more of the shawl type styles- this is your scarf. You can drape and belt it or tie it around your shoulders."
3.0,It's a bit different. It sure doesn't have the little string by the waist.
3.0,"What is there to say, it’s under wear"
3.0,Good quality and flattering the back but so bulky that it made it look like a utility worker's uniform - janitor's uniform. I returned it.
3.0,"Cloth used: Thin, plastic feel<br />Cutting: OK<br />Size: True"
3.0,"this product was described as ""fits correctly, order to size""..... even so, i ordered a size larger and was sorely disappointed to find that it was STILL way too small!! have already returned..."
3.0,I love the onesie and the shorts. The suspenders however where cheap and fell apart before he could even wear it.
3.0,"It fits well and is true to size. It's flattering on my size 10 frame. The big issue is that the backside (the butt) isn't lined like the front is, which means you can see my butt crack! I'm sure it will be even worse when wet. I love it so much that I'm going to ask my grandma to sew in a lining for me...but I wish I didn't have to go through such a hassle."
3.0,"I haven't used them in exercise yet, but they  do have issues with sizes! I read that in other comments. I ordered M, I got L<br />They looked large the moment I took them out of the package. I tried them, I can do with this size only because they are supposed to be tight, and it's almost normal ones now, not right normal for (since they are larger).<br />I'm gonna use them and see if they seem ok while exercising and will update.<br /><br />But really,,, why do you mix up sizes!"
3.0,"I had bought this wallet to match a purse I had bought on Amazon. I really loved the deep red/burgundy color and was happy to have found a match. I believe I purchased in Dec. 2020. It is now July 2021 and seams have came apart from the card slots as well as glue detached. My cards are slipping out and I will start searching for a replacement wallet. I'm really bummed. If you're looking for a short term wallet or something not daily use, then this would be the one."
3.0,"Unfortunately, one of the suction cups were missing the hook needed to hold the product up. Looks like I need to head to the store."
3.0,This is a lot thinner than expected.  You might want to order a size up from what you would wear.  The zipper is difficult to maneuver.  The price was way too high for this low quality jacket.
3.0,I'm 5'4 weight 150 i order xxl it fits very nice great material but from the legs it fist me a little loose but its k. The only reason im giving it a 3 star is because in the opening area it feels very uncomfortable
3.0,Odd fit! Made for kids with a bigger butt! Very cute! Nice material
3.0,To simple
3.0,It's a little to tight and it looks more yellow than green
3.0,Just what I said above.<br />We will give it to our granddaughter in August for her 21st birthday.
3.0,Pretty tight and kind of hard to get on but it is alright
3.0,"Color was not gray at all,  more like an off-white.  Did not like the color at all!!  Returned...."
3.0,Fit is okay.
3.0,"The hat is very cheaply made. Tore right away on us, but the broom is still doin great! Definitely wouldn’t pay what I did for this again though!"
3.0,"The part of the global map I received was not the same I saw advertised. May sound silly to some, but I was trying to match my passport cover and it doesn’t"
3.0,"Straight out of the bag, this shirt is clearly not ""super heavyweight"".  Mid-weight, at best.  The fit seems to run small, with the XL I ordered (and that is what the tag says) feeling more like a large.  And I haven't even washed it yet, so I don't know what will happen there.  Some of the seams, mostly the bottom cuff, are very rough-cut, as if rags were sewn on, backwards.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />Since I never intended this shirt to be outerwear, but a base layer under larger, better-made sweatshirts, none of those apparent ""negatives"" really matter.  For outerwear, I'll stick with the Carhartt."
3.0,"I wanted to love this, but I just couldn't. First off, the material does feel great, but the crocheted part is super stiff, and came with snags and knoted up pieces of thread all in it. There were also several loose strings along many of the seams, making it feel very cheaply thrown together. The sizing was pretty good, as it is meant to fit a little large. However, those pockets... very odd placement! Be sure to order this when it's Prime eligible (for free returns), just in case."
3.0,"Was not at all what I expected! I'm a size 10(US), I ordered a size XL which was the equivalent to a size 5(US)!!!!!  The fabric is flimsy like a headscarf, absolutely horrible."
3.0,Pretty but too small in the bust area. I even ordered a size up!
3.0,"very small. 5' 2&#34; and you cant see to well either, but short college age kid took it to school and had fun with it."
3.0,"DId not fit as it looked. However, well made and good quality fabric."
3.0,"Only worn them once so far and I think that was a little premature. Wore them for the 'Turkey Trot' and it just wasn't quite cool enough to wear them. My fault...I bought them more out of curiosity than to wear on a regular basis. Fit is great as I followed the advice on the link. Overall happy with them, just not sure they're for me."
3.0,Definitely cheap but good for a different look. Costume jewelry
3.0,"The top has a strange cut, the slit is very high up the front of the thigh, the material is nice and light. Size is true to fit for what I typically wear."
3.0,"I purchased this set for my daughter's role as a monkey in a children's theater production of The Jungle Book. The tail was not quite long enough to twirl in some of the choreographed parts, but it worked well enough."
3.0,Very small in the shoulders and arms. I have narrow shoulders and this was still super snug.
3.0,These rings are so stinkin cute but not easily adjustable. They feel like they might snap if bent which makes me think these are resin and not real metal.
3.0,"I find the masks to be a little loose, and feel that they don't protect me enough."
3.0,Not as tall. N sort of narrow but overall nice shoes
3.0,"Good quality (for a cheapo tie), it was too big for a boys tie like advertised."
3.0,"This is a decent quality dress for the price, in terms of construction. It’s actually quite pretty, but I think I got the fit all wrong. I followed the recommended measurements and bought a size L, but feel like it’s too big. There’s also quite a bit of fabric at the sides, more than I had anticipated, so I just don’t think it’s very flattering on my pear-shaped body. It makes my big hips look enormous. Sad this didn’t work out and will have to return."
3.0,This is not red. It’s orange. It’s just a basic T-shirt style.
3.0,"Look cheap, don't fit properly, wasn't able to return on time so end up in the scrap material for crafting."
3.0,"Low quality fabric, very thin and wrinkled"
3.0,just a tube of cloth. Not what expected but still works
3.0,Nice suit but runs big.
3.0,"Silicon is very thin, metal tunnels have sharp edges. Wore them for the first time the other day and the metal edge cut my ear. The stone plugs are stunningly beautiful and dainty. That's the only thing worth buying in this set."
3.0,Lightweight material.  The way the straps flow into the neckline makes the fit uncomfortable.  It didn't look good on.  Returned
3.0,cute top fits as expected just hate that strings tend to pull out but thats with all fox jerseys
3.0,Nice only problem is it Runs big even on the smallest hole.
3.0,Glasses broke off pretty quickly.
3.0,It is exactly as everyone has described in the reviews.  Even though I went up 2 sizes it still is not big enough to hang off my shoulder.  I am considering altering it myself since it is cheap.
3.0,"Of course, given all the sparkle, these are very pretty face masks. I got the black, white & red bundle. I think the red is harder to tell that it’s basically see through on me & the rhinestones distract from that as well ;P This whole mask thing has gotten out of hand, but people still have to go places & do things, so this is what I’ll wear to be able to breathe. Every single person I know that has gotten COVID has worn a mask & sanitized religiously. I, on the other hand, have a crappy immune system, never wear one unless I’m in a hospital or something, never sanitize out in public, never take the sanitized grocery carts, use public hand rails then touch my face, have been tested at work almost a dozen times & never had it.. Anyway, these are cute & breathable, but not too comfortable. Little rough on my nose & I wish the loops were adjustable. They’re a bit too small for me, so they start hurting my ears throughout the day. I may try to change the elastic eventually, but they’re fine for now."
3.0,"These are well made but the charm on it is upside down. When your child wears it, the charm is not facing the right away. It’s really annoying to me but it doesn’t take away from the effectiveness of the lanyard."
3.0,unfortunately it was too small I wish they carried it in larger sizes
3.0,Too small in shoulders and upper top for size XL
3.0,The pants are thick and well made but the light color makes them see through
3.0,"This bottom is advertised to match either the Cherish collection or the Acupulco collection. The blue is NOT the same as the Acupulco blue background =( The medium fits well, granted barely enough back coverage imho (I have 39.5&#34; hips and a 29&#34; waist). I'm thinking I will sent all back. Disappointing."
3.0,Very light weight. Almost too light. The fabric is super thin I wish it was a little better because it's kind of cheap looking. As long as no one touches it your good!
3.0,"I agree with all the positives about this watch but I'm surprised by the one negative: the light that lights the dial is not bright enough to illuminate anything.  So if you want to check the time in, say, a movie theater, you're going to be disappointed."
3.0,"It should be noted that these reccomend hand washing. I guess I should have listened, because after one wash in warm water, low tumble dry, they shrank probably a full size. I ordered a large but they don't fit comfortably now. I wish I had tried them on before washing to know for sure if they would have ever fit comfortably, but they looked fine, so I went with it. I can see having to hand wash pretty, lacy panties, but not basic ""cotton"".  Disappointing. On to the next!"
3.0,Pretty dress button  look cheap making the dress look cheap! I changed the button
3.0,Flimsy! Did not fit well with my slim face<br />Duco brand is excellent! 6 stars!
3.0,"I bought these specifically because the silver pair look like they have mirrored lenses.  They are not mirrored.<br /><br />Apart from that, they're pretty good, however I bought them for the mirror finish that I did not get.<br /><br />I would not buy them again."
3.0,"I love coolibar as a brand and have many of their shirts and a few hats.  This one was a bit small for my large noggin (61cm, or 7 5/8).  So, if you have a smaller head, this might work for you, but if you are carrying a large egg on your shoulders, you are going to need to look elsewhere.  Quality-wise, not quite a Tilley, but it's decent."
3.0,"I was so excited to get this blouse today then I tried it on and it’s too tight, I could barely get it off. !  I’m a true size large but ordered an XL because you just never know...  anyway went to try it on and it’s way to tight.  So disappointed!  XL is more like a medium in American sizes."
3.0,"The shoes are very cute and have a good sole, but they are so hard to get on my toddlers foot."
3.0,"Nice comfy slippers, but they do run slightly large. I ordered the medium, which is what I've worn in similarly styled slippers, (Isotoners) but this medium doesn't fit as snugly. Next time might try the small. I wear a size 7 to 7.5 in most shoes."
3.0,"The Tshirt is fine as an item.  I ordered the large, however it seems like a medium.  I guess I should have ordered extra large."
3.0,it’s quite odd having the pockets on the front like they are …
3.0,Button came off maybe I’m too fat
3.0,This dress is super cute and my daughter loves it but the bow pin arrived broken.  I ordered a replacement and the pin broke in the 1st wear.
3.0,I love the necklace but the chain is not strong enough and it broke.
3.0,"As others have mentioned these sweats are really comfortable and light. My only gripe is the mesh inside as I don’t know if you’re supposed to wear these shorts without underwear but I wouldn’t recommend it. Worth the price though! ***UPDATE*** the black shorts tore when I was putting my hand in my pocket, be careful with the stitching"
3.0,They aren't as stunning as the stock photo but they're pretty. They are a bit heavy. No markings on them and nothing in the packaging that shows what the metal is or that it is nickel free so I'm afraid to wear them!
3.0,They are as colorful as they appear in product photo
3.0,"I bought one of these dresses last summer, and I love it so much! BUT....... i just bought 2 more and the adjustable straps are at least 6 inches shorter than they used to be! The straps are so short now. And the cut of it is boxier and less flattering. So disappointing!"
3.0,"comfy tenners, but didn’t fit right"
3.0,It's tight across my chest (40DD)
3.0,Maybe to wear in winter my neck was green in summer  look very pretty but is cheap stuff..
3.0,"Very Fast shipping! I ordered from Amazon instead of Bad Birdie website because the polo had prime shipping and needed the polo to arrive on a specific day. I loved this shirt pattern reminds me of the old TV show Saved By The Bell. Also the material was super soft polyester high quality fabric, and was made very well. The problem however is the sizing of the Bad Birdie Polos. I went to Bad Birdies website and found the size chart. I measured some of my slim/athletic fit Polos that I already have in my closet. And I was confident that the Bad Birdie XXL polo that I ordered would fit based on the websites size chart and my measurments. When it arrives and I took it out of the plastic I kinda noticed that this polo was a little small looking so I grabbed my tape measure and measured the polo and the chest was 45.5 inches. The bad birdie website size chart says a XXL is supposed to be 47"" to 50"" for the chest. The polo I received was 45.5. Way to small, almost laughable compared to other athletic Polos I wear regularly. So I returned the polo. I wish the polo fit. Also I wish Bad Birdie would make bigger sizes to offset the crazy size that they offer. A 3xl would fit me I guess. Dosent make sense though. I wear a XL in regular loose Polos and XXL in Athletic fit Polos. Like Link Soul and Travis Matthew's and others that have a more slimmer polo. Sad I love the quality and patters. Fun Polos just sizing way off"
3.0,Large sizes not as small as expected
3.0,"Directions for changing out the lenses are less than basic.  Tried several times to remove the nose section so could remove lens. Doesn't work. Rubber came off, but plastic clip still there.  Stuck with the lens that's in the glasses. Afraid the frames or lens or both will break.Went on the Internet to see if doing it correctly. Sunglasses appear to look slightly different then what I have in my hand."
3.0,"This is an ""ok"" jacket/poncho. I was hoping for suede, but it is a cheap one sides fleece. Wasn't super impressed. Bought 3 from different sellers in hopes of one of them actually looking like the picture. If you really want this, go with the least expensive bc they are literally exactly the same."
3.0,Not really denim!
3.0,"The style is cute, the price is right, and I usually love this brand.  I don't love this dress.  I know that all of the Belle Poque dresses are short waisted, but this was too short overall.  Usually their dresses hit just below the knee, this was about two inches above (I'm 5'9&#34;).  The fabric also seems thinner than usual."
3.0,"I like the material, color is exactly as pictured.  I have been ordering 2x's and they have been fitting great.  This shirt is really too large for me though and I don't like the way the big neck looks on me.  Kinda sloppy looking."
3.0,I thought when I first opened them that they would be way too small. I am 5 7 and 140 lbs and I ordered a medium. But they stretch nicely and I really liked them once I got them on. If I could go back I would have ordered a large though because I like my stuff bigger on me but that is just my preference.<br /><br />UPDATE!<br />So I loved these when I first got them so I ordered a bunch of pairs. Unfortunately almost all the pairs have rips in the seams in the butt and crotch area after just a few washes. Makes me super sad!
3.0,Wasn't as well made or as big as I thought it would be.
3.0,"Decent quality, cute style but shrank a lot.  I even hung it dry.  Would order again but size up to compensate for shrinking."
3.0,"A bit small in size. Causes stress on frame, and eventually cracks.  It's me. I'm not standard size.  Otherwise, quite nice."
3.0,I thought one of the charms was you know how silver turns.
3.0,I bought this for my husband. It arrived quickly and looks amazing. Only downfall was the battery died quickly but that was an easy replacement.
3.0,"I read the reviews about the size, I'm a size medium, so I ordered a size XL and turns out the review was right."
3.0,"Very cute but it’s very small, it fits like a button up shirt rather than a sexy robe."
3.0,Runs small. Ordered XXL and still a bit tight. Typically XXL fit a bit large.
3.0,Love the design of jersey but its TOO short! So order one size up so its long enough... Im 5'7 - 140 pounds and needed a MED - Ordered a small my true size but for whatever reason this specific jersey runs short and small - I bought the small one but sleeveless from REI in a SM and it fits great! Not sure why the small with sleeves fits too snug and the length is a bummer - I kept it because I like the design so I will work thru the flaw....
3.0,"I usually by cheap sunglasses. But lured by cyber Monday, I decided to splurge on these.  They look good but the quality does not seem any better than the ones I buy for $10."
3.0,"I like this little purse, I just don’t love it. The strap is annoying and slides around, and the chain is very noisy. The lock is touchy and if you don’t get it exactly right, it’ll pop open. Lastly, the attachment for the strap is on the flap, not the body, so if the lock does pop open, the main compartment tips down and spills your stuff. You also can’t fill both sections to capacity, or it won’t close."
3.0,This product is good but not long lasting. The QR code wears off quickly especially if you work out in your apple watch
3.0,I don't like the work out material and it fits way to big
3.0,Very tight around my toes. My feet are medium so these large shoes should have fit perfectly but they did not.
3.0,It is a nice piece and fabric but if it was longer and not cropped. Had to return.
3.0,It was ok. Ran very small
3.0,"I purchased these on January 24, 2020. I loved them but the last week one of the screw backs keeps coming off.  Not very happy about that especially since they are on my 2 yr old granddaughter.  Time to shop elsewhere."
3.0,This is not a soft cotton. Fits snug not very flattering. The colors are pretty.
3.0,"Purchased size 6-12 for my 9 month son. It’s a very stiff material and was hard to get onto him. It looked cute on, but it seemed like a pretty rough material for a baby onesie."
3.0,They are alittle small but serve the ourpose
3.0,"The outside is a jersey-like material, and the lining is a nice, cashmere-like fleece.  It’s super soft, and has just the right amount of warmth.  The gown is a bit longer than I expected.  It stops just above my ankles.  It’s perfect!  I want one in every color!<br /><br />Update 2/11/2020:  After washing according to manufacturer’s instructions, the pink fleece is everywhere, and it sticks to anything washed with it!  The fleece inside the gown pulls badly.  It’s been washed many times since the first time I wore it.  It’s still warm and comfy, and even soft, but it’s not downy like it was the first time I wore it.  I’m changing my rating, just because the fleece sticking to everything has been a pink nightmare, and the fabric pilling has been a terrible disappointment."
3.0,If you clean then don’t expect to have them for so long later you clean them at least 10 times later. I have them for a few months and they are coming apart since I’m cleaning them because they need to be clean on some point.
3.0,If you have anything slightly curvy or less than modelesk it’s not the most flattering in the stomach. It got caught a bit at my hips but it zipped fine. I’m usually a US medium and I ordered a LARGE
3.0,"The pins are rather top heavy, and spin if not secured well enough, like on the mesh part of a cap. Most end up upside down."
3.0,It is pretty. The clasp is loose. That is disappointing.
3.0,"it doesn't look bad,but the date is very small and hard to read."
3.0,"They're swim shorts not regular shorts. The fabric is swimmers fabric, very thin and no lining."
3.0,"It's really beautiful, but I noticed on the first wearing that it had a hole in it. A bit disappointing since I don't sew."
3.0,"The band is too wide, not comfortable"
3.0,Bought for my daughter. Was more sized for an adult.
3.0,"Nice dress but the top fits small ,  cannot fit jave to give it away."
3.0,It's nice but not as long as the picture says. I am around 5'5 120 pounds and I have long legs and a short torso. The shirt ends at my waist.
3.0,Very cute pattern. I'm 5'3 and 115 pounds. I wear a 34b bra. I ordered a size small. This top is very tight and has very little stretch to it. The straps are very loose. It be ideal if the straps were adjustable and had a way to loosen the band. The bottoms fit just ok. Not really impressed with this bikini but for the price I'm just going to keep it and not send back.
3.0,"I'm a curvy midwestern gal.  If you are a little larger on top, this may not be the dress for you.  Fit well everywhere else though."
3.0,"I really love these socks...except that I've only had them for 2 months, and they are already getting holes. Definitely a bummer when they are so expensive. Noticed the holes right after the return window closed. These would be my favorite socks if they lasted. Wish they came with a warranty."
3.0,They are nice and good quality but they will have cool design in one of the earrings then the other one is plain.<br /><br />In the pic I’m showing all the better sides of them if they don’t have a good design in them in my opinion they should have not made it into the merch they sell. (Quality control should have rejected one of the earrings) Not everyone is as picky as me but the patterns in them reason i purchased.<br /><br />The one set standing up to the left doesn’t even look like a matching pair yet they let it be
3.0,These gloves work but are not the most comfortable and they slide down my arms.  Having them tight on the arms is a little awkward and leaves marks so they have to be slightly loose which causes them to slide.  I wash dishes by hand often and these help keep my hands dry and comfortable as long as I pay attention and don't let them slide too far down my arms.  The first pair somehow got a rip easily and the second pair is what I'm still using.  Multiple times daily and they work okay.  Would I purchase again?  Probably not.
3.0,"Belt is very stretchy, more so than other belts like this I have. This makes me have to really stretch it out to pull it tight enough, leaving a long &#34;tail&#34; that has to be tucked somewhere or it just flops around. Otherwise the belt seems well-made."
3.0,Pants were great but if you hold up you can see threw them...Material is thin.
3.0,"Very pretty but the arms was too small, i had to send back, im a size 12 i thought xl would fit."
3.0,The snaps on the crotch and scratchy
3.0,Loved it but small
3.0,"These are really great, the quality is good and they exactly are as pictured. The shipping was pretty quick, I thought I would have them by the 12th of April and I got them March 31st. The only reason I rated them three stars is because I was going to use them to size up to 1/2 inch but I got two different sizes. One below (which is the size I'm at right now) and one that's the 1/2 inch which I ordered. Other then that it's a good product."
3.0,"This is a great rain suit as far as keeping you dry, visibility, quality, and easy of putting on. The only down side is the way the individual items are made. I am 6' 2"", and the pants fit well except if I put them high enough to actually swing my leg over my bike, then the crotch as to lift so high that the pants lift above ankles. Additionally, the pants are very tight on knees with feet on pegs. If you wear a full face helmet, the hood storage area in the neck will also make it difficult to turn your head.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great quality rain suit. However, if you are taller or wear a full face helmet, it may not be a good choice overall.<br /><br />I would not that due to the quality it also doesn't pack down too small, it took up my entire saddle back. For a quality rain suit, this is a sacrifiece that you have to make; however, it is important to be aware."
3.0,"The cups fit exactly like the photo, but I failed to notice they cover barely above the nips, so if I bend over to pick something up, the cups move down underneath, and I'm showing more than I'd like on the shirt.  Uh oh.  I wear it anyway because it's comfortable and I need a black strapless bra."
3.0,Very sharp looking. Husband loves it. Its just worthless when it comes to keeping time.  Its basically a nice bracelet. FYI if you keep it in the bathroom when showering it will fog up. Dont panic just sit in a dry place and about an hpur or so it clears up.
3.0,"No flaws on the gold, and while it's too early to tell it has held up well with daily use for the past few weeks. My only complaint is that one side of the leather strap unfinished.<br /><br />*** update *** most of the gold rubbed off in 2 months of use."
3.0,Wrong was needed. Cant wear them. :(
3.0,"I bought this for me husband, the material is very good but the workmanship is not as impressive, I see lose threads around the shorts. And the sizes are not the same on all 12. Well, they are all XL but half of the short are really tight on him and half of it are comfortable. So if you are looking for XL, go 1 size higher."
3.0,Would not buy again. Does not fit face and sucks in with breath.
3.0,I wanted a thinner wallet to fit in back pocket. This one is a little too thick but a nice wallet.
3.0,MEH-Bought cheap...got cheap. Kinda tight but deforms quickly.
3.0,"Not as expected; material very thin shows every crease of your body , looks cheap , I can’t go out with it so I’m just wearing it at home"
3.0,"Look to be well made. Had to return them because the leg openings were comically, perhaps disproportionately small."
3.0,ordered a 3x more like a 1x not true to size
3.0,Like them but velcro pops open at the worst times.
3.0,It may be just the brand but I find they run small. I returned.
3.0,"Really like them, but def not sized right at all..im a big grl and when I order an XL or XXL I expect to be able to wear them without wondering if im going to find holes when I take them off!! Besides that, the pocket is functional and easy to use and the colors are great!!"
3.0,I am not happy with the earrings.  Very cheap looking
3.0,"Pretty disappointed with Nike on these. They're warm but very inflexible and pretty restrictive. The material doesn't have a lot of stretch and they don't wow me like the rest of the Nike pro products. Not the most flattering pattern either, fyi."
3.0,"I’m only rating 3 stars, I bought from them before and likes the size was 12g 12mm. This time I got 10g 8mm, they were to small for my ears and the ball was super small compared to my other. So my fault it didn’t work, but man those balls were small and tight."
3.0,"Had a buddy order same pair of gloves, noticed the pair I got was significantly less of quality overall. Still they were white gloves, no special markings."
3.0,"to big for regular faces , definitely big for the kids from 7-12 . also they are thin cloths ."
3.0,Nice hat for the money but thought it would be insulated better a bit big and clip that fastened is made of cheap plastic
3.0,Very long dress. Made modifications and it works.
3.0,Better quality packing cubes out there for the price.  Zippers are poor quality; care apart after one use.
3.0,"OK... So these don't look at all like the picture.  They are a shiney material, I was hoping for more of a cottony feel, but they aren't at all.  They are a bit short, sitting just at my waist.  And, the seam doesn't go straight down the sides.  It angles to the front for some reason... on everyone in the three pack.  I will be keeping them as undershirts, but not super impressed."
3.0,"Fabric is not to comfy, dress fits a tad bit small, but colors and print are cute"
3.0,Runs Small size up!
3.0,"These masks are great.  Double layer of cotton fabric, room to slide in a filter if you want or need one, adjustable ear loops.  They fit many face sizes and shapes without gaps or wrinkles. They are cotton so they don't smell weird.  Double layer filters twice as much! The only problem turned out to be kind of major.  When washed, these masks shrink significantly.  I thought ironing would fix it, but it wasn't enough.  My suggestion if you want to try these is to not only hand wash, but avoid the dryer.  I think i would have had better luck if I had hand washed, hang dried, followed by ironing.  The nice fit and reasonable price are worth another try."
3.0,"My SO seems to really like these. They're very comfortable & he appreciates the fact that he can wear them outside if he needs to. They're kind of loose. They also retain moisture like crazy so... wear socks with these puppies. Was kind of hoping that wouldn't be necessary, but I think that's my own fault. My SO stopped wearing them after a while. He would rather walk around wearing just socks now. 🤦 Last time I buy him house shoes."
3.0,Would have given it a 5 if they won more games this year!!
3.0,This product is everything it says EXCEPT it came extremely wrinkled and I cannot get the wrinkles out.  Highly disappointed.
3.0,"These are functional, but sound like garbage. Literally no bass. It’s like listening to music through a singing greeting card speaker. I bought them to wear with a motorcycle helmet so I can hear my environment, I think I’ll be returning these and sticking with my earbuds."
3.0,"Super cute colors and style, also very soft. However, the crotch area was way too big and the waist band very high. No matter how I tried to roll the waist band or resize it somehow, the fir was just bad."
3.0,"Nice. Love star trek. Love the pants, comfortable and fits well. However, after a few washes now and wearing it roughly every other week... the quality of the material starts to be apparent. In that there are a few little wholes here and there after some wear and tear but in fairness, I've only had this from roughly 2-3 months. I sitll love them and will probably wear them until the fall off."
3.0,It's not that durable and it's very expensive. Glad I got it for free. And btw it's cheaper at the uniform store for half the price
3.0,"I ordered these and while what I got is pretty, and I will give them to my spouse, the colors were NOT as pictured."
3.0,"Decent metals, plastic face so don’t think you’re getting something as nice as this piece looks"
3.0,They came apart after the third use. Had to glue them back together.
3.0,"Very nice shirt, and high quality but the sizes are WAY TOO SMALL!! I ordered a 2x and it was more like a medium. I ended up giving the shirt to my son and he LOVES IT!!"
3.0,Still pretty even though it’s fake opal and alot bigger than expected.
3.0,"The bra fits great, love the v-neck cut however the straps have a seam on them that is very uncomfortable to the point of being intolerable. I was able to wear inside out without the pads for a while but ultimately the straps just suck."
3.0,"I really like these boots, but they were too short"
3.0,"Really liked, but post broke off right away.<br />I contacted the Co. but got no response..."
3.0,The pants were soft and a suitable alternative to sweatpants $27.  Used the size chart and took my measurements.  purchased accordingly.  Too large.  supposed to have free returns.... only refunded $19.49....  what's up with that?
3.0,I can't use it because I can't get the little button into the little hole to fasten it....
3.0,Size 8 was to big for my niece who is clearly a size 8. Size down!
3.0,Small pads constantly fall out. Shoulder straps stretched out quickly.
3.0,"Love the idea for Bunco.  Guess I just got too excited and didn't read carefully enough.  I thought each charm had a dice with only one number rather than a different colored bead.  In my bunco group, there are enough colors that are similar that this won't solve the problem of knowing whose wine is whose."
3.0,I purchased 2 for gifts and was disappointed that instructions for use with the essential oils were not included. However I think my daughter and niece will like them.
3.0,Returned as it was thinner than I expected. Pretty basic packaging.
3.0,"Arrived on time, looks like the picture except not quite as nice quality."
3.0,It is cute. It is also ridiculously inconvenient to wear. I will probably wear it for some pictures but it’s somewhat unrealistic for a night out that includes dinner.
3.0,"I purchased this bag in gunmetal color. However, as others have mentioned, beware that the hang tag on the photo is not the same as the one on the bag itself. There is a discrepancy and I have made Amazon aware. The tag is leather and the embossed lettering is unreadable. See photo."
3.0,Weird birthstone colors
3.0,Great size and versatility. Material and joints are a bit loose near flimsy. I understand why - since the ultra compact nature of the glasses need the joints to be flexible. Sturdy enough once arms are fully deployed and on your face.
3.0,I wished they had XL I would have gotten it! Zipper to open is kind of cheap..Hope it lasts🤔
3.0,It’s cute but it’s really big. Unable to return too.
3.0,glasses and sometimes that the masked make my glasses fog up and it's okay to do but it's it's not good for people that wear glasses
3.0,The sizing is pretty off the mark. I'm 6'2&#34; 205lb with an athletic build and normally wear US size medium for the fitted look. I bought a Medium and long story short is you definitely should go two sizes up. I'm going to re-order in an XL to compare annd give another review after.<br /><br />The is pretty light/thin. Well made though.
3.0,"These are very pretty! Too bad one of the backs of the silver pair is upside down and I cannot get it down no matter how hard I try! Still wearable, but awkward."
3.0,The top is super cute but I ordered an XL (they sent an XXL I assume knowing that they run small) and its really like a Med. Runs really small. Too bad. I would have ordered a few more had it worked  out.
3.0,It said XL but it fit me ... I normally wear small (lol)
3.0,"It's a very nice hat, but I am not a fan of the elastic band ear-flaps.  They tend to ride up onto the ear, which can be a nuisance for some people.  Quality construction is good.  The elastic band is why I am only giving this a three star review."
3.0,They were pretty but I didn’t think I would have to glue them like I did
3.0,"These are just so-so.  They are silky and stretchy.  Although initially they seemed to fit perfectly, the don’t stay down and are constantly rolling up from the bottom."
3.0,This was nothing like I expected. Very very thin material that was kind of hard feeling. This one size fits all is VERY  small!  I wear 12-14 and it was too tight. Disappointed!
3.0,A little snug. Need to order at least two sizes bigger than your current sizes. Zipper is very cheap. Broke on 1st try to zip up
3.0,Material is VERY thin
3.0,The dress was pretty but way too small for my daughter (she's a size 6 and couldn't get it zipped)even though we ordered based on her measurements. It was bought for a dance so we had to go to plan B.
3.0,The multi colored earrings are super cute and right on trend! The red tassel earrings were quite a bit brighter and more orange hued than pictured which makes them look a bit cheap.
3.0,"First of all, these wings shipped VERY fast. I ordered them on the 20th and received them today so I would say kudos on that. The wings themselves though are just ok. They are a beautiful blue color that is opalescent, shimmery and catches the light nicely with hints of teal/green. The problem that I have is the wires that form the framework for them. They run through them like veins which is a nice effect. But the fabric is pretty much just thin fabric sticky on both sides and wraps around the coat hanger wires. In and of itself that's not a problem. But as soon as I removed it from the packaging I saw one wire was already poking out of the bottom. I was able to oogle it back and re-smoosh the fabric together. In the process of trying them on, another wire popped out of a top one. Cue the re-oogling and re-smooshing. IF the stickiness holds up and IF the wires stay in place these will be a decent set of wings given the fairly cheap price vs. other ones on the market.<br /><br />Other notes. They are not very large. They measure 35.5 inches across the top tips, 21 inches across the bottom tips and 14 from the top to bottom. My vision of them was as a bit larger since you can only see the top maybe third of the wings on top of your shoulders. But this size means you can walk through a door more easily. I think the huge wings out there would be a pain in the keester moving around a house.<br /><br />The straps holding them onto your arms are clear stretchy and adjustable, just like a clear bra strap would be.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not sure if I'll be keeping them. I'm going to take a look for an alternative out there and if I can't find anything I will keep these. If you're looking for a wear it once for Halloween type of thing these will probably work. If you're looking for longevity and being able to wear it multiple times you should probably upgrade to a nicer style."
3.0,"The ties are well made and feel soft. The dimensions are fine for current styles, but who picks the material?  The print is a ""half-tie"" in other words the tail half of the tie is made from a different material and pattern than the front part. That makes tying it more difficult, unless you want a multicolored knot. It, also, means you have less control over the length of your tie, which is a problem if you are tall. The striped tie has glittery thread sewn into the material. I do not want a glittery tie. It looks cheap. Matters of taste perhaps, but you cannot tell these things from the picture."
3.0,"The product was not super comfortable but I guess that’s what I get for the price point, they are good for public showers though."
3.0,On line the earrings look as though they had small beads circling the stones and it looked well defined.  With the actual earrings the details were less than crisp and precise. The stones look smaller on the earrings and the actual earrings are slightly over sized for my taste.
3.0,Made of thin material Bends easy
3.0,"These pants, while comfortable, live up to the adage ""you get what you pay for"": no pattern matching and pockets that add pounds. I'll probably wear these as lounge or weekend pants. The fit is good, though, as I'm 5'6"", 130 pounds or so (slim/athletic build) and they hit right at the ankle. I probably could have gotten a small for the waistline/hip area but I don't know if they'll shrink so medium was a safe choice. I wouldn't get another pair but will wear these some."
3.0,"Super cute dress. Material is nice. It fits tight and I got the large. I am 5""7 and 168. I'm a little more plump in the fupa area so it didn't look as great. But I will plan to wear it. Could have gone a size up"
3.0,"sizing runs small. I ordered mens large, they are more like smalls."
3.0,"Decent pants. Not as great as I expected after reading all the reviews though. Also, wish they were about an inch longer. Im 5 8' and 130 lbs and I ordered a medium. They fit well everywhere else."
3.0,"Just ok.  I have a hard time with wearing gold and silver jewelry as they tend to make my ears sore as I am allergic to nickel.  I thought these would work as they are stainless steel but they didn't.  Although they are beautiful, they just didn't work for my sensitive ears.  My ears have been pierced for 40 years so it is not a matter of newly pierced ears.  Again, they are really beautiful earrings."
3.0,"Slick..buy from Shein for $6-8, cut out the tag, forget it in the packaging, use the SAME SHIPPING BAG, resale for $18.99+tax & shipping.<br />Will not be doing business with this company again.<br />Shirt itself feels like a bathing suit & is very short."
3.0,"The picture shows it leaning, and there is nothing in the outer zippered area or in the front pockets. Put anything in there and it will immediately fall forward.  Due to its small size, the handle doesn't extend far enough to make it comfortable to pull on the rollers. Other than those issues, it holds quite a bit for its size and seems to be well constructed."
3.0,"Bought a 10-12, fits more like a 7-8. Worked for Halloween costume, and it served its purpose, but was hoping the fit would be true to size for longer wear and dress up play."
3.0,"Although these boots are correctly sized and waterproof, they are floppy. This means unlike higher quality boots, you can't just step into them, but must hold them open to put them on. I got them for my husband to put on when popping outside as he always slips on his work shoes (fastest to put on) and they get muddy. Given these are not easy-on I think he will still put his slip-on work shoes on and not use these. If you're looking for inexpensive rubber boots these still make work fine for you."
3.0,"Meh? They turned very quickly, but I guess for the price then it’s not as big of a deal. But if you want to wear them more than twice, don’t get them personally"
3.0,"This dress was cute but it was more dressy than the photos show. I expected the fabric and color to be lighter but it was more of a cocktail dress fabric and was a little too big on me. I ordered a small and it was a little bigger than expected. I am 5'4 and 130 pounds. Cute dress, but not what I was expecting."
3.0,The material seems thin and a little see through in the lighter colors. Cute dress but wish it was a better quality fabric.
3.0,"Did not finde any stamp on it, so i think is not silver, but nice earrings"
3.0,"I really like this dress. It's very comfortable and stylish and the pockets are great. Fair warning, however - the picture on Amazon makes the green dress look like it'll be a darker emerald green. It's actually more of a lighter grass green. I still liked it, but if you're hoping for dark green you will be disappointed."
3.0,The quality and everything is great. They just run very small. I wear a 10/12 and I ordered a 12. I probably need to go a size up when ordering 😔
3.0,"From what other reviews said, I thought I was going to at least get a decent quality wallet for a Christmas gift. However, that didn't really happen. It's a nice color, but it feels like cheap, almost plastic-y type of material. I don't think that this wallet will last more than a few months, if that.  The inside is a black mesh material that you find on the bottom of kids you couches and inside cheap bookbags. Getting a watch at a wholesale store probably would have yeilded me a better product. I'm highly unimpressed!"
3.0,I love the necklace but was not happy with the condition it arrived it.  I wanted to wear it immediately and wasn't able to as it took me quite some time to untangle the knotted mess it arrived it.
3.0,"Runs very small, rolls in the front if you have any sort of a pouch. If you have a tush, not so great on the coverage slops down."
3.0,"My daughter loves this character but the egg is not clear, it’s milky white. Definitely overpriced for what it is but that seems to be the price across the board for this kind of thing. She’s happy so that’s what matters."
3.0,"could have been smaller, but nice."
3.0,"I thought this style was a great alternative and the patterns on the scarf are so cute.  However, it is small, doesn't stay up and the material is so light-weight that when you breathe in either through your nose or mouth, it sucks in.  All in all a disappointment as a face covering.  Might work as a neck covering."
3.0,"Runs small, nice quality but I returned"
3.0,"I did end up returning this dress. I tried it on and it was too small for me and it also had some bad sewing with it. For some reason around the waist section of it it had strings coming out everywhere and was just in very bady shape so I did return it because it did not fit. Had it fit and just has the strings I would have just exchanged it but overall it was cute and it does look like in the picture just I think I may have gotten a bad one and the sizes to me seem a little smaller than what it says.<br />I did receive this item at a reduced price for the purpose of review, even thought i did return it, but these opinions and thoughts are my own and i hope that you do find them helpful when making a purchasing decision. Thank you so much for your time and have a great day."
3.0,They're OK.. Has the side pockets which are a must for me. But they are not tapered so they do not fit well below the knee. I kept them and wear them but probably wouldn't order again.
3.0,This item runs very small I ordered a bigger size and it still didn't fit but I have to say it's beautiful
3.0,"These were *anything but* opaque. These would have been perfect if they were so. However ,the fact that they are so sheer makes them completely useless for my purposes. It's a damn shame. I don't normally return purchases because I can usually put them to some use that makes it more cost efficient to just keep. But in this case, I think I'm going to return them, simply because now I have to make another purchase that's almost identical. Just disappointed:("
3.0,They were nice but i didn't like the way they looked on my ear
3.0,"Fabric is thin but soft. I am 6' at 176, curvy. I bought an XL, found too clingy for my curves and because the fabric is so thin, shows too much. If I pull the skirt up, less clingy but falls at my shin. At 6' this is not a maxi on me. I bought two and will return the on I did not wear. The other I wore, is ok to keep."
3.0,"It's not bad, though the clasp looks a lot cheaper than the pictures led me to believe. It's inconvenient to thread through belt loops, however.<br /><br />It doesn't look terrible when it's on, but the real strength of this product is the actual holding up of your trousers. So if being able to control how much  of the snugness comes from the elastic stretch vs. general length is important to you, I guess go for it.<br /><br />Otherwise, use a ratchet belts. They look better as a rule, are far easier to put on and take off, and are similarly priced."
3.0,This trousers weigh a ton. The legs are about  ten inches too wide as well as the length is too long
3.0,"I bought this for halloween, it fit well however the snaps for securing the yellow straps fell out and broke off within 2 hours of first putting it on. I was able to rig it for the rest of the night, but the snaps are poorly put on. I would keep some emergency safety pins on hand. Besides the straps, this is a very well made cosplay."
3.0,The dress and apron look adorable but it’s missing the blouse.
3.0,"It's so pretty in person, the fabric is heavy and a little shiny.  It's just small, if it had some stretch to the waist or something different I would have kept it.<br /><br />A beautiful skirt, and Anthropoligie has a skirt very much like this one and its $$$$ way more than this skirt."
3.0,"This was my 2nd pair..I loved my 1st pink pair so I got the blue. I find the new blue ones are totally different lenses. They are very light and I'm not sure if they are truly polarized. For the price I can't complain but as I have already bought a pair previously,  I find this pair not the same."
3.0,"To be honest i was expecting a better quality (a little bit more than 5 dollars can offer me) they rings where dirty so i had to clean them and one of the rings broke when i was trying to adjust it. Out of that, is a cool product for its price"
3.0,"I wear large tshirts, read reviews of this running small and ordered a 2x. It was still a little too small. I can wear it, but its definitely too small"
3.0,"So let me start by saying it is an adorable bathing suit but.. As said in other reviews it is a slight smaller then expected, l.o will definitely out grow it by winter ( few month away)<br />And its I dont know how to quite describe it but the chest area is loose, like its baggy around the chest. While the rest is fine. Also I find (although cute) the strap design flawed. It makes it difficult to adjust them because of where the frills are positioned on the straps."
3.0,"Nice fabric,, seems well made, but the short sleeves are too long for me.  I have a 38 inch sleeve length in a dress shirt, and these short sleeves hang below my elbows, which is annoying.  Note: I do have some long sleeve Tri-Mountain pocket polos and I like them very much - the sleeves also run long but it feels good in a long sleeve shirt."
3.0,"This was very cute, but the top comes as a scarf and is very confusing as to how to wrap it because it seems as though it's not long enough.. Sadly I returned it."
3.0,"The fabric is slick and weird.  The straps are super long but the skirt itself is really short.  Because of the slick fabric, the suspenders kept coming untied."
3.0,"I am 5'4, 130 lbs.. 34 D. This is a roomy on me, which is fine but it's a bit long. It hangs down to the bottom of my knee. I would prefer it were a little shorter but I will make it work."
3.0,"Not at all what I was expecting.. i was disappointed, love the color"
3.0,"Very nice, but not true to size even though I went up a size. it was a gift for my wife and she couldn’t use it because it was too small very disappointing!"
3.0,"The size runs narrow, and not boot that would hold up in the wet winter months of Seattle if worn daily.  The boots look nice but are not a name brand product."
3.0,Not at all a fan of the color. Afraid I’d cross the street and stop traffic in the whole city. I couldn’t imagine wearing this to work and not distracting everyone or giving them a migraine. The material and fit was decent but that color! Dayyymnnnn.
3.0,Loved the material<br />Hated that I was sent the wrong size and now my size is unavailable.
3.0,These hurt my ears since i cant adjust the clips on the back. Also you cant twist them really well.
3.0,"Love them, although I have yet to get one close while in my ear.  Glad there are multiple since I loose them every once in a while due to the fact that I am lame and cannot close them ."
3.0,Dress was cute until the zipper ended up busting.. quality was okay. Cute for a last minute dress.
3.0,"Does not look exactly as pictured: top two branches are not touching. There is a gap between the turquoise stones. Still really cute, but I wish that the stones were closer together."
3.0,"I read other reviews before purchase and ordered a size larger as a result. Sizes do run on the smaller side so I would suggest you order up as well. They work well for shower sandals as they don't hold much water and do dry pretty quickly as others have stated. My only compliant is that my left sandal has a small hole (not all the way through, but a manufacturing defect) which may hold a little bit of water itself. Probably could send it back to be replaced but I didn't think it was necessary and needed to use them right away. They work well for the cost."
3.0,And zipper doesn't work well can't even get it to go up :( but HAWEE customer service has been great and refunded my money.
3.0,"extremely cutee i love the fabric. i would have rated it a five but it fits somewhat small. Also, I do not wear it often because of the lettering in the back sounds insulting to me as if I'm calling myself cheap and I'm announcing it to the world."
3.0,Fits good but I ordered black and blue combo and the blue shirt shrunk alot more than the black one not to much of a big deal but just be aware it might happen.
3.0,the tail piece is only like 8-10 inches long
3.0,Enhh..
3.0,"they are cute, pretty cheap looking. clasp half way tight."
3.0,Great quality but was disappointed with its size. A bit too small. I should have paid attention to its dimensions.
3.0,"The Top was way too big, bottoms fit fine"
3.0,Came just as described but SHIPPING TAKES FOREVER!!!!!!
3.0,"I thought the skirt looked and sound like it was fuller, by the looks of the pictures ,and calling it a swing skirt dress, instead of the straight skirt like it is, but it’s nice that it’s lined and not see through,  alright for around the house."
3.0,The dress itself was beautiful and appeared well made. I’m a size 14 and an XXL fit everywhere except the bust area. I ended up getting it altered. But overall I’m still impressed!
3.0,Not the best design.  The ear holes pull down on my son's ears.  The design and color are perfect though.  I won't be purchasing this item again.
3.0,"My daughter is a size 10 so i bought these in 10-10.5 size and it still fits her a bit tight.  Also, this is definitely for wider feet and not slimmer one's.  I got the pink shoes with rainbow fish on them.  Unfortunately, i had to return it."
3.0,it was comfy but large around the body
3.0,"very tight, limited straps."
3.0,"Far too big for my face, but not terrible quality. You can see through the mirrored lenses from the outside, but they do provide some shade from the sun."
3.0,to small for a 7 year old.  Otherwise it’s good.
3.0,fits as expected but over small period of time it stretches.  served its purpose other than that
3.0,Top of the shirt fits true to size.  Bottom is huge!
3.0,The color is more of a marigold yellow than the bright yellow I thought it would be.
3.0,Loooved this dress when I got it and for all the weeks I wore it. It's so flowy and cute and I love the color. But I threw it in the dryer without thinking and it shrunk so it's at my local Goodwill now. Don't dry this dress!!
3.0,Doesn't seem polarized.  😕<br />Had to order a different pair.
3.0,"These shirts are really small. My boyfriend is really fit and lean so I got a medium; but he is also 6'2 so the sleeves were too short. a larger size would have been wayyy too wide on him though.<br /><br />luckily, it fits me pretty well, so I've been wearing it. I cant get it to button over my chest though, so I wouldn't recommend for other ladies either."
3.0,"Normal size is M or L (US) but in this I had to get a 4x!!! But beside that the material is cheap but is lined, but I have the feeling when I wash it, it will be done for, nice color thought."
3.0,Material is shiny polyester but that wasn't a deal breaker. My issue with the dress is that the bust seam is open. From the waist cinch up the bust is open. I used two safety pins and it didn't look awful but the material definitely pulls on the pins because there's no structure.
3.0,"I am not crazy about this watch.  The band is way to thick and the dial is supposed to look like an antique map.  It doesn’t look like an antique anything.  Would have sent it back, but since it was inexpensive, it wasn’t worth the trouble."
3.0,"The design part does not sit properly on the ring. One side is higher off the ring than the other. Also, the prongs holding the stone make it look cheap. I worried about that when I placed the order, but decided to give it a try."
3.0,"Has ink run on the light color area, dont have time to process the return yet.  The dress also too large."
3.0,One fell apart before I even got to use it.
3.0,Too long and too big. I am 5ft and 95lbs for reference. It makes me look wide and boxy...
3.0,Great product but it came with a defect. The top of the mask was torn and the thread began to unravel.
3.0,"I thought these were ok, they make everything beige. I was planning to live with it until my 11 year old came in and said they make me orange like Trump. I looked in the mirror and she is correct. I will have to remember to never wear these on video calls or in public. Although I may be so disturbed now by the Jaundice look that I just cannot."
3.0,"My husband couldn't get these on...1, because they seemed smaller than size and 2, because the structure is very wobbly. I returned"
3.0,they are just ok
3.0,"Again, maybe it's me, maybe the shorts.  I use these as sleeping-shorts (i.e., bottom half of pajama) because they LITERALLY tend to fall off when walking.  Amusing.  No kidding!"
3.0,They didn't have any arch support and the side by the baby toe pinched it.  I returned for a pair with more support.
3.0,"It's a beautiful locket however, the clasp does not stay closed. It constantly falls open"
3.0,"This item was a good fit, but I felt it looked very matronly on. I didnt feel ""good"" in it."
3.0,Not bad for price and the kids love it
3.0,"I purchased this for my 6 year old son as he prefers the bandana style masks over the ones over the ears.  The concept of built in filters I thought were genius and extra measure of safety.  However, upon reading the reviews and receiving the masks I have to say they are very loose fitting.  Almost so my child could not wear it through the 2 hours he had of school as it was sliding off."
3.0,"I like it wears well with leggings, slim pants etc."
3.0,Length is good but this sandal runs wide.  It does adjust in all straps but if your foot is slightly narrow will still be too wide.  It also has an aggressive arch support so is excellent if you need a lot of support.  I found it was too much for me.<br />Otherwise it’s attractive and well made.
3.0,Color is no Coral it is peach...but they were good about my returns. Thanks.
3.0,The red tie is not as red as in the photo. It’s more of a light red or pinkish color.
3.0,"This was not nearly as flattering as I would have hoped. I thought the skirt aspect would hide some of my upper thigh area, however the bottom of your butt will still show. Also, the ruching was not as flattering on my belly as I hoped. Basically, I just assumed this would cover up my trouble spots but I think it is meant more for people who have less trouble spots or who aren't as insecure about them as I am."
3.0,I ordered an XXL but it is a bit too loose. I love the fabric and thong bottom. Will be exchanging for an XL
3.0,EXTREMELY cute and stylish! Unfortunately mine came extremely bent (even though it arrived in a box). My boyfriend bent it into shape so it looks just like new but definitely not happy about it arriving so messed up.
3.0,"these are cute shorts for sleeping especially in hot weather. They are light. The color is not rose: mine were a bright, almost hot pink with grey lace. Still cute but definitely not rose. They have a drawstring waist and are light and comfortable. Machine wash but do not tumble dry. I lin dried and they were fine. They run small, are very short and rather sheer. I wouldn't wear them out in public. good for sleeping though."
3.0,I'm  size 10 and bought a large.  But it's too tight everywhere.  Will be exchanging for next size up.
3.0,Got this for my son for Halloween. He is slightly less than average height and weight for 10. He says the shoulders are very tight but the rest is comfortable.
3.0,"Cute PJs just like in the picture, fits as expected. The material is very thin, The quality is not great , after one wash the strings on the shorts fell off. No , not came out , fell off , they’re not appear to be attached to anything."
3.0,Gloves fit I have long fingers. But the Smell of old warehouse is bad.
3.0,Numbers way to small to read for person
3.0,"This is a nice little purse, well made.  But they sent it with no strap, so I had to return it.  I noticed another person had the same problem, so as much as I like this purse and was perfect for what I wanted, I don't dare buy it again."
3.0,The tag was on the outside of the skirt. It was way too long.
3.0,Runs large for my small wrist
3.0,Returned because it was not the size that I needed
3.0,Cute but low riding
3.0,"Nice color, Size Runs Small...go up 2 sizes"
3.0,Not bad hat just was extremely beside myself over there handling when it came to shipping
3.0,I returned them because I thought they were sweat pants.
3.0,Product ok but small
3.0,Size of half of a woman's pinkie. So disappointed.
3.0,"First of all, it works, but it's almost like it has to learn where the radio tower is before it can set the time -- took several days before it began to receive a strong signal.<br /><br />According to the mileage calculator at:<br />[...]<br />I'm about 1200 miles from the transmitter as the crow flies. This could have been sun spots; who knows?  After ""training"" the watch has updated every night as per claims.<br /><br />It's a BIG watch.  It doesn't look too big in the mirror, but it looks big to me when I look down.  Also, my shirt cuffs won't pass over it.<br /><br />If you have ever worked on your car with a digital watch on, you will know why the push buttons are protected on this watch.  There is absolutely no way you can press a button accidentally.  There is almost no way you can press one intentionally, as well.  Whoever designed this watch had tiny fingers.  I suspect that part of the klutziness is because the buttons protect a water proof seal in order to meet the depth rating claimed.<br /><br />I keep a specially shaped thumb nail handy in case I want to push a button to find out something in addition to the time and date.  This is unfortunate because the watch is full of special functions that could be useful if one could get at them easier. The functions are in reverse order of how I would use them.  First comes time zone, then stored times, followed by alarms, then the timer.  You can't use most of these without the manual, so the difficulty of pushing the buttons is almost irrelevant.<br /><br />The blue color is a nice touch.  The strap and case are what I would call ""midnight blue"" with just hints of powder blue around the silver colored bezel. The blue lends some class to a plastic covered watch, in my opinion.<br /><br />A big plus is that the digital display is easy to read without reading glasses because of the BIG numbers.  For this reason alone, I will keep it."
3.0,"Cute dress, received several compliments. The racer back style is pretty deep and does show a lot of my bra. I wore a small cardigan over it for work. The material is not as thick as I would have liked and is almost see through. Cute dress and served it's purpose but I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,O really like these its my third package.
3.0,Its ok. My daughter loves it because of the design. But then again we haven't tested it for a full day dance event worth of stuff. So that will be tested next week. It just a was smaller than expected and overall there wasn't very many Dance bags or bags that say dance in a decent size.  I rolled the dice on this one cause we liked the design the only other one i would of picked over this one was 2 in smaller glad i didn't get that one.
3.0,These are nice. They were cheap. Next time I will spend a bit mire & get better quality. The inside material ripped within a couple times wearing them. Otherwise they were fine.
3.0,"It's cute, however upon taking it out of the package many of the flowers and tool came unattached. Luckily I'm confident w a glue gun"
3.0,for the price is ok looks cheap a little too shiny but in the night time is a go
3.0,The chapstick holder and hand sanitizer holder both could not hold up. The seems on both started to come undone with in 2 weeks.
3.0,"Decent quality but a bit more fitted than I would like. Size up if you want to layer t-shirt underneath.  The color and pattern is rather muted, much less vibrant than the photo enhanced picture.  Returned and went with another brand."
3.0,Husband loves Slipknot and bought these for my husband for his birthday. They came in the mail and my husband put on the gloves and they ripped. I bought the size he told me and they did not last long. If you do buy them go up one size.
3.0,"I purchased a pair of these & loved them! they lasted about 2 months until one of the arms broke off, but I liked them so much for the price that I bought a second pair but that one only lasted me about 2 weeks before the same thing happened."
3.0,Loose everywhere except the chest. I'd have to add a couple panels to make it work :( so cute though.
3.0,Top fit good
3.0,"The seller has asked to review this product a few days after receiving it, so here goes.  The three-star indication is solely because one can't post any review in Amazon without selecting something.  The usual problem with this type of product is its propensity to fall apart within 3-4 months after initial use.  So, the first test will come about that time.  I will put in a review at 3-4 months, and then again at 6-7 months, and then again at a year or so.  Most of them fall totally apart after only a year of use.  In my opinion, any decent product would last for five or so years.  We'll see."
3.0,The pendants are cute and seem good quality but I only received 50 pieces and a few were damaged so I couldn't use them.
3.0,It's cute but a little small from the arms so my baby doesn't really like it .! Material wise it's ok
3.0,Shipping took forever I ordered like 5 shirts from amazon this was the first one I picked and the last one to arrive.. size wise I'm not sure it's accurate but I can still wear it. I'm a true blue M/L and this fits like a M when I ordered a Large.. also I can't tell if the logo is crooked or if the tank to it's self is sewn funky.. cheap shirt = cheap shirt. CBGB's was an awesome place and I wish I had got an authentic t in the 90's
3.0,"I bought this for my granddaughter. She absolutely loves it. The only thing is one of the grommets wasn't in correctly where the laces are where it ties in the front and had to be repaired. You can't beat the price. It took a while to get it after ordering. I believe it came from China, hence the delay in shipping. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and most importantly, my granddaughter is happy."
3.0,"nice print,  but the stitching and hem finish look cheap. too expensive for that poor level of finish, with loose threads."
3.0,Not that it’s too small or too large but they just want to ride down your backside. I don’t think my coworkers want to see my rear end playing peek a boo. Otherwise they’re comfortable and the fit may just be because I have kind of flat booty
3.0,Only recieved 2 pairs instead of three. The two pairs I did get are really pretty. I have sensitive ears and these have not caused any problems.
3.0,"It is difficult to rate this item because, while the hat is adorable, the portion that is straw started to unravel shortly after I tried it on.  I glued what was left of the brim to stop it from unraveling and I will use it at the beach.  It is still adorable even with only have the brim.  However, if I didn't like it so much I would have sent it back because of the shoddy way it was made."
3.0,It look a little cheap but my daughter loves it
3.0,"The material feels great, but it was very big and there was a slight puffing of the sleaves at the hemline."
3.0,Smell like chemicals even after weeks of use.
3.0,"Didn't fit my 5 yr olds eyes very well, and gets slimy in the initial times in the pool"
3.0,OK so this belt is beautiful but for the price it needs to be in excellent conditions which unfortunately my belt wasn't. All 4 corner sides was ripping off I'll provide picture so you see what I'm talking about. I will oder another one because it looked amazing but if the second one comes with the same imperfection I will return and will never order one again. I boughten cheaper belts that are not falling apart except that when it comes to the rhinestones this belt is on point. They look amazing and looks expensive but the belt itself needs improvement.
3.0,There was a bow in the front but not on the back of the dress
3.0,"These are not really purple, but hot pink.  If you really want purple-don't order these!"
3.0,Loved that I could choose which mask but some of the ribbons just came off in my hand while taking them out of the package.
3.0,"These shows are super cute but wayyyy too big. The sizing is definitely off. My daughter has wide feet for her age bracket (12-18 months, size 4) and this is *still* a bit big even after putting on thick socks or tights. This show is soft soled and looks fairly comfy. The color of the suede is a lovely vibrant blue. I really wish the sizing wasn't off, but hopefully she'll grow into it."
3.0,"It's ok - if the only use is to sweat. If you wear it running or working out, it will ride up. It wasn't worth the hassle to keep pulling it down/up. I used it once."
3.0,"I like it but even as an adjustable it is small.  I ordered it for my boyfriend and it is too small for a mans wrist.  It does fit mine, so I will wear it, but now searching for one for a man."
3.0,Nicely made but it would take 2 of them to make a 2x and more orange than coral.  I returned it.
3.0,I love the shirts with pockets but I was disappointed when I saw the color was actually purple.....on Amazon it says it's blue.  It definitely isn't blue at all.
3.0,"The chest area seemed a bit large. My friend kept having to pull up, but the rest of the top fit well around the stomach area."
3.0,"The good and bad news is that this shirt is extremely lightweight. It's not transparent, but extremely thin and feels like it will wear through after 6-9 months of use, even if you use the ""delicate"" cycle on your machine. The good news is it's comfortable to wear on walks here in hot Georgia; I just don't think it will last long. It's also loose but a little clingy, so when I wear it I get horizontal sweat lines where it occasionally catches on my muffin top (sigh)"
3.0,Pretty but the stones fall out of the setting.
3.0,Fits well. Gave it a 3 star due to flowers are really thick and hard. Wrinkles from shipment have not come out of the flowers even after washing multiple times. Would not recommend drying this because can tell flowers will crack and peel like the old iron on appliqués.
3.0,This ear cuff is really tiny! I've already misplaced it since purchasing it. It's a cute option if you wanna avoid piercing your lobes
3.0,"Its very cute, however runs big."
3.0,They were a bit smaller than I thought they would be based on the model but I still like them.
3.0,Very pretty. I still have a few pounds to go.
3.0,"It looks ok, but the metal is very bright therefor obviously an inexpensive piece."
3.0,I wanted this dress so bad but it was too small. I waited until the last day to return it hoping I could get it altered. I could have returned and got a bigger size but even a seamtress said it would have still been to short. I tried it on and fell in love but all my lady bits would be out once I moved. I have lost weight since I bought but still it's too short. The back of the dress was at the bottom of my behind and I don't have the biggest one. But I love the way the back fit. That's my favorite part the way its cut and you can tie it differently. Also the print. It's so pretty I really wish it wasn't as short. You’d probably have to wear shorts under it. Besides that I’d would advise other to buy. I think it's made for short ladies. I'm 5'8.
3.0,"I got this kimono for my wife, size S, she is usually a size M but she wanted it a little less loose, but this one still looks too big for her even though she ordered it small. The material and design, unfortunately, were not what she wanted either. In her opinion, it seems like a work apron, 3 stars, it really doesn't look like how it does in the listing photo and the sizing is way off"
3.0,"Kind of cheap looking.  Of course, it was an inexpensive watch band.<br />\"
3.0,I wore these once and was so excited to wear again.  I washed in delicate and hung too dry.  When I write then the next day and saw they were ripped. So upset!
3.0,"I look like an italian porn producer when i wore these. Definitely not sunglasses, more like fake glasses for my 20/20 vision. I never wear them cause i feel dumb Af wearing fake glasses."
3.0,I bought this because I am a huge fan of assassin creed I got the large and it didn't fit on any of my fingers I wish there was a XL
3.0,"The pendant is fine. It fits my standard-sizez snap charms, though I wonder how long it will be before the metal turns colors. The chain, on the other hand, is rough and scratchy."
3.0,"The sleeves were tight, the chest area loose, and the rest of the dress fit like a glove. Returned it. There was 2 small holes on the back area where the main of the material meets the edge. It was like it missed the connecting area when it was sewn. If I didn't sew myself, and didn't look for missed stitching, I wouldn't have noticed. You couldn't see it when I put the dress on."
3.0,"If you don’t mind your daughter wearing belly shirts, you will love it. I was not expecting the top to be like what the teenagers are wearing 😖"
3.0,"Way larger than expected, returned them....but they WERE very pretty"
3.0,Love it ! Just wish the buttons were bigger so my mask won’t snag of.
3.0,cute for a lil girl.
3.0,Great material! Runs small
3.0,"It is cute, but runs small. Also always must wear something under it, as the fabric is too light and being white is see-through.<br />As an additional comment I would love if these people understood that we need pockets!"
3.0,I really wanted to like these. They are super cute and comfy but the band doesn’t lay flat. If it had one more little thing holding it down it’d be a 5 star band. It just has one and it doesn’t stay flush. It needs a little thing close to the clasp if that makes sense.
3.0,Both sleeves say Half COLD other than that good quality
3.0,cute for the price. buy your own chain because mine was cheap and broke immediately.
3.0,"Really like the earrings, but posts infects my earlobe every time I wear them."
3.0,"I thought getting the XL it would fit just right but it looks like a nightgown :( it’s a very cute style so I’m hoping that when I wash it, it will shrink and look how I expected."
3.0,The pants are fine I guess. I do like how the waist is high. I was hoping the length was going to be more like the picture though. I’m 5’4” and got a size 11. They aren’t as long as I like and after washing twice the bottom hems are starting to roll up. I tried ironing but nothing is working to get them back down. They hardly have any stretch and the fit is just not that comfortable but overall for the price I guess they are fine if your looking for a cheap pant.
3.0,For a 3x it’s a snug fit around the middle but the sleeves are just perfect length
3.0,Red is made well according to my wife and the green is made with substandard material.
3.0,Doesn't fit like it shows in the picture - would have liked it to be more form fitting at the waist. I ultimately ended up returning it.
3.0,Was disappointed in the way this looks. The details do not show up in the pic so I was surprised when I got it. It's comfy so I'm gonna keep it but only to wear inside my home. Where I can be ugly in peace.
3.0,It’s cute but very small
3.0,"Pretty, but made out of cheap materials. Hope it survives."
3.0,"This wallet looks cheapish but it has many organized areas, if I had not  got the wrong color I may have kept it."
3.0,"these are super comfy but def not shapewear im 155 and purchased the small its not tight at all but they are good shorts to wear under dresses just not shapewear. maybe if they had an xs id feel some sort of compression? idk but again, theyre comfy so ill keep em"
3.0,"This fits fine in the chest but it's so long that it covers my butt. And I'm 5'8&#34;, so I'm not extremely short. I think I'd have to be at least 6'2&#34; for this to fit properly. Unfortunately, I've shopped and shopped in many stores, and every full-zip hoodie I've tried on has been too long, too, so I decided to keep this. I mostly only wear it around the house, for extra warmth in the colder months."
3.0,"I ordered a size too big but it's great for around the house, the red isn't really red it's more of a coral."
3.0,"Shawl is very pretty,  just wish it was a little softer, .."
3.0,Sized up on this and still fits to small. but love the print and color material seems great.
3.0,"it looks okay, so I kept it"
3.0,"To be fair, I kind of hate my watch. This may be an issue with the watch design, or it may be an issue with true compatibility of this band to this watch. As you can see in my photos, the hardware on the band will not allow the band/watch to sit flush on my wrist. There is not enough clearance between the band hardware the the connection at the watch to allow movement of the band hardware.... If that makes sense. If I were to force it, something would bend/break. I supposed I might be able to grind down the watch band hardware a little so that it can clear that little design angle on my watch, but not sure I want to try that and risk not being able to return it if it doesn't help. The band itself is comfortable though and the jacquard pattern is nice."
3.0,"Super cute! The bottom fits perfectly, but the top is pretty big. To long of straps and more wide."
3.0,Fits a size small
3.0,These hurt my feet and I added half a size!
3.0,"Not best quality, but what I would expect for price. One pair had no nose piece."
3.0,"I'm 5'2"" and the shirt is really long and not flattering."
3.0,Well I would have given a 5 star but these turned color pretty fast especially if you plan on swimming with them on
3.0,Nice shirts but seams were a little iffy. They were a bit small also
3.0,"These fit as expected and are comfortable, but they're see through."
3.0,"I got an XL, my norm size. My only issues was where the waist line sat: if placed low like on model it looks stupid with no extra fabric, or it just sits higher on ur waist, not to high so it may work for some ppl- it made me look fatter than other clothes do so that's an automatic no-no for me. The neckline has a fru-fru thing around it too. Like yuk! But other than that the quality seems good and workman ship looks better than many others on amazon"
3.0,"They are cute, a little cheaply made looking but then again look at the price... still like them though!"
3.0,The shoes seem decent in quality however they are very large for the size I ordered. I wear a mens 8.5 and that’s what I ordered. They are really long and wide. It would probably be best to order a full size smaller than what you wear. Other than the sizing they seem fine relatively comfortable and of decent quality.
3.0,"I was really disappointed that despite checking the size chart and ordering the appropriate size for my measurements, this swim skirt was still too small.<br /><br />The thing is, is that it's just not made for plus sizes despite those plus sizes being available. The waist is much too low to be comfortable for someone who is not thin.<br /><br />The material is very soft and the length of the skirt is perfect. It's a very cute skirt but unfortunately I can't wear it. I think this would be fine to order if you are a smaller size or don't mind your stomach hanging over the waistband :/<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,It says it able to be shaped but it only shapes so much and I have very tiny toes and feet. It keeps turning on my toe so after 8-10 hours standing at work it starts to get a little irritating ... it does look exactly as pictured 🙂
3.0,no color in the arrows as shows on website. Just black and white
3.0,"I actually liked this dress a lot.  I am 5'11 and it was an appropriate length to wear to work.  The reason I gave it 3 stars was because those pleats would be impossible to keep up with.  I would have had to have it dry cleaned before I even wore it to get the pleats looking nice.  So I returned it, the fuss is not worth the dress"
3.0,"The material is thin, quality seems cheap, and it's somewhat short compared to what I expected from the pictures.  I think I ordered too big of a size (got an xl, I'm 5ft 5in, 165 lbs, 38D), the width is huge.  I wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,Half of the plastic ones have split kinda disappointing
3.0,"I like the size, the spaciousness....but the strap was not long enough for me."
3.0,Not really impressed.
3.0,Not as shown on the picture
3.0,Nice little dress just be aware VERY VERY thin.  Need a full slip under Cap sleeves a bit tight because there is a band at the end of sleeve. Not what I expected but not horrible.
3.0,"Just received these today,  I did read reviews prior to purchasing and chose to purchase anyway but pants were only $11 so you get what you pay for .  The pattern is definitely not the same as pictured and material is cheap .  I am normally an extra small or small but I ordered a medium based on the size chart in the listing and the medium fits perfectly.  I knew the pants would not be high-quality because of the price but I was hoping the pattern would be the same. I will keep them to wear around the house but probably won't wear these out because of quality and pattern."
3.0,"It’s cotton material cheap looking,"
3.0,Runs small. I like the pants but the top is small
3.0,"Nice material, not heavy or thick but still nice quality, but the overall shape of the dress is very unflattering if you are short-waisted like me. I'm 5'5, and generally wear between a 14 and 16 in dresses. I have a larger bustline, smaller waist and rounded hips and tummy, so a pretty regular hourglass shape. The waist is bunchy and hits between my bust and natural waist and makes me look dumpy. I'm sure a long-waisted woman could pull it off but for my body type, I need a more defined waist. And the pockets add to the hip area so if you're already curvy, they just add bulk to the lower body. A nice dress, just not for me."
3.0,"Complete disappointment there has been no messages back after letting the know I got a defect in my hat a spot that's sticks out like a sore thumb I'll never wear it in public I want a replacent but never heard anything back so it's going in the garbage if I don't hear back on next 30 days, the biggest waste of money yet looks like a quarter sized spot that's alot darker than the white it sticks out badly"
3.0,"Very comfortable and light tank top, just wish they were made with better quality.  They all started to rip and come apart after the fist wash.  One had the hemline around the arm completely separate and ruin before I could wear it."
3.0,"The fit was great for my extremely small wrist, but unfortunately it broke rather easily."
3.0,"This dress is gorgeous, but there are a few complaints I have. First of all, it's missing a button on the back- this is a complaint I've seen with almost everyone who bought it. Secondly- it's more than a little see through. Don't buy it if you don't have or don't plan on getting a slip. It's true to size everywhere but the chest for me. I am a DDD and I usually buy medium tops. Go a size up or it will absolutely smush you if you have a larger chest. And lastly, I didn't like that the flowers on the shoulders were so flimsy. It's not that they come off, but they're not sewn down all the way. If you don't constantly push them down whenever there's a gust of wind or you most your arm a certain way it just looks weird. Still, I like the color and style. I'll be keeping it and attaching my own button."
3.0,Very nice. But it came with a hole on its pocket and a hole on the crotch area. But my aunt fixed it.
3.0,No where in the description did I see that this shirt has to be dry cleaned. I live in a very small town where we have to send dry cleaning out. It takes a long time and is expensive. Pretty bummed about it. The quality and fit are ok.
3.0,"This is a cute top, it’s weird that the zipper up top isn’t an actual functioning zipper, it’s soft as well but it runs very small. I ordered the XXL for my 10 year old who is a bit taller than average  but not a lot, this barely hits below her waist band. We will return it because it’s just too short."
3.0,This is a good buy and I would buy another one. It fits comfortably and has good support.
3.0,honestly doesn't hang on the body in a flattering way.. probably a nice maternity dress though!
3.0,Letters are very small and the u looks more like a scrunched up sideways s. Pretty disappointed
3.0,Meh. Basic caveman outfit. Pants too large. Package DOES NOT include inflatable club despite product description specifically mentioning as included. Not worth the price but I will keep it to use a scraps and pieces for a more tailored caveman costume using other items already in my costuming collection.
3.0,Nice skirt but way too small.
3.0,The pendent looks of poor quality but overall ok for the price.
3.0,The fit is a little small but nice glasses.
3.0,It is soft and cute but I had to order a size smaller for the body suit to fit but then the skirt was to small.
3.0,"That rose is BIG. Like twice the size of a silver dollar at least, it covers most of the palm of your hand. It's not real heavy but seems ok. I am not in love with it. It was intended as a gift but I am having second thoughts. The price was fair for what I got. I feel like I could have found this in a discount store on the markdown rack. It should be heavier."
3.0,"This was a gift, so I'm not sure how they fit"
3.0,"Wife is pleaesed with the dress, seems like its good quality it was a bit bigger than expected. She doesn't mind because she said she'll just wear it throughout the pregnancy."
3.0,Only 3 T-Shirts in the package instead of 4 T-shirt
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress right out of the package. The fabric is a soft stretchy jersey knit in an emerald green color that is great for fall and the holidays. The length is great and I feel like it fits true to size.  Unfortunately on one side there is a darn zipper right up to under your armpit that buckles when you move.  Why oh why did you guys add a zipper to a stretchy dress? Seriously so much extra work and in my opinion, ruined the dress.  I put it on and couldn't figure out why one side was fitting weird and poking me. I couldn't believe when I found a zipper. Also cut is a lot lower in the front than on the model but that can be fixed with a cami underneath."
3.0,Good material and very loose but way bigger than expected.
3.0,It is an ok product for working hours.
3.0,I bought this kids sunglasses to match the adult version of it (same brand/vendor) for my wedding party. The pink is completely different than the adult vertion. This is more of a neon pepto bismol color while the adult version is more of a pastel pepto bismol. I’m keeping them because I’m sure the girls will love them regardless and they seem like good quality.
3.0,I bought this product specifically because they were described as low rise waist line. They are in fact very high rise waisted.
3.0,A bit too long and puffy
3.0,It’s very thin
3.0,"The dress looks exactly as expected and fits perfectly. The color is accurate as well, however I am just not excited about this dress. I like to feel good in clothes that I wear.  The fabric is a bit thin for a bodycon style. You need a great figure and undergarments to wear this dress with confidence. Usually the fabric for these dresses is a bit thicker. A couple of important things I learned after one wash and wear, after washing there is some striping in the fabric that doesn't show in the photos. There is some pilling after one wash, hang dry and the fabric snags very easily. I give the dress three stars for fit, cut, and accuracy of color, but I'd recommend hand wash and dry, and don't use for work or every day wear.  I'd say this is a fragile and delicate dress."
3.0,It’s a cute color and comfortable but my sweater zipper does not work it rolls down and opens when I try to zip it up I think my zipper is defective
3.0,Nice curved temple with glass too dark for function and only good for fashion. Luckily the temples did fit another pair on hand.
3.0,"I love this cute shirt. Although it runs small but it's stretchy somewhat and you can make do if you didn't order up, like myself. I wish I did...I would wear it more."
3.0,"This shirt would have earned 5 stars if it had been true to size.  However, I had to return it because it was soooooooo small!  The seller was easy to work with.  I sent it back, they paid the postage and gave me a full refund."
3.0,Daughter skin reacted badly to this earring. Plus it was not as striking.
3.0,Doesn't hold up after washing them. The vendor strap is poorly made<br />Have a back up ready if your child wears these often
3.0,"As other reviewers have noted, this dress is made from fabric that does not stretch at ALL and isn't really made to fit the average body. I went a size up because I wanted a looser fit, but the chest area was gaping open under the arms (as, again, other reviewers have noted). It's a fine dress for a costume (if you can sew to fix the chest area) but not really nice enough quality for anything else. I ended up returning it."
3.0,i would order one size bigger than you normally wear. i would order another one again. really comfy plus pockets are awesome. its a nice summer dress.
3.0,Bow fell off the pin immediately.
3.0,"Cut is cute, really like the pockets. Fabric is very cheap.  The fabric is a bit shiny and too thin for my taste."
3.0,based on the reviews we knew it ran small so we ordered a size up and it was still too small.
3.0,The quality is slightly lower than expected. But will still make for a nice Father's Day gift!  Super cute without being too cute for the man I bought it for.
3.0,"The clip is great, but the ring its too thick and doesn't move well."
3.0,It would be nice but it runs small
3.0,"I ordered this belt in a size small (I wear a size 27 pant).  The belt appears well-made and looks stylish.  It's packed and shipped in such a way that damage received during shipping is virtually impossible.  Unfortunately, the size small was so large on me I'd have to bore more holes into it to make it fit.  I wish West Leathers made an XS; I ended up returning it."
3.0,"Super comfortable and makes for a good slimmer, BUT the waist definitely rolls down when you're sitting. Creates a belly roll above the rolled down waist. I'm a size 10/12 in dresses and pants (shop at H&M mostly if that helps for size reference) so I bought a L/XL for good measure. These would be more comfortable with a boy short cut too."
3.0,"I got size small, and they were huge. The bottom layer fit like basketball shorts, and they were just loose and baggy all over.<br />Otherwise, they seemed like they’d be pretty good for the price."
3.0,"Not my favorite. They're good if you're not sleeping in them. The fabric is a tad plasticy. Fit was good. I'm 5""4 and 120, and got a medium."
3.0,"Again quick to come, but way too long I thought they were 3cm, and only gold plated it would be nice if real gold was offered as well"
3.0,"These are super cute, but were a little big for my 11.5 month old (he has big puffy feet so I thought they would fit even though he wasn't of the age designated). We will have to wait a month or so for him to be able to wear them because when he walks in them, they twist, turn and bunch."
3.0,"The quality wasn't all that great and the style wasn't perfect for me, but since my need for a black dress wasn't very high I'll keep it until I can do better."
3.0,Quality isnt great
3.0,Liked the outfit it fit well but faded a little after first wash
3.0,Don't fit right like they were made to small.
3.0,Loved the color and loved the fit around my body. Definitely would have liked it to be longer as it came above my ankle bone (I'm 5'8). The one thing that turned me off was the sheerness - I had the purple gradient color but the white part revealed a birthmark I unfortunately have on my backside. I may think about getting a different color but this one's going back for now.
3.0,"Deliver on time,  great priduct"
3.0,These aren't 100% cotton. Bought them to tie dye and it immediately rinsed out....not bad socks just not cotton as advertised.
3.0,I was a bit let down because I didn't read closely enough.  My fault completely.  I did think it was 2 capes not a reversible cape. So I set this aside until I can buy another.  The quality is good boys loved masks and bracelets and once I get a second cape I'm sure they will love it. Just always read complete description.
3.0,The skirt is entirely too long. I'm not sure I want to keep it
3.0,Top fit but pants didnt other than that the outfit wouldve been cute
3.0,"Okay these are my first pair of cat paw stockings and yes they have some flaws, they're not for thick thighs but for what they are I think they're decent. They're still really cute! The paw pads do not squish unlike the actual stockings these are modeled after but I don't really mind that. They're not uncomfortable at all to walk on. I do appreciate the silicone on the inside as well to keep them up."
3.0,The cup size on this was too small.
3.0,This slipper just wasn't right for me.  It was tight and there wasn't much cushion.  It felt more like a shoe.
3.0,It’s great if you want to put a Fitbit in your pocket but the magnet isn’t strong enough to keep it on a pocket outside or on the waste of a pair of pants. It’ll flip right off so be careful.  Also if you keep anything metal in your pockets it will stick to that item and when you pull that out you risk losing your Fitbit.
3.0,"I really wanted these glasses, but one of the lens will not stay up all the way."
3.0,Looked like embroidered dragon it is not. So cheap looking got rid of it.
3.0,Great for YouTube clips
3.0,Tight through the seat and upper thigh. Also from the waist to the crotch feels short.  Not roomy. Range of motion is restricted.  Running in these is out of the question. Waist itself is too big and has a tendency of slipping down. I think it’s the nylon in the pants. Have to pull up and re-tie. Such a strange fit.  I own other Under Armour pants and they fit well for my curvy figure.  Kuhl Flex Free pants fit and feel better for an active plus size pant.  I don’t recommend these.
3.0,"The dress itself is nice: decent material, good cut/fit and nice color. However, even after 3 washes, it has a smell. It's odd because I cannot say exactly what it smells like, but it isn't pleasant."
3.0,I give this a 3 star it came in on time the color and material was exactly as expected but unfortunately it was way to small for my self and even my 14 year old daughter who I bought it for. I was able to return no issues.
3.0,"The fake diamonds are tiny.  I know the price is low, but I would spend more and get something, that actually will show a bit of a sparkle.  I would say they are about the size of a quarter and do not feel cheap, just hard to see anything as she width minute."
3.0,Love the dress but strap broke as soon as I put it on....luckily I can easily sew it to fix but shouldn’t have to for a brand new dress. I’m going to keep it because it is cute and comfy.
3.0,"These boots are really cute, and relatively comfortable considering the height of the heel.  Unfortunately, the red patent is more of a watermelon, dark pink color - and not the fire engine red I was expecting.  I had to return them : ("
3.0,"I bought these before so I decided to get another pair since my son is now 2. Unfortunately, the gray ones I purchased don't fit as well as the previous black ones. These have a weird puckering around the laces. I'll try to add a picture."
3.0,"Cute but the black stones are not lava stones. I was hoping to use essential oils with it. These stones are smooth, not pores."
3.0,Not the best material but you get what you pay for.
3.0,"When I received the glasses, both lenses were loose in the package with the frames, in a plastic bag, with no padding..  The lenses were difficult to get snapped into the frames, and had small scratches on them, probably from banging around loose.  It took quite some time to get the lenses snapped into the frames, and were not very solidly secured in the grooves, no matter how I positioned them.  Eventually, I got them to stay.  However, if any distortion of the frames occurs, one, or both, lenses may pop out.  I have had them pop out multiple times, which creates potential for additional scratches on the lenses, depending on what environment I am in when it occurs.  For the price, not bad, but the lenses should fit better in the frames.  Difficult to keep from popping them out when cleaning them!!"
3.0,Ended up returning these because they were way smaller than  I had expected.  I should have paid closer attention to the measurements.
3.0,It doesn’t fit the way I expected. The waist is a little high.
3.0,The material is AWEFUL!  Like swimsuit material.  Not at all what I expected but it will serve its purpose as a one time party shirt.
3.0,Was in love with this necklace and unfortunately the clasp broke
3.0,"…to love this shirt. While I really liked the pattern and fabric, it was so short and boxy. As a gal with a larger bust, it was too short to tuck in the front and from the side added about 20lbs. Would be really great for a thinner, less busty frame. I’m 5’1/12”, 36C."
3.0,Cute!  Just a bit tight in the arms!
3.0,"Ordered a 1/2&#34;, but they seem to be a little smaller."
3.0,The first time I used the medium sized case the lock broke off in transit.  Also the zipper on the inside is not very high quality
3.0,This hat is made well and is pretty but the reason I bought it is because ut was advertised to “slouch” like the picture advertised. It fits close to my head like a skull cap type hat. It’s almost like it isn’t long enough. Disappointed but I kept it and favor it to my Mom
3.0,These went over quite well as gifts for the gals in my office.  One did arrive broken.  Luckily I only needed 8.
3.0,Un poco dificil el ajuste de las siliconas
3.0,Needed for a 90s party.  They served the purpose.
3.0,"Comfortable, but shed"
3.0,Amazing purse but the strap that makes it a purse instead of a backpack keeps breaking. This was my second one and the same thing happened. It still works as a backpack so I use it for that. It was very comfortable in Europe and kept dry when it rained. I just wish the strap was more sturdy.
3.0,"The rings were of okay quality. I would have preferred a larger size, the rings do not fit on my index finger."
3.0,Quality just ok
3.0,"Super cute, tshirt material hoodie. I loved it but it was way to big. I ordered a Medium. I placed a white ladies Large shirt on top to show how big it is, its bigger then the large shirt."
3.0,"Pretty spacious for all your toiletry needs.  However, after about a month's use, the zipper keeps getting stuck.  I'd have to use force or unzip it a couple of times to get it zipped back up."
3.0,"Unless your torso is non-existent, this is not a great top. I am 5'9"", 130 lbs and a 32D. The top comes right up under my bra line - I couldn't wear it as a crop top if I wanted to - it's like the perfect entry for a wet t-shirt contest but that's about it. I am keeping it and will end up wearing it under sweaters or jackets in the fall."
3.0,"This jacket is really nice, but it looks like I was sent a used one. The tag at the neck was cut out. It’s too late to return since I’ve already washed it. Other than that, it’s a quality coat perfect little boys in rainy/cool weather."
3.0,"I needed white shoes for a wedding I was in and the price was great, however I have wider feet and they started to hurt after a while. They look great on, so I guess if you are into the whole, &#34;beauty is pain&#34; thing and have wide feed, I would say go for it! but I ordered half a size up and they were still pretty tight. I can wear them for short periods of time, but for longer occasions I would go with something else."
3.0,I would like it better if the leather cord wasn't glued on.
3.0,I have never had the horseshoes before but the opening seemed really small and made it hard to get them on. Other than taking a moment to get them they are really nice. I love the colors but wish for more of a mix.
3.0,Glare is reduced very minor. Not like advertised.<br />Ok for twilight. Brightens up a gloomy day.<br />Good quality frame though.
3.0,"They should be washed delicately and air dry, because they will tear easily."
3.0,"simple, like, too simple, but what did I expect?"
3.0,"I'm 5'8"" 187lbs and I usually like large shirts.  However, when I got this one in a large it fit like and XXL! Otherwise it's a nix shirt, just order the size one lower than you usually would wear. I shoulda got a medium. That's my only issue tho!"
3.0,"I like the quality is perfect and very cute shoes first time  buy , i ask for size 9 and is to small . Is hard for me return if possible get another one size 10 . Thanks  i will like buy more but is  hard when the size  is wrong"
3.0,"Very cute suit but the bust is just terrible. The cup size is so small & the under wire hurts... It looked very cute on except for the top, I was literally spiling out of it...my cleavage had cleavage. The cups are padded too, so you almost have a torpedo look going on.I am going to attempt to alter it myself so we shall see!"
3.0,"It was OK. I wish it was longer, that's the reason it went back. Looks like a sweat shirt that blouses out at the bottom. Not what I was hoping for. The material is soft, and nice."
3.0,the picture looks nothing like what arrives.  I was expecting 3 different sizes.  they all are really big and not much of difference in sizes.
3.0,Nice but very thin I expected to be little thicker for price
3.0,I ordered the darker blue but it looks more like the lighter blue color. The material is different than I thought but it is a cute summer dress
3.0,"Cute designs, but very thin. There are two layers, but combined they barely make a thick fabric. The fit is good- covers mouth and nose well, and the ear straps are comfy and adjustable."
3.0,Will be cute with jeans but wouldn't wear with dresses or leggings because of the elastic.
3.0,Doesn’t fit to size
3.0,"Fit was okay; however, material was thin and see-through. Gave it to someone, and she loves it."
3.0,it says 11-12. Or 10-11 men size but it's 100 present for a little man size 10 exact.<br />Too small advertised sizes wrong
3.0,Shorts were longer then expected for a “80s” type of shorts and the colors weren’t very bright. Other then that nice shorts
3.0,I loved the look of the dress however it’s quite small...I’d likely need to size up
3.0,Decent product for the money.  The material is a bit itchy for me but they have held up well for my daughter.  They have great colors!
3.0,This ring WILL turn your finger green.
3.0,it broke within 2 days but it looks nice
3.0,"It's a little thin, as in see through.  I wish the color were solid."
3.0,This is why a man isn't supposed to buy clothes for their wife.
3.0,"All the lights worked but it's a little difficult for my grandchildren(age 4) to put them on themselves.  They stay on with a rubber band, I thought they clipped on like the ones you see in the store, but the kids are having lots of fun with them.  Good value."
3.0,I thought it would be bigger
3.0,Stretches out very easily.  Doesn't spring back even the first time stretched.
3.0,Short but simple review: Super comfy but Super cheap.
3.0,"The tag says 110% cotton, but it doesnt' feel like it. It has a weird stretch and super smooth feel to it - almost like underwear, maybe? My kids thought it was a rash guard. I am 5'3"" and 110 pounds and usually wear small or medium tops. I want a crop top that is on the looser side so I went for the large (medium was not available) but it is quite big! Even the sleeves are strangely long. Otherwise, the red stitching on black fabric is fun and the cupid design on the chest is clear and cute. The quality of the fabric seems good, just not what I was expecting."
3.0,"Not really supportive, fits more like a sports bra, squishes breasts together in the middle. It probably would be best for small breasts. I wear a 36g, I can fit into it, but I would not recommend or buy again."
3.0,"I have been looking for a really great pair of merino undies. Unfortunately these don't quite live up to my expectations. The fabric is thinner than some other brands that I have purchased, which is a good thing.  However, they are soooo thin that they feel flimsy and they are see through. I have not washed them yet, so I'm not sure how they will hold up in the laundry."
3.0,The key rings are very sturdy.  They are almost impossible to open and attach a key/token.
3.0,I understand why it is the price it is but I think it's a bit expensive for what you get. The chains are thin and the charm searches easy. It's a beautiful pice of jewelry just look out for those things.
3.0,"Maybe I didn't read the description well enough. But I was disappointed. The stones are an ugly yellow color, metal is rose gold. They're tinier than I expected, but again, that is probably my fault. Good quality though, don't hurt my ears."
3.0,"Why I bought it:<br />- I was looking for a sports bra top to go with my mint leggings<br /><br />Things I disliked:<br />- Fitting is loose and I had to exchange it for a lower size<br />- Doesn't provide much support and is just like a top rather than sports bra (Defeats the main purpose of buying it)<br />- Straps are not adjustable<br />- Colors are a bit dull<br /><br />Things I liked:<br />- Provides full coverage to chest<br />- Pattern is nice with crisscross straps at the back<br />- Comes with removable pads<br />- Material is a bit stretchy and with good stitching<br /><br />Will I recommend it:<br />- I returned it, but if you are fine with the sizing and support then you may give it a try"
3.0,"I like these sunglasses but to be honest they are not the as nice as I was hoping for. The tortoise shell design is a tad cheap looking, there isn't any real &#34;weight&#34; to the glasses so they feel a bit flimsy. They came a bit crooked and I have been bending them around to try to get them straight. The Rayban Clumasters in tortoise are in a totally different league and if you have the cash I would suggest those, if not go for the black ones from triple optic. Much better quality!"
3.0,Very weird fit and hard to iron since it came really wrinkled and stayed that way even after washing and irioning
3.0,"Cool watch, but the band pins fall out a lot, wouldn’t ware it in the ocean or if you’re active at all."
3.0,"It was too narrow to fit on my upper arm well enough to keep from curling down to my elbow.  I wasn't impressed with it.  But it did cover my forearms and had it stayed it place like it should've, it would've been better."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this sweater. The seems are really thick, which can be a little bulky looking and uncomfortable. The fabric isn’t terribly soft, and is a little scratchy. It isn’t as oversized on me as the model, so I wish I’d sized up on this to achieve the same look."
3.0,"Good quality outside. Did not like the inside lining, too rough the material,  looks like paper. Don't know how much will last"
3.0,"These appear much larger than they actually are.  Perhaps the description gave me the exact size, but I didn't notice it.  Suffice it to say, these could be worn by a child they're so small.  The color is great - I just wish they were bigger."
3.0,Much thinner than I was expecting. Cannot use it as a winter coat and does not have the grow with me option. Fleece does not zip into the shell. Is a good spring/fall coat but I will need something warmer for winter.
3.0,"Fit for very wide feet which is perfect for mine.  They do have a thick heel but are light weight so it’s not uncomfortable.  What is noticeable is that FitFlop have switched from superior quality foot bed and high quality materials to cheap foot bed - not much cushion or arch support to cheap feeling upper with even cheaper feeling lining inside the upper. If you are looking for all day comfort and support, you should probably look elsewhere. But if you want a wide fit, errand running sandal then this will do.  Definitely not a dressy sandal for evening time."
3.0,Shirt is very thin and is not worth the $$
3.0,"They are descent. I should have done more research regarding compression rating and length. I accidentally order mens instead of womens, so that's why they are too large.  It was my error,  but the product was good and I will use it until I order new ones."
3.0,"Just what I expected, only reason I gave three stars is that. Silicone simple should not be worn for an extended period of time.  Your skin will crack and peal (most people).  Really, Not many manufacturers if any give  a real heads up.  So  I guess its three stars for all silicone rings. I use them all the time I am  electrician. Just make sure you take them off at night and clean occasionally."
3.0,It is so slim. I didn't realize how<br />small it is when I read the dimensions.  My fault.
3.0,"Love the TikTik brand, first thing not 100% satisfied with. Just the top seems to run small amd short. Otherwise comfy."
3.0,"It arrived in a thin transparent plastic bag on a rainy day.  After lying in the rain for a couple of hours, the dress got wet and slightly damaged.  Considering insufficient time to return and ask for  a replacement, I am keeping this dress, as it fits.  I would highly recommend the seller to pack it better in future."
3.0,"I really love it! the color, it fits perfectly! But the first day I used it, The sparkle thing in one of the pockets went out and now I have a hole in it"
3.0,"The dress is super comfortable, but quality is not fantastic. Size is pretty true to size, but tends to run a tad smaller. Washing instructions are not great. Washed with darks and color did not come off, but ran slightly on the dress, but not bad enough to return."
3.0,"It is fantastic shoes, very comfy. But after wearing it for a 9 month, the sole inside of the shoes is completely worn out. I cannot wear this shoes anymore when I'm visiting some one at home and need to put off my shoes."
3.0,Writing this review because i could not find one for my watch . So i took a chance and i failed lolz. I have the G-SHOCK x ASICS tiger collob watch and the keeper on my watched ripped since i wear it everyday . Well anyway back to the main part my watch is a GBA-800 and i could not find what size it was so i went with a 22. Now that it came in i wish i wouldn’t stuck with my gut feeling if you have this size go with the 20 it’s more of a snug fit . The 22 does the job but not kept well tight. And for the 3 star rating well the material isn’t the thickest like your standard one that comes with the watch and it doesn’t come with that grove the goes into the hole to keep the Keeper in place . So i thought a fair review would be a 3 star in in the center it gets the job done  and it comes with a good amount to replace. I strongly believe if this company took the time to compare sizes like which ones go with which watches it would make life a lot easier and i would give it a star more for having the information there . But over all 3 star came in fast and quality isn’t bad .
3.0,I ordered XL and it fits a lot smaller than my other XL shirts 😕
3.0,Product fit as expected but I didn't like how it looked on me particularly so I returned it
3.0,"The stitching is not as well as I thought it would be. The torso area is very plain, so matching a belt with it will make it much more stylish. The fabric is thick and a little scratchy."
3.0,Super cute to the eye but they break/fall off one by one after the first wear.
3.0,the tint has gotten scratched and came off a bit.<br />now i use them to run and work out because they have more room to open they fell of my face a lot so i have a strap to hold them in place and its dorky that why they are my work out pair<br />pretty well made for the price there are better one out there
3.0,"Not a huge fan.  I did not like how thin the fabric is; I cannot wear it to work.  In fact I don't wear it at all, not even as sleepwear."
3.0,very brass looking
3.0,I ordered this bracelet last year and it was beautiful. I ordered it again because A group of 5 of us at work are taking classes for our Master's degrees at Purdue. Ordered this for all of us to<br />give to one of our colleagues that just graduated.<br />It arrived looking terrible. The P charm had dirt or tarnish spot and the bracelet had a couple spots that were starting to tarnish. Very disappointing! I can't give this as a gift. I found an Alex & Ani Purdue bracelet that looked so much better I ordered that instead. This bracelet was not cheap or even reasonably priced either for the quality that you get. The A&A bracelet was $15 cheaper and much nicer looking. Buyer beware. Hit or miss with this one.
3.0,"The Black Watch Band Came with a Chunk of the Band Missing.  It still functions, but unhappy with purchase of black band.  What Band is just fine."
3.0,"I'M REALLY NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS PURCHASE.  THE MATERIAL IS CHEAP FEELING, IT SLIDES OFF. WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT MYSELF."
3.0,"Was hoping this would compare to the jujube be quicks. The pattern is sweet, but it’s definitely not like jujube quality level. I do like the additional outside pocket though and the price point is better.<br /><br />It’s still highly functional though- I use this for diapering needs in diaperbag."
3.0,"Cheap product, cheaply made, some of the rings had random plastic hanging off"
3.0,Cute and nice weight for the price
3.0,Runs small.  I read the reviews and ordered my usual size but it was too tight across the chest and back.  Also this white one is quite sheer.
3.0,The shirt looks like what I ordered I got a medium think it would fit my B cups but it’s way too small on my chest rides up
3.0,I'm short so it was a little long but still a good bargain
3.0,I bought this shoe for the flexibility of the style.  It is great in color and style. Although I did wear the shoe shopping and it made a blister on my little toe. I think once the leather gets a little softer it will be a fantastic shoe to wear any time. Bandolino is a great shoe.
3.0,"Color and style is spot on. However, it hurt! There was sharp edges or something on the inside of the band. Picture shows my wrist after half a day of wear. Ouch!"
3.0,Definitely Asian sizing. The biggest size is barely a 14 in women's. No stretch at all. Sent it back.
3.0,"The product was okay, it didn't seem that 3Dish but it is okay. The remote, however, did not really work to change colors as quickly and easily as I believe it should have."
3.0,"Weird fit. Stretched completely out, it'll cover your eyes. No good seal... so I guess you could say it vents well?"
3.0,Arms run tight.
3.0,Very pretty and comfy...too hot for sleeping.
3.0,"It is amazing! Arrived fast and is soooo comfortable. The original band that came with my watch was causing skin break down. this one causes no skin break down, easy to Install and makes putting on and taking off my watch so easy. I love the color. I have no worries about the magnetic latch coming undone. The band does not get in the way of charging the watch.<br /><br />Update: after some time, the color started coming off. That is fine, I am not too worried about things constantly looking new but what is annoying are the edges of the bands coming loose and catching on my clothes. I had a satin robe that now has threads pulled out because my watch band caught them and as I moved around, pulled them from the fabric. I still enjoy how easy it is to put in and adjust but the catching on stuff is getting to be a bit much. I cannot easily bend them down so that they will stop catching, even with pliers, as they become forever lodged out of place."
3.0,"It’s a pretty locket overall with a very nice message but was disappointed that it came with a tarnished look that doesn’t wipe off despite the cleaning cloth provided. The locket itself is also very hard to open, which is good so you don’t loose what’s inside but you also should be able to open without too much difficulty."
3.0,easy to use and comfortable
3.0,The pants were too big for me so I had to return. I’m 5’2” and 118 pounds. I ordered the smallest size they make.
3.0,runs small had to return beautiful but runsverysmall
3.0,I got the product today but when I tryed it on it was a little too big for my arm. I decide to keep it anyway I was not going to pay the shipping to return it so I will use it as a hook for my room it will work great that way then at least I will get some use out of it since I can't ware it.
3.0,The bag is super flimsy it's a large size but keeping things in it is hard or if you're jn a hurry you have to dig to find things and have a hard time opening it.
3.0,"I am allergic to most metals, so I will find out in a few days if this is really sterling silver and not plated. The chain is VERY short, unless your teenie tiny you may want a longer chain. The actual pendant is small and thin, but it IS sturdy for its size. I am fairly happy with it, just wish the chain were longer."
3.0,"Buttons were hanging off the skirt making it look cheap so I returned.  If you were handy with a needle, you could probably fix that issue and be happy with this.  Cute dress otherwise!  Fits a little bit small so I'd order up."
3.0,"maybe i misunderstood the ad for this, but it's just a cuff bracelet. don't get me wrong, it's BEAUTIFUL and JUST as pictured - but if you're like me with kinda small wrists compared to your hands, there is no clasp (at least on mine) to secure it... so it kinda is apt to fall off/not stay on your arm/wrist. it's also a bit on the heavy side. the pros/cons are fairly even here on this purchase. ☮💖🌞"
3.0,It’sa little smaller then I expected
3.0,Band pinches my arm every time I hook it. Not a fan of the buckle strap.
3.0,"Quality material for the top could be better but overall nice dress, will do the job. Belt and flowers comes detached"
3.0,"I like having a genuine 1 rand coin, but had hoped I might be able to wear it. A 1 rand  coin has a currency value of around 7 cents USD. The chain has no practical value. This makes the value for the entire piece vastly overpriced."
3.0,The idea is pretty cool but it kept openning and the ball would fall out. I stopped wearing it because of that. I didn't want to lose the balls.
3.0,Fit as described however appears quite a bit faded compared to the photo. Arrived on time as well.
3.0,Needed something for Halloween. Ok for use..but $2.00 worth
3.0,"Very comfortable, but these sandals run a bit small.  I would order a size up."
3.0,This is more like a fetish mask than a costume mask... Can not see thru...  On the plus side: Probably keeps Covid-19 at bay!
3.0,"I received this a few days ago as a gift.  I haven't used it yet, so I can't comment on utility or durability yet.<br /><br />I actually put this on my wish list after spending a good bit of time comparing with about 6 other bags of the same style and price range.  I specifically asked for this one based on the pictures in the item description.<br /><br />I say that because my 3 stars are based on misleading pictures and description; the &quot;high quality cow leather&quot; (3rd picture from the top) material is, not surprisingly, plastic.  I didn't expect real leather at this price so I'm not mad, I just wish manufacturers wouldn't mislead folks in their descriptions.  The big issue is the crazy &quot;Engrish&quot; poem/mission statement printed on the fake leather - it's really quite prominent (see pics), and goes completely against my desire for a plain back, as is clearly shown in every manufacturer-supplied photo.<br /><br />I'll probably keep it, but I'm disappointed that the product ISN'T what is shown."
3.0,"I purchased this stone because it's supposed to be colorless DE, it is not. There is a lot of yellow more like GH in color, but it is VVS1. I have real  VVS1 color E and F diamonds, this stone lookes yellow next to them. The stone looks good but just not colorless."
3.0,"The zipper​ broke at 3rd use, Is a little too wide"
3.0,"I read reviews and most said it ran big.  I am usually a size 14 so I didn't order the plus size, I ordered the regular adult size.  I couldn't get my head through the opening!  I had to cut a slit in the opening and hope it doesn't fray in the future.  The sleeves were about 4 inches too short.  The shoulders were narrow but fit ok.  The socks were a bit short but worked fine.  The bloomers were fine.  The dress and bloomers are totally see through.  I wore knee length leggings and a flowing night gown underneath.  Worked great a it added another ruffle to the sleeves and another layer under the dress.  I was disappointed when I found four little slits cut into the apron.  Im going to put a piece of white felt under it to reinforce and avoid further ripping.  Ultimately I love my costume but I'm not sure it will last long!"
3.0,Nice style but the Frame feels a little cheap - Plastic. Good for the price
3.0,"This shirt was so cute when I took it out of the package but the fit was terrible. The shirt cling so tight in the torso/midsection but was big everywhere else. Just an odd fit. So bummed because I loved the ombré effect. If you have a tiny tiny waist, this is for you."
3.0,"I've used several different refracting glasses and these were not horrible but the refraction could have been more pronounced. However, for the price, I was able to get 100 and hand them out during the holidays so kids could view Christmas lights with them - they seemed to enjoy them."
3.0,"The watch is beautiful, but unfortunately the clasp broke after being worn just a few times. Returned for refund - less shipping. Disappointing."
3.0,Nice but too big to be fashionable.
3.0,"I received them today, and I'm so disappointed with the color.  I ordered the pale pink, and they are a nauseating salmon color.  I know they are just bags, but the color grosses me out!  I'm going to send them back.  The quality looks good though, and they are very light weight.  I think I'll go for the grey."
3.0,"These are nice pajamas that are advertised as satin but aren't. The fit is good, but the fabric isn't top quality and, frankly, this particular color is horrendous. I think if I put these on and went outside someone could see me from outer space.<br /><br />But that's just my personal opinion, although they really are a garish color. The fabric looks cheap and probably is. The PJs are comfortable enough and fairly well made, but the color, oh my.<br /><br />This company could and should do better. The shine and color of the PJs, at least in this color, aren't accurately shown in the listing. I wouldn't recommend these at all. If you do buy them, please get another color."
3.0,Much larger than I thought. Oversized but they are nice.
3.0,I returned this dress because the design was odd. One side of the front is cut in a curved hem and the other side is straight.<br />Also the top part was too big and the bottom half was small.<br />The fabric is a fun print but too heavy of a weight for this design so it didn't drape very well.
3.0,"Comfortable and cute, but dye rubs off onto other fabric."
3.0,"The shirt was just OK.  The logo on the front looks great in the picture, but once you wash it once, it fades, and each wash after that fades a little bit more every time.  Its a cheap 100% cotton shirt, which wasn't a real surprised, but with shirts like that, they look worn and aged really quickly.  My daughter does get a ton of comments on it when she wore it to school. It's really cute, but she only wore it a few times before it looked like a pajama shirt because it just looked worn too fast."
3.0,This shoe has attractive colors. The toe box however is made of synthetic leather which I think will not hold up to my sons running. I ordered a size 1 but it’s small for my son. He’s usually a size 1 to 1.5 in Nike. Since kids wear socks with this shoe I should have ordered a size 2.5
3.0,A lot poofier than expected. Also once I took it out of the packaging it smelled TERRIBLE. Made my whole room smell weird. Fit ok.
3.0,Took a month to arrive. At first wash one of the ears fell off.. no problem it can be sewed back on.. good for the price
3.0,"At first it was great, but then it started to shrink and now it's too small."
3.0,Gorgeous but size was fairly far off on the small side. I'd order at the very least 1 size larger than normal
3.0,this kpretty bra is nicely made but runs small. Definitely size up. the orange is a pretty eachy color that should flatter most skin tones. The material is soft and feels nice oagainst the skin. It is attractively designed with a racer bck and a scoop neck. It is free of embellishments but attractive none the less. It provides medium support which contributes to its comfort but may restrict its use. Machine wash cold; tumble dry low. Nice bras that just runs a bit too small.
3.0,The material was less than desirable. It felt more like tissue paper and was stiff. It was pretty see through and the neck line was unflattering.
3.0,I was really excited about this dress but the yellow striped dress was too see through for me to wear. Yikes! Hoping it was just that color and trying another.
3.0,"This product isn’t easy to adjust to where you need it to sit. I’m having trouble with mine. The plastic adjuster pieces also dig in under my arms. The chest strap sits really high on me. I’m going to try to us it and see how it performs. It does seems made well with good materials though, and it’s very lightweight. I may return it."
3.0,"This watch looks great, I love that they have bands for women that fit my small wrist. However, I have had the watch for less than 2 months and already it has died on me. So now I have to decide if I like this watch enough to invest in learning how to replace the battery."
3.0,Looks nice but smells terrible.
3.0,"It's a nice umbrella. I like the tilt function. I've had mine for a year though and the color has faded dramatically, where parts of the cloth are now a light pinkish shade. I was hoping the color would hold up a bit better, but the functionality of the umbrella is nice. LEDs aren't super bright, they are more of an accent light, and they provide a nice ambience for late nights out on the deck."
3.0,I ordered size small...Top fits me great but the bottoms are to small...since I loved the top I found separate bottoms.
3.0,Extremely tight/clingy
3.0,The heart fell out if the holding frame. Was held by glue. Disappointing. Hold on less than 8 dinner dates.
3.0,Doesn't look like the same shirt.
3.0,They are too big as a face covering
3.0,Hello cleopatra!  Costume jewelry quality but I collect earrings and these were different enough to add.
3.0,Not what I expected. Picture looks better than the actual produect
3.0,"It's very cute, but the color sent does not match the color in the picture. I bought the one that looked purple, but if was actually a pink dress."
3.0,"I really like this coat.  It’s warm, covers my long arms (which alone makes me not want to return it), this is rare for me for being tall. The only down side is the zipper. It will break.  The coat is long so when zippered and moving around, getting into car or bending over to pick something up... it will bust this zipper open at the bottom with no resistance.  I sew, I will be putting a better zipper in. The zipper may be the winner for the cheapest zipper I’ve ever seen in my life. I can bend the teeth with light pressure.  Also, there are no pockets on the inside. Which for me is a huge disappointment."
3.0,"Color is supposed to be pink, it’s a lilac at best. Was supposed to be for my gender reveal and I have no time to return it. Even if I did the only color options are pink, white, and black…which I wonder what the black and white ones look like…if you want a cute pink cardigan specifically do not order this. It fits well, and the sleeves are cute. Other than that it’s not what I ordered."
3.0,Thin white material— could be heavier weight material
3.0,"It does light up, but you really have to be near it to get it to light up. So you better hope it doesn't move around or you're out of luck. I've spent more time moving things around in my bag just trying to find the dumb thing so it would light up! I don't recommend it."
3.0,Nice but the flower was a bit big for me. It didn’t look like the picture at all.
3.0,Beautiful shirt but it did not fit. I ordered X-large and it still did not fit. Highly disappointed :(
3.0,its hard to put them on.
3.0,I wasn’t crazy about the material. It fit a little tighter than I like so I’m not so sure I will wear it out in public.
3.0,This jacket is not for me and very red. Will iron and see.
3.0,heavier then expected so I felt hot in them.  would not buy another pair
3.0,"Very see through, and material is cheep and thin. But still really pretty"
3.0,"lenth is good, but wide-and my daughter is on crest of needing to order shoes in a wide or regular. They are comfy, soft, and do not hurt her feet. Also, the circle emblem is on held on with 1 set of claws, while the square has 2 sets of claws. After 2nd use, the Circle came off. I sewed large pom poms (2$each at craft store)on to cover holes where circle was attached & made them look like Tink shoes. So if you are DiY capable."
3.0,"the shirt is exactly what it is in the photo and the sizing is correct however the small writing that you can’t read in the product photo reads “just do wanna do n do wanna do. i cama, i saw, i got frustraled and gave ap. i dont hove time for this repressed memory bull shit” with that exact spelling. when i first read it i was very confused. i looked it up to see if it was song lyrics but it’s not and it’s very misspelled. the writing on the top of the shirt above the “i’m very well” is upside down and it reads “be you, do youior you” again with that exact spelling. i’m not sure what they were going for and from far away it’s a very good shirt but the writing makes zero sense. (i got a 3X because i wanted a very baggy fit but with my measurements i could fit an XL)"
3.0,Wasn't expecting it to be so big but they are fun. Good quality
3.0,"I like this coat, but the material is almost plastic and one of the snaps is sewn into the pocket so makes the pocket useless.<br />I am not going to return the coat, but the quality of the fabric is lacking"
3.0,I bought one sixe bigger then I needed and it was still to small.
3.0,I use to purchase all the tine for my Childcare Center..Price is still too expensive because of COVID.
3.0,It is very pretty. However the key chain is not secure and broke within an hour of putting my keys on. It came with a black cord with a clasp also. Unfortunately too short to wear with the pendant on it for a necklace.
3.0,The color is a pinker red. Bummer. It runs big. Bummer. The shape of the color is horrible. But the material is light... I'm going to give it to my mother. It's more her style... And I'm 48
3.0,Loving the style but it is a bit larger than I expected
3.0,"Wrinkly, and hard to get wrinkles out."
3.0,"Nice, but it looks NOTHING like the one advertised here. The rosary beads I received are a much darker blue and the chain and crucifix are silver, NOT gold as shown in the one advertised here. Wish the one I received was the same color as the rosary beads shown here. Oh well. Guess from now on I will purchase my rosary beads in person, NOT online! Lesson learned!"
3.0,"Very nice shirt but the coloring is frustrating! At times it looks black and other times a deep blue, I expected it to be black.  Learned the hard way when I wore it to work and once I got there realized i didn't match. Thought I was exaggerating and had other people look at it and they cant figure out what color it is either"
3.0,I sized up to wear with leggings and fits true to size. Gave three stars bc the material is not as pictured. Has that ‘polyester shine’ and is not mate in color which is not described or pictured. Otherwise worked perfectly for impromptu ugly Christmas sweater party.
3.0,"little tight, but will do for the short period i have to wear this."
3.0,Runs big go one size down. Quality jacket. Very pleased so far. Let's see if it's water proof? We'll see.  Sure it will.<br />Feels like it may leak around shoulder seams and sticks to five o'clock Shadow at the collar. Collar feels like a felt material. I'm going to rate it a three  for now being I can't send it back.
3.0,"I am 5' 8 1/2, length was perfect, and the waist, but the thigh to calf area was at least 2&#34; to wide and baggy even after being washed. Looked liked elephant legs."
3.0,"This shirt in the tie die color, comes in a different material than all the rest. Not T-shirt material but more of a stretchy polyester. Disappointed."
3.0,"Nice watch, neat design, keeps great time, seems fairly well made for the price.<br /><br />Update, Had problems with watch and they sent a replacement, which also had problems.<br />Was issued a refund. Nice people to deal with."
3.0,The dress is pretty. I wish the mask came with it. The mask shouldn't be in the pictures if it's not going to be included.
3.0,"While very pretty, it's important to know that these are very muted colored stones. They do not look like any of the photos. Stones are not bright, but muted earthy tones. I purchased these based on the stone colors shown in the photo and they don't work for the ""look"" I was after. Disappointed."
3.0,I love the details but what I hate is that these rings are just too BIG!! I could only wear it for pictures but after about 30 seconds they fall off because they don't fit properly. Also because it's too big it looks a little ridiculous..
3.0,"Cheaply made, you get what you pay for."
3.0,My daughter is always losing her earrings & I really hoped these would do the trick & stay in...they did for about 2 months then kept opening up & falling out
3.0,"This doesn't look terrible but it isn't a 'real' chain.  Basically, its a 'costume jewelry' version for your pooch.  That doesn't make it bad particularly for training purposes.  It is lighter so younger pups won't have such a difficult time with it and IF they do get this snagged/caught on something more then likely it will snap long before they will seriously hurt themselves.<br /><br />Also, for indoor dogs its a nice reminder collar or even older dogs that might be uncomfortable with the heavy weight of an thick chain collar.<br /><br />For actual daily indoor/outdoor use its like a 2 star.  For training, its more like a 4."
3.0,I think they sent me the wrong size i ordered a size zero on the model they looked tight but on me they are real baggy I hope I can shrink them with hot water and drying
3.0,"This suit is adorable, but the material is a little disappointing. It is quite see through when wet, and it’s not a stark white and dark blue, the blue is fine, but the white has a very strong blue hue to it, so the white sun hat our daughter has doesn’t really match well since this isn’t actually white. The bow gets quite floppy when wet, losing its cute factor.<br /><br />The suit does handle laundering well, and it came out fine the time I accidentally put it through the dryer, so that’s nice.<br /><br />All in all, it’s fine, and our baby will use it many times. It’s a bit big on her, but she’s kind of a lean baby, so I’m sure the sizing is pretty close to what you’d expect."
3.0,"The small was still a little too big for me, so I returned it. I'm 5' 6&#34; 130 lbs athletic build, and I wear a small top and 6 bottom."
3.0,El tamaño no corre regular
3.0,Super cute but came the lenses came in lopsided. I easily fixed it after a couple of minutes of trying to bend them back into place. I love them so much and will be buying another pair for my friend!
3.0,Love this suit. Made the mistake of buying true to the size chart.  The top fits great but the bottom is too big.  Will def still wear it because I love the style but would love if it came in separates.
3.0,"looks great, but hard to adjust the size"
3.0,I can see right through it. Wear a slip and it should fix that problem.<br />Very stretchy material<br />I like it. The vibrant colors is what made me purchase it.
3.0,I thought it would be a little better presented. The plastic covers were difficult to remove and looked cheap.
3.0,The glitter strip peels up but I just super glue it back down
3.0,"It wasn't too tight in the sense that it squeezed me but my underwear and bra lines were super noticeable. But it did look nice and give a shape, but I had to return it bc it didn't look close to modest. Also for some it might be different, bc I have HUGE hips 😳 hope this helps (:"
3.0,Though they are warm. These boots are NOT anti-slip. They do not grippy. They are useless on ice.
3.0,"While the cap is adjustable,  I have to overlap the velcro so far in making it smaller,  that there is hardly any available to secure the cap's size.  It is also not very comfortable<br /> But I like the decoration design."
3.0,"Needs to be screwed on to floor , top heavy,"
3.0,"I wore this to a wedding and I had a problem where the sides of the belt kept folding over.  I attempted shifting the belt thinking I had it too low or too high, but the problem persisted.  It wasn't so bad when I was standing, but any kind of bending, sitting or dancing caused the belt to shift or fold.  It looked great in photos, and I accept that my weight was probably a factor in the struggle, just wanted to let people know.  If you are on the heavier side or have a lot of curves and you plan on sitting for any extended period of time this belt might not be for you."
3.0,Pretty good for the price. It does run a little snug. I am 5'4&#34; and 145 and I ordered a Large and it fit perfect. The material feels a little cheap and the boob pads are very cone shaped. I took them out. It fits well and will be good for the days I don't want to show too much.
3.0,Love the earrings but one came broken. I was able to glue it together.
3.0,"The only two I could fit on my fingers are the two shown above (@muzzyphotography) the rings fit a little too snug for my taste, the 2nd image I actually had to bend the metal a little so it didn't pinch my fingers. But over all solid, good for cosplay, with a little modification they worked great"
3.0,"Arrived with a broken button.  I returned it with no issues and they did offer to send a new one, but wasn't really happy with the way it looked on me personally."
3.0,"I am 5'7&#34; and 155 lbs with a 36 DD. I should have known my chest was too big to wear something like this.<br />I'm too lazy to return it, so I actually wear this under cute darker color shirts. Gotta make sure to hide the straps... The skirt part is cute. Light and swingy if that makes sense. It is a little shorter than mid-thigh on me. If I had a smaller chest, it would work and look great."
3.0,I love it but i wish the post wasn’t so long. It spins a lot
3.0,"Dress does not look in person like it does on the model in the picture. The lace is poor quality and does not appear to be made well. Sizing also not true to the sizing chart provided, fits smaller than expected"
3.0,"the problem I have with these is that they are not very sturdy, they are too soft to be considered compression accessories"
3.0,Super cute but the fit for the mommy suit was too short in the torso and the leg holes seemed a bit large on the little girls swimsuit.
3.0,received item with one the the quick release pins broken
3.0,Pretty for something inexpensive and simple
3.0,not tight  or firm hold but enough smoothness to be ok
3.0,It's a great bracelet but the stone fell out the first day my son wore it and we can't find it :(
3.0,Runs small - I even sized up and it was still VERY snug. I'd recommend going 2 sizes up.
3.0,Gag gift to myself to put in the back window of my land yacht to agree to all those who make comments about her.  Not the nicest nor the best but serves the purpose...
3.0,"The quality of the tank top seems great. The thick and stretchy material appears that it will last a while.<br /><br />My reason for taking off 2 stars is the placement of the word “compassion.” In the pictures it looks like it sits on top of the breast area. Cool.<br /><br />Mine however, hides just underneath, like an underboob. And I’m not even that big anymore ( thanks to all this fitness). The word is almost lost when wearing a regular bra and barely noticeable when wearing a sports bra. Pretty disappointed as I really liked the design and simplicity of it! Will be returning :("
3.0,The rose fell off within about a week
3.0,It's cute. It was a gift request so I bought it. But it's smaller than I imagined even w dimensions listed and definitely overpriced. I'd look elsewhere or wait for a sale.
3.0,Good watch only draw back is that a couple of the buttons press to easily and just bushing the button activates it.  SO it always switching between 12 and 24 hr or going to a different function.
3.0,"I would have liked it if the top had been cut symmetrical.  Also, not really meant for large busted ladies. I had planned to wear it with a t-shirt underneath, but the top was an awkward fit (I wear a 38D) and there was puckering on one side.  Material was nice, though."
3.0,It fit well and looks sexy on. The only down side is if you pay close attention you'll see it is cheaply put together. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"5'9 and change, about 140lbs, muscular, no fat on me. Built like.. You know... Helio? The guy that invented the modern sport by tailoring it for guys built like him. Skinny. But for some reason Hayabusa only makes gis for guys built like a shit brick house. If you're not wide as a barn door, just go for a brand with half sizes. I'm usually an A1L, I own A2s, and went with the A1 on this one. Pants are a little short, but too wide. Same with the top. I always wanted a Hayabusa gi, and decided to finally pull the trigger. It's durable as hell, very well constructed, and will definitely stand the test of time. A little heavy, but stays surprisingly dry and cool. They know what they're doing, but it pisses me off that my most expensive gi fits the worst, even though I followed their sizing instructions. If I could return it, I would. If anyone from the company is reading this, you guys suck. Just make half sizes."
3.0,"Entiendo que para muchas personas puede ser bueno, pero se abrían, se desacomodaban y no me permitían ver de la mejor manera"
3.0,"came with bows that came of right away, other than that i like it"
3.0,"Me encanto el sueter, tal y como luce en la foto. El unico y pequeño detalle es que no tiene la talla marcada en la ropa y asi saber cual es la talla mas le quedo mas pequeño de lo esperado."
3.0,The shading is just right on these. Very easy to see out of but they block the sun great. They are very comfortable to wear. My only issue is the heart lenses seem to be so close together. It makes them look a little funny.
3.0,Not the quality I had anticipated. The picture online is much more appealing than when this arrives folded and wrinkled. It is the size I was looking for which I was having difficulty finding in stores. It's large enough for regular purse items and to fit my lunch for work.
3.0,This band is not for bigger wrists. It fits me on the last hole.  My biggest complaint is that it's SUPER itchy. Not sure if I'll return it or what.
3.0,Got these for the girlfriend and they are ok.  They don't look as good as the picture shows and come to think of it I don't think the girlfriend has even worn them....and she loves anything Harry Potter.
3.0,For a very small person
3.0,"I like the pants.  I wear these jeans all the time, but these are way longer than they usually are."
3.0,"Dress did not fit, material did not give. Returned to sender..."
3.0,"I would have loved this dress... if it had fit. I ordered the smallest size they had and still was swimming in it. I think in trying to adjust asian sizing to American, something was lost. If you wear 0-2 US dont even bother ordering."
3.0,Beautiful ammonite. Shiny! The silver posts says 925 but they turned my ears black and they hurt. Also very cheap silver. Bends easily.
3.0,"I love the blouse.  It's really cute, and the bow details are a very nice touch.  However, the fabric on the collar is very cheap, and the hem is a bit shorter than what I'm used to.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just washed it for a second time, and one of the bows fell apart.  It was already on the gentle cycle.  Also, because the hem is gathered, it kept rolling up on me, exposing some of my skin.  I already ordered one size up.  Maybe I should have gotten an XL instead."
3.0,"It is very hard to find women's XS gloves. The inner liner feels correct, but the outer glove still has 1/2&#34; extra length in the fingers."
3.0,"I bought these for my dad because they would be easier for him to get them on as opposed to the regular style that most people use. I gave a rating of 3 because even though I read all the reviews about the sizes running small, I bought 2 sizes bigger then my dad's usual size and they are still a bit to small. The first night he wore them he woke up with pain in his legs and had to take them off in the middle of the night, that was a bit of a hassle. They are much easier to get this style of compression sock on but the sizing really needs to get straightened out. Thankfully we were able to give them to a friend that needed a new pair and they worked great for her but I'm skeptical of buying any more of this style for my dad until the sizes are fixed."
3.0,The bottom seems very slippery so it makes me feel unsafe when I wear these out.
3.0,"Love them, they are comfortable however they are not a true white more of an off white/winter white."
3.0,bigger gem than expected :/
3.0,Almost impossible to hook the band to the frame! Still don't have it togerther.
3.0,"not bad, look nice but I wish they would have spent less on the product contained and more on the lenses.<br />They have plastic lenses and for what they cost I was expecting glass. Will keep looking."
3.0,The dress fits beautifully the only thing is that the lining in the neck shows a bit other than that it's a beautiful dress.
3.0,Like the hat but it’s about double the size of my head. It fits down over my ears and still has room to spare! How do I shrink this beast?
3.0,The top is very cute and that's the only reason I am keeping this set but I will only be able the use the top.  My guess is the liner of the bottom was cut smaller than the swimsuit fabric and when they stretch it to sew it together with the swimsuit fabric the bottom bunch up in a few places.
3.0,"Cute shoes but didn't hold up too well. After a few wears, they started to come apart."
3.0,"The colors were a little off, but my kids like them. The pink is more of a neon salmon and the solid blue is teal. They are super thin, almost like a thick pair of tights. It allows air to freely blow through them...."
3.0,Its just ok. Its good for the price.  It bunches on the hip area and the material has an odd shine to it. Ill wear it with jeans or leggings with a sweater.
3.0,"The skirt is really really short.  I'm a size 7/8, 5' 6&#34; and it covered maybe half my butt.  I wore it with leggings for the color run (I bought white).  It was fine for the price.  I was expecting something a bit longer though.  I also found it snug around my hips/waist.  Many people posted that as a size 16, it fit fine.  I would disagree.  My thin 9 year old daughter was able to wear it comfortably.  It was TIGHT on me."
3.0,I love this dress but the stitching is popping everywhere. Had to super glue the straps back together. But super sexy!
3.0,Two inches smaller than advertised as these are only 13”. Sturdy bags but I really needed the larger size. I decided to keep these because I can still use but I’m disappointed.
3.0,BEWARE!!!<br /> This product is not made by Swarovski...I found out the hard way.
3.0,"I'm not quite sure how to rate this coin purse. The quality and colors were as expected based on my previous Vera Bradley purchases. However, even though the overall size is similar to my old Vera Bradley Double Kiss Coin Purse (the one with the mini Kiss coin purse inside), the frame on this one is too small and would only allow a couple of credit cards to be placed inside (the frame on the Double Kiss is rounded and extends further down the side of the bag). I could FORCE more cards in, but then they were nearly impossible to get back out. Really just not useable to carry credit cards and loyalty cards. Though to be fair, it doesn't really state in the description that it's intended use was for credit cards; I just assumed they'd fit based on the overall size and similarity to my old Double Kiss Coin Purse."
3.0,holds shirt down very uncomfortable
3.0,"They are cute, but shed like crazy! Out of package lots of strings coming off. They are cute stocking stuffers, but I have high doubts  about them holding up very long"
3.0,I got one cable will not open
3.0,"These are tights and see through. I don’t know if it makes a difference that I bought white. I plan to wear them under short dresses so it’s fine, I don’t mind that people can see me knees though them, though I really wanted white leggings. You can only wear them under something unless you want people to see though them, but I know I don’t."
3.0,"I'm giving it a 3star because the quality was what I expected but the SIZE was ridiculous.  My daughter is a petite women's small and it barely fit her.  My son in law is a true medium sometimes small in men's,  so this being the size of a BOYS 16-18 with sleeves too short for any normal man, was truly offensive.  I now have No gift for my son in law for Christmas and I am handicap, hence the online ordering."
3.0,"These soccer slippers were true to color and the soccer ball was sharp looking.  The slippers were very narrow, and my Grandson is a very skinny little guy, somewhat on the small side and very hard to keep on.  Not sure if I would by again."
3.0,"Nice quality.  Lined.  Runs 1 size small, so size up."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Shoes are really cute, but cheaply made. When you buckle them, the silver finish comes off very easily and the clear/true color of the shoe shows"
3.0,these r super cute and have my favorite little egg man but they are so tight around my ankle I can't wear them for too long. also after like 2 weeks of wear one of the pairs has a hole in the heel so aaaaa
3.0,"I like that when wearing them others can see my eyes and don’t think I’m blind. I am supposed to wear UV protection if outside in daylight hours. They don’t have enough protection on sunny days, when one would expect the dark sunglasses anyway, but these are great on cloudy or rainy days."
3.0,ok gift
3.0,"It's a nice, well made sports bra, but I'm petite and it was too large.  I  really didn't think it would help to get a smaller size.  It seemed ill-fitting to me at 5'4"" and 110 lbs.  It comes with extra cups, and generally is quite nice.  Update:  I liked the item very much, so I tried the small and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Very flattering and a high quality sports bra I now highly recommend!"
3.0,The nose piece is very hard and cut into my nose.
3.0,See through and the cut is a little awkward. Not a fan
3.0,"If you are plus sized, give up on these adorable overalls. The largest size doesn't come near baggy. It fits normally, but that's not what I am looking for here. Customer service were reluctant to work with me, but were persuaded."
3.0,Nice blouse but runs small
3.0,I am a 38C and normally a large in 98% of clothing and this was way too small. I ordered the XL just in case and that did not fit well either. It did not fit over my chest with a bra on. I did like the material but very thin. Ok as a beach cover up.
3.0,I love the fit but there is small hole in the crutch.<br />I am 5'6&#34; and 189 lbs so I ordered a large. The large fits well and the length is perfect.
3.0,"Per the reviews I went up two sizes but it is too large. I would recommend going up maybe one size for breathing room, or get your size if you want it snug."
3.0,Sadly these were too small for me....super cute but too small. The waist band could barely fit around my thigh and I orderd a large(because I'm around 150 pounds and have thick thighs)
3.0,"This is a cute suit, and the rushing can hide flaws.  The high neck and keyhole is actually pretty revealing.  However, this is a pretty thin suit.  It doesn't have the structure or feel of some more expensive one piece suits.  It is quite stretchy, and there isn't a lot of support.  I'm fairly short and had to really shorten the ties too much  to get this to not be long and droopy. I do like the cut of the legs - not frumpy but not too high, either.  I use a pool quite a bit so this suit will go into my rotation, but if it is your only suit, I think you'd be better off to look a bit more."
3.0,These are beautiful! They are just too big for my face. So much longer and bigger than expected.
3.0,"So, this is cute but, and I will be keeping it but, since the point of me getting it was I need more sweaters and it ISN'T a sweater or sweatshirt, I am disappointed.  This is, at best, an extra thick t-shirt. It is not a thick and cozy sweater or sweatshirt material as I had hoped. So, if that is what you are looking for, keep looking. If you are looking for a very light long-sleeved shirt, you will love this."
3.0,Cute dress. Fabric is thin...So it becomes see-through if stretched at all.
3.0,Holds everything but key ring broke off instantly
3.0,Had to return. Too small. Not as shown
3.0,"These are really pretty earrings! However, the clip-on part bends and is easily disformed. Would we good for a one time event (like prom.)"
3.0,Ok. Little thinner than thought
3.0,"The material itself is very nice! Stretchy and not too thick or thin. BUT, after one wear the inner seams started unraveling and there's already a hole that I'll have to sow up. I wasn't doing any intense workout either, so that was a bit disappointing. If I didn't have to worry about that seam issue I'd buy more pairs, but not if they were all sown together weakly"
3.0,They fit somewhat big on my 8 year old.
3.0,"This is a cute dress and I really wanted to like it. However, it just didn’t fit my body type well. The ruffles made my hips look much wider than they are and it was not flattering. My neighbor friend loved it and bought it from me before I could return it. It looked cute on her frame (no hips) and I’m glad it worked out for her. It just didn’t fit me the way I was hoping. For reference, I’m 5’4” and 120lbs. I usually wear a small or medium in clothes. (4/6 in pants) I hope this is helpful!"
3.0,I'm 175cm 75kg. I ordered XL.  waist loose but  calf  tight.
3.0,Glue was dried out which made the glitter tattoo not last more than an hour or two.
3.0,"I will enjoy wearing these earrings,"
3.0,"The coat itself is very nice. Very pretty and the liner is removable if you just want to go with a lighter jacket. My issue was the sizing. I ordered the largest size they had feeling that it may run smaller due to the size chart differences from U.S and Asia sizing. Unfortunately, even though I order a coat that should have run 2 sizes bigger I couldn't fit the sleeves over my arms. Though Amazon offered free returns with the coat I was not applicable to me because it wasn't shipped inside the 50 states. I will have to pay to return this Jacket. Which isn't really worth the money to return.  So I'll have to find someone that can fit into it. What a shame... I was really looking forward to wearing the coat."
3.0,"loved this set for my 3 year old daughter. however the color of the shorts was a bit different than the picture. the pink of the shorts is different than the pink in the top so it doesn't really match,. I still kept it and put her on her with different tops/bottoms."
3.0,This is a really cute top but I'm 6 feet tall so its a little short for me but overall the quality is good and it is really cute... I love babydoll type tops
3.0,Way too short in front.
3.0,I love aquamarine stones. These were extremely small. Alot of them were just slivers and I just threw them away.<br />I was expecting a little more volume to them.<br />Maybe worth 1/2 if what I paid for them.<br />Picture sure throws you off. Thats not what you get
3.0,"It is a cute bag but it was the wrong color and significantly bigger than I originally thought it would be. More like a purse than a clutch. I ordered the bag that appeared to be blush pink. The color was listed as beige, which it indeed is beige, but the picture was misconceiving because it looked blush pink. Anyway...its cute, but i wish it was the color in the picture and a smaller."
3.0,Kinda flimsy but cute
3.0,Shoes are so cute! But unfortunately they run small so I had to return them. Size up Atleast a half size. If not a full one size up.
3.0,Great looking but too . I wear 10.5 to 11 shoe sixe. small to be useful
3.0,Not the best Quality for the money 💵
3.0,"I'm 5'7&#34; & 130lbs & usually wear a S or M. I ordered this in a M & you can see some under boob. I really like the straps so I'm keeping it. I would order the large but it's more expensive & it's no that it doesn't fit, it's just that the cups are a little small. It's possible there might be a nip slip with this but it's so cute I can't bring myself to return it."
3.0,"Beautiful color (purple). Only three stars because once it's on, it's on. Latch does not work as Advertised. I took my white Samsung S2 off to put my new purple on, but accidentally put them on the wrong side. After a lot of hassle, got one side off, but still can't get the other off. Now both my thumbs are sore. Gave up, I'll make it work, but I shouldn't need to give up on a brand new purchase.  Will not buy another band from this manufacturer."
3.0,"Soft and nice, but also not very form fitting."
3.0,The sleeves were really cute. I’m a small to a medium depending on the style. I ordered a med and it fit like a small or smaller. The shirt was a thin ribbed material which cheapened it a little. If it fit I would have kept it but I won’t order a larger size. I’m disappointed because I like the sleeves. I’m a 34D and 138 5’4”. I am short waisted and it only came to just below the button on my jeans.  If I had a little flatter of a stomach it would’ve been OK and I would’ve worked with it but it didn’t work for me.
3.0,El material es una tela muy simple y delgados.
3.0,"I had my eye on this robe for awhile. It is very pretty, silky and comes with a nice sash-like belt. However, this robe is very lightweight and suitable for warm weather wear.  The robe is also a bit expensive for what it is.  I don't feel it was worth the $78.00 I paid for it."
3.0,Not the best quality. Feather fall off here and there but only needed it for Halloween day/night so it held up enough for that.
3.0,Looks great and they don't slip through but don't take it off or it will be difficult to get back on.
3.0,"This is a nice case, but it is not square like the photos; it is 20x30 like the text."
3.0,"This is an interesting costume piece. Has two lights, one on each side. It comes included with extra 2032 batteries to install into the glasses.<br /><br />On each side, you toggle the button to change between the light settings. It's simple, but you have to press it A LOT to find the light mode you want or to just turn off.<br /><br />The glasses I got have some cloudy imperfections near the center, that shows up in pictures due to the light diffusion."
3.0,Pretty earrings<br />Seller please contact
3.0,Nice fabric but runs very large.
3.0,Quite a bit smaller than I was expecting but still good pieces. Variety of color
3.0,i love Kipling and i love this specific model (have it in different color)  but for some wired reason this time it didn't have side pocket
3.0,"I work in a restuarant and bought these for my uniform. I'm constantly walking, bending and reaching a lot at work, so I really needed something that moved well with me and the stretch in this fabric is perfect. Since I'm 4'8&#34; with a 27&#34; inseam, the hem is pretty low on me, but I dont mind the length. Satisfied so far.<br /><br />Edit: quality update! The elastic fibers have become exposed due to major pilling in the thigh and crotch area. Its hard to say if this would happen with someone whose thighs do not touch, though. I expect to have to replace these pants in a month or so - not really worth the price tag for me."
3.0,I am in love but the band lost one gem within less than a month of wear so now I only wear one. But its sooo pretty!
3.0,Was hoping to use this as summer dress but material too thin. Kept for going to the beach. Very cute and good for cost.
3.0,"Was just like an ordinary black long sleeve shirt ,didn't hang much at all i had to alter it a little to have hang the way it looked on the picture.  Im a medium /large i ordered an extra large thinking that would do the trick but it didn't."
3.0,It was okay just disappointing. It was not a vibrant red like the picture<br /><br />Some wrinkles in fabric<br />It will do
3.0,"Used these to climb the cables at Half Dome in Yosemite. They got the job done, but were completely torn up by the time I got down. I don't know how they'd last on other endeavors, but they were a one and out on that one. Not sure what other use you could use them for either. They're quite hot. I can't imagine working out with them."
3.0,"but were it rubs metal against metal it peels the rose color off and you're left with the steel color metal, which is not pleasing.  The rubber cover is a waste.  When I put it on the watch would not respond to touch at all so I took it off and put it in the trash.  I'm still wearing the band so it is functional, but just not as aesthetically pretty."
3.0,"after wearing it for some time, it has a big deal of scratches and most importantly it is yellowish now."
3.0,"chose size according to size chart, thought it would be a little loose but it’s pretty tight. good quality!"
3.0,"So I bought this bra for high impact running and I have large boobs. I get self conscious at the gym if I feel I bounce too much. This bra is very comfortable, well padded. I sometimes wear it even when I’m not working out. It’s easy to put on, but as far as high impact running,I’d go with some thing a little more like a racerback."
3.0,"This is not the same style of watchband that I purchased at the PX during basic training at Fort Benning. I mean, it works, but it's a little less comfortable. There are some areas where the plastic nylon has been burned that itch the skin. Otherwise, it does what it says."
3.0,I have received many compliments on this shirt and I also bought the teal color with the white writing. Although I must add that if you wear a medium buy large because it's a bit of a snug fit. I will not return it's just food for thought on my next Aeropostale purchase.
3.0,Cheap but as expected.
3.0,IT'S OKAY!
3.0,They are okay for the price still look a little cheap.
3.0,"The robe fits well and the material is the perfect weight, but the sleeves are much more flared than they appear in the picture. Returned it because the sleeves would get in the way."
3.0,"The glove is well made to the point that it’ll keep you warm a cold temperatures. The problem is the the gloves are not flexible at all, it’s difficult to grab something specifically your phone. I wish they would be more flexible to be able to do more things with them on."
3.0,"I like the mask, don't like the sweating around nose and mouth."
3.0,Good quality but a little small. Will try to reorder in a larger size
3.0,I got 2 of the same one. Other than that they are beautiful.
3.0,"My son wanted this however it wasn’t really red, it was pinkish and he wasn’t too excited to have a pinkish ring"
3.0,"simple, does not come like this. You have to wrap it yourself this way"
3.0,They’re really pretty but I can’t wear them. The stem is too big for my piercing hole.
3.0,"These tanks are cheap, and like to hang on to all of the sweat you put out. Always wet."
3.0,Didn’t think they were worth all that money but they are cute. Faded really fast in like 3 washes.
3.0,"I would recommend you go a size down, fits big."
3.0,Not fitted!
3.0,These were fine at first but recently ripped at the seams and fell apart. Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,This fit way tighter than I was expecting
3.0,"Nicely made, fairly warm but way too long in each and every finger. This makes dexterity a non starter. Might as well wear mittens. Fold over fingertips adversely affect touch screen capabilities"
3.0,It was not as classy looking as I had hoped. It seemed like a good quality product but not what I was hoping for. Ended up giving it as a gift to an older relative.
3.0,Much longer that expected
3.0,These were way too heavy. It made me sad because I loved the design. Had to return them because they hurt my ears with how much they weigh.
3.0,"they are nice sunglasses, I really like the amber lens, but they are a little small for my head, 7&5/8s.  so they slide forward and I end up pushing them up. nice glasses, especially for the price, but not for a big ole head."
3.0,"This band looks really great, it’s made of leather with some very neatly placed stitching in a contrasting color along the edges. The fastening mechanism is a little unusual, you have to slip the watch on your wrist, fasten one side, then fasten the other side and push the strap end through the two loops. To remove the watch you depress two buttons that unsnap the mechanism, and there lies the problem. I’ve only worn it one day and the mechanism came unsnapped at least 10 times. Sometimes I heard it unsnap and other times I just felt the watch get really loose. It happens whenever I tilt my hand downward, my wrist and forearm pinch the watchband buttons enough to unsnap the mechanism. It’s really annoying and why I docked it two stars on the review. It’s a shame because it really is an attractive band."
3.0,"I was very excited for this outfit and maybe that's why I was also kind of disappointed. It fits as expected but it is cheaply made. The fabric itself isn't bad but the way it sewn is just not up to par for me. The top where you adjust the straps has plastic pieces, which are cheap and awful. I wanted to love it or feel like I can pull it off but I will be returning it. It's not for me."
3.0,Looks like prison shoes in person. I have a pair similar in black and they look more expensive
3.0,"They are just ok. Not very stylish for a lady, though."
3.0,It stays on fine but doesn't stay cool.  Both kids have it a thumbs down ☹️
3.0,"Le doy 3 estrellas porque el escote no es como en la foto, es mas alto, voy a llevarlo a arreglar porque me gustó la tela, la terminación, la talla es la correcta. Quedara mas lindl si tuviera el escote correcto."
3.0,A little disappointed! This shirt is paper thin almost see through when held up to room light.
3.0,Cute but rough material
3.0,"Plus and Negatives.<br />Plus - The watch construction is great. The materials are high quality. Good looking watch.<br /><br />Negatives - The caliber is bad. I lose 1 minute every 4 days. No screw down crown, Lume is not great primarily due to the small markers.<br /><br />For almost $400.00 the caliber should be great. There should be a screw down crown.<br /><br />I do not recommend this watch or others that are similar. You need a special screw driver to even attempt to work on it. The strap is not replaceable."
3.0,Nice shoes for kids my son loved them but the lights came off at the second time he use them! :(
3.0,I took heed to the reviews I've read and ordered two sizes up from my normal size. It was still too small BUT the reason why it's getting three stars instead of one is that I'm on a weight loss journey and I'm sure it's going to fit as I slim down more.
3.0,"Very cute, quality made, but not sized for a kid! Sizing is great for me, an adult, so my daughter was a tad disappointed."
3.0,Needed to buy a smaller size
3.0,No point on the pin so it would not go through the fabric 🤔<br />Cute broach. Wish I could wear it on my clothes. Will most likely glue it to a hat and just keep it.
3.0,"This bathing suit is not made of compression material, so it’s not very flattering. I wanted something that was going to hold me in."
3.0,"I tagged this product as somewhat small because even though I ordered a size up, it was still awkwardly tight across my chest. It was cute otherwise."
3.0,"These are not rubber, they are a weird foam material. Still work Okay for by the pool, just not in the pool like I needed them for."
3.0,I got the XXL based on the reviews and to size up- ladies! Do not size up! Stick to your size. I'm usually 12/14 and I should have gotten the L. I'm 5'7 ans 210 lbs and they swam on me. They fit more like a 20. Cute print and well made just too large and that's on me because I went by the reviews.
3.0,It’s cute but I thought I would have more colors like the picture in it I guess when the light hits it it will have those colors but without the light hitting it it looks white
3.0,It's ok. Looks nicer in the photo than in person. It is an adjustable chord. More suitable for a keychain than a charm in my opinion.
3.0,I like the shoe/boot comfortable and not too heavy but the pull loops broke almost immediately.  What a pain literally when the loops broke it left a protrusion that rubs the Achilles area of the foot
3.0,These glasses are for big heads not medium. The plastics lens is smaller than i saw.
3.0,"I absolutely LOVE the bottoms, they fit great and are so flattering. The top on the other hand is sooo oversized, and looks poorly made. Even with some extra pads to give me some lift, was not enough to fill out this top. Too bad, will return."
3.0,The drawstring isn’t real! It’s sewn on! The low cut makes them uncomfortably fall atriums your cheeks during sleep. And all bc they lied about it being a drawstring!!!!!
3.0,But the stitching on the waist elastic is coming apart after 2 washings.
3.0,These were really nice but they did not fit my 11 yr old he has a small face and they didn't stretch hardly any the material was really nice ok thickness and they were a silky sheer cloth everything was great except for the fact that they were too small 😑
3.0,Arms are longer then legs. Weird fit
3.0,"The nosepiece is indeed on the marble part which doesn’t really bother me. It comes with a filter that is easy to insert. The straps are easy to adjust and comfortable. The mask is a decent size and full coverage. It is NOT glittery or shiny at all, just a rose gold and sand coloring."
3.0,Super cute and the fit was nice but the fabric was cheap and see through so I returned it
3.0,I have a 38DD and it didn't fit well at all
3.0,"This is a great product if you have the body for it. It is too snug and revealing for my ""Dad Bod""."
3.0,adorable shirt just ran small
3.0,I usually wear a xl however this xl is more like an xxxlarge.<br />When ordering...order a size or two smaller than what you wear.
3.0,It’s cute and well made. But it has seams that hit me in all the wrong places. Didn’t like the fit on me. Maybe on someone else.
3.0,"Top fit okay, but the bottoms were way too small. Bought for my daughter who has always fitted perfectly into any small size swim suit. Afraid to return to get a larger size and then the top would be too big. She just wears the top with another suit bottom."
3.0,its liked is all i can say
3.0,Disappointed with fabric - flimsy. Proportions were off. Waist was high/short which made dress short.
3.0,"The actual hoodie is vibrant, a really pretty pink, and is comfortable! The screen-printing, however, feels more like a sticker and arrived with some edges already lifting. I don't mind too much but I wasn't super thrilled, either. After a few washes, I fear it may start coming up at the edges."
3.0,"Great glasses if you can stand wearing them for longer than 5 min. The nose piece is very uncomfortable and makes wearing the glasses painful. If you buy the glasses be sure to also buy a pain reliever, you're going to need it."
3.0,"I purchased the same exact pair back in April and love them. I ordered another pair so I could have backup. The newest pair, I’ve had issues with one of the lenses popping out constantly. I don’t see any issue with the frame itself so I’m not sure why the lease pops. I’m assuming it’s just a defective pair so I’ll have to buy another and trash these guys.<br /><br />Let’s hope this new pair, I have better luck with!"
3.0,"Not quite what I expected. Quality was not as I thought it would be. Ends were a little cheap looking. I have tried to wear the scarf as shown, but it looks more like a blanket than a wrap."
3.0,"These are interesting. They do fit, they are good quality, well made pantyhose (or tights) that are footless. I am unsure what to do with these. I cant see using with shoes that you can tell are footless..Maybe I am just not fashionable enough! I will prob use with a dress and my booties.<br /><br />Amazon will donate to your favorite charity!

3.0,supose to be smaller
3.0,"Nice fabric, and design but they definitely run small."
3.0,Loved it and it looks a lot like the picture but it comes in very small. I ordered a medium and I am usually a small but I saw other reviews saying it was too tight. This is very true as the medium I received is a little snug. Hate to order sizes that aren't what I normally get on account of being afraid that they are too big but if I were to order again I would definitely buy a large.
3.0,"they are nice BUT had the lens jutting out of the frame,so worried they may fall out."
3.0,"I liked the frame in itself, especially the wide temples, which help keep sun off the sides but the len is a bit too light, would like it a bit darker but still nice looking sunglasses and you definitely can't beat the price."
3.0,wanted earrings a little larger.
3.0,"Very comfortable, fit is pretty accurate. However, it's not blue, it's VERY teal.  Definitely more of a green than a blue.  It doesn't work for the outfit I'm putting together, but I'm keeping the pants because they are pretty and comfortable.  Hoping the bright blue is a better fit color-wise."
3.0,"This is truly a bangle bracelet, meaning It is not flexible at all as the pandora bracelets are. I was unable to get it on my wrist.  I would have kept it if I could get it on."
3.0,Broke before I got to wear them. Cheaply made but they were cute for five minutes
3.0,"Whit on white was skeptical, I was right, they look weird. They move around a lot. They dont look straight. Will look for a better one. It's not terrible, it's just not for me."
3.0,"I am a size 16 and ordered XLarge.  The body of the shirt may actually fit; however, the sleeves and span across the shoulders are maybe a size 12. Cute top and nice quality, but manufacturer needs to rethink their sizes."
3.0,"This was way too small. The 2x fit more like an XL.  Also, the fabric is very thin and see-through. Would have loved to keep the set as it is a pretty print  and would be nice to have the matching robe, but unfortunately I had to return it."
3.0,Great for diaper bag and even regular use.
3.0,"Nice dress and comfy for the florida heat but it does run about 2 sizes to small, the stretch isn't fantastic either it sorta sticks to ya."
3.0,"Make sure you know you're likely going to get ONE random selection from the 3 pins shown.  The picture should make that more clear.<br /><br />Pins should use 2 spikes, One spike just makes it spin upside down or sideways."
3.0,I loved it. But it was too small for me. I had to give it away and order another one.
3.0,"Feels great, looks great. 3 stars tho because I ordered the shorts and sport bra set and got pants instead. Not enough time for a return and reship before needing it."
3.0,This runs big (and I have C cups!) so instead of having the shirt tie in the front I crossed the ties and had it tie in the back and it was really cute!
3.0,This is super cute but fits tiny. Short length. Even the head hole is tight. I'll try next size up.
3.0,"I picked this up after spilling and staining my leather band with beer. Good for bike rides too, anything sweaty. But one of the bands tore between the attachment post and the little lever to install it. It's a small section of silicon so it tears easily, but the band is still functional and you can't see it. The material takes a little getting used to on your skin."
3.0,"Soft material, but the top felt constricting and the sleeves were short."
3.0,The top broke fairly easy
3.0,Very thin material basically see through can not wear unless it’s with leggings and an under shirt
3.0,"Idk about these pants. For one, the ankles are a bit too wide for joggers… more like loungers. Definitely too odd to wear out. Perfect and comfy to wear in the house. I bought these for my bf who is 6’1 and if the ankles were tighter they may have fit a bit better. Buy them if u want nice pants to wear in ur backyard."
3.0,"Ordered a size up, and they are still super tight. I know compression stockings are not supposed to be loose, but these are quite difficult to get on/off. They also leave marks on my skin for days after taking them off. They do help the aches in my calves from my 2-3 mile daily walks but because of the issues stated above, I can't wear them very often."
3.0,I usually get my son a medium at Target but this medium was too big. A preferred sizing issue! The print is also not very crisp but he is thrilled with it.
3.0,"I've seen reviews and recommendations on this brand,  comparing them to Injiji. I'm a big hiker - which is why I took the chance. IMO, there is no comparison. These are thinner and not as sturdy.  They would make a great liner or for every day wear, definitely not for a hiker unless you use it as a liner. Decent quality for normal wear and I'd buy again for that reason only. Does have the compression middle,  not as tight as Injiji or Adidas compression,  too loose to be stable support for some of us that abuse our feet with sports, hiking,  climbing,  etc. Love the colors,  bright just like the Pic.  Soft material."
3.0,If you  have built shoulders don’t buy it . It pretty
3.0,"This is an attractive piece of costume jewelry. I have downgraded it because the necklace came in pieces. Every time I hooked the pieces together, all I had to do was lean forward slightly and all the discs came apart. Since it appears to have been made of some type of metal, my son tightened the hooks so it would all remain in one piece."
3.0,"Earrings were super cute, larger than I thought. But three in a pack, Wow!!"
3.0,These shoes fit great and my daughter enjoys wearing them. My only complaint is how dirty they looked after the very first wear. We live in Oklahoma where the dirt is red but I had hoped I could at least wash the stains out. I wouldn’t buy this shoe again.
3.0,So once the vest is on it does it’s job. The o lay issue is getting the zipper up. Zipper is really flimsy so it is hard to zip up. Other than that it works well. True to size
3.0,This is a stocking stuffer for my adult son... I have a pair similar but they can be worn on head or made smaller for neck.. these only expand for the neck... I wouldn't care for them for me but he probably will like and for the price what the heck... they are fluffy and probably will be good enough.
3.0,"Item is satisfactory  for the price.  Shipped in cheap, thin, plastic sleeve.  But still good for 9 year old granddaughter."
3.0,"A little on the thin side and after one wash, the ends frayed a bit"
3.0,"I would have given this product five stars, but the darts where chest/bra area should be are too high up, indicating this dress was meant for &#34;Petite&#34; sizing for short-waisted people, not Regular sizing. That said, I am typically a Large or XL (size 12-14), and I ordered the XL because I assumed this would be coming from China. The XL was a little loose, but not in a bad way. I kept it and am repurchasing a Large. For $15, you can't go wrong. The material is stretchy, and the velvet is soft (but not a silk velvet; probably a poly blend) and stretchy. It is not quite as blue-black as in the photo - it is a true Royal to Dark Blue."
3.0,"Super cheap.  Lasted one summer swim season (6 weeks) before becoming completely stretched out and see-through (almost instantly - from normal to falling apart, literally in the space of a shower after practice).  I wouldn't expect much more from a suit that is so inexpensive.  I would probably still get it again next year, maybe 2, for another round of summer swim team."
3.0,"Different sleeves, different skirt cut. I ordered a large, I am 5,5&#34; 150 lbs and fits me great but only with high heels which is how i intended to wear it. I was disapponted with the skirt cut, it is a straight cut which makes it look like im wearing a robe. I hoped it did that assymetrical cut that's shown in the pictures :("
3.0,"you have to be just right to fit this shirt, the sleeveless side will make or break this for you, and the bottom was ballooned out more then expected.  Once again, good deal on price tho."
3.0,"bought these as gifts. they look beautiful in the pictures, and pretty good in person. but the clasp does not work well and the packaging was damaged, which makes it difficult to present as a gift. will have to return"
3.0,I choose the wrong size when ordering so it was a little big. We were able to adjust straps and make fit. Looks great on herv
3.0,"The dress is lovely, fit me great in the waist and bust, but was quite a bit shorter than the images. A large fit me more like a midi at 5’7”."
3.0,appears to be child size.
3.0,face of the watch is hard to see since it is on a blue background. it is pretty but the numbers need to be made to stand out more.
3.0,"I didn't think the overall sizing was bad, but it wasn't the most flattering pattern. With such structured material you could get a figure out of it at least. Anyway, it was very cute but overall wasn't super flattering and the glove cuffs were sewn on backward so those looked funny and kept falling down. The shoulders also fall down but you can pin them to the green top to make them stay."
3.0,See headline above .Intended to wear socks when traveling but band created around upper leg  when sock folded over so they won't be tight on back of leg. Heavier than described.
3.0,Colors are great. i just don't understand crocs sizes.  i bought a toddler size 10 for my 3-year-old who wears size 10 perfectly now. They are too big for her.  i would say crocs size 10 would be size 12 for other shoes.  my daughter can't  lift her feet when she walks or the shoes will slip off.  i miss polliwalks.  they are more true to size.
3.0,Pretty dress but runs really small.
3.0,"The quality is without question. I ordered the wallet for its second I'd slot, mine did not come with such. The wallet I received opens like a diary!! Wish I got the on in the picture."
3.0,It's much thinner than I expected.  Nice sweater though.
3.0,The plate tend to be very small and would be better on a child's shoe.
3.0,It is very nice but too heavy.  It doesn't feel very comfortable in it.  I think I'll give it back even though I really like it.
3.0,Nice design and brought back memories of the days before Netflix! It's a bit small but I would suggest the manufacturer to use a stronger chain. It will break.
3.0,"Did not fit as expected. It was too big!!. I have noticed that I don't always get it right with the size for this seller. I am a size 12-14 but sometimes I fit better in Large, and sometimes in XXL or 2XL. I am going to return this one."
3.0,They were just a little short for my tall guy.
3.0,A bit too large and thin. It looks good but not as fit and fancy as I hope it would be.
3.0,"The dress construction is fine (not great, but not terrible), and neither color I ordered seems to be see-through (black and dark mint). However, this dress runs SHORT. I’m 5’3, and the medium hits about an inch above my ankle."
3.0,I have the aerie crossover flares and these are similar but the crotch is baggy and they are an inch shorter. Other than that they’re good.
3.0,"Quality is very good, colors are awsome but, a bit short for me. I am 5' 8&#34; and 155 lbs with athletic build. I would order a large next time but, overall they are great for workouts."
3.0,Not a womens large.  More like a medium.
3.0,"I'm 5'2, with chest about 34B and I ordered a small.  The zipper on the side and waist area was perfect; however, the bust area was way too large.  Since it's not a wrap over dress, if I bend down then you're able to see my bra.  Additionally, the dress is slightly longer than depicted on the model.  If you're petite with large breasts, then this dress will probably fit you better!"
3.0,"I have a few TB watches.  This one is very nice too.  It's a little bigger than I thought but still a nice watch.  High Quality, very nice band."
3.0,"I would probably not recommend you buy it unless you have a body like the model. Plus size just doesn't fit right. The straps that look so cool just roll under:( I had to sew the top shoulder straps because they were too loose and didn't hold you up, but the part that went around your waist was snug and a bit painful. Oh well... I tried. It looked cool"
3.0,The material is great and soft. I bought  it to personalize it for my daughter. I’m not giving it full stars because she wore it yesterday for the 1st time and the zipper came unzipped like split from the bottom to about middle . 🤦‍♀️. I was able to re-zip it but it still unzips if not careful.  My advise if you are going to personalize like I did try it before putting anything on it. So you can return it
3.0,"Comes with white curly hair, rainbow bangs and silver horn and ears.<br />The bangs are very un-even and the hair falls out, the cap is too tight and not adjustable.<br />Maybe this is a really long wig fit for a child?<br />With Halloween 30 days away, I guess I'll just use it for my rainbow unicorn costume- the purple, pink and blue one has the same issues."
3.0,synthetic feel fabric. I would not even consider it knit. The design and fabric are nothing like the image but its kind of the same idea? its not loose nor has any texture like the image. It is also a sand color.
3.0,"Very short! I’m not going to return it because it looks cute with leggings and boots, but I was hoping to wear it as a dress. Material is thicker than I thought it would be."
3.0,Ordered the black w. White flowers...l received the navy blue with beige flowers...disappointed!
3.0,Bought the 9 mm studs.  Nice size. Wish the stems were a tiny bit longer to accommodate thicker ear lobs some of us have.  The backs are nothing to be happy about. I had an extra pair Purchased at a jewelry store so I’ll use those.
3.0,Packaged in a vacuum sealed bag and very wrinkled and a strange odor. After washing the smell is gone but still wrinkled.  Hopefully the wrinkles come out hanging it up.
3.0,Its a little small.
3.0,I am not overly excited about these. I will probably give them to grandchildren. They are not my idea of what an adult wears for sunglasses. I have only worn two of them a total of two times since I purchased them. They don't provide the sunscreen protection that I need from sunglasses.
3.0,"It's good for the money... it is inexpensive... but... it looks it. The bezel looks cheap. The edges are a bit sharp. Don't let me discourage you though, but I have some Chinese Homage type watches that are in the same price range that I feel are better made. I was hoping it would be nicer with a quality level above the low price. So I give it 3 stars, meaning it ain't bad but not some kind of excellent value."
3.0,This dress was supposed to come with a belt as described and it did not. It just arrived and there is no belt. I went to order another and now they’re out of stock.
3.0,Very pretty<br />Too small<br />I did use them as a gift
3.0,The trainer is a perfect fit but the closures however are very sharp and have scratched me pretty good on my arms and are very snagging. The imitation leather should have been cloth instead.
3.0,Lot elegant on the picture than in hand.
3.0,The dress did not look like the picture. I thought it was more dressy. It is very casual.
3.0,These are large bags.  Best use would be for more lightweight items - certainly not laundry detergent and canned goods together.  Great beach bag.
3.0,"I love the design of the shirt, but the sizes run very small."
3.0,Siding attachment snapped off while swimming
3.0,Kinda cheap.
3.0,I loved how quickly the shipping was and how affordable it was. But the quality is very cheap. Looks like it will break in a few weeks. The faux diamonds look like can fall off at any moment
3.0,Cheaply made but it's still cute would suggest
3.0,"Recieved this yesterday. It is a decent bracelet, nice weight to it, charms are cool and related to the series. But the book is a bible, which isn't a big deal but nit really valud so that isn't great. I would probably give it 3.5 stars ifvthat were an option."
3.0,This bag is sturdy and I like the storage.  The only thing wrong with the bag is the lining is black and one does not easily see the compartments and what you are looking for without an extra effort.  The interior should be changed to a lighter color.
3.0,I wear a size 12 and it is almost too small. It will work with a cami but not a long sleeve shirt.
3.0,I like the glasses shape and feel. BUT THEY DO NOT  CHANGE  no matter what light level. That was the whole reason I bought them. Very disappointing. I  am not going to return them because I guess I have another pair of sun glasses.
3.0,"Got these for $15, not bad for the price. If you really want a good pair though it might be worth the extra $20 to get a known brand"
3.0,Was not genuine leather. The sides are white adding to that conclusion. Lol. It's a cute design.
3.0,"Cute design, cheap, fun novelty gift for kids.  My daughters really liked theirs.  The metal finish on the silver heart is a little bubbled/rough on two of the three necklaces I ordered.  Otherwise the rest is about the quality I expected for $2.50."
3.0,"Great backup or replacement strap for that sub $50.00 diver you keep trying to decide what strap to go with. If you are skilled you can make this fit a 20mm lugged watch.  Beware - this Zuludiver is not as long (lengthwise) as the Seiko Original &#34;Monster&#34; Diver Strap, so if you are like me and have large wrists I would recommend looking for something a bit longer, these comfortably fit an 8 inch wrists, maybe even 8.5.  Seriously doubt it will last as long as a Seiko brand &#34;wave&#34; strap - but who knows????  Nice buckle, nice keeper, just comes up a little short on length for my 9.5 inch wrists, even on a 45mm case - but that's just me. Also worth a mention, it's a tad stiffer compound than many of its counterparts. This is in a different universe from 100% silicone - don't be fooled - it's hardish stiff rubber compound, design does not &#34;breath&#34; as well as many others of similar type rubber straps."
3.0,"Cons: One of the clips didn't close all the way so it kept on slipping off. Had to cut it off so it didn't just dangle.<br /><br />Pros: The other 3 clips however worked perfectly, and stayed on after a night of dancing.<br /><br />I just wish the straps were longer so it had more customization on the length/slack. On hindsight I wish I bought the ones that attach to your thigh rather than the foot strap ones. When you sit down it seems to pull the fabric on the other side of your knee which was a little uncomfortable and noticeable."
3.0,Was not long enough and thigh area was not wide enough
3.0,Honestly it looks okay I wasn't that impressed
3.0,"I got the medium and I need to return it and try the small. I'm 5'10, 135lbs, 36C bust, and thin athletic build. I sized up due to reviews and that it may have a &#34;vintage&#34; fit... nope! It's hanging off me! So unflattering! I've added two photos and one, I'm holding in The sides. The arms are super loose too.  The colors are nice but the lace is very thick. It's definitely got an antique feel."
3.0,"PROS: this hat is definitely lightweight and it provides a great deal of sun protection on the face.<br />The item description and photos aren’t always matching - one says all nylon, while another says ‘cotton material’. I was looking for something cotton, but it seems this is nylon. However, there is nice absorbent padding at the forehead and all around where it touches the head, which is what I need because I’m using it while exercising. I will say that it’s my fault for not noticing the description/pic info didn’t match, but since I still like the sun/sweat coverage, I don’t really don’t care what the material is.<br />CONS: I will say I was disappointed because the wind/chin strap doesn’t detach. There are multiple pics showing the hat on a model and no strap in sight. I didn’t want to cut it off because sometimes I may need it, so I ‘fixed’ this by putting it over the top of my head and feeding it through the travel loop on back.<br />It looks stupid, but isn’t bugging me when I don’t need it.<br />This also has ‘breathable’ face protection - but again, the pics are misleading. it’s definitely not what I was looking for, in light of COVID. The part that covers your nose and mouth is see-through mesh... not in compliance with any ‘facemask’ requirements. I was hoping to use this hat for both sun and C-19 in one item.  I have altered the flap for the back to cover my face, and while it is a bit odd looking,  I’m covered if I need to stop somewhere while out walking."
3.0,The quality of this shirt was way better than I expected. Cute shirt. Too bad it didn't quiet fit me right. I don't know if its the cut or what but it just didn't look right.
3.0,"Tight fit and to put on, a few pairs have worn through heel after only a couple months."
3.0,"Color faded quickly, padding in top is too bulky."
3.0,So cute but the sparkle gems come off easily.
3.0,"My husband bought me these earrings (from my Amazon wish list) for Christmas.  They are VERY pretty, and look good with various outfits.<br /><br />Two negatives:<br />- Packaging: The jewelry box was snugly wrapped, but the earrings were rattling around inside it with no packing<br />- Craftsmanship: When I took an earring out of the jewelry box to put it on, the glass bead slid right off the ear hook - it's not anchored.<br /><br />Otherwise, a good value for the money, and looks great on!"
3.0,Too big around the ankle. I returned them
3.0,"The arm holes were so high up, the robe was tiny.  I was able to use the material to turn it into something usable."
3.0,Shrunk on the first wash.
3.0,"Dont get me wrong, they are nice, and have a good feel and fit mostly. But the straight-arm on them allows them to slide off too easily. Does Gait have these with a curved arm to fit behind the ear? As it is, they are mostly unwearable."
3.0,they are beautiful charms all though you don’t get all the ones in the pictures
3.0,"Good quality and fit, but contrary to the items description this is actually six individual SOCKS, which equals three PAIRS. Not the 6 pairs that are advertised, so it's less of a deal than you may be expecting."
3.0,"Decent quality hat, but it's NOT a summer hat- it's 2 layers thick! I just want a thin summer slouchy hat but everyone I buy has lining or is double thickness!"
3.0,Nice pair of shoes but the only downside is that it left my feet blue after the first few wears. The color of the shoe rubs off on your feet.
3.0,Sweat shirt the weird shiny  out side. It did not wash well in cold water. I would not buy again
3.0,They fit fine; however I swore I ordered a 3-pack. I wouldn't spend $10.00 on one pair of underwear!
3.0,These are comfortable but are not very flattering in the crotch area. Bought a Small and fits right everywhere except crotch. A size bigger would be too big on me. There are better leggings out there. I wouldn’t buy this again because the camel toe is a deal breaker.
3.0,"I absolutely LOVE the sweater, I ordered black Large an it's not even close to oversized, it's HUGE!  I wanted to exchange it for a smaller size, I would have been ok with any color.  I contacted Amazon right away the same day it was delivered.  They sent my message to the seller who was prompt at getting back to me and very nice.  However I was told ""the sweater is now out of stock and no longer produce it, winter is about to pass"".  Well news for them I'm in Wisconsin and our winter just started, it was 21° yesterday.  They suggested I keep the sweater or gift it.  Okay, no problem I asked for a discount towards another sweater that is Grace Karin but they aren't the seller so my order never got resolved unless I just return it which I was trying to avoid."
3.0,Cute dress but I had to return.  Bad fit for me in the arm area.
3.0,This salwar is see through in the bottom part. So I had to wear a skirt underneath.
3.0,"This shirt is good quality and cute, just runs big in the wrong places so it makes me feel like it's a maternity shirt!"
3.0,"Was very happy to find this style hat as it was discontinued from the Walther website, however, when it arrived, it was sort of crushed or collapsed on one side. Only after several weeks of wearing it did my head smooth out that collapsed section. Also, the backstrap is some sort of buckle system that isn’t as intuitive as you would think. It’s a challenge to keep it fitted to my head. I wish it was the simple plastic snap-button version instead. Because of this, I don’t wear it much anymore. Still, happy to have found something comparable to what I was looking for at a reasonable price."
3.0,"I order these specifically as the item description said ""HEAD Mens 3-Pack Lounge Pants - Pockets Super Soft Jersey Spandex/Polyester Blend Pajamas""  But it is not a 3 pack.  Pretty disappointed about that.  Have not washed or worn them as of yet, but the one that I received seemed to be ok"
3.0,"Too bulky, too much material. Strong material and nice patern."
3.0,"Cute idea, bad execution. I’m 5’6” and the sleeves are barely long enough! And the wrist cuffs are to tight to push up to hide the short sleeves. The neck is strange and the hood is small. Normally wear a large but sized up and the “body” is roomy but the rest is just on a smaller scale. This will take some improvising to make it work."
3.0,This scarf isn't like the picture. I ordered two other scarfs that were suppose to all be the same.
3.0,I like the pattern but runs WAY small. I am a skinny person with big shoulders so bought a large so it would fit my shoulders. Fits like a US xs in my opinion.
3.0,product was thin and actually too small.
3.0,"It’s not like the picture but I still wear it, as a symbol of good fortune."
3.0,"I have order this item before and I love it. However, this time one of the quantities was damaged and missing one out of the six leaves.<br />Thank you for your time!"
3.0,Bought cap and when I put it on it barely covered half of my head. This is clearly a child’s cap.
3.0,The jumpper is nice but I had a button missing which was not very exciting at all and I wish I could get a discount on what I paid for the garment because of this.
3.0,"Good Quality Material. Odd Fit, Tight Chest, Small Neck Size for the Proper Arm Length and Waist.<br />Returned for a refund."
3.0,"Bought as a gift for my wife. She said they were made well, but would not work on her phone."
3.0,Good colors as in the picture. Cheap material & sewing.
3.0,Too small thought it was suppose to be shorter in length.  Cute but not what I expected.
3.0,"Not too shabby.  I had to make some adjustments because the bracelet was a bit too big, but overall I'm satisfied."
3.0,I like that the heel was 3 inches platform I wore them all night without any pain love them
3.0,Bead could have been a little bigger for the money. Looks like an earring for a child and not for a woman. It is ok I guess. A gift for a child not an adult.
3.0,"Top fits as expected. Bottoms are too large to wear. Top is as pictured, nice and vibrant...again, bottoms not the same the ones in the photo."
3.0,I received a small and still had to pin it back. Looked cute once it was pinned!  Runs large! I’m normally a small to medium. Had to pin it while in Vegas
3.0,"These are a good ""light duty"" winter glove and nothing more. If your planning on being out in very cold weather for extended period of time these are not the glove for you."
3.0,This dress is not horrible but it is meant to be very clingy. I like a tailored classier style over this.
3.0,My hair is long doesn't stay
3.0,Hope to help with this review.  Look at the photo.. I’m a 34C.  that’s the one of my regular bras in the pic next to the item being reviewed.  While the top fits the cups do not and the fact that they are heavily padded does not help as my boobs have no where to go!<br />Nice material! Recommend for an A cup!
3.0,"Ordered up a few sizes than normal US sizing, still was small. The picture makes it appear that the design is &#34;stitched&#34;. It is actually vinyl and the colors are very vibrant compared to the picture. If I knew it was a vinyl print, I would not have purchased."
3.0,Very cute nice leather but stitching came loose after the first wear. Poorly made.
3.0,Great looking but super heavy. Gave me blister on one single toe where it rubbed
3.0,Very cheap quality. Only good for one of two used
3.0,Too big for my wrist. So if you have small wrist just know it will be too lose
3.0,Order at least 1 size up if you plan on putting in the dryer. I never turn my dryer temperature higher than medium but it must be too hot because this cute tee shrunk about a size and a half.
3.0,"The bag looks nice with lots of compartments.  However, the padded compartment is not large enough for my 15"" Dell computer.  The computer has to be placed in the largest opening and then it is very tight.  The leather is good and stitching is fine.  After using it everyday for a while, I think I am going to regret not returning it."
3.0,"It's too big and boxy. But, it's comfortable. I recommend going down a size or possibly two. It seems well made. The color in person is a bit more orange than in the image here. The seam down the middle is more prominent in person, too."
3.0,Although very pretty it was very big not what I was hoping for plus the clasp was just a magnet
3.0,The XXIV is an iron and not stitched.  But its ok
3.0,This shirt is ok. It rises up have to keep pulling it down. Very soft and comfortable.
3.0,Just didn't like them
3.0,Waist elastuc is kind of uncomfortable for some yoga postures. Just ok.
3.0,nice print but fabric is so cheap and thin
3.0,Love the color. Looks much bagger in the picture.
3.0,Very pretty but very thin and delicate. Adjustable size is a plus
3.0,It is so hard to tell by pictures but this necklace was very very small
3.0,I tried it but when I sleep it kind of hurts my ear so I take it out before I go to bed. But other than. That I like it. Thank you.
3.0,"I'm 5&#34;5 and 138 and the medium fit me slightly big but I think I'm so used to spanx typical super tight fit. My but didn't have the wow factor, but for $30, I kept the tights"
3.0,Well made loose great runs small in my eyes would by again if situation arises
3.0,Meh.  These are ok.  For the pricen they are about $0.50 each.  So no real complaint.  They are very flimsy and small.  I used them to have on hand in my high school art room.  They take sharpie markers just fine.  The kids don't seem to mind the quality and they are a good fill in art activity.
3.0,The pads come out and after a couple washes the cloth liner came off and was left with a piece of foam. If you don't need the pad then they are good.
3.0,These boots run 1/2 to full size larger
3.0,"The design is really cute, although a little blurry on the actual leggings. They are one size fits all and they are a little small on me. I usually wear a large in leggings (8 or 10 in jeans) and they seem to be closer to a medium or small. Slightly disappointing. But they arrived on time and were only $11 so I can't really complain."
3.0,Very hard to see through but I didn’t expect much more for five bucks.
3.0,"More gold than pink, even outside in the sun. Feels Flimsy, like something that would cost $2 on wish. You also can see your eyes through the mirror tint, but it’s just barely. I do like that they come with a case."
3.0,"These are the best arm protectors I've tried EXCEPT the stitching came unraveled after only 1 ""gentle cycle"" washing.  Had to return both pair."
3.0,Shrunk very small.
3.0,This was a cute costume but ran very small
3.0,This fits 9 cans if you don't use an ice pack or anything else. I don't think actual ice would even fit in here.
3.0,"I don't really like it, but there is not much out there so I am marking it as it's ok.<br /><br />BUT...the straps are made of ribbon like material and not quality ribbon like material but cheap! They fold over and bend and are hard to move through metal parts to adjust. the material also is less than some other slips I have had, plus it will catch on your legs and bunch up inconveniently. The bra area is like the rest, just there, not well shaped.<br /><br />AND like another reviewer noted, it shows at the top of many clothes.<br /><br />The adjustable height is mainly (the straps can do it but it feels wrong)  achieved by cutting off the panels at the base, and this does alright without making a big mess.<br /><br />I have not noticed how it washed.  It left so much to be desired that I am still looking for a better slip.  It would be nice if manufacturers didn't treat clothes, and such for large sizes, as if they didn't matter as much as thinner figures."
3.0,I love the patterns but the fabric is so easily wrinkled and kind of rough.
3.0,"This skirt is very cute, definitely stretchy jean material though, meaning it was a little larger than I had hoped. I have a shorter torso and a good sized butt so there's a little bit of a gap between my back and butt. It didn't hug like I was hoping it would. Still very cute and comfy, I wear it a lot!"
3.0,I thought it was going to be around but it's actually
3.0,"I was going to use this dress to go as the 4th PowerPuff girl, Blistina, for Halloween. For that purpose, it wasn't a bad dress. However, I am glad Blistina's costume had leggings because this dress is short. Like sneeze-while-wearing-it-and-get-an-indecency-charge short.  But hey, my costume worked."
3.0,Overall it's okay but it runs about one size smaller than the tag shows.
3.0,The hinge where the arm attatches broke open so now I can't wear them but they were comfortable
3.0,Great shirt but it’s too small
3.0,"I wouldn't buy again.  It hasn't even been a month and the shoe looks like I've been wearing it for 6 months.  And I don't do anything extravagant with the shoes, just use it as work shoes.  I seriously don't think that they are going to last two months.  Looks like they are about to die any minute. One of the shoes was stabbed by a small piece glass from a bottle that nearly ran through my heel.  Luckily it didn't but if the glass was any bigger, it would have punctured my heel.  The rubber on the bottom of the shoe is not very strong, beware, do not walk onto anything sharp with this shoe."
3.0,could be better quality
3.0,Feels and looks good...except it's too long.
3.0,"This is a super cute top, good quality for the price.  However, it's one size fits all...or most.  This doesn't make any sense, considering that the fabric has zero stretch to it.  I wish I could keep it but it's fits more like a very fitted top than what's pictured.  For reference, I'm a size 8 and typically a medium in tops."
3.0,"These just don't fit my body right. I am 5 feet and about 125 lbs, I got the medium. I have gotten several pairs and several colors of leggings like this from different companies over the last few months and I always get a medium which usually always fit me great. These ones just don't fit me right,they are a bit thinner than the others and they kind of slide down on my waist when I walk, instead of fitting tightly and aren't tight enough around the ankles either. The other ones I have feel like better quality.These kind of make me feel like I am wearing polyester pants. I don't know, I mean I will still wear them but they are one of my least favorites.🤔"
3.0,The outfit is nice but the sizing rubs small and their is no stretch in the fabric. This is not big boob friendly.
3.0,"Came as advertised, just wish the push button wasn’t so bulky."
3.0,They are cute but a bit bigger than what I thought. I was hoping for something a little more delicate like on the model. They are still cute and I have worn both pairs. It was a great price for two pairs and each pair came with one extra earring back.
3.0,"I gave these Pearl's 3 stars only because the Pearl's are very pretty and give your face a glow. Aside from that they are very uncomfortable to wear. I don't know for sure if they are 16 or 17""?  I dont have a thick neck at all yet these are tight. And that clasp is annoying. I think I'm going to return ."
3.0,"I was on a trip and desperately needed a nice long dress. This is really pretty, but very form fitting so every curve is noticeable. And the neck is cut low so I needed a tank top/small bit of fabric that attaches to your bra (can’t remember the name of it) underneath. I was really hoping this would be my “go-to” dress, but think it looks so much better on thinner women."
3.0,It doesn’t have any rips like the picture shows on the front of the jeans. They are cute but the design is different than I thought it’d be.
3.0,I'm 6ft 2in and I ordered a xxl and it small ...but I'll make use of it so it's OK
3.0,This is cute but the polka dots are bigger than I expected but still cute.  I think the top part needed a little more room.  I had to give it to my daughter cause it smashed my breasts and did not look like it fit.
3.0,"Its ok, I like the colors but I think the fit is better for a child."
3.0,"Pretty, but way too small."
3.0,"This sweater is super soft.. but it is way too large! I ordered down a size (small) and it is still too big. I am disappointed because it doesn't even look like the cute oversized sweater look. If you are normally a large, you can order the small!"
3.0,"The chain broke after only a little while, but otherwise the design was nice."
3.0,"looks very old, used and faded...didn't care for."
3.0,"I'm 5'9"" and 150lbs, I usually wear a size large because I am tall and after reading the reviews I saw where the shirts run small so I bought an extra large. The extra large are too small, of the three shirts one fits good, one fits okay, and one is just way too small. again, I like the shirts but would not buy them again based on the sizing."
3.0,The color is beautiful. Im sad to return it because the fit is more appropriate for a busty with narrow hips shape. Fit was bigger on top and too tight on bottom. Im a pear shape.
3.0,"I like the material. I ordered the black pair but will probably need another color or two. 😃<br />Update: I wore these for the first time and now I’m repairing three places where the stitching is coming out. ☹️😬 I’m afraid I had to switch from 5 stars to 3 stars. On the positive side, I found them to be true to size (M) and I do like the material."
3.0,"The tie at the top is a bit awkward.  The rest of the dress fit alright, but the neckline made it appear strange."
3.0,"Ordered three of these for my friend's 40th birthday.  We love the charms, but two of the chains broke while just being worn, causing one of the charms to be lost as well :-(  Would be willing to pay a bit more for a better quality chain considering now we can't even wear them as intended."
3.0,Way more revealing than the picture appears. Also much shorter than what you see. Will have to wear only on a hot summer date night.
3.0,It was bigger than expected ordered a 18 month but fits like 2T she won’t be able to wear it until next spring.
3.0,They sent me the wrong size but luckily I can fit into the smaller size. This dress is also very thin. It’s a cute print though.
3.0,"Beads are built same on both side which is wrong, will cut them off."
3.0,Bought this as a gift. Was a rather thin chain and very very shiny almost fake looking. The shine should dull with wear tho...
3.0,Beautiful but way too small - size not comparable to my size. I didn’t read the info enough - you can’t send it back for free through Amazon drop off sites. I took it to Kohl’s (our drop off spot) on the last day possible only to discover I had to send it back myself at my expense. It was too late. The company was very nice. Completely my fault for not reading return policy.<br />Pretty dress. Nice representatives. Who wants my dress? Lol
3.0,"I really like the purse, it was exactly like I thought and what I wanted . Only issue is that the star that is suppose to dangle from the bow was missing. The bow and piece that was attached to where the bow should have been was there, just not the actual metal bow."
3.0,"product is 2 inches  long for my boot ,after a few days wear dirt builds up and very hard to zip up ....am going back to laces<br />Oh  and you have to figure how to lace ,,,,no instructions  finally went to lowes and purchased small black try straps to hold  them in ,,,,,but too tight after  a dozen or so gave up .......  not what works for me ,,,,sorry ....."
3.0,"Nice sunglasses. Lenses shorter than expected. Overall, good buy."
3.0,"These are nice silver earrings overall, just be aware the fish hooks are a much lighter weight then the drops, if you want to put a back on them to secure them (which I highly recommend to not lose them) just know you will need to replace the fish hooks with a sturdy pair.  I make wrapped jewelry as a hobby so I know about wires and these appear to be soft wires-meaning they are extremely bendable so the ""hook"" can easily bend ....say like a marshmallow.  They should have used semi-hard wire at minimum but used this soft wire because it was less expensive.  Overall, except for the issue with the hooks they are very nice earrings and I would have given 5 stars but the hooks get 2stars knocked off because although its easy for me to switch them out it is likely not as easy, convenient or economical for others."
3.0,"This is an odd sweatshirt. The sleeves are rather big, bat wing types sleeves. They don't fit closely to your arm at all. Additionally, the neck hole is a little too large. It doesn't fit securely around your neck and stay square on your shoulders, causing drafty air to go down your neck and back or onto your shoulder.<br /><br />I ordered a small. I am 5'2&#34;, 103 lbs, and a petite woman. I expected the sleeves to be too long but not so baggy. I don't believe that an extra small would be an improvement, for a woman anyway. I would guess that this sweatshirt would fit a man a bit better. The problem seems to be a construction issue, at least from my perspective. The colors are rich though-a pretty maroon red and a forest green. I have some concerns about eventual pilling as well-sooner rather than later.<br /><br />Overall, the Gildan sweatshirt that I ordered seems to be of better construction, fit-wise. I would recommend that product and the seller, Nayked Apparel, as being a better way to go. [[ASIN:B000NKN004 Gildan Men's Heavy Blend Crew Neck Sweatshirt]]"
3.0,"Super cute but the hoop ones are not very secure and the charm falls off, so be careful."
3.0,"I love the dress, it just dont fit."
3.0,I love the dress the length is perfect but the front tie is awkward and it’s super low .. I have big chest so now I need to figure out what to wear under it ... and the sleeves are funny like tight ....
3.0,"These masks fit my 3 year old great they are what I expected for the price except I had purchased them to tye dye, the description says they are 100% cotton but when I dyed them only the blue color held in them and that's usually because the fabric isnt cotton, if you are purchasing to tye dye don't do it"
3.0,Not as wide as expected.  Have extra wide foot and it works but not as omfortablw as hoped.  Perhaps jusr needs a little more wearing
3.0,"I really like the thickness of these headbands.  They're also just the right width and they are very absorbent.  However, they smell very strongly like fuel oil.  I have washed them several times with hot water, Shout, bleach, vinegar...nothing seems to work. I will still wear them because I only use them when I'm working out in the yard.  Hopefully, I'll get use to the odor."
3.0,"I was definitely expecting the loose cuffed dolman sleeves as pictured, so the tight-fitting inset short sleeves were a surprise. That said, the dress itself is comfortable and flattering. Definitely wear a slip dress underneath unless you're looking for a JLo-on-the-red-carpet, whole-lotta-leg moment."
3.0,Does not fit Galaxy Watch Active2
3.0,The breast area was so small. There was no way my breasts could stay in there at all.
3.0,I like the shirt overall but it is too small. I went up a size die to being a bit larger in chest and it is still tight. Heavens if I put on a couple pounds this thing would rip. It is nice length but tight across the breast area. I probably needed 2 sizes larger but how would one know when it's not a true to size item?? I probably won't be wearing this now as I don't think I could comfortable swing my golf clubs without this pulling too much.
3.0,"No me gusto mucho, corre muy grande el vest y la tela no es de la mejor calidad."
3.0,"My biggest complaint with this dress is the way the sleeves fit. Based on the picture, I expected them to be shorter, and looser....<br />The top of this literally looks like a tee shirt once it’s on. The sleeves fit tighter around the shoulders than I expected and are cut at a super awkward length. I played around with rolling them a little and pinned them up and felt a little better about how they look.<br />Also, the fabric is SUPER clingy and static-prone so beware what undergarments you wear. Other than that, the body is cut well and fits well, and the length is good even with heels. I’m 5’5” and around 130 pounds. I usually wear a medium for loose-fitting items and I ordered a medium in this dress. I want so badly to love it, but it’s really just not what I expected."
3.0,"Very nice shirt.  It was a little small for me, but it's a really great shirt.  I highly recommend SSLR!  I even ordered another shirt from them but went for the 3XL.  Very friendly people to work with."
3.0,This sweater is super cute and thick but it must run two sizes to small because I couldn't even get it over my shoulders. I am a size Large in women's tops and I ordered the XL and its super small. Order one to two sizes bigger if you can. Super bummed it didn't work out.
3.0,"The logo/art was not screened on, but made of plastic.  I'm sure after a few washes the artwork will come loose."
3.0,"Didn’t fit, had cheap material. Should’ve returned because I’ll probably never wear it but I didn’t handle it in time."
3.0,Somewhat  Large in size
3.0,It is an ok product...gave as a gift ..she liked it.
3.0,"Way too big! I’m usually a L but always order up online. I honestly could have bought a medium, maybe even a small! Would be cute if fit correctly"
3.0,"Had a hole in both side cargo pocket. Comfortable. Fit well, tiny bit longer in the leg, but nothing major will work on someone a bit taller than myself"
3.0,"Nothing fancy, but were great for a young girl's gift."
3.0,Its lovely except you need to go up a size for SURE.
3.0,I got this dress for my graduation and it was too big in the straps and the waist. Had to get it taken in. I usually wear a small
3.0,Only fits a very petite wrist
3.0,"Cute, but really thin like fine ponytail holders. Thought it’d be thicker."
3.0,"This shirt is much larger than other mediums I have purchased from other manufacturers.<br />It looked to be about two sizes too big.<br /><br />I exchanged it for a small and that is also too large.<br />The small fit better in the chest but the arms were very baggy and excessively long for me.<br /><br />I am 5'8&#34;, 160lbs, muscular build and usually fit very well with medium sized shirts, sweatshirts and sweaters but this shirt is just way too big for me.<br /><br />The color is great and the fabric appears to be high quality. I wish I could have found a size that worked for me."
3.0,The clasp is very poorly designed and broke the fist time it was worn. We are still using it for dressing up; but we tie it.
3.0,Dress material is nice but runs large for my body shape
3.0,Nice but runs very small order a size up
3.0,These pants fit horribly.  I sent back for a other brand. Ok if you like the old lady look I guess
3.0,I don't recommend this for larger chested women. The top part that covers the front of your shirt is very small so it looks weird and won't cover your chest from splashes or dirty mess.
3.0,"These do run a little small. I bought the toddler (2t-4t) and it fits my size 24 month old toddler just right - she's 35&#34; tall.  She has a little room to grow. I ordered the black and ballet pink. The black came with no problems and I do like the material and weight of them, but the ballet pink came frayed in multiple places so I'm not sure what to expect with future orders. Seems I would be able to expect a little more consistency from a name brand company. I may send the pink back and request another to see if they are all like that."
3.0,"The jewelry is pretty, but the middle pieces don't move so I wasn't able to put them in my ear..."
3.0,Beautiful bracelet. The silver is a little soft so the clasp may not work. You can bend it back.
3.0,"Do they not grow any cotton in China? Some of the designs on these Amazon clothes are so cute but the fabrics are so disappointing. I don't know what this is but it's not full cotton. Fit and cut was good, but am returning because scratchy and uncomfortable."
3.0,The backs are plastic.  Metal would be better.  I assume they are cheaper.
3.0,Falls apart fairly easy
3.0,Very cute for my flower girl but when it arrived the comb was broken off. Had to glue it back on.
3.0,"This was a pretty necklace and my niece loved it, but honestly it didn’t seem like the quality I’d expect for the price. It was also a little bigger than I expected."
3.0,"So I am not 100% sure either way without destroying a pair, but I am unconvinced these are actually stone. I have mild irritation with acrylic after wearing for some days in a row, and these have caused irritation. They aren't bad quality for acrylic, it's just frustrating that they are advertised as stone if they are not truly stone."
3.0,"Definitely shear, but I did know that they would be pet watching reviews on YouTube. A little snug right now and I feel the contouring on the top isn’t flattering to my body right now. I’m also 5ft3in so that could be a factor so the upper contouring just emphasizes my tummy pouch I have from recently having a baby. Love the high waist of it though. Also would need to fold the bottoms, but that’s normal for me."
3.0,"I ordered an XL in this top. It fit except in my arms!  It was too tight.  I returned for a bigger size.  Love the colors and it was exactly what I was looking for, just make sure if your arms are large the sleeves will be snug."
3.0,Nice looking shoe but runs to big. I typically wear an 11 but I am now ordering a 10.5.
3.0,The only thing I don't like is they are very small. Other than that they are good for me ya
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:a18cab824d650e201fcf9b7cb7cf3ad3]] Beautiful mask, however the pocket with the filter is located too low and doesn't protect the nose.  Other than that, I love it, but the whole purpose of wearing a mask is for protection. If I'm sent a new mask with the filter higher I will give 5 star review"
3.0,its a bit small if you're  going to buy it get about 1 to 2 sizes larger but other then it being small the fabric is soft and it arrive much earlier then expected(3 weeks earlier).
3.0,"I found the inside material to be so itchy. I had to return it. Also, a small would have fit me better."
3.0,really awesome but it arrived broken but i just tied a knot in the chain and it seems to hold up
3.0,"The neck part is different, more like a t-shirt . However still a cute shirt and fits well"
3.0,The shirt is more pink than the picture and the back of the shirt is higher up (above the bra strap). I wouldn't recommend for anything other than an as needed. I wore it on vacation and it served it purpose. Probably won't wear it again.
3.0,This was a size smaller than it said it was
3.0,"That material is not as stretchy as I expected at all. It is more of a rigid t-shirt material, rather than curve-hugging. I think if I got one size smaller, it may have been a better fit because it would naturally stretch from being too small. Plus, the color was not a rich burgundy - it was more of a muted red. The only thing I like is the white lace along the bottom hem, which feels good quality and is a nice bright white."
3.0,"They are beautiful. I was advised by Amazon to order medium, which I did. However, the medium fits like a Small. Unfortunately, large is not available."
3.0,"I really love the look of these glasses, but they are so light it's almost annoying. Also, they squeak pretty loudly after a couple uses. Overall, I still use them but I wish I had bought something a little more sturdy."
3.0,The dress was a pretty color and I love the print. It was not true to size. I normally wear a 14 bit the waist was too small. I couldn't zip it up.
3.0,I will say that these are more stretchy than gymshark leggings but they have weird extra material in the crotch area. They’re not sweat wicking so I would wear these on an arm day or just for lounging in. They are cute though!
3.0,"This pulse rifle is way smaller than what you would see in the Mandalorian series. If you're just looking for a kid's toy, this will work. If you're looking for a semi-legit prop, this is not for you."
3.0,"If you are heavy chested, the top offers no support at all."
3.0,Fit is very comfortable but the fabric and construction is not quality. The seams in several places were not sewn properly leaving gaps in the seams.
3.0,"I bought this for an extended overseas trip. I returned it before I left. Pretty light weight and I didn't care for the zippers, seemed too flimsy."
3.0,"5'1 and 175 lbs. Ordered XL because I usually need XL to go over my 38DDs. Romper was way way too big and I shouldn't have ordered the stripes, I looked like Curly from the 3 Stooges wearing one of those old time bathing suits. Material was super comfy and soft but even to wear around the house it was just too baggy. Return in process now. Gave 3 stars because it seemed nice, was just wrong size and picked wrong print"
3.0,"They came sooner then expected and everything, but these sunglasses are very small and the lenses are very close together, makes it look like your eyes are to close lol. I was surprised cause I have a small face, but they are perfect for my 3 year old daughter! Not quite what I was looking for though!"
3.0,"I am updating my review, previously I gave it 2 stars, and I am returning it for several reasons.<br />1) It was a little small, so buy a size up.<br />2) It was too poofy for the look I was going for.<br />3) I didn’t like the way it smelled out of the package.<br /><br />However, I am updating this review because of the great customer service.<br />The company saw I was dissatisfied and reached out immediately to try and rectify the problem.<br />I ended up finding a skirt that was more in line with what I wanted, so I am returning."
3.0,It is a great costume just a little see through could be a little thicker material
3.0,They run small. Keep rolling down
3.0,Didnt look as stylish when i tried it on
3.0,"The top looks nice and was a good fit. But the one I received didn't have a tag attached and smelled of perfume, obviously it was a return."
3.0,"As most everyone wrote, it runs EXTREMELY SMALL.  I took into account everyone's comments and ordered a XXL.  I normally wear a medium to large depending on the fit, style and manufacturer.  This fits me &#34;good&#34; like a medium would, but I like my sweatshirts to be a little baggier.  The way the jacket fits I could wear a t-shirt under it, but nothing heavier than that.  I would have probably needed a XXXL they way these jackets run.  As far as the fabric, it seems a little &#34;cheap&#34;, not bad but not great.  A little rough to the touch on the outside, softer on the inside and feels a bit &#34;flimsy&#34;.  The style is nice.  I chose to keep the jacket, for the price it is okay and not worth returning.  I recommend reading all reviews before purchasing anything.  I might purchase this again in a larger size, just saying."
3.0,Could use more padding
3.0,"Winter shirt for sure, bright thick cool looks great"
3.0,Not cute in my size XL. Fits more like a flaired top (or tent). Too short.
3.0,"somewhat small and the ties that go around the dress are too short to wrap around twice, but I made it work"
3.0,Too light weight to provide much warmth but for the price it is okay.
3.0,I was super excited about this dress until i noticed a hole ripped in the back of it! The fit was great though. I ordered a size down because of the other comments. If it wasn't for that rip i'd give it 5 stars.
3.0,i didnt even try this shirt on because i pulled it out of the bag and it's barney purple. not at all what is pictured
3.0,It’s supper cute but the chain part was really short it was almost like a choker  which I wasn’t looking for
3.0,"I bought these in the buff color with the brown lenses. I like the frames, but the lenses are not actually brown as shown in the image. The lenses are black which makes the sunglasses look rather odd. Bright gold frames with black lenses, They're okay, I guess they can be my back up pair of sunglasses. Not as cute as I thought they would be. They might look better in black."
3.0,"Very nice, it really does look like the one in the picture! I did get what I wanted! I will get to wear this cape alot! I  won't have to wait for it to get really cold. My old Chinchilla coat , that I bought 5 YEARS AGO  I only have had the chance once to wear it! It was a very hot coat, and it just wasn't  enough cold weather to wear it! So I should be able to wear this new cape alot! It's not hot it's a warm cape! Very pretty, I will get to wear  it alot!"
3.0,They were ok. Good condition but did keep slipping down.
3.0,a little tight through the chest
3.0,At first I was pretty satisfied with this when I first took it out of the package and looked at it. However after putting it on I noticed that the seam where the arm meets the shoulder on the back left side was what I thought at the time torn. Upon closer inspection I realized it's not torn it's just the fabric is cut so short and the sewing of the seam so close to the edges of the cut fabric that it's simply separated when any kind of force was exerted on it. A simple fix is to not cut the fabric so small and sew so close to the edges of the fabric. The worst part is it's not even covered by the overdress. I waited too long to return it so now I'm stuck with it. I'm going to take it to the cleaners where they do alterations and see if they can fix it.
3.0,"As a household of females, we love these masks.  They are pretty and comfortable and easy to breathe though even wearing all day.  They are also so much softer on our skin under the mask.  We definitely prefer the colors that blend in with our skin, and it is frustrating that we have to buy them in bulk packages with bright, colorful & dark colors. For this reason, I will be looking for a new company to buy a similar mask, but one where I can select the colors. Also - they took a month to arrive."
3.0,Really wanted to love these. Surprisingly they still fit me now that I’m 20 weeks pregnant. My only issue is the bottoms are pretty see-through. I also purchased the red color which doesn’t have the same problem!
3.0,So warm and pretty but fits very small
3.0,"These are the largest size and are too tight to get on.  Also, they say on the box that they have a seamless toe for comfort, and there is a seam on the toe.  So, I went in to start a return and they are not returnable.  I bought another brand sock with these on the same order.  And the other pair is returnable.  I tried to send a message to the seller and could not."
3.0,Very pretty/sexy dress but the sizing ran very small. I ordered an XL and it was more like a M/L. I soo wish it would have fit. :(
3.0,Nice material. Just too short so I just wear it at home.
3.0,I'm only 5'1&#34; and these were thigh high leggings and the model was much taller. The leggings were small in for and only came right above my knee. I liked the style but wished they had come to my thigh like expected.
3.0,Skirt to big and top kind of fits better.
3.0,"As expected--nothing more, nothing less."
3.0,could keep the fingers warmer
3.0,Fits very baggy vs. most items like this for me. Next time I would get a small. Very soft material.
3.0,No<br />Runs smaller than anticipated. I would definitely order size up. Just be sure you're okay with shorty shorts because these will crawl up thighs while sitting. I've actually decided to use them as swim trunks since material very similar with mesh liner.
3.0,It was what I expected but a little snugger than I would have liked. Probably my own fault but maybe order a size up if you want it a bit looser. Like the material & has washed just fine! Good purchase - great if I had ordered one size up!
3.0,"I ordered medium ankle sock and they fit well. My shoe size is 6.5 US. They seem well made, and I like the wool. I wouldn't call them ""thin ultra-light"" which is what I hoped. Also the top band is tight, and I'm thin. They leave quite a dent in my ankle. My search for comfortable socks continues."
3.0,Fabric seems soft. Purchased this hat for my boyfriend who works in frigid temps and it just didn’t keep his head warm.
3.0,"Would have given these a better review, but the packaging for shipment wasn't great and one of arms of the eyeglasses is bent wrong.<br /><br />This bears no reflection on Quay sunglasses which are super stylish and fit well, for the price point they are at. I'm just not sure I'd by them again from Amazon."
3.0,Too tight to get on.  I like zippered style better.
3.0,kinda a little cheaply made. bought for my daughter for small trips. good starter
3.0,"I wasn't crazy about the color tone of these. And they are quite cord-like (in a soft material). I was hoping the innovative connectors would be a plus, but they just weren't that comfortable for me against my head when wearing them.<br />I liked the twisted leather ones MUCH BETTER which I've bought in the past. Would recommend you look for those!"
3.0,"The coat looks nice but sizing and fit definitely leave something to be desired. I ordered a 3Xl cause I'm a pretty big guy. That said, the coat is incredibly tight in the upper sleeve and armpit area. Not comfortable at all. It's possible that smaller sizes may be a better fit but based on the product I recieved, I would not recommend this purchase."
3.0,"This is a Good Quality shirt.. It's pretty impressive.. But it's freaking way too long.. I didn't want a dress. :/ I purchased an XXL, which is good for me. Just too long. In the picture, my hand is at my waist."
3.0,It's small but I returned because I was looking for a flat round and it's concave. You cannot see that in the picture.
3.0,This product is very tight. And I do not have a large head. I wish it was loose around the neck and just held up with the ear loops
3.0,Not bad for the money. Quality leaves much to be desired. First one I wore for 3 days before changing it out due to one of the rhinestones fell out.
3.0,"I love the colors and thickness for spring wear, but the item was not a new item. It had been previously sprayed and reeked with the smell of cologne so I had to wash the shirt (that was my reasoning for giving it a 3 star rating)."
3.0,Common issue with dress socks but they don't stay up throughout the day.  When I first put them on they feel great but by midday I have a bundle of sock around my ankle.
3.0,"Not as nice as pictured, but still good for the price.  Material is a bit thin, but I'm not complaining for the price paid."
3.0,"The dress was very pretty.  Unfortunately,  I had to return it because it was a little too small in the waist but a little too large in the back."
3.0,"The mask is fragile.  For example, the left eye lens popped out when I tried to remove the plastic packing.  It isn't glued in, just pressed into the socket.  It was originally to be used as part of a steampunk costume, but we didn't think it would hold up.  We were then going to use it in a static Halloween display, but decided to go with something else.  If you want something that will just sit around, get the mask.  If you actually want to wear it, look somewhere else."
3.0,"I purchased the cream/navy plaid lined with navy terry cloth, AND the purple. I never even opened the purple because the color was DEFINITELY NOT as presented since it is actually a very ugly brown-purple!! The purple is definitely going back!!<br /><br />The cream/navy plaid is very attractive and I really like the terry lining and the to-the-ankle length. I am 5'5&#34;, female, and am a size 16. The sizing guide is terribly flawed, as the suggested L/XL is very, VERY large. The shoulder seams come four inches down my arms and the front over wraps around me completely!! It is cozy but clunky and the shape is very unattractive!! I would trade for a S/M but of course the size wanted is never available. I may keep it and I may not.<br /><br />UPDATE: sending the plaid back. It's just too big!! :("
3.0,Very short torso.  I'm only 5'3&#34; so I'm not a tall person and the torso is way to short.  It a cute suit and seams to be made well enough although I haven't swam in it to know.
3.0,"fits nicely, but one of the bras is torn on the shoulder strap after first wearing..."
3.0,Beautiful replica but it came with two rhinestones missing. I later found them inside the packaging. Doesn’t seem like good quality based on that.
3.0,"I am torn on this review because I got 2 different items.<br /><br />1st item - the brown sweater with pockets (first one shown) Color wise, I wouldn’t call it brown it it more of an orange color, but great for fall. The quality is amazing! It is thick, but not heavy and so cozy. I love the pockets as well. If they had this style in more colors I would probably buy them all! Please make more of this product!!!!!<br /><br />2nd item - Black snap button sweater - well my first problem is I didn’t get the snap button sweater, I received a black sweater with actual buttons. Ok I can deal, even though I liked the look of the other better. Then to quality, I don’t hate it, but I don’t love it. It is more of your basic sweater for appearances not to keep you warm. The material is not really soft, but it’s not a total loss. I will still wear it."
3.0,Looove the watch but def is cheaply made. Pin holding watch on band broke third time wearing it. Trying to fix now.
3.0,"Decent for cheap glasses but the super small bridge piece made the glasses ride too high for my liking. The lenses and the frame seemed to be made of good material. The frames were still stylish looking. I responded to Love's customer support when they reached out to me for a review and told them about the bridge. They recommended replacing it with another one, but they did not sell any replacement size bridges. They did send a guide on adjustment of the nose piece but it did not apply to my frames.<br /><br />I will say their customer service was very responsive and did genuinely want to help."
3.0,Bottoms are nice but the top is really flimsy.
3.0,just O.K. Guess you receive what it is worth
3.0,Decent dress for the price. Can be dressed up or down.
3.0,Decent but definitely not as pictured.  You get what you pay for.
3.0,Loved it. Looked great. Zipper broke and it tore within 2 weeks.
3.0,"Too thick for Florida Summer weather.  Also, I'm 5'4&#34; and it is extremely long on me.  I was going to return it but was too late.  Now I'm going to have to hem it and set it aside for when the weather cools a bit."
3.0,"They seem like well made shoes. Unfortunately the damaged box indicated the size I ordered: Size 12, unfortunately the shoes on the inside were size 11. Clearly marked size 11. They'll fit for a bit but sad to see the size won't allow em to last for long."
3.0,I wear DD40 and have a small waist. Got a large and it was way too tight on my boobs. But very cut top.
3.0,This necklace is the only necklace I have bought off of Amazon that has NOT broke!
3.0,"Nice lightweight tunic, a bit too sheer & runs very small!!"
3.0,Hook problem
3.0,In the USA XXL is 40 - 44 inches.  I'm 42 and found these to be very tight even prior to washing.
3.0,"Again, I ended up giving this to my daughter. She likes the big, floppy beanie."
3.0,I ordered the muli color in Medium. The colors are really bright and pretty. The shirt however is not as stretchy as I would have thought based on the material it says it is made out of. Would not recommend on a hot day since the material is also really thick. I am normally a small or extra small and I had to size up and it is still snug. For reference I am 5'10 and about 130lbs. The medium was snug and the length hit just bellow my pants line on non high waisted jeans. Overall I am keeping it. Just not what I expected.
3.0,"love the bracelet,  with you offered more sizes. Hard to get on n off. I understand needs to be slightly snug but leaves marks when putting on n taking off"
3.0,"My daughter is almost 2 and wanted me to take it off right away. If I had a painting project out, I probably would've had a better response. It was very large on her. The product needs to off gas a bit. I am keeping it and look forward to using it. I wish it had a more adjustable size."
3.0,Works great much better than the rubber band that comes with the watch but feels cheap. Will be looking for a better one
3.0,Not very easy on/off
3.0,Doesn't look incredible fancy but got the job done. I read a post about a broken crown and was hesitant at first but then decided the sash was worth it. The crown came out folded perfectly in half. I was able to bend it and but in crown form and fashion just fine.
3.0,"Decent for the price I paid. Most were in good shape, some where bent."
3.0,"They are very pretty!!  However, they are TINY!!!  More for a child in my opinion...Bought for myself but gave to my niece.."
3.0,The tip is larger then size expected.
3.0,The quality isn’t bad but it was much smaller than I expected.
3.0,"El color es diferente, es más claro que el de la imagen."
3.0,"Warning: The rivets on the frame that hold the lenses on can scrape or scratch you, so be careful putting these on or near your face. They felt a bit tight on myself, personally, but I have a large head. They are quite large otherwise, so I'm positive they'd fit most everybody else. I dunno, I guess my head is XXXL, and not quite XXL. They look good, and aren't too dark."
3.0,"These glove in my opinion have the best style, however the quality is much less desired. The right hand thumb is about a quarter inch longer than the left hand for the pair of gloves that I received."
3.0,Nice material fit fine.  The length is very long and needed to remove about 4 inches to hem for a correct length.  I am 5 ft 6 inches.
3.0,"I ordered a 6 wide and got a 6 medium. Will try them on her this weekend to see how they fit, but may have to return."
3.0,Clasp is difficult to maneuver as if it is rusted but no rust is seen. I've not had difficulty with this type of clasp in the past with other products.
3.0,"Love the design I guess I was not expecting the fabric to be a silky feel, I guess I did not read the fabric correctly wore once was bigger than expected"
3.0,"I ordered a small, I'm 5'4 120lbs. The material is like silkyish so it rides up constantly! Came with a lot of loose threads I had to cut off. The sleeves were really long and made me look baggy as well as fabric bunching around my waistline. They didn't have xs option but I always wear a size small in general."
3.0,The letters were uneven and there were dents in the hat I couldn't fix.
3.0,"Arrived with a stain on it, but very cute. Will exchange."
3.0,El material no es igual a la foto.
3.0,Very cute but they snap very easily. And the metal rusts a little bit after a while.
3.0,"This is a very stiff  bag. I am hoping  it will soften up as I use it more. I have had  clear bags like this before and they were a softer product, and easier to pack in a larger bag."
3.0,It is an ok bracelet but the thread that attaches the beads to the leather is not nice. You can see that it is cotton thread and looks cheap😒 I have a mandala bracelet and thought it would look the same but it's nowhere near it and this bracelet costs twice the price.
3.0,Pendant looks amazing but if you are a larger guy with a muscular neck you will not get this around it haha and the pendants necklace loop only fits small rope.
3.0,The shirt was cheap & too big. It fits me & I’m his mom. He was very upset!
3.0,"It's a nice neckles, poor quality but I like it."
3.0,Was really disappointed. I ordered a Large even tho I am a medium and the Large looks like a Small.  The color was nice...but the over sweater was just ok.
3.0,These are not for everyday wearing. In fact I only wear them at night. I find they chafe if I wear them during the day.
3.0,"Package w/ out damage, product not seen yet. Gift"
3.0,Not long as pictured. But still cute
3.0,"I am 6ft tall, so I ordered the XL, but still not a hood fit. There is lots of room in the middle, if I was much more robust it would be good, but it is too short. Once its on I can not rase my hands above my head and the sleves/legs only cover partway down each. Overall obviously made for shorter persons, and going up in size helps with gerth but will not help if you are tall."
3.0,These are fine for the price but they are very small. I ordered them for my husband but they fit my toddler.
3.0,Too narrow.  Item returned.
3.0,"I was so excited to try this bra. It fit fine around my chest, but the cups were very small. When I bent down or moved left or right, my boob came out. Also, around the bottom snaps, the edges were sharp and scratchy. I'd definitely recommend getting at least 2 sizes bigger!"
3.0,Ordered a (2) pack of XL. Seemed ok quality however 1 shirt fit nicely and the other shirt was definitely smaller. Both marked XL. I couldn’t wear the smaller one so I returned.
3.0,Material is cheap but for the price it is cute. Not really for the big chested.
3.0,"Was too small for my 6 mo old, runs small, cute hat tho, good quality"
3.0,Cheap not so leather watch.  This is a nice watch for a teenage girl not for an upscale lady.  It is just an okay buy.
3.0,Overall hat is okay.  The top of the hat does bend and it looks strange (IMO) when you are wearing.  Overall it is okay for the price.  I would not purchase again because I don't like how it looks on me.
3.0,Solid frame and lenses but if you're looking for a total mirror effect these are not them.
3.0,"While I like this bracelet, the clasp is hard to open and close.  But I’m giving it 3 stars because the bracelet is round but would be easier to get on and off if it was oval.  So the combination of being hard to open the clasp or slide over my hand because of the shape, gave it 3 stars."
3.0,"I love this dress! With that said, I can't give it 5 stars because when I washed it, the green leaves bleed EVERYWHERE! I was so devasted because not only did it bleed all over itself, but on the rest of the other clothes in the wash. I promptly sprayed the other clothes and rewashed them and they came clean. I used a Color Catcher and Spray and Wash. Then I washed the dress with a Color Catcher and miraculously, the green came out except for a small spot on the back. I was very surprised because I have several Grace Karin dresses that are my favorites and I have never had issues. Otherwise, the dress fits well, has a fabulous full circle skirt, and will be beautiful with a petticoat."
3.0,Runs small. I ordered large and fit between small to medium.
3.0,"For the price these glasses are cute. The downside is that you can see a raised line in the middle of the glasses, right where they sit on your nose."
3.0,"I feel like it’s not 100% cotton , these socks are not that good  to absorb sweat"
3.0,"Beautiful purse, looks very expensive and I get a lot of compliments. However within 2 days of receiving, the zipper on the back of the outside of the purse broke and is now permanently open. Pretty disappointed as I had high hopes for a good quality bag."
3.0,This dress is really fabric and does not lay well. The torso of the dress is too large and hit me in-between an empire and natural waist. I gave it 3 stars because the dress had the exact pattern as pictured.
3.0,"Fits on the bigger side but the style is loose so it should not be a problem. The shipping was faster than I expected. However, the color is not what the picture shows."
3.0,Bracelet is plastic rest is okay.
3.0,It supposed to compress. Suggest to buy one size smaller
3.0,"I got a medium based on another review but I think she's fooling herself. I'm 5'6&#34; and 157lbs and this dress was holy crap tight. I got it on but my left thigh was oozing out of the slit. Not a good look. For what it's worth, the material was WAY higher quality than I expected. The dress was quite heavy in the packaging but the slit was too much. I liked the overall look of the dress if it didn't have the slit. If you're a twig and wanna show some skin, this is a good dress for you."
3.0,Hi i would like my money back the screw was very cheap it broke and now the band can't fit me so I have no use for it
3.0,"This one is a little weird, the fit is a bit restrictive on my arms and my neck, the inside of the hoodie isnt soft and has a pilly look to it, very strange for a brand new hoodie. It's not comfortable to wear, and fits really strangely. Definitely now what I'm looking for in a hoodie, it feels cheap and looks old, it's just not what I'm looking for."
3.0,A bit too baggy for me.
3.0,I really like the jersey.  I normally wear a XL for everything.  I should have ordered XXL for this.  It ran small.
3.0,Definitely thought it would be more of an emerald green....
3.0,Awesome light weight shirt breathes well but the fabric gets pulls in it if you look at it the wrong way.
3.0,It is a bit shorter than expected and very thin material
3.0,"I should be able to easily fit a medium with this type of stretchy material, but it was too small and the large barely fit. It definitely runs a tad bit small in my opinion, but it will serve the purpose I need it for."
3.0,"I bought 8 pair (2 of each color originally) but the seller only sent 4. I was in dismay and confused, and eventually got my refund after some hagling. I received 1 of each color.<br /><br />They look basically the same in real life. Maybe a little smaller than you may think, but I expected it (from China). But, overall not too bad. Some of the pocket zipper handles broke within the first week, just an annoyance, though."
3.0,"El vestido es bonito, se ve parecido a la foto, pero con muy malos acabados, hilos colgando, no está parejo el dobladillo, no es lo que esperaba"
3.0,"Dress is cute and comfortable. Material is okay, on the thinner side. Color isn’t as intense as the photo."
3.0,Really big for a child. The eyes where misplaced and very small.
3.0,Good product nice and long . I ordered a xl and got 3x smh ..
3.0,"Looks cool! I liked it and was happy with it. until the zipper came off the end, due to the material not being sewn on or attached correctly!"
3.0,"I chose ""blue"", which is more of a lighter periwinkle color. The color I received was a royal blue, which is indicated as ""navy"" in the options."
3.0,Item was nice
3.0,The charms fell off quickly.
3.0,"Looks, and feels great. The paint is beginning to come off, and the magnetic band feels loose now"
3.0,"I was impressed with shipping method. Dress was perfectly folded, packed inside individual bag. Impressed with dress, well made, beautiful, but large did not fit me. Too small."
3.0,it's not very comfortable where the clasps is. also the band has broken away from the watch itself a few times. It does look good though
3.0,"Shoes were a bit narrow, with no arch support. I still kept them though since they are cute"
3.0,Somewhat large. The cutout in front is very wide and low. Too much cleavage for my comfort
3.0,Definitely made for very young children. Nerds to be added to description. Decent quality and price but a waste for me vmbeacause they re so small.
3.0,It is NOT loose fitting as it says in the description.
3.0,Runs small. My daughter is super petite and it was too small for her
3.0,It's cheap and the fabric is falling apart.
3.0,Ordered a 2xl and is about the size of a large
3.0,"I really liked the way this shirt fit when I first got it. I joked that I was attacked on my way to the office when I wore it, because that's what it looked like, lol. It was flowy, comfy and just a great shirt! I've washed it twice and the front is so short it doesn't even come to the top of my jeans. I'm really bummed, but I can no longer wear it. 😔 My advice might be to not dry it. I wash everything on cold, so it must have been the dryer. 🤷‍♀️"
3.0,The color was perfect but the neck wasn't wide enough to lay off of both of my shoulders
3.0,"These are so cute and the ""leather"" is nice and soft. But, it's made for women's small hands in the palm, and then the fingers are huge and the seams bulky. I've got fat fingers and don't fill them out. So, they only look cool when you close a fist to hide the fingertips."
3.0,"PRO:  fit is slim, light weight ,looks good.<br />CONS: i bought a grey but looks more like brown."
3.0,"Like:colors are great,have used and washed many times since I purchased and they still retain their color.<br />Dislike:description says that they have removable pads,they don't.<br />When ever they are washed the pads get twisted inside the cups and I have to work them like a puzzle in order to get them straight again<br />The only way to remove the pads is to make a slit in the cup.If this happens,you've destroyed the bra."
3.0,A little too small!
3.0,"super cute earring but honestly, LOUD.  they dangle and clank"
3.0,These tank tops run a little small and are thin. They are sheer. I was hoping for a better overall product.
3.0,Gave itbaway!
3.0,"I really liked this romper which is why I ordered it, however when I received it I found it did not look as pictured. There was no black edging around the collar or sleeves as the picture shows. I got the grey one because I really liked how it looked with the black trim. What I received was all grey except for the trim around the ankles. I felt it looked plain without the rest of the trim being the same color."
3.0,"Fit and color were fine, but the material was not top quality (expected for the price,  but still) nice for filling out your lingerie collection but definitely not a showstopper piece"
3.0,The length was great. The dress doesn't give you much shape like the picture tho. It's heavy so it did feel durable.
3.0,"We got these for our baby for Fourth of July fireworks.  They are very nice quality and have great sound proofing and even come with a nice little storage bag, but they were very tight on my babies head and she didn't like them on (3 months old at the time). We ended up just holding our hands over her ears.  May work better when she's older and more tolerant of things squeezing her head!"
3.0,Too big for my size 5 fingers and took for ever to  get here but I really like them.
3.0,"This is a mens Large or Extra Large. It's definitely not an XXL like it says it is. It's slim fit.  You'd think XXL would have more room in the middle, but it's the exact same cut as the smaller ones, but a little bigger all around. Not much though....I am 5'5"", my sleeve inseam is 17"" and 22"" across the shoulder, and an XXL fits me almost perfectly - the sleeves come to mid-palm. Despite being sold in America, I don't think this is cut for the average American male size.<br /><br />Oddly, each pocket is fleece lined. This is great for phones, but it's odd because the inside of the coat - where the person goes - is not fleece lined.<br /><br />Pockets. This has one zippered inside pocket, two snap closure chest pockets on the outside, and two snap closure top entrance cargo pockets on the outside.<br /><br />The hood is attached, but the faux fur trim is detachable. It's got a fixed drawstring to cinch the hood around your face. It's got a heavy duty plastic zipper with double pulls, so you can unzip it from the bottom without taking it all the way off; if you need to use the bathroom or adjust your pants, access your pant pockets, etc.  The zipper has a snap down placket cover to keep wind out. The zipper and snaps are all the way up; there is no separate set of snaps to close the collar around your chin. There are snow cuffs inside the sleeve, and a snap close rear vent, but no drawstring around the bottom or waist.<br /><br />The dark grey is a really nice color, and the coat doesn't make that annoying swishy sound when you move. It feels weighty and dense, and like it would be warm in winter."
3.0,"The hat meets all my expectations for the price range: quality, appearance, durability, except for its size. It was advertised “as one size fits most” (which, I know, is always a gamble), but it also showed the diameter to be 23”. So I took the gamble because my head diameter is 23”. Sadly, this hat is less than 23”. Fortunately, another man in our costumed caroling group has a smaller head than me, so the hat will still get used. If you head is 23” or larger look elsewhere. Other Amazon suppliers advertise hats with 24” (similar style and price range)."
3.0,"Beautiful Boot, but not True to B(M) sizing. I have 2 of the exact same boot and brand with just different designs. Very narrow width. If you fit true to B(M), these will be too narrow. I'm having to return, and now wait longer to wear them :("
3.0,very poorly constructed waist band
3.0,Fits somewhat small and the white is see threw.
3.0,"Well, I want to start by saying I have 3 of these (hot pink, dark blue and purple). The hot pink and blue one are beautiful and very puffy. My daughter wears them all the time!<br />But given that I loved the quality of the first two, I decided to buy a third one, the purple one, this one although it look just as pretty as the rest, isn’t the same quality. The little sparkly stars and circles on it fell almost completely on the very first day and in their place there’s this brown spots of glue. I don’t know if I got a defective one or if all the purple ones are lesser quality."
3.0,"Cute suit, quality seemed good but it was sized super small... I ordered a large and it literally looks like an XS when I received it."
3.0,"I really like the way they look and they are warm, but I noticed they're a little tight. I usually wear an 8 or 8 1/2 shoe, so my feet aren't that big, but these seem  more made for smaller feet. I notice a mark around my ankle when I take them off after I've worn them for a few hours."
3.0,The bottom of the shirt is not cut the way it appears in the picture
3.0,Loved the purse & got bunch of compliments on it. Would be perfect if after 2 days of using it the piece that enables the shoulder strap be attached didn't rip through. It still has the shorter handles...but would like to be able to wear on shoulder.
3.0,"I hate to criticize this because it is so widely liked out here. But it is cheap, and it shows in the finishing. The edges are very sharp, and it is kind of not a big deal, but it is in line with the price. It bugged me. So I give it 3 stars, not totally bad, but I was hoping for more. That may be on me though, it is a good watch for the extremely low price."
3.0,"ok , not great"
3.0,Not lighting up anymore? Even when charged or being charged
3.0,For my order I purchased a 2x but when the shirt arrive it was a bit more fitted smaller than I expected a 2x to be. Keep in mind this isn’t available in plus sizes so if ur ok with wearing a shaper underneath ur shirt all day to smooth out the jelly rolls then this is the shirt for u. But me I’m like nah that shirt better fit cuz I’m not spending all day sweating in a shaper hoping my fat rolls won’t bust the seems of the shirt 🤣. Now if this was plus size 2x I know it fit. But I have two options return it even though I love the softness and graphics of the shirt or keep it hoping I loose weight and all the while not being able to enjoy the shirt 😬 tough decision. Normally I wear a size 2x plus size cuz of my big boobies and stomach. But I’m glad this was a try before I buy.
3.0,"Top is cute. Material does not feel breathable and if you get it wet, the water stain does not absorb very well."
3.0,It was to tight around the arms!
3.0,"Read the reviews and purchased my normal size 6. Still very tight. The foot bed length size is correct, but so much work for a “slip on sandal”. Now next size up isn’t available.<br />Material seems durable and very light weight.<br />**Size up one full size!"
3.0,"The fabric isn't the best quality. After a few weeks of wear and wash, the fabric sticks to itself and gets staticy very easily."
3.0,cute but darker than shown in photo and was too tight for me
3.0,The fit is great but the slit up the back is a little much.
3.0,I'm a medium and got one and it was tighter than I would have liked.
3.0,"I just tried these on and they fit very nicely, are VERY comfortable and seem to be of decent quality, although time will tell. I would have given it 5 stars but it didn't come with the bra extenders and strap clips as mentioned in the product description. Including those was kind of a big factor in my choice of these bras as opposed to the MANY other options on Amazon. But as for the bras themselves, well worth the money. Just a little disappointed with the missing parts."
3.0,"Got the 6-12 month, infant is 16lbs.  The fit is okay.  The onesie is short in torso but wide, so the neckline is wide and doesnt fit that great, but it would not have fit if I had gotten a smaller size."
3.0,Beautiful earrings but they would have gotten 5 stars is the picture was on the front AND back...thus earring 3 stars.
3.0,"Looks cute, love the color. The all cotton is a bit scratchy but wearable for small durations of time."
3.0,"I bought this blouse in extra large (I usually wear a large), and it is still pretty small.  It's tight on my arms and is barely long enough.  I fear when I wash it it will shrink up considerably."
3.0,"I love the designs themselves, but the geometry of them makes it such that the weight is so far forward that you need to use some sort of stopper behind the lobe to keep them in place. If the design had some slightly different curvature I think that wouldn't be a problem (and I personally find that sort of spiral more aesthetic). I tried slightly bending it to adjust but the metal is too brittle to be bent much, it will snap."
3.0,They are pretty but look cheap. You get what you pay for though.
3.0,I love the hat and all. Wish there was more pictures before I bought it. There was only one picture which shows the front and not the back. The back strap says<br />“speed gear.com” which I DEFINITELY do not like at all. Therefore it’s 3/5stars for me
3.0,"I really like the ring, just got it"
3.0,"This sweater runs small unfortunately. I usually wear a 1X but ordered 2X based on reviews and while it kinda fit, zipping it up would make it too tight. I hate that because it doesn’t come in 3X and it’s EXACTLY what I was looking for! Bummer."
3.0,"Ordered the medium in hopes it would look like a tunic... It didn't and since it's so thick it doesn't 'hang' well.  Nice shirt, just not the look I was hoping for."
3.0,The lining on the inside came apart from the edge quickly.  It's not the best bag for pools and beaches because it's not water resistant.
3.0,"This band looks nice and is made of heavyweight elastic. But my wrist is on the small side (6"") and when I tighten the band, the relatively large ""buckle"" sits in an awkward location. It also sticks out -  making it uncomfortable. See photos. All of the other elastic bands I have used have a much thinner buckle."
3.0,I ordered a 2 pack but only got 1 pair. Need some clarification
3.0,"The detail I  liked most on the green scrub was  the turned  up buttoned sleeve , however, the scrub was far cuter on the model in the picture then me. On me , it looked boxy and the fabric was like somewhat rough muslin. Finding it unflattering on me , I returned it."
3.0,"My glasses fit in the case and, since I won't use it more that a couple of times a day, it's acceptable.  My problems are some plastic ""strings"" that are stuck to the top of the case.  It's like it was drizzled by the leftover string off a glue gun and they don't want to come off.  I tried using a fingernail to break off the small one and succeed in gouging the case.  It is cheap and cheaply made, so buy at your own risk."
3.0,It was a fun addition to my steampunk outfit but it's really small and the clasp broke very easily.
3.0,Love the look of these but they aren't very durable. Broke within a week of receiving them.
3.0,"It just didn't look right on me. Looked great on my friend, but not on me."
3.0,"It’s okay , it did make me sweat a little ."
3.0,The gold came off right away and turned my fingers green
3.0,"While this may be a great dress for someone else, it didn’t do it for me. I’m curvy so thought the style would be right but I’m also only 5’2” so things just didn’t hit where they were supposed to on me. I thought the fabric was a bit thin and although the dress was cute on the page, it didn’t work for me. I did think it ran a bit small (but I’ve also put on a few pounds lately) but not enough that my other clothes feel tight. Color was good but also. Note that there is some puff on the sleeves which I didn’t like."
3.0,This jacket is not very complimentary to a full figured gal.  This jacket makes me look huge!  I'm not sure I will wear this!
3.0,I got them and LOVED them. Then one day put them in my purse and they were in piece by the time I got to my location. I still might repurchase them after I recover from this lost.
3.0,"The dress was alright for the price.  We bought them for my sisters wedding.  They fit in the arms and chest really but the waist was really loose and it looked sort of limp against the body.  Altogether, I think it’s a nice summer dress to do errands in but would be a LOT better with a belt around the waist."
3.0,I liked them ok. Didn't make much of a difference.
3.0,The pants are nice but fit big! Good quality!
3.0,on the modal it looks good<br />quality could be better for that money i think. untidy manufactured along the edges<br />but my husband still like it :)
3.0,"I wear a size 12 shoe, my current slippers are a size 12.  I ordered these slippers as a size 12 and the size tag says they are a size 12.  However, the slipper is MUCH too long.  More like a size 13 or 14."
3.0,These glasses are a little more oversized than the picture made them seem. Some people like them on me and others don't. I kept them because I didn't want the hassle of returning them.
3.0,"I really like the shirt, but it is a little small for a large and it is see through. I had to wash it and stretch it in the the bust area first and then wear a colored sports bra underneath. I would recommend ordering a size larger so you can wear a cami underneath."
3.0,Item was vastly smaller than expected. Photos had buyer believing the stones were much larger than the actual merchandize. I was disappointed with this purchase and the advertisement.
3.0,"After 3-4 times wearing this jacket, the fabric on the arms pilled up. Took a razor and shaved them off. Not too bad for the price."
3.0,The glasses are decent quality (considering the price) but the color is not at all what the picture looked like. Cute glasses but not what we were looking for.
3.0,the shirt is really cute and fits well but the lace on the top of the chest doesnt lay flat
3.0,This bag is super well made and I have people ask me where I got it all the time. I love it! I'm tempted to get a couple friends some Ecosusi bags for Christmas! Update 2/4/2016: The leather that holds the metal rings for the shoulder strap to attach to broke. The material seems weak and was cracking apart and broke in two places along the small strip of leather. I took away 2 stars because even though the rest of the bag is in great condition still I can't use it without the strap. Very disappointing.
3.0,"I had bought another pair of Sojos sunglasses and loved them, so I ordered these when they went on sale to have an extra pair. Unfortunately, I don’t care for this style. They don’t sit level on my face, and I’m not a fan of the nose piece (which is my fault for not checking this out- my other pair does not have nose pieces). They were pretty inexpensive, which is a positive"
3.0,"Like the way dress fits, but when i took it out packing i had a slight ripp in the back were i had 2 go get it sewed chiffion material is very thin,so if u purchase this product make sure you look over it real well i needed this dress for my trip to jamaica and i love how cool and comfortable it felt on me"
3.0,"The metal is thick and sturdy, but the stone has this weird circle inside that doesn’t change."
3.0,Great for a one and done experience but they were a lot more flimsy than I thought. They run small as well
3.0,Fits small ordered a size up and arms were still tight. Overall coat is very nice material and warm. Great for the price just buy big!
3.0,It's really pretty but can't read the scriptures I was alittle disappointed with that . But it is still really pretty.
3.0,I bought two of these. One was great. The second one was completely scratched. Every piece of the three l. It looked like it had already been used and returned. Super disappointed especially since the first one was exceptional. The letters also looked a bit rusted. I’ll be returning this one.
3.0,The stone looks really dull and not at all shiny!  It looked a lot nicer on the pictures posted before I ordered.<br />I can not recommend since I personally would not buy it again. I regret buying it. It is overpriced. I paid $14.38 for it. You can honestly find way prettier jewelry on eBay at a much cheaper price.
3.0,Its nice and fits well but the BMW logo from the actual fob case is missing. It looks strange because of that.
3.0,It's ok. It runs a little big and the fit is a little wonky. The lace patches don't stay down on the edges but it's ok for the price.
3.0,watch has fog under the glass after wearing it a few days.  I am a nurse.  I use it daily.
3.0,"The coat more or less fit but the skirt part did not sit right and i felt like I had 8 layers on me. plus the shoulders are sort of puffy which I was not expecting. I think this would work for smaller people, but not for plus size."
3.0,"Quality is good, but too large."
3.0,"It was cute at first, but once i started to REALLY use it, the strap broke off! I had to tie it back together, and now I don't use it anymore.  It's pretty cheap."
3.0,Great wearing glasses and all for price. Just disappointed in the leg breaking without any stringent action on them
3.0,They are cute but not practical. Mesh layer makes it extremely difficult to breathe
3.0,No maam. I am a 16 or 1X and this fit like a Large.
3.0,"is ok, perfect to wear a couples times..."
3.0,"Traditional 'pocket liner' type glasses pouch which will certainly offer great protection to glasses from abrasions and other dirt. Does however, offer negligible protection from crushing or being sat on :-("
3.0,We had to return this item.  I wanted to like this but the arms were way too short and the overall sizing was off.
3.0,Cool hat but it came kinda warped and the bill was bent
3.0,I brought 3 of these and one of them fell apart in less than a week. The only reason I didn’t return it is because I couldn’t collect all the beads.
3.0,They’re cute pants but the pockets don’t lay flat and made me look like I had bulges in my hips. Not flattering fit at all.
3.0,"I got this thinking that it would really fit in with my partners hippy side.  Unfortunately, I think it was a little better in the photos than it was on.  It actually looked a lot better on our 11 year old who wore it like a sun dress than it did as an ankle length skirt. I liked the tie died pattern and the color schemed, but it kind of ballooned around her waist and just didn't have a real flattering shape.  The Elastic is tight, but did not seem to finished."
3.0,"The ties look different in person as my photo shows. They look like cheap yarn that has been dipped in wax which cheapens the overall look of the shoe. Also, I got a larger size based on other reviews but it still ran small & was not as high (for me to call a boot) as their picture implies. If they changed the quality of the ties to leather & made a bigger size, I’d gladly add stars!"
3.0,Unfortunately one size does not fit all! I’m 27 inches in the waist and 40  in the hips and these shorts are just too big. They’re super puffy and look like parachute shorts lol I order black green white and blue and these green ones were the ones that looked the best... still too big and puffy. If your larger than me this could be a good option for you! They look better in pictures than in person
3.0,"I ordered these for my son to wear to an event he has coming up. In the pictures they look really elegant. In reality, they look rather cheap. I was disappointed. The black design looks like some sort of sticker. The edges are not clean and it gives it a wonky cheap look. I'm sure no one will notice from afar but it just didn't meet my expectations."
3.0,Have bought several over the years and they have been good. This one the pocket ripped the first time I put something in it.
3.0,This is super cute. I bought it for my daughter. But it is very see through. You have to wear something under it or you can see everything!!!
3.0,"As I unbuttoned the onsie, one of the snaps broke! Other than that, perfect quality."
3.0,cheap material but overall cute look.
3.0,The chain part started to get discolored after only a few wears. It’s pretty for the price. Only got to wear it about 5 times though
3.0,I bought the same size in the same brand in tan and they fit where is these ones were as if I bought an extra small when I bought a medium.
3.0,"I like it, however one of the eyelets (holes for the watch strap), specifically the one I was using, seemed to start fraying almost right away. We will see how long it holds out. Since it is nylon, perhaps the solution is simply using a hot nail (or similar thin circular piece of metal) to melt the edges of the eyelet.<br /><br />I will note that the other eyelet I switched two seems to hold out ok so far, no fraying. Maybe it is just one of them.<br /><br />Aside from that, the band it very nice -- I love the colors and the fit is perfect. Looks great on my watch."
3.0,Nice dress but didn't fit as expected.
3.0,Quality matches price.
3.0,This just looks like a sack on me I’m afraid. Something to wear around the house or pool.
3.0,"the tank is fine ,the built in bar is padded my fault for not asking."
3.0,Cute - as described in the selling point of it. After several months of wear it’s showing. The Finish is wearing off.
3.0,"This was pretty much what I was looking for.  The only issue is they don't hold the eyeglass arms well.  The coiled slip ring did just that; slipped when it shouldn't have.  My solution was to change it to a fixed ring by crushing it once it was in the best position.  They're usable, of course, maybe not for all eyewear."
3.0,The heart shaped ones are very hard to get in. They were what I was really wanting from the set
3.0,I only received 11of the 12 make sure you count your scarves
3.0,"These gym shorts were well made but too tight on me. I sent them back for a refund, which was an easy process. Great customer service!"
3.0,Has a strong smell in black color
3.0,Runs small but over all good tank.
3.0,Random colors so not too bad. Holds like a charm.
3.0,The neck closure is a knot and loop. The knot was too large to fit in the loop. I would have kept the shirt if not for this but I returned it. The cuffs seemed too large and covered my entire hand. Fabric was nice and there are small hidden hooks in the shirt opening to keep it closed which is nice.
3.0,"Might want to buy a size bigger....mine was little snug, but not too bad. looks good for St. Paddy's Day. Doesn't really stretch like some t-shirts do."
3.0,"Cute bag and colors. Changing pad that it comes with fell apart before I even got to use it. It has deep pockets so it's easy to lose things in the bag. Overall, cute colors but not very &#34;mommy&#34; friendly."
3.0,These 3 necklaces were extremely reasonable but the quality is plain Cheep.... would I do it again NO!
3.0,I have purchased several other hats in this brand and I love them but this one didn’t fit as well as the hats I previously purchased.  Not very comfortable and too tight if you have a lot of hair.
3.0,"They are okay. If you just need some cheap aprons, then these will work. The black one is a different material than the red and tan ones."
3.0,It's def ok.  Obviously for this price it's not great tailoring.  It looks great under a cardigan. Color pictured is pretty accurate.
3.0,I wanted to buy these gloves because I liked how they looked and it said in the description it had touch accessibility. I find out that they do not work with my touch screen. What a disappointment. I bought this particular one because I wanted to use it with my touch screen. I gave it a 3 only because I liked the style of it.
3.0,I bought a pair of these a few months ago and loved them. I decided to buy another pair. I was kinda disappointed that the second pair didn’t have the back phone pocket. Also the second pair has an elastic like band at the top. It creates a weird “pooch”.
3.0,Multiple sizes smaller that expected and I ordered 2 sizes larger.
3.0,"The fit my wife just fine, but not me, not happy, it said it's a unisex size, or one size fits all, not true, if you are larger than 5' 7 then dont buy, it won't fit!"
3.0,"The dress is okay but there are some things about the dress I don't love.  In the back where the pleats are, they are sewn rather strange and it makes the pleat stick straight out so it looks like you've got a tail trying to bust through.  I ironed and ironed it to get it to go down, and this helped but in the end I just had to deal with it.  I ordered the dress rather last minute for a wedding I was attending.  Besides the odd sewing of the pleats in the back, it was a lot of ironing just to get the wrinkles out and you need to snip off a lot of strings hanging off the dress.  When you are wearing the dress you need to make sure that the side sipper is tucked in because the top of the zipper, the unfinished part that is supposed to hide inside the dress, can easily poke out. All that said, the dress was pretty comfortable to wear, it fit about how I expected and I really like the front of the dress and the sleeves."
3.0,Comfort was great but suction not great. Water kept leaking in.
3.0,"I’m 5’7 and this shirt fit but it definitely shriveled up and fit like a bra! so there was hardly any room under my chest area, I lift my arms up and this didn’t work out for me."
3.0,"CHEEKY. I LOVE how the top fits but the ass is literally up my ass constantly. Some people are cool with that, I wouldn’t wear it in front of friends. The husband loves it though."
3.0,"Hard to fit items in due to cardboard inside the product, but still using it.  I like the print."
3.0,"We ordered these in a  10.5. He usually wears a 10. These are still snug. They look nice and of course he can move better on the dance floor.  The quality of build is just so-so. We paid  $70 for them and I would like to see better quality for the price. They did come with the wire brush and a shoe bag, but still I think the price is too high. We may send back. They don't seem any better than the mishion black and white shoes he got for $45."
3.0,"The dress was cute. It was very short on me and somewhat see through fabric. I can now see why the model in the picture looks like she's pulling the dress down. Cute print, but not as nice in person. I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,This was not the dress that arrived. Fits fine but the print was completely different.
3.0,I ordered a set but they sent me pants instead of shorts. Cute style & comfy but wanted the shorts.
3.0,I did not care for the way the pockets stuck out on my hips. Good quality material though!
3.0,I'm only 5'1&#34; and a size 10. There are built in hips didn't sit where they should have. The lining kept creeping up causing the dress to bulge. I ordered a Large and it was too tight. If you're short this is not the dress for you. The dress itself dropped sequins every time I took a breath and there's no stretch. You're best bet is to order larger to have it taken in and the alterations will cost you more than the dress itself.
3.0,"I love handbag hangers, I think this was a great idea. I thought I would have more variety since I was getting three. I received two exactly alike (butterfly) and one was plain with no design"
3.0,They fit well and are soft but I Expected better quality. Doesn't come close to VS.
3.0,"Closes with a buckle, so not so easy to get on and off.  Would be better with snaps."
3.0,It was tight on the upper body if you have boobs
3.0,"This was an okay purchase. It was a last-resort buy for Halloween since my toddler wanted to be a cat. The tail was very long. Probably 16-18 inches and had to be curled in order for my daughter to wear it and walk (age 4, average height). The ears are cheaply made of felt."
3.0,The medium top fit but felt a little tight. Medium Pants were perfect. I returned & then reordered for a size Large. Gosh I hope the pants won't be too big now!
3.0,"The skirt is pretty.  The fabric is clingy and thin.  I am 5'7"" and 125 pounds and is a snug fit."
3.0,Nice and warm and very soft.
3.0,"Quality of them was okay, some rhinestones are not lines up correctly and discolored."
3.0,Excellent craftsmanship but the anchor is extremely large.
3.0,Mui bonita pero muy pequeña. Aún que por el precio. No creo se pueda pedir mas
3.0,Rubbish!!! More than half don't work. Half of the other half works crappy. And the other half of the other half goes bad in a couple of days. Do your math. Rubbish!!!<br />Update:<br />Was able to fix most of them in less than 10 min. Bumping up from 1 star to 3 stars.
3.0,I didn't like this jacket. It is two plie and heavy in the arms. It's weird.
3.0,Fits as expected but a little sheer.  A slip is needed which may affect sizing.
3.0,I didn't realize when I ordered it that it's gold and not silver.
3.0,"Appears to be well constructed. I like the subtle design touches with the pleather drawstring eyelets and the red/white/blue tab on the left pocket. The only issue is the cut and fit does not look remotely close to the pictures when you wear it. These run big and baggy, more of a typical run off the mill cut sweatpants/joggers. If these joggers would have been the same as the pictures suggest then I would have bought the rest of the colors but then again they’re not so I have to return them."
3.0,One side and the wrong size
3.0,I dropped my glasses once and the frame broke around the lens
3.0,IHAVENT WORN IT YET.
3.0,The coat looks nice and is warm to wear but the sleeves are very short. Two inches of my wrist are exposed. Good thing I'm wearing sweaters.
3.0,"One sleeve longer than other, was still cool and nice embroidery"
3.0,The shoe feels bumpy shen worn
3.0,Fast shipping looks great
3.0,Jacket is great bt not warm. Yesterday was heavy wind and rain my phone was in my front pocket got wet.  Had outside jacket and fleece still cold.  Fits good<br /><br />Zipper on hoodie and pocket ripped not cooool  fixed it bt it broke again
3.0,"Ordered a large, I'm 5'10 170 pounds<br /><br />Material don't appear same as photo for that fitted shape. Real stiff and was a bit too big from what I normally over.<br /><br />And since I cursed with being so tall unfortunately it's way to short ehhhhh"
3.0,"I bought three of them; green, gold and white.  The green and gold are nice but the solid white one is JUNK.  cheap looking/feeling material,  sizing is off and the collar looks like a cheap t-shirt"
3.0,"The reason this only gets 3 stars is because there are only 2 snap buttons to button up this sweater, and the zippers on the sleeves are sewn on the outside so that the seems are visible..  This is apparently a function of style.  The actual material is comfortable, but the this would be more practical had the manufacturer had the sense to include enough snap buttons to actually fully button up--and thus be warmer (like a sweater is supposed to be) for the winter."
3.0,Band was to small for neck
3.0,This is the first pair of pasties I've purchased.  The silicone feels kind of funny on and sticks well. The edges didn't lay flat and the stickiness hurts to remove the pasties.<br /><br />Received at discount
3.0,"its kinda thin, it feels a little cheap. but it works though. its just, it feels so thin, but in the picture it looks big and fluffy im a little dissapointed."
3.0,"The fabric was nice, but the fit was kind of odd.  And don't believe the size chart.  It says a six should buy a large, and it was far too big."
3.0,"Wider than I expected, not sure how I feel about them. They'll work for what I am doing but they won't match everyone elses."
3.0,It's all right I bought it on oct. 8 and it still has not come but other than that it pretty
3.0,I was disappointed with the color and size.
3.0,The lenses did not fit my glasses. I have a pair of Costa Fantails and will be returning the lenses. Not sure if its my glasses or the lenses but the lenses were just slightly to big. The lenses and cleaning solutions are a nice touch though.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:48f48bb70a0d73cf57659e009c7ebd63]] This is a very strong material. im 5'9 272 lbs. It was tight around the breast area and arms. so I cut a line from the collar to just below my bustline and that took care of that.
3.0,Very heavy! Not what I had expected
3.0,quality is good but size is too small for her age
3.0,"It didn't look like the picture. It was broken, probably from the shipping."
3.0,These are the first Shirt Stays I have owned; so I cannot say these are terrific nor terrible relative to other shirt stays. What I can say is that I didn't like walking with these rubbing against my leg and so wore them for about half-a-day before abandoning them as a failed experiment.
3.0,They run a little small and are not squat proof. But overall very soft and comfortable. Good tummy control.
3.0,"It's a pretty ring but the metal is thin and bends very easily. Given this, not sure how well it will hold up over time."
3.0,Dress is beautiful but runs small. Should've ordered a size larger than usual
3.0,Tight in stomach area but love tge material.
3.0,Two smallThe product just too small for a normal size American man!
3.0,Wasn’t the style I was looking for but looks like the  photo
3.0,It's a cute concept but this is an Asian size so I ordered the XL.  I'm 5&#34;1 so it does fit like a dress.  But the shoulder & armpit area is really small
3.0,The fit is too tight around the torso.  I'll try a size 40 if they have it. The cup size is very good.
3.0,"Tighter and longer than expected. Zipper is difficult. It’s alright. I’ll probably add a belt and cardigan for color and interest, along with jewelry because it needs something."
3.0,A little tight. But cute. One came broken
3.0,The dress was shorter than expected and the material was heavier than I thought would be. I was very disappointed. No shape at all to it.
3.0,My daughter loves this dress-how comfortable it was and the pockets. The sleeves are not too tight. The royal blue is vibrant and has stayed after repeated washes and the fit for a 12 year old around 87lbs and 5 ft was exact without shrinkage. The reason I marked it down two stars was due to the picture above where the fabric came away from the neckline leaving a hole that isn’t fixable. She is really sad she can’t wear this dress anymore and we are past our return window but I would say to still take a chance and get the dress as ours may have been an anomaly.
3.0,Looks as described but feels pretty cheap in person and it’s very stiff.
3.0,"This bag was a med bag like describes , goes over shoulder with ease , color is Majorca blue , wish it had another spacer or zip pouch , it only has 1 small one for lipstick<br />Or keys ! That's all ! When I got it I had to stuff towels in it to regain shape"
3.0,The adjustment clip let go of the end of the band on each one while I adjusted them. I threaded them through and clipped it down again and they seem to hold.<br />The shirt clips on one set do not clamp all the way down and won't work without a  good seam to grab on to. This is a problem since some of my under shirts have lost the bottom seam but are otherwise good.
3.0,"All great quality and fit great, but on pair looked used, super weird and kinda gross."
3.0,No much support and they fit kinda weird and uncomfortable
3.0,"This mock top is great. The fit is slimming, the black color is a rich black, it is not scratchy, and it washes well.<br />However, I still have to comment on the quality. I either got a random defective article of clothing from a good company OR they simply do not have great seamstresses, machines, etc. and aren’t a great company making quantity over quality clothing.<br />As you can see in my photo, I wore this top for ONE HOUR before I noticed a small thread popping out on the end of the sleeve cuff. I barely pulled at it, gently, and slowly over the next hour of wearing it, it continued to unravel on its own until the entire cuff was undone and I was left with the picture above. Now, luckily, my momma taught me how to sew - so I can easily fix this bugger - however, TIME is a commodity and is just as precious as money these days. I did not purchase a new top and wait for it to come in the mail, just to have to turn around the same day and sew it! Sheesh. That part was very disappointing."
3.0,The material quality is bad. But the fitting is nice. After a wash it wont stay :-)
3.0,"The picture makes it show that’s it’s a beige color, the beige is actually a light grey. Looks are deceiving. Still looks nice, just not what I expected"
3.0,"I really wanted to like this cover-up, but I found it unflattering. You can't really see in the picture, but there is extra fabric (an inch-wide &#34;ribbon&#34; stitched down the sides) that I didn't like at all.  Nothing specifically wrong with item, just not right for me.  Returned."
3.0,"This is a cute dress but it fits a little weird - it’s very stretchy material so you can pull it all the way down to have it fit tighter and it will fall mid-calf, but if you pull it up and have it be baggier around the waist, you can really get it as short as you want. It’s tight around the thighs but stretchy like it’s suposoed to be. The material was a little weird, very shiny and almost looks like athletic apparel. Overall happy with my purchase but probably won’t  wear it to a formal event like I was planning to"
3.0,Ok used as Halloween costume
3.0,"great for an everyday top, good value."
3.0,"cute top, but definitely off in sizing.  I'm a 38C, usually a large in bikini tops.  this LARGE could fit a 40DD very easily.  the bottoms are small. I am a size 28 in jeans, 37 hips, usually wear a medium in bikini bottoms and these large bottoms definitely dig in. won't wear the bottoms."
3.0,Quality of the guages were good. I returned this kit because I wanted the larger sized tapers and the largest sizes only came with tunnels which are very hard for me to get into my ear lobes. I only got about 34 out of 50 peices however.
3.0,Really don't like that these pants are not big enough and NOT true to size like some people said.  We will see in a few weeks if they last.
3.0,I liked this hat but it was too large for my head. Perhaps for someone with a fluffier head of hair. Had to return.
3.0,"These a great way to organize luggage of any kind. They are, however, very flimsy and thin. If you're looking for something sturdy, I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
3.0,Picture looks better than when you get it. Cheap but does what it supposed to do
3.0,I liked it. Just wish there more in each pack
3.0,I have medium man's head and these were tight.
3.0,"Glasses function well enough, but I'm not a fan of how the tortoise shell finish, which I do like, transitions to funky colors in the lower half of the frame."
3.0,They were too long. Haven't tried them on since I washed them. Hope they shrink up a bit.
3.0,Not with the orginal inscription
3.0,"Appears to be good quality for the price point, but much too large for a 32B."
3.0,"This jacket is somewhat small. It fits, but is snug."
3.0,Shorter than the picture depicts.
3.0,It would look good on a sterling chain.  I is always a pain to set the hearts on chain to make it look.
3.0,"I have a small wrist for a man, about 7 inches (18 CM). The small size bands are awkward and just barely fit and I wish I had ordered medium. If your wrist circumference is 6 inches or less than the small size is about right. Anything larger go with medium or bigger."
3.0,"This belt is exactly what I was looking for.  Except the musty smell.  So strong I could smell it before opening the package.  I washed it twice using Downy once and hung it outside for several hours.  Still is so strong I can  smell it from over 5 feet away.  Quality is good,  Very comfortable. I will keep trying to get the smell out."
3.0,kinda cheap. done't look as good in person then it does in the picture. it's not itchy and it's comfortable so 3 stars
3.0,"This replacement band works better than the last one I bought from a different vendor however this one does have its own issues.  The clasp does not remain closed; like the holes are too big to seal around the metal button.  Luckily, there is an extra strap that momentarily keeps the strap around your wrist, but you can tell that the clasp once again unlatched and must be reclamped. If the manufacturer could fix this problem, they'd have a winner."
3.0,Cute but really tough plastic. And I don't think the handles are tough enough to deal with the roughness of the plastic so we'll see how long all the little pink Parts last.
3.0,"This is a thin knit material, like a t-shirt material almost.  I bought it for my sister who works in a building with an extremely unpredictable thermostat so she wanted something lightweight to wear over her light shirts if she needed it.  So I suppose she likes it, it looked like it was a bit clingy though when she put it on.  The colors were nice and bright though which is exactly what she wanted.  I just wasn't impressed with the type of material."
3.0,It lasted a few months before changing colors.
3.0,"Love the pendant but the chain is awful. It's super scratchy and catches on everything, including my hair!"
3.0,"This dress was cute, but it was too short for me so I had to return it. I am 5‘7“. The stress would be better for somebody  5‘4“ or shorter."
3.0,This blouse came wrinkled and normal washing and drying did not remove the wrinkles.
3.0,It would have been 5 stars except the contrast in colors on pendant shown is completely different than what I received. I expect some variation but when I opened it and it was solid green with no other colors at all I felt it was misleading. It may have been part of a miss agate at some point but the pendant was a solid very dark green and not something I would've chose for that price. The other one I ordered from this vendor was similar enough that I was happy so I guess if your the gambling type you have a 50/50 chance of being happy with your order.
3.0,"the pendant was great, but the bracelet was too big and you cannot adjust it, so make sure you look at dimensions and see that it fits,"
3.0,"I ordered this in &#34;red stone&#34; and the bag itself was fine but the color was off and it looked somewhat pinkish brown, it was not an attractive color. I gave it away."
3.0,The blue one I bought material was better than this one so I don’t like that it’s de through and it’s not same material.
3.0,Great fun for the 4th of July. Gave these to my mom as a gag gift for her birthday (very close to the 4th) and she loved them.
3.0,More aqua than navy.  It's pretty but I wanted something to go with navy better.
3.0,"Really cute, but delicate.  Broke before the night was over :(  Costume-use only."
3.0,Still not enough padding for my feet
3.0,"When these arrived the red gem from one of the earrings had fallen out.  I had to glue it back in.  Otherwise, they're cute."
3.0,It’s a 7 diamond instead of 5. It’s stull cute but I did want the 5 which I believe is a cuter earring... it did come with 2 earrings.
3.0,"I like these, but there is a white mark/stitching up the back crease that looks like the fabric is ripped or stained from afar. I can only wear these in the house."
3.0,"I like the sock, but the first description  is 6 prs of nude socks. It came as 1 black, 1 gray, 1white and 1 nude."
3.0,"For my purposes I find the material too thick and rough, especially around the seams.  More comfortable worn inside-out. May become softer with repeated washings."
3.0,"Wife and I both liked the design/color, but unfortunately it was way too big. Ended up giving it away :'("
3.0,It's okay.  The chain is very small.  It is definitely a choker with no room.
3.0,Like the title says designed just for a 38mm so the locking mechanism and band are too small for the 42mm version.
3.0,"Mostly the fit was ok, I’m about 5’7 really needed to be about a 1” to 1.5” to be perfect length"
3.0,"Fit is nice, fabric is not. Very thin and almost a silky fabric."
3.0,"For the price I couldn't expect a lot, but the sides of the glasses squeeze my head in just the right spot to cause a headache after wearing them for 10 minutes. So if your head is slightly bigger than average, like mine, save yourself a headache. But if you have a smaller head they should be fine."
3.0,"Too loose and too sheer, not very supportive. I will have to take it in myself and see it it fits better."
3.0,"I went by the sizing guide and other people's reviews for fit. I'm usually a S/M, size 4, so I got a medium. It was was too big around the waist and so much extra material from being to large. Wanted to wear this high waisted so I got the longer skirt. I'm 5'7&#34; and it was way too long.<br /><br />However the material, quality, and color were very nice. Bummed it didn't fit. Might buy in smaller shorter size."
3.0,I'm petite. Looks like a nightshirt on me.
3.0,This dress is really pretty.  The slit in the front is quite revealing though.  If I had time before my christmas party to put some stitches in it to keep it from showing so much leg I would have kept it.
3.0,I love the shoes but they fit a little tight
3.0,"Thin and cheap material. No tag so cant tell front from back, neckline very high either way. Listing said color was grey more of greenish."
3.0,"Bought these in a small for my 60lb 9 year old. They are a bit loose, but she actually likes them that way. They are a nice, thick material. However, the straps are sewn weird so when you tighten them past a certain point, they get this weird loop that pops out. Regardless, they’re nice did the price!"
3.0,Works well but when buying pay attention to the size chart because runs a little small
3.0,Front pocket tore within the first week I had it. Did nothing strenuous in it...not well made at all.
3.0,A very cute Cap but kind of large and looks like a box.
3.0,Extremadamente grandes
3.0,"A little bit higher waisted than I expected, and runs a little bit small. Nice fabric, resistant. Feels nice."
3.0,"I ordered this in May 2016 but only gave it to my 10-year old daughter for Christmas 2016. It's a large watch for a little girl and the metal strap was far too big so we brought it to a watch shop and got the strap changed to a black leather one. It looks very nice on her now despite it being big, the owl is cute and most importantly, it is still keeping time quite well at present. Happy with it, giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because of the strap.<br /><br />Update on 26 March 2017: The seconds hand has fallen off and keeps sliding around inside the watch. Otherwise it is still keeping time. Have downgraded to 3 stars."
3.0,I do love this headband. It's very cute however it's obvious that they don't put much thought into making it. The edges of the material are frayed and I had to cut it myself to make it straight. But it did come from Beijing and I paid almost nothing for it so I guess I got exactly what I paid for.
3.0,"Great laugh from these fun socks. There was, however, a fair amount of shrikage after wash."
3.0,Size up next time
3.0,Love the earrings however they broke after the first wearing. It appears the hoop was bent and things fell out of place. Disappointed.
3.0,The design looks like image. But quality of earrings is not great. The closure is difficult to close. And doesn’t quite align with hole.  So it hurts a bit to get on my ears.
3.0,Beautiful pendant but the wings are so sharp it scratches your skin
3.0,Felt weird on my foot
3.0,good looking watch!
3.0,It’s cute and the outside is soft but the inside kind of has that towel like material which is okay if you’re wearing a shirt underneath. I like to wear my sweatshirts pretty loose so I ordered a size up and it fit like my regular size so maybe order 2 sizes up.
3.0,"Nice hat, loved the look, wish it had fit my head, seems to run small"
3.0,"Given as a gift, so I can’t comment on the fit.<br />But the outside was soft.<br />I thought the inside would be Sherpa as well, but instead it’s a slick cheap tarp like material..."
3.0,Appears to have some quality
3.0,"Even though I returned this dress, I did think the quality was great! It was just a bit larger than I would have liked. I didn't realize the dress had pockets when I purchased. I almost kept it for that reason alone. There is a side zipper as well, which I liked. The top portion was stretchy but the seam between the top and the skirt does not have any stretch."
3.0,VERY CUT AND BRIGHT BUT FALL APART VERY EASILY. DID NOT LAST.
3.0,"Seems to me that 6 dollars is crazy high shipping, and handling, for a 99 cent bandana. I actually like it now that its stretching out and finally fits my big fat heat. I saw in reviews how people complained that its only one side of the design. I see no downside with that. When it is fully broken in I doubt it will have much design left anywhere. I suppose I should add that I think it's bad that its &quot;Made in China&quot;.<br /><br />I will share a story. I hate hats made in china. I have a big fat American head, and those little headgears don't fit. One time up at the story I was complaining my struggle and old boy on the barstool, turns to me, &quot;Not my John Deere hat&quot;. I laughed because he took it off, sure enough...Made in China."
3.0,I like this set but it could use some improvements.  For reference im an apple shaped size 18 and I ordered the xxl. The top is very baggy on me.  The bottoms fit good. The elastic on the legs is very roomy and not too tight.  I really think i like the idea of this set more than the set itself. The ruffles are cute but kinda gives me baby bloomers vibes which isn't sexy. I really would like one of the sets without ruffles but can't find any in xxl. So frustrating.
3.0,"It is the perfect size for me - not as big as a tote, but enough room for a small planner. My main complaint are the metal rings attached to the front metal pieces. There is a little gap in the metal rings that should have been melted together, but because of the gap, the rings catch and scratch the metal attachments on the front, and the handles almost came off. I put glue in the gaps to try to fix the problem. I would also love it if there were one more ring added to the handles, so that it could more easily be a shoulder bag. The cross body straps work great, but I prefer the shorter straps on my purses.<br />Edited to add 11 months after purchase: Disclaimer that I am fairly rough on my purses, but I do think it should last longer than a year. The faux leather is ripping off the handles, and the side metal rings for the cross body strap are starting to rip out of the purse. The fabric of the center pocket also ripped a few months ago. The center zipper broke several months ago.  I love the style of the purse, but for the price I could get one cheaper at Ross that would last a little longer."
3.0,"The band itself appears to be of high quality, and I haven't had any durability issues, but the metal clasp seems to be of lower quality than OEM.  In three years running with Garmin OEM, I never had any issues with skin irritation, but I've had to resort to taping my wrist before runs because this one causes irritation and itching.  Maybe not an issue for most, but if you have sensitive skin, proceed with caution."
3.0,These do not block out as much noise as ear plugs. Just mutes the sound a little bit.
3.0,"Simple dress, okay fit, but very thin."
3.0,It would not close around me. I am a larger sized person and it didn't fit as I hoped. Other than that it was perfect for the Seuss dress day.
3.0,The arms are a tad short on me and it’s a little small but still wearable. I ordered a medium . Im 126lbs and have a 32d cup size
3.0,Bought this for my niece. It's a key chain... So I wasn't expecting much to begin with. It's got Scooby-Doo on it. (probably counterfeit) but it is really thin material. Won't last long with constant use.
3.0,It's runs very small..I got medium. It fit but little snug. I would up size if like it little roomy.
3.0,It's fine enough. Doesn't provide an amazing amount of support but it's fine enough.
3.0,"This shirt is a lot smaller than what they describe in the size chart.  I would order at least one size up, maybe two.  The fabric on the back is thin and if it's too tight the fabric bunches up above the buttons.  It's also not as dark as the gray pictured.  It's more of a light gray.  Overall a great shirt."
3.0,Bought one for my daughter for Christmas and it is quite oversized and kind of gaudy looking
3.0,"The material is nothing like it looks in the pictures. Purchased a small based on reviews. I am 5’2” and 120 pounds. However, there was no stretch to it, and it was far too long. This dress would have been perfect if I were 20 pounds lighter and 4” taller! The return process was super super easy, so I am thankful for that!"
3.0,These leggings fit well and are fairly stylish BUT from the time I even picked up the package I noticed a very strong and unpleasant sweet perfumy odor in the fabric. It's extremely off putting. I have washed them three times now and it still exists.  Ugh.
3.0,Did not fit Morgan silver dollar or peace dollar.
3.0,"Too large for smaller adults. I'm a 5' 3"" inch tall female and it's way too big for my face. Nice design otherwise."
3.0,"I can see how people think this purse is both bigger and smaller than they expected. It's a lot bigger looking on the outside, but inside is surprisingly crammed.. Not many pockets for holding different things, and the purse is so deep that stuff disappears easily. However, I do like that it's big enough to hold a lot without looking stuffed. The fabric is sturdy, almost like a faux leather but a little softer. It looks cute on my shoulder with the small straps. It'll do for now, but I wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,"I think the dress is beautiful, but the small was more of a large for me. I kept it so that I could have it taken in."
3.0,It looks nice and my wife likes it but it's a bit tricky to get the back (tail) attached due to how it is shaped. Ear size plays a big role in how it looks when finally attached as smaller ears fit with it better while larger ears it folds and bends.
3.0,Began to peel after a month.
3.0,Little on the small side
3.0,"I am fairly happy with the ring I ordered. It is a very nice replica of the original, and I love the way it looks.  I get a lot of compliments on it.  It does however, have a noticeable flaw in the outer circle of stones, the setting on one stone is obviously misshaped. In addition, the large blue stone, mimicking the sapphire, has already scratched.  I am not sure how this happened, but a very long large scratch is across the top of that stone. I am very careful with my jewelry, so this really surprised me. For a cheap replica it is not bad."
3.0,Color fades after a few wears
3.0,Like this dress with the exception on the pockets. They stick out.
3.0,"I was excited to receive this item at a discounted rate, and although it arrived quickly and is engraved nicely it does look a little flimsy.<br /><br />The length of the necklace is perfect, and the letter engraved was done nicely. The medallion is nice, it's the chain itself that seems a little flimsy, but still an overall nice product.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are solely mine."
3.0,Not very good quality for the price
3.0,Too small....could barely get over my head.
3.0,"Everything's good except the massive size of this thing. Stiff, thick leather that always lets me know it's there but cards aren't easy to slide in and out of card pockets. Otherwise, a good, sturdy wallet that needs some  picture holders and ID holder"
3.0,Its nice but seems a little cheap
3.0,Was going to wear for a disney themed wedding.  It made me look &#34;hippy&#34;.
3.0,"3 stars because I returned it because it was too small but so cute. It made me sad but it was pulling because of how small it was. I am 5’4, 123lbs and 34B and got a medium which was too tight. I have no idea if a large would fit. I ended up getting a whole different suit from amazon."
3.0,The design was cool and my teenage brother loved it but the snaps on the wallet were subpar at best. I don't foresee them lasting long.
3.0,"I bought 3 of these for work. I love the 3/4 sleeves and the flowey middle to hide my stomach. The collar is a nice touch, looks classy and the shirt material is very comfortable. My one complaint is the all three shirts, right about the position of the button on my pants, have several small holes. I wish the material was more durable."
3.0,"Daughter in law is happy with it, but the bottoms were too small and she's pretty petite."
3.0,agree with most of the other reviews. the functions are a bit illegible at night for me.
3.0,I think this clicker is very beautiful! My only downside is that it fits very snug on my nose to the point where I can’t wear it for long. Also if anyone has any suggestions on how to modify the jewelry to fit perfectly for my nose PLEASE let me know!!
3.0,"It's shines very well. But it just looks fake, like it's bought from a 25 cent machine."
3.0,nice but not large enough
3.0,It was ok. Not comfortable or silky tho.
3.0,It's a little small. I carry a large bi-fold wallet. Only the bottom half is protected with this. It would be great if it were larger and you could trim it to fit your needs.
3.0,I was disappointed when I saw the actual product. There is no shine to them and they were smaller than i anticipated. If one is looking for understated earrings then go for it. They're good for the price but not what I was looking for. Be prepared to wait for a long time for delivery as they come from China.
3.0,"They only offered this in small which I normally wear, however this was too small and they did not offer a medium."
3.0,"I am not a dainty person by any means but thought this was much larger than the picture looked. I would have preferred something a little smaller in width, more feminine, and a bracelet that would look nice on a woman's wrist. I'll keep it but if I saw it first I wouldn't have purchased it."
3.0,"I loved the design on the dress and it was great material, but the sizing is way off. I ordered a large as i have bigger hips and a bigger butt. It was very big, it made me look chubbier than i am. I did however order a medium and it was beautiful. I wore it to a Luau and it went perfect. My jean size is an 8/10 and top is a medium/large, if that helps. My mom did fall in love with this dress and it fit her great. She wears a size 12/14 and large/xlarge shirt."
3.0,My wife loved it the heart and ring are beautiful but the chain isn't
3.0,The socks are actually very nice but I guess my calfs are bigger than XL
3.0,"Pros: This hat is crushable/packable, which is the main feature I desired since I bought it for an upcoming vacation. It fits well, not to tight, not too loose, and the optional chin strap is a nice feature.  By the way,  some reviewers mentioned that they did not receive the chin strap. It comes in a separate little plastic bag,  so make sure you look for it with the rest of the packaging. Ordered the Khaki color which is a nice neutral, will go with a lot. The brim is nice and wide, which will help keep the sun off my face & neck.<br />Cons: I expected the black band to be removable, so that I could tie scarves or other colored bands around it, but it's glued on. Would have to put something wider over it if I wanted to cover it. The brim is flimsier than what I expected based on the photo. I wish it was stiffer. You can't really shape it, it just sort of flops where it wants to. But no so much that flops in your face. So for the price, it's not too bad and I'll keep it. but I may keep looking."
3.0,Too thick and fluffy... needs to be thinner to fit better
3.0,Nothing wrong with this product. It worked the way it’s supposed to but I ordered the wrong strength & didn’t have time to return it before going on vacation.
3.0,"Dress is great. Sizing is small, had to return mine & get the next size up"
3.0,These boots are ok if you need a quick pair of boots but don't think they will last you more than 10 wears. after that the boots start to fall apart. oh and also they are not comfy whatsoever !!! so like i said if you need a quick pair of boots then they are great but thats about it.
3.0,They were very pretty but have really stretched out after wearing them for a few weeks
3.0,"Nice sweater, but there is a branding on the corner that i did not notice in the picture."
3.0,Runs very small /tight
3.0,"It’s lovely. However I didn’t notice before I bought it, it is misspelled. The description stated “No matter how old,” it said “not matter how old”"
3.0,"2 friends have this dress and it looks great on them.  No so much on me.  It's better on curvy figures.<br />Size L  - 36DDD / 5'3"" / 160.<br />It fit but didn't work with my figure."
3.0,"Looking at it, it did look like a good lanyard. However, after a few months the lanyard stretch out SO MUCH. The lanyard was like a tail and was literally dragging on the floor as I walked."
3.0,"These fit very well and are comfortable, but you will have fuzz balls stuck between your toes and find them all over your house"
3.0,A little small more for a child.
3.0,"I got these for protecting my eyes from the bitter cold in the northeast on my bicycle commute.  I was hoping that the anti-fog would work out, it didn't.  They fog up on every ride.<br /><br />Otherwise, they work pretty well.  I'm guessing I'll use them in the warmer months of spring where my eyes still tear up from the wind."
3.0,Such a cute outfit! The only complaint I have was the very slow shipping speed. Order this a season prior to wanting to wear it because it will take that long to get it there.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
3.0,The front portion was shorter
3.0,"They look nice, But not  like the picture."
3.0,i love the top but the bottoms are very baggy in the back and hang down so i don't wear the bottoms but love the top and wear it all the time with different bottoms!!
3.0,The size chart was off. I normally wear a large but it would not button
3.0,Cute shirt but it's huge! A size small is a 6/7 and is very boxy. I'll be returning for a smaller size
3.0,"I just got my watch and it fits good, I have a larger size wrist and it fits me. The only gripe I have about it is that the light is not bright enough for me to read the face when I turn it on. Overall for fifteen bucks however, it is a good buy."
3.0,"They are really soft and comfortable, the color is odd, I ordered a wine red but it looks more like dark fushia. Not really in the red tone at all."
3.0,"I ordered a size up because of the reviews that mentioned the chest area tends to be tight. It ended up being way too big, but the chest seam still sat at a weird part making the attempted baby doll style look like I was wear a sack of potatoes.  Obviously a smaller size would not make the seam drop lower where it should be, so I did not exchange sizes.  I wanted to love it, but it wasn't for me."
3.0,"I needed for an older Giro helmet, but found that the adjuster would not keep its position.  After taking it apart I figured out that it was poor part quality - the left side molded part was had some molding flash which prevented the tooth from properly engaging the adjusting strap.  That's at least an hour of my life I won't get back."
3.0,"These are not compression tops. I am 58, 137 pounds and purchased a size small. They are formfitting, but not at all compression. They are also someon these are not compression tops. I am 58, 137 pounds and purchased a size small. They are formfitting, but not at all compression. The White top is somewhat see-through."
3.0,Sleeves are very tight.  Sleeves seem to be disproportionately small for the overall size of the dress.  Disappointed in it.
3.0,"I bought the 4XL, and although this suit is very cute, my 42DDD chest could not fit in this suit. There was either major side boob, on they were squished down. So it's a return for me."
3.0,"A nice compliment to the bracelet, good attention to detail, but small in size which diminishes it’s impact. Was a bit tarnished but polished up well."
3.0,Sweater fits great but the sleeves go on for days!
3.0,the lenses keep falling out they were cheap so as always you get what you pay for
3.0,"My daughter loves it with all its music, camera, but it was not IP rated so water easily get in and broken down."
3.0,This shirt fits as expected but is thin and boxy.  It does not look or feel like it should have cost that much.  It's a $15 quality shirt. Sad...
3.0,top doesnt cover the girls well enough to e used without a coverup
3.0,"These things fall/slip down my hips like nobody's business when running/walking. And I have wide hips/big butt, so you would think they have SOMETHING to hold onto. Instead, they slip. Would not buy again."
3.0,"Too tight in the chest, I am a 38DDD."
3.0,"Bottoms fit perfectly, but the top for an XL is extremely small. Looks like maybe it would fit a C cup at best"
3.0,These are cute besides the funny line in the middle of the bridge of the nose. Gave mine away.
3.0,The torso length is extremely short.  Nice quality but the fit isn't great.
3.0,"Bought these for my wife. She like them, but her hands get cold too easily."
3.0,"I would love to give this swimsuit 5 stars as the quality was great and the color was beautiful. HOWEVER, the sizing is absolutely ridiculous. I read every last review and looked at photos that others submitted before I decided to purchase a Large in this swimsuit. My measurements - 34D-26-40. The top was a joke- There was nothing large about the cup size. I had my roommate try it on who wears a 32A and the cups fit her perfectly (the band around the back of the top was a tad bit loose for her small frame). The bottoms …. sigh. They ALMOST had it right. The material that covers the crotch/butt thong area is very tiny. I was going for skimpy, but if I wore it (and you have my measurements) my pubic area would be exposed and my butt crack would still show. When my roommate tried (we both tried with our leggings on btw) on the bottoms, the skimpy material was the same exact issue."
3.0,Cute but the orange is so right you could wear it deer hunting! Wish I knew that and I would have selected a different color
3.0,It's pretty snug definitely not meant for curvier girls I'm 5'10&#34; and 160 pounds but I have a big booty - Definitely get it a size larger
3.0,this is a ok dress. kind of plain looking but the material isn't too thin.  I could see myself wearing it if I don't find something I like better. I ordered the 8 which was too big.  I will probably try a 6 and see if I like it better.  my measurements are  30 (G cup)-29-36. I weigh 120. I normally wear a size 6 but thought I'd order up. definitely not necessary for this dress. I am 5'2&#34; and I was surprised it only came to my knees. that's a good thing
3.0,"Nice selection of colors and a nice amount all at once, but they just look very cheaply made. Definitely not great quality."
3.0,"It  was fun for my dad dress up in this traditional Japanese 88th birthday outfit.  Sadly, the special gift box it came in arrived damaged."
3.0,"I purchased this scarf because I love the look of ombre and the gradient described in the listing and shown in the pictures was attractive to me. Unfortunately, while this is a pretty scarf, it is not what i thought I was buying. The metallic around the edges is quite wide and very pronounced. The blue inside the metallic edges has no visible gradient, just a slightly different shade in a square at each corner. I was excited when I ordered this scarf but disappointed with what I received."
3.0,"I received this for Christmas, and while the description says it's a patch, it is screen printed onto the fabric. The screen printing does seem like it is quality, but I'm kind of disappointed that it is not embroidered/sewn on patch."
3.0,"I bought this thinking it would be the same as the super soft one I bought at Costco last year. Though the brand is the same, it’s definitely not as soft and seems cheaply made. Not sure why this is. Good for cheap lounge wear."
3.0,I ordered my husband's normal size which is large and this shirt was twice the size it should be.
3.0,"These leggings are a pretty color, and while not the softest leggings I have ever worn, had a nice feel to them. Unfortunately, they are quite thin and show every pair of underwear I own through them, including thongs and string underwear. I am 5'4 and fluctuate between 115 & 120lbs.  Currently I weigh 115 and these leggings fit as if they were painted on.  They are not thick enough to hide any flaws, so even though I am thin, these leggings still present a challenge to wear. These would be nice to wear with a long top that covers the top portion of the leggings, but that isn't really my style. If I ordered again I would try a size up, but I'm not sure that would make a difference due to the material and thickness of the leggings."
3.0,Love it just too large.
3.0,"I bought a large and it was enormous. I am 5'4, 135 lbs and very pear shaped. It is a nice material though. It was a very awkward length on me."
3.0,"Bought xxl because I like my jammies big, but it fit like an xl."
3.0,They shrunk can’t wear them at all
3.0,I have several other gaiters from another company but with this pandemic going on I thought I'd order these to give me some backup.  They are very thin and very loose and kept falling off my face.  If you just want something bunched around your neck for warmth they would be fine.
3.0,"Was not to believable for me,I like  less of a diamond look"
3.0,Runs small! Order 1 size larger!
3.0,"Honestly, my biggest issue is that there’s not much padding on it, so it’s not prtecting your laptop at all. Overall I love the design, the laptop fits great with a little extra wiggle room (which is expected).  I’m excited to have a pirate theme to my laptop all around!"
3.0,Nice wish the graphics were bigger.
3.0,Very Very smal
3.0,The colors are great in this piece. It is very small though. I went ahead and got an XL just in case and it's still a tight fit to get on but once it's on it is nice and feels comfortable. I could hear the stitches popping so hopefully it holds up ok. Thankfully I was planning on losing more weight before summer so here's to hoping it fits better by then. ORDER UP! Especially if you have larger thighs.<br /><br />Shipping and receiving was very quick and nice!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount or for free in return for my honest review
3.0,"I have had two pairs of these mittens. Both pairs have the same defect where the thumb connects to the palm.  If you don't have to do anything with you hands or have a tapestry needle to fix the mittens, this is no problem.  Otherwise they are cute mittens!"
3.0,"these pants look great, but for 90 dollars each, I have a gray and black, the color fades too fast, less than 2 months. They do wick liquid relatively well, it's just that the seat and pockets lose dye too fast for the price you pay."
3.0,great fit nnot so great material for a fall/winter dress its too thin
3.0,Cheap fabric.  Sides are scrunched up too much.  It makes me look &#34;hippy&#34; which I don't need.  Probably works for a younger and skinnier person.  The pattern is nice though.
3.0,"Loved this apron, but the side string ripped out after maybe 3days of use."
3.0,"Not a bright rose gold color, somewhat coppery."
3.0,Excuse my toes lol as far as the toe ring you get what you pay for it is cheaply made and will break very easily if bent to much it's cute but just be careful with it.
3.0,"I have 18” calves at the largest circumference measured and it’s hard to find any compression sock of similar length to be able to fit over it - but these socks do!<br /><br />So why the 3 stars then?  Although the thickness of the product is definitely welcomed, I’m afraid the product fit will loosen in the same way such as the compression wear that under armour made popular.<br /><br />I have two perfect low cut running socks that are made of different material each (iniji and I forgot the other brand) and if they can mimic or use the same materials, while keeping the compression features of this product, it would be an instant 5 stars<br /><br />A positive is that they label left and right foot, though I doubt that honestly matters.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that if you wear 4E wide shoes, they’ll look a little funny since these socks aren’t made for wide feet, despite the compression aspect of it."
3.0,Deceivingly small.was a gift to friend and there is not as much lapis as shown
3.0,Good product but doesn’t cover face as much without falling down.
3.0,Not for plus size wrist people however very beautiful beads minded come apart with everyday we're only for special occasion however the product was beautiful
3.0,"I've ordered a couple of Ema Jane bow sets in the past and was excited for these too. After getting them, I'm a bit disappointed so far. Several of the bows have ends coming out and drops of hot glue clearly visible on the flower. Also, it looked as though the gold and black flowers had the eyelets punched into the lace together, with the gold on top of the black. So the black flower had a bunch of little gold fabric bits around the eyelets that had to be picked off. We'll make sure to use them, but not as happy with them as the other sets we've gotten."
3.0,"Looks better in the picture, but When you put it on looks nice.. the dress is ok"
3.0,"There is no real hinge between the ear-pieces and the lenses. It is just a force-ft, with little tiny nubs that serve as a pivot point. Any rough handling, and they come apart, and you need force them back together.  On the positive side, this makes them extremely light weight"
3.0,im still trying to fit in it. lol but i think it will work once i lose a little more weight
3.0,"Outfit is beautiful and looks great but be warned, the light pink on the back is COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH 😑 75% of my rear is completely visible."
3.0,"Runs small so just give it to my 9year old daughter and she loves it. but good quality,soft and thick"
3.0,"But they aren't. The oxidized silver gives them that antique look. Since the ear pieces do not work properly, I will have to fix them myself. I have the wire and the tools and so it should be fine when I am done. Looking at them, they would make a cute necklace too."
3.0,Ordered according to size chart. Pants are too small. Need to order bigger than chart says. And it didn't come with a sash like in the photo. That was a bummer.
3.0,"I like the feel and it works well, but the arms fall off of the sunglasses all the time and were made very cheaply. I can put them back together but it's annoying to do."
3.0,It runs large. Very pretty! Did not fit at all.
3.0,"Not 95% cotton - it is 65% cotton and 35% polyester.  I would never have ordered it if I had known this, since the description said 95% cotton. If you are looking for all cotton, stay away.  However, it is comfortable and fits nicely and looks good on, so I am keeping it."
3.0,Not the right color white. The white has a lilac undertone.
3.0,"Way too flimsy, feels very cheap. Also I ordered a small because I thought they would be okay for women, but they were too large."
3.0,I ordered an extra large and it was about a small in size. Pretty but wayyyyyyy to small
3.0,The shirt is way too small.
3.0,These may but cute on someone else but they did not look good on me. The lenses are also very transparent. The point of mirrored lenses is so that no one can see your eyes but these might as well be reading glasses.
3.0,"Material is thin, but it still looks nice."
3.0,"There were no reviews when I bought this so I guessed on size and it ran a little big. I bought a large. Maybe a medium would’ve fit better. The material is thick/quality and stretchy. The neckline is higher than the model picture. Im 5’5,163lb and it came to a few inches above my knees. Just wasn’t the fun flirty dress I was hoping for. Maybe good for someone else for work or church though."
3.0,Colors are bright. The material on the bottom is very stiff . This dress is very short!
3.0,Sent me wrong size.  Looks good and feels nice.  Had to return.
3.0,Fit as described but super scratchy for me. Maybe I’m spoiled. Shipping took a while. But mainly the 3 stars because of the material. Even after washing it is just super scratchy to me. It is cute though.
3.0,the product had a strong smell formaldehyde and the fabric seemed to be thin.
3.0,Thank goodness it was cheap because the quality is mediocre at best.  It's currently sitting in a drawer where it'll probably remain.
3.0,Not for kids AT ALL!!! TOO BIG
3.0,"Liked the style and the look of the bracelet...but up close, the black bead is made to look cheap by the  aluminum (?) metal and the way it is cut.  Liked everything about it except that and that's a big THAT!"
3.0,Tried the jacket on and looked like Chris Farley in Tommy Boy. The back was way to small to be a 3x and the sleeves as well. The sizing chart is about 1.5 sizes to small.
3.0,Nice but are too big around the waist and are not adjustable
3.0,Order one size larger than you normally wear or you’ll find the fit to be strangelling.
3.0,I got this in mint and it was pretty in person. However it’s big for my face and heavy too. Hence will be returning.
3.0,Won’t stay up. The girls kept popping out the top
3.0,"I am 6ft 2in tall with a 29 inch waist and broad shoulders...in order to get the sleeves long enough I had to order a large and it swallowed my torso. Great sweater, just a little more loose fitting than I was expecting"
3.0,"The dress is very comfortable. It fits as expected, but the slits come up way too high. I had to wear shorts under because I felt my thighs were too exposed."
3.0,"Love it so much so cute!!!<br />But on the 2nd day, it was broken the ball was rolled on the floor. Very sad."
3.0,color was not as dark as pictured
3.0,"The dress is pretty, it would be better if it was lined."
3.0,It fits a bit snug. I wear a 14-16.
3.0,"As others have mentioned in their reviews, this shirt may not be the most flattering for those with a larger chest. I'm a 36DD and I found this looked better with a sports bra than any other kind. The neck opening though still falls a little odd on me and I'm not sure what I can do about that other than wear a silk scarf with it.<br />I have the burgundy and I really love the color, it's as pictured. The cut of the sleeve is nice, and the arms definitely look better rolled up and tied then they do loose, as then you have the flaps with the metal rings hanging free and it looks a little strange.<br />The material is light and surprisingly comfortable. I thought it was a little scratchy when I touched it at first but actually when you're wearing it it doesn't feel that way at all. It would be a great work shirt for Spring and Fall when the weather isn't too cold."
3.0,"It’s very cute, but I had to give it to my daughter, because it’s definitely not true to size. I ordered a large so I could have more room in it and it was still too snug on me."
3.0,Ran big for my daughter.  Quality of material not that great but for price you will get 2-3 wears out of it.
3.0,"Fits great, bit quality is on the low side"
3.0,"Not as well made as I thought it would be, rather crude looking"
3.0,Purse too heavy.
3.0,"The umbrella was good until I noticed a big glob of glue on the handle that was very noticeable. Other than that, shipping was great."
3.0,Just received this dress on time but it's actually a little to small for me. I ordered another dress just like it from another company an the same size an that one fits..its still a beautiful dress so instead of returning it I just gave it to my mom who is smaller than me.
3.0,Just a bit more snug than I like. Also the waistband rolls down alot.
3.0,I like it but the strap is too large
3.0,Need 29 length but they don’t seem to have it
3.0,They seem a little loose they don't fit snug to the face and they're very thin but they are very comfortable
3.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; & 118 lbs. I ordered a medium. The top is kind of tight. The zipper pull part broke and it is hard get the zipper up. But overall, it's an ok dress."
3.0,"Seemed a bit flimsy, but for smaller, lighter things, perfect."
3.0,"Very cute! It is smaller than I thought it would be, almost as if its for a child. For it being smaller than a typical headband, it is flexible enough to wear on an adult head and doesn't feel tight."
3.0,Fit a little tighter than we anticipated.
3.0,"Unfortunately, this was kind of cheap looking."
3.0,Excellent at blue light reduction and aids in seeing further at night as claimed.  My only complaint is the ear pieces are too snug for my head.  I wear XL fit over sunglasses in another brand.  I think these are equivalent to a Large.  The earpieces do not have flex springs so it is just tight and becomes uncomfortable over time.
3.0,"Not really a fan of Windbreaker jackets, but this makes all the right moves in most of the right places. With that said it still is a windbreaker at it's core. I like it, and it suits me fine, just not a fan of the sleeves and the zipped up look."
3.0,"You get what you pay for...<br />Really nice design, not such great quality but i should have not expected"
3.0,Didn’t fit how I expected and not as cute as the picture looks.
3.0,This is a great strap that is almost perfect but it’s a miss unfortunately if you have a mans wrist. I was excited to get this because of the concept of being able to swap for the fat pins seiko’s. I have a decent size wrist. Unfortunately they made this too small. It’s much shorter than any of the standard seiko silicone or rubber straps. so while it does work there’s barely any room left on the tag end. Not even enough to get to the second keeper for me. They should either make a longer version or include a second strap of a different length. I’d be happy to pay more money to have it longer option. Because the strap is so perfect otherwise it’s really a shame that’s the one issue keeping it back from five stars and being my primary day-to-day strap.<br />It definitely works it’s super secure and it fits awesome on the wrist. it just really needs to be an inch longer. My second picture shows it next to a seiko factory strap
3.0,Decent for the price paid however no air hole for your mouth...so make sure you brush your teeth twice. ;)
3.0,"Wonderful product that saves us SO much mess with a special needs kiddo. I got one with a bad zipper - return process was easy, but my only complaint is that “XL” size is no longer available.please let me k ow where I can get a few more."
3.0,I like the fact that it came with so many options but they are very boring when it comes to jewelry
3.0,To go with a lot of tops . Very pretty  will be good with casual and dresses
3.0,I am 5 feet and 130 pounds. I ordered a small. It fits well on top. The skirt is too long however. Though I can easily fold it up to make it the length I want. It looks exactly as pictured. Only issues i have is that the material is very scratchy. Will most likely get some kind of skin burn when I wear it.
3.0,I really love this outfit but was extremely sad when I opened up the buttons at the top of the onesie and the button came clear off. I’ll have to try and super glue it I guess but we were on our way to church and had to redress! I suppose you get what you pay for. It’s a super cute outfit though!
3.0,Quality seemed a little iffy.  Some loose threads hanging out of one of the seams.  Wife didn't get to try it as it was MUCH smaller than the photo suggests.
3.0,"Good fitment for a month or two, after that, the memory foam thins and they begin to fit looser.  About the normal for these types of house shoes."
3.0,band to tight
3.0,Inseam ripped after wearing the dress once. I’m going to try to repair the dress.
3.0,"well priced for quality, that being said, the quality is bootycheeks, two weeks into wearing one pair and one of the die broke, be careful"
3.0,I love the dress the reason for the three stars is because the main pictures show a low v drop and it is not at all. That dress pictured is not the dress they send you. I knew this going into it because I looked at the reviews but I just wanted to make fully clear as they are false advertising by putting up a picture of a dress they're not selling.<br /><br />Also remember the zipper on the side lol it's hidden well which is great for the look but you might need to unzip and zip for it to fit the best.
3.0,"It's well constructed but after months of use it's not holding up like I hoped. The smooth, structured surface is developing lines and folds so that it no longer looks like it used to. My purse has very little in it and is well treated yet this has happened anyway. I do receive compliments on it though."
3.0,To hard to get on. The size is written wrong on the box.
3.0,The pants had a compression fit but the shirt was loose.
3.0,"The material of the dress is silk & stretchy. I normally wear a XL but i ordered large based on the material & it fits kinda big. The breast part is what got me because it's more wide open not closed like displayed & i wear a 42C. The dress is definitely long, Im 5'11 and it covers my feet lol. Overall i like the dress..."
3.0,"I have large thighs.  I lift weights and run 6 miles three days a week.  I need good inner leg protection from chafing.  I think the material feels really nice and I like wearing them as casual wear.  Unfortunately, where I really need these is in the gym and the legs don't really hold well... they want to roll up in to the crotch."
3.0,"This is such a soft, comfortable fabric and the garment is very well constructed. The drain management layout is perfect and I love everything about the shirt except it is not the size you'd expect. People undergoing mastectomy need roomy, non-clinging garments. Sadly, this doesn't describe what I received - and I ordered up from my usual size.<br /><br />My choices at this point are either return the shirt and do without (not practical - surgery is Tues) or try to modify the garment myself, likely with bad results.<br /><br />I was hoping not to complicate my preparations. Likely returning it."
3.0,It was strangely tight on the chest ( I don't have a big chest either) and very loose everywhere else (as expected). The shoulder straps are too short too. This would work great on a girl with little to no chest. I'm a 36B ( big ribs) and did not look good!
3.0,"Nice shirt but super long. I'm 5'9&#34; and ordered the large, it still looked like a dress on me"
3.0,"This pendant isn't real high quality, which I didn't expect for the price but it does look quite cheap. Overall not too bad though. You get what you pay for."
3.0,Very pretty but to stiff no movements.
3.0,"I was ordering sandals because I have neuropathy and can’t wear flip flops anymore. I thought this would be the perfect solution but the shoes on the inside top were very hard leather and hurt my feet. Good looking shoes, width was OK and fast delivery."
3.0,"starting to make noise, only after a short time using, will advise if gets louder.."
3.0,they snapped fairly easy after about a month of use
3.0,Fits to size but too long and material very dull and not as per picture
3.0,"Very pretty, but clearly made for a larger breast than A-cup.  I would speculate this would fit 38B wonderfully."
3.0,Not crazy about fabric. Like 100% cotton better
3.0,The earrings are on the lever back backwards!!<br />They are very pretty otherwise.
3.0,Fast shipping. Tried on product. Top fits great but bottoms are too small. Hoping to be able to exchange bottoms only.
3.0,"The gold in these looks cheap. They’re sturdy and seem to hold up well after multiple wears, but not super quality. You get what you pay for."
3.0,"Size is for a toddler, there is no way these would fit a 12 year old. They are way too small."
3.0,Cute shirt but almost see thru. Also need to buy size up
3.0,They are pretty tight which I expected. But they are super snug on my three year old's head. And she has a normal size nugget. Three stars because one of the ear muffs pops off somewhat regularly and you have to wrestle with it to pop it back into place.
3.0,order a size up....thin material overall sexy though
3.0,Getting it on was hard.  I bought large to x-large.  Maybe I need  2XL
3.0,The material that the dress is made of is more stiff and rough than expected. Almost reminds me of burlap. There is also 0 flexibility with the sleeves so when you raise your arms the dress rides up with them.
3.0,"Well made, but smaller that same size Inreceivd from a different vendor."
3.0,Was too see through in back in upper body
3.0,Sleeves too large
3.0,Very pretty but too small. Trying to see if I can lose weight and fit in it. I’m 5’6 and 180 lb .
3.0,I love the shirt but my side panels were crooked. I still wear it but I notice it and it drives me crazy.
3.0,the structure of it internally is a bit awkward. the part that covers the face is too loose so gets bunched up at the back but nothing that ant be fixed with a bit of elastic
3.0,Get a size bigger they dont strech that much
3.0,I give this belt a 3 stars because the color  of the buckle changed and I can't wear it anymore.
3.0,Sizes are too small and the tag is irritating.<br />I cut off the tag<br />Except for that it is a great product
3.0,"The bag was good quality and as advertised for the most part, but, it didn’t say bride and only had the anchor. I was a little disappointed but didn’t have time to return it before my best friend’s wedding."
3.0,"Rather small, for a teen or child. Not great for an adult. Nice-ish build but not worth sending back, will give them away as they don't fit."
3.0,shirt is great but runs very very small. I also have a long torso and it's very short. inhale to layer it .
3.0,The mask is soft around the edges and you can clearly se your mouth through the plastic but you have to use dawn or something for the plastic not to fog up. It also get hot and the plastic get wet if you talk a lot.
3.0,"Is not as colorful as it looks in the picture. Is not ugly, but not great. I ordered a size up because of the reviews but its a little bit larger than expected."
3.0,It’s cute. Just don’t like that a wrinkles easily.
3.0,Super small. I got youth large and it’s rather small
3.0,"The material is soft. However, the color is an ugly royal blue- nothing like the light blue shown in the actual picture. Also, I usually wear a large, but I got a medium since the material seemed so stretchy. Yet even the medium is a tad big and doesn't provide much support. So, order a size down, and don't get too attached to whatever color you choose because there's a chance you'll get something totally different."
3.0,"Great quality and color but this is a very cropped top. The model shows a barely crop sweater ainthought would pair nicely qith higher waisted jeans for a put together look, but this is EXTREMELY short.  I'm talking, lift my arms up and you see my bra, short.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure where I'll personally be able to wear this - but if you're looking for something skimpier, the material is thick and comfy."
3.0,Wild!
3.0,"Great shirt if you're into the anime. I've rode it a few times, its just ok. Fits good but the single stitching makes me worry about longevity. Better shirts for cycling are available for cheaper but this is ok to add to the collection especially if you liked Yowamushi Pedal."
3.0,"Came with a nice case which I appreciate, but it also came with a huge scratch which I do not."
3.0,Somewhat cumbersome but serves the purpose to deflect identity theft.
3.0,"Fit well, cute at first glance. Don't look too hard though. Seams don't line up. Stripes aren't quite level."
3.0,"Bought an XL, but it was very narrow through the legs"
3.0,"So I really liked the idea of this.  The item arrived and looked to be a quality item. However I believe the sizing is off by at least 2 sizes. I was able to put on the item no problem but the arms were tight. Sadly, I had to return this item.  As a note this is thin material, which I expected, and I really wanted to be able to keep it but it was just too small."
3.0,"Like everyone says, it is very thin. I am 5'2"" and have very wide hips. They stretch to fit, but I need a very long shirt as it is are see through. Get a size or 2 larger than you think if you are hippy. It also has a neon yellow in it that isn't clear from the pattern. Not my favorite."
3.0,"I like the tutu,and the set as a whole, but I did not think it would be so thin. thats my only issue."
3.0,"Thin fabric, standard for a coverup. Very small; recommend ordering two sizes up to ensure wrap is comfortable. Straps seem flimsy; we’ll see how it holds up!"
3.0,&#34;Honeycomb top non-elastic gentle grip&#34; still too tight for older persons that experience problems with swelling : l  Beside the fact that product shipped was size 6-11 instead of size 13-14 as listed : (
3.0,Cute. It runs small compared to other shirts from them
3.0,Missing belt to one of the dresses.
3.0,Just a bit small for an XL guy.
3.0,This does not hold 100 pencils – it does not have enough elastics to hold all 100 and my expensive colored pencils are too important to me to have them rolling around on the bottom of this case so I returned it
3.0,Some countries really don't have a firm concept of larger sizes.
3.0,This is a nice looking band and seems to be well made. The reason I gave it a 3 star is there is no instruction on how to install it to the witch. The clasp mechanism is a little complicated  and is frustrating trying to determine how to use it without instructions!
3.0,It is pretty however when I received the package two of the stones fell off.
3.0,"I had to return this. I liked the feel of it and the colors, but it was too big."
3.0,Poor stitching
3.0,They were better than I thought they would be. Had some problems putting some on they bent when putting them in were worried they would break. Ran small more for a child than an adult.
3.0,I like the overall design of this watch. It was easy to figure out even without instructions. My only gripe is that the numbers are difficult to see in bright daylight. Had ths watch for a while now and it keeps great time. So far it's been a great watch
3.0,Solo 4 actividades y no tiene para activar tu música 🎶 lo único bonito es la aparición de la foto... 😏😏😏
3.0,The color was a little brighter than I was expecting. Other than that. Its a shirt.
3.0,Decent weight to the fabric. Faux leather belt definitely feels cheap. Hood is missing the pom and nose - looks more like a teddy bear than a moogle.
3.0,I can't figure out the straps. I should return it.
3.0,"This cloak will do the trick if you need a colored cloak.<br /><br />It's fairly basic and straight forward,<br /> I just wish it at least has some sort of realistic closure (whether a string tie or a button near the neckline)<br />so you don't have to worry about it falling off, it's essentially relying on using your shoulders and the friction of the material to keep it in place, which just doesn't seem realistic if you're at an event or a party.<br /><br />It is a good length and the velvety material is nice,<br />but functionally throughout a night of wear~<br /> I just forsee it kind of being a hassle.<br /><br /> I will likely just end up adding my own button embellishments to make it more functional ...<br />but it is kinda just something I expected most capes to have... (at least a tie)."
3.0,"This is really cute, but does not fit true to size. It is ok, but usually this size is a bit looser on me. The padding in the bra is a bit strange too, it is not the same size as the cup, but after moving it around it was ok, but weird that they would not make it the same size as the bra cup. I don't typically wear bathing suits, but bought this for a vacation. I will probably end up wearing a tshirt over it most of the time anyway, so I am not too worried, but for someone that wants a looser fit as indicated in the photo, I would go up a size."
3.0,I didn’t like the feel or look of the dress on me- it looked great on others
3.0,Fell out in less than 2 weeks because the gap is too big. Good size though
3.0,"I love the way this makes my arm and skin look. The color (cool) is flattering for my pale, pinkish skin and it makes your arm look long and elegant. Saddly, I must tell you I can't wear it that often. It seems that the tiny beads I like so much slowly pull arm hairs out durring wear. Not bad at first, but if you wear it all day or durring activity, it will drive you nuts! I only wear it to go out...in addition to the shoes and clothes we wear, women are used to that kind of ""short-term torture"". :P"
3.0,Did not fit very well
3.0,"While fabric is nice, they are very oversized."
3.0,Its cute but I only had it for a few days and its already falling apart....
3.0,"i liked it, but the colors inside the groves peel out easily somehow... only the red purple and blue are left on mine. ill prbally just put some paint back in there so its not a big deal."
3.0,a yoga sock nothing more or less!!!!!
3.0,I purchased these in a large for my son. They run small. I definitely needed an XL. Quality and everything else is good.
3.0,Unfortunately these shoes fit like a whole size small. Definitely size up!
3.0,not worth the price  too small but pretty
3.0,"Design is nice, wasn't a huge fan of the fabric."
3.0,This bra is adorable and my only negative remark is it fits a little big.
3.0,The fit was very small as compared to my usual size. I even purchased an extra size larger and it was still way too small.
3.0,Tshirts were cute but fabric was not up to my expectations.  Shirts were used for Christmas gifts.
3.0,The leather seems very thin.  I don't know how well it will hold up.  The buckle is plastic.
3.0,Ordered a medium so they don’t hug too tightly but should have went with six small like i usually Do
3.0,"These look cool, but they are really too nubby to be comfortable."
3.0,"Runs big, and even for a tunic it's very long. Almost to my knees at 5'4""."
3.0,"The shoes are cute in person, but their very narrow. I should have gotten a size 9 instead of 8 when I bought them--don't get me wrong, they fit but they're a bit snug on the side of my feet."
3.0,"Bought these for my daughter, they fit great and she was happy!"
3.0,"I ordered 2 of these. One Large, and one XL incase it ran small. I'm 5'10, 155. The XL had prime shipping and arrived in 2 days. It looked great and fit pretty well, maybe just a tiny bit big. The biggest problem was that the bottom half of the suit was white instead of light blue. The size Large suit arrived about 2 weeks after I ordered it, I was looking forward to see if it fit slightly better than the XL and if it had a light blue bottom. It did have a light blue bottom but it fit like an XS! I could barely get it past my thighs. I'm pretty sure it came from China, and while it did have a &#34;Large&#34; label on the packaging, there weren't any tags on the suit. So i seriously wonder if they just threw a suit in there and hoped it was a large. Both suits seem like good quality. I will keep the XL, I love how it looks despite the color not being as advertised. I think ordering one is a bit of a gamble but you can always return it."
3.0,Bit too small than I expected
3.0,"I went with a double XL. Probably a size or two too big for my short stature. But I was going with the size chart. It does seem stretchable and probably could’ve gotten away with a much smaller size. Maybe a medium or large. I’m more “bottom heavy” so I may just return it and go with a more smaller size or two down from what I ordered. Material is soft. Length is pretty long on me as I’m on the shorter side, almost floor length, but the length of the sleeves were nice. Nice classy look with the slit and gold buttons on the side."
3.0,I love the pendant however it had glue on the outside of it and what appeared to be a crack. I haven't had it for a week and water already got into the globe and ruined the dandelion seeds.
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter (who is in middle school); she plays various sports and was asking for a gym bag to carry her stuff. I think it's more than adequate for her needs, but her feedback? &#34;Myeh.&#34;  She thinks it's &#34;too thin...won't hold up.&#34; I don't think she's going to use it long enough for me to comment on it's durability :(  Sorry!!<br />I didn't want to spend too much for a bag, and I had read a zillion reviews and thought this was a good compromise (value, form and function). Well? It's looking like I'm going to have to bite the bullet and pay more for a second bag after all...one of the name brands."
3.0,They are gorgeous and high quality but when they are all the way tightened the gems are not pointing the same direction. Very dissapointing.
3.0,"Uso talla S, me quedaron grandes, no se si fue error en  estos, mido 5.5/ 115 lbs"
3.0,Everything was fine with this hoodie except the cuffs of the sleeves.  They were huge.  I had to sew and cut out over two inches on each cuff.  A great fit and look otherwise.
3.0,Very cute but turns color after a few times wearing it.
3.0,not waterproof.
3.0,I am 6' 160 lbs and the large was enormous
3.0,"Inexpensive, cute"
3.0,"I normally wear a 10 but this is way too big, I would say by 2 sizes"
3.0,"Runs small like a kids sizing. Not sure if I missed that in the description, if so my bad probably fits as expected. I am 5'11"", 200lbs athletic body type, no gut, bigger chest, and broad shoulders so it didn't fit well at all. Colors are nice and bright though"
3.0,Great hat but is massive. Not the kind of hat to where everywhere but only if you're by the pool or somewhere else in the sun. A little too Kentucky Derby sized for the average person and because of that it catches the wind if you're walking with it. But I do like it.
3.0,This necklace is slightly bigger than it appears in the picture.  I have yet to find an outfit to wear it with.
3.0,The tummy band is thin and rolls down.  Otherwise the fit to the legs are okay.
3.0,Cute sunglasses  but a little too small for my face.
3.0,Have some issues with it stopping for no reason and the band has a tendency to come apart. Some condensation build up inside at times too.
3.0,"The arms were too long.  Otherwise the fit was fine.  However I didn’t read the whole description and found out it’s knit material.  It is not sweater material as I wanted.  It’s ok, but the material seems cheap."
3.0,THEY ARE OKAY BUT TOO THIN. FITS PRETTY GOOD. PRICE WAS REASONABLE FOR PRODUCT. THEY ARE COOL SO MAY WORK BETTER FOR THE HEAT OF SUMMER THAN SPRING WEATHER.
3.0,it just didnt fit right.. lace on neck was too far up.. anyway gave it away as a gift.. beautiful shirt
3.0,No matter how large I get it. My boobs seem to creep out  The sides. Not good for busty women. I do recommend if you are smaller then a 38D. Great quality
3.0,The tail started to disconnect within the first hour my daughter wore it.
3.0,"Nice hat. Got it wet and now, it looks weird. Will not buy again."
3.0,Nice but i guess my belly button hole is big lol the gauge is skinny
3.0,I do not think they are true to size...
3.0,These slip off too easily
3.0,very easily fall out of ears!!!
3.0,It fit kind of tight on me
3.0,like well enough but doesn't fit as expected. a little tight and gets caught on pants
3.0,The waist is cut a little too low.
3.0,"I love the color and feel of the fabric, but it was way too small.  I ordered the XL, it fit my son perfectly and he wears a men's small."
3.0,"This is a beautiful inexpensive watch.  Its comfortable to wear. Keeps accurate time.  2 problems that keep me from giving it 5 stars. 1, the date feature keeps getting stuck on the 31st.(have to keep rolling the crown 3-5times before it jumps to the 1st). 2, with the chronograph function works sporadically, which I bought the watch for show not function"
3.0,Product was advertised as fitting as expected but ran small
3.0,Wood is very fake in appearance but you can't beat this price vs real wood sunglasses. Fairly good sunblocking in lenses.
3.0,"I’m sort of the middle of all these reviews, hence the 3 stars.  This shirt is absolutely NOT what is in the picture, which at this point on Amazon, which has basically just become Chinazon, you should not really be surprised about.  I mean.. have you ever heard of an American women’s apparel company called Fantastic Zone?  And the Caucasian models no face and clearly cut and pasted images from a more reputable line? So. Be realistic here. It is not heathered. It is a straight solid color. I got the green color. It is like one of those greens that can’t be replicated in nature or even a crayon. But it’s green of some kind.  It is ok to that end.  I got a M and It is a bit baggy, and bigger than I needed it to be. But it’s “ok”. I wore today to a lunch. I didn’t feel it was super flattering bc of its bagginess. But it was comfortable and the tie knot is cute. But you can achieve something very similar w your own tunics.  The sleeves are long but everything is long on me.  It I don’t know... not really sure what to do w it. I want to say I’ll wear it more... maybe? Maybe not? Return for smaller size? Not sure. But it’s definjtely okay. I just would expect it to be on the bigger side. The M I got is definjtely more like a large."
3.0,"Shinier material, and didn't fit well (waist vs butt ratio)"
3.0,I have this in the A-Multicolor in Large.  This looks cheaper in person.  It is very obviously a synthetic and you can see the reverse side of the weave.  The price point seems high for the look.  I think this would also be a lot cuter with regular buttons instead of the elongated ones.  No pockets. This is OK for a sweater around the house. It fits as show on the model.
3.0,The Bar was very thick it didn’t fit my top right ear cartilage
3.0,Have to say i was very disappointed the boots shown in the cover picture were not included. Guess i should have read the description but i was so in love with the pattern i didn’t bother.
3.0,gloves are ok for warmth and i like the distinctive look.  I will say that the touchscreen capability peaked on day 1.  When these wear out I will look for a different pair--or i will invest in a spool of conductive thread and modify a pair of regular gloves!
3.0,Nice size not too big!
3.0,"I thought this backpack would charge your devices , not have only a cord inside. Small bag. My misunderstanding when I read it."
3.0,"This was very beautiful and made my hair look nice even on those bad hair days. I gave it a three because after a few days of use, it tarnished. :-("
3.0,"The gloves are nicely made and priced right for being artificial (PU polyurethane) leather.  I only down-rate them because of false advertising.  I'm usually better with the fine-print, but in any case I hate being misled."
3.0,"Like the style<br />Shorter than expected, could not tie it like the photo. Snug on arms"
3.0,"Nice swimsuit, good material just a little too large for me."
3.0,"Tall girls beware, it’s really short waisted. It seems nice otherwise, the skirt part is long and the details are cute."
3.0,this shirt is supposed to have some stretch...it has zero
3.0,ordered a medium alway medium but this was super large.
3.0,It's nice for the price only wish the neck came down farther and it wasn't as tight seems more of a youth size than grown man
3.0,Very cumbersome to put on. Sent it back for refund.
3.0,"Color was more of a lavender, not what was pictured. Fits true to size & still cute, but disappointed in the color."
3.0,"binding, somewhat small"
3.0,"Love these. Super cute, and fits true to size."
3.0,I bought this for my mom who is very tiny. I bought the smallest size but it was very large. I tried it on and it was even large for me and I wear a large and this was a small. I had to return it and try something else. She liked the print though.
3.0,Product seems ok. No complaints there. But the white version is see through on the man stuff.<br />Also if your man stuff is average or above. Room is very limited. If you know what I'm saying
3.0,Bottoms fit true to size. I wish the top was adjustable. Or could be ordered as separates. The top is to loose and has zero support. The fabric snags super easy and looks really worn after a day in the pool.
3.0,It was pretty large in the top. Luckily I was able to take it in so it will work and I’ll keep it. Just wish there was an xsmall cause it runs pretty big.
3.0,"All but one are round.The photo in the description does not represent the items I received. Had a known, I would not have ordered them since my jewelry does not lend itself to large round cabs. A couple are quite thick and not useful for jewelry and most are rather dull in color. Probably fairly good for the price, but all in all I felt a let down when I opened them."
3.0,Cute suit but I wish it came with waist high bottoms
3.0,There is no way these shorts are true to size. I am a big guy and orders an xxxxl and they are more like a xl. My 15 year old fit in them perfectly. Great quality but size is way off its mark
3.0,The back of the shirt is longer than the front.  Not something you’d see on a boy in my opinion.
3.0,I like the fact that these caps have buttons to hold a mask to the face but my caps don't stay in place on my head and the buttons are too high up for my masks to fit properly on my face.<br />The caps do keep my head warm though and they seem to be well made.
3.0,"I hoped this sounded more like a train but it unfortunately doesn’t even make a simple whistle sound unless you blow really hard into it. I have a wooden train whistle for my work with children and wish this had been a smaller version of that. Still a lovely whistle to have for emergencies or dramatic play, though!"
3.0,It's ok wish it fit more
3.0,Lights didn't last more than 6 months with bare minimum use. Outer plastic/fabric started peeling quickly.
3.0,"This runs SUPER tight and small, even by PattyBoutik standards (I've bought several items from them, and am usually a size larger than I am in other brands). The material is a very dense knit too, so I felt almost suffocated in it when I tried it on. It's pretty (love the purple) and I wish I could keep it (perhaps I'll try 2 sizes up?)"
3.0,I guess it was what was expected. The material feels nice.. but it’s really thin and just not altogether the best quality item..
3.0,"The flip flops run small so definitely a size up.<br />The ""massage soles"" feel a bit weird to be honest, I wouldn't buy ""massage"" shoes again.<br />The toe strap is made of fabric so it's less likely to hurt your feet but I still find it a bit rough. I don't think I'd be able to walk in these for an extended period of time.<br />The quality is fair for the price."
3.0,"I liked the idea of this product. However when wearing it for the first time the top and bottom rolled away from me, it did not stay up unless it was under the velcro. I used it to walk around the house and meal prep, so standing, stairs, and bending/squats/kneeling. I also.did a 20min workout in it and did seem to sweat in the concentrated area more. It fit as I expected, though the velcro hit my skin in one or 2 places so I wore it over a shirt."
3.0,I put three stars because the coat is very nice but the reviews were saying it comes too small as per the size chart so My wife took xlarge and it is ridiculous big
3.0,Cheaply made. It did it's job for a character roll.
3.0,"I was specifically looking for a pair with side pockets.  Unfortunately I was sent a pair without pockets.  The leggings did fit great and I ordered my usual size medium, but I ended up returning the leggings. :("
3.0,"Armholes were too big. Doesn't look as dressy as in the picture. Reminds me more of a muscle shirt. Not a flattering cut , More of a box cut. I think the model may have it clipped in the back to make it look like that :-)"
3.0,"Very pretty and attractive, but tiny. I was expecting something bigger. Maybe a photo with something next to it for scale like a coin."
3.0,"TOO SMALL - order a size up. I ordered an XL, am a size 12 and 34 DD bra. I always wear an XL and this is entirely too tight. Disappointed because it’s a really cute shirt."
3.0,la tela esta demasiado delgada.no es tela de traje de baño
3.0,"Great fit,  comfortable and perfect length. Blue tie dye color nothing like picture.  Very muted blue and front of my dress was mostly light gray with white and little bit of muted blue.  If color was accurate this dress would be 5 star rated.  I sized up. 147 lbs 5' 4"""
3.0,"ral color is lighter, not as dark as it seems"
3.0,"Cheap material, and a little small for my head (which is of average size.) With that being said, you get what you pay for and these made for a decent emergency pair of sunglasses in my car for driving, hiking, etc.. The lenses are okay, but sunlight still managed to get in my eyes at times, most likely due to the small fitting frames. If you just need a temporary pair of throwaways for short money, these will do, but invest in a quality pair of sunglasses for when they really matter and are in need."
3.0,"The photo shows a capped sleeve, which my shirt does not have. It hangs like a sack- not with a soft drape as the photo shows. The material, for me, is strange. Very thin (see-through) and not a material you would ever think of ironing."
3.0,"So sad this didn't fit because it is adorable. XL cups were too smal, but the bottoms look like they would have fit. (I'm a 36 DD, 5'7 and weigh 130). The suit looked very nice, no dents or awkward folds. It's definitely not for large chests, though."
3.0,"When i went to pull up the pants they ripped at the top where the elastic was suppose to be attached together, and when i put the jacket on, it did the same thing. Where ever they called so stitching the elastic pieces they all ripped apart. So since i like the suit and thank god i have a sewing machine i will sew it back together, smh!"
3.0,Love this except the lettering came off in the first wash. It’s still comfy and I will continue wearing it.
3.0,Parent hat was too small...
3.0,"the gold pieces on the purse were not very shiny and bright, kind of dull"
3.0,Did not feel like a sweatshirt it was comfy but not what I was expecting.
3.0,It's an ok shirt but it doesn't fit like in the pictures. The neck isn't large enough to wear off the shoulder.
3.0,"worked well, but then the heating pads stopped working.  The slippers themselves are good, and I just put disposable hand warmers in them and it works like a charm, great for keeping toes toasty"
3.0,"Very thin, cheap hems, but the fabric is soft and comfy. Good for lounging."
3.0,Ordered the black mittens and received the grey ones. More of a artificial wool type feel inside rather then normal fleece. Good for a couple hours in the cold but wouldn’t suggest for an all day ski trip
3.0,Only wore once so far. Seem food quality.
3.0,"I bought these earrings last minuet for valentines day, they arrived right when they were scheduled to be delivered. After opening the box and looking at them, I came to the conclusion they looked cheep. They were very inexpensive, so buyer be warned, you get what you pay for. If I hadn't planed on dropping 30 bucks on rush shipping I would have bought a quality pair. I'm just happy I had a gift for my girlfriend on valentines day. They sort of matched her moonstone and amethyst necklace, the purple was just off by a few shades. These earrings might be great for kids and teens, or maybe a friend your not to fond of. Other than the quality (which I expected was going to be kind of poor) they came packaged great, looked as advertised and arrived on time."
3.0,"I was glad to find this dress, I'd seen pic's of it here & there when scrolling Pinterest, but was only available at sketchy internet sites that I do not trust.  Some online sellers (Etsy) trying to sell this style for close to $100.00, no thank you.<br /><br />First thing-- sizing chart is not accurate, big surprise.  If providing a sizing chart, why provide one that is not accurate?  This is the eternal question.  Someday China will get clue-y.<br /><br />I purchased a size L which said would fit size 12-14 but the measurements provided on the sizing chart suggested would fit me, a size 10, w/36C chest size, this should've fit. I would expect the fabric for my size to be voluminous enough to cover me decently.<br /><br />However the item came in barely overlapping -- a wrap dress should overlap more than 4"", a stiff wind would reveal everything from the waist down when the dress blew open on a windy day.  Also, the problem w/wrap tops & dresses was also an issue with this dress, v-neck plunged waaaay low, would need a tank underneath unless going for the all-boobies look.  I notice one of the models in the pics of this item has a neckline that looks pinned in place.  I may have to do this w/this dress, if ordering another.  :0/<br /><br />Will need to size up at least one size, but I am thinking this will not be enough for the wrap to wrap around enough.  Going to have to go w/a 2XL, 2 sizes up from what I thought I should order.  Also, must allow for shrinkage.  I will wash this dress (if I purchase another) in the sink in cold water & hang dry.  Despite these efforts, this dress will likely shrink -- this has been my experience w/shrinkable fabrics.  Forget the washing machine/dryer, even a cold-water sink washing might shrink it a bit.<br /><br />The fabric this dress is made of may be correct, had a tag on the inner seam saying cotton/linen, felt like it could be that, not soft, but not stiff.  Was okay, wrinkled, so probably is accurate w/fabric content.  There are a lot of good fakes out there w/icky polyester faking being cotton-ish.  Polyester overheats a person, and makes for unpleasant smelling perspiration on people in general.  This is not surprising since since polyester is a plastic fabric, basically like wearing a plastic bag.<br /><br />This dress is fun w/the wide wrapping ties, the color is good for me, will likely try again to find one that fits, the large pockets are the last deciding factor, pockets trigger me to hit the Buy Now button.<br /><br />Overall, this dress seemed like decent quality & is a cute style, again w/large pockets.  I will update if/when I order & receive a size that fits.<br /><br />EDIT:  Re-ordered this 2 sizes bigger and it fit the way it is supposed to fit, not too plunging of a neckline, wraps securely and decently.  Fun dress, recommended but buy 2 sizes up!"
3.0,"Really,  really small opening for arms. My grandson's glasses are metal with thin plastic ends,  I was afraid I'd snap the arm off trying to attach the strap. It took a lot of patience to get it on. They are super cute though."
3.0,"The product is made by a cheap material and shipping length were way too long, almost like 2 months. Pattern was a good, but not confortable to wear. So I used once and never use it again."
3.0,Bought three dresses by this seller - all same size.  The other two fit but this was very much smaller. Quality of fabric/sewing is good: especially for such a small price.  Buy TWO sizes smaller than usual
3.0,falls down
3.0,Too tight. Very uncomfortable.
3.0,A piece of thread is unravelling other than that it looks like the picture.
3.0,This item was not at all what I expected from the description. I purposely ordered a size larger than I needed but could barely wear it over regular clothes. The lining shed pieces of white material all over my clothes. The fastenings are very flimsy. I was not pleased at all with this purchase for the price. Also it took a long time for delivery.
3.0,"I enjoy the beads I received, but I never got the coil style. I was sent two different sizes of barrel beads instead."
3.0,The lock is to hard to open and close
3.0,"Fell apart in a few months... The metallic coloring cracked, the zipper broke, and all the credit card slots ripped from normal use. Cute, but cheaply made. Feels like plastic."
3.0,"I can’t believe yoga pants can be this cheap! These are comfortable and feel snug in a good way. I am 5’4, 135 and purchased a medium. Theee stars because despite being an awesome value, there is something a tiny bit weird and tight about the top of the waistband and the overall appearance is not really matte."
3.0,"Received the garment defective. Left side ripped off,1/3 of left side WITHOUT seams. There is just a huge hole in that area.Absolutely Unacceptable and huge dissapointment. 1*..Waiting for seller respond. Will update .<br />UPDATE I increase rating upto 3*,because seller apologized and refund my money. They allow me to keep and repair the item if I want.Otherwise the shirt is interesting.<br />Material, color and design are  nice,just inconsistent quality."
3.0,The product is fine but I was sent a grey case instead of purple
3.0,Its a great fit and feel... until water splashed on the insole and I didn't wipe it off.  The insole folded up and now it feels uncomfortable.
3.0,"Flimsy, creaks, plastic everywhere instead of rubber in some areas. For the price its okay."
3.0,"This dress is really cute, but it runs very small.  I wear a 10-12 size dress and ordered this in large.  The top half is tight.  Returning."
3.0,"Fit tight on the bust the button was coming apart, also material not very breathable and wrinkles easily. See through as well, if you iron it though it looks fairly nice."
3.0,"The crown is thick, cheap plastic.  It does light up but the lights are white, twirling (chasing) lights so when it lights up, you cannot see the number 30.  Its cute but not suitable for adults."
3.0,"This keychain is decent for the price. I bought it to carry my ID and my everyday keys. Within the first day of receiving it, the little nail clipper/bottle opener attachment fell off. Fortunately, I didn’t really purchase it for the nail clipper. So, I just threw it somewhere. Also, the idea of a nail clipper and bottle opener together kind of grossed me out. The strap that the keychain comes with is definitely not leather (which I expected for the price). However, even for faux leather standards, the strap  doesn’t feel very sturdy. It feels like a cheap, plastic type of material with no real weight to it. Overall, just kind of mediocre all around but, gets the job done."
3.0,It looks best in the illustration.
3.0,wasnt the best but still cute and trendy
3.0,"just ok, kind of cheaply made for the pice"
3.0,This thing is HUGE and is clearly labelled for Men.  Sending back.  I do like the design.
3.0,Way too large but decent quality
3.0,Pretty but very tiny.  Like a nose ring size !!
3.0,"I will be giving this to a friend as soon as I find one that might want it. I am a women and have a fairly small face, but not exceptionally small. This is too big and slides down just walking around the house. The Velcro does adjust tight enough, but it still slides down. I purchased the full face mask at the same time to compare the two and I love it. I ordered more full face masks."
3.0,I love the ring.  It’s great.  It came to me already with some of its color missing.  The ring isn’t fully blue I’m the designs.  Otherwise it feel alright and isn’t too bad.
3.0,A little large for posts. Thought they would be similar in size to regular pearls.
3.0,The color was not even close to orange. More like salmon.
3.0,"Material clings to everything you do NOT want it to cling to! The color is nice. The neckline basically says, &#34;hello boobies&#34;......."
3.0,"Pretty good and comfortable Flip Flops. I was a little disappointed with the width though. Usually I can wear M width shoes without any worries. In this case the strap of the sandal went under the inside of both of my feet causing minor discomfort after a few hours of wear.<br /><br />The bottle opener on the bottom is a nice touch. I'm on my 2nd pair this year now. I have to add that the adhesive holding the sole onto the leather is weak and will begin to separate with moderate wet/dry usage. They need to make an improvement on this. Still, the sandals are very comfortable."
3.0,They were okay I hate the pink on the bottom. It is VERY bright and it took forever to recieve.
3.0,Material is a little thin and stretchy. They don't stay in place well as you move through your day. Not impressed.
3.0,The package came on time the product looks nice a little tight around my wrist so and be nice if I'd be able to adjust the band.
3.0,I realize you can't expect much for the price you're paying but this is really cheaply made<br /> What should've been a glass cover feels and behaves like plastic<br /> The watch itself is very flimsy and I'm very disappointed.<br /> I bought this is a gift for a grandson<br />It wouldn't last five minutes
3.0,"I must have received one that someone returned. The jacket looked alright but was creased so much. I have to iron it, which is nuisance."
3.0,This product is for my 6 year old .. it’s a little to small for her. And it’s very cheap.
3.0,I went up one size and it is still too tight.
3.0,Seems rather cheaply made but I haven't washed it yet.  Runs a bit small but still very cute.
3.0,"The material is great, but these are NOT hipsters, they are a high rise! I am very disappointed, came up well over the small of my back."
3.0,"It fits like something your mom bought you in middle school when your boobs started growing and everything felt wrong. When you lift your arms up, it sticks above your bust. The fabric is thick, but feels cheap. The dress has pockets, which is always a plus. It is something quick to throw on to go out, but I wouldn't wear it somewhere nice. I would constantly be fighting the garment."
3.0,Nice material just runs too small
3.0,"They aren't the grey color as shown, more of a greenish grey. Not the prettiest color. The fit is as expected but the color sucks."
3.0,Got these for my pregnant sister. She said a hair tie is better bc it doesn’t bulge.
3.0,The colors on the stripe strap are exactly as expected. My only complaint would be the hooks. They don't look very sturdy.  As they say you get what you pay for.
3.0,"The sweater that I ordered at size XXL was too small in the arms and chest. The Fair Isle pattern was well done, but I decided to give the sweater away, as I could not use it. I usually wear a size XXL, so I was a bit surprised at the fit."
3.0,Dislike to small
3.0,Dress came with no tags and was not as long as expected and I got an extra long.<br />Great color not see through.
3.0,Too BIG on top. So big that my bra (strapless) AND most of my breast is clearly visible to anyone near me. Contacted owner but the two options to return were too tedious for me. I'll have to find a seamstress to be able to wear it.
3.0,"Cute but poor quality, two broke when I put them on."
3.0,Too big and straps on the back are too small to tie a bow also the front lace is too low you can see most of her chest..my daughter is 6 years old and weights 38lbs I ordered her a size 6-7..outfit is too adorable but wish could of fit her perfect
3.0,"I love this color. It's a very pretty burgundy red. The dress fits perfectly as a small except in the chest area. I'm a 34 DDD, and even with a simple lace bra or no bra this crushed my chest. The size medium fits much better in the chest but is a little bigger on, which most people would not notice."
3.0,"Appears a bit cheap, but, it was!"
3.0,Really cute but some of them would never latch closed.
3.0,It looks exactly like the picture and it is well made. The only downside for me is that the arm holes were a bit too snug for me. Everywhere else fits as expected. It'll be a great work outfit and everyday dress but I don't think I'll order another.
3.0,Runs small. I bought my you usual size large need to get xl for comfort
3.0,"The beanie cap is great! i love the golden triforce, the design is flawless. But its a bit tiny. Maybe its my head or the cap ... i dont know, the thing is that doesnt look good, makes my head look oversized."
3.0,Must not have measured myself right cause it was way too small. The material reminded me of swimsuits
3.0,Nice quality suit but ran bigger then expected
3.0,"Love the fabric and color. It was stretchy but I guess I should have gotten the xs since it was too big. Im 5'5, 130#, 34D. I am going to re order the smaller size and try again!"
3.0,"Regardless of my review, I love my slippers. Memory foam did not hold up, but they are cute and durable. I have had more expensive Memory Foam slippers that did not hold up in any way. Memory Foam failed within months, shoes didn't last a year."
3.0,"I wanted to love it but it didn't stay on my face.<br />PROS: Pretty. Soft. Lightweight.<br />CONS: Too large. A little smelly.<br /><br />My first one came dirty but I was offered a replacement and it was cleaner and came the very next day (thank you!) However, I returned both as I dont have a use for them. Maybe my head is just too small."
3.0,It does look cool.  It's cheap.  It doesn't keep time for Sh*t.  Pretty much have to reset the time every time I wear it.  But it looks cool.
3.0,"This is a fiasco, in fact does not adhere as the video shows, it sticks a bit, even more on the glass, but neither is it lasting a minute stuck."
3.0,It was a good fit but tarnishes easily
3.0,"Smaller than I had imagined, but I should have done the math before purchasing. Pretty none-the-less."
3.0,Don’t fit as I was hoping. Looks frumpy and if I went to a smaller size would be too tight.
3.0,"Tint changed colors quickly and frames were wobbly. Love the style, though."
3.0,"These were fine for the price.  The stones were much darker than I expected.  Also, one of the backs has a loose hinge, so the clasp opens up when I'm wearing them.  But I still enjoyed them."
3.0,"This handkerchief served it's purpose for my &#34;something blue&#34; and eye-dabber at my wedding, but I wasn't thrilled with the stiffness of it - seemed low quality."
3.0,I love these shorts. I have one pair that I ordered in 2018 that are blue and have held up great. All three black pair that I purchased in 2019 have developed tears in the back pocket that is visible on the outside.
3.0,I really like the color of it. But the 2 things which I don't like are its not dark enough to hide my prescription glass behind and not able to fold all the way up when not needed.
3.0,"The shoes took forever to get to me. They are cute and as pictured but run small size not accurate; however, when I tried to return the seller contacted me and said to keep them and they will send me a new pair at no extra cost which I thought it was nice. I have yet to receive the new pair and I jope that they will send me an accurate size and not the exact same thing. Will update."
3.0,"The material of these were ok and not really to thin. The band is very thin and made loose rather than a tighter elastic, and because of this these kept sliding down. There's nothing I hate about leggings worse than to get a pair and have to go around tugging them up all the time."
3.0,"The clasp on this does not stay closed, so the pin falls off oftwn."
3.0,Perfect for when you have to work. But dont sleep in it because one day I was too lazy to change it out and I fell asleep. Next morning I noticed it fell out and nose piercing healed :( sadness but that was all my fault
3.0,I bought this in navy size in large and it's a bit on the tight side...so I ordered the army green in XL and it's HUGE....defiantly at least 2 sizes larger between l and xl.  Disappointed :(
3.0,"I am keeping this top.  The pink is almost neon.  It fits somewhat small, but I compensated by ordering larger than my normal size."
3.0,broke within a few months. We usually order Kline & this does not match up to the rugged durability we need for work.
3.0,"It's all about preference..but if you want full length,  size up maybe twice!"
3.0,It’s comfortable and fits well but they sent me a light pink instead of the pink it shows
3.0,uncomfortable.
3.0,"Since one side of the band was so much shorter than the other, it was difficult to fasten it in a way that came close to centering on the underside of my wrist. Therefore, the front of the watch keeps sliding (or rotating) to one side (the left side of my wrist) rather than staying centered."
3.0,Ordered a medium. Got a large. Material feels weird and is very thin
3.0,"The shirt is very cute but the sizes are really bad. I ordered a bigger size because of the comments from other people and glad i did it just barely fit my daughter and she wears a small the shit size was an XL. There model must be barbie. The decal is an iron on, i wait to see how long it lasts."
3.0,I think in the hands of kids they wud not last long.
3.0,"These leggings will probably fit well on a taller person or if you have a long torso. They are extremely high waisted on me, they come up to my chest and roll down. If you have a flatter stomach they probably will be fine they have a lot of compression on the waist. Overall the leggings are just ok in my opinion."
3.0,"Did not like them, too stiff for my sensitive feet. I had to send them back.<br />I found them also too expensive for what they offer"
3.0,"They are super cute, but were larger than I expected and also super loose and high waisted. So maybe go a size down from your normal size if you like your clothes more fitted."
3.0,"These are okay, they fit length wise short.<br /><br />My main qualm is that these look cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for..."
3.0,It won’t stay in place when I used it..
3.0,Not as sturdy as I would like.
3.0,"This dress is pretty weird.  The buttons are sewn on and with my chest, they kind of poke out or hang in a weird angle.  The fabric is weird too, it's like wearing wrapping paper."
3.0,not for people with big heads They are super dark and are great for small kids in the middle of summer not for adult men with big heads too small
3.0,This was the only silver toned skull I could find.  I was disappointed to find that it is not a magnetic hold.  So it damages my clothes with not one but 2 holes.  Other than that it is exactly as pictured and good quality at an amazing price.
3.0,Fit was a little tight. But the chemise is sexy. My boyfriend will love it.
3.0,"I am not sure if I purchased the wrong side, I don't think so,  because the length of the sleeves and hem are similar to the image,  I am a size 4 with an average bust and purchased a size small.  The dress barely covers my chest area and when I bend over my breasts fall out complete,  Almost unusable without a sports bra or tank underneath."
3.0,LOVE the look of these shoes... but definitely needed to go up about half a size...
3.0,It was nice but for the price I thought it would be nicer. Nice gift for a child to enjoy.
3.0,The dress was too wide in the waist. It didn’t fit the way it was shown in the product image for this particular pattern. Had to return it for this reason. I ordered another pattern as well and that fit well.
3.0,Nice wish it had a little more color
3.0,These are soft and cozy.  They do run a bit small and they shrink when washed so buy one size up.
3.0,"Definitely need to be broken in, but I love them! This brand depends on how much u wear them. There made to showcase, not for a mile run"
3.0,"Needed a church dress, It came with pink dots like dye from the pink flowers on the white parts of the dress. I washed it, used oxi clean and awesome and it didn't help at all. You can barely see it but uplcose it's a dot on the shoulder, stomach, back etc. Inspect the product much?"
3.0,I like that these are really low profile it's almost as if there's nothing on your face... For the most part. I really dislike the plastic is as thin and weak as it is. As a result it tends to flex and distort as you change the orientation of your head or smile or anything else that changes the external surface your face and forehead.
3.0,"Great shorts except the front pockets are made for a child.  Couldn't get my hands in and they're about 3"" deep."
3.0,"Cute bennie like that it has a hole for a pony. Would give 5 stars, but I personally don't like the way it looks on me."
3.0,"The strappy pieces on the sleeves are unevenly spaced and not all the same size. It's a cute top & I like the fabric and the color (though it did shrink when I washed it), but it is poorly constructed once you look closely."
3.0,This was not an XL by any means.  A tighter fit than I expected.  The color too was not as vibrant as the picture but the material is good and if you are a small framed person will look very well.
3.0,"Came SUPER wrinkled. That would have been fine, except it's like 4 inches too small at the bust. You can see basically my entire bra. If I had gone up a size, it wouldn't have been tight enough at the waist.<br /><br />I got the &#34;light blue&#34; knee length one."
3.0,This dress was not made of the material I thought. I was expecting something that held shape instead of contouring to my body.
3.0,"I bought a size médium in the Pink color. Not even the small size would have fit me, it is incredibly largue and looks like a cami, I feel like if it would have been a red or Black color it wouldnt look so much like a pj. I took it to get it resized and I feel like with accesories and heels it can work"
3.0,too small but cute sending back
3.0,Not very nice an not thick enough
3.0,"Strange fit, cheap material. Comfortable, padded well enough for smaller busts. But definitely for extremely low impact wears."
3.0,It was really long. Longer than in the picture.
3.0,The dress itself is great. Although it game in with a lot of string already coming out and a whole in my pocket. I planned to wear this at a wedding this weekend but now I can’t wear a dress wear the shoulder sleeve is coming off.
3.0,I carry a large phone holster and I wanted to cover it up but it is right up against it  and bulges out.<br />I don't like the collar I like to where it up and it look funny.
3.0,My right pocket was stitched together. I had to cut the stitching which created a small hole. Cute shirt but a bummer that it was made kinda sloppy.
3.0,"The dress itself is beautiful and the coloring is simply stunning. While I did feel the XXL was small considering I have other Miusol dresses in the same size. The waist where the blue ribbon is located is not very forgiving (meaning stretchy) and the sleeves while they did stretch a little I felt more like Tommy Boy &#34;Fat Guy in a Little Coat&#34; where the shoulders and upper chest area being too tight to move the arms around and worrying you are going to rip it. Overall if you are of a thinner body frame this dress could be perfect. The quality is there for the price, the details in the lace are magnificent. I would definitely purchase if you are of a thinner body frame :-)"
3.0,"This piece is increadibly thin, not any where near the &#34;sweater&#34; description it had when i ordered it, that was very slyly changed a few days after i had already ordered it.<br /><br />Though i am disappointed in the material, it is decent quality for the price and i will keep it, but if you wanted it to keep you warm, it will do no such thing."
3.0,Finally got to open my package today after getting back from a trip and I am very impressed with the watch...nice weight with a clean simplistic design but then found that some of the wood pieces that are part of the links were not All there...appears the glue that was used didn’t quit hold the wood to the links...and to top it off if the wood pieces were still in the case I would have had no problem fixing the issue by gluing it all back together...disappointment guys...love the watch though just wish I got my money’s worth with a complete well made watch :(
3.0,Not for those with longer torsos or broad shoulders at all
3.0,The material felt nice but shrunk a lot the first time I washed and dried it.
3.0,"Nice shirt for the money. Fits a little large, the color is great."
3.0,"Shirt was made from soft material, however it does run a bit small & short. Otherwise, good quality."
3.0,really didn't fit.  med/large was really a med small.  Kinda cheap looking too.  Expensive to return.
3.0,It was way too large. I returned them back. But it was warm and comfy
3.0,Outfit fits well but not that cute
3.0,I’m 5’4 and around 170. I usually wear a medium but I read the reviews and looked at the material I got a size up and got a large. When I tried it on the top was perfect but the pants was tight around my thigh area. If you apart of the thick thigh crew you would probably need to go up 2 sizes.
3.0,Lasted one month and the battery died. I know it's a cheap watch but I thought it would last longer than a month.
3.0,Doesn't look as good as it does on the website.
3.0,"Their okay. I purchased these, and siren model M04. I spent less money, and substantially like M04 better. The arms feel like they bow out. If I had 2 tumors 1 on each temple, they would fit just right."
3.0,I bought these because I wanted compression shorts with a key pocket.  Most reviews say they fit good but for me I found them to be a little tight and to fit differently than any other compression shorts from other makers.  I'm used to wearing UA and Adidas compression shorts so it's probably just me on the fit.  I wear them to run and I think they're just ok for running.  The material is also heavier than what I'm used to so they're not see through.  I also bought a pair of the 7&#34; Baleaf compression shorts and found them to fit better than these in the same size.
3.0,I liked this bag but the drawstring didn't have a way of 'locking' so it would open up a lot. I guess you just need to get a clamp or pin to keep it closed but otherwise it was a great day bag that I used for traveling.
3.0,Beautiful shoes but a little loose at the front…. I would have kept them if it wasn’t because it is a 3 inch heel and not a  2 1/2 inch heel as advertised… I was told by the company that sometimes they measure them differently?  Makes no sense when the measurements are supposed to be from the heel down
3.0,The braiding was meh when it arrived.  But easily redone myself.  Fits well but the cap is not warm what so ever.
3.0,"It is super cute on, thick fabric, however, runs small & short.  I’m 5’4” and I found it too short for my liking. It also has a wire in the notched part of the  V in the front which I found weird & uncomfortable."
3.0,"Unfortunately these weren’t what I expected, I’m 5’3”, weigh 121 lbs and typically wear a size xs but I decided to try size small because xs isn’t an option. The small fit around my stomach, butt and thighs but there's absolutely no compression and the rest of the legging was loose. I’m not sure if they had an XS if it would fit right but in my opinion and from the looks of some of the images on here to include the stock images, these run wide and loose around the ankles anyway or maybe they’re meant for taller girls so that they would fit snug close to the calves. Either way, I’ve never had a pair of fitted leggings with such a wide gap around my ankles like this before regardless of my height. The blue ones were even more loose than the grey ones. The material is good but not great. The positive to these leggings are that they aren’t see through, they’re lightweight and they felt comfortable on but they weren’t worth keeping so I returned them."
3.0,"I am a cardigan persons however, this one size was really off. I purchased it in a women 1x and it look like a junior small. The sweater was nice however, the material is thin. Would not buy another."
3.0,I wish the clutch was a little bit bigger just having my cards send it it is very tight. The class on the zipper has already come off three times and I've had to fix it myself but the clutch is cute using it as a wallet only.
3.0,"These might not be bad in some of the darker colors. Unfortunately I ordered the white and it was just too see through. The cut is good, the material is soft, they are just on the thinner side of leggings. I’m not sure if I would be comfortable wearing this style to the gym, But they would be just fine for casualwear."
3.0,"The cuff is really cute, the only thing is the metal it's made of is really cheap and easily bends and could potentially break off. It's also kind of uncomfortable with the little leaves and welding spots poking your arm. Overall you get what you pay for."
3.0,"These are exactly what I need/ordered, but it did not come with the instructions to order the photos. If I could receive them, that would be appreciated. Definitely 5 stars if the instructions are included"
3.0,The belt quality is good but the width is too big.
3.0,Only received 57 out of the 60 bears that were ordered and about a third of the earring hooks were no good.
3.0,"I liked the size and the shape, but the colors are really daker than the photo."
3.0,The case itself is nice but lasted just as long as any other case; the spring loaded closing mechanism broke within a year.
3.0,"Made cheap and hate the pockets cant get them open to put hand in,not for really cold weather."
3.0,"This hat is beautiful; however the cut is as for a child, reason I am returning it."
3.0,Something is just off with this dress.  There seems to be some discrepancy with the print.
3.0,"I feel as thought I paid more for this than I should have. It just feels small, and the display is hard to read at just a glance. The backlight is puny and doesn't light the entire screen. I do like the every hour on the hour alarm, and the stopwatch feature is pretty neat. I wouldn't buy this one again if this watch breaks, but its certainly enough for now."
3.0,These were broken when they arrived. Part of the flower was broken off. Otherwise I would have been pleased.
3.0,"I am 5'1 and weigh 120lbs and this dress hit the floor with fabric to spare and the top didn't fit at all, it would take a very skilled tailor to make this fit on a body like mine."
3.0,they fit super small.
3.0,it is ok....not what I expected as far as material....didn't expect silk...the picture doesn't match what you get...
3.0,Too small and too short.  I give it a 3 star only for the color  and pleats
3.0,"I had to return it unfortunately.  I was expecting it to be fuller on top,  and bottom is huge for me.  But style in general is nice."
3.0,It okey
3.0,Everywhere else fitted loose except the arms. Had to get it altered before I can wear it. Otherwise cute top
3.0,"It is thin, and no pockets. Just what it indicates. Not one to wear out of the house for sure. I would say it is priced very high for the quality."
3.0,"Super cute design, but the felt is thin and I don't see this holding up with toddler play.  I am giving this as a gift so I might never find out how it holds up."
3.0,The pants are too loose and is not shapely.
3.0,Love it I'm 5'2&#34; it hangs right under my but not at my calf as seen in photo
3.0,Sized according to the guide but the high top waist is a bit big. The pockets turn inside out pretty easy. I removed the rear “pocket” flaps because they’re in a weird spot. The side zipper isn’t needed because the pants are a bit too big and the inside of the zipper scratched the hell out of my hip when pulling pants on. The inside of the zipper irritates unless a shirt is tucked in.
3.0,"I ordered this replacement band because it says it will fit up to an 8.7 inch wrist. It is exactly the same size as the band that came with Lily Sport, which is reported to fit 6.8 inches.  Because of this, I didn't even try to put it on. It does look nice, might use it eventually."
3.0,This shirt wasn't as nice as it looks in the photo. The top edge was scrunchy all the way around and the neck hole was a bit too small while the rest of the shirt was a little baggy. Returned.
3.0,"We bought a much nicer Wisconsin Badgers sherpa blanket for the SAME PRICE as this one, but this one was significantly less cozy. Apparently because the Buckeyes were a top 5 team most of the season, someone figured they could do a little price gouging on the sherpa blankets."
3.0,Small fits like XX-XS
3.0,"Nice material but the fit is too big , not true to size."
3.0,I wanted to love these but they’re way too small. I’m normally a 32D prepregnancy and wear size medium in maternity tops but the 34D band was way too small. The cup size was perfect however and it felt like it would’ve been really comfortable. The material was soft and had room to grow.
3.0,"The skirt is a great length and very cute. My iPhone 13 fits in the leg pocket. It’s a teensy bit big around the waist and I suspect if I wore it all day with a phone in the waist pocket, it would get baggy quickly. The big problem is that the skirt was horribly stained, right out of the bag, as if someone had trampled on it in work boots!  How does that even happen?!?!"
3.0,The necklace looks very cheap .<br />But ok for the price
3.0,"The bottoms of this bathing suit fit like a dream! The top was a little funky and the ties in the front were to short to make a proper bow. Because of this, I wasn't a fan of the top, but I kept the bottoms to wear with another top I already owned. Not terrible for only $20!"
3.0,The bottom is hard and was hoping a little  smaller
3.0,Chain broke easy
3.0,Way too large for slip resistance.  they really should fit tight.  they slide around on my feet which defeats the purpose of the socks
3.0,"Im 5'7 and about 155lbs. I bought the XL and it was too small length wise. I've never considered myself to have a long torso, but this suit made me feel that way."
3.0,A bit on the large size. Very comfortable though.
3.0,I ordered xl which I usually wear .  Fabric was a knit.
3.0,"I wear a US 9 and ordered the 9.5, and I’m glad I did. These shoes fit a little funky- there are some spots in the middle of the foot and the search where they pinch for no apparent reason. However! They are insanely cute shoes and work just fine with good comfy socks."
3.0,"This is more of a knitted sweater sleeve than a shrug. It's cute but the back as not as long as it appears in the picture. I was not expecting a jacket, I know the difference.  This cuts straight across from armhole to armhole. It would probably look good over a fitted shell."
3.0,I ordered a 8X in hopes that it would be about a 4X or 5X.  No such luck.  I would say a 8X is more like a 2X.<br />The shorts look and feel nice.  Just can't put them on to say how they feel.
3.0,I got this for my man but it hasn't been cold enuff for him to try them I plugged them in myself there kinda slow to warm upbut very soft an cudly to wear.
3.0,I was disappointed at the fit and feel of these socks.
3.0,"I normally wear a size Large for most polo style shirts. According to other reviews, these do tend to run a bit on the smaller side so I ordered an XL. It still seems to be a little too small for me. It's fairly thin material and the collar has no structure to it, so it's very floppy. The color and embroidered DW/Tardis logo are very nice. I will keep it and hope it holds up well enough."
3.0,Ordered for my daughter she wears a medium.. When she got this it fit like a shirt.. Was still able to wear just with leggings.. Super cute!
3.0,"I liked this dress but the sleeves weren't cap so much as flutter, and the torso was several inches too short for me.  This is possibly due to having a larger than average chest which used up the fabric, but I still had to return it.  Loved the length overall (just to my knees at 5'8&#34;) and the color was a rich burgundy."
3.0,They are soft and adjustable but since the material is so thin it will block the air if you breathe in even a little hard.  I find I keep moving the filter up to help.  With the material so thin the filters are heavier and tend to drop to the bottom.
3.0,I loved these leggings however after wearing them for part of the day the mesh had tiny holes in it. I'm sending them back and asked for a replacement so fingers crossed. They were super comfy so I am hoping the 2nd pair doesn't wear so quickly.<br /><br />Update - I am still waiting on my refund as unfortunately I had to return both pairs.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:3c7236e2eb7a7f198d53d4d978472844]] Good quality i do recommend it for beginners like me :)
3.0,I LOVE the dress! I wore it for a country concert and I got so many compliments! I ordered an extra small and I am 5” and I weigh 105 for reference!
3.0,"I received these boots and they really seem like a great sturdy boot. I really like the lacing system, the boots are lightweight and designed well. I bought one size up from my shoe size as recommended.  I put the boots on with just my regular pretty thin socks and the boots were very tight. My foot fits D size shoes but depending on the brand I may need a wide size. These boots were tight. There would be no way for them to fit over a wader with my foot. I would say, that if you have even a slightly wide foot, these will not fit. I rented a pair of Simms the other day, same size. there was plenty of room in the boot. I'm very disappointed that Orvis doesn't tell you this in the description. I was thnking maybe it's because of the Vibram soles, but that doesn't make sense. I have size D width hiking shoes and there plenty of room for my foot. I would think that a wading boot would at least be wide enough to fit over waders. These were tight to my foot. Even if my foot is a little wide, they shouldn't have been tight."
3.0,Beautiful top. Too small for me. Worth the price but my &#34;muscles&#34; in my arms were just too big. 😉lol.
3.0,"It fits cute & looks like the picture. The material is cheaper quality than I expected. The lapel is pale blue. The ad does tell you that upfront, but it really should be white. I thought I could incorporate pale blue with accessories but it's so faint, it doesn't match anything & just looks like white machine washed wrong. I opted not to wear it & may try to remove or cover the lapels."
3.0,"I do like the wallet overall, but the plastic screen on the ID area is falling out, and the button that is used to hold the air tag in has also fallen out. I’ve only had this for about a month now, so that was rather quick. Otherwise it’s been a pretty good wallet, the RFID works and is a good product in that regard."
3.0,When purchasing take your bust into consideration!
3.0,Smaller than expected and tore easily. Very stylish though.
3.0,"It's a little bit on the large size, but it is pretty and I am sure I will wear it on occasion."
3.0,"I wanted to wear this out on South Beach Miami....I ended up taking it to a Disney trip and wearing it to the pool. The material was okay and so was the dress. It wasn't that HOT....unlike the picture shown to the customers! It was ok, but I wouldn't purchase again."
3.0,Super cute. My daughter loves them but they are already fraying at the tongue in under a month.
3.0,Length to short<br />And wore once and washed and already have a hole in the crotch seam
3.0,very comfortable but they run small...I need to now order next size up :(
3.0,Too big for a woman
3.0,"This top is super cute and looks like good quality in person, too. However, it was a little more form fitting than I would have liked"
3.0,Fits a bit loose . The elastic is a bit too long for my son . He is 5
3.0,"Pros: unique design, good thick fabric, very comfy.<br />Cons: bad sewing work, take me a while to cut the unclean threads.  The dye for the fabric stains, at least the black one I bought. I washed twice before wearing, my fingers still got residue color."
3.0,"The color is just what was expected. The softness was great. The quality of thickness was very poor; therefore, I was disappointed for it was to be a gift to my granddaughter. L. Hardin"
3.0,"The craftsmanship is fine, but the color of the stone has hardly any blue.  It is practically white in color.  If I could get one with a bluer stone, I would keep the product and probably up this rating a star."
3.0,Cute but got an xlarge and fit like a medium
3.0,Fit as expected till it was washed. Shrinks quite a bit.  Love the colors and style. Hope I keep the weight off so this will continue to fit.
3.0,Fits my big noggin and that’s all that matters - only downside is the bill of the cap is very long<br /><br />Comfortable fit for a xxL head
3.0,"I love the looks of the cover up, but it was very short! Should be labeled as a “Juniors” fit."
3.0,These are not very user friendly. Thought the ends would just fit on child’s glasses but that’s not the case . No instructions and not ideal for a kid ..
3.0,"Looks the same as the image, minus not at shiny. Took awhile to get delivered tho."
3.0,"These pants are barely a step above sweatpants, so do not order them with the intention of wearing them as workwear. There is a zipper in the back that sticks a bit and the “belt” color didn’t quite match the pants."
3.0,The coloring on the 4 leaf clover is very faint.  Barely detectable.  I was dissappointed to say the least.  It was a Christmas present and too late to return it.
3.0,"Fits fine, material is as expected. Bought to go under a shirt for a party. Disappointed that the bottom and wrist stitch isn’t pink like shown in original picture. Already began the return process."
3.0,"I bought these sandals last year for my granddaughter, she loved them, they were so cute I ordered them again this year but one review said they ran big so I went down a size, big mistake. So sent them back went up 2 sizes."
3.0,Looks okay band is too soft
3.0,The picture made them look much larger than they are. It also looked a little cheap.
3.0,Material is on the thinner side but I didn't want something bulky either. Seams are a little thick and hurt because they kept rubbing between my toes. If you have heavier legs these will work well since the top elastic isn't so tight.
3.0,Was happy at first but then all of the little shiny pieces fell out.
3.0,"it is rather well made for the price and everything seems to be pretty good for the price.<br />however, I had to return because it did not suit my face.  I am an Asian and it does fit well on my face, however, the rectangle shape just did not suit well."
3.0,"Pay attention to the description. After browsing so many listings, I chose this one because they arrived sooner and in the main photo they are all black. BUT in reality they are a mix of black and white."
3.0,"I was  hoping they are oversized, but they are not.<br />Nice details on a side."
3.0,My child like it  but quality is low
3.0,"This was not supportive and I wouldn’t recommend this for any kind of vigorous activity if you are anything over a C cup. If you like this style but need more support, I wear one from Nike that I can actually run in."
3.0,"One was broken in the package when I received them, other than that they are adorable and my sensitive belly button hasn’t rejected them. Worth the money!"
3.0,"The paint looks more worn off then anything. Thats my biggest complaint, the paint."
3.0,"Well made, looks great. Only 3 stars because I wish it was about 3/4"" larger."
3.0,I will say that they are fluffy but they were a little too big for me. if you like a little bit of room then you are OK. and the toes are wide on the front. But I do recommend them because they can be comfortable If fit the right way.… So I sent two pictures one so you can see how adorable they look and the other one pointing to how much room I have on the back. Hope this helps.
3.0,"This may sound strange but I wish this bag was smaller (usually people complain about not enough space, right). I have all my swimming equipment in it (paddles, XL Speedo fins and pull buoy) and it fills only half of the bag. As the result of all the extra mesh everything gets tangled up and I have to ""wade"" through the bag to extract things. It would have been perfect at 1/2 or 2/3 of the size."
3.0,"I'm 6'1&#34;, 145 lbs. These have a weird fit to them. They sort of have a bell shape to them, almost like a dress. I definitely need something more form-fitting with some stretch to it. The material was nice and breathable, but was a little too baggy and short for my build."
3.0,To small said they were large
3.0,They are big  definitely wouldn't recommend for under 7 yrs
3.0,I ordered these for my five-year-old son who always wears the one dollar sunglasses from target. These were so cute and I love that they were polarized and I was able to pick out the lens color. They are worried about once a day for an hour in the car. After about a week I had to replace both of the screws in the arms. Now the coating on the outside of the lenses is coming off and I am no longer able to keep the screws in. These would be amazing if they didn’t fall apart so fast. I’ll order again because my son needs polarize sunglasses.
3.0,The color is not true to what is displayed online.
3.0,"This belt looks great and fits nicely.  What I found is that the buckle releases as I am working...and as a teacher in the front of the classroom, it can be &#34;awkward&#34;.  I had a similar version of the belt and buckle that lasted and worked wonderfully for 3 years straight...loved it (once these things die...their DOA, thought about replacing the leather part but within a few weeks both the leather and the ratchet part of the buckle gave out...so make sure to order the entire belt and buckle - it's only a couple of dollar difference and not worth the hassle to have the buckle die right after buying a new leather).  I might try exchanging the belt and see if I just got a wonky buckle this time around.  Am likely to switch brands because the ratchet belt is much better overall than the traditional hole in model of belt.  If you get one with a good buckle I promise you will never go back to the old style of belt.<br /><br />I am updating the review ...purchased belt in April inside of buckle (ratcheting locking part) broke in August.  Loved the belt (Leather part looks almost new after 4 months of daily wear) but have to replace. ..Will see if company can help me."
3.0,"It is a very pretty, vibrant necklace. It is a bit cheap, but you get what you pay for. I have received many compliments on it.  My first necklace came defective. When I emailed the company they responded quickly and professionally. They sent me a replacement right away."
3.0,"As another review states... these are a really bright copper color.  Not a pretty rose gold at all.  Other than the color, they seem to be good quality."
3.0,"I bought two. One for each of my sons. One son liked it the other hated it.<br /><br />It is very warm and comfortable but the fabric has a very strange synthetic feel. It is a little spongy feeling and just does not have a natural look or feel.<br /><br />The son that liked it, thought it was 70's retro looking. He has worn it a few times and it seems to be holding up well"
3.0,I ordered these shoes in the wrong size ! while they are very fashionable i wouldve envisioned myself wearing a foot insole to make sure my feet didnt hurt when walking in them! i never reordered them in the correct size! I would recommend them if you dont plan on doing much walking! these are more &#34;let me look cute&#34; shoes ! so if your looking to wear these to stand in or walk around in for a long period of time i would invest in some good insoles or keep looking...just my honest opinion
3.0,Distorts driving vision
3.0,"These leggings are really thick and very tight, definitely run small.  I'm 5'5&#34; and 118 lbs and the small was uncomfortably tight and ran a little short. They are more like thick tights than leggings in terms of material and comfort. If you want some thing with a lot of support these would probably be great in the right size. I returned them."
3.0,Fit perfect and very comfortable. Only problem is there was a tiny hole in the material on the back that would definitely grow in size after wearing. For the money spent I'd expect better.
3.0,"This dress was a good length and quality but the sizing was way off. I got a medium and it felt like an XL. I wish they had an XS. It would be a good dress if you could find the right size for you. I’m 5’6 145 pounds, and I got the medium. I should have gotten the small."
3.0,I’m 5’9 138lbs.  I got the large for the length.  Was a lil big and still a lol short for me.
3.0,"I am a 36C, 127 pounds and 5 &#34; in height. I purchsed the dress for my bridal shower and although its cute I have a few disspointments.<br />The lace is stretchy but thin and the lace closest to the waist in the back folds out instead of fitting. Would be cute besides those two issues"
3.0,Way to small says  e<br />X large but fits like medium
3.0,"Cute small bag but really not much room for anything. I thought it would expand a bit more so it's hard to fit my glass case if I also want my cell phone and a few other small items. I had an older model of this purse and it wasn't so stiff, and fit my glasses, cell phone, lip stick, pen and even my super small zippered change purse.. Maybe with more use it will stretch out a little, but doesn't seem that it will with the way it is now made."
3.0,Little tight around my hips and thighs. Would have liked it to be bigger in crotch too.
3.0,underwhelmed. made me look like a grandma. not that i don’t like how grandmas look but just not ready for that yet since im in my 30s. returned. will rebuy when im 70.
3.0,It’s ok but the metal looks cheap. Decided it to give it to his teacher. Just looked too cheap
3.0,Good quality except I only count 4 inserts and the infromation stated 6 double sided inserts. I attached the two units together and made one eight insert unit . Now I have plenty of room for my cards and pictures.
3.0,"nice but the size is not for women, it is for girls"
3.0,This is thinner than I expected and not quite as fitted as I had hoped.
3.0,"Pros- comfortable, attaches to the actual watch well.<br />Cons- runs large, even the smaller size.<br />  The way the “clip” is designed externally on your wrist, it can catch on something and undo your watch. It happened on my 4th use while I was taking off a sweatshirt. Luckily, I noticed before my watch fell to the ground. Also, not fond of the loop that you feed the band through, as it doesn’t lay flush. I wouldn’t suggest this band for an active lifestyle!"
3.0,Cute but see through.
3.0,I love this pattern and was so so excited to wear it. But it was tight on me. I usually wear an extra large comfortably. Order a larger size.
3.0,Its a little small in the cups but still cute. I like the halter option but it does dig into my neck slightly. Shipping was on time.
3.0,A little bigger than I thought and shiny too!
3.0,Good quality ring. Diamonds do fall out after a lot of wear.
3.0,"Love the colors,  these are NOT leather as stated in description."
3.0,"I ordered an XS based on reviews. Normally I'd order a small. I'm 5', #150. Everything fit perfectly except the slip/lining part. It's too short!! I'm still able to wear it although it's a little uncomfortable as I'm always checking to see if the slip is riding up and exposing things."
3.0,"The product was great and delivery as well, just not sized lg enough."
3.0,"Great design, but they ran small.  Since they were too small for me, i gave them to my 10 year old niece who is average size and they barely fit here.  I was disappointed"
3.0,Very comfortable and warm but I wear a small or extra small in most jackets and the small I got swallows me.
3.0,"I purchased a black pair of these last and although the arm came loose and couldn't be tightened I have still worn them and really like them. So, I ordered a pair of tortoise shell patterned glasses and for some reason the lenses are really bad or defective. The lenses make it hard to focus and I can't really wear them. I put on my old ones and can see fine the new ones, not so much."
3.0,Print is super cute but it's too wide in shoulders and fits weird in the armpits.  If it fit right it would be super cute.  I'm 5'8&#34; and 150 lbs so I'm disappointed this was too big.
3.0,Gems are kinda big and the backs are also big
3.0,Muy creativo
3.0,"Way too small!  It does stretch, but still at least 2 sizes too small."
3.0,"I loved the color, but overall, this sweater is a disappointment.  After reading the reviews, I ordered both a Large (my normal size if I don't want something fitted), & an XL to try.  I tried on the XL first & knew I'd be returning them both.  It's short & the fit is unflattering.  I didn't bother trying on the L, as I knew it'd be even shorter.  The material is nice, but this sweater is a dud."
3.0,"This was for my daughter who is 5’10”. It is fine for a shift dress, but not very flattering unless you are super thin with a large chest. The cut was rather off, but it was packaged nice and quick shipping/returns."
3.0,I had to return the dress because the top was way too small. I am a 36 D and the tank top part barely fit over my chest. I ordered the same dress but with sleeves a size larger and it fit perfect.
3.0,Great design but the material was very stiff
3.0,"I love the reaction of many people when they see this mask, but with OR without the filter in, it is very hard to breathe in it."
3.0,"They are pretty comfy, but there doesn’t seem to be much stretch in them. Just make sure you get the right size. I honestly wish I sized up when I got them, but they work. Just pay attention to sizing"
3.0,"My 1st grader uses these for her masks at school or other longer days when masks go on and off frequently.  With very light use, maybe two weeks, two of them have already snapped or frayed and my kiddo is pretty careful with her things. These were inexpensive, but really still not worth the cost with how quickly they are falling apart."
3.0,"This item took forever to ship, I ordered an extra large and it is a little big but not enormous. I ordered the “sky blue” one and it is not the same color AT ALL! On the plus side, another review it mentioned the dress was see through, but I did not have that problem."
3.0,Sleeves are way too small
3.0,Tight fit around the brim of the nose might not be for everyone.
3.0,Wasnt tight enough to stay on my head at night
3.0,Pilled after two washes. It was cute though.
3.0,"This runs small, good looking top but had to return"
3.0,"Material is super soft, but the straps and part that goes around the top is too restrictive for comfortable sleeping."
3.0,"We just received this and were a bit disappointed.  Shame on us for not reading the entire product information to be aware that it is 100% polyester.  Would not have purchased this for $40, had I known.  The tags proudly boast that it is hand printed in USA, however the cheap, thin shirt is made in China.  Even as a cotton long sleeve shirt, would have been less bummed."
3.0,"I've worn this a lot in the last few weeks and have to say it was really cool looking at first but it is not holding up.  I wear it in and out of the pool, around town and what not but find that it is starting to stretch out.  Also, there is no clear clasp, you just loop the one string past one of the bigger beads.  The problem with this is it doesn't stay and comes loose all the time.  I don't expect this to make it to the end of summer"
3.0,"Normally wear a L/XL, ordered an XXL. Just like the other reviewers said, it’s a suit meant for a very short torso-ed person. I’m only 5’4” and it was too short for me."
3.0,"The shoes are good for the price, but on the edge where it looks to be stitched it is actually plastic and I think that just looks cheap! On the upside they are very soft and very pretty pink!"
3.0,[[VIDEOID:25e9aa406601755e976b30369aee6c2]] Review based on 2 days of wearing.<br /><br />I like the color of the leather.<br />I didn't like the thickness of the leather band. The leather band when touching water it generates bad smell.  I could not find any instructions in regards to water resistance.
3.0,"The dress itself was cute, but the material looked cheap."
3.0,"It's very tight against the (standard sized) end pin, and squeaks when moved.  I stuck a socket in the hole and left it there for a day.  The squeaking lessened with the hole enlarged."
3.0,runs very small.  Go up a size if ordering.  Very pretty and I would like them if they fit as expected.
3.0,"As someone else pointed out, the robe arrived stuffed into shrink wrap, not even folded! I washed it on gentle cycle, dried it on delicate, and left it hanging in the bathroom for a few days in hopes that any remaining wrinkles would fall out. It wasn't perfect when I finally gift-wrapped it, but it was certainly better than when it arrived. Surprisingly, my three-year-old great-grand daughter loved it, and after trying it on (it was a bit big, but she'll grow into it), she immediately ran to my sofa and lay down with the robe as a snuggly blanket. Good points: the color is pretty (""red"" = rose) and the texture is soft. Bad points: the shrink wrap causing wrinkles; some indications around the seams, etc., that the robe is cheaply made. I didn't have any problems with the teeth. I won't, however, be buying any more clothing made in China if I can help it."
3.0,So i really like this product but tbh its so uncomfortable to wear. Maybe cuz i have meat on me but it hurts. It pulls on everything and you definitely can't wear your belt with jeans. It's nice and looks just like the picture but the only way i can see this working for someone is if they had a flat stomach.
3.0,Way to big.  But super cute
3.0,I had to wrap a lot of tape inside them to get them to fit on my heels as they were too big:(!
3.0,"It gets 5 stars for cuteness and 2 stars for how bad it smelled coming out of the package. Just like another reviewer stated it had a really strong moldy smell when it arrived. I febreezed it, washed it twice and it’s finally de-stinked enough to try on and I really like it. It’s perfect for my fall bike commuting to keep the chill at bay while cycling to and from work. But yeah, it really stank."
3.0,She hasn't worn it
3.0,"Returning and exchanging for 3 sizes up. After reading reviews I ordered 1 size up but it was so tight and measurements listed are way off. Personally, I would order 3 sizes up. My son per the sizing chart should be a size 6 but returning to get an adult size small. Hope the small fits."
3.0,This dress looks pretty in pictures but it only has one button on it and it ties. I wanted to return it but my daughter wanted to use it as a beach cover up at a resort.
3.0,"It took quite awhile to get here but when it did, I was a little disappointed, the stitching looked like someone got lazy at the end and didn't really try that hard to make it look nice and when I tried the hat on it was a little small (so be warned that this hat might not fit you if you have a big head). All in all it was alright, except that it took so long I almost forgot about it totally and when it got to me it was a little surprise. It doesn't fit me that well so I won't be wearing it on the regular like other beanies.<br />Also I have a weird face shape so I can't really pull off this beanie but maybe if I wear it long enough people will fall for the illusion and be like &#34;Oh she can pull that beanie off maybe I should get one. She looks so cool in it!&#34;"
3.0,Very nice but not comfortable.
3.0,I really wish they would have put the pattern on the inside of the ruffle as it flips all the time and shows the white.
3.0,Nice and lightweight but too thin and no slot to add filter.
3.0,"This bra is itchy , runs just a tad to small in the cup and you can see the line mid breast , through any shirt you wear ."
3.0,Very little directions to take out links and put back together.
3.0,Did not like the way it was made.
3.0,Fit was great but faded after 2 washes.
3.0,Like the shorts run a bit small
3.0,"The mask just didn’t come together like I expected. Having to assemble, no filter system, but it did fit well. I really liked the fit !"
3.0,Quality is good but belt was too small for me. I'm a size 10 and the belt was tight so I returned it.
3.0,this item is really cute but it fell apart pretty quickly. is having this for a month worth the price?
3.0,"It fits as expected but it's a made in China, cheaply made product. The pockets look like grandma pockets. Old fashioned. I don't like them to be honest. In fact I'm going to find out how to either remove them or improve them. The only good thing about this product is its redeemable price. Most Shawl Collar Cardigans costs between $70 - $160 bucks. So you get what you pay basically. I just wasn't expecting the unattractive pockets."
3.0,Wouldn't recommend to anyone
3.0,I bought for having an extra cheap pair for driving to leave in the car. The quality was so bad that I have to my daughter to play with with no regard for their safety. Not worth it even with a coupon.
3.0,"pants and hoodie have a thin and cheap feeling to it. fits as expected. the print on the hoodie doesnt look as bold or vibrant like the picture and there are a few printing blemishes. the ""navy"" print on the pants looks good.<br />the thing I'm most upset is that the pants dont have pockets. the price of the set is a little overpriced but I guess we're paying for the print rather than the quality of the sweats.<br />I was somewhat disappointed with this purchase but I probably shouldnt be going to amazon for Navy pride clothing."
3.0,"Arm length was too short, otherwise ok."
3.0,"hard plastic and no padding for the sections that contact your face make it somewhat uncomfortable.  Also means its not really air tight so dust and debris can make there way inside the goggles if you had thoughts of using these in the dessert.  the dark glass is super dark, just a heads up."
3.0,Looks good easy to adjust band a little hard to put back on wrist.
3.0,"Pretty but very large, didn't look great on my small boobs"
3.0,The PJ's are as pictured but run a size small. I will be returning. The shirt pre-washing in a 4t is the same size as a Gap 3t.
3.0,"Glad I ordered a larger size to fit my 8 year old, otherwise they would not fit."
3.0,"These are a simple headband with cardboard type material attached for the horns and decorated in a red, sparkle design. The stickers are as pictured but wouldn't last for any great length of time.<br />I would consider this a fun, little costume additional. This would be great for parties and photo ops.<br />The price is good for what you get in a plastic bag.<br />Nice addition for Halloween or cosplay."
3.0,"Looks nice, larger than I expected.  Is a little too big for my wrist."
3.0,One of mine wore out and loosened after a couple of wears. I had to tie a knot in the side to get it to fit. Waste of money!
3.0,"The leather is such high quality, it's beautiful, but it is INCREDIBLY heavy. I'm so sad, I am going to return it."
3.0,"Too tight, but pretty. The weave was a lovely and  the color was a perfect neutral."
3.0,"While elegant looking and cosmetic with tool kit, it became unglued at watch connection and fell off my wrist.  Thank goodness I felt it come off and did not lose my favorite watch. I have reglued the seam so will see if it holds. Also the leather scratches easily and looks very worn already."
3.0,"OK for the price.  Fabric is very thin and light.  not as structured as hoped but for the price fine for a weekend, certainly not business appropriate."
3.0,Way off the mark---- Sent the wrong size but I will give it to my Daughter and let her throw it out.<br />I will try again in a week or two.
3.0,"This gift was well received & loved. It does feel cheap in the hands. Not something you would want to wear & use. Its decent for someone to display but not handle. Once you hold it, you know this is a cheap knockoff of something else."
3.0,Good quality and design but too small
3.0,Fits somewhat large. The way the bra is sewn in makes the top look very awkward as if it is sideways . It does not look very attractive. I cut it out of the suit and added a different  bra in order to wear it.
3.0,"For now 3 stars! Yet to experience it in the rain! That may earn it another star if it performs well! For now, the material is very rough and loud!! It is One Size Fit All, BUT it runs very small. I would say it fits somewhere b/w an Adult Md and Adult Large. The fact that it's made to fold up into the pocket as a carrying pouch and is light & compact is what earns it the 3 stars!"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:d827a13c1ee800651bc8dbf76d85ece7]] Is not dress-up play quality. Got this for my 3 year old son to be a King and play dress up with his older sisters. It is very flimsy and will need to be monitored for safety as the black pole is very thin and lightweight plastic that will break easily if stepped on or tapped against something,  which then could cut skin easily.  Will break within a few uses. One time accessory more likely.  Not worth $10.00.<br /><br />If you needed something for one time gig or the night on Halloween then this would do."
3.0,"I purchased this dress because i was in need of something to wear last minute for a wedding this summer. I like the ruching in the dress,because it give the body a nice look,but one of my straps were bigger than the other and it had the things for you to tighten the straps but I found that pointless as a woman with bigger boobs… the price was great but I definitely wouldn’t wear this again"
3.0,"Bought two, one was great the other.... not so much"
3.0,Did't realize how small it was.
3.0,"I bought these long sleeve in a gray and wine red (which was a pretty color). The dresses fit nicely but the fabric was on the thin side and seemed clingy and like it would wrinkle easily. I also felt like I was wearing a nightgown more than a dress, so I sent them back."
3.0,way bo big
3.0,"Went great with my Cleopatra costume. It's a pair if two bracelets. The one on my left hand kept flipping around, although it's minor, it was irritating. After a while he left one broke anyways."
3.0,Don't  fit on top of head.
3.0,"works well, price is good"
3.0,Cute but runs very small for the kids shirt. I bought my son a 2T and it was more like a 12 month.
3.0,"These 1.5 inch earrings are pretty and sparkly.  However, the closure for the size of this earring does not feel secure to me.  The post are thin and drag the ear down a little.  I have a 1 inch pair in silver similar to these from another seller that are better quality, in my opinion and I didn't feel like they would fall out of my ears.  Pics are attached for comparison.  Also, a gift box instead of a pouch would have been preferred."
3.0,"While I loved the dress, it was a little tight in certain areas"
3.0,"The gloves are acceptable, however they do not retain their wet-look for any long duration.  By that I mean more than twenty wearings.  Afteral, they do have to be washed."
3.0,Nice quality but definitely not true to size. This was much smaller than a 1-XL.
3.0,"The anchor is beautiful. Sadly, the chain's clasp broke and was flimsy."
3.0,Some of this is not metal and actually it's a plastic with metallic paint looks really cheap
3.0,I like the glasses a lot but after I opened it they were scratched a lot in the lenses and even missing one screw from the frame.. seems like returned products.. I will return in but like said glasses itself really sturdy and looked strong enough to use daily glasses.. after I return this I will order again to see how it would be
3.0,"The jacket is thinner than expected; flimsy material.  You need layers when wearing this. Also, the zipper broke on the first wear. Hence 3/5 stars."
3.0,Not enough slots for credit cards
3.0,It look good but unconfortable if wear it for long hours
3.0,"Very cute as pictured, size runs small. It is comfortable but would be better if true size."
3.0,This is huge for a woman. I can slide it on and off without unbuckling.  This needs to come in sizes to choose.
3.0,not what I was hoping for
3.0,It’s very fragile it broke within the first week!!
3.0,"finally got to use my heated vest due to all the snow out here, and low and behold the zipper breaks off. too late to return the vest. really disappointed. I guess I will have to use safety pins lol"
3.0,Size is too small.  border line choker.
3.0,Very cute skirt! Too bad it was too tight :(
3.0,"It’s a very cute design but unfortunately too long for me. I’m 4’11 and even when the skirt was pulled high on my waist it was a tripping hazard. Also there was some static while wearing it, so it would cling to my body instead of looking flowy like the picture."
3.0,They have a weird smell that won’t wash out.  Overall what they advertised.
3.0,"This shirt is very pretty, but not sweatshirt material. It is a polyester. The sleeves and bottom are a little short, so if you like your belly covered, keep looking. I am usually a L/XL and ordered an XL. It is pretty form fitting for something I expected to be a looser fit. If you’re looking for something pretty and casual for around the house, it is a decent co-vid look."
3.0,It's cute but much bigger than expected based on size chart.  I'll keep it until my daughter grows though.  I think if you have the right fit it would be darling.
3.0,"It was a great deal for the price. 3 solid, basic maxi skirts with good stretch. Perfect for an easy work outfit on the go and packs well."
3.0,Size it not accurate and the material is very thing.
3.0,The strap on the chest part is too tight. I had to cut the strap in half and then I cut it off. Being that there was a string to tie the top I am going to use that to keep the top on.
3.0,"I bought this bracelet for my wife last Christmas and she loved it. Three months after the bracelet broke (the end silver piece holding the beads on) and I contacted the seller. I was a little disappointed that their only reply was to order a new one with a link to the product. My thought is, if the first one broke after three months why would I buy a second especially when the seller replied the way they did. I found a different bracelet from a different seller. Also, be careful when putting on and taking off, the wire can easily stretch."
3.0,"Bought XL, I’m a size 15/16, XL Top,38 DD bra. It came up mid thigh and was snug on my arms. The main part was it was stretched over my chest so that the color was to stretched to see. Returning for XXL. Good thing for amazon prime"
3.0,Color fades away quickly
3.0,It's super cute. Just like every other review the ruffles are not like the picture so if you are buying for the ruffles don't. It's flat. The fabric around the top is very restrictive. I cannot raise my arms at all. I cut the seam in the back and now it's great. You can't even tell it was supposed to be sewn together in the back.
3.0,"These are OK, but hard to insert into jeans and don't seem to work that well. JMO!"
3.0,Cute but slightly larger than is comforable =/ but hey it blocks the sun and I look fab
3.0,Thinner than expected and already has picks on material
3.0,Plenty long but so tight. I usually wear large or x large. I ordered x large. I am 5ft 9in about 145lbs. I am debating on keeping because so snug. Very comfortable. Material great
3.0,"Very handsome case. I wish it had a better corner bumper and was slightly deeper. It could be a little more substantial. My concern is that this case doesn't offer enough protection against drops. It does fit well even with a glass screen protector, though.<br />I bought the case for my husband and he seems to like it."
3.0,"Demasiado largo, en la foto se ve a medio de muslo y vino por debajo de la rodilla, tengo que enviarlo al sastre. Pero muy buena tela y bonito"
3.0,"It was too big for me, but the design was great. It just didn't fit me right."
3.0,Just a kinda strange look
3.0,Got for the kids
3.0,Not quite as think as the picture makes it out to be.  More think than thick.  But overall it's soft and long so it can be wrapped around a couple times and then looks a little thicker.  For the price I paid however I'd say I paid for what I got.
3.0,"It's a good shirt, but I should've paid attention to the sizing of the product. Otherwise the material is really light and I look forward to utilizing it during the spring and summer months."
3.0,"I don't like them as much as I hoped I would. The upper portion is blurry when looking at distance. The bifocal part is great as I can read things I couldn't before just by looking down. However in sunlight they are dimmer than I think they should be. They don't enhance color, clarity or visual experience the way they claim. There is no wow factor. I recently ordered another paid of sunglasses and those do light up everything around you and are amazing. That's how I knew the HD glasses were not as good."
3.0,"The dress was ok, but I returned it. I bought it for my 10 y.o. daughter and it was huge. I checked size on the dress was 11-12T, as I ordered. I am 5,4' and 140 pound and even to me it was big."
3.0,I wasn't able to choose my appropriate sizing for this and received an XL so I guess my measurements don't really matter. The XL seems to be around what I would think itd be but the construction of this top seems a bit off.<br /><br />The elastic on the top and bottom of the bandeau was tight and fitted but the fabric in-between seemed much looser. That would imply that there isn't as much compression through the whole top and that this bandeau is likely to give muffin top or squish in I think. Pads are what you would expect from these type of bandeaus.<br /><br />Overall I think it looks a bit inexpensive and I think it'd be unsupportive. :/
3.0,It's a very pretty earing but it's a little larger then i thought it would be. If you like a bigger earring then this is definitely for you.
3.0,Not a huge fan of the material. The most annoying part though is how the waist in the back fits. It rides down awkwardly while the front stays put. I will keep them because I need something but I definitely wouldn't recommend them.
3.0,"This bra needs some adjustments, but nothing one can't fix, I had to unstitch the front straps so this doesn't snag and could fit better. Good for the price tough, not great, not horrible."
3.0,"These are cute but it’s like clip on to smaller one, have to return"
3.0,"Received earlier than expected, cannot enjoy it yet because necklace was broken and needs to be replaced. Since it was so cheap a complaint is not necessary, main eye piece is intact."
3.0,The size is too small. I wear a 10/12 typically and ordered a Large. The cut was nice but I felt like I was squished into this suit.<br /><br />Order a size up! At least!!!!!!
3.0,It's a shoe bag...heavier than I thought (good thing) and should keep the &#34;shoe smell&#34; away from the other packed items with no problem. I love the option of washing it!
3.0,"I loved this dress. The color is beautiful and the style is sexy while still being warm. The problem was the material showed every panty line, bra strap and skin ripple. It even showed my bellybutton ring.  I’m really picky about those things so I returned it sadly."
3.0,We loved the fit and texture of this dress. The only down side was the terrible odor when it arrived. We washed it twice to try to get the smell out and it is much better but wow it really smelled awful when it arrived.
3.0,Falls of easy
3.0,No the greatest quality in fabric. The fabric slightly stretch. It doesn't run in true size. Has 0 support and you can see through in the light.<br />The only thing I like it was the design.
3.0,"These are not good for workouts because when you lay on your back the knot in your lower back is very uncomfortable. So if you want this for a casual look with a strappy bra underneath they are great, but consider the knot thing if using them for the gym. Cool material and cute. A little bigger than I expected. If I was going to keep them I would exchange for a size down."
3.0,"Looks good but after 3 months of daily usage it lost 4 screws already.<br />Other than that, it`s a OK wallet .<br />Spend a little bit more and buy a better one."
3.0,"They were a bit tight on my girl's feet, but overall she was satisfied."
3.0,"So I ordered this a size up and got a 2xl, to be safe.... This dress was HUGE around my bust and I have a large bust (38DDD) but was a little snug around the bottom.  I had to return this because it just didn't work for my body type.  The dress is pretty and a good material... But it made me look frumpy..  For reference, I am about a size 16 with a 39inch waist 210lbs and I carry most of my weight in my middle and this definitely wasn't a good fit."
3.0,Ordered for my daughter. She loved them and was pleased with how they looked. Looked exactly like the picture and they were delivered faster than expected.
3.0,"Great for the price, but the stitching around the top opening unraveled within a few weeks of owning."
3.0,"I'm 5.8 and weight 160, I ordered an extra large. Way to short for a dress. The color is pretty, I will wear it with a pair of capris or shorts. Made from 100% polyester. It has a silky feel (not breathable fabric)"
3.0,The head band is probably the most uncomfortable thing ever but it did the trick for my costume
3.0,"When the purse arrived, it was white, not multi colored. Very disappointed since this was a gift for someone."
3.0,I bought a medium but it fits more like a small
3.0,Sizing off however will keep hoping to loose weight
3.0,"I gave this as a gift and although she liked it; I would not have purchased this for myself, because the pearl attached to the bracelet does not stay in place on the wrist."
3.0,"The shoe was pretty poorly constructed, smelled bad, pinched my toes and had very little support so I sent them back and decided to invest a little more money in shoes that will hopefully last much longer than these would."
3.0,Gave it to my sister since it wasn’t going to fit me due to the straps not adjusting past the ruffle front.
3.0,"I like the materials and construction, but their sizing is two sizes smaller than everything else I have.  It really disappointing because their shipping is slow AF too so getting replacements is out of the question."
3.0,"I still give these 3 start because they seem well made and are super soft inside, but the soul is like that of a normal shoe, which is a bit excessive for a house shoe, although that still doesnt bother me too much. The only real complaint I have (without having worn them much yet) is they are too big. Even after the warnings to order a size up I ordered my normal size and they are way too big - the heel comes off as I walk. Really disappointed because ultimately I dont think I'll be able to wear them much"
3.0,"They feel good comfortable but definitely not warm at all, I live in NJ and I tried them today at 16 F and I was freezing with 10 minutes I waited in the train station, good fabric, but not for cold weather!!!"
3.0,Said &#34;Wine&#34; and it is BRIGHT RED.  I look like Santa Clause.
3.0,Nice fit although not so great the
3.0,Is not very big.
3.0,"These capris run a little small, but I am going to keep them. Hopefully I will loose a little weight"
3.0,"Ordered my normal size based on others saying it was true to size, but it was actually like 2 sizes too small"
3.0,This was very cute but the suit immediately got a tear in the seam after one use.
3.0,"I loved this dress when I saw it on Amazon. When I got it the color was completely wrong (in the pic or looked a lime green/yellow) but in real life it was a sunshine yellow. I expected the fabric to be a stretchy cotton instead of was a shiny, cheap looking polyester. Overall it was nothing like what it looked like in the picture except for the the words."
3.0,"I was excited about this when I ordered.  Based on the photos and description, I thought it would be a perfect go-to summer dress.  Sadly, it's WAY shorter than shown in the picture, and the front part came to the middle of my thighs (about 15&#34; from the seam, which sits at the natural waist / belly button).  The top of the dress fit really nicely and the material was super comfortable.  If you don't mind a super short dress, then give this a try.  Otherwise, keep looking!"
3.0,"They are cute, BUT. I ordered a small (5' 2&#34;, 110 lbs) because everyone said to order a size up, and I was SWIMMING in them. Will update when I return for an extra small."
3.0,Cute hat but small.
3.0,Cute bag but came folded in the box and that crease won't come out.  Also the bag is not lined.
3.0,The elastic is too long to fit over the ears so therefore the mask does not fit snug enough
3.0,"Good for what I need.  Probably would not hold up for airline use, very thin plastic."
3.0,"Wife loves owls... got her these socks in December. She is having similar problems to some described here. Toes get caught on extra threads inside. 3 months later, she's telling me that one pair is already starting to wear out."
3.0,"Cute shoes, but they run at least a half size large."
3.0,"The band is starting to peel after 3 weeks so definitely won’t last you long. I don’t wear during showers or washing dishes, so not sure why it started so soon"
3.0,Fabric is a little cheap. Too sturdy not comfortable around the waist .
3.0,"Great size to be worn as a mass veil. It is not super soft and of great quality, though. It is just ok. But serves its purpose and was pretty unexpensive."
3.0,"a very cute shirt, but it is a cheap quality, a bit smaller then i wanted, and you can see thew it more then you should be able to. i can tell just by feeling it that the print is not gonna last very many washs, so just keep that in mind"
3.0,Great  look for a little price. Great for travel jewelry  when you don't want to pack your real jewelry.
3.0,Earrings looks very cute but only find one earring instead of a pair.<br />One come without the magnetic.<br />Will be returning it.
3.0,"Nothing terrible, they are OK, but for me not as good as my favorite brand.  Although the concept of having the adjustable band sounds great, it is just not that stretchy on the small black elastic area, so it's not as snug fitting or easy to put on and off (unless I suppose you adjust it every time). I also wasn't in love with the fabric I selected. I have many &#34;sweaty bands&#34; brand headbands, and I suppose they have me spoiled.  I debated keeping this but have decided to return it (and order my fave brand instead).<br />Honestly the only reason I tried these was that they were less expensive, but I was reminded of that old quote, &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;."
3.0,"It is cute, but slightly small in size."
3.0,Nicely made but slightly smaller than I’d prefer
3.0,"Super cute sweatshirt, but the sweatshirt itself is made in China, it is not a name brand, it might be silk screened in the USA but not sure.  I bought a size larger than I normally wear and it fits.  Very glad I bought it on sale."
3.0,Didn't fit me i have a X Large  and the thread is loose and falling off
3.0,Ok watch for the price.
3.0,"I became a cat mom and cat grandma last summer when my kids attracted a pregnant stray into our home. We're all-in now, and we own momma Kitty and one of her babies too. Here to stay. In keeping with my new fondness for kitties, I got this fun ring set. It's great quality and totally wearable. At the time of this writing I'm wearing the largest of the 3 rings. The other 2 are property of my 11 yr old. I wear mine several times a week or more. It fits snuggly and comfortably and has a profile that is sleek enough to not get caught or snag -ever. I wash my hands with it on, and go about my normal, busy life. The ring still looks new (it's been months since my purchase) and the little red stones that make the cat eyes are firmly in place. I'm very impressed.<br />Update: the silver is wearing off and it's a rose colored metal underneath that's kind of like brass.  Hmmmm. All good things come to an end. Next time I won't get it wet or wear it often."
3.0,"It's a little shorter than I expected, but my husband loves it on me. I plan to wear it on New Years Eve. I bought a size Large. My measurements are size 8/10, 40-30-40, and I am curvy. It really accentuates the breasts."
3.0,"It took a while to arrive (3 days past latest arrival date). I don't want to blame that on the seller, it could have been USPS. I'm not 100% thrilled with the shirt. The picture is slightly off center and crooked. It will do it's not that noticeable. Its just a screen print like t-shirt shops make on vacation. It could have been more appropriately priced at $10."
3.0,Shirt is cute but runs very small and has nooooo stretch what so ever! Had to send back
3.0,Their good for indoors but the interior foam sole of the slippers gets flat very quickly
3.0,"Ordered 2XL didn't fit well, more like a small XL. Was disappointed as it was a Valentines day gift but still very cool. Overall good material and print is great, I would maybe order one size up from normal."
3.0,They looked nice but they are as cheap as the price.  They lasted less than a season before they fell apart.
3.0,"Way too big, came from China"
3.0,Picture made this product look nicer than it actually was.
3.0,I bought this for my son and new grandson. The quality seems well but they haven't really been able to use it. The pouch hole goes all the way to the waste line of the shirt. The hoods are cute but it doesn't matter if the kid is in a ball at your belly! This will work when he's big enough to stand up or you forgo the purpose and hold the baby in the pouch.
3.0,"Great price,"
3.0,"I bought this last summer, and totally forgot to review it. The color was absolutely beautiful! I normally wear a 14 and the bottoms were absolutely wonderful. They fit perfect and are so comfy. The top on the other hand, wasn't as great. I knew I was taking a risk, but it just didn't fit. Now, just keep in mind that I do wear a 36 J bra, so this would probably fit up to maybe a 36 DDD, if they're lucky. But the top is super duper cute, and the material feels really nice and soft. I wish that I could order this stuff separately, but even for the money, I got an awesome solid high-waist bottom."
3.0,Nice design but wish you could fit more than 8 cards max or it has closing issues. Also a slot for cash instead of the outside of the wallet. I dont care for ppl seeing my cash.
3.0,I need to make some alterations at the waist because it'not even.otherwise it's a nice dress.
3.0,Waaaay Too big. but Quality was good.
3.0,it's comfy but my daughters told me to never wear it and they told me it is see through. Probably best used for swim cover up.
3.0,It was cute and made of a nice enough material for the price. But the lack of a size chart made this a bad purchase. I typically wear a 6-8 so ordered the same size I get most everything else in. I couldn't even get the zipper halfway up. I'm not sure they make this big enough to fit even me.
3.0,"Nothing. I little to small for a 35mm, but a still like it."
3.0,It's a pretty nice outfit.  The material is a little uncomfortable.  It's not stretchy. It's stiff.
3.0,"Nice design, but the leather texture is flocked on, it's not going to look as light if you ever do a leather treatment to take care of it."
3.0,The backs unscrewed within a day
3.0,"Pretty, but not particularly comfortable."
3.0,It broke twice - love the style but I can't wear it without it breaking
3.0,It didn't have the new bathing suit plastic safety sticker. Looked worn.
3.0,"The top was pretty, and had a nice Renaissance feel, But the texture was a little scratchy and felt cheap"
3.0,"They were too small; Weighing in at 115lbs and 27"" waist."
3.0,"I have the Colosseum Active Chloe Sweatshirt in the “Black” color option. The color is actually a very dark gray.<br /><br />There’s no size chart, so I took a gamble on the sizing. I usually wear a size medium in women’s (34A, 5’5”), but I went with a size large for this sweatshirt. I’m happy I did, because a medium would have been too small. As it is, whenever I cross my arms, I feel the sweatshirt pull at the back.<br /><br />I can just fit a tight t-shirt underneath the sweatshirt and it’s not baggy or too big on me. The neck comes far down on my collarbones and the sleeves are almost too short.<br /><br />I laid the sweatshirt flat and measured from armpit to armpit, the half chest measurement is 23 inches. I measured after washing on gentle cycle and line drying, I haven’t put the sweatshirt in the dryer.<br /><br />The sweatshirt is lightweight. The only branding is an embroidered heart just above the left wrist cuff. On the black sweatshirt, the embroidered heart is the same color. The sweatshirt is made in China."
3.0,The kens popped out of the blue pair because the frame snapped. The black pair fit perfectly though and I love them. Recommend
3.0,"This is not a sweater, it is a long sleeve t-shirt. To expensive for a tee."
3.0,Beware tall girls! This is extremely short!
3.0,They were actually the wrong size. I emailed the one provided on D Exceeds website and have yet to get a response. LOVE the rings. I just wish they fit my fingers.
3.0,It's really cute! It was too small for my older child who I originally bought it for so I will save of for my 1yo to grow into. The headpiece was a tad small as well.
3.0,"I wanted this to work for me so bad! I got the M/L and am a 34C/D. The fabric is so soft and it was nicely made. Unfortunately the size was TOO SMALL. I mean ridiculously small. I had breast reduction surgery about a year ago and I wanted something without any underwire. The straps were comfortable but the cups were very tiny. It looked silly on, I was spilling out everywhere and it was totally unwearable. I am really heartbroken because I bought like 4 of these. I really, really think they are super cute, they just didn't fit my bust."
3.0,"are good , but not for wear all day."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this. I ordered in black/white stripe and blue stripe because I was indecisive on color. I am normally always a size 8 but based on reviews, ordered both in a size 10. Both were still too small. I suppose I should have considered that it is SPANX brand. The material is incredibly nice, the suit has a good quality feel to it.  The tummy has a spanx tummy control, the cups are thicker sewn in permanent padding. The suit is very nice and nice quality, the retail sticker has it listed for $142."
3.0,I like the hat but it too small .
3.0,"I really like the looks of this earring which is ultimately why I spent the $$ to buy it. I’m only giving it 3 stars because the back of the earring doesn’t “lock” and I lost it shortly after I bought it. Also, the metal is quite weak and bends very easily. I’ve only had the earring 2-3 mos and it feels like it’s goimg to break anytime. $13 for 1 earring that feels like it’s going to break in such short time and no locking back is irritating."
3.0,Cute accessories but the gold chains made it look cheap
3.0,Very tight at top
3.0,"These were not for me. When I pulled them out of the package they were so small I thought that they would never fit. Well, they are really stretchy so they fit nicely and I thought that I was going to love them. But they would end up sliding down and I was having to pull them up throughput the day so I finally gave up and am going to see if my daughter wants them.<br />I am 48 years old and 5'4&#34; and 160lbs. I don't know if any of that made a difference or not but these I will not purchase again for myself. They were quite pretty otherwise."
3.0,It certainly is a hat
3.0,"it looks like knitted, but it is synthetic"
3.0,I haven’t used them yet. They appear easy to use. I bought them to put in my sunglasses when I’m on the boat/ Jet skis
3.0,"To be fair, I have wide calves. But...they need one additional size bigger for people who aren't super skinny. I wanted compression for when flying on planes, not a total loss of circulation. I am not thin, but I am not obese either. These are just too tight."
3.0,The fabric was an odd blend. It was uncomfortable.
3.0,Nice fabric but fitting little big
3.0,"It's a good shirt, but the buttons are to big.  They make weird clink sounds when I walk, and they just get in the way.  I ended up removing the buttons and I like the shirt a lot better."
3.0,This wasn't a very functional piece to my Halloween costume.  I ended up taking it off after a while.  Just too big.
3.0,Fits great. Lightweight but slightly see through.
3.0,I had this tailored for my wedding but minus 2 stars because the straps on the back are hideous... paid the tailor to cut them off.
3.0,"This dress is made of very cheap material. It's very thin, flimsy, and plasticy. Kind of what you expect for this price though.  The sloth images were good at least."
3.0,I would not purchase these shorts bc if they end up fitting poorly it will cost you more than double the cost of the shorts to return them. Maybe this was clearly indicated on the site but I failed to make note of it. Now I have 2 pairs of shorts that don’t fit and will be stuck with them since I refuse to pay $50 to return them to China.
3.0,They're Great! Just what I expected but one had the metal nose pinch on the bottom of the mask.
3.0,I wasn't a fan of how light the color and the cost is a bit higher than other stores.
3.0,"The cups were a lot smaller than expected.  I usually don't have a problem with my bra size, but I was spilling out of these.  So go a cup bigger than you should."
3.0,Cheaper material than I was expecting BUT it was the perfect look for my photo shoot. :D
3.0,"Beautiful necklace, but broken when it arrived just like everyone elses. Luckily the 2 connector circles were still in the package and I was able to re connect the pieces with some needle nose pliers."
3.0,"This is super cute in pictures and I wear the shorts frequently but I wear a 34 L in bras and the bra is super small on me, which I expected. I gave this 3 stars because the straps on the bra are super low quality and if your boobs carry any type of weight, you will have pull out your inner seamstress and reinforce the straps somehow. The adjusters on the straps just slide down if they have to hold anything up."
3.0,The pants are quite comfortable and fit well. Was sad to see that two zippers broke the first time I wore them.
3.0,"It's a comfy dress, just fits a little smaller than expected."
3.0,For a Large it is definitely too small and it has these weird wiring things in front. Just feels tight but I still kept it
3.0,The teal color as shown in the photo is most definitely green. Disappointed that it's not teal. Not a fan of green but it will work.
3.0,"My wife ordered this as a bridesmaid dress.  We had success in the past ordering dresses on line, but this one did not work out.  The dress was a little large and the material was a little stiff."
3.0,They were soft but too short for me. I got a large and I am 5'8&#34; and they looked like high waters on me!
3.0,"This suit fit me really weirdly.  I'm 5'9&#34;, around 160lbs, about 10-12 US, 34DDD, and based on reviews I ordered an XL.  Surprisingly, it was too long/tall.  If I pulled it up to where it felt it was supposed to be, the bra came above my breasts.  If I wore the bra in the proper place, the lace sagged.  The bra itself, however, was too small, and did not cover me up.  Had to return.  Shame; it's a really cute suit."
3.0,"This suit is very cute! However, the top was too small...while the bottoms were too big. I typically am a solid Medium...yet to make this suit work I would have needed a small in the bottom and a large in the top.  Would love for there to be an option to purchase each item separately!"
3.0,"I really wanted to like this piece, but it looks and feels very plastic. I'm not sure why, but it is not as big as it is seen in the photo. Maybe it is due to the model's longer neck. This necklace is definitely more of a costume piece that one can wear for a play, for a costume party, or for Halloween. Definitely not elegant affair event. I would rate it a 5 if it was titled &#34;costume&#34;."
3.0,"Same as the above review, I like the glasses but the wind makes your eyes water like crazy, making it hard to see and ride. They do look cool though.."
3.0,The corset material is thin with weak boning. The image on the corset is nice. The frill around the borders is sewn well. I'm 34DD and I was able to wrap it around another corset that had better boning for better support. This corset did not come with a tie for the back. I had to use ribbon from another corset to tie up the back.
3.0,Chains were falling off and breaking on 1st try on... im mad
3.0,This belt is ok for the money. Doesn't strike me as top quality and I am not sure it is 100% leather. It does have a rather drab dark brown color. Time will tell how well it holds up to usage.
3.0,not proportionate
3.0,The rope is too loose and can’t make it on the head😂
3.0,Looks nice but you should offer a 71/4 or 71/2 sizes or a link would be nice.
3.0,"Diaper free fit for a petite 2YO<br /><br />12-18 month was too large so I ordered the 6-12 month but ITS THE SAME EXACT SIZE AS THE 6-12m.<br /><br />I have contacted to company for a resolution ave will update after their response.<br /><br />I have this 3 stars bc other than the fit issue the swim bottoms are fine. Good material, cute pattern."
3.0,I really wanted to love these swim bottoms but I found them to be a bit of the large size and not having much tummy control at all. They are high waisted which I do like as I can wear them with any tankini top but the fit is a bit loose and the rear panel is quite thin so not something I would wear to a public pool or beach but they are fine for backyard swimming.
3.0,"Missing pin on one side. Good product, especially for the price. However, this is not an exercising band, since the leather collects odors like nothing else and this makes the band unwearable after a while."
3.0,"True to size and soft cotton. Doesn't look vintage like the pic shows. Not a very good screen print on the shirt, looks cheaply made."
3.0,This dress is huge! I bought a large and I normally wear one but I’m drowning in it. It’s also a lot longer than I wanted it to be.<br /><br />Update: I ordered this in a large and sent it back bc it was huge. I ordered it bc I normally wear a large. I saw that this dress was on sale so I ordered it again in a small and it fits perfectly!
3.0,"I have been looking for a pair of black overalls and these will just have to work. Bought a different pair on Amazon and returned them because they were too big in the wrong places. These are ok. The construction is cheap, one of the buttons to connect the suspenders fell off immediately and I just keep putting it back on, hoping it stays. The material is lightweight. For reference I'm about 5'9 and 140lbs. They fit comfortably. Super hard to find overalls for tall people!"
3.0,Fits was a little on the small side. Good shoe for doing errands in while wearing a tunic and leggings.
3.0,Loved these shoes bought my daughter's current size but they didn't fit. It runs small. I am disappointed because it was part of her birthday present.
3.0,"Por ahora estoy conforme con el producto, aunque me sorprende que la marca sea &#34;CARNIVAL&#34;. mI intención fue comprar un &#34;LUMINOX&#34;"
3.0,"I collect a lot of different type Baseball Caps, but this particular one was not to my liking at all. Apparently, this Cap was pre-washed to create a certain look, but the process left streaks and uneven color throughout the Cap, which just wasn't very appealing to me, so I returned the Item. My refund was processed very quickly, so I was thankful for that part anyway!"
3.0,It has nice material but you should defiantly size up and it looks just like the picture.
3.0,"The elastic isn't very strong and the clasp is very VERY simple... I had to bend the &#34;hook&#34; a bit to make it clasp more securely.<br />However, it was very inexpensive so I'm not complaining."
3.0,"These are cute. I have a daughter who got one from a friend... it broke after daily wear. Purchased these to replace it. Tarnished over the month and broke again.<br /><br />Not terribly durable, but not terribly expensive so I didn’t expect too much."
3.0,I purchased this product as a gift for a friend. On the product description it states 925 sterling silver and the picture shows a product with a 925 stamp on the back of the earrings. The product that I received does not looks like sterling silver nor the earrings had the 925 stamp. I’ll return them I also requested an exchange in hope to receive the described product because my friend loves the way they look but not the quality. I’ll let you know how it goes.
3.0,I wanted to live this dress but it was ill fitting on my and terribly unflattering. I'm pear shaped and would not recommend it for pear shaped women. Cute fabric and design though.
3.0,"Didn't fit as expected, returned and didn't get a bigger size."
3.0,"I wear size XL in Oxiuly. However, this particular  dress was so loose fitting that it needed adjustments. I should have purchased, instead, the large (I wear Marycraft size 12; and size 10 in Julian Taylor as well as Gabby Skye)."
3.0,I love the way this fits! It looks so cute on but it’s thin and see through. I just wear a cami tank and spandex shorts under and it solves the problem. It would make a cute bathing suit cover up as well.
3.0,"The quality of the material is really nice. It doesn't fit my watch though because it's so thick and the posts seem too short. I tried to trim it to no avail so can't return it. The watch band itself though is really nice, if only I could use it."
3.0,Nice workmanship but right now stuck on my finger!
3.0,"This sweatshirt is probably not American sized. It’s way smaller than a russel athletics official collegiate hoodie that I just ordered from Amazon. After washing this hoodie, it shrank. My son is 6’, 210lbs and fits the russel athletic xl hoodie perfectly, but this shirt is more like a women’s large.  Also the printed logo is faint and anything but vibrant. Looks worn already. Gave it three stars only because it now fits me, not my son."
3.0,"The inner card slots aren't individual, they all end up in the same spot. It also doesn't unzip as it should or all the way. It's cute though"
3.0,"Cute, but runs a little small and is see through."
3.0,"Too large, might be better with socks on."
3.0,It was a little short but still cute
3.0,"Nice jeans, good quality but I only gave 3 stars because I ordered a 'Petite' and the jeans was still really long"
3.0,"Beautiful but heavy. I generally wear studs, so the contrast with these I couldn’t deal with. Also, when I turned my head I could hear them tinkling. I couldn’t make it through a whole work day with them in. Maybe it’s something I just need to get used to."
3.0,I think I have a large head so it's a little tight but it would probably perfect on most people. It's a cute hat.
3.0,Not as soft and comfortable as we'd hoped. Bought this as a gift for my wife. They are nice looking but the material is the Chinese version of material that isn't as soft. Would be too uncomfortable against my wife's skin. We purchased the large (she is a medium) as she prefers her jammies to be a little roomy. Appears to be true to size. Returning!
3.0,I ordered a 12/14 track suit for my son and it fits lime a 10/12 this will only fit him for maybe a month
3.0,Well made product but it's very small. I normally wear a small and that's what I bought but these fit like an extra small or smaller. I can squeeze in them but they aren't very comfy. Would be super cute if they fit tho.
3.0,"Thin and shimmery.  I usually wear a small but since this seemed like it was going to be on the cheap side I ordered up to a medium.  Glad I did as I don't like my tops too clingy for the office.  The fabric does have a sheen so if you are looking for a flat cotton, this is not it.  Fabric is also very thin.  I want to make sure I wear a heavy t-shirt bra.  I am not going to complain for the price $14, but I only see getting one season out of these because they don't look like they would hold up to machine washing.  I'll likely wash these by hand.  I ordered several colors on my first order, but based on what I received I decided not to order any additional colors."
3.0,The color on the small gems are more brown than purple. If I had seen the color clearly in the pictures I would not have purchased it.
3.0,"Not Yellow. I ordered yellow and when it came it was more orange. Also, the size was a little small. So order larger than you need and if you want yellow, don't choose this."
3.0,"Great shirt for the price, I should have bought more since it does show wear after a few washings."
3.0,"This hat is too large - goes over my ears. I also didn't think it looked particularly stylish. If it hadn't been so large for me, I probably still wouldn't have kept it."
3.0,"Arms were shaped a bit odd, but I loved the print.  Fabric was soft enough, print is a bit stiff."
3.0,"I love this product. However, the grey capris run smaller than all the other colors (green, red, dark blue, light blue, and black). I received one pair of the grey capris from a single order and one from a group order. Thinking one was just a bad fit, i gave the grey a second try but that color runs small/ tight. From a set of 3 pants, the blue and black fit well, but again the grey is smaller and tighter."
3.0,"Nice vest, fits well, but already has a small rip on the seam after only two or three uses."
3.0,Very small. Gave to my daughter.
3.0,I thought it would be bigger small delicate but beautiful
3.0,"I'm 5'6&#34;, 130 lbs, 34d. I bought a medium. Liked the top. Hated the bottoms. Love the top so much, I kept it.  The top barely holds the 'girls' in. I do have to make adjustments from time to time.  The bottoms were HUGE. Thank goodness I have a plain black bottom from another suit"
3.0,This product is light and flimsy but what do you expect for the price?  I have a couple of readers throughout my apartment. These are perfect. I’m not going to take them to a ball but they are pretty and stylish. I think I'll keep it.
3.0,A bit disappointed in overall quality.  Realized i was not buying a top of the line item but still surprisingly low end.  Drop in Walmart and get the same quality for half the price.
3.0,I really like how sturdy they are only thing was the one for my son fit him too tight probably a good size for like a 3 year old. Good thing my son doesn’t mind it so much lol my son is 5 btw
3.0,Clingy fabric. Very hot. It’s a beautiful style. Just not a good fabric.
3.0,"Over all, not bad photo-chromatic sunglasses, although they are slow to change both ways.<br />They are not polarized, you can tell by the small picture they include with the sunglasses and by comparing them to actual polarized sunglasses. I may keep them for the large size which I wanted to block wind on bicycles and motorcycles"
3.0,Has a hole after wearing twice :(
3.0,It fits a much bigger person if your smaller size do not order this i had to give it to my friend shes bigger than i am and it fit her well so im reviewing it based on that and i ordered a small
3.0,"The earrings are so pretty and they look hand made. They are so light weight, I was worried they would heavy. The only thing was I wish they would have packaged it differently because they came a bit squished which ripped an earring a bit but its an easy fix. Overall pretty pleased with the quality and price.<br /><br />Edit: I wore one of the pairs of earrings that I had not yet worn the other day for the first time and after a few minutes it broke!"
3.0,Fits as expected. Bought it for my wife and I think it looks good however the material is thin therefore it shows all of your curves. She's a little self conscious to wear it right now until she gets in better shape.
3.0,"Definitely size up. I'm pretty busy and the shirt almost doesn't button, luckily there is a stretch to it. The shorts are mostly comfortable except for the ribbon around the thighs, there is no stretch or give in them. They are soft and affordable. I'm '5""3 215lb normally wear a 2XL, I ordered a 2X and wished it was slightly bigger."
3.0,I have this 3 stars becomes the sizing was WAY OFF. I don't know what collaboration of women sizes thus was made for but not for a mere human as myself. I ordered a large because based on the sizing chart I thought it was best. It arrived on time and it was beautiful! . However the top was so small it did not even cover my nipples and the bottom was so huge it looked like boxer shorts! I think think the suit was mis matched because there was no way these sizes were paired yo match each other.
3.0,I was hoping that these were just like the multi colored ones that I bought but they are smaller and the ear loop does not have an adjuster on it
3.0,muy pequeña pedir un número más frande
3.0,"looks very cute. but quality isn't so great. Glass part isn't glass, and feels like it will pop out any second. won't buy it again"
3.0,"The grey pair had a huge hole in the right pocket! They’re not very comfortable, I keep having to pull them up and they made my underwear keep bunching and I was constantly having to fix. Wouldn’t buy again. Would not recommend"
3.0,"Good lenses but the soft plastic around the bows wear of too easily leaving hard, uneven plastic pushing against your skull."
3.0,"I have been searching for a new wrap for more than a year and had a hard time finding one. I didn't want strapless so that made it even harder to find one. This one is OK, but not great. The straps fall off my shoulders, even on the smallest setting and the wrap itself fits best if I don't fasten it all the way. So, around my body, it's a little too small, but the straps are too big. It serves its purpose, but I wouldn't buy this particular one again."
3.0,There's some white in the design I purchased. Unfortunately that part of the fabric is sheer. I thought the flowers would be a safe choice :/ a bit disappointing because I hate wearing leggings or slips with dresses.
3.0,"I used it... I used it correctly.. But somehow the snot(i know gross) did not go in the little cup provided and it like seeped in a crease you can't clean. So now the suction isn't as good when I first got it. It got the job done when the suction worked properly. But after two uses, it is now in the box.. :/"
3.0,ok but you pay for it
3.0,"My husband wanted this watch, he thought it was exactly what he wanted, but it turned out it had an expansion band and he can't stand that kind, he wants a loose fitting bracelet type band, so we had to return.  The watch itself is great."
3.0,Bought to wear to a casual wedding. Kinda felt that it made me look wide but that’s probably me and not the dress. Excellent quality for the price; honestly good quality in general. I’m 5’ 8” and 210 lbs and large breasted if that helps anyone figure out their sizing; I ordered a size xl. I did wear a spanx jumper underneath and that helped a lot.
3.0,Super comfortable but you can see through them if you bend over so I don't recommend them for lifting weights. They also slide down if you run in them so they are best for just casual wear.
3.0,Pretty..put I have big boobs..so its alittle tight
3.0,"it runs very, very small"
3.0,"I love the style of the dress. The fabric is very nice. Quality. The dress was very large on me.  I followed the size guidelines, but I should have ordered a size down, but it is no longer available."
3.0,"Cute but it made me go cross-eyed every time I wore it. My eyes kept straining because of that. I'm sure it has something to do with the design of the lens, its very wide and angled in a weird way. I have another pair of glasses with the same prescription that doesn't give me the cross-eyed effect, so it has nothing to do with the prescription."
3.0,"Large canvas bag---served its purpose for hauling a large item in checked baggage. No frills, just a bag. Kinda like ones you might from a street vendor on Pier 39 or from some guy on a corner in New York. Basic, did its job, no complaints."
3.0,The posts are a little thick.  And the ones with gold tone turned black in my ear the first day I wore them.
3.0,I thought the material was too flimsy for my taste so I returned it with no problem.
3.0,I really loved this shirt but needed the next size up and they didn't offer it. I would have totally bought the other size of it was available.
3.0,"Updates my review below…2nd order was really disappointing.<br /><br />These rocks are some of the best I have purchased! They are uniform is size, and the quality is high for all the rocks you received. (Some I have purchased from Amazon have been really varied in the quality within the one shipment.) They are coated in some kind of white powdery material, which I chose to wash off before painting my rocks. My 87-year-old mother has loved using them, too! I've included a photo. The little rocks are those that were found outside on my property. The bigger ones are from this set of rocks.<br /><br />I’m updating my review as I ordered another set and was disappointed. Two of the 10 rocks are below quality and one is really bad. (There is a big chunk out of the rock.) Disappointed that the rocks were inconsistent in quality especially after writing such a glowing review."
3.0,"My daughter always complains about sweaty feet, so these thin socks looked like a good option.  They run small and there is a waffling pattern that she doesn't like when she takes them off her feet.  Buy larger than expected and I think they'd be great."
3.0,Not as warm as I expected. Has a strong odor of water repellent or something.
3.0,The shape of this shirt is weird.  It’s ok but I def do not love it
3.0,Its beautiful but it did not set on my neck the way I thought it would so I returned it.
3.0,Just got it ill let you know
3.0,Product is very thin.  I had gotten it for my granddaughter.  Will need a slip underneath.  Not the best made product and not the worst.
3.0,"I have very sensitive skin so my only complaint is the acrylic material used in this sweater is a bit scratchy against my skin.  When I wear long sleeve tops then I have no problem with it and it looks very nice on. For me personally, I prefer the opening to wrap around me not just be open in the front. I guess I could have gone a size larger but then the sleeves would have been too long and it would have looked very slouchy. Just depends on what you are looking for."
3.0,"Well fitting with lots of pockets – though some are too small to be useful. Better quality control (""QC"") before shipping should have noticed and corrected one seam that didn't close. Hence the one star rate reduction. Now I have to find a local seamstress to close the gap."
3.0,The material is kinda stretchy and writing will wear off quickly...not bad for the price tho
3.0,"Prettily strung and presented pearls. Be sure to order them large enough millimeters for your taste. Quality is fine for early on in life, or early on in pearl buying."
3.0,I really like this brand and have an adult pair of my own. These look great and are warm. My kid has been tough on them and they looked nice for about two days. Now they still look ok but the sole began separating from the boot. A little shooe goo fixed them right up. Great boot but not durable enough for playground play. If you don’t expect your child to be to rough on them I think they are a good buy.
3.0,"This shirt pretty much fits me like it fits the model.  It's fitted, but not super tight.  The fabric is light weight and stretchy.  I have a small chest, so the buttons go down past my chest and kind of push down the fabric.  It looks a little weird.  It came out of the wash ready to wear."
3.0,Thought I may be able to use these over a helmet but did not work out. Band is not long enough.<br />I have not tested product durability as of yet but they appear to offer protection.
3.0,After wearing for a few hours the pin broke right off the earring
3.0,"I love how it looks and the idea, it's very unusual. I don't like that it passed quality control. Mine has a huge smudge on where the word is and I don't understand how this was not noticed. This should not have been sent out at all. It's not something I can fix as the glass doesn't come off. 5 stars if I had got one that wasn't defective."
3.0,I'm used to high heels but these are different. I felt as though every time I tried to step the heel was going to snap off. They don't feel sturdy.
3.0,its cute the material is soft just runs little large
3.0,"Bought for my grand daughter, she is kind of between sizes 8-10 so i bought size 10 which ended up way to big, but returning was more a hustle so we just kept it"
3.0,dont like the cotton
3.0,Pretty but the material seems a little cheap. And runs pretty big.
3.0,This bomber was pretty stylish but it did not really meet my expectations. I have a skinny frame and this fitted me a bit larger than I expected. The only good thing was that the product matched the picture but other than that I ended up returning.
3.0,I like the design and shape of this top but the fabric is poor quality. Would not have bought it if I'd have known and it's too late to return it now.
3.0,"cute but no comfort in these, and they run narrow"
3.0,The idea of this product is great but you can see where the shirt ends under most clothing so you can tell that it says fake short shirt underneath. It's not very comfortable but I decided to keep it and try it out with a couple more options. overall if you're a small girl this may work but if you have a larger chest the fit isn't the best.
3.0,Did not attract many mosquitoes but bands itself were very loose comparing other similar product I had previously bought. Definitely a low quality.
3.0,Very flimsy lost my keys costed me $400 smh cute tho lol
3.0,Baggier than picture and the material is rough.
3.0,"This shirt is beautiful. A few details were different than the picture but I expected that, the shirt was a little big but again it is beautiful."
3.0,Fit a little small.
3.0,Size bigger than wat I expected.  Order a xl n it fit like xxxl. Nothing like no 3D
3.0,"I’ve bought a number of these styles of rayon pants recently including from the same brand. Most are delightfully soft and somewhat thin fabric. I have touch sensitivity so that’s exactly what I need. Although made in the same place out of the same material by the same people, these are much heavier, stiffer, and scratchy. For someone else this might be a positive but for me it’s a negative."
3.0,"They look nothing like the photo they have a orange color to them.  Too warm for hot days, the sweat causes whatever dye was used to stain your hands otherwise fine. More durable than pigskin but I haven't tested them against cows hide. Reminds me of a dear skin glove in the way it grips your hand, not as flexible but has the secure felling. More flexible than cows hide thicker too. the elastic in the cuff could be better was sewn poorly and tend to be irritating"
3.0,"Shipping was fast. Material is very thin, which I don’t mind but they def run small. My advice is to order one size larger than you normally would"
3.0,"This is a soft, casual, 100% cotton long-sleeved shirt. The white/light top stitching isn't subtle at all and there's a lot of it, so hopefully, that's the look that you like. It looks sewn well, but I've not washed it yet. The large fits my son loosely, as it's not a fitted or slim fit, and the sleeved are long enough for easy movement. Without a pleat in the back, you need a looser cut for comfort. It will probably shrink at least a little, but the fabric does have some give as it's woven and thin. It needs to be removed promptly from the dryer and then will probably need at least a light ironing to look nice.<br /><br />I'm rating it three and a half stars. If it washes and wears well, I may up that."
3.0,"Not a very comfortable cap, the fit is odd."
3.0,I used the 24&#34; luggage once a week after I got the set and I picked it up in the baggage pickup with 2 broken off feet and all scratched up so it isn't as scratch resistant as the as claims.
3.0,For the price its not terrible but cheep and from China.
3.0,The jeans are just okay. I washed them before letting my son wear them and when I took them out of the drier they kind of had an industrial chemically smell but the smell went away. I think the smell was coming from the zippers.
3.0,The hat is great and well made except for the plastic clicking piece on the band that you use to tightening the hat doesn't fit well together.
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, but runs small and is long.."
3.0,Don’t stretch. Not compression at all. Weirdly cut. Did not like at all!
3.0,"The string broke on this bracelet. I have a very small wrist 5 inches, and small hands.  So, the size of my hand and wrist was not an issue. But, the construction of this bracelet was defective. I really like the bracelet. Only had an opportunity to wear it for a week. SAD 😭<br />NedraA"
3.0,"Pretty cute and comfy summer dress, very soft fabric with a nice drape. It is a bit short though, on my 5'5"" frame.<br />Also... The seam is in the front and the pattern isn't matched so it's fairly obvious. Would be better if the seam was in the back."
3.0,The bag was a nice color and had a lot of storage space and organization.  The down side is that my bag arrived dented (I ordered directly from Samsonite).  Samsonite customer service is horrible.  After 7 phone calls and countless emails and chats I have decided to return not only the damaged bag but the other two I ordered as well. Samsonite does not stand behind their products. I would not recommend.
3.0,Fit good but not really the heather grey like the photo more of a light brown in color.
3.0,The costume is beautiful but I had to be very careful to avoid tripping during a Halloween event.
3.0,"For some reason, these bother my ears, but they are very lovely to look at."
3.0,Ivory is see through but quality is good. I ordered a black pair and they are just right. Size is pretty spot on.
3.0,Seems okay. The watch band is cheap so I replaced it. Looks like the IWC Top Gun watch but it is smaller than stated on my order (42 instead of 45). I would have preferred a larger watch.
3.0,Doesnt hold a charge long
3.0,"I like the boots but the color is not what I expected. They appeared in the catalog to be as described, Winter White, a cream color. When they arrived they were stark white. Not returning because I'll come up with some outfits to wear them with. Still searching for a true Winter White boot."
3.0,"Welp, the intent of this purchase was to wear to work. Honestly? I prefer this as a nightgown/pajamas. It’s thin and showed every crack and crevice outline despite spanxs. At 5’3, I could have worn stilettos and it was still dragging past the ground. So I cut about a foot off and it’s now comfortable sleepwear. Yes I could have returned it, but I liked the material."
3.0,The top is small and the bottoms are cut funny. Cant tell front from back.
3.0,"it fits well.  I usually go for a more tight fit, so I will find  way to make it work.  If you are not someone that likes to have your close sit a little snug on you, then this is not the product for you.  I am sure that it is will shrink once I wash it, as soon as it does, I will come back and update this review, but like I said, if you do not might a little Schmedium action, then go ahead and buy one of these.  I am 6-1 and about 190.  went with a Large."
3.0,"I like the style and comfort, but after 2 washes the print in some areas is rubbing off leaving the area looking white/worn."
3.0,Good purse but handles tear easily
3.0,"Picture doesn’t show how evident the stain is, but I opened the package to find the shirt strangely stained with big and green neon streaks. Disappointed because I was really excited for this shirt, but I like it otherwise"
3.0,Fits great. Form is good but I hate that it's Shiny.
3.0,NOT TERRIBLE. DECENT FOR PRICE
3.0,"Beautiful earrings; however, had to return them because the backing to one of them wasn't sturdy/straight enough so it looked like it was going to fall of my sister's ear. Seller was quick to refund money."
3.0,"The shoe itself,  looked great but the size was so much smaller in length and width that I would not know how to order the right size."
3.0,Ran very small.  Could not wear them
3.0,The charm was larger than I expected.
3.0,"The dress fits fine, and despite being a light color is not see through. My one complain is the material does feel quite thin and cheap, however again it is not see through, which shocked me. Overall, dress is cute, but feels cheap for the price."
3.0,"somewhat small, but i can work with it"
3.0,"Tiny. Very very tiny. Itty bitty. But still pretty. I failed to read the specks on them before I ordered them. Oops, my bad!"
3.0,"It fits okay -- I sized up, and it's still plenty tight. Wore it as an extra ""no belly showing"" layer for yoga, and I could feel myself overheating in it. It's just the polyester, I guess. I may order more cotton instead."
3.0,"it's is comfy and warm, but was not the color that I needed AND it came later than promised."
3.0,It is a nice fitting shirt and really cute on! One downside is after I washed it it was so wrinkly I had to iron it twice to get it to look nice again.
3.0,I ordered the pink and the color was darker than pictured. They were somewhat see-through and there seemed to be extra fabric which caused some bunching in the crotch area. I returned them.
3.0,Not a fan…it was an odd fit. Kinda frumpy yet way too low of a neckline. Also the color is off. I ordered wine red which looks more burgundy in the picture but is definitely more red.
3.0,"Lovely little wristlet, well made and perfect for what I wanted. The color is fantastic. The reason I docked it two stars is the zipper looks great but snags on itself constantly and the fishy odor of the bag itself is nearly unbearable. I've even drowned to drown the smell with patchouli to no avail. I guess it has to wear off."
3.0,You are basically buying the jacket and bow tie. The Ascot does not stay in place and the mask is too thin to hold any kind of shape. I also had to safety pin the closure on the jacket to stop it from opening every time I moved.
3.0,"The clutch itself is pretty good. There is definitely room for sunglasses or odds and ends. The material seems durable. My biggest beef is that the magnetic clasp does not stay closed. The magnet is weak, and stuff I do put in drops out all the time. This is a serious pain. I was willing to put up with a larger wallet in order to be able to carry a few extras, but if I lose them all over, then it is not convenient."
3.0,Love the garment but not even close to size chart...
3.0,"I'm a big anime fan and so this was an impulse buy for my daughter who is also an anime fan and has even learned to speak Japanese very well. It is fairly well-made (but see my further comments below for clarification) and, as expected, fits on the small side so we ordered the XL (one size up) to compensate for the 9/10L Juniors my daughter usually wears.<br /><br />One of the first things she noticed while attempting to put it on is that the fabric is NOT stretchy... not at all! So, it took a little strategy in putting it on and she said that as she was trying to put it on she feared she would accidentally burst some of the seams. Fortunately, that did not happen.<br /><br />Overall, it was cute, the photos on the Amazon store are a bit deceiving in that you really can't tell what the material texture is and stretchability. Obviously, the skirt is a bit short, but what she also noticed was that the skirt was a different fabric that was shiny and seemed on the sheer side, despite the pleats, so parents be aware of this and anyone who decides to keep the garment may want to where it with a short skirt and/or opaque tights.<br /><br />Other than these issues, she says the overall appearance of this outfit is ""cute"" but not as comfy as it could be and the skirt material looked too ""halloweeny"" (aka cheap-looking). I didn't actually see it on her, but I trust her opinion. Your mileage may very, but keep in mind that you'll need to order a size or two up to even have a chance of putting it on.<br /><br />Too bad. It took about three weeks to get here from China and is not worth attempting to return so maybe it can be used to make a pattern off of for an outfit that corrects the negatives I've listed above. We find that home-made cosplay outfits, if done right, often yield better results anyway."
3.0,Cute ring for the price. Nice packaging
3.0,Suppose to be extra large was very small for size
3.0,"shirt fits small, shorts fit large"
3.0,PROS:<br />Shape is great and doesn't look too cheap from afar<br /><br />CONS:<br />I never thought I could say this but its actually overpriced. You can get this for $8 in chinatown. It also does have an unfortunate &#34;Korea&#34; stamp right on the outside.<br /><br />I'm going to keep it since it is the right size but meh.
3.0,really tight around the back of my ears--- super cute though
3.0,"They work-ish for the shoes I needed them for but the seams along the toes split the first time I was each pair. I have a surger so it takes me a few mins to fix them but if you're not equipped for that this may a disappointing purchase. Given the price, it's not unexpected or a bad deal"
3.0,I did not like it. Did not feel the support. I do not think this is meant for big size breast.
3.0,"Its Hughes but not made for my posture,the material looks too cheap am sorry! May that why its unavailable .....I guessed am stacked with piece of material"
3.0,these are kind of stiff
3.0,It's neither here nor there.  Its meh. The color isn't as posted. I purchased the khaki color and its this tan color with marbled black. The piping is a different color then the rest of the sweater (doesn't have the black marble color).  I'm going to keep it because I'm too lazy to return it.  Oh and there was no obvious smell to it.
3.0,A nice enough jacket but these come from China and run very small. I returned it. Know that their size chart is not accurate.
3.0,Took ages to arrive and was poorly printed. I'll wear it to sleep I suppose
3.0,"Gloves are good except they are way too big. The box says ages 4-10, but this is how they fit my 6-1/2 yo. I bent them at his fingertip. He doesn’t have small hands (for his age). They are a so big on my 4 yo he won’t wear them. The age should probably be 8-12."
3.0,"I like them but they aren't quite what I expected. They don't have much stretch to them at all, so don't be expecting these to fit like a cotton/spandex blend. I got the Bootcut Tall, which is normally perfect for me off the rack (34&#34; inseam). These are quite a bit longer than that, so I have to hem them.<br /><br />I was a little concerned about the XL (16-18) sizing as I am every bit an 18 in stretch jeans, but these are roomy enough in the seat and tummy. Nice fit in the waist, which is not a stretchy fabric either. It doesn't give any more than the rest of the pants, but, even with the drawstring done up pretty tight, there is no &#34;muffin top&#34; binding or pinching. They are snug in the upper thigh but then very loose from the knee down to the bootcut opening - which is 11&#34; wide. As another reviewer stated, they do get a bit baggy in the seat after having them on for awhile.<br /><br />All in all, I'm satisfied for wearing them for around the house, quick trips to the store & camping, But at this price, I don't think I'll be buying any more."
3.0,The color of the shirt is beautiful.<br /><br />The fabric is not very soft.<br /><br />The shirt is big and boxy.
3.0,The dress is cute and small fits 5'3 110 lbs. But the sleeves are cheaply made. The edges arent cut away properly and material is stiff
3.0,The watch was very nice however the battery died with-in a week of wearing it after it being sent to me.
3.0,"Overall these socks are comfortable but I can't get over the neon brightness of these socks. The pack I received contained three pairs - neon green, orange and pink. Even though the socks come up below the ankles, the top rim of the socks still can be seen with shoes on. The rim of neon brightness can be eye catching and that may not be a good thing. In addition, if the shoes are off, the socks stand out like a candle at night."
3.0,"Very cute dress and comfy, I’m normally a medium so I got that, fits like a L/XL… really upset it didn’t fit correctly! I would size down! The length was perfect for me I’m 5’8 and it skimmed the floor"
3.0,"I did expect that it wouldn't look as pictured, and it didn't. The collar and detail are barely there, and it isn't as fluffy as shown. This only pluses were the material being extremely  soft, the pockets are handy, length was perfect(as shown), and I accomplished the look I was going for with purchasing this. Oh! I almost forgot a huge plus which is the astonishing warmth from such a thin lined interior."
3.0,They are okay - should have ordered the next size larger.
3.0,"I bought a pair of these a few years ago and loved them. I ordered a new pair and these are smaller (width & length) than my old ones and made a little cheaper. Both sets I have are size 12, these new ones feel like a large 11 or 11.5 not a 12.. If you can try them on in a store I could recommend it."
3.0,The socks although cute are huge! I think these were made for big foot. When i put them on the part of the sock meant for the heel came up past my ankle.
3.0,"I love the snap jewelry and wanted solid color bands. These took a few weeks to arrive, and when they did I was really disappointed that I got two blue bands and no black, which is the one color I definitely wanted.  Plus, these bands are really stiff, so not very comfortable. Hopefully I can work the leather enough to loosen them up.  Just so bummed with the whole no black band issue. :(<br /><br />Note: If you have big wrists these may not work. Mine is about 7 1/2"" and I have to use the, second hole closest to the buckled end of the band."
3.0,"It is a nice jacket but it does run small. I am a med- large size person and the large fit just right, no extra room.  So order on the bid side to fit nicely. Tommy"
3.0,These are smaller then expected but I still wear them around the house to clean
3.0,Arm hole too big.  The dress was pretty!
3.0,Returned because at the largest size I couldn't even get over my head. Very very sheer
3.0,"Warm. Really thick, thicker than I expected. Easily snags on things like my ring and Velcro. Pockets are big and that works for me."
3.0,"Beautiful skirt and color in size S, but VERY short when worn at the waist like the picture. Granted, I'm taller at 5'9, but this skirt was about 5-6 inches off the ground and hit almost T-length on me. My mom who is 5'4&quot; even tried it on and it was still a couple inches from the ground.<br /><br />Picture can be pretty deceiving of the length. If you want it to look like the picture (floor length), you will probably need to be 5'2&quot; or less."
3.0,"Works good for chest, not as much for mid section. Kind of rough on armpit area and tends to roll up on your stomach, which is very annoying. Other than those issues, it is fine for a cheap alternative to more expensive shirts. Always buy a size smaller."
3.0,It does not fit an 8 year old. Way too big!
3.0,"Ok let me first start by saying that I was in the marketplace for a watch.  I probably would not have purchased this as a supplemental time piece because it is pricey.  I also wanted to start a charm bracelet so I was excited about this unique watch.  I researched it quite a bit before purchasing and it seemed like the right piece for me.  A watch is a highly personal item I think.  I couldn't find any consumer reviews for this on the Internet so that is why I'm taking the time to write about it.  I've had it for about 3 weeks now and it is lovely and really different than most other things out there.  I was apprehensive about the 30m water resistance because of washing hands, doing dishes, etc but so far I have had no issues with this.  It does have a pretty small face but that is to be expected b/c it is a ""bead"" for a bracelet.  I've gotten used to reading it though and don't mind the smallness.  Unfortunately I have run into a problem with one of the roman numerals mysteriously losing the black enamel.  Although customer service responded promptly, I was expected to pay shipping and insurance both ways to repair the enamel.  I was disappointed in that response given that I've only had it 3 weeks and makes me wonder what might happen to the rest of the black enamel in several months or years (my last ESQ watch lasted 17 years so I expect to wear it a long time).  The watch seems good quality other than that.  It is made of silver so expect the normal scratching that occurs with silver but the glass face is perfect.  Bottom line is this watch is not for everyone... I don't regret purchasing it - I do like it but I wish for a few things like 50m water resistance, better quality on the roman numeral enamel, and I wish for a bangle bracelet instead of a lobster clasp for easier removal.  I'll have to save up for that!  I gave it three stars because I am unsure of the long term durability and wishing that it was 50m resistant so if it gets submerged accidentally, it would be ok.  If you are considering this watch, I hope some of this helps."
3.0,Top is too tight and I have smaller busy size. I think if I ordered a larger size it would be too big on me. I gave it to my friend.
3.0,"For $18.99, I expected better quality. The material is very thin- almost the texture of tough chiffon. The fit was also very weird. I am 5' 2'' 140lbs. The fit across the chest was way too tight and then gathered up towards the neck. Also, these armholes were totally not proportional to the size of the dress. I would say just go up a size, but below the chest the rest of the fit was very baggy. I get that this is supposed to be a shift dress, but this was too baggy. Beautiful color though. Probably best for tall thin people with no muscles."
3.0,"Just ok, runs one size small or would have given 4 stars. A bit thinner material than I expected so not a winter thermal shirt like I wanted it for."
3.0,Thought i would wear with different color clothes.  Cheaply made.  Stem of glasses kept slipping out.  One broke.
3.0,I liked the idea of these but they tend to slip off if you have long hair. Pretty aggitating especially while you’re trying to workout.
3.0,Nice fabric etc. True fit or slightly larger. Hit me below knee at 5’ 6”. Waist seam just seems awkward. Should sit lower in my opinion. It’s affordable snd comfy so I’ll keep.
3.0,"I loved the print and the top is really cute. I didn't get to wear it, but the quality looked good.  The bottom was a different story. It made me look frumpy. It has nice coverage though. I think it would have looked better if I was more curvy."
3.0,"Items were received after the party which required having to alter some of the games.<br /><br />However, the items are of great quality and will be used for dress up ."
3.0,"Much smaller than I expected, too small for the 6-10 year olds at birthday party. But they are cute & seemed decent quality for price"
3.0,Runs small like 2 sizes too small. The medium looked like it was for a child.
3.0,Very beautiful ring. Shipment was fast. Unfortunately the ring did not fit. I ordered a size up but it still did not fit. Wish they had more size options. I would have to order two- three sizes up for it to fit correctly. Will give this ring to a friend.
3.0,"It is a very nice shirt, although the way the shirt is made and the way the collar in the back makes it seem the shirt was not in fact made to be backless.I rarely wear it. For that specific reason It also is not real lace."
3.0,Got them for a back up pair for fishing and outdoor stuff. Not pretty but they gett’er done
3.0,Well the necklace itself is about the size for maybe a 8 year olds neck. So for me as an adult it does not fit not even close. But it still is cool and much much smaller than I was expecting
3.0,It's a bit small but the fabric is of great quality. Won't last her the year though will have to buy bigger size by January.
3.0,"The ring, yes, is adjustable but the metal is really thin and it feels like it's going to snap so I don't want to wear it."
3.0,great gift item
3.0,they did not fit any of my heels but the real skinny ones which i dont have many of and rearly use. wish they came for a thicker heel.
3.0,Goes through batteries extremely fast. ...they are quite expensive too....
3.0,Nose rings are as good as they look online  very happy with purchase would recommend to a friend.
3.0,Overall does the job. Easy to apply. Had a small amount of leakage running down by one ear. 3.5 stars
3.0,"This is just an average snowsuit that doesn't offer anything special.  It's not terrible, but not good neither.  Let's start with the fit, it will runs small if comparing US size.  I typically wear Women's M for US clothing, and I got an XL to anticipate sizing discrepancies and that's what Amazon recommends as well, because you just can never tell what you're gonna get with these overseas order.  In hindsight, I think a L might be more form fitting though I feel it would restrict movements because the XL barely clears that threshold.  The XL as it stands is a little puffy and baggy.  Not too bad but doesn't look quite clean either, though it does offer more option for layering.<br /><br />As mentioned this is pretty barebones in terms of design.  No wrist or pants gaiters, no air vents, limited pockets, 4 outside, 2 of which lie on your forearms, and none inside.  It has a simple belt but it's not adjustable so it's just for esthetics.  It also has some simple optional suspenders that you can use.  What it doesn't have, and frankly a grave atrocity in my opinion, is a waist zipper.  This should be a mandatory design element in all snowsuits and onesies, period.  They either expect you to go all day without number one and two, or take off the suit half way and have it lay on the dirty restroom floors.  Neither option is acceptable.<br /><br />The material is once again average at best.  No waterproof or breathable ratings but I can expect it to not last very long, based on experience.  Overall, this suit slightly underwhelms.  For this price point, I'd look elsewhere."
3.0,The jacket looks nice but my husband is a Large and it was small for him and it took a long time to get here.
3.0,"I bought this since my old Army belt is too small.  I guess due to age my belly gotten little bigger.  My original Army belt is really nice.  Love the Army belt, US made buckle, hold tight, and never stretch like leather belts.  The one I bought has a thinner belt material and the buckle is more like it's a stamped steel type Made in Taiwan.  I chunked the stamped steel Made in Taiwan in the trash and kept the belt.  So far so good, will just have wait and see how long the belt material will hold."
3.0,made with very thin material should work in the summer/
3.0,"Product seller and shipping were OK, no issue there.<br />The problem I had was the the can only seemed ½ or ¾ full  when recieved (only a 5.5 oz can to begin with.)<br />First time ordering or using this brand/product, so I don't know if this is ""normal"" or ?<br />Cap was on, and no sign of ""something"" happening during shipping.<br />Two medium coats on 1 pair of new boots, and can is completely used up.<br />Long story short, not pleased with the value. Won't be ordering again."
3.0,ya me habían hecho la evolucion del dinero hace unos meses
3.0,"The first time I wore it, it broke :("
3.0,Needed a 3xxx im not over wieght but athletic build
3.0,Tight fitting and uncomfortable.
3.0,the sleeves are tighter than I would.like
3.0,In the pics this looks long and on me it was way to short. In all fairness I’m very long waisted.<br />The material wasn’t as soft and comfy as I thought it would but it’s cute as heck.
3.0,This is a little bigger brim than I would like. It hampers my vision.
3.0,I got tighter around my toes though so switch to different brand
3.0,Other such vest have a flap between the zipper and skin. This one doesn't. Depending on the activity that could be an issue. The zipper is rough and rubs. It also catches body hair. The overall quality is pretty good for the price. So far.
3.0,Nice cap. Warm but too small.
3.0,Wear them if it's really sunny and you don't need to look good.<br />I don't really like them.<br />Lenses too big.<br />Tried to give them away.<br />No one at work wanted them.
3.0,"I got a 40 pack for under 5 bucks.  I bought for my three kids who are 1.5, 4, and 6<br />I opened a couple packs to see if they liked them and within a couple hours, all 40 were in use.  All of the worked and the kids loved them.<br />We have used them on and off for a few days now and they seem to be holding up nicely considering how cheap they were.  The black stretchy bands have come off a few of them, but as long as you don't lose them, they go back together easily.<br /><br />Kinda wish I had bough another 40 for the cousins we are going out with on Halloween.<br /><br />edit 4/1/14:  Just wanted to let everyone know that we've only got a handful of these left after 18 months.  but the ones that are left still work.  I'm amazed how long the lights have lasted on these cheap things.  Would definitely buy again."
3.0,Average...as expected
3.0,This shoe ran small and was not as wide as other sandals w/same type of footbed. The Buckle rubs foot when you walk.
3.0,"Once wrapped on you, the velcro is very stiff and hard and pokes into your sides and or armpits."
3.0,"looks as advertised, but stitching is not very intricate and looks like it won't last.no lining of course.. if you're a curvy girl be careful, you may need a size up even though it's very stretchy. while the material stretches,i'd be surprised if the beginner sewing lasts beyond the first wash."
3.0,"These are larger than I expected which I’m upset about since I wanted smaller ones. They cracked easily have no idea how, but if you want big glasses buy these."
3.0,The shoes fit well and they were comfortable but they didn't quite look right and they were little I don't know how you'd say it boxey I guess around the toes. They weren't smooth or didn't look smooth
3.0,cute but too bulky for me. returned.
3.0,Way cute. Way smaller than anticipated though.
3.0,"good product just larger then i had hoped, the crouch/leg hole to big has to wear pants with them"
3.0,Runs small at xlarge for me 16 calves
3.0,"I though they were clip on, I hate this type of bow tie now I am stuck plus they send 2 of the same the ties are beautiful but<br />Now I have to buy the clips"
3.0,Nice simple blouse.. However not true to size and has no stretch.. I ordered XXXL and fits like US  L/XL. The gray color is lighter than the picture.
3.0,"Good quality item -- however it runs EXTREMELY small.  I ordered an XL, because of previous reviews, and it was too small.  I typically wear a 10 or 12 and ended up ordering an XXL which fits -- but is bad for my ego!"
3.0,No spot for coins. Material is plastic like. Doesn't feel great quality. But it does look like the photo
3.0,"I would not call this a sweater...the fabric is thin and slinky feeling, not knit. It is more of a fall/early spring top than a winter one. Not bad, but not what I hoped for."
3.0,Was not the material I expected. Had a strange fit to it. Looks nothing like the picture.
3.0,"Material and fit is great.  However; I wouldn't label it as a ""Panama"" hat, as the brim is not as large as a truss Panama hat. Knowing that, nice hat."
3.0,Cute but the antlers are way too small. Would be cute for a toddler I guess but what toddler would keep these in? Not mine.
3.0,"They are pretty, they're just really small. The picture showing the size comparison to the lady's ear is entirely incorrect. These are smaller than a dime."
3.0,it was ok but for the price say's it
3.0,"I like the clamp mechanism, it feels nice and sturdy, but the strap itself looks like of like something a PIMP would wear... I thought it was going to be all black... not look like someones shoes... but other than that it was pretty good."
3.0,To much shrinkage
3.0,They vacuum seal the bags so most of them arrive too squished to ever regain shape in the hand pumps
3.0,"I thought I didn't get the right item, but I found the item that I thought I was reviewing so will revisit this tomorrow"
3.0,Odd feeling material but fits ok.
3.0,"really cute design, but the cups ended up being smaller than i anticipated!"
3.0,Cute hat but extremely small
3.0,The material is a bit weird and it fits kinda big. I purchased a medium to fit my hips and bust but the bust of the dress is too big. I need for a function in two days or I would've returned it
3.0,Cute top but not as long as shown and xl was a little snug
3.0,"Thick plastic and narrow ""horn"" for the heal makes them a bit clumsy to use. Prefer metal."
3.0,"I’m 5’10”, around 165 and a medium fits well. May be a bit short, but nothing scandalous.<br />But the black fabric of the dress is straight up see-thru. You should plan to probably wear a tank top or bodysuit under the dress, unless you don’t mind being able to see skin through the material.<br />Still a good dress, just something to keep in mind when purchasing."
3.0,This suit runs small! Order 2 sizes up from what you normally order.
3.0,"I'm a size US 6 pants but have a slight tummy. According to size guide, I went with XL. The fit was perfect everywhere. Material was thin but the chest is not see through, you can get away without wearing a bra. The slip fit me perfectly at mid thigh, I am 5'4&#34;. The pattern was a little more drab than the photo but not too bad. Cons: there was deodorant marks on the dress when I took it out of the package and a hole on the side of the dress near the rib cage. The sleeves drape weird, they fall really low off the arms but you could easily snip and remove the sleeves and just have a nice spaghetti strap maxi. The back kind of bubbles up slightly as well, it's not a smooth fit.  Besidses the fact that my dress had deodorant and a hole in the seam, given that it was only $15, I'm going to keep it. I will hem the hole myself and probably raise the draped sleeve slightly."
3.0,3x. (THUS IS A CHILD BRA NOT ADULT
3.0,"The swimsuit fits great however the bottom doesn't look like the picture, which is why I'm not too satisfied. I do have extra bottoms I can wear instead as you can see in the picture, but I'd rather have new ones that I like since I paid for it. It would also be much better if there were some fringe on the back of the bra top but I think it's not too bad. Besides that the swimsuit is okay."
3.0,"The main reason for buying these pants was to get something long enough to fit my son, which they were. However, they are quite cheaply made, especially for the price. The other issue is they shrank a huge amount when we dried them; I'm guessing about 4-5&#34;. So, if you need the really long - we're talking basketball/volleyball player inseam - length to stay, do NOT dry them!"
3.0,Looks bigger
3.0,"A bit large, long arms but skinny between the shoulder and elbow makes it hard to bend elbow. Also took 4 months to receive."
3.0,"Wanted a small compact umbrella that is reliable, well made and reasonably priced"
3.0,Didn't include a wiping cloth like I received with my brown case from a different supplier.
3.0,Comes off father's feet too easily.
3.0,"Size is as stated, good price, however the two pieces do not match each other and does not look as pictured."
3.0,"It was a little smaller then I expected, but the color's beautiful!!"
3.0,I ordered the orange/red lenses for fishing in low light conditions (overcast). The lenses only appear orange/red from the front. When you look through them they are a dark charcoal gray. They work fine in bright sunlight but on cloudy days it's hard to spot fish.<br /><br />The frames are mediocre.
3.0,"Great boatneck t-shirt. However absolutely NOT off the shoulder as advertised.Fabric is great, comfy, love how the no sleeves barely cap at the shoulder!"
3.0,"I bought this specifically because the key fob ring to my car keeps breaking and I needed something to keep it in. I liked that I could see through to the key fob but what I found really annoying is the second compartment was not wide enough to carry credit cards, what the heck? And it was oddly shaped too thick yet not wide enough."
3.0,"I got a large in what was supposed to be army green. This coloring is nothing like the picture from Amazon so that was disappointing. The shirt is pretty comfy aside from the annoying elastic in the sleeves. The sleeves are far too long and the shirt doesn't look like the picture. It came poorly made with strings sticking out all over the place.<br />But for the cheap price, I guess it's a good shirt to wear during social distancing 🙄"
3.0,Fun and cute. Great for a party favor. Cheap quality.
3.0,Thinner more pjs than outdoor jogging suut
3.0,I like these but after wearing for just a week the jewels fell out and the material the balls are made of degraded badly. Put a clear topcoat of nail polish on the balls before wearing.
3.0,I ordered a size 7M but I received a size 6 left shoe and a size 7 right shoe...the right shoe fit perfectly. Too bad I have to return them.
3.0,The colors are not like the pictures. they are to big. the do look warm but i have to wait for my baby to grow into them.
3.0,"I had fit issues with this garment.  It was not what I’d expected,  I do not think it is necessarily the fault of the garment, but it just was not for me."
3.0,"My daughter has had these for a month now.  She is not rough on shoes, but these look horrible now.  The webbing is fuzzy and fraying.  Hopefully they will make it to the end of summer."
3.0,Cheap jewelry purchased cheaply. Think I paid $10 and would think its stretching it to say it looks even that expensive.
3.0,Very nice vest and well made.<br /><br />Runs at least a size small.
3.0,"Pants are comfy and very flexible with a hidden key pocket on the waist.<br />The color was true to the picture and arrived on time.<br />My only thing, ladies if you sweat a lot during workout these show it around the back and front side.<br />I use mine for crossfit and they are perfect with a high waist band for squats and all."
3.0,"Everything perfect except the neckline is weird, going have to wear a scarf or something to cover it up."
3.0,Pretty but the dark gray part of it was worn out /scratched/faded and fits a bit looser than other bands I’ve purchased.  Other than that it’s nice.
3.0,Mitten part will not stay over fingers when closed.
3.0,It didnt look much like the picture. Granted they are earrings and work so 3 stars.
3.0,So not fit an average sized 9 year old.  These are huge
3.0,"Well made, but for me the soles are very hard with not enough cushion."
3.0,I’d say this pajama set runs large I usually fit in a large or a medium and the large is over flowing on me. The quality isn’t great and makes you a little bit sweaty.
3.0,"it only good for 2 weeks , also I am tits not easy to take breathe when I wear that"
3.0,"Delicate, beautiful, rather small. Disappointed by the size."
3.0,It's Okay
3.0,"This dress is so cute, but too large for my little. So sad that it won't work."
3.0,I was expecting a cotton tee shirt. This is not cotton and the material is very clingy. The print is very bold and sharp.
3.0,Had to return hat.  Too big for my head.  No problems with credit
3.0,"This is cute cute. It’s well enough made for the price.<br />However, the turn around time left s lit to be desired. I ordered it in May and relieved it in August."
3.0,"I am disappointed by these boots! First of all, the shaft is much taller than the description suggests (more like 17"" tall) -- I am 5'2.5"" and they go right underneath my kneecap when standing, and are hard to sit in. Even though these boots claim to expand up to 16.5"", they certainly didn't work for my 16.5"" calves. The problem is the the ""tongue"" under the lacing is not attached to the sides of the boot (like a sneaker), so my wider calf was slightly exposed after lacing them up. This gap completely defeats my purpose for wearing a tall leather boot in the winter in the Northeast, so these boots are going back.<br /><br />If your calves are rather long and smaller than 16"", then they might work for you. After all, the leather is thick and soft, and the foot bed is wonderfully cushioned so this heel height feels very walkable. Nice boots if you can fit 'em."
3.0,The embroidered image is not as sent but will suffice. Multicolored embroidery I would advise against.
3.0,"I went by the products sizing...I got a M... it fit in the chest and shoulders fine but too tight thru the waist and hips..I returned...but I loved the fabric and the style. I would definitely size up....So, I did and then.... IT WAS TOO LARGE, fit like an XL on me!"
3.0,"This dress is WAY longer than &#34;ankle length.&#34; I'm 5'8&#34; and it dragged on the floor a few inches. I wanted to return it, but it ships directly from China, so would have cost a fortune to return. To make it ankle length, I had to sew a 4&#34; hem. So if you're under 6 feet tall, this dress will be too long for you. Also, the elastic waistband hits above the waste, so if you're big-busted or long waisted, this would not work for you. Other than these size & fit problems, it would be a nice dress."
3.0,Product is very nice but very thin and delicatei expected something bigger and stronger.
3.0,This is a beautiful Swim Suit but it is not for tall/long torso girls :-(  I am 5'9/130lbs and ordered a medium and although it stretches it is definitely too tight.
3.0,Nice but I had to return. I went by their size chart and ordered XXL but it was too big. I wear a size 10 to 12 normally
3.0,"Listen to the other reviews - these are REALLY small!! I normally wear an XS, ordered up to a Medium, and still feel like I'm bursting at the seams. They shrank several inches in length after washing and drying, so they went from a few inches too long to too short. I'm 5'3 and am not sure I've ever actually had pants that were too short. The fabric itself is fairly comfy, but the construction is weird. The seams twist around so that the inner thigh seam is in the front of my ankle. The back pockets start mid-butt in the grey pair and at the bottom 1/4 (is this a thing?) on the black pair. Still giving this 3 stars because I'm just using them as pajama pants and it's ridiculously hard to find pajama pants with pockets."
3.0,Is not as thick as u saw in the picture.  I bought one like 3 years ago (black) much thicker.  I guess they used a new fabric.  A bit disappointed !
3.0,You get what you pay for. Its very flimsy.
3.0,It's absolutely beautiful and way brighter and more elegant than what the picture shows. It finally came yesterday as I had to bug Amazon about it. They told me it would be here Dec 23rd so I give them 3 stars for having to wait and then having to bug them about it all this time.
3.0,"Okay,"
3.0,"Really like this brand, just wasn't happy with straight leg style on my body type. Prefer boot cut for a ""curvy"" shape."
3.0,"This product is ok for it's price. It has ridges around the edges so it does provide some general protection to the watches glass, which is a plus. It does fit comfortably and provides enough room to keep sweat and humidity out from under the band. However, if you really take a close look at it you can tell it's a cheap product."
3.0,"These are VERY big and I didn't realize how oversized they were. I kept them, because they were still good quality and style, but be sure you want extremely oversized lenses before committing to this purchase."
3.0,"So the turtleneck on this goes really high, and looks pretty goofy. It’s a length where you’d like to flip it over, but the inside has really think seams so it looks dumb if you do that, too.<br /><br />Also, the amount of unset red dye in this is staggering. I get that this is largely my own fault, but this got pink blotches on and destroyed like 6 of my other shirts."
3.0,"These pants fit great. Purchased size S/M and I’m 5’8” 145lbs. However, I’ve only worn them a handful of times and today I noticed a hole just off one of the seams running down the inner thigh. The price and fit are great but I would still expect them to hold up longer that 2 months."
3.0,Very light material & has shorter sleeves then pictures for a plus size woman.  I won't wear it until I lose a few more pounds.
3.0,Buy the larger pair.
3.0,Super cute and adorable but my daughter only had them a week and played inside in them and material was falling apart and button came off.
3.0,2x fit like a large
3.0,The shoes are not too sturdy
3.0,Not a bad bag many compartments but I would like a sturdier bottom and more comfortable handle.
3.0,Nothing special here; felt kind of &#34;cheap&#34;.
3.0,Nice but not cozy
3.0,"they were okay, but was not impressed at all."
3.0,"Not good for working out. They don't stay up well, get see through when stretched, and have annoying seams in the crotch."
3.0,"These shoes are so pretty, but my child wore them once and the silver is peeling off. The sole seems to be well made just not the silver on the straps"
3.0,"The dress fit a tad too large.  I am not sure if sizing down would have made it just right or not.  It was loose through the chest and shoulders. Also, not sure what bra to wear! It is low in the back and the front."
3.0,I ordered my normal size and the dress is tight on the shoulders and chest.
3.0,"Thin fabric, smaller waist than indicated. Order at least one size up"
3.0,"I liked the timely delivery before Xmas. The quality was good, but they shipped size XL instead of the L that was ordered. And it was way too big. So, now it is in the replace phase. I hope they ship the correct size this time."
3.0,It was too big for me but my mother-in-love is enjoying it!
3.0,The band itself appears well made and the magnets work great - my complaint is that it doesn’t stay in place and is just a hair too big to begin with. The band slides slightly in the groove which applies the pointed ends to come out - I’ve snagged several pieces<br />of clothing so far. I’ll be returning.
3.0,I have this in another color and love it. So decided to buy this one. The fabric is awful and the sequin under shirt isn't even attached. It is clingy unlike the other one. I will keep but disappointed.
3.0,Nice top. Bought XXXL for my wife.  Had to give it to my 17 y.o. daughter
3.0,Fits well and looks great but it is VERY thin material. Based on the picture I assumed it would be 'sweatshirt' thick.
3.0,"So that bands are all nice looking and comfortable for daily wear. But in pack of 3 colors (burgundy, light pink, and black), the clip-in piece for one of the bands won’t actually clip.  It just falls right back out :/ it’s a bummer because it’s the black band, and obviously that’s the most neutral color that would have probably gotten the most use. Overall, I still like the product and will continue to wear these, but unfortunately I just don’t have the option of wearing one of the three colors I purchased."
3.0,A bit longer than expected but I think I wear it better with my hair let down.
3.0,I ordered these for my daughters wedding to make wrist corsages. After receiving them in the mail not as good of quality as I expected.<br />I tried them on to see how they were going to fit and instantly broke and pearls went every wear.  Hoping they will be sturdy enough for wedding.
3.0,"Cute style, but the fabric is really cheap. It's so thin its see-through.  I use it to wear to bed."
3.0,They work but little rough and very stiff. It'll rub the hair right off your leg after a handful of 12 hour shifts.
3.0,It was too small - I could hear my kid breathing across the room!  They sent another that fits!  Order 2 sizes up!
3.0,Very comfortable. The cups were just a tad bigger than expected.
3.0,"I bought one the first time, was so cute decided to order 5 more in different variations,<br />such as pearl, gold, and silver. Well some of the ears arrived broken.<br />Some pearls had fallen off, I mean it's easy to fix with some crazy glue.<br />But when you buy something &#34;brand new&#34; you don't expect it to arrive broken."
3.0,They arrived a bit tweaked so they don't sit straight on my face.  Still perfectly functional and do a great job with wind protection.  I have a fat head and these fit just fine.
3.0,It has an error that I did not like how it was missing a pearl. The thread where it holds the pearls is very detailed and the son of bad material is visible. I do not know if it is a manufacturer's error. But it is disappointing. For the price it had to be finest.🙁
3.0,"Product was ok, just did not fit my glasses."
3.0,"A little smaller than pictured and they are clip ons, not actual earring cuffs."
3.0,They are pretty comfortable but not good for going to the gym in public. Unless you want your junk to show through and hang out when sitting or squating then by all means these are perfect for you.
3.0,"I was thrilled when I received this dress and took it out of the ziplok bag it came in. I usually wear an extra small - small or size 6 and ordered a small. But it has no zipper (except a small one UNDER THE ARM??) nor hooks nor buttons with which to get into and out of the dress. So disappointed. I'm afraid the medium will have the same problem. Sadly, I have to return."
3.0,Mask was not included even though description states costume + mask.
3.0,"Its very pretty and seems like awesome material but its way too small for my belly button piercing, It does work well for my friends so I gave it to her"
3.0,It doesn't fit according to the description
3.0,Liked the product but did not come as advertised in inside inscription which is disappointing
3.0,"Don’t look like the picture, slightly tight and even ordered a bigger size if your tall it might fit better but I’m 5’3."
3.0,"I purchased this belt buckle in March 24,2019, about 14 months ago, today is May 23,2020.<br />If that is your idea of a long-lasting device, you’re living in then you’re living in the wrong century."
3.0,Decorative band. Santa face would easily come off.
3.0,I’m obsessed with green and black so I was excited for this. I’m also 5’11” 150lbs so I don’t encounter clothes running large. I ordered a large because this is amazon and everything seems to run small here. This is very big on me. And this item is way darker than shown in the picture. The green is almost not even noticeable compared to the black.<br />Kinda bummed.
3.0,I didn't like the huge open slits on the sides from basically your armpit down. It's pretty but I gave to a friend due to the style not being my preference. I wish this was pictured for us to see.
3.0,"My loving husband bought me this dress. It was actually pretty cute. However, it chokes my neck whenever I try to sit. Sadly I waited too long to return it. I doubt I'll wear it again. It's great if you plan on standing the whole time otherwise. Neck is the only area where it doesn't really stretch."
3.0,"This cardigan is cute but the sleeves are a little too short :(. I by no means have long arms, but the sleeves were about 1/2 inch to an inch short. Otherwise the fit is fine and the color is true to picture."
3.0,I'm 5'9&#34; and this was very short on me. I ordered an xl and it was still to small. I returned it.
3.0,"it’s an okay fabric. the sizing is off, size up."
3.0,The item is very pretty but unfortunately it came broken.
3.0,Not sure why but this lanyard broke within 2 weeks.  Have had good success with other lanyards from this company.
3.0,"I was so excited to get these leggings. The material was so soft and they seemed very well made. However, when I put them on, they didn't go as high up on my waist area as I was hoping, so I was constantly having to pull them up. Also, they were very tight around my calves. I wore them around the house for a while and when I took them off, I had marks in my legs where the seam was tight. The material itself had enough stretch and give, but it felt like the stitching was too tight. I was so bummed to have to send these back."
3.0,Entrega rápida.<br />Es un poco pequeña en comparación a mis otras gorras.
3.0,"a lot larger than expected. post of earring is also very thick. they are really cute still, just large."
3.0,"Don't get me wrong I like the product the pendant looks cool, nice structure and design but the reason I am giving this 3 stars is because it is way smaller than I thought it would be not to mention the pendant/rope is too short, for example you can increase the length of the rope but even when I did that there is still a slight struggle to get it around my neck."
3.0,"Good rings, don’t get your hopes up about the glitter ones though. Literally comes off after the first hour of wearing. The black ring with blue specks is now just a black ring haha, but the other three solid color ones are still nice"
3.0,I think these run a little on the small side. I ordered a small(10-11) for a 10.5t and fit but they are tight and my daughter can barely fit her foot it. They are nice quality and such a great idea!!
3.0,This short is pretty but the material is more slinky and stretchy and isn't as oversized as they say. I'm a large in shirt and the xl is a but big so I'd order two sizes up. Also each color is a dif material.
3.0,"The brim isn’t really sewn in all that well and the fit is off. The brim doesn’t match the width of the hat and has about a quarter inch the sticks out on either side (and I have a big head.) It’s also not sewn tightly to the cap and has some movement issues. Wearable, but won’t be purchasing again."
3.0,Cool looking with the light up effects but the most uncomfortable mask I've ever worn
3.0,The pants fit like a 4t but the top was a lot smaller. Especially the sleeves. Tooooo tight
3.0,"I wear the shirt to play golf, but it is snug."
3.0,If you sweat they will lose the glue.

3.0,I love the color but it run big Im 5/4 110 bls I order small
3.0,"When they stay together these are super cute and add a ton is style to crocs, however I find myself gluing the rhinestones back to the posts pretty often. Even lost a few."
3.0,Shipping took a couple months and when it arrived right before christmas outfit was way to big so our newborn could not wear it. Said 0 to 3 months but is way bigger than that.
3.0,Cheaply made but very cute. Get what you pay for!
3.0,"I bought this for my four year old daughter for dance class because of the beautiful color as it appears online. However, in person the leotard was a very faded yellow and looked cheap. I must say the tutu in comparison was buch brighter and better looking than the leotard. But the lackluster leotard brings the whole outfit down :("
3.0,warning this will show every roll you have even though it's a cute bathing suit
3.0,"Love the looks of this, very trendy but does tangle easily.  I am readjusting throughout the day, and it's been tangled in my hair more times than I'd like to count.."
3.0,It's not a bad sweater but the length felt short
3.0,Ordered these same exact shorts in the same size but two different colors and the gray is super big compared to the pink ones. I am 5’5 and 190lbs and the pink XL fits better then the gray. They are a great lightweight material. Obviously will wrinkle easily. But just disappointing the sizing is so off<br />-Purchase with caution-
3.0,This scarf is pretty okay. The main problem I have with it is that the polka dots are not white; they're more of a light brown. I think I've only only worn it once since I bought it
3.0,Stripes didn’t line up right
3.0,"Cute dress, the material quality is what you would expect for the price.  Way too large.  I mean, two sizes too large.  Unwearable.  Gave to a friend who is a size bigger than me and it was too big for her as well.  Definitely size down."
3.0,"Things ND flimsy, doesn't stand up like picture. Cheap quality. But okay"
3.0,The bottom was too small for my thick thighs so I wore jeans over them.
3.0,It is nice but it is tight on me
3.0,"the pincushion was coming apart on the bottom.  the green cord to form the tomato shape was too loose and not secured.  fabric was not stitched down.  took some permanent fabric glue to the whole mess, so it works for my travel sewing kit.  i would never give this as a gift."
3.0,"Doesn't work that well, over hyped"
3.0,"Beautiful and unique.  However,  beware the black fussy dye color or fabric will get on your other clothing or stick on the skin. I got a lot of compliments, though."
3.0,Very nice skirt but it comes smaller then expected.
3.0,Heart. Small.
3.0,Too complicated!!!
3.0,"It is very comfortable and I like the color.  The only thing I don’t like is where the belt is, it’s much higher than my waist so I would go up a size."
3.0,"I was asked to review this product so received it recently and have had a few days to get to know it.  The first thing about it is that it's a bit industrial looking.  I wear almost all sterling silver jewelry - bracelets, earrings, necklaces.  This is silver but it's not a shiny silver.  It's more like an industrial metal.  For a man, I think this would be perfect.  But with the rest of my silver bracelets, it looks a little awkward.  But it's not BAD.  I was interested in this product because I have arthritis in my left thumb, making it difficult to open a jar, for example, and giving me twinges of pain from time to time when I move it wrong.  I don't know yet if it's helped that but it certainly hasn't hurt it, by any means.  I'm going to continue wearing it for now."
3.0,"Un arete me llegó mal, esta separado, pero cuestión de amarrarlo de nuevo"
3.0,I love the fit but material isn’t as good as used to be
3.0,It’s not as long as in the picture.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:c5f063e0f7b8d41d35ea18fc26bf6e13]] SMALL! I had no idea I was paying $30+ for a thin piece of metal the size of my thumbnail. The etching is extremely superficial and I do not anticipate it to last long. The links are cheap and Bend.  Otherwise it looks identical to my little guy. And for that I get a kick out of it every time I look at it.
3.0,"First, this wasn't a terrible purchase. It does what it says on the tin: protecting my airtag in a plastic TPU enclosure. What surprised me was the pictures make it look like screws hold it together for maximum durability but instead it's just 4 plastic clips on one part of the two part mold that clip into the other. The 'screws' are fake and just part of the same mold. It also does not close entirely, as though the airtag is just a little too fat but since that was its only purpose I'm a bit underwhelmed. It will do but I won't be buying another."
3.0,I like the shirt however it's a little big at the bottom.  Need to tuck it in to make it look ok.
3.0,Love my clip-on Natural Shadow Feather earrings but some feathers came out must handle with care this ones.
3.0,"There's a metal bit between the jewels and the barberll that keeps the jewelry from sitting quite right on my ear. It didn't look right for the piercing I bought it for, but I intend to get my midway helix done and it might work there, but it still doesn't lay flat on the ear."
3.0,"Much smaller than the picture, and not what I expected."
3.0,The wire is really tightly wound so it doesn't have much flex when worn.  I think it makes for an uncomfortable fit if you use too small beads.  You need to use fairly large beads which make it open a little wider but it's still a little too tight.
3.0,"This is an update to my first review several months back. I wasn't a fan of slip on shoe styles but I gave it a try. After many months I can now say I'm really not a fan of slip on's. Not matter what I try, these occasionally fall off my feet at the worst time most often when I'm going down stairs. But thats me. As far as the slippers in general, the support was great when I purchased them, but they have flattened out to the point where they don't really add anything. They are difficult to keep clean and the adjustment tabs on each side curl out no matter what you do. So after maybe 7 months, they no longer support my feet, they are not a nice looking as when I first received them (I do take care of them)  and of course there is the stair fall risk when they slide off. This time around I'm simply going to buy a good pair of slipper and add my own support."
3.0,"I was pleasantly surprised of the quality for the price, it’s a thick plastic, the horns stay up straight, the only issue we had is the head piece was smashed and it has a forever crink in it, we can’t get it to lay flat on her forehead. But for the price and for a one day event it works."
3.0,little bigger than i expected for my 8 year old.
3.0,This fits kind of weird (I got a small and am 5' 115 lbs) and the fabric feels cheap. I worry how it will hold up through washing and drying. I'm not sure you could even wear a strapless bra under this as it gaps really bad in the chest area near the armpits. I got it to go over a swim suit and it will be fine for that but I would never wear it as a regular dress...
3.0,"Its a little small, sleeves are a bit short and the skirt is hard to zip up. Otherwise very cute"
3.0,Arms tight body too large
3.0,"The color was definitely OFF on this in the Pink. It was closer to a lavender, so we had to return it, unfortunately. Easy return. The quality was good, but don't choose the pink and expect a normal pink."
3.0,"My wife loves the way it fits, really shows off your physique. What she didn’t like was the material the dress was made off. She said it felt cheap and probably wouldn’t make it through it’s first wash, definitely something you would have to have dry cleaned. If you’re looking for a dress you may only wear for once for an event or date, this may be dress for you."
3.0,IT ALL RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!
3.0,Nice frames if they were 50% smaller. They came down to below my nostrils.
3.0,"It is slightly too small.  Fits a bit too snug.  And the washing instructions tell to hand wash. No dry cleaning.  No washer and no dryer.  In today's wash and wear convenience, this makes for more work than I care to handle.  If the write up had mentioned the care instructions,  I would not have purchased it."
3.0,"Idk I guess I'm not used to heart shapes. It's cute, but couldn't get used to it even after 3 days. Irritated me so much I took it out"
3.0,"I like the quote, it’s cute for fall. The shirt is very small and not as long as portrayed in the picture if you have any curves on your chest.  Also, the shirt is rough and mine came with a flaw on one of the letters.  I won’t be ordering more similar products."
3.0,Would like to see origin of product in advertising instead of imported. This product is from China I’d rather purchase products from countries friendly with US.
3.0,The pink that comes is more of a highlighter pink than this magenta hot pink.
3.0,Sticks up on the top of my head and water comes in around the back.
3.0,"Es demasiado pequeño no sirve, es para talla 6 de USA"
3.0,Stitching is iffy. The underwire is sticking out and the enclosure for it is loosely stitched
3.0,Nice pants gave them a 3 cuz the thread was sticking out where they sewed the roses on
3.0,"devent little wrist peace, fit well and wasn't too loose."
3.0,These were hella uncomfortable.  They were meant to be worn for walking around an event for several hours.  I wound up having to head back to the hotel room and change out.  But they are super cute if you just plan to wear them to dinner.
3.0,"This is a nice top, but it was pictured as being more &#34;silky,&#34; and is instead more like jersey material. Very pretty color."
3.0,"Pretty large, read other reviews and ordered the large cus I like my shirts bigger but would have been safe with a medium, normally wear lg-xl. 5’8 185lbs big around the neck and arm pits. Also the color is a brighter baby blue than the picture suggests but still cute"
3.0,"I got this for my 10yr old she loves it, but it runs small in my opinion."
3.0,The quality of the shirts were good but they were too small. Tight fitting as well.
3.0,Ok experience
3.0,was a gift for friend
3.0,"I measured my hand and according to the chart I was a Large, but it was definitely too small"
3.0,"While it is very comfortable to wear with broad straps, it unfortunately rides up so the bottom of the bra has to be regularly pulled down."
3.0,"Too large, ordered normal size and it was too big. Really needed a small."
3.0,Shirt was ok.. I just didn’t care for it and was afraid it’d shrink and was already shorter than I’d like.
3.0,"I needed something to put over my heels so I would be able to walk in the grass for my outdoor wedding. While they did the job, they did not fit securely onto my heels (even the smallest size). With about 20 minutes of walking, I lost one heel protector, which I was unable to find. I went the rest of the night with only one on, which was fine. They are clear so no one can notice them. All in all, very cheap, but they get the job done."
3.0,The nightshirt does not stay closed. The buttons keep coming undone. I loved the look and the quality of the material- very comfortable just wish it would stay fastened. It fits perfectly
3.0,Very cute but they snap very easily. And the metal rusts a little after a while.
3.0,"Function: Very Good<br />Value: Good<br />Appearance: Good<br />Durability: Poor<br />Shipping time: Good<br /><br />I have purchased 4 of these over the span of a year.  For the price, it is a good buy.  It functions quite well for corset training / waist training.  The downfall is that 14 out of its 16 spines are too flimsy (approximately 1 millimeter thin).  These spines crimp very quickly with long-term wear, especially if you like it tight.  The 2 spines that are immediately parallel to where the corset fastens are okay.  After a month of long-term use (maybe 16 hrs a day) expect some pain as those crimped spines dig into your sides.  But for the price, just buy a new one, they work well."
3.0,"Sturdy, good quality, but oh so painful to get on!"
3.0,Very nice looking and works decnt enough.  Not as airtight as I would have liked.  Seems to not seal well between the stem and the base.<br /><br />All in all I have enjoyed this product.  Especially for the price.
3.0,"Pants are comfortable, more thin than expected, draw string came out in first wash,only had a month, already showing wear and tear"
3.0,I measured myself and they were still too large. The shifts didn’t stay down while working out and kept sliding around exposing myself.
3.0,keeps falling down
3.0,Pendant is cute but it is about the size of a dime (a bit smaller). The picture is misleading.
3.0,"The socks fit well and worked great but after only a few times wearing, the grip dots are already gone at the balls of my feet. Wouldn't buy again because I only got a few wears out of them"
3.0,I was really looking forward to trying on this dress. When it arrived it did not have any tags like it had been returned before. I normally wear a small but this one was too tight. I'm returning not sure if ill reorder a size up. The color was exactly as the picture and not see through at all.
3.0,This was really tight for an adult medium.
3.0,"I wanted a small hoop or j shaped earring for my second hole on my ear.  this is very small, definitely for a child."
3.0,The sandals are not exactly like the picture but look very similar. I like them and get many compliments when wearing them.
3.0,"I'm 5ft9in 200lbs 34E, I got a size XL, to put into perspective. I love the color of this dress and the fact that it was only $12. But the waist is a little too form fitting and not as flowing as it looked it would be. The torso of this dress is oddly longer than i thought it would be. I bought a real dress from Heruo and it fits PERFECTLY. Its the same style but fits/sits better on the waist."
3.0,Too big... but I like the inscription
3.0,Cute but quality not that great... should have spent more for better
3.0,"So far I’ve have bought 2 pairs of black medium pants and 1 pair gray medium pants. The fit was great but after one use on each of these , there would be a rip right where you would expect a zipper to be. The rip doesn’t go all the way through , so it isn’t exactly a hole, but it is noticeable. The pockets are a great help to hold my iPhone or cards, but not too much or it’ll fall out. I like how the pants to control the tummy and give it a flatter look . I would still buy again, but really can we fix the issue on the front please?"
3.0,Great suit fits small
3.0,Size medium fits like a large so the vest doesn't keep its warmth.
3.0,"These shoes came from China and shipping took a long time. When they arrived there was a very strong chemical smell from the shoes. I couldn't smell the leather because this chemical smell overpowered everything. I figured this was because shipping took so long and the shoes were sealed in a cardboard box within a sealed plastic bag. So I had to air them out a few days. Afterwards, the leather appears to be a bonded type of leather. So not a solid piece of leather. The sizing was way off, being too big. Nothing in the package nor on the shoes could indicate that they possibly sent the wrong size because all words were not in English and there were no numbers that I could see. So my son could not wear them at this time. I will say that the foot bed was very well cushioned and appeared that they would be comfortable for long wear. The soles are a grooved thick rubber that's very flexible. The style of the shoe is attractive and appears to be well constructed. My tip: sizing is problematic so measure your child's foot and question the seller BEFORE ordering! These I will donate because I don't know any other children who could fit them. I won't send them back because it took so long to get here I'm afraid that summer and fall would be over before I got a replacement pair.  I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review."
3.0,"Pros: once you have it on, your girls are secure!<br /><br />Cons: it’s impossible to zip this on your own. The zipper needs to be larger/more sturdy or just eliminated. The extra little flaps of fabric on the top & bottom of the zipper don’t help the situation. They were in the way & kept getting stuck in the zipper.  I even tried zipping it before putting it on & then pulling it on over my head. That was a workout in itself bc the fabric is not stretchy. Finally I gave up."
3.0,I have had this wallet for about 4 months now... a little stiff and my zipper keeps getting stuck on the cash (side pockets are a little shallow for bills. Its okay...but I have enjoyed a much cheaper and softer leather wallet than this Coach...
3.0,A little thick and stifling made of strange material.  I like that it is adjustable but the graphic is also very small and looks out of place... I'll wear it but I don't love it.
3.0,"Runs small - I got a Medium and it fits like a small, plus the arm holes are not a muscle-tank-y as pictured, they're more like regular arm holes"
3.0,"Super cute monkey print and soft fabric, but these run small, so size up."
3.0,"This is a cute top, but I wasn’t expecting the fabric to have a shine to it.  I wear a 14 and wanted a bigger top to cover my bottom, but this fits like an  XL, not 2X"
3.0,"Cute, but bulky"
3.0,I’m 5’8 and this dress was too short for my liking. It came right above the ankle. The color was beautiful but material is easily wrinkled. I returned the dress.
3.0,"Shorter than expected. I'm only 5'6"" and it looks like high waters"
3.0,"I'm a 10/12, and for as large as this looks on the model, it hit right at my hips and was tight across my hips. So I would say best for US sizes 10 and under. Also, it's somewhat thin/sheer"
3.0,"I went by the reviews and ordered a larger size than I normally wear and I couldn't zip the back up past my waist. I also saw on the reviews that the dress was made in china, their sizing must be way off. The dress was pretty, seemed to be extra long but was not happy with the sizing issue, I had no choice but to return it. Pleased with the no hassle return I received from Amazon."
3.0,"Runs small, really tight. Slight stretch but not a lot. Let it air out because it smells really bad when you first get it. If you get one that fits, it does look nice."
3.0,Was hoping they would be a little smaller. The post is also way to short.
3.0,"Cute and nice material but it was super snug in the waist and the hips. Not flattering on me at all, but I’m not a slim girl! I would probably size up on this one if you don’t like snug."
3.0,"I paid less than 3 dollars for them.  The sunglasses have a cheap finish, but they're confortable and look OK.  They definitely don't look like designer glasses, but for the price, who cares?"
3.0,"I liked the look and the fabric, however, one of the decorative buttons feel off the first time I wore this shirt."
3.0,This is not a super quality product but is ok for play wear. My daughter is on the thinner side and the jacket fits her true to size but pants are a size bigger. I liked the jacket more than the pants. The pants will not last long and not many washes in the machine. Looks to be cheaply made. The jacket is much better. The velour is soft and not scratchy. It is not for winters but more for fall or spring wear. Or you put a thicker jacket on top of the hoodie.<br />I received this girls velour hoodie and pant sweat suit at a discounted price in exchange of my honest review and all the opinions above are based solely on my experience with the product and not influenced by the discount at al.
3.0,Cute fabric but spandex is hot and it’s very tight fitting.
3.0,Very nice just to small
3.0,"I am disappointed that they are now making the strap smaller than in previous versions.  I struggle to get it to go around my wrist.  Other than that, it's fine."
3.0,kinda flimsy  not a lot if shape
3.0,Becarful its a snug fit and the rose on the back kinda fell off -_- buuut i glued it back on lol
3.0,Christmas gift and will not be opened until then. I will give it a review at that time.
3.0,"I'm 5'8 and ordered a Large. While it generally fit and I liked the pattern, it was too short to be comfortable.  I ended up returning it, next time I may try to size up a bit."
3.0,Loose clamp fell off but was very nice
3.0,Fabric is a bit hot
3.0,"stepped on wet floor while mopping and they are NOT anti slip, grip or anything. pretty comfy but dangerous foam bottom will deter me from getting more."
3.0,"El diseño es bonito, pero de mala calidad las tallas corren un poco pequeñas así que si quieren que le quede bien que use 1 o 2 tallas más y la verdad para usar en la casa como pantuflas está bien por que se ve que no duran nada ."
3.0,"It looks fine and fits fine, but the fabric is horrible. It's a texture thing for sure, but it feels cheaper than it actually cost and is not something that is agreable to wear for long periods."
3.0,"small, easily breakable, arrived over a week late and a few of the ""pearls"" were broken, too late for the party, but my granddaughter loves to use it as dress up."
3.0,I measured my arms as instructed but the elastic around my biceps is strong enough to start to cut off the circulation to my hands and they started to tingle after a few minutes. I would say these run small as my measurement was around 3/4 inch from the &#34;max&#34; for the size.
3.0,The heart and garnet charm is very nice... a bit smaller than I pictured.  The chain is awful.  Its the kind that always gets stuck in your hair and pulls it out.  If there's a nice sale go ahead and order the necklace but swap the chain for one you already have.
3.0,"Ordered these in (M)11.5 and I do have a generally wide foot. Product quality is worth the price, however overall width of the shoe is narrow. The toe area is incredibly tight, despite being true to overall length. Might consider ordering a half size up to accommodate lack of width."
3.0,"Seller should consider re-categorizing this as a tunic top or a even a shift dress! For reference: I'm 4'8"". The small nearly goes to my knees.<br /><br />Im still keeping it though, because it pairs well with leggings and a longer cardigan."
3.0,"Handwashing or machine washing didn't matter, it still looked dirty inside. I loves the print and wore it even though it would slip into my eyes; the wiring helped. It was not very sturdy and popped after a few months. I loved its beauty so I kept wearing it until one of the ends fell off. Despite all the issues, I kept it and will fix it later, but this mask was very high maintenance."
3.0,Liked the style but the quality of material not so much
3.0,The fit is fine on these. Inside is as expected.  Only complaint is that the footbed is not very padded and on tile floors don't have the cushioning that I was hoping for.  But should be expected for the price.
3.0,Very comfy but a bit on the big side. Good to wear with leggings.
3.0,"I’m 5’7” 160 lbs/72 k. I liked the color but the seam that sits above my knees is not a very smooth in transition making it create a visual dent in my thigh. If a more stretchable thread was used in this seam, this may have been avoided. Tummy control is medium for a high waisted short.  For this reason I will keep but probably not wear to gym. Only for home work outs."
3.0,I loved the color and skirt of this dress. It was flowing and flattering but would have required a slip to keep from exposing undergarments if blown open by the wind.  I did have to return it as it was too snug in the chest. I ordered a medium as it looked to be a baggy fit but it was still too small for me.
3.0,I have a daith piercing that is 16g and my 16g earrings fit inside this one so I was disappointed that I can’t wear my cute earring.
3.0,The design popped out of the wire frame after one use. I was able to repair it with purchase of some new jewelry wire.
3.0,"I liked the style of this beanie, but the one I received was poorly made, the yarn was coming unraveled on one side... Too bad they're not inspected before sending"
3.0,Ok quality. A little on the thinner and but not bad really. Fits well.
3.0,This was rose gold and not yellow gold. Stones were very shiny and beautiful... Metal could have been better...
3.0,The style was great they just were to small.
3.0,10w is not wide<br />shoe is uncomfortable<br />waste of money
3.0,Not exactly fit as this size usually does.  I like the color
3.0,"The necklace is beautiful, but a little flimsy. The quality is very cheap."
3.0,colors not as brite as picture
3.0,"It’sa little smaller than I expected, and I don’t have a big head😉<br />It will probably fort better a child’s head"
3.0,"It was too large. The material was what you'd expect. The print was pretty and somewhat blurry (what I liked about it) but unfortunately, it was too large and I ordered a S. I'm 5' 3&#34; and if I had to alter it, I'd have to cut out almost 1/3 of the fabric for it to fit me."
3.0,"At this price, the sweater would be a bargain if the sizing was reliable.  The medium I purchased, my normal size, was very tight especially in the sleeves.  This is more a fit for a woman, than a man. the arms and sleeves are quite narrow and not comfortable."
3.0,"Color not as  picture more on the red side.XS fits perfectly  for my height 5,3 and 115 pounds.It is just after my knees.SKirt came with many wrinkles so I decided to return it instead of dealing with it. ( you can't iron it)"
3.0,I bought this jacket a little bit bigger.it’s way too big for me now. Also very thin material
3.0,According to the pic I thought it was glitter material but instead it's same material as black and colors are separated instead of glitter.
3.0,Fit not true to size.  Runs smaller.
3.0,"I used the stainless steel version of this kit, and I am at a 4 gauge now. When I went to put the o-rings on the back of my 4 gauges, they were too small. It turns out that the o-rings for the 6 gauges were also what they put in the 4 gauge bag. I had to order proper sized o-rings from another site. 😾 otherwise, great for stretching as long as you get the stainless steel! Acrylics gave me an infection!"
3.0,I ordered a small and I sometimes wear a small/medium depending on the cut.  This is really big around the mid-section.  The v-neck is short and not really becoming.......it leaves me with a boxy shape.......not flattering.  Shirt is comfy though.
3.0,Cute...but the waist is very high making it awkward and uncomfortable.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:245146894e9a4ad7283ecddd95972e15]] It’s kinda smaller
3.0,It was ok expected it to be a looser fit
3.0,Not original but works fine.
3.0,Material is nice. Sequin doesn’t catch. Fits oddly. Runs large
3.0,"The tragus earring was very pretty. I had it for 2 weeks, wore it 24/7 but woke up this morning to it gone. Lost it when I was asleep. Guess I have to find another one now."
3.0,"It worked, but being made of plastic it is not real durable."
3.0,Perfect little thin but she loved it
3.0,It's pretty but the clasp doesn't lock
3.0,The Dress was great but get a size down. My GF is a medium but a small would have been better.
3.0,Fast delivery. Poor quality. Small rings and the color faded after a couple of days of wear.
3.0,"Size up at least two sizes if you want it to look looser like it does on the model. I bought XXL and I wear a 14/16 in woman's for most things. This garment fits very snug in the chest and arms. I only wear a B cup, so ladies with a larger chest will probably find this too tight across the bust. The material has a very artificial thick polyester (think you grandmas pants) feel. I like the way it looks on, and I only paid 12.00 for it, so I will keep it around as a cute dress; but don't imagine I will wear it often."
3.0,"Product fits great and it works great under a halter top, as promised, but it is crazy scratchy!"
3.0,I was expecting the socks to be a little thicker.
3.0,Need to be longer and wider or more adjustable each way
3.0,"I wanted SO BADLY to like this dress.  It is beautiful and good quality.  My measurements are 41-30-40, and I ordered a large.  It was a little big in the waist, but it fit well with my larger bust.  I am 5'3&#34; and it went to my knees.  The embroidery is beautiful.  However, as others have mentioned, the waist seam is not at the natural waist like it shows in the model photo, but is more of an empire waist.  Normally I would use a skinny dress belt to cinch the waist a bit, but I am unable to do this with this particular dress because of the placement of the waist seam.  I do not have a long torso by any means, so the waist seam placement is very unusual.  I will be returning this, sadly."
3.0,It looks great but the fabric is too thin and it came already with some lines and marks..I was lucky enough that I asked a friend to took a picture of me and then i saw the marks in the fabric .
3.0,Pretty Purse but small and hard to open.. Also the return process is terrible. No label no instructions and no description. Tried to print my confirmation and nothing printed. Tried another e mail from Chadwick and Belk no problem but they had labels in the box. Hopefully I receive my credit
3.0,"Am 5’2”, 131 lbs, 34DD/36D. Was too tight in bust & skimpy in body. Had to return."
3.0,"I do really like this shirt and it is exactly as the picture... however, after one or two washes it started losing significant color and started falling apart. Very unfortunate as it was very comfy and everyone in the office complimented it, but I only got to wear it twice, so only giving it 3 stars."
3.0,RING WAS HUGE BIGGER THAN THE BELL.
3.0,Was bigger than I expected. I have small wrists and this falls right off but very pretty I wrap it over my watch so I can still wear it
3.0,"This is a pretty skirt. The material is a bit thin and shows the seam of a tucked in shirt. I make it work, but not a go-to item."
3.0,"Very nice on, like the photo however will change or tarnish if your sensitive like I am to fake metals just put clear coat on it to protect it. Must be done right after receiving so do not try to wear it first, clear coat it first."
3.0,the size of this shirt was confusing. I bought an XL because thats my size. It was too tight so i returned and and got a XXL it was way too big. I loved the shirt. Just could figure my size
3.0,"This mask did what is advertised; it allows the mouth area of the face (smile!) to be seen.  It is a little uncomfortable for prolonged use.  The plastic viewing area is flexible, which I appreciate, and the fabric has a white jersey backing.  That helps for the cloth area.  When breathing, sometimes the plastic viewing area tends to be 'suctioned' onto my face.  There is some vapor build-up, which dissipates in a few seconds. The set of five makes it worth the purchase but I won't wear them as often as I had hoped.  This also explains why I don't see people wearing them much."
3.0,I would say it's more for light impact versus medium impact
3.0,"I gave this product a 3/5 because it’s not the material I was expecting. The material is thick and more for everyday wear NOT so much for working out. However, I think it would be great for people who want to wear them in public. They are not see through."
3.0,Not the best quality as the leather band became very loose and looked worn after wearing just once. Cute and fashionable though.
3.0,"I love the look of this lightweight sweater. It's a pretty bold orange and the weave is very loose which means that although it's lightweight, it's also prone to snag easily. So beware."
3.0,"The strap on this watch will fall off more often than an unstable container. Trying to put the strap back on after the nth time just makes it tedious. I would not buy another for the life of me, no matter the discount."
3.0,OK but they are a little big for my Vivo Fit 3 band.  They do the job though.
3.0,"Love these lil' weightless hearts. They are Comfortable, Well made, & cute. However, I ordered A pair in ""Garnet"".  These appear to be the hue of ""Carnelian"".. I'll know for sure (hope it Matches) when I Order the Garnett Necklace .."
3.0,Very pretty but bulkier than expected.
3.0,Pensé que era una chaqueta más formal
3.0,A nice tshirt but the logo is cheap. It looks and feel like a old school iron on. I do know if this shirt will last 3 washes. Looks good well now.
3.0,This fits well but is still awkward.... the straps on the sleeves are cut weird and the material is not pleasant. Wouldn't recommend.
3.0,"They came with one of the earrings from one of the sets messed up and wouldn't close. Other than that, they were perfect."
3.0,It's cute but I was expecting more of a white and black and it's actually an off white more of a beige than white
3.0,Good for the price but one of the straps broke from my daughter just putting it on.
3.0,I wrestled with this dress for about 15 minutes before giving up.  Once it’s on it’s very nice but it is very thin and has gaps in places.  The holes in the dress for the belt portion are large so it shows my bra strap.  It also doesn’t seem to close all the way in my torso?  It held enough to wear out but I felt pretty self conscious feeling like everyone could see my bra or belly.
3.0,Good for above freezing temperatures.
3.0,Gets lose from use. Xprin brand is better .
3.0,"I was so excited to find this, I'm getting my Uncle a white sweater and a moose mug to go with the dickie. I thought it'd be kinda tacky but this was a little too much.... rough edges, and that halloween costume silky cheap feel. I was hoping for cotton, but, I guess 15 bucks only gets you polyester. I'll still give it to him, it's only a gag gift anyways, but I was hoping for something a little more quality made."
3.0,The sizing was off. It was big! And the fabric is weird. Skirt is crazy heavy but too is thin. Ehh..
3.0,"These Large Huggie Hoop Earring for Women may ne too large in fact. They are a bit much. Otherwise, if you like big earrings they seem relatively well made."
3.0,"The dress itself is pretty. I ordered a dress a size bigger than my measurements so I could have it altered, but the dress is smaller than what I ordered. Not much room for alterations. The lace is ok, there are several threads hanging off & some fraying on the back. The lace is also very itchy. The dress is nice for the cost."
3.0,"The sweater itself is very soft and good quality.  However, the sizing runs small.  I am 5'6'' and weigh 135 and typically wear a medium, which is what I ordered.  The sweater fits snug and the arms end about 2 inches above my wrists, which is weird because the shoulders fit perfect.  I just pushed them up so it looks like 3/4 sleeves.  If you want the sweater to be looser like in the picture be sure to order at least one size larger than you would typically wear"
3.0,The o ring keeps coming apart and the chain falls off it. I do wear it a lot because I keep my work ID on it. Maybe it would be better if it weren’t worn everyday.
3.0,Ordered a medium and top was a little awkward. May fit some body styles but not me. 5'6&#34; 130lbs. Could be a five star for the right build. Decent material.
3.0,I normally wear a S/M and it was way too small. I should've ordered a L/XL but that was my fault. The reason I gave 3 stars was the style of the shirt was what I was looking for but there was an odd pungent smell and the print wasn't the same as the picture. Ultimately returning.
3.0,I ordered size L (age 12-14) for my 11 yrs old boy who is pretty slim (80lbs).  Thank goodness I ordered the larger size since they fit them nicely now but with no room for growth.
3.0,"This review is for the ISHVAKU Bohemian Handmade Beaded Bracelet in color ""red.""<br /><br />This is a multi-strand bracelet that comes with a large brass ring that can be removed so that you have five separate bracelets, if you wish. There are many different styles and colors of beads in each strand, creating an overall eclectic boho look, very charming. However, the quality is mediocre, and I could see these beads breaking if you ""play too hard"" while wearing these bracelets. Overall, I'd rate this set a B-."
3.0,"Cheap, too tight if you're busty but cute for a teen"
3.0,nice royal blue cardigan
3.0,Bulky case makes it uncomfortable to carry in a pocket. Gave the cases to the grandkids...they love 'em.
3.0,Worked out well to embroider hankies for weddings.
3.0,Does not fit as espexted!
3.0,"Works well with a few cards and multiple bills, but does not close completely when empty, so not tight enough to grip a single card or a few bills.  If you routinely carry a quarter inch of stuff it will work OK, but a single card and a couple bills will slide out."
3.0,"Not super sturdy, but very cute if you want something simple & aren’t expecting to have it for years"
3.0,"It feels like the item shrunk after washing it for the first time. Also, the threads began to unravel."
3.0,These gloves protect against heat and sparks  but the inner lining came apart after several use. This makes putting on and off a hassle. Would probably not buy again.
3.0,It’s a nice size but kinda stiff. I was super excited for the smaller bag which is ok but the flaps the hook the small bag to the big bag stick out. Also when using the crossbody the small bag comes up and everything on the side falls underneath
3.0,"Decent for dollars spent. The strap is unevenly cut, and the strap holes are too far apart. Stitching is nice."
3.0,"Love the fit and style of this dress, but be aware it is not this baby pink.  It is more flesh toned.  I decided to keep it and got lots of compliments!"
3.0,Smaller than I thought...a string for the necklace?  Really!
3.0,"The dress is a tad small/tight when putting the arms in through the crocheted flowered sleeves, so I’d recommend sizing up. It arrived with the beading on the middle flower coming off. Luckily, I was able to fix it myself. The dress was just for my daughter’s Halloween costume, so it worked out. Not the best quality, but it does look cute."
3.0,The material is thin and the print is weak.
3.0,Let me say that they are cute but they are awkward at the same time. Like they don't look as good as the picture AT ALL. A bit baggy but all you have to do is pull them all the way up your back side...
3.0,"I'm 5'9, with a very slender build, and ordered the small. I could've fit the XS but the sleeves would've been too short. It's nice for the price I paid (lightning deal). Material is my biggest complaint, it's 100% polyester, and not very soft. There was little plastic strands coming out of it and I'm worried about washing it. It's okay for $10, but if you're paying anything more than that, you're better off finding something else."
3.0,This fan is beautiful and a great size. The only reason it gets three stars is because the pin holding the fan together broke after about two (gentle) uses. I currently have it rubber-banded together which is not the sexiest solution but it works.
3.0,It was a little more tan than I needed and a little tight. It still works just fine.
3.0,quality product -- but too small for an adult head.
3.0,It's ok it kinda shorter then what I expected.
3.0,Overall it is worth the purchase due to the low price but don't expect high quality. The decal on the front was partially off when it was shipped.  The size is good for an adult.
3.0,"Even though I like the design of this strap (belt loop style), sometimes the clips that attach to the device disengage."
3.0,One of the lens was a bit loose but not bad for the price.
3.0,I wear a size 10 ring and these I couldn't even get over the knuckle<br />Very disappointed in product !
3.0,Incredible price
3.0,Nice lightweight material. They run a bit on the smaller side. I am a female and I normally wear a medium in women’s and small in men’s clothing. I purchased these a size larger hoping for looser fit and they fit like a typical men’s small.
3.0,"Cute, fits well except the sleeves are very short"
3.0,The jacket is very soft and roomy.  I normally wear a large but decided to size down to a med because of the measurements provided.  Because this is a short jacket and I have a larger chest I didn't want the jacket to look too big.  I still have plenty of room and I'm satisfied with the sizing.  I am 5'4'' and my arm length is average and I found this jacket's arm length fits perfect.  I normally have to cuff my sleeves a half a roll but this one came right to my writs.  If you have longer arms you may find the sleeve length to be a little short. The edges are raw and strings pull giving the jacket a rugged look.  The only negative feedback I have is my one pocket flap is not spaced correctly over the pocket otherwise I would have given this jacket a 5 star.  This is a little disappointing for the price I paid for the jacket.  Haven't decided if I will send it back or remove the flap and re-sew it on correctly.
3.0,It is very thin and cheap
3.0,I love the bag it’s the type I like with the side pockets & it’s not that heavy. Comes with 2 separate size straps which are detachable. But the color is really a muddy bluish grey. My 2nd photo makes it look bluer than it really is. If you want a true blue bag look elsewhere.
3.0,A bra. Didn’t fit so it wasn’t used
3.0,it was poofy and not the fit on me that the size I ordered usually fits on me
3.0,My last review I gave it one star because the buckle did not open. I took it to my jeweler and he fixed it in about 10 minutes. Now I am happy with the watch.
3.0,"The dress is cute and flattering, fits well over my petticoat. But the material is pretty cheap, not awful but not good either. The fabric wrinkles so easily that you’ll have to iron it while you’re ironing it. And good luck sitting or walking without looking like you slept in this dress"
3.0,"Within days they fell apart, they look cute but won't last long."
3.0,Cute aprons but made for a small person
3.0,"I like this dress alot , I was very surprise that the dress was somewhat long on me. I'm 5'9 and it reach my ankles.i wish it was  dragging on the floor alittle ,its very hard to find a long dress"
3.0,Good price for three--but be careful! --this can happen easily!<br />It still works like that though
3.0,My daughter likes this but the shorts go all the way past her knees. The material is thick and good quality but a little long.  She is a little shorter however so that could be a factor.
3.0,"Beware that this top is extremely bright blue, normal royal blue scrub bottoms will not match. It also fits like a S. I am 5’0/110lbs got an XS and it is very loose fitting."
3.0,The inner sole is very smooth so your foot will slide when shoes get wet which defeats the purpose.  Cute to<br />look at and OK when dry.  Not the most comfortable I own.
3.0,It was made cheep and got smashed durning shipping
3.0,Too big for me so gave it away!
3.0,"Strong plastic smell. Not sure when or if it will go away. Other than that, it seems to serve my purpose. Just hope it will last a year of use. Too early to say for now."
3.0,Just not long enough for me and felt weird where the stripes were sewn in. Fit across chest OK...just not long enough. Looked weird.
3.0,"This little top/cover up is well made and the embroidery is well done, I believe it was done on a good machine. But mad did I ever have to iron the crap out of it. I haven't worn it yet and it still has the tag on it. But ladies it is not as the picture depicted. It looks like a long sleeve draped classy and comfortable. It actually is a short 3/4 sleeve and comes about mid hip. I'm 110 and 5'4&#34;. Hopefully it will wash and wear nicely because I'm sure it is too late to return."
3.0,the material was not cotton at all and would be too hot for summer
3.0,Really them then I was just hoping they weren’t so thin my kiddo will rip this in a day or two
3.0,"These 3 headbands are all nice looking but they are hard to keep on my head. The first few times I wore them,  when I woke up they had came off my head during the night.  I've tried tying them many different ways. I have to tie them super tight in order to keep them from coming off during the night, which is very uncomfortable. But they seem to be good quality and they are nice looking. I just think they are way too long. I have to tie it in the back, bring it around the front,  then around the back again in order to tie it so its not hanging."
3.0,Was expecting it to be a little better but wife wears it so she must like it. cheap little plastic wing takes away from it
3.0,I loved the idea but was disappointed when I went to assemble it with my keys. If you don't have the perfect amount of keys and they don't fit just right they will freely rotate and get tangled up. This is because they do not give you enough of the rubber washers to take up the space for a snug fit. There's only a couple washers and that will only space 2 or 3 keys and you need more to fill the whole stud. And the screws strip very easy and the bit driver won't come close to actually working.
3.0,just blah
3.0,"I purchased the set of two with three flamingos and the unicorn print. The dresses themselves were decent quality, I’d compare them to H&M. The problem for me was that they were way too short and my daughter is actually on the shorter side percentile wise. I had even sized up. She wears a 5T and I ordered a 6T, but they were still the length of a tunic instead of a dress."
3.0,They were OK but I'm disappointed in the frames and the color. All the others are GREAT and I'm going to be an &#34;uptown&#34; Bitch !
3.0,Check the photo out to see what I mean. Great for your little princess!
3.0,If you have a big head this might not be for you.  I have 40 hats that are similar brands and variety so I have some experience.  It is a well made hat.  If you have a medium head this has your name on it.
3.0,"All three of my kids adore this print, even the boys. :) It's just so cheery and cute! This one was for my youngest (2.5) so fits great. But they only fit my newly 5-year-old so-so (elastic a bit snug) and my newly 7-year-old not so much. My oldest is in the 50th percentile in all growth categories (height, weight, head) and there just wasn't enough elastic there for him. Even though though the mask covers his mouth, it's pretty tight on his face, meaning that it moves off his nose when he talks and is uncomfortable on his ears. They actually pull his ears forward. I bought three at a time for him since there was a shipping cost, and now I'm wishing I hadn't!"
3.0,Update:.  I have quite a few pait of these and 3 of them the elastic around the liner is coming off!  It is coming off in the same place on all three pairs.  Hoping I can restitch to fix them but it is clearly a flaw in manufacturing.<br /><br />I just love these!!  So lightweight and comfortable.  I have 2 pair for running and ordering more for regular Summer wear!
3.0,Cute but starchy material not too soft but cute for a night out
3.0,This is a beautiful pin but it has issues.  The pin part is not stable and you really have to put a pin in it to hold it on.  The clip part is ok if you have anything to clip it on.
3.0,"Used gloves cycling this morning 35 degrees,  dry, with high wind in NY. The gloves failed to keep my hands warm. Just ordered silk glove inserts.... Hope they work!"
3.0,You will like these panties if you need a tummy control.  The material is nice and soft also.  I am thin so I have no need for the control.
3.0,My son loves it. The item does run a little small but he is still able to wear it. Won't last long though! However it's definitely a great gift.
3.0,A bit small. More of a fit for women but still very nice quality
3.0,The tops cut to small I needed a XXLarge and my daughter needed a XLarge top I didn't pay attention to the items I thought it came with the bottom so was a little disappointed. I will have to return the items
3.0,"I wish the tint of the lenses was a little darker, can definitely see the eyes of the wearer. Color scheme s are neat"
3.0,Horrible quality. Hated it. Returned. Don’t buy. It’s a piece of felt basically.
3.0,All of them were very small
3.0,"The shirt is very small, more like a 12-18 month shirt then 2T. The image is also very rough to the touch and I'm afraid that it will crack after it's dried. I returned it, it's just not worth the almost $20 price tag."
3.0,Paint chipped way to easy
3.0,Well it was adorable on my toddler until we washed it and it shrunk. Now it doesn’t fit so great anymore sadly.
3.0,I like this brand of jeggings and have numerous pairs in regular length. The problem for me with these is they are much longer than what I would consider Capri length. I'm 5'4&#34; and have to roll them up to keep them from looking like regular pants that I've outgrown. They might be perfect as a full length pant for someone maybe 5'2&#34; or shorter.
3.0,i like it but its freaking HUGE.  Not a fan of rubber bands especially on big watches....It makes you sweat.
3.0,"I’m not sure if they are too small or I am just a bit too tall for them (I’m 5’11” and ordered the large) but these seemed to fit well and looked great until I started walking or running, when they started to fall down. I could get about a block without pulling them up. Super annoying and they are going back."
3.0,El vestido es buena calidad. Sus costuras se ven fuertes. Pero la talla era  xl  y le sirvió a un familiar que medium. Por lo demás todo estaba bien.
3.0,"Looks very nice, but is too large for my head"
3.0,"I loved nearly everything about these except their size.  I consider myself to be conservative when it comes to jewelry, and these were not at all.<br />For some reason, I was under the impression that these would be the height of quarters but they are just about the height of my thumb.  They are also a tad heavy (but like I said, I'm used to wearing tiny hoops and studs)  They hit my shoulders if I so much as crooked my head.<br />Still the design and reference are great though, and I have gotten many compliments."
3.0,I like it for the most part. It’s warm. It’s comfortable. It’s perfect for being in the man cave.  Only problem is it started ripping by the neck area.  I would give it 5 stars if the stitching was better.
3.0,Shorter than Disney’s pins... they stick out a little and can poke and scratch whatever is on the inside. Also not the easiest to use when putting them on pins. Went with this product solely for the price being much less than Disney’s brand.
3.0,If you got some thick thighs these are not for you
3.0,Shirt was too small and not sized properly..
3.0,"Not cute like the picture portrays. I’m 5’4, 135, big boobs. I bought a medium because I’m pregnant. There’s just no shape to it other than square, looks like a grandma shirt. I wanted a cute top, but I don’t feel cute wearing it."
3.0,I will get a smaller size next time.  They were very pretty and I was not disappointed in the way they looked.
3.0,It looked just like a scarf. You could get the same thing at your local beauty supply store for $3-4. Wasn't what I was expecting. and was overpriced imo
3.0,Well made and silky but if you have a need for the larger junk sack ... skip these and stay with Bike or Gym.
3.0,Good ring but it runs small-- need to order the next size up.
3.0,"For the price I would probably buy again but they are a thinner material than I would like. Makes them feel a little cheap but again for the price, not too bad. They'll do the job for work!"
3.0,"It fits ok, just very large at the waist. I had to buy a belt to make it look right :/"
3.0,Love this but the length<br />Not long enough....
3.0,"This is quite small, very small. It works well. But be aware that is such a tiny amount."
3.0,"good looking hat.  but not in the details.<br />its part polyester.<br />chinese quality made. so if it gets thrashed, i won't miss it either.<br />i can make this work, but it won't be my &#34;go to&#34;.<br />of course, i didn't pay too much for it either.<br />so I got what i paid for."
3.0,"I ordered two dresses in the same size (S), one gray and one lavender. Gray fit perfectly but lavender was like a tent draped on me and to send it back. So I'd say &#34;inconsistent sizing&#34;. Would have loved the lavender print if it had fit (fyi, it also did not have pockets). I do like the gray. Material is thin and somewhat sheer on the gray at least so plan on possibly having to wear an undershirt and leggings with it."
3.0,Broke the day i got them
3.0,"I have a small head, like I can use children's sunglasses. And these were too loose. When I looked down they fell off or down my nose. Lost them when I had them pulled up on my head, and they fell loose when I was playing with my kid. She ended up stepping on them by accident 😬"
3.0,"Sizing is a bit off. I'm a 39D and roughly the same since being pregnant,  but the cup size is too small so I've got a uniboob type thing going on with a bit spilling out the sides..  That being said it holds the pumps in place while I pump and that's all I really cares about. The band size is perfect."
3.0,"It runs rather small, so I suggest sizing up."
3.0,"I've purchased numerous Scarleton purses before, but this is the first one I've returned. It looked and felt cheap to me, plus I didn't like the way the shoulder strapped had to be attached if you want to use it as a cross body purse, it was very awkward looking. I ordered the coffee color, it wasn't very pretty. The quality was good, it seemed well made."
3.0,"The yoga pants seem a bit too low waisted, but the length of the leggings were fine.  I had to keep pulling them up after stretching. The quality of the fabric and stitching were fine though."
3.0,"You get exactly what you pay for. Pieces are very pretty but I had to remove immediately as I’m allergic to faux metals. If you don’t have metal sensitivities, these are great!"
3.0,Don't work on touch screens
3.0,"The look is good, the fit is fine. The problem is that it will cease to exist in about 3 or 4 washes in the laundry. Already after 1 wash it is pilling. That's when the cotton gets little balls of fabric all over. Usually thats old shirts or put fabric."
3.0,Looks and feels great but it was too small. Definitely go at least 1 size larger if not 2  .
3.0,I loved this but both zippers on it broke off only having it for about a week.
3.0,I can actually feel the grooves in the sole of the shoe when I walk and this darn shoe cost too much money for that nonsense
3.0,Beautifully color and make but collects moisture in hand
3.0,La tela no es de la calidad que se muestra en la foto
3.0,The bracelet is fine.<br /><br />Just don't be surprised if you get the wrong gold like I did.
3.0,It took quite a while to arrive..the color is pretty and fabric doesn't wrinkle...the lace on the front is not applied in the center of top....so I gave it the 3 stars....I ordered up one size..glad I did.
3.0,"These are cute but I'm not sure how well the belt will stay in place because there are no loops to hold it.  They are cute but I bought an XL and they are a snug around my hips .  Definitely should have bought an XXL because I have about a 41&#34; hip.  They are not the best quality but I will keep them because they weren't that expensive.  If you want them to look like the picture I think these are best suited for girls with skinny legs and a flat bum.  I have bigger thighs and a booty, so these are just ok."
3.0,"The necklace chain looks pretty cheap, but the pendant and earrings are very nice."
3.0,They look fine they just seem to get foggy as soon as you put them on
3.0,Its kind of a thinner material but i could always wear a long sleeve under it. Logos are perfect. Im 5’4 and 115 pounds and i would have went up to a medium if i knew it came in a bit smaller
3.0,"The pants are great, I just wish they sold an option without the zipper pockets. The zippers make it super awkward and frustrating to put my hands in the pocket and even harder to get a phone in and out."
3.0,Ordered regular size for my daughter and had no issue. Wish I had known it came from China and would take 9 weeks to arrive. My main concern however is with the colors... Both shoes light red & cobalt blue then each shoe has different colors that dont match the other... Left had green purple light blue orange... Right had yellow-green pink white yellow.
3.0,Good hat but Santa's were upside down on forehead panel. Literally a upside down santa right in the middle of my forehead:(
3.0,I love it but it's bloody giant. Ordered 6-12 months (90) and it would probably fit my 16 month old nephew. It's beautifully made but the sizing is all over the place judging from other reviews. Do they even care what they put in the bag?
3.0,"So first off, this is a huge bag. I compared it next to my High Sierra Avenger 45L pack and it is a big difference. Let me first mention the features:<br />• comes with rainfly<br />• has two side pockets on left and right that run the length of the body of the bag<br />• has sleeping bag compartment on the bottom of the back that has a zippable divider<br />• has two walking pole straps<br />• has two compartments in the lid of the bag. The outer one is for the rainfly and has one on the inner<br />• has two left and right net pockets for water bottles<br />• each side has straps for sleeping mat, tent, etc.<br />• has waist strap and sternum strap<br />• front zipper to expose the entire inside of the pack making it easy to get what you need without unstraping the lid<br /><br />So those are the main features. The material is a hex shaped pattern. Kind of like ripstop. It seems like a good enough pattern but does not seem heavy duty. This does make it light weight for this size backpack. But my other 45L pack has the same hex pattern material but is very noticably more heavy duty. The outer lid pocket contains the rain cover but takes up a lot of room. I wish they put a dedicated pocket on the bottom for the rain cover like most other packs. The rain cover in that pocket takes up a lot of room. The inner pocket on the lid is small but good for electronics.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have is the padding on the shoulder and waist straps. They are just too soft. At first glance they are nice big deep padding that looks to create a nice gap of air. But once I put it on with a light load, the padding instantly compresses and the entire back of the pack is on your back which does not allow any air flow. If the padding was stiffer a bit it would be way better. I also wish the waist straps had pockets. I can however strap on some molle pouches on it.<br /><br />I do like the side pockets. At first they seem just like slits with a zipper only big enough to put maps or thin items in. But they do flare so that helps expands it outward. So even if you have your main compartment loaded, you can still stuff things in the side pockets with no problem. The front has a zipper pocket that is very thin. This is good for small electronics or maps. The side straps are great for sleeping mats and my tent. I like this better than other bags that you have to strap those items horizontally on the bottom or top.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent pack but the main grips are the thin material and the padding. Normally  that would knock it down only one star but since this pack is so huge, those two things are crucial.<br /><br />I took this out on two backpacking trips and the padding was just too soft under the load I had which was about 35lbs of gear. For an 80L pack, the weight i had should not have been an issue. But because the padding compressed so fast, it wasn't the most comfortable pack to carry. And when that thin material i can see wearing out after a season. I hope I am wrong about that, but on the last two trips, just putting my pack down on the ground, I was fearing it was gonna rip as well as just the load I had inside it.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, this is a good enough pack. I mean it is fully adjustable with the shoulder straps and has straps to adjust the load but compared to just even my budget High Sierra 45L pack, this is subpar."
3.0,"I had to order 2 sizes up from normal.  The top was HUGE but the bottoms fit okay.  Really the leg holes were too tight and low.  This showed absolutely NO cheek, but rather covers your bum like a diaper.  It is also not rouched/roushed in the back like it is in the front, so the back just ends up looking huge and unflattering. Also like a diaper.  Overall not so happy with my purchase, but I could see how it could work on other body types.  If you are not confident in the way your lower back looks (i.e. I have a spare tire that also creates some pudge in the back), you will not like the way this swim suit fits."
3.0,Not bad it works for the money
3.0,These shoes are so comfortable and I loved them until I noticed that after wearing them 3 times (to my office...no long shopping trips) that they aren’t protected on the bottom at the toe and heel. The leather wraps under but there isn’t a sole to protect it. I looked back at the reviews and saw others with the same problem.
3.0,This was really pretty but broke right after I put it on. You can't move when you wear it or it breaks.
3.0,"Size are fit, wore it for 3 weeks and the collar start loosen up, inside the stitches also broken up. Well you got what you paid for. Now I use it as sleeping wear."
3.0,Not as flexible as I hoped. The MOTO 360 has these ridges in the center of the band area that the metal band would get caught on and would bind but good build quality and not too much weight.
3.0,It's really two separate strings of pearls and then then endings were like a pointy clear plastic that I had to cut off because if not it would ruin the dress
3.0,"They are comfortable once you get them on, but they are not as “Easy On/Easy Off” as they claim.  You have to fight with them to get them on, slightly easier to take off, but not easy as portrayed.  Even at the L/XL size they are a bit of a fight to get on past your foot."
3.0,The terry cloth is thinner than I expected and the wrap is too close to armpit
3.0,"Overall I Like it. The elbow pads are a little weird, and it was poorly sewn. There was a 2 inch seam hole. I will fix it myself, but a bit of a bummer to not be able to wear it right away."
3.0,The design is cute but it’s not sweatsuit material (cotton)as it says in title of product. It is shiny stretchy polyester it just looks weird and it too damn hot in Texas for that.<br />And the shirt is not as long as pictured.
3.0,I haven't bought this jean for a few years but it was my favorite. This pair fit okay at first but within an hour quickly loosened up to the point I needed a belt.
3.0,This is a nice shirt. I bought it the day Chadwick passed away as memorabilia.
3.0,"Wanted to love this dress, but the fit was just off, despite it being adjustable. I love the print and the wrap style, but the armpit holes and armpit to armpit measurements were both way too wide."
3.0,Cheap thib material and sloppy
3.0,"The chain looks nice.  It's shiny and it looks good with my pendant.  It's thinner and lighter weight than expected.  The clasp is rather small so it's a little difficult to operate.  But overall, for the price, it's decent."
3.0,I ordred a size up and they fit perfect. I can see where the shine won’t last very long. These are for an aerial dance show and I won’t let my child wear them until that show is over.
3.0,Cute pants.  Runs very small
3.0,I found it a bit uncomfortable
3.0,"I received these shirts last week, and I still haven’t worn it.<br />The tag on the blue one already came off, and the seams look cheaply made.<br />The style is cute and the blue color seems to look like the one advertised.<br />The pink color is way off, it’s more like a soft pink, more brighter than the pictures.<br />They need to work on their sewing, this could be a great product if they work on that."
3.0,Mediums worn as usual were very small in the waist.  The Large fit better.
3.0,"Shorts fit well, except the waist band is tighter than I would like."
3.0,Still made my calf swell and I actually don't have a big calf
3.0,Cute earrings.  Gave it three stars because the backing keeps  coming loose and the earring falls out.  I tried with a different backing but still came loose.
3.0,"I got this for 19.00 on a Amazon lightning deal.  I'd say it's worth 19.00 definitely not worth 47.00.  I think the feel of the cork material is very nice.  The product is very durable.  For me the problem was that the wallet is very stiff, and way to large for my taste.  I thought that maybe the wallet would break in and soften, up but after 5 months it has not. To be fair the only reason I give this a 3 stars is just because of personal taste not liking large stiff wallets. The seller should not advertise this wallet as &#34;slim&#34;, slim it is not."
3.0,"Could be better.  I feel like the glasses (as a whole) are small.  They fit my head/face fine, but I would prefer the lenses to be a bit further apart - I first felt like I was wearing children's sunglasses... can't beat the price though."
3.0,I am 5'9 and 215 pounds. The jumpsuit is long but the length of waist is too short. Didn't really blouse like on the pic😪
3.0,"Sometimes you get a synthetic fabric blend that feels natural, or at least soft and pliable, with a little bit of drape to it.<br /><br />This 90% Polyester 10% Rayon blend looks and feels like a 90% Polyester 10% Rayon blend, making it not particularly comfortable and not particularly attractive."
3.0,"Super super cute! Love the fit and material. But beware, the floral design on the sleeves is applique, not stiched in. (Daaaaangit I know. But I guess what can I expect with a shirt this price??)"
3.0,Is ok thought it was going to be of a little better quality!
3.0,The white on the white and blue is transparent. I like the print but am debating whether it's worth wearing something under it or not.
3.0,Beautiful watch band and great feel to it the only problem is I measured my wrist and it's 7.7 inches and this Watch band barely fits it they advertised just over 8 inches
3.0,"The dress is really really cute!!! Too bad it does not fit as expected. I am short 5 feet and weight 120lbs and usually wear a medium, but this dress was still tight on me around the arms, stomach and thighs. Did not look good on me. Maybe i should order a large for it to fit right."
3.0,"So the materials are quite flimsy, although the buckle does stay together. I have no clue what that notch piece at the end is for, but it often gets caught up on belt loops as you are trying to undo it. Overall, I would say this is so-so at best."
3.0,"Hand fit is good, but the fingers are almost a inch to long."
3.0,"The band is made with attention, the stitching matches the color or the leather which is nice. The hardware that attaches to the watch is nondescript and is functional but not aesthetically pleasing. The band looks nice but definitely not the look or quality of Hermès band it imitates. The biggest drawback is you cannot make it fit snug enough and the watch keeps losing contact with skin frequently and keeps locking up. I stopped wearing it for that reason. Hermès band has a ridge on the inside of the band that makes it fit snugger to the skin to prevent issues like that , I suppose."
3.0,"Overall this bag seems okay but the smell of plastic when opening the box was too much for me, we returned this.  It is definitely on the cheaper side (see price) so the material is flimsy and wrinkly.  But if you could get over the smell (maybe air it out a bit) I would say it would be good for someone who needs a large beach/pool bag.  Definitely convenient to be able to see through the bag to the contents so you aren't blindly feeling around the bottom of the bag, and the size is awesome!"
3.0,"fine precut, well made. I am expecting many years of use. My last belt was worn for over forty years. The only complaint I have is with size. The closest size for me is 36&#34;. But this belt, even tightened to the narrowest, barely holds my pants up where they should be! My take is that as our population gets fatter, makers are readjusting their sizes. I've seen this in shirts and some other items and belts now seem to have undergone a waist change. Too bad."
3.0,Looks a little different in person than it does in the photo.
3.0,I wear a size 12 and I ordered this in XXL and it fit snug. It's a very cute top and the material is good quality. Just runs smaller than what is said on the Asian size chart.
3.0,"Runs pretty big. Ordered a size 10 and it still slides around. Titanium is really strong but really light. Looks pretty cool, I like the simulated diamond."
3.0,"So I got them and let me just say they came pretty fast. We all know they are fake but they are very good fakes! I have like 6 pair of legit yeezys I’ve gotten from yeezy supply , goat what have you and I was gonna buy the real ones on stock x and granted I’ve spent 400+ on shoes before I just couldn’t see spending 150 on socks that will eventually get holes in them, plus how stock x is moving it takes forever to get your stuff so this was option b and I’m happy about it. I’ve never bought anything fake before  but yoo no one will know ... 👀"
3.0,"This was a pretty nice suit, just not suitable for women. Top was too big and bottoms were too small."
3.0,"must take care when washing, fits as advertised, quality is the issue."
3.0,Material was ok but was way smaller then expected.  I would definitely go up a size.  Slit is also very wide so impossible to wear regular bra.
3.0,"I ordered this a wedding bracelet for my wedding but when it arrived, it did not meet my expectations. It was rather tight on my wrist and just didn't pop like i expected and wanted it to so i returned it."
3.0,Its a well made product but I'm convinced its sized for preteens.  The actual cord connecting the headphones is too small so you can't even stretch it. I'll give it to my younger brother but I'll have to find another for myself.
3.0,Have a special needs child that will only were those ones!! Price was high but I needed them
3.0,"I returned this dress because the sleeves have an elastic band that was WAY too tight around my upper arms, and I would say I have very average sized arms."
3.0,"Very cute top and I love the cutout in the back because it isn't to big. However, the material is a little thinner then what I was expecting."
3.0,"Not a good look. The front cross-over panel is too large and just kind of hangs. Fabric, however, feels great."
3.0,"GOOD STURDY GLASSES, NOT THE DIMENSIONS LISTED THOUGH"
3.0,I thought these were cute but when I put them on they were long on my feet and didn't look good.  I thought they were a bit softer than I wanted/ Needed.  Cute for someone with prettier feet I think.  I returned them.
3.0,Wear this for the first time and while at church the inside garter on the shoulder snapped so it's now loose. Trying to return this but return window is closed already.
3.0,Looks nicer pictured than in person.  Looks like just a piece of material put together without sewing the edges. It is fine for the price - but I probably could have made the same thing for cheaper.
3.0,"super cute piercing , however… it made my nose smell funky all the time ! even after cleaning it ."
3.0,Just put all my kids items in bag and it’s much lighter and functional than my old bag. I was missing a stroller strap though that’s why I give it 3 stars. I’d have to return it and wait for another one to get the other strap. Unfortunately I needed the bag now.  Not thrilled with “wet wipe” part on side. Needs bigger opening so you can actually put the baby wipes in it and be able to put the wipes without pulling the wipes out the pocket.
3.0,Color of the shirt is darker than what was advertised
3.0,It’s a beautiful band a little small and not the softest material
3.0,I bought an XL and it is not oversized like the picture. I would say go up at least a size to achieve. Very cute dress though and the fabric is super soft! If they offered plus sizes i would definitely order up and reorder.
3.0,"I want to like these, but there is something about the frame that is just so odd.  Everyone asks me if I am wearing them upside down.  I like the lens color and the design, except for the flip in the shape that makes them look like they are upside down."
3.0,"I bought this tank in the color coffee. When it arrived, I really liked the color.  I put it on and didn't like the fit at all. I am 5'3"" and weigh about 140. I tend to be either a small or medium. I ordered a small (based on some of the reviews) but it was really constricting in the chest area. I am of average size (definitely not big chested) and this was way too tight. The bottom half was just the opposite..extremely loose and flowy. Maybe a medium would have fit better, but I didn't like the overall appearance. I returned it."
3.0,"I would like it if it wasn't way too small for a L.  I can't even wear it, unfortunately it will have to go in the Goodwill box."
3.0,I was looking for a wallet in which I can carry my credit card and also my iphone 6s.  The size and pockets are perfect but the smell of the wallet itself is horrible. I tried to use it for a week but after the week I gave up. It have this plasticy fishy smell.
3.0,Everyone is right about it being small
3.0,"This is a very cute charm with nice detail -but don't be deceived by the pictures that show it worn as a necklace or a single item bracelet, as they are not at all to scale and very deceiving. It's also a bit smaller than the dimensions given in the description. Therefore, in my opinion it's only suited for use as one of many charms on a charm bracelet. As a necklace, it would even look tiny on an infant. So, not what I wanted and quite disappointing."
3.0,I just love this short but it is made way smaller then how they label the size.
3.0,"I usually wear an xl but after reading that this can large, I ordered a large which turned out to be too big for me."
3.0,I did not like the top. I should have  gotten one with a &#34;contour&#34; bra. I am a 36B and the bra is too big. I don't like the wires on the bra.
3.0,It was probably a returned item. Glasses was slightly bent. The package was already opened and the bag was oily/dirty.
3.0,"I loved these when I first ordered them and wore them all summer but then one of the arms broke off which is my fault,  so I ordered a second pair and the arms are completely different from the first pair. They are half the width of the first pair which is very disappointing."
3.0,Really doesn’t wear comfortably
3.0,I was a little disappointed.  It looks ok but hangs down lower that I thought it would.  My biggest complaint is the clasp is very hard and frustrating to deal with.
3.0,Functional but ugly.  Works great but my wife and daughter won't be seen with me wearing them
3.0,"They're very pretty, very classy,  but they aren't red. They're maroon."
3.0,Its okay for what it is. The sleeves are really short. I have short arms and they are too short on me. Its cheaply made.
3.0,eh its ok it turned my gfs finger green where it was siting
3.0,The quality was a mesh necklace not what I thought
3.0,Very pretty print and nice material but did not fit correctly
3.0,"I have no memory of trying this on, but I returned it, so it must be pretty bad"
3.0,"I bought these ones because they were half of what our local store was selling them for and with my daughter being new to dance, I didn't want to invest a lot of money in it until I could see how she did and if she wanted to continue with it. I guess these fit as expected given the size options. We pulled the string to make these 11s fit my preschooler's 10 1/2 foot, but it ended up digging into her heel and she was messing with her shoes during the entire class. After I put bandaids on her heels, she did ok. I don't think these ones grip as well as others. I suppose depending on your dance style, this may be preferred - but for my 3-year-old, she's fallen quite a bit because of it. That could also be because she's new, but she also had kids younger than her in class and less coordinated and they didn't fall as much. The construction otherwise seems fine. We'll stick with them for now, but if she keeps falling a lot of still has a problem with the fit, I'll probably end up buying those more expensive ones."
3.0,Hard to get in and out of! Looks good
3.0,I wish i could keep them.. Earring themselves are very pretty and looks very beautiful and for the gold look they are actually light weight which i liked a lot. But .. the inserts are too big for my ears i tried my best but could not push them in as hard as i tried.plus the insert is so small i doubt it will even come out of the ear the push button to secure the insert is very small and not easy to put on.<br />If you have big earring holes might work out for you .. i wish they has normal inserts so i could keep them .. but for these reasons i am forced to return these.
3.0,"I guess I should have read the reviews before I bought this belt because I didn't see that it was only '22 inches. It does stretch to fit around my waist, but I have to suck in and the slightest movement feels like it may break. ( I'm 5'6 155 pounds) The belt its self looks just like the picture, very pretty, love the look, just wish it was a bit bigger."
3.0,I’m usually an XL but this shirt fit like a XXXL and was of the heaviest fabric known to man. It should be marketed as the first short sleeve winter shirt
3.0,"They are very pretty and seem well made, we had to return them because the size/fit was too small."
3.0,Great material fits a little too loose too see through
3.0,"These socks are nice because they are light.  However, the sticky dots came off after only a few uses in Pure Barre classes."
3.0,When I received these I was so excited because I was thinking if they would be thicker not so heavy but little more solid and they wasn’t I’m afraid that I could break them because they are so thin . But they are cute
3.0,"This item is sized very small, the xl looked more like a medium. But the fabric is nice and the embroidery is lovely. It would be great if it was actually in women's sizes."
3.0,"I liked the color and material, however after inspecting the front I notice that it had dirty spot."
3.0,"It’s silky soft, but it feels kinda cheap (obviously though, i wasn’t expecting anything fantastic for the price). My biggest issue is that it will not stay closed no matter how much you overlap it or how tight you tie it, the second you move your arms your chest is out lol"
3.0,Beautiful septum ring but i had to pry it open some because the closure was too tight. It was extremely hard to open and close before i made the adjustments.
3.0,It’s a nice shirt but it’s hot fabric. And the check is not as deep as it shows in the picture.
3.0,very long torso'd
3.0,not comfortable on the top area
3.0,I didn't try it on because I was immediately disappointed in the color.  I wanted a Christmas green color dress like it appeared in the picture but it was a light apple green.  So I returned it.
3.0,"2 of the 3 seem to fit fine, going along with the suggestions of the comments of getting a Large while I normally wear Medium. The remaining one is small, which is the paint splat looking one. They are all labeled Large, maybe it was misprinted info."
3.0,Tags are made of a strong plastic and seem to hold up well. Only complaint is there is no plastic sleeve to protect the paper address tag which has not held up well on a daily use. I’m going to laminate a card and use inside the hard plastic sleeve instead but wish I didn’t have to hassle it.
3.0,Very comfortable but the pattern rubs off. This will be a white watch band before long 🥲
3.0,"Not made as well as it looks, would rather pay a little more for BETTER quality."
3.0,Fit to close to face....sweat!
3.0,"I'm not sure the size is correct. The flare is unusually larger than any other tunnels I've ever had. I guess that's good if you're worried about them falling out. I bought with the intent of stretching up, but i removed them because as previously stated, I do not trust the size. Prompt shipping."
3.0,"cute little watch, but it doesn't keep very good time.  I have to reset the tiime every couple of days."
3.0,Chain was delivered broken in the package.  It looked like it was packaged already broken.  The watch itself seems ok as of now. It is supposed to be a gift.
3.0,"I had higher expectations, and even ordered a size up based off of the reviews, but it is a short dress on my 5'3&#34; frame. The fit is OK, but the slight is super high and the material is thin, so it's slightly see through. It would work as a swimsuit cover-up, but I probably won't wear it outside the vicinity of the pool."
3.0,"I purchased these for my daughter who is very sensitive to any metals except for stainless steel. I thought this was a great deal for three pairs of earrings & different color finishes. They look really nice in the picture but when they arrived I wasn't as impressed with them. They look cheap up close & in person,the prongs that hold the stones in are thin & look a little flimsy. The finish on the isn't the greatest either, it shows when you unscrew the ball off of the end. However they do look good from a distance & when your wearing them in your ears those things aren't noticeable. They balls screw off & on with no problems, no weird threading or anything, just smooth threads. My daughter does like them & wears them often. I wouldn't purchase them again if I had seen how they really look. *Disclaimer* I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I only review products that I am willing to purchase & use regularly. I am a consumer that relies on reviews from others to help make purchasing decisions on in store & on line purchases. All of my reviews are 100% honest based on my experience with the product."
3.0,Really cute and sexy! It fits nicely except in the chest area. I had to pin the back of it.
3.0,It’s very cute but too small.
3.0,This dress was purchased for a post-twin baby body.  I am 5 foot and currently almost 140 lbs (again post twin baby body...)  The item was very cute but the material was extremely thin and you could see through it.  It was not as flowy below the umpire waist that the picture let on.  The blue is not bright; it is more of a navy blue.
3.0,"I measured my head to compare it to the specs in the description. My measurement was at the bottom of the range in the specs, so I didn't expect it to be tight, but it is somewhat snug for me and gives me a slight headache if I pull it on completely. It's okay when I wear it just slightly loose and use the chin strap to keep it on if it's windy.  So I've decided to keep it, though I'm hesitant to get another color as I'd been thinking I might. It would definitely be way too small for anyone with a head circumference in the upper end of the spec range in the description, but it might be perfect for someone with a slightly smaller head."
3.0,"These shoes were so pretty and exactly as the video described but the sizing was a bit off. I ordered a size 3yr and they sent me a size 20, which is their size 2-3. I think a size 3-4 (22) may have worked but I opted for a refund."
3.0,A bit too large and not the best material quality.
3.0,Just did not fit.
3.0,Return blouse because it was not as expected.
3.0,It's cute and I like it but I wear an XL and bought a 2XL to make sure it fits and it's not even close to fitting!
3.0,The product seemed dry. Maybe it was old
3.0,"I've been looking for a white cardigan for summer to wear over sleeveless dresses in a cold office.  The weight on this cardigan would be perfect for summer, but the white is NOT white.  It's more of an ivory color and was not the color I wanted so I returned it.  Otherwise, it would have been exactly what I needed."
3.0,This shirt design is great fits way smaller than expected
3.0,"Not the product I expected, instead I got the one that has the two crowns in the set. I wanted ALL cones so the kids wouldn't fight for the crowns! Frustrating. Too late to reorder.Ughh."
3.0,"I going to return it is to big for me, is good for somebody with long hair or big head"
3.0,I was not happy with the bounce I was still getting wearing this bra. I normally wear a 38 DD. It fit well but just did not do what I wanted.
3.0,Order a size larger than you think you need.  The bottom is stiff and thin.
3.0,"Loved the color and the style. It was well made and I loved all the pockets.  BUT.... if you buy it thinking a 11inch tablet will fit in the y’all zipper pockets it won’t. The zippers do not go all the way to each side of the purse making the openings narrow.<br /><br />I bought it to use for work to carry my tablet and or small laptop, a few files and some personal items. It has to be one or the other......<br /><br />Returning because it’s not true to description size."
3.0,"I got these in a 4x, but the size runs smaller. They fit more like a 2 to 3x. I ended up giving these to my teenage daughters. They are way smaller than me, and it fit them perfectly fine. So just be wary when you pick a size. Other than that they are super cute, and the fabric is nice."
3.0,I bought medium first because that’s my size and then realized that it’s too big. So I ordered small size and it still did not fit right because it was too big. So this particular product runs big in sizes and the color was not the same but I kept it because I simply did not want to return it again
3.0,Not as nice as it looks in the picture....
3.0,This sleep shirt has a large a neckline.  It fit around my hips but it did not look good.<br /><br />It was a comfortable Fabric.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for letting me return it!
3.0,Perfect fit for a 5 y/o.
3.0,"As a plus size woman this top is a loose flowing in body, longer than a regular top, but if you have any upper arm flab you will not like how the sleeves are tight and bunchy. I couldn't wear this for more than 10 minutes before I had to get it off as it was hurting. The material is very thin and flowing and the color was great. It is made in China which is why the size of the sleeves are off a bit from that of the U.S.  I gave my daughter this top as she is smaller than I am in the arms and it looks great on her and fits her well."
3.0,"look nice, but to short and tight on shoulders. returned"
3.0,"Fit sort of big on myself. But i could not go down a size as the band around does not stretch. If it did, i would have been able to go down a size.<br />Was not able to wear it for what i intended to. So i may return it as it doesnt fit well."
3.0,"This dress doesn’t exactly look like the photo. Also, it took so long to arrive that it is not eligible for a return."
3.0,Extremely small waistline - who's built this way?
3.0,Great quality. Size was smaller than expected. Requested return and have not heard from the seller.
3.0,A bit longer than expected
3.0,I like the material but they run small. I would size up if you plan on ordering these.
3.0,"Sadly, I had to return. Not the shape I expected."
3.0,It wasn’t as classy as I thought it would be. Very difficult to put on and take off.
3.0,"My husband absolutely loves these socks, but they did not last very long. He really liked the arch support, and the sock never slips off the ankle."
3.0,"Such a cute tank, but there was too much fabric where it crossed in the back.  It didn't lay right."
3.0,"Changed colour , I have to keep cleaning."
3.0,"Color is good. The way the clasp works is odd, but ok. It's also a bit on the loose side, which can be fixed quickly on a sewing machine. BTW, I wear size 14.  Since I want to get belts in a few colors to go with lots of new clothes (lost several pounds recently), I appreciate the modest price."
3.0,Overall fit was mediocre. The front draped funny so I returned it.
3.0,Visor was smaller than I expected.
3.0,I can see my skin through the material. Socks should be thicker than air.
3.0,"Card holders are loose so all keep slipping out. Not exactly great, but does the job."
3.0,Cheap screened type not embroidered
3.0,The dress I received looks nothing like the picture....but it’s not terrible. It has a cute fit!
3.0,It is Just nice
3.0,The colors were fantastic but these have a very strong odor which I hope will go away with time. They're a bit more slippery than others I have tried. The bright colors made it easy to spot our family's suitcases on a recent trip.
3.0,Comfy and thigh high but roll down when the reach my thigh but if you use garters it should be fine
3.0,I received the key rings but there were no jump rings with them like in the picture. I was disappointed because now I also have to go buy those.
3.0,"They are very thin, but good for the price!"
3.0,"I like this suit for the most part. The shorts under the swim dress are brilliant and the color is lovely. A few things:<br />The straps are a little long.<br />The underwires are a bit aggressive and potentially not sewn in super tight so they poke you if you are laying on an inner tube or something.<br />When the front of the bodice gets wet, it gets really loose and makes you look like you have saggy boobs.<br />I will be sewing some modifications for the things that I found to be lacking, but otherwise, it fits well and overall is quite flattering."
3.0,material is in a sick as some of the other ones the pocket still aren't the same as described as the pictures shown since he really gets white if it's stretched too far
3.0,"This looks really cute on the website but when I got it, it was not as expected. It’s not much different than pictured. I expected a different material than what it is. You definitely need to size up when ordering"
3.0,Cute shirt but small fit.
3.0,It does fit as expected but the color seems so faded. I returned it because it wasn’t a deep burgundy like I wanted but I do have it in black and I love it so I do recommend the dress. Just not in this reddish color.
3.0,"Not crazy about this top. I tend to like more spandex in my suits, doesn’t seem to be any! This just seems to be made rather cheaply!<br /><br />I wish this was better constructed. The boning up the sides isn’t very strong.<br /><br />I kept this for use at my home pool but would wear it in public."
3.0,"Can wear it walking 10+ miles and I can still walk with little pain/soreness when I take them off. And they don't slip down! Highly recommend.<br /><br />Edit: ordered more socks after the ones I initially bought were getting thin and stretched out. The new batch of socks, unfortunately, have been wearing down after a couple of uses and lose their compression. I'll likely buy different socks in the future."
3.0,a little hard to read. the words &#34;Dog&#34; are bigger than &#34;mom&#34;. also thought I ordered a sky blue color - it was green in person.
3.0,"Suit looks very nice on although a little too high wasted. The problem is,  although the suit is very  becoming, it is only for sitting around in, not swimming. The straps are made of very stretchy fabric that stretch more when wet. I was afraid if I were to dive or try to swim in the suit, the top would not stay put. the stretchy back strap wouldn't hold it in place so it would slide up over my breasts."
3.0,Cute but too big for my face..
3.0,Dont expect quality its cheap plastic material!
3.0,"Yes, it fits great, but the quality of the material is whatever.<br /><br />After the first wash, there is some fabric that is coming apart. Also, with the white colorway, don't expect to wear this shirt as a standalone - as you can see your nipples through this shirt."
3.0,What do you expect from a solar cooling hat? You are not going to be wining any fashion competitions.
3.0,Fit nicely but absolutely no moisture wicking. Wouldn't recommend being very active while wearing them.
3.0,Cute frames but lens fell out the same day. Was able to pop it back in though
3.0,I just wish they came as a pair not separate.
3.0,When I bought this product I thought it was a great idea but when I went to use it it didn’t fit. It was really small like for a child. I thought maybe I bought the wrong size but I didn’t see that it Specified a size. I gave them to my nephews. They have no problem with them.
3.0,"This product looks amazing and was working great but I haven't used it for even a month and it tore. It's not a crucial part but it's still not what you want to see happen, kinda bums me out."
3.0,"Nice headband, but if you’re looking for the embroidered Nike sign, this isn’t it. This one has the sticker"
3.0,Didn’t like the fabric feel.
3.0,"I liked most everything except the length.  They are a little short and ride up with more movement. I purchased a larger size because my stomach isn't flat, usually a 2XLT works. They are moisture wicking and comfortable in the chest and arms."
3.0,Cute but very poor quality
3.0,"Seller OK, but product just regular."
3.0,Does the job. Keeps mask off your face. Prevents mask when wet with condensation from sticking to your face and causing frostbite when outdoors in freezing temps.
3.0,It is pretty out of the box.  But is a little boxy in shape and reminds me of doctor scrubs.  It feels like it was cut with two dimensions instead of three in mind.  It does not slim.  I don't like the rolled half sleeve.  It just takes up more space when I try to layer.
3.0,the shoes are pretty.  feels good when walking.  the buckle is another story.  not enough holes to buckle them and  the buckle has some sort of charm hanging from it that gets in the way when you go to buckle your shoe.  do i recommend these?  if you have the patience to fiddle with the buckle then go ahead.  otherwise shop around.
3.0,"Look, you can't go wrong with NASA.  The world always needs reminders of the program, and of its and science's contributions to society... as they say, ""NASA technology is all around you.""<br /><br />So, love the logo.  Beyond that it gets a little sketchy.  The t-shirt, which seems to run true to size, is nice but made of a thinner material than I would have liked... and the logo itself is made of thicker material than I would have liked.  I have done some DIY projects with youth in my life that involve transfer of artwork onto a shirt via a hot iron process, and the instructions for preserving the art are a lot like those that come with this shirt.  It's a t-shirt you have to wash inside out, you have to wash in cold water, you have to tumble dry on low or hang dry.  The logo doesn't feel like part of the shirt, it feels like a thick object in front of the shirt, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />And for $15, when you can get the same type of shirt with the same logo from other manufacturers for $10, well, if I could do it over again I'd skip this one, and maybe even buy it directly from NASA's 'shop' site."
3.0,The main thing that stood out when I opened the package was how it looked. I honestly can’t pinpoint why it doesn’t look as good as apples sport band but you can tell there’s a huge difference. Maybe the holes are bigger? Or the spacing is different but I couldn’t put myself to wear it. It also feels cheap and thin. I’ve bought other sports bands on amazon that  didn’t have this problem. The bands were flimsy and looks way to small when you wear it because of how thin it is. Unfortunately I wouldn’t use these sport bands.
3.0,"Top fit fine, but bottoms were a little tight, so I had to return.  But a cute suit."
3.0,If you plan to wear the sleeves on your shoulders your bra straps will show no matter what you do so plan on a strapless bra. Also the material is very thin. I was disappointed by this dress. From the pictures I thought it would look nicer.
3.0,Was a gift so I really don't know how they worked out.
3.0,"I bought these for my 13 year old who’s almost 5’6. These were supposed to be for “tall” people, but they were super short and ended up fitting my 12 year old who’s 4’11!!! The legs are short, but the waist/hip area was big. My 12 year old wears them, but has to roll the waist down so they fit her waist better. The shape of these is very bizarre!"
3.0,"The fit is okay, but this shirt wrinkles far too easily.  And if you are like me and just throw your shirts in the dryer instead of ironing, forget it."
3.0,It's either too big or too small when  you add or remove a link. I've worn mine for about a week and the back is already showing copper beneath. I do love the style and uniqueness of yhe bracelet.
3.0,SIZES SHOULD BE IN INCHES INSTEAS OF CM!!!! SLOW SHIPPING!!!!
3.0,Product arrived wrinkled.
3.0,Super cute! Lots of compliments but the bows are not attached
3.0,Ties were ok looking. Not great
3.0,"Regardless that the gown is black, it’s is see through."
3.0,I read that returns were free not it looks like I will be charged to return them. Not right. They are not as pictured.  Really long not crop pants.
3.0,There is alot of material. I have such a small frame that it can be hard to get a good fit with this style.  Its cute but because its one size i feel like i am wearing a moo moo. I am small at 5'6 and 112lbs so it probably fits better with a few more pounds on me!
3.0,Black pair seems to seal great and prevents fogging but blue pair seals great but fogs constantly even with anti fog products.
3.0,Purchased as a gift. They are not very large. They seemed to enjoy them. Perfect for a young couple
3.0,They fit fine length wise. I am 5 ft 9 and they sat well on me. Only issue I had was they kept sliding down. I used them for a halloween costume so I had to wear leggings underneath so they wouldn’t slide down
3.0,"These shoes are adorable and good quality, but as other reviewers wrote the heel strap slips off while you are walking. The heels did come with gel pad inserts which were great! I normally don’t wear heels so my feet hurt anyway, and it was hard to navigate with the heel strap on. If you need heels for looks and not a lot of walking, these are perfect."
3.0,Warmed up toes and wede nicely packed.<br />Sewn tip finish makes trimming difficult to shape. MY size 10 Lady's boots aren't long enough for the 9.5 innersole!
3.0,"Way too loose, looked like a moomoo"
3.0,"These were really nice looking shorts and with zipper side pockets!  I was excited to receive them, however I ordered an XXL and they were more like a Medium and I had to send them back.  Wish there were true to size so I could keep them.  I would have ordered more if they had fit. Disappointing!"
3.0,They have fallen apart in less than two months!
3.0,"Even though I ordered a whole size smaller, they were too big (and clunky)"
3.0,Not as described!  Not thick or cushioned at all. Good fit however
3.0,Wristband too small. Pinches and hard to put on. Would not recommend if you don't have petite bone structure.
3.0,"Squat proof, pretty thick, not very soft but they work For the price"
3.0,"I love the pattern, flow, and style. The skirt does fit a bit small and offers no give with its chiffon-like material. This issue can be resolved with a size up or chunky sweater to cover."
3.0,Good product though
3.0,"They are cute but don't fit close to your body, a bit baggy."
3.0,Water leaks through it. But it's ok for cooking. Little on the small side but it's good enough.
3.0,but haven't got it to keep time yet... taking it to a jeweler to see if we are setting it right
3.0,"It runs small for its' size. I am a seven but this one is small, keeps feet too hot bc it's fake leather and not making you really tone up....but thats true for all tone up shoes. It's kind of cute and people compliment me on my hikes but still not a great shoe."
3.0,"Great mask, great thickness for the cold. One major problem, the drawstring on the mask does not work, I've purchased multiple masks to only have the same issue. Extremely disappointed"
3.0,"I’m a size 12, small on top, ordered my usual size, L, it was much too small. I was hoping to wear it over leggings, but it’s not nearly long enough. Tight through the shoulders, and too snug around my belly."
3.0,"Very very cute nightgowns!!! But they fit smaller than expected. I got my girls' typical sizes they normally wear which were 4, 6, 8-10. My two year wears the size 4 dresses. My 4 year old needs to wear the size 6, my 6 year old needs to wear the size 8-10. My 8 year old would need size 10-12."
3.0,"Well made, but not flattering - unless you really are pregnant.<br />I wear this for yoga, laundry day, and anything where I'm not trying to make an impression.<br />It is a comfortable shirt."
3.0,runs a little small if your planning on buying this i’d recommend getting a size bigger than you usually would purchase mine was a little to small on the arms but overall it was a good quality karasuno uni jacket
3.0,The material is very stretchy which does not work well with the cut. It doesn't really stay in place and the skirt isn't really as full as pictured above.
3.0,"The quality of the leather is decent with good stitching, but it is lighter colored than the image."
3.0,"I live in Florida.Needless to say we love our tank tops & sun dress.This top was perfect. It is lightweight, gorgeous colors & flattering. I got XLG fits perfectly."
3.0,Was too sheer for me but it fit well!
3.0,The clasp is virtually impossible to secure with one hand.  Only a magician can accomplish this.  I have made multiple attempts and spent a lot of time but have not been successful one time so I cannot wear this bracelet unless some one else closes the clasp for me.
3.0,Beautiful but very thin noisy wear another mask under for safety.
3.0,"The necklace was just as described but the color is what I didn’t like. It’s too yellow, you could tell it’s not real gold."
3.0,"Wear a 10, got the 11/12, but they are still a bit tight across the top so can't wear too long. Warm and comfortable otherwise."
3.0,"i bought because i liked the pattern I like things with stars its not great but I am keeping it anyway because of the pattern. the fabric is a mesh overlay so the skirt is lined but the top is not so it will need a cami. the waist measurements are a bit large my waist is 32 and i got the large i wanted more length and i was planning on belting it anyway its not tight in the waist so that measurement must be the relaxed non stretched numbers.  The waist also sits a bit higher than natural waist but again planned on belting it anyway so no big deal. it is short I'm 5'2 ish and if i raise my arms the lining of the skirt is just covering my butt forget bending over. my fix for this was to wear with leggings and i could see from the picture that it was going to need this. all in all doable with accessories, ok for the price ( I paid 18.99)but not great"
3.0,"I wish other colors had been available in my size.  Not crazy about this palette.  Otherwise, no complaints."
3.0,I used the shorts for my flag football uniform got my actual size and the shorts were a little tight .
3.0,"very pretty,  made for kids though."
3.0,"This is a once size fits all shirt. Even though it's pretty, it doesn't really fit all."
3.0,Ordered this shirt for my Husband who fishes quite often. I love the idea of the shirt because this is something I hear quite a bit  &quot;just one more&quot;. I was slightly disappointed when we received the shirt because it was a lighter heather blue and not the solid dark navy that is in the picture. The logo of the lures is not as vibrant and sharp as pictured. The shirt looks a little short and the material feels a little cheap like it might shrink up when we wash it. Over all I was slightly disappointed for receiving some that doesn't look like the picture but My Hubby liked the way it looked and put it on right away.
3.0,Don't know it was a gift for my navy daughter....on a ship somewhere.
3.0,They looked to be the retro style Thai shorts but they are cut wider than I expected
3.0,Like the Length. Do Not like the Collar.
3.0,This top is absolutely adorable and seemed to be made well however its not for a short person. I'm 5'2 and it came right above the knees to long for a shirt but also not the style to be worn as a dress so sadly had to return
3.0,Looks nice on but it should have been made like the picture. It had no shape to it just plain straight down. If I had more time to order something else I would have only thing looked the picture was split.
3.0,"its see thru , so people can see your eyes!<br />fits really good!"
3.0,Little short I'm not very tall at all maybe 5.5 bent over a bit and my underwear shows because of the gap in the dress
3.0,Fun party set!!!
3.0,I ordered a medium and it was just huge.  I am normally a medium size.
3.0,"Item didn't look as how the picture depicted it. Dissapointed, but it was cheap so that's okay. Will update with a picture soon to show what I'm talking about"
3.0,"This watch is very cute but very difficult to select anything on the screen, even for my 7 year old's tiny fingers. It has cute features, though."
3.0,Was a little bit longer than I expected. Other than that it’s cute. I am 5’7” for reference.
3.0,Runs very small… will be returning when I have time!
3.0,"Came fast, looks great, giving it 3 stars because when i took it out the package is smelled sour, and inky!"
3.0,"Measurements were off, ordered a small but was way too snug and the length was 2” shorter than what was indicated."
3.0,"These are great but not true to size. I am a 6.5/7 women’s and ordered a size 7-8 women’s and they smush the big toe so much I ordered again in a size bigger. If you are a 7/8 these will not fit you, do yourself a favor and go up at least one size."
3.0,"I didn't expect much, considering how cheap they were. One strap came apart after just a single use. It's still somewhat useable. Again, you get what you pay for."
3.0,Too small around the chest and then the material is very straight cut from the chest to the bottom. Not very flattering if you are curvy.
3.0,"Beautiful, but caused my ears to go red and full of pus. Be careful if you're allergic to certain base metals."
3.0,"Thin material , cut on the small side go a size up for a good fit.  Not the best but worth the price."
3.0,Perfect dress up dress or flower girl dress for the money
3.0,"it's okay, wish it was firmer in the gut area."
3.0,I love this dress but the plus size runs small.  I wear an 18-20 in dresses.  I had to exchange the 2X for a 3X.  The 3X fits perfectly.
3.0,"I like this shirt but I can't say that I totally love it.  The green is a gorgeous color and true to the photo.  I was hoping the fit would be a bit more flowy and &#34;slouchy&#34; for some casual comfort but it is a little snug.  However, I still quite like it and will be keeping it."
3.0,Was smaller than expected. Other than that great.
3.0,"I have this strap over a year now, it was worn ones a week maybe less often. Strap is good, design is great, silicon is nice and soft but durability is week."
3.0,"Be prepared to wear with a tank underneath or as a layering piece. It’s a cute top, but was hoping to wear alone with a skirt…"
3.0,Comfortable shoes. Cute with any outfit. The material is not leather but they still look good.
3.0,"The 3x was 33"" long prior to washing and 30"" after washing and drying on low.  My boyfriend is 6'1 and it barely went below his waist. If he raises his arms his belly would show.  I have purchased Gildan tshirts before but they were much better quality than this.  Please use better quality shirts because I love your designs!"
3.0,It was bigger than her feet
3.0,Super cute but within 2 weeks the velcro was worn out. Unvelcros multiple times a day.
3.0,"We’re very cute the first time but after a wash or two , the elastic began to turn around and twist . No longer can I wear these. Don’t buy."
3.0,"It is not true to size, its SMALL but great picture and quality!"
3.0,"The leather is a bit on the stiff side but I didn't have any problems with it. The biggest problem however was that once you put it on, the strap would loosen after a few minutes and had to be tightened very frequently. Bought this once and enjoyed the time with it but I wouldn't plan to buy it again and would get something of higher quality."
3.0,cute shoes but my advice buy the bigger size than needed as your infant probably won't last long in them due to the small size.  I guess American feet are larger.
3.0,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It’s May and it’s faded where the two charms rub together. Now I see it’s $20 more than what I originally paid plus shipping. It’s a beautiful necklace if you only plan to wear it occasionally.
3.0,Soft material and breathable comfort you can move in
3.0,The neck is very tight due to the elastic. The sides are open and another shirt underneath is required.
3.0,"These look nice, but I'm not impressed with the cheap foam 'seal' where these meet your face.  They don't fit like goggles where you have a total seal around them.  My friend and I both have gaps around them and our face when we wear them.  We both were critical of the foam. For the price that I paid, I will keep them and use them, but they're merely okay.  I can see well out of them.  My primary plan for these is snow blowing, shoveling, and outdoor recreation and since I don't plan downhill other than tubing or sledding I think these are okay."
3.0,"The package arrived without a hitch, earlier than I would have imagined. However, when I looked at the glasses, one screw was missing from the browline area of the frame and their was a deep gash on the left lens. i would think twice before ordering from this company again."
3.0,"Like the print a lot. I’ve also purchased the flamingo print. That said, the flamingo was 10x better than the newest one I bought with the heart print. It’s not as high quality as my first."
3.0,"This is the strangest blouse I've ever purchased -- it's weird in the SHOULDERS.  From the shoulders down, it's nice and flow-y, not particularly light-weight material, certainly not chiffon-ish, but OK.  It's just that it's tight in the shoulders.  I've bought a lot of clothes in my life, but I've never had anything that's tight in the shoulders!  I'm not exactly complaining...just a heads-up."
3.0,order size bigger run small other. then that i like them
3.0,looked small but lots of stretch to them . will have to wear swimsuit bottom or nude undies underneath.
3.0,Not really fond of these.  They ran really big and wide for my grandson.  The bottom are a rubber material that seem pretty stiff. I will have for a while until he grows into them.  They are made of leather on top and are really cute!
3.0,"A cheap shirt, you get what you pay for"
3.0,"Nice design and construction.<br /><br />For me, they runs very big and heavy."
3.0,the stem is shorter than i expected or need it to be but it ok
3.0,"Seems to run a size small, and the point is sharper than most teardrop shaped plugs. But lightweight and comfortable. May order a size up and see if that's better..."
3.0,It is a pretty cheap costume hat but you get what you pay for
3.0,From other reviewers I expected a lot more from these leggings. They were very thin and slid down (saggy “crotch area”). They are indeed soft but I wouldn’t wear them unless under a dress
3.0,Jacket fits well. However it was gray black as if it had faded. Other than that my daughter loved it
3.0,I just prefer the elastic bracelet bands for my watch
3.0,Very happy design even if it doesn’t keep accurate time.
3.0,"I ordered ""tomato red"" and got ""traffic cone orange"". I used it on a couple bike rides; it was dripping wet on the inside at the end of the rides, there was very little breathability compared to other jackets. I am keeping it as a rain jacket as it's got decent weather resistance and packs down to a small size, but overall it's disappointing."
3.0,These run more on the small side. They are seriously buttery soft just like leggings! If your into a more tight fitting pair of shorts you will like these.
3.0,"Dress is beautiful. I purchased a large, body wise it felt comfortable and the material was good but for some reason It was so uncomfortable under and rubbing against my armpits. I had to return it."
3.0,"I'm 5 4' and 113 lb. and it was way too big! I ordered a small, but it's very cute! It just wasn't for me."
3.0,"good art, hard plastic broke after a month near the charge port, but it's still functioning well to protect my phone on the corners."
3.0,"Great fit, nice pattern. Three stars because I don't like the middle section of the front, the bow should've wrapped there. Looks kind of cheesy to me."
3.0,Took forever to get in the mail and the clasp spring was broken. Very flimsy. Not too happy
3.0,Smaller than I wanted but is good if you just need the ends
3.0,"This item is a computer bag, not a pair of shoes!  It is quite a bit larger than I expected.  The color is all wrong.  It was supposed to be a pale pink, and is actually a bright hot pink."
3.0,Kinda big bit bright colors and cute!
3.0,I never got a black one just two grays and an burnt orange which had a small hole it in otherwise they are stretchy my 15 month old can fit them
3.0,"Lasted one year and a day. Zipper broke, had to cut it open."
3.0,It just didn't fit..
3.0,The thickness of the fabric made then non stretch. Bulky fit in little girls shoes and boots
3.0,I ordered for size 7.5 but got 8.5 and was too long over my knee so I could not walk comfortably
3.0,"These glasses are vert lightweight. They look ok, but feel kind of cheap. They work blocking the sun. I am a man and didn't really like how they looked on me but they better on my girlfriend. Not bad sun glasses but not great either."
3.0,Wasn't as thick as I wished.  Probably perfect for dress shoes.
3.0,it took over a month to receive this product but they were very nice looking
3.0,"Nice product, but runs very small.  I regret having to return these three jackets, which were shipped quickly, but they are at least a size smaller than customary sizing."
3.0,The fit was way off for me. I'm petite and just wanted something to give the appearance of some firmness in my trouble areas. I'm size 2/ 34C(sometimesD). I actually ordered the B thinking it would act more like a push up. It took it a bit to position the girls but it worked okay. The rest of the body suit was not very snug which is what I was afraid of. After that I was worried that ordering a bigger cup size would make the bodess even larger so I just returned it. Returning was quick and easy though!
3.0,"VERY see-through and the pink shown on screen is not the pink of the actual product. However, I appreciate the length of the top and it's very soft and comfortable."
3.0,They're nice but I got two left ear earrings...
3.0,It's definitely cheap costume jewelry. It looks really nice but I'm not so sure how long it will last before it starts changing color or if it will. I feel like it's more a gift for a kid. I got it for my niece Alexis only when it came in it said Tara. So I guess that's the worst part.
3.0,"Garment has a small hole on the front of the shirt and discoloration on the back of the shirt, when ordering leave enough time as it took almost 3 weeks to receive the item and is damaged."
3.0,"It is made small, so up another size then your normal size, I still received a few compliments on how nice it is when I wore it."
3.0,"It does help when I drive inside our camping club where there are few cars at night and speed is 15 mph, but for me it does not make it safe for me to drive on the highway at night even though it reduces much of the glare.  Maybe for people who have better eyes and drive often at night it would work for them."
3.0,love the suit! but the top is almost too small barely fit it.
3.0,Cute style. A bit boxy and big in the fit. Very thin material
3.0,Shies fit great. I charged both shoes no directions in box nothing showing company name no indication  these were NEW SHOES. NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT WHEN I OPENED THE BOX. ANGELA BANGS AND I SPEND OFTEN this is first time not satisfied. These are supposed to be the top of the line product/shoe. Will return and try again another pair.
3.0,Tubs are great for our purpose.  Gloves are used at church and not sized quite right and the cotton quality is not as good as last order I got.  But we will use them and maybe I can find a greater quality of cotton next time we need them.  .
3.0,I normally wear a size 12 in pants and bought that size. It was much too tight. Very pretty dress but I did try on a size 16 and the fit was much better. Still not the dress I was looking for tho so I returned that as well. It’s not as thick as a typical wedding dress but def the look of one. Great for eloping or needing a dress to travel without the extra weight.
3.0,nice boots but some what snug. may want to buy half size bigger.
3.0,Made small! Praying it fits my son!
3.0,Shirt was exactly like the picture. Only problem was it looked really faded after one wash and I never have this problem with any other clothes!
3.0,The tab that holds the clip tore off after a couple months.
3.0,Make sure to order 2 sizes up
3.0,"The colors were nice and exactly as pictured (so three stars), but the sizing on the dress is crazy. Based on reviews it was really difficult to figure out what size to buy, as some customers said it was huge and some said it fit small. The medium should have fit, but it was HUGE. For reference, I'm 36/28/40 and I have never been a small in my life. The top of the dress was so big that it could be folded over twice at the waist. I have a short torso, but I would have to be 6 feet tall for the dress to look like the picture. The bottom was also too big, so the pockets kind of just swung around. My guess is that each of the dress patterns is made on it's own sizing information. If you get this color I try sizing down."
3.0,Overall length was a bit short and the sleeves were also short but not bad material
3.0,Just a personal thing but don't like how the fabric feels. Graphics are vibrant. Might have to make adjustments to hang right. Disappointed with small rip. Easy fix but why am I receiving damaged product. Took so long to deliver I didn't return.
3.0,"Got tarnished after awhile, I stopped wearing it."
3.0,"This jacket is okay.  I found it short in the body---I am 5'8"" and ordered a size large----it is very roomy.<br />Also, I feel it is heavy--I would have preferred a lighter weight.  I am going to wash this jacket and see if it<br />""softens"" up.  The shipping took longer than anticipated."
3.0,"The sandals light up when walking.  Look nice at first.  But after a few time wearing them, the soles were chopped off."
3.0,"the first pair lost a screw.  i like the look so i got another pair.  second pair is holding up.  they do not block the sun like you'd expect, but they're cute."
3.0,I wear a large couldn't even get this on.  Although it looks very pretty and good quality.  Man get order next size not sure yet.
3.0,"This dress was so cute. But it was clearly designed for the small chested. I still love wearing it, it's just a bit more flattening than I would prefer."
3.0,These are ok but not in love with them like my other brooks
3.0,"Very nice looking pants but Pants run small. Also, after one wash they fade"
3.0,"I have a an inset the sink, so this does not fit flush with the edge.The rubberized tubing over the ends also fell off the first day, so it slips around a lot. It does hold my scrubbers and wash cloths, so I use it. But it's not the best product for an inset sink."
3.0,Muy pequeño para el número q corre
3.0,It is what it is.  It's an old school 80's watch.  I was shocked by how small it is though.  It feels like a toy.  My son's kids g-shock is twice the size of it.
3.0,"Cute, comfy, breathable, but get worn out quickly from washing and drying."
3.0,The material wasnt great.
3.0,the size is really too small for my usual XL size
3.0,The plastic is blurry and hard to see through.
3.0,The material looks like a silk material.
3.0,"Not at all the vibrant colors depicted in the picture. The lime, is more of an olive.  Not true to size.  It's extremely roomy. Nice material seemed to be well made. It was returned and I never wore it."
3.0,its ok. can't keep the end nuts tight and one was lost the first time I wore it. I'm using stopper beads on both ends so I don't lose beads.
3.0,"This dress was too short and cut under my arms. I am a size 6-8, 5ft 6 inches tall, 147 lbs and it fit well other than that. Also the pic shows the belt at the waist. I didn’t know where to put the belt because it was more like an empire waist. The belt looked really bad tied there. I wish it could have worked. I am returning it unfortunately."
3.0,The studs are so long that decorative part does not lay on regular earlobes. Must have fat earlobes for them to sit properly.
3.0,was alittle smaller the expected
3.0,Had to take them in and get them stretched at the ball of the foot. They are quite narrow. I love the style & design.
3.0,"These stretch ok, but we're much shorter than expected. The description said bamboo, but are cotton, instead. They do have the silicone at the heel, to help sock stay on, though. They came from China so it's probably too expensive to return, or I would."
3.0,"It would have definitely been better if the colors I got were the colors in the photo. the company was nice enough to send me the two I really wanted that I didn't get, FREE OF CHARGE, which I though was really cool. and im grateful. but if they could do a better job giving people the exact colors you see in the photo, because that's what people want. OVERALL im happy. even if I still don't have two of those colors. im happy with my purchase. their a company determined to make their customers happy."
3.0,Materials are not the best but for the price is what you can expect. My daughter cracked the fin before we even got it in the water. The swim suit top didn't seem to be cut for a child but she had a great time playing in it...
3.0,Sent the wrong Symbol
3.0,"This Pendant is cool, but its huge. Its like putting a ""pie plate"" on your neck.<br />I think it would be a bit better if it were smaller."
3.0,"Fits, works ok, but it’s not an original watch band. A little misleading."
3.0,"These fit comfortably and are nice to wear. However, after a few washes they begin to lose their elasticity. You get what you pay for. At least it was worth it."
3.0,They made my ears swell from allergic reaction.
3.0,"Love these, only thing is my little one pulled off one of the bows off the shoe(just one side)"
3.0,"Had to return it, to small for a medium size."
3.0,"Runs a little large, but great price!"
3.0,El artículo fue recibido gracias
3.0,It was to easy  to break. Didn't wear it but once
3.0,Definitely over-sized which I like but I would prefer much darker lenses.  These are too transparent & don't block out the sun well.
3.0,Crei que tenia mejor materia prima.
3.0,Make sure you turn it inside out in the dryer. I regret not doing this because it messed up the graphics a little.
3.0,Good leather but fits a bit narrow around the toes.
3.0,"I wear size 12/14 Large. I wanted a nice jacket that would fit so I avoided looking at a junior cut. I decided something labeled &#34;Women's&#34; woyld be cut more generously for ... well ... WOMEN! Noting that others said it ran small, I went with XL. I needed the jacket next day so I paid as much on shipping as the jacket itself.<br /><br />I was so frustrated that I could barely squeeze into the jacket. I ended up having to pull out an old denim shirt to wear instead of this costly mistake. Should I just hang it on the wall to inspire me to lose weight? At 5'10&#34;, I doubt I could ever get that small in any healthy fashion.<br /><br />Why is it that everything here on Amazon seems to &#34;run small&#34;? Shouldn't that be the exception and not the rule? How depressing. :-("
3.0,it kept rolling down my leg
3.0,"Beautiful color as pictured, good quality fabric, flattering style and fit. I was disappointed and sent it back because of a significantly  puckered seam in the back of the dress which caused the fabric to twist - I knew I would always be aware of this flaw in an other wise lovely dress."
3.0,Cute shoes but they just didn't fit right with my high instep.
3.0,The backlight barely works
3.0,"This is definitely NOT cable knit nor chunky. It’s a waffle weave. It is soft and comfortable, though. Fit as expected."
3.0,"He loved it and thought better of actually putting it on his key ring. Just hang it from his sun visor in the truck.<br />Anyway, he added it to his key ring and the coin portion broke off from the key ring."
3.0,"The wallet I received wasn't as vibrant a color as the one advertised. The front of it above the ID slot is a faded brown color as well (see pictures). Besides the disappointing color, the wallet was a good purchase."
3.0,"I bought these before going on a tactical mission - as a civilian contractor with the Navy ... I only wore them once and they were pricier than I would have liked for pants I'm only going to wear once. Plus, they were so heavy and HOT, very uncomfortable."
3.0,"This seller appears to be selling totally different-sized dresses from the same page. I ordered two, both Small - which should have fit me dead-on based on the sizing chart image the seller supplied. One fit perfectly, the other was baggy and all around too big. When I looked at the labels to double-check sizing, I noticed that the smaller one (which fit) was labeled as Junior's, but the too-large one (although also a Small) was marked as Women's. Both were sold directly by GK, not resellers. I went back to Amazon and couldn't see any difference like that on the webpage - so I guess it's luck of the draw whether you're getting a Small Juniors or a Small Womens, and they're TOTALLY different sizes. Disappointing, because I like the one that fits and would have bought more - but don't want to deal with a sizing crapshoot. As for the quality of the dress itself, it's &#34;okay&#34; - cheap zipper, but thick material, and a good value for the price."
3.0,I’m 5’5” and these pants are dragging on the floor even with high heels.
3.0,The grape laffy Taffy was opened when delivered today. Was not satisfied and also the grape air heads candy was damaged and opened also. I don't appreciate receiving opened products. Please be more careful in the future.
3.0,"Gave these as mini-gifts/tokens of appreciation to my UK-based employees at work. Smelled like plastic even after using a few weeks which was off-putting, so I gave up with using them myself but others thought they were cute...not sure anyone is still using them though."
3.0,"I like the look of these earrings. However, one of them does not open all the way so it is difficult to put it on."
3.0,"I did the measurements and came out to their large (I am normally a small or medium) but the large wasn’t eligible for prime so I ordered their medium. The skirt just fit and the top was big so I’m glad I ordered down a size. Also, there is NOT full closure in the back of the skirt! I thought the top part (not the grass skirt) would be, but it’s open.  You will have to buy shorts for underneath. Overall though the look of it was what I wanted."
3.0,Glasses have too dark of a lens tint for my liking. These would probably function best in a desert when the sun is blazing down on you
3.0,"The material was cotton, like a Tshirt. I just expected a better material. It was cute and comfortable."
3.0,Been wearing this product for years.<br />This version is just not as thick of a material as in years past and the height of the top is higher and more elastic than previous versions.
3.0,I would love to love these but they are not true to size. Get a size up.
3.0,Not for women with large breasts. I ordered the XXL to accommodate my 36G and the top coverage is way too small and of course way to big in the waist. Plus its see through.  So pretty though if you are smaller or super perky up top.
3.0,"The lanyard itself is very nice. Good quality. However it truly doesn't look like the picture. It is more like two shades of darker hot pink wiith brown and white. It is still cute, I was just disappointed as I wanted something not so bright."
3.0,"The post is too thick, and cartilage doesn't stretch, so I couldn't get these in. They are pretty, though."
3.0,Nice looking  but ran small
3.0,"Although these pants are very cute and fit well, they are very thin and see through."
3.0,I like the color scheme and the material is just fine.  I checked and double checked measurements and sizing chart before I ordered.  Well community aid just received another donation.
3.0,The left frame keeps popping out so I have to keep putting it back in
3.0,"The shorts fit very well, but the top was tight across my back and around my arms, and also not as short on my torso as pictured. Overall beautiful and silky and nice to wear."
3.0,"Very thin and see thru.  Also, seems cheaply made. Looks and feels more like a night gown."
3.0,The ad said I would get 6 pairs of gloves; I received only 5 pairs.
3.0,The product was good.
3.0,Son loved it and wore to outdoor rehearsal. My new DIL was unfortunately not able to wear hers as it did not fit over her hair. Would be great if it was a visor or had a ponytail slot for the bride.
3.0,It wasn't quite the &#34;wow&#34; I was expecting but I will enjoy wearing it.
3.0,I ordered my usual size and it was way too big.  I have had the same issues when ordering from Kohl’s.  Been wearing Gloria Vanderbilt for 20+ years…. Now the sizes are very off…
3.0,"Didn't like the cut, fit a little wide and baggy. seemed kinda cheat. i returned it for a refund."
3.0,Really gorgeous but the way the photo is added onto the metal makes me feel as tho it will scratch off soon and the photo came as a weird color like it was tinted differently than the original photo. Lovely quality for the engraving tho and quick shipping
3.0,the only fault that i find with this necklace is that when it's worn several times it rubs the silver color off.
3.0,I like the sunglasses they look nice but confused on why I paid $35 then they come with a price tag that says $25 dollars on it
3.0,Didn't realize I needed to wear a cami or something under it because the open-front tie goes way down...unless you lace it tight.  Fit was good.  Material is nice.
3.0,The material is very thick and it doesn’t look as great as in the picture
3.0,"It may be just the way it fits on me, but the skirt part of the dress is very high wasted (or the top is too short lol)  It feels like the waste line is right underneath my bra.  Larger size would not have made a difference since it fit well everywhere else. I haven't worn it yet, but I've tried it on a dozen times and each ended up wearing something differentt"
3.0,I debated returning this because the fit wasn't perfect. It feels a bit small. Also the material is thick/sturdy but does fade when washed after a few washes-in my experience.
3.0,"The glove fits well, for the most part, but the lower thumb area is a little wide. So, the glove fits well everywhere else, but in order for it to stay put, I have to keep pulling them up. The finger lengths are good, though, and so that helps to keep them somewhat in place."
3.0,Was not happy with how the color faded after washing a few times. It also stretched out quite a bit after wearing for a short time.
3.0,"I had to return my shorts after figuring out that a small was too small for me and the medium was way too low due to a small stride. However, I had a great experience with the return process so I am pleased with that, but not the product."
3.0,The glasses are fine. However I only opened 1 pair at first. After a couple of weeks I opened the 2nd set and they have a crack across the lens. Check both glasses before it's too late.
3.0,"Absolutely love the necklace!  Only reason I give it 3 stars instead of 5 is the second I went to put it on after I got it, the clasp broke :( luckily I can still hook part of the clasp to the chain to wear it, but sad that happened the first time I tried to put it on"
3.0,I received this today. I am an adult but have smaller wrists and the charms are set far apart and the chain is longer so I have three plus inches just hanging there. I guess when you buy one size fits all it would run that way. The charm for black widow is white not colored in.  Most of the charms are pretty cute. If you are buying this for a teen with smaller wrists expect it to be way too large. I wish I had shopped around and got the one that had the Dr. Strange logo too.
3.0,The material is good but the size is smaller than it claims.
3.0,"This is not a dress for someone with insane curves, the profile of the dress is unflattering if you have a very round backside. It looked great on my athletic fit sister. I am 5,7 245lbs 40-36-45 and i think i got a XL, it was a tad bit to tight in the bust, and waist. They use an invisible zipper which under the cape makes no sense as they are hard to close."
3.0,Nice.. But Different  color.. Mor dark yallow
3.0,"Comfortable, soft, slightly bulky, but it protects my fit bit, wish it came in larger size, I don’t have huge wrists and only have 3 - 4 holes left on strap, depending on how tight I want to wear it, it does the job, -2 stars for only one size!!"
3.0,"It is cute, but right away the color faded and rubbed off on my hands to become a bronziest color. I’m sure if you cover it in clear coat nail polish it would last longer and not affect the hands."
3.0,"These sterling silver sapphire earrings looked very pretty, and my granddaughter really liked them. I hope they are nickle free."
3.0,"I am 5'3 and 150 pounds, according to the size chart I should be a large. I originally bought a large and it was too big so I sent it back and got a medium. The medium is even too big. Most reviews says the swim suit runs small but that wasn't the case for me. I have only worn once and the second layer is already sagging. The material is thin but overall I think if I had the small it's a pretty good buy compared to other brands. Not sure how it will hold up in chlorine yet."
3.0,The bra is perfect but the bottom part i ordered a small one and its like a large
3.0,Wonderful but too large!
3.0,"This dress is very cute, good material, and it's flattering, but it arrived with a weird, uneven hemline. It's disappointing since it was for Easter, but we expedited shipping on the same dress to see if we can get one with a straight hem. This one is being returned, unfortunately.<br /><br />**UPDATE** The second one we received was perfect and is so cute on my teenage daughter. She loves it and got a lot of compliments when she wore it."
3.0,"The fit is good and they are soft and a good length. The vented pockets are nice but I don't think I will trust putting anything in the pockets - it seems they would rip easily. Also, the pockets stick out a bit on the sides. Kind of annoying."
3.0,Nice looking but odd fit. Arms are tight yet the belly is big. Not sure about the padding. Going to give it a whirl.
3.0,Not terry cloth. Thin cotton or polyester material. Still nice but again not terry cloth
3.0,Bag arrival was quick which was good. The quality of the bag is great so far- got this as a present so not sure if they will take good care of it. The previous reviews and other bags from this seller had a little teddy bear accessories but this looks like someone took off the bear before it got to us.
3.0,"Based on the reviews I read, I expected a little more support and control than it gives.  It did fit well, and the legs do not ride up.  However the top did fold over a bit."
3.0,This dress was much larger and longer than expected.  I gave it away as a gift.
3.0,"Beautiful and of good quality, but too small for my nose piercing. Gifted to someone else."
3.0,They get loose pretty quick and start sliding down your feet. Other than that they are pretty comfortable.
3.0,"This product looks like the picture but it runs small. So when you wear it the underlining shows through because the outer fabric is not baggy enough. In terms of quality it is good and the fabric is very soft. Color is as pictured as well, maybe leans a little more nude than the photo."
3.0,Material was pretty thin. I probably should have returned them but decided to keep them. Material also doesn’t feel very soft.
3.0,Everything is good besides missing balls
3.0,Itchy but quick to put on and like that I can wash.
3.0,"This is a beautiful, well fitted dress; however, whatever you do DO NOT PUT THIS IN THE DRYER!!!! IT WILL SHRINK DOWN TREMENDOUSLY!"
3.0,"Was disappointed with the size of the bag, the only thing that will fit is shoes. For the price of the bag and the quality the bag should have been bigger."
3.0,"I bought this as a Halloween costume for my grandson and he couldn't possibly have used it.  He is a bigger eight-year-old and it was ludicrous.  The helmet was so small it sat on the top of his head.  It was even small for his little sister, who is six.  I wouldn't recommend this for a child older than three or four.  The plastic is nice and thick, but I could have gotten the same set at the dollar store, as I discovered later."
3.0,Love the brown but this one is a lot smaller and feels uncomfortable. Also the material is a little thicker. Love the color. Will give to my daughter
3.0,Cute lanyard. Pretty colors. Does not stretch. Great for one day use. The photo is after two days of use and clearly is not going to last long. Break away mechanism works properly.
3.0,Love this brand and style.  However these are not photocromatic as I was hoping for and are no where dark enough.  So want a blue mirror glass in this style.
3.0,Problem for me is the magnetic closures -- they don't hold the flap  in place---- much at all....
3.0,"Product returned. Too many wrinkles, too thin material. Needs to be worn with a camisole."
3.0,"Needs constant readjustment of the waist, distracting from the workout."
3.0,"They were a little smaller than planned, and a little thin."
3.0,Very sparkles
3.0,"I started looking for a cotton shirt - 80% or more for exercise breathability. That lead me from one product that was not in a color I liked onto the path of crumbs and I ended up with these. I did not notice  the fabric was different. I wore one for my yoga class and it was like wearing an oven. They are really wide, which was okay. Not recommended for exercise or any strenuous activity in warm climate. These are going back."
3.0,No huzzahs.
3.0,My husband is satisfied
3.0,"Really wrinkled when it arrived and I had to wash it, dry it, and then steam it to get them out but it does fit really well and isn't too long which at 5' 2&#34; that tends to be a problem with most dresses I buy online or in stores.  I like the way it fits and it is very flattering without showing to much cleavage"
3.0,"It somewhat small, and the material is on the thin side. I had to sew up a hole already and it’s not great for long torsos. I still enjoy wearing it because it’s cute. Just don’t expect high quality."
3.0,"I received these in a timely manner & with good, secure packaging. The glasses look & feel great. However, they are a bit harder to ""open"" than a typical pair of sunglasses. The arms clip on to a metal brace via a small piece of plastic which broke after less than a week of use while opening to put on."
3.0,I think it was more my comfort level having bigger breasts. The bra functioned as it was suppose to. I just felt a bit fidgety being use to wider straps
3.0,"After reading reviews I decided to get XXL INSTEAD OF XL.  I think XXL are a little too big and XL would fit just right.  However, when I tried them on they do feel uncomfortable and like I have pooped my pants.  Maybe because they are too big? Maybe L would be better?<br /><br />I’m a size 33-34 waist and 190 lbs."
3.0,"Great necklace, but likes to tangle easy."
3.0,Absolutely love the dress.  But it is much much smaller than the size chart says.  I recently lost 35 pounds and fit very comfortably in an 18 almost a 16...but this didn't come close to zipping up.  For like it's a size 10.  Very disappointing as everything else is wonderful about it.
3.0,Shirt is cute but the brand on the shirt is cheap so they could have at least got the size right. Bought this as a birthday present.
3.0,Runs small.  No pun intended
3.0,not very useful
3.0,just got them....they are not pink. Clear color
3.0,The buttons on the jacket are really loud and make noise when you move around.
3.0,They kind of hurt my ears a little.  But a good price with no shipping.
3.0,Cheap material but somewhat cute on the body.
3.0,"Nice band, but kind of awkward to put on. I was expecting it to come with a case, so that was very disappointing ."
3.0,"I am a size 36DDD/38D and I (somewhat obviously) found the xxl top to be small. I have a rather large bottom and still found the bottoms large. Not the best fit for me but black bottoms are so useful to have that I decided to keep it for the price. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to recommend this product, but I wouldn't say it's a no go either. Be ready for a solid meh product."
3.0,Game is good but came all bent up. It was a birthday gift for my mom and it doesn’t look very good. It’s like we went to a garage sale and picked it out.
3.0,"I was unable to keep these from leaking at the top. Perhaps I was doing something wrong, but they just sit on top of the filled cup, which I also purchased from them too."
3.0,Color is good.  Quality is so-so.
3.0,"If you have big hips, this is not the item for you. It curls up at my hips and stabs me in the sides. Very uncomfortable for more than an hour or so at a time."
3.0,"Ordered a 2xl for a comfy fit on my mom. She’s a petite L/XL, and this was way too tight for her. She loved how soft and cute this was... but unfortunately it’s way too small for her to keep."
3.0,It was a little thinner that I had hoped.
3.0,"I bought several pairs of these for my potty training toddler. I thought I would get the look and feel of the big boy underpants with at least some of the absorbency of a pullup. This is no more absorbent than a pair of tightie whities. They can pee right through it. My toddler wet it one day while sitting in his high chair. The pee went through the underpants, through the highchair and into a puddle on the floor. I am not sure that the waterproof linter really served its purpose. I still let him wear them, because he is starting to learn that he is not supposed to let them get wet. But they really don't do much in terms of protecting your furniture or preventing a small mess from becoming a bigger one. If your child is not completely potty trained, I wouldn't use these."
3.0,Was very very happy
3.0,"these are cute sunglasses - very fashionable.  However, they feel very cheaply made and like they'll fall apart easily.  They smudge very easily, which is not unusual, but the frames are weak and feel like it might fall apart when I clean the lenses. They haven't broken yet, but in feeling how lightweight and flimsy they are I don't think they'll last long."
3.0,"The watch is cute, but the band is not very flexible. I have a small wrist so there is a lot of strap left over."
3.0,Adequate quality. Ties in knots easily.
3.0,This watch band was a little too &#34;edgy&#34; for me.  The face is pretty though.  I think it would make a trendy accesory for a younger person.
3.0,These were super cute & comfortable. My only complaint is I have a bit of a “fupa” so they weren’t very flattering in my lower stomach area but it wasn’t too terrible where I couldn’t wear them. Overall a good purchase.
3.0,They look good but the arm snapped for no reason within the first month
3.0,"Very cute, but opened it and there are lots of fraying strings and it is very short on my daughter (loose on the chest)"
3.0,cute! but small.
3.0,THis Item is just okay.  It is what it is a keychain example of a turbo.  The one I received could have been assembled better and had crooked screw with stripped heads.  Also the turbo wheel did not spin at first due to matreial from what appeared to be the casting clogging in internally.  Otherwise I like it.  It's a keychain - it's a turbo - it's prety cool.
3.0,Didn’t like the material. The design is nice though.
3.0,The hanging pendants are much larger than expected.
3.0,Son algo pequeñas
3.0,"The multi layered anklet states it is sterling silver, however it is darker in color than most sterling silver jewelry and I would have liked it 1/2 inch longer so the extended chain could dangle a bit."
3.0,"Perfect for the Hulk fan!  Nice thick quality cotton.... However runs 1, maybe 2 sizes too small!!  Order a size up"
3.0,Okish runs small and pants are see through
3.0,like the most is the material.<br />color not as expected/dull gray.
3.0,Good product arrives on time just tuns small
3.0,Perfect size for my 12.5 HP EliteBook. Like the color. Needs more a d varies size compartments for all. My periferal gear and zipper s to keep stuff securedecent bag for smaller laptops and tablets
3.0,The bag is a nice size lots of room but both zippers broke the first day. The bag is now in the trash.
3.0,"I couldn't wait for this watch to arrive only to be disappointed by what appears to be a loose second hand. As it ticks off the seconds it moves either more or less than one space per second, depending on the position of the hand and watch. I remember reading other reviews about this brand, that hands where either loose on their shaft, or had fallen off during shipping. The watch is otherwise absolutely gorgeous, nice finish, perfect size, nice leather band. I am very sorry that it has to be returned today. The only bright spot is Amazon's flawless service and ease of return procedures and policy. This will not deter me from trying again. I bought several watches from them in the past that were perfect in every way."
3.0,"These are made for someone with a runner's body, not a 5'5"" woman with 16"" calves.  They don't show a size chart, but there is one on the box. I ordered size L/XL, which  should be what I need based on calf size. Unfortunately, I wear a size 8 women's shoe, and that size sock is made for size 9.5-14+ W.  The resulting fit was too large in the foot (at least an extra inch in the toe area, and not much foot or ankle compression) and too tall for my leg (wrinkled unless I pull it up over my knee).  The material and stitching is good, just a poor fit for me. Not for someone with large calves who isn't  tall."
3.0,Cute but after being on the keychain for 2 minutes the gems started falling out. Luckily they were found and fixed and now it just hangs on the wall as decor.
3.0,"The color and design are exactly like photo, however the “sweatshirt” description in my opinion is incorrect. It feels more like a nice t-shirt material. I was expecting a cozy sweatshirt."
3.0,The bracelet itself looks great. those two tie strings drive me crazy. Perhaps instead of them try an elastic type?? Looks great however.
3.0,"THE SOCKS ARE WELL MADE, BUT THINNER THAN EXPECTED."
3.0,When I received this ring it came with a piece chipped off the underside. When you are wearing the ring the missing chunk isn't too  noticeable but It still bothers me it arrived like that.
3.0,I like it but did not like that it did not have a button release it is manual opening
3.0,this is the fourth Guatemalan Croakie I have used for my sunglasses over the years and they sure have made them shorter! Don't like the missing length.
3.0,"NOT HAPPY LOOKS CHEAP.IT IS CHEAP SO I CAN,T COMPLAIN"
3.0,These fit (but are a bit snug around my thumb) & keep me warm while I type. The picture on Amazon shows what appear to be female hands - however upon receipt the instructions are in various Asian languages & clearly a small man's hands. They do smell a bit like gaaoline. I haven't tried washing them since instructions weren't in English.
3.0,Very cute and well made.  Order 1 size up
3.0,"Not best quality , cute"
3.0,Fit is decent. interesting style. but material is a bit flimsy and not entirely sure it's worth the price.
3.0,"stretched out fairly quickly, the waist goes up very high, size runs larger than expected"
3.0,Material is not stretchy
3.0,Was nice but no lining
3.0,Fits larger than expected. Not an athletic cut. Somewhat chemical smell.
3.0,I bought this in a large because reviews said it was too small... I ended up with a size too big.
3.0,They were okay but a pair of high biker shorts could do the same in regards to compression.
3.0,very nice but seems to dry out within a month and holes start occurring on the material
3.0,"I asked for above the knee gym shorts, these are more like basketball shorts"
3.0,"this black rubber strap fits my TAG Heuer. Doesn't match the looks of the original strap but it doesn't cost $350 either. Also is a bit thinner and slips, I need to adjust it regularly. It lasted about two year and today I saw a crack. Will order a replacement before i loose my watch"
3.0,"Not very well worked leather, but I guess worse the low price. I use it with a smart watch, wouldn't put it on an exceptional watch."
3.0,I returned it cause i did not like the color.
3.0,I am giving this a 3 star because the strap is  too short. I have an average wrist and after buckling the strap the tip barely came out. The strap itself looks and feels like genuine leather but it is way too short.
3.0,"we returned this product. it was beautiful, colors wer nice, BUT our goal was a very modist suit, the sheer skirt made this a no go."
3.0,Open mind
3.0,This is just a beautiful peace of jewlery.  The proce was fantastic.  It is a nice size cross with turquoise accents.  I have had many compliments on this cross.
3.0,Color wasn't what we thought it would be so never tried it on.  Was returned after getting approval to.  Still no refund AND STILL NO REFUND!
3.0,The screw backs are nice so you don't lose an earring. However 6 earrings have the backs screwed on so tight I cannot unscrew them. Hence not being able to wear a full set. Not happy.
3.0,"The fit is a little too big for the size overall, but with the halter top tying and the strap across the back you can tie I can make it work. I needed it for a quick weekend away to the beach and didn't feel like trying to return and hope a smaller size would get to me on time. And because I had to tie the neck tighter it pulled the suit up a bit too high on the cups."
3.0,"Waist down the dress fits fine, the top is huge."
3.0,The first day we got it the plastic on the strap broke
3.0,"I measured myself for this and ordered a 34B, as per their size chart.<br /><br />It's good for the price. I've worn it for a couple of weeks now and here are my notes: It isn't the most comfortable bra, but it's wearable. I feel like the back rides up sometimes, but it just sits kind of high. Really it's exactly like the picture, even how it fits. The girls do tend to get pushed /out/ of this bra instead of up and the inner padding is in kind of a weird place, but it looks good on as long as I adjust myself now and then to make sure I don't have that weird boob version of a muffin top. The straps and lace seem kind of thrown on and aren't the greatest quality, and the hook of the left strap slides out sometimes. I do really like how low the closure is in the front, because I can wear pretty deep necklines and make the most out of the bangin cleavage it gives me. Overall, for the price I'm definitely not complaining (and neither is my boyfriend 😜)."
3.0,I would feel the value money should be lower because the slippers feel great its just not that of a quality you would expect from those massage flip flops usually they are more heavy duty and this one feels super light and whenever you slip in your toes I would feel it will get torn easily..
3.0,"Nice fit, but they looked worn out in 1 wash."
3.0,Fits as expected. Bought for my teenage son. Will work fine for weights and everyday wear. Material is awfully thin!!
3.0,Rubber starts tearing off and these gloves are extremely hard to put on or take off when wet. Great on hand protection though!
3.0,"Arrived on time, but the stickers were missing."
3.0,The ring on the leather key chain was too thick and did not fit in the key fob. Had to use one of the rings but now is too long and hits y knee and is bothersome.
3.0,"The quality of this dress specifically is way superior to typical costumes. The crown is also decent quality, although mine seems like it's coming apart at the main back seam. However I wish there was some kind of form that held the crown round. It kept folding flat. Not a fan of the bobby pins either but I easily fixed both crown issues with a pack of plastic headbands & some zip ties. I ziptied the crown onto a headband and used another headband as the round form it needed by zip tying it into a circle then zip tied the now circle headband to the attached headband that would be worn. (See pics if this doesn't make sense lol)<br /><br />It's not hitting the 5 stars bc the skirt hoop thing was damaged, and the crown seam is coming apart. :( The hoop also seems like its missing length to be for this dress anyways so now I'm going to have to figure something out for that as well. If you don't care about the hoop this is perfect. My kid is young but very smart and knows princess peaches dress HAS to have that puffed out look so I'm left here to think about a way to fix it."
3.0,I like it. Fits well can't wait to wear it out.
3.0,Nice in the picture but not as expected.
3.0,"I've seen it  cheaper on another site after I rec'd it, but I did save on the shipping.  It's a gift so I don't know about the fit."
3.0,"I typically wear an 1X in most brands, so take this review with a grain of salt. I purchased an XL. I found that while I can fit into it, the fabric laid in a really unflattering way for me and highlighted my areas of insecurity (upper arms and stomach). It is essentially one giant t-shirt with some slits; there is no shaping to it, so it just drapes over all of your body. For folks who are more confidant than me, I'm sure this wouldn't be an issue. But for me, I was really looking for some more concealment than this dress can offer."
3.0,"Love the shirt, but medium fit like an XL...  and I don't like tight fitting clothing, I generally prefer a little lose.  6'1&#34;, 175 lbs.  For example.  A normal medium shirt that fits me has a 12 inch arm hole, this shirt has a 16 inch arm hole and about 5 extra inches of body... I'd guess the waist on this shirt is closer to 40 than 34."
3.0,Could not fit into shoes
3.0,I Bought these because of the price and the description said they were anti fog. That's not exactly the case. They will definitely fog up. Other than that they're ok.
3.0,"Just got this belly button ring in the mail. Although its super cute, it came already chipped. The black paint is chipped off on the bottom. &#62;:( Since I paid $9 for this, I will probably try to get my money back because I'm not very happy that is came chipped."
3.0,to small wanted a larger cross
3.0,"Liked the looks online, didn’t care for the fit"
3.0,"these are really small maybe for a kid i wear a 81/2 and they were too small and short for me so tight they hurt, cute, but a waste of money  lesson learned here, not to mention very uncomfortable to walk in with grips on the bottom"
3.0,"The pin looks amazing, but the tab that holds the pin is extreme low quality and does not stay on the pin, which means the pin falls off to be lost out there in the world, somewhere.<br />Why make such an excellent pin to not have a proper dammit?"
3.0,"Okay guys n gals. Look, I’m not an expert on down filled vests. I’m your average retired man. Got my vest today and put it on for a test run. Temp. was 40 degrees with a 15 mph chilling wind. I wore a long sleeve t- shirt under my heavy weight hoodie. Then my vest. I wasn’t cold and I wasn’t warm either. The vest was adequate at best. Disappointed grouchy old man here.<br /><br />Maybe I expected too much for a 550 down. I will keep it for fall and spring temperatures.<br />This is my first and last purchase of  North Face clothing.<br />Again, maybe I expected too much.<br /><br />The vest is good looking and very light weight. Perfect for hikers and backpacking.<br /><br />The XL was a perfect fit for me."
3.0,Ordered my regular size but sweater was way too small. Too bad though as the quality seems very good. Too late for exchange so am returning
3.0,Was smaller than I expected but it is a pretty piece.
3.0,"I like the look of the bra & the design, but the material isn't as soft as I would've liked. It's kind of uncomfortable to wear for an entire day, especially in pressure point areas of the under band. I would say that I got what I paid for."
3.0,The coverage from bigger sizes is in width not in chest coverage. Fits like a sports bra.
3.0,The style and material is nice would have been a hit if it actually fits.
3.0,I was disappointed because I ordered 2 of these shirts for my sons because they wanted matching fire truck shirts but the company unexpectedly canceled the order on one of them.  This shirt is also a little smaller than I expected.
3.0,It was ok kind of small but I ended up giving it to my niece it was nice an great price but it didn't fit my sister so it's k<br />I guess
3.0,"The body of this dress is okay, but the arms are a little tight. But the material is the consistency of a t-shirt knit, so I was able to make it work. I'm a plus size 1XL, so I ordered a 2XL for fear that it would fit smaller. Since the percentage for the size was lower. The quality is a little iffy, I haven't actually worn it anywhere yet, but we'll see what happens after my first wash. I hang dry most of my clothing so of course I'll most definitely will with this dress. I also ordered these same type of sandals to achieve this look. Perhaps I'll add photos later."
3.0,"pills everywhere, sticks all over leggings, very fashionable however"
3.0,Runs super small. I wear a large and the XL was still tight.
3.0,"Toddler size, flimsy, but serves its purpose"
3.0,Cheap product but they were cheap in cost too.<br /><br />You get what you pay for (broken after a couple months).
3.0,The Hand that controls the seconds became loose after a few wears but overall good watch.
3.0,"We bought these finger lights for goody bags for a child's party.  Unfortunately, many of them did not work.  The ones that worked were fun, but I would order extra since many do not."
3.0,Scared the bands would come loose and my watch would fall off.
3.0,A little bit small but ok
3.0,"Based on the my measurements, this should have fit better. It's really too tight which makes it not as comfortable as I like. I guess it's wearable in a pinch, but it's not going to be my favorite. The tightness leads to the creation of an extra boob on my back which isn't very flattering. My husband said of the extra boob, ""well, at least it doesn't have its own cleavage"". Thanks! I'm going to try for the next size up."
3.0,"I wanted to love it, but it's a little frumpy. I the fabric is nice5'7&#34; with a pear shape body. My waist and shoulders are small with a large hip and butt area. It fit too loose up top to be flattering for me and I don't think a smaller size would have helped. I ordered a medium and returned it."
3.0,Used for costume. Durable
3.0,Overall Cute but not actually corset .
3.0,"This skirt is more on the ""yellow"" side. I'm going to return it."
3.0,"Not as sturdy as expected, but still usable for craft purpose."
3.0,Part of the dress fell apart as soon as I took it out of the bag
3.0,a bit too clingy for me
3.0,Colors are okay. Material is way too thin.
3.0,Wayyyyyy too big. And they are kind of heavy. I carry them in my bag
3.0,so these are cute but be prepared to put another pair of leggings on under them because they are 80% see through. so thin and i dont know the back from the front bc there is not tag...kind of fell like they were a home ec project someone whipped together for a final grade in junior high! they are cute though if you hide the waist with a tunic and layer them with another pair of legging underneath:)
3.0,Material was too thin. Wanted a little more support.
3.0,"Love that the solid one is cotton, hate that the print one is polyester. I will keep it to wear in the fall."
3.0,"I wanted to like these so much but they just looked like old lady pants. I am 5’3” and they were also way too long. They do look like the picture though, so probably are flattering if you are a tall person. Verrrrry roomie in the legs."
3.0,I ordered the WINE red however received the bright red… it’s just annoying to not get what you paid for.  I do like the cut.  I did order the larger size for some room and it is light and easy - 2 great summer qualities.  I would order another color but  hesitating since I didn’t get what I ordered the first tile around.
3.0,"I normally wear a L, but I wanted this loose so I got a XL. Wish I would have gotten an XXL. XL fits, but not with the looseness I wanted."
3.0,"It's definitely cute but the chain it comes on always comes undone so I can't even have it on my key ring. The actual item is pink, not tan."
3.0,"Didn’t like the roughness reflection not that great, just okay"
3.0,Awesome but very fragile
3.0,Disappointed. .It's like a tights<br /><br />Have to be worn underneath pants. . I was hoping I can wear like  regular leggings but comfy otherwise. Warm and soft
3.0,Size was good.  They weren't cute or colorful like pictured.  They have a manufacturers smell to them but should go away after wash.  I will add a picture soon.  Received order faster than expected!
3.0,Totally thought this was gray. It's white. Not sure how vinyl decals will hold up.
3.0,"Nothing special about it, had to return"
3.0,This is a beautiful necklace. Unfortunately a piece fell off as soon as I took it out of the box. I'm just going to buy some crazy glue to fix the flower that fell off.
3.0,Cute but a bit big
3.0,Very pretty but one pair immediately snapped.  Kind of cheaply made
3.0,Love the design. Smaller than my other yoga pants the same size.
3.0,"It's actually a pretty warm coat (it's 34 degrees and windy in Boston and I was actually comfortable) which I like. HOWEVER the zipper is super cheap and I can't get it to zip up more than 1/4 of an inch, and the elastic around the bottom is really tight so even if I did zip it up I feel like it would ride up around my waist. I'm 5'3, 140lb and I got an XXL and I like the way it fits."
3.0,"Beautiful, but for really short thin women, rode up ALOT"
3.0,"Nice looking band but as others have said, there are problems. Here are the ones I've had.<br />I needed to adjust the length. Tool included but, the adjustment holes are punched from the outside. As a result, the pins won't slip in as there is a rim of metal around the hole. I needed to file down the rim so the pin would slip into place. Took a while to figure this out. Of course if the band fits your wrist as delivered, you won't have this problem.<br /><br />Next, while the clasp looks nice, it doesn't close very well and is prone to popping open.<br /><br />I don't know yet if I'll keep this band. I'll wait a day or two and see if the clasp stays closed, otherwise, back it goes."
3.0,"Product was decent, but the material broke way too easily. I ordered it for my Grandfather, and the plastic card holders ripped after a week....."
3.0,"Fit all over was fine except the cuffs, they were huge, had to have them tailored"
3.0,Nice product but wrong size sent I ordered xlg and got a lg
3.0,From the picture it looks like the pattern was made of little beads. But it is not. The color is also different. Closed to be copper. Very different from the picture. Will return this one.
3.0,Smaller than 8 thought they would be
3.0,"Like everything about this hoodie, except the zipper. It never zips smoothly, it's hard to start, and feels like it won't last long."
3.0,The material is nice and cool but it fits smaller than expected.
3.0,Fit as expected. It was a little tricky to wear as is for I just could wear the top part without wearing cami given some of the gaps when it’s tied. But I love how it flows and the long flowy arms are so comfy.
3.0,Overall the band is comfortable but very disappointed that the two hard plastic rings that hold the excess band broke off and made the band unusable.
3.0,Nice dress just not for me. I will be purchasing from seller in the future.
3.0,Followed the measurement chart but unfortunately this just isn't the right fit for bustier gals. I'm keeping the product to give to a friend but I wouldn't recommend.
3.0,I liked the necklace when I first got it although it would be more flattering if it was a bit longer.  The problem is after a few month of wearing it occasionally I noticed one of the stones is missing.  Definitely not quality and not a piece you're going to have for a while.
3.0,"I like that these are 100% cotton since my LO has very sensitive skin and needs to have cotton everything to prevent skin irritation, but these weren’t very absorbent as it states in the product description. The picture is after my LO had the bib on for around 35-45 minutes, soaking through to his outfit."
3.0,The pants are supposed to be bootcut or bell bottom at the end of the pants but they're not
3.0,These gloves are ok.  Touch screen feature is great!  They look beautiful but the fit is off.  I read reviews about the long fingers but wasn't concerned because I have long fingers and gloves are often too short in fingers for me.  These gloves feel bulky and awkward and fingers are slightly long even for me.  Unfortunately these did not work for me.
3.0,liked the product but not suitable for athletic body
3.0,"These sunglasses are cute and light, but WAY too big for my five-year-old. The arms were are loose, and she has to balance them on her nose. She loves them, so she's willing to do that, but they're probably meant more for a ten-year-old."
3.0,"The Milacolato 6Pcs G23 Titanium 16G Hinged Nose Rings are a decent starter set for those with nose piercings.  That being said, my daughter and my wife, who both have piercings, said that the gauges were awfully small and that the rings opened up way too easily.  So with that in mind, these rings seem to be over-priced by about $6-$8.  I wouldn't pay more than $10 for these."
3.0,Quality wasn't that great and it fits big.
3.0,"This is a well made jacket, but its not for me.<br />The cut/stitching on the front is flattering, and has two flat side pockets that are stitched close. I would leave them stitich<br />As it would keep the jacket with its tailored look.<br />The lining is black and looks good.<br /><br />I wear a Size 8 or 10. This is a Large.<br />I’m 5’2, not short or stocky looking, I have long slim legs for my size. and this comes to the top of my knees. Looks wrong to wear with  boots, I look dumpy!<br /> The sleeves are TOO long also.<br />There is big silver snaps are on the inside of the jacket too close it, and I would not leave it open.<br />If it had nice looking buttons that would have added more class to the jacket, and could be left open."
3.0,Too small for men’s size 13. I got these for my son for Christmas. Very disappointed....
3.0,"This jumper is super cute, but it ripped in the crotch after I only wore it about three times."
3.0,"I wanted to love it! Perfect length and the stone looked really nice, but the chain arrived broken and now I have to return it. Maybe purchase this with a new chain"
3.0,too red
3.0,"First impression I was in love with the leggings. I normally wear a medium, 5'2&#34;, 148 lbs, and the size S/M fit perfect. They feel breatheable without being see through. The high wasted band stays up. After my leg workout I didn't see any sweat through them, which is a major plus. However, after just one use the right inside seam ripped. I am returning them and getting another pair because I loved the look and fit. Hoping this was just one pair and it doesn't happen again 🤞🏽"
3.0,It's thinner than I expected. Not a wow but just OK. I think there are better products out there for the money.
3.0,"This swimsuit set was so soft. I ordered several different sets and this one was noticeably more comfy; the top felt like butter on my skin. The high neck was very flattering and gave kind of a sporty feel.<br />However, it did not feel as supportive as a few others I got. I think it will work for my little 32C’s, but a bigger girl may need extra support. I think this high neck/ halter neckline flatters small-chested women in general.<br />Unfortunately, the elastic in the very front was visible. Could be easily sewn up to fix it, but that’s  a pain to do on a brand-new suit.<br /><br />Am 132 lbs, 5’5”, semi-athletic build, got a size Medium.<br /><br />The bottom half of this swimsuit was not very flattering, in my opinion. Looks pretty good from the back and the side, but from a straight-on view it reminds me of a diaper. Lol! Not what I was going for. I planned on wearing board shorts anyway (also pictured), so it didn’t really matter. But I wanted to picture the complete set for this review. Hope this helps!<br /><br />Also something worth noting: the very first photo in the display pictures is the accurate pattern (or at least what I got). The following photos in the listing are of a slightly different green suit. Both are very pretty, but it’s nice to know what you are actually getting!"
3.0,"Well, first it was kind of difficult to figure out what size to order with the sizing chart and reading others fitting challenges. My daughter turned 4 and is starting to get into a size 9 so i decided to order the 10 and they fit more like an 8-7 in my opinion. The rubberiness of the shoe i think was helpful in making them comfortable for her bday and just fit but probably not for long. Its still cold here so she wore them with socks and that was probably helpful as well because it seems like Ariel's head digs into her foot a little so we'll see what happens when she tries them without socks. When they came i was so excited because they looked so cute and packaged so well with an added card and cute bow hair tie. My daughter was excited for the card even saying its a credit card and bracelet. They are still very cute after wearing them for the second day but my biggest complaint is Ariel keeps braking apart and i have had to glue her back together about 3 times now. I still love these shoes but i would be very cautious of what size to order (maybe go up 2 sizes) and glue the princess head on real good before they adventure out into the world. They have brought my daughter great joy and i hope they hold up for a while to come, that will determine if i would purchase again."
3.0,"Runs incredibly small. Had to return. Seemed nice, however."
3.0,Was very short as if for a toddler not youth
3.0,Pretty dress but about 2 sizes larger than other dresses I had ordered in the same size. I wear a size 10/12 in regular clothes and a 16 dress but I could have ordered a size 12 in this one.
3.0,Did not fit me right.  Too tight in the waist and too long in the leg.  They were cute and seemed well made so it's a shame they did not fit.
3.0,...The print is kind of cheap looking. Material is a weird material. Pro: doesn't cling to body. Price is ok
3.0,Beautiful but broke as soon as I got it
3.0,"Feels cheap, but the design is nice"
3.0,"I did not like the pattern of the corduroy, it looks too large and it does not have the smooth touch as in my other shirts. The best cord shirt I have is a Van Heusen brand but the Amazon Basics is also OK.  The collar does not look well made either, it looks like it was made for a blue collar worker in a construction or industrial site, not what I was expecting. It also runs large for a Medium size. I ended up giving it to my father in-law as a gift who is bigger and he likes it."
3.0,The seams are not to strong but i like how they fit and the length.
3.0,"Adorable but the stars starting falling off as soon as I took it out of the package. My daughter loved it until she noticed she was losing stars. Then came the tears. If that wasn't an issue, I would give this 5 stars."
3.0,"Having read reviews before I purchased, I knew that the items were going to run small. I ordered two sizes up and it fits. Isn't exactly saran wrap, but not exactly loose, either. It also doesn't fall off one shoulder as advertised. Pretty disappointed.  Will be returning as it isn't what I had hoped."
3.0,It was damaged and I had to put it back together.
3.0,"Looks great, runs alittle small."
3.0,This fit is true to size. I made the mistake of reading the reviews that told me to order a size or two bigger- so I did. Deeply regret doing so. Very soft and great material though
3.0,"Love the bag. Yes it does have an odd smell, air it out. Also some have said the zipper arrived broken, no it's not. It arrived in the middle, zip, then unzip and it's just fine."
3.0,It’s cute and does the job. Be careful with the jewels as it seems they could easily fall off.
3.0,1 out of 3 didn't break within the first day. Uncertain if I will be able to get the one I have in back in correctly whenever I do take it out. Looks good though.
3.0,"These are not sneakers, they are squeaker.<br />They squeak with every step..."
3.0,"I like the fit of the coat. However, it came very wrinkled and I was unsure if I could steam the coat. Also it is not beige is is a low-key orange. I bought camel boots with the intention of wearing them together and it was no dice. Honestly, I will probably never buy a winter coat offline again."
3.0,Didn't know that much about Israeli dress and customs thought it would be much bigger than this and cover my bald spot. Will shave my head and see how it fits.Not worn to fool anybody there's no synagogue's in my neighborhood.
3.0,"This item said 14k, not plated.<br />Now on the review it says plated.<br />Doesn't even state played on the packaging.<br />A little disappointed."
3.0,"There is a very unflattering seam running directly down the middle of the front and back, but other than that it is okay"
3.0,"The lenses are super dark which is great, but it's hard to focus because the sunlight comes in from the sides. Not sure if it's because the frames are clear or not."
3.0,Love the style and color just too long on me and needed to hem up. I'm 5'2&#34; so this would be perfect for someone 5'5&#34; or taller?
3.0,I don't know my grandson only wore one pair and he hasn't said the quality is okay for the price I paid only time will tell how they wear
3.0,not real crazy about the way it looks
3.0,I ordered this dress for my husbands company conference in Curacau in October.  The material was great and it would have looked good if it was  a size larger.  I bought the XXL and that was the largest offered.  If you are a true size 18-20 this would be too small for you.
3.0,"The necklace is beautiful and for what I had been looking.  However the chains tangle such that getting the layers individualized is nearly impossible. If the chains were heavier and not so delicate, it might be easier to manage.  This was very disappointing, leaving me no other choice than to return it."
3.0,Ok quality. One of the bands keeps pulling out.
3.0,"Looks great, but the clasp needs to be in another location. Already lost the bracelet in the first two weeks. The clasp opens when your wrist hits countertops and tabletops."
3.0,Not exactly what I was expecting. It's a little cap rather than a bandanna where you would tie it. It will work for a costume but will need hair pins to secure it.
3.0,"The watch was nice, but smaller then anticipated. Would have kept it other then the fact it didn't fit my wrist and came with no extra links."
3.0,Compartments too small and hard to see what’s inside. I should’ve returned when I bought but waited too long.
3.0,The description says it’s 14/16 gauge so when we went to do my friends industrial bar we got a 14 gauge bar and then realized it was a 16 not 14 gauge needle
3.0,Kinda of cool looks kinda cheap but it looks like it cost more than you spent on it.
3.0,"5’5”, 145. I ordered a medium, my typical size. It fits perfectly, but if you want a roomy, flowy look like the picture, order probably two sizes larger than your usual. The skirt on my size is flowy but the bodice is definitely form fitting. The fabric is just a smidge thin - a black bra shows under the red color. Nude doesn’t show unless the bodice is really tight on you. The dress arrives very wrinkled but it washes up nice and I don’t think it will wrinkle that easily when worn. The dress falls About three inches above my knee for me."
3.0,Cute shirt but runs small so size up.
3.0,I bought this as a prop for some of the videos I make and I like it!
3.0,"Beautiful color, very nice leather and quality but it just was a little smaller than what I needed.  Plus I wish there had been a side zipper as well."
3.0,"The shoes fit my child's foot well. However, we purchased them to use for basketball. The soles were too slippery on hardwood. Dangerous to use as basketball shoes."
3.0,"Back panels don’t heat up, also got medium due to comments and should have sticked to small."
3.0,It’s small for size and rolls down in the waistline when moving the top bunches up too so constantly pulling on it to stay in place
3.0,"I did love these earrings and received many compliments on them; however, the backs could never stay on tight enough and I ended up losing the back of one just walking to my car from my apartment (the backs are the clear gel type)."
3.0,Update: it actually broke away from the flower in a few months.<br /><br />I personally wear a stainless steel choker and this one is just as great. A good deal.
3.0,Super cute. But the dress pattern is different than what I got.
3.0,Hat is nice BUT the image is a sticker<br />Not good should be embroidered
3.0,"I was looking for a thin glove that I could use my phone and type on a keyboard with.  Although they are generally thin enough to use my phone through, the stitching ends up right at the tip of your fingers which makes it really awkward to use the screen and type on a keyboard.<br /><br />They do fit my hands rather well, but I have large hands and long fingers.  Although the thumb is a bit baggy.<br /><br />Granted I may not be using them as ""glove liners"" they are still mildly uncomfortable due to the large amount of stitching.  They will likely work fine for liners, which is why I didn't give a lower review."
3.0,The swimsuit is very cute but the colors are somewhat dull. Definitely not as bright as in the picture.
3.0,"Ordered orange, but green came."
3.0,"The picture of the shirts show two shirts and it says ""Couples"" t-shirts.  I ordered the first one in a large and then ordered the second one in an XL.  It wasn't clear to me that I had paid for only one shirt and why did it ask me for the second shirt size.  I was so appalled that only one shirt was delivered and when I complained to the seller, I was told that I had only paid for one shirt.  It is an embarrassing situation as I had ordered it as a gift for a newly married couple.  Very false advertising.  It should be made more clear that the price (not cheap) is only for one shirt."
3.0,Asked for a medium( usual size) and made the big mistake of thinking they would be perfect for a half marathon. BIG MISTAKE. foot fell asleep into 10km. nice design but very bad fit
3.0,"My friend has one of these and he spoke very highly of it. Mine was delivered with the fan rubbing against the motor housing and making a loud noise that could be heard over people talking. not good. I had to pull the fan off the motor shaft, bend the motor mount out the way and grind down the back of the fan to get rid of the noise. For those of you that don't have the knowledge and resources to do that I recommend returning the hat back to the supplier to fix. It is fun to wear. It generates a lot of good conversations."
3.0,"When you load it up with the books, folders, and pencils and such it falls over.  The legs under it are not positioned far enough away from the wheels to be stable.  They end up in the middle with too much of the weight past them which makes it fall over."
3.0,"Warm, soft, and held well... until I gave 1 pair to my grandmother & it kind of stopped losing its grip to stay up (right under the knee). Wash it in a delicates bag in the washer. I don't think I caught it on anything, but something must have pulled at it. So it had 2  loose threads hanging off within a week and a half.  :/"
3.0,Expect these glasses to be Very large.
3.0,The sizing was accurate but I have a pouch after having 3 kids. I thought it was going to hold my tummy below my billy button but it didn’t. Not for women with a pouch.
3.0,shoe bags are smaller than what I thought.  May only be able to put one shoe in each bag - disappointment.
3.0,"The fabric is very thin. Almost sheer. The product is described as ""lightweight,"" and if that's what you are looking for, these could be fine. But I was expecting something with a little more heft to them."
3.0,Sizing for chinese or very small breast
3.0,It looks nice but it is way to small...
3.0,I dislike that you had to pin on the flower petals they look too lose and one of my pedals were broke  when I got go it
3.0,Looks nice but very cheap material...one petal fell off on the very 1st day I wore it :(
3.0,"These are great for things like wet swimsuits or shoes, smaller ones maybe for toiletries that may leak. They would also work for dirty clothing.<br />They are not cubes and they are not really for packing , other than as above. They are like slightly thicker ziplock bags."
3.0,"This dress is HUGE and if it weren’t for the fact that it’s super soft and comfy, I’d give it only 1 star. I’m 5’3 135lbs and this dress is a medium, fits me like it’s a size XXXL. It’s basically a very roomy moo moo. I still have the summer dress I wore when I was 39wks pregnant and this dress is nearly 2x the width of it lol. I bought it to sleep in and it is extremely comfy, so I’ll keep it."
3.0,"Great buckle when it works. 2 out of 3 required ajustment to make them work. The spring bars on the buckle side were actually straight bars so to remove them I had to open the buckle with pliers. Then open the hole which diameter was too small to fit a spring bar. All in all, expansive for 2 items that didn't work out of the box. Not necessarily the fault of the seller but the manufacturer. In any case it is usually hit or miss with Chinese QA not usually being consistant."
3.0,"I think I would have liked these better if they were cotton. I knew going into them that they weren't. I bought these so I could comfortably wear dresses to work (I'm a teacher). They ride up at times, causing me to need to adjust them in (at times in public....ahh!)"
3.0,Just a bit too small
3.0,So sad I had to return this item very pretty but it is not white it’s ivory color and I needed a white shawl I read the reviews prior to purchasing and it said it was white but yeah it is not definitely white they should actually change the description color on the item
3.0,Not the greatest craftsmanship put into this sword. The paintjob is kinda shoddy but for a kid it would be a fun toy.<br /> I bought it for my 4 year old son who had a blast with it even though it is longer than he is tall.<br />A piece of the guard broke off the 2nd day so I'd also warn this is  not really something that stands up to hard play even though it is fairly heavy and sturdy for being made of foam.
3.0,you have to go way up to fit this. it seem it was made for a little girl not my girl.
3.0,This dress didn't work for me.  I think maybe in a different color or size it might be better but the material looked a little bit cheap.
3.0,"I think this necklace is overpriced, it was made from cheap materials and it made my skin red and itchy after wearing for a day."
3.0,"This is cute, but bigger and more box-shaped than the picture. I bought it for my kid and she likes it, but because of its size and shape, I can tell it’ll be a pajama shirt."
3.0,"Quality of the bowtie was just fine, no complaints there. However, the color was very different than pictured, even considering differences in monitor color. Instead of ivory, this was a yellowish buttercream and looked garish next to an ivory shirt. Had to return it. No problems with the return."
3.0,Very nice little shoe. Not sure how it will hold up. Definitely order 1/2 size bigger
3.0,Plaid piece is plastic that is brittle
3.0,I loved this shapewear when I first got it but after a few days I noticed a little hole on the side.
3.0,It is a bit small hard to put on I do have bigger hands
3.0,"I love the color and reflective lenses. Green is my thing. In under 2 weeks of normal, light wear (outdoors, a few times a week, couple hours at a yime.. no harsh conditions, no physical damage, etc), the reflective exterior is flaking off quite badly. I generally wouldn't care"
3.0,"Super cute, but it no longer stays closed after only a few times of wearing it."
3.0,I don't care for these earrings.  I'm going to keep them but you can see the split in the plastic.  ??<br />I also might be too old for them or finding the exact right outfit is a  must.
3.0,Hooks in the front to open the blouse is a problem
3.0,Small and looks cheap
3.0,Larger then what was expected!
3.0,"Well the socks aren’t very compressive, I’m an average size 7 women’s and they feel like regular socks. I bought the sm/med.  i’m going to wash and dry them and hopefully maybe they will shrink a little bit and be tighter but to me again they just feel like regular socks ☹️"
3.0,Runs really small. Asian sizes. US size 8 is XL
3.0,"Very small, large necks beware!"
3.0,"Absolutely LOVE this bag. I hung up my old dingy coach purse for this baby. The cranberry is an awesome color too! The ONLY thing that bummed me out, was after about 2 months of daily use my main zipper broke. I still use the purse, but am going to be looking for other options."
3.0,"It is a little big, and I do not LOVE where they tied it off... right in the middle of the light colored beads :("
3.0,"Nice craftsmanship, just not the size I expected."
3.0,Fits like a mans shirt.
3.0,It’s a small purse
3.0,It is very pretty bit after opening it about 3 times and now the latch just swings open and purse won't close.
3.0,I liked the material but it kept falling down my arm while I was wearing them. I had to fuss with them all day. Good sun protection.
3.0,"I like the top but I am not a big fan of the shorts.  Other reviewers said they run a little small and advised to get a size larger than you normally would so I purchased a size 8 since I am a size 6 typically.  I am not someone who likes tight clothes either so I am not in denial over my true size. :). The rear fits not as loose as I like but not super tight.  However, the under shorts bathing suit bottom is another story.  They are the right size but when I read another reviewer describe the fit as &#34;weird&#34; that is pretty much it.  I have had the boyshort style bottoms before and they fit well but these I probably would only wear as a liner for the boardshorts.  You can't see in the picture but the boardshorts are kind of a sheer fabric.  I haven't wakeboarded in them yet but we'll see.  If anything happens I will update my review.  Their construction seems very good so I in no way expect them to wear out quickly.  I have sewn since I was very small and am reupholstering my fiance's boat so I can tell by looking.  It's mainly how they perform and look."
3.0,"I really like this top but I was expecting the fit to be loose like in the picutre, but it just fits. Generally I prefer a little more wiggle room."
3.0,"Small , size up 2 if u are a thick girl especially with curves"
3.0,"So, I wear a medium or large in things. I’m 5’7”, about 165. I bought a large, and wore it over a pair of jeans and a t-shirt to try it on. It seemed like it’d be warm enough, but it was awfully tight in the crotch area, which I thought was bizarre. I’m pretty active, and don’t need to feel restricted in my movement or comfort while I’m wearing something, so I’m going to return it. Also, the hood was way too big and floppy; if I’m wearing a hood in cold weather, I want it to be smaller/fit my head better so my head stays warm."
3.0,"I love this bag. It looks nice and is very roomy. But, after six weeks, the lining tore. I've never had that happen before and I'm not sure of the cause, but I will continue to use it. If the lining hadn't torn, I would have given it 5 stars."
3.0,Scratch really easy ...
3.0,It seems to run a little big.
3.0,The positive this is super soft and a nice material. I like the hood and front pocket. The negative is it is very long not quite a tunic length like the pic shows - it’s more like a dress or nightgown...which is what I’ll probably use it for. Doesn’t look anything like the picture in length. The top part fits tighter then expected and the bottom is huge.
3.0,Cute but I probably didn’t check out the dimensions very well. I couldn’t even get my iPhone in their.<br /><br />I can give to my daughter & her friend though
3.0,To thin to engrave on.
3.0,The jacket was a Christmas gift for a ski trip this week.  Zipper on pocket is broken & window to return is closed.
3.0,They are changing colors I taught they would change
3.0,"The scarf is a lot smaller than the picture entails, I would not be able to wrap it around myself like the picture displays. Additionally, there is a slight variation in the color of the scarf. I'd still wear it, but I wish it came larger, I suggest folding it diagonally to elongate it when it."
3.0,"These are ok. They are cute and functional, but the picture looks a lot better than the real thing. They seem pretty durable so far, but we will see. They are okay."
3.0,Cute and cheap but hard to get on and hurts your ear.
3.0,"I ordered a medium, I'm 34b and wear a size 5 or 6 and I was swimming in it. Still a pretty dress but didn't fit me well. Gave it to a friend, shes a couple sizes bigger and a couple inches shorter than me, and has large breast. She didn't care too much for the dress and thought it was too long."
3.0,I would really like these if they were a little longer. I am tall and these barely hit my ankles.
3.0,They are cute but very small
3.0,The socks are nice and thin but seams are a problem for me. They are sized to fit and slide into tight-fitting shoes or sneakers. Just get rid of that seam line over the toes. I may wear them inside out.
3.0,It is not the nicest shirt it is not good quality and the buttons are very flimsy but it is cheap and I couldn't find my size at walmart. Arrival was fast
3.0,"The dress fits great and looks amazing, but I wanted lavender not white."
3.0,I do love it but it broke my nose out it turned green my nose is sore I came and share a picture it’s so embarrassing
3.0,"Fits good looks good, logo is dead center so hard keep it visible."
3.0,"replacement pair, first pair one face design fell off"
3.0,Sizing is great if you want a really large realistic looking plastic chain. The paint on it seems to flake off a lot and the links disconnect really easily.
3.0,"Not worth returning but will only be worn around the house, and when I can’t find my other ones. They seem less strong than others I have with less magnification. And the lenses are super narrow - they look like costume glasses more than real readers. So if that is your thing, you might really like them."
3.0,"I love the way this dress fits but it's jersey. I ordered the purple and it is like grape soda purple, not my thing. I love it but am returning because I don't think the material will last without pilling and the color is so bad."
3.0,A bit over priced for what it is.
3.0,Cute but broke after 2 weeks..
3.0,"They both for as expected although the “nude” color is really more of a blush pink with an orange undertone. I did remove the padding circles inside because they were significantly smaller than a true cup size when ordering my size. However, my main issue is that once zipped, the zipper handle is super protruding and visible under shirts so it creates a huge bump. Not so cute. Outside of that they are great."
3.0,It’s really cute however you have to dump everything out of it to even get your hand in it. No place for your cards or anything
3.0,"Its super soft. A 3 piece set, but looks like its going to fall apart in the laundry."
3.0,"I was torn on how to rate these. They are well made and fit my 00 ears perfectly, but they are extremely light in color. I am very pale, and they are still too light for me to wear as a way to try and disguise my gauges."
3.0,Works but came damaged with a dent in the side.
3.0,Not impressef.
3.0,This skirt runs very small.  The material is thin polyester.  It didn't work for me and I returned it.
3.0,"I have bought this product before and really loved them but this time the sewing of the bottom material, did not line up evenly. At first I thought I had them pulled on differently, but nope! See photo. 😟"
3.0,The color doesn’t match the picture very well. It almost has a blue hue to it. I normally wear a 10/12 so I went with the 12 to make sure they would fit. The size 12 fit fine but due to how stretchy they are I wish I would have gotten a size 10. And under the distressing this chinch of fabric was hanging down. Quality is okay not great.
3.0,Ordered a size up and it still is not as loose as I wanted it to be. I normally wear a 2x so I ordered a 3x. It wasn’t right but not as loose as you’d want a sundress to be. Will be returning to size up.
3.0,"This is a beautiful print and the fabric is super soft, but the first one I received had a VERY uneven hemline.  I returned and tried again, and the second one is much better!  Knocking off one star for inconsistent quality control.  I am 5' 2,&#34; 118 lbs with a 32dd chest, and the small fits well--slightly fitted in the chest, and looser through the middle (which is to be expected from the style).  The white is a bit sheer, so I'll probably wear a cami underneath.<br /><br />Edit:  I THOUGHT I'd gotten a better product the second time around, but tried it on today and that is not the case.  The hemline is uneven again!  If you look at the photo, it is higher on my right side than the left. If I paid 10 bucks or so, it might be worth it – – however for this price point, I can do better.  Will be returning!"
3.0,the inner lining and padding has 'gone flat'
3.0,"They are looking beautiful, but they are much heavier then I thought… a need to move them up all the time! Also delivery is not so fast… you’ll have to wait for some time!"
3.0,It does not fit over ears properly
3.0,Its very pretty but it is too small. I got the large. I am 5'2&#34; with a pretty short torso and the length was still too small for me.
3.0,Thought these were perfect at first but at second wearing they bunch and wrinkle and don't fit against the leg.
3.0,Beautiful dress! Soo extremely bummed it was too small (it fit & zipped & all) but the arms cut in extreme bad and my breast were so scushed in it made me almost flat chested.... Fortunately by opening the arm holes a bit my mom was able to fit it.
3.0,Well this is one reason why I don't like shopping online. The quality of this is not what I expected but I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,"I'm not liking this dress mostly because of the material.  It will definitely wrinkle when washed and I don't want to iron it.  Also it feels impossible to wear it on the shoulders, because the sleeves just want to fall down.  I will return."
3.0,"5926 white 24 months, looks pretty on my kid. The issue is there is no button on the back and it is really difficult to get on. And the neck is also not that wide."
3.0,"More made for a small wrist... Maybe that of a younger teenage girl. Otherwise, this is a cute set. and worth the price."
3.0,"The mask didn't fit. It was too small. If you have a lot of hair, this may not be for you."
3.0,Thought it was a nice outfit when I put it on but through out the day the seams on the pocket started to tear I wore it for a 2hr kids party
3.0,Very lovely.  But way too small
3.0,Cute necklace but a little cheaply made.
3.0,Very pretty was to big Tho!
3.0,"I recently visited a labyrinth that was perched in a very scenic spot overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. Because the visit was so perfect I wanted some symbol to remember it by. This necklace is what I chose. The design is attractive and I like the silver tone (vs a gold). And the size is just right - big enough to see what it is but not so big that you feel you're wearing a small manhole cover around your neck. It's just that the pendant could have had more heft to it weight-wise based on what the photo suggested. A more high quality piece wouldn't be quite this light. The black cord also makes it look more like something you'd buy in a souvenir shop. But if you swap it out for a silver chain it will be more attractive and gift-like. The black cord lets you adjust the length. The seller also provides a nice little jewelry pouch that is great for storing or presenting the necklace. And they were very responsive wrt shipping - which I consider a must for anyone (including Amazon) selling on the Amazon site. So my rating is not saying the product is bad, just average. More weight to the pendant would have equalled 4 stars. That weight plus a silver chain (vs the black cord) would have made it 5 stars."
3.0,Definitely not red.  Burgundy.  Fabric and color are inappropriate for summer.
3.0,Socks fit. Batman car was destroyed. Had to fix with scotch tape and it looks bad.
3.0,"It was kind of tight through the shoulders, but otherwise, I really like the blouse."
3.0,I returned this. I think my body shape and size is not the right fit for this. Made me look and feel 10 sizes larger than I am. The fabric was soft and stretchey and the color was cute. i just didn't care much for the boot cut.
3.0,"Really cute, but if you are tall(5' 9&#34;) and plus size these hose roll horribly and just come over the knee. Not nearly wide enough for a 27' thigh."
3.0,It's not the same material as seen on the picture and the shorts roll every time I walk.
3.0,Isn't made for large chested women.
3.0,Returned...too small. Ordered next size up.
3.0,"Exactly what I was hoping for, almost. The item was described as 55mm and these are 53 :(. Other than the size these are exactly what I was expecting"
3.0,did not do what was supposed to do . sent them back
3.0,Nor linen. Also these are 1-2 inches short. I am 5’5 and 125 pounds and got a medium. They are plenty wide and too short.
3.0,Dress is big enough belt is way too small even though it's labeled xl
3.0,"Decent strap, not too comfortable"
3.0,"I like them a lot, but the left stick part (don't know what it's called) was attached wrong. It hangs on lopsided. That ruins the whole pair because I can't even bend it back into shape. Whereever they make these it must be with slave labor where the employees don't care to manufacture these correctly."
3.0,"The chain is extremely fine and difficult to adjust and, when adjusted, does not stay in place."
3.0,They do not fit tight at the calf and fall down if I walk.
3.0,The waist was not high. There is only one pocket. My phone barely fits in it. I may wear them in a pinch but I'm pretty sure these will be sitting in the bottom of the drawer most of the time.  I wouldn't suggest buying these.
3.0,This would have received more stars but the 'rope' it came with is pretty sub par. We like the stone itself however I really wanted to like it more. I will be replacing the 'cord' with something more a little more classy.
3.0,I like the polka dots but for the price I paid they would have been more appreciated if they did<br />not feel so cheap.
3.0,This runs big...very big. I typically wear a size 14/16 or an XL in tops. I ordered this is an XL. I am swimming in it. The length is great and covers my butt for wearing with leggings. I tried it buttoned and unbuttoned and it is super loose fitting with no shape what so ever. I would suggest sizing down by at least one size. Overall it would be very cute if it is in the correct size. The lace look on the sleeves is nice and not too delicate. It is a comfortable material as well.
3.0,Runs small. Very clingy material.
3.0,"I bought this bag for a 3 and a half week trip to israel and while i think this bag is good, it did not meet my needs on the weekend. I used it as my weekend luggage when we left our hostel and traveled around the country and it would only hold about 2 days worth of clothes, not including pjs,towels, or things like swim suits and my toiletry bag did not fit inside of it. But i do realize that not everyone will use this bag as i did. it did fit under the plane seat, i had no issues with it in the actual air port. I wish it had more pockets, but other than that if you are simply just using this as a carry on to hold maybe 1-2 days worth of clothes it would be a great backpack. It Just didnt fit my needs."
3.0,"These are really soft, very similar to LuLaRoe leggings. However, I was disappointed in the waistband. The waistband on these is just cheap elastic which is uncomfortable and does nothing to help your figure. I read other reviewers state that these sucked them in more than LuLaRoe and I have to totally disagree. These show all my buldges in an unflattering way. As long as I wear a loose long top, it'll hide the flaws. They were only $13 so I won't be returning them. I'll just wear them around the house."
3.0,This was a low quality product. It's not horrible but it wont be good after you wear it a few times.
3.0,The body fits well after being altered but the shoulders are too small. I usually wear a medium and got a large after reading the reviews. The shoulders were still too small and had to have the rest of the body altered because it was too big .
3.0,Love the color and style of the swim suit but I normal wear a large to and x large no problem . I got the X large and it has no give at all . I would need two sizes or a size bigger to be comfortable. But my sister likes so we will keep it for her .
3.0,"Very pretty and great fit around the waist but it was ridiculously long. A smaller size would have been too snug at the waist I think. I am average height, and there was about a foot of fabric trailing on the floor when Worn at the natural waist. The fabric of the skirt and sash was beautiful, and I liked the cut of the skirt. If you are handy with a sewing machine, it would be simple to hem the skirt. If I had had time and skill to hem it, I would have thought it worth the effort to alter."
3.0,"It's nice,  but the color is too light. I returned it"
3.0,Runs very large. Pretty and made well but they did not have it in a smaller size.
3.0,Really good looking functional gaitors- however after a few wears they pill up.  Would not re-purchase this item.
3.0,Pays the price.
3.0,This item was listed as a C cup on the website and the packaging.<br />It seemed true to size however it did not fit in the bikini top I received which was labeled as a C cup but turned out to be a medium.<br />I may keep these as they fit into another bikini top that I have (size large)
3.0,The glasses work well at night. Cuts down the glare.  The frames are cheaply built and are hard to keep clean.
3.0,Nice looking edges are sharp
3.0,I love this necklace!! But the clasp is broken & now I can’t wear it :(
3.0,The stitching frayed and tore in a short time after purchase. The actual black material was very nice.
3.0,"I bough XS for my  daughter. My daughter is 4.5 years old, 43"" tall and 42lbs and XS is very snug. Otherwise she loves it. The fabric on top is very light material so it's nice for summer."
3.0,"Top not really well made. Where there are ruffles, you can see the back of the garment that is white. There should have been double sided fabric on this part. It is also too short- and I’m only 5’1” !!!!"
3.0,The top was too small and the bottoms had too much fabric in the front.
3.0,Pretty.  Got what I expected for my money.  Would recommend for costume.
3.0,my wife's boobs were to big.
3.0,"The item looks fine, I have 1 and the other was a gift.  We both have the same problem, it keeps sliding off your ear."
3.0,"They arw pretty,  i expected the ribbon sections to have purple also but it does not the are just clear. And i wanted it purple throughout."
3.0,"Overall they're nice!  The compression feels good; I did however notice, when I removed them at the end of the day, I had  breast cancer ribbons impressions on my legs.  They did not feel too small but I am wondering if they are.  Maybe they're made for very skinny legs.  I purchased Dr. Motion compression socks and they do not leave impressions.  :-)"
3.0,"Something was off about the fit. It was the right size, but didn't hang right."
3.0,"The earrings are well made and they look fine, but they don't follow the curve of the ear as I hoped they would (and as they do in the photo)."
3.0,I have never tried a sticky bra like this because I am a 36DD. The product is okay. Everyone's pictures show exactly what the product is. I found that the adhesive worked well but there was a lot of bubbling around the edges and the bra provided some coverage but no lift.
3.0,I could not get this bracelet to stay on my watch. It would constantly pop out on one side.
3.0,This is a cute bracelet. It is thin and looks more expensive than it is. I read the reviews about it being small. Since my wrists are on the smaller size I thought it’d be okay. No. It’s very small.  It’s not easy to close the bracelet on my wrist. And when closed it is tight. Not a bangle at all. Unless you have very small wrists I’d pass.
3.0,"Pretty bracelet with great design but it doesn't fit an adutl wrist, so I returned it."
3.0,"Perhaps I didn't read the description in full - and if I didn't, then this is all my fault.  I didn't realize the center part is nylon or some such fabric, which is slippery.  The toe section and heel are cotton (or at least feel it), which is nice, but I don't' like the feeling of polyester/nylon on my feet; it makes my feet slide around in my running shoes which creates friction.  Nice quality, though."
3.0,"I was surprised when I received this top, as this said it is a blouse!<br />A blouse has buttons, and is usually a different material. this is a pull over, and the neck is a little larger.<br />The material is the same as a Tee shirt, and the ruffle is this same material,<br />Just gathered up, and sewed on. Cute effect.<br />The shirt is boxey with no form to it, as the picture shows it’s tucked in.<br /><br />Seems well made. The stitching is consistent.<br />I washed this and put it in the dryer it came out nice.<br /><br />I ordered a medium, I’m 5’2, 125 lbs.  fits me good, not tight,<br />I would say this is true to size. Like the color white.<br />It’s a cute summer Tee, for shorts, summer pants.<br />Think it’s pricey For $23.00. It’s a T shirt.<br />  This  is Not what I would consider a blouse just so you know what you will be getting.<br />4 stars"
3.0,Not authentic but decent. They appear like they will be more durable than Sony's.  The material feels more like what the PS3 controller was made out of. They were slightly smaller than the original sticks.
3.0,Husband loves the backside
3.0,It is so tiny.  I guess you pay for what you get.
3.0,"Mostly disappointed with these. The 'poly' dip was so thin that with one day, 'not even rough', use, it had mostly worn off and was getting holes in the fabric."
3.0,"I didn't expect much from this dress for $9.99 ... Just wanted to add to my holiday clothes. I was pleasantly surprised at how pretty it looked on, but only from the waist down.<br /><br />The bosom area doesn't blend and the fur trim doesn't flow.  The straps should be adjustable because the breast area is too high. And I didn't like the weird black stretch band in the back ... Why not make it the same fabric or even green to match?<br /><br />I did like that it zips up the side.<br /><br />I didn't mind the thinner halloween-costume type fabric, since it's not transparent.<br /><br />Overall, it was almost perfect but am returning. Oh, and they do run small. I wear a large and got an XL. A good fit other than the weird design at the top."
3.0,"This a beautiful top but, it runs very small and is kinda see through. My youngest daughter loves it so I gave it to her."
3.0,It looked great for the first two days until the middle charm fell right off.
3.0,"Fits as expected, looks cute when I wear with my Toms or ballet flats."
3.0,Came unstitched at the zipper the first month.
3.0,"The heads were good, but they arrived in a envelope and the heads were wrapped in cellophane with no padding. Both heads showed signs of damage. I have the skills to repair them, but better packaging would have made me much happier and improved my rating. Will not buy again."
3.0,"Like most all other comments, great bag, but not rugged. Something always rips, especially around the straps. But I use almost everyday. Perfect size for gym lockers, don't have to stuff it in like the others. For $15 it is somewhat disposable."
3.0,"Does the job it needs to do. Only issue is the color of the logo on the outside of this nice wallet. It's PINK! Pink does not show up in the photos that I looked at. It's the only complaint my son has for this product. If you don't mind pink on your wallet, then this is for you. Why ruin the beautiful browns on this, with a pink logo imprint.. In the photos it looks kinda of beige. I would have not gotten this for my son had I seen the true colors."
3.0,Item came quickly. Was exactly as described. After a couple of months of use a charm fell off but no was able to put back on.
3.0,Like the colour and length but robe is a little big to be medium. Guess one should have sized down.
3.0,Needs to be longer.....
3.0,Fabric bright and cheap
3.0,These are the same size as another pair I bought but they are smaller. The hem one one came undone and started to unravel.
3.0,This suit was very pretty. The cups were just too molded for me. I couldn’t imagine actually swimming in it.
3.0,"Was hoping they would stay in place better than other strapless bras.  It's about the same as others I've tried- as far as having to pull it up, although it is a very nice soft, comfortable fabric."
3.0,it's not as loose fitting as the pic shows it to be and it's short not as long as the picture.<br />Color  is as shown in picture (blue) and material is fair not as thin as other surprised that i have had before :)<br />I'm happy with the blouse ...
3.0,"It’s super cute, but the material is very cheap and will probably hold together for a few washes. Fit is good, and I love the style, but again, the material is not great."
3.0,Nice looking shirt but was too small for my son
3.0,Too Small for bring size 3-4 Yesrs old
3.0,My granddaughters wear a girls xl so that’s what I ordered. They arrived in good time but they’re more like a ladies Med. They’re pretty and fuzzy but order at least one size smaller
3.0,The model of the glasses is fine. The bad thing is that they told me they were not original. But
3.0,"I love the concept of this color-changing hat, however the words do not continue to change color.  I was on the beach for 3 days.  Day 1 the color of the words changed from white to a light blue/lavender color.  Day 2 and 3 the color no longer changed, it remained white.  It is a cool concept but it's unfortunate that the color doesn't continue to change in the sun."
3.0,"Looks substantial and nice, but the chain is a bit cheap and made my neck itch.  I like it enough to wear it when I have a low and wide cut top so that my chest isn't bare.  The earrings are quite cute and match the necklace well.  It is not overly heavy, and it doesn't look as cheap as some have stated it did.  It is costume jewelry, after all."
3.0,The purse looks just like the pic although it smells terrible. It smells like someone dipped it in gasoline and now I'm a little hesitant to give it as a gift. I'm hoping that it will air out overtime...
3.0,"Light weight (paper thin). You have to iron it. It’s shorter in the back than I thought it would be. I hate that part of it. Shoulders are a little tight. I’d go up a size for better function. Looks nice. If you want a good open front blazer with 3/4 sleeves I highly recommend one that Worthington brand has (fits great, don’t have to iron it, stretchy)"
3.0,The shirt is great quality for the price! Just may want to size up if you want it to hit below hip area.
3.0,"Read the reviews! This thing is SMALL. My bald head measures 23 inches, which should have fit perfectly in their ""medium"" size. It was cutting off circulation to my brain and wife had to perform an emergency haterectomy before I lost consciousness. Fit my daughter at 21.5 inches pretty well, but it's not her style. Fortunately it's returnable. Ended up getting the original. Walz caps for the win. It's worth the extra money.<br />The fabric here was fair, thin technical fabric that would not have caused overheating but I think my sweat would have disintegrated it after a season. Elastic at the back helped shape. Brim would flip up, except the sizing was way too small so that actually hurt when I tried. Color was true to image."
3.0,very very thin.
3.0,"these are great, but heavy on your ears. Because it is elastic it cuts into your ears."
3.0,These worked well for my purposes (i.e. decorating a large wooden figure in our garden.)  I would have liked them larger but these were fine.
3.0,I'm post surgery so maybe I just need to pull harder to get this around me. I bought this to replace my surgical binder. I will try it out again in a few months after my swelling comes down a little and I'm not as tender.  I'll be sure to come back and update my review.
3.0,"So I'm wrapping this Alimens and Gentle Women's plaid shirt as a Christmas gift for my wife and notice that the plastic bag it came in says ""Mens Collection"". If it doesn't fit you will be getting it back."
3.0,"These fit so weird. They look high waisted in the photos, the ones I received definitely are not. And the foil design seems to be peeling off already before I've ever even washed them. These are for an event so they'll work for a day"
3.0,"I sized up to Xl for reference I’m a 10/12 med/lrg, fits well it’s stretchy material, I can already tell it will pill by the end of the season"
3.0,Very difficult to clasp
3.0,"I bought this replacement lenses one year ago and I have used them since then. They look  and feel very good and high quality. Unfortunately after 10 month of use some spots (kind of inner bubbles) appeared in different sections of the lenses. I was very disappointed at that point, but because I liked them so much and the relatively decent price I decided to give them a second chance with a second pair or replacement lenses. We'll see...."
3.0,I guess you get what you pay for. The umbrella one doesn't hold any hair seeing as how it doesn't go deep enough once it hits your shoulders. Concept is cool but it doesn't deliver
3.0,"I bought two, same size, one fits nicely and the other one is to tight."
3.0,Not bad for the price.  The earring backs were some cheap plastic backing and lost both plastic earring backings within a few hours of putting them on.  LUCKY I realized it before either earring fell out so I did not lose them.  I  took some metal earring backings from another pair to hold them on.
3.0,"I really love these pants. Unfortunately they are not made for woman with thick thighs, the seam split the first time I climbed into my truck."
3.0,Nice fabric but center front seam crooked
3.0,"Smaller than it looks. Not what I thought it would be but I am keeping it, so it's good enough. Inside lining is loud and very cheap. Outside looks like an older lady should be carrying it. Again, I am keeping it so maybe it's not that bad. I'm just picky!"
3.0,"Laces are strong and sturdy, I like the bright color. But they're awfully short. You have to cut the ends off to use the little plastic fobs and I was not happy to lose 2 inches, as they're a little too snug now. After a few hours, hafta take the shoes off, so that's not good."
3.0,Perfect for what I needed it for. Costume like material.
3.0,"Didn't expect the design the way it ties at front. It looked bulky and awkward, but I made it work paired with a blazer."
3.0,"If you want fit like model, size up!!! I read reviews & bought 4 on lightning deal (size M).  I'm 5'6""; 128#; 36-27-34 & the shirt clings around hips (not my thing for a long tee).  If is was 2-3 inches shorter it would be fine (or 10 years ago when I was 115#- LOL)."
3.0,Already snagged and the material is pulling after one wear. Too wrinkly when it came out of the packaging...had a hard time getting the wrinkles smoothed out. Overall is very cute and my daughter liked it after wearing a long sleeve white t-shirt under it since she says the material is too itchy.
3.0,Black dye isn't color-fast. Warning - comes off on skin.
3.0,"My family bought 4 pair of these goggles for our resent ski trip.  Each of us had issues with the goggles fogging badly.  They're great looking and fit comfortably directly on the head or around a helmet, but the fogging made them virtually unwearable.  We won't be using these again.  We'll definitely spend money to buy higher quality goggles next time."
3.0,Fits smaller than expected. I bought the black one too- that fit much better. Am keeping the white one - hoping I’d lose some weight. :)
3.0,"Looked pretty and I liked the sleeve length but the tunic length was really long, almost to my knees so I had to return it. However the return was easy so props to the seller."
3.0,Good product but needs to be updated to correct color requirements.
3.0,It rusted and broke super quick.
3.0,The fit is good and I really like the purple. I have DDs and got the XL for that reason. I am not sure I like the fabric at the bottom though. It’s a heavier material. Is is extremely wrinkled right out of the bag. I’m hoping the wrinkles come out easily. I’m unsure of this purchase.
3.0,"Love the pockets, hate the top band, it's thin and uncomfortable."
3.0,"These got stars for cuteness. Seem well made. Irritated my daughters ears though, and she can wear almost any earrings. Not sure I believe they’re sterling 🤷🏼‍♀️."
3.0,Runs really small compared to their size chart.
3.0,"It works, but how can the cards not be scratched when they rub against each other all the time? I am not sure or convinced!!"
3.0,"Product came on time. The earring looks very cute. Perfect to go out for party. But one of the earring was lopsided, when i wore it one was up and perfect while the other one looks like it was hanging on my ear."
3.0,The shoes help the heel pain but aren't very flexible. It may need to be that way to keep the pressure off of the heel. I wear them for walking only. If I'm doing any other type workout I wear a different shoe.
3.0,This necklace is beautiful and it fits how I expected but the gold is already starting to fade at the connecting chain
3.0,"I’m 5’7” 205 lbs<br />I ordered a size large and it fit my body as expected, but I was not a huge fan of the flare at the bottom. Nice color but the material is cheap and has a funky smell straight out of the package. If you’re curious about this dress, I would definitely advise you to take advantage of Amazon Prime’s try before you buy so you can see how it looks on you before purchasing it."
3.0,I bought two of these bracelets for my older daughters for Christmas.  The links are nice and it’s a very light bracelet.  But the only problem is the round lock.  It’s just a pain to put on by yourself.  I would of liked to give it a higher rating but because of the lock I gave it three stars.  All in all my daughters love it.
3.0,The “I 💙 U” is not Duffy cut out
3.0,"Super itty bitty. Placed these on each keychain. Nice, but way too small. Wish they were slightly bigger."
3.0,They were ok..
3.0,Too small and made with cheap material
3.0,"It's an alright made leggings... However yes it's too sheer, kinda long, great high waist. I'm 5'9, 170 and its was long, fits loose around the ankles and calve areas. You bend over and you might as well smile cuar use its sheer."
3.0,"Overall they are nice shorts and do stretch h when bending and moving around. I usually like my shorts just at my knees maybe lower but these are a good 2"" above my knee when standing and I'm 5'10"" with shorter legs so someone with long legs may want to think twice if they want longer shorts."
3.0,"Brought it for my daughter who is short 5'1 not a heavy girl.. it was to tight around her neck, & face."
3.0,Color is good.
3.0,Decent hat nothing to write about
3.0,They are slouch socks but the fit small where your foot bends!
3.0,Extremely smelly and not breathable but worked great for what we needed. Very plastic.
3.0,"Do not wear nylons or leggings as it will snag them all up, the bottom of the slip is rough.  Worked for what I needed, just tossed the nylons."
3.0,"NOT WATERPROOF!!!! WATER RESISTANT, WATER LEAKS THRU SEAMS!! Amazing jacket, besides not being waterproof, it's a awesome jacket!!! Well built, and zippers are high quality!"
3.0,"The fabric is very pretty and so is the color. I didn’t like the printed flowers, I thought it was embroidered. Had to return it. But if you’re planning on getting it, I would just order two sizes smaller than usual. Large looked like a 1X. Overall a nice dress for work."
3.0,Looks light blue.  Disappointed.
3.0,"This is really cute and looks great on my Kay Charmed Memories bracelet!<br /><br />Edit: I noticed recently when wearing my bracelet that this charm keeps falling upside down because of the weight of the pearl. It looks just as good with the pearl facing downward as it does upward, but I my personal preference would be for it to stay upright. I'm currently looking for something I can do to keep it upright, like some rubber/silicone ring I can put inside it."
3.0,"Love the shirt but the one i received was like a tent on me.  Have to send it back and get a size...or two, smaller."
3.0,Nice material but I haven't washed it yet. If it holds up I might get another. I don't like the buttons but I just don't like gold. Wish they we're silver.<br /><br />Looks less attractive now that I have washed it. I would not buy this again.
3.0,"The design is on point, the string however was weak, when i went to put it on my wrist it popped!!! Thank got my sister makes bracelets and i was about to have it fixed so i coukd wear it"
3.0,I like this fish hook necklace but bigger than I really wanted. Also it was hard to cut and shorten the necklace because it was way too long for me. But it is a pretty necklace. The problem with it being too big is my fault should have looked at the measurements closer.
3.0,Comfy Lounge Pants
3.0,Cute mask but it seems to run small. It’s a huge struggle to get it over my 5 y/o’s head. It’s also hard to get the filter to stay in place.
3.0,These worked out fine for our weekend use but most of the bags didn’t hold up for much more use.
3.0,Love these earrings. Would give 5 stars but 2 stones have already fallen out! I found 1 & glued it back in. The missing 1 is at the bottom so I can still wear them. I am going to put clear nail polish over them so I don't lose any more!!
3.0,"Was hoping for at least a nicer package, but it arrives in a cellophane bag, with nothing more than the amazon ASIN on the label.  not very appealing if intended for a gift. Otherwise, they arrived on time,  quality appears fine, and the price was right. get past the package and all is good.."
3.0,Waistband is very tight for a large.  I can add a piece of elastic to make it more comfortable.  Otherwise it is a lovely skirt
3.0,"Would not stay latched. Especially if you like your belt snug. When seated the release button gets accidentally pushed, causing the belt to release. Nice looking, but does not work."
3.0,"A little big and a bit thinner material then expected, but still very cute!"
3.0,"too hot, and the bottoms aren't weather proof"
3.0,"I loved everything about these except for the skull hands seem to catch on every little string on my shirt or pants..or towel. The fingers stick out a little bit from the gem is what is causing it, but that's the only issue I've had."
3.0,"My daughter wears a 4/5 so I ordered her the 3/4 figuring we if it’s a little short we can tuck into the tutu. Well the shirt is more like a 5/6, sizing is off but what do you expect for the price. You get what you pay for that’s for sure"
3.0,"Very pretty love the look. However even though they say sensitive ears, we have discovered quickly that my daughter is still allergic to them."
3.0,I like this purse it is cute but a little bit to small. Which is the case with most of the western and concealed weapons purses so that sucks
3.0,I preferred the Ecty dresses in this same style though I loved the pattern on this dress.  I am only 5’2” and it seemed the dress was made for a smaller woman.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, just wish the fabric was a better material. It feels like umbrella type fabric. The dress is also not as full as the picture. I think this is a knock off, im not sure. Its very see thru, material not thick enough."
3.0,"The luggage set is really cute.  However, I returned them the day after they were delivered because they were too small, seemed cheaply made, and had a weird and strong odor."
3.0,"It's cute, but really bad quality. Not worth $12."
3.0,Very warm I work out door so this was a good choice.
3.0,"The graphics on this shirt are really cute but this is cotton so no give and it is at least a size too small. It is part of the risk of shopping online , but I wish we could get more consistent with sizes. I wear a size 18, sometimes a 16. If I put this on it is skin tight."
3.0,"They are a little flimsy, but work."
3.0,"some of the gems are off center, none have fallen out though as of yet.  Gems fit snuggly in the actual stem but the plastic is so hard that its easy to tear it when your putting the gem in.  This flat backing on the inside of your mouth is also a little uncomfortable but that could just be me.  Not a bad product but I think I'm just going to stick with metal, bad for your gums or not, its the only thing I seem to like."
3.0,Ok quality and seems large enough.
3.0,"Got these for my wife. She loved the black and blue colors, but the black shirt stained the white shirt. The white shirt had a dark square on it from where it contacted the black inside the package. I requested a 1/3 refund on this order and Amazon granted it to me. Gave the white shirt to goodwill."
3.0,Didn't like that the set only came with the sister outfit even though the title and description says sister and brother matching set.
3.0,Love but rim is permanently bent funny due to packaging when shipped
3.0,It looked better online than it does in person. Does seem to offer support for my foot pain. Only had them about a month.
3.0,The material is a tad cheap and tends to itch.
3.0,Used this to put in our birthday party favor bag as part of a Star Wars themed party. It was OK for the price but some of them didn't work because it looked like they were turned on and the battery drained.
3.0,"Ordered this in periwinkle, black and white... the black and white fit great although the white is too see through to wear w/o a bra. Tops are kinda thin.. Was disappointed with this periwinkle as when it arrived it was sky blue"
3.0,Good quality but the outfits were ordered in the smallest size and fit my 18 month niece! Bummer but I will hold onto them until they fit him.
3.0,Size:16<br />211lbs.<br />Ordered a XL. Fit me like a 3x. Just starting my return. ordering a MEDIUM. Im fearing the Large will be too Large! I need this fixed within 7 days. I will be back with an update.
3.0,I love that it’s comfortable and it holds my locks. But it took so long to come they said two days it to two weeks. I won’t order from them again but it is a good produc.
3.0,"I too fell prey to the infomercial and ordered these from the website.  I was so excited about giving these away as presents that I ordered FOUR.  Brilliant, right?  Afterwards, I came here to share my excitement and was deflated to learn they were crap.  So I immediately set about cancelling them.<br /><br />For those of you who find yourself in a similar position, follow these steps.  1.  Vigilantly look for the confirmation in your email that they received your payment and it's being posted. 2. Copy the customer ID#.  3. Go to the [...] website they post in the email.  This will take you to your order. 4. Enter your name and paste in the customer ID # you copied from the email.  5. Click the CANCEL link on the left side and follow the directions.  If you did this correctly, you will see a small note in the upper left corner saying that your cancel order is being processed and that it will take 24 - 48 hours.  It didn't take that long for me.  I checked back later in the day and noted the order had been cancelled.  Check to make sure there are zeros in the balance column.<br /><br />And that's it.  Painless fix to a stupid move.<br /><br />Now I'm not entirely sure about this but I THINK you only have 3 business days for things to go this smoothly.  So I hope you catch it in time to cancel and get yourself out of this mess before you are stuck with a product you can't use.  Good luck!<br /><br />I'm giving them 3 stars as some positive reinforcement for having this option in their customer service site and that it went so smoothly."
3.0,"I really like the material and how light these shirts are. They are thick, yet felt like they would wick away moisture really well. My only complaint is the size discrepancies, and the arms are loose. Im 5ft 10inches 32inch waist 166lbs. I ordered the med and it fit fine on my chest and back, not the arms or length. I ordered the 2pack and they are both a different size. i gave it 3 stars because of the sizing."
3.0,Way bigger than expected.
3.0,"Nice dress, but pockets add bulk to hip area. I'm curvy in the booty and hips and did not think this fit was flattering on me."
3.0,I loved it! but definitely runs big!
3.0,Runs too small. I ordered a 12 size which normally in other brands runs large. I can’t use it for my little girl.
3.0,"Not tight like surgeon's gloves.  They slip off easily when you take them off.  Usually I have to work to get Large size gloves off my hands.  These are more like XL and just have a different feel.  Half way between plastic gloves and rubber gloves.<br /><br />Okay for quick jobs, but for detailed painting and spraying jobs I prefer typical snug nitrile gloves because they give you better fine dexterity."
3.0,I’m torn with this product. I like to change purses and use a cross body purse while shopping etc.  I found this to be perfect  toss in a few credit cards and some cash and go<br />I think in the shirt term it’s effective.  I asked my husband and he’s more of a traditional wallet guy so this wouldn’t work for him.
3.0,The bottoms fit fine and the material was nice but the top was too blousy. I'm a bigger girl with a bigger chest and it was not flattering at all. I ended up returning it.
3.0,"I ordered a Large, way too small!! The large fits like a small, I gave it to my 13 year old. Very disappointed. I had purchased a similar shirt the week before and it was very true to size"
3.0,"These gloves are not as heat resistant as most heavy dirt rubber gloves.  If you use hot water to rinse your dishes, you can really feel the heat."
3.0,i was disappointed when  i got my cardigan and it turned out the color the picture showed on seller's page  isn't  what i received in the mail. i almost send it back and i don't usually return item once i got the right thing. But i like the softness  and light weight  to it so i kept it but i will return item next time i get the wrong color. This was my third purchase from seller and was pleased with my first two items white and  gold cardigans.
3.0,"Love the pattern and quality of the dress, just didn't fit as I had expected it to, ran on the small size"
3.0,im sending it back
3.0,I love the fabric. But this is not the size as stated. Order one size larger if you want a loose fit.
3.0,Cute but WAY smaller than other T5 shoes
3.0,These headwear are very thin. There’s not much to them. I bought them to give as gifts. Two of the receivers said they were tight but breathable.  Shipping was quick.
3.0,Beautiful but runs very small.
3.0,"These were so cute and I really wanted to love them. If you're just wearing them for style, go for it! If you're wearing them for exercise, I don't recommend it. I'm a bit of a curvier girl. I wear a size 12/14, but my waist is around 10 inches smaller than my hips. These fit a bit like pantyhose in that the waistband is not strong enough to stay flat. It rolls on me. Again, if you are more slim, these would be perfect because they're so cute."
3.0,"Something to be aware of, the pattern doesn't run both sides of the belt. When you wear a ring belt, the side which is pulled through the rings for fit faces out (back side of belt). The back of the belt is a olive green color which looks a bit odd against the pattern. Other then that, construction of the belt is good. Made in China."
3.0,Cute but runs big. Had to return
3.0,Very comfortable but I had to give them to my sister because they ran very small
3.0,It’s not as long as ties of the same brand
3.0,I wasn’t sure if it gave me better range but seems to keep video signal stronger
3.0,"It kind of looks like junk jewelry. I may wear it for fun, but that's it. It's not a great quality piece."
3.0,Fits well but it’s very short. I’m 5’4” and it’s very short on me.
3.0,"Took forever to arrive, but considering where it came from, I'm not that surprised. It's a pretty piece of costume jewelry. It's not a high quality made necklace, but you get what you pay for.  It'll be a lovely accessory with my turtle and cowl neck sweaters. I'll certainly enjoy it for what it is, for as long as the necklace will last."
3.0,"Nice quality, but somewhat small"
3.0,Very cute but the costume itself was way too big. Returned.
3.0,If I looked like the picture I'm sure it would hit every curve. However its size is off by about 30% in the wrong direction.
3.0,Not sure what the attached shorter strap is supposed to do except get in the way.
3.0,"I like the pendant -- but I received a rectangle selenite. Keeping it, but disappointed it wasn't what I ordered. Still, a great value based on what I paid."
3.0,I didn't get a pouch which I though came with it.
3.0,Lovely pattern and material<br />..but cut very small.  More closely sized.for.petite women
3.0,"Incredible for the price, but really nothing too special overall"
3.0,"The S and XS, when I laid them on top of each other, looked exactly the same size. For reference, I am 5'6&#34;, 125 lbs, & typically size 2/4/6 in normal US dress sizes.<br /><br />I bought the S first and it was so baggy - even with the belt - that I wanted to try the XS. However, as stated above the XS was the same size. Neither had a size tag, only a sticker on the bag.<br /><br />While the dress was really baggy, width-wise, the under layer lining was really short hitting at mid-thigh. Maybe if you're shorter or comfortable with shorter dresses, this would be ok. I was buying this for a work party, so I was looking for something more classy.<br /><br />The quality of the dress was good otherwise - the color is a more bluish-red (rather than pinkish-red) which looks better on more light olive skin brunettes. The quality of the construction was good."
3.0,"This is so soft and snuggly. Super cute! I love that it has a double zipper. It can be zipped up from the bum to change a diaper, or down from the neck to change clothes.  I do not like the fit though, I got a 4-12 month for my 6 month old (18lbs and 27&#34;).  It barely fits the length of his body, fits the length of his legs well, but is very wide and the arms have to be rolled two or three times. My son gets very upset that he can't keep his hands out to grab stuff.  It will not last us more than a few weeks (maybe not even a. Wash cycle) due to the short torso."
3.0,"Nice silky cotton, I didn't wear it on a beach but I could see how it would be absorbent and helpful in that setting. However, I would like to point out that which you cannot tell from pictures, this is basically two rectangles sewn together with openings for your arms. There are no real sleeves to speak of. That being the case, it tends to slide down my shoulders and doesn't do a great job of covering my backside."
3.0,Definitely order a size up! Ran a little tight around my legs.
3.0,Purchased the suggested sz but I felt was too small.  Did not provide the support as described in specifications or represented in photos
3.0,I love this shirt. I attract all the ladies in this fine golden paisley pattern. I feel like I'm back in the 1970's smoking a dubee before the disco when I put on this shirt.
3.0,"This tie is NOT yellow. It is absolutely a golden color, which is a big difference from the photos. It makes a difference when you’re trying to match colors. Other than the color being off, it’s fine. I’ve attached a photo of the tie compared to a manila envelope and a yellow Lego."
3.0,"Super cute wristlet, but my iphone 6 plus barely fits in it. I put it in there once and when I took it out the zipper scratched my screen up pretty bad. You can also see glue dots along the zipper line. I still use it for my cards and cash but I'll probably be looking for something else that will hold my phone too."
3.0,"I have returned this item. The bras are pretty and seem to be of reasonable quality. I can't speak to how they stand up to washing because I only tried one on. They have a two hook closure which means a thinner back strap, which was not my preference. My cup size is between a C and D. I am over 70, with the unfortunate effects of gravity :-). I am more interested in extra support than decolletage. These bras have the standard padding that you would expect, but there is an extra padded contour to the outside that pushes the breast toward the center. That was to much for me.  The final ""no sale"" for me was fully elastic straps. Anyone with heavy breasts will not benefit from the extra support these bras may give...WAY to much bounce for the ounce. If you are an A or B cup you might give them a try, but I don't recommend for anyone C or above."
3.0,"First buy the large size that is my size and turned out too big, then buy it in M and it is still big as if the size did not correspond to the size. Never in my life has been a small and my measurements correspond to an L, if it is going to buy calculate 2 sizes more"
3.0,"The fit is great, easy to move around in, but this pattern is most definitely sheer. I'm a yoga teacher and this brand has been my go-to for a while - hoping the sheer fabric is a one-off and that 90 degrees by reflex isn't going the same 'less fabric for more money' route as others...."
3.0,"Overall decent short with defects. strongs get lost without even trying, i had to use scissors to get them out. also the pockets are super short/shallow that my cellphone will fall out if i job or do anything active. if i walk slowly the cellphone barely stays in the pocket. this is the biggest thing that bothered me. good value though if you are looking for something that gets the job done, without great craftsmanship. Shorts are thin but good for being active."
3.0,Got what I expected - Funny smell but it went away after a few days. Highly recommend for an inexpensive wallet.
3.0,The shirt fits nice. I want aware of the blend of the polyester and cotton it's about 70% polyester and 30 cotton it's the feeling almost swimsuit . It has time hold for air.
3.0,"I was suspicious about the A/B sizing and was right to be. I'm a 34B and spilling out of the cups a bit, they're definitely A cups. The bra functions even though the fit isn't great. Oh and it came with a matching thong as a surprise gift... But it's an XS, so much for that."
3.0,"Okay. So this one was a heart breaker. The color is gorgeous, but somehow, it fit everywhere but the waist - it left a gap in the front that made it unwearable."
3.0,"They fit nicely and look professional enough to wear to work. Two drawbacks: 1) I have to hand wash them, because even on gentle cycle in the washer, the fabric started to &#34;pill&#34; after two washes. 2) Worse, the side pockets are so shallow that nothing is secure in them.  I dropped folded dollar bills, keys, cell phone out of the pockets -- so I can't use these pants at work without carrying an additional bag of some type around the halls with me."
3.0,Its not that bad at all for a kid ..my son is gonna be 9 here soon ..its a gift for him ...its better in some ways than it looks an it is alittle rough on the pendant may find some flaws but like i said its not bad ..kinda worth it .
3.0,Fit too small and thus were too tight
3.0,"Super cute but runs small. Not just in size all around but in length. I am 5’4” and have a normal size torso and in order to get my arms through and snap the back, I had to give myself a wedgey. Not a lot of coverage in the bottom. It is high waisted bottom the top gives a flattering slimming optical illusion but far to short. I normally wear a 6 in bottoms ans got the medium. Too small. For sure go up in size but still could be too short. Like it’s made for petite ??<br />Returned but contemplating the next size up"
3.0,It did not work as well as my regular bandana does.
3.0,"Pros: comfortable, non-irritating metal, well made.<br /><br />Cons: the stones are incredibly tiny and do not sparkle. I wanted small earrings but I was disappointed by how dull the stones look in person. I think these would be best for a young girl if anything but too small/dull for most women."
3.0,Pros: lenses are polarized and feel like good quality<br />Cons: the arms are super flimsy and don’t fit snug against my head so they feel like they could fall off or break at any moment
3.0,They are very tight for there size and are falling apart
3.0,"they are really really soft and super stretchy but  the ones with pockets don’t look good because the leggings are so thin and the pockets are in the front so it looks kind of like a Jean pocket and you can see it and it looks weird, i’m usually a medium in leggings so I got the small medium size and they probably could fit someone who is in a large extra-large because they’re super stretchy but not see-through so I really like them but the pockets just look too weird"
3.0,The earrings are not exactly as the photo displayed.
3.0,Cute style. I ordered to large. I am 5'4 140 lbs. waist 35 in.  Usually I am pretty good at picking the correct size not on this skirt though. Don't let my mistake discourage you because it is a cute hippie style. I returned it.
3.0,"The description says it's leather but it doesn't look, feel or smell like leather. There's no tag anywhere stating that it's leather. It is a nice looking bag that seems like it would hold a lot and wear well; just be aware that it's probably 'pleather'."
3.0,I feel like one pair was smaller than the other two.
3.0,What I received is nothing like the photo. Made of very thin sweatshirt material and tiny pockets are for show!
3.0,"I bought this hat as prop for a shoot, so I knew I shouldn’t expect a lot for the money. The lens on the goggle fell off as soon as I opened the package, so had to glue them on. The pictures came ok and I got the shot that I wanted."
3.0,"Love the shirt, except the spelling of ""should"" is wrong."
3.0,Beautiful but gigantic. The main issue was the zippers.
3.0,metal is bended
3.0,Want going to pay to have it returned. I had to put snaps and claps in the front where there were large gapping spaces.  It is cute but runs 2 sizes too small
3.0,The cut is nice but waaay too small. The xl fits like a medium.
3.0,underwear arrived in fine time as promised. was surprised the texture has changed over the years and<br />ill still buy them hpwever the size was a bit too big so they changed that. if you get some you might consider<br />buying a size smaller than usual
3.0,Is NOT  for people with big boobs but fits everywhere else
3.0,"The earrings are just what I wanted in terms of size, but the earring clasps are already messed up and won't stay in my ears. I've only had the earrings two months! You would think that they would be a better quality based on the price! :-("
3.0,"Super cute the day they wear it, then it shrunk up to nothing and she can never wear it again"
3.0,"The glasses it's self are very cute! Like an Audrey Hepburn style! However, they aren't very sturdy. I had to send it back."
3.0,This bag is so so. The snaps make the opening distort. It is a good size. I use it to carry work items in. I will be looking for a more securely closing bag but will use this until I find one.
3.0,"I expected a cotton dress, but it's actually a shiny, knit synthetic material. Seems well sewn, just cheap-feeling fabric. The print was duller than I expected. But for the price, it's a fine dress. 5'6&#34; and 118# and the medium was a loose fit on me, but still looked good."
3.0,Very cute but small. I am an adult medium woman’s size 8 and it barley fits me
3.0,"This is my own fault, I missed the part of the description *somehow* that said the necklace part is plastic. I was wanting a thin silver necklace. That said, its not bad I suppose, I'm going to keep it and see what I think. The quality seems okay, the plastic part seems very sturdy at least. the charm is very pretty."
3.0,"Disliked the quality of the material.  While putting seat belt in vehicle, the material shedded on the belt.  It was worn as every day attire.  It is soft fabric.  Comfortable except for what was mentioned."
3.0,I had a charge 4 and the C&L bands fit perfectly but I have a charge 5 now and all the C&L bands are way too big
3.0,It rolls down off the heel. Have to keep fixing
3.0,"It's a really pretty piece with a long chain, however my chain broke the first time I tried to put it on and then the bottle broke right after"
3.0,Color not what expected; navy is what I wanted.<br />Fabric ok.<br />Opening too big; slips Down off my face.  Maybe should have optional sizes for women and men
3.0,"Decent but very big and quite heavy in my opinion. I bought it as a gift for my mom, a tiny lady and I don't think she will like a big watch on her tiny wrist... Overall looks fine though..."
3.0,It wasn’t as good as the picture but what you would expect for the price! My 14 year old daughter was happy enough.
3.0,some what on the large side. looks much better in the picture.
3.0,I loved the color. Most of my pants are 16 or some 18. I went with XL & they were huge! Still waiting on my refund!
3.0,"Much longer than expected, got a small and it is almost to my knees and I am 5'6"
3.0,"It is a super cute accessory for my daughter's Rapunzel costume, but after only using it for a couple weeks the headband snapped in half. She still uses it because she loves it but it doesn't really work."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:e2f26b390702c8d465297404087150a0]]
3.0,"nice material...way too small...even the 4x is more like 1x..i couldn't even get it over my shoulders..meh, I'll give it away"
3.0,2.5 because the mold sticks out of the grills and messes the look up.
3.0,"I was really excited to get this ear cuff. Its beautiful, but not really what I was hoping for. For starters, when it arrived, two of the pink &#34;feathers&#34; fell off. Its an easy fix with glue, of course. The thing that I don't like about this, is that there is no security once its on your ear. There is no actual cuff, or anything to attach to your ear. You just slide it on, and fit your ear between the two long, curved pieces. I have long, thick hair and it often gets caught in earrings. I'm afraid that when it does get caught, piece will go flying off and break. Other than that, its not too heavy, its pretty, and its about the size of a palm."
3.0,"Didn't get the colors that I wanted. Quality is ok, but you do need to double them."
3.0,They smell really bad I had to put them straight in the wash. Also I thought they would be more form fitting. I usually wear medium but these medium fit me like a large size. The fabric is a little shiny. Won’t be ordering again
3.0,Botton locations too far left. Had to resew to better locations. Loop belt at back very loose. Had to adjust button locations. Otherwise fit and length was fine. Customer service was okay.  Would have returned and suggested customized fit up but I decided to refit myself.
3.0,The style was actually very tight in the leg.  Not what I would define as loose.
3.0,I ordered the white lace dress and it was cute but it was very see-through.
3.0,It's a bit small & I have small wrist
3.0,I had to return it. Too big & I'm not good at removing links. Otherwise it was a nice watch.
3.0,They cost a lot of money and they are already turning colors
3.0,"These laces look nice, but I have to use a double knot to keep them tied. And that makes them look wonky. These ended up not being the right lace for my shoes."
3.0,They look good but barely make a sound.
3.0,Está bonito
3.0,"Nice quality, but smaller than I thought. I may return it for something larger."
3.0,I got a small but it is still kinda baggy. Still cute though
3.0,"We own already from a different brand 4 colors, but because we are family of 5 i needed 1 more color, they work perfect and each person is so easy to pack like this! the quality is ok for the set, i do not like the brand name on the front but that is a personal preference and the only the front zipper the cord to pull it they have come of on some of the zippers, again not a problem.<br />If i could have bought another color of the other sets i have bought i would have done that, this brand gave me the option to make my packing to my 5 person solution!"
3.0,"Soft, comfortable pants, but not sweat pants.  These are made of a thin, soft fabric that would make great lounging or pajama pants."
3.0,"quick delivery, watch is functional for its price."
3.0,Way too big. Didn’t have a chance to return as I was on vacation a day after arrival.<br />Tried to print return off my email and it would not do. Tried day before vacay.<br />Too late after vacay. Can you help?<br />I have printed other items off my email.<br />Ugh!
3.0,"As much as the minimalist wallets appeal to me, I do often have enough cash on me to still prefer an actual billfold. Given that my current one was really starting to show its age, I decided to give this one a try.<br /><br />The first thing that appealed to me was the RFID blocking, something lacking in my current (old) wallet. Unfortunately, I don't have a way to test this feature, so I'll just have to take the word of the manufacturer that it works.<br /><br />The leather utilized for the wallet is pretty thin. Will this be an issue in the long run? Hard to say. Not all leathers are equal, and some types of leather are thin and extremely durable, while some thicker leathers just don't last at all. So without knowing exactly what kind of hide was used for this wallet, the thickness is no real gauge of durability. Time will tell.<br /><br />I don't carry a lot of cards, so I found the capacity of this wallet to be just fine for my needs.<br /><br />The only thing I was slightly disappointed in with this (and it's not a deal breaker) is that the ID holder is sewn into the wallet. With my old wallet, the ID holder could be removed, allowing for an extremely light and simple option if I'm going somewhere, don't require my full wallet, but still want my ID and maybe a single credit card with me. For example, if going for a bike ride, or to walk the dogs. Again, this isn't a big deal, and adding this feature would not only increase the thickness of this wallet, but likely also increase the cost due to the added leather required.<br /><br />Overall, this is a shockingly low price point for what is advertised to be a genuine leather, hand crafted, RFID blocking wallet, that utilizes very obviously photoshopped images of its manufacture. The realist in me assumes this means corners were cut somewhere. I once again wish Amazon allowed half-stars in their ratings. I'm not quite willing to give this 4 stars, but feel that, for now, it deserves 3.5.<br /><br />In a few months, after this wallet has had a chance to break in, I'll come back and update the review (assuming the seller is still around)."
3.0,"Just needed some cheap shower shoes and these did the trick. They form nice to my feet, but they're stiff. Maybe they'll soften after a few wears, but I wouldn't use them on a long walk. Note this review is after using them once."
3.0,Cheap but does the job
3.0,I was really hoping it was as vibrant as the pic… mehhh letdown .. but it will work with the shirt I will pair it up to for my nephew.
3.0,"This is just an OK wallet.  I got one for Christmas last year, and I am going to need a new wallet this year.  The wallet has a lot of features, some more successful than others.  However, if you buy this wallet thinking it will magically make your current wallet much thinner, you are mistaken.  The only thing that will do that is getting rid of a bunch of the stuff you keep in your wallet.  If you have 10-15 credit, insurance, licenses, and other assorted cards...your wallet will be fat.  If you have a bunch of business cards, it will be fat.  If you have a month's worth of receipts, it will be fat.  If you have a lot of money in it, it will be fat.  Any combination of those, it will be fat.  The idea here is that you downsize, and from what is left, there is a well thought out spot for those frequently used items.  I found the exercise to be beneficial, but I don't think I would have gotten much worse results from another comparable wallet.  Things I really didn't like about this wallet include: (1) the leather (it is too soft and doesn't wear well); (2) the extra card slot behind your license (this ends up making the wallet fat and it leaves a credit card sized impression on the backside of the wallet if you have more than one card in there (I have 4--my insurance, prescription card, a key FOB, and a bar card, which because there is only three credit card slots, I have no place else to put); (3) the hidden bill pocket is a nuisance to actually use (I tried to store my receipts in there when I travel for business, b/c they can fall out of the regular section, but using the flap is cumbersome especially if you have money in the exposed bill section).<br /><br />All in all, you are paying extra for a wallet that, in my opinion, doesn't have high enough quality leather to last more than a year or so.  I think at this price point, you should get at least two years out of a wallet.  I do like the fact Bellroy has a three year warranty, but of course, it only covers defects and not wear and tear.  I don't think this wallet can handle three years of use without incurring substantial wear and tear, which again is my primary gripe. Ultimately, If you want a thinner wallet, the only thing that will do that is downsizing what you put in it, and that is something that will work for any new wallet.  If you are very gentle on a wallet, then it might be a good choice.  If not, I would look elsewhere."
3.0,This sunglasses is beautiful and light but huge.<br />They are made in Italy and well done but again they are really big.
3.0,"The shirt is cute, but the quality is low.  Very thin material. This shirt is way overpriced."
3.0,what an amazing price point for this product although i am a bit confused about that minor difference in price between small and med/large.
3.0,I got a medium based on reviews. And i normally wear smalls. And the length is perfect but its super wide. Like twice the width of a normal shirt...
3.0,Kinda dissapointed when it arrived with some stones off.
3.0,"Nice shirt but the bottom is longer on one side,  than it is on the other."
3.0,Adjustable but very baggy in the rear
3.0,"Bathing suit color accurate and sturdy build, bottoms run a little small, weird round pads that don’t fit well inside bikini top that are really prominent and visible making them not useful as modesty nipple coverage."
3.0,Too tight! And rolled down!
3.0,"Blue dress with Mesh top overlay. I bought the size that correlated with my 11 year old, I had to pin the dress around the waist which was fine but what I didn't like was there was pieces of plastic/trash stuck in the mesh top that we could not get out. Dress is pictured to look like it has pockets, it does not.  Overall, my daughter was happy, just expect to make adjustments if you purchase"
3.0,My only issue was the filters you put inside always bend
3.0,"Fits great<br />Great materials<br />Looks good.<br /><br />Something got missed in the process here: soles began to fall off after second day.  Had to re-glue.  Boots are fine now, but got a surprise during work."
3.0,i am looking for more card slots
3.0,This item has already been returned and I need to be refunded. It was sent back with kids pink jacket
3.0,Well these look pretty nice when they arrive . Within two days the small earrings turned a different color . The larger earring have not changed color . Completely understand if this happen over a few months . Not the case in my purchase. Disappointing In case .
3.0,"The color ones seem to be less durable than the black ones?  This one confuses me, but they're unravelling at an alarming rate with only a few washes."
3.0,"I love this dress however once I tried it on a belt loop became unraveled. i'm debating returning or fixing it myself, i'm not much into sowing but I figure I can at least fix this on it -- it's comfortable. tshirt material."
3.0,"The bodysuit fit fine everywhere except for the very bottom. it looked enormous despite being the right width on my hips and everywhere else - it was just waaaaay too long in the crotch area. I drew a line in the photo to show how much of it I would need to chop off for me to be able to wear it.<br />For reference, I'm 5'4, 115 lb, and measure 32-27-34. I do have a relatively short torso, so maybe this would work for someone very tall or with a long torso."
3.0,"Ordered an XL for my wife in blue.  She usually wears XL in tops (5'7"", 170, 41"" bust, typical dress/pants size is 16). Her comments:<br /><br />Looks great on model, who is petite compared to me, but totally unflattering on me.  The color was as shown, but appeared dull/flat with no satin like sheen as in model pics.  The material seemed stiff and not flowy as it appeared in model photos.  Maybe after a washing it would soften up a bit, but this is just a no-go for me/my body shape."
3.0,The chain looks fine but the plastic ends continually slip off and even when tightened they loosen up and the glasses fall off.
3.0,"It's okay. The head is a little heavy. well, I know that watch was made in china and very different from swiss made watches."
3.0,So pretty<br />The backs went black and green after one wear
3.0,I bought the headpiece to go with a black and gold flapper dress.  It is the perfect accessory and matched well.  The headpiece is a bit fragile and had to be carefully placed and worn.  It lasted fine for a one time use but I am not sure how it would hold up with multiple uses.
3.0,"Very nice color, snug fit on top but cute!"
3.0,"I am not a busy woman and this shirt is very tight in the chest area. Besides that though, it is cute."
3.0,This is a hat that will fit an adult like a large beanie or a women loosely. It swallow my toddlers head who we actually got it for.
3.0,I was excited to find a top in my size with a built in shelf bra because due to breast cancer I can't wear most bras.  It fit ok but was a little tight however the material is so thin that you could see my belly button through it and other areas. It clung to me in a uncomfortable way.  It just wasn't going to be worn by me so I had to return it. I could see this shirt on a thin woman. But the larger women will feel its to clingy and thin. Alex and Abby have a good concept going on but need a little tweaking for the bigger sizes.  Maybe a little thicker cotton material.  good concept just didn't look good on me and was too thin.
3.0,The chain on back side was sharp & poking;(
3.0,"Very pretty ,made my ears hurt. Loved the back til I took the first one out and lost the back . Second one was easier. Upset"
3.0,Fit is good but everything with a shine or light looks light a holographic card
3.0,I love the shoes for simple play shoes but the problem I have is that I bought them a size bigger than my son wears and still they are just barely fitting him. They run very small. He will not be able to wear these shoes for more than a couple weeks.
3.0,"I have purchased and loved T Party yoga pants before, so I bought these expecting the same quality. However, these ones began coming apart at the seams on the inner thighs and crotch after a few washes. I had a similar pair that lasted me years so I'm not sure why these were different. I recommend that you go for the T Party High Density yoga pants. I've had those for a long time and they have held up phenomenally. I'm 5'8&#34; and have to cuff the legs. T Party yoga pants seem to be unusually long across the board,  but most yoga pants tend to be too short for me so I don't mind."
3.0,"The size is great.  We fit 4 beach towels, bottle of aloe, bottle of suntan lotion, 2 snorkel masks and a complete snorkel gear, 4 phones, passport, 1 pair of flip flops.  You can see through this so you can find an item, but the small zipper pouch at the top is not large enough for an iPhone XR, or any larger type cell phone.  It barely held my passport in it's little flip book.  We used it 3 times and after the first time the small zippered pouch tore away from the top of the bag.  It didn't tear off, just slipped down from top stitching.  Other than that it was a great huge bag.  We took on cruise to go to beaches when ported."
3.0,Definitely on the looser side.
3.0,"I was disappointed in how poorly constructed the dress was. The lining was much longer than the lace and looked pretty sloppy. It wasn't the most flattering either - a bit tight in the hips and stomach for me. The color was lovely though, and the sleeves were definitely cute."
3.0,Not sterling silver...brass under the silver coating so there is a yellow hue to it.  The CZ are beautiful.
3.0,These are cute glasses and I wanted to love them but definitely do not look good on me.  Well packaged and the look like they are well made.
3.0,The slipper is well made.  The fit was the problem. I wear a man's 9.5 and my heel was over he end of the slipper.  It was too short and also I could feel that the width was slightly too narrow.
3.0,Great fit only problem was Pom Pom came off Withings the first 2 days of wear.
3.0,"Fabric is very thin. Make sure you wear something underneath the garment.. The dress was also very low cut. this dress would be a good fit on a shorter woman  not  someone of 5'11"".constucted well but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"If I wear this, I will have to have some shorts underneath it. My butt is way to big and causes the shirt to rise in the rear."
3.0,"Really nice item, but it runs small.  Clingy.  If you are busty, beware!"
3.0,It looks absolutely nothing like the picture. It was a xmas present. Now I just took a picture and the picture looks much better than the actual hoodie. It looks like an old shirt so I'm gonna send this one back..
3.0,Loved the shirt but it's too short.  I planned on wearing it over a tank for work but cannot with how short it is
3.0,Cheap print. But it’s cute. Just wore it for a party so it worked
3.0,Very pretty but the beads fell off Soo easily. Its good for a one time use...after that too many beads are gone to wear again
3.0,Order one size up from what you think you need.
3.0,Looks like the picture and it's really sexy and elegant. However the fabric is cheap and not real chiffon. Size ok ( I usually wear size 4) and can probably fit people in various size. Ok for the price but not a really good deal.
3.0,Runs a little small compared to other 89th + Madison pants. Disappointed! They like to roll down when sitting so constantly having to pull them up. Great for standing! Lol
3.0,Looks slouchy barely fit head and my head is really small
3.0,The dress was to short for my age and to small for a size 2x .
3.0,"I want to love this band because it is really pretty, especially for dressing up, but it is ridiculously difficult to put the band on the Fitbit. The posts that hold it in place slide completely out of the band, and are really easy to lose. Luckily they include an extra set, but it makes it necessary to enclose the band and posts in some sort of case when carrying along for travel when you want to have both the fitness band and the dress up band. It is also difficult to singlehandedly clasp it on or off."
3.0,The color of top was too off contrast from the dress.  The bottom was cloth material and not what I expected.
3.0,Color was very different to what was in the picture.
3.0,"They were okay, just tore very easy after I had worn them twice. The front of the shoe would always kinda fold when I would walk. But they are soft"
3.0,I wore these bands for the first time today and my watch fell off twice because they’re not secure. I will probably still use them because they’re cute and comfortable but definitely not in situations that it can pop off easily.
3.0,"Love the pattern and fabric.  I wear a US 18/20 and ordered the 4X Plus. It is too tight in the chest (38DD) and the waist is too high. It was also a bit longer than I expected. I am 5'7&#34;, and it fell a few inches below the knee. The zipper is difficult.  Overall, I am disappointed, but didn't expect much for the price."
3.0,The dress is a gorgeous dress. But it was wayyy to short and too tight.
3.0,"Photos show shorts down near the knee on the model wearing them. In reality, they are way shorter."
3.0,"I received the classic brown version of this wallet.<br />It's nice leather, great looking design, but a little large for my back pockets. When sitting I can feel the top edge of the wallet protruding somewhat from my back pocket. When standing there is no real size problem.<br />The card slots are a bit tight, you have to work a little to get cards in and out (I can only speak for the first month of use) and there are only 6 card slots. Instead of a plastic covering for the ID slot, they used a brown mesh. Which while you can see through, still requires removal if you need to prove your age or identity for travel, alcohol or credit card use. Given the slightly larger size of the wallet, I would expect that making the card slots easier to use would be simple--just add 2mm to the width! The divider in the cash pocket is useful, you can separate receipts and cash, or different currencies if you travel.<br />It's great quality so far, but it is a bit too large for my American pockets and bank cards. Which is the whole purpose of wallets these days, really."
3.0,very large fitting for the size
3.0,"Nice fit, but other nylon shell absorbed moisture fast and thus the inside became cold and wet right away.  So disappointed as my grandkids want to be playing in the snow.<br />What’s with the bad grammar on the mittens? 😳"
3.0,Good.  The  Elastic broke in waistline. So just did bother to send them back . Other than that a nice  outfit..
3.0,Very nice material.  The size was a bit too large even though I  followed the size chart.
3.0,"Tag says XXL, but feels like a L."
3.0,Looks cheap.  Way bigger than I thought it would be.  One stone is crooked.
3.0,"Good looking watch, but tried half the day to get the time set. I followed the instructions, but the time would not set. I bought it for my mom who is blind, but decided to return it when I couldn't get it to work right."
3.0,I like the elastic waist jeans but they do require a number of washings before they get really comfortable. It is okay.
3.0,"Very thin material and the dress is a lot longer than the pic shows for a mini dress, it goes past my knees"
3.0,"The cowboy hat charm is cute and decent quality but the hoop part is super small, like it hugs the lobe, like it just closes. I don’t have large lobes either so just be careful."
3.0,Pretty dress very long had strings coming out of it and a few holes
3.0,It's overall a good keychain but it gets very stiff once you put it on... I'm not sure why. No other complaints though!
3.0,"Nice design. But quality to be better. Broken after 6 month. Anyway, it worth it"
3.0,Used for about 2 months and the string ripped.
3.0,A little big not as nice as I thought fabric a little thin
3.0,I'm very picky when it comes to costume jewelry. These earrings don't look as nice in person honestly. I only wear the gold set. The silver set has the paint peeling off of it.
3.0,"Tried to like it, but just too big and felt frumpy."
3.0,This dress was for my daughter! She didn’t like it but it looked amazing on my best friend. She’s 14 so she wasn’t feeling it.
3.0,"Not the same color grey. The pajamas I got were a much darker grey and the part that is polka dot is not a different color than the pajamas, it's basically the same dark grey. Not as short and cute as I thought they would be. They are soft and comfortable."
3.0,"Ordered size 32""W 31""L. Measured when they arrived and they are 34.5""W 42.5 L. Waaaaayyy too long lol! Probably just going to cut 10 inches off the legs and rock it. Love the material and design though!"
3.0,Glasses are very well made including a nice case. For day driving it has 400 UV protection but too yellow not pleasing to my eyes. Night driving I prefer my Blue/white 4000K HID lights on my car better. The improvement on visibility is about 1-2% not much noticeable. On coming head lights are bearable because it yellows it out. But still a little too bright a yellow for me. I believe if you are driving with regular halogen lights it would provide better improvement on visibility and shield against the on coming HID's.
3.0,Decent $7 sunglasses nothing more! The Glossy finish frames are weak  though
3.0,Cheap looking. Thicker chain than picture looks
3.0,"Love the bag itself, but I opened the package indoors and &#34;thought&#34; the bag was black based on the picture and description when I ordered. However, once I ripped the tags off and got it outside, it was clearly navy blue and not black as I had hoped. Was truly disappointed as at that point I could not return it."
3.0,"Being a bodycon dress, it's supposed to fit tighter. The way it stretched over my boobs and butt, made the design lighter and see through. It made the dress look really cheap, also it's not very tight on the legs like I had expected. Definitely returning."
3.0,Not as sturdy as I hoped
3.0,Band was too long.
3.0,"This jacket is nice for a windy day, but its not made for warmth. You have to wear lots as layering underneath, or make sure its sunny. But it was a good deal for the price."
3.0,The look and feel of product
3.0,The white bottom looked like the orange bled onto it. Wasn't really white.
3.0,"Just what I wanted except there are blemishes on it as well as a noticeable deep scratch. Debating on whether to keep or send back for an exchange. I do, however, like that the strap is also luminous. (Pix taken with flash.)<br /><br />Update: Decided to send it back & reorder. I'll update my review when I receive the replacement."
3.0,"I normally wear a glove in large (the last few I've bought have been golf gloves).  Based on reviews I went down to medium.  The index and thumbs are too long, the rest almost fit OK.  Would be 5/5 since the touchscreen seems to respond good.  Other reviewers also mentioned the thumb being too long. Owell, I'll keep them as backups."
3.0,"This product runs small, my daughter can’t wear them :("
3.0,So I love this necklace but I am disappointed that it is cracked in one section of the stones. Beyond that this is gorgeous and I highly recommend this.
3.0,"i typically wear a medium. ordered a Large, yet it was small. love the quality of the shirt but just smaller than expected."
3.0,"The idea of this scarf is great, but the Streach material used unfortunately isn’t strong enough to keep a good shape when something as heavy as a phone is put in it.  It pulls down in that area giving it an awkward appearance."
3.0,"This is slightly bigger than what I wanted to put the SmartThings GPS tracker on my dogs collar.  Using that thing for the dog has been sort of a challenge...  game on.  This would be just perfect IF IT WERE STILL WATER PROOF after a month.  Right from the get-go we had to put the tracker (in it's silicone water proof container) in a plastic wrap before putting it in the pouch.  Still gets wet...  it's the most frustrating thing.  But if you just want to put something on your belt loop and not roll around in the snow or water like my dog does... this will probably work just fine for you.<br /><br />If you know of something similar that actually IS water proof, feel free to beam me a reply. Thanks!"
3.0,"It’s flimsy,I was hoping it had more firmness"
3.0,Skin tight and you can see every detail and curve on my body when I wear this.  So I would not recommend this if you have rolls you want to hide.
3.0,"The band is attractive; but, after a few uses, the attachment mechanism for one side of the band is loose.  I am concerned that the band will eventually just slide off the face."
3.0,"I listened to the reviews, against my better judgment, and ordered my normal size small. It’s okay, but it would have been so much cuter if I had sized up like I normally do with cheap Amazon sweaters from China."
3.0,The dress was cute but the sizing runs small!
3.0,"Had purchased this same brand on Ralph Lauren's website before as Large, if I am not mistaken. This was easily 2 sizes larger. It's marked &#34;L&#34; but feels like an XL. Fabric quality was good, otherwise."
3.0,"So, so fabric."
3.0,These boots were probably better known as slippers and not recommended for outdoor wear
3.0,Like the watch but really hate the band
3.0,Fit was too large and socks weren't included
3.0,"Pants are perfect, but the blazer and vest are slightly too tight"
3.0,I like the jacket but wish it wasn’t sprayed with some chemical.  I’m a health nut and don’t like my clothes sprayed with toxins that may or may not come out when washed.
3.0,They ar made well just much lighter in color than I expected.
3.0,I should’ve ordered the next size up the very tight
3.0,Headband area needs to be tucked under or it would be too long and slide into eyes<br />Also had to move buttons and sew  in different  location for mason loop use.<br />Fabric quality and seams are decent and washes well without much shrinkage
3.0,"These petti pants are not sized for plus sized women.  The plus sizes run very small.  the satin is hot and clingy and not something I would choose to wear under anything, during the summer."
3.0,The wallet is a lot thicker than pictured even with no cards or cash in it. Very bulky
3.0,"Thought color was more of a brass gold. it is more antuiqed.  Like the style, different than anything else I own. Will keep."
3.0,"It's a very nice piece that was easy to attach. I wear my bracel often and after a few years the lettering is starting to fade. Otherwise, great product."
3.0,"Very nice and a good size. Disappointed that four were duplicates, so I ordered twelve but only received eight different pins. I do like them, however and the price is great!"
3.0,Super cute but just too small.
3.0,doesn't look too good after washing it.
3.0,Product was ok but has several creases and made it hard to display to look attractive to my customers
3.0,"I would buy for a costume, not really for actual use as legitimate suspenders."
3.0,"Dress is true to sz and looks great. Material on the body of the dress  doesn’t wash well and has lots of piling after a few washes. Company contacted me, great customer service."
3.0,Did not Fitbit Inspire 2 like advertised.
3.0,It’s definitely very narrow and tight. Not what I expected. But the slippers self is very nice
3.0,"Arrived with a dead battery, but I bought one for $3.95 and the watch has been running well since then. Looks nice and if it lasts two years, I'll be happy."
3.0,"At just over 3 cm in length this pendant is delicate and exactly what I was looking for, the diamonds are brilliant.  The chain however, is dull and brassy looking, I was't planning on using it with the pendant but the plating quality could have been much better."
3.0,Nice for the price. Took a long time to arrive
3.0,I had to return the first one
3.0,"The eye stone is not yellow,its white,clear if you will.definitely not as advertised, that was disappointing. other than that I'm happy"
3.0,This is a really cute out fit but the button was too big and the top too small.  I wore it and got lots of compliments
3.0,Good fit. Quality is poor. Thin and good to wear in the office but wouldn’t be able to wear it in the fall unless wear a fleece under. Due to the quality unsure how long it will last but good for the price point.
3.0,"The belt is a nice belt but it is narrower than I wanted.  Otherwise, it seems like a nice product."
3.0,"It was okay when I got it! But looking at it, the product looks cheap!"
3.0,It not the right material was
3.0,Great fake glasses for a kid about 10 and under. Will not fit an adult head.
3.0,Great Jersey but the fit is way off xl fit like a large so order a size up!
3.0,"I got this for free.  It was to tiny, the elephants and the chain"
3.0,"Shirt feels 2 sizes smaller than American sizes, I got XXL but it feels Large in fit and length.  Stretchy fabric with no tags, vibrant colors but resolution a bit poor"
3.0,I liked the fit and feel. I was about to wear them for the day and noticed I could see my leg skin. I called my daughter in and she said she could totally see my underwear and bottom. Nope.
3.0,My husband is a 3x and the Larges size they have didn't fit him we have to add material to it now for the wedding and widen the arm holes!
3.0,The jersey is beautiful but too long. I am a petite person..in the upper side of the shirt it fits alright...but from the shoulders to the hip it is too long. A tailor is working on it to fix it
3.0,The price I thought was very reasonable. It does feel rather cheaply made. It does do the trick though. My back and neck get nice and warm and the three temp settings are a plus. The collar is heated but I think I would be happier it it wasn’t so high.
3.0,"So I gave it 3 stars because non of these pairs were consistent at all. I'll explain:<br />*Capris Dk. Gray - Thin buttery soft material, not sweat proof at all and zero tummy control. Main plus is how soft they are - I wont ever wear these on leg day, sweat shows everywhere and zero support.<br />*Capris Graymarble - Design is cute, they run very small - they feel like they are a polyester/cotton material (way different from the other two material I bought). They feel like they have more tummy control but that might just be because they run smaller.  The material does not breathe well at all.<br />*Marble - These are my favorite. The breathe well, Squat proof, sweat doesn't show, mild compression, nice material. The are a little long for me (I'm 5' 8"") but I like the length to his right about the ankle.<br />I am 5'8"" about 148ish bigger bottom half - I train 5-6 days a week and get a lot of use out of my gym clothes, this is why I was a little bummed about these."
3.0,"It was my mistake that this bag wouldn't contain my daytimer, so I adjusted for how I was keeping things and it worked fine.  Then I noticed that the strap on the side that doesn't adjust started to tear which then proceeded to get worse over time.  I walk all over the city a lot so I needed something that was small enough to carry my essentials with a strap that I can sling over my body without constantly hanging onto a handle or strap.  Other than the problem with the strap I'm happy with the bag - guess it's time to find something slightly bigger that may be better made."
3.0,"Actually I'm about 174cm  so I choose the L-size. However it's still too short for my arms and legs.It is made of cotton,and warm  enough for me....But still toooo short.:/"
3.0,its cuter in the pic . fit as expected its china they do run smal.l overall happy!
3.0,"This sports bra is very cute, but it is slightly too big for me, and the padding is messed up and I cannot find a way to fix it. Otherwise very comfy and cute!"
3.0,"Too small. Bought my size, but it was a little too tight in the waist which causes the pockets to stick out. Looked stupid. Returned."
3.0,The items are beautiful but the sizes are way off. Way larger than expected.
3.0,"Loved the print and color of this shirt, just wish it was less box shaped and a little softer would be nice. Overall nice shirt though"
3.0,"The material is very comfortable, and the shirt fits well. However, the elastic on the shorts is pretty uncomfortable. It would be a lot more comfortable if it was not so thin, but it digs into my hips."
3.0,"There are more economical bags out there. Usually am happy with Pioneer Woman quality, should cost about half what it does."
3.0,"I love the print and the metal chain on the straps, But the fit is not great. I ordered medium. The bottoms are slightly too big and the top is toooo small. My nipples want to peek out and my underboob is…well there is a lot of underboob. It is a wired top and the wire is so rigid and goes across the whole top. It does not separate in the middle of the bust. I wish I could keep this suit but not in this lifetime."
3.0,It never even got worn. I washed it as I do all clothes before wearing. The surfboard decorations cracked and it looks years old instead of brand new. Yes washed on delicate and air dried.
3.0,Size is a little bigger than it says.
3.0,"Very difficult to put on using wire frame sock donner.<br />I have large calf.  sock actually ripped when pulling up.<br />Once on, did the job.  comfortable to wear all day.<br />good compression.."
3.0,"Th earrings were a bit crooked, had to bend them to shape myself. Overall alright but I probably wouldn't buy them again 🤷🏼‍♀️"
3.0,"Material is nice, but thin (not see through, but close). I should have paid closer attention to the length. I guess I was expecting yoga pants length and received pants I could remove 8 inches off of and still worn heels with. They also fit odd at the top, giving me the dreaded cameltoe. I gave them to my sister who is a similar shape but 5'10"". She loves them."
3.0,"Shiny material, comfy but not what I expected or like the pick. Also should size down if ordering"
3.0,To small poor quality
3.0,"I loved this shoe in the past, but I just purchased a new pair and the stitching is coming undone on the ornamental area near the toe."
3.0,Runs large for my 4 year old but it kept her warm. It didn't hold it's shape well throughout the day though. It also started pilling after second wash.
3.0,Fit well but too thin. Great if you’re wearing in place of sweater. Only good as outerwear in warmer weather
3.0,"I am happy with the necklace, I've worn it once and it was fine for my outfit. The reason for my 3star rating is because it feels too cheap in my hands for the price paid."
3.0,Perfect dress but the white is see through!!
3.0,"The material is great but it runs too big, as you can see in the pic the are both small and you can notice the difference. The top size is fine."
3.0,"First these are not fleece lined. They're thin regular workout leggings. I’m 5’1 and most things are long on me but these are about 6” too long so I fold the bottom. Also I’m an xl across the board but these are very tight especially in the waist. So I would definitely recommend going up a size, I wish I had"
3.0,doesn't quite look as nice on - as the photo.  a bit flimsy.  i'll pass it on to someone who will like it more.........
3.0,"these emerald earrings are a good size however, the color is much darker then I hoped.  There's almost no shine or clarity to them."
3.0,"My granddaughter was really looking forward to these, but they were much to big on her and she is eight.  They are pretty though."
3.0,No me gustó el material de la tela. No es como se ve en la imagen
3.0,"Gray Crystal is Larvikite, it is not Gray Labradorite."
3.0,"Although they look super cute and just like the picture, they're very thin and flimsy and the color of the tint is a little too dark for my taste."
3.0,Disappointing but not worth the effort to return.
3.0,"This dress looks nice with leggings. Unfortunately, within hours of wearing it for the first time, I noticed it already had a hole/snag right in the center I'd the chest. C'est la Vie."
3.0,"Nice key chain. I needed a key chain that I could hook on my belt loop and put the keys in my pocket.  I lost a couple of keys that I had in my pocket when I pulled something out and I hadn't realized I lost it (a car key).  As you could imagine, it was pretty expensive replacing that vehicle key.  It's just a little small for more than 10 keys"
3.0,"I love the design and though it's a good price my expectations because of the price wasn't high. However, I would at least expect scarab to at least be centered and glued on pretty crooked so for this reason only I give it 3 stars"
3.0,Fit shorter & a bit boxier than expected but worked for the occasion. Definitely shrinks a couple sizes after washing and drying.
3.0,"love the mask, wish they would make it better quality though, super scary"
3.0,"button fell off already, and i only wore it once. the fit is just fine, however. took a loooong time to get here. i probably wouldn't order it again."
3.0,Like the shirt but a little smaller than I expected
3.0,It ok kinda cheep material it balls up and just not a top quality shirt. But its ok I don't wear it much I was hopping for sift comfortable material won't buy a notherone.
3.0,"The lenses are a little smaller that I had wanted, but they will do as a spare."
3.0,When I wore this my friends said that I looked rich that was my intention so yeah
3.0,The wig was way to small . but every thing else was great
3.0,"It arrived 3 days after the event I needed it for. Sparkly and doesn't look like cheap costume jewelry, it is not quite as big as I thought it should be. All the dangly-things hang to the front, not wide enough to wrap like it shows. Some of the brackets were curved from shipping and I had to straighten them out for it to lay flat and I feared they would break."
3.0,The dress fit well enough for a $40 dress but the green was not as pictured. I was hoping it was the bluish-green in the photo but it was more of a forest green. If the color was what I was looking for I probably would have kept it.
3.0,The glasses are small.
3.0,"I love the quality of the material, true to its color and size. However I didn't quite like the design, too wide yet short."
3.0,The casting is a bit rough in spots but it's really nice for the price.
3.0,The boots should be printed on the legs just like the others. The classic rogue boots are missing
3.0,"It is super cute, I love the look. It is ever so slightly snug. Maybe if I had thinner arms it would be better. Over all the product is good !"
3.0,"The material is not comfy.  Also, it’s not free shipping and free return.  They charged $6 as the return fee."
3.0,"Size didn't work for me, but the bag is gorgeous"
3.0,"Quality of the band is fine and fits my Fitbit HR well.  Only issue I have is that I ordered the band in a color called ""slate"" which appeared to be a darker shade of gray, but turned out to have a definite Teal cast to it.  The original band that came with my Fitbit was gray so I was looking for something closer to that for the replacement."
3.0,It works for what I intended.
3.0,Cute but ordered one phrase and received another. The phrase I wanted would have been better
3.0,The shirt is nice don’t get me wrong but it wasn’t what I was expecting. The sizing seemed to be slightly off. It fit but just need a little more room. Otherwise it was okay. I did go up a size but it still wasn’t the right fit.
3.0,"I ordered an xlarge and sent it back, ordered a xxl and the fit was the same. This is very tight!"
3.0,"The reason for my rating is because I feel that this necklace simply was not worth the $51 that was paid for it!!! I'm sure these cost nothing to mass produce, it is TINY!!!! the chain is so thin that I'm sure it will be broken in no time but it was a gift for my wife and she loved it. That's the reason I gave it at least 3 stars. If it were about my opinion at all it would be 1 star simply because of the price point and how tiny/flemsy it is!"
3.0,they're nice from a distance but when you inspect them they look kinda cheap
3.0,"I personally found it very uncomfortable and frustrating to get on and off. The knob style clasp its sometimes unreliable, and the material itself can be uncomfortable after it gets wet. If it had a normal watch hook i think it would be better."
3.0,I loved it but it just stopped working. I tried to change the battery and still it just won't work :(
3.0,"Cute as can be but would fit a teen or up to a women shoe size 7. Would never, ever fit a man!! Disappointed as they were purchased for a man."
3.0,Decent slippers.
3.0,"Pretty dress and seemed to be well made, but it just wasn't a good style for me."
3.0,"These are really, really small. I was disappointed because I have a lot of clothing I could have worn these. If you like very dainty earrings then these would be right for you. My hair is extremely short and I needed something to bring out the hairstyles and I thought these would have done it for me but they didn't."
3.0,Just wished they had almost fired
3.0,"The top is cute, bottoms are way too small! They fit really weird. Otherwise good bathing suit."
3.0,"I received the jersey and shorts more quickly than expected. Not top quality but nice for what the price. There were no socks included in the parcel even though the title of the product clearly states “jersey, shorts & socks”."
3.0,gave to my granddaughter as it was too small for me
3.0,Returned. The artificial leather was too stiff for me.
3.0,"Sent it back because it doesn't fit like most of these flowy tops do. I always order one size up from what I wear because I don't like anything form fitting.  If you have had children, this is NOT the shirt for you. NOT flowy at all. Tight fitting.. Disappointed."
3.0,Easily came off the ring when you have keys in your pocket.
3.0,More like Capri pants as they don’t go to the ankles
3.0,Not comparable to many other shirts in the same size
3.0,"These worked out alright for what I needed...after a considerable amount of alteration. The legs ended up being a bit too wide, though better than too narrow. The biggest issue was that even though I had ordered the smallest size, these shorts were still about 6”-8” too wide in the waist! I believe this contributed to the legs being too wide as well. I ended up removing the elastic from the back waistband and just stitching the sides up in a line which worked out.<br /><br />The material is a nice linen, and is washable with proper care. If you’re small, these will be too big. If you’re average or larger, I imagine these will do just fine for you."
3.0,"WAY too small, not intended for large calves"
3.0,"just fine, and make u sweat more."
3.0,Just got these in the mail and they are huge. I'm the write up for them they claim they are 7.9in long but they're closer to 8.5in. I think I can make it work by adjusting the straps but they're still really big on my face. My husband says it's just cause I have a small face lol<br /><br />EDIT:: I tried my best to make it work but they're just too big for my face. They fit my husband better but he's a Duke fan. My son wants them so that's where they go. I'm just disappointed that I can't wear them.
3.0,"It covers my face well and the fabric was lightweight and breathable so the top of my head didn't get hot. The chin band came in handy when the wind picked up and I liked not having to worry about my hat flying off. It arrived very wrinkled but I was able to steam most of it out. My head easily fits within the required measurements but the band is pretty tight and left a slight indentation when I took the hat off later. After wearing it for 4 days straight, the spot on my forehead where the band rested developed a rough patch of skin from the friction. It took several days and a couple of exfoliations to get my skin back to normal. I bought it in two colors before trying it on but it's so inexpensive, it's easier to just keep both. I'll probably give them to my son and look for something more true to size. It's a shame though because I like the hat itself. If you have a smaller head, it could work for you."
3.0,Sizes inaccurate hand made. I bought 4 trying to get the color I wanted to fit my boob. Only one did but it was a different color. But if you have small boobs they will fit beautifully. They are stunning tbh.
3.0,Loved the look but it was a little too clingy for me.
3.0,The snaps on bottom are spaced too far apart so that creates a big gap. Cap is way to small on baby.
3.0,"It was cuter cute, my son loved it. HOWEVER, I did not like the eyes.<br />They were too small and weirdly shaped."
3.0,"The metal is not extremely strong, so they bend pretty easily. Also they didn't come with backs, which I thought was kind of strange. But overall they look pretty similar to the photo"
3.0,"If you're on the shorter side, expect the super stretchy leggings to go really high up. The picture descriptions for this product were very accurate."
3.0,These shrunk when I washed and dried them.  So bummed because they are really cute & comfy.  I am hoping my daughter will wear them because I am afraid they will be too tight on me now.
3.0,Barely Fits a man thats 44 Plus. Something that should have been in the description.<br />Good design. Still usable just have it at one Click and need help removing it.
3.0,Fit as expected but was completely see through.
3.0,"While the belt functions and looks fine, the leather did have a low quality leather smell."
3.0,"I am 35 years old and believe that my contact wearing days may be behind me since I can't seem to get the prescription crisp and clear. I am sensitive to the sun when driving and thought these might help. I ordered them because I thought they were less bulky than the ones that you see &#34;the older generation&#34; wear. When I got them, I put them on and was instantly aged to well over 50+. I ended up giving them to my dad....who is 70 and loves them!"
3.0,Very hard to set or change time and date. Watch looks good.
3.0,I ordered a size medium. I am 5’2 146 pound.<br /> ( currently overweight but don’t judge me lol) . This dress is very long. Drags on the floor. I’m not planning on wearing heels or any tall shoes with this dress so I am going to hem it about 3 inches off. I ordered blue and white strips. This dress is more of white. It is semi see through and yes you can see your panties and nipples. I have 34DD breasts. This dress is not made for larger breasts. I squeezed my breasts in these. No supports for larger breasts. I guess I can wear a bikini top to cover nipples. The butt area has  bunching/gatherings . It makes your butt looks shapely which I like. The material is made of polyester which is a horrible fabric. It reminds me of Halloween costume material. This type of fabric traps HEAT!!!! It is very hot wearing this dress. I feel like my skin can’t breathe. I wish it was a cotton material or some sort because it is very cute otherwise. I will not order again because of the fabric. I live in hot dry climate and also going on vacation in humid weather. If you want something flowing and airy this is not it.
3.0,"This is not good for shaping; won't hold too much in, but it's great to wear underneath a faja."
3.0,"Eh, I mean, I bought these because they were cheaper than the actual ones people buy. I can't say they're anything special to be honest. Soft, but nothing to write home about"
3.0,I dislike the material of top but I like the style.
3.0,"This dress is awful.  The bust is not designed well. The bottom of the dress is made with some silky cheep thin fabric that does not drape well at all. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this lol. Since I'm not good at returns, off to the goodwill with this ugly contraption."
3.0,I love these little guys only I've notice that they are turning a bronze color on the side that touches my skin and I've only noticed this color change in jewelry that is not pure sterling silver. I haven't broken out I just was not expecting them to fade.
3.0,"Im 34C. I ordered a small. (Sizing chart recommended). The top was to small. The bottoms fit. The color was pretty. The bottom piece ties on the side & the threading was already seperated. I gave it to my daughther. We're leaving for the beach. She will probably get to wear it on vacation, then it'll be trashed. I doubt the bottoms will hold up for any washing. Again beautiful colors. Cute design. But cheaply made."
3.0,"Material feels nice, but it runs a little small and when I went to pull them up both belt loops came right off."
3.0,Fit and colors/design great but I hate that it feels like a tech shirt.
3.0,The sizing chart for this item is really off!  Seems like it is a nice shirt.  Had to return for a larger size. Stay tuned.
3.0,The only dislike for me was the color..... I ordered what I thought was a burnt orange and I got a bright summer orange.
3.0,Mechanism breaks after shot use
3.0,Their tags are on the outside. So funny and slightly disappointed that it is almost see through thin.
3.0,"I purchased these to use for my ride my  to work. I work in the early mornings before the sun comes up and was looking for something that would keep my hands from freezing up. I ride about 25 mils in no less then 40 degrees and these gloves do not do the job. 15 min in to my ride my fingers starts to get numb and cold, by the time I arrive to work they are frozen. Now I did use them for the snow and they were perfect hands stayed dried and warm. Yes i do understand they are not meant for ridding but thought I give them a try as it is very difficult to find something that will do the job. So the review is more for what the intent to use them for then the actual product."
3.0,"The product description says it is for a 40-44 mm but it is to large for the 40mm. The clasp is magnetic, which is a bit to strong. It rolls up together, like a cinnamon roll, since it is a metal. It is secure but I was concerned that it may demagnetize my 💳 cards. Just a thought. It looks so nice but I had to return due to fit."
3.0,We bought them for skiing.  The wires run through the socks and are not comfortable in ski boots.  Didn’t use them after first day
3.0,really small for xl made in Egypt
3.0,"The dress was okay, it was very very wrinkly upon arrival. I didn't find the fabric to be very flattering. I think it ran true to size. I ended up returning it."
3.0,"This lapel pin is really cute, but not well made. The pin part broke off of the shield, so it's not usable after only a few times of being worn."
3.0,"Not bad, just not great. The sleeves are a little tight, the fabric is polyester, with a slick, not soft feel."
3.0,"I wear size 8 in almost all Dolfin brand polyester suits, but this one is way too small across the bust.  The bottom fit fine, but not the top.  I had to return it."
3.0,I wear a 9 and I ordered a 10 . Order what size you wear. These look like something you would buy at wal-mart they are cheap lookind and will wear camping. Not a dressy sandal.
3.0,I bought this in XL and it felt like it was medium.
3.0,The outfit was cute but the bow was way too small.  We had to throw the bow again and pair it with something else.
3.0,Loved this dress. Hugged in the right places. I wear a 14 and ordered a large.
3.0,"It's comfy cute. Not a nice cute. it's just wearing a tshirt with your shoulders cute out. Not flattering, Not something you'd wear out."
3.0,Really liked it the only negative thing about it is that it’s kind of see through
3.0,"Picture doesn't really give you any idea of how flimsy and cheap the fabric is. Be advised . . . It LOOKS cheap, even from afar. But fit really is very flattering even though it runs large."
3.0,beautiful dress fit my body a bit awkwardly wasn't so flattering so returned
3.0,The little dangle fell off within a week :&#60;
3.0,I am almost 6 feet tall so the pants ran way too short for me even after trying to have the hem taken out and tailoring them. I ended up giving them away.
3.0,"If you want the look of the picture, order a size or 2 up.."
3.0,"Love this get compliments however the eyes were busted out as if poked out, and the cord for the lights broke not long after."
3.0,"This is a well made sweater but it’s too heavy for me. Also I went by the size chart and it was too small. I sent it back and ordered a size bigger, but it wasn’t much bigger then the large I ordered before. Unfortunately I’m out of options and now I can’t return it because I’m past the 30 days 😩😩 I have several other sweaters from Patty Botique that I love. This one just wasn’t for me. I recommend sizing up if your going to buy one. I’m 5ft 6 and a 180 pounds."
3.0,very small bag not as big as the image they would have you believe.
3.0,"I think the dress is very good. I like the texture, color and how it flows on my body. However, it is a bit loose which makes it somewhat uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,"The sizes for this run really big! I am a d cup and the small is still too big but, its cute if you don't plan on doing to much movement lol"
3.0,Do far they're doing a good job of keeping my shirts tucked in correctly.  The fabric that their made of isn't quite as pleasant as advertised.  Im going to try washing them with fabric softener a few times to see if it gets better.
3.0,Did not fit so not true to US sizes
3.0,I loved the colors of the dress and even the fit. The dress went to the top of ankles. But I’m sad as the dress arrived I had holes in both pockets and some of the seem was coming out from the side of the dress.
3.0,Was a bit too small. But it matched the picture so it was ok.
3.0,"Very cute, but I had to give it away, was smaller than expected."
3.0,cute but buttons fell off really quick. would not get unless you are planning to reinforce buttons before you wear them. I only wore them a handful of times before both buttons had fallen off. im not doing anything rough in them either.
3.0,I like the material and all but I ordered the size based on the sizing information provided but it was way too large. That's saying quite a lot because I'm a DD and it was too big even in the chest. Based on the information on the sizing chart provided I was actually worried that the shirt might be too tight/small in the chest area and yet it turned out to be too large.
3.0,I really like the bracelet I ordered 3.  was really disappointed that no type of card came with the bracelet to explain what is on the bracelets and the meaning behind all the different beads.  Now I had to come back on my amazon page and try to make my own up to give to the persons im giving them to so they know what is what .<br />  do you have cards  ? if so can you email 3 to me??? SunAndFun1965@hotmail.  I think the card would add more fun to the whole bracelet.  Thank you Brenda M
3.0,"I like the style of these definitely on the right track material is a bit on the cheaper side, definitely would recommend the manufacturer  to put a flex hinge on these I've go alot of compliments on them would recommend them and  for the price you can't beat them."
3.0,"Appeared to be more fitted in the photo, but the fit was more boxy."
3.0,I love the top and concept....but turtle neck is way tooo big. Had to send back
3.0,"Fit was a little big. I'm 5'10, 175 and probably should have bought the medium. However, the disappointing part was the appearance of the hood. The fur was no where near as nice as the picture. Made it look more like a giant teddy bear. Had to spend time combing it down and trying to get it all to go in the right direction. For the price, it was a little underwhelming. Felt more like a $20 costume than a $45 one."
3.0,"these slippers were a hit.<br />They don't have any soles or arch supports, I don't think they will last very long but for a child who will grow out of them pretty quickly they'll be fun for a winter."
3.0,"These don't come up to my knee as pictured, try come up low calf. Nice, but not what I was expecting."
3.0,"Very cute, but somewhat cheaply made. The strap doesn’t give any room to be adjusted tighter so shoes do not stay on skinny feet very well."
3.0,These rip incredibly easily. I've got threads coming off after a single wash. They also get scratched by velcro.
3.0,"The size was good ,straps adjustable, fit fine but spouse found them. extremely uncomfortable, even painful to walk in. Not sure what the.problem.is . The soil is rigid ,no flex and somehow just did not work with his foot. Might be fine for someone else though he has not had these issues with other sandals or shoes."
3.0,I love the potential this shirt has. My only complaint is it isn't long enough in the waist.
3.0,"helpful that it folds into it's front pocket for easy storage.  Be sure it is completely dry before folding up.  The pocket is a great size for your phone, wallet, etc.  The reflective trim is an excellent feature.  The length is great and was nice and long when seating with my shorts and Wellies.  The only down side of this poncho is that the hood is too short and the rain runs off into your face.  If they could fix this design, I'd buy them as gifts for everyone I know."
3.0,"Product quality wasn't as pictured. It seemed the detail edges of the product were poorly done. Yet, they are not terrible. You get what you pay for."
3.0,The shoe had a lot of pluses but one deal breaker for me. The shoe looks in person the way it does in the picture. They are truly a lightweight shoe. They fit my daughter true to size and easy to slip on.  Despite the pluses I returned the shoes because of the sole. It's made from a molded plastic that I felt just wouldn't hold up for a very active kid.
3.0,"Love this beautiful, light & airy dress - true navy color, fresh & modern style.  Front length hits at my knee (I'm 5' 4.5"").  It is a little tight across the shoulders - it fits but getting it off was a comedy!  I ordered the XL and I usually wear a size 14.  I'm keeping it though - it's too cute and I'm already working on losing 20 lbs."
3.0,battery does not work
3.0,I have only worn them once. Very comfortable and pretty! Just hope they are durable!
3.0,The material on the whole dress is spandex material. i thought it would have faux leather but no... its ok.
3.0,not Morc's suspenders
3.0,I have owned two of these in the past. Bothe were good quality. The only thing is I ordered the same size (large) and it is smaller than before.
3.0,This top runs small. The fabric was very thin and cheaply made
3.0,the leather is cheap looking.
3.0,I wasn't impress with this bracelet.
3.0,This shirt is very cute but an XL fits more like a Medium .
3.0,Pants too long
3.0,Product isn’t true to size. It fits fine when you first get it. A bit snug and then after first wash it gets smaller. The print doesn’t do well under heat so DO MOT PUT IN DRYER! Hang dry only. Colors also faded pretty fast from the print. Sofia’s wave was pretty washed out after a few washing cycles. It literally looked like she had no pigmentation at all in her skin.
3.0,Doesn't seem to be as dense and cushiony as the ones you buy at the ikea store.
3.0,"Delicate and soft, as advertised, but they shrank a full inch in each direction. Washed in lukewarm water and dried on permapress setting. 11x11 inches was already on the small side, now they're about the same dimensions as a standard Kleenex. I'll keep them, but wouldn't buy them again."
3.0,"I wouldn’t call these yoga pants because they’re cotton, and not stretchy, but they’re ok for lounging around."
3.0,Method of shipping sucks. The jacket is not leather as stated. Hats kind of cheezy
3.0,Nice. But wish the beeds were red
3.0,"The price is great, however the washing instructions aren't kidding. Extra care with these is expected otherwise you may find there is pillage."
3.0,"Pattern is great and I usually like this brand. However, I ordered two and this one is significantly larger. Meaning.... it slips off. For $15, would think better quality control."
3.0,"These are super cute sunnies. Mine arrived quickly and packaged well. However they are not very dark, so the sun is still very bright in my eyes. Good for those slightly overcast days."
3.0,"The material is not ad thick as I thought.  Not quite in love with it.  I'll just wear it casually. Wanted a little black skirt I could dress up, but this isn't it.  May have to break down and go to an actual brick and mortar.  Lol."
3.0,Doesnt block the sun as well as I would have liked and scratched easily overall... but like... it was $10 so i can't really complain.
3.0,"Pretty, nut way to large for a key chain. I will repurpose elsewhere."
3.0,"The sewn part in the middle was sewn too far down for my liking. However, I love the feel and look of it."
3.0,I have to admit the quality was not the best it wasn't the soft kinda felt a little cheap the colors on it look fine to fit me well very good looking shirt
3.0,"Glasses are o.k.  Good quality.  They do help with glare at night, but I don't notice much difference in making things brighter."
3.0,Definitely measure your hips before buying. I can usually rock a XL and got may more shorts this style in XL from Amazon and was just fine. But they wouldn't even go past my thighs. So make sure you know your hips measurements before ordering. Matieral was nice just couldn't wear.
3.0,it's quite small and tight. looks like a kids beanie however it's still wearable but i like loose beanies
3.0,I would've expected these to be a little longer for the listed sizes. Otherwise they are cute and decently made!
3.0,It is pretty thin. Its great for a costume look or for Cosplay but dont expect it to last more than a few times unless you are VERY careful with it. But it is inexpensive and looks terrific!
3.0,"Sizes are completely wrong. The medium was huge, other reviews complained about the size medium being small. There is obviously something wrong with the perception of SIZE from this seller side.<br />The quality is not very good."
3.0,It looks like it should hold up well but I can already see the hole I use wearing out. Also the holes are further back then your standard belts.
3.0,"I was surprised that this mask came in a flat bag.  From the description I was expecting an extruded PVC hard mask.  I thought you simply had a choice of color not realizing it wasn’t a choice in color alone, but also a choice of material instead of a latex mask.  However My grandson has enjoyed it but wants to get a hard mask.  The company was wonderful and refunded my money ."
3.0,The light up shoes we saved until our son could fit into them. Only one shoe works the other won’t light up. We left on charge for up to 2 hours and nothing. So now we paid for a pair of light up shoes with only one that works
3.0,Some what small I wanted them a little more Baggie
3.0,So it looks just like the pics. It’s cute. It’s just thin. It’s not even swim material lol. It’s not lined... like you can’t swim in this.. just for looks.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:551aec02c069a76212655c8bb21276fb]] The price of this dress was so good I could not pass it up, however, please expect to receive what you pay for in price. The material is very cheap. It is comparable to the material used to make Halloween costumes. It is very cute but I  don't think it would last one wash."
3.0,"Somewhat to small, but i love it"
3.0,They were cute and looked comfortable just to small
3.0,"The elastic broke on the first day of use with two out of the three that came in the package. I still used them and they did the trick, but I wished I could tighten them."
3.0,I loved these pajamas but had to return them. Too bad that a recent surgery left me unable to fit into them nicely.<br />I was so impressed with the care taken in the design and attention to detail. I would recommend these to someone else.<br />Very soft to the touch and pretty. Nice.
3.0,They fit fine but I thought the toe would be narrower.
3.0,"I ordered these and they are nice looking Boots, But are too big for a size 9 they seemed like they were a 9 1/2 or 10.I Sent them back which was easy.  I did not try them on ice or snow or to  to see if they were warm. I did not order a smaller size ."
3.0,"I got these in teal and they look pretty cool. The construction is nice; the frame is sturdy and sits level. I know that the frames are oversized, but they look just a little bit *too* big on my face. Otherwise they are great and you can't beat the price. They even came in a nice little pouch.<br /><br />UPDATE: I loved these sunglasses, but within 2 weeks of wearing them, the screws that held the lenses to the frame started coming loose, even though I was really careful with the frame (kept it in a case, didn't smush or drop the glasses, etc.) Unfortunately a screw fell out in my car and I can't find it, so I can't wear the glasses any more. Super sad they didn't last longer than a month."
3.0,"It does cut your leg off a little so if you have thicker ankles, I do, and don't want that accentuated then I would steer away from them. The toe is also boxy. It looks almost like a rounded toe in the pictures but it is really boxy so that is something to look out for."
3.0,"Looser than expected, material is very thin. Made it comfortable for summer wear. Wasnt very flattering though."
3.0,"J Tomson women's double layered jersey tank top.  This top is made with rayon.  It is double layered and comfortable.  It is recommended that this top be hand washed in cold water and hung to dry.  This top arrived on time and was packaged in a bag.  I ordered the xxxl due to knowing sizes online are always crazy.  It's easy to fix something that is too big but if something is too small then it's an issue.  I ordered the top in the color jade.  It looked very teal blue online but in person it's a bit more green.  I'm glad I ordered such a large size.  I'll have to alter it a little bit but it definitely runs pretty small.  This shirt is a comfortable shirt to wear at home but I think it's thin and too short to wear out.  It's short on me.  I'm not a tall person or short but this does not hit where I feel it should.  The material is a bit flimsy feeling.  I doubt this tank top will last a long time.  It's just too thin and will wear out with use.  Overall I like this tank top for lounging at home and such but not for use out.  Plus, I had to alter it to make it fit me well.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount.  The only requirement was that I give an honest review.  There is no reward for a positive review and no punishment for a negative review.  This was my honest opinion of the product.  I only accept a free or discounted product if I or my family will use the item and want the item.  I know that I rely on other reviews prior to purchasing an item and I hope that you found this review helpful."
3.0,"Pro: The sweater was true to size and I like the fact that I can wear it off my shoulders.<br /><br />Cons: thin material, you can see through it, no tag to determine front or back, and one sleeve is stretched."
3.0,Was super excited about this purchase . I ordered this one and a Gemini one. The Gemini one is great but the Sagittarius one the pearl falls right out :(
3.0,"These fit snuggly and firmly, but I prefer the Thorlo cushioned socks for the extra padding, although these fit more snuggly."
3.0,"Thick fabric, but run large. The print on the lower leg also cracked after one wear and they were big on me"
3.0,The bust area is too loose. I’m a C cup and it’s too big. Cute too and I kept it. I’m hoping it shrank after washing.
3.0,"The blouse was cute. The material was thinner than expected, I didn’t feel that it would last very long.<br /><br />They were great about the money return."
3.0,"There is no doubt, it's beautiful.  I like the white stitching with the brown color of the leather.  I use this band on a Timberland watch I've had for 20 years.  I've had many bands over the years and usually don't spend more than $15 on them.  This is nicer looking but I don't know if it's $30 nicer.  It's shorter than the other bands I've bought.  I have to use the second hole in the band and that leaves a very small amount to grab to tight and loosen it.  The second hold down band came apart as I took it out of the package.  The others I've had have has a stitch holding it together.  This was just glued and didn't last.  I'm not too worried about that because since the band is so short, I would have used it anyway.  If I go purely by looks, it's nearly a 5 star because it is really nice, but the other things have brought it down.  I paid $45.  I don't know that it is worth that much."
3.0,I expected these to be fairly nice considering the price but they were pilling straight out of the package. I’ve washed them once and they look like pants I’ve owned for years. They are comfortable and the string is more of a small rope. They don’t feel like they’ll hold up for long. I would look elsewhere.
3.0,My son loves to run around outside. The shoe holds up but the white trim peeled off some.
3.0,Cute and as described but the backs don’t stay on even putting them as tight as they will go. My daughter lost one in a week.
3.0,The shirt is pretty and sexy. Runs a lil small but still fits like a glove. Loved it when I finally received it
3.0,"Very high waisted. Almost under bra.  After wearing for short time, material gives and starts to sag."
3.0,"Works fine, but doesn't have a second hand."
3.0,"This product was disappointing.  It runs small and it's hard as a rock, I could barely get my feet in.  Disappointing."
3.0,"Returned since it was too small for my wrist, even though it was stretchy."
3.0,"Not a real stone- it’s a plastic bead, but constructed well."
3.0,"This chain is super, super fine, so don't expect much bling.  The tiny ball stations are faceted, but they are so tiny you can't even hardly see the chain on you when you're wearing it.  If I had seen it in person I would not have purchased, but it is okay."
3.0,I love the piece but I gave it 3 stars because its tiny!! If it was bigger I'd give it 5 stars.
3.0,"The plus to these bands is you get three for a cheap price.  The minus is they just feel uncomfortable.  I've tried all three and they feel scratchy on my wrist.  Not painful, just irritating.  I can't speak to to their longevity, but the end of one is already curling up."
3.0,Has good stretch and the material is soft. The color is pink and not sheer like photo which was disappointing. Not to fond of the sleeves but they will work. Length is where it should be.
3.0,"I have been looking for a light weight bag to pack supplies when we go on hikes. It does the job well. The material is a bit on the thin side, and i wish it had a couple more pockets (inside or out) to hold smaller items. Overall, it does the job and fits what I was looking for."
3.0,"Strange shape, tight around chest and sleeve area then gets a little wider going down, but still a slim fit and very long. I got the size 7/8 for my size 7 daughter and it looks very small even before washing. It's going back."
3.0,"The sizing was just off for me. I ordered a size up, and had to struggle to pull them up. Once they were on they weren’t comfortable for me. I’m sure for someone who is the right size, they’d be wonderful. Just not for me. Fabric was very soft! I WISH so much that they’d have fit better."
3.0,"Instead of saying ""World"" it said ""work"".  This was for a christmas present so basically it wont work and I will have to find something else."
3.0,It’s cute but too small for me to wear
3.0,"I gave this dress 3 stars because it was somewhat smaller than I expected. I ordered an extra large so that it would fit a little loosely, but it did not.I also would have preferred it to be a few inches longer. I am 5&#34;8 and I love for maxi dresses and skirts to fall to my ankles. This dress came above my ankles. I do like the material and I will continue to wear the dress. I would just have preferred it be longer. Those shorter than 5&#34;7 would likely be pleased with the length."
3.0,"It's a decent bag,  not what I expected I thought would be larger in length and width so I can't use it for its intended purpose.  But that's on me.  I misinterpreted the measurements"
3.0,Shrunk a bit. Could be bigger.
3.0,This is a pretty watch but the metal on the sides of the band is sharp in places. I'm thinking about returning the watch for this reason.
3.0,"My 4 year old loves them, fit perfect. However,they are poorly made. The quality is not very good and she has had them for a week and both bows have fallen off. (To her this is the end of the world)"
3.0,"I liked that the dryer was not full of lint after this was washed.  No lint at all which surprised me.  This is a very thick, heavy robe.  Personally I would prefer not quite so much bulk.  It also runs a wee bit small which may be because of the thickness of the material.  Not small enough to not fit but not as generous as I prefer.  It is warm and soft."
3.0,I thought the scarf would be larger and thicker.
3.0,This was a reorder of a previous product which was very satisfactory. This is different: apparently glued rather than stitched as the first one. We’ll see.
3.0,This ring is a beautiful design however the 1st week I have had it I noticed a black color on my toes but it hasn’t done it lately! So idk if maybe it was reacting to a lotion or something but I’m saying that a real gold should not turn any color!<br />I bought the rose gold..kind of disappointing
3.0,"I bought these solely for the support and arch. I have since replaced the sole with an orthotic insole and these are now fine. Their was not a good enough arch or support with these. If they want to please those who suffer from plantars facitis or are trying to avoid this painful condition,  please update your insole to a decent, supportive one."
3.0,Not the one in picture so not happy
3.0,The color does not work for me even though I love it on the model.
3.0,"It is a really nice key ring, but is much smaller than i anticipated."
3.0,It is a little small so it is tight to pull hood on and off.
3.0,"Good price, but a bit on the small size"
3.0,These bras are comfortable but has a bit too much fabric in the back feels loose kinda but still comfortable. Only problem it says you can machine wash this bra but I washed one of them one time and the wire already popped out which really disappointed me cause it was the color I would use the most.
3.0,"I really want to like this necklace - I bought it to match with the baroque pearl dangle earrings that the same vendor sells (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y8MWSV7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1).<br /><br />The baroque pearls on the earrings are 15-17mm, and for this necklace they are 12-14mm.  From the pictures, I thought they would match nicely. But the reality is that the pearls on this necklace appears a lot smaller.<br /><br />The product picture shown here has a rather large center pearl - where your focus would be. But the product I received does not have this feature. Even though I did not expect the middle one to be larger, I suspect the picture still had an effect on me and made me believe the pearls would appear larger."
3.0,"In theory, its cute. My only complaint is that the top is not adjustable. I ordered a large because my hips are 41 and I'm a D, but the back was too large and there was only one &#34;connector&#34; to hold the straps in place."
3.0,"I wanted a backpack that was compartmentalized for different business materials along w/ my laptop.  This is a good back pack for a couple of days on the road, but not much longer...."
3.0,"Love it, I wear it to work, & its holds everything in!"
3.0,"Got this for an ugly sweater run for my daughter...Told her not to wear it to dinner but she did and got stuff all over it, anyway, it needed to be washed.. AS PER INSTRUCTIONS, I had it dry cleaned...When it came back, ALL THE POMPOMS HAD FALLEN OFF.  Its a cute sweater but find a way to get around having to wash it."
3.0,"I ordered a size up bc I saw on the reviews to size up but once arrived, I didn’t have to open it to notice it was too big, luckily I ordered two other bras at the same time so one of the others fit."
3.0,"Fabric was kind of stiff & scratchy feeling, and the promising looking pics belie a boxy fit. Returned."
3.0,"When it arrived it was broken at the link and the claps were missing. Being mechanically inclined I was able to make a simple repair. Since then, I have received many compliments on it and a charm I bought from Amazon (years ago)."
3.0,Much bigger on my face then I wanted but they are cute. The polarized part kinda makes it weird when you look at your phone
3.0,"The dress is just OK, but not happy with it because don't like the fabric its made from."
3.0,"For the price it's not bad.<br />It takes a bit of adjustment to get it to cover the entire pool. If you have trees near the pool like I do, leaves and berries will clog the vacuum and it will need to be cleared to get it to work again.<br />Overall it does a decent job. One issue I had early on was the bumper ring broke.  It is not very sturdy and broke from the movement of the unit against the steeps.  This needs improvment. I would not buy another unless the part is improved."
3.0,Pretty but not so durable around the toes
3.0,"I'm a sucker for UA merchandise, even unlicensed.  This is fairly decent quality but it sheds like CRAZY.  The first several times it was worn, my baby ended up with little black fuzzies all over him.  Even after washing it several times, it continues to shed black fibers.<br /><br />The tag is on the outside, which is a little weird, but the baby seems to prefer that since it's not on his neck.<br /><br />Overall it's a meh product.  I would bump it up a star or two if not for the shedding, but having to give the baby a bath immediately after every time he wears this is very annoying."
3.0,It may help to prevent fogging without a mask but with a mask it is not the best. Sometimes helps a bit but in other occasions does not work at all. Would not buy again for sure.
3.0,To small but feels amazing
3.0,"I had read on the reviews before purchasing this that someone had it break but easily put it back together. I thought, 'it is what I want, and I am fairly careful so this shouldn't be a problem'. Was I wrong! The first time I put it on I was going from doubled up to one strand and it broke. I had barely tugged on it! Devastated, I laid it to the side to look at later. Luckily, after looking at it closely I realized that the previous review was right... it is fairly easy to put back together, and with 2 pairs of tweezers I had it good as new in less than 10 minutes. Since then I have become a pro at putting this back together because just about every time I wear it, the necklace breaks. It is easy, however really annoying at times, and something that would be impossible if I had small children. This issue aside, it is a very beautiful necklace and I have gotten many compliments. If I wear it doubled it is less likely to break (until I go to take it off) but I LOVE the way it looks long. I just know to be careful and expect to put it back together at some point during the day."
3.0,"My expectations were pretty low for a hat at this price and made in China. It's cute and I like the heather gray color so I will wear it, however I was disappointed with two things: (a) the fit is not nearly as slouchy as it looks on the model. It hugs my head/face pretty closely and I don't have a huge head/face lol. More troubling is (b) there is a huge ugly seam running down the back center of the hat -- very noticeable and makes the hat look very cheap. Click on the &#34;customer images&#34; for this product and you will see the seam I'm talking about. Because of the seam and non-baggy fit, I wouldn't order this product again."
3.0,"Not real wool, a little big, the edges are not sewn. Cheap looking up close but from afar looks great. I still kept it sincs the color combination is nice."
3.0,They are very cute. But they let in lots of light all around because they so set far from your face so it doesn't really protect very well.  But if your driving they are alright. It does have strong polarizing. But that can be a little distracting sometimes.
3.0,"I gave this as a gift to a friend that collects rhino stuff, he loved it,  but he dropped it and the rhino fell off, I got some jewelery glue and it held for a while but the fell off again."
3.0,"I initially ordered my normally purchased size which is an xl because it says runs true to size. I like my clothing a bit loose and not tight fitting. Well it was tight in the arms and shoulders. I was sure with one time thru washer and it would shrink so I clicked return and ordered one size up, a 1X. It arrived and it's still too tight. I'm 5'10, 190# but I have a very long torso, do I typically need a bigger size just to cover my body appropriately. The style is super cute. The material is the extra thickness I wanted. It just doesn't fit and I'm not looking to try 2 sizes bigger than my regular size. That hits hard on the inner emotions when I'm not truly that overweight."
3.0,Stretches out easily and be careful with the bow. Suggestions would be to wash carefully and with starch.
3.0,I am a 2 and the small fit very well
3.0,"Loved it in the photo, not so much in person. As described."
3.0,The material is really strange.  It has a sticky film feel to it.  I threw it in the wash and hopefully it comes off
3.0,"I don’t love it, but I don’t hate it. I’m a 14-16 and I got a xxl. Pics are taken right out of the package, so you can see the fabric is a little stiff and wrinkles. I already have the long sleeve black one and I get compliments on that all the time. The red, isn’t quite the same. I tried the army green one and it was awful, showed every line and curve (in a bad way)"
3.0,"I have hands that measure 8+&#34; around so I ordered the 8.5 to accommodate some longer nails. The gloves were still too short in the fingers and they barely cover the wrist. I'll keep them to walk the dog, but I will get another brand that fits better."
3.0,"I had to return these since they did not fit.  The seem to be cut smaller than what i thought.  If you buy these, make sure you order at least one, if not two, size larger."
3.0,I wear 1X so i order 2X so it can fit me loose the color is bright as in the picture
3.0,sorry not exactly what i was hoping for. they are pretty but they look cheap. my friend wants to borrow them for her wedding so at least i have some use for them.  i gave this a 3 star cause i am not to happy.
3.0,Nice Quality too but rubs larger then expected.
3.0,"I ordered XL... the support seemed fine putting them on and pulling to the top... however, they were too long for me and the elastic tops immediately rolled and were VERY uncomfortable... prob unhealthy too.  I pulled the top down to about mid calf and got through the day.. BUT......"
3.0,My son's feet are big - a christmas gift that may not fit size 13!
3.0,"I'm going to keep it bc it'll work, but it is super small! I'm a 14 and bought a XXL and it definitely wouldn't close if it had a tie."
3.0,"the head band cools for a little while, but it does't absorb much sweat. I switch to my cotton head band"
3.0,Ordered a size smaller according to reviews but it’s pretty tight. Ended up needing my normal size.
3.0,thin and too long !!!  does not give enough support !1  design is cute
3.0,Style is t what is reflected in photo; much longer and wider
3.0,This is small. It will work for the tiny 15 year old girl I bought it for. Who weighs 70 lbs soaking wet. It barely fit my mom who tried it on to compare who is 5'3 and 110 lbs.<br />Also it came thrown in a plastic bag and has a hundred and one wrinkles in it.
3.0,These necklaces are cute . They are smaller then I thought but that’s okay . You get what you pay for basically .
3.0,The picture was very deceiving as to the size of this charm..it is very cute but very much smaller than I anticipated..I will still use it and enjoy it but definitely not for the purpose I ordered it..
3.0,It’s okay. However it is pretty cheaply made and the straps are pretty thin. I feel like it could easily break with a lot of use. If it was priced cheaper it would have been okay.
3.0,Love these banana hammock!!!😂 not so invasive on the back area 😂 nice stitching if you shave on the lower part😉😉 and the design love it 😆😗😘😍😚😎  I already have the next color pack on my wish list😀 .
3.0,It's a good shoe but next time I'll buy something just as good a third of this price..
3.0,"Nice silver case. The only thing he,doesn't like is the,size of the numbers . Very fine lines on the face"
3.0,They are nice but run small in size. They are very tight.
3.0,Dress material is cheap feeling and very much polyester. It isn’t the most flattering fabric at all. I sent it back.
3.0,This was a larger size than I thought I would have needed. The shoulder straps are really uncomfortable!
3.0,Fits a bit smaller than the other ones I ordered.  Lovely accessory to a dress or skirt.
3.0,Good quality. Good value. Works for me.
3.0,Not as nice of material as I had hoped
3.0,"They are ok. Fit is a bit awkward in the legs and the kids are not a fan of the butt zipper, but otherwise satisfied with them. Only worn once so can comment yet to durability issues others have seemed to report."
3.0,This was cute but uncomfortable only around the shoulders. I returned it because it maybe that I’m too tall. So if you’re short you may not need to order a size up.
3.0,I'm used to better quality from Grace Karin
3.0,"Edit: I have to edit this review as she returned both of them to me. After further consideration, she said that the bust is too small even when sizing up a size. This dress is lovely and has so much potential but it needs to be made in larger sizes and more accurately labeled sizes. Their size 10 was too tight on a size 8 woman who is actually about halfway between a 6 and an 8. If they relabel their size 10 as a size 8 and then come up with some sizes for all of us who are a little larger, then this would be a wonderful dress and I would happily edit my review again.<br /><br />Original review:  This dress is actually quite nice. The fabric is wonderfully soft and light, without being sheer. The cut is as pictured and it looks like it does on the model, if you get a smaller model. I ordered the correct size, double checking all measurements, and found that their ""10"", which is actually a ""Large"", fits a size 8 quite beautifully, with a smaller than average bust, and is a bit tight on a size 10 with nearly no bust to speak of. Needless to say, I have a larger bust so this won't work for me. It would be nice to see larger sizes for bustier women. If they offered an Extra Large, I am certain that would fit my frame and bust and, if need be, I could just take in the empire waist-line, to achieve my best fit. Unfortunately, they cap it at size 10/Large. It is a shame, again, because it is a 10 that will only fit small busted women, even though the rest fits and hangs beautifully.<br /><br />I hope this company will add some larger sizes so I can try this one again. It has great potential, if they fix the bust issue."
3.0,I love the colors the Rings would not stay closed the L shape very hard to put in my nose. And a little corkscrew forget it impossible to put in
3.0,"Absolutely love this watch, I've had it for a few months now and the quality is great. I keep getting compliments for it and people are always surprised when I tell them what I paid for it, it looks much more expensive than the $40 I paid for it.<br /><br />Update: I'm very disappointed that two of the stones have fallen off and keeps getting stuck under the dials causing the watch to stop. I really loved this watch but I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"the bowtie was not taught, it was very loose, everything else was great."
3.0,It fits like a glove but it's advertised as WHITE but it's more if a cream or off white which is disappointing as I was needing a WHITE dress.
3.0,"My son was reluctant to use them.  I thought it is a good idea.  Yet he is the golfer, not me."
3.0,"PROS: Provides vavavoom cleavage, sizing was on point, price was good, holds up will after washing.<br />CONS: Rests a little lower on my abdomen than I prefer, doesn’t have options for straps.<br />FYI’S: Always use a mesh delicate laundry bag for bras and intimates."
3.0,Everything was spot on for my husbands 20’s theme ball with daughter. Only thing I disliked was the hat was extremely way too small.
3.0,"Super cute, just too big for me. Wish I was  little bit taller."
3.0,Maybe if your 5’1 this can fit you but it was too short for my friends and I who are 5’5
3.0,"Beautiful dress. Shorter than I hoped for and sheer but it worked. Unfortunately, the bow on the back ripped right off. I guess it wasn't sewn into the seems. That was disappointing but thankfully it didn't leave holes. If the bow didn't rip and the dress was accurate in size, it would definitely be 5 stars. It is very beautiful but I'd say cheaply made. She see through built in slip barely covered her butt. The sheer tutu was longer but it didn't help with coverage. It worked but I ended up adding pants underneath when she wore it. Definitely go up a size.  Unfortunately she won't be able to wear again so it was bought to just wear once 😞"
3.0,"Really cute designs, but VERY fragile. I gave 8 of them away when I saw they could not stand up to my use."
3.0,"The sizes were confusing, but we did order the correct one.  It looks good, except the mini pocket square the peeks out.  You can't hide it and it is in the front of the pocket so covering it with the correct color pocket square is not a possibility either."
3.0,The dress is great. It is nice and thick. The hat is incorrect for the character and the glove is a rubber nightmare.
3.0,The color was really off on this. And the fabric was a little more light-weight than expected. Returning.
3.0,"Necklaces were purchased as gifts. I opened package to find 3 white stone necklaces, instead of what was advertised and pictured in their ad.  One was tiger eye and one was jade green, one had a speck of purple on the tip and the other 3  were  all white! Probably will not purchase again!"
3.0,"Broke a week after having them, but were very nice looking"
3.0,It’s pretty and comfortable but I feel that it’s more for looks than protection
3.0,Awkward boxy fit but it is a pretty top.
3.0,Don’t like the Material
3.0,"Order larger, they seem to run small. (Short)"
3.0,"I’m not completely sure it was leather, although it looked like it, but the size didn’t work for me either way. It was a bit bigger than I hoped but it was a lovely bag. It’s not oversized. I was hoping I could wear it across the body but it wasn’t the right style for that."
3.0,I like the design of these glasses but was not impressed with the quality of them. It came in pack of three and all of them have same design and size but different colors.
3.0,Lo largo bueno pero de lo ancho le apreta mucho
3.0,"I mean, the pattern is pretty and the general design I like. However, I just couldn't get it to work around the waist/bust area. Just wasn't flattering at all.<br /><br />I even ordered a size M because it appeared to fit lose and the listing advised to order a size down. I definitely agree with that assessment. If you're gonna try it be sure and size down unless you are super busty."
3.0,"Didn't fit as well as it appeared, chest. Too loose."
3.0,"Probably a good robe for those that live in North Dakota or Alaska, but way to heavy for me."
3.0,Okay. Very soft. Not as thick as I would like for winter. But these would be perfect for fall or spring.
3.0,No the color i was expecting but they are nice
3.0,"The zipper kept breaking apart and wouldn’t stay closed, but the quality of the bag was really good. I think I just got a defective one."
3.0,"I normally do not write reviews, but since I use reviews to help me all the time and I have something to say about this to help you, I felt obligated to:<br /><br />I ordered it in a size small, I’m 5’1 and big chested, and fit fine, true to size. However, the right strap ripped in the middle of my sleep after about 2 weeks. I even exchanged it, easily as amazon is great with that. However after about another 2 or so weeks, the right strap ripped AGAIN on the new one, actually in the same spot when I sat in bed. After two times, I’m not making the same mistake. I advise you not to either and recommend you get a nightgown with better made, possible thicker straps. Gave 3 stars bc it’s cute."
3.0,"These delivered quickly and became my go to every day pair! Sadly they quickly tarnished (&lt;90 days), but I suppose you get what you paid for!"
3.0,"The fit was fine, but the buttons go down the shirt too much, which design-wise, I think only really works if you have pecs which are more... developed than mine."
3.0,The material seems very cheaply made it's almost like it's a pattern but thinly made tight and snug more 4 the club then for just a throw and go
3.0,This was not the color shown in the picture.  It came more of a brighter red instead of a wine red and the top looks slightly different.  Otherwise it's a nice material and is pretty long.
3.0,Good quality a little sung but nice
3.0,Not a true red.  They are comfortable though.
3.0,They are beutiful but to small
3.0,worked great for 24 hours then failed. Replacement band #2 being sent by vendor
3.0,it does look like the picture but gave it to my granddaughter as it was to tight for my wrist. She loved it
3.0,Tallaje muy inexacto - Demasiado grande-
3.0,"These pants were a gift for my Mum & she loves them. They appear to be bright blue, but they are navy blue."
3.0,Came on time and looks amazing. But I ordered a size larger than I wear and it was still too small and tight.
3.0,Cute for cat lovers!
3.0,"They are perfect for costume use, but not for everyday wear."
3.0,They keep you from sliding but somewhat small.
3.0,Brought for a family member going through cancer treatments.  She liked but she has a small head and these turbans red and black that I ordered did not stretch and fit her head snuggly.  We had to use decorative pins to take up the slack but she said that they look and felt just fine on her bald head.
3.0,It's not made clear that the top is a crop top. It doesn't say anything about that in the description and the user pictures do not indicate it either. It's a very cute pj set but I hate hate hate crop tops.
3.0,"Well, the product looks good. The only issue, (and it is a dangerous one), is about that the staple release with a very low pressure... Just bending a little the wrist. Happened today to me and I dropped my watch down today and the band now is broken. So, be careful. Luckily, my watch is ok."
3.0,"This bag is just okay, for me.  It is a bit larger than I thought it would be.  The packaging was rather poor.  The bag was folded up and shoved into a small box.  When you open the box it was like a mass that wanted out immediately.  The bag is easy to clean, with the nylon body of it.  There are many pockets which allow for so much storage.  There is a small picket in the front that is kind of awkward as it sits vertically.  I feel that the quality is a little on the poor side, it just feels cheap.<br />For myself, I probably won't be using this bag long.  It just doesn't seem to be for me.  I want something a little more stylish and modern.  This would have been a good style for a decade or so ago.<br />This review was made in exchange for a discount purchase price on the item."
3.0,The fabric makes it a costume. It fits good. I needed a more authentic outfit for an event. I’ll keep it just in case I have a friend/family that’s needs it.
3.0,Too bulky on the clip. Too visible.
3.0,I received the wrong size.
3.0,It fits loosely because it did not come with the padding. There are slits for padding but no padding
3.0,The quality of the belt for the price was a good value.  I did return this belt because it was more narrow than I'm used to wearing.  I am a big man with a 58&#34; waist and when I tried it on i felt like my pant waist was rolling over the top.  I think a big guy needs more width in a belt.
3.0,Make sure to order two sizes up!<br />And be aware the shirt is very transparent<br />Other than that overall what I expected.
3.0,Ok for the price but I was expecting it to have a bit more structure instead of a floppy bag.  It doesn't stand up like it looks in the photo.  also the clasp is very weak and doesn't stay together.  Overall still like the color and style.
3.0,This bra is probably good for gals with smaller breasts.  I'm a 38 D and my breasts looked squashed.  The quality is very good and the bra is comfortable otherwise.
3.0,"First, I really like the looks of this mask.  I play the piano at church, so the music motif is perfect.  Also, it comes with two filters.<br /><br />However, there was an error in manufacturing and the nose wire has been placed in the bottom edge of the mask, and in order for it to be on my nose, the mask would have to be worn upside down.  I can fix this, but had to knock off a couple of stars for this problem."
3.0,"Overall, I like this dress but I certainly have issues with it. It does run smaller than expected and the slit in the front of the dress is just ridiculous. I read plenty of reviews, so I knew it might be an issue and it still is despite me sizing up! I’m pretty much a 14/16 and 5’3, so I ordered the XL which is supposed to be a 16/18. Well the dress fits fine, except for the fact that it is dangerously and uncomfortably close to flashing my vagina. And again, I am 5’3 (not a tall girl AT ALL) and I sized up and I will STILL have to wear tights and safety pin the bottom of this dang dress!! Furthermore, because I sized up the chest area is now loose fitting and I’ll have to safety pin that as well to avoid even more possibilities of me flashing people and just generally looking inappropriate. I’m honestly shocked by how poor the fit of it is, but I have to wear it to my event because I have no backup options and not enough time to exchange it. I will say, it looks beautiful while on after it’s been ridiculously safety pinned, but I wish the dress was designed differently so that you’re not flashing your crotch to the whole world. It should not take this much safety pinning just to look decent in this dress."
3.0,The leather rapidly started to loose color and quality.
3.0,"The onsie is cute, and the color was pretty close to the picture.  My only issue is that it's super tight across the books and baggy in the butt. I'm not even that busty!!"
3.0,The shoes are ice nd comfortable. However the suede has pills after wearing 4 times. I've had many suede Pumas in the past and this is the first time I have this issue
3.0,"Definitely a great little purse for small outings. But it’s not something for anything fancy. Does not look like leather at all. Looks like cheap plastic. I’m not sure how long it will last before peeling. Extremely shiny. I’m very disappointed about that. If the sunshine is out I’m going to blind someone. Nice concert or casino purse though, but that’s not what I purchased it for"
3.0,Kinda funky.  Arm seams are halfway down my arms instead of being at my shoulders.  Fabric is nice and fit as expected.
3.0,"Bought for a 6yo. They're much too big. Package says for 10.5m to 4 shoe, but they're clearly larger than any socks I've ever bought in this range before. Counting on shrinkage to bring them down to size."
3.0,This is a pretty basic compression sock but does not provide the compression that I like.  I think that everyone is different but this is not my style.  This seems more like a tight sock rather than a compression sock if that makes any sense.  The compression sleeves that I prefer are much more elastic like and compress a lot more.  It is decent but not the best in my personal opinion.
3.0,"I loved the color and style, but when I received it, it looked like it was meant for a child. It was extremely small, especially for a large. I would definitely recommend going up a size or two. It ended up being really short."
3.0,"Just too tight around the bust & stomach, other than love the dhirt"
3.0,Great price very nice charm but shipping took a long time
3.0,"Nice gloves...but did not work with my iphone 6 plus. Very disappointing as I needed gloves that worked with my phone.<br /><br />I will keep them because they are good quality, just don't expect them to work with your phone.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. All thoughts, opinions, and experiences are my own."
3.0,"Very nice product, but delivery from China took too long."
3.0,My favorite flower. Beautiful But fell apart after three days
3.0,Nice...but snapped after one wearing.
3.0,A little small in size otherwise beautiful.
3.0,"small lense size, I don't have the largest face but these looked tiny on me."
3.0,Looks nice but fades after while
3.0,"Arrived damaged but I was able to repair with my own jewelry tools. The rosses are very eye catching and compliment my existing group of bracelet, ring, earrings and now necklace. My other necklace is a large rose on ribbon. It tends to twist and ride crooked."
3.0,It is a fair looking hat for the low price.
3.0,I really want to love this sports bra but the bottom of the zipper rubs your skin raw.
3.0,I couldn't get these over my calves so I wore them scrunched and had the cape hanging out of my boots. I wore them with my Halloween costume. I do have large 15&#34; calves.
3.0,Sent back.  Too small
3.0,I suppose I might be a hard fit...it fits fine on my back side but too big on my legs.  I just cannot find a pair of Jeans that fits ALL of me properly and I've wasted so much money and so much time and frustration sending things back... it's exhausting.  This is one good reason I HATE shopping.
3.0,"The length on this is hilarious. I am 5'8"" and while it fits in girth, there is no way this works for me. It doesn't even fully cover my butt."
3.0,he liked it a lot. Specially since it was unique. good buy
3.0,"I would have rated this cap higher except for the size, def too large.  Says 'women's' for the design and not the size.  I wear baseball caps a lot and only rarely has the cap been too large where even sinching up the Velcro would barely work.  This means there wasn't enough of the Velcro loops left for the hooks to stay tight.  So being a sewer, I unstitched the seam holding the Velcro, cut off a chunk, restitched it in place, and stitched the piece I cut off on the surface of the cap so the Velcro would grab the extra tail the back strap had..... (Hard to explain). Very cute design, nice light weight fabric, unique fold in the bill for packing it in your travel bags.  Wish more colors were available."
3.0,even though it my  size it was fitted as expected
3.0,"Very good quality (as expected from TUMI).  Very small- with limited capacity outside a laptop and notebook, pens, etc; so make sure this is what you want."
3.0,"Product was 2nd band I ordered, and in comparison, this was a little more of a let down vs the other. The leather feels really cheap, almost fake. It has a pleather feel to it. The stitching was pretty bad, not lined up in parts and pulling out on the ends. The metal clasps holding the smaller leather strap down are just close enough to make manipulating the band more of a pain. I had to use pliers to pull the small strap back through after I modified the bracelet.<br /><br />Whoever made this one didn't take pride in the product they sold. I do not fault the business I ordered it from, just a little more disappointed than I thought I'd be. It might be just that leather itself."
3.0,These are fine however one pair got a hole in the toe after one use.
3.0,Not adjustable to pens. Elastic fits pencils only
3.0,It was delivered on time and i like the sweater but it smell like gasoline no matter what i did. It still has lingering gasoline smell....
3.0,Smaller than I thought. Little stiff
3.0,"The quality of this dress was not what I expected. The material is very thin and the stitching of the buttons are poor, most likely will fall off with time. I misplaced the packaging for this otherwise I would've returned the dress. Not what I expected"
3.0,Order was badly damaged and crushed when it arrived yesterday. I ordered a size smaller than my daughter wears and they fit perfectly. She wears a size 13 and I ordered a size 12. Quality is not great and shoes look like they had been worn once.
3.0,Beautiful cut and design. My only complaint is the quality of the lining material.  Mine tore a hole within the first month of wearing
3.0,"Thin, see through fabric. If you don’t like your under garments seen, you may want to reconsider. I purchased a large in yellow"
3.0,Smaller than I excepted
3.0,Comfortable top
3.0,Fix what I want . Good 😊
3.0,Nice but it’s so slippery that it doesn’t stay in place as I flip and flop during the night.
3.0,"Great for yoga, walking, or lifting but NOT good for running or anything that you think you need your boobs to stay still for.  I'm 5'9&#34; 160 lbs and 34D.  I ran with this bra on and my girls were all over the place.  It has weird padding in it too that are round and show through anything that isn't a cotton shirt.  If you remove the padding, you definitely will have some headlights."
3.0,"I loved the color and pattern on this dress.  However, for larger chested ladies this dress will not work.  Sending it back."
3.0,These socks are wonderful.  But be careful!  The picture is misleading!  It looks like you will be getting three socks but you only get one pair.  :(
3.0,"I guess I should have looked at the ad closer.  Thought I was getting all 5 of the glasses for that price!  Ended up I only got the one, the copper one.  These are ok. That's about it."
3.0,A little thinner than I thought but looks good.
3.0,"Thinner than I expected. Very lightweight. Sheds a bit. Good for accessory, but not as I planned to use it."
3.0,The shape of the hat is kind of weird but overall good hat and I really like the Kermit stitching:)
3.0,"These pants are overall great in quality, but I had some issues with sizing since I noticed they do stretch out quite a bit. I first ordered a small, but returned because it squeezed me too much in the waist area. I then ordered a medium (which, actually, fit all my measurements according to the size chart), but in my first workout I noticed the waist band got pretty loose and did not stay put so I had to keep pulling them up. Definitely should have stayed with the smaller size if I knew it would stretch out that much. The fabric itself feels really nice though--definitely size down if you're in between"
3.0,Poor battery
3.0,"The quality of the fabric is good, but one of the glasses fell of during first time wearing the hat"
3.0,I really like the quality of the cap but they run small. I wish it ran bigger where it would cover more of my head.
3.0,This chain is very fragile and tangled eastily.Because the flower is attached to the chain it caint  be put on another chain.
3.0,"I bought 2 shirts, different brand ,same XL size and this one didnt fit at all, it looks good, but when i fitted it it was very tight, and would be uncomfortable wearing it"
3.0,It's an ok sports bra. I prefer a little more support. Will probably use it for activities other than running as that requires better support. Will not order another of this style.
3.0,"Expected blouse to fit better, cannot indicate based on choices above."
3.0,"Not the most comfortable but they seem like decent quality. I'd say ""good enough"""
3.0,"They fit as I expected, but what I hate is they roll down and slip down while wearing.  Needs more of a waistband to prevent.  Other than that I like.  But will probably not wear very often."
3.0,shorter than anticipated. My height is 5'7''
3.0,This was a nice dress. Very well-made but just wasn’t right for me. I like the cut of it but it just didn’t lay right on me. Sorry but I had to return it for that purpose only.
3.0,Okay so I bought these for my one year old daughter thinking I was buying a size 3 baby shoe. NOPE! She will be able to fit into them when she is 15.... Asian sizes so pay attention!
3.0,It's ok. My daughter liked it!
3.0,"Cheap looking bands, the wolf is very nice quality."
3.0,center flower came off too easily. But is very beautiful and I just glued it back on no big deal.
3.0,Guess I didn't notice how low the heal is in the pictures with the discription.  Especially with the insert.  They are ok around the house as long as I don't do a lot of walking.  Driving is a definite no.  The heals are so low my heal slips and the edge cuts into the bottom of my heal.  When driving it's even worse due to the normal angle of the foot on the pedals.  After about 5 minutes the heal starts to hurt.  I'm also not impressed with the quality on the inside of the shoe.  The inserts work however.
3.0,"Dislike, pulls socks down while walking. The better insole helps a lot. Like the weight and quality."
3.0,"Not impressed with this product for the amount of money spent. It showed up in just a plastic wrapper. No notes no thank you for your purchase nothing Nada! Similar priced items that I made for silk sleepwear from another company included a very nice box, instructions for cleaning the product, and a catalog including other items that the company sales.<br /><br />It does fit my wife's 5'11&#34; 165lb frame very well. She like the feel and the look. I myself don't really see $99.50 worth. It doesn't seem as heavy of silk material. I will see how it wears over the next few months. For now I am keeping the 3 star rating."
3.0,"Size ran super small, about two sizes too small. I couldn't even get them on my son's feet without socks. They were nice and seemed comfortable, just be sure to order two or even three sizes (just to be safe) bigger if you buy!"
3.0,The color is beautiful and the design is very flattering.  The material is a little more rough than I was expecting but for the price you can’t beat it
3.0,the color is great.  The texture of the hat is good as well.  There are flaws in the weaving but I guess I can live with it.  I dont hate it enough to send back.
3.0,"Super service, Product just as ordered, may need some adjusting"
3.0,Beautiful dress just to small for my daughter
3.0,"Great color, looks like a tent when you wear it."
3.0,"You can tell it’s cheap, but the price is fair. The material is more fuzzy than expected. Wish the sleeves were longer, but I liked the length, which is great for my longer torso and wider hips"
3.0,I had my watch measured by a jeweler and ordered accordingly. The band is too big for my watch.
3.0,Nice colors. Loose material
3.0,They do fit over my prescription glasses but they also allow too much light to come in over the top of the lenses for my eyes.  A little disappointed.  I will use them but not in bright sunlight.
3.0,Somewhat Large.
3.0,"Not tight enough, fit like socks"
3.0,"Great shirt but runs very small, ordered a large but only fit a medium sized person"
3.0,"Beware that this is not cotton-- It almost feels like lycra or spandex plasticky material. My daughter is desperate for dinosaur dresses and they're hard to find so I kept it but the material is not ideal. For what it's worth, she doesn't seem to mind but I would have returned it if it were me wearing it."
3.0,Exactly what I was looking for. Fits true to size and more flattering than expected. Quality is to be expected.
3.0,I lost my job right when I got these no way to return them. So I'm stuck with them. Nice materal
3.0,Very thin material.  You get what you pay for. You would def have to have you daughter wear clothing underneath so order accordingly. Overall good for Halloween.
3.0,Cute but several of the fringe tore off the first day. I think I will just cut them all off.
3.0,"Not loose fitting like photo, thicker material."
3.0,My son is typically a 1. We ordered a 2. He has a high arch/instep but usually this style of shoe is fine with it. It was uncomfortable and small. One was slightly bigger feeling he said. We ended up grabbing a pair from aldi for $3
3.0,"I love the over all design of the denim overalls. However, the sizing is not accurate. The small fits more like an extra-small. I’m 5’6” 125lbs. I typically wear a size small but would have been great with a medium since the material has zero elasticity. So even if you wanted this garment to be more form fitting than loose you run the risk of the seams tearing."
3.0,"It works best if your hair is down, but if your hair is in a pony tail, it slips, according to my 10-year-old daughter that wanted it for basketball games."
3.0,"The chain is very weak and the metal is obviously cheap. Since it's so light, the necklace has a tendency to flip. It's an okay value for the price, but not great."
3.0,Appear to be little girl knee highs
3.0,Shade is toooooo dark
3.0,Smaller than I thought and doesn't stick very well
3.0,After reading the reviews I have to conclude the sizing must be very inconsistent. I read a review where the lady said she was 5'5&#34; and 140lbs and a medium fit fine. I am those exact measurements so I ordered a medium. It fits like a t-shirt. Doesn't even come close to covering all of my hiney. I will keep it because I like the design and color... But it will be worn as a shirt rather than a cover-up.
3.0,NOT AS CUTE AS ON THE PICTURE!
3.0,"I like the watch, just that it is too big and you need a small flat tip just to readjust to make it fit my wrist.  I dropped the watch once and the seconds hand fell off.  I also noticed that the seconds are about 1/10 second off."
3.0,Band itself is a nice comfy material. Unfortunately the quick release tabs are bulky and clicked when rotating on the watch. They also started to rub against the housing of the watch itself.
3.0,runs big get a size smaller then you normally wear (if you wear a large get a medium)
3.0,The product is very secure from a safety standpoint and easy to clean but they are very difficult to open the safety latch once buckled. If not for my boyfriend I would be stuck in this belt and have to cut it off!
3.0,Smells and feels like real leather. Hard to put on by yoursel.  Made more for teens rather than grown men. Fits me just right. 14yr old female.  5.2ft. 125lbs
3.0,"i love how the dress looked and bought it. unfortunately i had to return it, because it was too big on top and short on the thighs."
3.0,Hard to put the back into the hole
3.0,Cute but the sizing is WAY off.  Order one or 2 sizes bigger.
3.0,Should say “winter” hat. Too much hat for just sun protection in California summer
3.0,they are a cheaper metal and can be adjusted but one of them broke when i adjusted it so be careful
3.0,Start to lose the strength when clipped to shirt and sock. Ends up coming undone mid day
3.0,"These slippers are very comfortable, and I liked them at first. But I take a size ten shoe, so I ordered the slipper in a size ten. They fit my foot just right but not all snug. So, because the cloth inside is slippery and had no grip, the slippers would slide off my feet when walking. I tried them with socks so my feet would have some grip and they worked fine for a while. Then after the slippers broke in with time, they started to fall off my feet. Now I can't wear them at all. Should I order them in a size nine? I don't think I want to take the chance they will be too small. Disappointing."
3.0,The dress was too small. Waste of money!
3.0,Worked great until my 13 year old bent them. He might not have been as careful as I would have been. I will buy more for him.  I would be nice it I could find a thicker one.
3.0,"Unfortunately, this was too big and even if it fit, I don't think it would be as cute on me as it is on the model."
3.0,"I bought for my daughters, because that is what I always say to them.  Sadly, the clasps are very cheaply made.  Wont stay closed.  I will have to buy a better chain."
3.0,"Very pretty but if your busty, it'll just make you look wide and bigger on the top."
3.0,"the bracelet it's self is nice, but the clasp won't stay closed , spent more time picking it up off the floor than wearing it. ended up putting a small piece of black duck tape around the clasp to keep it closed."
3.0,Love this band but as it wears it has a sharp metal peice stabbing my arm
3.0,I bought the pink mirror lens and the silver colored just because I liked the look and wanted something different. These sunnies were cute but you get what you pay for. The mirrored lens started &#34;peeling&#34; from the inside out as weird as it sounds. I got a few uses out of it and received lots of compliments.
3.0,Very wide on my small head. Could be less wide and still fit over my glasses. Funny lookin!
3.0,"Bottom of slipper looks cheaply glued on. We will see how long they hold up, but I don't have high hopes."
3.0,A lil big in cup area
3.0,I like the style of them and i love the red lenses that show red colors too. The problem is they are not dark enough. I dont like sunglasses where people can see my eyes and these are very light red. They at least look cool in the pouch though.
3.0,"I had intended to wear this product with an outfit that I already had but, it got to me to late for that. And when I got it it was poorly made, had a paper back with the color white, was not exceptable."
3.0,Not great quality but not worth returning.
3.0,It’s falling apart.
3.0,"I was thrilled the first time I tried out my goggles and was prompted to swim more laps than usual; however when I wore them on subsequent swims they fogged up, much to my dismay"
3.0,"It's a nice suit just not all that flattering. The front fabric is longer and it just looks awkward, but it's comfortable"
3.0,I ordered a set of these tanks in February and loved them. Unfortunately just 3 months later the bottom hem on some of the shirts have come unraveled.
3.0,"This started coming apart where the sleeves connect (on both sides, so it's certainly a manufacturing error).<br /><br />Be very careful with the sleeves if you get one of these, they are pretty fragile. That being said, it is really warm and comfortable."
3.0,Difficult to use it on your shoes
3.0,Blackens fast
3.0,"I really loved these! The color and style were so cute, but I find that my foot may be too narrow for the style and my left foot slides a bit forward causing constant friction on my big toe. :(.. had to return. Otherwise, they are comfortable and have great heel support."
3.0,Returned Item.  Didn't like the fit.
3.0,"Somewhat short...purchased a medium for my boyfriend and it's the perfect height for him --but he is 5'7&#34; on a tall day! He says it's cozy but there is no crotch opening and the zipper doesn't go low enough, so it's quite inconvenient for him to take this off every time he needs to pee. Oh well. It's a fun gift."
3.0,Very cute.  Saving for Christmas present.
3.0,Nice bracelets except that I discovered nearly half were missing the screw-on bead that holds your charms on.  This makes them useless and as I'd already sold several it was too late to return them.  Disappointed!
3.0,"The dress in itself is very cute, nice material and the color is really good. But the dress isn't a dress at all im a bigger girl and im 5ft1 and it doesn't even cover my behind. Way too short so i plan to wear it as a nice blouse. The second thing is it does run small i ordered 2 sizes up from my normal size and it was still a little snug. A 5x fits like a 1 or maybe 2x."
3.0,"The photo clearly shows a thick, cotton looking sweater.  What i received was a cheap acrylic version of the photo they actually used.  Typical bait and switch, not worth $34 at all."
3.0,"Much larger than I expected, but very pretty"
3.0,So far I like that it fits perfect on me. I'm 5'2 and 168lbs. I got a large. I tried it on but it was a bit loose from waste down. I need to return for exchange for a medium. I went based on customer reviews bcuz I couldn't understand their size chart. Just fyi. Buy a size smaller if your not big on your waste down.
3.0,I loved it at first lots of people saying how pretty  but the chain started to change color  but then wit wasn't that  much money going to see if I can change  the chain on it
3.0,"Looks similar to what is pictured, however material is cheap and pretty thin. Certainly will need to wear nude colored underwear."
3.0,"This dress is pretty, but I was disappointed because it is not well made.... my dress, the neck area was too tight and seems like the lace was not where it is supposed to be. Whoever was sewing this dress did  very quick job and wasn't paying attention...<br />I like the material and the design, and maybe it is just mine was somehow not perfect.<br /><br />I am debating to return or keep it... or exchange it.."
3.0,"I really liked the lightweight material, but I was disappointed when the design washed off!  It faded more after every washing and now there’s only a faint shadow of what used to be there. 😔"
3.0,It’s rolls really bad and I felt like I was always pulling it down.
3.0,"The product was not so to my liking, it is very large and the fabric does not look of good quality, however it is the flag of my country and I wanted something like that, although I did not like it at all"
3.0,This was an expensive dress so I wasn't expecting much. It fit ok but it was a very thin clingy fabric.
3.0,"They are comfortable, look nice but over priced. Good for walking on easy trails where getting your feet wet is expected.<br />Toes slip forward a bit and can hang over the front of the sandal even if they are the right size.  They should be priced at 30-40 bucks in my opinion."
3.0,My little one looks so cute.
3.0,Nice color. Length a bit shorter than expected and wrinkles super easy.
3.0,"Very pretty in “mystic blue”, but I found it to be too big in the band. Order a Large per the size chart (I’m a 34D) and it was too loose, so if you’re a smaller-framed person, I would suggest ordering a size smaller than your normal band size, unless you want a looser fit."
3.0,While being insanely cute in person this cannot be used for a keychain.  I clipped it on my backpack and it broke after a week.  The vinyl figure inside it still cute and can be used for other things but the quality is kinda low considering the price.
3.0,"Bought two of these coats for my boys and they are nice and warm BUT within a month the zippers on BOTH coats were broken. For the price I was expecting good quality zippers, unfortunately not the case."
3.0,RUNNING SMALL
3.0,Smaller then i thought.. But still nice
3.0,Once that  tie across is undone you cannot get it to lay properly.
3.0,"The elephant is a lot bigger than i expected, its like two pieced glued together, ill just hang it up somewhere :)"
3.0,"I love the quote but am not thrilled with this purchase because the pendant cannot be removed from the chain. Additionally, the pendant is oriented so that your have the lobster claw in your left hand. I am right-handed so I cannot put this on by myself. Disappointing."
3.0,"I loved this design and style but, sadly..it was too big. I ordered a size I usually take but, ended up giving it to a friend.<br />It is made well, and super cute if you get the size correct."
3.0,"Soft but little too light for a jacket, more like a house coat. Sleeves we're too short had to return."
3.0,"First, the wallet was very nice. My husband liked the size and quality.<br /><br />The stars are marked down for the technology. There were insufficient instructions for paring with a phone and we had to search the internet for them. Then it wasn’t an easy process to get that done. Have not yet been able to get the wallet to ring the phone although the phone finds the wallet. Also it shows a pretty large area, so it’s not like you can lose the wallet in a house and find it. But you can be reasonably sure it’s in the building.<br /><br />Finally, we haven’t really tried leaving the wallet and seeing if that alert works. However, we have been alerted when the wallet was right there."
3.0,"I'm the kind of guy who, as hard as I try, the back of my shirt is always hanging out like a slob. I read about shirt stays in a magazine and off to Amazon I went.<br /><br />This product works fantastically for me. The length (and resulting force) of the shirt stays is totally adjustable.<br /><br />I was stupid enough to fall asleep wearing these (it was a long day). My rolling around broke the clips, I was unable to repair them. I still bought another pair and baby them and have had no more trouble. Additionally, I would occasionally have the clips get caught on the hem strings of my dress shirts.<br /><br />If I would change anything, it would be those darn clips, but if your careful with them, this works miracle for your appearance at work."
3.0,"These socks are only rated up to size 10, so I knew when I bought them that they may not be long enough I wear a 10.5). The stickies on the bottom only came up to just below my heel, and the back of the sock did cover up to my ankle. So I would not recommend these socks if you foot size is larger than a 9.  Even though these were sized up to a 10, I don't think they should have been this small for a 10.5 size foot."
3.0,"These shirts feel great and are very comfortable, however the sizing is way off. I normally wear an Xl size 16 in a top as I am full busted. These are way oversized, too long, the v neck is cut very deep. I did not return as I had already washed them, but if I were to order again, I would definitely size down."
3.0,Item is decent quality. It is a chubby wallet with having two sections. One with an accordion section for holding 10 credit cards and another section that you could put folded bills.
3.0,"Very cute, but the spring comes off really easy. Not good for someone who plays with their earrings a lot, although the spring sometimes comes off just from taking off/putting on a shirt too"
3.0,"I was disappointed to get this item and find that it had no metal grommet for the center hole, and it looked like it was cut out with a pair of scissors, leaving the hole frayed with dangling threads. The pockets for the arms should be a heavier material but they were not. Also material not as thick as I was led to believe. This item won't last long."
3.0,I wear 7-7.5 size shoes and these scrunch up my toes and don't go higher up my calf than I'd like. It's ok for someone shorter than 5'4&#34;.
3.0,"Definitely size down. The fabric is very soft and cozy and is good quality. It just feels like wearing a bag to be honest - I think it's the ""bat wing"" arm pit cut that makes it so drab. I'm 5'10"" 190lbs and got an XL. I could have easily gotten a medium."
3.0,the glasses are of quality frames but not of size. these was orderd in large but in fact came as small and in contacting company they said it was the largest size they had. so they some what deceived me . I sold these typ for five years so know what standard is .  they did offer return shipping label. I did not use decided to wear as regular sunglasses as they would not fit over my glasses.<br />that was bad choice. iv used yellow polarized for years to cut glare. these cut little not of best quality lens so got sun stress after riding motor bike all day. look around their is better out thier
3.0,"Cute design, but super thin fabric. I would be very reluctant to try washing this shirt (I suggest dry clean instead) and certainly wouldn’t put in dryer.<br /><br />I bought the ivory color and you could see right through it. Returned."
3.0,This tutu has a lot of volume and fits very comfortably. I am 5'5 and wear a women's size 16 and it fit great with room in the waist to spare. Unfortunately it smelled awful out of the box. Just a terrible chemical smell. I sprayed it with fabric freshener several times and let it air dry for days and the smell was only then tolerable but not fully gone.
3.0,The chain is almost black and very short. I was hoping it would be long enough to use the telescope without taking it off your neck.
3.0,Very big size
3.0,"Very cute earrings. Unfortunately, they are not sparkly . I guess, you have to buy a diamond earrings for that purpose. I guess, get what you pay."
3.0,"The straps are cute, but the largest size barely covers my C cup breasts, even after cutting out the padding. Larger breasted ladies steer clear"
3.0,Color wasn’t the same as picture.
3.0,It's not a bad item it's just not for my body type. I wear a size 12-14 and this dress just made me look more wider. The quality is great just not for me.
3.0,They don't seem like they'll hold up for a long time.  But we are getting the good out of them for now.
3.0,The material is alright but I ordered a medium and it fits like a large or xl and it does nothing for me in this case. Will try to return for a small and see how that goes but this medium is way too big.
3.0,"These sunglasses are very cute and stylish and are made nice but when i wear them and i have my head tilted downards, they slip down my nose. Almost falling off my face. Very annoying! Will not buy again."
3.0,button came off right away.  Too tight in the ribcage and not as long as shown in the picture.
3.0,"Earrings were very pretty, but some of the stones have fallen out."
3.0,"the shirt looks so pretty in the picture and when it arrives.  So glittery and sparkly.  Thought this would be nice for a disney promotion at work.  But,  after washing it there was no longer glitter on the part it was originally,  now that part was plain and glitter was all over the shirt. A little bummed that it's not so pretty anymore."
3.0,SUPER SHEER pants! And too big. Exchanging for something a bit less racy.
3.0,Cute but size down. A little disappointed because I was not able to return.
3.0,"It was a bit uncomfortable and itchy around the face, but worked great in a pinch for the holiday party I needed it for."
3.0,The pants were nice quality in terms of weight and craftsmanship. I noticed out of the package they were staticky. I was in denial and kept them and wore them under a bias cut satin skirt. They clung to the skirt and made the skirt look almost as clingy as wearing no slip. I have pettipants in white from another brand that don't cause cling. Wish I had bought the same ones in black.
3.0,cute but a little small to size
3.0,"I was expecting another bra type but these are okay. I took out the padding and I like the support the shoulder straps constantly fall down for the color pink, white and black. The pink is not a pink at all it’s definitely coral."
3.0,Feels great but the material pills fast making them ugly after one or two wears.
3.0,"The dress was super comfortable, but ran a little big in the shoulders and waste. Length was perfect."
3.0,"Very &#34;blousy&#34;, and actually, too much so."
3.0,"This is the second jacket I've purchased because my son really loves that the fluff goes down through the sleeves, unlike a lot of jackets that only have a smooth lining through the sleeves. Three stars though is because the seams on the previous jacket started coming apart almost immediately, same with this newer purchase. The seams around the pocket zipper on the newest jacket has already had to be repaired. If it weren't for this issue, I would give this jacket 5 stars."
3.0,Small so may not fit well on older adult or big kid.
3.0,"The sweater is very pretty but using their size chart didn't work, it was too small."
3.0,The quality of the tutu was very good but the waist band was too tight and cut in making the layers of tulle stick out in an unflattering way. My waist is 28 inches ish and I ordered the Small/Medium but I think I would've needed the Large... I ended up returning it and going with a different retailer.
3.0,"Check the sizing chart. I am usually a M and had to purchase an XL. Suit is flattering, but does not provide much bust support."
3.0,They’re so cute but stab you a lot and if you wanna go braless with these they get caught on everything so I only wear them on occasion.
3.0,"Fastener is poorly, cheaply made."
3.0,Broke fairly fast:(
3.0,"I got the purple. I love the color. Just as advertised. The issue is nice, but the inside seems cheap and like it may fall apart quickly. It didn't come with The fake fur key chain, which is fine. But the wrist strap is too small to fit over my hand, and it's already taking apart upon arrival. It's only held together by a strand. I won't trust it to be used for anything."
3.0,It's on the smaller side and also sheer.
3.0,Very small and hard to keep pulled up
3.0,you get what you pay for!
3.0,"I got mine today, and honestly I am very happy with the way it looks. However, it is a little too thick for what I'd like, probably for the sound effects (they don't sound like Tennant, and the button is a little too easily pressed). I like the way it functions as a clock, and I am definitely happy with it, although it was priced a bit steeply."
3.0,I bought it to wear it as a long blouse and it works fine for that purpose in my case.
3.0,"It's fine... I bought this to wear as a swim coverup. It is stretchy fabric, almost like swimsuit fabric. The model must be 4'10&#34;. I am 5'4&#34; and it hits me mid thigh. The way it hangs on the model makes it look like the stripes almost form a chevron pattern down the front and sides. Not so... the stripes are straight horizontal. I'm sending it back and ordering an XL to see if I can get a similar drape. Other than that it seems quite well made for the price."
3.0,Definitely will need to order up on the size. It is super cute but ran very small. Much smaller than I would have liked.
3.0,"I've been trying to get more spunky jewelry so I thought this would be a cute addition.<br /><br />I hadn't gotten an ear cuff so I wasn't sure what to expect.<br />I was expecting, however, that the cuff would have some sort of cushion or be rounded off so at least it wouldn't hurt so much when i leave it on.<br />As soon as I'd put it on my ear would feel irritated and turn red. OUCH OUCH!<br />I haven't left it on long enough to wear it out.<br /><br />The jewelry itself is okay, it's cute. A little on the cheap looking side, and the octopus had black jeweled eyes.<br />For me, it didn't cover the whole ear, but hovered over most of it.<br />It's cute, just didn't work out for me."
3.0,"Have had for about 2 weeks. They're ight, cute and breathable but every day another one gets a hole. Would def Not buy again!"
3.0,"I was disappointed in the material, however for the price I guess I should not have expected a high quality leather and with  the color it did not help the quality appearance of the bag.  Size was good and functional I guess I wanted a higher grade product.  You get what you pay for"
3.0,"I’m 5’7 and weigh 110.  Ordered a small, but found the product very large and shapeless.  Material is not bad, but didn’t know it would have such a papery/crepe feeling.  The design itself is good."
3.0,"My boss is recovering from the same breast cancer I had and recommended these shirts for compression to help with my lymphedema. Unfortunately, I ordered my usual size and found them very loose and lightweight—plain old spanx has SO much more compression. This is particularly weird to me because I’m pretty well-endowed and am used to things in my size running a bit tight; you’d think compression garments would be on the tight end, too. Not compressive at all; I’d wear this for a comfortable relaxing or running shirt any day I’m feeling overstimulated, though. Cut seems fine and proportionate and the fabric is nice.<br /><br />Size reference: I ordered L. I’m 5’8, 170lbs, 34FF bra, 31 inch waist.<br /><br />Pros: breathable, lots of color choices, seams aren’t bothersome, has some stretch<br />Cons: lightweight, not too compressive by my standards, runs large"
3.0,Ripped inside pocket the first time I put my phone in it...
3.0,Cute but to bulky
3.0,"Dangling one broke 2nd day, the others are just as shown not my style but for the price i just went for it."
3.0,Beautiful dress however it's  really short and I'm only 5'4 and material is kinda on the cheaper side I had to keep pulling it down but it's great for an emergency like in my case lol
3.0,No arch support but l love the colors!
3.0,"Great sock, but I think the size 13-15 tends to be closer to the 13"
3.0,The belt that came with it didn’t match. Other than that it’s pretty I got a bunch of compliments on it. It’s really thin and you’ll probably want to buy the slip to make it look like a true swing dress.
3.0,"Not at all what iexpected, looks dainty in picture,very heavy,chunky jewlrey,but still pretty"
3.0,Its cute.I recieved it to day. Wear it tomorrow
3.0,"The belt is of good quality, however it runs extremely large. Unfortunately we had to wear them because we didn’t have enough time to exchange them. The gold is hard with an elastic back with metal clips. You can definitely order a size or two down. You can see in the second picture how the belt hung off of my waist."
3.0,Little pink fuzzy button fell of fairly easy and quickly but...ehh
3.0,"This is a pretty neat item--a Roberto Clemente jersey for Puerto Rico WBC (something that didn't exist when the great Clemente played).  It's of good quality, but is flawed as can be clearly seen in the second picture of the item on this page (the one with the front of the jersey).  I can verify this is flawed because the one I ordered has the same issue apparent on the sales page. Unfortunately, the front of the jersey--where the buttons are--has a white strip that interrupts the words Puerto Rico. It's very noticeable and unfortunate, as this is a wonderful jersey in every other way."
3.0,the chest area of the bathing suit is weird.
3.0,"It’s low quality, good for one time use."
3.0,Runs small.  It clung to all of my fat rolls and looked really bad on.  Returned.
3.0,Needed this set for a Christmas pj party. Material was soft and cozy but didn’t last well after multiple washes. The fabric started to pill.
3.0,Pretty colors but not super soft and looks like a lower quality garment.
3.0,Cute shoe; doesn’t look like a steel toe shoe at all but the issue is it runs small.. need at least a 1/2 size bigger.  I wear an 11 and there’s no 111/2 size so I’m returning them.
3.0,"I am 5'3, 150 pounds, 34DDD, 40 inch hips, 30 inch waist.  I purchased a large and it was huge.  Otherwise this is such an adorable dress.  I think it will be perfect for vacation.  The color is beautiful, the material is soft, and the length was a couple inches above my knee but not uncomfortably short.  My bottom was safely covered by the length.  What appears to be two white lines on the dress are areas where the dress is actually open so you can see your skin.  Still very modest and I did not feel it was too revealing in any way.  I might try this in a small size.  I believe it will travel well."
3.0,Ends are too big to fit through holes so can not user them
3.0,"I washed the shirt before I wore it with fabric softener, and it stills gave me a bit of collar burn around my neck.  Maybe a few more washes will do the trick.  Otherwise its a great shirt and easy to iron."
3.0,Not the best quality and it opens where the button is when you sit. But it is easy to nurse in and looks cute.
3.0,"Doesnt fit upper body very well xompared to lower body, otherwise the swinsuit is ok"
3.0,"Arrived as described. Slim fit, almost like boys vs mens pants."
3.0,"I would give it a 4 or even a 5 because the outfit is just so beautiful, but the shorts need to be made of a more flowing fabric like the upper body. I bought a 2X since my bust is extremely large and I have thick thighs, and the only way for the outfit to properly fit is if the shorts go up between my thighs, similarly to how booty-shorts would be worn for example. But this outfit is too classy for something like that so I'm a bit disappointed. Stretchier material please!"
3.0,it does not fit the toy i purchased it for but the cats love them anyway
3.0,I really wanted to like this romper. But it fit me too small. The shorts length is a little to long. I had my 14 yr old daughter try it on. She liked it but the bottom of the shorts need to be cut shorter and hemmed to like pretty. Cutting and hemming if you know how to sew is easy. Or if you know someone that does. This outfit would look nice. But again fit in the mid section to small amd the length of the short is to long even for someone with long legs.
3.0,"Cute glasses, but frames are a bit large for my face...but I have a small shaped face"
3.0,Soft material but not very supportive and fit larger than expected. Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"I ordered a extra large assuming it would shrink, and it didn't.  Will be a night gown now.  :)"
3.0,"As advertised, but I just don't wear it that much. It's a bit too bright and has a cheap feel."
3.0,"Fits well but wear an undershirt, it is see-through."
3.0,"Beautiful bangle bracelet is about all it is good for.  The watch face is TINY! Good quality, heavy piece."
3.0,It's pretty but it makes my finger itch.
3.0,"Read the reviews and ordered 0.5 size smaller. Bad idea. Too small. I would assume 9, as my size, would have fit with light socks. For smth thicker I would actually think 0.5size bigger.<br />Great looking shoe, light! Kinda mix between hiking shoe, duck shoe and cooler weather boot, exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately the fold where tongue is attached to the side (kinda.like webbing so no water gets inside) is so uncomfortable I didn't even put the boot on fully when trying for the first time. Though I left the cardboard inside.<br />Nope, the extra fabric folds, it's tick and no matter which way I position it, it still rubs.<br />No way to be comfortable.<br />I think this is 10th pair of shoes I bought and returned this season. Why nobody makes good, lightweight, semi-hikers that don't have some weird flaws???"
3.0,"Good, but, not as sturdy or functional as the &#34;Bags for LessTM - Gymnast Weather Resistant Travel Duffle.&#34;  Bottom doesn't have a reinforcing insert.  Definitely not as sturdy.  Donated extra to a school rummage sale."
3.0,the straps always have issue and get lopsided.
3.0,"The sun glasses is OK, like it's advertised it's soft with no sharp edges, so it won't hurt the child. And you can bend the frame without breaking it, but the frame is too small for my 5yr old son, it wish it has more sizes. Also the nose piece is too short, so it keep failing."
3.0,"They run really small got them for my girlfriend for her army drill and they didn't even get over her finger, however only upside to this is I'll be able to wear them for my basic training. But I recommend going a whole size up."
3.0,Love the Bracelets but smaller than what normal sizes are so I was a little disappointed. There's 3 different styles which is cool. Overall it's a good product.
3.0,was hoping for a fuller shirt
3.0,"Somehow, it's hard to believe that these masks are almost as good as a KN95... They feel too light and their material feels cheap."
3.0,The setting turns black/rust looking.<br />The stone is beautiful!
3.0,"I loved the cut of the dress, but the fabric of the gray was not the same as the other colors — it wasn’t as soft."
3.0,More yellow than the picture shows and more bulky than I was expecting but this might be a positive fore some buyers. Good value and swift delivery.
3.0,"These are okay at best. I like to wear shorts under skirts and dresses since I have thicker thighs and hate the dreaded chub rub. Unfortunately, while these are a great value the short just aren't up to par. They CONSTANTLY ride up, even when I'm just sitting. I'll wear them occasionally but these are subpar"
3.0,Nice boots but calf is not wide and it took longer to receive than stated.
3.0,"I haven’t had a chance to wear this sweater.  It just came today, I bought it for my trip to GA for Christmas.  I has a snag in it. ☹️"
3.0,It’s a cheap band that may suit your needs. I would have liked a better looking embossed print and heavier stitching. Can’t complain much at this price point.
3.0,"the description said they ran small.  therefore I ordered XXL. It was about as wide as most men's large, and kind of short."
3.0,Looks great but snagged on a lot clothes and even made holes in them until half of the dangle fell off.
3.0,They came as the pic showed
3.0,"Be aware this runs very small. I usually wear a small or medium and ordered a large based on size charts and it still is almost too tight to be wearable. Should have gone for the XL. It's cute, but if it shrinks in the wash (which I suspect it will) it may be no good."
3.0,The band is okay. It's just not wide enough.
3.0,To big in the arm holes and not as distressed as expected
3.0,"Cute glasses. Bigger than expected, but still wear them!"
3.0,The fit is a little odd. A lot more high waisted than expected. Still cute though.
3.0,Fabric thin and runs really small
3.0,"I'm 5'0, 120lbs. This was a big large on me. It looked cute off the shoulder, but if i moved my arms around, the shoulders popped up and then it was around my neck. This might be ok for pool time.. kind of moo-moo ish"
3.0,"This coverup is darling. However, I am a size 12 and 5’6”. It was too small on my. Didn’t even come down over my bum.<br />I gave it to my daughter who is size 4 and it fit perfectly. Absolutely darling !"
3.0,"THE BANDS ARE SHORT, REALLY FOR A BOY CHILD"
3.0,"My son loved these shoes! He absolutely had to have them for school! However, two weeks in they are already fraying by the shoe laces. Not a happy mom esp for what we paid."
3.0,Bought for my son because I needed a bright green polo shirt for an event.  The construction isn't the greatest and the first thing I noticed is that is clearly states on the inner tag to keep away from flames.  This is a children's shirt so I am very disappointed by this.
3.0,"Shirt is not a true 3x, so it is very small and I unable to wear it.  Not sure what the material is, but it's soft and a little stretchy. Overall OK, but if  you want it to fit like a true 3x, then don't buy."
3.0,"I ordered the size I normally wear, sadly they we tight. I kept wearing them to stretch them out. I will keep them as a back up pair for snowmobiling."
3.0,"Granted I have an adult sized masculine head, but these seem like they are sized to fit a small child, not the models in the photos where the hats actually look loose fitting. I tried stretching the hats out over a small bucket but can’t get them to a size that doesn’t squish my head. Wish they came in different sizes."
3.0,"Very comfortable and TTS. As you can see in my pic, the medial end flares up, which drives me nuts. Otherwise I like them. I’m wearing a medium, I’m 145lb 5’4” and it comes lower calf"
3.0,"This dress is SO pretty! I definitely wasn't expecting to love it as much as I do, especially given what I paid for it. I'm so excited to wear it!<br /><br />2/16/18 UPDATE: I took it to the dry cleaners and the little polka dots fell off! My dry cleaners said he had never had that happen. Had to return<br /><br />I'm 5'7 137 pounds and got a small"
3.0,The sizing is small. Order a couple sizes up.
3.0,"The fabric in description stated ""light & breezy"" and in picture appears t shirt, while it looks like the item , what I received was a waffle thermal. Regardless will keep because it's gotten chilly. The bottoms fit perfect but the top is a bit tight. The logo is embroidered.  I also got another version of pjs from the company which I love and are more as described, perfect fit and super comfy but logo is cheap iron on that flakes off before even washing."
3.0,"They are pretty comfortable, but they run a size small. Good price, may get another pair in the proper size"
3.0,I loved the hat it just didn't fit my head the way I like. It did make a great gift so WIN!
3.0,"I bought this for a beach trip. I figured it would be a cute outfit to hang around he house in. I usually wear a size 10 and I ordered a large. It fit fine, not too tight or too loose, but I feel like the cut was different than featured on the model. I’m only 5’6 and it was very short, like above ankle length. I wasn’t planning to wear shoes with it, but it would have looked weird if I did. It ended up looking like a fancy pair of pajamas."
3.0,"Somewhat small even going up a size. Ordered an XL considering it’s Asian sized. Good material, consider ordering 2 sizes up. Unless you like them snug"
3.0,like it but takes time to tie it and have the nice look on my wrist
3.0,Has a small hole in it already.
3.0,A little smaller than I was expecting
3.0,"Nice, a little to small"
3.0,Nice sturdy band.  Good width and length. Adjustable.  The “free” face cover was missing from the order.  Had to order it separately.
3.0,Pink seams can be seen.Its not too bad
3.0,They ride
3.0,They are much smaller and lighter metal than expected.  They are just okay.
3.0,"Very cute but likely to break, at some point. The rear part of the loop is quite thin and bends easily, so I'm sure not to sleep in them. They also do not come with backs, so if you wear them without security, there's definitely a chance of losing them."
3.0,"I like the top but it runs small and I did not see that begore I bought it or I would have ordered a Large.  I never wear a large, usually a Medium or a Small.  The Medium fits like a small and the arm length just barely works.  I would have returned it, but I didnt see free returns so I'm just keeping it."
3.0,Variedad de colores
3.0,"I live on a farm that has quite a bit of woodlands on it.  I will often go out in the woods to get firewood, hike, or hunt.  So fleece-lined camo pants seemed like a good idea.  These pants came and I have to admit that I was underwhelmed.  I saw some other folks were having issues with sizing so I ordered a size larger than I usually get.  The length is right, the waist is right but the legs are tight.  Sort of form fitted.  Not so great for moving around.  The outer material seems like typical camo pants. Although I noticed there were loose threads all over the place.  The fleece liner reminds me of the inside of a sweatshirt.  As far as keeping my legs warm, they did a fine job.  It hasn't been terribly cold but cold enough and these pants worked just fine for walking in the woods.  I just wish the fit were a little looser in the legs because it felt like they restricted my movement.  The pockets had stitches through the opening to keep them closed.  They were easy enough to break open but it seemed like the pants would be easy to rip a stitch on.  These pants are nothing special but if you don't have a special need, they just might work (assuming you have skinny legs).  I'm not sure I would buy another pair.  I received this product for free or discount in exchange for my honest review. Thanks for reading."
3.0,Cute dress but fits much looser than it appeared in the picture
3.0,"These are pretty shirts, but the fabric is much cheaper than I thought it would be. At least they were cheap and my daughter loves the graphics."
3.0,"Las sandalias son bonitas y de buena calidad,  pero Pedí talla 36 y me llego talla 37 tuve que devolverlos porque me quedan grandes  y volver a pedirlos espero me lleguen esta vez la talla correcta"
3.0,"This works for the outfit, & the price is right"
3.0,I did not like the design at all. The flag  colors weren't colorful enough to take notice of the flags.
3.0,"Product seems well stitched with quality material. Very lightweight and feels breathable with soft, comfortable waistband. The front pouch, though it looks snug, fits fine since the material is stretchy but the fabric over the buttocks was much too large and caused the entire thing to ride up very high. I have a slim-athletic build and normally wear either a medium or large or a size 32 in most underwear brands. I am considering ordering a medium now that I have returned the large."
3.0,Originally I had bought loop bands for my Apple watch made by Amband but it looks like they've become discontinued. I bought these and hoped they would be the same but quality wasn't even close. The plastic piece that slides into your watch face is not a tight fit and looks cheap. Although it wiggles where attached it has not fallen out...
3.0,"Super comfortable, but it was larger than I was expecting. Not a big deal since it's just a cover up."
3.0,Very cute and a little longer in person which is a good thing.
3.0,"I was disappointed that it is shorter and hangs looser than I thought. Fabric is soft, very thin, but not crazy about the fit."
3.0,They were too heavy for me to be worn. Sad because I really liked the way they looked (although they were bigger than what I thought they were going to be).
3.0,"The fit was a little smaller than expected, I ordered an XL"
3.0,They are really cute shoes just way to big for my daughter.
3.0,The XL fit my daughter who wears a 9/10 so they went home with her. 😢
3.0,"I have really small wrist, the bracelet is great but just to big for me."
3.0,"The pearl letter is cute and really makes a statement. However, the chain is very bright and cheap looking. The color is off as well- closer to a rose gold color."
3.0,"Didn’t like the material, had a funny smell. I return it"
3.0,The quality and material was great and I really wanted to like it. After putting it on it was very itchy and uncomfortable.
3.0,"I bought two pair. They fit fine. Feel very ""soft"", not like compression shorts. One might like these shorts if you don't like the feel of compression shorts. They're more like wearing swim trunks with that built in sorta-jock.<br /><br />The junk holder gizmo does what it's supposed to do. But so does the gizmo in lots of support or compression shorts. I'll stick with the  Russell athletic shorts. I get about six pair of those for the cost of one pair of these Ballpark's.<br /><br />For me, underwear dies because the elastic gets old. About once a year I throw out a few pair that have stretched to beyond the circumference of my buttuski. It's easier to throw out an eight dollar pair of shorts than it is a fifty dollar pair. So as long as they both corral the kids, I'll take the less expensive option."
3.0,"I agree with the negative reviews - it is not the best quality fabric, and the liner is sewed inside out.  I got the large and find it a little tight through the empire waist.  The zipper is hard to zip up and down.  However, it looks good on and should work great for the wedding i am going to so I am keeping it.  It is a really pretty dress.  And you can't beat the price."
3.0,"I've gotten so many compliments on this dress! Love the pockets too! However, dress came with a long black streak that won't come out. Thankfully it's on the back and (almost) blends in with the pattern. Wish I would have inspected it closer when it arrived."
3.0,"No matter how hard I tried, I could not get this dress to fit right. I tried crossing it several times just like the pictures but when I did the fabric with fold and there was way too much of my bust showing"
3.0,"It's really cute. But the material is thin and see through. It's also HUGE. I ordered a size 0-6 month as my baby is really tiny. But what I got in the mail could fit a 2+ year old. I will just have to wait until it fits, which is fine. Just would have liked the sizing to be correct."
3.0,"I got this to replace RipCurl Ocean Search ATS-quartz (leaked after 3rd battery replacement in 6years-still works, cant take in water anymore).<br />Glancing at the watches: RipCurl Tide, Time, Date are much easier to read. Nixon Date and Tide Tables are very difficult to read.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- There should be a LARGE FONT setting for the Nixon - much displayed info. (date, surf session timer, TIDE, etc.) very tiny to read<br />- No general stop watch with lap timer (RipCurl has this) - a no-brainer for a digital watch, especially at $270<br />- Alarm is only settable once. each time you want to use it (for example every morning), you need to set it again<br />- Session timer is just a 1-use stopwatch<br />- Heat timer is a settable egg timer, or countdown timer. Most surfers do not compete in heats - this feature could be part of a richer stopwatch<br />- Alarm and beeps are not loud . . . you might miss a countdown timer going off in the water - you will for sure if it's under your wetsuit sleeve.<br />- Would rather see TIDE prominently displayed instead of wave height. Wave height is important once (not so much once you are in the water).Tide is important constantly.<br />- Have to send in to have battery changed; although it looks like you can do it yourself with a small philips head<br />- Missed opportunity to have the iOS app handle more than just the surfline synch (e.g. watch setup, change watch settings/configuration, update watch with new features, etc)<br />- The nightlight is very faint (compared to the RipCurl)<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Surfline details are nice, but small (water temp, wind, swell direction, wave height) - all things not available on the RipCurl<br />- easy to 'browse' from spot to spot (Setting up the RipCurl with more than 1 tide spot is cumbersome, complex)<br />- Easy (Surfline) synch with phone (sorry, Android users, I hear ya)<br />- Tide table for today/tomorrow is the right idea, (but font is too too small) - i find myself using the tide tables on surfline or Nixon app more.<br />- The Nixon iOS app is nice and clean - easier to use and READ than the info on the watch<br />- watch band is nice. More comfortable than the RipCurl<br /><br />Neutral:<br />Surf Session Timer(1) - this is 1X stop-watch (no laptimer) you start it, and when you stop it you can either save the session (and the time), or restart<br />Surf Session Timer(2) - There is lots of room on this stop-watch screen to make it BIGGER - too bad it's so tiny.<br />Surf Session Timer(3) - wave counter. this is set up like a turnstyle counter, every time you catch a wave you press a button and the count goes up by 1<br />Surf Session Timer(4) - you can save your sessions (times+Wave counts). This is geared towards people who might use strava or fitbit bands . . . not me, so i dont use it.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Nixon got a lot of things right here, and you can see it in the iOS app - now if they can execute on the watch (large font please - or at least option to configure) + add a few normal digital watch features so I don't need 2 watches; that would be great! If you REALLY love Surfline details, and don't need reading glasses, this could be the watch for you.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />I criticize the small font/type for much of this review. I do have reading glasses, but my prescription is pretty weak (1X in one eye only)"
3.0,This top is MUCH larger than I anticipated. I got it for lounging around the house so I kept it but definitely don't size up.
3.0,Cute shirt but not tapered at the waist like the picture.
3.0,Dress is very thin and see through. It didn’t meet my expectations. Had it been thicker material this would’ve been a beautiful dress. Returned item for refund.
3.0,The style is not attractive.
3.0,These acrylic practice fingers work great for practicing but you have to be careful to use non acetone nail polish remover to clean them before each new use.
3.0,"Wasnt bad, daughter had it destroyed after two washes. Decent quality. Would not buy it again. Would maybe recommend it."
3.0,"Good looking glasses, the frame fits to loosely. Will be returning."
3.0,"Nothing Special, not terrible. It is very basic. It is what it is"
3.0,"This is an OK belt.  I purchased a black 5.11 tactical trainer belt at the same time.  The Bison belt will do the job, but I would recommend the 5.11 tactical trainer belt over this Bison belt."
3.0,"I love the look of these, they're really pretty. But the entire design, the front and dangle piece, broke off after two weeks. I was really disappointed. Probably only good for a one-time event and then switch to a different pair."
3.0,"The insides are silky and comfy but far from making your feet ""hot"". Looks like I'm buying a heater..."
3.0,It was too big. Not true to size
3.0,"Super soft material, however a little smaller than what I would have preferred! The colors are fantastic"
3.0,"These are pretty, but I do not believe that they are all real gemstones.  When I used rubbing alcohol on, prior to wearing them for the first time, one of the top stones bled dark blue."
3.0,"I ordered these in a large, but the sizing is definitely more of a youth large, not a men's large. Keeping them as my younger son will grow into them, but will not find the intended person."
3.0,All for looks but definitely isn’t something I would personally buy again!
3.0,"Super cool looking but a little warm due to material it is made out of.  Its like a shinny silky material...kind of breathable but not totally. It looks great, just wish it was not shinny.  I will keep it as I ride motorcyles and it will be a great addition."
3.0,Very thin material. Cotton doesn't stretch at all. Buy one size bigger like the reviews say. But it's cute on .
3.0,The outfit is not bad but the pants are very big in comparison to the top and it stretches more threw  the day over it’s nice but you get what you paid for
3.0,Not worth it tbh. It’s too small and tight. Some are too loose and fall just by removing your AirPods. Would not recommend as some of them even came missing
3.0,still looks good when I wear it!!
3.0,*Shipped quickly<br />*Recognizable HP product<br />*Inexpensive and cute gift<br />*Impressed my HP fan<br />*Don't get this wet
3.0,The dress was beautiful but too small.
3.0,They are really pretty. My daughter loves them but she has metal sensitivity so they do bother her skin some. They are for fashion she has real gold nose hoops to wear at night.
3.0,4 months and unusable tears
3.0,"It's cheap so I wasn't expecting greatness, but its still disappointing. I typically wear a medium and while I don't have tiny bird arms I am not a very big human in general. The upper arm portion of the sleeves on this were very tight, to the point that if I tried to put both arms in front of me I would probably tear it at the seams. It is quite obviously not cut the same as the one the model is wearing in the product pic.<br /><br />The color is nice, the fabric is light and airy but keep in mind it has ZERO stretch and the stitching isn't the best."
3.0,"i like the fabric, but the neckline was way lower than expected - and way too low for me."
3.0,"This jacket has little to no stretch. The quality is good - really good considering the price. I ordered a 2xl, when I usually wear a L or XL. The arms of the jacket were surprisingly tight for the size. A little stretch would have been nice."
3.0,"Pretty necklace, but already discolored. Cheap metal, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"The good news is that it fits well overall, my daughter who is very sensitive about clothing says it was comfortable, however it is too long to be a short dress but too casual looking for a long dressy dress. It's also too short to be a long maxi, which sort of leaves us asking what this would be appropriate to wear for. It's a nice robe/lounge around the house outfit, but I don't think that's what it was intended for. Not sure I would recommend it but maybe someone wants something with this fit."
3.0,"The stripes are not a large as the picture shows, they are slimmer. It fit me well, though the sizing is way off. I usually take a small and sometimes extra small women's size, and I ordered an XL by mistake. It does NOT fit like an XL. More like a women's medium or even small. Cute top, but didn't like it enough to keep."
3.0,I always like a surplus style dress but this one was disappointing. The fabric was very rough and the sleeves were oddly long. I returned it.
3.0,Looking for a better material
3.0,The plastic part it is broke after a month and its upsetting me!!!!!
3.0,Hard to review it thoroughly until I use it hunting which won't be until next year. I do like that it has a removable liner.
3.0,The shorts are way too large and are not elastic so my son cannot wear them. The tank top is very cute and functional though.
3.0,Not as cute as i thought it was going to be on me.
3.0,"I would love it, if it fit better on top.  Way too small in the breast area."
3.0,Just what I was looking  for  but hard to shape.
3.0,Loved them execrations they had a hole in one week. They were more velvety than expected so always collected fuzz
3.0,"Here is the review from my 8-year old whom is the watch for.<br />He gave it 3-star (i.e., Its okay) because the watch belt broke when his 5-year old sister accidentally stepped on it. Although it is an accident, we thought it is a bit fragile. The good news is that the all-might daddy fixed it using glue. So it still works just fine."
3.0,The chest to waist ratio is off. The waist is too loose. I normally wear a medium t shirt and went small on these.  The chest and shoulders fit right but the waist is kinda loose.
3.0,The skirt is no where near as full as the picture shows.
3.0,Like them fit nicely.
3.0,"I wanted to love these so much. They were gifts for my family members and mine fell apart within the second week of use. I’m so sad, they looked so cute but just hit study enough for daily use."
3.0,It is ok it feels too tight around the neck.  Tighter than the picture shows it.
3.0,"Received the amount as promised; however, there were 5 I had to throw away, because they were already turned on and batteries were dead. In addition it does fly fully light up, only in the area in which the on/off switch is."
3.0,ordered wrong size by mistake
3.0,I got myself mediums and my boyfriend a large-- one of the pockets on mine are messed up for some reason. Larges fit okay on my boyfriend-- kind of short though (he's 5'11&#34;). Mediums fit me okay-- I'm 5'3&#34;.
3.0,Nice looking but too small. I’m a 32/33 waist and ordered a Large but probably needed XXL.
3.0,"I did not like the material, it was also too small.  I actually seen this on someone in person however with a much smaller frame and it looked nice on that person."
3.0,"The gold button seemed a little cheap for this outfit. The fabric did not feel super quality, and despite ordering true to size the outer fabric fit more loosely. I wanted a sleek blazer jumpsuit feel, but unfortunately this felt frumpy and I’m not sure I can remedy it."
3.0,"I ordered this bracelet because I thought is was black but its brown.  Its cute, but I wanted black.  Oh well!  Should specify the color in the description better!"
3.0,I love the way these look - like an old cable knit sweater.  But they did stretch out pretty quickly. I have small hands so they are kind &#34;baggy&#34; on my hands but I still wear them around the house and over my hands while reading.
3.0,Pretty colors but does run small.
3.0,The furry part on one of the ears was already peeled....super glue or fabric glue can fix. But for being  brand new disappointed.
3.0,Quality tulle but too much of it. I am 5' 1 and even when I wear it up to my bust it still drags greatly. I have to make alterations to it just to get it to look some what okay.
3.0,"The top is too big I ordered XS  (5’5 117lbs). I did like the fit too much, it wasn't snug and the sleeves were not fitting my shoulders properly"
3.0,Received a pair of same pjs for Christmas- loved them so much I ordered the exact same pair-- top too tight-- pjs are really soft.
3.0,"Very cute suit, looks exactly like the pictures and seems to be made of good quality fabric but it is not made for women with a small chest... too much room in the cups even with the padded cups in."
3.0,i am 9 months pregnant and purchased a large and extra large fits like a shirt at this point probably fit better in length after i lose weight i think this runs small but i am not used to being 200lbs so i might be wrong i usually weigh 135lb but i would purchase a medium if i still weighed 135lbs.i am not expecting it  to be long enough barely covers my butt fits as a very cute shirt i would say the material isnt the softest either  not scratchy at all but chiffon it dosent fell like
3.0,Does not quite fit properly in the bottom area.  Otherwise is very nice
3.0,"This dress is cute, but material is cheap and has a young girl look to the cut and design"
3.0,Run BIG......
3.0,The bottoms fit perfectly but the top was way too small
3.0,Once on terrific but to put them on takes all strength until get over the heel then easy to pull up.
3.0,"Every time I put anything in the pockets it would pull down so that it tightened at the throat. I tried a light balanced load of 2 chapsticks in each pocket and still it did this. I tried vaccine card, ID, and credit card in one pocket and chap stick in the other and still this was an issue."
3.0,I sized up one size for the shirt. I could’ve gone up two more sizes. It is very tight.
3.0,"Not a very good bikini, feels like a prototype to the real bikini, bottoms are completely useless, the ruffles go to far and the seam around the legs is embarrassing. Will not wear the bottoms. The top had an entire different piece sown into the back which is just a single layer compared to the rest in double layer. Top is ok, but I doubt it will make it past one season of summer."
3.0,The boots have a hard piece of material on the top of the boot that is poping out and pokes my leg. I need to put long socks to avoid the irritation of the skin. Other than that I like them a lot.
3.0,"I bought 2 sets of these, one in 4t for my youngest, and one in 5t for my oldest, since most people said they fit as expected.  Sadly for us, the 5t was huge on my oldest. The 4t fit ok on my youngest but still looked a bit big.  The shorts are super long and fall way below the knee on my boys, unlike the picture, and they look huge. We were able to make it work for pictures but I'd size down next time.  The outfit itself seems well made and is very cute."
3.0,Just ok. I got these because I had read they were not see through in the black color. But they very much are. Will not be wearing them outside of the house. Disappointed.
3.0,This suit is kinda awkward.. the bottoms are itty bitty.... I’m 118 pounds and 5’3 and they were still super small. The top fit strangely as well.
3.0,I ordered the clear with red sides as pictures as the only color option. They sent me black with day glow lime green...horrible. The fit is great but they are for sure not women's
3.0,I had to pin down the side that crosses the chest because it wouldn't stay. But an overall good fit
3.0,"Ordered the kids size 1-1.5 for my daughter who normally wears a size 13 up to a size 1. These seemed small, so I held them up to a pair of her flip-flops. The soles were exactly the same length as a size 11-12 flip flop that she'd already outgrown."
3.0,I need the xxxl size. Be careful dont dry these socks in the dryer. They shrink.
3.0,"I love these earrings, so much that I've been wearing them pretty consistently, and unfortunately it looks like they've rusted. I'm disappointed but they're cheap enough to be worth it, just maybe for occasional use only."
3.0,need to consider half size because of the zipper
3.0,"I have a lot of Fair Indigo tees, and like them, this is a great t-shirt. However, this drab lavender color has proven unflattering to my skin tone and hard for me to pair with other colors."
3.0,Like all the slots for my cards. Don’t really like the material much. It looks and feels cheep.
3.0,Had some Sharp edges where you put it on your finger head to Sandown
3.0,It does not have much space inside. It's flatter than expected
3.0,cute but it makes a weird shape in the back when you wear it
3.0,"For a knock-off of a Killstar sweater, it's decent. It's not as long and very itchy, but I bought it to hold me over until I can get the Killstar one. The original is 50ish bucks, so you can see why I got this one for now... Also, the material, besides feeling like steel wool, is very flimsy and you have to be careful with it. Just putting it on made it come undone in some spots.<br />I think this one would be cute for Halloween or something, but it's just not for me."
3.0,I ordered this for my daughter who wears a women’s small but it was WAY too big. Ended up cutting off the ears and tail and reattached to brown sweatsuit for a costume that fit her.
3.0,"Cute, but not as pictured. The frames are a mottled red and white instead of all red and the lenses are a completely different color. Kind of a bummer, because I ordered these because they reminded me of my grandma. The ones I got are cool, but don't have the nostalgia factor I ordered them for. Also, the case that comes with them is super small and it's hard to get the glasses to go back in after the first time you take them out. Probably not worth what I spent on them unfortunately."
3.0,It’s a lot shorter than the picture but still great
3.0,Nice bracelets but got one where the elastic band was already broken.
3.0,"The top is great, fits perfect and comfy! Bottoms are a bit small in the butt"
3.0,I like the material but they are a little big on my 6.5 foot. They bunch up in the back and slide off
3.0,Not as well fit as the image
3.0,Bought for daughter to wear under her Halloween costume. She loved it. I felt it was a little high cut In the legs other than that definitely worth the price
3.0,"It lists shirts among the clothing items these work with. They would be fine with pants or coats, but not for shirts. The loop is far too large to hold on to the button on a shirt collar."
3.0,These are ok for one occasion.
3.0,"Nice watch , little small for my taste thought would be larger"
3.0,The last time I ordered one of these it came with two filters. This mask has a pocket for a replaceable filter but this time it didn't come with any. Therefore I am giving it 3 stars.
3.0,Bought this as a possible flower girl dress<br />looked at it on 3 different screens to make sure color would  match but it's way different than shown. Screen colors taken into account this is still not close to the color shown in my opinion. (Pink)
3.0,These sunglasses are rather small and look quite cheap.  The color is also very dull.
3.0,"After the initial adjustment period, I was floating on a cloud of happiness over these shoes.  I could work my sales floor job in comfort and without tight muscles once I took them off after work.  I didn't even need my orthotics when wearing them, even after my 20+ year history of bone spurs, plantar fasciitis, ""trick"" (weak) ankles, etc.  [Note: I don't recommend going without orthotics; it just kind of happened with me.]<br /><br />Despite these physical issues, I am VERY easy on shoes.  Here in the SoCal desert climate, shoe materials break down long before I wear shoes out.  So I was all pretty devastated when, after being on medical leave for a few months, the shoe materials had completely broken down after only five months of use and four months of non-use.  I didn't realize this at the time I purchased the white version of these to wear outside of work before I returned to work after medical leave.  The sole platform of the white ones wore out in just a few months of intermittent use, and now the soles don't hold up to even my orthotics.<br /><br />I originally purchased these because a co-worker had had her G-Defy shoes for four years.  Still wears them, actually.  Makes me think the company started using cheaper materials.<br /><br />I thought I'd found my kismet shoe company.  I'm heartbroken."
3.0,"While this is cute and fits well, the fabric is weak and is easily damaged."
3.0,"5’3, 150 ish pounds. I typically wear a size 8/10, I bought a 12 and it was the right size.<br /><br />I liked how it looked from the side and back but felt like the sleeves hit at a weird place and made me look oddly wide from the front. I returned it.<br /><br />The dress was well made, heavier material and good quality for the price."
3.0,These leggings are thin but not in a good way. They’re the type of thin that shows every ripple or cellulite or imperfection in your body. Would not buy again.
3.0,It was to small in the hip area and to big in the chest area
3.0,They don't fit my foot correctly
3.0,"It was great until I washed it and shrunk so much, sad day."
3.0,"The colors were perfect for my golf bag, but the towel didn't have a grommet to hang on my bag which works<br />better than having to get it out of one of the pouches. I want it handy when I'm golfing."
3.0,Runs way smaller
3.0,The elastic waist band rolls which I don't care for. The material feels silky and is a bit thin. My stubby leg hair catches the material. So make sure you have shaved before you put these on. If the waist band didn't roll I would be able to give it a higher rating.
3.0,"This does run a tad big, it's very adorable. However, I didn't rate it a 5 star because the 1st wash on delicate cycle and the bow fell off. Also, washed in cold and the blue ran onto the ivory. Other then that I'm fixing the bow and using this for pictures."
3.0,It not mesh at all which I'm okay with but the pouch is a  small
3.0,"It's very pretty.  Good size too.  I love it but it felt out while I was trying to make it flat (not sticking the thread out)  I glued it back, no problem.  That's why I gave it 3 stars for quality workmanship!"
3.0,"There were seam irregularities and the cuffs are way too big, not at all like the first Joe's sweatshirt I ordered. I'm a little disappointed in this purchase and would return for a replacement if I had purchased from a brick and mortar store."
3.0,"The description of this sweater says pink, but in reality it’s peach. It’s still pretty, however is very thin and see through. My wife has mixed emotions about this sweater as it looks nice, however the quality doesn’t seem all there as it feels like it will start falling apart after a few washes. It’s not the softest fabric either, it’s a bit rough. Fits perfectly though and runs true to size."
3.0,All good other than 1 tablecloth had slices in it like a razor was used.  Luckily all we needed was 1.  Very cute otherwise for kids birthday!
3.0,Looks cheap. Not the look I was going for
3.0,I super duper wanted to love this vest. I washed it once and it immediately pilled. I would love to give it another go with a brand new vest and NOT put it in the dryer. Once it was so pilly I wouldn't wear it. The initial wear was great though.
3.0,I was excited for this dress to come. It came super fast. It is a little tight in the arms which  was disappointing. I ordered according. It will fit my daughter though. Light weight. Soft.
3.0,These are sturdier than other inexpensive rings I have tried. I bought these because of a few if the designs but will probably wear all of them. The largest one is very solid.
3.0,Expected better metal quality but described well in description
3.0,I got 6 of theses for my groomsmen gift and wood burned there names on the back. The only down side is that the back is plastic which made it very hard.
3.0,"A money belt is essential for traveling in Europe. I bought this one because I loved the design and also wanted to update to a RFID blocking belt. I didn't realize until the day before my flight, that this belt has buckles in 2 spots in the back that in my opinion, make it much easier to see that I am wearing a belt under my clothing. I liked all the containers and the other features but I think this aspect needs to be revised for a more discreet money belt."
3.0,This is one of the most disapointing items I haveever bought on line.
3.0,"If anyone could make a strapless bra that fit and was comfortable, they would make a fortune!  I have tried everything, and thought this looked soft and comfortable, so ordered it. I am 5'4"" and usually wear a 36B in a regular bra (smaller with strapless to keep it up). I ordered the small.  While this is soft, it is really too large and doesn't want to stay up. The padding is odd and keeps folding up inside the bra, and while it offers coverage, it doesn't offer any support or lift (and I am not overly blessed by the cleavage fairy, if you know what I mean) If you want something soft that gives a bit of coverage, this would be fine, but if you are busty and want some lift and support, this will not be helpful at all, and keep in mind it runs big."
3.0,"I really wanted to like these pants, and at first I thought they fit nicely and were very comfortable. Unfortunately, I soon realized that the waist is too loose. As soon as you try and place an iPhone and car keys into the pockets, the pants fell down. The drawstring is difficult to make tight. I just couldn't get it so that they stayed up. So I personally won't be wearing these pants, and I can't recommend them."
3.0,They squeak when wet which is fine but a little bothersome late at night. But quick drying and I’ve never slipped in them!
3.0,The socks only reach mid calf and easily roll down
3.0,Very good price not the best quality. It's worth what your paying for it.
3.0,I returned it. It was a lotta boob. Otherwise the quality was fine.
3.0,Nice quality just a lil wider than I expected.
3.0,"They’re some pretty awesome earrings, not gonna lie, especially because I work for Buffalo Wild Wings, but one pair broke before I could even wear them and the other most fell out of my ear literally 1 minute ago. So I’m going to super glue it and see if it works because they were a gift from my partner and I really really love them. I’m just disappointed. Still 3 stars for the design and the feel tho 👍🏿"
3.0,"I tried to order based on comments and fit information and it was too big. Also, the fabric is kind of stiff. Not sure I would have liked it anyway. Returning it for something different."
3.0,You get what you pay for with these. Not as good as name brand but will do the job to say the least.
3.0,"I normally wear medium, should have got a size up."
3.0,"Cute, but totally crooked. Those little monkey faces end up on the side."
3.0,"I was disappointed in the size of this, I take a size 14 and where this was not a tight fit it was not the loose fit I expected, Nor was the length what I expected. The picture has it fall mid thigh on me it was just below my tush. Just for information my height is 5'6."
3.0,"It's described as seamless. I bought it because of that, but it's not. The quality is really good though."
3.0,"This came very tangled and not to mention slightly broken. It was easy to put back together, but it did take me a few tries. After that though, it's super cute! This is a great choker if you want to wear something fancy but also need an excuse to wear a choker. The only thing I didn't like was the chain in the back because it hung down a bit awkwardly. Thankfully my hair covered it, but if it had been shorter that would be nice."
3.0,I thought it would be heavier material but it’s basically a long sleeved tee.  Not impressed.
3.0,"super soft. super cute. i got the current mood halloween pumpkin crop top. ordered a large since i think it fits more like a medium. hit me a little above my belly button. im 4' 11, 125 pounds (so realized it says ourrent mood instead of current mood so i’m updating my review) irritating. going to research how to change the O to a C since i’m too lazy to send it back"
3.0,"It is a very cute outfit, skirt is much smaller, ordered 12-18 months fits my 5 month old seems to be better made though. Onesie (top) is very visibly way bigger than size ordered, the button on the bow is barely attached and will need to be removed to avoid choking, and the snaps are cheap plastic so probably will not last long."
3.0,I ordered large because I like have some room to lounge in pants but these were extra long (I’m 5’2”) and they’re bunch up at the bottom. Also disappointed they’re not fleece lined for being advertised as sweatpants. They’re like lightweight joggers. Not what I was looking for..
3.0,"My daughter had a cat dress that had this pattern 2 sizes ago.  When I ordered this dress according to the reviews and size guide, the dress was too small.  It fit (although tightly), but the seam between the skirt and shirt part was waay too high.  It looked like a baby doll cut.  But, because I knew she wanted to wear it, I went back and ordered a size up.  That one fits, but the arm holes are too loose.  She's 5 so of course that's fine, but that only gets 3 stars."
3.0,Top fits fine..bottoms run small.
3.0,"Very cute for the price, but the smell is awful.  I am airing it out, hope it helps."
3.0,This is more GOLD colored than ROSE gold.
3.0,Nice hat but kinda small
3.0,Size down for gym use.The fitted ones worked better for me but also size down.
3.0,"I love this ring, don't get me wrong. I bought it thinking it was adjustable since my fingers are tiny. My thumb is a 7. My grandfather had to use a vice grip to tighten it to fit my middle finger, which is an 8. So be warned!<br /><br />I don't take it off much. Does not discolor your finger, but the black color wore off quick."
3.0,it's very cheap
3.0,"The bra fits pretty well but the straps, where they loop through the plastic, move out of place when you move and they squeak."
3.0,HAD TO RETURN THEY DID NOT FIT MY WATCH
3.0,Cute but poor quality. Good for the price paid.
3.0,Gold one will obviously change colors quickly but still cool.
3.0,"Spacious,  nice design,  but cheap looking and feeling"
3.0,This outfit was very nice but material too thick for hot summer days
3.0,"So I returned and got an XXL, which was a little too big.  Cute top though."
3.0,I bought this because of the bright red color that the pictured showed.<br />It is more like purple and is not as nice as the picture shows. Haven’t had it long enough to know about the time keeping yet. But the picture makes it look nicer than it is
3.0,Cute but not as functional as hoped..
3.0,Cute chains. Fade after a few wears. Good quality. Some do tangle and the bothers me.
3.0,This dress is cute but the zipper is not smooth.  I almost could not get it off.  It is true to size.  Soft and light.
3.0,"The dress is cute, but the sleeves are weird and way too long, I had to alter it. The dress itself is short but fit large shoulder to shoulder"
3.0,Waist is too lo low for my y larger body
3.0,i did not like these. they are a little smaller than expected. the laces look like actual cloth shoe laces. makes it look really cheap. not very stretchy either. I wear a 12/14 and ordered an xl.
3.0,Have trouble keeping it in place with the small area of teeth to hold it.
3.0,Like the concept but the length was off .Definitely  not 17 inches on regular option. More like 15 1/2 inches.
3.0,Love the style but they are a little flimsy.
3.0,This was a party favor for my daughter's bday. The rings that actually worked was great. I had about 10 of them that actually wouldn't light up.
3.0,Great shoe but if u have a wide foot at all these will not work to even squeeze your foot in. I can usually wear a shoe that is not wide but these are very narrow. I'm size 11
3.0,"The color is deceiving. I thought that the jeans were more of a bright pink not Coral. The price was okay, therefore, I decided to keep because of the price."
3.0,They don't fit as expected.  Runs very small.
3.0,"It's not nearly as cool looking in person. The bottom half is also very large. I am bottom heavy, and the bottom was still too wide for me. The top part fit."
3.0,Not as hearty as the white ones I bought from honest company but my three year old can’t really break them either. I’m pleased because they are lightweight but won’t fit anyone older than a toddler.
3.0,"its pretty but VERY thin material so be warned, will wear it though. needs a bra underneath LOL."
3.0,Luggage arrived on time and was pleasantly surprised by pretty color and being lightweight.  Wheels worked well and was easy to transport.  Top handle broke off when I picked it up at baggage return. Bag was not over packed or over 50 lbs fully packed.  Side also was dented.  Am returning it for a replacement.
3.0,Not really a Roman Reigns fan. Only got the shirt because of the design.<br />One of the best designed WWE shirts in 2018.<br />The design is awesome. It’s a dog with red eyes. The screen print isn’t thick which I prefer.<br />The things I don’t like. Shirt material is that thick and heavy cotton. I knew this before purchasing but I got one anyway. Fit wise on the larger size for a XL somewhere between a XL and 2x.  For me just a tad too big. It’s a quality shirt only gave it a 3/5 due to the material and fit. On the plus side these shirts (with thick and heavy cotton) hold up well and last.
3.0,I think on someone else this might be cute but on me it fit weird. Could be super cute on someone else
3.0,"I unfortunately don’t recommend this one unless you are thin and up size. I ordered this in my usual size and the breast area is too tight and straps are too short. It’s an awkward fit, tight on top and fitted flare towards bottom. It also has a weird stitching going down the middle that I think makes it look cheap."
3.0,Pros- so cute! My daughter got tons of compliments and looked adorable. They seem decently made and comfortable.<br /><br />Cons- extremely inconsistent sizing. I got the extra small for my 18 month old (size 5 shoe) and there are 3 different sizes in my pack. They are all labeled extra small but are clearly not all the same size.<br /><br />I am keeping them since she can wear the smaller 2 sizes and grow into the larger one but it is frustrating that she can't wear them all.
3.0,"The only bad thing is the writing is not embroidered. The actual cap isn't bad nor good, it's a regular cap."
3.0,Dress was kinda hard to get into. It's not super stretchy but just enough to have some wiggle room. I expected it to be more stretchy with the design of the dress. Giving it 3 stars because of stretch problems with the neckline/arm hole. It's cute once you get passed that and matches the look as displayed on picture. Reccomend but be prepared to work a little to get your arm in.
3.0,The bottoms fit perfectly and so did the band of the top but the cup was huge. I tried to tie the front as tight as I could but it was still too large 🙁
3.0,FEELS GREAT!!!😄<br /><br />THANKS!!!
3.0,"I like this dress but it is very snug. It is suppose to fit that way but if you have any curves or don’t like such a snug fit order a size up. I read the reviews and chose to order my actual size which is too tight. I’m 5’0ft. 129lbs, chest 36B, I ordered a medium-wish I ordered a large. It seems well made, the inside is soft, cute dress for travel"
3.0,"Definitely 100% polyester, and the print's undeniably different from the model's kimono..but its still okay. Ill still wear. I just thought it would be higher quality"
3.0,"Stretch out way too quickly. Also doesn't really provide a way to seal it to your nose. Even with the stick-on metal bendable bars, still doesn't conform very well."
3.0,These are 16g and too big to fit into my nostril piercing but work great in my septum. Nice subtle rings
3.0,"The graphics is my favorite thing about this shirt. It runs large so I'd get a size smaller though, if you run it through the dryer, it will shrink. The shirt is an odd shape and after shrinking, it will be shorter but still remains wide. If only this shirt came in a relaxed cotton material...if only!"
3.0,smaller than expected.  the pockets inside for ballet shoes are really nice!
3.0,Transparentes
3.0,"Very cute, but runs on the large side. I’m 5,4, 120lbs and ordered a small. I wish it fit a bit snugger."
3.0,Bottoms fit perfect (normally a medium) top is way to big. Wishing they had an option to chose a different size bottoms and top
3.0,It tore as soon as we wore it.
3.0,"The fit is somewhat awkward for a human neck. it looks weird if you go too loose, but if you make it tight enough to look like a necklace, it feels likr you are cutting off bloodflow. Its a pity, because it is lovely. Definately buy if you have a thin neck, tho"
3.0,good material the butt area is kind of small and the beast pads do move which is good but they bend and fold up.
3.0,this is an okay product I washed it for the first time and it was over. the material sucks
3.0,The costume was a slightly tight for it being a size 2xl women’s.
3.0,Would like more of a pouch
3.0,The water turned to black color once I washed it
3.0,"It was too small, and the zipper was cheap. It doesn't zip where the fabric is gathered on mine. Adorable though. What a shame"
3.0,Really cute but runs a bit small. I got them for my homegirls baby who is 11 months and they fit his little legs kinda tight.
3.0,Shirts are great but seem to get snags easy and one arrived with a snake on it.<br />Send the photos to the seller and have heard nothing so I will be returning for a refund.
3.0,The color was as shown in the picture. I had to return it because I didn't like the leather soft feel.
3.0,It’s cute as can be. Unfortunately it’s not as comfortable as the cotton jersey ones.
3.0,"One fits perfectly and the other not so much.  The black belt is great. The royal blue one is 6"" shorter.  I can use it but it doesn't have much extra on it.  I'm not sending them back but be warned, you may not get the same size belts in a 2 pack.  Aside from the sizing issue, the belts are great.  They are stretchy and don't have any typical belt holes."
3.0,Suction can be better but it keep hait out my sink.
3.0,"I purchased the Wander Brand previously and was very happy with the quality and thickness of the socks. The brand Wander was on each sock and there was a letter S on each sock. My current socks I received from the ""Wander Group"" are NOT as thick and are larger than previous socks of the same size. The  brand name is now missing from each sock. The material is much thinner than previous pairs of socks. I don't know if these are authentic Wander socks or knock offs? Why the change in style and thickness?"
3.0,"To close the shirt you actually have to button ever last button on the front up. Because the fabric has no give, if it's even a little too small you won't be able to pull it on and you'll have to do 8,000,000 buttons each time you want to wear it.<br /><br />Suffers from the typical female button-up shirt issue of not having enough room in the back to reach your arms forward."
3.0,"My daughter liked the look of these shoes, although they were marketed for boys.  She is currently wearing size 4 in a different brand, so I ordered 4.5.  They are too tight in the toe, so she can't wear them."
3.0,"I got these for my husband to try because he always is losing his sunglasses or breaking them. He does have a larger face so glasses fit him differently. These look great straight on but from the sides they let a lot of light in. He said there is also a lot of glare for him because he can see the reflection of his cheeks in the glasses.<br /><br />The bows of these are really thin, just feel like wire. He was able to adjust the nose pieces by hand a little for a better fit. Style wise these are really cool and a classic look but functionally they are a little lacking."
3.0,"The watch was so pretty, however broke on me after a couple of months.  Was so disappointed"
3.0,"I really like the look and feel of the material. So far it retains its shape. I ordered three colors. The burgundy and green look good. I thought the mauve was more purple, but it looks like it was washed too many times and faded. Not a very flattering color. I’ll keep it because I like the shirt overall."
3.0,Super cute but runs small. Had to give away.
3.0,Lot smaller than expected
3.0,"I ordered a size larger because other reviews were saying it was small. It is very large. Ordered a xl and I should of went with a medium. Usually expect clothing from china to run small. Not this! The shirt is made with heavy fabric, which is fine but the frills on the front are extremely big and tend to overpower the shirt."
3.0,so so...
3.0,Tried ordering two sizes smaller according to the size chart and was still too large
3.0,"Okay for the price, band was larger than expected."
3.0,The zipper is right on the knees. Hiking any distance rubs your knee raw. Too bad because they fit like a glove.
3.0,"I love this purse, but almost immediately noticed that the liner is very loose & gets caught in the zipper.  Now it has ripped & there's a hole about an inch right next to the zipper.  I think it's too late to send it back so I'll end up stitching it & not being able to open it all the way.  :("
3.0,the fit over are larger than i was expecting.  night time are ok but they have a glare from the lights as you pass
3.0,"Size is spot on!  There are 3 pockets. The cargo pant pocket is a little on the small side, too small for a cell phone.  The two top/side pockets are deeper though.  The material is a cheaper water resistant material, so when walking the noise of the material rubbing against itself is really loud.  The feel is like wearing snow pants without the liner that makes it super warm.  This wasn't the quality material I was expecting for hiking pants."
3.0,Cheap material and wasnt at all what I expected. Returned it. Seller was good about it though and had no issues with return.
3.0,"This is a very cool ear cuff. And I love the design (or rather, I love the dragon). HOWEVER, it's very odd trying to fit on your ear, particularly since it must go around the top of your ear AND be inserted into an earring hole at the base of your ear. So, essentially, your ear has to be a particular size for this to look and feel correct. Also, it's a bit top-heavy, so even when I got to put it on, my ear folds a little at the top. You may have to move the metal around to get it to fit to your ear properly (be careful, though, it's not made out of the sturdiest nor most malleable metal around, so it may break if you try to alter it too much)."
3.0,Just not as it appears
3.0,When I got the package the sweater is not a sweater at all.  But a light cardigan. The pic that they show is one of a thicker look and oversized.  It doesn't look like that on me and I'm thick so.  It looks nice tho I put it over long sleeve shirts and looks casual.
3.0,"The suit was really nice, but the top was too big for me."
3.0,"I had an interview at a company whose colors are navy and gold and needed this in a pinch. The colors are great and true to what they appear in the description. It definitely feels cheap, but most people won't know except for you. I will say that the fabric is very slippery and so knots don't always stay quite as taut as I'd like. But it's good in a pinch."
3.0,Fun little glasses...makes me think of LaForge. These are very dark and thus hard to see through...no visual effects if that's what you're looking for. Where they sit on the nose is a little uncomfortable but otherwise a fun pair of silly glasses.
3.0,"Great value, but the quality is only fair.  If your looking to use for bag making I’d recommend other resources that have better quality. These are light in weight, and not high polished."
3.0,its ok kinda wish the belt was a little thicker
3.0,Ordered these for office gifts. Really not worth giving to anyone. Lesson learned. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"Way Too Small... Sent back, didn't try to guess what size would fit."
3.0,Still like it though!
3.0,These are very poor quality. They are KNUCKLE and mid rings. I am size 7.5 fingers and not one of these go past my knuckles. May be good for one time wear! They look very cheap imo
3.0,fog up super easily
3.0,A little boxy. And why are the tags on the outside?
3.0,Material picked really bad
3.0,"This is adorable and exactly what i was looking for however, the material is 100% acrylic. aside from the fact that acrylic doesn't wash well, it has a rough feel to it. Not what i would want rubbing against my baby's skin on a hot day. I wish they would make the same thing in cotton. I will be returning this product."
3.0,"Cute dress and soft material, but ran way too large on me. I'm 5 ft. and 110 lbs and typically wear an XS or Small, I ordered the small (which was the smallest size available) and ended up completely drowning in it. If the fit was more comparable to a typical size small or extra small, it would have been perfect."
3.0,These ones are thinner than others I’ve used. Too easily bendable to the point where it looks deformed.
3.0,"40DDD ordered a large. Fits, but not the best material (a lot more spandex then ya think) & not a relaxed tshirt. Too clingy & I don't think it's because the size is off. Spandex is not a good combination with other materials, especially when you get the ""suction"" effect to your midsection. I have a belly & don't want that look. Just not the tshirt I hoped for & the color is not vibrant at all, very flat, dull dark pink & I ordered maroon. I'll wear it to sleep in or under a flannel shirt."
3.0,"I liked the design on this T-shirt, and it arrived quickly.  That said, I wear a large, ordered an xxl.  It was so small I could barely get it over my head."
3.0,Super cute material....shirt size doesn't seem to match pant size and hat is definitely for smaller sizes only...not sure why it is included in the larger size orders if it isn't large enough for a toddler noggin
3.0,It’s a two pack.  Kind of short for men’s jeans.  But price was low and they’ll do.
3.0,"The skirt is very nice, unfortunately it didn't fit like I thought. The waist said that it was elastic but it really didn't stretch at all."
3.0,Sizing is a problem.  Arm sleeves too narrow. Purchased size according to guide but was way too small
3.0,"Very thin and see through, almost like panty hose. But I bought for her to wear under her dresses."
3.0,It isn't as full as the pictures but I guess we get what we paid for.
3.0,I didn’t really like the way that the coat was packaged because it messed up the shape of the coat. I was not able to get the coat back to it’s original shape. It was too thin to be advertised as a winter coat.
3.0,Good but could possibly stick out of your nose
3.0,"They were much bigger than they looked in the pictures and more I was expecting. But customer service took care of it right away, which I really appreciated that they cared about their customers!"
3.0,"I ordered this because I had a similar one that was no longer available. This one is too small.  5'4 with shoes on and it's just not long enough in the torso. It would be perfect  if you were very petite, like under 5'2 and slim."
3.0,"The pictures on the company's Amazon website showed the sunglasses to be a light silvery gray, but they are very dark gray. They're ok, but not what I expected."
3.0,"After a year, one of the zippers failed.  Reached out to customer service. No response. So the bad is a good bag but don't plan on them responding if you need customer service."
3.0,My girlfriend loves it but it is really hard to get a picture in because it is too small
3.0,This is really good quality. I ordered two sizes up and can't fit my shoulders in the coat :( But I'm keeping this in case I lose weight
3.0,they're a little annoying and itchy after long use. also awkward when you have to take a dump
3.0,People were right about some of them having black ink on them. A couple of mine came with the ink. One of my broke already but to be fair I stretched it out pretty good. I would still buy more. They are cheap and cute colors.
3.0,A lot smaller than I anticipated and difficult to open.
3.0,"The material is great and the shirt looks nice, but the built in bra area is WAY smaller than you would expect for the size shirt. I bought a medium and could barely get the bra portion on, but the rest of the shirt hung way too big. Not just workout loose, but like wearing your moms clothes as a kid loose. Maybe you need to be a Amazonian tall woman in order to wear this, because an average 5'3, 125 lbs. woman sure can't!"
3.0,"A little smaller than I thought, but it is cure"
3.0,The top doesn't stay in place the sides keep sliding to the middle on the front.
3.0,It thought it was a small but instead is a large it doesn't fit me
3.0,"These tights are super soft and very comfortable to wear, but ran in the toe of one leg after one wear."
3.0,"Lovely style, fits comfortably.<br />Wrinkles terribly when washed and the dryer does not help remove the wrinkles, will require ironing to wear after washing.....<br />I would not purchase again knowing this."
3.0,Definitely ran small. Had to add an extender. Comfortable when standing but rolls when sitting. Good coverage and a little push up. I would buy again if a 42 C was offered.
3.0,Its good. But too small !
3.0,The quality of the material and the size of the mask were exactly what I was looking for.  I did not realize it was one that tied on with strings attached.  I will use it though
3.0,I thought this looked cute on line. I got it and not a big fan. Runs boxy. Very high neck
3.0,It runs true to size. I ordered a small and it fit well. Unfortunately the waistline hit at an awkward spot for me (above my natural waist but below an empire waist). The material was also too see through. I returned this dress.
3.0,"It arrived on time but4 out of 7 different ones I ordered were missing a stitch so they didn’t stay put over my nose when I put it on. I will have to have it sewn at the cleaners or have a friend add an additional row of stitching to make it work. The 3 that did have the stitching on one end fit great, stayed in place on my nose. And I didn’t realize when I ordered these that they are from China. Wash thoroughly before the first use. I hand wash and hang dry and then warm iron to get out the wrinkles. You can put in the dryer but I don’t want them to shrink."
3.0,"Very soft but thin. I was expecting a thicker fabric like sweatpants, this feels more like pajamas. Also a little too balooney at the ankle. I’ll wear these at home but not out. 5’6”. 138. Size medium"
3.0,"The material was nice but the fit was off, returned it because of the fit."
3.0,"My original order was 12 bandannas. Ordered June 8. They never arrived by the 30th so I contacted the seller. My lost order was replaced, but was 10 pieces not the 12 I'd paid for. (They DID arrive very fast.) Quality is as ecpected. Size is great. Color not matching the picture is expected but the total number SHOULD have still been my Original 12 in number.( I was shorter two bandanas.)<br />I guess I'm glad I got anything."
3.0,I love the color and would recommend it to others however it does run small.  It seemed more like a junior size. Material seemed a bit cheap.
3.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend, who is mechanically inclined.  He struggles with taking it on and off everyday.  It's cool looking, but too big of a hassle to wear to be worth it.  You shouldn't need a tool to add and remove an accessory."
3.0,This dress fit more like a tank top
3.0,"Nice quality, but it's the size of a purse, not a tote..."
3.0,To heavy and large for my personal taste.
3.0,"necklace is very cute but when it arrived, there was a bead that had fallen off in the box. disappointing."
3.0,"Cute glasses, great around a pool for looks...doesn't really block light just looks good......scratches very easily"
3.0,"Not great quality, but it does the job."
3.0,They do fit on me but barely.  And they scrunch up when I bend over. Too small for the size I ordered.
3.0,"This runs a little small. I use this for gardening. It got green pruning my tomatoes and washed out just fine. I cold wash and air dry this. I haven’t felt any cooling or wicking aspect at all, not sure why. I haven’t gotten sunburned while wearing it either."
3.0,"My thighs are a bit on the larger side, but I was still expecting this to fit. Unfortunately they didn't, the band it's just too tight for me. If your thighs/legs are on the more slender side I'm sure they'll fit though."
3.0,A little snug but still great & comfortable for around the house.
3.0,Beautiful bathing suit- looked great on me but no underwire as stated in the description. I specifically searched for underwire bathing suits and this one says that it has hidden underwire. Wrong.
3.0,"Did not like the quality of the swimsuit. The bottom part is too tight, which makes my buttcheeks not fall into place."
3.0,Lovely but it broke! I wore it often and sadly it wasn't very  sturdy
3.0,"I’m 5’1 140 lbs with a pear/hourglass body shape. I wear a 6/8 in jeans and generally a medium/large in tops.<br /><br />This looked terrible on me. I tried it on the moment it arrived and my husband told me I reminded him of Phylis from The Office. We got a good laugh out of it but I am returning, that’s not the look I’m going for in my mid 20s.<br /><br />I looked like a frumpy Oompa Loompa. It was so bad. I think if you’re slender this could be really cute. You’d think it would have this boho oversized sweater look, but I have small frame, wider hips and a badonk and I was lost in this in a very unflattering kind of way. Maybe I need to size down? I’m returning this. It’s just not for me.<br /><br />Be mindful of your shape ladies. This was such a disappointment."
3.0,"I’ve had these since April, 2019 but they are already getting small holes in them. Soft and comfortable but thin and I’m sad about the small holes...Amazon, please advise.."
3.0,"Initially loved these bras but when I went to wear the third one it only had the padding in one side! It’s not removable, and it’s too late to return. So I have two instead of three that I can wear"
3.0,"I bought these because I wanted cotton based material touching my skin. I was disappointed to find that the inside of the sock has a larger concentration of the synthetic fibers than the outside. Also, on most colors, the inside is a different color than the outside so only the black pair can be worn inside out. The very top of the sock is also much tighter than the rest so it is irritating and causes some pain at times. In all I wish I had tried a different brand."
3.0,It is very pretty but snags your clothing.<br />I'm thinking I might spray paint the back side of it with a clearcoat.  To take away the snagging.
3.0,"Too large for my medium face. I don’t use it. If I need it , I will have to take some tucks in it. Too much work. Wasted my money."
3.0,The dress has very pretty colors. The dress ran big overall and too long for me.  I’m 5’1.  I returned the dress for these reasons.
3.0,"Dress fits very large and drapes on the floor. I can wear the skirt tied at the bottom so it doesn't drag. It's cute and summery, but the fit is a bit off."
3.0,I’m 135 lbs 5’5 and I ordered in a medium. The arms could be about 2 inches longer and so could the length of the shirt itself. Rides up constantly so I’m always pulling on it. Kept me warm. I’d recommend ordering 2 sizes up. After reading reviews I ordered 1 size up and now I wish I had ordered 2 sizes up.
3.0,Nice pantyhose for steampunk costume.  Giving three stars because hose arrived with hole in crotch and developed holes throughout the evening.  These are one time use and will not withstand multiple wearing.
3.0,not very conturing
3.0,Good quality material but a bit short and small for a xl
3.0,"These definitely run large and the sleeves are long. I do like wearing this, but mostly for around the house, it's not super warm. Color is great tho!"
3.0,"Geez Louise, it's SO small!!! It has XXL on tag ~ for who? Barbie?"
3.0,I have purchased several diffrent yoga pant fro. Diffrnt companys this is byfar the worst the.entire night all i could do.was pull my pants up they are very poorly made was not the size the pants are just poor quality
3.0,Cute but cheap you get what you pay for
3.0,"Very thin, and cheaply made. You get what you pay for though. I bought these to go in her easter basket, and she really liked them. I've washed them multiple times and they're still holding up though."
3.0,"Bought these at the last second for a business trip with company equipment in tow. Sucks that I can't use all of the tags because of an assembly person flipped the barrel the wrong way. I would give one more star if it weren't for this issue. Hey Bluecosto if you're reading this, I'd like another wire loop shipped to me. That being said it's a solid design and durable product. I would roll the dice and order again for sure!<br /><br />Pros: solid design, hi-viz color for spotting on the baggage return carousel, made of quality durable materials.<br /><br />Con: one of the barrel connectors was assembled in the wrong direction. See photos. One end of the wire has the male thread-end that supposed to mate with the female threads in the barrel on the other end of the wire making the secure loop. Just a little bit of QC needed.<br /><br />I'd still buy these though."
3.0,"I recommend this sandal to men with wide feet...i chose the 6E and it was very wide...if fit well when tried on.  The removable sole did provide some discomfort at once but later on it was comfortable.  It is a durable sandal, however I am giving it 3 stars because the sandal is coming apart on the bed where the removable sole is attached.  The rest of the shoe is in great shape so will have to take it to a shoe repair to glue this a better way.  Other than that it looks great and if yo do not get it wet at all it may not come appart at all."
3.0,Ordered a size up. It fits good. Really thin so I wear a tank top under it.
3.0,"Almost there........it isn't exactly a toy.  It is nicer than that.  Especially the bead work and the materials around the front are carefully done and densely applied.  My problem comes with the cascading feathers........there are not enough of them......this part is too spare.  If I had the time, I would buy more feathers and add one between<br />each existing feather.<br />A word about the fit; don't worry about that.  Essentially the whole thing is attached to a fabric cap.  If the head dress is too big it can be taken in with a stitch or two.  If too small, a snip in the back will serve."
3.0,Really tight/small.
3.0,"Looks cuter in the picture and they don't come with metal backs, just the rubber kind. Some of the jewels seemed loose and the gold is yellow, not a rosie gold like the picture suggests. For the price, it's worst it though"
3.0,"These Flashing/Glowing Christmas Necklaces did the job, but beware of the tiny lightbulbs of the non-flashing/lit lights. They fall off very easily and can definitely be a choking hazard. I was honestly a little shocked after discovering that flaw, since they are something that kids would be drawn to. I intended to give them to my children, just for the fun of it.. but wasn’t able to, due to the loose parts. I guess these would be great for adults, and places where children wouldn’t be exposed to them."
3.0,ZIPPER NOT SECURE
3.0,good quality for a reasonable price.
3.0,Love the design but it’s difficult to breathe in it!
3.0,"So, it may not wrinkle and that is a plus but other than that I don't think I really care for this dress. I don't hate it. But it is not stunning. I do not feel fabulous in it. It is printed only on one side so if you are filling this dress out and maxing its capabilities for the fabric, please be aware the white will show through. This is a printed fabric the colors are not woven in. There is a huge difference between those. The twist knot is nice but the most well done. There are large gaping holes around the knot. The neckline isn't bad and there is plenty of room for busty persons. I find the care directions a little amusing ""day clean"" I know it is supposed to be dry clean but still don't wash in the dark. I think the colors are a little flat to me and not quite as vibrant as I had hoped. The actual printed colors don't mesh together as well as what the online photo shows. I do think the style of the dress will be flattering for many shapes, especially pear and hourglass shapes. For reference I am 5'8 and 140 pounds and typically wear a med or a 6/8 in women's US. I hope this helps and happy shopping. Oh, and it is not breathable at all! If you are one who sweats this will be awful!"
3.0,"not really liking this set, the bracelets are too big and did not come with a paper telling you the significance of the stones"
3.0,Very nice build quality.
3.0,Color was just as the picture but it did come in too short. I would definitely say ordering a size up or 2.
3.0,Too small. I’m BARELY able to fit a MacBook charger inside - there’s definitely no room for anything else. I included a picture for scale.
3.0,"The suit came as shown in the photos. The top was small, but still fit and looked fine. However, the bottoms were way to small and hardly covered anything up. I will be returning the suit simply because I cannot wear the bottoms, but will consider ordering a size up.<br /><br />The suit itself is good quality and frankly, has a very unique style. The design and shape of the suit is sophisticated, while still being sexy.<br /><br />I would still recommend this suit to a friend, but definitely order a size up."
3.0,"For casual wear, very comfortable"
3.0,Product runs very small i ordered a 14/16 for my daughter and as soon as I opened the package i was very disappointed. I ended up giving them to my niece who could fit them but they were still pretty snug
3.0,"Order one size larger than you normally wear. I wear a US Large, and had to re-order this one in US XL.<br />The fabric is a little rough to the touch and not a very high quality.<br />The &#34;look&#34;, on the other hand, is great...I have received many compliments...<br />This fabric weight of this shirt is good for Spring or Summer wear.<br />I would have scored this higher if the fabric was a higher quality..."
3.0,It's OK and really soft but holds nothing ;-)
3.0,"Was hoping this umbrella would hold up to wind gusts but inverted during a wind gust that was probably about 35MPH. It is a nice lightweight umbrella but also a lightweight to winds, unlike the descriptions led me to believe."
3.0,"Very pretty and comfy dress but doesn’t fit  me.  Short waisted, big breasted. I didn’t realize it was an empire waist."
3.0,nice dress but it is too large. top material is too thin.
3.0,The shirt is very different looking than the pic in person it does run small so beware
3.0,Not as cute as the picture!
3.0,Se aflojan las tiras
3.0,"I don't know if I'm spoiled with usually only buying VS but these fit ok but man, they had a lot of loose stitching. I'm not used to having it feel like it's falling apart from the first time I wear it, regardless of being washed. The price was better and I guess they were just lose/extra stitching since there aren't any holes that I can find, but I definitely am sticking with my waiting for the semi-annual VS sales I think."
3.0,"The product seems to be very fragile in fact i have to open it to screw the big piece that moves to make it work because it get loose, the blue cristal fell of watch"
3.0,It was cute and did fit her but the shirt material is so thin you can see through it.
3.0,"you get what you pay for, these are for custom use for the most part"
3.0,"They're ok, but cheap looking."
3.0,Pretty but scratchy.
3.0,I was looking for something to wear over my petticoat and this works. I have a 34C bust and followed the guide ordering a medium.  It requires a belt to not look like a tent.
3.0,Too large and big
3.0,"Cute, stones off set."
3.0,"Sometimes they tend to fall off, but it could just me getting used to using an OTG device.<br /><br />The important thing for me is their VA100 rating.  UVA or UVB is not good for me, so these glasses should fit the need very well."
3.0,"I like this, but the bottom is really small around and doesn't give when putting it on."
3.0,check length when ordering - it is too long
3.0,"Beautiful ring, but runs small. I have a professionally sized band on my ring finger, in a size 8. Ordered this in an 11 so it would fit my index finger. Alas, it is the same size as the 8. Still beautiful though."
3.0,"I used to wear earlier pants similar to the from Lands End, years ago. I was looking for something a little nicer than a sweatpants for wearing on days off. These are okay. I find them short and a little heavier weight than I would like. They aren’t my favorite, and I’ll use them as it’s too much trouble to return them, but I don’t like them. They seem to ride up on my calves whether through static or just fit, I’m not sure."
3.0,Very light weight but it cannot compress into smaller size. I ordered a small. It can only compress into 1/3 of its height. Kind of disappointed. I am still debating if I should return it.
3.0,"Not sure why they made it the way they did but the locking mechanism makes the band way to small for my wrist and there’s no way it would fit any man’s wrist. If you didn’t have to fold the lock over it would fit. Plus the pins are such a pain putting in. Doesn’t come with extra brackets.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I realized the reason the band wouldn't lock was because the factory had set the frame on the wrong side so when I flipped it, it fit on me correctly.<br />You may also want to use a heavier hammer or use more force when trying to poke out the needles when you are taking off each link."
3.0,Worked great but my daughter kept getting hot in hers. My son almost fell like 3 time because he couldn't see pass the eyeholes. The lights on it is great you can hang it on your wall are something but for waring I don't think so.
3.0,"I like the product but maybe because my wrist is small, it felt too bulky with the tradidional watch clasp and how big the watch face is. Ended up buying something else but I loved this pattern."
3.0,They are very cute and well made but run very large my daughters an 11 and they fit like 13 or size 1 its crazy how big they are.
3.0,Like swimsuit!
3.0,ordered for my nephew the fabric is not soft at all/ runs smaller than a regular size Small tshirt wish i had time to return it
3.0,"The color received, is not the color shown in the picture. It is a darker red, but it won't ok for what we needed it for."
3.0,Irritated bc I ordered a size up based on reviews. Normally a 4 and ordered a 6. Let’s just say I could fit two of me in the dress. It was huge! Otherwise the quality is nice and dress is pretty.
3.0,What is it with the color white that has a pink hue to it That's what this top has
3.0,Was cute but turned my finger green  really quick 😟
3.0,"Nice pin as far as the quality and clarity of design. However the liquid of the jar seems more pale, greenish-blue than the baby blue that I anticipated by looking at the image. See photo for comparison against my light blue lanyard."
3.0,For the money not enough would have liked more that justssidacives matter
3.0,"You will need a camisole or pretty bra, it is very see-thru."
3.0,The inscription is not that easy to read.
3.0,"This was very pretty. A little to tight in the bust area, even though I used the chart. It didn't go to waste though. I gave it to my sister. She loves it. All is well now."
3.0,kind of small for my wrist! Always need help to lock it in...
3.0,"I expected it to fit like a tee shirt, but it was more like a tunic. I'm<br />5'3."
3.0,Wonderful material and color for the season I wish I can have size 34/34 I'll be more than happy to buy it again !!
3.0,"This necklace is very pretty and delicate, almost too delicate as it borders on being flimsy. I'm hoping it doesn't catch on anything as it looks like it would break easily. It's extremely light-weight."
3.0,Too small on hips (and I ordered 1 size up). Colors are brighter in person. Gave 3 stars because the customer service was great!
3.0,great Fit but noticed sequin already falling off just trying on
3.0,Monogram was disappointing
3.0,This shirt was way too short for me.
3.0,"It's a nice bracelet...however...you have to be careful of the little ball coming unscrewed. I almost the ball, cage, and lava ball twice. Also, the cage doesn't really dangle."
3.0,Kinda short and doesn't really stay up as a choker but the price is why I got it
3.0,Ok for price but I wouldnt order another. A bit tight if you have alot of hair. Very thin material.
3.0,"???,,"
3.0,Flimsy but get the job done.
3.0,These glasses look great and the filters are perfect.  But I can only wear them for a short period of time.  They're too heavy.  Very uncomfortable.
3.0,Cute shoe but not a quality shoe. Got them for an event and they worked for what I needed. Would not buy again. Not comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
3.0,Way too big for me - if I kept it I would have put it on a much heavier chain.
3.0,I'm indifferent about this dress. The navy and white polka dots is perfect for the summer.  They cap sleeves and length is good too.  It need a little tweaking for it to be flattering.
3.0,"These worked great the first 3 or 4 months, then the lenses began to delaminate from the margins inward. I suspect salt crystallization in between the lamellae caused the problem which worsened until about a cm of the margin had delaminated. I could still see through the delaminated portion, albeit not clearly, but then the delaminated portions of the lens would not fit properly in the frame anymore, and eventually the entire lens popped out after getting tumbled in a wave. The exact same thing happened with the second pair I had purchased.<br /><br />After 15 years of trying many different kinds of sun glasses for kite surfing and ultimately losing every pair in one way or another to the ocean, I have settled on the ultra cheap 3M Tekk 11330 Virtua Anti-Fog Safety Glasses. They aren't polarized, but they are 99.9% UV protected and at about $3.00 a pair, I'm OK loosing them. Add a brightly colored Croakie with the one of those little rubber floats and you probably won't even loose your $3.00 investment. One more bonus about these safety glasses is that they don't have separate lenses that will pop out. The lenses and frames are one piece of molded, no-shatter polycarbonate. No more face-plant pop-outs!!"
3.0,They were larger than expected. I returned them.
3.0,The dress feels great and looks great except for the extra bump below my chest. There was extra material that wasn’t cut or pulled better causing the unwanted bump. Definitely need to return it because it’s noticeable.
3.0,"Sizing was good. The material was weird. It is semi shiny, slick looking. Like an athletic shirt material."
3.0,These glasses are what I was looking for but there is a slight distortion in the right lens which is quite annoying.
3.0,Fair-good.
3.0,Little saggy not great for the average women's neck but would still buy again
3.0,"Only three. The shipment was delayed. Not tge seller's fault though. Just three because I'm partially satisfied with my purchase. The shirts fit, just a tad short and I'm barely 6' and that isn't overly tall at all."
3.0,"They have more of the beige color than I like, but they are light weight."
3.0,Beautiful piece. Chain broke a month-ish in.
3.0,"Took ages to ship & arrive. Not super comfortable, but does the job of holding small things around your wrist.<br />Haven't really used it much because we found something else to do the job when it didn't arrive in a timely manner."
3.0,Tight across the belly.  Fits my big &#34;girls&#34; well.
3.0,"Too small.  Item for a child or very, very small  waist adult."
3.0,"These lenses are indeed polarized and also fit perfectly in the existing frame.  However, the lenses themselves are thin and feel very cheap compared to the lenses they are replacing.  In the end, is it worth the money? That is debatable. I would feel less like this if the pricepoint were a little lower."
3.0,Dress was beautiful and I wore it out one night and to the US Open. My complaint though is that it started to pill after 1.5 wears. I had a backpack on the 2nd time I was wearing it and the backpack was rubbing my lower back area so the fabric started pilling from that. Also across the chest I saw some pilling for no reason. I love this dress (5 stars) but am disappointed at the pilling which brings this down to 3 stars.
3.0,Very nice material and cool for summer heat.
3.0,"Expected different, definitely size down as these are huge and not comprehensive at all. Very soft and have one pocket on the right side."
3.0,Very light weight easy to bend
3.0,"I loved the goody the first time I wore it. However as soon as I washed it and ""hung dried"" it shrunk! In the length of the arms as well as the torso! I wanted to love it still but had to give to my younger niece."
3.0,Didn't last very long...started to rip at the place where you connect the 2 parts.
3.0,The paint on this isn't great.  There's red spots on the core.  The red is chipped. I wouldn't buy this again but if you're looking for something for a child or costume I think this would be good.  It's only $2 so don't expect too much from it.
3.0,"This watch is striking in it's appearance and it's time keeping ability seems to be great but the large size of this watch negates all of that.  Now if you have a larger size wrist, I can see this watch being more of a fit."
3.0,hoops are very small!! rest of jewelry is amazing! love how many pieces you get!
3.0,Not for large chested woman - the top flat was also too long
3.0,"Works fine, can be a little hassle to get to with the clip going over the zipper"
3.0,NOT AS MUCH BLING AS I THOUGHT
3.0,These top of these shoes are a little stiff and cause some blistering.
3.0,Too big for my skinny tie
3.0,"I always get compliments when I wear these earrings.  However, the backs don't hold the earrings on my ear.  I push the back onto the peg as far as it will go--but after about two hours, the earring falls out of my hear.  I need to find different backs that will hold these earrings tighter."
3.0,"I really like the look and the fit.  However, I can't use it with short sleeves, since the sleeves are not lined and the material is really rough.  Had I tried it with short sleeves in time, I would have returned it for that reason.  I will use it with long sleeves."
3.0,The fit is a little looser than I would like but the real problem is the colors bled. I should have listened to the other reviews that mentioned this issue.
3.0,Its made out of workout pants material. I was expecting a nicer material since people said you could dress it up. To each their own I guess.
3.0,"It's a great backpack and the price is reasonable, however it is too large for me."
3.0,Color is not as it appears. It's a little washed out. Keep in mind the color difference.
3.0,Looks cute but the top is insanely uncomfortable! Straps won’t stay and they dig into your shoulder blades. Bottoms fit great though
3.0,So so big. I ordered an EXTRA small and it is still so big. I mean I love the loose and casual feel and it will be good for my vacation as a cover up. But you can see I. The pictures I posted that even with wedges it is super long. I'm 5'3 approx. 130
3.0,"I give this dress a 3 star review.  It is not a bad dress, but it's inconsistencies make it hard to judge.<br /><br />I ordered multiple colors and sizes, some same size different colors.  I have found it the dress to be inconsistent with the sewing and the way it fits.  It was also sewed crooked at the bottom hem, one side touched the ground while the other was nearly below my ankle, this was with heels on.<br /><br />The material is nice and feels sturdy, and the colors and patterns are beautiful.<br /><br />The material near the chest bunched up too much and was loose under the armpit area, and would need to be taken in.  This was for the smallest size ordered, and one side needed to be taken in more than the other.<br /><br />The dress had a very weird smell to it, all of them.  It must have been something with the dyes, but it was unpleasant.<br /><br />With a better production line, this dress has great potential.  I returned all of them."
3.0,Nice cool watch but its face is a smaller man's watch and the time is runs a little fast.
3.0,It wasn't a high quality print. The Material was really nice but the printing had blurry fragmentation you could tell it was a cheap print job. poor quality. It didn't glow in the blacklight either so they didn't use any cool pigments. Everyone loved it tho. I wore it to a bunch of raves. I couldn't get the sleeves to roll up. They were too tight. Great for cold outdoor parties tho.
3.0,"The skirt was very full but still see through and had to wear leggings underneath. Also, normally a medium and ordered an XL...still was snug around the waist!!"
3.0,"This bummed me out. It's not soft or stretchy and it was way too small. Definitely size up! It's heavier material, so that's good if you want that."
3.0,Would be a higher rating but it comes so wrinkled.  I have an extremely hard time getting most of them out
3.0,"My daughter, who is very thin and usually wears the size we ordered, had her butt hanging out from the bottom. It’s not really usable for her now unless she wears shorts while swimming."
3.0,The shirt is great but the skirts butterfly things fell off in the dryer and the glue stuck the skirt to itself.  So air dry the skirt.
3.0,"The print is very cute and it looks just like the picture butttt it runs pretty small. I mean if you like your shirts tight then order your true size. I kinda felt like a can of ready-made biscuits ready to pop in my true size and I'm a smaller person. (5'2"" 110lbs) so size up one or two if you want it to fit a little looser. Other than that is super cute and everyone always compliments it."
3.0,"Fits as expected, nice quality and material- however I won’t be able to wear it without figuring something out for the skit. It opens up all the way to the top of my thighs, when I tried it on it just standing, it seemed ok, but when I wore it I was embarrassed sitting down as I had to constantly hold it closed or adjust it. I am 5’8 140 lbs 34d and the Medium fit me as expected besides the slit problem. Maybe for a shorter person the slit wouldn’t open up as high? It was almost to my crotch when sitting w legs crossed."
3.0,Super cute dress. Wayyyy too small.
3.0,"Greta style bag. but the color is more of a dark red rather than wine colored. Not what i was looking for so returned. other than that the bag was fine,"
3.0,"Nice colour and nice fabric.<br /><br />But the stitching is bad , really bad quality.<br />It is now coming apart from the keyhole part and I can’t wear it any longer.<br /><br />Any other place I could have stitched it back but right near the keyhole the design is just destroyed now."
3.0,"Comfy but thin!!!! And low cut. I will be using it as a bathing suit cover up!!! Not going to order more colors. I really wish they made this higher cut and thicker material, it is the perfect length and cut for a causal summer dress. It is super low on the chest and since I don't really have anything there, no good ;-) I am 5'4&#34;. 130 lbs, 34 A/B, large hips and booty, and wear a 4-6 in clothes. I ordered a small. It was smaller than some swing dresses I have gotten on Amazon, but fit true to size I think."
3.0,a good looking design but usability is fair
3.0,Decent slipper for the price although they both look like they go on the same foot?
3.0,Not like the pic. Didn’t know there’s a tie at the back. Overall not too bad! Not purchasing for a while. Too disappointed. Especially the short dresses
3.0,Cute but sizes differ. Purchased size 6 and one dress is over an inch shorter than the other.
3.0,I was so excited to receive this necklace for my daughter who adores bunnies. Unfortunately it fell short of my expectations per the images shown online. The coloration of stone was more milky white than strawberry colored and the stone was MUCH smaller than expected.
3.0,It’s cool thing but there is no padding on the inside.  So it ends up being very lose.
3.0,It was too large and the hood was too big for me
3.0,Glasses came In  good condition  and arrived fast. I was  disappointed in the color. The picture shows the glasses to be a dark red and what I received was lighter than what I expected.
3.0,They seems to be very light but synthetic material is not very breathable which defies the purpose of having light summer shorts. Ventilation may be ok if you move but otherwise if you are relaxing on your patio chair in summer prepare to sweat.
3.0,not what I expected. Picture it is perfect comparing with reality
3.0,"I love this piece of jewelry but no matter how I try, the tentacle doesn't fit within my ear. :("
3.0,The dress isn’t exactly as pictured. I read reviews and ordered a larger size and it still was sort of small. It does not go off my shoulder but it’s still a cute dress so I’m wearing it but I’m just disappointed at how different the product was from the pictures.
3.0,Loved them but they are cheap and fragile. Broke within 2 months.
3.0,It does not have finishing. No mark. Square designed.
3.0,"The hat was super cute but immediately fell apart. The buttons came off the first day of wearing her mask attached to it, and the Pom Pom fell off randomly the first week. I sewed them back on and added some stitches to the other buttons and Pom Pom so now she wears it and loves it."
3.0,To square fit!
3.0,"shorts are good, shirt is getting donated. it’s way too short :("
3.0,"It's more of a tunic top than a dress. Way too short and I'm only 5""2"
3.0,Looked frumpy. A lot of extra fabric around chest area. Not very flattering. Not worth it.
3.0,I like it but really on the large size compared to the size chart listed. I need to wear another tank. Usually clothes on Amazon seem on the smaller size but not this one. I'm a 36D. I think I need two size smaller.
3.0,Pretty but ankles were very small. Ordering a size up would have made them way too long.
3.0,"Comfortable sock but certainly not a &#34;No Show&#34; sock as it was advertised.  Fits the bill if you are looking to wear these with your athletic sneakers but I was looking for something that could be worn with a lower profile shoe, ie. boat shoe or slip on loafer.  For $10, I'm not going to return them but I did ultimately have to buy another brand that suited my needs."
3.0,"This product has a great price paired with a high level of comfort, but after washing them in the washing machine and drying them in the dryer under regular cycle, both pants and the upper part shrunk a lot, and I mean several inches. Buy at least one size larger and you will be happy!"
3.0,I ordered this in a 2X and it did not fit.  I gave it to my daughter who is 6' tall and wears a size 10.  I was very disappointed because it's nice material and it's cute.
3.0,"Awesome cheap shirt. Great fit and cool color. Material resembles a Mexican blanket and gets very frizzy after first wash. Hasn't stopped me from wearing it though. Don't think it's going to last too long. Trim is unthreading and buttons get caught in stray threads. Worth the $15, but not any more than that."
3.0,Way to heavy
3.0,"La botella funciona limpia bien pero tienes que usar bastante producto , el cepillo muy pequeño y la toalla es innecesaria  por el precio puedes encontrar algo mejor"
3.0,Only bad part is I washed it when it arrived & the decal tore partly off
3.0,"Cute color, but very thin material. By very flattering"
3.0,The material is smooth and not the buttery soft material. The material has a unique cooling feel. They run large. Normally I would get a medium but the small fits better. I returned them because the crotch is so low. Color was true to the pictures.
3.0,"both packages marked on material as XL, but one set was perfect with moderate yet comfy support,  the other set was too loose and no  support.  In very small print on package I saw one bag had 2 XL and the other had 4XL.  will reorder the smaller set if I can be guaranteed to get the 2 XL."
3.0,What i didn't like was it being stuffed into a plastic bag and then stuffed into my little gang type neighborhood mailbox. Waste of money
3.0,nice rings but are lead to believe that they spin by their appearance.
3.0,I ordered the gray shirt. It's definitely darker in person. It's hard to even read the writing. But I still like the shirt. Material is nice and soft.
3.0,"I was a little disappointed in this bathing suit, The product fitting was good it fit as expected but the bust area was a little awkward.  If your bigger chested it will fit you better. Under the chest area is open so you can actually stick you hand through it. Not only do I have to worry about my breast coming out the top of the bathing suit but I also have to worry about it coming out the bottom too. Not crazy about that.  The strap also kept coming undone I could sew it to fix it but I shouldn't have to. It also came with a couple stains on it. Overall I am not very happy with this bathing suit. It is cute,  but it could of been made better in my opinion.  I am just a Amazon Prime member who reviews products as a hobby. I did receive this product at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I take this very seriously as I rely highly on others reviews when deciding on a purchase. I hope you have found my review helpful, and thank you for taking the time to read it!"
3.0,"I run into this same issue a lot with printed stretchy pants - when stretched, the pattern disappears and they dont look great anymore."
3.0,Crystals are not very clear but I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,"Gives the impression it comes with a spare pair of lenses,,,,,,,it doesn't.....other than that......they're ok.....got to looking at the pictures in here and realized that the top of the case looked funny so I checked and sure enough the spare lenses were in there, sorry about the false information earlier.....they are a decent pair of glasses....."
3.0,I love Vionic sand lies but these hurt the crisscross is on the top of the shoe.
3.0,"Itchy, but very light weight. It counts as a face covering but will not protect you from anything or protect anyone from you. My daughter loves it."
3.0,"very pretty I gave this a gift for my daughter whio loves butterfies , the chain broke because it's not what I thought it was, I amused that the chain was silver, but it's not ."
3.0,"Just received it but was very dissapointed in the color. Was hoping that he vague discription of &#34;Green&#34; would lean more toward the brighter end of that spectrum. Sadly it is the color and brightness ( or lack there of) of pea soup. The purse itself seemed ok in size and style but the coloring wont work for my needs, so my search continues."
3.0,"they are just tube type socks, so they don't seem as good of quality as some other nylons, but they do the job."
3.0,"These earrings were okay, but not the dark navy color in another pair of black pearl earrings that I loved.  I don't know if these black earrings all look different and it's not possible to get the color until you've purchased them."
3.0,"It cuts down glare without making everything dark, but just seems flimsy. I use it and it works, but..."
3.0,They're stylish(-ish) wayfarers for not a lot of money. I like the carrying case the cone with; that'll help me keep them in good shape while I'm not wearing them.
3.0,These works great only wish the seams wasn’t on the bottom of the sock. It’s super annoying.
3.0,"I bought these intending to wear them out and about as boots.  There is little support in them, more like slippers.  I added inserts and I think it's more the sole of the boot is lacking.  Comfortable for around the house and yard though."
3.0,"Don’t really like it, plus there was a yellow spot on the shoulder part..."
3.0,My son loves his new shoes but unfortunately cannot wear them right now. We have hardwood floors and he slides around like he’s wearing socks with these. Not too safe for a 2 year old. I will have to add some sort of grip to the bottom.
3.0,"Wife likes that it is lightweight, nice pattern, not see through when wearing it.  Cool tan through concept.<br /><br />Dislikes:  Needed a size equivalent to a US 8-10, seller indicated a size small would work.  The cover is too small."
3.0,"Fair value for these glasses.  Needed a &#34;wide beam&#34; pair for my 75/8&#34; head. Good beam (temple to temple) width and arms length. Lens are very light in color and probably not good on the brightest days, but good for driving and polarized gave pretty clear, accurate vision. Metal frames are about what you would expect for this price point, will probably not take much abuse and feel somewhat fragile.  Frames fit was a bit tight--did not want to manually &#34;shape&#34; these, as afraid they would break or be deformed (go to your eye specialist if you need to loosen them). Like the silicone (?) treatment on the arm/ear pieces."
3.0,Bark comes off leaving light wood behind
3.0,"I enjoy the overall fit of the sweater.<br />Although I have washed it several times, its better to wear a LONG sleeve shirt beneath it. It has a rather uncomfortable itchy texture to the fabric that no softner can get rid of."
3.0,You have to put the banner together
3.0,top fit badly in arm holes- returned
3.0,"I like this wallet very much. It is big enough to put all of the cards, licenses, cash and phone, and it still can be zipped closed. I still am very happy with mine, but it would have a full set of stars if, as I believed, it had been actual leather. I managed to get a little scrape in the corded area around the zipper, and I really didn't expect that to happen while it was still a few weeks old. I will carry it though because it is so handy, and it helps me remember not to put my card in my pocket!"
3.0,"Just got these today. They are no way 5xl. My upper arms are very large, and the images used are not accurate. They do have thumb holes which looked nice. Fabric is silky, nice and cool. Ended up with Grey, white, and thankfully black. However I won’t be able to keep these. The upper arm edging is also Not stretchy. So while it has the silicon non-slip, doesn’t do any good for me."
3.0,"Have purchased this brand/fit before in the same size. However, this fit more like a medium in the body and a large in the arms. Very strange fit. Completely different to the exact size and brand purchased at the store a month ago."
3.0,"I will have  to lose weight to really get a good fit on these. I ordered large  I probably should've ordered extra lodge, but every time I order these type of shirts large always fits. I'm 70, these are made for guys in their 20s"
3.0,"Loved these, but once we took them out of the package there were so many tiny holes. They looked great, hope they’re comfortable for others but for the price, to have holes upon arrival was a bummer"
3.0,Smaller than I was expecting but oh well. Still cute. Also wish the chain was longer. Decent quality tho
3.0,Have not worn it yet but I am 38C and  it fits ok<br />Feels a bit small. 3 stars because I don’t know yet.  Cld be a higher rating....The app mde me rate it
3.0,"Dress is beautiful, but the material is a bit too thin and it's not long enough like it shows on the pictures :( I'm 5'4 and size small is up my ankles, not floor length as I expected."
3.0,item itself is nice probably will look HOT by itself bare chested...if can ever figure out how to get it on!!! it was a tangled mess...took hours over a few<br />days to get it right...? still not sure...will keep at it until it's right!!!! that's the way I am...alot of people would give up...
3.0,Pedí un L y creo k era S
3.0,This shirt is short on me and I am only 5'3. It isn't like normal t-shirt sizes.  Normally a t-shirt in 2x would be too long for me .
3.0,I needed a boys size 6 so I ordered a small. It is easily the size of a normal size 8 shirt. Luckily I have enough time to reorder an XS.
3.0,"I always wash this with cold water on a delicate setting. After a few washes, it’s already started to pill. Very comfortable, though."
3.0,"The tapers themselves are okay. The do their job, and they look fine, though they drive me a little crazy because they are uneven - meaning that if you completed the circle, the ends would not meet up. The really negative thing is that the o rings don't stay on. One of mine fell down the sink drain on my second day wearing them. They can be worn without the rings, but they aren't as secure as they should be. Meh."
3.0,"They’re very comfortable and flattering for my body. But when you actually go to work out and bend over even in the slightest, they’re VERY see through."
3.0,"It really does hold a ton! Way more than I expected. It's not very comfortable to carry on your shoulder though. Also, it just looks like a normal duffle bag - no structure, flopped over. It got the job done."
3.0,It was a lot smaller than I expected
3.0,Would have been nice but to small around the waist.
3.0,Was shocked at the size.  when. the ad showed them to be so much larger.  they are pretty. but not so noticeable.. disappointed.
3.0,"Like the blouse. Fit me VERY well,except the sleeves. They are so thigh, it was difficult to take it off. Real linen, but thick, not luxurious. Style is very interesting, really pretty. Shorter than on model,because I am 5'7&quot;.<br />If the  sleeves were ok,probably will keep it.But again they are very uncomfortable. Quality is very nice.<br />Returning<br />I am size 16/18."
3.0,"The saddles shoes are exactly as represented in photos,however the souls are so slippery, I can not wear them safely. I am very disappointed not to wear them because I like them other than that. I have tried scuffing them on gravel, but it did not help. I wish they were the old fashion kind with the pinkish rubber souls.I would return them but have already had to return the size 7 for a 6 and it is darn pricey to continue to pay for shipping, at this rate I could buy another pair of these same shoes. Please keep that in mind when ordering. This will be the last time I attempt to buy shoes on amazon as third party shipping is too much."
3.0,Cute but if you are tall or have long legs this will likely be short on you
3.0,"This watch has a nice &#34;look&#34; and the sound is clear and loud enough.  We ordered it for my 93 year old blind Mother.  However, she is unable to press the button on the side to hear the time.  It is extremely hard to press and her fingers are not able to press it hard enough.  So disappointed."
3.0,nice novelty tie.
3.0,A thin linen shirt to lounge in- not for work nor dinner out. I will keep it for gardening. But will not order more :(
3.0,Super cute but uncomfortable. I bought the blue floral and the pink leaves one and it looks even cuter in person and it's flattering on. But it has undersides along the sides making it very uncomfortable. I'm a size 12/14 and got the 3xl which fit pretty good but the cup size was way too big for me so it exposed my chest. I wish I could wear it but I can't because it's too uncomfortable and not meant for smaller chests.
3.0,Fabric nice. If you order up to wear baggie it may be fine. However it's cut straight up. Fits waist perfect but can't button top buttons. If you have any lats it may be trouble.
3.0,"Too thick, it is not comfortable to wear."
3.0,"I like everything about the sock, except it is very small and I can bearly get it on my Men's size 11 foot.  In the size description, it says 'suitable for 6-9 Yards"". What the heck is that supposed to mean?"
3.0,"OK for wearing around,I like that they are soft w/some spandex & cotton. M is too big for me, i'll wash in hot then probably take in a few inches on the sides."
3.0,"This backpack, while convenient is definitely made a bit cheaply. It is supposed to be lightweight but it is made of a very thin material. It’s good for a quick day hike but I wouldn’t take it backpacking across the world"
3.0,"This review is based on comments made by my wife.  She was looking for a new handbag and it needed to be somewhat larger in size since she tends to carry a lot of stuff in it.  After looking at several handbags on Amazon, she decided she liked this one best.  She read the measurements and tried to use a tape measure to visualize the size of the bag.  She decided it was the right one for her and ordered it.  But when it came she was very disappointed.  While the bag looks fairly large in the picture, she found it to be rather small.  In fact, when I first took it out of the box for her she asked me if it was the included coin purse!  Like I would take that out first and then bring out the actual handbag.  When she saw it was the purse she wasn't a happy handbag buyer.  That kind of thing happens though.  Needless to say she had me send it back for her the next day.  I think it was a nice looking handbag and it seemed well constructed.  It just didn't meet her needs regarding the size."
3.0,"The plastic bar is a little too long so it doesnt sit nicely on my chest. It also feels cheap, but it looks like the picture"
3.0,Decent quality.  I wish that it had slots behind the hip pockets so that there was access to one’s own pants pockets.
3.0,Super cute dress but had a very strong smell when I took it out of the package. Took a few washes to get the smell out.
3.0,Great gift for my daughter.  She just wanted them to be separated because they tangle quickly.
3.0,Too slim. Quality is good
3.0,"This got 3 stars because the design is very close to the picture.  Where it falls short is in the fabric.  If you are expecting cotton, forget it.  65% Polyester and only 35% cotton - they claim.  I doubt the presence of cotton at all.  I did not read the description clearly enough so was very disappointed to get this shiny fabric.  You can't roll up the sleeves as the picture shows because it will just slip right back down.  I didn't plan to keep it as shiny polyester is not something I wear  (especially in 110 degree weather but was told that I would only get 20% of the price back on it ... you have to ship it back to the company.  Like I said, buyer beware."
3.0,Like the color and the suede quality. They do tend to get warmer compared to my other boots.
3.0,Starts to get fuzzy/pilling after a two washes.
3.0,Love the feel of the short but runs a little small.
3.0,This turned out to be much bigger than I expected. I wanted something small while on vacation.
3.0,Cute earring. The backs really suck. Use your own backs
3.0,"I haven’t decided if I am returning these yet. They are not as long as pictured, granted I am 5’9, but they were still shorter in the waist to crotch not just length. They also run small. I got the small but fits like an xs. They are cute though (and I only paid $6), and the material actually feels like linen instead of a cheaper material. Color is as pictured.<br />I would have given them five stars if they were bigger and longer!"
3.0,You can stretch these to your thighs but I'm afraid of ripping holes in the toe as soon as I walk around because the fabric is so thin!
3.0,"So I got mines  today,tried it on not very  Stretchy. I have big arm 17-18 in around. Some of those dont fit the same and they roll down also. If you a big guys dont not get this one."
3.0,"Logo is smaller than pictured, cheap looking stick on. Rather slow shipping."
3.0,"I do like the dress, but the fabric under the armpits around the chest is baggy. If you have big-girl boobs, you'll probably be okay (I'm a 34B). The dress will work for me, but I'll have to take in the sides a bit.<br /><br />I like the fabric; it's a heavy cotton spandex blend. The length is good (hits my knees--I'm 5'3&#34;).<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent casual-wear dress. If I ordered another one, I would try small instead of medium, hoping the smaller size would be less baggy in the chest."
3.0,"I received a different one than the one shown in the photo, the one I received is still cute and fits perfectly."
3.0,"It's OK. Material is heavy tee shirt material, not sweatshirt material. Plan on carrying small can of Static Guard, and check to make sure all stitching is secure. If you're OK with all that, it's OK."
3.0,They were a beautiful color!
3.0,It's comfortable but wear it as a night gown cuz thread has torn at top.
3.0,Does the job and the price is worth it.  i do wish it was a little thicker and the hoodie had a draw string.
3.0,Lovely color and feel on the outside. I don't like the material of the inside lining.
3.0,"These take a long time to change from shade to light, East too slow for bike riding where you’rein and out of the shade.  Maybe okay for running out other sports where you aren’t going from shade to sun quickly!"
3.0,Product does not fit as expected. Way too small if u need a large get xl etc.
3.0,"There isn't anything wrong with this shirt, honestly, but it's too plain for me to make an effort to dibs the right size. Certain people said to order a size up because their normal size didn't fit...but I know many women that aren't the size they actually say they are out of denial and self-consciousness.<br /><br />I think it's true to form (pun intended) but it is a fairly thin material, which has a propensity to be clingy, so I would recommend ordering a size up if you are the type to feel particularly self-conscious."
3.0,"When I received mine, the tassels were all curled up and bent and I’m not sure how to straighten them out. I thought it might be kind of cool but as I look at it I realize it’s basically $20 for three puff balls. Not worth it to me."
3.0,"This is definitely smaller than I expected. I should have looked at the size. It’s ok, but probably won’t last real long"
3.0,"I am very happy that I read the reviews before ordering.  I did go one size up, and the waist band is still a little too snug the be very comfortable."
3.0,I have a tiny hat.
3.0,"I like the richness of color and the conservative pattern. I bought 3 of same style.<br />Only issue  I have is not enough lining, where you can make a stiffer and fuller knot."
3.0,Receive as a gift. Beautiful but the clasp does not fit well.
3.0,Feels wrong
3.0,"It is really pretty and the material is very nice but this is too small and I can not fit all my hair in, because of that the cap will not stay on. My hair is thick curly shoulder length and I don't have a big head at all. I like the idea of this type of cap but I will look for one that is roomier."
3.0,"After a month of ordering this glasses, they broke and considering I did not abuse them There is not other reason than the poor quality excuse. Because of the short period the last me I would not recommend this sunglasses at all."
3.0,"I really liked the way it fit, but it was alarmingly green. I retuned it because it’s not my thing, but perhaps it is for someone else.<br />The medium fit perfectly though."
3.0,"The dress is really pretty my only complaints are it's a side zip and it's a real pain to do up yourself because of the angle and the material is really flimsy, feels like an umbrella."
3.0,The shirt is very cute however you can not wear it off the shoulder it’s false advertising
3.0,It's a good fit for the watch but the leather is a little stiff.  I've worn the watch for 3 days and thought the strap would be more flexible by now.  I'll keep breaking it in.  The strap looks lovely with the watch and I really like the two loops which keep the strap end nice and neat.
3.0,I have this dress in 3 other colors  .. this is the sheerest  and fits differently
3.0,I ordered a size too big and it is still incredibly too snug.
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes up. Still very tight
3.0,"I ordered my normal dress size; 8, but this was much too big in the stomach area and shoulder area. This dress is also VERY LONG which I understand as I read that in previous comments. Beautiful as it was and arrived on time in pristine condition; I had to send it back as it simple would require too much work to alter it. It also had a heavy material; too heavy and drapey looking on me probably because it was too big. Maybe I would recommend ordering a size down from what is normally purchased. I’m also about 5”3 and had four and a half inch heels on and it was still dragging in the back, not pleasantly but like a trip hazard. This dress would be great for tall folks."
3.0,"I bought this to go to the Millenium Concert so it definitely fit the bill, and I love the color and material, but the top smh the top was so small compared to the bottom. I mean the bottoms fit perfectly, well while standing. When you sit they will be very high. But the tops sleeves are way to short. I wore it once but definitely going to goodwill now. Not completely disappointed especially for the price and what I needed it for but wish I would have spent more on something that I could where long term."
3.0,They are a little tight and just a bit to small. Other than that I like them.
3.0,"Pretty color and they feel nice but watch out, pants shrunk after only a few washings!"
3.0,It took me awhile to get them on - so far so good. The ones that came with my glasses are too hard and hurt me after awhile.<br /><br />The only problem is they come off very easily. I already lost one.I wish they would stay on.
3.0,Did not expect dress to arrive totally wrinkled condition.
3.0,"This is definitely quite minimalist, thin and small.<br />But it's pretty much a money clip with a compartment put together with a elastic band for credit cards.<br />It's a bit awkward to use and quickly take cards out. If you don't have too many credit cards and like a money clip with something extra, this might be for you."
3.0,"I like the ring, but the print is really poor quality, I used for short time and the letters are already fading. Disappointed."
3.0,"Looks just like the pic, but very thin material on top. See thru"
3.0,It was true to fit but a bit shorter than the picture and the material was shiny😩.  Cotton more comfortable in this heat.
3.0,Loved the romper except the light color is see through and shows all my cellulite. Returned for the black one
3.0,I ordered this in an XL Because the model is very petite and I am what Freddie Mercury would call a round bottom girl ;) So the suit comes in and it fits. HOWEVER it is VERY revealing (side boob and prerty much my entire booty out). It also came down low in the front. It was Ill fitting on me. It's a bummer bc the the color was so vibrant! Recommend this for a thin frame or a very fit chick.
3.0,"Got this for my teenage daughter.  She normally wears a size small, and going by the size chart even a 36” bust should fit, (it would not) she would be a small, but I ordered a size up and am glad I did.  This dress does not stretch at all.  It is tight in the arms and she is a skinny little thing.  When she raises her arms the whole dress goes up several inches.  She can barely cross her arms.  It is definitely just a costume style dress, as this would not be comfortable to wear on a normal day.  Maybe not even for trick or treating, since it’s hard to raise the arms.  The rest of the dress fit normally.  There are buttons on the sleeves which are okay as long as someone else can button them for you as the sleeves are too tight to do the buttons one handed.  The fabric isn’t scratchy, but it doesn’t really feel nice either."
3.0,It is very attractive but very large for a women’s fitness watch.  Too big to be very wearable. I would love a version a third smaller
3.0,Super cute but way to short for me. Probably would fit if I had a smaller booty haha. Bummed I have to return it.
3.0,"Good mask, but it doesn't really fit a female all that well. I would have liked it much better if it had a better way to tie the mask. It has a ribbon tie that comes loose after a short period of time so you have to repeatedly re-tie the mask. If the plastic front had been a little more flexible and it had a better way to tie the mask I would have liked it a lot better."
3.0,"Went by the size chart. Ordered several dresses for the young women in  a show choir group. All were too large in the shoulder and the material wrinkles easily. The wrap top is ill-fitting. They hang very flat.  They look much better with a petticoat. Pretty from afar but the top looked awkward on the girls up close. We ordered a range of sizes from small to XXL. Every single one needed alteration to the shoulder, waist and bust."
3.0,Proportions were off. Didn't fit well.
3.0,This Luke Bryan mask looks nice and seems soft and breathable when I tried it on. It has adjustable straps and an insert area for a filter (no filter came with it). Those with narrow faces may find it too big. I haven't worn it yet because it came late and past what I wanted to wear it for.  Recommend if you are an LB fan and you want to wait awhile.
3.0,Nice shirt gave it a 3 star because it looks longer in picture
3.0,Good quality. The headband was a little small and the tail was shorter than I expected.
3.0,The paddings inside are small and shaped alittle wierd. Good price though
3.0,They look nice so I’ll give them that. Also a great price. Unfortunately they are very uncomfortable where the bottom straps connect to the back of the flip flop. The foot rubs right over each side of the strap. Not sure how they would fix that?
3.0,Colors look exactly like the picture. The top and sleeves are tighter than expected.Overall I like the shirt and have had several compliments.
3.0,"I'm a 10 and initially ordered a L; shipped that back because it was way too small. The XL was no better, so that's going back too. Cute dress, but sizing was not accurate in the Rose."
3.0,I like the band and it's comfortable but the edges snag clothing and it's unavoidable so beware. I had to stop using it.
3.0,They're Beautiful... however the stones between the thighs were caught on each other and ripped them!
3.0,Bought according to their size chart. Fabric was nice
3.0,material didn't fall softly on me clug too much
3.0,GREAT COLOR BUT TOO THINK...
3.0,"Fabric and cut was lovely, unfortunately waist line is to high"
3.0,As far as seeing goes these are great. Just don't look as good in person a they do here
3.0,Cute but runs small...
3.0,I liked the pattern but the fit was weird and it was see through.
3.0,Silky and cute. It will not stay on all night. Bought this to help keep my curls at night but always woke up with it having fallen off.
3.0,"This suit was advertised as Long Torso, but it didn't say that on the inside label. It felt too short AND tight to be the size I ordered. No adjustments on the straps either.  It was posted as a $63 suit, but more like the cheap ones that come from China.  My last suit from China lasted only 3 months.<br />It was too much trouble to ship back & I'd already thrown the packaging away by the time I tried to wear it. I'll keep it since I got it on sale, & use it as a back-up as I go to our indoor pool 3-4 times a week, but I'll be more careful next time in ordering."
3.0,The jewels fell out real easy. It was real beautiful but i did not get to wear it long because I was afraid to lose any more stones. I do have it in my collection though of stones i can use.
3.0,Pretty but they are not worth it they are really easy to break and they are like a plasticy material but you do you I guess
3.0,"I like the fabric & colors, but it is strangling tight.  I'll cut it in half & remake it based on another item as a pattern."
3.0,It came with a scratch. Not noticeably unless you look close but I know it's there. It also wasnt as big as I hoped.
3.0,If youre gonna get these pants get a size larger from what you usually wear
3.0,"Got S and fit true to size, i'm 4 or 6 in lulu. Material and quality feels nice."
3.0,"strap was a little too long for my small wrists, and the pins that were included were shorter than the original pins in my watch, which allowed the strap to come off occasionally."
3.0,"Although the footbed is really cushy, the zstrap model was a little tight for my feet.  So I traded in for the thong-style and those are perfect for me.  I wear a size 8.5 womans, M was the correct size in terox."
3.0,Are they supposed to feel tight? My toes feel really tight? Can I exchange them? I am a size 9.5 in women.
3.0,The print design on the bottom half of the dress is pretty but the overall look is kind of dumpy.  The top is not well done at all.
3.0,I ordered these for a wedding and the only thing was that they came in different colors of yellow one is significantly lighter than the other one.
3.0,I found the necklace very small and  more suitable for a child.
3.0,Really nice dress. Bought it for my mom but it wasn't her style. But it was a beautiful dress as well.
3.0,"Good for the price, kind of large. I'm a 5.5, usually medium."
3.0,Beautiful and soft but for their size very small.  Plus no paperwork came with them so returning was not an option.  I gave them to a local shelter.
3.0,"I loved the color and design. However, the shirt is way too short in length for a pregnant belly. It should be longer in back and especially front. It's still wearable for me at 7 months though. Also, the material is very thin and almost see thru. I don't mind because i live in Florida. I've ordered from this company before and the elastic maternity stitching on the sides is very loose and could use definite improvement to make them more &#34;true&#34; maternity shirts. But the shirt is pretty and if you just need it to wear a few times for special occasions it is fine. I still like mine and plan to wear it."
3.0,"The fit from the bust through the waist is very small. The off the shoulder straps are also very tight and small so they dug into my arms and did not look flattering. Because of that fit, the skirt portion of the dress bulged out a bit and did not look like an A-line skirt. The color is a bit more on the beige side than pink. The fabric is not scratchy but definitely more on the rough side."
3.0,I have bought 6 of these glasses - 2 orders.  2 pair have broken in half.
3.0,"I bought this a year and a half ago as a daily use bag. I used it basically as a purse with no heavy objects. However, it broke today: the stitches to the part that holds one of the metal loops that the strap is clipped to ripped and I find myself having to find a replacement. While I was using it, I really enjoyed this bag, but if you want it to last years and years, this might not be it."
3.0,I am 5'5 and 170lb at 33 weeks pregnant. The dress would have been perfect but it was too short. Hit right above my ankles. I ordered a medium. The material was super nice and soft but I ended up returning the dress due to the length.
3.0,"The belly ring doesn't look the same as the picture. The color is different, its still a nice belly ring but it has an old copper tone color to it and not as beautiful at all."
3.0,It lost shape and would not regain it even after dry cleaning.
3.0,The arms were super tight!
3.0,"Although the sizing seems right, something in the &#34;high top&#34; pattern does not allow for my Son's foot to go all the way in...unless he &#34;pushes down&#34; which, you can imagine is tough to &#34;convince&#34; an 11month old to do.<br />So cute though!!<br />Got dirty in one day use at daycare...<br />Would suggest  for prewalkers...not learners...sole has no cushion."
3.0,"Its ok, but it has weird cups. They stick out a little on me and I am a B cup. It looked a little off with the dress I was going to wear."
3.0,it is a new experience for me. I am still learning how to wear these cuffs. it will take time.
3.0,Ordered an extra large but it is very small for an XL. It's the largest size offered. They won't allows me to return or exchange it. Very disappointed with this seller.
3.0,I ordered a large and had to give it to my 13 year old niece. It looks fantastic on her.
3.0,A little disappointed thought it was a better quality and the bottom was sheer. Picture show it flowing but it did not. Picture is misleading
3.0,Love the film. Bought the shirt. Size large is actually US medium. Fabric quality is typical for these unlicensed merch shirts: it gets rougher and stiffens in the wash instead of softening.
3.0,"Looks too yellow, but very sturdy and well made"
3.0,These took a long time for delivery. The larger ball is very very large. Almost oddly large. Not sure how long they will last. But overall ok for price
3.0,Not quite what I expected. Material is stiff n doo rag is difficult to keep on the head when riding.
3.0,"Fit tighter than what I was expecting. I wanted something much looser and I got a small. I'm 5'4&#34;, 130 lbs, and have an athletic build. I also tend to be in between a small and a medium for everything. So, if you want it to be baggier, order a size up."
3.0,"It’s a basic, small shopping bag."
3.0,"I liked the material of the shirt and the pattern however, the length of the shirt was too short and the neck line of the shirt was made strange. I normally wear a Medium to Large. I purchased a Medium. The shirt barely tucked in to my high waisted jeans. I wore this out to a bar and had to constantly adjust the top. It's supposed to be a cowl neck however the shirt kept rising at the neck line instead of drooping as a cowl neck top should."
3.0,"Very cute jacket, but the sizing is way small. I am a large I ordered an xl for a loose fit, and I couldn't get it around my shoulders. Sent it back."
3.0,"Bought this cap thinking it came with some patches, for the price I paid I could have gotten a name brand cap for a lower price."
3.0,"In all, I think the designs of the shoes were great but I find it too tight and difficult to wear on my child. I liked the idea of the stretchable shoe laces but it needs a bit of effort to put on all the way. I would rather choose a strap with velcro when choosing for my son’s next pair of shoes. I bought these because you can’t beat the price and the designs were fashionable."
3.0,Real leather band great for a watch band
3.0,"I ordered a Large and although it is labeled as a large, it is too small. I have a medium build and like oversized t-shirts. This one is a little too tight for comfort but the shirt itself is good quality."
3.0,"Nice little sweater. My grandson loved it, although he was only 4 and small at that, he was swimming in the 4-7 size. The only thing this company can do is perhaps add a personalization aspect where they put the number and name of your choosing on the back. Had I done that for my grandson, he would have been thrilled. I would not have minded to pay for that at all. Overall its good quality, and it looks great, however one thing that could be done better, NHL sweaters DO NOT have ink stamped logos. They could have stitched one on for the price. This they did not do, so I cannot give this 4 stars for the price."
3.0,"First of all, this dress runs big. I like it, but I ordered the smallest size, and it was still a little big. There is a lot of stretch to the fabric, too, so I would recommend sizing down if you can. Second the belt is worthless. The button loops both broke as I was trying to unbutton them before even putting the belt on for the first time. So that went straight to the trash. I am not super sold on the fit of the dress itself. It looks a little strange, but I desperately needed a funeral dress, so it will have to do. It is an adequate dress, but a little pricey for what it is."
3.0,I ordered a large one base on the other reviews but it is too big for me.
3.0,Cute but balls fall off easily. I already lost one an only had it in for few hours..
3.0,Very cute. Too expensive for a bag that is loosing sequins and fraying on the edge of the flap n essential than a month. Dissspointing.
3.0,"The material is very stretchy & breatheable.  The issue for me is that they bunch around the knees, and yes they are pulled up properly.  I really like the pattern of these, so I’m a bit bummed out about it.  I noticed, as well, that they don’t wick sweat as well as other brands."
3.0,These are so cute on. I gave three stars because if you drop them the frame breaks. This is my 3rd pair.
3.0,"I expected the material to be thicker, but it wasn't. Very disappointed."
3.0,"It is very pretty. Just enough design to be elegant. It broke the second time wearing it, a piece of the chain broke by the latch. I was able to fix it, so I am still wearing it. I received many compliments when wearing it."
3.0,"The dress has a nice, classic fit.  Stretch Lace - kinda neat.  However, the dress shows obvious signs that someone had returned it and now I'm at least the second owner. Yuck.  There were no &#34;tags&#34; attached to the dress itself, which was my first clue.  But then the brand name tag on the collar is dirty, the inside collar shows signs of makeup, and the front of the dress looks like someone tried to iron it because the material is shiny. It would be nice if I could be sent a replacement - it's disappointing to say the least."
3.0,Came with snags and threads pulled. Almost feel like the socks you get from dollar tree but in nice colors.
3.0,Ordered a pink and got a peach still keeping it cuz it is still nice even though I really wanted the pink
3.0,Love the quality but very tight inside
3.0,"This are so cute. I got so many compliments on these earrings. However, the metal part that goes in your ear bends really easy. It does bend back, so it doesn’t affect much."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this split dress, several things I didn't like upon receiving it. There is a line in the front of the dress, that seems to me like you have it on backwards. The material is shiny silky looking almost reminds you of night wear. The dress gives my body no shape. It fit very weird, the first time I tried it in a XL. Too big, then I tried a L the opening in the front gave me this weird appearance, it was long where the split started, it came down mid thigh on me. It was not appealing on my frame. The material is stretchy but also clingy at the same time."
3.0,This folding sunglasses and the case I lover it I wan't loose it it's compact so I can put it in my purse<br />Thanks
3.0,I am returning the product.<br />It was too small and the fabric wasn't strech so it was difficult to walk.
3.0,"For me,it's to narrow"
3.0,Bought a medium... Fits big
3.0,"The underwear fit fine, but as soon as you wash them the elastic starts to come out and get too tight. Wasn’t impressed at all."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:40cb1d4aaa84286b5327d048bffed0e2]] I like this product. Sizing is WAY off. I wear a medium in many items. Prefer a large for roominess. But this should have been XL to 1X by China standards. I have the large pictured.
3.0,"Cute sweatshirt but the print is not as vibrant as the picture, not even close."
3.0,"Listen to the reviews. I ordered a small. It's a bit loose. I'm 5'5"" and 118. An x small would have been perfect. Unfortunately I needed it sooner rather than later so I cant return it and will have to make do. VERY comfy material tho! Boning in the rib/breast area is very comfy! Would buy similar products from this provider."
3.0,"This outfit is cute and well made, but WOAH, ITS GIGANTIC! The package says 0-6mo, however that is only if you have delivered a 10lb. Newborn. The size looks more like an 18mo. Outfit. The picture they post on amazon is a gross misrepresentation of the actual size you will be getting.  The length to width ratio on the shirt is also not appropriate. The onesie would be too short by the time the child is girthy enough to wear it. I added a picture of this outfit next to a normal newborn outfit."
3.0,"Like folks said, some didn't work, would flicker or come on and off them back on then off..  It did serve the purpose, depends on how many you need to work!"
3.0,"I liked these very much so purchased two more pair; however, this pair strap broke????  Can’t repair it.  I’m going to see if they can refund or send another pair or just the left sandal.  Geez disappointing"
3.0,"I love the purse, but it smells so bad they don't s no way I can use it.  I've been letting it air out for two weeks. I've tried cleaning it with leather cleaner and soap and water, but it's still terrible."
3.0,"The wallet was returned.  Not an improvement over what I have.<br /><br />That front see through compartment is too small to hold any kind of standard size ID or card.  The snap to hold that flap with the front see through compartment and one internal see through compartment does not seem to provide any advantage.  It gets in the way and contributes to the overall bulkiness of the wallet.  You don't really need to snap that flap closed anyway so the snap is not needed.<br /><br />The paper money compartments are barely long enough to hold US paper currency.<br /><br />The two internal see through compartments are a good size.  You can put one ID behind another one in those compartments.<br /><br />The coin compartment did seem useful, but it contributed to the overall bulkiness of the wallet."
3.0,"I ordered mediums and very petite, shirts sizes run small."
3.0,Kinda disgusting after riding how much moisture builds up in the padding.  Was very self conscious after I sat on a stool and it looked like I peed myself.
3.0,Not as &#34;No Show&#34; as you would expect. Great for sneakers not so much with loafers
3.0,"I was so stoked for this cardigan, the style is true, the color is beautiful, but sadly it is definitely not as long or oversized a fit as appears on site images, it only goes to XL which I ordered so I can't even size up"
3.0,Love the sunglasses- but the screws have already had to be tightened multiple times. I’m hoping the arms don’t break off! I take very good care of all of my sunglasses and these were loose the moment I opened the package. Bummer!
3.0,Cute but very big
3.0,Not the best earrings. But not the worst. Just ok. Would not gift
3.0,It fit me really great
3.0,"My fiancee' loved this bracelet as a gift for Christmas of 2018 and he just recently moved to the US Virgin Island in January of 2019; he wore it as a constant reminder of our love and promise of each others unity in life! He doesn't have his prized possession any more due to the weak clasp that this bracelet has and has lost it shortly after our arrival in US Virgin Islands! It is a hurtful thing when you use your heart to find the perfect gift for The Love Of Your Life, he falls in love w/ the gift that was found and then it is lost because of a defective part of the gift! He is sadden by its loss here on the Island and I am deeply saddened by it's lost as well; given how I felt so accomplished of finding this perfect gift for him! I love this product and so did he, but the clasp of this bracelet could have been made more sturdy for the male arm and his wear daily!"
3.0,It is very cheap looking. Perfect for a kid but not really an adult
3.0,I expected this bracelet to be little bit noticeable on my wrist but it's too tiny. It  looks like just a chain.
3.0,"So heavy...Very heavy to wear, and bulky if you want that kind of robe."
3.0,I was SO excited for this top. I normally wear a large so I ordered an extra large because I wanted it to be loose. The extra large is really tight. It's way smaller than any XL I've tried on. It is really pretty in person though.
3.0,"It's a cute case, and only cost me a couple dollars...however,  it did slide off my lap and onto a carpeted floor, and just from that it got cracked on the bottom corner. I'd be more upset if I had paid more but since it was so cheap it's no big deal. It's a nice decoration for your phone, definitely not for protective purposes. Also, when you are putting the case on, you have to do it carefully...the plastic that the case is made out of is quite flimsy. Not a bad buy for the price. Just keep in mind it will Crack from the slightest impact."
3.0,"The hat is good quality. The problem is the adjustable velcro strap in the back. It's difficult to keep well adjusted and often grabs your hair. A hat of this quality should be size specific or stretch to fit. The time of the plastic strap, with the little studs that would break off eventually, is over. The time of the velcro strap in back is over.  There are plenty of hats out there that prove we can do better now."
3.0,Theres no hood or pocket BUT IT VERY COMFY!!
3.0,"Overall very nice. Be aware that the snaps are all plastic. I broke one within weeks of wearing. fits well, has a stretchy adjustment band, it even fitted my big head. All the components of the hat are easily removed and added. Will I buy another? Only time and usage will determine that."
3.0,Not very well made. Okay to wear around the house. Back potion has too much hang. Ties in the scarf are very short.
3.0,Bummer for a gift!
3.0,Not oversized.. Im just sayin
3.0,I ❤  the sweater although it wasn't long like I had hoped for.Still cute
3.0,This dress was super cute but it was way too small.
3.0,"Just okay, wouldn’t buy it again."
3.0,"I like that is attractive when on, I like the style.  It appears to be well made, and is comfortable.  I wore it in my pool only one time and the back of my hair got wet even though I have short hair and it completely tucked<br />under the cap. So I have returned the item"
3.0,The stone is beautiful but the chain is very thin and the clasp broke the first time I tried to open it.
3.0,They get caught in my hair all the time. They sometimes get really uncomfortable but they do keep my glasses on so that when I look down they don’t fall off. I love the fact that they come with so many because I tend to lose then when I pull my glasses off and they get caught in my hair.
3.0,Arrived broken. But too late to do anything about it as it was a present that arrived just in time
3.0,"The pants are okay. I prefer the Harbor Bay Relaxed Fit, but they were out of stock. Good deep pockets and they are comfortable so they work. They could however use a belt loop closer to the zipper, one on each side."
3.0,"These lenses fit very well in the Oakley frames. The filtered view is in in the cool spectrum. One odd thing is they the light mirrored surface is on *both* sides of the lenses, so you get occasional glare when light shines from behind."
3.0,It did not come with the pencil case or lunch box.
3.0,The dress is nice but inappropriate for my purpose so I returned it. It did fit fine on although it appeared to skew very junior.
3.0,not bad but too small of a material
3.0,"I'm 5'4 and I ordered a large, these are short on me. I wanted a good pair of sweatpants that I could lounge in, but the second I sit down they either ride up my calves or fall down cause theres not a lot of coverage up top."
3.0,Too big on the bottom half.
3.0,It's somewhat large
3.0,Very cute but I would order a size up unless you want everyone to see every curve of your flab.
3.0,The dress is soft but the S size is to big. I am 5'3/ 117 pounds but this S size is big for me.
3.0,Too large! I'm usually an XL and it fits way too big!
3.0,These are adorable. However I wish  the buckles were a different color.
3.0,Size and material of product as expected. Color is nowhere near what I ordered. I wanted the dark gray and ended up with some sort of washed out light purple color.
3.0,Great design and many convenient compartments. The big flaw is the leather is easily scratched making it look cheep after a few uses.
3.0,Cute but did nothing for my figure. Also it was a tad too small I ordered a L. I’m 5’2” 145 lbs 36B
3.0,Was a little unhappy that the skull is so so so  tiny you cant tell its even there just a tiny white dot
3.0,My daughter loves this jewelry.
3.0,"I have a large head, earloops don't stay on for me unless I pull the back down really far. Very tight fitting for a larger person."
3.0,Didn't fit my watch but I was not surprised.
3.0,It is ivery difficult to put these on and also to take off.
3.0,"green lits come offf,wearing or put in dryer."
3.0,"I ordered these for my 18 month old to wear on an upcoming beach trip.  He has very wide, chunky feet that never fit in sandals, slides, or flip flops.  I thought these may work better for him.  I ordered a size up from what he normally wears and they were still too narrow, even though they were too long.  The band that goes around the ankle was way too tight.  I returned them."
3.0,"Very pretty, but my ears are sore after I wear them."
3.0,The hat is as described in the reviews. A little cheap but still cute! Came smashed flat but still wearable. Just not my best look. Still think the hat is cute.
3.0,"Item will not stay up,  too loose."
3.0,"these may shrink, but as you can see, they are called &#34;women's ankle socks&#34; but they seem like men's"
3.0,Sizing is good for a replacement (I’m on smaller side.) However after a few months the metal clasp part came loose and I couldn’t adjust the band anymore without the clasp part coming off almost every time.
3.0,"I liked them, but they were to big."
3.0,"The style is super cute, but it’s fits smaller than expected, I would size up at least 1 size, if not 2. There is no stretch at all!"
3.0,I really love the order very beautiful
3.0,"I really loved this dress, it fit well from the waist down, but the medium was too big for me. I had read some reviews about ordering a size up, and I shouldn't have done that. Also, the reason for the 3 star was that the stitching around the center of the neckline wasn't stitched right and was crooked. I am hoping that I can order a new one in time for the wedding I got it for."
3.0,"Nice looking shorts , But they fit a bit too small for shorts  x large ."
3.0,"They are tight, but they are not as form fitting as I had hoped. I was wanting more of a pouch to hold everything separate from my legs."
3.0,"Pros:<br />- Fits proportions well (I'm 5'10, 175lb and I bought the large)<br />- soft fabric<br />- the lace overlay is very pretty<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The fabric underneath is YELLOW (see my picture of lining next to a black and white polka dot dress). It makes the coloring of the whole dress off! The amazon picture makes it seem white (and better).<br />- isn't a very flattering A-line fit<br /><br />Overall, I don't know if I'm going to keep it... but maybe you will have a more flattering fit!"
3.0,"I found the quality of workmanship rather poor on the pair that I received.  You could see a shiny residue on the leather near the rubber sole from the glue.  These just aren't a nicely made shoe like the Umi shoes.  My daughter will only were them for short periods of time before asking to have them removed, so I presume she doesn't find them terribly comfortable.<br /><br />As a positive, I do appreciate that the ankle strap slides easily in it's metal loop as you extend the strap to get the shoe on and off.  I've experienced many mary janes that have the metal loop so tight on the strap that it doesn't allow the strap to slide far enough out to comfortably get the foot in or out. The shoe and sole seem to be of good flexibility, not too rigid.<br /><br />These shoes are okay if you get them at a sale price, but at present, I have no intentions of ever purchasing Beeko again.  I'll stick with Umi."
3.0,"The dress was beautiful.  Many compliments.  However, it was a cream color and not gold.  It also had zipper issues but we worked around it.  Dress was used for the Bridgerton Ball."
3.0,"You have to mess with the wire part and kind of pinch it to get it to stay.  Doesn't do well as is, but once you get it right they look great! lol"
3.0,"This shirt felt prefect and looked amazing. I love the material, the only problem is that after one wear the bottom of the shirt became undone and I am sure that due to the amount of thread that has come out of the bottom seam, I will not be able to wash this shirt and wear it again."
3.0,"Nice for the price, but cheap looking overall.  Simple silver design.  The chain seems a little shorter on me compared to the picture."
3.0,"Super cute and great quality!! Just runs a little large, so if you’re in between sizes, go down."
3.0,Love the quality and the design and the strength of the material. Look and feel of great quality.
3.0,It is very pretty but it came broken.  Hopefully I can get someone to fix it.
3.0,Panties are soft and the top of the panties are very supportive. I am normally between a size M and L. I ordered an XL. They are too small on me. I should have ordered the XXL. The sizes are based off China sizes. If you live in America you need to go up at least 2 sizes to get a good fit.
3.0,I usually wear a size 6 and can go small or medium. The small was WAY too tight on my stomach. Especially for sleepwear. The material was also more stretchy and not as soft as I thought. I was hopeful since it was a great price and looked good.
3.0,"The elastic around the waist is a bit tight for my liking, I'm still debating keeping them because of this, otherwise these are really cute."
3.0,It looks small. Very thin. This jewelry can't get wet. It change the color.
3.0,"The clasp is wicked tricky. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. My daughter won’t wear it because of this."
3.0,Didn't like the material. Fits small
3.0,"I love the look and size of the watch face and the narrow band.  I've only worn it once, so don't have extended experience yet.  The band is very cheap and a bit of the edge of the material was already coming unglued right out of the package.  But for the price, I think it's worth it.  Hopefully it will keep running for a long time.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I wore the watch only 3 times and the metal buckle broke off already.  I still really like the watch itself.  In comparing it with watches at the department store, I like the pearl-essence face and the color and size of the numbers and frame that other watches don't have.  I'm now trying to find a replacement band."
3.0,I returned these. Quality seemed ok but fit was horrible. X-large would not fit over palm area of my hand. If you have very long fingers and a very narrow hands these are for you. Also are more like light weight gloves than Glover liners.
3.0,Decent tank tops. Poor quality stitching though. A few seems have already torn but I would buy again for the price.
3.0,"the mask is thick, but it's small."
3.0,"Skirt is very long, I'm 5'10, and this skirt is past my ankles. I was expecting an above the ankle skirt. Material is fine for what it is and doesn't seem to be see through, but just doesn't have the look as pictured. Its more of a maxi style skirt on me."
3.0,"I like the price point, but you get what you pay for it feels cheap and would assume it won't last long. This will be my back up to the back up. 3rd string isn't that bad...."
3.0,If your in the US order two sizes bigger. These are like Asian sizes. Nice product If it would have fit
3.0,Too long if your 5'4
3.0,"Very pretty, reflects the sunlight beautifully!"
3.0,"The fabric does not have much stretch, so it's pretty uncomfortable when you are pulling it over your face. You have to really drag it over your face to get it on. It will mess up makeup and hair due to this. It is a thick fleece material, so it would be good to keep out the cold and dirt if on trails or anyplace with dust. It had a pull string to tighten it so it won't fall, which is a big plus, but they are cheaply made and the string broke the first time I tried to adjust it. It's a good concept but needs improvement. I ended up returning mine due to the downfalls.<br /><br />If my review was helpful please click helpful"
3.0,"They have a weird fitting. Based on the product recommendation I bought the Large size. I normally wear size 10 in jeans/pants. If I wear this shorts without a belt, they feel as if they are dancing in your body while you move, they don't feel comfortable."
3.0,"Pretty jewel but just cheap, product never stayed in,  the jewel always twisted off"
3.0,These do not have the neoprene uppers like in the picture.
3.0,"Love the shorts except: seams come apart...at pockets, crotch, at legs, fabric fades/washes in weird way. Still, love the concept...long inseam, many pockets..."
3.0,"I really love the look of these boots and they are just a fun event type of shoe for me. The only thing is, no matter how tight i tie them, they loosen and slouch down and one of the heels is crooked making it harder to walk in already hard to walk in shoes. But they were cheap."
3.0,These feel a little bigger than I'm used to and they are very warm to wear. I guess it's the type of material. Feel thicker and not as much air flow as I like.
3.0,some of the lights are not working
3.0,It fit okay no problems there. Got this because normal rings don’t fit around my lip due to the placement I got this hoping it would work. While it did fit okay and I loved the look after one day of wear my lip was swollen and may not have liked whatever this piece of jewelry was made of. And on top of that when I removed it from the piercing hole to the top of my lip inside of my mouth was an impression of the bar and it took an hour or so to go away.<br /><br />So while the jewelry looks good and fits good for me personally it didn’t work out. But hopefully it works for others
3.0,"I wear a 42, I ordered a 44 so there would be some room. They are more like a size 36. I have never had a size so far off before."
3.0,Shorts are much shorter than shown in photos. Sized too small
3.0,Got this for my friend for Christmas. It was so cute and she loved it. The only downfall is after a couple weeks of wear the chain broke off which was super lame. Now she just wears the feather. So if you are going to buy this make sure you're not planning on wearing it every day like she did/does.
3.0,"Very cute, but runs very small closer to the 2T -small 3T in height. My boy wears 3t pants and 4t tops, and we had to get this altered to add 3-4in"
3.0,Nice mittens but not nearly as thick as we thought or how the picture looks.
3.0,Use it now and again.  Not as tight as I thought is would be.
3.0,Looks nice but zippers were tough to open and close.
3.0,"I thought the material was going to be different. Overall, I still liked it. Looks nice on. Best of all, you can dress it up or down. Only drawback is that the elastic is a bit tight and you have to constantly pull it down after sitting."
3.0,i bought a small and it came super tight so maybe if you like your clothes a bit more loose go a size bigger
3.0,Viene muy pequeña para un joven de 15 años.
3.0,"Loved this shirt, except for the sleeves. The elastic is a bit tight and tends to rub your arms raw, when worn."
3.0,Wayyy too big I’m returning it
3.0,"I have D cup and this bra is definitely kinda small. Its ok, because its slight, but it is also doesnt lift big breasts, but unite them together. And this sticky cups... not very nice feeling. After wearing you need to find safe box for them too, and put thin pieces of plastic in between, otherwise it sticks to everything and its sort of pain in the ass too. The idea is wonderful, but I probably will think if i buy this again."
3.0,The watch was listed as a mens watch but was womens size.<br />Also the hands would not work
3.0,"Had to assemble out of the box as the nuts had fallen off all the screws.  Luckily they didn't fall out.  Once assembled, they are nice glasses.  I wish I knew what I did with them..."
3.0,Be aware there nit the same color as pictured they are darker.. Dont really like It. I have the skinnest calves ever so if you have big calves they prob will be a little snug..  😐 on the side is a head band that was supposed to be a color blend of those too but was alot darker then expected ugly color i can wear with brown boots cuz there ugly and almost brown  . Im not happy.
3.0,"I wear a size 11 shoe and these socks (1 size fit all) are a little tight.<br /><br />One other thing to consider is that if the back of your foot above the heal tends to blister easy, these socks may be too short as they do not prevent rubbing of my shoe.  I don't count that as a flaw in the sock, just a personal oversight and my rating is based only on the fact that one size doesn't always fit all."
3.0,Very pretty but seems to run about two sizes too small. I ordered a XL and it fit like a med.
3.0,"Very comfortable, as you would expect from Asics.  The tongue part of the shoe spits in half, which makes it very easy to take on and off.  Not so sure about the shiny red, though.  It looks cool on the screen, but IRL, just looks goofy."
3.0,"Customer service was good, I received the shoes and found them difficult to get on, and once on, it felt like hard needles pressing in the sole of my feet.<br />I returned them and received a prompt refund.  If you have sensitive feet I wouldn't recommend these."
3.0,It's cute. Not sure about how long it will hold up though.
3.0,"I've had this band for about 9 months, and it looks great. But there are a few definite downsides. The two posts on either side of the tracker cage DO NOT stay screwed in. They fall out on a regular basis and have to be screwed in with a tiny phillips head screwdriver (think eyeglass repair size). I would suggest putting a drop of superglue on the threads before screwing it back in black-- this will hold it for at least a while. Second, a few months ago it started oxidizing and/or the finish started wearing off (not sure which it is).  Obviously, for the price, I didn't expect too much. I don't actually mind the way this looks. But it's now at the point where, within a couple of hours of putting it back on in the morning (I take it off to shower and leave it off while I'm getting ready), I have a giant green spot on my wrist. Like, half-dollar size. People have started asking me if I'm ""okay""-- as in, am I being abused or grabbed roughly. No, it's just the cheap bracelet! I'm not necessarily going to get rid of this any time soon (I think I'm going to try a coating of clear polish on the back of cage to see if that helps), but it's definitely something to know before buying."
3.0,"This is a super cute top that fits well...HOWEVER, it isn’t even close to being a loose top that would fall off the shoulder if you wanted too (like the picture suggests). It stops right below the stomach with a tiny bit of stretch."
3.0,"Clock dials should be different in color from the background,<br />It is difficult to see what time it is."
3.0,"Too big for such small space and divisions. I returned it.<br /><br /> I own a zip around wallet with much divisions  ans smaller than this one ( mine is 7.5 x 4 inches), 2 outside zippers, 1 inside zipper, 6 credit card slots that fit 2 credit card each because it is true leather and it stretches, and 5 bill compartments, this is a Perlina wallet that I love and nothing can reach and match such capacity."
3.0,The fit was fine and pants were ok. I didn’t quite like the material felt too thin and I was afraid it wouldn’t hold up against repeated washing
3.0,The hook slides out easily. But i like the look. Just be careful!
3.0,I ordered the Red and White googles with the dark lenses shown here but I got a very solid pink pair with rose colored lenses. Guess I will be seeing fish through rose colored glasses.  Very disappointing!
3.0,"I ordered, what they describe, the Maid-Blue costume. It actually looks like Dorothy from Wizard of Oz. You only get the dress, not any accessories, as they state in description and images. The only size option available for that specific dress was ONE SIZE. I figured I didn't have any worries over that so I ordered it. I am 5'2&quot; 120 lbs and normally wear size 6 - 8. I tried the costume on right away and I could barely zip up the back. The front has a lace up front so I loosened it up as much as possible but it is still so tight. Hubs had a hard time zipping it up. I understand it is supposed to be form fitting but I was stretching the lace front so much that it was pulling at the seams. The top is a bit see through and unless you have on a strapless bra, your milkshake will be bringing boys to the yard. It is so super cute but I would not step foot outside of my bedroom with it on. The length of it is decent though. It went to the middle of my thighs...just a tad longer than the model shows. Although I do not normally wear short things, I would have been comfortable wearing it that length for Halloween but the top is way too baring for me. Hubs enjoyed the costume though! I did receive this in exchange for a 100% honest review."
3.0,"I was really looking forward to using this for Halloween this year but it is too small. Biggest problem was the butt area, it almost seemed like it was supposed to be a thong. It says it fits true to size but I am a small and ordered a small, I think a medium or even a large would have to be ordered. The costume is super cute and it is made of good material that seems like it would last a while. Maybe I'll try again with a larger size next year lol"
3.0,but it's not as nice as they're making it out to be
3.0,Thin material but cute. I'm 5'4 and about 190 pounds. XL fit well.
3.0,"I ordered a small n after a little time because the material is so stretchy, they became way too loose"
3.0,Overall cool looking shoe however I read a few reviews about them fitting small I should have listened to other customers but instead I followed LG website size chart and ordered a 39 shoes came in and were so snug. Anyone purchasing these shoes should go 1 size up or 1.5 up depending on if you will be wearing thick socks a lot. Really really love the boa system on them super easy to tighten and losen to take off. Pretty bummed that the next size up is $100 more than what I originally paid or else I'd exchange them:(
3.0,My son loves this jacket. I gave it three stars because the emblems came off half way after washing. Luckily I know how to sew and sewed them on instead of whatever glue they used. Now it’s perfect.
3.0,Needs softer fit
3.0,"I have the pants which fit great, the capris were a tight fit. Should have gone up a size. I ordered the size I usually ordered. The Capri material (grey color) is very soft."
3.0,"There's absolutely no padding and it's definitely not a swimsuit material. Just cheap silky material. Looks like the picture and is cute, just impossible to wear in public"
3.0,"Tight around the arm area, perfect everywhere else. It's not like I'm going to exercise in it, but still not perfect. Pretty good for the price. Very cute."
3.0,"The watch was the right size, easy to program, feels and looks nice - but it claimed to have a built-in light which I hoped would allow me to see the digital read-out in the dark. Instead, the light was a tiny little dot at the extreme left of the display, that served only to let you know where the watch is - if you weren't already holding it and pressing the ""Light"" button. The only disappointment. Going back to my analog Timex Indiglo, a true classic."
3.0,The pendant is very nice but the leather strap broke in less then a month. I just bought a new strategy from walmart and have had it for 6 months no issues.
3.0,"Love the material and style...but I didnt like the crew collar on front and the square cut on the back because the shirt pulls because its heavier in back it feels like the crew collar was too tight. If both the front and back collars were the same (either crew or square cut) it would be a perfect top, or put the square collar in front and crew in back. Love the high low but not the difference in collars. So back it goes...sad because it is a great high low top."
3.0,Not the best quality product but it’s decent for the price point.
3.0,the top half of this dress was very large and hung down very far
3.0,"These are cute and nicely made, but run small even though they say adult size, should say petite adult"
3.0,It was a lot smaller across the chest area and the material was a little more see through than anticipated.
3.0,The material is stretchy.  The bottom is way too small.  I usually wear a large but this one fits like a medium
3.0,"The fabric is soft but not 100% cotton. I ordered a shemagh with golden tassels but like another reviewer the colors ran immediately, they're currently just white with no trace of dye left. It's soft and warm but not as absorbent as a 100% cotton shemagh like a Hirbawi and the separate tassels along the side are tied in and I've lost several so far over time. Overall I like the look and feel of this shemagh but it's not completely suited to the desired task of absorbing sweat and water to evaporate off on a hot day, would order again if price was lowered and only then for appearance and not in a bushcraft, bugout or camping situation"
3.0,The bottoms fit good but top was small. Not much structure on the bikini top part.
3.0,"This is a very pretty bra and seems very well made, but my problem is it is way to small.  I can almost always wear a 34 B, but this bra is extremely tight and the cups are too small.  If I had ordered it I would have to return in.  I am disappointed because I was really looking forward to wearing it but that is pretty much impossible.  If you are basically flat chested and skinny then this bra should fit, otherwise go at least one size up, preferably two."
3.0,Bought it online because no car at the time.. cheaper in stores though... but good quality item
3.0,got for a birthday present. but I think I need one for myself
3.0,I like it and plan on ordering more colors!
3.0,It keeps coming untied. Very cute though.
3.0,"Very comfortable, but does still fog at indoor range"
3.0,"Very comfy & not see through. Sadly, the black looks more like navy blue."
3.0,"I like how the product looks, but the fit is not that great."
3.0,Cheaply made. Threads hanging from seams.
3.0,Didn't like material looks simple
3.0,Texas necklaces
3.0,"The look is amazing, but be aware they are super slippery if you are walking in a hard surface. I wear size 9 and this pair runs larger and wider , unless you have a chunky feet I’ll recommend to go with  one size down .<br />Also I have been trying to return them but Amazon is not allowing me to confirm the return transaction….here I am stuck with a pair of shoes to big for me"
3.0,I ordered the shirt for my wife but it was just too big for her.
3.0,"The watched looks lovely, same as the picture in person. However, mine arrived without instructions. I did not know how to change the date. It was stuck on Monday. Great customer service thought! They offered to fix it or refund me the price I paid free of charge!"
3.0,These goggles fit snug. I was disappointed with the case. I opened the package and there was a giant crack. The case is unusable now. I needed the goggles the next day so I didn’t send them back.
3.0,Hubby wears a 11 and we ordered 9.5. Still too big but not worth the hassle to send back for another half size smaller but I would go down 2 sizes when ordering. Other than that he likes them!
3.0,The cardigan was well made and just what I wanted but much too small.  I usually wear a medium but ordered large based on reviews.
3.0,Pretty disappointed this didn't fit correctly. I have a daughter who's almost 12. She's super skinny and only wears a size 8. Everything we've ever bought that was a 7-8 or an 8 fit her perfectly. It was the perfect size. This was described as an 8-10. So I figured it would either fit her perfectly or be just big enough that she could grow into it a little bit. My daughter tried it on and it was so tight between the legs that it was extremely uncomfortable. You could see the shoulder straps digging into her shoulders. Extremely tight and uncomfortable. If it's more like a 6-8. The picture I added is of my daughter who wears size 8 comfortably. The size 8-10 of this specific leotard wiuld not fit her.
3.0,"Not-an XL, nice product-though, will have to wear as a shirt."
3.0,"I like it, but after several washings it keeps a sort of plastic smell to it. Also I don't believe its fleece as its described."
3.0,"I measured my waist, rounded up to the next size as directed, and the belt is too large."
3.0,"Maybe because it was too small for me, I don't think it is a true longline bra. The bra did not give as much, it stretched very little. The fabric felt a bit cheap, kind of like a swimsuit material. That is not my favorite in a high impact sports bra. It looks well made and washed up nicely too."
3.0,"While these are stylish sunglasses, they do have that flea market feel.  Plastic is just average and thin.  I do like the look and mirrored lenses.  They come in an average case - wont protect from getting sat on, but will keep them safe from drops.  Just an average pair of glasses for an average price.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product.  However, this does not have an effect on my review, nor was required by the seller."
3.0,quite narrow
3.0,They don't fit as described in the display pictures. I thought they would be more of a cotton blend and they are more polyester spandex material. Colors were as depicted. Nice packaging.
3.0,Too large returned
3.0,"I know that you get what you pay for, but you can also get dresses at this price point that are much better quality.  As others have mentioned, the fabric is cheap.  What's more, it's the type of fabric where creases stay and cannot be ironed out.  On top of that, the seam is either sewn strangely or it's the fabric, but the skirt portion stays in an unflattering A-shape.  It doesn't flow down, it's stuck in its A-shape."
3.0,It's a beautiful piece but I cannot wear it due to a fabrication error. The large gem is glued on completely crooked and the glue is so strong I would end up destroying the delicate lace around it if i removed it to fix the error...I will post an updated review if the seller is willing to send a replacement.
3.0,The sweater is just ok.  It's really long. I guess it will be cute with leggings. I've had it for a while now and still haven't worn it because of the length. Hopefully I'll get past that and wear it!
3.0,I like the low cut of this dress but the buttons were basically already coming off when I recieved it. I don't feel comfortable enough to wear it without worrying about it busting open
3.0,"I really thought this ring would be really pretty from the picture.  Sadly, it came with flaws and nicks.  I don't know if the producer thought it would make it look more antique but it doesn't look good.  I'm disappointed."
3.0,The description states a black fabric band. What I received was a fabric and leather band.
3.0,"The reason i'm giving 3 stars is, inlikenit but its doesn't look like the photo. Thought it was gonna be black and and grag sleeves, but when i got it it's black and white sleeves. 😑"
3.0,nice material - nice cut but too big overall
3.0,I like it and its cute but very tiny. I hardly notice it on my bracelet. Guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,The waist band is too tight basted on the size recommend in their chart.  Otherwise fits fine.<br />I suppose you could order size 42 if you wear a 34 but then you would have boxer trunks.
3.0,Ummmm how are these heavyweight?carhartts thermals are getting very thin!my older heavyweight quarter zips are way heavier!just get the heavyweight union suit
3.0,They are very pretty looking shoes. The insides broke down after 3 months.
3.0,Used it as a carryon on a plane trip. Was glad I did as the person next to me spilled their drink all over the floor.  The down side is that it's very cumbersome to carry for that use.  Nice to keep in the car or to store things in.
3.0,"They're pretty nice, but very long."
3.0,I have a few other 39thirty hats from New Era in sm/med that fit perfectly. I assumed this one would fit the same. It does not. It is too big. Since it is the smallest size I was able to shrink it so it fits pretty good but a little loose. Just disappointed New Era changer the hat sizes so this one fits larger heads and doesn't fit my tiny skull so well. Luckily I can do a pony tail up a little high for when I need a snug fit. Otherwise I love the hat.
3.0,I had the Anklet for less then a week and it broke off and I lost it. Not as secure as I thought it would be.
3.0,"I absolutely love this dress. The only problem I had with it,is that it is NOT closed in the front. I had to use a safety pin to ensure I wasn't exposing myself. Other than that it's a lovely dress."
3.0,Sheds like a dog.
3.0,The print was not pretty in person though. Fit is good.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, very nice quality but when I washed it the dye from the green skirt seeped to the white top. So now I am stuck with a teal top and green skirt"
3.0,"Cute pants, just be careful because the side ties are very thin."
3.0,The print on this is nice and the fit is decent as well. But the inside of the garment is white and looks cheap.
3.0,Looks great but came bent in a box so somehow it got bent before it got to me.. I returned it. Went to New Orleans and ended up getting a really cool mask there.
3.0,The green bled when washing so all of the white parts in the pattern are now light green
3.0,"It was a lot larger than I had hoped or expected. My 3 year old loves Peanuts, so I got it for her for her preschool lunchbox. However, it's way too big and won't fit in her school bag."
3.0,"Mixed emotions about this product.  Visibly, they are just paper.  It's had to believe they block anything, so I have to take the seller's assurance write-up that they do.  Just in case - and since we own them - we have put them in our wallets.<br /><br />Too small for some of our ID's.<br /><br />Hope they perform.  I will pursue further assurances from the manufacturer and post."
3.0,Ok... cheap quality but what do you expect when you’re buying clothes on Amazon? The item I received did NOT match what the model was wearing. Disappointing.
3.0,Loved it but it broke really fast.
3.0,Love this shirt but the smell is so nauseating. Can someone tell me how to get rid of the petroleum smell it has. Washed it twice. Fits sooo nice. Colour is so pretty but I can't stand the smell. The smell is why I gave two stars
3.0,This would be better in a cotton fabric. It is stiff and shiny.  Considering returning it. It’s also voluminous in an unflattering way
3.0,Very heavy polyester dress with really weird super wide cap sleeves. I am 5'5&#34; 170 lbs and usually wear medium shirts but large to XL bottoms. I ordered an XL based on other reviews size advice and the sizing chart but it was too big. I'll be sending it back and will think about reordering a large size. This is definitely a cooler weather dress as the material is so frickin' heavy and thick but it is cute and a great purple color. Any tiny snag in it though would be glaring though. My only hesitation in reordering is that the cap sleeves are very wide and stick out like weird shoulder pads/wings on me. They stand up since the material is so thick. It looks very strange. I would advise all hourglass girls like me to buy the size that fits your TOP and not to worry about your bottom. It drapes well. The XL was also way longer than the model in the stock photo...a little below mid-calf on me.
3.0,"This was to be my backup pair of clip-ons.  I have another pair that work well.<br /><br />Yes, these clips are harder to put on than the others.  But the real problem is they are too dark...they make it hard to see.  Much too dark."
3.0,Supposed to be teen size but turn out to be bigger
3.0,Super cute but I don't dare attach it to my phone for fear that it will break.
3.0,"Ordered a size 1 and got a size 3 1/2. The bag the shoes came in said US 1 but both the shoes have a 3 1/2 on the bottom.<br />Other than getting the wrong size, my daughter really likes them. They seem well made.<br />We opted to just keep them for the next winter, I’m sure they will fit by then."
3.0,"There are several things I liked about these PJ's, including:<br /><br />--The print on the shorts is cute.<br />--The color is good, a muted beige.<br />--The shorts have pockets.<br />--The price is pretty good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were more things about them I DIDN'T like, including:<br /><br />--The shorts are a little too short, even on my 5'4"" frame.<br />--The elastic on the shorts is VERY tight. So even though it is only on the back of the short, it squeezes tightly at the waist. This makes the drawstring virtually useless.<br />--There isn't as much ""stretch"" as expected to the fabric.<br />--They wash and dry (cold water/delicate cycle) okay, but the softness of the fabric disappears after one wash.<br /><br />And that last ""dislike"" is the real biggie, and the reason for my 3 star rating.<br /><br />These are supposedly made of 100% cotton, which should be soft and stay soft. These start out soft, but don't stay that way. So they simply aren't that comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Are they really 100% cotton? I had no way to tell since there isn't labeling of any kind on the set. All I can say is, they didn't feel like soft cotton after washing. Comfort and softness are what I look for in PJ's, and these just don't have it."
3.0,These were super cute and I was so ready to wear them but they sent me a 10 instead of 11 and a reorder wouldn’t have been back in time for my trip.
3.0,"Beautiful, but a bit stiff."
3.0,"The lenses work really well, and are reasonably clear and sharp.  The clip feels really cheap, and doesn't open very well.  Since they basically work, I give them 3 stars."
3.0,This dress is cute and it fits well but the tag is super annoying. I have tried to adjust it and then remove it but I still have to wear something between it and my skin. I don't tend to be bothered by tags so I am not sure what makes this one so different but it drives me crazy.
3.0,"This dress is nice, a bought a size up and it fitted perfectly.  However it certainly without the top button even though there's a button-hole. Sad"
3.0,These shrunk up horribly! I bought them last year and they were fine- this batch was bad
3.0,Cute but chain is pretty flimsy and clasp was broken.
3.0,"Love these and they are super cheap but they came with one of the plastic nose things missing which makes them very uncomfortable. Other then that, I do like them and they are super fun."
3.0,"It fits fine but it's on the little tight side..I have a somewhat big head I'd say.<br /><br />It would be more useful for the winter time no doubt..Since it's spring now it makes ya warm. And it's snug..so say it be useful for sledding, snowboarding, snowmobiling.. Etc. Etc.<br /><br />Good product overall. Not worth 20 dollars but definitely worth every penny for the design."
3.0,At least 1.5 sizes too small. My daughter is a 9.75 and we bought 11 and we had to squeeze her in them. Repurchased in size 28 and my Daugherty is a 10 and they for awesome. They have their US size comparisons off by 1m adjust accordingly. MY DAUGHTER LOVES THESE<br /><br />But the seller needs to send thensize you order. The replacement shoe they sent still was not the proper size. I just gave up
3.0,"the drape is not as good as what it shows in the picture, material is kind of thin, but it's easy to wear and casual."
3.0,"Make sure you get a size larger than you wear, because mine fits a little small."
3.0,The material is not so good. But the fit is a little loose than the regular sizes.
3.0,It’s cute and mostly comfortable but short and rides up a bit so I have to wear a tank under it and keep yanking it down.
3.0,Fast delivery. They are very comfortable to wear. Only problem is that one ripped up the seam and another is starting to do the same. So I was disappointed in the quality. Such a shame.
3.0,The gloves are nice and the right size but simply the wrong color I ordered black and what I received was lilac
3.0,"The dress is absolutely Stunning! I love it!<br />This company is absolutely amazing!!<br />I receive my dress in a timely manner and I appreciate it so very,  very much!!!!!!<br />Please, Please, customers make sure you measure and order the “CORRECT SIZE” my daughter is getting September18th..<br />All the things I said were true about this company.<br />The dress is very, very nice and the company was extremely prompt/attentive in responding to me.<br />The only thing, Andybridal would not exchanged my dress.<br />All I needed was a different size and the only way Andybridal  would Exchange my dress is if I paid extra $30..Sorry for the inconvenience!<br />Thank you Andybridal"
3.0,"I needed it, so I bought them, but for what it is/does, it is expensive."
3.0,"It's rough, I thought it was going to be more softer, and the small holder fell off.."
3.0,Not exactly the fabric I expected. More of a heavy T-shirt material. Good for workout leggings.
3.0,Watch is pretty but band is hard and stiff; looked different than website.  POOR customer service b/c they shipped for free but made me pay for return.
3.0,This product is beautiful but I ordered the wrong style. It is very stiff but wearable.
3.0,"The bras i received were much too large. They were extremely cute though. I gave them to my mom, who is much larger than me in that area, and they fit her perfect and she said they were very comfortable. I ordered myself more in a smaller size and will try to remember to update."
3.0,"The fabric is flimsy, not particularly stretchy which makes it either too big or too small. Would provide very poor UV protection.<br />Will try to return...."
3.0,"This is a nice purse.  I like the size, it's bigger than one I started to order from another website.  This price was good for this purse.  It can be carried with dressy and casual outfits.  However, the downfalls are it doesn't open as wide as I thought it would and there is a chemical like smell inside the purse.  It will definitely need to air out.  I place a fabric softener sheet in it to see if it goes away. If it doesn't I will send it back."
3.0,"Buttons wouldn’t really stay buttoned, but the material was soft."
3.0,"These seem great in concept, but not so much in application. Once the bag is pulled out its a real pain to get it rolled back in. The plastic compact is a little to heavy and the bag pulls out as you walk. My biggest grievance is the bags quality. It's ridiculously thin. I never used these. I ended up throwing them away."
3.0,"This is a great bargain and they're super cute. But I must have a very short neck... they are so large, they rest on my shoulders. Not at all what I was expecting size-wise. Will have to gift them to someone else. They are very lightweight and the colors are great, though."
3.0,"Not for the modest, these are super thin and run small (2 sizes I'd say).  They look cool, but not so much when you put them on!"
3.0,"This shallow and flat cadet cap is made of one hundred percent cotton and is hand washable in cool water.  It will fit a 22-23-inch head circumference and cannot be adjusted.  This no-frills black hat has a short brim, so it will not provide much protection from the sun. The inside is lined for greater comfort.  This item will likely appeal to adolescent boys or men who like military-style apparel."
3.0,"I love the style of the coat, but the inner lining started falling apart after a few uses. So disappointed in the liner quality. I ended up cut an old black shirt to make new pockets. (I kept losing my keys and phone."
3.0,Cute tank but runs small and size is inconsistent.
3.0,It was beautiful but i had to return it i got an Xl I usually wear a 2xl & im a C cup but the bust part of the dress was too big for me and I was afraid I'd expose myself on accident and I couldn't get one size smaller because beside the bust area every where else it fit beautifully.
3.0,"Typically a 14/16 in dresses or anywhere from a L-0x depending on the brand and way I want the dress to fit. 36/38 DD chest. I ordered the XL during a flash sale and it arrived quickly. It is a beautiful vibrant dress. However, the chest was really tight/ small. My bra was not covered. Strange enough, there was extra fabric in the upper chest/ shoulder area. I tried to reconfigure but it would not stay. Arms were slightly tight as well. I have reordered an XXL hoping that everything will sit a little better and I will have some extra room in the chest area. It is extremely low cut which I was anticipating but I needed and extra inch or so of fabric so my bra wasn't showing. I also tried wearing it without a bra but that was a DISASTER.- I have wayyy too much chest for that. I will update when I receive the larger size. Also, slightly peeved that there are 2 different size charts. One in the slides with the item photo and one in the discription that give 2 totally different recommendations for sizing. Had I paid attention or noticed the difference, I would have contacted the seller to see which chart is accurate.  According the one in the item description I would have bought the XXL and I wouldn't have had to reorder... Oh well! Other that that, if you are small chested and don't have a hard time with finding dresses that fit in the chest GET.THIS DRESS. It's gorgeous and flowy very bright colored and can be dressed up/down."
3.0,"I like the fashion of the handbag and I have received compliments but after 2 months the handles started to peal. Now I am extremely disappointed in the quality, especially considering how much I paid. It is also heavy and cannot be worn over the shoulder which makes it somewhat impractical."
3.0,Does not hold its shape very well but it is very comfortable and the color is great
3.0,"Very well constructed. However, I am wondering what kind of head were these made to fit. They are so wide I can put my hand in the space between my temples and the handles. My head is normal sized."
3.0,Super cute and it's a good size but the strap broke in like 3 days. Wasn't worth it
3.0,Doesn't really hold shape add you'd expect a corset to.
3.0,for 40 bucks its really cheaply made. had to buy because it was last minute.
3.0,"I ordered the 14 gauge, but the hoop diameter (3/8 in maybe) was too small for my conch. It's pretty; I'm disappointed I can't wear it."
3.0,They definitely measure a bit small but they still fix just a little tight
3.0,Compare this to the picture of the product being sold online. I specifically wanted a plastic button up hat. They last longer and are more reliable. Any other type of hat strap is wanting in my opinion. I thought I was buying a hat with plastic buttons on the back! You know! The higher type of quality for baseball caps! In the pictures I attached you can see the type I got instead.
3.0,"Very narrow, but I was able to get away with it--ordered for wedding."
3.0,This belt does not look as good as the picture.
3.0,"Would've given this 5 stars but I had to return.. This is extremely long, for septum. This hung so low, it kept hitting my upper lip. I was soooooo disappointed because it is gorgeous and well made. The thing is the design. Because the design is shaped in a &#34;V&#34;, for lack of a better description word, it really hangs. It looked ridiculous on me. It looked as if you could hook a chain from it and take me for a ride... Maybe it's that my face is smaller in that area or not. Thing is that it did not look cute. So, with this being said, this would be better for ear(area) piercing. Would NEVER recommend for the septum, unless you have a big face and there's a lot of space between your septum and upper lip, OR you're looking for a &#34;look at my huge septum ring&#34; look. Oh well, I'll still order from this seller because this piece is gorgeous."
3.0,"The colors are very pretty I got the green one, but material is very thin you can any and all imperfections"
3.0,Very small and only 1 side is shiny other side nothing  delivery very good
3.0,The front bottom sticks out and it’s slightly big
3.0,I liked the dress .. it was very comfortable- it didn’t fit right for me .. I have to someone else .. I think it better for smaller chests .<br />It’s a really pretty dress - just not for me
3.0,I have a pair of Air Force 1s by Nike and they are a size 6.5 so I figured buying a size 7m should be fine. But they fit tight and are way smaller. So if u are going to buy this i would suggest going two sizes BIGGER.  Other then that the quality is pretty good.
3.0,"You'll need to steam this dress constantly. The material is always wanting to wrinkle. It is flattering to other people but I don't think the style is pretty, it makes you look a bit chesty and the waistline isn't in the most flattering place in my opinion. Had to send it back for quality issues."
3.0,"The gloves I received were brown, not the flowered pattern shown in the picture.  Fortunately, my daughter did not care what color they were and were happy they fit."
3.0,I WOULD OF DID 5 STARS BUT AFTER GETTING MY REPLACEMENT BRACELET IN THE MAIL THEE MAMA BEAR CHARM STILL FELL BACK OFF. BUT OTHER WISE IT NIECE TO SHOW OFF.
3.0,Back portion of the earring was broken but was able to superglue it back together. Otherwise nice earrings
3.0,Great for working out.<br />Comfortable.<br />A pocket blew out after the second wash.  Big hole.<br />Disappointed in with the durability and quality.
3.0,It was tad big and the material was thin.
3.0,"I got these for my husband after having a pair for at least a year.  I love mine and have had no problems.  However, when his fell off the dining room table one of the lenses came out.  He popped it back in and they are so far, so good.  The lenses really permit a sharp image, although I prefer a lighter tint."
3.0,"I was adding to my wardrobe, so not everything was going to be worn right away. By the time I opened the package and tried it, the return time had expired. It was a 3x, I ordered an XL. I gave the dress away as a gift. Thankfully, it could be repurposed."
3.0,"Fine shirt especially for the price, but the reviews all claim it runs so small, so I got a medium. Big mistake. Shirt actually runs kinda big. If you are slim, this slim fit shirt will probably be the size you expect."
3.0,"They're keyrings, they're black, and they seem sturdy enough.  The black starts to wear off after a while, but no worse than other black rings I've had.  No complaints."
3.0,"The dress is fine. Good quality. Fits fine, but it's not the correct one for me."
3.0,Cute but much smaller and shorter than I anticipated
3.0,"Very Cute, bad quality. It was tearing b4 i could even get it out the package good. Im afraid to wash it!! I think its worth half the price. i ordered the leg warmers to go with it and they are tearing also."
3.0,The post is a little short but other than that good quality.  Cute colors.
3.0,"Run small. Order half size up. They are stylish looking, but little bit hard and so so comfortable."
3.0,Frames were a little flimsy but good quality for the price
3.0,Bottom looks like nothing in the picture. Too big and not cheeky at all.
3.0,"these also are smaller then I thought they would be, but I will wear them."
3.0,The bracelet is beautiful but very dainty and thin. It broke faster than I had hoped for.
3.0,"I have large bust 38dd and really there is no strapless bar that looks good. So i actually bought these to wear over strapless bra. They work, it looks much nicer with ond of these on top of strapless, not so much of my 38dd showing now. But to use a regular strappy not any support if you havd large breast"
3.0,was trying to replace my old hat with the hidden pocket. this hat doesn't have that feature.
3.0,All three sunglasses looked cool but brought within 10 days!
3.0,"The material is nice, light, and spring appropriate. The general idea of the style is simple, modest, and flattering. Only problem was the reviews said it runs small. I ordered a medium and it was too big. I suggest order to your usual size. The main issue is it's tight in the arms. Wish this dress fitted... Bummer."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:e6fb013bcce483c481794ac9c3f86d9d]] This hat is simple, fits well, but poorly designed. Watch my video for a full review."
3.0,When I washed the hat & shrunk & beaded up.
3.0,I wanted to love these. The braided upper is sort of loose. They feel like they'd fit a wider foot. So that feel floppy and hard to walk in. Because they feel like they'll fall off as you walk.
3.0,The colors aren't as bright as the picture shows.
3.0,Its really pretty. Unfortunately after wearing just a few times the ring has already started fading to silver.
3.0,"Es un pantalon con excelente color, pero no es de calidad no vale la pena que sea tan costoso esperaba una mejor calidad precio!!!!"
3.0,I returned this. I didn't love the fit. The main problem was that the full seat didn't seem very sticky. I've gotten used to silicone and need to just stick with that.
3.0,"This is a great bag, however it's narrow and thus is difficult to fit notebooks in. But, with a little struggle, everything can fit. Overall, I really wish the bag was wider at the entrance so that I didn't have to hold my textbooks when using it."
3.0,"Did not care for the 8me size, gave them to my son."
3.0,"Looks nice for a sporty look and the installation was so easy. It just does not feel great on the wrist, the rubber just feels uncomfortable compared to the leather one that came with the watch. Also the band holder are too tight; it's hard to get the excessive strap in and cane only use one of them."
3.0,Shirt does run small. Ordered an XL and it fits as a Large
3.0,These lights are really small and really great. The only thing is that I ordered a pack of 40 lights and about half of them actually worked.
3.0,"although i like these frames, they did not fit my face. i did expect more for the price though as they felt like standard frames you'd purchase for much less."
3.0,"I like the &#34;idea&#34; and am giving that 3 stars. I had the &#34;link&#34; or jump ring break the 3rd day, I just put another key chain through it. I like that  I can wear it on my  Levi jacket at work, (have my locker key on it) so fixed that problem myself, kinda old-school.  Another problem was that the glue holding the fir on got on the beads on the face of the little fox and the fir matted onto it pretty good. It was stuck on about  up to the nose. I scraped it pretty hard to get it off most of the way. So I did not use this for the gift I had planned to but love it for my locker key. I do get a lot of compliments on it.  I like it, but it is probably a bit over priced, I am debating on ordering more as some of the other reviews are worse, but I think they would make great stocking stuffers or little birthday gifts if they were not over glued. Just have to take a chance and be ready to do a bit of touch up. The jump ring is not really a big deal, just grab at a craft store by the bag. I have seen these little foxes in stores for 6 bucks or so and the fun Monster eyes ones for even more, and not any better made. The stones on these really sparkle, and I think they are glued in well. The keychain part,  with the additional hook clasp, is shiny gold tone with a &#34;Gold Chrome&#34; look (if there is such a thing. The head is hollow and the back has little hearts punched through the metal. All and all I think if you are not over concerned about the cost and have some skills you will overcome the haters with the sheer cuteness of it.<br /><br />PS, remember there are different sizes, It took me awhile to figure out why some were so much more expensive. I got the small. it's a little bigger than a racketball, ball. If you don't know what that is, then I can't help you.<br /><br />Best of luck. also, it took a bit to get to the USA due to the whole from China thing, so plan accordingly."
3.0,The glasses are not as advertised!<br />I immediately became suspicious when I seen another set of lenses in the box. I read the mini instructions included and then went outside. The lenses (clear-light tint) slowly increased in tint.<br />I needed a wider wrap around frame and it feels great especially now here is colder air and we all know what it does to the eyes at 30mph plus and wearing extra head gear( balaclava etc) the frames welcome the added extension needed and keep the cold air out of my eyes.
3.0,"I wanted to love this top, but it just didn't look right on me, I think the spaghetti straps just didn't do it justice with the rest of it being too blousy.  I'll wear it, but it wasn't flattering on me."
3.0,"I really like the look and got a lot of compliments, however the necklace fell apart the first time I wore it. I was able to fix it with some pliers, but it was disappointing."
3.0,"I ordered this coat in an XL seeing that it did say it was a JUNIORS coat which juniors is for like teens or ppl with petite like frames. I'm on the short side 5'2&#34; and weight 170 and the coat fits me perfectly..hugs my bottom a bit but that because I have a big bottom lol<br />Anyways I wasn't able to wear it much when originally purchased because it has been oddly warm on the east coast. However the last week has been extremely chilly and the coat does indeed keep me warm with out having a sweater or hoodie under as I would usually wear one with a coat. It's long as well which I like, just few inches  above the knees<br /><br />My only complaint is that the good is rather small! It comes to the top of my head. I like big hoods for when it snows or rains since I wear glasses but was disappointed. Also I have a hole in one of my pockets which is weird because I carry my keys in the breast pocket so I'm pretty sure it was a stitching thing. Someone else mentions stray thread which I've found a few but not many to freak out about. Also I shoved my hands and my pockets and my pocket tore a bit.. I'lol be able to do it but didn't realize the coat would be so delicate<br /><br />But it is a great coat for the price and I wasn't trying to spend tons of money on a winter coat..I wanted something warm and it is indeed warm, I'll just suggest being gentle with the coat and if you want a larger hood I wouldn't suggest this coat for you, I can live with it for now"
3.0,The bathing fit nicely. The sizing is as expected. The reason I give 3 stars is because the bathing suit looks so cheap. I know you get what you pay for but it just looked too cheap. I won’t be wearing it.
3.0,"This dress fit like a glove! I am a 36 DD and a 150 lbs. It wasn't too tight which I like, still enough room to relax in. A medium would've been too tight. The fabric is what I expected too. It's nothing too fancy so you get what you pay for. However I am very happy with my purchase! I can't wait to show it off at my holiday work party."
3.0,"The dress is cute, fit is fine, and pockets are always appreciated. For this price however, you can't expect great quality, so it wasn't surprising that the seams started coming apart after a single wear. I wish I could've gotten a couple more wears before having to start repairing the seams."
3.0,"This is my third Miraclesuit purchase and definitely my least favorite.  The bottom part fits as expected.  The top part, however, threatens to unleash my 36Ks with every stroke.  This is not for the busty.  And I recommend ordering a size or two down."
3.0,"I could get the boots on, but could not zip them more than an inch. Not good for wide calves."
3.0,Theye  were great.
3.0,They keep coming loose.
3.0,Beautiful. My wrist is 8in and according to the details it was big enough. It broke when I put it on but the seller was quick to get a replacement in the mail.
3.0,"It’s a cute shirt. I don’t regret ordering it, but the material is thin. Nothing an undershirt can’t handle.  It’s a little snug so size up."
3.0,I'm sad to report that these socks do run very small. I love the patterns and the feel but will have to find someone with a very small foot to give them to.
3.0,The Squeaking is kinda awkward but I hope it will go away as I use it more.<br />These are hardly comfortable sandals but they are good for the price and their purpose or showering. This is a single rubber unit so it tends to be very rigid as well
3.0,Too small and glitter is itchy when skin touches
3.0,I bought this dress hoping it would work for my birthday dinner. It is a beautiful pattern and is made of a nice material. To be able to wear this dress you have to have no hips. I bought an XL and it zipped up but I had barley any loose fabric around the waist area. For reference I am 5'10 and 165 lbs. Will be returning.
3.0,"I volunteer at the Houston Rodeo in March, we get lots of unexpected showers, so this package of rain ponchos is great to have and stick over your uniform etc."
3.0,Hard to substantiate any of the claims made by this product.
3.0,"I bought this bikini for a friend of mine and she sent me a picture of her in it...the bottoms appear to me to be ok, however, the top is different from what the picture here shows. my friends top is just black strings, not tie dye halter like the display picture shows. she dont mind it and she loves it, but I bought it expecting the top to match what the picture shows."
3.0,These shoes are absolutely adorable but were too slim for my toddlers foot. It ended up leaving blisters :( she doesn't have a wide foot either
3.0,"I have bought 3 as gifts and one for me, and I can say that 50% have failed in the first 6 months of normal usage. May be better suited for people who aren't as active and don't go out using money often. As for me and my buddy, the clip just didn't hold up after regular, every day use for 6 months. Don't get me wrong though, I love this clip so much that I've since tried to JB weld mine together (at the joint) and am getting a little more use out of it before it's totally shot."
3.0,Cute rings cute for going out on dates and different occasions
3.0,"These are cute, but the ECG print is wildly inaccurate. However they are cute and comfy."
3.0,"1st off its TEAL not GREEN. I bought this for a st. Patrick's day church event but its not green. Second, im 5'3"" and it comes above my knee. Cute dress but not as pictured."
3.0,Son loves them had to get a second set for his moms house. So the second set arrived different color and they do not fit. Same size as previous order but different fit.
3.0,"The frames aren't as thin as they look in these pictures, but it's what I needed anyway."
3.0,Im giving this a three star. Well the watch is a beautiful piece. Yes a large face btw. But i received my watch not working. Had to take it to a jewlery store to replace the battery.
3.0,I have a chest (not breast) that sticks out farther than my stomach and it really defines that and that’s not what I want. Cute! But not for me
3.0,"Based upon price, reviews and the need to update my underwear drawer I purchased the 5 pack several months ago.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-fabric holds up after several washes<br />-comfortable, soft material<br />-lightweight<br /><br />CONS:<br />-they tend to ride up more than I’d like. This became especially apparent every time I work out at the gym<br /><br />As a result I save these briefs for lounging at home."
3.0,The title states 2 pack. I only received 1 in the pack. And I also received it almost a month later than expected. Overall struggle once my 1 (not 2) came in it was okay quality and good overall look.
3.0,"They are beautiful, but easily break. They all broke loose. Did not last, though trying to order the same again since they all look alike."
3.0,"- It does look entirely like what I expected.<br />- The fabric feels nice<br />- Larger than expected, on my head at least; not quite as snug as I would want."
3.0,"Super cute but one of the bracelets broke after one wear. For the price, not upset, however I really like them. If you order, just don’t expect them to last."
3.0,"You get what you pay for with these. The cut and the colors are fantastic, but the fit is a little loose and the fabric feels more like a cotton legging than a yoga pant. If you plan on working out in these, I would recommend against buying a light color. If you sweat at all, it will 100% look like you peed your pants."
3.0,"As mentioned in other reviews, this product does not look as cute in person as it does in the picture.  It was very confusing to figure out how to put it on, and once on, it literally only looks good when your hand faces down, as pictured.  Otherwise, it's just a big mess of chain on your wrist.  It was a great price though, so I decided to keep it, and redo the design a little myself.  I make jewelry so I have the necessary tools to redesign, but unless you are wanting to recreate a different bracelet, I would not recommend this one."
3.0,"Character day at school with my fellow teachers called for a group outfit. We all got these shirts, they fit as expected and looked great."
3.0,Nice looking glasses but fit weird around nose. So I returned. They seemed to be good quality otherwise.
3.0,"It's a pretty dress... runs larger than size. Not exactly how it is pictured but with some tailoring, will look beautiful. Not a &#34;buy and wear&#34; type of dress."
3.0,"Good looking, date adjustment function is pretty useless. Hard to get the knob in the correct position for date setting. Changed the band to a darker leather one and it looks nicer."
3.0,It's a cool dress but was way too big on me. I ordered a small bc I'm 5' and 120 lbs. It fit me like a trash bag in that it was just too big everywhere. I'm not really sure how an extra small would fit me but I'm not even going to try ordering one bc the white half of this dress is somewhat see through and I just don't have time for that.
3.0,It was well made but way too heavy.  It’s better as a jacket.  I wish the fabrics was lighter.
3.0,"These look nice and are a nice quality, but I didn't realize when I ordered them that they were too low-waisted to use for exercise.  They are like hip-huggers, so as you bend and stretch the waist gets lower and lower.  I spent half of the yoga class just pulling on my yoga pants."
3.0,"Pros: Sturdy construction; reasonably comfortable with a light load; decent pack-strap configuration; very breathable; reasonably comfortable while shooting a bow.<br /><br />Cons: Loud zippers; non-adjustable torso length; holes to feed hydration tubes are too small and obstructed by the hydration sleeve; hydration hanging hook is difficult to access; chest strap constantly loosens itself and needs to be re-tightened. Also, the pack does not come with a bow boot, as the product description states.<br /><br />I contacted Badlands customer service and wasn't terribly happy with the interaction. After some arguing, the Badlands rep did offer to help.<br /><br />I think Kuiu or Mystery Ranch are a better way to go."
3.0,I love carnelian but the beads were a little larger than I expected.  Perhaps it's because I have small hands and (in my opinion) no wrists lol.  My main complaint is that I have to regularly adjust the bracelet so that it won't be so loose. I have another bracelet similar in style that stays tight and I never have to touch once I put it on except for when I take it off. This one I have to keep tugging so that it won't slip off.
3.0,Very cute product looks like it does in picture but extremely tiny
3.0,The 16 is very small so I suggest a 14
3.0,These were okay. I expected them to be thicker but are pretty thin. They also shrunk significantly after the first wash. These would not fit a mans face without it looking like a tight super-hero mask.
3.0,It fits fine. It’s a little long materials kind a cheesy
3.0,A little on the thinner side for dance tights and small so I would order one size up.
3.0,a bit clunky
3.0,I thought it was more of a knit type material.
3.0,"The price point is great but after 2 or 3 uses, I already have a small hole."
3.0,They did work somewhat for me at night. I was really hoping they would help with my rainy night vision but they didn’t seem to make a difference.
3.0,Great for a smaller breasted person.  Im a 34D and it doesn't give me the support I need.  If I were small I think it would be great.
3.0,"The socks are fine, good quality, etc. However, I'm right between sizes and I needed them to not be loose, so I ordered the smaller size. They're very tight and I don't think I can use them. More fool me, I washed them before trying them on so I can't return them now."
3.0,"Don't know how to say let's start on plus factor..really warm, thick material really good if you have large head. It does not look good once you put it, just don't look good at all"
3.0,comfortable but shiny in a weird way
3.0,i love what the shirt says its cute and funny and it is true to size BUT you can barely read the font! very disappointing. it is not as clear as the picture shown it is a paint splatter looking font and not really legible unless your really close to it.
3.0,Nice shoe but run small. And you'll have to pay the return shipping fees. Do your research before ordering.
3.0,"The definitely run small,but I expected that and got a size larger than normal.<br />The only problem was the color. The picture showed a light pink,which was what I  was looking for. The actual color was much darker.<br />They aren't made as well as I expected from Champion.  They fit well,not quite as short as most made in this style."
3.0,Pretty small but cute
3.0,I received a lot of compliments on it if it's fine it looks nice but on the picture it is very hard to see that there's shingles at the bottom of the cover up. Had I known I would not of ordered this particular one but it does look nice overall.
3.0,just fit too small
3.0,"I really liked this dress in the photos, but unfortunately it was far too small for me. I am a US 8/ small chest and was unable to get the L to fit. The arms were very tight and once zipped, the top portion of the dress was pulling everywhere. I am 5'9&#34; and felt that the place where the bodice flares out was very unflattering on someone my size/height. I would recommend this dress to someone who is much slimmer than me, with a small chest. I could exchange for an XL but fear that the sleeves will still be too tight and the &#34;waist&#34; of the dress will still hit at the wrong place."
3.0,"Good quality chain, but had to return because it was too orangey 18k and did not match my 14k pendant."
3.0,"I picked XXL to have a little space for comfort, however this size must have been made for Abercrombie models. This average snack filled American needs a little air cushion between the shirt and my skin. I really like this particular art piece and was happy to find a shirt with this design. Tag inside doesn't list materials, just says wash inside out. Shipping time was reasonable. Overall quality seems ok, but I'm afraid to wash it and have it come out even smaller."
3.0,"We sent this one back. I was buying for my tween and the skirt was very skimpy. The belt was also an orange color, not brown and the black sock was very tight."
3.0,These were satisfactory but nothing special
3.0,Too large!
3.0,"Looks and feels great....does not look or feel its cheap. Instead, its look like of the branded glasses on the market.... just that the bridge area could be slightly larger. Not ideal if you have a thick bridge"
3.0,Works for the gym but size ran small
3.0,"I purchased ruby red earring studs for my niece for Xmas, but they delivered the wrong color. And the silver post looked tarnished."
3.0,"This belt is a good value for the price. You can’t beat that. However, it was rough feeling to the touch. I didn’t like that and ended up returning it."
3.0,Came in bent. But still wearable an look okay besides the fact they are crooked
3.0,Too small in the arms for me! I ordered an XL and it was to small in the arms and shoulders for me. I have broad shoulders and my arms are not small so it didn’t work for me!
3.0,"These are really big, much larger than I expected. I was happy they came with a case."
3.0,"Stars on the skirt fall off with every wash, but otherwise I was pleased with this purchase."
3.0,Not too bad for the price.
3.0,Dont like french cheap wires and they're gold! They looked silver!
3.0,"The strap itself is fine but the material is thicker than the levers of the quick release spring bars, making them useless. On one side the lever disappeared getting turned away from the hole where it is lodged, as you can see in the pic. I did manage to get it on the watch but I will need the spring bar tool to get it off."
3.0,We like geox brand overall but these sneakers seems to not as robust then other we had . It only lasted 5 months for our active 7 years iold is
3.0,This product was tight on my husband but he still rocked it
3.0,Disappointed too bulky and heavy
3.0,"tiny, dainty little chain. definitely a  chain"
3.0,"The hats we had for our newborn were small and slipped off his head.  I bought this one because it thought that it might be a better fit.  However, it is too big, so we will need to wait until he grows into it."
3.0,"The lock that comes with the purse is really uncomfortable to open, and the purse is too small to fit anything in there."
3.0,"This necklace is dainty and is perfect for layering with other necklaces. It would also make a great gift for a young child or teenage girl. It has a cute little dangle at the end of the clasp, giving it a special touch. The heart itself is very small but it lays flat on your skin and does not appear to shift around much. I like necklaces with these claw clasps because they are easier to use and close.  The extended will give you the ability to change the length of the necklace, which comes in handy when layer with other necklaces.  It also came in a cute gift box and was wrapped new."
3.0,"excellent item, solved my problem"
3.0,"I got these for my partner and they just run a bit small so I kept them. I am smaller, 5’4 at 120lbs and the large fit me perfectly where I usually wear a small or medium, so I am hoping the extra large is better for her. They are super cute though, a bit thin but still comfy and cozy."
3.0,It is a nice ring but larger then what it appears on line.
3.0,This was about 3 sizes smaller than what was listed in the sizing link.  They have since added language about junior sizing in the description.  DO NOT go by the sizing in the link.  Go by the sizing in the description.
3.0,"Not over thrilled. The product itself isn't bad, just wider than expected. It will work for my strapless bra, however, none of my regular bras."
3.0,"These sandals are so cute and such a great quality. However, I sized up and they are still a size too small."
3.0,Not sure it was a gift
3.0,bigger than i expected but my daughter says that's the style:)
3.0,Nice but fades in days  that’s why the 3 star
3.0,"The item did well for two years.  But the end clip connects to the lanyard via a swivel joint. As the clip swivels you have metal on metal, and eventually the swivel part of the clip wears out, rendering the item unusable. Again, this takes a couple of years to happen. But it is a rather pricey item to have a relatively short life span."
3.0,"Very thin cotton material and it's more of a cotton candy pink not a bright coral pink. It's great for the beach or the gym, but I wouldn't wear it as an everyday piece. I haven't washed and dried it yet to see if it shrinks."
3.0,The fabric is very thin. I purchased many items from that brand it’s usually always great  quality clothing. But this sweater didn’t really meet my expectations. I was disappointed.
3.0,"Work fine no complaints, could be a bit longer they are almost to small even at max length but otherwise good."
3.0,"My 5 year old started kindergarten this year and she loves to wear skirts and dresses. Usually, I'd put a pair of old biker shorts or linen shorts underneath not minding what color they were. However, she attends a school that requires uniform so I didn't want the bright shorts to show underneath the uniform. I wanted it to look tactful so I bought the pack of all black. Not that they should show underneath her skirts, but she's 5 and crossing her legs aren't a priority. I thought these shorts would be perfect for that, which they are. The sizing is right and I think I got a good deal. The only negative thing is that they are really sheer. Sheer without her bending or manipulation. Kind of like how tights look when you stretch them out. I would not recommend wearing without a long shirt to cover the bottom."
3.0,too small and doesnt lay how it does in the picture
3.0,"I loved the idea of this shirt. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t hate it - however, I ordered it because of the vibrant pink color represented in the photo. Instead, it’s a pastel pink. I’ll wear it, but it’s not what I thought I was buying."
3.0,"I like these pants because they are thicker and made of good material. The one issue I had with them is that they were a little bit on the shorter side for me, like cropped even though they are supposed to be full length. The other problem is they are a little bit tighter and not super stretchy around the waist. But they are a nice color and well made so if you can deal with them not being as stretchy they are nice."
3.0,"Don’t expect it to look like the pic…as usual per amazon, right? The material is thicker and doesn’t hang as pretty as the pic. The shape is quite boxy in reality and not as long as the tunic look of the pic. I’m 5’6” 209 lbs kinda hourglassish with a hefty boo-tay and a little pooch belly. I had high hopes, but don’t need my clothing magnifying my thickness so it went right back."
3.0,i love the design for this item however the zipper does not always close and I usually notice when coins fall out.
3.0,It is good and wears well
3.0,The hat was totally squashed...thought maybe I could get the wrinkles out but no success.
3.0,I always order these types of shirts in a large for layering. I was disappointed with how thin the material was but mostly how short the sleeves are. I’m 5’6” and the sleeves didn’t even reach my wrists. The hood is very thin also. I would not reorder this shirt.
3.0,"Product was beautiful, but arrived damaged. The seam had two strings that were falling apart upon arrival. I plan to take it to the cleaners to have repaired. Other than that, the skirt was beautiful. I would've brought more colors, but I'm afraid to due to the condition it arrived in."
3.0,"Looks cool, and has nice features. But it's made of rubber and not leather"
3.0,"These sandals would fit normal for my almost 9 month old, but the straps are too busy, loose, and wider than what I would of imagined. That’s because I always get told that my son has chubby feet...."
3.0,"I bought them for my other half... they stay put and don't snap off... complaint, they constantly loosen when on"
3.0,"I returned this product, it was extremely long in the leg, but ok in the body.  I would have had to cut about 12"" off the leg length to make it fit and that would have changed the line of the legs.  I am a size 8,  5ft5"" tall woman and my legs aren't short!!"
3.0,does its jobs as suposed to
3.0,Length is good but hard to get on due to tight elastic bow.
3.0,"They look beautiful, but they don't have structure so they cling too tightly and make it difficult to breath."
3.0,very small cut. order a size larger then you normally are.
3.0,This dress fit strange on me. The dress itself fit but the lace overlay was really big and baggy it was bizarre. However I just returned it with no issues! Other than that it was still pretty cute just maybe go a size down if you really want a nice form fit
3.0,Returned. Wasn't quite as expected.  Not my style
3.0,"The gems are smaller than what I really hoped for, but they come looking exactly like the picture. They fit well, the gems just come loose and falling out of nose ring pretty easily. They were so cheap for so many so I didn't expect much more for the price."
3.0,I have several nightgowns from this company that are true to size. This gown runs small.
3.0,"Pay attention to the reviews.  This item runs very small.  I ordered the small.... I'm 5'3"" and wear a size 2-4, typically.  I couldn't zip it up more than halfway.  If you remove a dozen or so ribs, you might have better luck with the small!  I'm still going to wear it because as long as I keep the cape on, you shouldn't be able to tell that it's half unzipped."
3.0,Not what I expected. Rubberized look.
3.0,Too bIg looking on my wrist and I’m not small-boned.
3.0,I bought this to replace one I lost.  I was disappointed it wasn’t a heavier weight linen and that it was actually off white rather than bright white but it serves most purposes.
3.0,Was alot smaller then what it looks like in the pic.
3.0,"Eh. I just got this yesterday. When I ordered it I thought it would be different than it was-wider shoulder straps, more roomy inside and the outer pocket would be big enough for my kindle. Color was great... there was no funny smell that other customers had reported. There is something odd going on with the stitching inside so that the inner pockets don't fully make pockets. I used it yesterday afternoon and now is sitting in my closet. I think for the right person this would be a great bag but for me 5 hours of use was enough."
3.0,"The only reason why I gave 3 stars is the nice vibrant colors, the fact that they do soak up the sweat fast, and they arrived earlier than expected. They are larger than I thought, no compression whatsoever, and have a weird smell that does not go away so easily. It took me 5 washes to get it all out"
3.0,"String that tightens mask is too thin and is uncomfortable, digs into bridge of nose. Vented material on sides that allow mask to ""breathe"" are too far back and don't meet their purpose. Fabric is light and soft, but won't be wearing again."
3.0,It was lovely dress but too small for me
3.0,"This was a very tight fitting XL shirt -- but I really like the 1/4 button shirts.  However, very tcith became impossible to wear after just one wash.  Now it's useless and has been converted into a rag.  THe material is nice, but some manufacturing defect makes it very shrinky and the size proportions are just off."
3.0,"Loved how they look. However, the craftsmanship was poor, as they broke within a month of buying them"
3.0,Wrist Band could stand to be a bit bigger for those of us with larger wrists. Otherwise device appears to be working as described.
3.0,Not nearly as convenient to use as I thought they would be.  The next guy may love them.
3.0,"I was able to fix the hat, that arrived unstitched."
3.0,"Cute bag. Color was as pictured. But fabric is fraying around button holes on the handles. Smaller than expected, and pockets are almost useless as they are tiny. I can't fit my phone in any of them. The inside separator falls and it is difficult to retrieve items from the bottom."
3.0,"Cute, but straps are loose and unable to adjust. The cannon balls slip out every now and then when I bend over 😆"
3.0,"The shoes fit my daughter great but the elastic lace snapped after one wear. She is still able to wear them, however it is a bit looser than we would like."
3.0,"I purchased a pair at the very end of June, and have worn it only one day of my period, the heaviest day, for those just incase moments. The concept is great and it actually works which is also great, however after only literally 4 wears, one day per month; July, August, Sept and Oct and of course washing/drying after each wear, the pair is not worth it. I hand wash and put in the dryer. After the first time drying them, the “pad” portion of the panty was filled with fuzz balls and continues to collect them every time they are dried and now after the 4th wear the seam threads are coming undone all over."
3.0,the rings came in as stated but they must be made smaller I wear a size 11 but these are almost too tight.
3.0,I wear hearing aids and glasses. Whenever I would put the loops over my ears my hearing aids would pop out. I was searching for something that would extend the loops and attach behind my head to avoid putting the loops over my ears. However these did not work for me. The lanyard did not tighten behind my neck enough to keep the mask from slipping down. I've seen other people use the lanyards without having a problem but I needed to find another solution.
3.0,Sweat didn’t stand a chance with these bad boys on
3.0,Not nearly as luminous as I would have liked. A poor mans Ball Watch. I gave it to  my son when I wasn't that impressed and I notice he doesn't wear it much.
3.0,I like the bracelet but the color is off. I was getting it to match a set I have but it's not a match. My set has more purples & the bracelet gives off more blues.
3.0,"My daughter was looking over my shoulder one day last fall and she fell in love with these shoes. They were as beautiful out of the (clever) box as they were in the picture, however I immediately felt they were overpriced. They're just fabric. Remember China flats from the 80s? These are those. On the first wear, the toes collapsed and the shoes got incredibly dirty. Poof, your pretty Mary Janes become muddy play shoes (even when there's no mud!) Also, I didn't mind that they were real buckles, but my daughter passes these over a lot because she can't put them on herself - think about how your child will react to that before purchasing. If these shoes were $25 or less, I'd buy them again because they're cute and fun, but as they are they are way overpriced."
3.0,Looks nice but definitely flimsy I wouldn't recommend for long term wear. Lightweight
3.0,Belt is good. Nice quality. Fits well. The slot can be adjusted so that the tail of belt will be hidden. However the switch to adjust length comes at bottom instead of top.
3.0,The color is a little off and when I received it the scarf had a couple of snags in the fabric but nothing serious. I really like this scarf! It is really long so it makes it look really full in fabric but is still really thin! Great for the 4th!
3.0,They are made of very good material. I am new to compression socks. To me they are way to long. Also very tight. But I believe this is normal maybe for compression socks. I only bought them because my doctor told me.
3.0,I like the pendant but had to replace the chain
3.0,Is a very pretty watch that wraps around the wrist. It has two little buttons that you press to secure. I have gotten a lot of compliments on how pretty it is. I saw other reviews stating that its too small for their wrist but it fit mine perfectly. I'm 5'1 and 150lbs<br /><br />The only downside is the SMELL!!! I am constantly spraying it with my perfume to try to get rid of that awful smell attached to it. So far no luck. 3 stars because it's beautiful but the smell won't go away.
3.0,This is a pretty scarf but it was already snagged when I got it and it's not as wide as I thought it would be. I still wear it though because of how pretty it is and thankfully no one notices the snags but me.
3.0,Not what I expected fit wise
3.0,"Nothing terrible but really nothing great either. I like the drape and it feels nice, but it's very thin and just not flattering. Very wide and oversized, if you lay it out flat it is basically a square. I will use it for around the house and thats about it.<br /><br />On the upside, I ignored the hand wash only and it went through the washer and dryer just fine."
3.0,"A little too tight around my head. I'm a man who wears a 9.5 hat size and these are just a bit too tight. On long runs of more than a couple hours they start to give me a headache.  The material is less stretchy, heavier, and more coarse than Buff. I still use them, but only if my Buffs are all in the laundry."
3.0,"Looks nothing like pictured, it literally is like a crop top sweater."
3.0,"Fits as expected in the waist & hips, WAY too long in the legs. Must have had 4 inches of fabric hanging past my toes. Returning these."
3.0,Definitely would not fit a child's face. My 9 year old has a hard time keeping the shield part on her nose. Easy to fold up. If position right there is minimum fogging for eyeglass wearer's.
3.0,"Not sure who decided to add the ruffle to this dress, but it makes it look... weird. I'm trying to find a dress for a play I'm in, with the description from the script reading ""Little black dress, bought at the last minute, wearing a sweater over it to make it more conservative""<br />I'm 5'9, 165 lbs and ordered two of these, in large and extra large because I didn't know which one would fit better, and I almost kept one of them (the large - the XL was too big) anyway because it DOES fit the description... it looked like something bought at the last minute! But I just couldn't make myself do it. lol Still shopping! Hoping to find one that maybe I can live with. Even our wardrobe department doesn't particularly want this!"
3.0,"Its a nice bathing suit, but it was too big and places and too small in other places. It just didn't fit my body type. The seller worked with me though and made it right! :)"
3.0,Item kept coming in the wrong color.
3.0,Runs a little small. Cant wear underwear with it
3.0,I had high hopes for these. The shine is super high and the feel is like oil on the skin. They look amazing. But they got holes and runs after just a few minutes at the toe. I am a man that wears hose on a daily basis. These gave way too quickly. Disappointing since they looked so sexy and shiny.
3.0,"Really pretty, soft, comfy shirt. I really like the buttons and sleeves. It does seem to wrinkle a little easy, but I havent noticed any fading or shrinking after I've washed it. The way it's made it does seem to made the wearer look a little bigger than they normally are just thought I'd mention that because not being a small person myself that is something I'd definitely want to know:)"
3.0,Love them so comfy so pretty so girly love love they are not an every other day kind of use shoe they already show wearing I have worn to work 3 or 4 times
3.0,Decent glasses. I think the size is for kids not for adults. Looked way to small on all the adults. Sad cause I bought it for adults.
3.0,"It has hard the 'silver' off fairly quickly. Mostly on the paw prints so it almost looks intentional, but it's starting to become an all over effect. Cute otherwise."
3.0,This is a nice quality dress. The material is thick - to thick in my opinion- it adds bulk aka you look heavier. Who needs that?!  Returning.
3.0,Leather is nice but the small sized band is shorter than the Apple small band.
3.0,like nike's these are poor quality and run very small<br />next time back to puma's
3.0,The bag was too big for my use but it seemed to be well made
3.0,Loving the dress. I got a lot of compliments. The only disappointment is that it looks like I can only wear it one time. The threats from the lace on the arm are coming out already. It was a cheap dress so I think you can't expect much. Still loved wearing it though.
3.0,Bought an XL and fits real snug. Wish I would’ve bought a 2XL
3.0,Falls Apart when you have it for a while
3.0,"The pants are super cute and soft. They look just like the picture. My daughter received them as a Birthday present. I think they run a bit on the large size, especially in the length. The reason I only give them three stars is because the waist band was unraveling when we received them. A third of the waist band was already un-sewn upon opening the package. It was very obvious as the threads were hanging out all over the place. Still, they were so cute that we mended them and kept the,. Depending on the price, I might recommend buying these."
3.0,I was expecting a cloth or a heavier cloth but other than that it’s fine. Looks cute.
3.0,Purchased for halloween costume.  Quality is fair but fits my needs.  I sized up 2 sizes from regular size small to large.  Comfortable.
3.0,"Great leggings they are uber too big all the way around. I ordered a small. I am 5'9"" 135lbs. Next time I will order an x-small."
3.0,Nice but small !
3.0,"At first glance this swimsuit is very cute, but at the same time it is very thin. I perfer swimsuit to be a little thicker to hold you in.<br /><br />I wear a xl/16/17<br />I first ordered a 3x based on reviews, that was a mistake. Returned for a xl 14/16 and bottoms are still a little loose, but wearable<br /><br />I would of have left a 4 star based in this, but I have worn this only twice and the colors are fading already. And where the dream is on bottom is turning white?<br /><br />So cute Chris, just don't expect it to last you long. And order your regular size or even a size a down"
3.0,They were okay. I thought they would be sturdier than they were. Since it is for children its okay.
3.0,"While I love the look of these, get tons of compliments on them, and find them easy to breathe in, the strings snap off at the slightest tug when taking them on and off!"
3.0,"The size, color, and comfort of the shirt is great, however,  the texture of the image feels like a plastic sticker. Hanging to dry would be a better choice than drying it in the dryer."
3.0,I liked this
3.0,Item arrived with nose clip falling off... had to super glue it on because the screw was missing
3.0,"5’10” / 150lbs / 36C / Ordered a medium<br /><br />Graphic was in the wrong place, much too high and makes it look awkward. Really cute design, it just doesn’t fit well."
3.0,"I like slider (ratchet) belts in principle, but the first ones I bought had extra-heavy buckles that were awkward to operate and had poorly tanned leather that leached dye onto my pants at the belt line.<br /><br />This belt has a new-generation buckle that is much lighter and easier to operate than the earlier ones, and I intend to look for other belts with similar ratchet mechanisms. However, i found that the leather strap of the belt is about 3/16 inch narrower than the buckle opening into which it fits and is held in place by sharp teeth. So far the teeth are holding, but because of the 3/16 inch gap the leather is not fully supported and seems likely to work its way loose.<br /><br />For this reason, uncertainty about the belt's longevity and durability, I have awarded 3 stars. If the belt lasts at least a year I will come back and update the rating."
3.0,My only complaint is due to my large bust. Don’t quite cover.
3.0,I feel that they are a bit too snug. I should have ordered up a half size (not sure if that's even an option on these). Not my favorite boots. Almost too narrow I guess.  I don't really like them enough to wear till they are broke in. Thinking maybe I'd like them more if they were broke in.
3.0,"I like the styling of this dress , however the fabric , pilled and faded after washing on recommended settings.  Will not purchase again , due to pilling issues ."
3.0,A little larger than I had hoped.
3.0,Great for night driving but it doesn’t block the sun well.
3.0,"I bought this shirt a few months ago, hoping to use it for yoga. I followed the measurements and bought a medium. I should have bought a large. I’ve lost weight since, so I tried it on again and it fits. This shirt is comfy and I like the open back to help keep me cool while doing yoga. I love how long the sleeves are. I wish the torso was a bit longer. Overall, I like the shirt. Buy a size up."
3.0,Got late but sale was very nice
3.0,"The bras are made out of a very soft and comfortable material. However, the bra inserts are small and round making them useless for bigger cup sizes as the cups are visible through any top or dress I have tried. I ended up ordering new triangle-shaped and more flexible pads to make the bras work."
3.0,"Buy big! Apart from that...light, nice graphic, a bit shear, about hip length."
3.0,"for being xx-L,very small tight fit,pockets to small"
3.0,"This is not like the picture.  Pattern is slightly different, sleeves are not loose, and sewed on, not part of one piece of material (as pictured).  Not chiffon, polyester and inside is white.  Collar is hard and stiff. Size is good, only thing that is. Will be returning…huge disappointment.<br /><br />A side note was that Amazon couldn’t even bother to put it in a shipping bag!  They just slapped a label in the clear bag it it stored in."
3.0,"I was happy with most things about these leggings. They were warm & fit as expected. My only complaint is when the fabric is stretched tight (bending over, etc) you can see through it a little. I intended to wear them in public, but now I mostly wear them at the house or as a layer because of that issue."
3.0,Runs very big and is boxy.
3.0,The beads are bulky and cuts into my wrist.
3.0,"Runs small, but nice quality"
3.0,"The top is adorable! The pants started to come apart at the seam after it was worn 2 times. So, a fair price for something she wore a few times during the Christmas season."
3.0,"Soft, didn't have pockets"
3.0,"Love these, great for the price. Unfortunately one of the clasps fell off after the 2nd time wearing it but you get what you pay for! All of the other ones have been great. Recommend for anyone on a budget wanting nice chokers."
3.0,"The corset is definitely olive green, not the more golden tone in the picture."
3.0,"Ordered the red, got it good and material seems not but it is not red, it’s definitely a dark orange. Very disappointed"
3.0,The tiny ones did not fit on my fingers but the wise ones do. Over time the silver starts to fade but for it's price it's fashionable till it's not.
3.0,Not what I expected. The font is tiny and can barely be seen. Definitely looks better in the picture than in real life.
3.0,Good bracelet for teens. Reasonably priced.
3.0,"It was a cute shirt. The size of the shirt was not a true fit. It was too small and tight fitting. Definitely not a 2X, but I would try a larger size."
3.0,The collar curls up in the back when I'm deep in my workout.
3.0,Everything about the shoes were great except that they were too tight around the sides. And I don't have wide feet. I'm exchanging them for a half size bigger.
3.0,"This is a dress you have to try on. I am 5'4 and 153 lbs. But, I carry all the weight in my bottom. I am fit, a cyclist. I am very slim on top and have a small waste, huge backside (genetics). I do not like how this looks on me. The dress is very clingy. It might very well be that I am self conscious about my figure (I am), but it makes me uncomfortable to wear this. If you have a slim figure, this would look great on you."
3.0,It’s a little cheep looking the hood don’t fit right and the fur isn’t as fluffy as it should be
3.0,Fits as expected. Order usual size. The feathers could be thicker.
3.0,it will do
3.0,This breaks easily ! And is annoying to have to keep putting back together ...
3.0,Like the simplicity of this dress but the lining doesn’t always stay put.
3.0,"Dress was sort of flat.  To bring it life, an under wire  skirt would be needed."
3.0,Cute but top runs short and is thin. Pants are very soft and fluffy. Materials don't exactly match as a set should.
3.0,"barely fits or works. I felt like i know what i was getting. not great, dont expect much."
3.0,The product was way too small for a 3x the quality was average. I will not buy again.
3.0,"Earplugs don’t go into the ear canal well on children or adults. We were fairly satisfied with the product - wish we bought clear lenses, as most of our swimming is in the shade."
3.0,"The quality was good.  Runs extremely small.  It was too tight to wear after breast surgery.  I knew I was going to have drains and felt that it would pinch off the drains, therefore I returned the item for refund.  Instead purchased Fruit of the Loom Women's Front Close Racerback sports bra."
3.0,Beautiful dress but ran small
3.0,Hat is not sturdy - hardly any hair
3.0,"My daughter loves it. That's all I know,"
3.0,Order 3 sizes up. Im an XL and needed to order4XL. Other than that they are very comfortable and look great!
3.0,If your waist is actually 34 you order size 32 because the 34 is a 38 everything else was good
3.0,"It's quite cheaply made, the plastic front has noticeable bends in it instead of just a nice smooth cover. The battery is wired lose in to a compartment near the top, doesn't seem to be dangerous, just cheap. The rubber insert around the eye pieces is barely held on and it's not that comfortable to wear. The eye pieces themselves are TINY and restrict vision immensely, but are adequate for not bumping in to everything.<br /><br />The best part is the LEDs themselves, which are bright and vibrant and hold images with more detail than you'd think they would, and the app to manage the mask is pretty handy.<br /><br />For plug-and-play it's great, but it's a bit pricey for the actual build quality. If you just want a fun toy for halloween or something similar then this will do the trick."
3.0,It’s cute but kinda flimsy. Broke right away
3.0,Large up top but narrow at the bottom. So if you're an XL up top only you're fine. If you're an XL all over? Not so much...
3.0,"Not the cutest, fit too big."
3.0,It is not mad for women ...it is mor made for pre teen as i have wash thi by hand and hand dried ....and still to small! I did love the skull ....but guess I have to give to granbaby cause I dont check when i can retun as I work...
3.0,"Looked bigger in the description, so I was a bit disappointed. They're ok, might give them to a family member."
3.0,"I will give this review 3 stars because I was taking a leap of faith by being the first to order with no reviews to go off of. I will say the dress did fit as it was supposed to, however the little strap that is supposed to fit fit over the shoulder was a little odd fitting, kinda baggy and weird, I will most certainly add a photo for clarity sake, I am most likely going to find a solution to making this dress work. I'd still order from this company because the material is sturdy and good quality material."
3.0,I was disappointed with these earrings. They were no where as beautiful as the pair pictured to sell them. They both had areas of just clear glass showing through were no material was bonded to them. I bought these to replace a pair I had bought & loved but lost one of but these don't have the same quality of workmanship. I don't think I will order from them again.
3.0,i read a lot of the reviews and it said to order up a size but now i float in it. other than that i love it.
3.0,"This is my third dress I bought in three different colors. However, this dress is NOTHING like the first two. This dress has more of a slinky material that holds no shape. The first two had more cotton in the fabric that gave you a beautiful waist and hip outline. This dress does not. It wears like a trash bag, it's not as long and shows everything. If you have any lumps it bumps, it will show. I will be returning."
3.0,loved the idea but the charm was way smaller than I though and the ring part was huge. it looked so unproportioned
3.0,They are ok. Make my feet sweat.
3.0,"I purchased this dress a few months ago. Because I am only 5’2”,I had to take 6” off the length, Asia’s the case when I don’t buy petite sizes. That being said, the dress is a very flowing jersey fabric. I wore it only once, washed it, hung it on a hanger.....and when I took it out to wear it again, the dress had stretched! I now need to shorten it at least another 4”!<br />How does one have this dress ready to wear if it stretches when hung on a hanger??"
3.0,Alittle small but I like it!
3.0,"I’m 5’0, 7 months pregnant and 165lbs and this dress is HUGE. I was swimming in it, and the cut doesn’t seem the same as the one in the photo"
3.0,Not a big fan of the material
3.0,"Great look, I love the matte black. BUT the small cylinder segments are broken on my jewelry and they shake when I run."
3.0,Way to small for me. Had to return. Ok if you have little hands.
3.0,Smaller than I had expected
3.0,Really cute hat but it seemed small on the inner hat. Looks like advertised.
3.0,I’ve spent quite a bit of money trying to find a mask that won’t fog up my safety glasses at work... these kinda of help? Maybe... I purchased these with fog resistant safety glasses and if worn right they work. But if worn too tight to the face they will fog your glasses. The vent on the front is absolutely useless. The rubber gasket doesn’t move on inhale or exhale... I think it’s basically cosmetic... for the money they are serviceable. Depending on how long this Covid apocalypse lasts I may still be in the market for a better mask.
3.0,"While it was great and easy to use, there were several players that we had to &#34;pencil&#34; in that should have already had pre-named stickers.  Players like Reggie Bush, Dak Prescott, Christine Michael, Terrell Pryor, Josh Gordon.  These are common players and held up our draft."
3.0,"The product itself is good, but took about 2 months to receive!"
3.0,There is a wire that is used as support on the dress that sticks out.  We just removed it and it looked fine.
3.0,Actually could not say about comfort did not wear returned. They are sized about 3 sizes off.
3.0,Poor made
3.0,"This shirt is great, fits and feels good when new.  However, every little thing seems to snag it."
3.0,"Supongo que es por la parte metálica del monedero, pero el diseño resulta rígido y complica poder usar la parte del billetero con comodidad. La calidad es excelente, pero creo que habría que estudiar la manera de que una de las fundas para tarjetas fuera extraíble, así no ocuparía tanto cuando no es necesario tanto espacio para tarjetas."
3.0,I had to glue the chain loop onto it right after I tried it on.
3.0,"Not a fan of the way it looks, but it feels nice."
3.0,Nice material but I order a medium it fit like a large.
3.0,im normally a medium I'm 5'3 and 135 and it was really big
3.0,Can't find one for the other ear!&#62;&#62;&#62; :(
3.0,these are not as good as I had hoped - I'll go back to my usual source in the future - items are rather crudely made.
3.0,I already added a review on this product. I have nothing more to add.
3.0,I returned because they just weren't as comfortable as another pair I bought.
3.0,"I would have loved to give this five stars, because honestly the dress itself is really gorgeous and I've received a lot of compliments on it. However, the zipper came broken and is nearly impossible to zip up. I can no longer zip the dress up and down and have to pull the dress over my head to squeeze into it. There is also some very obvious white stitching, that because of the stretchy nature of the fabric is visible at times. The tulle underskirt is incredibly stiff and itchy, but I wasn't really expecting more at the price point.<br /><br />As far as sizing my measurements are 34-27.5-39 and I ordered a small. I am typically a US size 4 in dresses. I believe I could have gone with an extra-small, because the fabric of the dress is incredibly stretchy.<br /><br />All in all, even with the flaws I think the dress is absolutely worth the money in comparison to the price you pay for the name brand version that this dress is a knock-off of. I wish the zipper wasn't an issues and it took about a month after a ordered it for it to arrive, but those things aside, I do love it and think it's pretty."
3.0,"I got this for my daughter because she wanted a wolf necklace and I didn't want a cheap metal chain that would break immeidiately.  That is why I searched out a leather necklace.  Well, where the metal clasps connect to the leather, it broke right away.  I was able to put back on with a squeeze with pliers, but I didn't want to have to do that so soon.  It looks nice though."
3.0,"Both bands fit well. The purple band is really pretty, but the orange band is ugly... The adjuster on the orange one is black, but the part that hooks onto the watch is white, which is not what is pictured (should be black like the pic and the purple one). Won't be using the orange one because it does not look cute on. 😞"
3.0,Fit way too small.
3.0,This shirt is nice. I like the feel of the fabric. It seems to be sown very well. Really like the colors. Blue being my favorite color. But I would buy a larger size than you normally wear. I received this product for a discounted price for a fair and honest review
3.0,Sizes run smaller than they say...wish I would’ve known that before buying...now I have a vest that I purchased & can’t wear it...waste of money
3.0,"I purchased the “circle black” earrings and have been wearing them for a few hours now. So far my ears are feeling ok (I purchased these earrings for the titanium post because I have a nickel allergy). However, I am giving the earrings 3 stars because I think the earrings are prettier in the photo than in person. My earrings seem to have mostly green speckles in them and lack the multitude of colors like the stock photo shows. Hopefully these earrings hold up and don’t bother my ears in the long run."
3.0,The dress is so beautiful❤ BUT to small specially the waist I am 5'2 124lbs  34-27-38 and I ordered size M still run small i do not want return it  wanna lose some pounds ❤
3.0,I thought the material would be more on the cotton side not the spandex side.
3.0,"It was a fun first week of having this product. We placed it in our guest bathroom so when our guests would turn the light on, it was scream and scare them. But then it quit working. After one week!!"
3.0,Pretty cheap but does the job
3.0,"I bought these shoes for my daughter to wear with her Catholic School uniform for Kindergarten.  We tested them out - running, jumping, with socks, without socks.  Like Mary Janes but different.  No buckles or velcro straps, easy on and off, sneaker style soles, and they stay put.  They are very cute and comfortable.  I thought that the nubuck toe would be reinforcement and protect the patent leather when she played on the playground.  But in the first few days, the ""fuzzy"" started to wear off.  I filled in the bare spots with a black sharpie, but it just was not right.  I kept thinking about Julia Roberts coloring in her hoochie boots at the beginning of ""Pretty Woman"".  Not the image I wanted to send my daughter off to school. We have returned these shoes."
3.0,I ordered pattern 9. I am 150 lb and 5'5.  I wanted this dress as a summer dress I could wear at the beach.  It was not light and airy as it appeared.  The material was a little spandexy and was a little too tight around my hips than I would like.  It wasn't a terrible piece of clothing - just not what I was looking for.
3.0,cheap quality and elastic is minimum
3.0,"they work  and look OK,  u don't feel they will last long"
3.0,"I wasn't sure how to do the star rating for this product, because although it is nice, it's too big for a septum piercing. So I haven't even worn it but it does look well made, and it opens and shuts easily enough. so it's not a bad product, it's just too big for a septum piercing (which was the intended purpose). So I guess if you're using it for something other than that, it's probably pretty awesome."
3.0,I think these are so stylish and I was really hoping they would work out.  But I returned two pair of different sizes.  They just didn’t fit my feet right. I normally wear an 8.5 wide.  The 8.5 boots slipped up and down and my foot moved around in them.  The 8 didn’t feel right either.  Both sizes have very flat inner soles.  I have some symptoms of plantar fasciitis and the lack of support caused discomfort.  I am disappointed because I really like the style and they are well-made.  Plus they lace up which is helpful in a rain boot.
3.0,"Color vibrant and size good, but fin access was just 3 tiny loose squares of velcro. I'll need to reinforce them to last and hold fin inside tail. Material thinner than other brands too."
3.0,"These do the job, but they aren't refined looking. They are inexpensive, but not as nice as others I've owned. Not unhappy for the price."
3.0,"The dress is cute and comfy, but the top portion is too small for my chest. The buttons leave open gaps around my chest."
3.0,"Love the dress, the strap came broken and I have to get it fixed. Fits as expected"
3.0,"These earrings are substantial for their small size. They are hinged, huggie style and come in both sterling and gold plated sterling.  The quality and looks of these are 5 stars, but they were very difficult to open.  I knocked them down to 3.5 stars because I broke my nail trying to open the gold plated pair.  They do get easier to open after a few times opening and closing but I worry that I will hurt my earlobe trying to take these off.  The silver pair did not give me this trouble so it might be hit or miss on these.  I really like the look and the feel of these so I am torn on how to rate them overall. They are very pretty."
3.0,Just should've gotten a small. Other than that perfect!! But I never got the small :(
3.0,"I ordered the XL, should have read the size warning and ordered a size larger. It is a little snug. The material is definitely not 100% cotton."
3.0,It needs to be fuller
3.0,wished this fit my er like the pic.  i guess my ear is larger than the model's ear as it does not sit on my ear like the one pictured.  i guess i should have measured my ear. but i have only one complaint and that is the hole that the post goes into fell out of the bottom part of the dragon's tail. had to try to glue that back into the tail section.  will see if it works because i am not paying to ship it back!!!!!!
3.0,"We are on our 2nd pair, but from now on will purchase the native brand. Not worth it to save $10 and have them look like this after a few walks to the pool…"
3.0,"Very soft leather which held up nicely for several years, but the cashmere lining totally disintegrated by the third year, so just know they are great gloves for two years only."
3.0,bulkly in the front area. For some reason much bigger in that area then anywhere else in the pants.
3.0,Backs not Sterling silver!! Only the back of my ears broke out once I got new back they were fine!
3.0,"A little to chunky for me,.. not bad, but chunky...but for the right person... also for buyers, it is hollow and very light material."
3.0,These are made well but have zero compression. The top is a little snug but the bottom my by wrist flaps around like a loose long sleeve tshirt. I'm 5'6 and 140 pounds so pretty average size. Not really what I had hoped for but I'll keep them for the winter as an extra layer now and then.
3.0,"The cut of the jacket is nice but the material is shiny, not wicky, so does not look like it is great quality."
3.0,"I gave this to my husband.  It's small for his wrist, so be careful about the size of the person you are buying it for."
3.0,Do not use both at same time. They are very slippery with soap. You will break dishes. You canjot hold on tight to dishes.
3.0,"Thin material, if you're on the larger side, you can see your bra under a light. I am 5'4, size 12. I'm also not a fan of the shirred waist, I was expecting it to be flatter but it poofs a bit like an 80's dress. I'd rather a smoother/flatter finish. I'm going to keep this for another season to see if it looks better with layering & boots."
3.0,It’s cute but runs small. I wish I’d read through the reviews beforehand. Sleeves are a tad short also.
3.0,"it's ok she sort of likes it, me not so much!"
3.0,"The dress is cute but the material is thin & the top isn't denim like the description says. The buttons were also loose, I plan to remove them & sew them back on tighter. I bought this with a discount code & I honestly would have been more disappointed if I had paid full price."
3.0,Looks good but the elastic could be stronger to get more stars. I advise getting a size smaller than you need if you want the belt to hold up your pants.
3.0,"Its better than i had expected! I was a bit nervous to buy this but I'm glad I did. The fabric for everything is soft. The pants are baggier in person than in the pictures which I like. It matches the character more.The gloves are cute but feel kind of weird on the inside but I was expecting that. (You can't use them on your phone for anyone who's wondering.) The bow kind of pulls the shirt down a bit but it's not a huge deal. Now for the bad part. The shirt. I was so disappointed in the top. Its soft and fits great at my neck but its almost impossible to get on! There is no zipper and I could hear it ripping as I tried to get it on. And the shirt smells absolutely HORRID. It stinks of a disgusting smoke smell and its so strong I had to take it off my head to stop smelling it. I've never ever had that experience before, especially not with this company. The arm sleeves are a bit too big which sucks. The whole shirt will need to be redone which makes me kinda sad. It will be impossible to get it on with a full face of makeup and lashes. . The earrings are clip ons and are lightweight. Overall its not that bad for the price. I will add more pictures later. Edit: the shirt already has a hole in it. Super cheap and thin fabric. When I put the bow on it tore a hole."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:eda486919eac0c86f3e5ea1c58996e23]] Not all of them can fit my ear, but they are cute"
3.0,This was a gift for my sister her birthday was coming up and is was a really nice gift to give someone
3.0,"The dress is pretty but just as the other reviewers stated, the dresses run small. I would definitely suggest getting 1-2 sizes larger. The quality is so-so but I do not foresee the dress lasting very long, Also, my dress also isn't as long as I would have liked it to be. Disappointed in the purchase-- will not order again from this merchant,"
3.0,It's a cheap ring. It looks nice but will stain your finger and the silver and gold coating comes off easy. It's good for the costume I wear it with and the occasional day out but not frequent wearing.
3.0,I order medium because that's my size but it's too big for me...
3.0,"The waist is too big for me, so I constantly would have to keep pulling them up. That was my only problem."
3.0,"I loved this watch until the band broke. I paid $14 for it and couldn't justify paying another $8 for a new band. This is a good watch if you don't mind replacing it every couple years when the band breaks, myself I just bought a Eco drive and called it good. So my review is this it's a good cheap watch if you need a good cheap watch and want a watch where if something happens to it you really don't care."
3.0,"The dress is cute, a little bit see through."
3.0,"I like the backpack itself. It's durable and had enough pockets so that I could keep things separate.  However, About a mile or so into a 10 mile hike I noticed my but started feeling wet..... Yup the water bag was leaking around filling hole. Not around the cap but between the ring and the bag. It was only leaking when pressure was put on it but a large portion of the hike was climbing over rocks.  So if you plan on bending over at all during your hike you may want to replace the bladder with a different one.  other than that it was a nice bag."
3.0,"Nice color, nice fit, but after 2 washes, washed inside out, it was such a pilled mess, I threw it away.<br />Will not buy again."
3.0,"The material is nice, however the sizing is way off. It says that the XL can fit a 42F, which is my size, but it doesn't at all."
3.0,Cute pendant. Came with broken links and had to buy diff chain. But not bad for money.
3.0,"a little on the large size and I didn't like the weird lacing on the sides.  looks better in pictures, cheap looking for the money in reality"
3.0,I bought a medium but the top is too broad and the waist is a little too big for me. my waist is 24''
3.0,A bit too low cut.
3.0,So cute but instant blisters under the strap. They flop around a lot. Not a snug fit
3.0,"Great product, too big for my do need more specification like for dogs weight."
3.0,"Very fuzzy, so it feels smaller. Maybe if they’re worn often the furr inside will flatten, may be decent then. Definitely order a size up"
3.0,"Very cute swimsuit, but the elastic around my bottom wasn't tight enough and kept riding up."
3.0,This dress runs small. Not sure I would wear it except maybe as a swimsuit coverup. It's polyester and very clingy.
3.0,It’s a cute fit for wearing on the weekends. Didn’t like the material much.
3.0,I don’t see them wearing it often so that must mean something
3.0,This sun dress is flowy but runs big. I am 5'2 and this dress is way too long on me.  The material is thin. This is a one layer dress. I would never wear dress by itself. It works better underneath like a see through gown.  This might work better as nightgown for sleep wear.
3.0,The dress was very nice however the XL was a little snug. I gave it to my daughter and she loves it. I thought that it would be a more stretchy. Also the sleeves are really tit fitting.
3.0,It's large
3.0,"Not for anyone with a short torso, goes up way to high and not nearly as short as picture shows. Returned."
3.0,"These are really cute. Too bad they don't fit the size they are spec'd at, 8g."
3.0,"Looked nice but slightly to small for my boyfriend so I had to send it back. As advertised I’d say, what you see is what you get"
3.0,"I actually loved this product but it was way too short. I'm 5'4"" and I ordered a small. It fit in every way but just want long enough. Short legs? Order!"
3.0,Material is too thick! Heavy. Not a fan returned it. Colors are nice. Quality material just not the right fabric for this “chiffon” cardigan.
3.0,I passed this one on to my daughter.  It felt skimpy on me.  I am 5'6 and 135 pounds for reference.  I'm an athletic build.  I ordered a small and wish I had ordered up.
3.0,"I got this shirt to wear with tights. The shirt length is good for that, but it runs on the small side. Tighter fitting than I like to wear. So my advice, order a size bigger!"
3.0,"I wanted to really love this dress but the graphics on the fabric are not the best quality. You can tell this is not the best quality garment. I believe that the price should be lower based on the quality of the fabric. Cute overall, but priced too high based on quality."
3.0,A lot more see through than expected but they work.
3.0,"super thin material, short tie belt"
3.0,Their okay. Just way to big for my ears
3.0,"I found a couple things different with this dress than what was pictured. First, the neckline goes much higher and covers any cleavage... Although the material is very stretchy, the hems are sewn in a way where they are not-- which is good I suppose to keep the dress down at the knees, but not if you're trying to adjust placement at the top. Finally, this material is such that when it is stretchy the colors fade out... So being a busty girl, the color of the pattern and even the black material around my chest is dulled. Overall, this dress is ok for the price, but not what I was expecting."
3.0,"If a larger size was available, on Amazon, I would have sent this back. This will limit it's use - can't layer underneath."
3.0,hard to keep on ears.
3.0,"Love this necklace,  but cannot open the clasp"
3.0,My grandson say they hurt his feet at the heel won't wear them. He says this before he even starts walking in them
3.0,I received the top of the sweatsuit but not the bottom.  I've ordered so many of these sweatsuits and this is the first time that I've experienced this.  Was attempting to do a return but was too confusing and that's my reason for the rating.
3.0,"I wanted this item because it’s the initial of my boyfriends name . It’s really cute, but it feels more on the cheap side . This is nickel, not sterling silver .<br /><br />I could see this being a gift to a little girl with her initial on it.<br /><br />Or seasonal jewelry for women during the summer."
3.0,Runs small as opposed to previous fit.  Also fabric not nearly as pretty as previously purchased gloves.
3.0,Nice watch but the locking clip keeps opening up with any movement. That needs to be improved.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but the glitter that falls from it (as stated in the description) is alot. There is not stretch in this dress and is too small. Beware of purchase if you are curvy. Returns have to be approved by the seller and are not free. The purchaser absorbs the return cost."
3.0,"I really! like this tunic.  I'm 5'7 and the length is about 3&#34; below my knee.  I live in Georgia so the thinner material works really well for me.  The reason for a 3 star rating is that after the first wear I noticed the material fraying and coming apart at the seam in 2 separate places.  I mended those, wash on the hand wash cycle and hung to dry only to find 2 smaller and large place where the material had frayed and detached from the seam. I have also noticed &#34;picking&#34; in breast area after only 2 wears.  I love Mordenmiss and will continue to buy from them as this is the first problem with quality I've encountered in the 10-12 pieces I've purchased"
3.0,Cute hat. Color of khaki was much darker and there was no pouch but cute nonetheless. Just not as described.
3.0,Nice but too big.
3.0,Just as expected. Not a great fit
3.0,"Overall these were smaller than expected, and the elastic waistband was too wide.  Otherwise they are excellent"
3.0,"Cute buckle, but will only fit if you're a size xs, s, m, possibly large. The good news is that there are screws that fasten the buckle to the belt. Since I didn't really care for the leather part anyhow, I simply unscrews the buckle, used leather part as template so I'd know where to poke holes in some wide elastic, used some fray check on those holes and screwed buckle onto my own elastic. The screws didn't go in all the way, they had accommodated the width of that leather, might find tiny screws that are shorter at a good hardware store, but this works fine."
3.0,"Just had my second child and I'm currently breastfeeding and pumping in between. I bought this so I could do hands free pumping once in a while. It only came in medium or large so I got the medium. It ended up being a little big although the flanges fit well in the holes and held them in place. But since it was a little on the larger side and the material seemed like it would get stretched out eventually, I decided to return the bra. If they had a small I would've bought that one."
3.0,"Fabric is very thin.  See photo with light behind it, you can see my hand through it.  I bought a size small I’m a size 4-6.  Style is cute but it was a bit too short and clingy for me.  I’d size up if I were to order again.  The style was really cute and flattering."
3.0,Worked pretty well until it ripped in the crotch area during a run
3.0,"They were a little short, but I have a long torso."
3.0,"Teh watchband did not fit my watch.  The quality is good & the band is very shiny, but the ends would stay attached. Just be careful to check the ends to be sure your wtch will attach to this band."
3.0,"The earrings are super cute, but they were clearly made with nail glue and the smell of the nail glue is overwhelming. When I took pairs out, they were together but able to be pulled apart without losing any stones. However, they smelled so strong it gave me a headache. After while I didn’t notice it anymore, but the next time I wore them the smell was just as strong."
3.0,They do not really get very dark in bright sunlight. Nice and lightweight
3.0,"Unlike previous sandals I've had from Reef, Nike, Merrell, these must be broken in. After walking around a resort in Jamaica for a week I was able to gradually increase the time I could wear them. Day 1 - 30 minutes. Day 7 - 2 to 3 hours.<br /><br />Pain at the toe split and arch. Wore them we to help mold them too. Your feet will need to get used to them."
3.0,"I would have given these a 5+ rating as they are just beautiful, but they would not stay on my earlobe and one of the small backings broke the first time I wore them."
3.0,It is more of a breast lifter then posture corrector. If you wear it longer then a few hours it might hurt your traps but overall it gives a good look to your form
3.0,"It serves its purpose, but the lanyard, neck thing is a bit too short for my liking. I love the color. I also thought it had a zipper to put in coins, but it is actually a​ continuation of a bill sleeve."
3.0,looks and feels okay. Definitely cheap quality and the coloring rubbed off from just wearing it at my desk. Lasted about 2 weeks before I got tired of the metal band and went back to an athletic band.
3.0,"It's quite large. Larger than I was expecting. It's a gift, so I hope she likes it."
3.0,All three shirts where different lengths. The black is longer than the white but all where same size<br />Good quality otherwise
3.0,"Too thick and too high waisted. I can wear them, but I like the Vassarette brand better."
3.0,way too small and when i tried to return it i had to pay for shipping so i just decided to give it to my younger sister
3.0,"If you are a man and need a hole in the front, you are out of luck. No Hole or slit."
3.0,"I ordered Medium (I normally wear XS to S) and am 5'3&#34;. It fit OK at the top but sleeves were long and after the ruching, it just poofed out. It isn't as fitted below the ruching as it looks in the picture. It also was very long that it was almost a tunic.  I really liked the lapel and the v-neck so I thought about keeping it but with free shipping, I sent it back. Otherwise, I might have kept it because it's not that expensive.  If you're inbetween sizes, this might not be the best fit for you."
3.0,"I used this to polish up my yellow + white gold engagement ring, and it did alright. It did help to make the smaller scratches less noticeable but it didn't take them away completely. I'm curious to use this on my other silver and gold jewelry to see if it removes the tarnish."
3.0,Button fell off as I was taking it out of the package.
3.0,My daughter ordered this dress to DisneyBound as Wendy for our trip to Disneyland. She ordered the same dress in the same size but in solid green to dress like Peter Pan on another day. This dress (light blue with polka dots) fit here tighter in the waist and bust than the green dress and the material was a bit different. But my daughter was comfortable so we kept both dresses.<br />She wore this dress multiple times before it needed to be washed. The washing instructions say to hand wash and hang to dry. I had washed the green dress in a machine on delicate and it came out just fine so I did the same with this dress.  The color bleached out in spots (I didn't use any bleach) and now it looks horrible. My daughter is crushed. She loved this dress and received lots of compliments when she wore it. I would love to replace it for her but I'm wary of getting the exact same one. Has anyone else had this issue? Should I have taken it to a dry cleaner? It's not easy of me to hand wash something this big since all of my sinks are small.<br />Very disappointed that the dress is ruined and I'm wary of purchasing more...
3.0,It too tight on bottom.
3.0,"I liked the material and the color, however it was not as flowy as depicted. It was tighter and more form fitting than I was looking for, so I returned. If you’re looking for a more form fitting dress, this would be perfect for the beach!"
3.0,These are pretty well made but there are two areas I find hard to live with. The first is care. They tell you not to tumble them dry. That would have been nice to know going in. I’m going to tumble them dry anyway because I’m not having any prima donna underwear in my drawer. The second is the shape of the pouch. It seems to have been placed a bit high. There’s enough room up high but the jewel area seems more conventional. I would have liked to see more room down low.
3.0,Smaller than expected.  Will give to my great granddaughters age 6 & 7.☺
3.0,"Cute shorts, but runs way too small. I'm a S for almost all bottoms, and an M was tiny on me for this one. Order at least one size up."
3.0,It’s a good bag but there was a hole in the bottom lining. My keys got lost in it. Luckily I found them but I had the fix the hole. But the design is exactly as showed. It’s a good sized bag.
3.0,ok but very thin
3.0,"The color is a little more like a rusty color, think a dark red with orange or yellow undertones as opposed to cool or blue undertones like red wine. Otherwise, wonderful!"
3.0,"Loved how this felt and looked, but it was totally see through. Returned it."
3.0,I don't see them lasting as long as others I own. They are a bit snug for the size ordered and not as much elastic in them as I hope for.
3.0,They were too tight on my Wife's chest.
3.0,"Disappointing due to all but two styles being 16g, making the pieces I wanted to use most of all too small. Some had come loose in the packaging for shipping, a few loose balls and a couple bent pieces. But, all pieces are here, after collecting the loose ones. Over all not a bad little set if you need 16g pieces... Pictured is the set divided by style (...

3.0,"I am 5'2"" and weight 119 pounds.  The bust part of the little dress could have been a bit bigger, but the bottom was fine.  It is a cute piece, the color is nice.  I would buy again but in a bigger size."
3.0,"This band originally looked nice, and was easy to adjust. Unfortunately, the coat on the outside quickly started peeling off. It was also initially difficult to attach, but once in place, stayed well."
3.0,"Not very cap,but fit is so shallow I can't wear it on my fat head.<br />Looks great on my wife though."
3.0,"More of a distressed purple. Size wise, thought it was going to be much bigger"
3.0,I purchased this band for my Fitbit sense. The design is super cute but I can’t keep it on. The clasp part just doesn’t hold. I barely hit my wrist and it pops open and falls off. Unfortunately it’s past my return period so I will just throw it in the trash.
3.0,"I love these all Cotten loungers, but I had to cut the neck into a V because it was just too tight for me."
3.0,Flower on the gauge is really big and because of that leans forward on my ear and just doesn’t look right
3.0,They are nice yet not as nice as in picture.
3.0,Love these earrings but after the first time removing .  Them after wearing em for a few months they wouldn't click back in place and were unrepairable after
3.0,"The fabric is thick, soft cotton but it fades in the wash after the 2nd wash and it's basically lounge-wear."
3.0,"The inside button came off immediately, the others are very difficult to button and unbutton.  They are tight around the waste and baggy everywhere else"
3.0,"Just not for me. I am 5'9&#34; with 36C/D and it's just not looking good on me.<br /><br />PRICE: $27.99 is too high for the quality.<br /><br />QUALITY: Just mediocre. The material is artificial (Polyester/spandex). The stitching is so-so.<br /><br />SIZING: completely off. Order 2 sizes up. I usually wear L, and XL was small.<br /><br />FIT: It's just not sewn properly. The waist is really awkward. It's higher in the front and much lower in the back. Almost like the dressmaker forgot that girls have chests.. lol"
3.0,"The clasp broke on the first day. Luckily, my wife likes to make jewelry so it was an easy fix for her...<br /><br />Still a little disappointing that it broke so fast though."
3.0,Just as described nothing more nothing less
3.0,"The dress was pretty but the boob pad slipped down to the bottom of the dress. The dress falls small and is super long I’m 5,11 and was on the limit."
3.0,"I was hoping for ROSE colored glasses but these were far too RED. Much redder than the picture here would lead you to believe. That said, the description does say RED so I guess I got that but the picture is pretty misleading. Other than that gripe they are pretty good and sturdy."
3.0,took for ever to arrive had to buy another gift to replace this one
3.0,"gf is 6.5.. i got 6's, they felt tight.  would go up a size to 7 next time (all the this about them stretching and breaking in is dumb)"
3.0,Dislike it wasn’t sized  accurate.
3.0,Material is soft and stretchy and very comfortable but the white is completely see through so where the two pieces of fabric cross over eachother on the chest it makes a solid white triangle that really sticks out and looks odd.
3.0,Good Flip ups but to dark for typical pad or phone use.  Works well with monitors
3.0,larger and longer than I expected. they work for my purpose (under t-shirt for yoga.)
3.0,"Very nice quality sock, thick cushioning in foot (gray area of socks), helps with arch support and cuff will hold sock up. But simply does not offer enough compression. I am a size 11 and ordered L/XL and compared to my other compression socks, this one offers minimal compression, not 20-30 as stated. Maybe if I ordered a smaller size? So good quality and perfect if you want a sock that is a little tighter than normal socks."
3.0,I was a little disappointed in the color of this keychain.  I hoped it would be more as pictured but to me it looked more sheer pink.  However it is well made and I will keep it.
3.0,This band is super cute but wears out quickly. One of the loops that hold the band in place has already broken off.
3.0,"Never stops shedding would never get again, real junk"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:c0e7ff03ad8ce51f13ad3d72f016666c]] Excuse my dirty hands…anyways, it doesn’t leave your finger green in which that is amazing…the only issue is that the black from the logo fades away."
3.0,"The necklace is OK, the earings, however, was not a good one.  I lost the left earing pearls at the first time I wear it.  It should have a stronger glue or whatever to attach it together."
3.0,cute but snug. runs small. and long.
3.0,"A size smaller than was described - still wearable,"
3.0,"Cute and comfortable, I would have kept them if the sleeves didn’t ride up into your armpits.<br />If I wore it for any extended period of time, it would cause a lot of irritation rubbing into my pits constantly. Oh and clearly the material is thin and see through."
3.0,"gave away as a gift to an old friend. She likes it, I guess. It at least fit me well when I wore it to surprise her."
3.0,Do not care for fit or material. Wouldn’t buy again
3.0,"This nightshirt is SO cute and is very comfortable, but sadly the face design started peeling off after just one wear."
3.0,Can't complain much since it was cheap and served the purpose I needed.  Metal tip of belt came off.  Still usable.
3.0,"Very itchy material, thankfully and not, I had to wear an undershirt as the splits on the sides went VERY high, even for a short person like me"
3.0,I must say I was apprehensive about ordering online but the jacket somewhat fit and with a few alterations will be perfect. Thank you.
3.0,"I am 5'4, normally wear a L-XL Misses in tops. The belt loops are sewn too high, making the tie awkward. The material to wrap across your body so you can tie it just closes. If I am sitting down, to keep it closed it has to be tied tight to keep from popping open. Just needs more material, maybe another 6"" would be more comfortable. The material, definitely a true polyester, not as smooth or soft as I was hoping. One size does not fit all. It does fit, but usually you want your robes to have more room in case you may want to wear something under it. The length is a little short even for a short robe, and I'm not that tall. If you only want a robe to stay open, then you will be comfortable. For ladies wearing a Medium just to maybe Large Misses tops, you will do fine."
3.0,Its ok....
3.0,falls the second you start sweating
3.0,I loved this bracelet! Got tons of compliments for the one day I wore it. Unfortuneately the stones fell out after just one day of wearing it. I was so sad I had to return it. The return process was very easy and my money was credited back in a reasonable ammount of time.
3.0,Great for a costume wouldn't use otherwise
3.0,"The colors are off on the one I purchased. It appears to be an off white with navy but looks more like brown and black in person. Im going to keep it, but am a little upset at the color difference."
3.0,fits larger than most.  Will regift this one due to poor fit to a larger headed person.
3.0,Construction of the bag is bad.  Stitches worn out in few days. You'll see some thread hanging out. Can be useful carrying clothes but not heavy stuff.
3.0,"It's soft, but the arms are too short, body is too wide (I'm 5'6&#34;)."
3.0,"The brown ones are not brown in the inside as shown in the picture but black instead.  I would not have bought them if I had known that, thought I was getting all brown.  They are warm however."
3.0,"Black Crochet Lace is Misleading, There is No Crochet on this suit - it's all polyester.  However - the price, fit and colors are nice."
3.0,"Fits good. Not as soft as I thought it would be, a little rough feel."
3.0,It fit too tight
3.0,"Cute dress, but is a bit see through. Had to wear a tank and short underneath."
3.0,Got it for my little brother the clasp broke not too long after I bought it. Waste of money. The watch itself is decent and it’s still ticking. Bought it awhile ago.
3.0,A little bit tight but good support.
3.0,"I'm only 5'2 and these land a good half a foot above my ankle. Not at all how the picture shows it landing almost at the ankle of the model. Especially when the description says, ""long."" And unfortunately, the quality is not as expected. Bummer. They are comfy and pretty enough (for undies), though very see-through."
3.0,"I own many Casio watches. They're classic economy watches. This is a low profile watch. It's not my favorite but I do wear it often.<br />The light is a bit weak and like all of them, it needs a timer function. My only complaint with Casio."
3.0,This is very comfortable and fits well but is a little bit like a nightgown
3.0,"Overall, it did look nice when I received it. But I had to return it due to fitment issues. I wear size 34 pants. I did order the size that claims to fit 32-34 inch waists. And, that size should have fit without issue. Afterall, it did state the belt length being 43 inches long and when comparing the belt length of my other belts, my other belts have a length of 42 inches. Which puzzles me as to why this one did not fit if it states the belt length being 43 inches long. I do not know if it is because it is China made (yes, it is -- you will see if you purchase it; the packaging shows it). And I have bought a China made belt about 2 years ago and that fit perfectly. Maybe the sizing charts are different for the conversions? I would recommend buying one or two sizes up just to make sure it will fit.<br /><br />I ended up purchasing a different belt and I hope I chose the correct size this time."
3.0,Stitches are a little off and it’s not a one size fits most. Fits like a medium. Super cute and lightweight tho.
3.0,"Great purse: well made, great quality leather, colors are perfect. Just wish it was roomier inside for my needs."
3.0,Swimsuit material decided to keep it to use as a cover up on a cruise
3.0,Ordered usual size. Way too small.
3.0,"The waist was small but there was way too much room in the booty, and I don't have a small booty! I returned it."
3.0,The color and material are great but not as flattering as I thought.
3.0,It is very hard to get off at times and it slips out of size other times
3.0,This jersey rides up and bows out in front.  I think it would be better without the stretchy bottom part!
3.0,"These are 86% cotton and only 14% flax.  Definitely some false advertising here.  However, the pants are still fairly comfortable so I will probably keep them but I am docking a few stars for the material."
3.0,"I ordered this set for the gun charm. Very disappointed. So don't  buy for a specific charm it might not come. It is just random charms the are sturdy, some very cute others not so much. It was a great price. Still beat buying one charm at a time. But I won't buy again ,since it wasn't what was in the picture."
3.0,It's not as long as it looks from the picture.  It's an average quality product.
3.0,Good on overly bright days.I use once in a while.
3.0,"The fabric is soft which is nice. The bra fits me and is adjustable. The shorts however are a LOT shorter than I had expected. I wish they were a little bit bigger because theres really no point to wearing them because of short they are. You can't feel how soft the fabric is on your legs because the bottoms are only touching your underwear and not your skin. Thats how short they are. The tail was a bit hard to pin onto the shorts. Theres a little loop hole you slide the safety pin through but it was hard to find and it poked me causing me to bleed. Another thing about the shorts it that when I was on my period and wore a pad it was uncomfortable to wear the shorts. I've never had that issue before and I don't even use thick pads. The shorts felt 10x tighter so I took them off. Overall, it's fine. I think the price should be a bit lower but oh well."
3.0,"Fit nice and are really light. Too bad the hinge broke second Time using them, most likely will try again."
3.0,somewhat short
3.0,Shirt runs very small.
3.0,This should specify it’s for kids. Too small for adults.
3.0,A bit on the small side. Pretty patterns though.
3.0,Gave it 3 stars because the designs are cute and my son still loves them. After the 1st use at a water park they started to tear/fall apart.
3.0,"Very comfortable! If you you wNt a lot of extra leg room, order 1 size up!"
3.0,Was a little disappointed. But it did do the job.
3.0,"I had to send this one back. Everything doesn’t look good on everybody and I didn’t like how this set fit me. It isn’t cotton, so I suggest you size down if you want a more fitted look."
3.0,"It's cute but material isn't what I thought. It's soft but sort of boxy, not like stock photo"
3.0,Loved this watch band; however it is too big for my wrist (even on the smallest hole).
3.0,"I normally rave about the products from Coppertist.WU because he is such a talented metal sculptor, but the scorpion I received recently was disappointing. I don't know if I just got a bad one or if they are all this way. I bought the scorpion for a gift to a Scorpio, but I am either going to return it or exchange it for another to see if I do better the second time.<br /><br />As a previous commenter noted, the scorpion IRL is somewhat smaller than the photos lead one to expect. I was OK with that because it's so realistic-looking. But mine also had an oddly-bent middle leg on one side, and the brass was quite dark and dull rather than bright and shiny as shown in the photo."
3.0,"These are OK for the money, but I would recommend to splurge the extra $$$ for the  Champion Women's Spot Comfort Full-Support Sports Bra.<br />It is a far superior product & well worth the extra money! These are good if you want a couple of cheaper extras with a different style though."
3.0,Cute shirt but runs small I would order a size bigger.
3.0,Okay for around the house and beach wear.
3.0,The first thing I noticed when opening this wallet was how nice the material felt and the stitching. There were no loose strings and the seams were tight and straight.<br /><br />The second thing was the metal owl logo. I was initially worried it would catch my pocket or feel uncomfortable when sitting however I never noticed it even with the owl facing in. All the edges are rounded so it slipped into my pocket smoothly.<br /><br />The wallet was tight when moving all my cards over but I expected that from a new wallet. I’m sure over time it will loosen up but will update my review if it doesn’t.<br /><br />The only issue I have is it doesn’t hold money well. The top of your bills sticks out about 1/4”. They show it sticking out in their product picture however I thought that was for display purposes. A lot of people don’t carry cash so it’s not a big deal but some do. I tried it with the cash sticking out but I found it was hard to pull out or put back in and it kept bending and tearing the top of the bills.<br /><br />If your a cash person you may want to avoid this but if you only want to throw your plastic cards in there then this is a good wallet.
3.0,"I normally wear a 3xl and these look like an XL bottom. Definitely not for a big booty, lol. It's really pretty but not true to size. The top fit well though, I wear a 46ddd. I'm going to gift it instead."
3.0,PJs run small. Do not wash well.
3.0,"I read all the reviews and I'm in total agreement, they're way too long.  However, I purchase them anyway to wear at the gym.  Like some of the other reviewers, I had to cut the bottoms about 4 inches as I'm 5'4""."
3.0,"Looks lovely, but hard to put in. You have to squeeze the hoops very hard. Also started rusting in little spots a week after, which is weird since I wasn't neat water."
3.0,It ran a little small<br />I didn’t love it so I returned it.
3.0,Material is misleading. Using it as a decorative wall item.
3.0,"I love this shirt, love the material and the arm length is not too long. But at 5'5"", 119 pounds I was swimming the the small. The small was more like a M/L and very loose at the waist/hips."
3.0,Weird shiny fabric was used for the dress I received. I like a stretchy flowy fabric but this was like bathing suit fabric or something
3.0,They aren't bad.  Very silly socks. They are actually like compression socks.  Very snug fit.
3.0,Pros: Fit around the neck & chest areas well. I liked the stitching.<br />Cons: Runs small. Sleeves were too short. Colors/patterns not as pictured. The gray shirt was a softer material. The blue and green shirts were not / different material. Unfortunately I had to return them.
3.0,"fits perfect, however a bit too short and also has no inside lining."
3.0,"They floating eyeball was fun and got some cool feedback. The ""staff"" was super cheap plastic, tho. It definitely fit the costume we were putting it with (voodoo priest,) just had to dress it up a bit to help give it a little more character. It was definitely ok and will be used again, just understand you're paying mostly for the topper."
3.0,"I purchased a 2X and thought they sent me a Large because it’s so small. It didn’t look good on me. I didn’t return it because it gave it to a friend who traditionally wears a large or 1X, depending on the garment. It fits her wonderfully. The material is nice and fresh but not see-thru. It’s made well. Definitely order a size up for a snug fit or 2 sizes for a loose fit."
3.0,The tops are oversized and molding can be difficult if it's your first time I messed up the mold so now I can't wear the tops too long without them falling out the bottoms are a better fit but makes it hard to talk they aren't as sturdy either but for the price I guess its ok other wise spend a lot more money If u want the real deal...
3.0,The cold is not vivid as the picture shows.
3.0,"The look is phenomenal, but after a few times being worn some of the stitching is slowly starting to come out. It seems to be common with this pattern of tie (I own three versions)."
3.0,"6 dollars for 4 pairs is really a good deal and they don't look cheap at all when you wear them. HERES THE THING. WHEN YOU WEAR THEM*****.<br />when i receive the items, they came in a small box dangling around on some cotton materials which get tangled all around the studs. The needle of some of the earrings turned black as well...<br />When you wear them they look pretty awesome though. It is not embedded like regular gem stones, the stone is pointy at the bottom so when you wear them, instead of just a square, it kinds of stands out.<br />Overall, i'd say... why not?"
3.0,good enough got simple bridesmaide earrings but could be prettier
3.0,Smaller than what i would have expected and liked. Pretty jewelry though
3.0,Not my style...little bulky
3.0,"Pants ride up when sitting...and stay. Great material, love the design. Comfortable and versatile. Nice quality, great fit."
3.0,These type of products only work if you make them work and with that being said I only wear it on runs. I found that it’s folds regardless of placement. It does create a lot of sweat and I love that. The Velcro starts to not stay after a few uses.
3.0,These sandals are super cute on my daughter. They did give her a terrible blister on the side of her foot. I wouldn't recommend these be worn for an all day shopping spree or a day at Disney. Lots of compliments on the cuteness of them!
3.0,"if you have small boobs, beware. The bottoms fit perfectly, very flattering. The top doesn't stay on in the watter because I don't have tooo much to put in there, cute for walking, not actually good for swimming."
3.0,This jacket looked great in the photo but no so great for real. Fabric reflected a lesser quality of cotton than what I would like. I would have kept the jacket had the lining been other than polyester as the static electricity was terrible. I returned the item.
3.0,Cute only for in house use only unless your boobs are verrrry small. Not support but I love the look
3.0,nice material but ran a bit small
3.0,"Those earmuffs certaily do the work and keeps my ears warm in the frozen Chicago weather.<br />I also like having them behind my neck - very easy to put on, but feels a bit too snug with the inside wire."
3.0,Very stiff fabric. It will need several washings to soften it up. Feels scratchy on the skin.
3.0,"Great for a headband, but constantly slips off face if you are wanting it as a face mask, which is what I purchased it for."
3.0,Was not &#34;mirrored&#34; as in the pictures.  You can see straight through the lenses as opposed to a reflection
3.0,The fabric threaded pretty quick
3.0,Love the swimsuit. The only thing is the clasp in the back at the top is awful. Its constantly coming undone and it's difficult to keep putting back together behind you.
3.0,I love this item . However I gave it 3 stars because the chain broke right at the clasp.
3.0,"Decent looking and fairly well made, but &#34;relaxed fit&#34; there most definitely are not. I can barely get them over my calves."
3.0,Just so-so fabric - skimpy in size.  I should have ordered a large for my size 10 grandson!
3.0,"The earring looks alright, but it is not durable. At first, one of the earrings came broken, although they've sent another one, I still can feel I can break it while using."
3.0,You get what you paid for. The lock broke quickly.
3.0,Took almost 3 months to get but they’re adorable. I just wish they weren’t so big.
3.0,Not as warm as expected. I still need two pairs of socks for cold days
3.0,Very tight. Order at least 1 size larger. Soft material
3.0,"The bag was nice and larger (larger than I wanted, but still okay).  However, this bag is &quot;genuine leather&quot;, but after about 2 months of usage (if that) the so-called leather rubbed off of the handles and now all I see is white marks where there is no &quot;leather&quot;.  Poorly made in my opinion."
3.0,silver is already fading after a week.
3.0,Its not good quality and weird fit
3.0,I ordered one size bigger and they were still to small for my left foot. Right foot fit fine.
3.0,Sweater is short ot he r than that they are good for the price
3.0,"First of all, please note that you can only open bottles left handed with this belt. Also, the buckle itself doesn't sit flat and instead sticks out a ways, making it a little awkward. Material is good. Not my favorite... doubt I will use it much."
3.0,Dramatic enough.  Lightweight (not a heavy piece).  I would buy again
3.0,They arrived promptly and work pretty good but one of the side hinges isn't very easy to bend so I don't know if it will loosen up with use.
3.0,La enagua se ve muy bonita pero cuando me llego la parte de atrás no tiene el estampado es completamente negra y no me gustó.
3.0,"The band clasp has already broken,  and its unwearable.. not happy with the craftsmanship"
3.0,Never really got to try it. it wears smaller than the size says. I had to return it.
3.0,"The bag has a super size, but inside it brings few compartments to store, for example cards, pens. The compartment that has zip is very small, my wallet does not fit."
3.0,Cute. Very cheap costume jewelry. Purchased to use as a game gift
3.0,Ordered for boyfriend cause he wanted new hat and masked that came with it he likes the mask just fine but the hat is too thick and too tight on his head doesn't slouch as much as the one he already has so I'll use the hat and he can have the mask
3.0,Cute but a but small on chest and shoulders
3.0,"I guess you get what you pay for.  These are okay earrings, I guess, for the price.  To start with, one earring is beautiful, but the other, the way the opal is, it looks like a mistake or crack or smudge or something.  If you look closely you can tell it's just the natural way the stone is.  Some areas have more crackled darker blue.  But considering the other earring is all that white-ish clearer opal, the other earring in comparison makes it seem like there is a defect in it when you wear them. I kind of hate that.  If both earrings had that look you;d know it was the stone, but when only one earring has it, and the other is all smooth opal (like the photo above) then it looks funny.  These are a Christmas gift to my daughter so I'll see what she thinks when she opens them and see if she wants to return them or keep them.  Then next, I don't know why I thought they'd be just a little bit bigger.  Looking at the photo of the mannequin, it sort of looks like mine are a tiny bit smaller.  I can't imagine they would have different sizes though so maybe it's just the close up photo making them look a little bigger.  All in all, they are okay for inexpensive fashion jewelry."
3.0,There nice but they smell inside and not a good smell either
3.0,"These are so short, and they roll up. Not really any more coverage than underwear, to be honest. Got a refund."
3.0,I liked how it had different colors one. I tried them on but the length was way too long. Just expected them to be a reasonable long length but still wearable.
3.0,Left shoe want stay on even after charging. Not the best quality
3.0,"If you are curvy, it would be best to get something twice the size. If you know you wear a Large cuz your curvy, get a 2xl or else it'll be tight showing every print"
3.0,GOOD PRICE BUT WASNT WHAT I EXPECTED
3.0,It could have been a very nice necklaces with the diamonds and the tiny clover cased in clear. Wish it had been . . .  sorry that it doesn't. Others noticed too.
3.0,I like the style but the problem with it was I had to return because the sent me the wrong size. I ended up receiving a half size smaller than what I ordered therefore it was basically what he already had and was too small.
3.0,"The chain broke quickly, but my misses replaced it and still loves it."
3.0,"I liked the concept, but the outer dress was way too big."
3.0,"Good audio quality and the hat's size was good, it fits great and has a good feel. The only negative for this is that the speakers are attached to the inside of the hat using a velcro lining and that came off the 2nd day I used it. The velcro latch is small and of poor quality, so it will fail in a few days. Having a pocket inside to hold the speakers in place (like some of the other beanies) would have been a better design perhaps. I fixed the situation by putting my own good quality velcro attachers on the speakers to hold the speakers in place. But a good hat for the price, given the great audio quality and decent battery life."
3.0,"I ordered a size larger than my husband needed, and they barely fit!  Luckily, he only needs them for getting in and out of the shower.  They are slip-resistant as promised."
3.0,"I don't like the seam running down the middle. It is very bad placement, and to be honest sometimes gives the illusion of a camel toe..."
3.0,These water shoes seem to be well made. Returning because my son won’t wear them due to the pink. It looks white when I went to order so we were surprised when they came in.
3.0,They’re not warm. I felt every bit of cold through them. But they are comfortable. I like the pockets and the feel of the fabric so they aren’t a waste of money.
3.0,Initially this dress was great for a Halloween costume but the fabric is now shredding and tearing apart just from normal kids play.
3.0,"Once I wasshed them, they wrinkle, hem is mis-sewn. Cotton not soft."
3.0,Nice looking tie but I'm not sure how well it will hold up.
3.0,"I really like the top, but the bottom is way too small. I'm an Asian size small, and it's even smaller for my Asian size"
3.0,I love it. I made a few stretches to makita work. It was big for my wrist.
3.0,"These are surprisingly comfortable and well made. Online shoe shopping can be a gamble, especially with kids. We ordered these in two sizes initially (a 9 and a 13) The reason I say initially is because with “rough” wear they didn’t hold up great. My 7 yr old would step on the back so often they stopped staying on and became more like slides. Then I ordered him a size down, but the same thing happened. So for gentle use they are fantastic! But if you have a rough and tumble kid like mine they won’t last that long."
3.0,They are ok. The material isn't my favorite and they are just a tiny but too big so the scrunch doesn't really work on me. I wear a size 1 jeans and I ordered a small in these... I'll wear them but wouldn't buy them again
3.0,"Good quality shirt, but XXL???  This is the normal size for me and everything is comfortable, these were tight fitting.  If this is your normal size, don't get them."
3.0,"It fits well everywhere -- But somehow it's too short...  And I'm 5'1&#34;, so not sure how that happened..."
3.0,quality not there
3.0,These are very small!! They fit my 6 year old well. These did NOT fit my hubby who we bought them for. They would fit a small woman or child (6-11) or so but not a Man! Also the strings stretch ALOT!!!
3.0,The razor back is really large and hard to hide in shirts. The top of the cup also fits a little lose. Okay quality and comfortable. Some of the little rhinestones were missing on the middle front clasp upon arrival.
3.0,"the tie, pocket square and cuff links were exactly as advertised.  However the tie is thicker than expected which makes tieing the tie more difficult and makes for a larger than desired knot."
3.0,"Warm, great with pockets, a little snug/tight on the sleeves. Runs small."
3.0,"Even ordering according to the size chart it was extremely short and I don’t imagine it will be wearable as a dress after being washed since it is 100% cotton, it will shrink even washing on deleicate in cold and hanging to dry. It came incredibly wrinkled and even after steaming it, getting it damp, and trying to iron it, there were still visible wrinkles. It was inexpensive and served its purpose for a picture, I wouldn’t recommend it if you’re wanting regular use."
3.0,NIce earnings.  Part that goes through the holes in ear was a little thick and hurt.
3.0,Cheaply made but will last if taken care of
3.0,They looked and felt like real metal but would only fit on out pinkies.
3.0,"I ordered based on the seller’s measurement chart. Fit was a tad big, but wearable...not baggy.<br />Mine arrived with good sized holes in the front shoulder. Looked as if something sharp fell on the fabric during construction. The holes didn’t go through to the back part of the shirt.<br />Really I should have returned it...but I kept it and put lace appliqués on the neckline to cover the holes.<br />Mine does have a nice ombré but the overall blandness of the lighter pinkish-purple at the top of the shirt makes me feel frumpy.<br />I get compliments when wearing it, but I feel like a blimp. Not sure that makes sense..."
3.0,"For a $5 and change swim suit it is not bad. I am very tall, so typically order a size up on one piece suits. This was still very, very small. The chest area felt very exposed and did not seem to be as covered as in the picture (and I'm not &#34;well endowed&#34; in that area). Overall, it's a cute trendy swimsuit, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,Not to be used for kits of walking. Best as a house shoe or a go to the grocery store type of shoe.<br />I am on my feet all day and the soles almost completely fell off. I have duct tape holding the shoes to the soles
3.0,It's not upto my expectations pls need more kwality
3.0,I ordered hot pink but it looks red.
3.0,"These are nicely sized socks, but they are extremely thin and do not last long. I purchased this pack of 6 pairs for myself to wear with boat shoes in March 2016. I wore them moderately, mostly during summer. And now in February 2017, I have 2 pairs of socks left since every other sock got a huge hole in them. The grippy heel is amazing and stays put, I just wish they were much thicker."
3.0,"I have bad swelling due to pregnancy, so i bought these compression socks to help. They fit comfortably and the colors are nice. They are snug and not loose. Unfortunately, i don't think they work so well. I put them on in the morning and have been wearing them for 6hrs now. As you can see from the photo, my foot and leg is significantly swollen. The only part that isn't swollen is where the elastic is the tightest around my ankle."
3.0,Not a good fit for people with large calves
3.0,"Look great and I love wearing them, after wearing them for 3 weeks the nose pads fell off.  Really wish they would last longer."
3.0,"Broke after approximately 6 months of continuous use. Never removed them, till claps broke"
3.0,"Silk is great, the fit is so so, kinda tight on the rear."
3.0,Can't sleep it's so loud
3.0,"This looks cute in the pictures, but it’s really frumpy in person. It’s a thin microfiber fabric, that can feel scratchy on dry skin."
3.0,It's cute but fits weirdly.  Slips up and back unless tied under your chin and I'm not five years old so....no.  I wish it fit better. Only wore it twice all winter and we had a cold one.
3.0,"Such a bummer. I have a small torso and I like this style of shirt. But it's too small. My partner is a little skinnier than me, so maybe she'll get some wear out of it. I'm a medium and I ordered an XL. Should have ordered and XXL"
3.0,"I purchased this to be a decoration for one of my collector's items so I do not use it myself, but I would imagine that a regular person using it would break it easily. It is also too long for a wrist so you would have a long chain dangling from your wrist or ankle. For what I purchased it for, though, I am very happy with this purchase."
3.0,I expected alligator clips
3.0,These are cute but the color scraped off very easy.
3.0,If your righted handed and want bracelets on that wrist it’s that easy to do with left hand
3.0,"Looks great, but broke within a week."
3.0,"Cheap fabric, kind of a crunchy scratchy texture"
3.0,"So,so."
3.0,"Not as good as advertised.  It does the job, but very little"
3.0,It’s a good material<br />Comfortable<br />Fits well
3.0,Very cute but a bit see through and it fits like a junior size with a 4-6 so sending back.
3.0,"The shirt is fine, and the fit is okay, but the pants are extremely long. There’s about 8 inches of extra material at the bottom. We will mos likely be returning them, since I don’t have a sewing machine to fix it."
3.0,The anchors are to big for the earring and they keep turning upside down in the ear.
3.0,My son loved it but unfortunately broke when he accidentally hit his arm on the car door. I didn’t even think he hit it hard. It lasted about 2 months.
3.0,"Looks nice, got the wrong pattern pack and the fabric is not very soft, fits fine around the waist but doesn't stretch well."
3.0,Good quality it runs a little big.dont wanna returned since they don't carry half size.
3.0,I normally wear a S/M in robes the robes material is nice and soft the only thing is it fits snug and it’s too short in the arms. I thought would be room to cuddle up in it and it’s not.  Should’ve went a size up.
3.0,Buy bigger size as these tend to run small
3.0,Quality was decent but the pink color was way off from the picture. It was much much brighter pink.
3.0,I love the dress and got many compliments. Except it came without the belt. So last minute. I had to run the store to find something to go with it and spend even more money.
3.0,"these are ok. I am a small girl and bought these for post pregnancy. These do not seem to stay in place, constantly riding up under my arms...not really a fan. However they have been washed already."
3.0,Just get a small size that what I wear
3.0,"This brand runs huge and the material is very stretchy, so I bought one a size down after buying one too big. I like it, but it is too big. Made in China."
3.0,"These were a great material and well made and worked perfect for my husband.  However, they were too loose for me and just fell down almost immediately.  There was no way to adjust them."
3.0,I thought she looked nice in this suit but she thought it was just too cheesy for her to wear at the pool.
3.0,Didn’t like much the material. Already seemed worn out. Too bad the design is good.
3.0,I was looking for a more affordable option to the apple leather band but this just didn’t fit. It stuck out on the sides of the watch. I’ve purchased a number of bands but never seen one that didn’t slide in correctly and connect smoothly. It said 38/40/41 but the strap was too long for my smaller (38) wrist and didn’t stay fastened. I’ll unfortunately be returning.
3.0,Cut very small on top.. Absolutely loved everything else about it. I wanted it to fit so bad.
3.0,Runs very small loved the shirt wish it wasn't small
3.0,"The ""rose gold"" band is not the same color as the watch. Both are difficult to get on but I did like the leather one. Color transfers over really easily though, it was blue by the end of the day, wasn't even wearing blue."
3.0,The socks are a little too thick for what I had planned (sandals).
3.0,"very cute, but the stitching is pretty cheap and it ripped very easily. be careful when pulling things out of it."
3.0,Stretch the waist a bit before using because it is intensely tight. Love the length.
3.0,"I've gotten lost of compliments on this dress. I really like it. However, the white tie broke in half after a couple washes."
3.0,This was definitely a knockoff of a better brand. The fabric is not cut properly to allow for movement and the color block style is not the same as pictured.
3.0,Just okay. Not all that flattery on me (5'4 140 lbs).
3.0,"Dress is pretty, but a little low quality. It fit a little too big on my 5’4” 128 lb frame and was very long."
3.0,"I went up a size as recommended by other reviews. I’m 5’9, 160 athletic build and ordered a Large.  They fit well and are super comfy but the joggers I received have a drawstring waistband instead of the flat high waist. I really wanted the flat legging style waist band so that was disappointing. The print is also slightly different than the picture but not in a bad way."
3.0,The pjs are nice but when i washed them the diamonds stuck to each other and ruined the design.I suggest not drying in dryer.  Also these run small I ordered my son size 4 and they fit  but he wears a 2t and my oldest wears little boys size 7 but size 10 fits him snug.
3.0,You don't get the color shown.
3.0,It’s pretty cool but one of the stones came off the very next day.
3.0,The dress fits beautifully!  However there is this god-awful snap that takes away from the beauty of the lines of the dress.  It would fit fine without it.
3.0,Too cheap material
3.0,it was much smaller than expected
3.0,Cheap material...not true to size
3.0,"Great front screen protector , however i thought the back protector would be like a invisible clear (see thru)  but its not its like a dark clear."
3.0,stretchy but super long
3.0,"Waiste loo high, sits an inch under breast. Arm sleeves a bit tight. But dress is beautiful, really wished tHe cut flattered long waisted ladies."
3.0,"It's a nice product, but not very tough<br />quality for my trouble boy, it's already starts to break. Probably not the sneakers, but my son, cause he moves a lot and kicks anything"
3.0,"These are great if you are having a party and can decorate your wine glasses ahead of time, but they are not PERMANENT, so keep that in mind. Can also be used to identify glasses, similar to wine charms, but the pens make the glasses more customizable. I rec'd this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review."
3.0,Cheap turned my daughter  green in one wear
3.0,This underwear makes you very uncomfortably warm and feminine products will not stick to the lining of the underwear.
3.0,nice stretch however the zipper was broken when it arrived
3.0,The chokers are well made and pretty good quality. I deducted one star from giving this product a 4 because some of the chokers are too big and hang loosely at the bottom of my neck.
3.0,"i know amazon deals with alot of generic brands trying to get their business going, so when looking for sleeveless hoodies i was skeptic. the hoodies are well made and the colors looked nice, pretty thin but good airflow. Only problem is the hood is too big and loose when on your head"
3.0,It’s a lovely dress but a bit too tight. I take it bcos it is elastic and hence I can use it.
3.0,"Unfortunately, these swim goggles fog up quite badly when lap swimming.  It’s great that I can see when they aren’t fogged up, but it’s frustrating that I have to stop every few laps to rinse them to see again."
3.0,"Nothing special, I actually found another one that was more protective and still collapsible and leather."
3.0,It fits good and material is smooth. Came on time too! Idk if i like how it looks on me. Probably needs some accessories and ill be good.
3.0,"Very comfortable, but made poorly it's already coming apart at the seams. Also very large and I ordered down a size"
3.0,"Style was great but the color in person is a RED canvas, not a rosy pink as the pics suggest. I am not a 'red' person or I'd have kept it. Ordered another color instead."
3.0,It’s cute! A little small but it’s a cute little addition to the key ring 😊
3.0,The size is cut a little smaller than normal
3.0,"Very long for the size, my daughter likes it though."
3.0,Cute outfit but the material is somewhat cheap and thin. Wrinkles very easy and runs small. Order a size up.
3.0,Sadly this necklace did not look as good in real life.
3.0,"Love the look, but it's hard to put on your versa."
3.0,Can’t quite get the wrinkles out.  Nice color though. Nice style.
3.0,"This is a very cute, dainty ring. I don't think it would fit more than a size 6, and that is stretching it."
3.0,"I ended up returning this item because it fit kinda weird. I was expecting it to fit a little bigger so that it would be comfy to wear, but it was tight on my butt and very loose on my crotch. Kinda weird fitting"
3.0,"I am a 30DD but only 5 feet tall and 90 pounds, and ordered the XS. It was way too tight, the zipper wouldn't stay up, it kept popping down. I was hesistant to order a size up because I didn't like how thick the zipper was- you could see it very visibly under a workout tank, it looked weird and bulky, the zipper poked out. I like my sports bras to be sleek, so I ordered another one of this same brand that's a traditional sports bra and it's better for what I wanted."
3.0,It's ok wish it was larger but whatever.
3.0,Good fit and soft fabric.
3.0,This one is super long. I was hoping the length would of been shorter. & I ordered a small.
3.0,Top is too big.. bottom is perfect! I am a large and got an xl.
3.0,It doesn't look very good on you.it's too big
3.0,Llego sin capucha
3.0,"I like all the different colors that they sent, they do not wash up that great. I got them for a face cover for Covid."
3.0,"A little baggy and long, so had to wear heels. The material was also thin. Otherwise, good."
3.0,"I love the design of this watch and find it to be very fashionable. The watch is pretty good quality, but does have a few delicate parts in the fastening straps. Obviously this is to be expected with a watch this low of a price"
3.0,I bought two pairs of these pants and the other ones fit perfect. These ones fall off when I run. They are super comfortable though. Just wish they fit a little better.
3.0,They don't fit a kid that is a little older than 8ish.
3.0,"My wife has been needing new sunglasses. She prefers brown lenses over blue or gray, because she feels they don’t distort colors or make it seem dark outside when she wears them. She also wanted something that wasn’t too big, fit comfortably and looks stylish. These fit the bill somewhat.<br /><br />On the plus side, the gold-tone frames are solid, but flexible. Therefore, they fit comfortably and seem like they will last. The soft rubber over the ends of the earpieces helps them stay put. She likes that the nose-pieces are soft silicone that only contact the bridge of her nose in a small area, so she doesn’t sweat so much in the heat.<br /><br />The problem is, they seem awfully big. The nose piece measures about 20 mm, which is a bit larger than average. The entire bridge of the glasses is over 140 mm. The lenses are almost perfectly round, measuring over 50 mm in diameter (52 x 54). When either she or I put them on, we look a lot like we’re wearing a pair of Elton John’s signature sunglasses! We’d rather they were more oval than circular, so they didn’t stand out so much on your face. Since they are not contoured at all, seem to stick out from her face a bit, which lets a lot of sunlight in at the sides.<br /><br />The price is high, too. At the time of this review, these were going for almost $30. That might be okay, if they came with a nice case like other sunglasses we tried. However, all this set came with was a microfiber cloth and drawstring bag."
3.0,"I bought these ""longer"" Calf Compression Sleeves for people who are ""6 to 7 feet tall"" so they could cover all the way down my ankles, so I thought...<br /><br />• Advertisement on this page size says,<br />  L/XL fits: 15’5”-20” calves, 6”-7”- Height<br />• The chart on the BOX says,<br />  L/XL fits: 15’5”-20” calves, 6'0”-7'0”- Height<br />• The side of the BOX & a paragraph on the back of the BOX both say,<br />  L/XL fits: 12 inches to 16.5 inches, Adults up to 6'05 in height.<br />*** all inch ("") and foot/feet (') symbol punctuation typos are as they were written in the ad and on the box.<br /><br />SIZING REALITY: I am 5' 6"" tall with an 18"" circumference around the largest part of my calves, so from the advertisement (15.5-20"") I should be able to wear them, but they are too small. I know how to put on medical compression socks as I have been wearing them for years. They should be tight, but I cannot get these on!!! When I gave up, the height didn't even crest over my calves and they were not wrinkled as if they were already stretched close to full height. They seem like they were sized for kids. They do have a label ""L/XL"" inside if the top of the Calf Compression sleeves.<br /><br />THE FABRIC: 80% Nylon, 20% Spandex is the same on this page and on the box. The compression sleeves are a good quality. The problem is that they were sized wrong! I will be returning them because they do not fit.<br /><br />STAR RATING: Even though I had to go through the process of ordering, and returning (soon), I am giving them 3 stars because the compression socks seem like that have a high-quality compression and fabric. Not a perfect rating because ""size"" is the most important part! They had a fantastic price of $9.99 for 3 pairs, a great value if you can fit into them."
3.0,Didn’t like it on me. Color what showed in picture was not when I received it.
3.0,I like the robe but it is a little stiff. I also can't bend over without giving my husband a show!
3.0,Huge for fine silk scarves
3.0,nice but not exactly what i was looking for.
3.0,Nice ring butt runs a little small.
3.0,"The necklace is pretty, and hangs nicely in my cleavage.  It's not going to last very long before it tarnished and/or breaks, though."
3.0,"This dress honestly just fits weirdly, at least for me. It doesnt look too much like the photo."
3.0,i found that i do not like boxer briefs
3.0,I ordered 3 pairs of compression socks. Same brand just different styles. These are cute but they keep falling down. My other ones are just fine and stay up.
3.0,"Unfortunately i received a blue Dora towel. It’s not a huge deal because it still had a hoodie and is Dora theme. Although, I would have liked to receive the purple one i ordered rather than the blue one.<br /> Im a bit confused how it was mistaken when the blue isnt listed as an option when ordering this specific towel.<br />Overall, this one will have to do and my daughter loves it. 3 stars for the pros over cons"
3.0,"It slings to your body and other clothes you have on. I don't wear them, but will give away."
3.0,Love the pockets and fits a little loose. Just careful with the stitching as as they do tear easily.
3.0,"Got this as a gift and was told by the recipient that they were &#34;great&#34; and fit well. She wears a lot of leggings, so I take her word for it!"
3.0,Not what I thought. It's OK
3.0,"Cute,cheap little necklace.. tangles easily."
3.0,"I’m usually a solid Medium - 40” chest, 32/33 sleeve. However, this product was a little long in the torso and sleeves.  Also, the material is quite thin with minimal actually compression."
3.0,"Too tight in the bust area, arms and shoulder. Otherwise really cute!"
3.0,I ordered a 6-12 month size and it's about a 2 toddler. Way too large! The dress itself is lovely and as pictured.
3.0,Comfy around the house dress except the neck doesn't drop down enough in the front and there is no way to get it to stretch. Really irritating on the front of the neck.
3.0,Work well as liners for motorcycle helmet. They are not all the same size . Out of the 4 I can only wear 2 other 2 are to tight.
3.0,"The shirt fits great if you are from Oompaloompaland.  Order two sizes larger.  Also, the t-shirt material is almost tissue paper thin.  Wash this shirt in cold water only and let air dry or low heat in the dryer.  Caveat Emptor!"
3.0,Colors are paler than expected. Hard to tell April from June. Had to get in very bright light and placed on white paper to see which one was June. Both look clear inside the locket.
3.0,After reading other reviews I ordered 2 sizes up. That was a mistake. Dress was too big. I did not find this dress flattering to my figure. I had to return the dress. Material was fine but I would advise to wear a slip or something under the dress as it is a thin material.
3.0,"While this dress is cute, it's definitely more t-shirt-like than I expected. Luckily I got a lightning deal on this, or I probably would have retured it, due to quality. Would be fine to wear in a more casual work environment"
3.0,Really cute and exactly as pictured. Does not hold up well at all though. The pockets on mine came off (literally just fell off) so now I wear it after a workout or around the house. Still cute. Just get what you pay for.
3.0,It did the job. Not great quality but the toddler loved it and it was really just for a single use anyway.
3.0,"I like how this sweater is a thicker, actual sweater like material. My only problem is it snags SO easy. I got the first one and it came snagged, reordered it and got it, wore it for less than 30 minutes and it was snagged too! I've never had a sweater do that before so I feel like it wasnt just my fault..."
3.0,The pads were a good bonus but not necessary for my needs.  My patient has a very inflated foot from edema and needs traction on the wooden floors to walk.  Tried XL product with another supplier which didnt work so tried XXL through your company.  still too tight and wont go on the patient.
3.0,"They work, but the velcro closure is not very sturdy, be gentle or reglue that part."
3.0,Pretty. Lightweight. Two sizes small.
3.0,Too small in the chest area. And I ordered a 2x.
3.0,I washed these before I wore them the first time. I went to put them on and there was a 2 inch hole in the back seam!
3.0,"I bought this as a cooler substitute for the entire suit, as I live in a hot area. While it works wonderfully, the head positioning is awkward. The head had a strap inside to place your head, but for me, that would block the viewing area. If I wore it with the viewing area in front of me, the dinosaur head faces upwards towards the sky. While it certainly helped me stay cool, I honestly found the full on suit much more comfortable. Sometimes the area to wrap around my head hugged my throat a bit too tightly, despite the actual head being too big. I'd say if it gets cold where you are, buy a full suit, it's so much more comfortable. But this is alright for going out in the heat as a dinosaur. I'd still say just get the suit, though."
3.0,These hats appear to be great quality but they seem to be made for children.<br /><br />Way too small for most adult sized heads.
3.0,"The pants are very soft and comfy. The large fits well around my waist and bum area. However, the pant legs are not long enough. I am only 5'7 and the pants stop a solid 2 inches above my ankles which is very annoying. I will be keeping them because i will use them to lounge in but if you are on the taller side I wouldn't bother unless you iike that type of look."
3.0,"The color is correct.  But, the texture was not as expected.  However, the band is definitely satisfactory.  However, the stems for the 20 mm Suede Vintage Leather Watch Band are too small (barely 21 mm) for my watch and I cannot remove and replace them because of a locking mechanism.  This mechanism is a good idea. But, if something happens to the stems, you cannot replace them without tearing up the sleeve in which they are stored."
3.0,"Runs a bit on the smaller side.  Cameo pattern is a lot more pronounced in real life, looks very modern, not as much camo."
3.0,Cute design<br />Very short
3.0,"This shirt is huge huge huge- even a medium. The sleeves are the show stopper of this shirt. As much as I like the sleeves, once I washed, the shirt is a wrinkly mess."
3.0,Bought as a gift for my daughter for christmas. She loved it and as well as i. Only problem was that of the head opening was a little to tight. Aand no my child doesn't have a larger head. It is normal for her age and growth chart. Other than that it's fine.
3.0,Way too big.  Looks like I’m wearing a tent (in a small!)
3.0,"Nice, soft material, but the neckline is a bit loose - stretched out."
3.0,It says light but it’s very heavy
3.0,"It is very well made and I love the pockets.  I hate the feel of the material it is made out of.  The material doesn't give at all, so when you move or sit down it binds you.  Never seen material that looks like this stuff.  It is very thin, shinny and not comfortable to wear."
3.0,I thought they would be a bit wider. They look good though
3.0,"You get what you pay for.  It was ineexpensive and has worked fine so far (I've only had it for about a month), but the zipper runs pretty rough and likely won't last."
3.0,"The item is okay.  You get what you pay for.  It is cute, but cheaply made and was WAY small."
3.0,"Bracket does create a pocket within the mask to help breathing. However, your breath is wet and raises humidity inside the bracket rather being mostly absorbed by the mask. Silicone then gets wet and sticky fast. The clips don’t work as soon as you pull down the mask. They come loose. But it still stayed in the mask. You may have to reposition every so often. Can’t complain about the price.  May be better to get masks with bracket built in."
3.0,These are for kids
3.0,The material of this dress is stretchy but I didn’t size up and ordered a small so it was super clingy where the pockets are which created a bulge at the pockets. The pockets dont lay flat unfortunately. I returned and plan on ordered again but from a different brand.
3.0,I had read to order a size up and did. It is too tight. I am a size 6 and ordered a Medium. I think it would be a great product if it was sized appropriately as I liked the material and look of it.
3.0,"Worked great until about 6 months in use, it snapped off at the connector to the Gear product, breaking the bezel.<br />I now had to purchase a new type of band, one that the gear fits into, rather than just a new band to connect to the gear."
3.0,It’s ok. It doesn’t look like the picture.
3.0,"Decent product, just not the right size for me.  Returned."
3.0,"First, sizes on Amazon are US sizes even though Parfait comes in UK sizes. Make sure you convert UK sizes into US sizes before ordering. I purchased a 32I according to Amazon, received a 32G (UK size).<br /><br />I like that it's cotton and very soft, unique among non-padded bras. I think with a good fit, this would be my favorite everyday bra! Unfortunately the band was too loose, so I got no support. I think I really needed a 30GG (or 30J, US), which unfortunately they don't make."
3.0,The material is really soft but the neck of the shirt is made really strange. I felt as if I had received an after market item. I loved the color though
3.0,Its pretty nice but it's a little bit too shiny and really hard to adjust.
3.0,Nice quality. But I reccomend ordering 2-3 sizes larger than you wear.
3.0,so tight I can't get it on the stocking donner..very difficult to get on but once on it is my favorite cottony material and pattern/style..would be 5 stars if I could get it on easily
3.0,"Used once.  The clips broke on both shoes, 1 on each shoe.  Still not sure how.<br />BUT if that had not broken, I would use some more... served their purpose, once."
3.0,Fit great and color was good but I didn’t like the shiny quality of the fabric.
3.0,"These are decent shirt stays and get the job done, however my only complainant is that they are not durable for long periods of time, especially if you are doing something active. Nothing is more annoying than feeling a shirt stay pop off at the beginning of your shift. If you're LE/Military I recommend something that has a more aggressive design that actually holds only your shirt fabric. For some reason these plastic &#34;teeth&#34; don't really hold onto your fabric as well as other shirt stays."
3.0,"I tried so hard to love these glasses. They are comfortable and look great. But they gave me a headache because the peripheral shield are clear BUT like frosted material, so the lower quadrant of vision and sides are blurry. Unfortunately my vainness cannot take over the physical effects."
3.0,Huge! The eye pieces are massive. Looks very goofy!
3.0,"These are fairly decent socks.  The low cut design makes them easy to wear and on my Women's size 12 feet, they work well.  They aren't the highest quality so I'm not sure how long they will hold up to regular use.  They wash pretty well although there was shrinking in the dryer, even though I washed and dried them at medium temperatures.  The dark gray is nice and neutral so I'm able to wear them with several types of casual outfits.  I'm interested to see how these work and wear with ankle boots this fall.  I usually have issues with ladies socks being too short or too wide, if they are a larger size, but these Men's socks work really well for me."
3.0,It arrived crunched up in a small bag.  I will have to bring it to a professional cleaner to get all the wrinkles out.  I'm hoping it looks much better then.  But there is now way I can possibly press the dress on my own -- it is that extensive.
3.0,Tight fit for an xl... don't stretch... came in a nice box though and are good quality but too tight for me.
3.0,Cute shrug but fit needs to be better.  I guess I needed to order a smaller size.  It’s rather boxy.
3.0,"Unfortunately the bracelet is very cheap:( I had to mold it every which way to look nice on my wrist..its ok, not a lot of money so that's what u get...I like it"
3.0,"Lower quality material, won't last long. My 12 year old daughter is thin and this is almost too small for her."
3.0,"Very cute suit but if u have a large bust, this is not for u. It fits nicely on the bottom half but the bust area is way too small."
3.0,"When I got it I was excited! But when I tried the product on, it didn't quite live up to what I was expecting. In the picture, it has a much more lengthy and slimmer look to it, especially around the neck area. This is my style of clothing and thus what I expected when I made the purchase.<br /><br />The quality of the fabric is suitable for the price you pay, but the style is just a tad off of what is advertised. I will keep it, as it is a fashionable item. Just wish the neck area wasn't so wide."
3.0,Light on hat only lasted 30 minutes then burnt out
3.0,"The shipping was BEYOND slow, the kept changing the delivery date to the point I just stop waiting for it. However, I’m using these for my Christina piercing and it’s cute. I wish I was able to unscrew the bottom piece because it looks a lil bulky."
3.0,I'm a pear so the bottom fits better than the top. Had to order a size smaller for the top.
3.0,comfy. but only giving three stars since they're really thin. i won't be wearing these out of the house. but they're still nice for lounge wear. a section of the inside left seam didn't line up so there was a hole. but 10 minutes of simple sewing fixed it.
3.0,The straps are not adjustable if they were I would give this a 4 star.
3.0,"They're really oversized, bought them for my wife who is petite and they ended up too big."
3.0,"Dress nice soft cotton, give it a 3 stars due dress not being exactly as pictured...We picked the dress due to the way it was designed with the baggy sides...Well no baggy sides just straight up and down with pockets...Ordered size Large and very comfortable but was hoping for the pictured looked...Better luck next time...."
3.0,"Fine for a quick run, but not great for being out in the cold for a couple hours or more.  Heating elements were not nearly as big as the description shows, but are all in the right spots according to the images.  Puffer style is cute but means you have to wear thin layers underneath in order to feel the heat... might as well wear your thick layers and a regular coat, would keep you as warm.  On medium heat, I got 4 hours out of a standard 10,000mAh power bank (no power is included).  Having ordered two diff styles, this vest didn't heat up as well as the other."
3.0,Material is some kind of rough cotton and pants are completely see through . Coloring is a bit more pastel in person. The fit is fine
3.0,"The fishnet layer is quality and sewn in better than I expected. The cuts in the fabric over that are very raw. My complaint is the cut and shape of the pants. They fit awkwardly, like there is not enough fabric to cover the bum area and way too much in front as they pull up higher than the belly button area. I had to double check they weren't on backwards. First time wearing them out they became stretched and baggy in some areas and I had to keep pulling them up in the back. This was not a sizing issue, this was a cut and quality issue."
3.0,"The mask, a medium, is not so big. The frame to lift it away from the face is small and flimsy-like the bar over the nose of a KN95.  I do not think this is even as good as the KN95 that I have been using."
3.0,"To pay money for something and then find a hole in it...utterly ridiculous. It is cute but the hole factor is a no go.<br /><br />I'm  not sure how long the fabric will hold up so I just use it as lounge wear at home. I'm 5'7"" and it is very long on me."
3.0,"Contrary to most of reviews on here, this was bigger in terms of the cup size than I expected. There's a slight gap on the top and sides. In order to achieve that cleavage look, I had to really tighten the drawstrings to the point where the bra clumped up on the bottom. I typically wear a borderline 34 A/B size but I ordered a 36 B just in case. Unfortunately, the drawstrings loosens after a few minutes of wearing it, which diminishes cleavage line. Overall it’s OK I guess, it only half achieved what I hoped for. I'm not sure if a smaller size would have worked better."
3.0,"Purchased for my tween daughter for hanging out in the pool. The coverage was great but the quality was not so wonderful. We are used to high-quality suits and this one started falling apart after a few uses. Quality matches the price. This suit does run big, thinner material."
3.0,"I had bought this exact dress in black and LOVED the material, length, everything. I ordered the black/white striped and it was a totally different item; the material, the length, the fit. I am 5'3"" and it fell almost 0.5"" above my ankles."
3.0,The top was pretty large compared to the size of the bottoms.  It was out of proportion with each other.
3.0,Super soft but runs short.
3.0,Not the high quality I was expecting. I have some $20 glasses that are just as good.
3.0,I’m 5”1 159 lbs bought size large but the pants roll down on my stomach Not sure to go bigger or smaller in size so the waist doesn’t roll down ??? Any opinions welcomed
3.0,Looks like the glasses from that hit show from a distance. But once you're up close & personal this item seems more like a kiddie or costume item...
3.0,"I got this to organize gadget cords for travel.  I had read the many positive reviews and mentions in &#34;organization&#34; articles.<br /><br />the elastic does work to hold a variety of items securely.<br /><br />When I finally got it, I was disappointed because:<br />1.  the elastic is only on one side...the other side is totally blank and a waste of surface area<br />2.  the backing for the board is thick--thicker than 2-ply cardboard. it is also heavy.  if the manufacturer had used a sheet of plastic (like the kind that they use for flexible binder covers), it would be thinner and lighter.<br /><br />for travel, a similar size plastic pencil bag is much lighter and cheaper."
3.0,"These scrubs were a little larger than I anticipated, but being scrubs, I guess too loose is better than too tight. I am 5'7"" and weigh 135 lbs - I ordered a small. All the pockets are very nice. It is drawstring only with no additional elastic waist, and the ""buttonhole"" sewn openings for the drawstring look like they will fray and come apart rather quickly, especially with all the tying and untying throughout the day for bathroom breaks. The price point for the quality doesn't work for me so I will not be ordering any additional sets of these scrubs."
3.0,"I really wanted to like these, but the xl I normally order in reebok pants was too big and sloppy... returned"
3.0,"its okay, decent quality. was too small so I'm going to put this in the hand me down pile. its very cute and the skirt has shorts in them."
3.0,Too snug not flattering for small size person.  I really like the top. Will wear around the house
3.0,I the white is nice but is kinder wid on the front of the shoe
3.0,Nice and clear but fog up really bad. They seem durable. Vents would help tremendously.
3.0,"These glass's don't really fit right, but that is an easy fix."
3.0,Very cute but one of the suspenders was backwards
3.0,I ordered according to MEASUREMENTS but was too small.
3.0,Es un poco incómoda al colocármela.
3.0,a bit floppier than i had hoped for
3.0,I got this to go with granddaughter thought ok shows little it’s ok😱I had to alter drastically to avoid a mishap top cut WAY to low and revealing also pants satiny material and tight DO NOT bend over
3.0,I loved the color got dirty so quick
3.0,"The fabric is much thinner than previous items i've had like this.  Also, it runs small compared to other companies!"
3.0,"Fits weird on me. The texture is medium weight and medium softness. I'm 5'6.5, ~150lbs, mommy belly and this is a tiny bit too short and kinda too loose and too snug at the same time. There is a lot of fabric on the lower half so it's not as flattering as it would be if it was lighter fabric and less large.<br /><br />I'm certain there are people this would look good on but it personally wasn't nice enough for a wedding."
3.0,kinda weird material
3.0,"Too small in the chest, I'll be giving it to my sister to enjoy. Beautiful dress otherwise."
3.0,It's gorgeous just a little big.
3.0,"I like the weight and comfort of this bed jacket, but it does lack pockets for phone.  That's my only criticism."
3.0,I like the way the feel but they are way to big and wide. I would order a size or 2 down.
3.0,"The posts are pretty easily bendable, which I suppose could be good, except that the silver one snapped all the way off. They came packaged by color, all in a bubble envelope. Except it came USPS which means of course it got smashed between other items, it being so small. So. That's great. I wanted to use the silver ones, too. $10 says they tarnish almost immediately. I'll come back and redo this if they are any better or worse than I think. Haven't even worn them yet."
3.0,White dress is see through :-/
3.0,perfectly comfortable just looks like something you'd wear to bed instead of outside in public more like a stylish slip
3.0,nothing fancy but a nice buy for the price
3.0,"I bought THREE of these bonnets for an upcoming trek expecting, or at least hoping for a variety of colors.  I got THREE OF THE VERY SAME COLOR AND PRINT!!  THREE!! I'm TOTALLY disappointed that they would send me three of the exact same thing! The ones that I got match the picture of the bonnet someone posted in their comments. It is a pretty light yellow color and small floral print but THREE OF THE SAME!!!  It does say that these are for a child, but someone asked if the large would fit an adult and the answer was yes.  So I bought the large size and guess what, they don't! I don't have a big head by any means and they are too skimpy and small all over. They really would be perfect for little girls from maybe five to twelve years old. It's a good thing I have granddaughters who would love to dress up in these. After anticipating my order for over a week, I am totally sad and disappointed when I opened my box today! The trek is in five days so there's not enough time to find another bonnet! SIGH! Be aware that these bonnets are one per order and definitely a YOUTH size.  And of course…you can't pick your own color!"
3.0,Love the material.  Wished it would have fit . I ordered like I was suppose to .
3.0,"I purchased an M and have a 38&#34; bust so I would say these fit maybe a little bit larger but not by much. The fabric is somewhat thin so it really showed my lace bra outline a bit more than I would like. You probably wouldn't be able to wear this out without a tank underneath or something very streamlined / smooth. The print is nice in person though. The length of it is very short-- I am only 5'1 so it just covers my tush, but only just. The color on the other hand is true to photos."
3.0,The purse looks as it does in the photo.  It's not that bad and I am using it.  Very basic.
3.0,"great feel, but they're too loose."
3.0,"Cute jean nice material, but runs large had to return them"
3.0,"This dress, didn't fit me well. It's more for a straight shaped person."
3.0,"This dress has a roomy fit that I do not find flattering. If it was cinched in a little at the waist it would be perfect, but the fit is too baggy for my taste."
3.0,Thick material. A little itchy.
3.0,"It's nice, but had to paint touch up. Because it wore off to easy. I would recommend this item for a child."
3.0,"Got this for my teenage daughter as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. She's big into wearing slouch beanies. She said this one fits tight around her head and feels weird because of the positioning of the speakers. I'd probably recommend this be for a younger child because of the fit, or if you have a tiny head. She said the Bluetooth and speakers work as they should"
3.0,I like the necklace. It is nice.  I haven't worn it yet but will go with a lot of different things.
3.0,"Pretty earrings and I'm keeping them, but they are smaller than the ones shown on the mannequin."
3.0,"I like the style but wear the brim in front unfolded, it is a little tight"
3.0,Order a size bigger and was just right he is 8 and I end up getting a 10 and was a bit small wanted to fit loser but didn’t happen
3.0,It's okay but not that comfortable. The straps cut into the back of my underarms and it wasn't as smoothing as I expected. I'll wear it for this one upcoming event and then I'll see.
3.0,"Cute dress that runs large . It looks cute from a distance but the fabric is quite cheap and it doesn't have a lining. I'm 5'4"" and 115lbs and ordered a small and it was WAY too big . I don't think an extra small would even be the correct size for me."
3.0,These shoes look very nice and they have a sensible heel for work but I have a high instep and they dig into the bone below my big toe and so cannot be worn for long periods of time.
3.0,"Its cute and soft. BUT..IT SHEDS terribly. Could never wear it out like as a sweater...white fuzz on everything. Washed once before I wore it. Its is my robe now. Cute over silky nightgowns, and no fuzz 🤷‍♀️"
3.0,you can't wear it more than one time
3.0,"stitching is incomplete , velcro is hanging on by literally a thread other then faulty craftsmanship it is pretty good especially once you finish sweing it together properly"
3.0,The only reason I’ve given this a three star is because it’s absolutely miserable to get the wrinkles out of it. And then it kind of returns to its former wrinkles. If it was made out of a different fabric it would be awesome. Even so I like the color I like the fit I like the style.
3.0,I find these very hard to open. It is a two handed operation!
3.0,"This romper looks drapey on the model. However if you're over a size 10, it's not drapey at all. I have a belly and this just accentuated it instead camouflaging it. I didn't care for the material. It's thick and has a very synthetic feel to it. I returned this item."
3.0,This shirt has a vinyl design. So I do expect it to probably crack after a few washes. Shipping took quite awhile so be sure to order early!
3.0,The style of dress & print I loved however the fabric made the dress look cheap.
3.0,I like the dress<br />The chest is so big that I cant wear it
3.0,Nice. Gave as a gift.
3.0,"The chain is very weak, but I am going to add my own stronger one because the clasps are strong."
3.0,I ordered a size  2T and received a size 4. It's way too big but I guess she can wear it in a couple of years. I'm disappointed because This was supposed to be for my 2 year old for Christmas. It is really cute and feels warm though. I just hope she still like the Trolls when she gets big enough to wear.
3.0,"Its cute, a little low under the armpit so I need to make sure my bra matches. Its very long even if I put on heels it will still be too long. The torso is short and has NO give. I like it and don't want to return it, so I will make it work."
3.0,I ordered according to the chart and it was still too small.  It's also not very easy to get into.
3.0,"I bought these to wear over my heavily moisturized hands in bed.  They're actually pretty snug, which makes them NOT one size fits all."
3.0,Love the marerial. Fits weird though
3.0,"This is my second purchase from Doublju and compared to the first, it runs large. At 5'1 and 125lbs, I took a medium in their skater dress, but needed a small in this. It is really feminine  and very flattering, I am bottom-heavy and was worried the ruffle would accentuate my hips, but I don't think it really does. It reaches to upper thigh in the front, mid-thigh in the back. The material is very soft and stretchy, but thin so you will need a layer under lighter colors.<br /><br />I came back after buying a dark color (eggplant) to add that the elastic band can be seen in parts.  I didn't notice it with the ivory because the elastic is white. I took off a star for this, because is black elastic really that much more expensive than white? Or is it really that hard to sew it in a better way? I would not buy another dark color in this because it really bothers me and cheapens up the look quite a bit. Still love it in ivory, though."
3.0,"This product would be great for standard size heels.  I thought the product said that two pairs in two different sizes came in the package, but I only got ones that were the same size.  I can see if you don't have the exact right size heels that these would not work.  The heels I got for my wedding ended up having a half circle heel, so I might try to make these work, or just keep them and make them work for other heels that I have."
3.0,These shoes are cute just not super comfortable
3.0,This is a beautiful sweater but I ignored a number of reviews mentioning that they had trouble with the zipper. My son got this for Christmas and the zipper didn't work. It was otherwise a beautiful sweater. Gave one to both of my sons and they both needed a size smaller than they wear. The other son's sweater didn't have trouble with the zipper but he needed to return it for a smaller size. Hoping the zipper on the new one works.
3.0,"It is very light and the wide handle works well... BUT the zipper is crappy plastic and doesn't last if you over stuff it, as my daughter does. I would give it 5 stars if they used a metal zipper."
3.0,Really cheaply made unfortunately.
3.0,"Pretty cute, if not a little cheapy. Also, even though they're plastic as opposed to metal, they're not very &#34;flexible&#34;... I've been wearing the clear one, and it seems the gemstone fell out at some point. :( No idea if it was just defective, or if the setting just isn't that great in these in general.<br /><br />Considering the price, though, it's to be expected that they're not going to be absolutely perfect and high quality."
3.0,The mirror is starting th have spots
3.0,"They came very wrinkled. They are all too loose for me, so I had to redo them myself. I wasn't very happy but hey, they are cheap and I got many! So I guess it's ok!"
3.0,Letters were creased even after washing. Kind of cheaply made. Will not last for more than one season...
3.0,"I'm too old for these first of all.  They are so big, around 3"" in diameter it's not my taste.  I'm not returning them, too much trouble.  How I wish I understood their size, because if they were half their size I might quite like them."
3.0,"The fabric is nice and it’s made well. There are 2 drawbacks however, sleeves are too long and jacket itself is way too short."
3.0,I am 5'9 and ordered an extra large (I wear a size 12). Go up a size especially if you have a long torso.  It runs very short in the torso area so it rides. I will be returning mine.  It is well made for the price and the color red is NOT apple red it's more of a cranberry.
3.0,"I'm around 5'4, and the dress is rather short. I wear spandex shorts underneath this dress because I feel as though if the wind would blow a certain way the dress will blow up along with it.<br />Another thing is that it is more of a size medium than a small.<br />I will also say the dress is bleach white, because the pictures make it seem more creamy (in my opinion).<br />but it is very comfortable and cute."
3.0,Too long but I had to cut and hem ! Took four inches off
3.0,"I loved my bracelet...and I ordered a few of them. I  charged my bracelet and wore it everyday, recharging using moon magic. BUT....the string has gotten so weak. It is tearing up. Maybe using a wire would be better."
3.0,Beautiful product just took forever to get here
3.0,These are good for the reason I want them. I am not expecting support but do like it keeps you from bouncing all over. Also provides for high beam coverage. I would buy again.
3.0,The hat itself is ok as a hat. The emblem on front is not quality. It looks cheap and does not look like it will last.
3.0,"Product size was smaller than expected. Ordered my normal size, but the shirt was two sizes smaller. The tag in the shirt said the right size that I ordered. Order bigger if you do buy."
3.0,"Fit is on small side. Wife ended up giving to a neighbor, because it shrank in the wash, she didn't even dry it just hung it up to dry. Not a good product."
3.0,"I like the ways these look, and the are quite comfortable.  The problem with them is they aren't tall like most dress socks.  They feel like wearing kids socks."
3.0,The bottom was to small
3.0,Cute! Too is too big but pants fit cute... same they don’t let it be a mix in sizes!
3.0,"I wear a size 12 or 14 dress, but this was very tight in the size 2xl. It's hard to tell exactly where the waistline/hip is supposed to fit because the top half runs short. On the plus side the fabric is really good quality and it's a well-made garment"
3.0,I love this necklace. I have one for myself I purchased locally. I came in a nice box with a card with the “pause” poem. The one I ordered from Amazon for a friend did not have either. Not gift worthy but price was higher. Disappointed.
3.0,"The product is exactly as shown on the website, although it was fairly thin, so not sure how much sun protection I actually get. I would say it's more for a fashion statement."
3.0,"It’s way too big for my wrist and just falls off, and it’s too tight for my ankle.<br />I can’t even wear it 😩"
3.0,I felt the leg width/opening was more like a wide leg pant rather than a straight leg pant. Did not look good on me at all. I have the Back Beauty Skinny pant which I LOVE.
3.0,"Nose opening is really small. Looks a little funny, but I really do love the style of these!"
3.0,"I loved the quality of the fabric and color (blue) of this shirt, there is only one problem. It runs VERY small. I would say, order 1-2 sizes up from what you typically wear. In terms of comfort and length, I can't really comment on that because it didn't fit me. If it had, I think I would have really liked it."
3.0,"These run large- I have an above average sized 3yr old boy and these are big. But, they kept his hands warm and dry and he can get his thumb into the right hole, so we'll keep them and use them again next year"
3.0,Pretty but weird. Color is strange.  Looks old and in nees to be polish. haven't find clothes to use it yet.
3.0,love but I have ripped two already but they are still really cute
3.0,The filter pocket has no lock so filter is easy to lost.
3.0,These do not last long meaning you might get about 6 months out of them if worn everyday for school. The kids said they are comfortable so for the price I guess they are pretty good.
3.0,"Not what I expected, seems like all polyester with no give to it. I purposely ordered a bigger size and it still seemed to fit oddly in places. Nice romper, but not really for curvy women."
3.0,"I love the saying on them. But you get what you pay for. They feel like very cheap..I'm not sure.. hard plastic? They will only be worn once so I wasn't to upset with it, hence why I looked for a cheap, yet nice looking version of cuff links. There was a lot of what looked like a tarnish on them.  Came off some what when rubbed with my fingers. My fiance will more than likely just wear these for the wedding and that's it. So, they do the job."
3.0,"Great necklace, however the chain has started to tarnish and doesn't look as nice as it did when I first bought it. Considering putting the Lava rock on a different chain."
3.0,Beautifully packaged. Speedy delivery. Wonderful colors. Just disappointed in the size. Not nearly as long or big as pictured. Child-like proportions.
3.0,Returned because it was too large.  Ordered a medium - I'm usually a 6/7.
3.0,There is a stone missing!
3.0,Average quality material. The print was not as sharp and clear as it should be. But useable.
3.0,The shirt is soft and is a true size 10
3.0,Looks and fits nicely. I have a slightly narrow face and most shades are too wide foe me. This while a little wide still look good on and most important provides excellent sun protection for my eyes. Viewing is very clear when in direct sunlight and prevents glare when driving.
3.0,Color is not as gray as I would like but the bag works well and stores a lot.
3.0,Nice and stretchy.  However it is very thin.
3.0,Do not buy Small if your feet are size 8 or 8.5 Men USA. The description says small fits size 8 UK which is equal to 8.5 USA. I returned them and ordering size Medium. I will update after I use them for quality review.
3.0,"It was suppose to be 2 different styles, each style has 12 beautiful colors and each color has 3 pieces,<br />As you can see, for March I only got 1 combined on both.  2 on January, 2 on June, 2 on October.  3 for a color not even on the chart, November 6 big and 3 little.<br />Disappointed none for March.  I would not order again, if you make jewelry and need all the months."
3.0,"I hate piling on layers of clothing in the wintertime, so these leggings are perfect! They're flexible and fleece lined; I can wear them in cold weather while walking the dog. I was supposed to get the 3-pack in black, grey and navy blue, but they all look black to me."
3.0,Was a great price but was too big in the bust area and the zipper was very faulty..had to put clear polish on the zipper to keep it from separating and safety pins under my arms to make the top more snug..
3.0,"Love the design and cut. The cups are a little large, so I have extra room There and it gaps a little whe dry but resolves when wet. Runs a little large, so consider ordering down a size. Color is true, hasn't faded. For the price, it's a good suit. I do wish the top and bottom were sold separately so you could customize the size."
3.0,Material is not strong. Easily breaks.
3.0,Not that good poor quality
3.0,Looks great but I had to get a larger size than I expected
3.0,Everything fits and looks great BUT boots really hurt the back of my feet
3.0,This is a pretty piece of jewelry and the chain is not bad quality but the picture is smaller than I imagined and a little blurry so when you're wearing it it just looks like the colors (which are nice) but you can't see the actual image in it unless you look really close. But it's decent metal.
3.0,I thought the color was more muted but in actuality it’s bright peach. Straps are long and it’s not as cropped as I like. Fabric is decent quality though
3.0,Looks pretty enough but I will not keep it. It is a bit too expensive for the quality. The chain used doesn't have enough weight to it and I'm worried the coating will start peeling off. Be aware that the color of the chain is much darker than pictured.
3.0,"Good Quality pant, soft and keeps warm and but Rise is too long makes it difficult to sit criss cross or run."
3.0,"Pretty patterns, but cheaply made. Cheap fabric, very thin, not good for COVID.<br />There is no nose bridge support inside and the elastic is very loose.<br />I would only wear this mask to cover a surgical type mask just to make it look pretty.<br />they hang way below your chin tho, no structurally supportive to the face."
3.0,These gloves are somewhat warm but not for below 40 in NY. The touchscreen tips are a bit frustrating because you have to touch the screen at a weird angle to work.
3.0,"I bought 1 single and 1 double size pad. The single one is not inflating enough where as in double I can see only 1 side inflating and other side is not.  So the single and one side of double pad is pretty much the same thinkness. I can clearly feel the difference between one side and the other side. Not sure if there is any problem with the pad.<br /><br />For now giving only 3 starts, Will update it based on customer support response."
3.0,I'ts pretty but won't stay on my head.  Received right on schedule.
3.0,"The strap looks nice, and I have been using it for a few months. However I am at a point where I am fed up with the fact that this strap gets loose multiple times per day that I have to fix it. I feel that I got so used to adjusting the strap that I stopped noticing myself adjusting it, and my girlfriend had to call me out on it. I will be switching back to my leather strap at this point.<br /><br />Pros: looks nice, easy to put on every day. Easy to put onto the watch<br />Cons: Weak magnet, so you have to adjust it multiple times per day"
3.0,I love the size and the versatility of the compartments but the straps are vinyl and the one thing I really need when carrying a load of paperwork or my large laptop is dependable straps.  These have cracked and separated and are not trustworthy to carry any weight any longer sadly I barely had these a year when they just started falling apart.
3.0,Beautiful bag but the chain strap is very cheap looking had to replace it with a better one
3.0,Smaller than it looked.  Still usable.
3.0,Superrrrr small
3.0,This fit me weird. It was extra baggy in the waist.  Returned
3.0,"I bought 3 of these one in pink, brown , and blue.  They are fine for the price.  It is an envelope so if you put too much in it or it will not close.  I have gotten complements on the bag when I use them The colors do complete my outfits.  They are what you would expect for the price.  I have had them only for about a month and so far so good!"
3.0,Anklet was not Stretch it has a clasp.
3.0,Bought for a cute dress. Fit as expected. Soft material. Loved style of dress. However after one wash it shrunk in length and was unable to wear after.
3.0,"This tank is comfortable and I can go bra-less at a size D.  The front however does not have a ton of fabric to cover your breast so best not do a ton of activity unless you are a smaller cup size.<br />For reference<br />I""m 5'8"" 150lbs size 34 D."
3.0,"Too big , make sure to size down"
3.0,These worked great on my trip. The zippers are weak and I don't think they will last for many trips.
3.0,Cheaper if I had gone to Walmart myself- but who really wants to go through the trauma of THAT!
3.0,"After a couple weeks, i began to see a metallic residue left on my fingers beside the ring. It may be from overuse as i loved the look, but it began staining my fingers. The fit was also too big even tho i got my size so i stuffed the hollow portion behind the head"
3.0,"I got these socks to be worn with some very, very low tennis shoes. They absolutely work size-wise. They fit perfectly and don't show at all. The designs are cute--actually much cuter than I expected. I'm not usually one for animal prints, so I was relieved to see that not all of them were animal print and those that were actually weren't as tacky as those designs often look. Unfortunately, there are a couple of other issues with them that prevented me from being able to give them 5 stars. They seemed reasonably well-made, but one sock ripped towards the toe upon first wear. It may have gotten snagged a little on the inside of my shoe or something, but it really ripped quite a bit. I haven't had the same issue with any other pairs yet, but feel the need to be honest about the fact that it happened with one pair. They also tend to slide off my feet. I wear a size 7 1/2-8 in shoes normally and they feel like they are fitting as intended, but I have had major issues keeping them on my feet when walking around all day. Aside from that, though, they are very comfortable. They are a thin, soft material. I've had no issues with them shrinking when washed, and the colors have also stayed vibrant. I'm not sure if it's just my feet, but these things fall down into my shoes all day long! I really wanted to love them, but they just don't do the job easily. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"Shirt is made from nice material but the shirt looks frumpy on. The front of the shirt clings to me, especially the top of my pants creating a weird pooch."
3.0,"Not very snug. If I try to pull them up over my knees, they droop and bag downward which is not comfy. Cute if you want them as boot socks or if you want to fold them below the knee."
3.0,"Not great, but decent for the money."
3.0,"I am 5 11 and 200 lbs, I wear large in US size, I ordered XL just incase and it is too small. I ended up giving it to my 130 lbs son and it fit him just right. Normally he wears small in US size. The material and design is very nice but the size needs to be fixed."
3.0,I think these are ok they kind of stick out of your ear and make it look sort of like a regular eating which is not what I want and you can't really see through then like in the picture but they are the right size and fit fine
3.0,"I bought this in red. It was the perfect dress. Fit well hang well, perfect length. Order it in green, so sorry. It was see thru, horrible weight, 2 inches shorter. So order the red one. Not any other color"
3.0,much longer than I thought
3.0,took a while for the smell to go away... left out in garage and in sun to get rid of smell.  will use as carry on for trip next month.  Hope it will hold as much as my backpack
3.0,I like my shades..
3.0,"My wife wanted some earrings for her video podcasts. These are cheap and they definitely hold up cheaply. The white ""stone"" fell off after a few weeks and I glued it with super glue. Very very cheap"
3.0,"This dress is gorgeous! But when I got it, I unzipped it, then went to zip it back up and the zipper completely broke off the track. Seeing as I had a problem with a zipper with a dress that I had just gotten in the same package, I thought I'd check this one to make sure. This dress is way too expensive for the zipper to come completely off the track like this. I will buy another one and expect it to come to me unbroken. If it doesn't I will have to leave this store a negative review. These dresses also come very poorly packaged. You pay close to $35 for this dress and it comes in a small bag, no bigger then an 81/2 by 11 vanilla envelope, all folded up and crinkled. It's no wonder the zipper comes apart in shambles."
3.0,Cute but not for women with hips and bodacious bootys.
3.0,So cute but WAY too big. I used the size chart by the company and listened to other reviews that said to size up. I should have stuck with my normal size. I'm 5'8&#34; 145lbs and a 34A. The top was very loose and if I went in the water it totally would have exposed the girls. No supper what so ever. The bottoms were also too big...and I have a round tush and usually get a med/large in swim bottoms.  Sad to say but I'm returning this. Im going to order smaller size since I love the style so much.
3.0,"These goggles work well enough, but the shape of the lenses makes it difficult to see well. I use them for cleaning the pool, which requires a high level of visual clarity. For other purposes, they might function well enough, but the shape of the lens distorts the light to the point that it makes it difficult to focus on fine particles on the bottom of the pool."
3.0,The only thing I don’t like about this product is that it says it comes with the headband and it doesn’t. I contacted Amazon and the replaced my order and the second one just came today and still no headband but besides that it’s good.
3.0,"Gorgeous shoe but way too small!  My heel was hanging off at least 1 full finger's width off the back.  In general all &#34;Elite&#34; shoes by &#34;Corkys&#34; run at least 1 size too small, but this particular pair ran 2 sizes too small.  I don't know if that was a fluke and they were accidentally missized, or if this particular style (&#34;Torch&#34;) runs smaller than the rest?  Either way, they were so gorgeous I immediately contacted my friend who wears a size 9 and asked her to come check them out and see if they would fit her (I had ordered a size 11) and viola, they fit her perfectly!  I think a person who wears a 9.5 could've also fit into this size 11 shoe.  Very odd sizing.  (Btw, I've ordered 8 pairs of Corkys Elite shoes and only 2 styles were true to size, 5 more were at least 1 size too small and these were 2 sizes too small).  I say order at least 1 size larger than your normal size and you should be very happy with these GORGEOUS &#34;hand painted&#34; leather shoes!!!  The craftsmanship and detail on these shoes is phenomenal.  If they fit me, I would've never parted with them."
3.0,"Fits well. Looks super cute. The buttonsand button holes are a little funky. Daughter said the outfit was super itchy, and took it off immediately."
3.0,Runs just a little short....
3.0,"This fit everywhere except for the sleeves. They were incredibly long and awkward. They would have had to be bunched up in order to fit, so I returned it."
3.0,"I have had these on occasion come apart, which is embarrassing and inconvenient. They work for the most part, but I feel like unless you have it too tight it wont stay."
3.0,"I like the tropical print and the fit (though the pockets do accentuate my hips) but the material is thin and cheap-looking— it fairly screams, “I was purchased on Amazon.”  It’s a decent casual dress but not as awesome as I had hoped."
3.0,"Reasonably decent, but not great. Washed before wearing, noticed sewing around button holes came loose. Not too thin of a fabric, but there are nicer shirts out there for the price. Fits roughly as expected."
3.0,"Lace is okay, but skirt fabric is low quality. Especially if you're wearing for formal even like wedding or party."
3.0,"Very well made and really cute, but expensive! If they were cheaper I would definetly.buy again"
3.0,Beautiful leather and beautiful to look at. Very stiff though. Am going to try cowboy boot oil to soften them up.
3.0,"Fits everywhere else, but Very large (and exposing) in the crotch area. My daughter has to wear this with shorts on top. Other than tha Bathing suit is very cute and nice quality."
3.0,"Apparently, I am one of the few people who pays the listed price for items on Amazon (how do all these reviewers get FREE items?!?). Anyway, this bag gets 3 stars from me which is an AVERAGE of how I feel: 5 stars for the actual bag (it's well made, a great size, exactly what I was looking for) and 1 star for the fact I paid extra for overnight delivery and the wrong color was delivered (I received black, instead of blue, which was not Amazon's fault: the sticker on the manufacturer's plastic wrapping said it was 'blue', but inside was a black bag). The black is nice, just not my first choice (and I did not have time to return or exchange before a special event I needed it for)."
3.0,"Loved them till the straps started breaking, which was a couple weeks ago.  Lasted maybe 2 months."
3.0,I love the glasses but there is white paint on them 😰😰😰
3.0,"The black material easily irritates the neck, but great length."
3.0,Love the style of these but the plastic is cheap and cracked around the lenses. The bow is the same plastic and snapped in half. Didn't even last a month. Will not buy again.
3.0,I am 5’8” and 150# and 34B<br />Normally wear a size 8 or 10 dress .. I ordered the 10 and couldn’t get it zipped around rib cage. I ordered the 12 and it fell off my shoulders - way too big in the bust. Disappointed on fit - it is a beautiful well made garment - just sizing is different
3.0,"Not as supportive in the bra area as I would like, but it's ok."
3.0,"I like it, but the gluing to the headband did not hold, so 1/2 way through the tea I was attending, the fascinator had slid down the headband and was covering my ear.  Not a pretty sight."
3.0,does<br />not fit snug enough to be covid safe - seems to be for a larger face.
3.0,It’s a little small but is warm
3.0,I bought this for a specific event and the overall style was perfect but I felt the fabric had too much of a &#34;club&#34; feel to it so I returned it.
3.0,"These did not fit even remotely so I can't comment on how well they work. I ordered a size small and I normally wear a women's size 5. There was a huge amount of extra material in the toes, to the point they would be usable for treking/hiking/climbing. The rest of the sock fit more or less normally. I'm not sure whose feet these fit but definitely not mine. Sadly going back."
3.0,Didn’t last as long as had hoped but Im hard on shoes. The toes began poking out on the side. A little hard to break in.
3.0,"Looked great when I first put it on but then after a few minutes of wear, I noticed it kept sliding down and exposing my bra. Straps are stretchy and not adjustable so I can't make it work unfortunately. Might be ok for someone taller than 5'3""."
3.0,The earrings were very big and heavy. They stretched out the holes for my earrings but were very cute. Can only wear for a short amount of time.
3.0,Ordered a size larger than what it said I needed and it was still too small. I gave it away.
3.0,The clasp came loose
3.0,Not as focused or as sharp of an image as I was hoping for at mid-range and distance.  Near distance is fine
3.0,"looks goods, but too small. go up two sizes. bowtie kinda cheap"
3.0,Romper is cute but it doesn’t have any structure.  By that i mean it’s just stretchy.  That may work for some but for me it did not.  It’s comfortable and sexy but if you have any pudge by your vag it will show.  Just a heads up for those of us with a fluffy kitty.
3.0,"I LOVE the look and am still wearing them, but the clasps are poorly  made and they fall out of my ears"
3.0,The strap was too long and the other slit was unnecessary.
3.0,"It looks beautiful but it isn't green, it looks more gray."
3.0,I loved how it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves. They were awkwardly too short and small
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Very cute and lovely colors, but quality is not very good. The material is very thin and edges are not serged or finished off at all. After a few wears the edges begin to roll. It works if you're looking for a cheap and easy present but not if you want to give a quality gift."
3.0,"I’m only 5’6”, and this was WAY too short to be a maxi dress. Super disappointed because it’s so cute!"
3.0,I like these pajamas but they run small!
3.0,"Bought for wife. Very nice but zipper gets stuck horribly, not at all because it was too tight. It was almost impossible to zip it up. The threading is terrible quality."
3.0,"Size chart is inaccurate, they runs really small<br />Quality looks being ok but I should buy at least a size bigger, maybe two"
3.0,Product arrived in time. Love the length and the size was just right. However had plenty of small holes\gaps at the waist seem when opening it. Luckily I'm handy with needle and thread.
3.0,"These pants are gorgeous and so flowy, but they’re way too sheer!  I’m going to try a pair of nude shorts underneath.  I probably could’ve sized down."
3.0,"I've received the gloves fit good just waiting on cold weather, let it go , fix new problem no contact lens n case do u want it back no good for me"
3.0,"Beautiful ring, but very bendable material."
3.0,It fits big but it was still cute on him. But one other thing is I washed them and when I went to put them on him I seen that the one glitter was coming off and this was first time washing it.
3.0,"Only received 11 pairs(22 pieces), the ones i did receive are pretty good quality."
3.0,I was really disappointed to discover it does not automatically retract.  It didn't last too long before a couple of the spoke broke.  I would say it lasted maybe a year.
3.0,Nice jumpsuit. Bought it size bigger. Was too tight. Gave it to a friend it fit perfectly. She loves it.
3.0,It feels nice and I like the mission. but its needs to be longer. It keep trying to come up. That’s not a nice on a bike ride.
3.0,I like the shirt . it does run a little small so glad i ordered a medium ( i normally wear a small )  The material l is thin so you deff will have to wear a cami under it
3.0,"They are not the same as the show they are too big and shiny, and you don't get the product as shown its just 5 pips. At least they are the rank pips."
3.0,"I bought two sets of clips in one order.  One set was perfect and are quality, the other literally snapped in half with the first application.  Not happy I had to place them right back in the box and send them back."
3.0,It looks cute and fits nicely but the hard plastic material made my face dripping sweat after only 20 minutes
3.0,The color is such a pretty and dark teal in the pics but when the dress came it’s like a bright teal. I don’t love it at all. Bugs!
3.0,"This is pretty and very comfortable, but the color is way off when compared to the picture.  The bracelet I received is a dark teal with a lot of green and just a little blue.  There is a note in the box about color variations, but I was disappointed because I was trying to build a bracelet set like this one...."
3.0,It has a nice design but it's a very basic fabric with no room to stretch. It's not the greatest quality but for the price it's descent. I like the way it looks on me so I can't really complain. I'm a 36 bust and I got a Medium.
3.0,not really true to size-runs small
3.0,"I ordered this Sweatshirt, after reading some of the reviews.  Loved the look of the tie die.  When it arrived, I realized quickly it was not what I was expecting.  It was not the feel of a Sweatshirt.  It was 90% polyester.  Almost a shiny look on the outside.  The colors were a little more dull than what was pictured.  It was not a bad shirt, but I wanted a more soft, comfortable, sweatshirt and it wasn’t for me.  It was a good size.  I ordered Medium.  I usually like Large, but noticed some people said it ran big.  It fit me perfectly, Medium."
3.0,Beautiful but chain snapped at charm almost immediately.
3.0,"I had to return this item. It was nice, but the fit was so strange. The halter part was so uncomfortable due to the tension on the straps. It was too much for me to keep it."
3.0,Color not  as advertised
3.0,"I'm 5' 8"" with a 39-40"" bust. I weigh about 145. It fits perfectly across the bust, but the rest is huge. I like it long, but I could weigh A LOT more and it would still be very flowy on me. It needs to be more tailored. The lacy material is very pretty, but it needs taking in."
3.0,Not sliver changed color
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:31b5de51264ec60c3e5514c5ccbedcf]] Thought this ring looked really cool. The idea of having an image on the ring is super cool. Upon opening it a a gift my husbands face went from excited to immediate disappointment. First off the image is blurry and not like the pictures at all, more of an abstract image then forest. The size was not true as well, he has a knot theory silicone ring size 8 and a metal ring size 8. This one was an 8 as well but very tight on his finger. He wore it for one night and it hurt his finger and left a dent. We will be returning this for another Knot theory ring. Even though the etching wore off after 10 months of wearing it still fit great and my husband loves it.<br /><br />Update: customer service at Groove life reached out to resolve any issues we had, which was great! We are still returning the ring but I have added an extra star for appreciating them contacting me to help."
3.0,"the back is too high and straps are really wide, looks like an old lady suit, front is cute"
3.0,Very thin and scratchy material  and not lined.
3.0,Too small. I felt like i was choking. I gave the bracelet to my daughter
3.0,"I liked it, got it as a gift"
3.0,"These are nice hipsters and comfortable for the most part but I find that I'm always tugging on the back, trying to pull them up a little higher. They feel like they don't quite cover enough of my booty which isn't that big at all. I'm a little disappointed and wouldn't recommend them."
3.0,The crinoline near was a little flimsy. A little too long for me.
3.0,Kids loved it but broke off easily
3.0,"Not bad for the price, but they did end up bending quickly and scratched."
3.0,Leaves and pearl do not sit as shown. They instead are at about the same length and sit on top of each other. Still pretty though.
3.0,"Not as comfortable as other bands that I've ordered off of Amazon. Stitching is a light orange, almost peach color after just a couple weeks of wear. I've had the Hadley Roma bands similar to this one and they're more comfortable, but this one does seem to be a little tougher."
3.0,"really difficult to put in, returned"
3.0,"The band itself looked really nice and was easy to use. I work out almost everyday which requires me to tighten the band to get a more accurate heart rate. I think that’s what caused it to start cracking (which means I’ll have to stop using it as I can’t risk my watch flying off my wrist!). It lasted about 3 months and could probably last longer if you don’t wear it tightly. Overall, not bad but not super durable!"
3.0,"The bracelet is pretty, and I like that it blends in with my work attire and jewelry. However it's really big on my wrist. I have fairly small/ slim wrists, and it ends up half way up my forearm. Annoying."
3.0,"I have gone through a few of these. The size over the eyes and darkness is great, but because the frame is stiff plastic, if you have a larger head, these seem to break easily by cracking on the head."
3.0,strap that goes around is a bit thin and rolls
3.0,"They run pretty long, prepare to break out the sewing kit.  They should have nire specifies sizes.  I'm 5'8 34&#34; waist and i ordered a large.  The waist is perfect but the Pant legs are about a foot too big.  Yes,a foot! Otherwise amazing comfortable pants. Good material and color."
3.0,Stones a little bigger than expected
3.0,"The pants fit as expected. However, I purchased these pants thinking that they would be a little more sturdier. The fabric was very lightweight and did not conceal as much as I would have liked it too."
3.0,"Love the blouse, except for the tightness in sleeve at the shoulder."
3.0,Looked pretty but did not bend enough. I have tiny wrists and hopes I could adjust this enough but it barely moved and definitely did not fit me. Disappointed
3.0,The stone is very pretty but they were shorter than expected and wasn’t much room to put the O ring on.
3.0,Beautiful jacket....but so annoyed that the sleeves have snags at the wrist seem on them upon pulling out of the package. :( disappointing.
3.0,They are ok for the price.  There made pretty sturdy and just a little tighter than very expensive ones.  The return policy I didn't like very much.  I took me a while to make sure and I was under the weather during that time.  So they were firm about their 30 day return policy.  That's the only thing that bothered me.  I bought 2 pair and now I am stuck with one.
3.0,Fits around the neck to tite
3.0,"The look of the suit is great, but the bottom was too big and the top was too small"
3.0,"Nice glasses for a person with a small nose. They sit to high on my face, You can see light under the bottom of the lens, and when you look in the mirror; they look goofy. The glasses themselves function well, so if you have a smaller nose...these are the glasses for you."
3.0,"It was only worn for a couple of hours. Had to fix the hem on the bottom after that. You get what you pay for. If you don’t mind a little sewing fix, not bad. The rest of it held up really well and fit as expected."
3.0,It’s a bit ticker than your usual coverups
3.0,"Its a bit short, I got the large and it was really short. really cute dress thou"
3.0,"Size Small is Too big and boxy for a petite woman.  Too bad, I would've loved it.  I ordered this for a European trip to protect myself from pickpockets, but it looks terrible when it's too big and shaped like a box on me.  Had to return :-("
3.0,"It was a pretty dress; unfortunately too small in the chest area, I ordered a medium and still wasn’t big enough, had to return."
3.0,Should have ordered a small instead of a medium 155
3.0,Gorgeous dress but TOO LONG for short women
3.0,My impressions of these particular pants is that we def should have ordered a size down. I got these for my daughter whom is 14 normally a size 7 or 9 in pants is 5ft 5 and about 120-123lbs. I followed the guide given on the page and ordered a size medium however as pictured you can see they are way too baggy everywhere and not in an oversized look kinda way just a I brought these too big for me not flattering way. The material is nice they seem soft and comfortable. The waist band has a stretch to it along with a way to cinch the waist. We really just needed the next size down and will see if maybe we can do an exchange here in the near future as to get a better take on the pants themselves. I will say overall they comes as a nice olive color and look like they're made of pretty nice materials.
3.0,Ordered for my daughter<br />I think she got three dresses one was to small. She like how they fitted on her she said that the  material wasn’t the best but you could tell. She said a good price for something that looked great on her. I would have to agree.<br />If you’re looking for a model then she’s your lady.
3.0,Was hoping for more arch support.
3.0,This are thinner material than expected but okay nonetheless.  One of the fingers had missing thread so it requires patching right out of the bag.
3.0,Very nice coat! But ran small!
3.0,"Daughter really liked this, but the stones fell out super quick."
3.0,"It is sized correctly, large for sure.  The color is a nice deep blue, however, disappointingly the pattern is one one-sided; I expect the pattern to be seen on both sides."
3.0,"I’m 5’5” and weigh around 160. I ordered an XL because I’m pregnant and getting bigger, but you could’ve fit two of me in the XL. The fabric was high quality and super soft, though."
3.0,"The fit is good, wears the same as other Dolfin Uglies...but the colors are lighter than expected"
3.0,"It's a lovely jacket, but the proportions are very odd.<br /><br />I had to check one of the preset boxes for the fit, and I chose &#34;Somewhat Small&#34; but it is misleading.  The general size is fine, but there really needs to be a &#34;fits odd&#34; option for mis-made clothing like this.<br /><br />Like many manufacturers of plus sized clothing, Ulla Popken seems to have completely forgotten about arms.<br /><br />Many manufacturers will take a regular sized garment and resize it larger, but take no notice of the size of the arms. We are left with garments that fit our bodies, but are ridiculously snug against the arms.<br /><br />A loose, gauzy jacket should have reasonably loose arms. This one does not. They are TIGHT.<br /><br />I am a fairly proportional woman. I do not have popeye arms. The sleeves in this jacket are very, very snug. If you look at the picture, snug arms do not really fit the look of this garment. I am perpetually baffled by this choice in garment designers. Is fabric so very expensive that saving a few millimeters on arm sizes makes a profit difference? Or do they just assume that larger women just swell up in the middle like balloons and maintain slender limbs?<br /><br />The arms are also significantly shorter than they appear in the picture, hitting barely below the elbow, with the snug lace making bending difficult. I am tall, though, so perhaps on a very short woman they would be the right length (as long as her arms are much slenderer than the rest of her body).<br /><br />Or maybe on a tyrannosaurus. The arms are perfect for a tyrannosaurus. If you are carnivorous, green, large, and have teeny little arms, I strongly suggest you grab this right away. It was made for you!"
3.0,I’m a medium would need xl
3.0,"The bottoms are a little big and the shirt is small. I am 5'5, 164 lbs, 34 C, 10 pants and I ordered a lrge. It is still cute and when the weather here in Ohio acts right, I will wear and take a pic. Material is thin and see through so be mindful of your undies. Mind you, that's not a bad thing 😂😂"
3.0,"Too big, and the band doesn't come apart well at all. Sizing was impossible."
3.0,"These are very soft but offer hardly any compression, which I need, especially in tummy and thigh area. If you do not need that compression, these would work."
3.0,"The material is nice, but the shape is too baggy/boxy for baby medium size baby girls."
3.0,They hold the sent but very difficult to open and close by yourself.  After a few uses the rope broke to close it.
3.0,"Beautiful design, nice material, but finish is not that nice, so what could be a great dress is not due to manufacturing."
3.0,"The sunglasses came in a nice case with bag and microfiber lens cloth. The frame appears to be full plastic (no metal screws holding ear rests to the front, but it feels fairly sturdy.<br /><br />The issue is that there is a smallish curved line (appx 1/2"" long, 1/8"" wide) on both lenses where it seems like one of the lens-coatings is slightly thicker, which distorts your view in that spot. For the left lens, it's far enough to the side that you don't notice unless you are really looking to the left. But for the right lens, it's visible if you are looking straight or down (e.g. while reading).<br /><br />It looks like one of the film coatings didn't adhere well or is just a tad thicker in that spot. It's not a total dealbreaker, but when reading it gets very noticeable."
3.0,Very cute top but very very small.  I ordered a large & it fits like a small.<br />Good price so I will give it to a friend rather than return it.
3.0,Loved the dress. Fits small. I would size up
3.0,"Don't get me wrong, these are beautiful earrings, I just was expecting something different.  I have already lost one, so kinda sad."
3.0,Did not hit right on the chest — would likely only work well if you are small busted.
3.0,"I typically wear a 2x/3x because of my wide belly. This did nothing to hide any bump or back fat roll. It's cute though, so I'm holding onto it. I need some sort of motivation to get active. If that means fitting into a shirt that is not big belly friendly, then so be it."
3.0,It's very small and lite I can't barely feel like I have a watch on and now I'm going to the mall to take a little off it
3.0,"It looks fake, the material is thin"
3.0,Don’t like this item not very well made and run small
3.0,"liked the color , but it run a little small,"
3.0,"I though these would work mechanically, ill keep them though."
3.0,"cute wristlet, but too small to fit my phone."
3.0,I don't like when I have it on it comes out loose. But I like the material.
3.0,The wallet is ok. It could have been more sturdy
3.0,These are super cute! I used them with my kindergarten students to take Father's Day pics.<br />I found them nearly impossible to get the backing off. It was extremely time-consuming and completely impossible for the kids to do it themselves. I buy mustaches every year for this purpose and this is the first time I've ever gotten ones that were difficult. Picture a classroom full of 5-6-year-olds having to WAIT! I won't be buying these again.
3.0,"I am a size 6, which to me is a good/average size and this belt is a little tight. As long as I don't eat alot, I am OK, as far as being comfortable."
3.0,"I ordered these the beginning of April, and they were supposed to come around April 27- May. but I got them like two weeks earlier. so, because they are cheap I didn't expect too much, but I was extremely excited about wearing the one with the design in the middle(not the tiny one, not the biggest one) but when it arrived part of it was broken :-( and for the biggest one part was bend, but it is pretty bendable so I don't blame it. I'm gonna keep them, probably wear them.<br />Just remember it's cheap, so please don't get your hopes up!"
3.0,They are very nice and comfortable but when I hold the bike and bend my wrist it creates all this extra fabric and that was starting to irritate my palm
3.0,"I purchased this for family photos and got in the mail the day of photos (yes, this was MY mistake, I'm aware). I am a size 8, 5'5"", DD chest with a moderate 'mom pooch' I can generally hide--I ordered a medium. The top would not stay clasped and I was constantly tucking my chest. This was a poor design issue and not a 'my chest is too big for this romper' issue. The fit was pretty good-flowy-with enough room for movement. The fabric was just okay. Here's the deal-breaker--the tie hits in just the right area to make even those with the smallest mom pooch look like they have a full-blown FUPA.  I ordered a romper (same brand) that was cotton and it is 1000 times kinder to my mom body (and my self-esteem).<br /><br />If you are 22 with a small chest order this! If not, order this cotton one instead: ANRABESS Women's Summer Short Sleeve Striped Jumpsuit Rompers with Pockets Short Pant Rompers Playsuit."
3.0,Fit was good but the fabric was heavy and doesn't  breathe.
3.0,"First time snowboarding formy daughter, so I wanted to get her lightweight socks that would keep her feet warm but not hot and that are long enough to cover her legs from the snowboard boots. They did the job there.<br />My complaint nor concern is after only one wash and wear the socks are fraying. After the second wear and wash, the socks look like they've been worn for months. I'm hoping they will last another ski season or two, otherwise they wouldn't be worth the price point in my opinion."
3.0,Not able to look at phone while wearing them. Gives off rainbow glow. Cute non the less.
3.0,Not a bad shirt but fits very big l
3.0,"I love these dresses and used to wear size L. I lost weight and got some Mediums, which fit perfectly. A year or so later, I ordered the same dresses in M. They are now too tight because the armholes are smaller and I have lost weight, so it's definitely about using less material. A Large will be big everywhere, except the armholes which will fit. Not thrilled."
3.0,"The &#34;clasp&#34;, if you want to call it that, doesn't stay very well. I added rubber backs, and then click it shut, so it doesn't fly out of my ear."
3.0,The gold color it’s off and the logo is flat. The pearl is light white plastic looking. Metal is light not good for sensitive ears. Pretty just for pictures.
3.0,The label could be sewed on a lite nicer.
3.0,I like the style but the cut on the side is strange.  It made my hips look huge and I am a 4-6 pants.  Wish they would have sewed it differently.  I am returning it.
3.0,"For the price, you get 20 shiny nose studs. Be aware, the post does turn black after approximately 1 week. The stone still looks good, but the post is completely black and smells bad."
3.0,"I like the socks, but I paid for 5 pairs and received only 4 pairs. Thus the 3 stars."
3.0,"Overall a comfortable dress, love the style of it.  The waist sits a bit higher than I'd like and the elastic is a bit uncomfortable around the waist so I need to wear something under it to prevent rubbing.  Not enough to return it - have worn it several times and overall am happy with this purchase."
3.0,"Love the fact that this includes a kit for adding or removing links; however, I've only had it a week or so, and I've already scratched the paint off in several places.  It's inexpensive, so I guess I got what I paid for.  :)"
3.0,It was a lo quality shirt. I expected more for paying this much.
3.0,"Handsome look but sadly the switches and plug are really low quality.  The plug is finicky and if it is moved at the slightest angle, the power cuts out.  The switches are cheap and send intermittment start/stop actions, however it could be related to the crappy plug.  Like I said, its a nice looking case but Im disappointed in the electronic components, especially for the price, I expected better quality.  I would not rebuy."
3.0,The swimsuit color is not as shown in the photo the pink is more of a coral orange color instead of the blush pink as shown in the photo.
3.0,"This suit is soooo cute! but is not made for big boobs. Im a 36DDD more of a medium bottom, large top. I couldn't even zip the top. The butt is skimpy. Would be great for a smaller bust person who doesn't mind being cheeky :-)"
3.0,este juego lo compre . no hace mucho y ya se puso prieto el collar . y deceo devolverlo .  y darme un credito por el . porfavor . dice que es 925 y plata de ley. yo tengo jollas que dicen 925 y todavia las tengo . porfavor yo np quiero el dinero . si me pueden dar un credito se los agraseseria mucho
3.0,Got it within the time frame. I ordered a kids size. The smallest one they had but it fits wierd on his face so it slides off. I have two others and they fit his face fine. I have adult size so the band can't be adjusted. The material is softer than the one I ordered so that's a good thing.
3.0,Looks good in picture but not as great when received! Given as a gift to someone but returned it!!!
3.0,Not my fave and too hard to get into flats
3.0,"It should fit after I lose more weight, but it was disappointing that I couldn't wear it right away."
3.0,"It's a cool looking watch, but it's frustrating that it stops working when you take it off. I usually wear it for 12+ hours a day, so this shouldn't happen."
3.0,Way to heavy of a bag for me.  I loved it but it was much bigger than I had anticipated.
3.0,The material is good but it's see through.
3.0,these are super tiny .. i am glad they were for my little niece.
3.0,"It's ok, just a little too small for my glasses."
3.0,We hoped these were the old school style sweats but fabric is different and very thin.
3.0,The shirt is great but runs a little small.
3.0,"This clutch is beautiful. Love the details. When I received my product, some of the beads were already loose. I went out to my event, then return home. When I was putting my bag away, I realized one of the beads was missing. Was very disappointed. Not sure if I can use my bag again. Waist of money"
3.0,"I have 4 pairs of these joggers and love them, so comfortable, true to size I am 5’6” weigh 140 and buy a size small, but this pair came in 4 inches shorter than all the rest of mine, obviously<br />this one got by a quality checker !"
3.0,Didn't fit me.  Had to return it.  Very understanding & professional seller.  Will buy again.
3.0,These are very well made but they run small. Small enough that they simply don’t fit...
3.0,"This sweater in the pink shade is much darker than shown in picture. Its not a bright pink, but a darker shade of dusty rose. I feel that the length should be a bit longer. I'm only 5'5&#34; and it hits higher on my thigh than the model. This is a gift for my niece, I hope she's still ok with it."
3.0,"Fits great on my Huawei Watch 2 Classic. Much better than the regular milanese straps which tend to slide around on my arm. This survived everything from the office to the gym and doesn't retain smells like a silicone band would. Minor complaint would be that the latch may shift a little during strenuous exercise, making the band fit looser on my arm. It's not a big deal and easy to fix by adjusting the clasp.<br /><br />EDIT 11/26/18:<br />After some time, the clasp lock moves much more easily and does not stay in place as well as it used to. The mesh started ""fraying"" at the edges and would constantly catch on fabric and cut arms. For a cheap band this isn't too bad and I immediately purchased another one but may switch to metal links in the future."
3.0,"So cute and flattering... but as with most dresses I love, the buttons gape open and have to constantly check to see if the girls are still in the dress."
3.0,"Fits great at the toes, however, the elastic is tight. Does not fit over the calf. It is shorter."
3.0,"The product itself has a rough, durable feel to it, as well as a simple design. The presentation leaves much to be desired, such as the bag arriving flattened and without a dust bag."
3.0,"It was a really cute design, but didn't fit well. I'm a busty 16-18 and the XL was to small. There was no give to the material and it was thin."
3.0,Way too large when seen in personl
3.0,The watch looks good and well made.  I did ask about warranty and got no answer.  Just have to get used to reading it a little different.
3.0,Good shorts! Maybe buy a size bigger or eat less. lol.
3.0,I got a gray one for my daughter. The fur has a little bit pink in it.
3.0,"I'm kind of at a loss as for how to rate this watch.<br /><br />On the plus side, it looks great! The leather band is attractive, the stainless body of the watch, the dial, size, weight, all excellent.<br /><br />But on the negative side; it was extremely difficult to get the crown in position to set the date. So difficult, I at first though it was not a quick set but after repeated tries, I was able to engage the crown and set the date. The real problem was the watch would not start up. I shook it per normal with an auto winding mechanical watch (I have several and know how to &#34;wind&#34; them) but to no avail. I was able to get my watch working by removing the screw down back (also, very nice) and gently coaxing the escapement mechanism to life and the watch began to run.<br /><br />Pulling the watch apart wasn't an issue for me as I usually take the back off and regulate mechanical watches when I first get them and then again 6 months or so down the road after they have had time to break in but this would likely be a show stopper for most people that don't have the tools and know how to work on a watch.<br /><br />Speaking of regulating; I did not see any markings to identify the movement so no idea what it is or who makes it but it is running around 21600 BPS, which seems to be the average for mechanical watches without Swiss movements (just a guess that the movement is not Swiss as any Swiss watch movement I have every seen is proudly marked with a model number, not to mention the ridiculously low price for the watch, which is vastly less expensive than the most bargain basement Swiss movement that I have ever seen). It clocks in around 39 seconds/day fast, which is pretty out there even for brand new watches in the non Swiss category. Just out of curiosity, I am not going to regulate this one but will monitor it over the next couple of months to see how it settles in.<br /><br />So, a tentative three stars. My watch may have been a fluke and the 1 out of 1000 that wouldn't start up on its own but this was my experience.<br /><br />Now, would I buy this watch again? Heck yeah! This is a crazy low price for what you get, as long as the one you get works out of the box. I'm already deciding on which other KS watch I'm going to get next.<br /><br />Update 9-16-2015:<br />Went ahead and regulated the watch. Surprisingly, I was able to get it in the 1.5 s/day range. Will have to keep an eye on it and see if it stays there but after a few days, the movment has been holding regulation.<br /><br />I determined that the original problem with my watch was that the autowinding mechanism wasn't working. It didn't seem to be able to move to wind the mainspring (on a side note, the auto wind is bi-directional which is a pleaseant surprise). I took the autowinding mechanism apart, cleaned, lubed and reassembled but still no go. I added some weights to the mechanism and it is actually working fine now. I don't believe this is a desing flaw, ie. I don't think the counter weight is to lite rather, I think it is a symptom of what is really wrong with the mechanism in my watch. Probably a dry or poorl seated bearing or something along those lines. The watch comes with a generous 2 year warranty from Amazon but with the low price and my general enjoyment of working on watches, I just got it going on my own. Interesting to see if it proves to be a problem long term or not.<br /><br />I mentioned earlier in my review that I would purchase another watch from this company and have already done so. The watch hasn't arrived yet but I fully expect it will work fine as my first watch was likely a fluke.<br /><br />I did order a different style as one thing I noticed about this particular model, the silver hands on silver dial doesn't provide a very good contrast, especially in low lighting conditions."
3.0,Kinda cheap hut worked for what i needed it for
3.0,"Definitely not the burgundy-red as pictured.  I've looked at this on two different computers and my smartphone, and all screens showed the burgundy-color, NOT the bright tomato red that this dress is (maybe you're looking for that color though); I'm curious to see what kind of blue the blue is, but not curious enough to give it a try (I assume the black would actually be black).  The material is nice and soft, HOWEVER the dress arrived so wrinkled, it was hard to imagine what it would look like without wrinkles.  I hung it in my closet for about two weeks to see if the wrinkles would relax; they did somewhat, but still not enough to give me confidence that this dress would be easy to take care of and keep it nice looking.  Additionally, the dress has these prominent lines down the front (you can't see them very well on the product's page); I think they're suppose to make you look skinnier (like the color-blocking trend), but I think they just look awkward (it looks like there are pockets, but alas, there aren't).  I think this dress looks too casual for work or cocktails or a wedding; I really don't know what I'd wear it to."
3.0,"quality is lacking..but they are cute I don't wear them much, so can't speak on how they hold up.."
3.0,It just didn’t hang right “on me”
3.0,I ordered this top in a teal color.  The top that arrived is dark turquoise.
3.0,"Great design but soon as I got it it has a warning on it. products, in this known to the state of California to cause cancer. In a pair of sunglasses.."
3.0,My husband had two of these hats that I had purchased from Costco for him. Thus far they are his favorite!! We were both disappointed that the size is small and the rim of the hat is not as wide as his others. These are replacements for his other two. He has decided to keep them because he tossed his other hats when I told him I had bought new ones. They sit high on his head.  lol
3.0,"It's ok, but not really loud enough."
3.0,The dress is too small and short even after order a bigger size. Dress fits like a shirt. The jacket does not look 100% the way it does in the picture but it fits. I ended up buying shorts to complete the outfit
3.0,"I got the red one with white polka dots. I am 5’4”, 145 lb. It was a tad more snug than I’d like in my usual size (8-10) so I would order one size larger if you want truly comfy. Also it’s more of a “plasticy” material than what the picture conveys... the photo makes it look like a soft cottony dress but it’s really not. Just... meh."
3.0,"Smaller the size, or wrong size lable"
3.0,"This dress material is not as expected, the denim is much lighter and there appears to be a slight defect on the cut of the arms. One side is a bit wider than the other so it does not fit properly. I will have to have my seamstress make adjustments to the armholes to wear it."
3.0,"They seem to be nice enough earrings. I was expecting a little bit more shine on the Black Onyx, but what do you want at this price point? Mine had a crack at the bottom that made the ear wire hook bob up and down.  It didn't look nice and I was afraid that I might lose the earring;it wouldn't be worth my time to reorder a replacement, just money down the drain.  Ordered the other black onyx earrings without swarovski crystals.  Let's see what they look like."
3.0,Cute but crown is flimsy material that was creased when arrived.  Little way to fit it to child’s head.
3.0,This coat fell apart after 3 days. The entire left side seam just ripped apart. I was going to re sew the seam up when I realized that the zipper was already fraying. I ended up tossing it in the trash. I will never buy from this supplier again!
3.0,Not crazy about the material but it is cute. It ran a little big also.
3.0,"The wallet is one of the few that will accommodate 10 cards. Service was speedy. The leather is a bit thin and the seams on the edges are a bit rough, sewn and glued.  The glue had encroached on the slots and I had to break out the right hand side to be able to force credit cards into them, but I was able to do this. The slots are deeper than desirable, and cards can be difficult to extract.  The money slots are overly deep for US currency with the dimensions of the wallet. The finish of edges isn't as good as more durable wallets, but for the ability to display 10 cards in a wallet that fills a pocket without being overly thick makes this a good value."
3.0,Sizing is crazy wrong!!!
3.0,Wore it once and it started falling apart. Loose threads everywhere. I loved the design and material it just wasn’t put together very well
3.0,"I love shirt so much it's so soft and comfortable and stylish, it's such a summary shirt but only it's for winter. Only I wish it came in a bigger size like I ordered, but besides that it was amazing. It came in so early then what Amazon expected it to be and I was so happy only I ordered a shirt from the same company that was so small that it was smartest one in so itchy arms red and irritated. So if you see the blue shirt with sequins I recommend not getting it, because if you do you'll regret"
3.0,Very nice quality but one pair doesn't match
3.0,This fits really small but the sleeves start off the shoulder kind of like an oversized shirt... it broadened my shoulders even more than normal. Not attractive on.
3.0,Looks really nice but a tab small...........
3.0,I love the color but the reviews were right about the bikini top . I had a to order a second one in a larger size for the bikini top to fit me. This another swimsuit were the customer should have options for the sizes this is not a one fits all swimsuit
3.0,"I absolutely love this dress but I can't wear it, it is just too snug. I ordered my typical size. But the fabric is substantial and silky, and the pattern is just gorgeous."
3.0,Very thing material ....love the look but does not hold up after six wear and washings
3.0,It's cool but smaller than it was sized.
3.0,☹️☹️
3.0,"Its a nice sweatshirt from what I can tell.  However, I only has it on for brief moment.  It was snug, very snug.  You may want to size up! The colors were vibrant and the detail was spot on.  I am returning for an XXL.  Hopefully I can update with good news."
3.0,"Love these, but the screw on the side comes out very easily. But got lots of compliments."
3.0,Cheaper looking in person than in the picture
3.0,Wore these to a festival and they were surprisingly comfy. Still look nice after 3 rough days.
3.0,"Item is adorable but small in the chest area. I have D cup breasts and a xtra large is tight around chest. Plus it's a little short , just hits belt area"
3.0,The key chain is made well and feels like a quality product. Useful tool that is handy to use.
3.0,I love marilyn Monroe she is my favorite this scarf is really cute and I get so many complements but.. It started to rip and it's all yarny now
3.0,"These do work, however... They are obviously made in China. They stink like chemicals when first opened. The elastic is not soft to the skin. Scratchy. I am buying a second set from another supplier. Search Amazon for &#34;Made in the USA shirt stays&#34;. Basically the same price, but made here, and better quality. The most disturbing thing about this item is the amount of reviews that are from buyers that have been compensated to write a review. Funny how most of those reviews are 5 star and glowing reviews. Paying or compensation for a review lowers the credibility of the seller and reviewer significantly."
3.0,Got ruined the first time while washing.
3.0,"Really liked this pretty bracelet, but I’m afraid I had to return it. It would be fine for occasional wear, but I bought it for everyday wear. I’m clumsy, and I don’t think the magnetic closure is strong enough to keep it fastened for me."
3.0,Nice fabric<br />Needed darts to allow for people with breasts.
3.0,"With the fold over and the money clip, the wallet is a little thicker than I was hoping for. Also the clip makes it awkward for me slip my money in an organized fashion. Good quality leather. Still better than what I had."
3.0,"So far, so good. No problems as of yet. The last time I purchase one it kept turning over to the other side, just showing the the side without the Red hologram."
3.0,The proportions of this dress are waaaaaay off. I knew this before I bought them (one for each of my 2 daughters) due to the other reviews. I definitely did some sewing modifications to make them fit my daughters. I took in the bodice easily enough by folding and sewing bilateral straight lines and I cut the straps and took them up about 4&#34; each. In the end both dresses looked great. I ordered a size 2 for my 3yo who usually wears a size 4 or 5 and a size 6 for my 7yo who usually wears a 7/8. If you're looking for a no hassle dress this is NOT it. If you're willing to do some sewing and end up with a cute dress then I recommend.
3.0,I think this is for kids or small people..cool jacket but sizes are too small
3.0,"I love the fabric, but the shorts are too short and your booty will not be fully covered as you move in the night."
3.0,A bit larger than expected/order
3.0,Doesn't really fit. Don't love it.
3.0,The item material is not nice isn't what the picture advertise from anisha
3.0,Frame hurts nose
3.0,I liked the various stones and styles of this set and that’s the main reason I ordered it. They came nicely packaged in a blue bag and each ring was in its own plastic pouch. Only issues i have is that they seem pretty cheaply made and I’m nervous the gems will fall out since they are only held on by four thin prongs. They are your classic belly button rings and definitely do that job for a fair price!
3.0,"Fit is nice. Thick, stretchy material. Not see through at all. Stitching thread is too delicate on the ruching, so it has already snapped in a few spots just adjusting it during try-on. A little shorter than anticipated. 5'5 will need to wear flats for this to be floor length."
3.0,I followed Amazon’s instructions and ordered an XL. These pants were huge. I would return them but it’s not worth the $6.99 I paid.
3.0,"Right fit, completely the wrong sweater delivered."
3.0,"I got a size medium, expecting them to fit something like a 4-6, but they seem to fit a bit more like a size 2 tall. They are VERY long, and would need to be hemmed for basically anybody under 5'11"", unless you were wearing them with high heels or stilettos. And to be honest, I really have no desire to pay about as much as the pants cost in the first place just to get them to stop dragging on the floor!<br /><br />Sizing issues aside, these are very flattering pants. The have a nice, small waist, fitted hips, and are loose and flowing through the thighs down. I can't say how they would look on all body types, but I find them to be elegant and stylish. They remind me a bit of the gorgeous, movie-star looks of around the 1940's and 50's, but with a slightly more slim, draping, modern cut."
3.0,Light but doesn't hold up with air
3.0,WAY Tooo big as sized.  Floppy
3.0,It was bait and switch. The pictures that were shown were a black  mask with red ears.<br />I received a red one. Very dissapointed.
3.0,Very cheap and will break very quickly. But you do get a lot of different purses. You get what you pay for
3.0,These fit nicely but they fall on a strange place on my waist. They’re essentially high waisted.
3.0,"loved the product, but it broke in a couple of days, the seller was quick to fix issue."
3.0,It was cute. The fit was as expected. The gold around the top started peeling off so it started looking old very quickly. Barely lasted the whole summer. I wouldn’t purchase it again.
3.0,They are just plastic. There is no rubber around the nose to keep them from slipping. Cute though!
3.0,"I have gotten these before.  They are not high quality, but they are inexpensive and you get what you pay for.  About every fourth light did not work, but the ones that did, did the job that was intended.  I did not have high expectations for these and was actually impressed that 3 out of every four lights actually worked."
3.0,Lace is very scratchy.
3.0,Tunic fit perfect and the straps that come with it are a nice touch. Only problem was that I didn’t get a leather belt like it had so thats why it isn’t 5 stars but other than that I’m pretty happy with the result
3.0,I did not like the material. Feels like a tshirt.
3.0,"But the fabric was not a natural one for dresses, it seem more suitable for drapes!"
3.0,Luv it.! It arrived with the dangle part broken but still cute.
3.0,"Turned out that after Rotator cuff surgery, I did not need to have these.  A regular tee worked fine and was a lot cheaper.  If you do need them, your arm is truly immobile, they would work great."
3.0,Not happy with these. Too small......
3.0,Product ran bigger then expected
3.0,I should have looked more closely at the picture.  I wasn't expecting the shoulder/arm hem to be so low.  I doubt that I will wear it.
3.0,not premium looking.
3.0,"Very pretty and not too big. If you like really big earrings, probably go for the cottonwood leaf earrings. They are much bigger<br />Update: after owning these earrings for a while they are permanently discolored. The hooks look tarnished and the leaves are brassy. Disappointed because they are so cute."
3.0,Shirt is really big
3.0,Fit a bit large.
3.0,The quality is on par for what I paid for the hat.
3.0,The blue one is much lighter than displayed. Wee bit disappointed but still pretty spiffy.
3.0,"love the mush platform, with the hidden strap between the toes, however, the left shoe does not fit well. The large strap rubs against my foot. and it's my smaller foot. the right one fits fine like all other Tevas that I've bought. I'll wear them just not much."
3.0,"It's alright. It came in earlier than expected... that's good. Overall, I like it."
3.0,Chose medium which resulted in a very tight fit making it difficult to pull on socks.
3.0,It’s okay! Just know if you’ve a big head you might as well don’t buy because it doesn’t have a stretch band or anything. Weird product
3.0,"For the price, they are fine.  Found them to be a bit large for my face and the plastic is quite light, so I don't expect them to last very long."
3.0,"I hate that you have to buy the same size in both the top and bottom. I am larger on bottom than on top, so I bought the suit in my bottoms size. The top you're able to adjust with the straps, so it wasn't much of a problem, but I would have liked the top to be smaller. This suit has NO give, so if there is any extra flab on your waist, it's going to squish it out. Also, I noticed the other night, while playing sand volleyball, the blue bottoms show sweat. Not a problem if you're in and out of the pool, but not the most attractive look on a beach volleyball court. Overall it's cute - has the look of a triangl suit."
3.0,"Not spectacularly made, but very warm."
3.0,Very weird cut.
3.0,"These earrings are cute, but they hurt my ears. I have very sensitive skin that reacts to nickel and other metals that aren't pure. The description reads silver, but my ears tell me there is another metal in these earrings. If you have sensitive skin, don't order these earrings."
3.0,A little too small for a good fit..
3.0,"It a bit large, not too large to return, but I had hoped it had been a bit more firm fitting. I have a waist, and this dress does not show it off. It makes me look pretty tree like, straight up and down."
3.0,"The band over all is nice, but I have only put it on my watch 3 times, and this morning it ripped by the little knob to clip it into the watch."
3.0,"Well put together as far as stitching. I bought a xxl and its huge everywhere, waist, shoulders etc... I was hoping for something more fitted, but bigger than normal. This is just built like a tarp. So it's a good hoodie, just not at all stylish."
3.0,Really pretty EXCEPT one of the dangling little hearts is backwards!!
3.0,"Clever idea of writing on the stone,  however there is not any.  I took a picture and blew it up, it's just a nice plain stone.<br /><br />The gift box is nice and the pendant part comes with a small plastic bag over it.  If I was gifting it, I would send it to me and take the plastic bag off before giving it as a gift.<br /><br />The necklace overall is very nice.  It has an adjustable string for length.  The pendent is substantial and has a height to it."
3.0,pretty bracelet!
3.0,"Fits well, love the graphics. The only reason I couldn’t give it 5 stars: the one and only time I wore it, little holes developed on the front of the shirt. Didn’t snag it or anything, just looks like the fabric is so thin it separated  into 3-4 small holes on the front. Can’t imagine it could ever be repaired, so may try to get a refund or replacement"
3.0,Super cute but too small. I even ordered a size up to be sure.
3.0,The size does not match the clothing sizes in the United States.  I am keeping the coat anyway because I just MIGHT lose weight.
3.0,They are VERY tight at the ankle.
3.0,Nice key chain very unique.
3.0,It's ok quality
3.0,[[VIDEOID:731c27ae5394ac6256bbcde4ee301c25]] My dress did not have a hole for wrapping
3.0,The mask was too large for my face. I’m sure for a larger person the mask would fit fine.
3.0,Nice boot. But 2/3 is more on the 2 side
3.0,I order the wrong size to short
3.0,"This dress fits great. I am on the petite side [4'11, 95 lbs], so I struggle with finding a good length when I buy dresses. But the length is perfect. It is appropriate for work or a special occasion. My only complaint is that the fabric kind of poofs out in the front where the folding is under the seam at the waist. It's right on my abdomen, so it isn't super flattering. I have not tried to iron it where the folding is to see if that helps, so I plan on trying that."
3.0,"I loved the look of the Charge 4 expensive band when it was released, so I purchased these to get that same look, however they look and feel incredibly cheap.  The connecter pieces are plastic, and they didn't even try to hide it.  The bands are very long - definitely large size, not sure if I missed the size option or what, but I'm on the tightest notch for this band.  I'm normally in the middle of the small on the regular Fitbit brand bands.  Was going to return, but I waited too long and missed the deadline."
3.0,"FOR COMPUTE GLARE AND MINIMIZING EYE STRAIN, THESE WORK JUST FINE. THE COLOR CHOICES ARE QUITE GOOD AND GETTING TWO PAIRS AT A REASONABLE AND GOOD DEAL ONLY ADDS TO REASONS TO BUY.<br />FOR ME? THESE LIVE UP TO CLAIMS AND DESCRIPTIONS.<br />I RECOMMEND."
3.0,"Good pants for the price, in love with the pockets. Not a big fan of the fabric, kinda shiney / makes noise with thicker thigh women."
3.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; and normally wear a 10-12 and bought a medium due to the reviews saying it ran large.  Too small, more like an american petite size, did not fit correctly anywhere."
3.0,"Over all it's a great bag for the money HOWEVER it smells really really bad. We took it out of the plastic bag and whatever coating is on the bag is very powerful. We put newspaper inside the bag to get rid of the smell, it still smells. We have hung it outside for a week and half, it's better but it still smells. My husband even wiped it down like the instructions says to .Hopefully in time the smell will disapate."
3.0,Would be better if they were polarize
3.0,The ears cuffs and board good but the tail and gloves are kind of crappy
3.0,Color is paler than it looks in pictures.
3.0,"Sizes run very big.  I ordered a small, but found it very baggy and long."
3.0,"I like them because they're warm and comfy, but after one winter of pulling them off with my hands, they've torn between the knit section and that purple bottom section."
3.0,Comfortable but not compression
3.0,These may work for some people. As a postal worker working with mail trays however they snag and then look terrible. They do however stay put and do not slide down. These are very very comfortable to wear....just not for delivering mail. I would say they are fair as far as quality. Do I think they offer as much protection as other brands....well I am dubious..but for the price and for casual wear I might buy again.
3.0,"The glasses are indeed brilliant.  Much too bright for my taste.  I prefer a more subtle gold, so I will never wear them and can't return them."
3.0,"So I ordered two sizes up according to everyone's reviews. I am 5'2 116 pounds, I recommend buying only one size up if you are petite. It's not too large that I can't wear but would have preferred a smaller size for comfort."
3.0,"These are okay. There were a lot of them and there’s a lot of variety in styles, but I found that on a lot of them the sticky backing would peel right off when you were trying to get the paper off."
3.0,Color fades very quickly faded by my third day
3.0,Washed in cool water but still Shrinks a lot when washed.
3.0,my nephew loved it amd was even able to color it himself.
3.0,Pants split after one use. Child wasn't running or doing activities to warrant breakage. Poor construction.
3.0,"This came with multiple snags and an INCREDIBLY itchy tag that I had to use a seam ripper to remove. I would have returned it had I noticed the snags before removing the tag, but it's really not too bad. It's not long sleeved though, so the pic isn't accurate. It is very stretchy, I am a 38 DDD and got a large (I like my stuff tight, and it did stretch out and fit fine). I am 6' and it come to a few inches below my underwire."
3.0,"It’s okay, pretty disappointed with the material. It’s a really hot inside material, definitely not suitable for anything but cold weather. It rides up and the front parts that covers your breasts move around easily. It just wasn’t what I expected, it’s not like the pictures for sure."
3.0,I bought this in navy.  The fit and weight of sweater was good but I thought the stripes were not particularly flattering. I thought it would have a more classic look but the stripes detract quite a bit.  Wanted to love it but returned it.
3.0,i loved the earrings  just kinda heavy for my ears
3.0,"The earring itself was ok. The quality was fine for the small amount paid, but the clasp on one of the earrings broke immediately upon opening it. Currently in the process of returning it and not having any hassles."
3.0,"It is super pretty, however if you have a smaller or thinner foot size it will not fit and will just slide off."
3.0,Love the look and fit but it constantly rips my hairs off my arm. Not fun to be working lift your arm and BOOM-RIP there goes another arm hair lol
3.0,This is my first purchase of an anatomical girth. Of course there are many choices & I’d prefer not to go completely broke. We don’t compete. I like that this is lightweight & have high hopes it’ll hold up well thru the summer.
3.0,"To small, short and thin material"
3.0,Boa is good enough for costume purposes. Did not expect Broadway type quality....good enough for costume party and western saloon theme.
3.0,I bought this and I'm an idiot for not seeing that it's a cuff not an actually earring.
3.0,"Asian sizing, so order accordingly. Cute design, but cheap material."
3.0,"These are really cute and my daughter loves them, unfortunately the stitching that holds the tongue and the side of the shoe ripped within a week."
3.0,like it but fit is somewhat small for xl
3.0,Nice quality but if you are buying to fit in your Loungefly.. look elsewhere
3.0,"Beautiful dress for the price, only thing is that it took 3 weeks to arrive."
3.0,"Just a plain wallet, incredibly thick when you put anything in it."
3.0,They’re super tiny!! Not for my face but I buy sojo all the time and love their sunglasses. These just weren’t for my face.
3.0,"Good quality, but WAY too small. I am normally an XS so ordered a S and could barely get it on. Unfortunately will not be able to wear comfortably."
3.0,"there was a lot of excess fabric to the dress.  When cinched under a belt it wasn't as flattering as I'd have liked.  The leather part of the belt was also rather short so there was a large ackward gap in the back even though it looked cute enough from the front.  I ordered the size smaller, but just wasn't thrilled with the otherall look."
3.0,Can't tell from the pics but the bifocals line is visible on these glasses. The magnification area is so small and close to the bottom that these glasses are impractical even for book reading unless I hold the book up against my stomach and look straight down.
3.0,Design is nice and patch and strap look great.  I got it for my husband and it is small.  not sure if this is a kid's backpack.
3.0,"The eyeholes weren't as big as I thought they'd be, so it's pretty hard to see."
3.0,Pretty chain but a little stiff.  Not as fluid as some others I have.
3.0,"Comfortable and casual, very breathable. My only complaint is the upper portion around the breast is thin and shows your bra easily and it's too thin to go without."
3.0,"Hard to get cards into the slots, and although it seems spacious it doesn't fit my iPhone 7 without forcing the zipper closed."
3.0,Good material but a bit small
3.0,Serves a really great purpose but the zipper broke as soon as I took it out the plastic wrapping. I'm satisfied with the bungee strings so I chose not to send it back but if the zipper broke before even taking it out the packaging I can only wonder how long it will take for the bungee strings to mess up.
3.0,the seam ripped on the shoulder.  this is my sons favorite shirt!
3.0,Looks nice and is well made... I gave is three stars because it is way to big. Like almost passport big :P
3.0,"The material was fine and the product as pictured, but found the wrap didn't say in place too well.  Probably just my body size (&#34;D&#34; cup).  I think smaller women would like it - very pretty colors."
3.0,"I love this, but def size up I wear a 4 in pants and they are super short"
3.0,I bought the Champagne strapless dress and its absolutely stunning!!!! the only two things that ill say about it is the bottom is too long I think i'll have to wear stripper heels to lift it and if your a thick girl within your size to size up by one because there is no stretch its a very snug fit.
3.0,"the sleeves are too short and the material is rather ""scratchy""......"
3.0,"It's really cute, BUT the pockets don't lay flat and make the sides stick out and it just makes me look wider. I didn't see anyone else mention this problem so maybe it's just a matter of where the pockets hit on my body."
3.0,Pretty but small for size and expensive for what it is. . Replacement sent as the first was torn at seams before she even could try it on.... replacement very small. Didn’t fit a size 5-6 little girl.
3.0,Materials used for the smaller beads are kind of cheap.  But the colors were true to the image
3.0,"15.5 inch measurement meant size 2, and that’s what I ordered. But they don’t feel very tight?"
3.0,"I ordered this same exact sweater from three different sellers over the past two months, one was an exchange, so 4 times total. Every single time, I received a BROWN sweater when I ordered an OLIVE sweater. I assume the bar code is wrong. I looove the sweater, HATE the color I received. Returning YET ANOTHER ugly brown sweater. I want this so hard in OLIVE but it seems that I am not destined to own it."
3.0,The quality was different than what I expected and the sewing is already coming out but wear it to sleep anyhow. Like my order
3.0,Bought these for my child's bday party. The ears with the bow have larger ears vs the plain ones are quite smaller. The Plain ones stand up but are slightly floppy on some that haven't been glued down all the way. But overall it's a good purchase for a children's party.
3.0,I really liked it but the only thing I was upset about was the scarf had nothing on it ita jus blue
3.0,Fit exactly as expected just the material was just a weird texture. I don’t know how to explain it.
3.0,Runs slightly larger than expected.  Full Coverage.  Hair towel with button fastener also large.<br />Aquamarine color more a mint green.<br />Launders nicely.
3.0,Shirt was fine. But both the bottoms faded after a wash.
3.0,"I love these earrings - they are pretty and keep their shine!  However, the closure is tricky for me to use - it takes multiple tries for me to get it closed, and then again to get it open.  I wouldn't recommend it for cartilege piercings for that reason."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:93e0db4337bd54091be4602759f6406a]] I needed an 18 gauge but was sent a 22 gauge instead. They are very pretty but don't want my piercing any smaller than it already is.
3.0,"I wear a size 12 W shoe, bought a 12 Olukai, ugh, got smart and read the strap on the pair of Olukai's I was wearing and ordered the 13 R...... nice!!!!!  Go a size up and treat your feet right."
3.0,bit small.....it's ok...wouldn't order it again though
3.0,Richardson is mentioned in the description. But not Richardson brand.
3.0,A little bigger than I wanted but it's ok
3.0,one of tge jews is put on poorly and is crooked
3.0,"These are cute and an OK thickness.  However, one of the belts was made incorrectly.  Both ends have hooks, instead of one having hooks and the other having loops.  The item itself is also obviously cheap.  It's getting a 3 because I can still use the other two, and the messed up one is in the color I was least likely to use, anyway.  And it fits, I guess.  I bit on the tight side, but my waist is 36&#34;.  It doesn't feel terrible, it just makes me muffin-top.<br /><br />In the picture below, the green circles the &#34;correct&#34; set up of one belt, while the red circles the flawed one."
3.0,Nice size and looking charm as long as it does not turn green it should be a keeper.
3.0,Color was nice
3.0,"You're paying for the quality or getting for the bulk price. These are not easily bendable, you would actually have to use some sort of jewelry pliers if you would like to turn this into more of an L-shaped piercing. About half of the time the jewel will fall out so you just have to be careful about that"
3.0,Material and colour little different than expected and the material is stretchy and fits larger than usual. But it's an ok dress for the price.
3.0,Very thin and delicate material. It's not made of real winter like material but will fit good enough for a business meeting or a funeral. It hanged a bit too low on the legs.
3.0,"I ordered the blue striped ones and loved them. I needed a black pair, so ordered the ones that said black. They came in and are not black. They are a dark blue. So be aware the color description is false."
3.0,"I love that these don't have a visible waistband! That's exactly what I was looking for and why I got them. In my opinion, a horizontal line on the waist of any other leggings visually shortens legs and creates an unflattering look. The material of Commando is great - very pleasant to the touch and hides any lumps and bumps. I have a very thin waist (23""), and normally all leggings are too loose in that area. These in XS size fit great in the waist, but I believe it will dig into the skin for anyone a bit large than I am. The rise is very high, a bit too high for my 5'3"" frame. It stays put well. For me, the leggings are slightly large in the hips, yet they flatten the booty. The length is also not the most flattering, they end about 5"" from my ankle bone. Overall - great material, great waistband, and so-so design overall."
3.0,"Somewhat disappointed. The chin strap did not come attached to the hat. The only way I can figure out how to attach it is to shove the end pieces of the strap through holes in the straw. Now the strap toggles show on the outside of the hat. Also, keep in mind the holes in the straw hat do not prevent germs from coming through. I bought this as an alternative to a facemask without thinking about those holes. :("
3.0,These were decent snow pants but I returned as they didn’t fit my daughter. She’s at that tough age of between between kids sizes and adult sizes. The small was too tight in the waist and a tad too long. But overall they were nice and has a high waist so the snow wouldn’t have snuck in. Returning was very slick so seller was easy to work with.
3.0,"The material is very thin and see through, but it does fit nicely and is very soft."
3.0,"The product itself was exactly what I expected; however, I returned them because of the price.  I saw them on an endcap at Walmart for 1/3 of the Amazon price was."
3.0,Contacted supplier to replace
3.0,I'm rather old with little muscle.  I can't even pull them up my leg.
3.0,So big and it looks like a maternity shirt. I wore it and my daughter asked if I was pregnant again!
3.0,"Nice shape but it’s vinyl, not real leather"
3.0,I like the top but it is skin tight!  I wont be able to wear this top.
3.0,"The material is really susceptible to snagging. Within two weeks, bits of the elastic were poking out of it, and I had to keep trimming them off because it looks trashy. I'll keep it around for use during times when I don't want to muck up my nicer bands."
3.0,"This is a beautiful ring, but it definitely runs small--maybe even a couple of sizes.  It is well worth the price with shipping if you can order a few sizes up."
3.0,Average not as pretty in person
3.0,Its pretty cool.. I like it.. But the ring broke too easily..
3.0,Very nice and the price was right
3.0,"These did not seem to stretch very well.  I'm normally in a large bottom, but these did not really fit over my rear.  Cute design, but not a great fit. If you are blessed with a little extra in the trunk, these won't fit very well."
3.0,"A jeweler was able to remove a few links, so it fits perfectly. I love the color and style. My only issue is that the color has worn off quite a bit of the underside, likely due to wearing it while I work on a computer all day. For the price, it is a good deal, it is unfortunate that the color wore off."
3.0,"I bought the wine/red which is a gorgeous color.  However, I was expecting the sweater to be longer in the back.  It does not cover my bottom.  Not sure I like the drape."
3.0,"Nothing special about it. Soft upper fabric, striped fabric not soft at all."
3.0,Made for a teenager.
3.0,"Nice picture but shirt is wide, more like a shirt you go to sleep in"
3.0,"looks great,  feel weird when your thighs rub when your walking"
3.0,"Great design, but way too much of a “slim cut” to be comfortable (especially for a big guy, like me).  It’s wearable, but not comfortable enough to want to wear all day"
3.0,"The picture on the outside peeled off quick, and the bottom of the cup comes off after a few times of washing it"
3.0,a bit tight but its ok
3.0,Low quality cheap plastic. Not very clear.
3.0,CLASP HARD TO CONNECT
3.0,"The shoe looks great but unfortunately, not knowing about the change in shoe size I got shoes that were one size too big. As it is clothing I cannot return or exchange them. I am sad because these shoes are really nice. I'll just have to grow bigger feet."
3.0,The quality of the leather is decent and thick. But this really isn't a good coin purse because it doesn't open up easily. You have to poke your fingers in the pouch to get coins out or flip the holder upside down and shake. Standard coin purses have accordion style openings for a reason. This design ignores that reason and the result is something that is best as a credit card or business card holder. It does make for a decent business card holder. You can put about 7 or 8 cards in the pouch and it does protect them well.
3.0,"This kimono is the second of the type we have received.  This one is a bit more decorative with pom poms and tassels in the corner.  Even though this kimono is more decorative than our first, it remains a piece of material sewn on two sides.  The material is still thin and the kimono absolutely requires something be worn underneath (unless it is a coverup after showering or bathing, or a coverup over other clothes).<br /><br />So, maybe this kimono might be okay as something to wear on top of a swimsuit, or a t-shirt and shorts, but it is just kind of shapeless and uninspiring. Our rating of three stars is based mostly on appearance, and our belief that this kimono only has limited utility.<br /><br />Good luck!"
3.0,Sizes were not in US sizes so too small
3.0,These pants are super cute and fit as expected .... but they don’t wash that well. When they first arrived the fabric felt thick and I felt like they had great compression. After just one wash they felt pretty thin and the compression was lost. They are a cute legging but I don’t think I’d buy again as part of my gym apparel.
3.0,I thought the necklace would be a smaller scale.  Kind of large.
3.0,Really liked the boots but had to send them back because I ordered a size 9 and received a 71/2.
3.0,Size runs a little big and the colors fade fast after washing.
3.0,"Loved this product, looked great, fit well.....  but then washed it, and the “one” is no longer!  Bummer since it was her first birthday outfit....."
3.0,"They're a lot larger than I expected. Look very 70s, but not in a bad way."
3.0,"These are pretty good! They don't ride up, but the grey pair's fabric is really rough."
3.0,wide. made me feel pregnant . returned
3.0,i read the reviews and it said to 1/2 size up... not needed.
3.0,looks very sexy and realfitzwelllook just like the picture
3.0,"The product looks like the picture. The fit is fine, but the inseam is to long."
3.0,"Flattering fit, and cute color. Very sheer though and probably won’t be able to wear without something over it and tights."
3.0,"Don't size up!  I did, because it's an Asian product, and usually their clothes run ridiculously small, but this one is so large, I will have to see if I can alter it.  It was too inexpensive to bother with a return."
3.0,Love the look but the magnet doesnt always hold.
3.0,"They are worth exactly $10.  Great cheap, light beach sunglasses if you are like me and constantly break or lose sunglasses.  Don't use them for driving or sightseeing.  The lenses are crap & very subject to glare."
3.0,"Convenient, but the tee holding holes are challenging to use."
3.0,"I was looking for a necklace to replace a childhood mustard seed necklace given to me by my grandmother.  It's nice but I was disappointed with the chain.  I thought I would just switch out the chain for a nicer, longer one but the pendant(s) were rather difficult to remove from the chain itself.  I decided to keep it though because of the message behind the mustard seed... and... it reminded me of my grandmother's necklace from so long ago."
3.0,"I wanted these for a 70’s themed party. First ordered a large after reading reviews. I normally wear a M,10. Had to return as they were very tight. So I ordered an XL . Just received and tried on. They will do ok for the party, however even they are bit snug. Sizing is crazy, so beware of that. There is some stretch but not enough to be very forgiving. I have the rest of my outfit already planned to go with these crushed velvet pants, or I’d return them too. Way overpriced for the quality and off sizing you get."
3.0,"The masks are nice enough, but I bought them because the description said these were cotton which I wanted for breathability.  These are nylon which means they hold moisture against your skin (instead of wicking it away) and they become unbearable in an hour or two, so I need to change masks several times a day."
3.0,"It's a good product if you're okay with it not being black. There was not a single angle or light I could put this chain in to make it look black when I received it, and I tried hard. It was more like a dark gray. I understand that lighting makes this the case, but then they shouldn't call it black, and the photographs should probably reflect this. It's a bit misleading.<br /><br />I specifically wanted black, so I returned it."
3.0,"I need a larger size. The overall product is good, but there could be a better description on the sizes."
3.0,I ordered this necklace for my granddaughter for her birthday.  I was disappointed in the quality and appearance. It looked like a dime store necklace. Would not recommend.
3.0,very beautiful piece hasnt tarnish yet like some belly rings i buy from amazon. But the diamonds glitter and its a really beautiful piece to wear in a pool or beach
3.0,"A little smaller than what I expected. Very cute, looking forward to wearing it!"
3.0,came broken and with the wrong stone color.
3.0,"These are crop jeans.. I thought they were jeans so I had to return. I wear size 12 and ordered 13 these fit very snug but stretch.. These are low rise , if I ordered again I would get size 15."
3.0,"Its ok, but not the greatest. I sent it back. I like the straps and top but it is sewn kind of funny near the ruffle and not a smooth tight swim suit fit before the ruffle hits. It is like the sewing to the ruffle makes the material crooked. Not a bad price, but not the best top."
3.0,"Belt that is included with the dress is a completely different size than the dress. The dress ordered was a size XXL, which fits as expected. The belt included has to be probably a size S, or a M at the absolute largest."
3.0,Cheap quality but do what it's worth it'll do the job..!
3.0,C or d cup needs to get a large or else will fit to snugg. Cami runs small. I got a medium because that's what I normally where and it's very snugg. But it's nice
3.0,Had to return as fit was much smaller than expected. Looks good but had to return
3.0,Very hard to attach to fitbit
3.0,"Incredibly sturdy...so much so that you cant adjust the sizing without a pair of pliers. Even then, this product was not made to be adjusted."
3.0,If you judge these glasses by the frame material or the packaging and the case you 2will probably conclude these glasses  aren't of the best quality but they look very fashionable.  They do appear to be more expensive pair.  The lenses are surprisingly clear to look through as well.
3.0,Bottoms fit super well top was way too tight I wear a 34B and the band was so tight it hurt and dig into my skin I sent it back
3.0,"I forgot to see where it was made and was not happy to see that, yep, China. I wonʻt forget again. The fit is fine but the material is much heavier than I expected. Iʻm used to this style of nightgown being made with very thin cotton. This is quite heavy, which makes it warm. Itʻs okay, as I used it as a dressing gown, not to sleep in. But I probably wouldnʻt buy it again. If you like heavy nightgowns, youʻll probably love it. The pockets are fabulous. I wanted to give it 3 ½ stars but amazon wonʻt let me."
3.0,Very comfy shirt is like a crop top pants super comfortable i ordered  a size larger than normal should have gone up 2 sizes shrinks alot.
3.0,"I got two in my package but BOTH were for the left ear, I prefer to wear mine on the right and it's impossible......I bought it with the impression it would go on my right ear like in the picture."
3.0,Black started fading after couple weeks but overall great product
3.0,"Fun, but too tight for adults and no way to adjust."
3.0,"You get , for the price , what you pay for !!!"
3.0,Not what I expected. The quality is good but it seems these are best for motorcycle riders and for daytime use doesn't work as well as the reviews stated .
3.0,I did not like how the top strap came up to high under the breast.  Tight and some spots loose and others .
3.0,"TMI bought two glasses. One for myself and my girlfriend, however when I got them. I was excited because they looked real good but when I tried mine. It was big for my face so I knew right away that it wouldn't fit my girlfriend because she has a strianghter face than mine and The leg of the glasses wasn't The quality I anticipated. The case was awesome. I planned on giving them to two males."
3.0,"Not bad for the price actually. The hems seem unfinished though and I'm a little worried they will fray with washing. The sleeves feel oddly tight in comparison to the shirt though. The necklace is junk, cheap plastic that would go nicely with a ring from a gumball machine, gave that to the cats to play with lol. Overall, I am satisfied for the price but would not purchase again because of quality."
3.0,"My flowers were much darker then the photo more like a brown purple.. I was going to buy to but decided I wanted to see what it looked like first. Won't buy again, also the flowers move around. They aren't sealed in a permeant spot."
3.0,"There used to be a military surplus store nearby where I could get what, apparently, were genuine US Navy watch hats.  Unfortunately, the store closed a few years ago and I have not been able to find the real item since then.  This product is no exception.  The Navy watch hats I used to get were very densely woven and wind did not penetrate them.  While these hats claim to be manufactured to US military specifications, they are loosely knitted and stretchy.  They fit nicely but the wind goes right through them.  In terms of warmth, they are typical of hats purchased at a discount store.  They are fine for wearing under a parka hood or when you need just a bit of something on your head but if you want protection from serious cold, especially if it is windy, they won't do the job."
3.0,"Bag is very thin, almost to the point of being ""crinkly"" like groceries bags. Zippers are cheaply made and make that sound like they are about to rip apart if your aren't very careful when zipping. It's ok for lightweight stuff but I wouldn't recommend this if you are looking for something rugged or for outdoor use like camping, hiking, ECT."
3.0,The color was exactly right but I feel the purse was a little small for the price and the material on handles look really cheap.
3.0,"Very small, good for very young kid."
3.0,"Runs small, but I cut the sleeves off and it will be great for the warmer weather or to wear over a snug fitting thermal top"
3.0,"These shoes are smaller than advertised. I ordered an 11, they fit like a 10 and are marked 8. I sent them back for a refund with no issues."
3.0,"The overall fit of the shirt is nice, very flattering. Loose and flowy without being too baggy. I ordered the large, I am 5'3 38DD 150lbs. Only thing I dont like is the neck is not as wide as it appears in the pictures and it's not a soft pink color it's more of a salmon pink color."
3.0,"Fits snugly and tightly if/when you are able to get the clasps closed. I straight-up ask my significant other to help me put this thing on that I wore it once before shoving it into the recesses of my closet for that &#34;just in case i need to wear a bra that gives me killer cleavage&#34; situation. If the clasp wasn't that hard to close that I feel like a struggling muscle-fatigued adult, I'd love it."
3.0,"Be forewarned that the little pads on the nose pieces will fall off, maybe sooner rather than later, and you will end up with glasses that will probably never break, but will irritate your nose."
3.0,Barely can see the writing
3.0,Cute but didn’t provide a lot of coverage
3.0,I have a long torso and have a hard time finding one piece swimsuits. This was too short
3.0,"Super cute, but the fuzzy part is not stitched on very good.  I plan to add more stitches to secure myself."
3.0,"Not for us really big guys!<br />Other than that they're pretty nice, took them to Lake Tahoe last week! :)"
3.0,My son tore the arm out sliding down a hill on a sled on say one- no apperant cause other than moving his arms - fit was correct:(. Warm- but might as well keep looking.
3.0,i liked this hat alot and i want people to know if you have a pet you will get hairs on the hat
3.0,Still super cute and I'm able to pass them down to the next kiddo who is super excited. The problem is that there is a narrow spot in the shoe so it rubbed blisters onto my oldests feet.
3.0,It was okay.  I kind of wrecked it when I opened the package.  Hopefully I can repair it.
3.0,Quality product but very heavy
3.0,I like the feel. The cut is satisfactory but the jeans look much lighter in the picture. Maybe because it's up against a white backdrop.<br />When I got them they were darker than I had anticipated. I almost thought they gave me a different color.
3.0,It is self winding as long as you wear it. If you don't wear it for a day it has to be reset
3.0,"OK, so this dress was made available to me by the Vine program as you can see from my review, but when I clicked on the product the reviews were all for bathing suits?  I want to just let you know that my review is for the dress pictured and not a bathing suit.<br /><br />With that being said, I'm not totally impressed.  The design itself is cute (I got the red one with the flowers) and it is true to size BUT it's not lined at all so, you'll likely want to wear something under it and not to mention the fact that when I walked in it, the slit in the dress basically went all the way up to my underwear or close enough to make me really uncomfortable to wear this in public.  It's a shame because it is very cute and looks nice!  I would likely use some garment tape to keep the slit from opening that much..."
3.0,"Wasn't a fan and returned it. I thought it was going to be more of a soft, comfy shirt, and it was more of an athletic material."
3.0,They run small! My kids are very petite anyways but i got a size up an it was still small so get couple sizes up. Super cute tho and thickness n quality good. Just the sizing is tricky ya now. Nothing bad to say just as anything each brand clothes runs a bit different. We recommend them.
3.0,"Cute dress and fits well but the material is very transparent. There is a second layer under the skirt but it doesn't offer any additional coverage, I wore it with a cheap navy mini skirt from H&M and pasties and it worked well for a outdoor summer wedding."
3.0,The dress us beautiful but does not fit properly at all.
3.0,"Really quite cozy dress, perfect for a colder day with a pair of tights and boots. Warm material, yet, still breathable. I found this to remind me of a holiday dress, it has gold stripes within it, it makes it a bit festive and sparkly. More of an event style dress vs. an everyday wear type of dress."
3.0,"A little on the tight side, usually buy a 2X, so thought a 3X would be loose, but it wasn't."
3.0,Sleeves are a bit narrow for the size being xl.
3.0,"These fit well and I love the high waist, but the fabric is uncomfortable and too shiny for me. It drew attention to any lines from underclothes that were present."
3.0,"I really enjoyed this belly button ring, it was comfortable, great for training and looked great. It did fall out after only a couple of days so I’m not sure if it loosened on its own or if I didn’t tighten it enough."
3.0,It was more like a t-shirt dress than the one showed but it still works as a comfy dress.
3.0,"I really like these, but they don't last long. I'd buy em again because they were inexpensive."
3.0,"They make the shoes comfortable in terms of feeling, but my feet slide even more in these. I can’t win, I guess."
3.0,"Cute shirts. It runs small, the woman’s medium is a girls medium🙄"
3.0,Broke easily.. very fragile. But beautiful desigy
3.0,The first ones clasp broke so my mom had to order me this a second time
3.0,Was not a plus size item
3.0,Cheap one wear skirts. Perfect for Halloween or event for a child especially preschooler. You get 4 but literally one time use disposable. The waist starts twisting and wearing out after that. I bought it for my kindergarten superhero deess up day. She was batgirl.<br />Best price on Amazon for what we were looking for.
3.0,Much smaller than expected. I read the size chart and this did not fit at all. This is not made for busty girls at all! I gave it to my friend who is much smaller than me as a gift.
3.0,"Bought this for a wedding as a bridesmaid, served its purpose but is very cheaply made. No biggie since it was cheaply purchased as well."
3.0,the fit was very nice although I guess that depends on the shape of your ears. My original shippment came with a broken one but I haven't had any problem since.
3.0,Nice thin pants.  Stitching is good and all clasps are quality.  Length is fine but the run small in the thighs.  Get a size up amd you'll be happy
3.0,These mask are small and the one mask is a different size from the other 2
3.0,Fabric promotes static cling. Haven’t worn it because of that reason.
3.0,"Considering the price, they serve their purpose.  I was hoping for something a bit more like old fashioned handkerchiefs."
3.0,Ok I like them.
3.0,The socks material is a little more thin than I would like. I feel like I’m going to wear through them fast.
3.0,"I bought for an engagement photo shoot, but I decided to get another dress stubbs this one doesn't look like the color I was going for. For the sake of photos, this dress was fine because no one knows that it is really really cheap, but if I were going somewhere live, I wouldn't wear because it is very very thin. It feels like something you'd buy in the $15 price range, not $35. The green color is also a much duller green."
3.0,Very stretchy. I expected it to keep my legs more hobbled. Very nice skirt.
3.0,Really baggy and starts to fray really fast. I've had it for almost two months now.
3.0,"The mesh jumpsuit has long legs, but it is perfect if you are wearing heels. You may need to just hem a little. This is a big mesh material, so if you have jewelry or long nails, you are sure to get them in the holes. Otherwise, this is a sexy swim suit coverup for parties."
3.0,I thought I would like this mask but it looks like I'm wearing someone's underwear. Nope
3.0,Just ok nothing  great.
3.0,"These look adorable - super cute design. Unfortunately the panel is thin so I'm guessing it will be the first to go with extended wear...but I""ll never know for sure because these run super small. How small? Small enough to not fit over my size 6 hips. Short, small-super cute."
3.0,"Be careful with washing, it wrinkles and shrinks , doesn't look as nice after washing,"
3.0,When I received it I was expecting a better quality umbrella.  Design of the flower is very pretty.  It is very small.
3.0,Not very well-made but looks cool
3.0,"Nice watch, just tiny"
3.0,Not sweatshirt material. Think polyester I think.
3.0,The shoes are cute but turned out being a totally different color from what I was expecting ):
3.0,"Too small for my taste, but it is made well."
3.0,See through and a bit long but other than that I like it.
3.0,Very cute and comfortable. The dress fits okay except for the chest area (way too small). Buttons are stretched to the max! And all the buttons are a pain.
3.0,Disappointed that they are too big.  I have spent much money on the net buying slippers and have not found any that fit properly.  Any ideas from anyone?
3.0,"Very pretty, but on the small side.  I was expecting the bead to be all colored blown glass not glass over some color.  the photo of the bead is deceiving.  But what can you expect not buying pandora?"
3.0,2 of the rings feel like plastic and look like it to
3.0,"Too small, even thou it’s my size it’s very tight. Order the next size for a good fit."
3.0,Very pretty & delicate. We’ll see if it lasts putting it on & taking it off …
3.0,"watch faces is nice, not too large, but the band is a bit wide and too large/stiff for my taste."
3.0,The glasses are super stylish SUPER lightweight which makes them extremely vulnerable to be destroyed. Not worth the money but my husband likes them.
3.0,A lot smaller then I thought it would be
3.0,Color isn't what I saw online.  Its a much lighter hue that I don't care for.
3.0,"Looks very stylish but major issue with the fitting at bust area. I ordered a Small (5ft 117lb) and it did fit very nicely waist down. The problem is with the cups which are loose and ends up showing gaps at the sides of the bust. This is big problem for me and doesn’t feel very secured. Ok if u just want to sit and relax at the beach or pool side without much activity. But if it comes to swimming, snorkeling or any other activities then i won’t dare!"
3.0,"not flattering to plus size with curves. To tight in chest area, odd length not long or short enough. Material not soft almost a still quality about it."
3.0,The earring itself is stunning considering it is not a real diamond. However the very tiny backs that go on the studs are so small I cannot pick them up. I have had to uses backs from other earrings.
3.0,"Is I dont like the clear plastic button clasp.  It cheapens the look. Yes it is not an expensive piece to begin with,<br />but why go out of your way to make it look cheap. A nicer clasp may cost a buck more but it would ad value and a far better look."
3.0,"I love this bracelet, it's so l pretty. I didn't give it 5 stars because I've only had it since January and some of the rings and the clasp are already tarnished or have lost the finish. They look black against the rose gold"
3.0,Nice very pricy and on small youth side.
3.0,"I liked the design, but when I received it and tried it on, I didn't care for the material. It was more like a house dress. The material looked a little thicker on the picture. Had to request refund on the item."
3.0,This hat is ill fitting. I bought one of these at a shop where I was able to try it on and I liked it so much jumped online to buy a few different colors. I bought this one and another color here. The best way to describe the fit is the hat is perfect for sitting outside and reading a book/kindle (looking down). But it isn't good for other functions where you have to look up because of the angle at which the visor portion is tilted.  It makes it hard to drive or walk dogs (looking up for oncoming  traffic) without tilting your head way back to see the road.
3.0,Small than the true fit. Reasonable priced
3.0,The boots where okay they are very warm and comfortable
3.0,"Overall these are good, especially for the price. They're pretty thick, so there's no issues with being see-through; however, they also feel heavier than other athletic shorts. Personally, I like them under shorts to stop chafing and I think they're better than other bike shorts for actual biking. They go down low enough and don't ride up. Deep pockets are fine for day-to-day wear, but wouldn't hold up to biking.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the seams are at a weird angle. They stitch at a wonky diagonal, making it always seem like you aren't wearing them correctly or they are crooked or something. You get used to the way it feels, but with the lighter grey color I feel like it's not very flattering looking.<br /><br />Utility, not appearance, for these."
3.0,Very nice but size wise runs small.
3.0,I bought the proper size. I'm a 40DDD these are way to tall for me. The cups seems to fit okay but the back is too long. If I could hem it up by 3 or 4 inches these would fit a whole lot better.
3.0,Inside of shoes tore up after wearing 2 times. On plus side bottom of shoes seem durable for my 7 year.
3.0,Not as nice as the one from Nitagut but not bad either. It does have pockets ( for your Wurther’s Originals) which most cardigans do. As I mentioned the collars is too high and the fabric doesn’t have the body to support it.
3.0,It’s a little small around the breast area to be a medium but I can work with it
3.0,"These shorts are as good as underwear.... They pretty much fit exactly as pictured. They are midrise and don't quite cover your ass. My preference would be not to wear these out, but I bought them for lounging around and home exercise. The reason for the mark-down is that they are waaay to big and the waistband is super uncomfortable. I usually wear a 0-2 so I ordered an XS, but I could probably fit another person in the shorts with me. There is just so much extra material especially in the front (so probably great for guys), but it's not even helpful for someone who may have a larger butt. Secondly, they are midrise but they have a thin band of elastic that doesn't actually offer any support but makes it uncomfortable and unflattering. Also, the bottom of the shorts may have a tendency to roll a bit, but that could just be because they are too big"
3.0,Easy to wash; some came ripped; and one of mine broke while putting behind my hair. I would say they have a couple uses to them but you never know when they’re rip which is annoying. Prob won’t buy again with so many other masks out.
3.0,Loose around body but seems short sleeved.  Does not look as vibrant in person as pictured.  Looks more dingy and distressed. Two front pockets.  Would not recommend to a friend. Would not consider buying again.
3.0,the chain came in bent ---I thought after wearing it -it would straighten itself out -only wore it 3 times and its still cannot be straightend out
3.0,Way too big. It had a ugly smell when it got here.<br />Color is holding up ok but the over all shirt it not worth the price
3.0,"Umm, its difficult to review this. It runs considerably small, at least two sizes, and the top and bottom are different materials, which I wasn't aware of. I like it though, and I'll keep it, since it was a temporary shirt while I'm losing weight. It'll just be temporary in a month, or so."
3.0,Tight almost for a child even with the adjustable straps.. But extremely bedazzled sparks.  An eye turner. And it has the double layer for added protection...
3.0,"It is OKAY for those who love Polyester (100%!!!). It is not a cotton blend!!! And... It is Chinese sizing. Order two sizes up. I wear size M and ordered XL (I am 150 pounds heavy, 5 feet 6 inches high, athletically build).  It would love to have it so much, because I love the design, and how it fits. Again, it is made with Polyester."
3.0,"I didn’t receive the pattern shown on the listing. It came with only a turquoise, black and white animal print."
3.0,I love the backpack but the zipper has issues. Keeps coming apart. Will fix it and it does it again. If it comes apart again i am going to return it.<br />UPDATE: I returned it as the zipper kept coming apart. Very disappointed
3.0,"It fit me oddly. It was way too big in the shoulders and arm length, yet strangely small and high in the waist. It buttoned under my bust, which I attribute to the size of the girls. If you have more of a Barbie-esque figure (and I so do not!) this will fit you and look good on you. I guess I'm just built too much like Mrs. Potato Head for this.<br />As for the jacket itself it is very pretty and well made. The fabric is thin-ish without being cheap (perfect in late spring) and silky smooth. It's not bulky at all.  This would go great over a dress that it is just a little too cold to wear (what I intended it for).  This would also be great in the office in the middle of summer over a sun dress!"
3.0,Arrived in great shape. Very pretty. I'm not happy about the way the stones are set. They are to flat for me. I will give them as gifts so no worries.
3.0,"Looks a little cheap for the price. However, I’m pregnant, and need shirts that work with my ever changing body, which this does. Plan on wearing with a sweater to hide the plastic adjuster on the straps when it cools down a little."
3.0,"It's a nice band, but, it didn't fit the watch I had, so, I cannot use it. I waited too long, too, for returning it, so, it's sitting in a box in my basement."
3.0,"I ordered this because there are times that I don't have pockets, but I still want quick access to my phone. The pouch holds my iphone X easily.  I will still keep this in my car/bigger bag for this purpose, but I don't think I'd use it as a primary wallet because the gap where it closes there is so large. I'm afraid I might lose cash or cards.<br /><br />The red color is nice and the tassels are cute."
3.0,"This dress has the full circle skirt it claims to have, which is good. And it does warn you that the belt is going to be just a crappy ribbon, which is honest on their part, so I didn't expect anything better than what I got on that. The fabric was even decent quality.<br /><br />The dress was just boxy and unflattering, that's all. And maybe that's only because it was a little on the big side. Perhaps the next size down would have looked a little better, but I wasn't so in love with the dress that I cared to try. I think it just wasn't meant for me."
3.0,a little hard to adjust
3.0,Wished it was slightly bigger strap and it was hard to actually out on.  The directions weren't super helpful.
3.0,"best cargo pants. period. problem is that they are too dam long. even 30 is too much. they dont make 29. IM 6'3 205 pounds, and the pants are too long for me cause I dont wear them over my belly button like the model. waist is perfect at 38. But, 30 is too long. they need to make 29. Cause 30 feels like a 32 on other brands. I dont know why they did it extra long."
3.0,Like the swim slirt
3.0,It’s a beautiful top but  way to small  from  as expected
3.0,I bought this twice even bought a bigger size the 2nd time I bought it. Didn't fit so I gave them away.
3.0,Really cute but didn't last long before the top unraveled and it fell apart.
3.0,"I've always wanted a kinetic watch, and bought this watch a week ago and I'm not sure how to rate this. There are some things I like, and others I'm not so impressed with.<br /><br />Looks: Watch face too small compared to the current trend of very large watches. In fact, this Seiko looks small compared to the other kinetic watches too. Otherwise it is classy in it's simple and clean circular design and watch band.<br /><br />It looks good that on the watch face it says sappire, kinietic, and titanium. These imply a more upmarket watch.<br /><br />Quality: Sadly I got a scratch on thpart of the band with the locking clip. I had expected the titanium to be damn tough stuff, even more than stainless steel. Perhaps this is simply public perception vs reality. But disappointing nonetheless.<br /><br />Otherwise it works well, as expected for a Seiko watch.<br /><br />Would I recommend this? NO. There are other kinetic watches out there which, although more expensive, are more attractive, more eye catching, and perhaps more collectable.<br /><br />12th February 2010<br /><br />I have searched online and found my compliant is a common one. It seems that titanium comes in 9 grades. watch makers usually use grade 1 or 2, which means this is the least amount of processing of the metal done. That means it's light, as titanium should be, but it's not hard, like you'd expect. Citizen makes a titanium watch which is a higher grade and people who have bought it say they've used it everywhere with nary a scratch.<br /><br />Also, the solution to the scratches is to use an ink eraser. What's an ink eraser? I've not seen someone actually answer that, but when I was a child, we had erasers for ink- they were much rougher- like sandpaper- basically it was rough enough that it would rub away the layer of paper the ink was on- so I think this is the ink eraser- basically like sandpaper. havent been able to find a place which sells one though so cant tell you if it works or not.<br /><br />In any case, the watch runs fine, and is very light. I'm not so worried about the scratches as I know why it happens and the solution for it.<br /><br />It helps to know this first, so you can decide if you want to buy this watch."
3.0,It was not 18gauge. It fell out and i lost it. I will have to see if it comes in a larger gauge
3.0,"Hubo un error, se supone que sea con cremallera y es una sudadera, tiene buen material y es comodo"
3.0,These were just as described. They were good quality. An excellent price thank you.
3.0,"Ordered an XXL, fits like a L."
3.0,Next opening quite wide. Not as high of quality as I expected from pucture.
3.0,"I love a lot about it!<br />The dress is wonderful, looking great, amazing colors and comes with eyes mask and pouch - true to the real Marinette Dupain-Cheng,<br />The texture is not the most comfortable one and after several uses we stopped using it but for the few times we wanted to get into a cute custom - it was great"
3.0,"The chest area is way too tight. I’m a modest B cup and the XL squeezed the buttons open. If you have very small boobs like the model in the picture, this dress will work fine because the rest of the dress fit perfectly"
3.0,"This shirt was a lot thinner than I expected; somewhat see-through and very clingy. It's best for very slender women. I wear it as a PJ shirt, which is disappointing. The photo makes the fabric look thicker, and not see-through. It IS nice and soft for sleeping, though! :) So even though I didn't get what I'd hoped for, I like it as pajamas (though not FLATTERING pajamas for a girl with a bit of a tummy!)"
3.0,"It fits great for a shirt... This is not a dress as it is advertised, and it took a long time to receive it."
3.0,"plastic neck, ropes werent thick enough to my liking, looks cheesy and cheap in person"
3.0,"Shirt print is great, but it fits like a box."
3.0,"These earrings are a bit lighter and more of an orange tint to them than how they look in the picture. Still cute, but not the color I was expecting. Doesn't really go with any of the outifts I ordered them for. Wore them with an all black dress and recieved compliments on them."
3.0,Not dress length at all
3.0,Can't seem to find the 'medical' (blue) gloves without paying an arm and a leg for them.  I wanted to see if they would work for doing dishes because I have such dry skin.  They are not useful for doing dishes.  They are too loose.
3.0,Good value for the price. One pair had an upside-down nose piece.
3.0,"product is as expected for the price, don't expect anything too great. but I am dissapointed that the diamonds are not pink they're just clear, and the pink diamonds was the main reason I bought this item, item did come early so that was nice."
3.0,"Not very wide. Long, but not wide"
3.0,The outfit can be cute but it just wasn’t for us. I didn’t love the materials and the top was a bit too crop for my taste. I did end up returning it unfortunately.
3.0,They were scratched and the lens popped out....not all that happy. But they are pretty.
3.0,"Material very thin, legs extremely wide n just not that impressed with over all style n I luv Pallazzio Pants but these not so much"
3.0,This material was not for me. I was looking for something heavier. Its like a lining fabric. Not for me. It's not badly constructed. A shirt with a long tail looks better in a fabric with some weight and not blowing in the wind like a kite.
3.0,"Summary: if you're only a little overweight, it just doesn't make much difference.  Details:  I'm 5'11&#34;, and about 10-15 pounds overweight.  I carry most of it in my mid-section.  This tank top fit exactly as I expected, in that it's super snug, and somewhat challenging to put on and take off.  But that's how it's supposed to be.  However, it just didn't compress much.  I'm sure I got the right size, and if I were 25-30 pounds over weight, it may have made a more noticeable difference.  But at my proportions, it didn't improve much, and for that reason, made it not worth the discomfort of wearing a super tight under-shirt."
3.0,"I’m 5’10"", 155 lbs. of normal build and size “M” is usually slightly loose for me (my suit size is 38R).<br />The size “M” in this shirt is slimmer than typical size M, but fabric stretches very well and it does not feel tight at all for nice comfortable slim fit.<br />Ribbed hem at the waist adds to the slim look (will ribbed hem hold up against washings?)<br />Stripes in contrasting colors are great accent (I wished stripes continued on to the pocket).<br />The fabric was bit scratchy and itchy upon first wearing and it may be suggested to wash first before wearing.<br /><br />Few flaws detected:<br /><br />- Rough finish at the top button area<br />- Few uneven stitchings detected at inconspicuous area"
3.0,Not as comfortable as I thought it would be from the photo.
3.0,"Cute, but broke easily."
3.0,it is mad small
3.0,i expected a bigger earring this one is tiny
3.0,"The bottoms are true size, the top doesn’t really stretch, might fit better without the padding.."
3.0,"The onesies are well made using thick cotton knit fabric. However, I expected 10 different prints or styles. Instead I received 2 dublicate sets of five different types. I was using them for a clothes line for a baby shower and the dublicates looked tacky."
3.0,"Using these for my bridesmaids to get ready in. I ordered blush, but it is not at all blush. More of a pinky/coral. But they will do."
3.0,Cute and soft but the front by the arm holes cuts in pretty far so it shows your bra
3.0,"The material was a very thin, garden flag type material and it was very baggy. The color was pretty, though."
3.0,"I would have given this clothing a 4 stars for the material and the fast service. However, there is no selection of size when I tried to order. Thus, minus a star.<br />Yes, I did order blindly, and hoping they give me a ""perfect"" size. I was sent XXL size. My son who is wearing men M size, find that it is a little long but ok to wear. I suspect that the XXL is actually a Youth XXL.<br />The primary purpose of this hoodie is to add as a layer during summer in a/c classroom. I think it will serve the purpose well. The material is thin, good for exercise, but not to keep warm in winter."
3.0,the chains broke right away
3.0,Little bigger than I expected but decently good for the price
3.0,"They won’t stay in place. They slide down, they did the very 1st time I wore them and every time after that. I ordered several pairs because I liked the way the band looked but they look better than they perform."
3.0,"The material seemed thinner then what’s portrayed in the picture , shorts seem and feel less “dressy” and more .. casual.. maybe if I can find the right top, it may work out"
3.0,"Not bad but not a waw. nice style, but very thin material. it looks like it will be worn out after one wash."
3.0,"the black writing fads away, but you can still see the writing"
3.0,"This pendant is substantial and looks quite cute.  However, I got another chain to go with it since the one that came with it looks a bit cheap."
3.0,The arms are really short
3.0,Poorly made for the price. The headband is a bit small for an 8 year old and the shirt fits big for petite girls.
3.0,I wear a size 8 in everything I don't have a wide foot size 8 is my true to size fit and these shoes are tight on the top of my foot. I do not have a high arch but It definitely won't fit someone who does.
3.0,I would have gave this five stars but I got a package of 3 shirsts. 2 was perfect but the 3rd shirt was a different material which made it a different fit. It was loose fit. The tags are also different. I would love to order more but how do I know I won’t get 3 bad shirts. A little dissapointed
3.0,If you’re over 220lbs you may find this a little tight
3.0,"Loved this Key Chain, very clean and stylish look. Unfortunately the key chain fell apart after only 6 months of use. Thought Mehr had a better quality."
3.0,"Gloves are cute and kept my hands warm on the steering wheel while car was still warming up.  However, the touch tips on both gloves didn't work and I still had to remove my gloves to unlock and use my phone."
3.0,Very thin. Little tight through the chest. Otherwise comfortable.
3.0,"SUPER sheer, but pretty much as described.  Would be cute with a bralette but ultimately wasn't for me.  Length was nice, however."
3.0,This is fun...was not expecting a high end piece of jewelry. It’s stylish and nice for the price.
3.0,"The material is good quality, however the bottom area does not have snaps.  Makes it very difficult for your toddler to use the rest room."
3.0,"I don't know what I was expecting for this price but I'm disappointed nonetheless. The fabric is very lightweight- almost see-through, so it needs a slip under it. The blue in the picture looks  muted and graded in shade - not so the actual dress; baby blue from straps to hem. I mean, it's OK, I will probably wear it around the garden and to do errands, but i won't wear it &quot;out&quot; properly. Maybe it will grow on me..."
3.0,Nice jacket. Fits true to size except the mesh inside lining seems to be too snug when my son puts it in. Good quality overall.
3.0,I ordered medium size for me which fits me all time. However it turned out to be big and loose below shoulders.
3.0,The bill is longer than what I like.
3.0,"It broke at the linking bead on day 3.  The individual strands did not break, so I might be able to use it in something else."
3.0,"Pants are too small in the waistband and not much elastic stretch, did not fit. Shirt is good quality."
3.0,Runs really small. XL like a medium
3.0,"Usually, cheap sunglasses have soft lenses and decent frames; wearing them is an exercise in deciding how much blur you can stand in your field of vision before wondering if you're going diabetic. The Pro Acme flips that: the lenses are superb, but the brittle frame cracked within a month, dropping one lens out while I was walking home with my hands full of groceries — I had to walk a couple blocks with just one lens, like Momus. The matte finish already implied a hipster cool, but I'm afraid I lack the swag to pull off a one-eye modern pirate look. I'll likely try a different frame from them and give another shot — the lenses were that nice. But if you're at all hard on sunglasses (I'm not, particularly), give these a miss."
3.0,"its ok, doesnt feel as warm as i expected"
3.0,"First of all let me say that I love this swimsuit. It is very beautiful and very flattering. I think it would make many women of varying body types feel sexy and confident while wearing it.  However, the reason I am giving it 3 stars is that it is not that well made and I don't think it will last that long. The stitching near the navel, one of the few places this swimsuit is actually held together, is weak and coming apart. I can see the lining show through on my suit, so I'm going to try to fix that.  The halter tie is a white string and not multi-color as shown in the stock photo. The v-neck is sexy, but you might have to be careful to get your breasts covered because the there isn't much to cover them. It took exactly 2 weeks from the time I order this suit to get to me, which wasn't too bad. It also came with some sparkly earrings. I ordered this in a medium and I think that is a perfect fit for me. I am 5'5 and about 125lbs and small busted. A large would probably have fit, too, since as others have said, it seems to run small."
3.0,The large fits more like a size 10/12 in the waist rather than a 12/14.  Cute jeans-definitely not stretchy in any area.
3.0,would've wanted more front coverage
3.0,"This is an ok bag but not roomy like described. Cannot fit even a very slim water bottle in outer pocket. Zipper on pocket doesn't open all the way because of how it's stiched, bit that is likely only mine. Material inside is cheap and will likely rip with use. Straps look cheap. I do however like the design and that the zipper is on the back as I bought this for traveling."
3.0,This is a nice bra. The underwire doesn't drive into my sides and the lace details are pretty. The fit was as expected but after wearing it for awhile the lace began to itch around my cleavage. I returned this order because of the itching. It wasn't bad! my skin is super sensitive.
3.0,Not really good product
3.0,quality seemed great but i usually wear a XX and i ordered this in XX<br />and i could ft almost 2 of me in it.<br />i am not sure if i should by a Large or a X
3.0,"Material is very thin. However, it is a stylish jacket."
3.0,Too light weight for my needs but would be fine for someone wanting a little protection
3.0,"I like the Feetures product and didn't realize this was as low cut as it was.  Will need to purchase the next style up, but fabric and material related, top product.  Never go wrong with Feetures!"
3.0,Nice fabrics and color but a little shorter/smaller than expected. I would consider going one size up for comfort.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Basic costume jewelry, if you're expecting more you should look at getting real jewelry."
3.0,Does not really have a scrunch. Fabric is hot. My fault for thinking they were cotton and not making sure. /:
3.0,Runs large and is far more casual than the photo represents. $12 to return because it is a non-prime item. Annoyed.
3.0,I liked the watch however it came with some sort of black stain on it..I noticed it as soon as I opened the box to pull it out simply because It's all white..
3.0,Very cute but didn't fit me right… A little too loose.
3.0,Great value. On time delivery. Smaller than pictured. I bought this ring for a friend. I have been wearing it for two weeks to see if it holds up. I haven't lost any stones and the silver hasn't tarnished. I might buy one to wear myself :)
3.0,wow!!
3.0,"This scarf looks nice but it is not at all like cashmere, not one little bit.  It is scratchy, not soft."
3.0,"I oder a medium but is to big, but is really cute and anyway  i will give it to one of my cousins ."
3.0,I thought this shoe would be more soft and flexible but was not. Nice leather but not soft enough for my foot.
3.0,I liked them but not long after having them one of the bows fell off. I suppose you could glue it back on if you don’t lose it first like I did
3.0,"I think it's somewhat overrated, it feels like just any other sports bra. I wish the shoulder part was thinner as the straps show when wearing only with a tank-top. Also the pads move around even when washed in a lingerie bag. Also the colors are lame."
3.0,Half size too small.  Chains break off easily but if your handy hot glue holds them in place. I didn't want to get embarrassed again so I glued them so it wouldn't happen. I have two pairs. Many compliments I get with them. They are comfortable
3.0,Earnings did not match necklace they were a different color
3.0,Very cute but too small and no stretch.
3.0,This dress is fine but the fabric is very thin. It’s neither good nor bad just very…average.<br /><br />I don’t expect that it’ll last me for years and years but maybe that’s okay. I’ll wear it in the summer heat but I probably won’t wear it as a work dress
3.0,Look very close at the design. There are definitely designs of what looks like swastikas. Rows and rows. I thought I could overlook them as designs but I can’t. I will probably be burning the socks.
3.0,They are cute but so small. The way they are made makes it hard to see that they are skulls.
3.0,"Well...I ordered this because I loved the print so much.  And I still love the print - great colors and they match the colors on my bike (OCD brain!!) and that's so important, right?!<br /><br />Fit - probably fits the way it's supposed to.  I wear a large in Pearl Izumi and I ordered a large.  I like to wear my jerseys a tad larger than needed.  This jersey seems shorter and a little tighter than my other jerseys.  I am long waist'ed and this one will show my belly button if I raise my arms straight up.  The elastic around the arms is really tight...like blood draw elastic kind of tight.  I can probably stretch those out a bit.  It does have a good grip on the bottom hem so it will likely stay in place.  Again, it's probably my preference to wear a jersey that's a little longer and looser as I am a little fatter than I should be!<br /><br />What is really bothering me about this and it's sooo dumb is that the writing on the side panels reads ""I love bike"".  I love bike???  That is so grammatically incorrect and it will bother me to no end!  The script is not terribly noticeable because it's white and on the side panel but I know it's there.  I guess I will just have to ride really fast everywhere I go so no one can read ""I love bike""!  haha!  Can't it read I love MY bike or I love biking?  There is enough room for that...This is really going to bother me.<br /><br />Overall for the price, it's a great jersey and I will keep it.  If had paid more for it I would likely return it.  Fabric and construction seem to be quality.  Maybe the smaller fit will encourage me to lose 10 (or 20) more pounds...that would make a big difference.  But then, I would just have to order more jerseys!  :)"
3.0,"Very cute but the skirt was thick material and a bit stiff, fit too small for this US size 6 gal, returned."
3.0,"The model must be pretty small and ordered a larger size. I ordered my normal size and it’s shorter, the cutoyt in the back is smaller, and I have to shove my boobs in from the top. I wear a medium of large in sports bras; am a 36 D or bigger; and I’m 5’o” 155 lbs. it’s too much of a hassle to return just one item so I’m keeping it. But if I’m doing any other returns in the next couple weeks, it’s going. I’m glad I got it on sale but just know the models are small cuz these look longer and bigger on them. That being said - it is otherwise comfortable  and seems well made. Just not flattering visually."
3.0,wнaт ι eхpecтed. noтнιng pнenoмenal. a ĸeychain
3.0,Size up or 2!
3.0,lost color...six months....
3.0,Rope ends keep coming untied. It bled black and brown when barley got wet from washing hands so had to take off and let dry if not its dyed my arm.
3.0,I typically where a medium but it said size large for 10-12 so I ordered the large. It was too big and way too long. I’m 5’4 btw and it came between my knees and ankle.
3.0,True to size and cute top. It’s worth purchasing!
3.0,My husband loves it. The band that holds the beverage needs to be a bit more sturdy in my opinion.
3.0,great quality and material but it did not fit. needed to order 2 or 3 sizes bigger than my normal size
3.0,"I was expecting the dress to be off the shoulder like in the picture but, it wasn't at all. It looks better online than in person. I ended up returning it."
3.0,"Alas, this dress is made with the Homeyee thin polyester fabric instead of the thick cotton-blend fabric. Yes, I did read the description; but though a floaty party dress would be better in the thinner fabric.  NOPE.  It still looks cheap.<br />I did like the design of the sleeves and think it would have actually been better executed in the thicker fabric."
3.0,decent quality for the price. def makes me sweat. size chart is off. ran very small. order a size or two up.
3.0,"The bracelet was very inexpensive, but I am all thumbs at trying to get it on correctly, so never wear it."
3.0,I wear a 10wide in loafers but this pair of 10w did not fit as they should.  The toe box is too tight and the shoe is overall just uncomfortable.  The quality is good just wish they fit better.  I will be returning them.  :-(
3.0,That you don’t offer your funny sayings t shirts in 3 XL
3.0,Band looks awesome and is very easy to install in your watch!!! But fits tighter than others in your wrist!!! Take note!!!
3.0,Not awful. It fits but definitely see through. A different color could do better. Also shorter than expected but it fits with the style.
3.0,These earrings are small. But they are cute. My only issue with these is i have one earring that wont stay clasped
3.0,"I was looking for a metallic, slightly pink sandal, and thought that ""Rose Gold"" would fit the bill. Unless I was shipped the wrong color; this is most definitely bronze in tone. I will be sending them back."
3.0,Nice overall
3.0,Looked too much like a plain tennis dress.
3.0,"Not quite as pictured. The writing isn't faded & the shirt is black, not charcoal. Fits funny too."
3.0,I have to protect my skin from sun exposure due to lupus.  I got these to use when I cut grass because I can't find a sun protection long sleeve shirt in my size.  These are fairly comfortable but keep falling down from my upper arm. Had to make do so I use a rubber band or scrunchie at my elbow to keep in place.  Not great because it can bind too much but works ok.
3.0,"The material was like a tablecloth, no stretch. The colors were brighter than expected and it was very tight across my chest. I ordered an XL, as I am a 12/14 and my bra is a 40C. I fit well into it except for across the chest. The rest of it was rather baggy and since the material was so weird I sent it back."
3.0,The dress is actually very pretty it fit perfect especially I’m very curvy.... but didn’t keep the dress because of how the bottom is.  It’s loose and it looks weird but the dress was cute
3.0,"May was little defective, ripped off too fast"
3.0,"I wear a nine shoe and ordered an 8 /12 and they fit fine. Only problem is that the strap is definitely too short and the velcro keeps letting go because the strap is not gripping fully. I had to cut the straps off and hand sew an inch long black strip of elastic to each shoe and then reattach the straps. Seems to do the trick but I would not have purchased had I known this from the beginning. If you have a low arch and are a thin person, you might not have to resort to this."
3.0,Really cute pants i got them today and fits good. But when i put mines on i realized they had a hole in them and easy fix
3.0,This suit is of average quality but works for the price and occasion.  The pants are too big and don't have a belt loop so you can not use a belt with them.
3.0,"My son is 16months old and wears 18months. We bought tag 110 (said it would fit 24mos). The torso section is extremely short and the legs are very long. Also, the sleeves are way shorter in person then in the picture. This size looks like it would be made for 12 months. SIZE UP would be my recommendation if you are looking to buy."
3.0,Adorable blouse but kind of costume like material. Still wear it though.
3.0,Soooo cute. Just disappointed it broke. See pictures
3.0,"My husband is a mechanic and wears this ring to work. When we first got it, he loved it. However, after wearing for a few weeks, it stretched and did not fit his finger as well. He had to put silicone on the inside of it to fit him correctly again. We both really like the looks of it and the little tree on it."
3.0,"When it comes to clothes, I think I will stick to cotton or some sort of fabric. These shorts are advertised as quick dry which means the material absorbs little to no water when splash. However, it also means the material doesn't feel soft like cotton or fabric. It feels a bit like plastic to me. Stylistically, it is ok but I do wish it had cargo pockets. As is, it only has front hand pockets and no back pockets. Just not kind of thing."
3.0,NOT REALLY A DRESS
3.0,it fits small if you order go up a size
3.0,"Honestly, I'm disappointed. I took my measurements and ordered according to their size chart and suggested guidelines and it was still too small. Especially in the chest are which wouldn't have been a problem if there weren't buttons. Buttons and boobs have a tenuous relationship at best."
3.0,This is really pretty but arrived with a stone missing
3.0,I love it! But it's really see through material 😫
3.0,"It is a really cute versatile dress and the midi length makes it a bit different but I had problems with sizing.<br /><br />Originally ordered a small, which was about a size too big.  Went back for XS which was bigger than the small.  I'm going to give up at this point.  But if you are willing to fiddle around until you get the right size it is a really cute dress."
3.0,Doesn't sparkle as much as it thought it would and tangles quite a bit.
3.0,"I really liked this hat, but it was definitely not &#34;oversize&#34;. The fit was pretty small so I had to return it."
3.0,"I bought these for a cat costume for my daughter. I should have read the description better, because I was surprised to find that the velvet is on the inside (three stars vice five for that). The outside is just a glossy synthetic spandex. Despite that, she likes them a lot and they've been good for winter school pants. Other than ripping the seat when she scooted across a wooden floor and caught a splinter (repairable, luckily), these have held up well to a year of washings and kid-wear."
3.0,"I didn't wear these in my tragus yet, so I don't know if my ears are going to be sensitive to them or not, but what I did notice, when I opened the package, is how exceptionally SMALL these were, compared to what was pictured.  I expected the circle to be larger."
3.0,I was disappointed it isn’t a cotton feel. Slick and polyester feeling.
3.0,"The books by Discovery, I had ordered the ones with sounds with the animals and trucks, they are not very realistic and the a lot of them sound the same, coat I ordered was not the best"
3.0,"I am a larger guy (6'5'') but my hands are relatively small for my size. I had to extend the band as far as it could go to barely get it over my hand, so getting it off and can be a bit annoying, and while it does fit my wrist and is comfortable, the width of the band is also small. The size does make it look and feel like a women's band. A longer wider band would definitely make this a 5 start item."
3.0,"Fits a little weird in chest area, a litrle scratchy"
3.0,"Nice print, though the material is a little thin. The biggest disappointment is that it is not the tailored/fitted look like in the photo, but more of a straight, almost baggy fit.  I wear my shirts untucked and fitted/tight, so I might have to alter it."
3.0,"Not as fluffy, and was to large for my Toddler."
3.0,The black on the watch has started to peel/fade off.
3.0,"The holes for the sunglasses frames were very small. I tried the ""pencil method"" to open the hole up a little more but could only get them partially on the frames. They look good other than the fact that they don't fit lol"
3.0,only received one  pouch the advertisement said 2... blue and purple.
3.0,"Not properly sized, my pants are size 38 waist so ordered xxl and they way too small."
3.0,"Beads are a bit small.  Also, while the elastic makes it nice to wrap your wrist, it makes it harder to move from bead to bead during meditation (at least for me).  However, for the price I can't complain."
3.0,I've only had the ring for 3 days and the black top coat is flaking off some. I got the ring for a costume so it works.
3.0,The style and color are very attractive but I'm not crazy about the material.
3.0,The pendant is really nice and good quality. However the necklace is very cheap and broke the first time I wore it.
3.0,Worked well for my 10 year old not my 5 year old. Not really good for young kids
3.0,took a long time to get and was thin.
3.0,"Comfortable, but too large."
3.0,Loved everything about the shirts but didn't last.
3.0,Definitely it’s light weight.
3.0,At least two sizes smaller than ordered.
3.0,Hat is great I love it. 3 stars only because it arrived late. But supplier did respond fast to email.
3.0,"If you find this review to be helpful, please click ""helpful"" on the bottom.<br /><br />It's not a bad dress. But for the price, there are better dresses out there.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this dress is that the material is very scratchy. I'm 5'8, 150lbs 38DD and instead of being flattering, this dress will make you look somewhat pregnant.<br /><br />The print from far looks great, but close up, looks cheat and really bad."
3.0,"They are squat proof, thick fabric,  I liked the way they fit and hug my body at 1st, but they stretched out. The grey one on the top is brand new and has never been used and the one at the bottom(Marl blue) was literally used 2 times during outdoor WALK. I don't expect this out of a $29 legging."
3.0,Material feels cheap.  Length isnt great.  Collar is really cute.  I will return it.
3.0,I was looking for a sports bra with a little length. This was too tight. I’m 36B and bought size large.
3.0,This runs small. It is still cute and looks good over a tank top.
3.0,horrible zipper and very inexpensive quality material. I bought a large and im 5'5 180 pounds and its huge. The arms are so huge it makes you look really fat
3.0,Not my fav at all. Super skimpy cheap materials.
3.0,"I love the shape of this shoulder pad. I am petite and it is natural looking. Unfortuately, the straps came off fairly early while putting them on. For this reason, I would not purchase again"
3.0,"Despite older reviews saying and showing pink ladies on the back, this item actually says Pink Lady as purchased Oct 2021.  Be aware, however all other aspects are good.  Would have liked it to be cheaper for the quality, but overall ok."
3.0,"The bird is sort of , kinda , like a hummingbird but you'll need 20/20 vision to see it. More like a humming mosquito.<br />The back is actually the better looking side.<br />I went ahead and gave it as a Mother's Day gift cuz there was no time to return it but I went out and bought something nicer anyway."
3.0,They run small and feel too heavy on your feet. They look cute on however.
3.0,Too small and heavy for normal ears.
3.0,"One edge of the band is pretty rough.  Some of the stitching on the inside is not great and required a bit of trimming to make comfortable against my skin.  My main complaint though is that the included pins were the wrong size.  If you look at the photo I uploaded you can see one of the pins sitting on top of the band, they are the same size, that's not going to work!  Luckily I could just use the pins that were already in my watch but I did buy this band specifically to have a back up set.  On the positive side this band does include a pin removal tool which is quite well made and works great."
3.0,They are comfortable and stretched great but they are very thin.
3.0,"Pretty print, but not enough fabric."
3.0,Just a little tight if you're curvy on the bottom.
3.0,I ordered this twice because the first one was too tight. The second one was also a bit snug
3.0,Earrings keep falling out of my ears.
3.0,Seemed pretty cheap and didn’t fit flat on my head at all. Lots of lumps so it would have been uncomfortable under a helmet. I have a fairly big head (7 1/2 or 7 3/8 size hat) so you’d have to have a larger head to fit right. Retuned for something name brand.
3.0,The length is a bit too long for me with flats and the material is a bit too thin.
3.0,The colors of the bands were not the same as the picture. They were darker and brighter. I would have preferred the lighter colors shown.
3.0,"This top is not made for fluffy girls. It puts on display ever lump, bump and curve.  The fit is close even if you buy 2x.  It will fit,yes, but not in the relaxed way.  I love the material. I just don't love showing my extra curves."
3.0,"This belt and buckle look good, and fits as expected. The brown has a mild, deep-red undertone, a little like chestnut. After wearing it about a dozen times it is taking a 'set' where it's buckled, but seems to be holding up okay.<br />It doesn’t feel like leather. It is very hard, not supple at all and it is slippery. It feels like you’re putting on a plastic belt rather than leather. Other than lacking the feel of genuine leather, the belt works well."
3.0,Not sure if it's to big? It keeps unsnapping on the the top 3 snaps?
3.0,Alot were broken or already falling apart.
3.0,"Cool looking shirt but this is not a slim fit.  There is a ton of extra fabric in the back which flares out at various angles to make you look heavier.  This shirt immediately started fraying at the seams (collar, buttons, and cuffs) after washing it once like I do with all of my other shirts."
3.0,It fit well. Was hopping in would be a bit firmer in waist training
3.0,The insoles that came with the product was too rigid for me. I replaced them with Dr. Schools. The soles are also hard rubber--heavy and rigid.
3.0,"They fit just a tad bit too big, but my main issue is the material. My son has worn them for only three months as it's a requirement for his uniform and I already need to buy some new ones. The front of these shoes look terrible."
3.0,Very disappointed that for a 40 buck charm it comes in a ziplock bag instead of a tiny bolenvi box as shown in picture. Bought to be a gift so First impression not impressionable at all.
3.0,I was wearing a white shirt and noticed that the black dye from the bracelet was staining the sleeve. This was disappointing due to the fact I was hoping to wear the bracelet all the time and now that won't be possible. I like the look of the product despite this flaw.
3.0,The material does not &#34;give&#34; well so its an awkward fit
3.0,"Great idea, nice concept, works as designed most of the time. Wish it zipped up closed."
3.0,"This is a cute bathing suit, the idea at least, but the top does not fit me as pictured. It doesn't give me as much coverage as the triangle top pictured. Still it is really cute and I am still going to wear it. Maybe I will just pair it with another triangle top."
3.0,"As other reviewers stated, the leg holes were way too small for me. It was almost a hit."
3.0,Whish it was a little longer and lettering brighter for the price but I do still like to to
3.0,"Good fabric, not pilly, but started slipping down 60 seconds into my bollywood cardio class. It went downhill from there. So tight and long in the legs, but way too stretchy and big in the waist and hips."
3.0,"The top is fine and looks really good, but the bottom is really baggy."
3.0,Still too hot. Went back to thin cotton socks for less money too.
3.0,Collar started fraying after the 1st wash. Fit good but very short for this style shirt.
3.0,The garnet color is very dark but it does have a good sparkle.  For the price it is alright.  The setting are cheap and bend and break easily.
3.0,"I like the simple style. But the quality is not so good. I wear it just two times, the needle work on the waist is broken. I need to fix it by myself."
3.0,"Warm, but not even close to knee hi's."
3.0,"They are the right size I was searching for, they are one-sided yet adequate.<br />Cotton is good."
3.0,"I was super excited to order these. I like the concept, but they are not comfortable to wear. I haven't worn mine once since I got it. Neat idea, but not worth it. Don't waste your time."
3.0,"I wish this came true to deep maroon, it was too bright for my taste."
3.0,They seem to fall out very easily
3.0,"I bought these for my 6 year old, and they were way too small.  She is a petite 6 year old too.  I hated to return them because I thought the quality was pretty good and they were very pretty."
3.0,"Bought this in a medium (I should have gotten a large), it for as expected for someone who has a 34 chest or small. (Definitely not me). The material is now stretchy."
3.0,"This was too small even after ordering a size up. I could get it on, but didn't have enough room to move my arms. This dress looks like it is good quality and would be cute if sizing were appropriate. Nice thick material"
3.0,"This top is about two sizes smaller than the XXL I always wear. I love the top but if you order it, I would recommend ordering about two sizes larger than you would normally."
3.0,"Queda un poco ajustado, pero pese a eso me gusto."
3.0,there are really cute but the sole of the shoe is off-white/yellowed while the white buckle is much nicer bright white. it just seems like the shoe was sitting around for decades and the sole got yellow with age. such a shame
3.0,"While I like the number of zippers and compartments of this purse, the outer material seems to be vinyl, not the lambskin it was claimed to be at least at the time of my purchase.  It already has a V-shaped tear in a small spot on the front of the purse.  I was able to use glue to tack the material back down so I can use the purse longer, but that shouldn't have happened.  One of the zippers is difficult to maneuver around the curved edge.  I haven't yet taken the time to tack down the inside of the seam with some thread, which should ease the issue.  Otherwise, I like the purse and really wish it had a leather exterior as claimed.<br /><br />A funny aspect is that one of my cats thinks it's her lover and rubs her body all over the purse when she can get to it.  It must smell good to her."
3.0,hard to slide in stem...... would have preferred different way to attach.....but still nice
3.0,"i thought maybe get a large bc im a medium but nooo dont do that order your exact size, bc the large is now way to baggy for me. ill still make it work but honestly its not the look i wanted also theres like a hidden zipper on the side which i didnt know i wish i did bc when i went to put it on over my thighs it broke, i fixed it but still be aware!"
3.0,"It's ok&#34; not very thick , but overall nice ring"
3.0,I love the necklace.  I just didn't like that the stones were so small.  Smaller than image.
3.0,short and wide
3.0,Kept unzipping.  It is comfortable.  Fabric soft.  Size fits.
3.0,"i have to give it a three I sent this to my sister, she liked the necklace but says that she had trouble reading what it says which is very disappointing  so this is coming from her point of view :("
3.0,My son wears size 30 in the waist so I got these in 30 but they won’t even button. They were at least an inch too small. But my son liked them and I want to exchange them for a larger size but am only given the option of returning for a refund.
3.0,"When I recieved the watch in mail it was broken,with the crown loose in the box.felt cheap.was not ticking.felt let down.i contacted amazon for replacement and did recieve a replacement that as of date is still ticking and together.comes in nice packaging.for the price it's alright,you get what you pay for.i give 3 stars for the fact second one is surprisingly still ticking.wouldnt reccomend."
3.0,"LOVE THE COLOR, but too big, reordered a medium"
3.0,"I like the design, but the way it's cut makes it bulge out in the middle, making me look bigger than I really am. Otherwise I really like it."
3.0,Good value but cut small.  Feels like silk and grandson LOVES the way they feel.  Just wish they were true to size.
3.0,"Nice watch! I like the fit & finish of the watch. The problem I had was, after I received the watch I had to go have a new battery put in because the one it came with was dead. $7 later I'm now a happy camper."
3.0,"Did nothing for me, sent back.  Great Customer Servive!"
3.0,"Cute dress but a little thinner than I expected. Also, I suggest sizing up. This has zero stretch."
3.0,I like the dress but the color was not as depicted. It was darker.
3.0,"They are very tough to get in because the screw-on head, or gem, is tiny.  Also, they tend to catch on clothing and towels.  But they look pretty and don't irritate my ears, so that's a plus!"
3.0,"The picture doesn't really show that this is a HUGE handbag - I am knda small, so I use this more as a satchel than a purse. But I still like the look and the material"
3.0,"Oh how I wish this dress fit. The halter is a bit long so the dress hung a bit low and my bra was exposed. Also, the dress was a little short, right above the knee and I wish it was right below the knee. It was also too big in the chest/back...it needed to be taken in at the zipper or on the sides under the arms. While I can sew and could have fixed 2 of the 3 issues, I'm so tired of fixing clothes to fit me right. If the dress were a little longer, then I would have just washed and dried it, it might have fit perfect then.  I'm so disappointed."
3.0,"I like the style. But it seems the top is flat and short, considering the size of the bottom, which is really big and full. The top should be longer. The top is too up and makes the dress look odd. Then the zipper, though on the right side under the armpit, it gets stuck."
3.0,It was more maroon than red. Not the same color in picture. Fabric is thin. Very cute image on the shirt though.
3.0,"Its nice, but smaller on my wrist than i expected it to be. Fits tightly (i do have larger wrists) but i expected it to wear more like a bangle, not the case. Have only worn it a few times but the silver is rubbing off on the inside of the bracelet. Great for wearing every once in a while, not really a daily use bracelet."
3.0,Got for my friend. Ordered an XL when he’s usually a medium/large in mens but he likes the size- not too oversized though. Love the quality of the image on the material. It is much thinner than expected but I also didn’t check the material type haha. It’s still cool. Feels slick. Overall fun hoodie but just not for cold weather. I do enjoy it.
3.0,Good product at a good price but I really wish the sizes would have been separated out and labelled rather than just all thrown in one bag together....
3.0,"Did,t cost much, but I still hoped for a better quality.  I returned it."
3.0,Its okay.  No real complaints
3.0,I don't think the craftsmanship was as nice as pictured and the socks were way too large for me. I wear a women's size 7/8 so if your feet are that size or smaller you may get socks that are too large for you...
3.0,"These definitely run smaller than most Frye boots. They are also so oddly shaped. While the shaft part fit, the the boot opening tapered back in and dug into my calves. Why would they make the boot opening so small?? If you have 13” calves I guess they would work."
3.0,"It's very nice ,material is great but bigger then I though ."
3.0,I'm tall so I could have used a size larger.  It hit me too short.  Otherwise a very cute suit.
3.0,"These are beautiful gauges, great if you're into the whole look without stretching your actual ear. The only downside to these is they are really slippery and really hard to put in. I almost wish they had a ball screw on the back instead of the flat piece. The other downside is normal wear causes them to unscrew sometimes and mine popped out just as I leaned over across our dining room table. Other than those two things, I really like these gauges and wear them frequently. I did realize I didn't need such a big set though as I only wear two out of it. Oh well! I have them if I want them."
3.0,It was just too thin and clingy.  Just wasn't flattering on me.
3.0,Everything else about it is good.
3.0,Fabric was thinner than in picture.
3.0,"I purchased this black coat in Dec. 2019 Now it's January 16, 2020 and already the coat is tearing up.... I'm still waiting for my blue Coat to come as well...  Don't get me wrong I love the way the coat looks but the company who made this coat. They have to  double Stitch the coat so it will not fall apart so soon...."
3.0,Shirt looks really small I ordered a extra large and it fit
3.0,If you want a loose fit like pictured go up a size
3.0,"I am a bit disappointed because it is a thin silky material (like a bathing suit type), the color is not Animal Crossing teal/blue green, it is more of a green shade, but the pink is true to its color, and as what other reviews have said, it is a bit loose/baggy. The leaves are printed nicely and the seams are sewn beautifully tho, just not the material I was looking for in a mask."
3.0,"I can't say for sure that it wasn't just the pair that I receive, but this pair fell apart really fast. They came loose at the nose joint. We didn't do anything weird with them, but they broke after just a few weeks."
3.0,Tops are long enough- I have a longer torso. I knew going into this purchase by reading the reviews that I might not be happy with how thin they are. The reviews were true. They are thin. I'm just not comfortable wearing them without an over shirt since I'm uncomfortable with my skin showing through. But if you are wearing them as strictly an under shirt and just want the lace to show- they work fine.
3.0,no support  for small women only
3.0,"I just got these and the material is very nice, they're well padded and seem to be very sturdy. However, as some other have said, these are incredibly narrow. I was pretty surprised, since while I'm a 12, my feet are pretty narrow and still I feel my feet overlapping the actual edges of the bottom of the slippers. It's a little weird feeling. I'll stick it out, but the complaint is definitely true. I have two other pairs of 20 dollar slippers and these are about an inch thinner. Very weird design choice. I would not buy these if I had tried them on beforehand, but oh well."
3.0,Very thin material.  Hope they last awhile
3.0,These started turning strange color after my wife wore them a few times. This is not to say that I haven't bought great products from this dealership before and still am a customer.
3.0,"Hats are fine,  but they are not reflecting as the image shows. They literally only have a silver in color pin strip around the cap. A little disappointing."
3.0,It's ok for a cheap watch.  Crystal face just cracked one day without impact...  you get what you paid for.
3.0,These form a watertight seal and are easy to adjust. They also have a clip in the back to make it easier to take off. However the lenses scratch easy.
3.0,Very cute dress but v Neck does not cover well. Needs to be sewn together or something to cover properly. Spent the entire time making sure I was covered
3.0,"The quality of the fabric on this tunic hoodie is quite nice, but sadly the sizing is waaay smaller than expected. I bought this in 2x for me for a Halloween costume, and it fits my 11 year old daughter, not me. I would say this was two sizes smaller than advertised. b"
3.0,"Watch looks great, but the buttons on the side had a coating that scratches right off.  It doesn't look like you can keep the backlight lit up if you want either.  Overall, not bad for the price!  Looks like a very manly watch and my Marine should love it."
3.0,"This just came in today and I love the material. It definitely has a unique look to it.<br />However, the waist band is really tight and gives me a bad muffin top. I’m normally a medium/large. This would only be flattering on a small individual."
3.0,"The picture on the back is huge and if I had seen it, I wouldn't have bought this (just my personal preference)"
3.0,"Watch looks pretty good in person.  Pretty huge (iI isn't realize how big thewhole watch was until I saw it in person). Even the band is thick-- huge. I love the fact the band is leather.  I got it for my father yesterday 10/27- Birthday, & he loved it !  & that's what matters :)"
3.0,"I am re writing my review in these. I loved them, until the left heel collapsed within 3 days. I didnt want to return them because I need them for work but the squeaking became so loud I couldn't walk on my left heel. So I returned them and got another. Let's hope these stay working."
3.0,"Cute for one or two accation,one if the ankle bracelets broke before I put it on,It looks kinda like real gold, just not close up:/"
3.0,"This dress is cute....<br />Definitely not the one shown on the model but a nice replica...<br />The real dress would no doubt cost more money. I haven't worn it yet, but with a little accessories and I'll make it work. I wear a large but bought a medium. I'm 5'2"" and over 160 ....its down to my ankles with my 3 inch wedge heels on.<br />Not too shabby. :-)"
3.0,"Love the thickness and color of this wrap.  The advertising of this wrap was false.  It is much smaller than stated.  If you need the size stated, order something else."
3.0,While I love this shirt it does run small so order up a size .
3.0,was bigger than I expected.
3.0,"I knew this was short based on the reviews, but I bought this for my 11 year old daughter who is about 4'9"".  I thought it would be ok for her, but no way.  It was insanely short even on her, although the sleeves did completely cover her hands.  It's really cute, but believe the reviews that this is butt-skimmingly short."
3.0,"This is a decent hydration vest. It is super lightweight, and pretty comfortable (have only tested it on a 5 mile run so far, so not sure how it will hold up at higher mileage). The pockets in the front definitely won’t fit a phone, so I ended up storing mine in the back which makes it really hard to access if I would need it. Drinking from the bottles is a little challenging, and you have to have the in the vest when you fill them up. Really the biggest problem I have with it is that the valve on one of my bottles doesn’t work at all (the other one works great)."
3.0,Nice gloves. Not easy to use phone with. Fingertips are too long on shorter fingers but just right on middle finger with normal hands.
3.0,"A bit small...will find someone who can wear them, just not the person intended!!!!!"
3.0,The pants fit me nicely and are very nice. The top was too tight for me. Definitely should’ve ordered a size up.
3.0,"The fit is just fine, but the quality of the fabric is not the best. As others have stated the background pattern isn't 100% as shown in the picture and the material is practically see-through. It will require a tank or another shirt to be worn under it. Also, the material of the sleeves and neck-line are more like that of a cheap work-out shirt than a casual t-shirt. Luckily, I planned to wear this with my work-out leggings so for me this isn't too big of a deal, but for someone wanting a super comfy t-shirt feel, this is not it."
3.0,"they are ok, but way too big. I'm 7. Had to return it"
3.0,"The boots are cute but they really need lots more inner cushioning. The outer shoe is soft and moves easily, the insole is hard to stand on or walk in for a period of time."
3.0,The leather started peeling within two weeks. I don’t handle my keys daily either with remote start/entry. The other one was on a spare set and it ripped from being pushed in my purse. They’re cute but that’s it.
3.0,Nice dress but it runs way too small. Size chart is off.
3.0,"This fits my almost 3 year old great, but the only reason I bought it was because of the bright green head covering. When I opened the package, the whole thing is dark blue with the dino design around the lower portion. I wanted something that would help my kid to stand out when he's playing outside so I can spot him easier, or so others see him when we're at the park playing disc golf.  Seems more of a hassle to return it since it's not part of prime. At least it seems like it will protect him from the cold weather."
3.0,This tallit serves my purpose. I use it only in the privacy of my home. It's okay for the price.
3.0,"This dress would be lovely on an hourglass or pear shape. It fit too tight on my apple shape. Beautiful dress, gorgeous in blue. Couldn't keep it because it just didn't look nice on me."
3.0,"This is really cute. The only problem I have is the chain from the heart to the key is too long, it's about 2 - 2 1/2 long."
3.0,They are super cute but they arrived with one black flower missing on one of the ears which was a little disappointing.
3.0,You get what you pay for so not the highest quality but perfect for my crystal confetti
3.0,"Very cute necklace, but smaller than I had expected it to be. Would have been nice if it were a bit larger than the matching earrings."
3.0,"I love the color, the ease of getting it on and off, the fact that I can make it as tight or loose as I want it... but the edges snag my clothes.  :("
3.0,simple buy very pretty.
3.0,Fit ok but looks a lil cheap
3.0,You can tell they are a one-and-done item meaning they won't make it to another winter
3.0,"I ordered a 2xl because I heard they run small, when I tried it on the sleeves were long enough but the shirt it self was tight at the chest.  The pockets are very small."
3.0,"I kept the purse and am basically satisfied with it.  Luckily, I was able to use a web strap from another bag to be able to wear as a shoulder bag.  The strap that came with it was unacceptable.  It was ugly, cheap plastic and my husband and I couldn't configure it to make into a shoulder strap.  The description was a little off on this product, but the price and size were right.  It is a sturdy, roomy bag."
3.0,"I like them, but I ordered my regular size and they were tight. I suggest ordering one size up."
3.0,"Not as expected,  I donated it."
3.0,Decent quality but I would expect much better for 24$
3.0,Runs Larger
3.0,Until last night this would have gotten a 5+ until the wrist strap fell apart and the purse almost got lost.<br />When the purse came it had a bad smell but that dissipated in a few days and is totally not a problem. I love the roomy interior and it is (was) perfect for carrying on my wrist when shopping. I really enjoyed it. But now I am so disappointed. I guess I will have to purchase some type of replacement strap but that is an additional expense and it also won't match.<br />I am still giving it a 3 because the purse is so nice - just no longer serves the purpose I bought for.
3.0,"It’s a cute necklace, pretty stone.  Kinda small and I don’t feel any energy from it."
3.0,I wanted to love this dress but the slits on the side were too high and rolled inward. I tried to steal it but it didn’t help. Ultimately I returned it.
3.0,"I used this for a Halloween costume. Looked great, but began falling apart just walking around. Black feathers were coming off it all night."
3.0,"At 5'8"" this dress hits me at mid-thigh which is short enough for me to take this one out of the dress range and put it into the category of a long shirt.  The fabric is a little itchy and the fit is loose, but overall it's a nice shirt to wear with leggings or skinny jeans as it definitely covers my butt as long as I don't bend over.  After washing it the collar and hem need to be ironed which I don't like at all so probably won't be wearing it to often."
3.0,"Buckles are more of a gold color, got them for my daughter for Christmas so not sure how they fit yet, but they are cute. Arrived faster than expected. So very fast shipping!!!"
3.0,"Fits however, large cup sizes will droop before long"
3.0,"Beautiful jumpsuit, very heavy and well made but some of the beads were missing when I received the item. When I tried it on beads fell off as well. I contacted them and they shipped me replacement beads. Also I'm an XS and the legs are very loose."
3.0,"Not cotton, super small size up one or two sizes! I had to return it!"
3.0,"I got the small and because it runs somewhat small it fit well. I usually wear an XS so I wouldn't have ordered it except that other reviews noted it as running small and it worked in my favor. Unfortunately, there were a few things I didn't like so I ended up returning it anyway. For one thing, the drawstring is an incredibly cheap nylon cord like a fat shoelace. The most irritating design flaw, however, was the &#34;adjustable&#34; sleeve cuff. There are two buttons so that you can tighten the sleeves against your wrist, presumably to help prevent rain from getting in. The buttons are placed right next to each other so you don't have a lot of range to adjust. The strap used to wrap around your wrist is so long that even after adjusting to the tightest setting (the furthest button), there was still room for almost a second wrist! One of the things I did like about this coat was the hood. It's a nice oversized hood with a sort of bill cap that helps keep rain off your face. This also cuts off a great deal of your peripheral vision but you can fold the cap backward if it's not raining much or you want to see better. All in all this would be a fine coat to leave in your car for emergencies but I was looking for something a little nicer."
3.0,The dress is ok but too large
3.0,"Extremely hot, I'm not kidding. The is good for camping in winter"
3.0,"I purchased this dress in the orange color seen online. The color and shape of the dress are nice. However, the material is very thin and it came with a hole in the armpit. I did receive many compliments wearing the dress. The material had a lot of static and stuck to me in some place. Overall, it is pretty, but uncomfortable to wear to work."
3.0,"Loses spring quickly, and the large opening on the inside allows smaller things to fall off."
3.0,"I did not have any surgery, but wanted a slimmer figure shape.  This faja was good.  I had problems with my bra working with it.  For some reason my underwire bra and the faja would not work and it made my boobs look weird with clothes on.  Almost bulky.  Perhaps if I wore a bra with no wire, it may have worked better, but I don't wear those types of bras.  I also did not like the zipper function.  On hot days, it was very uncomfortable and made things a little more moist 'down there'."
3.0,Work for the three piercings in my ears but even the 8mm was ridiculously huge for my nose which is the main reason i bought them.
3.0,These are cheaply made. The material is VERY thin cotton/polyester jersey (like your worst T-shirt). There is no hem. The scarf is too short.
3.0,"I have a few other Not Rated ankle boots and these are also nice and fitting around the foot and ankle. However, this shoe is too bulky and loose around the calves and mine are not the slimmest."
3.0,Good style and fit. I wear a 4/6 and the Small fits perfectly. The fabric however is rough and not the soft flannel I was expecting. I didn't notice this until I washed the robe. I would not buy again because of this.
3.0,Love the belt but way to long
3.0,"I loved the feel of the dress, very light weight material, which is what I was looking for to take to Italy in July which is so hot in July. The lower end of dress is lined, it is 100% cotton,  which means 100% guarantee it will shrink when washed.  I bought the dress knowing of this, but I would have had it dry cleaned.  I will have to send back because the dress runs small. I had read the reviews which some stated a 150 woman could wear it comfortably.  I am 145 pounds 5'1"", and bust is 36 C,  Yes I  am short woman, this is the reason I bought a mini dress.  The dress goes to the top of my knee . The zipper went up with a little tension. The zipper is long and strong. No loose strings. Very sad I have to send back but I will order the extra large. The empire waist on a young woman is fine but not a 60 year woman, made the appearance of the dress more tighter on . I knew it had an empire waist, but because of being too tight made my stomach appear pregnant. I will reorder a larger size and then update my review."
3.0,"I am 165 lbs with 38 DDD. Pretty curvy. I ordered the XXL and it fits me on point. I actually really like the shirt, it is much nicer in person. The neckline is lined with pearls and the sleeves has a nice print on it. But, the reason I gave it 3 starts is because it is very cheap. I paid 3.99 with 1.99 shipping and it took a month to get here. Above the breast line is very thin material, it was ripped before my first wear, but the shirt doesn't even need it, I don't know why they would add something that just brings the quality down. That is the only real complaint other than how long will the shirt last. I bet I can get a few good wears out of it. I would def paid more money for a better quality shirt, very cute."
3.0,"Hat fits the baby, scarf is too small in length"
3.0,Cheap quality but that’s what you get for something that cheap I suppose
3.0,There for entertainment and make girls seem to enjoy them. The only downfall is there's a few of them broke and when they came in.
3.0,gift but wayyyyy to small
3.0,"Size is a little small, but very comfortable"
3.0,"I was a little bit disappointed with teh inside design, not very many card slots."
3.0,The material is good but the yellow is see through. Would need a size up for it to look good and needs adjustment in the crotch. I purchased it in blue and one size up after receiving the yellow. I don't think the model is wearing the actual piece :( so a bit deceiving.
3.0,"It fits very weird at the bust, waist and the pocket area. Im 5'1"" so it is too long to wear with leggings. Otherwise guess ok with them. Ended up not wearing it outside the house."
3.0,"I just received this today, it didn't really look like the photo and it was super wrinkly but thats ok, I actually like the material even though it didn't look like the photo at all, it is a stretchy satin-y feel but not shiny as the photo but more of a matte-shine look.  I thought it was ok overall, I will be wearing this to lounge around the house and sleep so it doesn't need to look amazing."
3.0,"These are not for petite women. I was hoping that these would fit me as ankle length leggings, but the legs were very wide and loose around my ankle. They do seem to be a good quality, just didn’t work for me."
3.0,This served its purpose but was a pain to stick on. They give you eye lash adhesive and you can see it through the mustache. We tried to get it out but it was not coming out so we put some eyeshadow that matched the color to cover it up but it wouldn't stick. So I found some double sided tape that I use and we used that and it worked well. Save yourself some trouble and get some double sided tape.
3.0,"Well, it was good until the back zipper broke, only 2 weeks after having it. :(  I am returning it, but what  a hassle!!!!!!!"
3.0,"I ordered a 5x, it measures 42"" around the chest.  The size chart says the 4x is 47.2 inches so this should have been larger. I have spent hours sewing a panel in the back. Not ideal but it is a costume. Buyer beware."
3.0,"This bag is just ok. It seems very thin and cheap, I'm not sure how long it'll last. These just nothing special about it, and it doesn't seem very big. For me, the longest trip it would last for is an overnight trip. If it was all I had I'd use it, but its definitely not my favorite."
3.0,The hips and waist are tight and then the cuff on the calf is very wide.
3.0,Has to return as it was smaller than 2 others I purchased from a different company and the light would work intermittenly.
3.0,"I love the look and feel of this sweater. The design caught my eye, immediately. However, pay CLOSE attention to the sizing....no matter how cute clothing is, it matters not at all if you can't fit in it. I am 5'1&#34;, 105 pounds and this is way too small. :("
3.0,"It came a month earlier than Amazon said it would and it's way bigger than I thought it would be too. There are three compartments where you can put your bills, one zipper compartment and you can put up to 5 cards inside it. The leather material does not feel cheap at all, nor does the wallet lining and the stitching line is perfect.<br />After a day though, I tried to pull the zipper to get my coins and it came off. The stitches started ripping off as well when i tried to fix it."
3.0,"I'm 5'3, the torso is a bit too long on me. Still comfy but not as good as it could be if the fit was a little better."
3.0,Pants were fine his work pants a little on the big side
3.0,"loved the sweater bright colors, just too small had to return it"
3.0,"Good quality, don't like the foot straps"
3.0,"Bewish Stainless Steel Bracelet Watch Band. I rates this 3.5 stars. Unfortunately, I didn’t have many options of replacement watch bands because everything is designed for Apple watches which was frustrating. This watch band is definitely worth the price, but quality is ok. You get what you paid for. I am not confident this band will last for years to come, but it’s good for now. The band already has a lot of scratches"
3.0,Love this outfit. However. The top is more of a crop top . The pants fit perfectly. Cute but not what I expected
3.0,"Very flattering, loved the way it fit. However, a button came off right away and the fabric was cheap so our iron melted a patch of the skirt... Will not be buying again unless seller improves its quality."
3.0,The dress has a spanky material that is lightweight and won't get wrinkled.. I ordered the 3x but its not a good fit for my shape.. so I'm returning..but I think it would work for others...
3.0,"This shirt looks very nice. It is rather small for an xl. Unfortunately I will have to return it. The material seems nice and comfy. If you are looking for a loose fit, you will probably want to order a size up. I usually wear an xl, once in a while a large in a top. This does fit me, but it is not loose. I was looking for a loose fitting top."
3.0,It's beautiful. Just very small. I can't even get it to my wrist.
3.0,I had bought these for night driving.  I really can't see much difference.
3.0,If you have a larger chest this is not the suit for you. No support for the girls. Also 1 of the straps came unattached to the suit. Will return.
3.0,"This is a beautiful, colorful, sturdy bracelet. The only thing I am unsure of is if the beads are genuine malachite or if they are painted glass beads. I have no way of knowing for a fact these are real malachite, but there is a red scratch on one of the beads that makes me have this question"
3.0,"Overall not a bad dress.  Dress hits about mid thigh.  I do suggest wearing a slip with the yellow color as you can see through the dress.  Another con is the sleeves were very tight, I had to alter them to fit properly."
3.0,The pattern was pretty but it was just too short. I’m 5’7” and it didn’t touch the top of my feet. I prefer mine longer.
3.0,Not much difference at night
3.0,"It measures out to what it said it would be but just looks allot smaller when you put it on, Would look better on a female that on a male!"
3.0,I got this to wear a jacket over it and it was so cheap and flimsy I had to return it. Definitely a no.
3.0,"Nice colors, nice prints. After one use they looked very “washed”."
3.0,"There were multiples of Gemini, but not a single Pisces. Disappointing considering that’s my sign.<br /><br />Update: ordered two more boxes, got two Pisces in one box, but two extra Gemini again in the second.<br />The sizes are inconsistent as you can see in the picture. Still like the frames just wish it came with Pisces."
3.0,"I love the band,but it keeps coming undone from the fit2. There for I have to mark it down."
3.0,Glasses are great.<br />Just too short for an appropiately fit
3.0,"It said four pieces but then it said that just two bracelets come so I ordered two times this products and now I have 8 bracelets, anything else good but bracelets break very easily"
3.0,"I had high hopes for this dress. I thought the material was going to be more like cotton, but it was shiny. This is not a wrap dress, but a FAUX wrap dress. The floral print is pretty and the length was perfect (I am 5'5&#34;)...came down to the floor, but not too much. The dress fit very snug. I don't know it going up a size would help or not..it may be too big in other areas then. Sadly, I had to return it."
3.0,"Awesome suit, however the sizing is WAY off. I ordered a large & received a 4XL!!"
3.0,These pajamas are okay. The top is cute. The material is not very breathable and I find myself not wearing them much because the elastic waist band twists and becomes uncomfortable.
3.0,"Not very well made, layer behind credit card slots came apart the first time I inserted my credit cards."
3.0,I can fix the broken hand but should have shown up intact
3.0,"The dress was beautiful, and it fit decently, and the materials were good. however, the satin trim on the sleeves do not stretch, so if you have thick arms it will fit way to tight and have to cut it. Had I went up a size, it would have been just for the sleeve, but I’m afraid the dress would have fit way too loose."
3.0,I liked the rings but they were too small.  I ordered an 8 but they would not go over my knuckle.  The information on the posting is inaccurate since it says that the inside diameter is 1.8 cm but I have an 8 from another source and it does measure 1.8.  I liked the rings but they were useless for me so I did return them.
3.0,"no es de muy buena calidad el material, el bolsillo vino roto"
3.0,not much else to say
3.0,"Lightweight, thin, and stretchy. Showing signs of wear after a month. Doesn’t trip the metal detectors in the airport or work. As you wear it it the length grows and needs daily readjusting at the buckle. I would say it’s good for occasional wear but not everyday."
3.0,Doesn't stay attached to the glasses.  Perhaps ducktape?
3.0,Thought the quality of dress was good but the color was looking different from product page.
3.0,"There was a rip I had to sew when it came in, lmao."
3.0,The shoes are very nice but are definitely bigger than what they say....going to have to return.
3.0,A bit too transparent even over a beige bra.
3.0,Material little poor for the price paied.
3.0,"super soft, great fit but the material is paper thin. I couldn't wear this in public without showing my nerps to the world haha"
3.0,"I'm a little disappointed. I was hoping for a beautiful, airy, quality summer dress. I ordered a size small white dress, it fits fairly well, but the color is quite stark. The top was a bit baggy, the fabric is thin, and it wrinkles easily. The dress can still look beautiful and I'll keep it, but there are definitely better dresses to buy for your money."
3.0,"Its see-through, and I was expecting better"
3.0,Nicely made but made for fat feet not narrow thin feet like mine. Unfortunately I had to return them.
3.0,These shades were wayyyy too dark. I never wear them
3.0,Beautiful but too short
3.0,"Kilt is decent, I should have taken the reviews about the side buckle seriously. The buckle is not well designed and is cheap, points are SHARP and the eyelet around the buckle hole fell out on the first wear. This kilt would be amazing if the buckles were re-designed"
3.0,The stones fall out easily.  I'm missing 7 stones and I've worn them twice.
3.0,Cheap materials.
3.0,"I purchased this dress, but have since returned it. The fabric felt very cheap and the color wasn't as pleasant as in the photos. However, the dress did fit well."
3.0,"Runs big, but found at a great price so we will save for the future"
3.0,A major issue with this mask is it’s hot. If you live in hot zones like the southwestern USA I don’t recommend it.  Especially if you will be exerting yourself due to exercise.  The material doesn’t breath beyond the area with the breathing holes.
3.0,It was just ok. Quality wasn't what I expected. Very thin material. I got what I paid for. Also sent the wrong size.
3.0,"It actually looks good, i liked it .....but its not a new hat.... definitely used by someone else."
3.0,Why are they so darn tight? My daughters face looks deformed when I tried them on her. Will be returning
3.0,"I had hoped that the material was going to be knit or cotton, but it turned out to be a polyester type that didn't really look that great.  The skirt of this shirt isn't as full as in the picture, but still flares nicely.  The straps are super cute and easy to put on and off, but do not mask your bra straps at all."
3.0,Navy color was to light and yellow was more lime green.
3.0,I didn't see how big it was so when I got it I was disappointed and you can barely see the other symbols because of how small it is
3.0,The small chain around the finger is almost big enough to fit around your wrist and does not offer any way to shorten the chains length therefore allowing a lot of movement.
3.0,It was very floppy and was to small
3.0,"It looses quickly, besides it gets easily stained. Not the best materials you may find."
3.0,"Might seem like a small detail, but these are advertised as Lennon-style glasses, which means they should be small and round.  For the record, these lenses are HUGE and most definitely in the style of Janis Joplin.  I also found the pointy plastic tips on the ear pieces rather uncomfortable.  On the plus side, the lenses are a lovely shade of pink and the product is packaged quite nicely with a gift box, shammy, and storage bag."
3.0,"Wasn't paying attention and got the two clip, not my favorite but trying to get use to them, they are handy with shorts!"
3.0,When I got the bow ties I was expecting a brighter red as shown if picture because we are using them for our Christmas Cantata.  They were a darker red. They are ok but I was expecting them to be a brighter red.
3.0,"cheap quality, I do not recommend, my boyfriend gave it a try at his job and got it dirty and that is the only reason why we didn't return it."
3.0,"Beautiful dress but and that's a big but it is completely see through... Does Not have a lining underneath! Unless you're comfortable with your underwear showing then this is not the dress for you. Like I said before it is beautiful and perfect for Vegas, and I would've probably figured out a way to wear it or even sent it to get it fixed but this dress runs too small and therefore I will be returning it.  I am usually a medium (34c) but I couldn't even get it over my boobs. It has no stretch at all, and if I would've known this I would've ordered a size bigger."
3.0,"Love the fit, material and style.the sleeve had a hole in it... my suggestion check it carefully on arrival."
3.0,"They are cute, but the iron on design was messed up on one of them and the tags are on the outside of the panties. I'm a little disappointed in the quality, but I just remind myself that they are only for potty training purposes so it doesn't matter that much. They are made in China so I didn't expect much."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, very comfy, but is way too short on me. I am 5'5 and it comes about 3 inches above my ankle. Very disappointing as the rest of the dress is perfect. There should be an option for a ""long"" size."
3.0,Very nice my girl liked it
3.0,small and too tight
3.0,They were smaller than I expected. Did not easily fit.
3.0,Material is thin. Snags easily.
3.0,Item was much smaller than expected.
3.0,"I like the way it looks, and how it looks in my nose. Expect the gems are not perfect and are off set and hit my nose. This will probably end up in one of my ears."
3.0,"It broke within in 1week, ithe lanyard was too thin. The button are cute thou, sad can't wear it anymore."
3.0,"In the photo, it shows the mask as all purple.  When you get it, it has a white trim around it.  If I had known that, I would have ordered the same from someone less expensive."
3.0,Price .....great but no instructions! A few did not work.
3.0,Ordered a medium the it was way too big for me. I ended up giving it to a friend. Nice material.
3.0,"I liked the pretty colors of the gold plated charms, but they are very small.... Very good mixture as well.. Have purchased this charm set several times."
3.0,Material was cheaper than expected.
3.0,The item runs smaller than the size chart.
3.0,This dress has such a cute button and sleeve detail. It does run pretty big though. I had to return it for a smaller size because of this. But it is such a unique mint color and is perfect for dressier occasions
3.0,Shirt looks cheaper in real life. Fits as expected.
3.0,"Was disappointed when I received my Parka because it was too small.  That's the only bad thing about ordering online, can't try it on FIRST.  Still cold in West Texas........."
3.0,"I am mostly happy with this backpack. I bought it mainly for work travel as a way to hold the essentials: laptop, charger, wallet, phone. It doesn't hold much else besides that (I got the smaller size). The photo makes it look like you can fit clothes and tons of other things but you really can't. It would barely fit a sweatshirt, especially if your laptop is already in it. Also, the water bottle pouch on the side is fairly small. I would aim for a 2&#34; (maybe 2.5&#34;) diameter water bottle if you want it to fit. I have a 750mL Camelbak water bottle that just barely fits in the pouch. The small size is nice for easily fitting underneath the seat on the airplane, but sometimes it would be nicer to have more space."
3.0,Like the earrings-wish there was more stud for the backing since it picked my ear to wear but they are cute
3.0,I absolutely adored this top but runs short. I could've dealt with that but it was much too wide for me.  The details were so pretty...I was bummed that I had to return.
3.0,"I liked the material. It is very silky. Loved the polka dots. What I didn't like was that when I went to put it on and tried to run my arms through the holes, the seams ripped from the back of the arm holes! I was devastated. I took it to a seamstress to have it repaired and she ended having to fix a lot of the arm seams. It appeared that the shirt was not properly sewn together when it was made. Beware, it may cost you more to repair the shirt then it is worth."
3.0,"I think the size does not fit almost all , they should come in sizing"
3.0,Looks ok but fit is off. The sleeves hang off and the fit at the hips is clingy. I'm not a big hip person and this just fits weird.
3.0,"The arms are extremely baggy for a medium.  If you like that than this is  great for you, if you prefer a normal to slim fit then avoid."
3.0,The product itself is nice but it runs very small. It is more for someone who wears an X-Small or small...possibly a medium.
3.0,"The sleeve length is short and the seams are not threaded too well, but the material is super soft and comfortable. Great for underneath another shirt or for workouts!"
3.0,It fit ok. It was hot. The fabric doesn't breathe. I sent it back.
3.0,As the saying goes: you get for what you pay.
3.0,"Thin product. Kind of a cheaply made; hence, the low price. It gets the job done, however, for keeping bugs off your neck."
3.0,Had too much hair for this outfit. But my bald husband barely pulled it off. And I’ve never been more attracted to him as I was on Halloween night.
3.0,"Fit my son who normally wears a large fairly tight.  I should have known better when ordering Fox, it always runs small."
3.0,they look great just don't fit my size 12 feet
3.0,These were just okay.  Not exactly what I wanted.
3.0,"Everyone is right, their picture is wrong."
3.0,"However, having purchased it in yellow - a very thin yellow without lining - you could see right through the back to my granddaughter's bottom, once wet.  Did not like this at all.  May not occur in another color, but in the yellow was awful.  Otherwise, the suit fit well and lasted all summer without fade of Moana feature."
3.0,They are comfy stretch material. The fit good everywhere except I prefer to have more covering on my backside. It gies the waist size which was accurate but my butt is basically too big for these. Will be goal underwear I guess since my butt is too big anyways.
3.0,"I feel it is not Genuine Leather, more like Faux Leather<br />and the product is a bit different with the photo in the page: it doesn't have the ""fastener"" near collar as the photo shows."
3.0,"I like the thinness of this watch.  Disappointed with the small screen- hard to see the numbers.  Also, the light is very dim- can hardly see the numbers.  Not bad though for the money."
3.0,Fit was awkward and the air stays trapped in them.
3.0,"For the price it's not bad, but it is darker than the photo indicates and it comes all folded up and wrinkled so it needs reshaping when it arrives but since it was pretty cheap I can't complain. I only need it for a one day event but if this is a hat you want to wear everyday then you might want to reconsider."
3.0,"I like the shape and feel of them, my only issue is that, while wearing them, if I look at my phone or try to read on my tablet, the screen is rainbow colored and wavy?  I'm not sure that make sense but it gives me a headache which is no good!"
3.0,"utilitarian, no frills. i kind of hate it, and the arms are way too long for a small, but it is what it is, you know? i didn't go into this purchase thinking &#34;now i'm gonna get me the world's greatest sweatshirt.&#34; it's good enough for taking the dog out in the rain, or wearing when everything else is in the wash. i don't know, you just have one of these sweatshirts lying around. it's what people do."
3.0,"The glasses were fine, but not any higher quality than  dollar store cheaters."
3.0,There's no difference between the size 6 and 6X
3.0,"Just too big. I am giving it to my cousin, it will first her."
3.0,nice dress but runs a little small
3.0,"Since these  were advertised as compression  shorts, I was disappointed in them. I followed the size chart, but maybe I should have ordered a smaller size. There really wasn't any compression."
3.0,a little large and a little long. Will work as a dress if belted.
3.0,So cute! I love the brand and the design. The only problem is that is too big for a new born this outfit fits a 3-6 months baby. I bought for my newborn but He couldn’t wear  it the day he born because it was too large. We kept the outfit because is super soft and cute. Hopefully he will be able to wear it in the next few months.
3.0,"Well when the product arrive le had a kink the chain which so it was slightly bent which I can’t get out, so I have 18k gold that’s not perfectly fluid, I was disappointed. Have ever the product was real, which is all I that I can say."
3.0,"Be careful when ordering from Third Party.  I got this dress and it is very pretty but I did not get the chance to wash it to see if the colors run like some of the other reviews state. If you are a busty person like me, you may want to think twice before ordering this dress.  I immediately sent for a return the day after I received it and I was going to go up a size until I found out once again that I have to pay to have it shipped back.  Sometimes the amount that it costs to ship it back is not worth it, with the price of the dress.  Be very careful when ordering a dress that does not give at the top because it does not stretch. It is made of material that does not give at all plus it has a zipper that will not give.  I am afraid that it I go up another size the skirt portion will just be too much material and by the time I have a seamstress alter it, I will have more in the dress than I bargained for.  I already went up one size as I was instructed to do but still cannot zip it up from the chest to the neck.  BE CAREFUL and make sure that it will fit."
3.0,Quick shipping considering it's coming from Hong Kong. Looked like it was packaged really good. Only problem is that the part that sits on your nose seemed a little wobbly.
3.0,The advertised picture looks enhanced compared to the product. Delivery extremely slow.
3.0,"This fit the stock seat that came on my mountain bike (which was ROCK hard, I wish I was exaggerating). I could barely last a few minutes before having to stand for relief.  This seat definitely helped to add comfort but not as much as I had hoped. It delayed the discomfort for a few minutes but not enough for a good ride. If you can already stand your current seat for a mile or two, or more, before it gets uncomfortable, then this should give you sufficient relief.  But If you can't stand the seat for more than half a mile/a few minutes (like mine) then you might be better off replacing the entire seat."
3.0,I was disappointed of the look of this dress when it arrived. It fit well but is was just too drab to were to the wedding I  was attending. I'm glad I had a back up dress
3.0,"Fits fine, not very cute- looks like poor quality pajamas"
3.0,It is pretty but very light. I like it but I am afraid it wont support its own weight on a chain.
3.0,It was easy to attached band to my iWatch.  It is a little tight on my wrist.  One of my links cracked after a couple weeks but the company is sending me a replacement band.
3.0,feels like good fabric but fits smaller than expected. Add 2 inches to your normal size.
3.0,Cute but not real silver
3.0,Very nice but the rose is definitely too big for me
3.0,"These are cute glasses. But, they didn’t work for me. The reading glasses part was not strong enough for me. I suggest Going up a level."
3.0,i loved it but its extremely large
3.0,Very cute but not supportive at all. The bottoms on the other hand are awesome!
3.0,They did fit me well. One use and they started slipping off.
3.0,"Looks cool, but they fit very tight. Only the tiniest ankles could wear them."
3.0,"It didn't have the beautiful card that explained the about a mentor , also the star is not that beautiful.. Its nice but not amazing.."
3.0,"this is a cute easy loungie top but its certainly not a top that you would look at and think its high quality. it is more of a long sleeve baggy tee, very thin! its fine if that is what you are looking for but don't order it thinking it is a comfy warm sweater. it did ship much faster than expected!"
3.0,Pretty but lays weird around your neck. works great if you have a turtle neck on.
3.0,"If you aren't very busty or don't have broad shoulders, this may be a cute dress, but as someone who is broader up top, the fit isn't very flattering. Overall though, the rest is cute and it would be great for work. But since it isn't a great look on me, I am returning it."
3.0,It looks nice online than in person
3.0,After one wash and a hang dry (I don’t dry my clothing!) it already faded.  Disappointing
3.0,Coat looks much better on the picture than in person.
3.0,its nice..and material is soft..
3.0,Jacket ripped out while vacationing and ice fishing.  Had to get it repaired.
3.0,These are not for Women with flabby roll like me. They fit strange around the waste like low in the front and higher in the back. Probably just me. I am 5'3&#34; 133lbs.
3.0,"I really liked the design on these. However, after one use the stitches on the one thumb came loose. We used it for a costume... not made for actual wear.;)"
3.0,The rings are very pretty but too big and fall out of my nose when I blow it.
3.0,The size wasn't as expected
3.0,"You have to be very careful when reading and buying from this listing because it seems like you would be getting, at least, three of these pendants when looking at this listing. However, in reality, you are only getting one very small pendant for the price. Even though I read through the listing I apparently skipped over the part where it said that it was for one pendant so I am quite disappointed in that. The pendant is very nice although it is very small and now I am not quite sure what I want to do with it. I am unable to use it the way I wanted so I might have to buy another one and maybe make a pair of earrings or something from them. Maybe I will figure something out. However, just be aware when buying from this seller that you are only getting one pendant and not the three that are shown in the photos."
3.0,"Material is thin, but made for a great Twisted Sister Nun Halloween dress (with collar and habit over the neckline). Very long and needed 3&#34; heels to not trip over it."
3.0,Real nice outfit but way too small..i usually wear xl..so I purchased so but or fits like a medium
3.0,I am 5'8&#34; and the dress was short in the front. Recommend for shorter women
3.0,kept it hope to lose weight
3.0,"It was too big and oddly cut so the straps don't lay quite right.  Gained 2 cup sizes (pregnancy), and still same problem except the bra itself fits ok, just middle fashion straps are huge and don't lay right.  All in all just awkward, but comfortable enough to hide under a baggy sweatshirt."
3.0,The plastic bits on the seams that cover your sides below the underarm were constantly poked. My boobs looked amazing in this bra but it was so uncomfortable. I wish they could find a way to make this a comfortable bra because then I'd get it in all the colors. ☹
3.0,Not exactly what I was expecting but will save for warmer weather. Didn’t notice it was “T-shirt” material
3.0,"Nice wallet, but the flap on the coin purse was completely, very obviously crooked. It bothered me a bit, but I couldn't be bothered to return it. The latch forces me not to shove everything in my wallet, a huge plus for me - keeps it nice and thin. That said, this wallet has lasted very well. It gets thrown around between backpacks and bags and it still looks really nice - almost new still (and I've had it for a while) - whereas some other wallets show wear pretty easily, so I'm impressed with that. Only other gripe is the latch - it does the job very well and doesn't come open unless you want it to, but the middle pin in the latch isn't secure. It hasn't fallen out, but sometimes it'll slide more toward one side, which then makes it hard to close since it'll catch on the exposed pin. It's decent for the price."
3.0,"I ordered the dress in navy size medium, but I received a totally different dress of same size and color with lace and pleated collar instead.  I tried it on anyway just to check the size so that I know if the fit is good when I return the wrong dress and reorder the proper one again. So I am not really reviewing the right dress here; however, I am commenting on the brand's sizing and material. I did find the listing for the dress I received in case if you're interested: Miusol Women's 1950S Style V Neck Cap Sleeve Flare Lace Cocktail Party Dress (http://a.co/aPcyNVf).<br /><br />I find the size to be true. The navy is what I would expect. The cutting is flattering. Workmanship is better than expected given the price point. I would definitely look for other dresses under this label for inexpensive stylish fashion. However, I would like to comment that if I were looking for the lace version, I probably would return it because the lace is not the classy type. The lace is what gave away the cost of the dress. I would not wear it to a nice party. The style is good for the occasion but not the material. I would order a lighter color and wear it during the day instead as the lace material suggests casual. It's a pull over type of wear, no zipper. It's thick enough to wear alone."
3.0,Good 💕
3.0,"The red on this item is so bright. Almost fuschia not red. I cannot imagine anything it would match. Online color is way off. It was soft but I am returning this and hoping to find a better red that is deep not bright, The wallet seems roomy and i liked the amount of space though."
3.0,It broke my son’s neck out. I am not sure if it’s something in the due or the material. We love the design and the breathable material; not sure why he broke out.
3.0,OK. Will flatten your hair.
3.0,"Necklaces look great, but there is no way that they are actually sterling. My best guess is that the clasps are real silver."
3.0,The white one only came with one strap.
3.0,Wasn’t as in love with it in person as I was with the image on the product listing. But we did wear it for family photos. It’s cute.
3.0,This nail drill definitely does the job and it’s a great price! The only things I don’t love are the fact that the cord with the plug is pretty short and the drill tends to get a little overheated pretty quickly (within about 2 minutes of use). This slows down the spinning of the drill. Overall it serves its purpose!!
3.0,You kinda get what you pay for. It you want tanks that are just for under other tops these are ok. Not for wearing alone because the seems @ the bottom come undone pretty quick. I wear them under my scrub tops so they work fine for me.
3.0,"Ordered these to repair a broken controller. Watched a walk through and was very gentle with the components. It wasn't as hard as I expected.<br /><br />When I got it all open and tried to Attached the new thumb sticks, the holes on the were designed to small to fit into a PS4 controller.<br /><br />DO NOT FORCE THEM ON. You'll break it.<br /><br />Instead, use a knife or a screwdriver to hollow out the holes until they fit. It worked fine for me.<br /><br />However, the controller ended up acting up with my PS4 once it was repaired, so I traded it into GameStop for $40 on 50 percent extra trade in."
3.0,"This just didn't fit me. The proportions were all off, and the material looked really cheap."
3.0,"Not too impressed with the fit, but the material is really soft"
3.0,Much smaller version than expected.  But works as these do.
3.0,This doesn't fit like the picture. I love it but the sides under my arm are way too baggy. It fits nice everywhere else
3.0,These are a great quality material but I had to order two sizes up because the waist/hip is so tight
3.0,Smaller then a 42mm
3.0,Very pretty. But its mighty thin. Im a usa size 10...but if ur bigger it b to tight

3.0,"This dress is definitely not worth $40. It's itchy, crummy fabric, and probably won't hold up. It will do for Halloween, though. Wouldn't recommend. Gave it 3 stars because, even though it's not comfortable, it looks alright."
3.0,It will shrink two sizes smaller if put in the dryer.
3.0,"Medium fits snug and fabric is so sheer it can only be used as a swimsuit cover-up. Buy the next size up if you want it loose and flowy.  You'll have to wear something underneath, it's very sheer."
3.0,"Bought a size small. I was very excited to get this sweater today but when I opened the package, I instantly realized it was opened before, as it was cut at the top and there was scotch tape on both ends as an attempt to keep contents sealed.<br /><br />I tried to brush it off but when I tried it on, I noticed an imperfection right away in the center chest area due to the way it was manufactured. It isn't BIG but noticeable enough, especially since it's  front and center. It's like a target for others to stare at my chest.<br /><br />I still love the sweater so I am replacing it with the exact same one. Crossing fingers the replacement won't have any defects."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:adbdfef9b3e6cc0f1385a5829054d260]] Cute summer outfit, I had so many plans for it in my mind, but my normal size XXL was too small and due to the thinness of the material, I didn’t force the zipper up. It’s sheer, but again, it’s more of a summer outfit, which would be perfect. My advice, buy it because it’s really cute, just order a whole size up."
3.0,Bigger than I thought and kinda cheap.
3.0,I like this belt which I wear daily but was disappointed with the durability.  Purchased this belt at the end of January 2019 and now at the end of October 2019 one side of the finished leather has cracked through into the center layer of material where the buckle passes through.  Would have given five stars if not for this problem.
3.0,I ordered 2 pairs of socks in men's medium but received men's small. Communication wasn't swift but not slow when I inquired about exchanging. I give it 3 stars because I am waiting to see how quickly the return is handled.
3.0,"Over priced t-shirt , the holograph is not nearly as holographic as pictured. It is a decent shirt but over priced in my opinion. The picture used to advertise is looks way more realistic than it actually is."
3.0,very cool but the chain is cheap
3.0,"Bought for my 10 year old. She picked it. Came pretty fast from China.<br /><br />The ""stone"" wiggles and within two hours turned her finger green.<br /><br />To avoid this plus protect against tarnishing, we're going to coat with clear nail polish. Will need to do this weekly if she wears it a lot."
3.0,"These are great if you have a smaller face frame as the frames are smaller. They provide you with a magnetic eyeglass case, microfiber cloth that is embossed with their logo and the sunglasses. The sunglasses don’t feel or look cheap and are matte black."
3.0,"I've owned these for maybe 4 years now. Its been what, 8 years since the matrix was first released? They are kind of neat to have and if you are planning on having a morpheus costume for halloween or whatever then these are fantastic sunglasses. They are functional sunglasses but are more gimmicky than useful...also they never feel like they're on right and they attract fingerprints like crazy."
3.0,I am 5'4 128 lbs. I normally buy small to mediums.. After reading the reviews I bought a large now I wish I would have gotten an XL.. It runs junior sizes I suppose. However.. Even if it's a tad snug it's still super cute!!
3.0,It's a good concept but they pop out of shoes and need to be replaced frequently. They are not easy to get in
3.0,Hvghbnk
3.0,Loved it I have a small wrist and it’s very comfortable. The only thing I didn’t like was that the stitching was on the outside where it’s visible.
3.0,Disappointed.  Some of the bands don’t stay in the watch when you have to stretch a little over your hand to put it on.
3.0,Beautiful shirt.  To  small ☹️
3.0,"Overall good product but I gave it three stars because the hook mechanism isn’t like a d-ring clip, but rather you have to unscrew it, weave the wire between your purse straps, and then screw back together (which is a pain to screw back together if not aligned perfectly). It secured the bag nicely no matter the weight, however only if the bottom portion of the hanger is securely lock in under the table. Otherwise your pursue will fall off bc of the weight, which pulls the hanger off the table (purse ends up on the floor). I would recommend it to a friend."
3.0,Eh. It’s pretty cheaply made...especially the elbow patches. Length is great for leggings. Thin material but it is what I expected for the price.
3.0,Decent quality. They are a little bigger than I expected.
3.0,Loved them at first but broken easily
3.0,"I’m 5’10”, athletic build, 180 lbs, 44” inch chest.  I ordered a large and the tank top is tight in the chest."
3.0,"The design was very cute but I was expecting it to fit more unisex, not form fitting. The last thing I want at a crawfish boil is to wear tight clothes on a 92 degree day!"
3.0,Beautiful look. Too thin and don’t fit well.
3.0,"The print is so cute, however the small of the back is very baggy."
3.0,Too short and cut small
3.0,"The shorts itself are pretty comfortable but they ride up with anything you do, even walking. They are better for lounging around the house."
3.0,"I got this as a gift but the chain was choker length despite the photo showing a more normal length. for this type of item.,  I couldn't possibly give it the way it was and had to replace the chain.  If there was a choice of chain lengths, I did not see it.  The little feet and engraving were as shown."
3.0,"I saw other photos and it looks like silver, however the one I got looks blackish. I’m wondering if it’s used or it’s like that ????  I wanted silver"
3.0,Didn’t think they looked genuine @ all iron on looked kind of fake to me sorry
3.0,"Perhaps it's because I wear an xl but this dress does not look, fit wise, like the picture. It is very high waisted and then kinda flares out. Not what I was expecting. It is made out of a nice soft stretchy fabric."
3.0,It’s very thin. I wanted one a little thicker to use with a pendant. I don’t think I will use one with it. Seems too fragile. It’s my own fault as I should’ve found out how thick each measurement is. It’s a very nice chain and worth what I paid for it. It’s just not what I was looking for because it is too thin.
3.0,"It is larger, more round than the photo and substantially heavy around the neck.  I love how it looks but I can't wear it all day with how heavy it feels."
3.0,One was broken off the hook and I couldn't get it back on
3.0,"It was a bit see-through, so I'm probably just going to wear it as a beach cover-up... But other than that it's at least somewhat like the picture"
3.0,It’ll do.
3.0,a little disappointed in the quality and runs large (size chart is off)! Happy that I found mittens on a string though!
3.0,Just another pair of shorts
3.0,Small fit but cute. Waiting to lose weight lol
3.0,Difficult clasp.  Too much trouble compared to other watches.
3.0,Smaller than expected and honestly fat more flat and not as pictured
3.0,3 stars because the came fast very upset the barbells we're really short I like the fact there flexible but the industrial barbells was totally short and the balls was the size of a 3mm so I was very disappointed I needed these for work
3.0,"Low quality display.  Battery gets over i unused ones, after two month of non use, kept safe."
3.0,A bit lost in my handbag but maybe my handbag is larger than I thought.
3.0,The waistband is too large and the hips are too small. I must just be too curvy lol.
3.0,"I originally bought the red one with ruffled trim, and I liked it okay (it’s just really wrinkly) so I went back and bought the green polka dot one. The green one has buttons down the front and no ruffles, but it fit better and looked amazing and didn’t wrinkle nearly as bad as the red one. The only problem is that within a couple of hours it had split down the back, completely exposing me at a work meeting.  Super fun.  I figured I would return it and try again since it was so dang cute, except I decided I would wear it at home for a day just to be sure my backside wouldn't end up exposed to all my colleagues again. Good idea since once again, it split.  I wasn’t even doing anything, just hanging out at home. It completely unraveled in the back. I returned it and got the black one with ruffles and it’s fine. I’m just disappointed because the button style was way cuter, didn’t wrinkle nearly as bad as the ruffled ones, and overall just fit me better. I just don’t trust them not to fail on me so I can’t really recommend getting this right now. I might try again on another color just to see if the issues were limited to green, but I don’t know. I’ll update if I do."
3.0,I purchased this set because it has the matching hat. Unfortunately the hat is too small for my 7 year old. I didn’t expect it to be a great quality item because of the price but I did expect it to fit because it says it fits 10 year olds.
3.0,"This necklace is super cute but a little ""cheap"" looking. I thought I'd go a little bold and bought this to wear with a green dress for my nephews wedding, which didn't happen due to quarantine.  Nonetheless, not for me. I sold it to my friend whom it looks fantastic on.  She's a bit more flashy than I am, just not for me."
3.0,When all card slots are full it takes work to snap shut and tends not to stay snapped but size and function were what I wanted exactly so was willing to deal but haven't had for long and the d-loop the wrist strap attaches to ripped from the wallet.
3.0,It's just fine socks ..
3.0,Stones fell out as soon as I opened bag. Cheaply made
3.0,"My shoe size is 5, these running too big for me. I end up returning them."
3.0,I wish I would have known the wallet was so big. It really doesn't fit inside A pants pocket.
3.0,Way looser that it should for an S size
3.0,"I love the design of the bag, but it's very flimsy. I only had the bag for two weeks before one of the magnetic clasps fell off the bag."
3.0,"Good fiit, fit as expected, easy to wash but cheap"
3.0,"The colour was perfect, I like the style, but it was way too short everywhere and see through."
3.0,"I had high hopes for this hat. I am outdoors a lot for my job and wanted a cute sun hat to wear during hotter days. I was excited about this hat but when I received it, it just looked really odd on me. I wanted more of a stylish hat and the size of the brim just made the hat look silly on me. If I could remove about an inch from the brim's diameter, I probably would've kept it. I wouldn't not recommend someone from buying this hat so if you don't like it, you can return it for free."
3.0,Not a good cut
3.0,"It only comes with the dress, hair accessories, and waist belt. The white waist belt could be better quality. The dress fits snug, but I can move around if you have size D boobs good luck fitting a large my boobs feel squished, and I’m a 34C"
3.0,"I guess it is what you would expect but it's a pretty cheap product. The head is a snap together and comes a part pretty easily. Overall look was what I was going for but for the price, it could be better."
3.0,"Cute bracelet, but it was pretty small. Not sure this size would fit most women."
3.0,"When ordered it looks much bigger in the picture and when I got it, I was a little upset. The star it's about penny size (might be a little smaller) and the chain is very small and weak. The chain actually broke on me after the second time wearing the necklace.<br />It's beautiful but would of liked it a little bigger and a much stronger chain!"
3.0,"It's nice but, the metal is much thinner the item is showing. If you like the metal to be thicker I wouldn't recommend this ring."
3.0,I needed a yellow dress so I could be phoebe at my Friends themed bridal shower. This was the best priced one. It worked okay but I won’t ever wear t again. I don’t like where it sits on the mid section.
3.0,"Super cute, but it doesn’t stay up on my face or nose. I have a smaller than average head I guess. The circumference of the mask won’t stay up on my face. I’m returning it because it doesn’t fit. Wish it would have worked!"
3.0,This is very small. More like a woman’s watch. Times makes some nice Steelers watches.
3.0,Love the colors.  A little short for me though so
3.0,"I love the color and softness of these socks, but the first pair my daughter put on had a hole."
3.0,"Bust is small,no support."
3.0,"Nice watch, but the hands DO NOT glow in the dark."
3.0,This T-shirt is 100 percent polyester. It comes in a wrinkled look intentionally.  The seams have the unfinished look but I believe that is the style. The design of the shirt is made more for the younger crowd as most men over 50 would not wear a wrinkled look T-shirt. It washed well and didn't bleed plum colors on the other clothes
3.0,This shirt is true to size and the colors are great but is very thin. It’s more of a summer evening coverup and not a cold weather keep you warm. It is thin enough to be layered with an oversized jacket.
3.0,It's smaller than I expected in the arm. And since it had the thumb holes you really notice it
3.0,Shorts are a little warm but fit perfect ordered a large and fit perfect
3.0,This belt is pretty rigid which should serve its purpose but not the best quality. We kept as we didn't have time to find another belt in time for what my husband needed it for.
3.0,This product is nice but do not get it wet it will start to look dull fast.
3.0,"These were part of a trio I bought to give to someone, but she found one of the others comfy so I kept this one. It's not very comfy. The heel is cushiony, the ball of the foot area is not. Would I buy it again? Not really."
3.0,Cute .
3.0,"The pocket seams began unraveling the moment I put it on. It’s a bit box, less tunic, compared to the picture.<br />Color is great."
3.0,I didn’t like the material.. looks like something you can put on a table
3.0,"The watch works fine and was what I expected for the price.  I have had Casio watches before so setting the time/date and alarm functions was easy.  I got this model because of the WR rating and the 7 year battery.  When the watch is a year old, I try to remember to upgrade the rating."
3.0,They leak.
3.0,I liked the fact that they're very colorful.
3.0,"I love the color and the fact that an extender was included. However, the stiff wire on the sides is very uncomfortable. I hate underwire and it never occurred to me that side wire would be even worse! Sure, it offers firm support, but stiff, poky bands right under my armpits is miserable."
3.0,Lens fogs on inside
3.0,"I bought a large. I have a 36-inch bust, so a large should have fit just fine. It’s quite snug through the chest."
3.0,Not the color I ordered. The orange was darker in the picture.
3.0,Shoes didn’t fit. I had to return and order a size up.
3.0,"The band isn’t the highest quality but for the price it’s spot on. We purchased two, one for me, one for my wife. I wasn’t able to get it on but my wife’s fit her nicely and looked decent. It was so inexpensive that my wife said she would like to keep mine for a different look. One silver, one black."
3.0,"Cute, but bigger than I expected. Runs a little bit big."
3.0,Well.. I got a large.. And it fits pretty good... They only thing is the gown is short and barely passes my butt. I'm still going to wear it. And its still a good product
3.0,"The tees look pretty good, nice fabric. But the sizes are not the same as the chart description, I measured myself before buying it because it was going to travel out of US and it didn't fit. I gave it as a gift and ordered one size smaller."
3.0,Love the design but the material is flimsy. Also looks like the design will wear out or fade out in a few months.  Guess I will wait and see and update this review.  The flap to hold the long strap seems like it is made out of cardboard.  Definitely not worth 20 bucks.
3.0,Size was way offf!  Loved everything about it except size was off a size!  Couldn’t get bigger size so had to return!
3.0,Got little holes in them fast but very soft and comfy
3.0,pretty but stick is too long & arch is too high for my hair.  it would work better on a head of bushy hair.
3.0,"Loved the design but material is very cheap, full of wrinkles and needs to be ironed to get out."
3.0,One broke as I put it on the second time I used it.
3.0,Adult size for kids mask.  My kids won’t even use them. Bummer.
3.0,The bracelet is beautiful.  My biggest complaint is the chain will only fit around a 10yr old's wrist. I had to go buy and add a longer chain to the bracelet. The clasp broke after the 3-4th time wearing it. I had to buy and replace the clasp as well.
3.0,I wanted to love this dress. It fit well everywhere but the hips. Waaayyyyyy to big and meant for super curvy hips. I’ll have to get it tailored.
3.0,One ripped in a few spots after second use.<br />OK value for price.
3.0,This bag is very cute and so large! I didn't heed the reviews warning of the strap issue though. I used it for taking towels down to the beach from the condo. I had lotions in it too but nothing super heavy. The grommet eventually pulled away from the fabric making that handle not useable.
3.0,"My daughter looked cute, but for the price I was expecting nicer fabric."
3.0,I like softer materials.  Just not my favorite shirt.  The color is great however just not as soft as I like
3.0,"Like the bracelet itself, however it broke."
3.0,Very tight fit. Not comfortable at all.
3.0,It is adorable! However when it showed up some of the little gems had fallen off in transport and it  hurts to wear. I wore it for a couple hours and my ear was bright red.
3.0,Very colorful but ran too large for my grandson to use in the pool.
3.0,I have 17&#34; calves which are not overly big and I can barely get the zipper closed.  Come on boot makers--Wide Calf is so not a true description!!
3.0,"Clothes just aren't what they used to be, quality wise. The fit is alright, although I had hoped it would be a bit longer. I'm 5'7, 120# and it just covers my rear end. (Small chested to boot). The material is very thin, see through. I got the black one and I'll need to wear a shirt under this one as you can see right through it. I tried it on with leggings and the designs/pattern on the leggings was clearly visible straight through the top. That's very disappointing. The sleeves were an odd surprise that I hadn't noticed in the photos. Like an extended cuff to nearly the elbow. Ehhh.. I would have definitely preferred not to have that, but it's ok.<br />Overall, the fit is good, if the material used had been a better quality- I would have likely purchased more."
3.0,Great variety. Only received 13 out of 15 but they were good quality.
3.0,The straps are constantly coming undone. The bra is smaller than expected when I ordered it. Also the bra just comes with an extended piece you clip on.
3.0,Two of three pair broke in the same spot within three days. Would not recommend.
3.0,"I ordered this dress because I saw my friend had it on and it looked classy and expensive! But when my order arrived, still feel the same ot is just way to small at the top, so it will jot zip all the way up. Not sure if my back to wide. (Size:16/ chest sz 38D) Am going to try next size up, although I think it may be to big on the bottom 😏"
3.0,Mask was super thin and flimsy
3.0,"The dress was pretty and the quality was there for the price. However, sizing said s/m when I purchased it but once received it was a MEDIUM and fit extremely huge. They should've said m/l because there is no way that dress could fit anyone small or medium. I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 120 lbs."
3.0,I thought it would fit better but I was wrong
3.0,"I was looking for something to wear around the house that i don't mind getting baby barf on. With that low expectation in mind, this dress still did not meet my expectation. It is too small in size,  i expect poor stitching but its not even remotely flattering.  It's like an undergarment dress. And judging by the packaging wherein the dress was literally twisted as if packaged right after wringing water out.  Weird i tell ya!"
3.0,I really like the band and style.  I just wish it was smaller. I have a small wrist and even though I have it as tight as it can go it is still too loose.  Just something to think about for anyone with tiny  wrists.
3.0,I actually received this shirt a very long time ago so I've spent a great deal of time not liking it.  I wanted it to be a swim-suit coverup and/or something to wear with jeans but it doesn't look at boho hippy as it does in the photo.  It makes me feel like I'm wearing a maternity shirt and I don't like the balloony sleeves and the elastic cuff.  You cannot machine wash it because the beads will come off.  Not even on someone skinny would I imagine that this would look okay.  I haven't worn it since the first time I tried it on but I'm thinking that I can cut off the sleeves and turn it into something nice.
3.0,"It is the XXlarge but surge feels like a large. Good quality and attractive but I gave them away,"
3.0,The diamonds r falling off
3.0,This is a nice shirt but it's cut quite large. I wear a medium to large shirt usually. I ordered a medium of this shirt and was swimming in it.  Really nice light material though. Order a size down.
3.0,Like the shirt- have to wear VS with extra padding to fit it and a shirt underneath to cover bc it’s low cut.
3.0,"A little cumbersome, but works on the belt for my reading glasses or sunglasses. The zipper area could be a little tighter."
3.0,Cute but a little tight. And the quality of the item was nice but it gets hot really quick.
3.0,Great quality but they all fit slightly different. Some fit perfect and others too tight. I ought a few pairs.
3.0,The material is thin and plasticky. I don't think it will hold up long but it's okay.
3.0,"I like it , just wish it was larger"
3.0,This bag didn’t really hold up in the long run. The straps wore out faster than most purses I’ve had.
3.0,"okay, this purse is beautiful inside and out, just as described. however. if you carry a lot in it and leave it hanging on a door handle at night like i did, the handles will start to tear. it already has torn in 3 places with everyday use and i have had it 3 months only :("
3.0,"Nice colors, but smaller size than I expected."
3.0,Nice wig but sheds too much and the plastic in the front center exposesitself easily
3.0,"I love this hoodie except one huge issue, the pockets! I'll never understand why they decided to go with side pockets rather than a kangaroo pocket. The material is far too thick for side pockets, they look like growths coming off your body. I took the sides in a cut the pockets off and it was perfect.<br /><br />It is the softest, warmest hoodie. I could do without the 1/4 zip, it's completely unnecessary and not the best looking zipper. All-in-all, it's just ok."
3.0,Leggins para caminar o hacer yoga. Son muy pequeños soy de talla 16/en ocaciones 18 por las caderas q son amplias.
3.0,Cute big Not that easy to put on my baby.
3.0,"I bought this case for my mom for her first Android! Lol she loved the graphics & the bright, vibrant colors! I think the quality of the case was decent, but after a few months the sturdiness of the case diminished. The magnetic enclosure is good but not very strong. The outside of the case has held up very well. The graphics & colors stand the test of time nicely. It protects the phone very well, & looks cute doing it!"
3.0,"Dress fit well and was comfortable.  However, the cap sleeves stuck out and made it look like it was for a little girl, not a woman.  Will return the dress, due to the sleeves."
3.0,slow shipping but cute necklace
3.0,"the chain did not have an opening or clasp, also looked cheap"
3.0,"These glasses look great and are wonderful, but the plastic breaks at the hinges very easily.  I have reading glasses that I have had for five years without a problem. I am careful with my things, but one pair of these broke within two weeks."
3.0,The wine dress is actually purple but its great aside from that.
3.0,"This is a really pretty, heavy duty cross, but unfortunately Jesus fell off of it after about a week. (We never found Him!)  It's still pretty, just not a crucifix.  So, if you have your heart set on a crucifix, you should probably pick a different one."
3.0,I guess I should of read the reviews first as this summer robe runs too small. This would of been a return from me. The robe itself is nice. It's a lightweight polyester waffle relief pattern . Mine is the solid light pink with the raised waffle feel to the fabric. This is strictly a summer robe as it's lightweight will not be sufficient in the winter cold if you wanteckd to lounge around in it. Could possibly be okay in winter if you just use it to transition after shower to getting dressed. It's a nice robe but it just doesn't close around me like a great robe would. The belt falls out of the package as not attached so use caution when opening. I like this 1x-2x robe but it isn't true to size as should fit size 20-22 but the fit is more like a size 14-16. I'd have to lose around 50 lbs to fit. I wear a 44G bra and it will not go around my chest.
3.0,The ears and choker are amazing but the tail looks really cheap and is really small great for a child costume but not to good if your trying to do a cosplay of a cat girl
3.0,The colours vary to what is posted on-line
3.0,"Color is beautiful, but cut for the 2X size is not as pictured. Straps are MUCH wider and not nearly as flattering as the image shows, and the v-neck comes up a lot higher than pictured as well. Ugh. So frustrating to receive what is essentially a moomoo when you wanted the gorgeous dress in the picture. Just because I am a tall larger woman does not mean I want to be covered up more. Please stop advertising a dress style is carried in plus sizes when the plus size is actually a different cut and style completely."
3.0,"Well the hat is nice, I like it.. but states as small, but just too big for me, unless my head is unusually big.. it just didn't fit.."
3.0,"Did not come with a sash as pictured, or a wrap as described. Still dress is ok."
3.0,5 STAR FOR ORIGINAL PURCHASEI have had this brand for 5 years and they have lasted the storm I am looking to purchase more they are quality and I get many compliments on them. I ordered large they can be difficult at first but leather expands and fit fine.  I have skinny fingers also.<br /><br />THREE STAR FOR NEXT PURCHASE Update purchased rose purple (which are the SAME COLOR) and brown and tan (SAME COLOR) these are not colored as shown on the the image
3.0,Neck is too tight to wear for girl this size
3.0,I like in Florida and when working outdoors I need to use more than one if I'm out for several hours.
3.0,I liked the price and the quality!! But the connected thing at the bottom does NOT hook to my loop it is to big for my new boot loop disappointed!
3.0,"I like the fit of the shirt but the fabric is VERY thin. It's great for a sweaty Zumba class and probably for biking in the summer, but the fabric is so thin that your  sports bra shows through. If that's what you're looking for, this shirt will work. I do like that the thin fabric wicks moisture well and dries quickly."
3.0,This dress would look nice on a very skinny girl with small breasts who wanted a little pizazz. It does nothing for a curvy person and the lace design is very big and loud. I’ll be returning.
3.0,Very thin fabric. It is packed in tiny bag. Picture looked like regular jacket.
3.0,The fit was too big. The material feels cheap. I’m returning it.
3.0,"The mask is ok except for the exhalation valves. There are several problems with them. They have a slot and tab connector rather design, than a threaded design. So after wearing the mask for a few hours, the valves work their way loose and fall off. If you are walking on grass or carpet, you will not hear them fall out and you will lose them for good (like I did).<br />The other issue is that the holes in the mask are cut too large for the exhalation valves. So there is room for them to move around and loosen up (see above).<br />Lastly, the carbon filter is slightly larger than the mask and the holes for the exhalation valves do not match up perfectly with the mask.<br />It would be a good mask if it wasn't for the design flaws and or craftsmanship. It's almost as if the manufacturer makes the masks without accounting for the carbon filters and exhalation valves that they obviously buy in bulk from a third party vendor. Whatever happened to quality control and consistency?"
3.0,Fit was too small but good quality and style. Returned with no issues.
3.0,Nice short... size runs small. Sizing chart has 7 as small but the tag on the pants says 4-6. Give it to my younger sis.
3.0,Beautiful while it lasted. Eventually turned my fingerg green though. I received some wonderful compliments when I wore it.
3.0,"This was almost the perfect shirt. Great style, fast dry, breathable, good fit ..... BUT (there is always a &#34;but&#34;) the button holes are quite frankly crap. Poorly sewn and poorly &#34;opened&#34;. Every button catches on loose threads when you unbutton and it takes a lot of care/time to untangle the loose button hole threads or you just break the threads which weakens the button hole. A shame that such a good product is damaged by one poor quality element. Would have been a &#34;5&#34; if it weren't for the very sad button holes"
3.0,"My son said yes, but I always feel bad. The product is general."
3.0,"My 6 year old really likes these shoes, but they haven't held up terribly well. I guess that is to be expected when they are worn at recess. She loves the slight heel and cute style"
3.0,"I’m 5’2 ,125lbs I order M but a bit big ,should be S"
3.0,"I love white cotton pants, but these were too full for daily wear."
3.0,Colors were smeared and looks darker than picture.
3.0,It may be that my head is just massive but it didnt really fit my head. I just gave it to my little brother. It looks cool it was just small for me other than that it was awesome!
3.0,"Material feels very cheap, it's extremely tight at my chest,."
3.0,"I LOVE LOVE LOVED this coat. The material was nice, the colors were great, unfortunately it was TOO small... :(  I am usually a size Med/Large, wear a size 8/9 in pants. I ordered a size Large; it did not button around my toosh or my breasts. The sleeves were very short too. Wish there was an XL, I loved this style!"
3.0,Love everything about this dress. Do nottttt dry it. It shrinks way too easily. I don’t feel comfortable wearing it anymore and I even sized up to make sure it would be at a comfortable length for me.
3.0,as represented but had some very sharp edges on the clip and the tightening screw.  I had to file Them down to prevent cutting myself when using the clip.
3.0,I got this dress in yellow in size small and the material feels like a thin table cloth it’s hard and see through. I’m petite 105 4’11 and the small was big on me the design is very pretty and looks like the picture but the material is very cheap
3.0,a little large and heavy
3.0,The shirts are good quality made. Although they do run small. I normally wear an extra large and they fit me like a large. And I even went by the sizing chart that was given when you look at different views of the shirt.
3.0,Product runs small not made for curves
3.0,"The ring is beautiful, except the name is written so small it's microscopic I had to use my phone camera to take picture of it at close range and then enlarged it to read it."
3.0,satisfied I got what I paid for
3.0,The material wasnt as I expected.  Doesnt stretch and is shiny.
3.0,I have had it for a month and the color has so easily worn off. It is also hard to talk with case on...people complain they can't hear you.
3.0,Need to exchange for larger size.
3.0,"Ok, here's the deal with this sweater/sweatshirt. The quality is not great. I'll probably get one good season out of it before it starts pilling. However it's really cute, and I like the cut (boat-like neck, dropped shoulders, shorter shirttail). But here's the thing my American ladies should know: Unless you like a really, really fitted fit, you need to go up a size, And even then it will be a tighter, fitted sweatshirt. If that's what you're aiming for -- go for it. I'm usually a large, sometimes a medium. I bought the large, and it's almost too tight. It's fine though if I rearrange my expectations from a cool casual sweatshirt to more of a form-fitting top."
3.0,It's so dark. Obviously fake.
3.0,Dark shades but dollar-store quality
3.0,"Very soft, love the style. Frustrated because I ordered green and they sent black!"
3.0,The ear pieces glued to the barrettes do not stick may want to reglue them before wearing
3.0,"The fix and workmanship were good, except one of the snaps was missing the back.  I had already washed it and threw the package away.  I know the snap will fall out the next time I wear it."
3.0,broke easily but were really cool
3.0,Beautiful but sized smaller than the norm.<br />I will re-order and try again.
3.0,"Quality is not very good, but they are warm. Buckles are VERY wide with limited tightening options (made my own) I would consider myself wide calf. They're just fine."
3.0,Was a little small and kinda cheap
3.0,"Was looking for something to help with glare after cataract surgery- these help some but overall they’re mediocre at best<br />Lightweight, don’t adjust to dark as much as photos suggest, good way to see if driving yellow helps without spending a fortune"
3.0,"I don’t think these where a great deal, and when the visible front part didn’t have any marble effect they looked like pearls, not the look I was going for, there are better gauge options than these if you’re going for heavier too."
3.0,This necklace is very beautiful but i thought it would be bigger. I probably should have read the dimensions before buying but it is still a beautiful piece. One of the other reviews mentioned that the necklace was long and hung down into her clevage but if it did she must be around 5'1 110 lbs because i am 6'2 and the necklace is just a couple inches shy of being a choker on me. Check the length with a measuring tape before you buy to be sure the length is right for you.  But overall it is a very beautiful necklace.
3.0,I'm 5'8 with curves. Usually wear a L/XL. This dress is just to short. I got a big behind  and it would show my cheeks and ride up constantly. Great stretch to hug your body but too short for me.
3.0,This has a yellowish color to it.
3.0,I would give them five stars if only the company would make these in a  WW or even WWWW (4E) width for people with problem feet.
3.0,"Fits well doesn't break. Not as breathable as I'd hoped, but you can't have everything."
3.0,Beautiful jacket. I ordered a woman’s large and it fits like a small.
3.0,If I would have known before purchasing that it would take 21 days to deliver I wouldn't have purchased and being from china it fits too snug to my head.
3.0,This is a junior size or made for petite women. I do not like this top and would not purchase it again.
3.0,beautiful but WAY too small
3.0,"LOVE this pullover but was super disappointed in the fit. It’s fine in the arms and bust areas, but is way shorter than I would’ve liked. XL is my normal size in pretty much everything and that’s what I ordered. I’d say this fits more like a L.<br /><br />Otherwise, it’s super plush and cozy and well made. The design and colors are exactly as pictured - just order up a size!"
3.0,"It is a cute bracelet, but very dainty and lightweight. The hearts are very, very small. I was disappointed."
3.0,"Ok the reason for the generous 3 stars is that I like the swim suit. It's not great quality but it's acceptable. Unfortunately even a 5x is way to small on a person that can wear a 2x usually, so even though i ordered the largest size available it's still on par with an American size large. If it had fit me I'd give it a solid 4.5 stars.I was lucky enough to get a discounted price to try this item out and let people know how it worked out for me.

3.0,"I've ordered several sunglasses and have had great luck - However, I was very disappointed with this order - The first order I received the red that I expected - a true glossy red - Ordered the exact same item and this time it came in as more of a dull reddish orange - Had to use them as that was what was sent - sometimes they have the good red and sometimes it's the dull one - it's a gamble - very disappointed."
3.0,"When I first received it I tried it on and it was a little snug but generally acceptable.  After washing it, it shrank a bit but is still wearable."
3.0,"The shirt fits awkwardly and is more like a maternity shirt in my opinion. Doesn't fit under the bust the way it should (I'm a 40 C). It just doesn't lay right for me, may fit differently for others, but it makes me look bigger than I actually am. Good quality shirt however. Nice colors and print, looks just like the picture, but doesn't lay the way I'd like. I tucked the front in loosely and paired it with a crocheted cardigan and made it work, but definitely wouldn't wear just the shirt."
3.0,I have a tiny head and this is somewhat small on me. It is super cute and I like it...but it keeps popping off. Bummer.
3.0,Really nice watch but no instructions at all?  How to operate and open the clasp?
3.0,"Very thin, you can't see through them but it's very close."
3.0,I didn't care for the elasticized back so I sent it back.
3.0,Isn't true to size. Make sure u get a bigger size that what u think u are.
3.0,Very pretty but I ordered a 14 bottom and 16 top seems like I received just the reverse...very odd...but very pretty top and nice material if a little bigger.
3.0,"Let me just preface this review with the fact that it meets the requirements of being what it is and if you just need it for a costume, it'll work.<br /><br />But it's so cute I want to use it to cook with! Why make it flammable? The straps are so awkward it just falls down when you untie it and wont stay in their loops between uses."
3.0,The size runs small for my boyfriend. His shoe size is 9.5 and I already ordered a bigger size for his feet according to the size chart.
3.0,"I love it, i'm just too short (5'6"") and it doesn't fit well on me. wish there were a way to adjust it, it's kind of annoying the way it fits."
3.0,Like the hoop and studs the half hoop ons don't really stay in place
3.0,Was warm. Work
3.0,"This is not a high quality mesh material and they are obviously made with cheap decals. The bottoms run small and don’t have an actual front or back, but the decal is on both sides, so I guess that doesn’t matter too much. The top is significantly larger than the bottoms so it looks a little funny when the outfit it worn together. My kids like the game, though, so they don’t care about the quality."
3.0,I had to return it because it was too loose around waist although its a slim fit design.
3.0,"Fast shipping, not high quality. One was broke upon arrival, so I only had one useable. Still a good deal for the money."
3.0,"The material of the sunglasses is ok but when I compare with another polarized product, the polarizing effect of this lens seem not very obvious.  I slightly doubt the performance of UV blocking of this sunglasses as it doesn't come along with a certificate or similar accreditation.  I intend to test it myself before giving it to my kid."
3.0,"you will get what you see, Is licra fabric, so it will strech when you put it on. this dress is not design for anyone with curbes because it will crook the front v open leg. It will not look flattering at all. The size even though i requested two sizes up my normal one, it still too tight and crooks the from open leg. So, If you are skinny flat like a surf boar then you will look good on it. Not for curvy girls."
3.0,"Cute and decent quality, but what a pain to put on.  Out of 20 baby outfits I look the least forward to putting this one on her. On top of quite a few snap buttons, there are 4 laces you have to tie separately in a bow tie to properly fasten it"
3.0,"This is a beautiful bag. It's just not big enough for me to carry my uniform, etc in. I'm not sure if I will keep it or give it to my sister."
3.0,La tela es muy sencilla
3.0,"Order a size up, they come super small."
3.0,"Nice for the price. Im gonna have to add bling to make it shine because it is just a sticker with words. I do not know how I am gonna turn my tassel, but I guess I'll figure it  out."
3.0,"They fit nice, but 2-3 belt loops ripped a bit while putting a belt on &lt;/3<br />pockets very good for me considering I carry my phone, headphones, meds, cards, lighter, knife, waterbottle/drink all at once without a bag"
3.0,"This belt is well made, inexpensive and long lasting. I bought one just like it 2 years ago and it’s as good as new - EXCEPT - it’s stretched out!! If it wasn’t for this fact (stretch out) I’d give it 5 stars!"
3.0,"You get what you pay for. My 4 year old granddaughter loves it, unfortunately I bought it for her mother! It cost so little that it didn't matter."
3.0,These fit well and they work but not that much heat. My previous pair worked much better. I wish I hadn't misplaced them.
3.0,"I ordered this to wear under a corset and it works well for that.  It is pretty, has a nice neckline when worn with a corset and I love the sleeves. It is also long enough for me (I'm 5 feet 10 inches) so that is nice too.  On the downside, I feel like the fabric is really light weight and flimsy, so I am concerned about accidentally ripping it.  It is also extremely see through.  Would be great if only the fabric were not so flimsy."
3.0,Cheap looking for my taste. Too many beads. And then it burst. I wear one row now. Looks better.
3.0,"a little too snug for my Casio, but I made it work"
3.0,Super cute for super hero day at my sons school. The only negative is the material isn’t super comfy. It is a little rough and wrinkles easily.
3.0,Top did not closed as in pic. The rest is OK.
3.0,Love the bracelet but lost it the first time wore it because it would not stay fastened.
3.0,"We ended up returning this dress.  The top is lovely, but the bottom is thin, cheap looking satin."
3.0,"I purchased this dress based on all the product reviews. I think it’s super cute and the material is pretty substantial. The only issue I had was I followed people’s recommendations, and the sizing chart, and the dress I received was about 2 full sizes too large. I had already washed it (thinking it would shrink) so I couldn’t send it back. I mean, it was only 42$, so I wasn’t expecting awesome, but I was really disappointed with the sizing. I’m 5’6” and weigh about 138pounds. 36d chest and I think a small would have fit much better."
3.0,"1 button fell off when I removed the shirt from its bag, 2 more came off as I tried on the shirt. I noticed the remaining buttons were loose also. Luckily, my wife sewed them all on securely.  Could be more stars if the sewing was better"
3.0,"Order  size 8.5 which is my seize but when it came,it was small."
3.0,My daughter wears a 4t and I ordered the large. The top fit fine but the bottoms are too big. Just need to cut two inches from the crotch to make it fit otherwise her privates will show.
3.0,"I love the color! The sizing is off, I ordered a medium top and a medium petite pant and it fits like a large to extra large!"
3.0,"Did not like feel of material, Placement of flowers not as pictured. And ran a little small. Will return"
3.0,"This would be excellent IF it were flared at the bottom to accommodate a woman's shape better.  The fabric seems very durable--double thickness of strong elastic type material.  It does have a slight odor. My present waist is 35.5"" and 40.5"" hips.  I weigh just under 150 and am about 5'5"". I have a short torso, so that is a problem.  XL/XXL fit well.  I would not go smaller.  It did not roll when standing, but when I sat down the ribs(?) did roll up a bit, and that caused a band of doubly tight compression which was somewhat painful.  Of course, when I stood up again, the band remained rolled, requiring that I find a private place where I could make adjustments . . . until the next time I had to sit down.  : /<br />The ribs on the XL/XXL are about 10.25"" long."
3.0,Cute. Clips a little flimsy
3.0,"Very small, seems like a small in toddlers."
3.0,Loved these at first. Later she kept taking them off. Noticed a hard ridge where the sole and upper part of shoe meets. Tried to readjust the insole many times but doesn’t help. The ridge is very hard all around the shoe. No longer wearing.
3.0,"Well for reference , I'm 55 1/2 ish and 115lbs.  I ordered a size small.  The sleeves are just a tad too short and there is excess fabric in the small of my back.  I'm used to a more form fitting look, but not tight.  It's wearable nonetheless and I've decided to keep it, but it doesn't give me the look I was hoping for."
3.0,Not for me; looks cheap & gaudy. Three stars only because it has some weight to it. Amazon has much better comparable items.
3.0,"Buttons are very loose, they started falling off while I was just standing , u heard me I was doing nothing when the first fell. I've lost 3 on first wear."
3.0,I got a large and it fit great except for the chest area. It's super poofy. Maybe I need bigger arm pits and shoulders?
3.0,"This top fit as expected, but the quality wasn't what I'd hoped for.  My top arrived with a (noticeable) pulled thread on the sleeve and both of the shoulder seams look pulled.  I'm not confident this shirt will hold up well.  I'll be returning."
3.0,This dress is fun and colorful however I would have preferred cotton material as it is a rayon like material
3.0,Its OK and actually does come back after being flattened. It is worth the price.
3.0,"I'm 5'10"" and have a 36.5"" waist and 48.5 hips, I was hoping I could make these work since the fit is loose, but the XXL was too small in both the waist and the hips, as well as being too short.  I could physically get them on my body, but they squeezed everything from the thighs up.  Uncomfortable and unflattering.  They do look look and feel great off my body, so if you're smaller they're probably lovely"
3.0,Cute but I was not the biggest fan of the material
3.0,Like it but had 6&#34; of seam separation that will have to be fixed
3.0,"Love the design. They seem to be made well. Only problem I have is , because they have no backing , they fall out easily"
3.0,"Not even two months… my daughter wore these for just shy of 60 days and the bottom sole is ripping off and both toes have scuffed off top material, like it was incredibly thin. She’s not super rough on her shoes - she’s 6…. These were a disappointment."
3.0,KIND OF CHEAP. WISH THEY WERE A BIT MORE STURDY BEING THAT THEY ARE KIDS SUNGLASSES
3.0,It is too thin and I got saddle sore afterwards. The material is good but the padding is thin and not fitting me well in my case.
3.0,"I was surprised of how crinkly and kind of worn it looked.  I know that this is the style for some purses and these types of purses do sell well.  I was expecting something a little more attractive and more of a sheen to it, it is matte-d down.  Nevertheless, I will keep it because I can find a place for it in my wardrobe."
3.0,"I love these socks, It's just to bad they had to put the brand name on all of them!!!! :("
3.0,"Nice dress, but was not pleased to no zipper. It was hard getting in and out of dress. I need help, to get out."
3.0,Don’t really like the material
3.0,"This belt is quite small.  I ended up giving it to my tiny niece.  As others have said, the flower is quite large, but pretty nice."
3.0,I like the band and it fit well but shortly after getting it and wearing it everyday the paint is starting to wear off. Also the pins that hold the links on seem to come out and i have to put them back in often.
3.0,"Nice kids hats. fit a bit small, 6 and under..."
3.0,"I thought it would be like a bottle cap, it is not. It is larger and flat. Unfortunately, mine was scratched up when I got it too."
3.0,I like the idea of this product but it doesn't always stay in place.
3.0,Like the color changes; however each skein has a Minimum of 1 knot joining the yarn to make complete skein.  Will not order again.
3.0,This shirt is very pretty but runs a bit on the small side. I normally wear large (12-14) shirts and this one indicated it ran true to size so I ordered a large. It fits snug in the chest and arms. Should have bought an XL at least. I’m sure it will shrink in the wash (hand wash or dry clean only) so if you buy this shirt at least size up one size.
3.0,Looks the part for a costume maybe. Not for day to day wearing
3.0,They are very cute but smaller palm leafs then it looks in the pictures. Length hangs right
3.0,It is very transparent and it has a front pocket that is big and placed low. It does not look like the picture.
3.0,"Runs very small I normally would wear an xl (I like them a little baggy) I ordered this in xxl/xxxl it fits like an xl I was hoping for a little more pop to the shirt. It's very light /thin material, worth the price paid."
3.0,"The stones are nice, but the elastic popped within a month of wearing it. The elastic needs to be more durable."
3.0,"This is a very beautiful bracelet. The pendants are very shiny and cute it fits nicely. The only thing is, after wearing it for about 6 hours, the next time I put it on, it was almost like the teal straps became twisted or something. The pendants ended up facing down and I couldn't fix it. It didn't really bother me cause I could wear the bracelet inside out, but then, for example, one day the sparrow was facing down while the owls were the other way so it wasn't an easy fix. I probably could have returned the product or asked for a refund, but I love little projects so I want to use the pendants for something else. Maybe a necklace? Who knows. Anyways, I don't know if that was a fluke and it only happened to me, but the bracelet is beautiful regardless. Not TOO disappointed, but it might annoy some more than others.<br />Oh, and the teal parts of the bracelet look a lot more green than in the picture."
3.0,I do not like this. It is loose and therefore rides up in the most uncomfortable of ways. Will not be wearing again.
3.0,"Not really worth the money - you'd have to have pretty narrow glasses for these to fit over.  The hinge is a good idea, and I like the side shields, but they were just too narrow for any of my glasses."
3.0,"I rread the reviews and order4ed it too big.  I would suggest ordering your &#34;TRUE&#34; siize or maybe 1 size up for comfort.. I'm exchanging it, in fact i ordered the smaller size the day this one arrived.<br />it does stretch alot after wearing. If you have a really short torso more specifically really high hip/crest ie waistline, this may be uncomfortable when worm for an extended period of time."
3.0,Very cute but material is very thin
3.0,Sizes should be standard.  I needed a 10.5
3.0,If the metal piece were better connecting and made of higher quality i would rate higher. I do get compliments. People dont care them much anymore.
3.0,For me they looked prettier online
3.0,Didn’t realize it was a plastic mask with material on top. Fit a little big. Was going for sexy but ended up looking like a superhero
3.0,"I bought this in XXL based on another lingerie item I got from China, but this one is more true to size. It was too big and loose for this normal size large body. Material is very stretchy and forgiving.<br />* I purchased this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion."
3.0,Thought the dress was navy but it is royal blue. But really cute.
3.0,"A watch that brings the tough and utilitarian elements of gshock into a metal cased behemoth. Though this is the smaller model of this G-steel watch it is still very big. If only this watch was the size of other Casio multiband 6 wave ceptor watches, then I would replace this to be my only watch. Casio delivers a Time telling tank for the wrist."
3.0,Quality is good!<br />True to size ok for a perfection portion body type!
3.0,Love the print & it's so soft. Runs a little small.
3.0,Here's the problem. It's beautiful. The fabric is nice. The design is great.  It just runs horribly small.  I'm a &#34;large&#34; petite and usually wear a medium or large.  I ordered an extra large and couldn't even get it on.  So disappointed because It is a beautiful design and color. (I ordered the cream print).
3.0,"This dress is beautiful but not for me. I am a 38 G and in order to fit my top I got an XL. It’s good that I did too because the material on top is not very stretchy so the dress was very tight across my top. The rest of the dress though was huge on me. From the seam in the top half of the dress to the bottom was very loose. I didn’t like how the dress looked on me. It is usually hit and miss with dresses because I’m large on top and this is one of the misses. It was nice fabric, a bit heavy, perfect for chilly weather. The red color was really pretty too. I would recommend it to you to try."
3.0,Product arrived on time and but it arrived very dirty and sticky. Like it was sitting in storage for a year then got shipped without being wiped off
3.0,"The jacket is comfortable and has thermal quality. The basic problem is that it is not windproof as described, rather it is wind resistant. This may sound like I'm splitting hairs but there is a distinct difference. Wind resistant reduces the amount of wind which penetrates the garment but one can still feel the wind. Windproof eliminates all wind penetration and heat loss which accompanies that penetration. I would not reccomend this product below 50 F."
3.0,"Beautiful dress! Not exactly as picture. Sleeves are short and I managed to pop the elastic by just trying on. I hope alterations do not cost as much as I paid. Some reviews said they got an email about measurements, which I didn't get. Overall I'm looking to make the dress exactly how I vision"
3.0,"Sized for a small adult, not a child"
3.0,"Bought for my daughter, fits as expected.  The designs are cute, but the printing used on the fabric is very thick and looks like it may crack and ship away after a few washes."
3.0,A little big and I don't recommend using it on great pots.
3.0,I used some dish soap to stop the plastic from fogging but the moisture and soap kept making me skin itch. I can use them just for Phonics class and then I have to switch back to cloth mask.
3.0,I am overall satisfied with this purchase- it's good quality and an awesome price. It would just be nice if it were taller- my necklaces still drag on my dresser.
3.0,Returned because sizing was way off and these were huge on my 2.5 year old.
3.0,"The fabric works well, keeps my skin cool and dry. I have very small wrists and muscular arms, and the fabric is completely loose around my wrists. I just fold it back so it's tight, but it still doesn't cover what it is supposed to. I would consider this a great item for a fun color run, but not a necessity to stay cool when running."
3.0,"Pros: I liked that this dress runs shorter than most maxi dresses.  I am 5”2 and it falls right above my feet.  I liked that it was lightweight and not extremely see-thru (I got navy/white)<br /><br />Cons: this dress runs small and short for those you who are taller.  The material feels on the cheaper side.  Not very stretchy aside from the elastic waistband, which came undone in one spot after putting it on."
3.0,"Stinks, nice fit, but the chemical smell is overwhelming"
3.0,"I have a slightly larger head to begin with and purchased this hat to wear underneath my wigs.  This wouldve never worked, due to the fact that although, cute, very stylish and well constructed; There is a hard cardboard like rounding of the circumfrance of the cap which does not allow it provide any sort of give, movement or any stetch at all. Would've fit if were available in a size Large. Because the base doesnt stetch at all, had to return it.  Sorry, BUT ITS REALLY, REALLY CUTE!"
3.0,"The waist part was more snug than expected while the chest portion was loose. And the pleated parts stuck out a lot which gave my tummy areas a pooch of sorts. Not my actual tummy, but it looked that way because the fabric was folded and sewn in such a way that the material stuck out. I don’t know how else to explain it."
3.0,"Another okay also missing in my order.  Ilene Gonzales, Elko, NV  89801"
3.0,It’s nice but it doesn’t have a string to hold it around your neck
3.0,Too large for female wrist.
3.0,"This shirt is a bit on the smaller side. Nothing great about the material, it’s thin and just ok."
3.0,I wanted green. More like teal
3.0,"Very very cheaply made, very thin material and faded so bad on first wash"
3.0,It seems to be very fragile. I will post an update in 3 - 4 weeks
3.0,"It's ok. I'm big busted, and I don't know if that's why, but this shirt was MUCH shorter on me than pictured. Kind of a bummer because I wanted it as a layering piece."
3.0,More yellowish looking than gold
3.0,Great design but completely destroyed by kids in one season after everyday use. It can be expected but these could be sturdier.
3.0,"These look great, but the fans flip and 10 minutes into wearing them they are all over the place."
3.0,"These are 4$ each wool socks, so that's what you're getting. With that said i wore them a lot but with another sock under them because my precious feet got itchy when I wore just the wool sock.They kept those feet warm though, and that's why I bought them. I've washed them a couple times and they seem to be holding up to that."
3.0,Thee were alright but they dont really give much extension. I had two that I bought from the store that were more expensive but they have much more elasticity and give. Not the greatest extenders
3.0,"Felt a little skimpy, but wearable.  I like the colors."
3.0,"Such a cute charm, only problem is it is a lot smaller that the picture suggests."
3.0,"These are my daughters favorite, but she's worn them 4 times a d the soles are peeling off. I'm going to guess it back on to buy more time"
3.0,I like the design but material is cheap.
3.0,"i personally like this coat but its not great quality and a little small. its the kind of material that hair collects on and i shed like a german shepherd, Just an fyi. But, if youre looking for a cheap coat to throw on when you run outside..... this could fit your needs. it is comfy, thats 4 sho"
3.0,Not for the nose. Way too big
3.0,I ordered the small & I am 5'1 130lbs size D32<br /><br />The armpit areas fit loose and so does the choker
3.0,After just a short time the side seams holding sole to shoe started separating
3.0,"I love the shirt, quality and price are great. Issue is just the sizing.<br /><br />I usually wear an xl and I ordered a 3xl after seeing other reviews. It was still way too small."
3.0,"This ring was okay but the King Will product is better and nicely packaged. That said, King Will has raised prices for their product and I am not sure the difference is worth the price increase."
3.0,"I loved the fit to wear under my scrubs for work. Comfortable and enough to keep me warm but cool at the same time. but after just wearing for ONE DAY, I discovered a big hole! I was pretty excited about the product but doesn’t seem will last me long. I’m disappointed"
3.0,"Was too big, don't like how the seams lay, makes my head look like a square? Had to return..."
3.0,"These slippers are well made, but they run very narrow. My husband wears a 12 W and could barely fit his feet into that size (although the length was fine). The 13 W fits, but it's longer than necessary."
3.0,"My baby girl is tiny. Pretty much all 2t clothes are a little big on her, so I was surprised when this shirt wasn't long enough to go over her bottom like in the picture advertised."
3.0,"It's alright, it does leave a bit of a smell but over all it works."
3.0,"This looks like a comfortable outfit, soft and cozy but is actually cheap material and the fabril is more athletic, like legging material and sport long sleeve:(<br />Seems like an outfit from wish"
3.0,Look I read all the reviews and they are misleading one guy said made in England. Another said it wasn't a cheap Chinese knok off. This jacket is no diferant than the ones you can get for 40 to 50 dollers I was hoping it would not be by the reviews I took a picture of the tag.. CHINA.  And it is not waterproof you will get soaked after awail. And top top this perchance off it took 5 and a half weeks to get.
3.0,"These glasses are definitely cheap. They don't really work that well against the sun. Mine came pretty loose pretty quickly. I wouldn't recommend,"
3.0,"The upper thigh is cut very small and I'm not fat.  But, they stretch well enough and I can wear them."
3.0,The robe fits well and is comfortable but the zipper is suspect and I'll be surprised if it lasts very long. It is small and gets snagged easily in the material.
3.0,"I almost had a clean sweep this Christmas - having to return nothing.  This belt is so much smaller than it should be, though, that I have to return it and get a size 37-38 for my son who fits his 35 waist Levi's with room to spare.<br />The belt quality is fine, so far as I can see."
3.0,"The rectangular clips are nice, but the Hearts are not.  There is a lot of space between the crystals.  This space is filled with tiny bumps in the metal, not with crystals.  Be certain to enlarge your view so that you recognize that about 40% of the surface is only metal and not bling."
3.0,Based on reviews I ordered a size up and it was I’ll fitting. My shoulder and waist are small but my hips are wider. This shirt is so long that it’s tight over my hips and loose on the top. Will try to reorder a my actual size because it’s a cute shirt.
3.0,"Loved the color and length of this dress, but it just did not fit me right in the chest. I am 5'4 and this dress hit me right at the knee."
3.0,The fit was fine the quality was another thing.  Stitching was off and when washed the Bra part bunched up into a ball.
3.0,"This dress did not fit me well. I am 5'1&#34; and 115 pounds, curvy.  The dress fell very loosely around my mid-section and length hit below the knees.  I was expecting more of a body-con type fit.  I ordered a Small. The dress seems to be made however."
3.0,"These we nice while they lasted but that wasn't for very long. The inside seams came apart after wearing them for a couple months, and my child wasn't even walking."
3.0,I'm a bigger than usual guy and the XL still felt kinda slim on me.  Pockets are functional and the insulation is functional as well. Actually does keep you warm
3.0,"I like the color, fabric, fit, etc. But I didn’t realize there was no seam in the back. That gives no definition in the bum:("
3.0,"So I think these pants are made for people with thin legs and hips. The leg length is a little long, but if you wear a heal it would be perfect, the hip or butt area is a bit tight (I’m 5’2” and a fit 140) I would definitely suggest if you have curves and are on a cusp of a size to do the larger one, and the top of the pants are a bit lose so make sure you have a belt to go with it. Pretty sturdy material, but I haven’t even worn them to work yet so we’ll see how they last. It was a good choice for only $11 though"
3.0,"The way this was packaged in a huge envelope opening it along the tear line actually tore the band!  I am 72 with arthritis in my hands so not the strongest person in the world yet my opening the package ripped the material.  I have an old navy blue band made by Apple and comparing the products you can see why Apple charges a lot more.  Too bad I don’t dare wear it because while the tear is about an1/8th of an inch, tiny, I’m afraid with use it would rip all the way and I would lose my watch.  I had ordered another band from this company and will be sure to open it from the bottom and stay away from the contents.  Either that or stop eating my Wheatlies and Spinach."
3.0,Thin but comfortable! Nice for the price
3.0,The color was very vibrant and material was soft
3.0,It was cute but waaaaay short and tight.  It fit more like a shirt.
3.0,"Fabric folded oddly and I could never get it to lay flat. Colors were great, ended up tossing them."
3.0,"I found the material soft and comfortable.  The zipper does not budge.  The rib band is wonderful, it doesn't roll & it does not feel constricting.  It is easy to take off.<br />I tried wearing the straps in the regular H back style but they kept slipping off my shoulders.  The X back worked much better for me.  The only teeny tiny issue with the X back is the straps ride very close to my neck so are not covered by most of my tops.  If you have neck or shoulder issues it can create a little soreness getting it on.  The two little flaps of fabric at the top & bottom of the zipper are a nice touch but do make starting the zipper a little tricky.  Also you can see the zipper pull from under my shirts.<br />What I don't like is how the bra readjusts if I do more than walk.  I purchased the 5X-Large for 42H.  It goes on fine but if I do anything that involves side to side movement the bra readjusts itself along with my movements & I end up looking like I have an extra bulge just above the zipper.  The upper part of the bra moves slightly off center causing the top of one side to spill out a bit.  I don't feel a larger size would help because when I had the bra straps in the H position there wasn't enough support.  Lastly it did not keep things from bouncing. It did keep things reigned in enough for walking or basic weight lifting."
3.0,After reading the reviewsi was worried about it being huge but it was just large enough for what I was wanting (didn't want to carry and extra diaper bag). Didn't have weird smell or anything. The only thing is that the inlay has started to come apart from when I got it in December and it's February now.  Still love the bag though.
3.0,Got it as a gift. Haven't tried it personally but have used other eye shadows from this brand. Not the best quality but makes for a cute gift.
3.0,I loved the design however had issues with the magnet on the money clip messing up my debit card chips =/
3.0,"It's ok. I bought a xxl and usually wear an xl. It is still somewhat small. I bought it a couple of months ago and still haven't worn it. I have a belly and it makes me look pregnant. (Or I feel it, when I put it on.) If I wore some spanx, it might help. Definitely buy a size larger unless you don't have flaws to hide."
3.0,nice design but ran very small
3.0,So cute but daughter only wore it once because it shrunk
3.0,"Meh...It's cute and my daughter likes it, but the chain tangles quite a bit and the locket clasp tends to fail after the locket is opened and closed a few times. It has to be gently bent back into shape. It was well received, but I'd just be aware of these things. For the price, it was a good buy. I just wish it was a bit better quality so far as the clasp goes."
3.0,The shirt is a nice quality material with a snug fit. It is not a true white in color. It is off white/cream.
3.0,Meh.  Okay for something temporary
3.0,"I struggled with this suit and deciding on whether to keep it, but finally opted to return it. I am 5'2&#34; 145, and thought this suit was going to be perfect for my 5th anniversary trip.  When I found myself pushing and pulling at the bottom &#34;caging&#34; details- which appeared to be uneven from one side to the other, but overall much looser than I anticipated the detail would be- I knew it was time to give it up.  I even considered keeping it as a top, since the upper 3/4 fit really well.  But in the end I didn't need a sexy top I would never wear anywhere other than my vacation, I needed a hot swimsuit.  I would recommend using a thicker, heavier fabric to give the design the the kind of stretch and hold it really needs to make the bottom caging detail look great on everyone.  Also, the suit could have benefited from a higher cut leg- perhaps one less band cut out of the bottom?- for shorter women like myself so we don't lose what little leg we have!"
3.0,My niece loved her new mouse pad but it is very thin.  I wish the quality was better.
3.0,The coloring and designs were cheap and didnt look like the picturez.
3.0,"Why do these come up to my neck?!<br /><br />Okay. A bit of an exaggeration, but these are HIGH. Like, over my lower ribs high. I think I'd be okay with that if there was tummy control. As you can see my fupa came out to play. These shorts are Very unforgiving, so if you have worries about cellulite--even the indentation from my pubes is visible! They also do nothing at all for my not so blessed backside.<br /><br />The fit is weird also. Snug on my thighs, but if my waist were thinner it'd be a bit baggy.<br /><br />I also had to edit the green shorts to even show the color in my photos.<br /><br />With that being said, they're actually comfortable for me. But I only wore them casually for a quick Anime inspired cosplay. They're cute with a long tee/hoodie.<br /><br />I still wouldn't recommend these to anyone at all.<br /><br />Size 7jr jeans & 30in Waist"
3.0,I returned this item as I did not like the fabric and the color was very dull.  The picture doesn't really describe how this gown really looks and how it is made.
3.0,I bought this gift for my son to use for his Halloween costume and the music was alil love but cute toy.
3.0,Product  is good just that i order according  to  the chart n the  shirts are lose they  dont compress.
3.0,I bought this because I wanted something cute and sparkley for the upcoming holidays.  It arovved and it was great the balls are a good size not too big.  I wore it twice and most of the Diamonds had already fallen out.  Just to be clear this is just for 1 earing not 2 or 3.
3.0,This item runs way to small. 3 sizes to small
3.0,"They are not for me, can't get used to bi focals."
3.0,Kind of on the larger side
3.0,"Runs extremely small, not only that but the zipper was broken and it zips weird in the front, cute costume but sadly had to return"
3.0,Love the look of these dislike that the bail will Not fit my 1.5 mm chains without the removal of the clasps. Very small bail & inconvenient.
3.0,Not super bright and the battery didn’t last very long
3.0,Love the fit of the jeans and the style.  However I marked them low due to the difficulty removing the overwhelming chemical smell of fabric.  I have been reluctant to wear even after washing many times.  Of course you can't return them after washing but I  thought surely after a couple of washes the chemical  smell  would  be  gone.  Not so.
3.0,Mala calidad no la recomiendo
3.0,La tela no es de buena calidad. La pijama se ve barata como usada..
3.0,"I love the feel and the texture but this was too small and has a tear in the seam of the inner skirt, as if someone else had this before me, tried it on and it ripped"
3.0,"They are pretty big/round on my 7 and 6 year old's faces. The arm also broke after VERY limited use, but I was able to tape it to make them work. They are just for a Harry Potter Halloween costume, so they will work."
3.0,The finish on the buckle wears off very easily.
3.0,"The material is thin, and did not hold its shape.  Very tight in the shoulders and stomach."
3.0,"Unfortunately too large, but i like the material."
3.0,I loved the fit of the large in black however when I ordered the large in white it was too small. I usually wear a medium. This brand runs 1-2 sizes too small depending on color.
3.0,I thought these would be more durable when being outdoors but when i took it hiking and was crawling thtough the forest they ripped.
3.0,"It’s a nice cardigan, looks nice on and feels comfortable and warm but it sheds. I feel like a cat, everywhere I sit, sure enough there is always strings from the cardigan left behind me. I would not recommend."
3.0,The material is very thick so my son sweet at lot if he use it for school
3.0,I wsih the fabric was a little more substantial.
3.0,"Right out of the box I see a huge discoloration on the toe.  If this was crafted by a real ""artist"" they would NOT put such a disturbing mark on the front of any shoe. The second big flaw is that the toe sections were NOT sewn in to the sole to match the other shoe/sandle. As u can see in the pictures, the left toe piece of leather wasn't gathered/cut right before sewing into the sole so it sticks way out and the leather has to fold itself irregularly making it look like some amateur sewed this together.  Quite dissapointing for a $100 sandles. now what am I going to do.  I feel ripped off because if I return them it will cost me another $50 (restocking penalty) plus if I did return them they won't refund money for sandles that have scratch marks on soles due to walking on cement.<br />And for the third most disturbing flaw is that they didn't bevel the edges of the leather pieces or soften them in any way. This is most important because they are cutting into my ankles (so I beveled the leather uppers so I dont have to wear bandaids). It allows the leather to slide past eachother (and ur skin) more easily and the leather to feel softer and look like a true artist made these not just pumping these out of a factory and calling them ""hand made"" because an actual person stitched them together. If u look at all shoes from that stand point, all shoes are handmade.<br /> I am very dissapointed at the lack of quality, I'm sorry but I'm not, there's alot to to say about what's wrong with these. But they are real leather,  thick leather,  like #8 leather (1/8"").<br />They do hurt my feet out of the box (other then blistering my skin)  but that's to be expected (for one thing the edges aren't beveled and I have to wear bandaids because of this) because of unworked leather. If they would have taken the time to soften the leather & beveled the edges they wouldn't hurt the feet out of the box.  If softened they would feel more like a cloud (almost like suede).<br />Bottom line is that I will have to break these sandles in which will void the return policy (that I would have to pay for)  anyway.  So its a lose lose situation.<br />Oh one more thing, as u can see in my pictures, they are very very thin in width so buyer beware.<br />UPDATE- Two Hours Later:  the stitching has broken in the toe area due to walking. If the recess for the stitching was cut deep enough normal wear would not have torn/ripped the stitching so fast. So that's what I'll  have to do very soon.  That is to take the stitching out, cut deeper grooves into the soles for the stitching to set into deep enough NOT to be so easily ripped/worn out thru normal use, and then I'll re-stitch them myself.<br />UPDATE<br />- One Day Later:  As far as the shoe mis-match I took it upon myself to remedy the problem since their quality control guidelines and (artisenship) is again inadequate.  See pictures, I had to take a large section out if the left shoe 👟  so it would come close to matching the right show.<br /> Emergancy Alert ! Just got back from ER because while wearing this sandles I lost traction on the steps and fell the entire flight of stairs in our house. I broke 2 ribs and somehow gashed my leg (?). So, I just got done mod'ing these sandles again to put 1/8"" thick real rubber soles on the existing leather soles, pictures attached.<br /> Obvious I must (and do) like the basic design of these sandles or I wouldn't be going thru all this trouble. Plus I dont want to throw away $100 shoes. I'd rather spend a little more and make them GREAT shoes.<br />  Next I'm replacing the inferiorly stamped buckles (20¢each) with ""real"" solid brass buckles ($2-$3 each). Thats my next update.  Unless amazons takes this review down first, I will keep updating this post.<br /> These sandles may have at one time been made by a company/person who actually cared about quality but now these are made for (Assumingly) profit and quality has been compromised for the almighty dollar (💲). I'm not trying to destroy this manufacturer.  I'm letting the consumer know what to expect before/after purchasing. That's all.<br />UPDATE AGAIN:<br /> The upper part ripped right out of the sole and I had to stitch it back together the best I could.  See picture.  I wore these sandles for less the 2 months and (if I wasn't able to fix them)  I would have had to throw a $100 pair of shoes out.  Buyer beware, these r not worth $10 let alone $100. I just don't know how long I can keep repairing these sandles.  R they even worth it ? I keep asking myself that.<br />UPDATE 2<br />Yes, I know,  but I bought another pair to modify. I LOVE THE STYLE of these so, now that I know what to expect I can modify these more easy.  This time I stitched/secured all the straps to the soles before I glued rubber soles to the bottom preventing any slips and falls and eliminating broken rids as in what happened the 1st time. Comment: these are wonderful sandles but they are not built to last (hence my notifications ). I added more pictures to show my progress. I hope people how buy these realize that thay a ""fall hazard"". Soles made of leather can be very slick and they will make u fall under certain conditions (I broke two ribs slipping on the steps).  So PLEASE beware.  I'm adding even dumbdeire pictures to help u make the proper decisiona.<br />UPDATED AGAIN 10-1-2022<br /> I DO LOVE these sandles.  The last 5 pictures are the 2nd pair where I did sew ib all the upper straps to the sole again.  I replaced the cheap stamped buckles for solid brass ones. I also glued real rubber soles on to the sandles so as not to fall again. I can walk down steps with security now. I did keep the ""natural look of leather on this 2nd pair and just spent hour working the leather by hand until they became soft.  The toe section on thus pair isn't as bad as my 1st pair so I intend to keep them just as they are.<br /> The 2 biggest complaints (well maybe 3) is the cheap stamped buckle and the uppers not being sewn into the soles.  And maybe the fact that there is no rubber soles on them.  Hmmmm wait a minute, that's the entire sandle.  Hmmm. You decide<br />Dave C Stout"
3.0,Kind of on the heavy side. But quality pieces
3.0,"Very difficult to open, I had to tug at it by wrapping q-tips on each end of just one of them. I haven’t even tried to open anymore so far since I’m enjoying wearing the rose gold color. Considering I got 6 pieces of jewelry for my septum it was definitely worth it. They’re a bit small, so be careful with opening them!"
3.0,"Comfortable shoes, very cute. Material is cheap and creases/wrinkles easily but still okay shoes. I'm a 7.5 and they fit great."
3.0,"Took a chance.  I'm not really plus size, but you never know!  Anyway, it was way too big.  And the material wasn't what I expected or wanted. I returned it."
3.0,I do like this dress but very tight in the bust.  I considered keeping it but would be very uncomfortable.  I loved everything else about it though.
3.0,The large size pants are meant for someone well over 6 feet with a pretty large waist....maybe a linebacker?
3.0,Thin and see through. Not as cute on as expected.
3.0,These are small and after a while they turned. The shape is also not very defined.
3.0,"The ring fits beautifully. It is very shiny and could easily pass for the real thing . I had two problems with these rings. My ring sizer said I was an 8 so I ordered an 8. It is way too big. It didn't fit at all like I was expecting it to.  The second  problem that I have is that the plating wears away after a few weeks of wear, and they start leaving a ring around your finger like the cheaper metals do. I received this product at a discount or completely free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. I did not receive any compensation for this review or am I required to leave a good review in order to  receive  the product. My review is based on my own honest opinion of the product after I have tried it.  As a longtime customer of Amazon, I also depend on others' honest reviews for purchases. The discounted rate of a product does not have any  influence over my personal opinion."
3.0,"Dress arrived earlier than expected. Color was as described and material was light & flowy. I ordered a Medium based on the chart however the chest was too tight, as well as the neck. I would try for the next size up but having to pay an additional shipping fees is stopping me from doing so."
3.0,"do not stay up, slip inside shoes"
3.0,cute for price but I didn't order larger like the recommendations because I thought I wouldn't possibly wear an 8.5. Too tight to wear.
3.0,I LOVE THE DESIGN!!!🥰<br />BUT IT'S A LITTLE TIGHT.. FROM EAR TO EAR
3.0,"I wish they could've worked out as they are labeled for slim calves. I have slim legs, size 0 and 105 lbs., and they were still loose and baggy at the opening. I ordered my regular shoe size and even though I have narrow feet they were very tight on the toes. Sadly had to return them."
3.0,"Cute design, but pants were too small, but the shirt was too big. Also, pants looks more like pajamas and lost the color quality after one wash."
3.0,No me encantaron las pantallas. No se veian tan bonitas cuando las recibi
3.0,Gloves were intended to be part of my wedding attire but they have little frays and look cheap. I have tiny wrists and these gloves are very form fitting.  I expected these gloves to be longer.
3.0,I don’t usually write reviews but I feel I need to let everyone know this is 100% see-through.  I bought the light blue and the material is very soft and flows well but since it is so see-through I will need to wear something underneath it which totally defeats the purpose of having a cool flowing sundress. I will keep it and wear a cami and leggings under it in the fall but I’m very disappointed
3.0,The purse is nice however the wallet stopped zipping after 2 days of use.
3.0,The dress looks nice but in person the print is blah.
3.0,The blouse is pretty and sheer not true to size according to chart. Snugg fitting under arm hole and bust areas ordered a medium too small will re-order in a large
3.0,Eh for the price you can't expect so much. I did put through one wash so far and a lot of the seams loosened resulting in string hanging. They're cute though
3.0,"Bought these for my husband as a replacement for ones he had for several years.  He noticed they are not made the same as before but did as he expected, only didn't last as long as the original pair he had years before."
3.0,The plastic is soft and easy to break.
3.0,Blouse is pretty but not to size . Large is more likely me a medium
3.0,These run small. I purchased a medium and they were pretty tight.  I feel like the padding is too far back (like wearing the seat in your underwear)  and not in the areas (inner crotch/ butt bone) where your pressure points during spin class are.  Returning and trying for the ones in a yoga pant or yoga short instead. Was hoping these would work better since they were underwear style.
3.0,I like that the item came with three and a package for the price that I paid I like the colors but the items are not true to fit if you wear medium do you need to get a large for it to fit
3.0,the picture of shirts are very clear to see
3.0,"These will work for a child perhaps however I could not get them on, the fingers were too tight. They are a very vibrant green and have fur and probably good for a child to wear. I will take them apart, add some fabric on the fingers to make them larger and then they should fit. I would not be able to wear them until then."
3.0,"I guess I got what I paid for, but I admit I did expect better from Russell. They got the metal YKK zipper right, but that’s about it. The inner fleece-like material rubs off on my shirts, there are dangling threads everywhere, and today I just discovered a gap between the left sleeve and cuff. I’ve barely worn this sweater. Big disappointment."
3.0,"This dress is beautiful.  I was apprehensive as to how it was going to fit, I'm usually a size 8-10 in dresses ( I am 5'4 and a 147 pounds with a small bust). The highest dress size that was available at time of my order was between a 6-8. The dress fit, however it was a little tight in the bust. ( which is saying a lot because I am not well endowed in that area). I thought that the black slip under the dress was too short for my taste. If I wanted to, I think I could have bought a silk black slip though and made it work.  The floral embroidery was beautiful, however there were a lot of a loose threads throughout the dress that made me nervous ( I didn't want to cut them, and then the flower unravel). Overall, I'm sending it back and perhaps aiming for the next size up when/if it becomes available."
3.0,Stones looked dyed.
3.0,Bought septum nose rings and they are entirely too small to put in. Bummed
3.0,Didn’t stay on as well as advertised when working out
3.0,"Beautiful but not fit well, they run too big"
3.0,"Fits my waist and length is perfect. These pants are really baggy. I'm a fit guy, my legs would have to be 2x the size they are to have these pants fit right. I'm not going to return them and I can use them but I'm not sure That I would order again. There is nothing wrong with the quality. Maybe Buy 2, one size smaller that you think you need and return the one that does not fit well."
3.0,NEED TO REVISIT THEM.  DID NOT SEEM TO REDUCE THE NIGHT GLARE THE WAY I EXPECTED.
3.0,Disappointed in the size of the scarf.  Color is as expected
3.0,The bottom fit just fine but the top was too small. I probably should have went with an XL
3.0,Just had to return as my wrist was too large.
3.0,"Pretty earrings but very small.  Hard to put on and have them latch.  Bought 2 sets, but only 2 out of the 4 worked...had tot mix and match to get a good set.  Good thing I bought 2 sets."
3.0,Says unbreakable these are light weight nothing to them seem decent but the breaking point may be less than described
3.0,"Seemed nice and fit over my glasses. Blocked the Maui sun well. However, today they split into two pieces at the bridge. Just a &#34;snap&#34; as I took them off. Unfortunately, it happened just a few days after the amazon return period ended."
3.0,Colors are nice but its super thin and doesnt fit face well.
3.0,Order a size down. They come bigger than listed size.
3.0,cheap which is good but a fair number of them have hard green areas and always tear when trying to put them on.
3.0,"Photo clearly shows paper money easily fitting in - NOT so, you have to fold money.  Clasp works better than others tried but still don't expect 11 cards to fit in and case to close.  I am only keeping it because I am desperate."
3.0,Not warm at all. Ok as a liner
3.0,Pretty but run small. Therefore if you have curves and up size is recomend it. See thru in dark color.
3.0,too big to look real.  If you like bling I guess its ok.
3.0,"Cute glasses. The pink are not what I expected, they are very light pink and you can see my eyes through them, not mirrored like the blue. Seem kind of on the cheap side. I wouldn't be upset if I lost or broke them for what I paid."
3.0,It's a very pretty dress but it is not true to size. Runs small
3.0,The dress did not suit my body type and I was going to return it. I'm 5'1 and hourglass shaped. I have a large bust and hips. It was longer than I expected and it may just look better if i got a smaller size. But nevertheless I contacted them and they refunded me and let me keep the dress as a gift.  I would buy from them again soley because of the great customer service. The dress it self is a perfect fall dress. The material is nice and soft. I just wish it would have flattered me more!
3.0,"Boots seemed nice enough and came in a wide - which I needed. Not for deep snow use and water resistant but not waterproof. Liked the zipper in the front, this old lady needs that. However, I was disappointed with the tread on the sole. Pretty shallow tread and I can't afford to be slip sliding around in the snow.  Not something to wear in wet slush either."
3.0,Heavy shoes
3.0,"I like the handle, which is why i bought it. But it is heavy, a bit too big and does not hold all my stuff comfortably. Difficult to find things in there. However it does have 2 pockets inside that hold my ipod and my phone, and they are easy to find."
3.0,Cheaply made but super cute
3.0,I bought this because its adorable and it was on sale. I got the 12-18 months. My daughter is 14 months right now and this was rather big on her. The onesie was okay except the sleeves kept falling down. The shorts were huge! I decided not to return and to hang on to it until she grows in to it. It is super cute though!
3.0,"Cheap, but it works and the see thru is interesting"
3.0,I had to return it. Pink Queen was very nice and prompt in processing the refund in a week after they received it.
3.0,dislike = to thin to stop  discharge  of covid droplets
3.0,Good for the price but very ooor finishing especially in the neck/hoodie part. Fleece lining is nice and cost and great for winter weather.
3.0,This is a early fall late spring hat.  It looks OK and fits OK but its not warm.
3.0,Good quality but a bit small in the chest area and I don't have big boobs so I had to return it.
3.0,Said mens but more like womens size
3.0,The top was way too small if I were to tighten my neck strap more my boobs would've fell out the bottom 😕 bottoms fit good though
3.0,"Sorry, but these are not comfortable.  They pinch my temples, the nose pieces do not move to adapt, the glasses overall are very stiff.  I've used a couple of other brands of inexpensive reading glasses and they were markedly better than these.  What I do like is that I could get three the same color."
3.0,Too tight for a big guy.
3.0,The right side pocket is sewn together so it’s not usable but comfy and fit as expected so I will deal w that...I bought my daughter a pair too and her pockets are fine.
3.0,These socks come up over my knees so they are basically useless. I am short (5’1)  but haven’t had this issue with other brands. I am bummed because they are a thinner material than other socks I have which I like.
3.0,They broke way to easy
3.0,Needed for sweat in super heat - it's OK but not worth the price tag - should have stuck to my bandana
3.0,It only fits people with small head.
3.0,"This is a great giveaway for animated parties.<br />The lights are awesome, but the arms of the glasses broke very easily."
3.0,Doesn't fit as expected in the pictures. Straps are too large and it isn't a slim fit
3.0,Just OK..
3.0,I gave it three stars because it runs extremely large. Overall it is a cute shirt. I bought another color in a smaller size (my usual size) and it still is big.
3.0,"Very beautiful design and my son loved it,  however after 1 single day of running and swimming at the pool, my child's toe popped through the material. He was wearing the correct size. However, I believe if the sole was thicker and came up more at the front of shoe by the toes, the stretch material on the shoe wouldn't have ripped."
3.0,"The length on these is great, but they don't really have a good grip. Basically, slip off the head and/or face without staying in place."
3.0,These earrings are beautiful but they are NOT sterling silver.  The ones I got are gold color.
3.0,"What I like about them is that they are sturdy and good looking, and they dont require sewing. What I don't like about them is that they don't stay closed.  The issue with this is, whatever you put them on to close will fall open at inopportune times, and they are heavy, so if the look you want is closed and these come open then they bend the garment under their considerable weight and then the area is not only not closed but wide open. I bought them for an event but ended up just taking them off so that my collar would stay mostly closed by its self.<br />Possibly you could get some pliers and force them to close but that was not an option at the time."
3.0,"This is two pieces of leather, folded-over, and sewn along the edge.  Unlike a traditional money clip, which has a “clip”, or something to hold it together, you simply roll and stuff bills inside.  You can place cards on either side.  Though there’s nothing to really hold things in place, with the stitching around the edge, it works ok.  It measures 2.75” X 3.75”.  Logo is embossed on the front.  Made in China."
3.0,"Not as cute in person as it appears to be a little fitted, but the dress is pretty straight.  I use it for running around the house, but probably wouldn't were if I were going somewhere."
3.0,They look really good and flattering. But feel kind of thin. I definitely don’t trust them fully when I’m working out in them. I’ve only washed them a handful of times but some of the threads  are coming undone.
3.0,"I wear a medium in everything, but a small probably would've been a better call in this case.  Decent quality, but pretty baggy in the body and sleeves."
3.0,This was a gift that I purchased for someone
3.0,Bad quality lasted one day.  Sent back.
3.0,"The pink skirt isn’t even a true pink, it’s like a washed out mauve which was pretty upsetting since I rlly wanted a pink skirt. I got a medium but I’m usually a small and the medium fit ok. I got the same skirt in purple and black and it weirdly fit better than the pink as well, so overall I’m disappointed"
3.0,needs more inseam
3.0,"Not the round-shaped, pale green stone that I thought I ordered. I was prepared to have this returned for a refund, but decided to keep the ring anyway. I do think that the seller needs to note in the advert that the cut and color of the stone may vary. The ring I received was way off from item description."
3.0,Looks beautiful but after a few weeks (I used twice in a week) it is almost disintegrated for by the sides. It is not very good quality
3.0,The dress is beautiful but it had the weirdest proportions I've ever seen. It's so long it could probably fit any WNBA player. The built in bra is small but the material for the bodice is big. I don't know who would fit the proportions of this dress.
3.0,They were bigger then they should have been and had to fix some of the stitching
3.0,Love the shirt. Its a tight fit. So if your an xL get a xxL.
3.0,Really wanted to love this but it was just too short. I’m 5’6” and the front portion barely covered me.
3.0,The material and pattern was nice but didn’t like the fit as it seemed cut weird under bust.
3.0,It was okay. Most dresses that have a low front have a low back too.
3.0,"The top is OK. I will keep it, however it was more expensive than my Oalka workout tops (they are $18.99 on Amazon) and not quite as well made. The bra pads are very soft and small. I have added comparison pictures of a normal size bra pad that came in my Oalka's and the small, thin and soft white pads that came in this top. I replaced the pads by purchasing replacement pads so it is better. I also added a picture of a dark blue shirt I have and the one I bought that is supposed to be dark blue but it is really grey. Since they don't have any 'grey' shirts, I'm thinking that they are calling the grey one dark blue. It sure doesn't look like the color that is posted on their site in Amazon, either."
3.0,"Don't get these if you're allergic to nickel. Besides that these are pretty cheaply made. Still looks cute, great for a costume/theme outfit, but not regular wear."
3.0,My second attempt to buy these for my 5 yr old.  First ones I bought a size up as everyone suggested.  Too big and the flower one had an awkward open fold to the shoe when she walked.  Second attempt was the sparkly rhinestone one in her normal size and was way way way too narrow.  Now I have to return these and spend more time trying to find a damn sparkly shoe.  Help.
3.0,Peeling paint
3.0,"The shoes is not the same as the picture , metal with steve madden on the shoe lace is no where to be found. Im dissapointed."
3.0,"Its pretty and worth the price , but the stones arent as visible as the image"
3.0,It is a bit small for adult face.
3.0,"These straps are good. They do their job. However, sometimes it can rip your socks, or tear some fabric threads off of your sock. Be aware of that."
3.0,"Other than the thumb is too long, these are decent gloves."
3.0,"The gold performed well however the silver were poorly made.  out of the 4 pair, none of them worked well enough to make a complete set of silver.  The clips would not work and the plunger (for lack of a better word), either would not work at all or would fall out."
3.0,I order a medium and it fit my son like a small and then ordered  a large which fit him like a medium
3.0,"Color is way lighter than the photo.  Still cute.  But if you are getting the blue one excepting a true blue color, then dont purchase it.  The color is more like a bright blue."
3.0,I do like the belt and the way it works but I've had it 3 months and where it loops through the buckle the stitching is broken about an inch long on both edges hope I can get it fixed.
3.0,"There was not enough boob coverage, the nipple was almost able to be seen through the crochet part; very little solid material"
3.0,I wear a medium in everything and this medium is too small. I know it’s supposed to be form fitting but order a size bigger than you usually wear.
3.0,"I am usually size XS or small, but the chart provided in the photos indicated I would need a medium. I went with the medium and it was way too big"
3.0,It wasn’t what it looked like in the photo  The photo looked more like a sweater
3.0,"My Lapis Lazuli arrived in good condition and timely, but I expected some BLUE in it and it has maybe 1 spec/maybe not - am disheartened, although for some reason, I've decide to keep it - like a little puppy that is mismatched from its litter.  I still want a BLUE Lapis Luzuli - I'm sure another person would not be pleased and give them a 1 star aft best."
3.0,Strap broke off. Is there anyway to exchange it? Loved my wallet purse. 3202 David Way Cottonwood CA 96022 S. MillerStone
3.0,Too small. Quality is not very good ether. Would not recommend.
3.0,Bought it for my friend. I didn't expect it to be so hard. I accidentally sat on it and it completely cracked in half! My laser cut one didn't even bend!
3.0,My 9 year old daughter uses this for guitar and it works perfectly
3.0,"Obviously cheap, very thin, but decent for what they cost."
3.0,The bracelet broke on the moment I tried to stretch it. The necklace will hopefully hold up for a litte longer though.
3.0,"sizing runs very small. Check measurements of sizing chart carefully. When you get this in, note that it does wrinkle and will need to be pressed to remove the wrinkles or take to a dry cleaner. Trendy and cute.."
3.0,"I'm 5'2"", 102 lbs. Ordered XS and still too small for me. I usually wear XS, but this one runs small. You should order one size up."
3.0,"I thought this would be warmer an made out of thicker material. It fits well, and i'm sure it would be great for the fall, but not true cold weather conditions."
3.0,Great t shirt. Perfect for my son. Ranger fans of course!........  ..........  .. 1 2 1 1 1 1 1
3.0,It's super cute but the stars are sharp.
3.0,Ordered the dress with a pink background and received the version with a white background. This happened twice. So infuriating. Otherwise the dress itself is decent but the one I got is essentially red white and blue which is not the look I am going for.
3.0,Too much push. I must bend over as I'm working as a bartender. This bra helps to flop them completely out!
3.0,"I'm 5ft 2in and weigh 185 lbs, I ordered 2x. The bottoms fit great but the top is way too small. My bra size is 38ddd and this fit like a 40d. Super cute just wish the top was larger."
3.0,Tight and short but it was cute! Just not right for the occasion.
3.0,"I normally wear a small. I bought this in a S/M and it is huge on me. Laying flat, it measures 24&#34; from armpit to armpit."
3.0,"The dress fitted ok. I am disappointed however that I received the wrong colour. I certainly did not place an order for the colour I received.  Given that I live in Georgetown, Guyana, it is very difficult and costly for me to return my order."
3.0,It was ok. I returned because not sure how it would wash and keep shape. It was also too small.
3.0,"Gave it 3 stars, the outfit is cute HOWEVER the smell is truly unbearable. I am going to try and wash it to see if it goes away but after the first wash it still has that strong chemical smell. Disappointed because the outfit is nice but with a smell like that I am not going to be able to wear it until it goes away."
3.0,"It’s cute, but it’s over priced and you might not get the one you want"
3.0,They are very pretty but don’t dangle properly. I have bought. Small piece that I am inserting into each pair so they will dangle and not feel stiff.
3.0,the wallet is more sepia than gray
3.0,Very tight fitting. Bought them for work but they were not appropriate due to fit.
3.0,"The locket is fantastic but the chain is horrible.  After two hours of wear, it was discolored and broke at the clasp."
3.0,"This top is ok. The size runs large, so order down. I received a Small and the armholes are kind of big. Also, the photos make the material look like a brushed burn-out kind of fabric, and it absolutely is not. It's a solid color shirt (white, in my case). I was hoping it would be the material that's actually depicted in the photos."
3.0,It works good. Does not show the date.
3.0,These are my go-to beach glasses. I don't care if they get lost or swept away in the surf. They block the sun and are cheap.
3.0,Very comfortable material. Sleeve length is perfect but body length goes to the waist. For an XL I expect the body length to be much longer than that.
3.0,"This hat is ok, but it does NOT look like the one in the picture. The ""Rad Dad"" is much smaller font size. And it's not embroidered on , it's like a flimsy iron on decal I think. Will update if it falls off completely lol<br />Atleast the actual base hat seems ok/nicer quality"
3.0,Too thick. Did not fit my nose hole.
3.0,"It's pretty lose ,the ears are a bit odd . Also made me ich , I'm gonna try and clean it out and see if it's the powder ."
3.0,"Was to small for me, like loosefitting clothes, but it was nice otherwise."
3.0,"you get what you pay for but its a thoutful gift, a nice scripture and the rhinestones are very pretty"
3.0,The size and color perfect! But I wish it was thinner
3.0,"I ordered the pink.  It was a bright pink and I guess I had visualized a softer pink.  The gats fit well and were made from a soft material.  My g.baby was very pleased to have a hat like her mommy.  The balls on top I thought were very real looking in a not good way. My dil liked them.  They looked like real people hair not animal fur.  My dog got very excited when he saw them.  Excited in a &#34;this is something I need to kill&#34; way.  Fortunately the balls are pinned on and are easily removed. I removed them in order to not scare the g.baby but her mom took them with the hats because she said it's the style and she thought they were cute.  (Maybe she would like a Daniel Boone coonskin hat, who knows? Was that a coin, looked more like a squirrel to me.) I digress....all in all I would say this was a very good value but if I had to do over I'd not order the pink."
3.0,I only use for the shower.  Very cheap and not sure I would use them for anything else.
3.0,"Fits me really awkward. I’m 5’2 about 108 pounds, usually wear a XS/S and a 32DD. The shoulders look like their padded bc the dress doesn’t fit properly at the top. However the material and color are really nice!!"
3.0,"This is a great shirt, fits good, however the color on the sleeves is different from the picture we ordered. When choosing something because of the color this is a disappointment. We live too far to be able to return it, as it would be too expensive and I did not see a way to contact the seller."
3.0,"Even though my reading glass needs are between 1.5 and 2.0 diopter, I sometimes find it necessary to have a bit more power for small print.  I had hoped when I purchased these adjustables, I could walk around the office wearing them and adjusting the lenses on the fly.  But, I find the field of vision to be a bit too constricting for everyday wear."
3.0,"They fit well, but the material is like sheer curtains. With leggings it's okay, but they're super staticy"
3.0,Ordered the right size but was super small.  Very cute though
3.0,One of the 3 clasps on the chain didn't want to close an open.
3.0,little large but the material is cool.
3.0,"good for the price, just need to be ironed"
3.0,"Great size and material,  but very hard to close.  Struggled with them for half an hour before I was able to get the clasp to click into place."
3.0,Dress is very comfortable but very see through. It’s fine as a beach cover up but if you want to just wear it you will need a slip or something under it. I will probably just use over my swim suit or around the house.
3.0,"They seem true to size, but I’m very disappointed that you can’t wash these in the washer no no drying in a dryer. They are yoga pants, not a ball gown!"
3.0,"The stone fell off as soon as I put the necklace on. I glued it back on. Other than that is pretty ,so I kept it."
3.0,Seemed a little tight on my face. Maybe I just have a big melon? Real light tint on lenses and I ended up squinting from the sun while they were on. I would suggest getting a darker tint if you plan on using at the beach or reading by the pool. Bought a similar looking pair at Walmart (not guess of course) for $8.88. The Walmart pair had a darker tint and fit my face better.
3.0,"These are cheaply made, but pretty. It lasted me about a week before beads started breaking."
3.0,The yellow isn’t like the one shown. And these earrings are HEAVY. Cute otherwise.
3.0,Nice sweat shirt but I sold it to a friend because the size was not an XL but more like a medium
3.0,"I ordered a medium like I normally wear in leggings.  These are huge in the waist and crotch. Like pulled up my chest and the gusset was mid thigh. I will keep them to wear under my clothes in the winter, but they are not good for working out because you have to adjust them so frequently.  Super soft and the side pockets are deeper than most."
3.0,BOUGHT AS A CARDIGAN FOR CHURCH. DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT STILL SEARCHING. THE PUFF AT THE SLEEVES WASA BIT MUCH.
3.0,My wife loves it but the plastic piece at end broke off so it hard to keep charms in place
3.0,"Wanted to love these, they are domed not flat disks,"
3.0,This was a nice bracelet (heavy weight and pretty). I had to return because it was much too large. If you have a 6&#34; or smaller wrist this will not work for you.
3.0,Very cute but I cut almost 3 inches off bc they were so long. (They looked like capris)
3.0,"Nothing wrong with the product, except I ordered it for my adult son and it was hard to see thru the website that they were going to be too small for him. On the good side, they fit me perfectly hahaha"
3.0,Much lighter and cheaper material than I expected. I bought this as a Christmas present for my adult daughter but returned it when I saw how cheaply made it was.
3.0,"My son's favorite show! Super soft shirt. Be careful when removing size sticker, it also removes some of the shirt print :("
3.0,No  recibí el color q esperaba pero igual me voy a quedar con este color
3.0,"Unless you are on your honeymoon in the Bahamas going to a candle lit dinner, this dress might be a little much. The side slits go so low you cannot wear underwear, and the back hole goes so high you cannot wear a bra. The front is not a v-neck, but goes all the way up to your neck. Although the material and the cutouts are rather flattering, and the dress itself is comfortable, when I tried it on, I could not imagine myself wearing it anywhere..."
3.0,"Bought these for a sports bra and an unlined bra, they work well enough without adding too much pad. The rating is because when I washed them, they started coming apart. That means they're not made with very good materials. I will give them a quick sew around the edges to keep the layers together but they should not be coming apart at all."
3.0,To expense can find for one or two dollar
3.0,They were to short for me. I gave them to my little sister and she likes them.
3.0,I ordered this charm to fit on my Pandora bracelet. It is to small to slide on my bracelet. Now-I have a beautiful charm that is just sitting in the package.  I wish that this possibility had been explained before I placed my order. I still would like to be able to put a charm like this one on my bracelet because it is my birth stone.
3.0,"Quality seems fine, but it said 7 Packs, actually is only 6 pack, don’t know what happened to the last pair.."
3.0,Love the overall look and fit of this sweater but the color is not even close to the pink that is advertised.  It's more of a orangish/pink or coral color.  Really wanted the pink that is shown.
3.0,Shirts are great for workouts
3.0,"They are cute, cheap and practical although my early walker shred through the front within just a couple wears."
3.0,"The main zipper on these didn't feel great from the beginning. Now, just two months after I started wearing them it broke."
3.0,"the way this bag is shipped causes the horns to refuse to stand up, ive applied pressure to them to try to flatten them out and nothing helps. they just stick downwards and the chain on the bag just feels really cheap as well and i feel like im going to break it if i so much as even snag it. its not the worst, but its just not good."
3.0,The sleeves do not go all the way to the wrist but are not supposed to be short
3.0,It was to small it's more for a child and not for an adults.  I was getting it for my niece.
3.0,Padding not that good
3.0,I like the sweater but it's quite a bit thinner than I was expecting.
3.0,"While it looks great, it breaks after a while....I will put my old original band back on."
3.0,"This lanyard was offered in a variety of colors and designs.  Yellow being a favorite color of mine, it is the one saving grace of this band.  It is not as thick as I hoped.  The leather is a nice touch.  Anyhow, I may give this as as stocking stuffer as I continue my quest for a worthy lanyard."
3.0,"I went up a size , and it was still kinda small. I love the shirt"
3.0,"I love the color and fit but annoyed that it slides off in my sleep, my other bonnet did not do this"
3.0,The material is rough and feels very cheap.
3.0,I did not like how the hem was made it made the skirt look cheap. Otherwise it was really cute.
3.0,It’s a wrap dress which I wasn’t aware of. The part that you have to pull the string through to tie it is extremely big so it looks as if there is a big hole on the side of the dress.
3.0,It looked like a cheap gumball necklace. :(
3.0,If you’re short and have big boobs this blouse is not flattering. It makes you look frumpy and wide. Also the sleeves don’t really stay down for the off the shoulder look. I tried front tucking a bit to give me a little more shape but still wasn’t feeling the look.
3.0,Cute jewelry accessory but the time doesn't stay accurate.
3.0,"The frame does not fit too well under my mask.  It is not easy to use, nor is it comfortable! I don't like it at all."
3.0,Cut is a little odd. Sleeves are a little snug where the rest of it is plenty big. Material doesn't wash well. It's ok.
3.0,Good made Chinese band but runs small if you have bigger hands.
3.0,The masks are ok. Not very comfortable  and they are prone to tearing on the outside.
3.0,not as in the image. the purple is actually blue.
3.0,Runs big but very comfortable
3.0,"The cover up is so soft and absolutely beautiful. I waited a month for the suit so was very excited. Unfortunately the actual swimsuit was way too small, didn't even cover my chest. You can't do refunds, only returns, and I'm not waiting another month just to get the suit. I'm only keeping it for the cover up. Would get a refund if I could. I'm size Large with 38DD and didn't cover, order like 2 sizes bigger if you can."
3.0,"I was excited to find a pair of silver sandals like this but I don’t care for the sole of the shoe. It is quite hard and inflexible, particularly under my arch. Unfortunately, I am not confident that they will break in either as the material seems to be somewhat lower quality."
3.0,"they broke after a week long camping trip, i know i shouldn't expect sun glasses this cheap to be durable, but its too bad they broke so fast."
3.0,"Glare is HORRIBLE<br />Frame design is WONDERFUL<br /><br />Glare was too much, so they're going back."
3.0,"Pretty good product,my only issue is the shoe grip pops off every once in a while but can easily be popped back in place!"
3.0,"PROS:<br />- Sportive, good as a cargo short design.<br />- Good size pocket considering I carry my phone along most of the time and it's so hard to find pockets where phones fit lately.<br />CON:<br />- Size fit larger than expected, although we'd normally use small-medium in shorts and we got the medium this time<br />- Design wasn't my preferred."
3.0,Stayed on better than I thought but once it got squished there was no fixing it.
3.0,It’s ok. The material is unfortunately the kind that picks up every fuzz and hair and piece of lint. The design of the dress itself is super cute though
3.0,It was a large but I couldn't get my arms in it...I gave it to my friend whose daughter is in middle school...
3.0,Should have double vowels
3.0,"I thought they were yellow LENSES... No. The reflective coating is just yellow. Not for nighttime driving. Just an FYI. Otherwise, yes they are polarized and look ok."
3.0,"I do not know if it was mentioned or not, but a chain is not included. You're just getting the crystal"
3.0,Cute but tight on the arms and across the shoulders. Could use a little more give in the fabric.
3.0,"THESE MAY SAY THAT THEY ARE AN &#34;XL&#34; BUT RUN WAY TO SMALLER THAN THAT!!! I NORMALLY I AM AN &#34;XL&#34; IN CLOTHING (ALL MY CLOTHES FIT BEAUTIFULLY ON MY BODY) BUT WHEN I OPENED THESE UP I ALREADY KNEW THAT THEY WE NOT GOING TO FIT!!! I HAVE A 32in WAIST 36in HIPS AND WHEN I MEASURED THE SHORTS (STRETCHED OUT AS FAR AS I COULD) THEY ONLY MEASURED ONLY 26in ( AND THAT WAS PUSHING THE MATERIAL TO THE MAX) THESE ARE AN ADORABLE PAIR OF BOOTY SHORTS, MATERIAL IS SOFT AND FLEXIBLE BUT, I MEANT FOR (IN MY OPINION) THE SMALLER FRAMED TEEN AR A VERY SMALL WAISTED FRAME.."
3.0,Fit great and warm but had a run after the third use and all I do is go to the office ans back home
3.0,styilsh plugs
3.0,The padding works for my spin classes that I take but since they are a bit large I feel like I'm sagging all over the place.
3.0,Can’t make the strap lay flat. I’ve tired everything. It’s something in the chain part that won’t let it lay flat.
3.0,Decent pair for if some happens
3.0,Leather has distinct synthetic feel versus true leather.  Brown quite dark in color.  True to size fit.
3.0,I had to order it twice because they sent me the wrong color and the buttons fall off really easy but it's cute.
3.0,The lower layer seems green in the pictures but its actually orange when we received it. it wasnt what we expected.
3.0,Sweet just a tad bit smaller than expected. Also thought the lens would have a more mirror effect but you can see through them somewhat
3.0,Good set up as far as pockets and places to store things. I have had for about two months and the inside liner that separates the bottom compartment from the top has already torn. This is probably only the 3rd time I have used this bag and it wasn't very full.
3.0,Neckless turned my friends neck green
3.0,"very small, but cute. i'm hanging on to it for my daughter as it was very inexpensive.  i wish it fit american women. I got the biggest size, i'm a normal US 12 and i cannot wear it."
3.0,"Let me tell you my likes first. These shorts are a great length, have excellent pockets (a must), and our good material fur running. Where they fall short is the waistband. It is very thick and uncomfortable. The rest of the shorts are comfortable, but that band is unnecessary. I am usually between a small and medium (5’4 and 130 lbs)  so I chose medium. The legs and everything are a perfect fit. The band fits, but it is so thick that you are very aware of it and it gets your  belly sweaty as you run. I don’t know why it doesn’t have a regular band like regular running shorts."
3.0,Love the suit. Hate the pads in the top. Wish they were removable.
3.0,she will be when she gets this. As it is planned for her 16th birthday!<br />I am getting prepared 4 yrs early.
3.0,"One of the buttons was made backward and does not snap. Other than that, nice item."
3.0,"Don't get me wrong the G Shock Watch is a 5 star product. The only reason why I gave it a 3 star is because the G Shock original box was came damage and you could tell this is not damage from shipping. To all the g shock collector out there. You know how important the original box is. Also when you open up your package and find the original box was smash, sometime it makes you wonder am I getting a new product or this is a pre-own product? Beside all that, by far this is one of the best old school classic look watches that G shock ever made. It feel a little bit small at first, but once you have it on your wrist. Is just prefect. Love the Carbon Fiber inlay watch band and just enough gold to give it that detail touches. So far this is my 7 g shock watches, still looking forward for more to come."
3.0,"It was much shorter than the picture shows.  Very pretty, but I returned."
3.0,The leggings run extremely small so order up two sizes. They are well made and the material is great. I like the green color but unfortunately they are too small for me to wear.
3.0,Great for around the house. The back mesh is completely see through though and you can see EVERYTHING. Can’t wear anywhere but at home alone. Otherwise very comfy.
3.0,"They are cute, see through material. They squeezed my thighs at the top. Wouldn't suggest these for ""above average"" thighs, unless the spilling over the top doesn't bother you."
3.0,Love the color and dress design but someone needs to show them how to make a dress for a tall gal!  Way too high waisted
3.0,Took about 15 minutes to assemble. I habe the rose gold Moto 360. It appears to be a slightly different color so i will have to see it in the natural light .
3.0,No locker included. Must purchase separate
3.0,No support but cute swimsuit
3.0,"This one is mostly on me, but after finally finding a set that was close to the correct color scheme needed I failed to notice there is no cushion/material around the rims. They will still do the job after I make some modifications."
3.0,They seem like really good quality and look very appealing.  They were a lot bigger than I expected - they say youth but they fit an adult.  Probably are going to be too loose for my son to wear for baseball...
3.0,Shipped fast. Good price.
3.0,"Nice, cute, they do what they need to."
3.0,Same style in different colors
3.0,"I don't hate it, but I don't love it."
3.0,Beautiful  just too small. I had to return it. Once I am fully refunded I will order in qabigger size.
3.0,Top of the garment fits well area below waistline has center pleats that appear to have insufficient fabric as the pleat does not close properly leaving a gap.  Too bad I really liked the fabric and color but I will be returning the item as I was unhappy with the partial pleat effect.
3.0,I ordered the shirt as a medium and got a large. Which was a big difference. I had to alter the shirt myself. I was very disappointed.
3.0,The chain broke a couple days after wearing it
3.0,"No blue light blocking at all, they did help a bit on the strain while on my tablet at night. The only thing I can say is you get what you pay for."
3.0,Measured daughter at store - she is a six.  Nike usually runs small.  Bought size 6 anyway - much too big.  This is the risk of internet shopping...
3.0,Wears too quickly
3.0,I normally wear a size M. It didn’t fit like a M. Size up
3.0,Great watch band could use an additional link
3.0,Not what I though it would be
3.0,"Very cute, but the material isn’t nice. I feel like my son is getting his feet exfoliated like it or not when I put these on him. Wouldn’t purchase again."
3.0,"Actually, I ordered them to give to my daughter volleyball teams for their end of season banquet which is next week so i haven't even seen them yet to give a review."
3.0,"Uno de ellos llego roto, con un hoyo en el tirante. Pedi 3 los otros dos son perfectos."
3.0,The material is nice but very thin!
3.0,Not very sturdy. Ripped the first day I wore it to my LARP. Very much not worth the money I paid for it.
3.0,I am very disappointed in these pants.  I am 5'9&#34; and from the reviews bought them thinking that they would fit.  No such luck.  I love the fit and the feel of the pants but they were just too short.  Sadly I will be returning them.
3.0,The size is pretty good. But the quality SoSo
3.0,"These were listed as mens socks size large (10-12) but appear to be women's sizing. Im a size 12 shoe and they didnt even fit half way on my foot, barely even fit my girlfriends foot who is a women's size 7.5. Socks are nice though and she was happy to receive the unexpected gift that these turned out to be."
3.0,"Fabric is ok - detail on back under neck is nice -<br />However,  hot stamp of brand on sleeve instead of embroidery and no pockets leaves room for improvement"
3.0,They seem a little cheap. I've worn them twice and they have not tarnished yet
3.0,"I am not a fan of the foam padding, doesn’t seem useful for this type of sunglasses."
3.0,The wings that came with the costume are not done right the stitching is not done right and the size of the velcro straps are not done right. I have to restitch and super glue the velcro to the wings.
3.0,Es bonita pero viene doblada en un paquete y es difícil a que enderece de nuevo. Bueno por el precio
3.0,it fit a little big even it was the size i order but k ow i think i have to order extra small cause small its not working for me.
3.0,runs about a size to big unless you want it baggy and not form fitted like I was expecting.
3.0,"I was a little dissapointed that the delivery date changed a couple of times, then when I received it today it's not at least in a zipbag showing that it is new since this is for a Christmas present. Otherwise satified with this product"
3.0,Super cute but had to return because it ran very small.  I recommend ordering 2 sizes up.
3.0,"The sizing on this dress is completely off. Im 5'5 130# 36D and I ordered the XXL/L it was way too big..in the stomach area and the arm hole area. The tag on the dress actually said US size 12 (I typically wear a size 4, 6). Would have been helpful to know that beforehand."
3.0,Cute swimsuit but too small for the size.
3.0,Don’t buy this!
3.0,"I really had a hard decision between 2 and 3 stars, but decided to be nice. Fit is slightly small and looks a bit cheap. Unfortunately the outfit looks more like pajamas than clothes my grandson can wear to school. Since it's camo he begged to keep it. I guess it will be the most expensive pair of PJs the little guy will own for a long time. lol"
3.0,Great purse but is not purple! It is blue! I ordered a purple purse and got a blue one.  I sent it back. I liked the design ok.
3.0,It was very short in length and runs small.
3.0,"Its a good bag if you need a bag, but not one that I would buy again.<br />Itll fit one days rations, extra socks, 4 boxes of .223,  hydration pouch, and an IFAK. Its a tight fit but it will fit.<br />the molly on the front lends itself to more options like a mag pouch or an accessory pouch of some sort but not much room"
3.0,"I ordered a 3x, it fits like an XL. I gave them to my niece instead of the hassle of shipping them back."
3.0,"I ordered the shorter version and at 5’4, it is still almost to my knees. It also reminds me a little of Christmas with it’s rich green color, sparkly silver stitching, and red and white bow for the waist"
3.0,Way larger than I expected. Sending back
3.0,"Mask are long so good for doubling. They didn't fit our child, so we had to have a seamstress alter them. They were too large, so now they fit. Our 7 year old has an average size head & they kept sliding off."
3.0,"They are cheaply looking.<br />It is hard to tell how protective they are,<br />Moneywise $4 is OK, if that matters."
3.0,I bought a large because the reviews got me nervous. I am by no means a small person. Comfy! More like pajamas
3.0,These are cute but so hard to clasp!  I still haven't decided if I'm going to keep them or not
3.0,"I would liken this scarf to something more likely to be worn with formalwear than function of keeping you warm.<br /><br />Upon opening this scarf, the first two things I noticed was that it’s much shorter than most scarves I’ve had or use and it is extremely thin.  While it is soft, I’m skeptical of its warmth potential in the coming winter months.  A good point about it being so thin is that it will disappear quickly into your outfit and will not stand out amongst your closet.<br /><br />I would only recommend this scarf for someone who lives in moderate climates or for someone who is looking for a very thin scarf."
3.0,Returned nothing to close it up in front just hangs wide open
3.0,Bought to wear for school colors.  Good red.  Fits ok.  A little small for D chest.
3.0,Fabric is very thin - ideally a slightly heavier weight fabric would work best for this type of skirt design.
3.0,"Let me say the good stuff first.<br />I LOVED the material. Super comfortable. Durable. Thick enough that I don't think you would see through them. And they are high waisted which is nice, but it wasn't as high as I would like them to be. But that's just my personal preference. Don't let that stop you from purchasing them. If you're looking for leggings to go above your belly button (like I was) look somewhere else.<br />Here's the bad stuff..<br />Besides not liking how high they came (or lack there of) I did not like the fact that there was no compression. It didn't hug me like I neededit too. So every time I squated or even walked, it felt like they were falling off of me. It was so annoying. I knew I could not work in these. I knew I would constantly be pulling on them. I would go down  a size to make them tighter on my waist, but they were already tight on my legs. I was afraid if I went down a size, it would be too tight on my legs and wouldn't fit. I decided these wouldn't work for me and returned them easily. I received my money back in 1-2 day.<br />I really do think they feel good. I think they're worth at least trying. And if it doesn't work out, return them. It was an easy process for me.<br />I am 165-170 pounds. 5'6 and I purchased these in a large.<br />I gain my weight in my stomach area, so I have a belly. And even with my stomach, these still were too loose in the waist. I have slim, muscular legs and they were comfortably snug on the legs. But a size smaller would had been too tight.<br />Hope this helps."
3.0,Many pieces broke or incomplete inside the package
3.0,Romper arrived extremely late! Tracking number was not trackable! Item is cute but took so long to get here… It’s part of a baby gift- I hope it still fits!!!<br />Wouldn’t order from this seller again.
3.0,The ear ring broke the momental I tried putting them on. But it's very pretty.
3.0,Rubs against my sides when moving. Hard to get a tight fit.
3.0,found them to be uncomfortable. it felt as though i was getting blisters by the end of the day so i returned the product
3.0,Legs and hips are very loose.
3.0,"I ordered these for an at home beer tasting with friends. I also ordered some beer tasting place mats to go with it. This set comes with 12 cups and the place mats have 4 spots. So this set was not enough for my party of 4 to use. So I ended up using some inexpensive plastic cups that I already had on hand for one person. These cups are nice and sturdy, but they come stacked in sets of three. It was very difficult to pull them apart and one actually cracked while trying to separate it from the stack. Yes, you can wash these and reuse them, but I ended up just throwing them away. For the cost of these, I would rather just buy the cheap plastic cups that I had to supplement with instead of these. If those crack, it's kind of expected."
3.0,Kind of bland look compared to what I was expecting.
3.0,"Fits as expected and is cute on me. However, the fabric is so thin that it feels like a slip. My measurements are 36.5, 28, 38."
3.0,And customer service assured me they block 85% of them....a bit disappointing but a good price...
3.0,Its super cute but i figured the size would be right however it is to small . wosh i could do and exchange but i cant find a way to contact the seller.. So i will return it. Make sure to go a size up..
3.0,"It didn't really hold up very well. The black string faded very quickly. And the pendent tarnished too. But you get what you pay for. Shipping was alright, It came on time."
3.0,Would have given this 5 stars if it was actually grey as shown! Size is accurate!
3.0,"I'm fairly disappointed with this sweatshirt. It looks different from the pictures -- the color is off, it doesn't have the same seams or fabric or zipper -- and it's not something I think I'll wear much. The fit is fine and as expected, but the zipper is ugly and gets stuck easily. The fabric is soft enough, but I don't like the color or the style. Bummed because it looks really cute in the product photos."
3.0,They were pretty was just expecting them to be a little bigger very tiny
3.0,"The yellow shorts don't match the onesies, should have been more of a yellow orange (sunflower) color rather than a lemon yellow. Haven't worn it yet... cute design however"
3.0,Was alot smaller then I thought and looked but ok for price. Probably wont buy again. But thank you anywayz.
3.0,Top part ran small
3.0,"It's small on me, I'll have to cut it and work it bigger. I mean, it's shiny, looks nice. but not everyone has the resources or time to do that.<br />Probably great if it fits you."
3.0,But it looks really cheap
3.0,"These slippers are very warm, and I love that they are washable, but they didn't last a very long time."
3.0,This runs very small!! And not easy to get open
3.0,These are very cute but they are thin.  Not the best quality.  But very cute
3.0,not what I expected.  Seem cheap
3.0,"The 3 correct pieces I received were really cute and I liked those a lot. However, I didn’t receive the 4th pair (top right), which is the one I liked the most. Really disappointed about that. I think they did reach out to me for a partial refund."
3.0,No las volvería a comprar. Puedo conseguir algo similar a un precio más bajo. Cómodas son pero no como lo esperaba.
3.0,"Pretty design on cover.  Well made.  Battery powered, was looking for manual  watch and wish this fact was emphasized more"
3.0,I have had it only a few weeks and it is already starting to fall apart.
3.0,So everyone said these are so comfortable I don’t find them comfortable they make me itch they look amazing on but def not comfy like everyone is saying they are
3.0,Fit great and super soft but loosing color after one wash and some stitching unraveling.
3.0,Poor quality. Bad design...mom.jeans waist for men no less. Jogger section on the bottom cheaply sewn together..<br />Eh. I got what i paid for. Would not recommend though.
3.0,I should have gotten extra large.
3.0,"Very sweet through and short on me (5'9). I sent it back, got the mint floral sleeveless"
3.0,Not made for petite women. I like the style but the pants are REALLY see through. So much so that you can see the tag in the back. 😖
3.0,"This skirt is cute but the shorts ripped an almost 2in hole where you don’t want there to be a hole, after the first wash. I’ve only worn once"
3.0,"Pretty thin material on this kitty jumpsuit. The ears are pretty floppy and the zipper doesn't seem super comfortable. It is cute though, and proportional. My daughter had worn out a few times and she always gets compliments."
3.0,"While I usually order most of my cosplays In a medium to alter it better to my (smaller) size I wasn’t expecting this, the black full suit part was hella small, although it still fit me it was odd, I had to wear a black undershirt underneath as the top area would end up showing half of my chest.<br />Still talking about the size order, while the back full body was super small the waist attachment part of it was even worse, it was two sizes too big it hardly stayed around my hips (it’s supposed to be snug around your stomach area.)<br />But in the end I just tried my best to stitch everything together. I personally wouldn’t say that it was a waste of money, It was just offsetting, would probably suggest to maybe possibly order a size smaller."
3.0,"These are probably better suited to those with larger, wider heads as they’re loose & sometimes fall. I already scratched them but I’ll take responsibility as I did not store them in their case. But still, to call these “Ironman” is a bit disingenuous. Going back to my Amazon cheapo reading glasses, 4 to a box for about $12."
3.0,Bought a small. I'm 5'5&#34;. 110lbs 32B and wear XS/00 usually. Was way to big and will not be able to wear at all. It's really cute so I'm super bummed.
3.0,"It was ok, really really big! I returned it."
3.0,Honestly not worth the price. Price should fall under 20 for this item.
3.0,"I returned this item, due to the gauge being too large for my nose ring area. The company did a good job of giving a description as well as the size of gauge, I just didn't realize how small I actually needed, I have never measured.  The product looked like it was made well, and the gems looked secure, which has always been a concern of mine.  I would suggest the item to those who know the size gauge they need."
3.0,"The quality control was poor. The stitching is not straight, the zipper is tough to get up/down.  I doubt this dress will hold up long, but it was just for pictures and very reasonably priced, so I didn't expect much."
3.0,"I actually really like how these shorts fit.  I never wear shorts but these are very comfortable and I felt confident in them.  The bottoms though where they look worn are kind of weird and do not look ""natural.""  The bottom wear almost reminds me or feels like something separate is attached to the bottom to give it the worn look, but they are a part of the shorts."
3.0,"It nice but the sleeves are not puffy like the picture, and the bottom is not flair like the picture but still nice"
3.0,"I bought this item to wear for a wedding.  Using the sizing chart provided, I measured myself and ordered a 6P, but what I received looked more like a size 16.  All three pieces were so large that they probably couldn't even be altered properly.  Also, I felt that the quality of this item was sub par for the price.  I am returning the item."
3.0,"Really cute anklet, but clasp broke 2nd time I wore it, I'm not good at fixing jewelry.... so it wasn't a good buy."
3.0,I love the shapes of the stones as they so capture the color of the real paraiba tourmaline nicely. The cz between the stones is a nice touch. Too bad they are so cloudy…like a low grade diamond. Also the post is not very strong so don’t wear to bed or shower with. I’m keeping them because it’s the closest I will ever come to the real very pricey stone…LOL
3.0,A lot bigger than I expected!
3.0,"This is a very cute turtleneck. I like the quality it’s very soft BUT it’s TIGHT AF!!! Im 5’4, 125 lbs b cups and the small was wayyyyy too tight. I hate returning things so I just gave it away. Size up for sure"
3.0,These products appear to be inconsistent in their sizing.
3.0,It's ok bad sewing it rides up when you walk<br />I think it could be better<br />It fit ok I will see if I want to keep it
3.0,Service and mailing awesome. Product itself cheaply made and one of the pins broke during first use. I was disappointed.
3.0,They are ok.  More yellow gold than copper.  I wanted to pair them with Rose gold cufflinks and this was not possible since they turned out to be yellow gold.
3.0,A little small but it's cute still
3.0,I ordered the Palm trees and received the cactus instead. The back of the package even said Palm leaf.<br />I need the palms for an outfit so I reordered them.<br />The cactus are very cute and seem to be a decent quality and the price was on point.
3.0,Runs small. Things bunch up.
3.0,"Very cute and and pretty good quality for the price, just be careful putting them on and you should be fine. So far I only have one run along my upper thigh, so it's not visible"
3.0,Length could be longer for larger neck size.
3.0,Cute but way to small; had to return.
3.0,I would have liked them to be a bit larger
3.0,"I bought this for my husband to replace a beloved leather jacket he had that had long since seen its day. The description of this matched the length and style he was looking for. Our concern was that it was too cheap. But it is very good quality and looks great. The only problem is with the inside zipper. He finds that if he sits in the car with it zipped, the zipper can sometimes open from the bottom, and be very hard to realign so it can be zipped again--once he had to literally step out of the coat so he could work on the zipper. Now if he is going to sit he just snaps the outside and leaves the zipper open. It looks just fine that way and it's sufficiently warm."
3.0,"Looked amazing the first time I put it on but once I washed it  (IN COLD ONLY) and hung it to dry, the light float fabric changed texture to a more structured, heavier feel. It’s still okay but I imagine it won’t last long in my closet."
3.0,pretty but too small
3.0,"fabric is light and soft, but lays on and shows my love handles."
3.0,Overcoat sits weird.
3.0,"Way too small, order two sizes down if you child has any meat on their bones. Cute style, just bad fit in the shirt especially."
3.0,These were see through and very uncomfortable. Price was good but I still sent them back
3.0,Has a tendency to fall off your shoulders easily. Loops for a hammer were to small my wife added 3/4 of an inch of elastic and now it's acceptable. Gets warm wearing it good for fall and winner.
3.0,Good product and fast shipping.  I ordered these for teenaged girls.  The skirts were a little small.  Even thought they have elastic they still need to be bitter in the waist.
3.0,"I love these feel of the material, and it fits well."
3.0,This bra ran really small; I typically wear a 34C and the C was tiny on me. The bra also started started to shift/come off after a couple hours of sweating and dancing. I don’t think I’ll be able to get another use out of it; There are probably better sticky bras out there for similar prices.
3.0,Way too thin to be of any use
3.0,"Super shiny and too small. I ordered a size big, but they’re still tight and I’m not a fan of the fit around the ankles. They’re a little wide. Very golden girlsy."
3.0,"the materials are 35% cashmere, 61%wool, and 4%spandex<br />because i've never purchased wool socks before, i don't find this a good thing<br />(if this is normal, someone please tell me)"
3.0,"It's very pretty, but I've only worn in once in the two months that I've owned it because it's impossible to clasp it without having someone else help you."
3.0,"regular sunglases, poor quality"
3.0,"nice band.  Little short, but works."
3.0,Really wanted to give five stars as I love the way this dress looks on and it is very comfortable.  There are some issues though...the fabric was poorly dyed and has quite a few flaws.  The fabric is also very thin and a bit see through.  The arm holes would fit an elephant leg; they are way too big and the whole side of your bra shows.  The dress is tapered at the bottom so taking a full stride is not an option.  The dress is also very long...too long...and is a trip and fall hazard.  I have to pull the dress up a bit when outside as it drags on the ground and I wasn't kidding about the trip and fall...I've stumbled on the hem more than once. You'd lose the taper with a hem which will likely distract from the look.  Living in Florida I bought this as a daytime dress while hoping to avoid wearing a slip but don't feel comfortable going outside without one.  A bit disappointed.
3.0,Very flattering for curvy women.  I should have picked another color but it is very beautiful on.  I did not care for the material as much but it is fine for the price.
3.0,Didn't even put them on before the loops fell off of the right shoe.  As for the left shoe there is enough support when you can lace up the loops and they fit nice. I went a half size up and it feels just right. The laces are trash just replace them as soon as you get the shoe. Kind of disappointed since I have worn Spiez steel toes and they are way better than this.
3.0,"So it gets 3 stars because the shirt is soft, but its way too short and fits way tight. I wear a snug large and ordered an xl because I wanted it roomy. No luck. But my biggest complaint is its shorter than advertised and it shrank being washed on cold and dried on low. It works for Halloween apparel, but not comfy enough to be worn often."
3.0,"Comfy and nice colors , I got two of them . But they tear easily lol"
3.0,I wear a normal 10-12 but the large was still a little snug because of the lining.
3.0,Fits well cute piece many compliments
3.0,Pretty yellow sweater.  Runs small.  Returned.  Received my money back quickly.  It's difficult to find summer sweaters.
3.0,Bag is good but bit expensive.. it’s 10$ worth
3.0,"This bracelet is very pretty, but the clasp is completely  unwieldly and not functional. I am going to have to have the clasp changed in order to wear it."
3.0,Must be returned
3.0,It’s a nice looking tie but u can’t tell it’s a skinny tie from the pic. It would’ve been fine as a regular sized tie.
3.0,"The fabric of this dress is elegant and shimmery, but it is very form-fitting to your body.  I personally do not find it to be very flattering for a realistic body shape.  Being so clingy, it would surely look wonderful on someone very slender or very fit.  The belt is awkward.  I fiddled with it for along time, but I can’t get it to hang in a way that looks good.  The belt is attached, and there is also an attached belt clasp/buckle—so you are forced to wear the belt.  I just found it to be awkward.  It belt is so long for my short height that it hangs very low to the ground.  So I wanted to wrap the belt around my waist, but there just isn’t a good way to tie it or fasten it with that particular buckle.  It took away from the look of the dress.  The dress sizing is pretty flexible because it is so stretchy and because it is a wrap style.  I would normally wear a medium, but I received a large and it still fits pretty well."
3.0,Received the wrong color which is disappointing because the bag does not match with anything else.
3.0,"Excellent value ,"
3.0,The wine red is not the same color as in picture unfortunately
3.0,bought a 3x fits like 2x.
3.0,"I suppose it serves its purpose, but too bulky to use for roller derby"
3.0,Shoes were too large and were uncomfortable because of the large size.
3.0,I ordered three pairs of these in three different colors but all the same size. They all fit completely different. One pair is awesome and I wear them all the time. Another pair is fine- they work when I am running low on options. The last pair I have put in the donate pile. They’re just too tight on the back- they come up to the right place on the stomach- but show way too much booty if I move around. Like early 2000’s low rider jeans.
3.0,I had to return my jacket. It was a beautiful piece but it was too tight for me. I couldn’t get it over my shoulders and my arm area would be too tight. I purchased the XL which the charts said was a 16/18 which is my normal size for a shirt. This jacket unfortunately did not fit me. I am 5’ 5” and heavy up top. I wear a 40DD bra and have too much tummy. My arms are bigger and I have a wide back. I would say if they have an XXL this jacket could work for a top heavy person like me.
3.0,These are very beautiful shades. Love the bling. My only hiccup though is where the polarization is concerned. I guess you do get what you pay for. I don't feel like I'm getting the eye protection I was expecting to get.
3.0,The dress is very beautiful however it is extremely short! I had to buy some fabric to sow and make it longer.
3.0,"I gave it a 3 because the fit is nice and the color is gorgeous. Unfortunately it wasn't sewn that well and the seam is down the back, not on the sides. Makes it look cheap. Earrings are brownish color, they will be re-gifted. I kept the dress because I need strapless dresses for after shoulder surgery."
3.0,Sleeves are short and it is not tailored as in the pictures but it is cute enough and casually sexy.
3.0,Great for the price. Mine squeaks when I open them though. Good for a backup pair or If your looking for something cheap. Very cute.
3.0,"This item is pretty and the quality is good, but it was too big to attach to my purse.  It got in the way when I would grab my purse.  So I attached it to a suitcase."
3.0,It’s ok runs very small I got a x-large but it’s more like a small and the fabric is thicker than expected not very breathable like a heavy polyester.
3.0,Very large name in the middle of the face. Stiff band. Just ok.
3.0,"This item was quite cute and comfy; my 2.5 yr old loved it and was insistent on wearing her ""dinosaur"" slippers.  However, after ONE week of normal wear, the one slipper ripped along the seams by the ankle.  I was really hoping these would have lasted at least throughout the winter season but looks like we'll be back on the hunt for comfy and durable slippers for her.  Three stars because they are cute, they are warm, they are relatively grippy, but minus 2 for durability, although maybe I just got a bad pair based on other reviews."
3.0,my fault- i should have looked a bit more carefully at the picture - Los Angeles is actually with a lower case L on the keychain and it does look kind of dumb as it looks like lOS not LOS
3.0,"Really liked the bag color & material, but i didn't like the zipper, there is big odd gap"
3.0,"[[ASIN:B01D8K7HMM ProEtrade® Women's Plus Size Swimdress Printed Swimsuit Beachwear Plus Bikini Swimwear (10, Light Blue)]]I am comparing the following 3 swim suits I bought this week.  I want to go to the gym and sit in the spa at the end.  I picked these 3 items because I don't want to shave my private part every time when I want to put on the swim suit.  These 3 swim suits all does a great job covering the bikini area.  Two of them are 2 piece design and one is one piece design.<br /><br />My size, normally I wear size 8 petite for bottom and large for top. Bust size: 38&#34; widest, wear 34C and 36C Victoria secret full coverage only, may need a bigger size if not full coverage.  Waist: 30&#34;, butt: 36&#34;; height: 5 ft 4&#34;.  I can put all of them on without any problem.  I am returning 2 and keeping the one that is most comfortable.<br /><br />Size information for B01D8K7HOA: I ordered size 10 as more people think it's bigger than expected than smaller than expected.<br />- Straps are adjustable from 9&#34; to 16&#34;<br />- Bust: is 30&#34; measure flat, removable bra circle is 5&#34; diameter<br />- Waist: as this is a 2 piece design, these is not really waist area, the part after the bra goes from 30&#34; to 36&#34; wide.<br />- Bottom: boy short 26&#34; flat and you can stretch it out to 32&#34;<br />- From the top to bottom, it measures 18&#34;<br /><br />Feedback:<br />- I like the boy short, but  I like this one the least.  Although the bra padding can be removed, this is the most basic kind that I don't like.  It is not designed for someone with huge top as there is no wire support like the other 2. I don't like the back (halter), I have a hard time to tight it.  The position is too high and the fabric is too smooth and it keeps sliding away from my finger tips.  I would rate this 75/100 compared to the other 2.<br />///<br /><br />Size information for B01H59GO1W: purchased size L based on size chart: 38.5-40&#34; chest<br />- Waist is around 28&#34;<br />- When lay flat without stretching, the bust area measure 32&#34; (without counting the curve of the cups)<br />- From top (where the bust area) to bottom of the skirt measure 20&#34;<br /><br />Features that I like:<br />- Adjustable shoulder straps, you can change it from 7&#34; and extend to whole length of 14&#34;, I find the strap slightly uncomfortable<br />- supportable wired cup<br />- Removable padding, you can remove it if it does not fit you.  I find the padding slightly bigger than the available area.  It is difficult to pull it out, and flatten it out and have it turns and faces the right way after I try to put it back in.<br /><br />Feedback:<br />One piece design: depends on your height, you may find it better to buy 2 pieces if you are much taller than me or you wear different sizes of bottom. I think this is perfect for someone who does not have huge tops.  If you have more than C cup, you may not like this one.  It maybe good for someone who is between 5 feet to 5 feet 7 based on the length and the shoulder strap. I do look slimmer in it, especially the waist area based on the design.  As I am not that tall, although it fits me (not too tight, not too loose), I look &#34;wide&#34; in it based on the proportion of the dress and my body shape. I am returning it as I feel the cup padding area is smaller than my actual chest, and I rate this as 85/100 based on its quality and comfort.<br />///<br /><br />Size information for B01GX3BT9I size 12, I ordered this size based on my bust.<br />- Strap is not adjustable, it measures 14&#34;. As it is wider than B01H59GO1W, I find the strap more comfortable.<br />- Bust: is 28&#34; measure flat, meaning, this one come with big curve bra and wired cup, and I can not measure all the curves.  I only measure from the back in a straight line.<br />- Waist: as this is a 2 piece design, these is not really waist area, the dress is 36&#34; wide after the bra cups.<br />- Bottom: straight is 30&#34; but you can stretch it out to 36&#34;<br />- From top to bottom, it measures around 25&#34;.<br /><br />Features that I like:<br />Flexible 2 piece design is great if you need a smaller or bigger bottom.  What I like the most is the bra and built in wired.  It is really comfortable.  Before I tried it on, I was thinking, the bra looks way too big for me.  Actually, it gives great support.  However, this built in support / wired bra cannot be removed.<br /><br />Final thought: The layering (cross over) of fabric in the front is a little bit strange, where my finger is pointing.  What I don't like about it, I am kind of chubby, so with that said, this dress does show some meat piling up below the bra area, and above the waist area on the sides.  Depends on how much meat you have on your body and your back, they may be squeezed into layers. It is good for someone want excellent support for their big headlights.  This is the one that I am keeping, I rate this 90/100.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a reduced price to complete and post a factual review without compensation. Positive reviews are earned only through positive product attributes and performance. [...]"
3.0,I gave this top a three only because of the color in photo looks more of a gray but it is black and white.<br />I have washed this top several times and hung to dry and it hasn't faded at all.
3.0,"I was so excited to get this and was thrilled by the look, feel and color of it upon receipt but when I tried it on it was just ill fitting.  I got my norm XL which usually gives me some room to spare which I like.  Instead it clings tightly too much in my chest as if it were even possibly a medium.  Sadly it is just too ill fitting for me to comfortably wear.  Cannot recommend."
3.0,"First of all, let me say, this is a very good looking watch. I really like it from a looks standpoint. I have now owned and used this watch for about 6 months. One of the first things I noticed, is this watch will randomly lose or gain a minute or two over a day or two. the first day I wore it, I had to reset the time twice. it was loosing minutes. The second day, it gained a minute. Six months later, I only have to adjust it once a week or so. two days ago, it was two minutes behind, and today it was one minute. I usually refer to an atomic clock for the time adjustment. The calendar is unusual, in that there are a double zero (00) date, and also 38 days on the calendar, rather than the usual 31.<br />  The retailer references stainless steel in the title of the watch on Amazon. I believe this to only refer to the watch band. The watch case is already showing pitting and corrosion on the backside. The bottom cover, which has a window, may also be stainless steel, as it shows no signs of pitting. the buttons on the side, which control the calendar and month functions have begun to loose their gold look plating. I work in an office environment, and I wear this watch every day, so I wouldn't expect this level of deterioration within only 6 months."
3.0,"Good price for 6 bras, but these are not sport bras!  No support whatsoever.  OK for sleeping or lounge wear."
3.0,Way too revealing. Dress is not good for a windy day or even a light breeze.
3.0,Bottom is cut smaller than normally would wear
3.0,"For the money these broches are nice! However they took a very long time coming, I did complain about the hold up, and my account was credited in full! 4-5 days later they came in the mail, which I did not expect, nor did I expect a full refund!<br />So all in all the seller did ok by me!"
3.0,Fabric is not giving at all.  It feels like a rain poncho made of plastic.
3.0,Very cute but didn't fit my 8 year old. It was much too small.
3.0,Cheaply made. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:5bf524a3430a64a2f273390ed599c275]] Its OK. Feels nice& looks good even with my tummy. Has a little extra room in it. I'm 5'5, 160 pounds. Only thing as you can see it comes up while walking. I ordered size medium."
3.0,I do love the cover-up it matches the theme I was going for with my outfit however it is advertised as oversized but it is not. I am five seven and it fits me like a XL t-shirt not the drapey cover up as shown in the picture but you live and you learn
3.0,The stones were disappointing!
3.0,Too beige
3.0,"Ordered a Large top fit as expected, the bottoms were more like a small"
3.0,"They ran tight, I would size up."
3.0,"No comment on product quality, because I didn't try it. It looks like 6 decades ago jacket."
3.0,"Haven't tried it yet, but looks comfortable for travel!  Very different..."
3.0,"I love cardigans. I carry all my weight in my midsection so a cardigan just helps take the emphasis away and smooth out my sides. I typically buy lightweight cardigans, but this winter I just can't seem to stay warm and so I thought I'd try buying a thick cardigan. I'm pretty sure I ordered this in a small, even though I normally do a medium because of the oversized description (I definitely didn't want it to look bulky or make me look bigger than I am), but unfortunately the tag doesn't say and neither does my order history. (For reference I am 142 lbs, 32FF chest, and wear L in shirts.) As far as quality goes, this is not bad. I think it would last around a year with heavy wear and wash (I do a capsule/minimal wardrobe so I wash and wear my clothes a couple times in one week) and that's based on how it looks after 5 months. It is comfortable to wear and if you really like that chunky, oversized look then you will probably love how it looks. For me, even though it did keep me warm, I didn't feel like it was something I wanted to wear out of the house.  Other things worth mentioning- I ordered the army green color and it is definitely an army green color or an olive color. It looks like a deeper green to me in the pictures online than it was in person. It has pockets!"
3.0,It’s alright. The price to me is right for the quality you get. The leather is good quality but seamwork is already starting to break in several areas only a month later. I don’t keep my wallet in my back pocket either and since it’s summer time I’m usually wearing shorts so there hasn’t been extreme amounts of pressure on the stitches. I tried using a lighter and scissors to shorten them up but more are starting to appear again. This is only happening in the front I should add. Other than that it’s been a good wallet. I would say it’s what you get for what you pay for.
3.0,"I like these, but the fronts don't provide nearly as much coverage as pictured. Cute though."
3.0,Would be nice if it wasn't wayyyy to small.
3.0,Chin has wrinkles that you have to work with to get right.
3.0,"For the price it’s not a bad pair. It comes as shown. The wood is a little unfinished and sharp on the edges. Personally I will look for another pair of glasses next purchase. If your looking for a pair that you want have and not worry about beating them up a little, these are a good buy."
3.0,Shirt was a little smaller than expected and sleeves were too long
3.0,"Exactly what I was looking for and is super cute, but definitely getting what you're paying for here, I can tell it's not going to last very long.. Also, it came with this really weird tag on it that said something to the effect of &#34;do not chew on or put in mouth because product may contain chemicals known to cause cancer in the state of California&#34; - which on the other hand I was glad to have this information because I do have a toddler. But just strange.. I've never seen anything like that before.."
3.0,I do not know haw they count 23 pieces. You receive 8 necklaces which are cute and still a great deal for the price my daughter loved them.
3.0,"I was excited that this arrived right away. I had been browsing for a new band for a while and decided on this one because it was leather, I liked the buckle, and the reviews indicated good quality. I missed the mention of the band being on the smaller side, though. I wish that had been made more clear, with a comparison the the standard Apple bands, perhaps? It will clasp, but it is too tight. Will have to be returned."
3.0,I liked the style but it was poorly made some the the button holes were too tight & I didn’t like the fabric.
3.0,Nice color when worn with black bottoms.  The bra needs a bit more structure and support.
3.0,"it's a very nice shirt but not loose enough in my normal size, and if I order the next size up then it's too big"
3.0,"This swim suit is made for those who have long torsos. I will be sending it back because the material buckles on the sides because my torso is to sort for the suit. Other than that, it appears to be good quality."
3.0,"My first purchase of this time piece iwas wonderful . This was my second watch as I broke the 1st one. I didn't care for the strap that came with it and bought a velco strap (Amazon.com - Voguestrap TX51012BK Allstrap 16-20mm Black Adjustable-Length Perforated Nylon Sport Strap Watchband) to replace the strap with the buckle. I had an awful time trying to take the stiff posts off the time piece, as it wouldn't slide out and did not have the spring collapsible post that is much easier to remove and install. It was extremely difficult to push or slide the posts out of the holes. As a result I had to bend the post to get it off. After finally getting it off the time piece, I straightened the post and struggled to install my preferred watch band. To add insult to injury, the light did not cover the entire time piece and I could see only the hour numbers and not minute numbers in the dark. I could have returned to have it replaced, but didn't feel like going through the aggravation of contacting Amazon to arrange an exchange and I certainly didn't want to go through the hassle  again of transferring the preferred watch band to the replaced time piece."
3.0,"Dress is YELLOW not champagne. Bodice embroidery does not seam together by zipper. Size 12 barely fits my size 8 mannequin. However the embroidery is beautiful and chiffon is flowy, both are not look cheap looking like the usual Chinese dresses on Amazon."
3.0,They are cute but awfully small!
3.0,Definatley different from the picture! It's still a cute bathing suit though. The top fits a little loose so I'll be returning it.
3.0,Just didn't fit right for me.
3.0,Dress was as pictured but runs very small. Size up for proper fit.
3.0,"Not a bad jacket, but the collar is pretty much non existent, and the pockets can only fit a few of my fingers at best. Other than that. Good quality."
3.0,"Not bad for the price, chain is a little discolored. But it's nothing I can't live with. It's really cute."
3.0,I will have to get it altered but I love the fabric and the embroidery on it.
3.0,I bought these in hopes it would help me stay in my saddle better they fit wonderful but not much sticky to the silicone
3.0,"If I put it on my head in one certain way it looks cute. But then it's very low in front, too low to comfortably wear sunglasses. The fabric feels like wool, a bit scratchy, but that's not a problem since it doesn't directly contact any skin. The adjusting cord is a primitive setup and it dangles out the back of the hat. I probably won't  wear it."
3.0,Cheap quality. Don't see these lasting more than a few wears.
3.0,"Not up to the standard quality in manufacture of previous gloves i have purchased for the same price break and quantity. almost like given to a child to cut and sew, and maybe that is the case."
3.0,"My husband loved them, but after a month of use they are really worn out."
3.0,"Cute, cheap fabric, good for a season"
3.0,Waist didn't fit snug
3.0,"I bought this a gift for my mother in law. She was so excited to get this, however I had to return it because it was too big even though the size of her watch was listed as being compatible. (I do not own apple products so I don't know what size her watch is, and this was on a list with a link directly to this item) She did say it was pretty and the shipping was right on time."
3.0,"I had to mend it the very first day I wore it. The stitching on the pocket started to come apart. This isn't the first hoodie from Russell I've bought, and I had to mend the previous one too, although not on the first day. I might try a different brand next time."
3.0,"these are really cute but if you don't have really skinny calves, then they are really tight.  Foot size fits well but too tight around legs so have to send back."
3.0,"I kept the bracelet because it looks cute in general, but if you want realistic eyes, check out a different style"
3.0,Runs very small. My son was only able to wear this once.
3.0,"My feet are on the edge of needing wide sizes.  So I'm starting to buy wide sizes as I get older.  I got these because I occasionally get some foot issues & wanted a sandal with support but also quite open.  I was disappointed that the strap over the toes is so short, and the placement of velcro such, that it doesn't attach without putting pressure on the base of the toes.  If my foot is a bit touchy I have to leave that strap open.<br /><br />The arch support is also pretty minimal.  Had to add a little arch pad."
3.0,Overall a very nice necklace.  Unfortunately when I opened the box the necklace was twisted so there was a kink in it.  So  I found out from a jeweler that these kind of chains will kink easy especially if there is some sort of pendant on them. Besides that it looks nice and you can read the inscription very well.
3.0,"I am comparing this one to the one I picked up at Macy's.<br /><br />It does not come with measurements so you will have to guess and play around a few times before you get the perfect bow.<br />The material feels very rough, almost like a worn out sandpaper.<br />Why do you need to lie to me and claim to be made out of silk? You obviously are not.<br />I ended up giving this guy away to one of my buddies at the gym, it's a really inexpensive gift that will go a long way.<br /><br />I bought it to see how a bow tie looks on me, once I knew I could rock it I went ahead an upgraded to real silk."
3.0,A bit big but the bottoms are comfortable and the top was small for the size
3.0,These would be great if they were a little longer in the finger length. That might help to keep them from rolling up.  If it weren't for that I would give 5 stars.
3.0,"It took a month to get this and the quality is just okay.  Very hard to read the words at the top and bottom.  They aren't just small, but the print is very light."
3.0,It's a cute tiny bag. Enough for a phone and few essentials. Though mine came with an obnoxious scratch on the back. Looks like they tried to fix ot too before shipping it out.
3.0,"Earrings are great - they are rose gold. No problems. My rating is due to the packaging. Every, single earring is in its own plastic bag. So 12 small plastic bags, inside 2 more plastic bags ... Having the earrings on a piece of card/paper, wrapped in tissue paper, would have gotten them here as well."
3.0,"If you have the fan speed up any higher than ‘just on’, the fan makes the entire cap vibrate! Not a good feeling. Consequently, I’ve not worn this cap since I bought it."
3.0,Daughter loves these shoes but the inserts lasted a month before they started getting holes. Now they are uncomfortable and she won’t wear them.
3.0,not as great glare reduction as I hope - look cute but not super effective - would not buy again
3.0,"It was a nice top but the white is extremely see through.  I had hoped for an opaque white shirt but with a cami you can see the entire thing which is not a cute look, don't think even with just a nude bra you could get away with this you would still see it."
3.0,Just wish it was a little heavier
3.0,Came unsewed I was able to repair but it's  only 3 months old.
3.0,The second hand spans the diameter of the face rather than just the radius. The silicone is great for cleaning but it always gets stuck at an odd angle on my wrist.
3.0,"I think the tree life pendant is too big, but cute"
3.0,Ear piece broke after couple  of weeks. Tried to glue it but to no avail.
3.0,Smaller than anticipated. Should be labeled as a women's watch.
3.0,"They fit weird. Maybe it's my face, maybe it's the glasses, not sure"
3.0,"I was very hopeful, given the positive reviews and appealing photo, but was very disappointed when I tried it on. The white dress is incredibly see-through. The pockets show clearly from under the skirting, which further highlights how see through the dress is. Also, unless you are as flat-chested as the model in the photo, the V Neck is not as deep as it shows in the photo.<br />I'm still hopeful, so I have ordered it in black. We shall see.<br /><br />I have updated my review from 2 stars to 3 stars. I received the black dress, and the material is much thicker than the white one. The hemming along the bottom of the dress is a little uneven, but for the price, can't really complain about that. Again, if you have a larger chest, it's not going to sit the same way as in the picture. But the dress is flattering."
3.0,"It fit nice everywhere else, but the chest is weird. Not sure they know where the boobs go."
3.0,"I needed something quick for office hours and didn't want to go shopping. So I ordered two of these for simplicity. I gained weight over the pandemic and went from small to medium. I don't want to spend a ton of money on clothes when I hope to fit back into my wardrobe soon. This is roomy and comfortable, but it sits as an empire waist instead of on the natural waist. The belt does not stay in place and looks silly with the pleats. This is cute with a pair of boots and no belt. It also doesn't have any tag on the inside and you need to figure out that the front has a slightly lower drape at the neck. Overall, for the price, quick delivery, and quality, I'd say it's fine for my purposes. I do like that the sleeves are long and don't come short on my arms. I'm not super tall, but tall enough that this is sometimes an issue."
3.0,never saw child wrapped in same
3.0,Quality  is ok timely receipt but not the same saying as ordered for one thing both feet say the same thing no heart and different words at least it is Liverpool fan words
3.0,"The fabric is thin, and the shirt fits more snuggly that I usually wear.  I'm keeping it in the hopes that it will stretch in the wash."
3.0,All good exept fabric really light and thin more like a t-shirt feeling but cool as a valentine gift to my just married friends just decorated with embroidery but not for every day usage
3.0,Took a little bit of time to get here.  No complaints.
3.0,"I bought 2 pairs of D'Blossom flip flops, the yellow fit fine, but the pink are too big , they seem stretched out . I am sending those back. but they yellow are adorable,"
3.0,The body length was shorter than expected.
3.0,"Runs a bit small. The color is yellowed and the buttons are white, which is odd. The worst part for me is that the pockets on the front are fake and sewn on crooked. For the price, I suppose I should have known...  it is not the worst shirt I have ever purchased but on the bad list for sure."
3.0,"These things are becoming so popular with music festival goers and the 'raver' or 'EDM' set, so I ordered two... one grey and one irridescent. They're actually really cool, once you figure out how to remove all the protective film. They need to have 'pull tabs' to get the film off... and yes, the plastic needs to be reinforced... it needs to be about 2 times stronger or thicker. And I'd pay twice the price for a better quality product... especially if it was polarized. If it was polarized I'd probably pay 4 times as much money for this. I'm used to paying $400-$1500 for a pair of sunglasses each year... I don't buy watches or any other jewelry, so I justify my silly spending this way lol. So make this stronger and give it UV protection and I'd pay $90 or more for it..."
3.0,"This dress is huge! I wear a L and down sized to a M and it is still a tent on me. The dress it self is cute especially the cut out sleeves, and it's made well. I washed and dried it twice to see if it would shrink a little. It gets 3 stars because of the quality of it, but deductions for the fit!"
3.0,Fabric choice isn't particularly comfortable or as flattering as expected
3.0,"It's good, but it didn't blow my mind.  I was  expecting something a bit more spectacular."
3.0,It dose not look as good as the picture. and the chain is small.
3.0,"The top doesn't stay spread out so it can be revealing. The straps are hard to get in and out of once you have them adjusted to fit. Have to loosen to get out of. Hope your not in a hurry to potty! Thin material, nice and cool for the summer."
3.0,"Followed the size chart and ordered the M for size 10-12, but they run small and fit like an 8. The product itself though is of good quality."
3.0,This does the trick but they feel very cheaply made.
3.0,"Don't stay on very good, but ok."
3.0,It it a large and long dress. I ordered a small and looks like L.
3.0,more like a t shirt with a hood than a sweatshirt. thin and not real warm
3.0,"I quite liked it. It just felt a little cheap in material, but for the price i quite liked it."
3.0,"Warm, stylish but does shed."
3.0,"Simply classic, just what I wanted."
3.0,"This is the first time I have tried this style of reading glasses.  May take a while to get used to.  The glasses themselves are well made and sturdy, don't have problem with that.  Hopefully, with time I will become more comfortable with them; I like the idea of no bifocal line."
3.0,"I have purchased these masks before but in this most recent purchase, I noticed the quality was different.  The print was more faded and the elastic was too long.  It didn't fit my child as it did before."
3.0,"T-shirt material. Not what I expected, but fits well (I ordered a size larger based on other reviews.)"
3.0,Broken. Pin was out of the band.
3.0,"The neckline is not as low as pictured.<br />It is a very boxy fit and resembles a hospital scrub. The material is nice, however the side seams are completely slit, not a very modest choice for getting off of the not and running up to the shoreline restaurants. I am returning it and still have hope that I will find the perfect coverup."
3.0,Shoe is cute but fits big/wide.  Daughter loved them and wanted to wear so didn't return.
3.0,"Nice piece of cheap &#34;jewelry,&#34; but it hasn't worked as expected. Friends had raved about negative ion everything for their aches and pains, but I have not noticed any difference in mine."
3.0,"I had requested the color Natural, but I received Sand. I am going to keep it, but I am not happy. I paid over $32. 00. I should have received what I requested. Very disappointed"
3.0,I ordered a medium in blue. Color was good. Fit was good. But dress did not look like the one on the picture.
3.0,This necklace is SO cute and heavier than I thought it would be. It arrived wrapped well and I've received so many compliments on it. Update: I changed my rating to 3 starts because it broke. Quite frustrating.
3.0,"i really like this necklace, the only thing that bothered me was it took about  a month and a half to ship, I thought it got lost in the mail because the tracking wouldnt update. it arrived to me though. I enjoy wearing it, even though the globe is oddly upside down."
3.0,cost alot for grand kids shoes!
3.0,A little strong in a bad way and tastes over roatsed.
3.0,It's OK Definately for a baby as it's not that substantial to wash an adult body. I'd give it 5 stars for a baby as it's soft and suds up soap pretty good. I just made a bad choice for my own needs.
3.0,It’s very cute but very short and I’m 5’1
3.0,It was a nice necklace but not as nice as expected. I thought it would have more beads and be chunkier for the price I paid. I think it's worth no more than 5$
3.0,"The stones & bracelet are just what I wanted/ expected- but a few weeks into wearing, I noticed the cute dragon fly charm was gone.<br /> I kinda bought this because of that : )"
3.0,Unusable after the 1st week using it
3.0,I haven't made up my mind yet. I'm waiting for a dark rainy night to give a full review.
3.0,"I loved the design and debated about ordering. When it arrived, was smaller then expected. Was very delicate and thin. I did return."
3.0,"Bought this for a camping trip and all kids like them. The quality of the pack is so so, we have about 8 not working out of the package (20% defective rate)."
3.0,They were a little snug for a large . The band rolles down . But they don’t ride up anywhere else
3.0,"Nice product! Made well and everything. My only complaint is that it said measure yourself and if you are between sizes order the smaller size. It does not fit, its too small!!"
3.0,The ear wrap is so heavy it doesn't stay clipped on the ear but is very pretty and descent quality
3.0,Gold chips off case. But it is sturdy!!!!!!
3.0,Size not true!  I had to end up sending them back unfortunately.
3.0,"The color is lighter than what is shown, but reasonably burgundy. The pocket square was a bit small"
3.0,"Do not buy if you are busty. Cup size was way too small. I ordered a size 14, and I'm a size 8, yet it was still too small in the bust."
3.0,This is so soft  I'm tempted to wear it as a PJ top! I did think that the fabric could be thicker.
3.0,I'm 4'11 & 160lbs. I bought a large but it fits like a medium. It's also pretty itchy around the arms. Looks nice on but it's not that comfortable. Too skimpy for a workout (for my taste) but hubby likes it around the house.
3.0,Did not like that it did not come with divider to separate checks. If you have duplicates this does not work. Am now waiting for another product will not be using this one.
3.0,"Love the color and style however, the sizing runs somewhat smaller than advertised. If I were to order again I would go a size up."
3.0,"A little confusing to figure out.  Would have appreciated instructions.  Will work for the purpose we purchased for (Renaissance festival costume).  We will add embellishments to enhance further but, for the price, was a good deal."
3.0,"This product will do the job if you're taking a weekend trip away and flying certain airlines with personal item restrictions. My purpose of this product was specifically met per the dimensions for Spirit airlines. I was able to pack for 3 days worth the trip and a few gift items returning home. My only disappointment is the strap that came with this duffel. I'm 5'3 and I could arrange the strap, but I could not reposition the metal buckle due to the size of the leather guard that helps cushion your shoulder. It wouldn't feed through and that left me with carrying it by hand. I don't mind carrying by hand to work out my arms, lol, but sometimes the comfort of carrying it on your shoulder would be great. If the manufacturer could look into reconstructing the strap for future products and especially for people shorter than 5'6, lol. Overall, I'll still use the product just not with the strap."
3.0,"The pants do help to sweat off inches- 1 inch off of hips, thighs, calves & tummy in 6 workouts over 4 wks + eating right.  I don't recommend for anything other than running or jogging.  This b/c my pants ripped down the crotch when I did step ups from floor to bench height.  I sent them to my local dry cleaners to have the crotch restitched for a faster turn around than sending back to Delfin.  You can also wear these under other workout pants.  Easy to launder... Hang dry only.  Love the pocket for my iPod.<br /><br />Will update in a few wks but so far- I'm finding the pants return value for the cost in the form of decent results... Way better than sauna suit, less bulky and more durable than sauna suits."
3.0,The color is not true to picture
3.0,"This bra definitely gave me a better shape!  Boobs up and in. However, like other posts, size was too small. I’m going to order two sizes up and see if that works."
3.0,Heavy duty metal zippers. No frills wallet is exactly as pictured. Limited slots on one side for cards.
3.0,The color is more of a pink rather that red.  I sent back as I did not like the way they looked.
3.0,These were much smaller than anticipated.  Bought to add to a charm bracelet but couldn't  because of the poor quality. I'll figure out a use for them at a later date.
3.0,"They were okay for a few days and then strings started coming out. Low quality stitching and washing tears them up faster, but winter only lasts a few months so they work for a bit."
3.0,I had to have socks to sleep in and I got these at a great deal (so that’s the reason for the 3 stars) & they were comfy however they were so thin you could see through them. If they were made a little thicker they would be perfect!
3.0,They didn't hold up for running very well but survived a 10K which was all I needed.
3.0,"Like this product, but am a little disappointed in how sheer it is."
3.0,"I love the look of this coat, however even at a size too large it doesn't have the look of the picture. Worse than that though are the sleeves. In the picture of the coat I ordered the sleeves are clearly lined in Sherpa. They are not. In fact they are much thinner than the rest of the coat.  I still like the coat enough to keep it, but I will have to line the sleeves with something, disappointing."
3.0,I lIke it.
3.0,"After a few wears it is starting to discolor on my skin.  Otherwise, its a nice piece."
3.0,Xmas gift but first order left out necklace reordered finding it hard to get refund on first
3.0,THIS VEST LOOKS GOOD BUT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH POCKETS AND THE POCKETS ARE SMALLER THAN EXPECTED.
3.0,"Way overpriced.  Hardly any substance to these earrings. Look cheap (sorry).  As a jeweler, I could make these for about $1.50.  I will give them away to a young person 14 or 15 y/o."
3.0,"I absolutely loved these. They looked perfect on arrival, packaged securely. Unfortunately the pin broke while I was trying to unpack it ( It might have been my fault, the way i tried to unpack it, I am not sure). They are absolutely gorgeous, its a shame I won't be able to use them."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, good length, came as described and seen in picture but...<br />1. Don’t recommend for busty women as the chest will be tight<br />2. Shoulders are tight as well so if your broad I wouldnt Recommend<br />3. Order 1 size up because it runs small"
3.0,"I originally ordered the hot pink sunglasses, but when I received them, they were a metallic-y purple pink color. Other than the color disappointment, the lenses are really nice. They block out the sun very well."
3.0,Muy Sintético
3.0,"I was excited about getting these pants for a hiking trip, but they ran really small. I’m returning them. I ordered the XL."
3.0,"Edited: The boys version of these were great. This pink version the mittens were 2-4 year old but the hat barely fit my 22 month old (who has a 44th% head size...not large).<br /><br />We got these last year for my 2.5 year old son and they were so wonderful we got them again this year for my 22 month old daughter. Both my kids have small, short hands so the 2-4T size really fit them from 2-4 years old. I need to order the next size smaller for my daughter for this year but I'm going to save this pair for her for next year.<br /><br />What I was surprised about was the fleece was actually water repellant. Granted, we live in the Utah desert so maybe we have drier snow than most. But my son can play outside digging in the snow for over an hour and come inside with dry, warm hands. The hat is super warm, too. And it fits him well, keeping him totally warm but not covering his eyes.<br /><br />The elastic at the cuff allows me more access to help them get their thumbs in the right hole but they still stay on their skinny little wrists. I always put gloves on first then coat and that seems to keep them on just fine."
3.0,This dress fits well and is quiet cute but cheaply made. No lining.
3.0,"Nice piece. However, the bracket that holds the clasp came apart the first day. A little super glue fixed it right up, good as new. I"
3.0,"The dress is nice and the fabric is lightweight, however, the sizing is much smaller than expected.  I sized up per the previous reviews, but the dress is still way too small.  I am curvy and the cut does not fit properly on my body.  Im busty so the waistline pulls up too high above my waist and looks funny."
3.0,So so. Not like the tv commercials show. Not even sure if it helps at all
3.0,Very bulky/oversized but serve the purpose.
3.0,Nice thick material. Not true to size
3.0,"I am 5'5&#34; and 110lb and ordered a small. They are too short and too loose in waist for me. If I wear them lower, the seam on the back rides right in the crack (uncomfortable). If I pull them up where they are comfortable, they are too short. They also are not tight enough in stomach to stay up when I wear them high. Especially since I got these to wear to gym."
3.0,I’m a 32 DDD and a size two. This fit everywhere except the bust. I went up a size originally then went up again and then too big. Keeping smaller size for pictures but can’t do any swimming in this or boobs will pop out.
3.0,I ordered Large it fits more like a medium
3.0,Taylormade on the cap wad like a decal and not embroidered. Looks cheap.
3.0,Very comfy for summer sleeping or lounging. The lace came off the bottom of the shirt the first time I washed it.
3.0,Super cute but a little flimsy. I lost it a couple of times at home until I lost it for good in the street. I really liked it though.
3.0,Shirts feel wonderful except they are form fitting and not loose like I wanted.
3.0,cute but very thin cheap material
3.0,I wish the fabric was better !
3.0,Very pretty but too small. Will not even take a was of cash easily. Cannot put phone in It.
3.0,The product is ok. You get what you pay for. I bought 3 sets. One necklace broke before I got it out of the package. Definitely get what you pay for. Cheaply made.
3.0,"I bought two size 2XL skirts. I gave them to my daughter because they were far too small. Now I’ve lost a lot of weight and wear a Large/12-14 and the 2XL fits me like a large. Otherwise they’re great, flattering, and look nice for church or work."
3.0,It was small pat still okay
3.0,Fit is a bit tight and you can't wear a thick sock with it. But Love the style.
3.0,"Decent product, feels a bit cheap."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. For the price, this bag isn't bad. It's cute from far away. The inside zipper pocket comes in handy. It just really annoys me sometimes when the metal handles don't stay in place and make the bag go all weird. Like, if you're not careful, and you're holding the bag by the longer shoulder straps, then the metal handles will slip out of place and it looks really bad. It just looks cheap up close. Pretty much, you can do better than this bag."
3.0,it can't be fit everyone.
3.0,Great pair of socks... will last ......but the  compression  diminished  after 1 week  of daily  use 12 hrs shifts .
3.0,"Love this purse. Can easily fit phone, lipstick, compact and a few extra item. Looks amazing. Going to use for daughters upcoming wedding."
3.0,"The stone is thinner than it appears. It was more translucent and not as deep a green.  I understand that each stone is different, but I just wish I got a stone that was closer to the picture.  The quality wasn't there."
3.0,This tie was adequate although not quite as elegant as pictured. The colors are dark with no yellow at all. I would not purchase it again.
3.0,"I have tried many brands from high end to affordable so I know what works and what doesn't. Overall the leggings are great, the material is sleek and super stretchy but overall the leggings run very TRUE TO SIZE, amazing quality stitching. I got it in the color Dark Rose Red and I give it a 7.5/10 for squat proof (with dark and colored underwear). It does go sheer when stretched but if you're wearing neutral or no underwear you should be fine. The biggest thing that made me give this a 3 star is the waistband. It is double-lined with the fabric so it's already thick, but it has a THICK SEAM (1 whole inch wide) running at the top of the waistband and it's very compressing, making it hard for me to get it past my hips and also very uncomfortable because it keeps digging in. It's a shame because everything else fits fine and I love the material. For reference my measurements for waist and hips are 28 and 40. I got a Small in these but if I go up a size there'll be a lot of extra fabric since the material is super super stretchy already. Hope this helps."
3.0,"I really want to like this skirt and I keep putting it on thinking I’ll change my mind. The top of it looks very cheaply made, think of like a scrunchy. The pockets make the hip area stick out funny and the liner underneath is short if you pull it up above your hips."
3.0,"They're pretty, felt decent at first but didn't last long at all. Now a few months later the wires are broken and painful."
3.0,"For a ok.<br />But it is very scratchy on the wrist.<br />And also, it smells like rancid laundry. Like when you leave the cloths in the washer too long."
3.0,"Simple, cheap, nice design"
3.0,Fit great and really comfy material but the design isn’t as pictured. It’s the same design just different placement.
3.0,Runs extremely small but very cute. Will gift them.
3.0,I needed a medium to large fit.  These said they were one size fits all so I should have known better since I have trouble finding glasses that are wide.  I ordered Suncloud Rachet in 2012 and those were great fitting glasses.  These were tight and pressed in at the sides of my head.  The lenses were very nice and I think I would have liked these if they were just a little wider.
3.0,"I am a retired MD-physiatrist. I have prescribed compression hose for vascular, neurological, orthopedic, and burn-related conditions hundreds of times over a 30-year career. I am also a patient and have relied on these stockings for the past 10 years. This review is independent. I receive no monetary gain from any source related to these products. I do this solely for the public benefit.<br /><br />All of these stockings are knee-high. Thigh-highs are always the best, but patient compliance is terrible. I never wanted to wear them, and so I could not expect patients to do so.<br /><br />These are all rated 20-30 mm of mercury in compression despite listings describing them as anything between “moderate” and “extra-firm.” Any product with less may be nice for comfort or cosmesis but will do little by way of therapeutic intervention.<br /><br />RATINGS and observations:<br /><br />1 JOBST for men knee high closed toe compression stockings, extra firm legware for all day comfort for males, with odor control technology.<br />The gold-standard but like gold, very pricey. Best fit and function. Best quality. Very plain in appearance. They need a “hike-up” once during the day. No loss of function after 10 uses and washes.<br /><br />2 FUTURO restoring dress socks for men, firm compression, over the calf.<br />Definitely #2. One quarter the cost of Jobst. Good fit and function. Good quality. No daily hike-up needed. Nicer appearance than the Jobst. Excellent wear-and-tear. I used 3 pair continuously over one year in clinic and noted no loss of function. My neuropathic symptoms resolved over a few weeks of use. Of interest, Amazon’s rankings wherein the Physix below were rated #1 did not include the Jobst or Futuro.<br /><br />3 GO2SOCKS compression socks for men women nurses runners medical stocking maternity travel.<br />Inexpensive. Can cause discomfort if not donned optimally but good therapeutic compression. Good quality and “daughter-impressing” appearance. No daily hike-up. No loss of function over 10 uses.<br /><br />4 AMES WALKER AW styles 120 125 150 compression knee high socks.<br />Inexpensive (all are compared to Jobst). Excellent compression but painful after a few hours use despite adjusting fit. Good quality. Look like P.E. socks. No daily hike-up. No loss of function after 10 uses.<br /><br />5 PHYSIX Gear compression socks for men & women graduated athletic fit for running, nurses, shin splints, flight travel & maternity pregnancy.<br />Definitely NOT #1. Inexpensive. Good fit but non-therapeutic compression. Nice appearance which with ease of donning undoubtedly accounts for their popularity. No daily hike-up. They give less compression after each wash. I cannot recommend these as a physician because of non-efficacy.<br /><br />6 COPPER Compression Socks for men & women.<br />Cheap. Poor fit and little function. Poor quality. OK appearance. Hike-up N/A because they do not cover the calf with initial donning. They become looser with each wash and are no better than regular socks in function. Not recommended."
3.0,"Not fitted, not tall, just a typical quality shirt."
3.0,The onesie was pretty. The tutu really was  not what I expected.  Too long and not too fluffy
3.0,"This could have been a really cute dress. The horizontal lace parts that go around the abdomen and legs are very see through. The one on the belly hits where my mom belly sags in the front and hits on my butt in the back, so you'll see my underwear and lower belly area if I don't have a slip on under it. The rib area also fits really small."
3.0,"I wanted a quick fix with the tassels earring trend and I thought the rainbow was a good option to wear with different outfits. I like everything except the gold ball on the top, it makes it look cheap. Otherwise it's a great price for a quick fashion trend. The earrings brush my shoulders slightly but I found the length fun and different. not heavy at all."
3.0,It came early but the Latch was broken on it..its cute and doesn't have a long chain..you get what you pay for!
3.0,Muy pequeño y una sola prenda
3.0,"Ive been on a quest to find good affordable sport bra for running, and every sport bra I find doesn’t help the girls to stay secure, and sadly this one included. The fabric and fit are perfection, but the girls are still (figuratively) hitting me in the chin every time I go running. I’m a 36 DD and got an extra large for extra love, and again it fits perfectly, no overflow on the sides, bottom, top, or back. And now I just bought two medium sized ones to hopefully gain some of that security for my chin, but who knows. All this money on bras I should just take my chances on a breast reduction.<br />Edit: got the smaller bra, no bueno. Still a lot of bounce, and is now painful cause the band of the bra is too tight"
3.0,Fits ok skirt was super wrinkly from shipping
3.0,I stinkin' loved this case and I had it for a few months but it broke and I am so sad about it. I got compliments on it always. So sad it did not last long
3.0,The sandals is ok
3.0,"they are ok, kind of big on my face, but otherwise nicely made and very dark, which is a good thing<br />overall I like them they get an &quot;ok&quot; vote"
3.0,"For the price they are fine, I just find them to be a bit skimpy"
3.0,"pretty much as pictured.  Cute bag, but for the price I was expecting a inner zipper pocket and a closure.  Also material is cheap vinyl, I doubt it will hold up long.  The handles look thin, but are well attached."
3.0,The keychain has a nice sentiment.  The case it was put in was a bit cheap and broke easily.  I ordered a few of them and one was a bit scratched but could still be used.  Overall okay.
3.0,"I ordered a large, waist is a 30, B cup bust. Bikinis are difficult to buy when you're small on top and large on the bottom. The top of this fit a bit loose, and the bottom looked like I had a wedgie instead of fitting as pictured. Cute bathing suit though."
3.0,"I have large round glasses and these are the same size as the clear ones my cousin gave me, which didn't say large size when he bought his. They don't fit my glasses well, but I need them for work and I like that they're kind of pink than red. They are also cheap for 3 pairs, altho I don't have a use for the other 2 pairs."
3.0,"Bought the gray dress, loved it. The fit, the fabric, the color. 5 stars. So I bought the same dress in black. It took longer to arrive and was made with a much cheaper fabric. The fit was tighter in the arms and much shorter even though I ordered the same size. Will be returning the black dress. 3 stars for inconsistency."
3.0,"I love the color, fit, stretch. It's just not a robe like sweater dress like I expected. More of a long sleeve hooded dress. You expect robes and sweaters to be snuggly and warm. This is lightweight and convenient."
3.0,"The blouse is pretty, but 2 XL fit like a large.  Tight in bust/torso"
3.0,"Some of the charms weren't really to my taste but overall, a decent mix at a decent price."
3.0,There are NO toes!
3.0,Sizing was incorrect. Gave it to my sister and it fit nice. Loved the colors.
3.0,I have 10.5 sized feet.. is not snug. Was hoping more comfy... It's okay..
3.0,Not bad not great
3.0,My wife thought they would be thicker.
3.0,"I ordered these boots with the intentions of using them as snow boots. They are super cute and very comfy; however, the tongue disconnects from the rest of the shoe and I felt as though snow/water would easily get into the boot since the tongue goes so far down the boot. I sent them back with no difficulty. They are very stylish though and I would recommend them to somebody wanting them for looks."
3.0,"I like the material and the look of it but it is always slipping off my head, It's snug fitting which is fine but that makes it slip more. I wish there was a larger silicone band on the inside to help with the slipping"
3.0,"Pensé que era más grande, una pena porque me quedo chica de busto, pero el color es preciosa y bien fresca la<br />Tela"
3.0,"I love the wide brim, the pony tail cut out n the tie that prevents it from blowing off. I don't like the way the brim bends at the front of the face since that's how it was folded. The bend is permanently in the front n is not as cute as in the photo. I have to try to rebend so I can see."
3.0,The slippers just fell off of my feet.  I gave them away.
3.0,"First, I have to comment on Rock Ridge Sale's customer service.  They made a mistake on my order, but were very quick and professional about making it right.  I would happily buy from them again.<br /><br />These coins are very bright with a nice shiny black paint - they look really nice.  They don't ring like real coins, but are just the right size - just ever-so-slightly smaller than a half dollar.  My half shell fits nicely over them with just a little bit of wiggle room.  I thought the price was a little high, but still fair.  Overall, they are a nice little prop that will add a little extra mystery to my routines.  (They're not gaffed, but people always think a ""magic"" item like these coins have some extra trickery going on - perfect for an additional distraction!)"
3.0,Did not like this shirt.  It does not hang at all like in the picture.  It’s stretchy but super clingy.  Lays  weird around my chest.  Makes your boobs look droopy
3.0,Very small and uncomfortable!
3.0,Tangels to easy. ! But I did get a lot of complements.
3.0,"Ordered according to size chart, still a bit snug."
3.0,I don't feel like these are going to last a very long time. They run a tad small. I have size 11 feets.
3.0,Didnt get to wear it much.
3.0,"I thought since it's unisex it's gonna run a little big for a woman, but my tiny sister could bearly fit size S, it's thin and the hood is too small to fit the head. Overall it's cheaply made and not worth the money if someone wants to wear it daily not only as a costume."
3.0,"The mask is all scratched up. It almost looks used. For what I paid for this mask, it shouldn't look the way it does."
3.0,"Comfortable, nice looking, but they are not snow boots.  They are more like rain boots because I was sliding in the snow.  Will only buy again for the look and comfort of the show.  Not the name of the shoe."
3.0,"This was a gift for my wife; the watch is beautiful; it is very clearly a cheaper version of the Daniel Wellington watch, and it did not disappoint. I have an actual Daniel Wellington, and there were no obvious differences. I would recommend this watch (and it looks great with a dark green NATO strap which I also purchased), but the clasp felt cheap and we still are having trouble getting it to stay clasped."
3.0,Too loose kept falling off my head.
3.0,It’s cut super low- my 18 month year old had a couple nip slips. Was super thin with no liner so it’s see through when wet.
3.0,"reasonable price,but T\the lenses loosen easily."
3.0,"This belt is just okay for me. Bought it for work but have trouble keeping my shirt tucked in in front. Also is pulls hard on the belt loops in front, and I worry with prolonged use they might start to tear. However if I loosen it to lessen tension, it doesn't stay up. Only plus was not have to unbuckle."
3.0,"I was surprised to find, after only wearing once or twice (I do NOT put in dryer)...the seam in the front is coming undone (3 small holes at the seam)."
3.0,Loved the product but one of the straps broke the first day of wearing it.
3.0,"Look expensive in pictures and far away but material is very cheap, I mean for the price I should’ve known :) but you can’t tell if you’re just looking at them"
3.0,Pretty Sterling Silver earrings but  smaller than expected
3.0,"Some of the sets were perfect, others had color mis-matches and/or rough edges.  But I just wanted something a little fun for the holiday season, so its not the end of the world."
3.0,This dress fit nicely but was cheaply made. I was afraid it would fall apart when washed. Returned.
3.0,We have never wore at the picture looks better than the product that I received. I'm sure eventually we will wear them just not my favorite
3.0,They look great but very uncomfortable and hard to breath in.  By the end of the night we end of having it over our head.  Also it cuts into your check.
3.0,"I love this clothing line (have several pairs of their stuff) but this one seems mislabled. While there is some skinny tapering towards the bottom, the butt cuts are definitely relaxed fit. So, be aware of that. Distressing works and overall okay jeans."
3.0,The inseam is uncomfortable and binding.  Might be related to my large rear end. Material is soft but pills easily.
3.0,Definitely NOT worth $30 because of the material and the fact that it is not lined but it’s cute though. 3 stars. This dress should be $19.99 to me
3.0,"I liked them, except one of them wouldn't stay closed. I was afraid that I was going to lose them. I had to send them back."
3.0,"I love this bathing suit. However, the bottoms are on the larger side and the top around the stomach area runs small. I wish I could have ordered medium bottoms with a large top. Also it’s more of a light blue not mint. Very comfortable."
3.0,A few of the links were loose and one was off in the bag with a charm. Thank God it was a simple fix. Love the look of the necklace.
3.0,"As another reviewer said, not very comfortable. I could easily manage an hour in these once I broke them in but anything beyond that and my feet & toes start to go numb. Worth the price & not returning regardless.<br /><br />Also, the shoes fit true to my size, 7. Another reviewer said otherwise. IDK!?"
3.0,"Lets start with the positive, shall we?  I ordered silver white and the color is gorgeous.  The wig came package very neatly. All I had to do was remove the protective netting and give it one good shake and all the lovely waves fell into place.  But this is about where the &#34;pros&#34; end.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The wig cap is small.  I have an average side head but the cap fails to cover the sides of my hair.<br />The fibers are very thin and the wig is not very full which leads to the wig cap being really visible at the top and back of your head.<br />The bangs are very heavy and uneven.  Styling will definitely be a challenge here."
3.0,It worked quite well for the first couple of weeks but then all of the sudden my skin started producing rashes from the product and now whenever I use it my entire lower torso turns red and bumpy.
3.0,My son liked it but I think it is a bit bulky.
3.0,Cute little sunflower pendant but I purchased 4 with different initials and got 2 only! Amazon used to be a “joyful” platform to make my online music purchase but Nót anymore! It has changed for the worse!
3.0,The material is light & breathable but it’s pretty long on my husband & looks a little awkward.
3.0,The pendant is very pretty but the chain is extremely chap and broke inside of a day.
3.0,"Unfortunately I am not able to try this sweater on since I received a size  Small and I usually wear XL. So I will just review it the best I can without wearing it. It looks like it is true to size from what I can tell, but would fit best on someone with a small torso or somone VERY petite.<br /><br />The material of this sweater is on the thin side, but is not so thin you would have to layer to avoid  seeing through it. The material seems to be a soft material that doesn't itch.<br /><br />The v neck color does not seem overly large or wide. The front of the sweater appears to rise up much higher than the back. This could be a nice design if you want to show off a decorative belt/buckle around the waist of your pants."
3.0,Poor quality fabric.  Not folded nicely just stuffed in a bag and all wrinkled
3.0,"If you’re looking for something stylish, this looks like a bandaid. I’m fine with just the build quality"
3.0,"Good quality sunglasses but the Lens width is not 63 millimeters.  It's WAY smaller, I wouldn't consider it oversized in the least.  It might be 50mm width."
3.0,it is what it is n it is small...daughter uses it for her gum n money n id
3.0,"The ring overall is pretty and you get what you pay for. If you're expecting a spectacularly detailed and expensive looking ring, look elsewhere. I bought 3 rings for my sister, mother and I. The rings were not identical. They each had their imperfections. The flowers weren't nearly as detailed as they are in the picture and the inscription was small and smudged. Like I said, overall, it is a pretty and cute ring, but it doesn't look exactly like the picture. It's kind of like a hit or miss. My ring was pretty decent, but my sister's was slightly messed up. The sizing is accurate though and the metal is nice and sturdy."
3.0,"These are slightly small for their listed size, but they are wearable, and stretch out to what would probably be normal size."
3.0,The dark brown band is very dark and it’s hard to see the “C” logo.
3.0,Beautiful except that the black finish came off within 2 months. I tried to reorder but it is no longer in stock.
3.0,They need a x-small size
3.0,this is a very shiny piece. It is also very light (hollow). Its worth the price but not meant for long term use
3.0,"Beautiful shirt but even thought I ordered a XXLarge, which usually dwarfs me is way too small. Can't get it on. Money down the drain. Looks like a child's shirt. Many sizes to small. Looks like a child's shirt. Very disappointed."
3.0,"Seemed like a good idea at the time, but it is too large to wear on my clothing.  The product itself has no flaws, just a poor choice on my part."
3.0,Super cute shirt. Runs SO SMALL! I would go up 2 sizes
3.0,"Light weight. Had them over 4 months now, still in good condition."
3.0,Just way too tight and they feel hot. Returning.
3.0,"The hat is adorable! The plastic shield? Not so much. I've had it hanging out since I received it so it would take out the wrinkles, but they're apparently permanent. The shield is shipped ROLLED UP then flattened into the hat and then, I guess, was thought to magically delete all those flattened rolls after opening the package?? Not a lot of care was given to prevent this obvious failure. My next attempt will be to put a hair dryer to it and pray that I didn't just buy a cute hat..."
3.0,It’s cute but a lil baggie because of its stretching material
3.0,they are okay. fit my head but are fairly cheap and don't really look like anything other than 80's headbands. For the price I can't really complain. I expect them to keep the sweat out of my eyes during at home workouts.
3.0,"The paint was super sloppy, and didn’t look like the picture. I had to repaint and seal them, but I guess if you pay cheap, you get cheap."
3.0,I gave three stars because the bras we're very good price so I was not expecting much. The straps broke easily.  It tore the fabric so you can't reattach the straps.
3.0,won't fit a pair of 54&#34; jeans
3.0,Comfy and fits well. But can't be worn with any kind of pad or pantiliner because they don't stick!
3.0,I loved it so did my daughter but i ordered it too small 😞
3.0,"I got this for my Grandson who lives a state away, he is a big 3 years old (weighed almost 10 lbs. at birth) and my daughter in- law says it fits that's all I can go by."
3.0,"Fit is somewhat &#34;snug&#34; - nothing to rave about, and I expected thicker inside padded sole."
3.0,Leather began delaminating at the tougue holes.  I thought it last longer than two years.
3.0,Loved this watch but the face was scratched.that’s why I give it a 3 star and I wish it had a day date
3.0,The lollipops are terrible quality. The other charms are all beautiful. Good for beginners. Other than that purchase in bulk from a wholesale.
3.0,"Fits alright and quality was good, but I was expecting orange dots (for a halloween costume) and they are actually red. Oh well."
3.0,More white than beige. It will fulfill my purpose.
3.0,I'm 5'7&#34; and wear a size 22 dress. I purchased this in a 4x which fit perfectly. This dress is short (think a lot of leg and high up the thigh)  and to me it's more ideal for a bathing suit cover up than a casual day dress. In fact another reviewer mentioned wearing hers on a Jamaican vacation and I made a mental note to remember to pack this for my beach getaways this summer. You could dress this up but if you're uncomfortable with a lot of leg showing or your booty showing you won't love this.
3.0,These were way to long for me
3.0,When they arrived two of the stones had fallen off the frames. Did not like that.
3.0,Didn't like the color of it.
3.0,Very comfy but short in length
3.0,Zippers broke after a month. Still usable but slightly annoying. Ok for price.
3.0,"The white band had the metal piece defective. I did use it 2 times but I decided not to force my Apple watch because I was afraid this band would break inside of it. When I took it out, the metal went off. Good thing my watch was ok."
3.0,"They do not stay on that well,but it might be the way I affixed them. I used glue specifically for rubber and still they didn't stay on."
3.0,Very Thin & kinda clingy
3.0,This dress does not fit like XL but I like the dress
3.0,Wasn't what was shown.
3.0,"Okay i gave this 3 stars because its pretty but!, its extremely small you better have a bone-eeeeee wrist (which i do) but, it scrapes my arm taking it off also the ring is easy to snap off not what i expected also it has bells on it that jingle and make noises. overall its very pretty but uncomfortable and small"
3.0,"The bag is just okay. You get what you paid for. The front flap has a magnetic button but it’s not that strong, so the flap is flopping up and down when wearing the bag."
3.0,"Great bag with a nice look.  Unfortunately, the zipper broke within a month of the purchase.  I'm still using the bag, but I wish the zipper was functional"
3.0,"The “baby pink” color is not Baby pink, it is PEACH/orange. For some reason I was thinking this was a cottony type dress, it’s not. It almost has a sheen to it. It’s not floor length and I need a size up. If the color was right, it wouldn’t be bad, but 3 stars."
3.0,"Cheap, shiny material."
3.0,I didn't realize how plastic it was for the price.  It came quickly and it's a funny little thing.  It just wasn't what I expected.
3.0,A little in the small and long side. Ordered two pair and not super happy
3.0,Cute but big and doesn’t line up
3.0,"The material isnt stretchy so it is hard to get over your head and is also tight since there is no give. I remedied the problem by cutting off the neck and sleeve finish and that gave the dress a lot more stretch. It also gives it a more punky look which I like but might not be for everyone. Definitely order to fit your chest measurement or your hip, whichever one is bigger. Other than that, I love the dress and have worn it multiple times!"
3.0,"It's OK, a little thin but what I expected for the price."
3.0,"Too small and no stretch, unfortunately because it was cute!"
3.0,"i liked it, i did, but they were bent weirdly. i expected them to obviously be a little twisted but these looked more than twisted. they were a little big but i personally didnt have an issue with getting them in. If you want them to fit, take an old earring, insert it into your ear and sorta wiggle it a bit, to stretch it open wide enough for these to fit. Now these wont stretch your ears out so wide, no, its honestly about the same size as your regular piercing,"
3.0,"It's a bit clingy and not as flattering on me as I had hoped. I guess I better lose a few pounds! Also I ordered the Navy and it's not very navy looking, it's a lot closer to black. I'm hoping the more I wash it it'll lighten up a bit. I love the pockets though! If you're skinny go ahead and order this."
3.0,you can see the cup lining in the bra which is awkward because its like a random piece of material over your boob area.
3.0,They work as expected but you gotta wear a belt or it’ll look funny. Not as good as new pants. Lol
3.0,"Cute and nice looking, packaged well, seems decently made, but the sizing is way off. I normally wear a M or L (which would be comfortably loose), and I have a very normal size, shape and proportional distribution, but I ordered an XXL because it said it ran small. The top is plenty loose but the bottoms are unusually small compared to the top, the waist is fairly high, with a thin (1/4”?) elastic band that is disproportionally smaller on waistband. When I out them on, the fabric is big in the waist and the legs are snug to where I cannot fully bend them at the thigh. The pant legs would fit if I were actually a size small but the waist would be excessively baggy fabric and the top would he huge. Just weird. I had purchased two sets in different colors but I will return them both. I do not recommend these unless you are a size small, order XL or XXL and like your pj’s baggy and weird fitting."
3.0,"I wore this once, but it just felt cheap so I gave it away shortly after."
3.0,"something I was shocked with was that the cotton % in each color within the package is different. some are 100% cotton, some are 85%, and some are 60%. it makes no sense to me to buy one package with different materials. Also, pay attention to the fact that they are too small and low rise. I'm 6' 2"" and I wear large in all underwear brands, but these are too small to be comfortable, and they look like leaf covers Adam used back in the time!!"
3.0,Yellow tank arrived stained from being packaged with a black and a red tank
3.0,"Mediocre, but not bad for the price. Material isn't the best of quality"
3.0,"Beautiful, except it does not fit on my wrist, considering I have a small wrist"
3.0,Got the tail...it’s amazing! No ears were delivered 😕
3.0,Really cute shirt but the “knot” along the bottom lays oddly and makes me look like I’m smuggling something in my crotch.
3.0,look alright..
3.0,I was super excited to get this on my 9 month old son but it fits so small! The12-18 month one was way smaller than expected. The top part fit awesome but the legs were tight and barely came down to his knees. The outfit is super cute though!
3.0,"This jacket is ok, but not right for my husband. I ordered the brown. It feels wide on him and looks bulky on him. My husband is 6'2"", around 185lbs and this jacket and I ordered it in the size large. I would have returned it unfortunately. It could look better on ""thicker"" guys. The material is nice and I would consider it a warm winter jacket."
3.0,Great shirt but runs small. Need to buy at least one size up.
3.0,They are okay just not as comfortable as I thought life stride would be
3.0,Came pretty fast. But almost all the nose studs have the velvet stuck to them from the holding case that it comes in. Some of the studs are misshapen which makes the stones sit off. None have fallen out yet.
3.0,Nice belt. But needs a better latch because the belt tends to slip when moving around and the belts width is small at about 1&#34;
3.0,Super soft but just after a few washes the side pockets seams are coming off
3.0,"It is not as sturdy as I would think it should be and below proves that.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Unit is nicely polarized. Not the best I have seen but it will do.<br />- Unit if pretty flexible. Although you will hear some parts creak when putting them on face.<br />- Unit feels so light you will forget they are on.<br />- The case it comes with is really nice to protect the unit<br />- the lens cloth is soft and non damaging. Leaves no oil residue<br /><br />Now to the Cons and there are more than I would have liked to see:<br />- Unit is not as dark as it really should be on the lenses. This sometimes makes it questionable if they are actually worth it since I still have to squint sometimes when wearing them while driving.<br />- The gel nose guards in warmer weather will almost seem to adhere to your nose making an impression when you take them off. Even though the unit is light it give the same look as a heavy pair of sunglasses and sometimes can hurt.<br />- The unit creaks when putting them on... Though this may not be something to complain over it sounds like they could break (and they did)<br />- The lens themselves are not secured well at all. The nose side of the secure point is on the very TIP of the lens leaving only a hairline of support for the screw. (This is what is broken for me)<br />- The lenses also do not cover your entire eye viewing area and the bottom half of your vision is left almost 50% uncovered. While this may be good for looking at a phone, it is very annoying in all other situations.<br />- The lenses also sit very far from your upper cheek bones and so almost looks like the glasses are too wide sitting on the face. I don't know if this is a structural flaw for me or if this is all units.<br /><br />On to my biggest complaint:<br /><br />I will be contacting the company but while gently cleaning the sunglass lens the one lens came out on the side closest to the nose piece. this is where I noticed there is only a hairline from the screwhole to the edge of the lens and either it was previously broken in manufacturing or the slightest pressure is what did it. The other lens is fine and feels firm.  I would home the company would replace the lenses in this with ones that have more sturdy holes and lenses that are darker seeing that I feel like there is no protection really. (a person should not easily see your eyes behind glasses."
3.0,"This dress is really cute and flattering, but I was a little surprised by the quality of the material. The print is great and the fabric is thin, but not super stretchy. It was barely stretchy enough to pull down for nursing. Due to the fact this was the most expensive nursing top I got, I expected the material to be better. Instead I found it to be one of the cheaper-made tops. Also, this is definitely not long enough to be a dress! I was a medium before pregnancy, and ordered a medium for my post partum nursing wardrobe. The length in the front was pretty short, sans pregnancy belly. The back was completely inappropriate without leggings. I wish I had gotten a large.<br /><br />The pros are the pattern and style is very cute. Not sure it’s really worth $35, though."
3.0,The material was a little more plastic looking than I expected. It was okay for the price.
3.0,They are pretty but very thin and the “cork” design is not two sided. Not what I expected but for the price I’ll keep them.
3.0,Stretch out and don't stay close to neck
3.0,"After couple of months, when I was opening it it broke. I forgot to review the product but now I thought I should.<br />Design and fitting is good but it’s not that stable to last long ."
3.0,Not the material I was expecting. Felt cheap.
3.0,"Looks pretty good.  It is too heavy and large to use as a necklace. I needed to replace the battery when it arrived. The applique Dragon stands out on the case and I worry it may be knocked off, so the watch is more of a show piece as opposed to practical."
3.0,Beautiful earrings but didn’t last one wear before they feel apart. Disappointed because I loved them and received a lot of compliments. Needs to be made with stronger material to keep it together.
3.0,"The size was a little smaller that I imagined, which could just be personal preference. It comes as a thin piece of what I belive to be aluminum and the nylon textured band is really small. Not the most comfortable band nor best quality. It sucks because the hidden cloud is hard to find so I guess beggers and be choosers..."
3.0,It huge but very pretty.
3.0,"It's yellow.  A pretty, butter-yellow but yellow. Otherwise it's fine."
3.0,I ordered this dress in 2 different patterns (black and white and the blue and white). The black and white was a little longer than the blue (which I couldnt wear at work).
3.0,I would buy a size smaller if you want them to fit.
3.0,Material is cheep
3.0,"Very pretty purse.  Hardware and leather looks good.  Roomy inside.  I returned it because the zipper hangs out so far on one end, you can't tuck it in.  It was also hard to zip, even though the zipper was very sturdy.  Also, the opening is very small.  Hard to look for and pull anything out of the purse."
3.0,The product is nice. Too small for my friend.
3.0,Me pareció bien.
3.0,Way too big.  Gave them to a friend.
3.0,"These were okay, they were cute but practically one size making it impossible to wear them at different places and lengths on your fingers."
3.0,Have worn this three times and gotten lots of compliments and fit is good. However it does feel like fast fashion. Fabric wrinkles easily as well
3.0,They work OK but they do not strecth
3.0,Top is longer than expected. So it would better to be worn with legging than jeans. I Like the printed sleeve pattern but not a big fan of the material.
3.0,Love the color.  More wrinkles in this fabric.
3.0,A little small and not exactly what I expected but still good.
3.0,Even though it said red - it looks like a deep brick in the photos so I had no idea these would be bright cherry red. Not really my thing and a faulty photo doesn't help.
3.0,"This dress is cute.  And the material is thin and perfect for summer.... BEWARE, this dress is HUGE!!!!  I am usually a XL in everything.  I got this dress in an XL and it swallows me!!!!!!  I cannot stress enough HOW BIG THIS DRESS IS.  Go down at least 1 size, maybe 2.  One big issue I see with going down a size (especially if you are large chested) this material has ZERO give and was snug around my shoulders and upper back, even though the rest of the dress looked like a moo moo.  Even with a cute belt, this dress looks ridiculous on me.  So it will be going back."
3.0,"Very boxy, color faded"
3.0,These would fit an adult.
3.0,The band size runs about a size small.
3.0,"These pajama jeans are super comfortable. If that was all I was hoping for, I would keep them. However, they are expensive for what I consider a pair of lounge pants that look like jeans. As for the style, while they could certainly pass for jeans if you decide to wear them out of the house, they aren't what I consider stylish, and the fabric is not attractive. They kind of reminded me of jeans you could buy from Sears, or Kmart. At that price, I had hoped they'd be really cute, AND comfortable. So, back to the seller they go. I would be willing to pay maybe $25 for this item."
3.0,"I ordered a M. I’m 5’ 3” and 120 lbs. The dress is weirdly cut. The length and the waistline are fine but the torso and chest area are not rightly cut. I couldn’t even come close to be able to zipped up the back. The cape is fine. I contacted the manufacturer so I’ll update this review once I hear from it. Very disappointed. I’m asking to get a dress shipped to me before next Friday. We’ll see.<br /><br />Update:<br />The seller was very quick to respond to my message, so I was really pleased with that. Unfortunately, they can’t send me a new dress before the day I need it. They are refunding the money. The customer service was great."
3.0,Liked the fit but it looks like a grandma shirt.
3.0,Love the style of this dress. However I ordered a medium and it's a bit big on top for me. My dimensions are 5ft 3 130 lbs waist 27 hips 37. I will have to get it altered.
3.0,Thin borderline disposal but does the job of keeping my body dry.
3.0,Outfit was nice but didn't fit. It was too small.
3.0,"Not sure how long this will last.  I had hoped it would be from a small seller, but this is definitely a massed produced item.<br />I wish Amazon would stop hiding the seller locations from buyers views.  Its like jumping 20 hoops to locate the sellers location.  I would prefer to support a small business located in the USA.  At least show me where the sellers are located, seriously, why are you hiding it?<br />The item seems made of plastic with a small tin/plastic/metal looking tag.<br />If you dont care where your items come from, than you will most likely be happy with this, honestly had I known, the item would have been more of what I expected."
3.0,smaller than what I thought it would be
3.0,"The shirt is maroon, white and blue"
3.0,My daughter liked them but the bacl of the heel was too short for her. She didn't like how it felt too low at the back of her heel.
3.0,"They’re ok. Just a lot bigger than they seem to be. I ordered a large because the size descriptions and the reviews all said they fit small. I normally wear a medium, but I ordered a large, and they fit like an XL. If it wasn’t such a hassle, I’d send them back, but it’s not worth going through an act of Congress to exchange them right now,(with the whole COVID thing)."
3.0,"This material is amazing and so soft, however even the xxl is under a size 12 for youth. Very small fit"
3.0,"To hard to put on, instep to tight once you get passed that size was ok."
3.0,"Got these for my husband for Xmas. I actually thought they were going to a different fabric, but still gave them as a gift. My husband does not wear these as often as hoped because there is a seam down the front that aggravates his &#34;package.&#34; He said if he is not being very active its not a big deal, but he cant exercise in them. I would not re-order for this reason."
3.0,It doesn't stretch at all so I would.get 2 sized up from what you normally wear especially if your curvy/busty.
3.0,the bottoms are a little small and the top doesnt have pads. other than that fits wonderful.
3.0,Cute but nothing too special. They feel a little cheap but u get what u pay for. Cute variety of styles tho
3.0,The shirt is nice. But I did not receive the correct size for two of these shirts and had to give them to my daughter. The one large one fits pretty nice (a bit on the small side) and is a good quality.
3.0,As can be seen they don’t fit my glasses.
3.0,Not the best quality. Very functional from a size & shape perspective. A-frame shape is easier to pack than the tootsie roll style bags. Zipper will pull apart easily so careful not to overstuff...
3.0,Clip broke off in about a week.  I didn't give a lower rating only because its low priced.
3.0,It's a cute shirt for leggings but it's a little long to wear with jeans I think
3.0,this is well made and the fabric is a thick t shirt fabric with some stretch. I went by the waist measurement and it fit fine.  the color is darker than i would consider royal blue more navy i put a pic of the dress next to what i would consider a royal blue the dress isn't as bright.  I would have kept it except when i put it on there is a seam on the inside lining in the bust that cuts across my bust and is very noticeable on the outside of the dress. this inside lining of the bust should go down to the waist so it doesn't show.
3.0,"I just got these today, so I can’t speak to how they work long term, but here is my initial review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Comes with a hard carrying case & cleaning cloth.<br />Packaged nicely so they don’t get damaged in shipping.<br />Lightweight.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Lenses are more yellow than I expected.<br />They sit too low on my nose so the top almost blocks my vision. (See pics)<br />Not flattering on me.<br />Have a lot of glare. (See pics)"
3.0,I love the style but its quality is bad. It seems very easy to be broken.<br />But it's still a great deal consider its price.
3.0,very beautiful shoes but the size i requested was very big I asked for 8.5 m and They send me12 I do not know why
3.0,I found these to be quite larger than I thought and very cheap looking. However they were for my 6 and y year old daughters and they loved them. The price is fair for the qaulity I suppose.
3.0,"Although the material is very soft and a little thicker, which is nice, this runs way too small! I'm a size 0 and the small strangled me. It looks like its for a three year old. I tried the medium, which looked really small, and it fit. So make sure to order a size up."
3.0,"its cute ,it runs somewhat small. and if you are allergic to cheap metals as I am, opt out for a higher quality choker."
3.0,"It's okay. Really cheap material, looks like it's coming apart before I even used it."
3.0,I had to give it to my Sister because  it was too big for me. It is  a  cute shoe though.
3.0,"I have wanted a pair of flare jeans for sometime, was excited to find these because every other pair I have found were high waisted. Because my figure is straight up and down what is comfortable on the waist will be huge at the hips and upper thigh, these jeans were no different, I ordered the XXL and it’s comfortable at the waist and at least 2 sizes too big (almost look like jodhpurs), of course none of this is the fault of the manufacturer, if you have more of an hourglass figure, I think you will love these."
3.0,"I really like this top, super comfortable and works great when exercising. It was true to size for me. Huge problem for me was the smell. I received it and the smell is so strong. I have washed it 3 times and have tried soaking it in different stuff, but even then the smell faded but hasn't gone completely away."
3.0,I loved this shirt but after several washes the color faded
3.0,"The size on this item said that it was an XXL, when I'm a medium top (I did double check and see if I got bigger, but no, just incorrect tagging), but it was still too small."
3.0,I will try to exchange this one.  It was way too small.  Cute sweat shirt though!
3.0,This broke after less than 90 days of normal use.
3.0,"These are very cute, but not adjustable. I love the colors and the sparkly threads. The material is nice, though I wonder about how it will hold up after a few seasons' worth of wear. These fit my 7 year old's Charlie Brown-sized head, so they're good for both medium-head-sized adults and lollipop-headed children. I probably wouldn't pay $26.00 for these.  The colors are great, the quality seems good though not exceptional. We've also had to cut out the tags so that they don't scratch our sensitive wee ears."
3.0,the material is very poor and uncomfertable i dont recomened it
3.0,"I really like the wallet, but the card inserts are too tight for credit cards or I would have given it 5 stars. I finally just put my cards in the pocket and sort through them as I need them. Bummer"
3.0,I really love this cardigan only thing is that when I ordered another one but in Black the material was not the same. The white one was softer and stretchy but the black one was rough and not very stretchy. But I have always loved this brand and seller. Item arrived in 2 Days with amazon prime.
3.0,"First the good.  I like the design of the face mask as it also covers the front and back of the neck for sun protection. And I like how it stays on by hooking on to the ears.  The solid colors (black, grey, white and beige) are also nice in the 4 pack.  The material is smooth.<br /><br />However, I find it hard to breathe for very long in this mask.  For one thing, it pulls too tightly over the face.  Even though I have a small face, it is so tight I can see the outlines of both of my lips (as well as my nose but less so) through the fabric --which of course makes it hard to breathe.<br /><br />The material is also not very breathable.  In the description of the solid masks it says it is ""COOL ICE SILK FABRIC.""  But per the label (which I translated from Mandarin with Google Translate), it is made out of 93% polyester and 7% spandex, which of course is not silk.  Nowhere in the description does it say it is made out of a polyester and spandex blend.<br /><br />I bought these masks when they were 4 for $25.99.  I see the price has now decreased to 4 for $20.99 for the solid masks.  I also see they have since added to the same star rating, a bunch of patterned masks with logos (some of which say Stop Coronavirus etc), since I bought the solid color masks in mid-late March 2020.  The new logo masks  are a somewhat different material with 100% polyester per the description and a more traditional gaiter design without the ear holes.<br /><br />But if you are buying this mask to protect you from COVID-19, per this NPR article from 4/03/20 (Coronavirus FAQs: Is A Homemade Mask Effective? And What's The Best Way To Wear One?)--this is the wrong material mask.  The article cites a Dr. Daniel Griffin, at Columbia University, an expert on infectious diseases.  Griffin says the best material to use is a tight-weave cotton. ""Don't use a synthetic or a polyester because they've looked at the virus's ability to survive on surfaces, and spandex is the worst,"" he says.<br /><br />I think if the material was cotton with more material at the top, maybe with a bendable nose piece, it would be more breathable.  Also if it was 2 cotton layers, it would provide additional protection from COVID-19 (although of course, not as good as a disposable surgical mask and definitely much less than a N95 mask).  I would buy that design.<br /><br />However, maybe someone with bigger and better lungs would be able to wear these masks without problems. Some of the older reviews really liked these masks so it really depends on the person.  I believe skiers wear masks with a similar polyester/spandex blend in the cold all of the time and they seem to tolerate it.  But if you just want a mask to fulfill the new pandemic requirements to wear face coverings in public, this could work with all the above caveats.  And I must say the new mask designs (that I did not buy) have a lot of personality.<br /><br />I contacted the seller who was very gracious so I increased my star rating to 3 stars."
3.0,Pants a little short
3.0,"I really wanted to love these socks. The '90s nostalgia was the main draw (the colors remind me of Leaps & Bounds, and old PBS kids shows). And while $20+ is way more than I would normally spend one ONE PAIR OF SOCKS, I went for it anyway. First of all, they are longer than I expected. From the pictures they look like ankle length. I know they say ""crew"" so I should have expected longer, but I have wide calves and these would only have worked unless I folded them over, and the inside does not look as nice. Second, and probably most importantly, these are not soft at all! They're not itchy but not soft and not warm. Lastly, the unisex thing makes the toe box area quite wide (and I have wide feet). I think people with narrow feet would be swimming in these."
3.0,The ball said it was a size 3 however it is smaller than the others we have in that size.
3.0,Kind of heavy to wear!
3.0,"This is a very cute shirt and allows for coverage of areas a lot of women have self-image concerns.  One thing I wished what that it was just a little bit longer in length because I have a large bust and it barely came down to my jeans after going over my bust.  I ordered a medium and that is what I usually wear.  I am not sure if I order a larger size if it would make a difference in length or just make it bagging viewing from the side.  I did like the shirt design though.  Not found of calling it Batwing sleeves.  It has very nice lace sleeves and was very flattering everywhere else.  I also am not a fan of the material...it is the polyester/rayon type that wrinkles ease and if you drop anything on it, even water it is there for the rest of the day and wiping it with water doesn't help, just makes a larger stain area until it is washed again.  I feel the design is a good concept with a few tweaks.  I think the fit is better suited for a shorter torso with a smaller bust.  I think body type makes a huge difference in how much someone likes this product.  I did receive this shirt at a discounted rate for my honest, unbiased review."
3.0,It was a little bigger than I thought it would be. I also used it for my tragus so it was really hard to screw the back ball to it.
3.0,Looked nice but the silver rubbed off the end after 4 months or so.
3.0,These are ok. My first reaction was they looked a little on the cheap side. Also they don't cover my eyebrows which I don't like..I feel like I need to wear a hat to block out the sun or constantly squint while wearing them. They will do for the price until I get another pair. One bonus is they seem like they won't break easily and super fast shipping
3.0,"I like the style of this belt, but the one I got said something like 28"" to 46"", but this thing is huge, way bigger than that.  they belt is cool looking, but either something got messed up (packaging also said 28"" on it) or they run very big...  It is a cool latch system closure, once you figure out how to do it."
3.0,The product itself is fantastic .  Comfortable and easy to hand wash.  The seller gave me the wrong colors for 4 out of the 5 bands . ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3.0,Really cute and what I wanted but it Runs about 2 sizes small. Got an xtra large and it looks like a medium.
3.0,"For me, the arm length on this sweater is just right. Unfortunately, the back is too narrow, which pulls the front open. Granted, I have a large bustline, but I ordered a Large and I'm constantly pulling the front together for a little more modesty at work. Agreed that the elbow patches are cheap plastic, but I suppose you get what you pay for. If you want this to fit like the photo, order 2 sizes up."
3.0,"I loved these shoes on my daughter. They were breathable and lightweight. The shoes were easy for her to get into and seemed comfortable. However, the lace holder broke after a few wears and we had to return."
3.0,"Definitely not purple, it is a wine color. Cute enough but not what I wanted. Not sure I want to deal with the hassle of returning them. Guess I’ll just have to look elsewhere for the purple."
3.0,"The pants doesn't really have much in ways of an elastic waistband, so I had to use a safety pin to make the back smaller like they do at retail stores. It was definitely comfy though. The bow was also very flimsy and held onto the shirt by a small safety pin."
3.0,"Not the best hats but you get what you paid for, I needed hats quickly for a family photoshoot and these came 2 in a pack for very cheap. Im happy with my purchase but I wont say theyre the best quality I am satisfied due to the circumstances"
3.0,I bought the blue/purple combo. Figures I didn't read the whole description and missed the part that says the mermaid picture isn't part of the bag. So I was pretty disappointed when I opened the package. But I do love the colors and how lightweight the bag feels. The bracelet is nothing to brag about though.
3.0,"Didn’t receive listed colors, wanted pink didn’t receive, returned"
3.0,Cheaply made. Not worth what they are asking people to pay for it.
3.0,"This swim suite is nice, but there is one thing that bothers me. The green material for the top is not on the inside. When I put on the swim suite, it fit, but right around the cleavage area you can see the white lining popping out. If the entire top was made out of the green fabric, it would have gotten five stars."
3.0,"I love the colors of this tie, but the material is much thicker than other ties and makes it only useful for a few small knots. If you tie a full Windsor it will have this huge knot that is kinda stupid looking. Pretty disappointed, but I guess I should have know not to buy so cheap."
3.0,"Flimsy plastic, but do the job. Bought this as a &#34;gag&#34; gift, and had to travel with it - found it to be a little flimsy, but was expecting that. It was difficult to find anything at a reasonable price, but I think the quality of this product is more suited to a dollar store. I will say it was packaged well enough to protect it during transport."
3.0,I like that they got here before they were supposed  too but I don't think there supposed to be cracked or have long scratchs across them their smooth but u can feel the he'll out of the scratch and cracks.
3.0,I ordered the Small in Red polka dot. It's OK; exactly what you would get for this kind of $ off eBay or Amazon - not really great fitting but really easy and doable. My only gripe is the seam right in the middle of the chest began fraying after only 2 wears and a wash. Not worth the trouble for a return...but still annoying.
3.0,"These are super cute and great for driving. I gave them 3 stars because, for me, they aren’t anywhere near dark enough for actually being outside in the sun. If I can look in the mirror and see my own eyes while wearing them, they won’t provide enough protection."
3.0,"We got this to announce our pregnancy because we love pandas and thought it was adorable. When we got it, it really was so cute. The print was dark and the outfit was made well. But even just looking at it we could tell it was huge. Ordered the 0-3 size because we wanted to bring her home in it but my baby is now wearing 3-6 months and this onesie is STILL way too large on her (pictures included). The design faded after the first wash! Very disappointed in this product.<br /><br />Update: my daughter finally fits in this. She is 6 months old, 18 pounds, and wearing 6-9month clothes."
3.0,"The money clip is strong, the card slots are the right size.  I was expecting something smaller, but this will do until I find something smaller."
3.0,"Comfortable. Eyeglass earpieces slip into felt sleeves to hold them on, this is not very secure and easily pulled apart again."
3.0,Not made to well.
3.0,It’s ok. Not great but the reason for 3 stars is that the color is nowhere near dark pink which is what it’s supposed to be. Should know better when product comes from China.
3.0,It’s ok.  Not the most flattering but it’s fine.
3.0,"It’s okay. The black is cheaply dyed, shirt itself is pretty sheer. A few straggles of thread on seams."
3.0,shirt was huge! pants fit perfect
3.0,"I sent this back because, while the back is ADORABLE, the front is simply very unflattering for someone with breasts, in my opinion. I'm only 32C, but the way the neckline works just makes you look kinda sloppy.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's made well. Good quality. Cute color. Would probably be perfect on someone with A-B size."
3.0,"These are more of a patent leather/plastic look.  Not as expected, but keeping."
3.0,Bought for cosplay. Not comfortable at all especially wearing for long periods of time.
3.0,"My husband chose this wallet for two reasons, and the wallet delivered on both accounts.<br /><br />Positives:<br />-It is really slim and has just enough room for a few cards, ID's, and a small bit of cash.<br />-It is an RFID blocker (which many tech gurus have suggested is kind of a misguided sales pitch and that chip cards don't really even work like that so RFID blockers are unnecessary but it makes hubby feel better).<br />-For the cost, it does look pretty clean. The stitching is straight and even, the leather is all the same color (some cheap leather is splotchy). No frills, very basic, and that alone could be a selling point to some.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-We noticed in the product options that some of the leather colors had a zip pocket on the edge where you see the cash poking out in the images. Some were just an open slot pocket, which is the option hubby chose. The leather colors were limited for the open pocket and the lighter brown leather he wanted wasn't available with that option, a bit of a bummer that he didn't notice that before his heart was set on this wallet.<br />-The far right edge has a slot for one card, but since he doesn't use that slot the edge of the wallet folds over. It feels flat in his pocket, but it looks really cheap and flimsy when it's out of his pocket. He isn't even aware of things like that very often, so for him to notice a flaw has to be pretty glaring. If you want to avoid this problem, either buy a different wallet or make sure to keep a card in the edge pocket.<br /><br />Great for the money. I wouldn't buy it as a gift for someone, but if you are a simple wallet kind of person, you'll be happy enough."
3.0,"Material is rather thin on the socks, but nice variety of patterns."
3.0,I have a septum piercing and I can get the ring in but it never closes properly
3.0,Cute socks but was already a little small before washing them. After washing them they shrank to about half the original size. They were for my 4 year old and now they barely fit my 2 year old.
3.0,"Someone else said it....inconsistent. the solid color is very, did I say very?  I meant VERY thin.  You can see through it and it doesn't fit correctly.  The printed one on the other hand is heavier weight and loosely cut. Debating on if I will return the solid one or both. I might just use the solid as a nightgown. By the way the picture is black but the color says Winered. I wanted black."
3.0,"The roses are much bigger than you might expect.  My 8 year old bought them, and while she likes them, they are pretty big on her small ear lobes."
3.0,"The outfit design was very cute, only needed it for one day so I was OK with the quality not withstanding more than one wear. The detached skirt helped hide the sparkle bones falling off the outfit…really wish those didn’t all fall off bc you could see it in photos."
3.0,"Lovely color and fit, but while I thought a regular length would be ok for me, at 5'4&#34; and size 16 these dragged on the ground, and the boot cut seemed very wide.  I ordered another pair of PajamaJeans in the petite size/skinny, and the length and fit were both perfect."
3.0,the fabric not I espected
3.0,"This clutch is very beautiful. However, it has a foul odor that smells like feet. I didn't notice it until I carried it to a wedding. I was embarrassed to even open my clutch since that's when the odor was the worst. Too bad..I really like the clutch but think I'll have to ask for a refund."
3.0,"I thought this was 14 k gold all the way through. The wording is very misleading. I also found a bangle same material on Macy's online site for $99 on sale and it looks better. I can say I should have looked at the detail of the bracelet before I purchased three and are returning all three. However, they are beautiful, but not wat I expected an found same item for cheaper price."
3.0,Nice slippers.Unfortunately we had to send them back as they were smaller than the size range they listed.
3.0,See through before you even bend over.
3.0,"This is a nice soft shirt- with a very large scoop neck- I think it will be great for workouts- where my sports bra is ok to be seen a bit- it has a nice long length to cover some bum too- might make a cute bathing suit cover up- Maybe if I had really large breast and wanted to show my cleavage this would be perfect-<br />Cute wake and back writing- can be referred to a couple things ! but it is soft-<br />I would probably not have bought this in a store but I had the opportunity to purchase this t-shirt at a discounted cost for testing, inspecting and reviewing. I was not compensated and am not required to write this review. This is my opinion based only on my experience with this product."
3.0,Not bad a little tight but I wouldn't want to go a size up because then they would be too big so they are good. I'm hoping they will be nicer for summer time as they are not the best in the winter.
3.0,"I have a blue shirt like this one, so I thought I knew what I would be getting. Unfortunately the fit is not as expected, and is slightly too large. - I purchased a large because the med blue shirt did not fit, but I think a medium for this shirt would have fit better."
3.0,"Only meant to buy 1 accidently bought 2, but used it as a gift. Really cute and petite."
3.0,It doesnt look like the picture like i had hoped. It shipped from China so may want to check the seller before purchasing. It is cute but very cheap looking. The paws looks like someone cut some material really fast and glued them on. They're already coming off after having it for about 3 weeks and only wearing it a couple times. I will keep it til i can afford a real Spirit Hood or possibly find out which seller sends me the one that looks like the photo with the brown lining on the inside and the cute paws not the glued on ones.
3.0,Somewhat runs small but  acceptable
3.0,A lot smaller than I thought it would be and the strap isn't very long.
3.0,It's far too short.
3.0,Inexpensive...and look it
3.0,"Happy with lightweight, color, and size.  Neck/collar stretched out looking and looks cheap for the pricing.  Would not buy again."
3.0,"Very cute, but it's like more like lingerie."
3.0,I never got to use the black band since the first day when I got them I tried to connect it to my watch and the middle button that fastens it in was missing. On the other bands the more you alternate colors the weaker the button that fastens them in becomes. So if you are buying the bands for fashion (as I was) it will not work out great for you but if you are buying them to put on and leave on then this might be the product for you.
3.0,The neck of this shirt was HUGE. It slid off my shoulders and gapped open in the front. I had to take it to my seamstress to have it reworked and modified.
3.0,"It was a gift, thank you."
3.0,The magnets are not very strong so any movement of the face and they fall out. They’re also so small that they barely hang outside of the nostril and it’s at an angle rather than straight down. Would be great if your nose is the size of a four year old.
3.0,Gloves not plus sized too short
3.0,"If you are expecting a high quality dress for this price then you may be delusional.  It is not particularly well made (ex., some ripples in seams), but I was fully aware that I was not ordering a designer dress. That being said, I was concerned that it might not be full enough to cover my problem area (tummy) but it hid all of my imperfections. I just needed a casual dress for a &#34;white night&#34; party at a Bahamas resort this fall.  This will suit my needs perfectly. I am 5'8&#34; and probably weigh about 170.  The XL was perfect.  The outer layer of lace hit me about 5-6 inches above my knee and the inner lining was maybe an inch shorter.  It was afraid it might be too short, but the length was fine on me. I would agree with a previous reviewer who said that the lace is likely to snag easily.  Although I didn't have high hopes when I ordered, I have no regrets on this purchase. I can't rate it higher than 3 due to construction flaws, but I am glad I ordered it."
3.0,"The shirt needed to be resized. I ordered a large because it was rated too small. However, I had to re-sew the shirt sides to make it fit."
3.0,Overall ok. Size of stalkings way off
3.0,"Okay. It slips a little while playing. So you might need to adjust guitar, again and again, using the neck. I still use it because I am poor to buy another."
3.0,"Cute design, but I noticed just a few day ago that the length isn’t how it was. I’m a huge woman and I like to stay covered at all costs. However, a size 5X shouldn’t start feeling shorter in length now after weeks of having the top. I wash my clothes cold and is typically tumble dry low."
3.0,i like the fabric but the top part is toooo smaaallll so i might wear it as a skirt the finishing is kinda bad for me
3.0,"The mask fabric is good quality but it rubs the bridge of my nose raw. For that reason, I don’t think I would purchase again. Masks come in a sealed bag, and once seal is broken, I don’t believe you can return the product."
3.0,"Great product , just make sure to order a full size bigger then you would normally wear."
3.0,"Nice bracelet, the clasp is the issue for me , almost impossible for one person to hook on wrist. Needs modification or a different design for clasp!!!"
3.0,They are great!  Only received two pair!  No red!
3.0,"I liked it, just fits small"
3.0,"I ordered the L/XL and it's so tight I need to alter it. My natural waist is usually a large, my hips an XL but this fits pretty tight."
3.0,"This replaces a previous review, as I have now purchased two pairs of these. They still have their pros and cons, but the cons are enough so that I cannot rate them five stars. May not buy any additional.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Color, fabric, appearance. These are now (at least quite often) qualified for “Amazon Prime,“ and the price is good, with prompt, no-fee shipping.<br /><br />-<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Tight fit: I have a 38 to 39-inch waist, and purchased US size XL, Asian size 2XL, which the listing shows accommodating wastes up to 40.6 inches, but in fact too tight.<br /><br />Labeling: Amazon lists as 95% cotton and 5% spandex, product when it arrives is labeled 100% cotton. I suspect the Amazon listing is more correct, but don’t really know.<br /><br />Interior “breathable pouch,” for one’s genitalia.  One of the photos illustrates this. The pouch, like the overall product itself, is cut very small. Very tight fit, and when used actually pulls the waist down from the normal sitting. Modeling photos show the shorts worn without the pouch in use. I do not use the pouch, except perhaps for support while swimming.<br /><br />Overall an interesting product, but not my favorite."
3.0,Majority of the bangles came in fine but sadly one came Burnt looking and now I can’t use it.
3.0,It wasn’t what I was looking for. Just too casual for work but cute.
3.0,AS EXPECTED. I PURCHASED THESE FOR MY 6 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE LOVES SCARVES AND ANIMAL PRINTS. SHE LOVES THEM.
3.0,"A little snug, but close to expected."
3.0,the black metal feels cheap waste of money but the company replaced the metal band with the magnetic band and its 5 stars customer service was great!
3.0,"Shirt was expected quality, but the design on it..... it says “suck up buttercup” and completely missed the “it” .... just how?"
3.0,"Ok I like the concept, BUT it shows a man in the picture and it's completely on his shoulders, my man has 22"" shoulders and this doesn't fit on his, I think it's best for a smaller woman or teen  would probably fit, like shoulders no bigger then 16-18 inches wide max. Also my man's neck the Velcro would just barely close, he's a tall guy but average weight around 200 lb so I'm going to need to add some homemade closer to the ends, like I said a child or teen this would be good for, not adults"
3.0,"Decent, I like it but I feel like it can be better quality, does the job but not perfect"
3.0,"I'm giving these a 3 star although I love the design they but, are to big for my 4 year old. In addition to them being too big, they were also missing the strap. So, I returned them to give them a try with the strap. Once, the replacements arrived the next day (cruise 2 days later so, I used next day) these too were missing the strap. After reading the reviews, I see they are supposed to come with the strap. But, it seems they aren't being shipped out. When I contacted amazon for the 2nd time for the same problem, they gave me a refund so, I could buy a strap.  Buyers beware, they are big and would probably work with the strap but, that's if you can gamble to get one that actually have them in the case."
3.0,"I usually wear a size 16 but I ordered a size 18 because most maternity shirts seem to fit a little snug in the arms / chest.  The company messed up and sent a size 20.  After trying on the size 20 they shipped, I know the size 18 I ordered would have fit perfect, and I'll admit I was disappointed.  However, the size 20 is not so large that I would waste my time sending it back. I wear it anyway."
3.0,"For great, but shrunk after washing, even though I air dried it. Color was perfect though."
3.0,"Had the watch about 1 1/2 years.  Love the size and weight.  Great everyday watch.  The problem is that after dropping it on the floor, I cannot get any response from the company about repair or service.  I've left phone messages and sent texts for a month and nothing happens.  I had hoped they would at least communicate.  Be careful."
3.0,I love the color but has a weird fit in the front. Has a a piece of material going through your abdomen and looks so weird!
3.0,Great accessary - especially on a budget!
3.0,This says 0-6 months. It is more like 18 months.
3.0,"GOOD: Color is spot on, length was as advertised, arrived on time with nothing broken. BAD: Very greasy and smells bad.<br />Tried to wash off grease with water and dawn soap and didn't work. Found if you rub down the chain with a fabric cloth after about 5 min per chain the grease is *mostly* off.  Ok for the price but I don't think I'd reorder given the grease and smell."
3.0,Love the style but the fit was much smaller than expected.  I had read that it ran small so I ordered a size larger but it was still too clingy.
3.0,Next time I will order a size up. I ordered my normal size and it didn't fit around my body to tie. I will still use it but I have to leave the robe open.
3.0,These were inexpensive but they came squished in the package so the top was folded over with permanent wrinkles. The back strap broke the first day of my nephew wearing them.
3.0,Should have ordered one size bigger
3.0,"The product is good, especially the rubber tips. I would have liked the springs to be thinner"
3.0,"Wolf Bracelet misspelled - should have letters WOLF, but is WOF"
3.0,"I bought a whole bunch of socks that are high in wool content because I have neuropathy in my feet and they’re always cold. I’m disappointed in this purchase. These are very thick - too thick to be worn with most of my shoes. Some people may be looking for that, but I’m looking for socks I can wear to work. They are also a little tight around the calf, but I have heavy legs. They seem to be of good quality. Unfortunately these are socks I can only wear around the house. The price is decent though."
3.0,"I love the daisy design on this sweater and it is super thick and warm! However, the fit is really weird. According to their size chart, I was between a M and a L, so I sized up to a L. While it fits in the sleeves and bust comfortably (I'm 5'7"" and size 36D), the actual bodice of the sweater is way too big. I'm assuming this is because of the cropped, boxy style but I would say it has an extra 1.5 inches on each side of the bodice. I would suggest sizing down if you are like me and are unsure of which size to get."
3.0,"Does not work to cover around legs. Item is lovely up to 75% then the bottom girth is too narrow and thin, almost like two garments as from the pockets up it is snuggly and perfect. I am small boned and when I walk or sit it comes OPEN so not warm enough, still, need a blanket throw to compensate.  Color and style are lovely, size med worked on top via hips up only and I measure: 34B 27W 35H."
3.0,No design to it... needs a jacket of some sort
3.0,Too small more for a girl.  But I  had ordered a 9 so can't give to my granddaughter.  It is pretty.
3.0,"These gloves are nice. Not very thick yet still provide warmth. If you are seriously looking for touch screen capability, buy something else. These do not work in that whatsoever!"
3.0,Purchased for my husband for Christmas. Did not fit at all. Have to my 15 year old niece who wears a medium
3.0,"The reviews are all negative but it fit just fine on me, it wasn't difficult to put because I used my own bar, tree he bar that it comes with is way too short just fyi"
3.0,The clasp is very hard to open or close.
3.0,It broke the same day that my daughter wore it. It looked like it was hot glued together but it but its so darn cute that I sewed it back together and it's as good as new!
3.0,A very cute shirt.  I was surprised to see the back was a bit see through but decided to keep it anyway
3.0,"Based on the reviews I had high expectations for this swimsuit even though the inexpensive price tag gave me pause. The suit seems well constructed enough, the material is nice and thick, the stitching is good but the photos are very misleading. It would be quite impossible to wear this suit without the straps and the off shoulder ruffles hang very loosely around the arms. This makes it look sloppy. Also there is far too much fabric for tummy control and seems more like a maternity swimsuit. I will be returning it."
3.0,"These are very thin and are not true no-show. They're good for warm days since they're thin, but was expecting a lower cut."
3.0,The necklace is really long and the earrings are kind of deliciously big and heavy.
3.0,good product didnt like style
3.0,"This is a super cute choker that is the perfect size in terms of width. The thing is, it actually like chokes you lol. There is absolutely no stretch at all which is actually a problem because like when you want to look up, your neck stretches a bit and becomes bigger so it really kind of chokes you. I've even tried to put it on looser but it's just pretty uncomfortable and when you have it looser it just doesn't give you the look you're looking for really. Idk I would look for one that has some stretch because of how much your neck moves."
3.0,"the shirt was very odd. it fits in the middle: it’s not too comfy, but it’s the right size, but at the same time, it’s still not right. the shirt is somewhat transparent. not too bad i guess. soly hux can definitely do better"
3.0,alot thinner than expected
3.0,"These shorts are great summer wear, but not for bushcraft. The material is to thin and flimsy, it's parachute like material. With things in the pockets they feel like sacks banging against you. I can't recommend these for active camping."
3.0,"I usually buy these type of shirts for running around, not caring too much about it being a &#34;great quality&#34; since they're so inexpensive, but I truly am NOT a fan of the material and it was actually too short [just past pant button] whereas the picture makes it look like it would be longer.  Just too sloppy for my liking."
3.0,"I plan on wearing this two times for Halloween festivities, and it will be fine for that, but I don't know that it will last much longer. It's not printed on the bottom of the rim, which is too bad (it's just unfinished white material there). It's cute and bright and works fine for a costume. It's on the small size also so for bigger heads it may not work."
3.0,I was very excited to receive these glasses but my heart sank when I wore the pink ones. It doesn't mirror as advertised and barely blocks out the sun. Very disappointed.....
3.0,"They're okay. Honestly, I got better frames off of eBay for less than $2, from China. They DEFINITELY had much sturdier plastic."
3.0,Wasn’t what I expected.  Pants are more like legging or workout material.  Returned item.
3.0,Nice products but a bit see-through. I would suggest wearing something under them.
3.0,Runs very small make sure you read the sizing chart. Not U.S. sizing. But the dress is nice and long well put together colors are rich and vibrant
3.0,Arrived on time!<br />Very soft material as described.<br />Huge on face and defiantly not one size fits all.
3.0,"Great light and armband. I start my runs at about 5 am when it is still dark. The product is described as a ""2 pack"" but it only came with one armband. If had actually received what was advertised...this would be a 5 star review."
3.0,"These boots fit as expected and are warm, but the tread results in ice and snow sticking and building up on the bottom of the sole, resulting in an unbalanced step. I'm not sure why the tread does this... poor design?"
3.0,Not the best quality material but still a very nice dress for a formal occasion.
3.0,Pretty necklace but not easy to put on with small clasp and thin chain
3.0,"This is a functional watch that has several positive features: It is attractive, durable, water resistant and keeps accurate time.  This watch serves its timekeeping duties well in all situations that include work and outdoor activities.  It is fully suitable to both.  The &#34;smartwatch&#34; capabilities and usefulness is limited.  The BT connection syncs time and date.  It can also track steps and shows miles and calories as well.  It tracks sleep and rest.  Via the App you can set alarms that cause the watch to vibrate; however, as of yet, the wake up vibration alarm has yet to wake me up.  You can also set it up to take a phone from a distance, minimally control music functions on your phone and give indications of important calls or texts that you need to check on the phone.<br /><br />The watch is very easy to use and set up after downloading the Diesel On App.  It walks you through everything and gives clear and thorough instructions.  The manual has three steps that gets you to the App and tells you how to sync the phone.  Then the App takes it from there.<br /><br />The watch face shows days of the week on the left and days of the month on the right.  With a push of the button, the watch hands move temporary to those places to indicate day and date.  It shows the alarm time that way too.  A problem with the face is that the days, dates and control function dial are red and tiny.  I am 47 and do not need reading glasses, and I have a hard time determining the number or word.<br /><br />The text and call notifications have been helpful when I am in a situation and cannot hear or feel my phone like on the golf course or other activities.  A problem while golfing is that when I bend my writes the golf glove pushes against the big, middle button causing the watch to show move its hands to show the date---something that would reduce the battery life.  I've only noticed that on the golf course.<br /><br />I find the step count and sleep data interesting, but I have not used it to take a picture or adjust music on my phone besides trying it once.  As a watch, this is a nice watch that I would wear frequently, especially in outdoor, sporty activities.  I have not perceived much additional benefit from the smartwatch elements besides the notifications.  So, I think of it as an expensive casual watch."
3.0,Very pretty a little more delicate than I expected.
3.0,Was a great fit. Form fitting but fabric still had give so I don't feel restricted...
3.0,"Nice quality sweater, I wish it would have fit better. I purchased a small and it fit me like a large, so I had to return it."
3.0,"This was my chance to avoid carry-on and checked bag fees. I was eager to see how much I could fit in an underseat bag. The pros...the dimensions are as described, and the bag actually holds a lot more than I'd planned. The cons...I expected from the photo that it would be a stiffer, molded shape. Instead, it's basically a cheap, thin backpack that arrived flat. Very overpriced. In the end, I'd have done just as well going to the thrift store with a tape measure."
3.0,Love how it's thick. But my son is a 10 in boys shirts and hes a thin kid. But a men's xs small on him a tad tight. Sending back and getting men's small.
3.0,If I had skinny legs then it might be good. For me it just slides down around my knee. If I’m just sitting it’s fine. But I don’t sit for work so not good for me.
3.0,looks too fake
3.0,The product was ok. The jacket zipper was damaged. But the most important is the 2x I ordered was the same size as my current large jacket.
3.0,"Cheap material, feels very awkward on the bottom half, doesn't wash very well and the stripped part isn't near as long as it appears in the pictures."
3.0,Much smaller in person than it looks in the picture. Definitely not worth $70
3.0,Fun hat- my husband loved it!<br />(Unfortunately the 1965 looked to all like 1865 because of the shape of the 9)
3.0,Basically it's to thin for truly cold weather.  Fall is more suitable
3.0,"I ordered an XL, which is what I always wear. I had to give it to my granddaughter who wears a ladies small-medium. I was very disappointed because I love the shirt, but just too small."
3.0,"I love them but they snag easy, got a hole in mine the first time I wore them ... Sadface"
3.0,"It was okay, the appliqué is cracking a little and the neck is weird on it"
3.0,I didn't actually order these. I clicked on it and it was assumed it was an order.<br />I am happy to support the Nepalese women. They are nicely made but not the colors I would have chosen.
3.0,"I ordered medium size dress, but it’s too big."
3.0,Runs too small; not enough strentch
3.0,longer than expected based off description.
3.0,The dress fits great.<br />The problem the back of the dress it was torn
3.0,"Loved the look of this online, but it isn't a y-shaped necklace at all. It's simply a necklace with white pearl accents. It is pretty but the quality seems very poor. Used this as a gift at Christmas. Had I known the quality was lacking, I would have ordered something different but I didn't have time to return and buy another."
3.0,too big but rather than too small
3.0,"Cute socks. They are thick on the soles, thinner up top. Not sure at what point these will fit my baby, but they will likely be too large until maybe about 6 months old. I wouldn't get these for a newborn, which was my age range for my purchase honestly. They are well knitted and seem like they will hold up nicely. The little grippy things on the bottom of the socks will be nice on the floor when he's learning to pull himself up.<br /><br />Seeing as how you only get one pair, I would not buy them again unfortunately. Babies grow way too fast to be spending so much on one pair of socks. Maybe if there were 2 pairs, or 3, I'd reconsider that.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"This is a lovely bathing suit, however, it would seem more beautiful on a person 5'7"" or taller to show off that great sheer pattern at the sides and waist."
3.0,"Great customer service. They fit great but were really high waisted in the front, which didn't look right on my 5'1&#34; petite frame ."
3.0,These were just what I'd been searching for. They are a nice option to use your prescription glasses as sunglasses. The quality & price are great. If you plan to order them be sure to mrasure accurately before ordering.
3.0,"It was a little shorter than I expected, but not too short. It is very low cut so I will most likely wear a camisole under it or possibly wear as a swimsuit cover up on vacation."
3.0,Not a winter sweater. Too thin.
3.0,The seller were good people. these didn't work well for me but I know my niece will love them
3.0,Ordered two. Too wide at the shoulders. Should have returned. Been wearing Russell and Jerzees for years. Will be more cautious in buying their stuff now.
3.0,"So these are nice glasses and look very stylish. I got them because I can’t read the digital dash on my new car. I can’t wear reading glasses the whole time while driving because it gives me a headache. I thought these would be perfect for driving. Well, to be completely honest I don’t see any difference between the top have and the bottom half. Looking at my computer I can read these words from the top or bottom half of these glasses. If I take them off, I can’t read anything. So, I think they might not actually half and half. They are not what I was expecting."
3.0,Seams roll over.
3.0,Was not as heavy duty as I would have liked...however it does look good
3.0,"It’s a nice pajama, very cute, but the title of this item presents it as fleece, when it’s actually cotton (the composition is correct in the product’s description). So it’s good, but not really warm."
3.0,It was a little to thin of fabric . My other ones are sturdy
3.0,"the product is fine for us because we aren't looking for warm socks, but the socks are thinner than expected"
3.0,"This is a nice belt, but I'm giving it only three stars because of a couple of issues I have. In the copy about the belt, they make it sound like a &#34;one size fits all&#34;. This is because they include a tool for adding holes if the pre-punched holes don't create a small enough belt. The problem is that if using the last few holes or new ones you've added, there is a very long &#34;tail&#34; of belt that hangs out past the buckle. Better if they sold at least two different sizes. But as it is, I can't recommend this to smaller women. The other problem is that after wearing the belt only twice, the finish is beginning to come off the buckle. All in all, a good belt for the money, but, as usual, you get what you pay for."
3.0,Wish it had the option to put contact info on the underside.
3.0,"It's a little larger than what I'd normally wear. I'm a 4-6. I wore it when I went swimming at a work related event. I wore it in the water, and it dried pretty quick afterwards, which was great. It's light weight and sheer, I could see my swim suit through it. I wore another top underneath it while I was out and about for the day because I was in a very conservative/religious region, and then took the undershirt off before swimming. It served it's purpose for sure, but it was a little expensive for something I probably won't wear again."
3.0,Very thin material - looks like I made it my self at home. The skirt is short and if I didn't have my swim wear on it would show everything. I am 5'4 and 138 lb I bought size Large.
3.0,"First off, I am not upset with the quality. The printing on mine looked very good. It is a smooth fabric but nothing that will really keep you warm. Anyway, the sizing is way off. I could tell as soon as I opened the package. My first thought was that I had gotten a child sized one. But no, this was indeed meant for an adult. An adult of petite and tiny proportions who can likely dance on a dandelion without disturbing it. I am a bulky fellow. XL or 2XL should have been enough and left room for a T-Shirt underneath, I ordered a 3X, because of the warnings about running small. I think It would still be too small if they offered a 6X.<br />Too much trouble to try to return. I no of a child that likes Star Wars, and he will be getting this as a gift. Be careful when you order. Do not just go up just one size, go a minimum of three sizes larger, and then pray to the deity of your choice. Of course if you are some sort of pixie or an unfortunate victim of a disease that caused you to waste away to a waif of a person in danger of being blown away by the next stiff breeze, feel free to order one size larger."
3.0,"The luggage seemed good overall, however when slight pressure was applied it seemed to give. Ultimately I decided to return it and look for a sturdier material."
3.0,"I purchased this hooded sweatshirt as part of a Halloween costume.  Fit as expected and well made, but the material is a bit cheap.  The kind of rough fleece that captures every single pet hair and makes it hard to remove with a tape roller."
3.0,"This bathing suit is nice however, I take a size medium (6-8) in most everything. I wasn't sure if this suit came from China or not, so I ordered a large. I am returning it, but it I were to keep it, I would need at least an extra large."
3.0,"Very nice legging, but I ordered a medium which I do I everything else.. and they looked as if they could fit my 5 year old daughter."
3.0,"Great for price, with it came with more silicon used to make it to size"
3.0,I wanted to like this SO bad but it was way too short!! I'm only 5'4 and when I put my hands in the air you seen full on rear view! Material was good and it was so comfy! If it was 3 inches longer it'd be 5 stars for sure!
3.0,"Description said Mens/boys ties. Should have removed the ""Mens"" part. These ties were at least 6"" shorter than my regular ties. I have to say that returning them for a full refund was easy."
3.0,It’s a cute necklace but I wish the letter is a little bit bigger. My sister loves it though
3.0,The waist band stretches fairly far but I wouldn’t say these pants are good for people with thick thighs. It’s very restricting in the back. The legs don’t stretch much either. The material isn’t too comfortable.
3.0,I normally order a medium but I wanted this to fit a bit snug so I ordered a small. The small was insanely large. I thought maybe I was just sent the wrong size on accident but the tag had an S. Definitely size down.
3.0,way too tight and snug - who are the models for their pants?  13 year old long-distance runners?
3.0,I like the color and size
3.0,"Thank god I ordered size 11 by mistake. I am 9.5 but sometimes I would go 1 size up depending on footwear. Fellas, i suggest if your feet are wide I would go 2 sizes up!  These sandals are NOT true to its size. The back of your heal should fall just about an inch or 1/2 an inch off the sandal. Hope this helps."
3.0,"comes off easily, we just stopped using it"
3.0,have to wear a tank top under cause it runs small
3.0,"The tunnels themselves feel and look good quality for the price but they did come in the wrong size so i couldn't try them on. Might have been user error on my part, the size selection was a bit confusing. Other than that they look nice!"
3.0,"The product is very nice, it fits well and the material seems to be of good quality, however, the colour I ordered was not the colour that was shipped to me. I ordered a red and they sent me a very bright orange instead which did not look too bad against my complexion so there wasn't any need to return the item to the seller, but still I gave them three stars for getting my order wrong.<br /><br />Also the padding at the bust is awkwardly shaped which made me feel a bit uncomfortable when i first put it on but overall, there are more positives to this product than negatives."
3.0,"For the price compared to other bags out there, this one leaves you a bit disappointed."
3.0,Cheaper looking and larger/longer than the picture. Too costume-y for me.
3.0,Overall a good product. Usually wear a medium but got a 2x so it would fit better because it runs small. You definitely need to go 2 sizes up. Warm inside but sleeves don’t go all the was to wrist. About a 1/2 to 1 inch of skin available.
3.0,Very cheap chain
3.0,Way too big. Washed it thinking it would shrink. It did not and the black faded.
3.0,"This watch is very pretty, however, it's too large for the average womens wrist."
3.0,It fits somewhat big. Cute and I still like it
3.0,little fragil... got broken very soon
3.0,I got an XL and the top portion is a bit tight. I should know that anything made in China even though it says XL is not a US XL.
3.0,"Good for about three wearings before you will get a run. Maybe a few more if you are careful. They are long, and come up to the top of my thigh, which is good and they stay up all day."
3.0,It is okay. Runs a bit small and the material isn’t that great but what do you expect for the price?
3.0,I’ve had this robe or swim cover for about several months now.  From the first few times I washed it I noticed threads started to come out.  The fabric also seems to be getting more and more rough and hard with each time I do laundry using the washer and dryer. Definitely not a high quality material. It is thick however.
3.0,"They are big and oversized. For the price, they are a great price.  I'm only giving three stars because they scratched themselves.  I keep these in their protective fabric cinch sack and when I took them out for the first time, the end of the stems had scratched the inside of the lenses. I consider that a design flaw. When folded up the stems should not make contact with the insides of the lenses. In this case they do.. and the vibrations of being in a pouch on a motorcycle were enough to scratch."
3.0,Waaaaaay to small
3.0,"I really like the color and style of this dress. Really cute, but runs a little small and the material is pretty see through. Will probably need to wear a slip underneath"
3.0,Not comfortable material
3.0,This is so cute but chlorine made the tassles turn black on the edges. So it's not that rcrisp yelliw we started with. The bottms are a little riske if not on a thin build. Great beach suit.
3.0,"I bought these to give away at camp.  They arrived very quickly.<br />The ones I received were loose in a plastic bag.  6 out of the 40 did not work.<br />They have white plastic-like rubber bands to attach them to fingers, and the band partly covers the on/off switch.  Some of the switches are very hard to slide, some are rather loose.<br />Overall I am fine with this purchase.  I they were inexpensive, I was expecting some of them to not work and I wasn't expecting great quality control.  I feel the product met my expectations for the price I paid."
3.0,"Okay pros: warm, soft.<br />Cons: pockets are useless (too small hand pockets and cargo pockets don't stay closed), MUCH lighter grey than pictured, kinda straight leg design leaves little wiggle room (definitely designed by women), not nearly as baggy as pictured.<br /><br />All in all, little pricey for what I received as opposed to what I thought I was purchasing. Meh."
3.0,"Runs quite a bit smaller than expected.  Ordered a 2XL and it fit more like a large.  The sweatshirt itself is nice.  It’s comfortable, looks good and washes okay.  Just order a size or two up."
3.0,Cute skirt but there is zero give in the fabric
3.0,"Great fit other than it could have some wiggle room in the length, I am constantly pulling it up."
3.0,Really much smaller than I expected.  Barely enough to hold keys and a bottle of water.
3.0,Item was as beautiful as described and shown in picture unfortunately even though fit on bottom it was very tight in the chest area. I would recommend maybe ordering a size bigger if possible
3.0,"At first, it is a great scarf. After a while, it gets clumped and does not have that 'spread out' or thick look that I like.. Stays in good condition but I wish it wouldn't get so clumped all the time."
3.0,Makes a great nightgown but I would NEVER wear this as a dress. The material is WAY too thin. Comfy for a maternity nightgown though (which is how I'm using it.)
3.0,Shoes are supportive but they were too big even with the inserts.
3.0,The frames don’t fit my nose well and the lenses are MUCH MORE YELLOW in the picture than they are in real life.  Disappointed
3.0,"Nice, but did not love the fit. Returned for a different dress."
3.0,"A potentially excellent product, but ruined by a battery which seems to run ion a different schedule than that required by the watch.  Cbharging is unreliable and a charge is held for hours at best and recharging is often unreliable. Had I been aware of this issue there would have been no purchase"
3.0,"personally had trouble adjusting,  I went back to using reading glasses.  May be great for someone else"
3.0,Cute. As expected for the price.
3.0,"Okay sports bra. Not a lot of support, so only would be good for light work, not running. Straps are also not very comfortable, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"I purchase this skirt in large and it fit, however I returned it. Because I decided to go with another outfit. Over all it is not a bad skirt just not my favorite of all the long skirts I have bought. The material was ok, and I wasn't fond of the skirt in the front.. for reference my waist is about 38(With my body shaper on it drops 2 to 3 inches) and I usually wear medium or large in skirts depending on the manufacturer.<br />I didn't really give the skirt a chance because I had decided to go with something else before it was delivered. So by no means let my opinion change your view about giving it a chance."
3.0,"Magnet is outstanding, I bought 2, looks great but glass stones fell out of one."
3.0,Doesn't look as good in person. The eye designs is a piece of paper with black sharpie to draw out the design. The mood ring part of it is dimmed under the cheap eye design. Good deal for the price I guess.
3.0,very cute but the metal part that goes through your ear fell off within the first month i had them
3.0,"I love looking through these (the polarization is great) but they are huge.  They're some of the biggest sunglasses I've ever seen.  If you have a small face at all, I would not recommend them."
3.0,Was gonna return these because they were too small for me! But I gave them to the wife and she loves them!
3.0,the frame easily bends after a few uses.
3.0,"The &#34;peek hole&#34; was way to big for my liking, im a 38 DDD and all of my glory would have been out!"
3.0,"Smaller than expected,  more for years than anything"
3.0,"They are really cute on. The fit works for me. However, they are NOT waterproof. I stuck my knee under the bathroom faucet to test it out, nope! Leg was soaked. I will be keeping them for other purpose, but not using them on the Inca Trail in Peru."
3.0,"Bought this in black for my brother.  It is stylish and lightweight.  The vest and pants fit well.  Actual jacket is somewhat tighter than expected, around chest and arms, for a muscular guy.  For under $80, it's a decent suit for attending meetings, weddings or dinner parties.  It's a good choice for someone's first suit."
3.0,"These actually irritate my ears quite a bit, which is odd because I never had problems with earrings. Also, the metal bent and it makes it really hard to put them on."
3.0,"Beautiful bright blue necklace, but it was not 16.5 inches, it didn’t fit around my neck (which is ~15 in)"
3.0,"I have to take this to my seamstress to have it taken in, however love the look, and feel. pants fit perfect just way tooooo long. This is a keeper though! :-)"
3.0,"My son liked the watch, and the feature of multiple alarms was great. However, it quit working after few month, from being splashed with water. It says water proof, but it's not. We contacted the company, and they said they will send us another one, but it's been 2 months now and we didn't receive anything. We can't even look up the order since it's past 6 months since we bought it. Overall, I liked the watch, but I think it's overpriced for the quality."
3.0,It’s very pretty but it’s hard to keep “closed” it randomly falls off.
3.0,"Cute necklace but not very good quality. It looks as pictured, but seems fragile. It's as expected for the price."
3.0,"I'm 5'5, weigh 178, bra size 38D. I ordered a large and it fit perfectly but the bottoms are so weird they have super stretchy scunchy elastic around the waist and leg holes so when you put them on over your stomach they squeeze and bulde all those areas. I had to use shorts instead of the bottoms."
3.0,Beautiful dress! Weak stitching. Tried it on and it literally fell apart at the seams. I have a sewing machine but I’d otherwise be returning it
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but completely see-through!"
3.0,The material of this dress is nice and the small fit great. However one of the straps was not sewn on in the correct spot and after one wash the pocket threading came apart. If you can sew these are easy fixes.
3.0,it was cute while it lasted. but it broke within a few weeks
3.0,"When I fit all my cards into the slots- They get stuck! I can't remove my ID (that I put in the clear pocket) when I have other cards in the respective slots. Other than that, I like the overall minimalistic design and color."
3.0,Watch is very large. Nice watch as pictured however.
3.0,"These are incredibly small, doesn’t fit my 8 year old at all.. however, these fit my 6 year old twins perfect. They said it’s comfortable and easy to breath with it on. This is a great product, but the size was not accurate at all."
3.0,Beautiful top and the sleeves are adorable.  Better than pictured.  I ordered a larger size and it was still to tight.  I wear a large.  I sized up to a X-Large and the top was still too tight.  I was saving the top for the right occasion.  Unfortunately it did not fit.  All of the tops I have ordered through Amazon has fit perfectly.  This top is sized incorrectly.
3.0,After a few washes the lace tears.
3.0,The material quality is poor
3.0,"Material is fine, can use a steamer for any wrinkles, pretty design but the threading on the back I'd have to work on to be wearable.."
3.0,Elastic isn't covered so it feels kind of scratchy inside. Cheaply made.
3.0,Too small. I ordered an extra large and gave it to my daughter who wears a size zero. She used a belt and it looked fine on her.
3.0,My daugther has 5 years old but is too large to her.<br />It is a shame because she was so excited...
3.0,"Cute , but ...cut is too deep. I have to return.."
3.0,It’s ok. It’s a little heavy so if your wanting to wear it as a bracelet it’s he’s. Not much to say other than it’s ok.
3.0,it plunges too much..have to fix it from sleazy
3.0,"Fits well but it’s a strange material.  Also difficult to go to the bathroom bc it’s a halter and has a belt, lots of untying to do!"
3.0,"I ordered the size I thought would fit based on the size chart and on other answers and reviews but fory height 5'8"" it was a too short for the style of dress and I was barefoot, so it already looked strange, with heels it was for sure going to look even shorter. I'm typically a medium but busy size was pretty snug and a bit tough to zip up. It's a beautiful dress just not accurate in size."
3.0,"The fabric is a rough, scratchy polyester."
3.0,Great bra but super sticky.
3.0,"Very good quality, soft, cute color but my baby started to have reddness and a little bit of scratches in the back."
3.0,Wide but comfortable
3.0,"Love the fit and color.  Unfortunately, mine came without the belt. I forgot to return it within the 30 days.  It wrinkles easily and is a little see-through.  But I’ve received compliments every time I wear this dress."
3.0,"I bought these pants because they looked a lot like Prana's Brion Pant but at around half the price. I'm a little disappointed in the way they look after I tried them on. My wife came home and they they were new sweatpants, which she is right about. These resemble sweatpants more than Brion pants 😞"
3.0,The shoes runs big- I had a hard time keeping them on my feet!<br />The style is cute tho
3.0,It fits perfectly but the material is not as expected
3.0,"These earrings arrived broken, very disappointing, but becuase I'm crafty, I was able to convert them, they're smaller than I thought, but really cute and lightweight, so I won't  complain."
3.0,"This was advertised as a purple heart pendant, yet it is more blue than purple. It's pretty, but I am a purple fan so disappointing to me. It is pretty and a nice additions to my jewelry collection."
3.0,"Because these are so wide I found it extremely uncomfortable to wear. It prevented me from performing the simplest task: blowung my nose. The item, because of its width, would constantly be touching my nostrils.<br /><br />Would not recommend or buy again"
3.0,Very far away from my expectation.why do you guys like using poor material. Mostly product coming from china.i don't like things that come from china coz end up put putting it in trash
3.0,Looked really cute on my daughter but the straps broke after one wash. I can see them back but still annoying
3.0,adorable.. but another &#34;see through&#34; pair of shorts
3.0,It hurt to remove from your nipple area
3.0,"I ordered a large and an XL.  The large was a bit snug in the arms but the chest area was very big.  The XL was way to big.  The bust on the XL was more like XXXL.  The quality of the material seemed great, I was just really disappointed that the size was not even close to true."
3.0,"I love how comfy these are. Pretty & slim fitting for pjs. But I’ve had them only a couple of months and they’re wearing very quickly... starting to become seethrough in the pants. Maybe not surprised as it’s a lightweight fabric.<br /><br />For sizing help: wear a 28 jean, 34c, and medium top and 6 dress, usually, and I ordered a Medium. Fits well."
3.0,"The shirts quality is great, however it is very big for the size they say they are meant to be. I sent a M back that was said to be a 10/12 and got the small that is said to be a 7/8 and both are still huge on my not tiny 10 year old. I would not buy unless your little one is okay with wearing the shirt big on them."
3.0,"The detail of it is great, just what I was looking for. However, the shape of it didn't fit my wrist. It was not as oval as I needed it to be."
3.0,"Pleasantly surprised for $3 at the look, but of course the material is thin."
3.0,The picture and the product that arrived were not the same but the skirt is still cute.
3.0,"Nice but HUGE, I gave it to a friend. Unless you want to swim in a big vest, order at least two sizes down."
3.0,I like the material and quality of the product. My and my wife both tried it and not sure how it would reduce waist size. It's comfortable and would help you in setting you up with good back posture.<br />I was given this product to provide honest feedback.
3.0,I'm 5'7 and it barely covered my bathing suit. I ended up buying a skirt to complement the shortcoming of this product.
3.0,"Son ordered, he wears a men's small and we ordered a M. Tag shows 3XL, tight across his back but long in the arms. Otherwise he likes the coat."
3.0,"The shoe is very expensive for rather cheap materials. They are comfortable, very lightweight and a nice professional look. I have a very high arch and the top band starts to irritate (leave imprint) after a few hours. I don't do uncomfortable, so I bring a pair of flats along to slip into. For the price, I would not buy again."
3.0,"Did not fit over my glasses.  My daughter, however, really likes them."
3.0,Great quality but we bought the size 5 for my 16m old and they came up to his knees making it hard for him to walk. I’ll definitely turn to these over Bogs when he’s bigger but they just don’t work for his short little legs for now.
3.0,Works well for keeping dust out for my allergies
3.0,For the cost not worth it. I still have to use a second mask underneath.
3.0,"I ordered these men shirts for me, definitely shld HV ordered smaller size, shirts were too large for me. Also, didn't like silky polyester texture.  Was hoping for cotton. I shld HV read description thoroughly so overall probably my mistake but they were inexpensive so no biggie. Gonna wash and put in dryer to shrink"
3.0,Great design but as a size 11.5-12 foot these are basically straight jackets for my feet and calves. Should probably be size 7-10. Will not buy again.
3.0,"fit way too small. jacket is cute, but i usually wear a large and it fit me way to small."
3.0,Super cute top! It runs very large though...get one size down from the size chart recommendation
3.0,I liked the dress but it definitely doesn't look exactly like the picture. Less pleating and doesn't seem to hang the same. Wore to a casual wedding.
3.0,BROKE WITHIN THE FIRST 2 WEEKS OF WEARING THEM.
3.0,"Very pretty, a bit on the small side, but cute"
3.0,"No es tan lindo, pero queda bien. Es un traje sencillo. Lo pedí por básico en mi closet. La tela es gruesa. Tampoco estoy desepcionada."
3.0,"I have hips and a small waist you have to go up a size if you have booty and hips, I had to take it to a tailor to cut it it was tooo long."
3.0,"when the item arrived I was taken away by how beautiful it was. after 2 or 3 days of wearing it, the finish wore off and the ugly copper color base metal started showing. The finish on it is horrible and it is NOT sterling silver."
3.0,"The dress looks great in the picture but was *meh in person.  Cheap fabric that doesn't hang right.  The color was more red than burgandy too.  It did fit as expected, actually running on the larger size."
3.0,"The gold ring looks very fake. If I was ever to by this again, I would buy all silver.."
3.0,The sleeves are a little short and the material is itchy one the inside. 5’9 130lbs ordered a med.
3.0,"I thought they were gonna be PRO CLUB sweatpants but it dosent say pro club on it, so if ur looking for the ones that say pro club don’t get these, but they are somewhat smiler to pro club sweatpants. If you want them to be a little baggy go up a size I got a size medium"
3.0,"I like the dress, it’s stretchy fits perfectly but the flowy part kinda makes it feel like I’m pregnant from sideways. Other than that I love it!"
3.0,Red lens is more pink than red. The others colors are cool
3.0,They’re cute but they fall out constantly
3.0,"Very pretty,  arrived a week before expected.  Bracelet is extremely small, had to bend it to put it on. I have smaller wrists, I was surprised that it didn't fit. I'll probably give it to my friends granddaughter."
3.0,"My favorite is the one at the top left.  I wear it all the time.  The rest seem quite cheap.  The plastic bead on the one at the bottom is really shiny, and the chain on the one in the middle one popped the first time I put it on.  The one on the far right is okay, but I have one similar that is much nicer. Essentially you get what you pay for"
3.0,Everything was better than expected...
3.0,I mean for what they are they worked but they were super big...
3.0,"Really like the top - great pattern and color. Bottoms, though a bit baggy, are cut very high. Too”cheeky” for my comfort."
3.0,"Overall it's a nice vest. However, the buttons are not attached well and one fell off the first time I tried it on.  The fit feels a bit large in the arm holes, but fits well in the waist.  Other than that though it is as expected.  Nice fabric and style."
3.0,"I purchased these after I saw someone I knew wearing them and fell absolutely head over heals in love with them.<br />Upon recieving them, which in honesty I was a little nervous about from seeing the reviews about getting them scratched, I was relieved to find no scratches.<br />I have a fairly wide head and tend to get headaches from glasses that are slightly snug-- so I was even more relieved to find that these had springs in them for a better fit.<br />My only complaint would be is that they sadly scratch easily. I have noticed a few scratches on my poor lenses recently. I don't wear these very often and I have a specific storage place safe for keeping so this came as a heartbreaking surprise to me.<br />Seeing how the glasses have very tall lenses I've noticed that they pick up facial oil *very* easily as well. When I'm out I have to take them off a *lot* to clean them because the smudges bother me so much.<br />The nose bits came only slightly bent but I've noticed they bend very easily.<br />My best advice is to be careful with them. If you can find one- store them in a case when you're not using them if you don't want them to be scratched up. Keep your facial oil in check while you're out-- clean and clear have facial strips for this. I'd advise bringing some out with you if you're going to be out a good while with them on."
3.0,"Not pleased at all! Color definitely off on the red AND purple dresses. No stretchy fit like another dress I purchased, just a cottony sack. Returned."
3.0,"One of the crystals fell out &the battery stopped working... Love the watch but, what made the watch not so good...."
3.0,lens showed up in a envelope wrapped in a glasses cloth.  lens are not the same darkness as Oakley brand lens.  The Blue color is the darkest.  The other colors in my opinion are almost clear in darkness.  They are polarized giving everything that oil slick gleam.  The material of the lens is cheaper and more flexible then Oakley brand.  This made it difficult to install the lens in correctly and quickly.  the lens is bigger than the XLJ size.
3.0,Not super soft or absorbent...maybe with a few more washes.
3.0,Everything below the waistband of the dress is great & fits true to size. Above it is another story. Top is way too large under the arms. So much excess fabric in these areas that it makes the top of the dress look baggy and so poor fitting. Such a shame as the print is very cute & it would be a great summer dress. Will be returning.
3.0,Its a nice cardigan.  Order down one or 2 sizes.  Mine was WAY too big.
3.0,Perfect fit but needs back coverage too
3.0,"I received these charms as a gift for Christmas, and there is a pretty good mix of various animals. I got about several different styles of ladybugs and they make up probably 40-45 charms of the lot. That's ok, though I really would have preferred more of the other styles. There are only 4 or 5 each of the other animals. I was really excited to see some adorable little zebras, but immediately disappointed to discover that all 5 zebras in the pack were broken in multiple places. I guess those charms aren't durable enough to be shipped, at least not without additional protective packaging.<br /><br />Would have given 5 stars if 5% of the charms weren't broken, there weren't so many ladybugs, and if the pack was cheaper. $18 is ridiculously expensive for 100 charms, especially when they break so easily and they are all pretty tiny. :("
3.0,"I like the idea of this, especially for cold or wearing while riding but it's tu small, one size does not fit all, for the record I wear a size LG/XL in non snap back hats and this didn't fit me. Hopefully they adjust the sizes in the future."
3.0,"The jumper was cute -- however just like the other post, I think that the size is for juniors and they are long capri length. They came up about right above the ankle. I wear a (6) women and ordered the xl. It was just right."
3.0,Very well made shirt but definitely runs small...very small.  Was very disappointed being that this was a Christmas gift I gave to someone.
3.0,"I am a huge Allegra K fan! I have oodles of pieces from this collection. I took a risk on this piece based on my overwhelmingly positive prior experiences. Every ships very quickly and is always constructed of good quality materials, that hold their shape, color and integrity.<br />However, with *this specific* peice I am a bit disappointed. The colors are true, the materials is great (not see through), and the construction on the shirt is great except for the cut. I hace a petite structure with a very endowed chest so I knew this might be an issue. And fully intended to just have the shirt tailored a bit to get a custom fit. What I didn't expect was the enormous arm hole and overly extended shoulder area. This combination creates. Situation where the shirt sits oddly across your back, think almost of a cowl but on your back and with a collared shirt. And when you extend your arms straight out or lift them up the shirt lifts well above your belly button.<br />It's a bummer!<br />However, with all that said, I still really love the fabric and color so I am going to take it to my seamstress and see what magic she can work on it. I will either have it tailored so I can wear as it is meant to be worn (long sleeved button down, ideally) or I will ask her to convert it into a sleeveless button down for warmer weather.<br />I will update my review after its been tailored, I am still holding out hope.<br />I hope my review doesn't deter anyone away from the brand and collections because I do love all of my other peices- from dresses to sweaters to pullovers and short-sleeved tops I wear at least one an Allegra K peice basically weekly."
3.0,These are a rough fabric. The size is accurate and they look cute. The velcro feels cheap.
3.0,not as good as it looks in the picture !!!!!!!
3.0,It has no pockets.
3.0,Leather in the large purse  was so stiff I couldn't even work with it. The handles were very square metal and was not comfortable in my hand. The small purse the liner started to tear out immediately. The leather strap tore within 3 months if having it.
3.0,It was cute but unfortunately too small.
3.0,"It fits more like a shirt. If your in a American large or extra large and your looking for it to fit like the picture, ive got bad news for you.... It won't. I like the fabric, and Even though it doesn't fit how I would like I kinda like the it."
3.0,Gets wrinkled very easily.
3.0,Was disappointed - not what I thought it’d be.  It was a gift for my daughter - I’ve not seen her wear it - so not certain she<br />Liked it.
3.0,This flip flop is good and fits exactly. 3 star because Its over priced. I bought this for my wife.  It looks good  I bought Addidas brand for myself at half price.  That also is as good.
3.0,"This was another item I purchased for my Jubilee from X-men cosplay that I wore to Comic Con. These black acrylic fingerless gloves were the sort of pseudo-Goth / semi-punk accessory I used to drool over at my local Hot Topic back in college, back when I had lots of fashion dreams but zero dollars. When I decided to dress as Jubilee for my annual nerd pilgrimage (aka Comic Con), I realized that I could only hope to accomplish her effortlessly awesome persona if I could also secure a pair of fingerless gloves. In black, of course. This product was the perfect fit: simple, plain fabric, comfortable, stretchy, good length, retain full mobility/flexibility in both hands, and best of all...SUPER affordable. Thanks, Prime! I never get tired of that good-old two-day FREE shipping. 12/10 would definitely purchase these again, perhaps in a different color/fabric/design/pattern. Then again, you can never go wrong with plain, solid black gloves. I do indeed look really good in black; though, I already knew that before buying these gloves, but wearing them just confirmed that scientifically-proven fact. Very satisfied."
3.0,"This set is cute, but it is very cheaply made and I don't know how long it will last with a 4 year old.  I'm sure I could have bought this at the discount store for under $5. I paid $12. I would not do it again, so I do not recommended."
3.0,"Needed a back-up for my dress shoes when driving to save the heels (of dress shoes) and these are just right.  Wear them not just for driving, but also out and about on errands as well.  Good for jeans-wear."
3.0,Cute shirt but doesn't look like this on. You have to wear something under it and that makes it look different.
3.0,The hinges still have small burrs on them so they're not all that comfortable also a little small for a septum. I dont have a large septum and my piercing is pretty low. Perfect for a septum you dont want to be seen. May work on my nostril piercing. I hope it does
3.0,"They are really cute earrings and they were packaged very well.  It takes them awhile to ship which the seller explains in the estimated time to ship when I ordered so it wasn't unexpected.  Just takes awhile.  The earrings themselves are not terrible, but the post doesn't go all the way into the earring back, so I do have a slight concern that if I wear them they may have the increased ability to fall off.  That's the reason for the three stars.  But other than that the earrings are okay."
3.0,Hides my belly tho
3.0,Disappointed:  Much smaller than appeared in the ad! Hoped that it would make a statement---It didn't! Workman ship fine-  size very small
3.0,"Not bad, very thin material, not much support, if you are looking for that."
3.0,I have no idea if these actually work for their intended purpose. I use them to warm colors on a computer monitor when programming. They look dorky and are cheaply made but they warm the colors and are readily available without looking like the Oakley versions of gaming glasses.
3.0,"I kept them because I thought maybe I would change my mind but they are a little tighter then I like , I wouldn’t buy them again"
3.0,"Ordered for a friend whose mother had passed away.  Pendant came with bottom character not centered with the rest, and with antiquing not even throughout the pendant. I did reach out, and the seller made a new one to correct the centering issue, and I asked for the new one to not have the antiquing. It was better, but still not perfect. Rather than return it again, I chose to keep it, but I still think it could have been better. I personally have a Cartouche pendant, and it is by far better quality that this one. The new pendant has marks on the back, and the first character appears to have had too much heat applied to it. For those who have asked in the comments, you need to send a note with the word/name you wish to have spelled."
3.0,"Unfortunately I'm afraid these folks are in a product category that no matter how hard you try you can't please everyone, and I'm afraid I'm the one they can't please this time.<br /><br />The pin itself is fine, although the fine details are a little foggier than I'd prefer.<br /><br />My problem though is that the pin on this is very long - so long that the pin itself spins freely on clothes, and I'm ending up all the time with the flag turned sideways or upside-down.  I know that's because they probably envision these mostly going on suit jacket collars, but even on those I'm finding it's so long I have to push it though both the collar and the coat, and pin it inside the coat.<br /><br />Obviously you could cut a bit off the pin, but then the end wouldn't be sharp, and you wouldn't be able to push it through clothes anymore.  And I don't know of a way that most people could sharpen one of these again after they'd cut off some of the pin.<br /><br />Also there's no &#34;retaining pin&#34; - a lot of these will have a small pin on the back of the item itself, so that once it's flush up against your clothes it can't spin.  This one doesn't have that."
3.0,takes a little effort to make the lights come on but once they do its fun
3.0,"Runs Small, but overall good quality"
3.0,Not the jeans i thought they were<br /> Decent fits a bit larger than the pair i thought i was getting and gave alot of stretch to them. Has a double belt loop?
3.0,"I had bought this same watch band in March and I was surprised when it came and it was &#34;PV&#34; leather, I guess there is a piece of Genuine leather under the outer PV leather layer. It only lasted 3 months, Since it was such a good fit (until the day it just split apart in multiple places) worked great. I did order a second one because it is fairly inexpensive, looks like leather and fits my  wrist well. I have a leather band that came with the Samsung Gear 3 but it gets an odor from sweating or any moisture since the leather on the inside is not sealed. It is an activity tracker so sweat and moisture happen! This band can be wiped off and does not get an odor. Wish it lasted longer!!!"
3.0,Can't wear it. I'm allergic to the metal....
3.0,"I purchased the double tour watch band in the dark blue/navy color. The item arrived quickly. The band is a bit on the stiff side, will definitely have to break in. The band is claimed to be made of leather, hmmm. It's really just a reasonably good &#34;faux&#34; leather.  Also the band has a funny odor to it. The color is as described. Easy install. Overall, it's a decent replacement for the money."
3.0,I didn’t like that the color of the leggings is much lighter in person.  The picture is a little misleading.
3.0,awkward fit on the body
3.0,"We used them for over a year with no problem, but on our last trip both the handle on the side and on the top broke. The plastic connector between the handle strap and the case snapped. Other than that we liked them."
3.0,"This coat is OK.<br />The collar looks a little wider on the model than it really is.<br />See my photo - in reality it looks like tiny little stripes around the neck.<br /><br />Also the wool already had a lot of fuzz in it and would not definitely look nice and turn into a lot of little &#34;fur balls&#34; after a short time wearing it.<br />The color is just as pictured on the photo.<br />Quality is not great but acceptable for the price.<br /><br />I am 5’5”, currently 140# (63.4kg), 38.2 (98cm) - 32(82cm) - 39(100cm)/ 36DD<br />I feel that this coat has junior sizing, although is says it is US size 4-6, it fit me small and the sizing feels more like US XS or 0-2.<br /><br />Returned"
3.0,This is my 3rd pair I ordered bc they break very easily at the part where you close them. They are big but very light weight  and they look very cute.
3.0,Only bad feature is the inefficient autowind deal.  Does not work consistently at all .... and I've had other brand withwind that were flawless!!
3.0,I didn’t recibe with my order the tool and the springs.
3.0,This would be a beautiful dress if it was lined. It is see-through and fabric is very flimsy. Design fits beautifully though… I guess I can’t complain for the price!
3.0,I don't know what to say except I stiu have to clean up after my husband is shaving.
3.0,"With all of the skin diseases, I just don't feel safe wearing a tank top at the gym. So to feel safer and protect myself against exposure of rash and disease when wearing a tank top, I wear a t-shirt underneath. Otherwise, I like the fact that the tank tops are thin and easy to wash. I'm curious to see if it shrinks:) Also, I ran this morning with the tank top and it was perfect!"
3.0,"This is a functional jeweler's loupe, but not a 30X one (I'd guess around 5x, but that's suitable for my needs).<br />The case it came in is just small enough that the hinge from the loupe scratches the case every time you open or close it.  This happened on both of my loupes.<br />The two loupes were placed in a small zip-top back and then placed in a large box without any padding.  The cases did an alright job of cushioning them, but it's still poor shipping practice."
3.0,Bought these for my husband.  Hes on his feet alot has poor circulation so his feet get cold. HOWEVER  there was a hole in each pair
3.0,They are what is pictured
3.0,This dress fit great and the fabric is very soft.<br />I bought the white and you can definitely see through to the underwear. Its unlined so care has to taken to use the right undergarments.
3.0,Runs very very small.Very disappointed
3.0,Nice boot but very very narrow.  Not good for my daughter who is a xw in sneakers.
3.0,"Oh what to say about this dress.....well, it is so pretty.  The detail work is a nice little touch.  I wore this dress 1 time and the public received a nice view of my backside every time I walked.  I am bigger on the bottom, but this dress fit perfectly! It is very flattering-disguised the &#34;problem&#34; areas. Here's the problem, every time I took a step, the inner layer crept up a little more each step. I was constantly fixing it, pulling it down, readjusting and so forth.  The inner layer is more of a felted type material; the overlay is a chiffon type which is see-through.  I don't know if it is a mixture of the two types of material that make it do this, but it did. If I were to wear it again, I would definitely have to wear it with leggings or something. I often think that if I went a size or so bigger it would still do this."
3.0,Love the fit but the zipper broke right away! Thank goodness my mom is a seamstress
3.0,"I’m a little bit sad due to the fact that I ordered a 2X and it’s a little small. I’m not that big but considering how it’s made, it’s pretty tight. A 3X would’ve been PERFECT but the sailor dresses unfortunately are not made in that size. Other than the fit, the dress is adorable. It does have quite a weird smell coming out of the bag however."
3.0,"Several of tbe plastic covers would not stay in place, but overall they are ok for the price."
3.0,"I’m so bummed! I ordered “blue,” expecting the chambray color from the photo. However, it looks like the shirts advertised as “light blue.” It is way too pale for my pale skin that is prone to rosacea in the summer.<br /><br />Fit note: I am 5’3” and 173 pounds, short-waisted with 34B bust. The Medium fit my shoulders and bust and waist, but it was tight in the hips. I expected this, though, so I marked fit as expected.<br /><br /> This shirt looks well-made. As I’m returning it, I never got to wash and wear it out."
3.0,"After one wash, the color faded way too much."
3.0,Thought it would compress more
3.0,It's a nice dress but the under layer was a stiff material.
3.0,"Very light weight fabric, not as expected."
3.0,"My kid LOVES this dress. The fabric is soft but a little cheap feeling. The ruffles flop a bit more than you’d want them to. I was also surprised at how long it was, I was expecting it to be shorter, especially since my daughter is very tall for her age. The red is a very vibrant shade. I am satisfied enough with it since my daughter has worn it so much, but you could find better quality for that price at Target or something."
3.0,Good quality product have used many times and sometimes just to go to the store and I always get a sweat
3.0,"Got my faux fur and I was super excited until I got it out of the pack and saw that the color is nothing like what is advertised, instead of the multi tones of brown it’s just one solid color of medium/dark brown. It reminds me of a teddy bear 😞 so I was disappointed with that aspect. The fit is as expected, and the overall style and fit of the coat is as pictured. I just really wish the color on the photo represented what I was actually going to receive. I most definitely would have ordered a different color if they showed what this brown ACTUALLY looked like. I am 5’2 170 36C and I ordered an XL and it closes comfortably without any buckling near the buttons. I included a picture to show the color of the coat for anyone thinking about purchasing the brown."
3.0,Did not like quality
3.0,"The buttons are not sewn where they should be, and look like they were placed at random"
3.0,"Lastimosamente no me es factible devolverlo así que intentaré ver si puedo reemplazar los zippers rotos lo que evidencia quizás baja calidad de los mismos, o que me lo enviaron así a sabiendas de que estaba defectuoso."
3.0,Wrinkles. Couldn't get through the dinner party without looking like I had rolled around on the floor.
3.0,The dress was very cute and fit nicely but the arm holes were a little too tight.
3.0,I like the style and shape but they are cheap and break easy .
3.0,"Great product, just way too long for my body. I am 5’3 & it went almost all the way down to my ankles. Otherwise great fit, & cute dress if I’d been taller"
3.0,VERY TRUE TO SIZE.. maybe can even size down. Supports WIDE FOOT people . They aren’t as fluffy as the pictures but I’m just wearing them as slippers in the house so they’ll do
3.0,I ordered the largest size available.  but the way the dress was made it was not a curvy girls friend.  It looks nice but didn't fit well.  This dress is more the woman that is structure like a teenage boy no boobs or butt.  and it would compliment her well
3.0,"These boots are a little tight, I ordered a half size large so I can wear warm socks.  I'm hoping to stretch them out enough to be comfortable.  And for those customers that think these are leather, you are mistaken.  I just hope they are waterproof, haven't had any rain yet.  Also very disappointed with the packaging, they were delivered in a bag."
3.0,"Now I'm only 5'3"" but with my curves this was hard to get into and even harder to get out of. Love the concept and to be honest it was super cute but I would need one size bigger which alas they do not offer. I literally had to resort to some contortionist maneuvers to get this thing off. Granted I have a bigger upper body and some thick shoulders/arms but wow did this run small. Note about the bottom: I would wear some nude safety shorts. Because the bottom is super flowy and since it is aiming for that skirt look, the leg holes are very big. So big that if a gust of wind blew by, you would be flashing people despite it being a romper. So something to note."
3.0,Quality ok. Knee pads don't stay on. Socks wash too big.
3.0,"Very thin material (not a major problem for s. Louisiana! but the length is too short. My son is 2 months old, i ordered 6mths and it is too small. :/"
3.0,"It runs large, I’m ordered a medium and it was way too big. It’s great for keeping the hair off, but it’s not super well made. I had it for about a month wearing it every day and it already got holes in the pockets. Now wearing it every day for 2 months and I can’t keep my scissors in the pockets or else they will fall through."
3.0,The umbrella held up the color has gone from green to grey looks awful
3.0,"Very comfortable socks, with a very odd design."
3.0,"This isn't a t-shirt, it is way more form fitting than I wanted and I ordered 2 size up :("
3.0,"I like these; they fit well and are very comfortable. That being said, my four-pack of &#34;colors&#34; included two grey, one black, and one navy blue pair. Not much color there, people."
3.0,"I bought the white and flower design in a size small. I like my leggings to be a little bit tight but these were tighter than a little bit tight. They were extremely uncomfortable, but they definitely do run slightly small. I am 5 foot three and 115 pounds and a small should have fit me. The main reason that I returned these leggings was because they were not super flattering the way they shape your your body and your natural curves. I am a pretty fit in shape person with a pretty good shape to my lower body because I work very hard at it at the gym. Most leggings are flattering on me. If these are not flattering on me, they likely will not be flattering on most people. The quality wasn’t terrible. The design in the photos look pretty. They are a unique pattern and design for sure. However, they were not very flattering on a body that they should have been flattering on the way that they designed them"
3.0,"Because of the chiffon type material I was nervous about purchasing my usual xl. I ordered an xxl and wish i hadn't. Because of the pleat in front (which is precious) and a couple of gathers in back yoke, it was just too large.  I would've have been fine with the xl... unfortunately I laundered before i realized and can't return."
3.0,For 19$ it's pretty nice. It's fairly soft and really cute...not made to be warm just decorative
3.0,Slides up your shoulders everytime you lift your arms but looks super cute if you dnt move around to much lol
3.0,"You'll notice a definite shift in the quality of the materials, going from the default silicon band to this. Get this only if getting extra air to your wrist is your priority, I felt the friction from the band didn't justify the change."
3.0,It’s a beautiful set but the bra is on layer of a lace fabric- it does not look like the picture with the cups having coverage and support! This is no support what so ever with this bra
3.0,Bought these and unfortunately the threaded end wouldn't fit through my luggage tags.
3.0,"Love this dress it fits well however the workmanship is not up to par.  The scalloped neckline isn't finished properly, thread hanging and sewn uneven at the collar and neckline. The way the dress is make you can't just cut away to make it even, cutting the garment may ruin the dress completely."
3.0,"I Love the size and design of the nose ring , however it turned my nose green after a week"
3.0,"Just ok. They fit fine. Go up higher in the top of foot than I like. Also, really thin. A little expensive for what you get, in my opinion.  Size 7/7.5 shoe."
3.0,"I have the full-grain leather Mountain 600 from Danner. They suggested this to me. It severely darkened the boots, much to my dismay."
3.0,Good costume but it runs small.. I’m a medium but I cannot zip the back up on the medium I bought
3.0,It’s a gorgeous ring but it’s not as thick (the width is okay) as normal rings. Would be really nice for younger girls.
3.0,"very warm, but the touchscreen feature is very limited to a specific spot on the tip of the figures. Its ok for the price, but will not order again"
3.0,"These are cute, but the quality isn't great"
3.0,The size of the heel wish they came in wide width
3.0,Loved these glasses yes past tense they didnt last long.  I guess I cant be upset because of the price
3.0,Will be sending back. Top fit fine but bottoms did not. Waist too high and not comfortable when sitting too snug. Workmanship was nice. Color nice. Fit not good for me. Next size up would be to large.
3.0,"Nice comfortable<br />Waist twists, needs better stitching there"
3.0,"it is not true to size for the curvy folks. however it is well made, love the material,"
3.0,A beautiful piece but it doesn’t quite go around the dime.  I’m taking it to the jeweler to see what can be done.
3.0,There are a lot of choices in white ankle-length socks which are more substantial and cost less.  What is it about the color gray that appears to demand a higher price?  Is gray dye really all that expensive?
3.0,"I thought it was a little snug compared to the “Buff” brand. The material was also a little heavier (thicker) and did not breath as well or give. The air pockets at the bottom were useless. Good for warmth, not for the heat"
3.0,Everything about the apron was nice except I would have liked to have been made out of heavier material.
3.0,"I thought this suit was super cute, but had to send it back because it was really small.  It is also way more red than the pic shows."
3.0,Excellent value.  Needs little efforts to fit but once fitted its a perfect fit. Don't expect high quality at this price but good enough for my Casio MDV 106.
3.0,"I like the pattern, it's a little poor fitting, and the material feels very processed, not natural."
3.0,"Runs very small. Very pretty, though."
3.0,"My 6yo wears size 6/6X, i bought 5-6X size. She tried them after wash & dry, the back seemed a bit short for her behind. She complained they ride-up & tugged at them the whole time she wore them. I bought them after reading reviews that other moms couldn't find comfy undies for their kiddo & who tugged at their undies & these fixed that problem. It didn't fix ours. Still on the search for the perfect undies."
3.0,It gathered in the mid section and it kept twisting where I had to keep realigning the zipper area.
3.0,"The clasp pin broke after a few weeks. I put the watch back on after showering and the clasp broke off. Other than that, it was comfortable while it lasted."
3.0,"Very thin, but it wasn't expensive."
3.0,"Love the charm itself, but noticed it came VERY tarnished, which has never happened before when ordering a new bracelet."
3.0,Have to return and try another because one of the jewels fell out but otherwise I love it!
3.0,These hoops are very large in diameter. I just bent them up a little so they didn't stick so far out of my nose and they look fine.
3.0,Very beautiful and stylish.<br />Although only have had for a couple of months and the lining inside purse is ripping.
3.0,The smell is wonderful but the package was missing about 1/3 of its ingredients!
3.0,"i'm 5'2"" 120lbs and it was snug in the torso area.  Not tight in circumference, not overweight tight but the outfit was not long/tall enough.  And i'm short/proportional.  It was difficult to bend forward, it pulled me back on the neck when I tried lean forward."
3.0,"Loved everything about it EXCEPT for the weird ruffle thing on the neckline! You can barely see it in the photos, but on it's so noticeable and looks like a mistake in person as it isn't symmetrical."
3.0,Foot wants to slide out due to a very low heel strap. Disappointing. Comfortable but not helping orthopedically. Stain very easily. Quality seems good.
3.0,The latch that connects the pendant to the necklace is so flimsy it actually came apart the first day I wore it and I had to repurchase the pendant because I lost it.
3.0,They are easier to put on if you place them just right. Still would be hard for someone with no good hand strength. They fit tight which is what I need but they feel comfortable. Compression socks are always expensive but these are cheaper than most. I would probably buy again. my legs feel comfortable and they help with foot pain. They seem to be cool not hot but I would have to wear them on a hot day to be more honest about that.
3.0,wish the charm was smaller and was more of a brushed silver look like the real alex and ani bracelets
3.0,Bag isn’t as spacious as I thought!
3.0,"This is definitely a low support sports bra. The material was too thin and stretchy. Definitely could not wear this for any high impact sports. It may have been slightly too large as well, but it was such a weird material I took it off and returned it without thinking too much about the fit."
3.0,Very happy and very like
3.0,Clearly a knockoff (which I knew) but the moon logo is crooked and noticeable.<br />It's a nice little bag other than that. The strap is a bit flimsy.
3.0,Chains are a lot larger than they seem in the picture. The cuff is slightly uncomfortable and it's a little heavy. I ordered this along with the cuff earing with the feathers and I loved the feather one enough t i order another. I was expecting this one to be more dainty.
3.0,It works well but I don't like the inside decider.  Inside decider doesn't stay fit so I took it out but outer is ok.
3.0,I ordered the XL & it’s okay but the neck doesn’t want to stay upright.<br />I will use as suggested.  A base layer for winter.
3.0,"It isn’t nearly as long as the picture leads in but it is still cute and comfortable. Also if you want it more loose, go up a size"
3.0,the clasp is uncomfortable on my wrist - especially when I wear it to work and it bangs my computer when I type
3.0,The cross is beautiful but not blue like the picture shows. It is more an aquamarine color (bluish tint) than a blue topaz.  That's why I only gave it three stars.  Otherwise it sparkles and is quite beautiful. I was only disappointed with the color.
3.0,"I know I got what I paid for,  although I surprised that it doesn't have a zipper pocket inside."
3.0,"The &#34;dress&#34; is okay. It is not what the model is wearing the.. split in front where the ties is, is much smaller and the skirt is much longer just not as flattering as what the model is wearing. I am thinking it will work as a cover-up on the beach over my swim suit."
3.0,"I have a very small frame, and even the smallest size was too big. I had to sew it to make it fit--which then made me realize I could have just bought some fabric and made it myself for $3."
3.0,"I like them, but they leave marks in my legs"
3.0,I read the reviews about the super wide cuffs and sleeves.... sooo true!!!  I don't even know what to do about them.  I do sew and thought maybe I could possibly do something if they were wide... and no.  I can't.  Really think about this sweater before you order.
3.0,"I love these earrings. They're easy to put on and look great--thick enough to be noticed but not bulky. They're a little heavier than the hoops that I would normally wear, but so far, that isn't bothering me.  We'll see how they feel after I keep them in continuously for a month or so.<br />Update: After wearing these earrings every day for ten weeks, I can say that they still feel great. They are, however, somewhat of a pain to remove because the inside edge of each hoop is a little sharp. When I pull them open, I tear up my nails and/or hurt my fingers."
3.0,"It says it's for women or men, but really these are women's or children's glasses.  They are very small."
3.0,"Very small for an eight year old. You'd have to be a very small for this to fit well. My DD sit insisted on wearing it but hasn't worn it since the first day. The fabric isn't very durable, so I don't expect that it will survive beyond a few washes."
3.0,I received the cat eye 2 pack with mirrored pink and black.  The mirrored pink are so fun.  The black were loose on my face.
3.0,"While it does seem to capture sweat, it stays wet for a very long time."
3.0,It was okay till after i washed it once then the material got all scrunched together and couldnt use
3.0,I purchased this for a Holiday Party.  Decided not to wear it because the material is so thin.  It did fit me well so I decided to keep it and wear it during the summer.
3.0,Shirt is fine except I got a youth shirt instead of adult.
3.0,"Ordered this along with with a similar BLUBOON bag to compare. Wanted something for traveling in England that is more accessible and less dorky than a backpack. I need something big enough for a camera, an iPad, a book or two, a rain jacket, and a small purse. This is a nice-looking bag, and the leather is a classy touch, but makes it heavy before it's packed. It seems well made, but I'm not a fan of snap pockets--they come undone too easily and are easy pickings if anyone is looking for pockets to pilfer. Last, the BLUBOON has a zip pocket on the back side, perfect for boarding passes, passports, and guide books. Also, the BLUBOON has zip side pockets deep enough for a water bottle. So going with the BLUBOON."
3.0,After wearing this off and on it isn’t very sparkly or shiny any more. Did the job for a couple months though!
3.0,I’m 42DDD and got the 3xl  I got these to go to the gym and play soft ball but I get the 4 boob thing going on. It bothers me but not to much because I’m trying to loose weight not walk a runway in these.  These are ok for the gym but I wouldn’t say they will be good more strenuous activity.
3.0,Meh. Same cheap grillz I could of got from a dollar store.
3.0,lo Ely dress. It fit well and is very attractive
3.0,"As far as compression goes, they are terrific.  But I probably won't buy them again.  They have this bizarre excess of fabric at the toes... as though people have weird, fan-shaped feet.  That is bothersome because they are uncomfortable  with shoes.  They will probably give me corns if I don't make sure they are adjusted just right in my shoes.  They are also on the thick side, so that is something else to consider.  Cute, but too many cons for a repeat purchase."
3.0,I bought two eyeglasses pin holder & one if them got rusted & do not know how to send it back.
3.0,Very cute but it is made for a little girl.
3.0,Didn't last very long before the crotch seem ripped.  Pockets aren't deep enough to hold my phone.
3.0,"A little cheaper-looking fabric, but still good to wear under jackets, cardigans, etc. Nice color."
3.0,Cheap but kind of pretty
3.0,Not heavy but slides off shirtbottom
3.0,a little too short
3.0,Ok!!
3.0,"THIS SKIRT WAS SO CUTE AND GREAT QUALITY AND LOOKED MORE EXPENSIVE THAN $20.00.  IT WAS WAY TO SMALL.  I SIZED UP FROM A SMALL TO MED BECAUSE OF REVIEWS.  LARGE WAS THE ONLY OTHER SIZE UP AND I DO NOT THINK THAT WOULD HAVE FIT.  BUT IT WAS A NICE SKIRT, WISH THE SIZING WAS BETTER."
3.0,I really liked this bracelet and wore it all the time. But I noticed it has lost its shine and sparkle and has tarnished. Very disappointed. I threw it away.
3.0,"This was my 3rd order of these over the past year or so.<br />the first 2 came individually wrapped but and these did not. Another difference is the top coating seams cheaper or non exiitant to addition the color dip to get the gunmetal color which is kinda sticky to the touch and worn in places not sure if this is entirely because they are not individually wrapped or they just started using a cheaper dip material to get the color, or just left of the finish coat.<br /> They do function as they should with a tension release trigger it's just the shine isn't quite the same as the other 2 orders were and maybe reducing the amount of packaging was intentional but them hitting around on each other loosing the coloring just in the package, what are they gonna do when they are on an everyday handbag or removable strap?"
3.0,There's something wrong with the back where it ties.  I hope my seamstress can fix it as it's a pretty dress.
3.0,These socks are cute but average quality.  I found some of them to be thin and sheer once you put them on and one pair split open at the toe before I even wore them.  I don't recommend wearing them on those extremely cold winter days because they're just not that warm.  But they're good if you need a thinner sock to wear under leggings or tall boots.
3.0,Jeans are too stretchy. They will fall off.
3.0,"In person, the color was much lighter, more like a Heather grey sweatshirt. I kept it because of the price was so low; it's a little thin to wear out of the house."
3.0,"I am a size 7 foot size, product says one size fits all. It fit decent. If you will intend to walk in your general terrain such as grassy area's it makes for a great accessory. I wanted to wear them on the beach and in the ocean but couldn't for the feeling of them trying to come off. I think the bigger size foot you have the less of a problem that will be.<br /><br />Still very worth the money and beautiful!"
3.0,"The Konikit Carbon Fiber Money Clip Wallet most probably does a find job of blocking the devices that the bad guys use to steal your credit card information right out of your back pocket. I don't doubt that for a minute - but how would we know it's working anyway? That's pretty much a matter of faith on the part of the consumer.<br /><br />But I do have a problem with the construction of this aluminum wallet: the weak point is definitely the black ""elastic bands"" on both sides that is designed to hold the wallet tightly closed. The bands do that right now, and they stretch nicely as more cards are inserted into the wallet. But how long are they going to do the job before the stretch out of shape or break- losing their ability to keep the wallet tightly closed (that's all that's keeping your cards in place)?<br /><br />And then there's the rigid clip outside the wallet by which it can be clipped to your belt - not something i want to do in a large crowd. If I'm worried about someone stealing my data with a reader, I'm more worried about someone stealing the whole wallet right off my belt and running away with the actual cards in hand. This is the kind of wallet that should be slipped into a man's side pocket because it's small enough to do that - but with that clip, that's not going to happen. (And, yes, I do realize this is intended to be a ""money clip,"" but it is still too uncomfortable to fit inside a pocket this way...I tried it.)<br /><br />Time will tell how long this holds up, so I'm giving it three stars (minus one star for the elastic and one for the uncomfortable/dangerous clip)."
3.0,Nice purse but alittle different than what I wanted. Good material & should hold up well.
3.0,this pair runs a little large
3.0,"Unfortunately,  when they flip up they wind up right in the filed of vision. The hinges are more on the side instead of on top. As a kid there were sunglasses for playing baseball- they were hinged on top and you could flip them up and completely out of the way. These are probably okay if you are reading something down at your waist or on a table below you,  but not for looking at anything above chest height."
3.0,"They are comfotable to wear except for the very tight top edge.<br />But theyare  III mpossibly difficult to put on and take off - which is the main reason for buying them!<br />I tried to follow the instructions which basically have you oulling the sock inside ou by the heel, then inserting your foot (very hard because of the dual compression) tand then oull up  the rest of the sock -which I could not do.<br />I tried putting on the socks the way I do with other compression socks, and nearly got a heart attack!<br />I returned them."
3.0,love it but it runs to smalls.
3.0,Large fit more like a small and strap runs way higher across the chest.
3.0,"runs a little small - clasp does not seem secure, has fallen off a few times, contacted seller and a compromise was reached."
3.0,"So the reason I’m putting 3 stars is because I thought this skirt was too large and too small at the same time. I’m about 5’5” and my measurements are 31-25-37. I was hoping the medium would account for my hips, but still be small enough for my waist. The skirts material was really nice, although the buttons were slightly too big for the holes. The waist was too big for me and the hips fit snug, but the skirt was so short that when I tilted my body forwards ever so slightly, my butt was showing and this is not an over exaggeration. I was going to order a small because then it would have fit my waist better but I think that would’ve been worse (as in there’d be no booty coverage at all). If you have a square/straight figure I would totally recommend this though, I think it’s meant for that shape much more than a curvy shape. I wish I could put 4 stars but I have to go with 3 because it just didn’t seem like the skirt was actually meant to be functional.. :/"
3.0,"Lense popped out and got lost, I really liked them for my medical job. Fit great, a little snug, but stretched out a little as I wore them. Very sad lost lense."
3.0,The color really doesn’t match the product. Please see picture  it looks more vibrant in the picture.
3.0,"I think that the wallet should have had some sort of material on both sides to protect cards, other than that it's an ok wallet... it just takes some getting used to."
3.0,Blue ones were fine black ones were broken
3.0,It fits tight and is too small for the sizing.
3.0,It wasn’t what I expected.  Flimsy material but I did keep and will use as a beach dress!
3.0,"They green your fingers after wearing them for a week. They're super cute, just turns your fingers green which blows"
3.0,these are very hard onmy soles
3.0,the watch works fine straight out of the box the leather strap doesn't seem weak but the face has the planets printed on crudely and at a lesser quality than shown for the product listing.
3.0,"The case is very pretty, closes well and the side with the slots to put credit cards is nice. The downside are the seams which are not good quality and it looks beat up being with little use."
3.0,"These glasses are so fun and they came very well packaged. However, despite all the plastic coverings and hard case the glasses still managed to arrive with a scratch on the lense. They also fit a bit off kilter- meaning I dont think they're straight. They're cute and cheap and not worth the hassle of returning. But if you're a stickler for perfection you may want to pass."
3.0,My daughter liked receiving them as a Christmas gift. They are a bit heavy and caused her ears to ache. And unless you look very closely it’s hard to tell what they are since the details are very superficial
3.0,Love the mighty wallets but I thought this one was plain notebook paper. It has french handwriting on it. It is still tough and awesome just would have preferred no writing.
3.0,Not good returned them
3.0,I normally wear a 1x in dresses and i ordered a 3x not made for a busty gal
3.0,"The fabric was nice and soft on my skin, but the fit was way too small. I ordered my usual cup size and could only latch the last hooks and was spilling out. I'm reordering a few sizes up and hoping that will fit better because I did think the quality was good."
3.0,My grand son usually wears a large men’s shirt this was an xl and it just fit him.
3.0,The color is not the same as shown. It's more pale yellow.
3.0,Watch has a very high-quality look & feel. Love the band screw in pins a plus. Overall very impressed. This is my third Pagani watch and won’t be the last. These watches do have issues out of the box with the bands and the movements. Without a return policy like the Amazon policy I wouldn’t purchase these watches.
3.0,"It did not fit, there is no ankle support."
3.0,Not the same gold in photo.
3.0,I followed everyone’s advice and ordered a size up- don’t do it!! I typically would wear a M/L in leotards so I ordered XL and it is gigantic on me! There is no way to even pin it or anything to make it work. I will probably exchange it for a medium. I’m 5’5” & 150. I like the way it looks and hopefully a smaller size will work.
3.0,Larger than anticipated.
3.0,Expected a bit better
3.0,"I was so excited to purchase this sweater after seeing reviews and I haven't been able to find new cable knits after some beloved older ones I had are now worn out.<br /><br />Loved it when I first put it on! I generally order a size medium, but based on other reviews opted for the large.  It still felt relatively fitted as it is supposed to be, but with enough room that the buttons didn't pull.  Was super cute on and great thick material! That said, even opting up with the size large so the buttons weren't pulling AT ALL, the bottom button fell off literally within hours of my very first time I wore it. I'm going to see I can re-thread it myself, but I was pretty disappointed and expecting better quality than stuff falling apart first wear.<br /><br />Hoping it's bad luck, as I already put another color of this same sweater in my cart I loved it so much and was planning on purchasing more PattyBoutik and this was kinda my trial run. Hoping it was a fluke. But debating if I should just find another brand instead."
3.0,I found these cumbersome to use and they don't really scrub off anything stuck on.
3.0,Not happy that for xlarge fit too small
3.0,I didn’t like them on me. They were just to big on me but the quality seemed fine specially for the price.
3.0,"Pretty dress . Ordered a med being a small , Thank God I did .<br />Lil big on the top but not long enough.<br />Not recommended for tall ladies ."
3.0,The skirt is almost 2 sizes too small and has very little stretch. The split up the middle is way to long too wear to work in an office setting. Good material.
3.0,runs little bit large
3.0,The ring is like described with the shape but the camo is way off. Nothing like the picture. My husband wanted camouflaged and this is not.
3.0,it is for kids. The light is not bright
3.0,wish i got a larger one
3.0,"I like the style, but the pearls are giant to my frame and a bit cheaply made. I like that it comes off as well, so it's almost a win."
3.0,"This dress is very pretty and lightweight. Perfect for an outdoor event. There was a lot of fray fabric and some of the wire one the sleeves and bottle of the dress were coming out. I am 5’8, 180 lbs for reference. I ordered a large and the waist fit smaller than expected but idk know my exact waist measurement.  The zipper is very weak and difficult to zip up and down alone. I would have returned if I didn’t need it for an event."
3.0,"The belt doesn't hold once adjusted.  I'm continually having to pull the belt tight.  I like the look and operation, didn't expect to have to adjust it constantly."
3.0,"Color was exactly what I wanted. Overall idea of the dress was what I wanted. Actually, it was shorter than expected and more bulky at the arms.  Even though I really wanted it to work, the fit wasn't right."
3.0,It's a little smaller than I expected.
3.0,Great looking hat. Over priced.
3.0,The lenses of these safety glasses could’ve been just a tad larger.  I don’t really like how much of the sides of the frame that I can see when I have them on
3.0,"Cute but not great function. Seams on shoulder extend be on the lace. Stretches out a bit in the busy (I’m a 36 C), no support, and no real lining. It’s truly just for looks, and it does look cute. Wish I knew where I could find it in a better quality"
3.0,"These were not very well made.  Flimsy, cheap, and they keep coming apart.  I guess I get what I paid for."
3.0,"I love the fabric of these pants and have these in grey that fit amazing. However, for some reason my pink ones I bought are much larger and baggy. I’m a little disappointed since they cost so much. Not sure why they are cut different than the other ones I have."
3.0,"This are not what I expected. More like scrubs. Not soft, very boxy shaped. Shorter than what I expected as well, and do not hold shape very well."
3.0,I loved the color but it’s not warm which I need and I needed it smaller.
3.0,Not as tortoise as I thought they would be
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:9343e18801b2db6198239217e128adc9]] I have a big head, and the reviews said this was a big hat.<br /><br />It's comfortable material but it just doesn't fit right. Like it should certainly down half an inch more. It also doesn't sit down on your head right."
3.0,Nice SHIRT not for me
3.0,Very beautiful but fit to large
3.0,"My necklace arrived with a bunch of dark scratches...but, for the price, it was a great addition to my Merida Disneybounding outfit!"
3.0,"I always fit into womens medium, but this is far too small."
3.0,"Looks great, fits great, however, the quality is not the best. After washing it one time the threads starting to pull out and unravel. Other than that, good!"
3.0,"It was like 4 sizes over. I'm going to return it and order a smaller size. Otherwise, I like the material and it seems to be of good quality. I will post a review after I receive and wear the smaller size"
3.0,"I really like the way these glasses look. I love the pretty blue polarization. They feel nice on and are light weight. For some reason one of the sides is  very stiff and doesn’t want to bend. I tried to loosen the screw on it but it does not help. This doesn’t make them unwearable but is a little aggravating trying to open and close them! Also one of the soft silicon pieces where they sit on your nose, fell off after about a week or so . Not sure where it went so I can’t try to fix it!"
3.0,2 of the balls did break/split on me after wearing a couple days. But I have so many for such a low price... I'm not too worried about it. So basically don't expect durability on every single one.
3.0,Be careful. Bends easily. But pretty.
3.0,"A little big for my 18 month old— good quality material but it’s like a yarn that wind and air can still get through. Won’t purchase again, but cute hat!"
3.0,"It works just fine, what I didn't like is basically the positioning of where the phone is. It feels very top heavy especially if you play for a good amount of time. I'm using an Elite 2 and Samsung Galaxy Note so I'm sure if you have a smaller phone and a lighter controller that helps."
3.0,Very nice but elastic stretched out after first use
3.0,"balloon toe a little too big, it bunches up a little"
3.0,"Great quality, runs small"
3.0,I like the shirt but wish it wasn't so see thru. Unfortunately I have to wear a tank under the tank.
3.0,"So So shirt. Definitely not wrinkle resistant, crazy wrinkles. Not super soft either. The shirt also constantly comes out when tucked into my pants, very annoying. I'm 6 ft."
3.0,"Cute dress. Bought in April for my summer trip and I just took the dress out of the package and noticed a stain right in the boob area when I tried it in.. so it can’t be unnoticeable. Unfortunately, it says I cannot return it now."
3.0,cute but runs very small .
3.0,These are only adjustable if you child is larger than the size you ordered. My son had always needed adjustable waist. I ordered these for Christmas photos and they were falling off of him. Definitly disappointed.3
3.0,I was hoping it would have a better fit it was a lot larger that expected
3.0,"Little tight in toe box especially, but they did loosen up a bit. I didn't care for material shoe strings were made with( they wouldn't stay tied) so I changed those."
3.0,Giving 4 stars because product came broken had to reorder.
3.0,These gloves were way to small for a adult woman with normal size hands and arms.  They can only be worn by a very thin woman.  A regular sized person is a no go.  I gave them 3 stars because for the price and quality they were good.  I was able to give them to someone and they used them with good out come.  Buyer be ware with the size.
3.0,"Fit and fabric as expected. Does appear to block some harmful UV, but that's about it. It did not appear to &#34;cool&#34; me (weather was approximately 94 F when I was last running). For runners who run for longer than 30 minutes in direct sunlight, this might be a good investment to make to help prevent sun damage."
3.0,I love the design however very small
3.0,"Just ok, colors are not as bright as pictures shoe. Pretty faded look. Hat just ok"
3.0,Pretty Bracelet design but too tight for my arm<br />I have an 8 inch wrist female and this bracelet too tight.<br />would be OK for someone with small wrist
3.0,"The green is more on the lime side for me, which is a no go. Love the slit in the front—it’s close to being cute, but a little too frumpy for me."
3.0,"I found this to run TIGHT!  I got my usual Size and it was pretty snug.  I do like the style and ordered a 2nd purchase one size up.  They are made to European Sizing which is based on Metric, unless your really a PERFECT MUSCLED UP SKINNY Person, I'd go up a size."
3.0,Shirt was small around the arm. Shorts were tighter than expected. It matched my shoes and fanny perfectly
3.0,After adding several cards the case really isn’t functional for me.  I’ll still keep case for those occasions when 3-4 cards are needed.
3.0,It was Okey...the shirt wasn't as puffy
3.0,"I own many pairs of jeans in Nydj, all size 0. This shirt is size 0 was way loose all over"
3.0,It is very thin I thought it would be thicker for the price.
3.0,I got a size 8 but the top part of this suit is too short on the top side. I’m only 5’3” with just average sized bust but the back part rides up and the front smashes you down.
3.0,"The fabric is cheap allowing rolls to show, not an attractive feature on me. I have to wear a cami in order to avoid this."
3.0,"If you don't have anything in the bottom compartment it will not stand up.  I put a towel in it.  It is okay but I should have just went with a regular beach bag.  To use the bottom as a cooler makes it heavy and the bag does not feel like it will hold up well under that weight.  Better to just get a regular beach bag and separate cooler.  I don't care for the mesh. Personal preference, I guess!"
3.0,It’s a cute top. Fits as expected. Material is cheap and it fades easily.
3.0,"This dress was cute, but it was short. MAYBE a midi length dress, but definitely not a maxi length by any stretch of the imagination."
3.0,"Colors are gorgeous, but the fact that they only have the small wrist size frustrates me, the band was too small for my wrist!"
3.0,This product is soft and comfortable but the material is very heavy. Then elastic at neck area looks very cheaply made. Needs a new design.
3.0,"I like these belts, and for the price point they are pretty great. My only complaint is that it is only leather on the front half of the belt, with elastic on the back. This makes the belt look cheap and doesn't give it as tight of a fit as if they'd used leather all around the belt. Cute front closure, will work well on my vintage dresses if it can pull them in tight enough."
3.0,They're really cute but they do leave the bluish green marks on each end from the fake metal. So I wouldn't recommend for every day wear.
3.0,Looks cute only thing is I’m not feeling the silver thought the necklace was all rope it has a silver lobster and links also it looks like it will break at the part where the pendant is connected to the chain but all and all it’s really cute and weight a great size
3.0,I misread and thought they came as pairs. My fault. They are uncomfortable to me even after shaping to my ear. I bought both sets and i get all kinds of compliments but i cant wear them all day like i want to.
3.0,I didn't like the fit even though the size was ok.
3.0,"Shoes was ok...it was a bit big, if it was to my taste I would certainly have forced it to fit....but i wasnt so in love with.  Sturdy shoes however."
3.0,A little too lightweight for the coming months maybe.
3.0,Cute color puffer but sleeves were long s s too bulky.
3.0,Nice material but way smaller than expected
3.0,Fit small & easily ripped
3.0,"Too large and too long, but it has pocket for your phone)))"
3.0,Sizing is inconsistent.  Some of the shirts Sizing and stretch isn't the same
3.0,"The chain might fit my ankle, but for the price it was fine."
3.0,"I like it, but the everything except for the string is plastic, which I wasn't expecting. I was expecting it to be metal. But I like the style."
3.0,This did not fit my vision grill as well as I would have liked it to.  It is a little loose and moves around if I let it.  It would be better if it were more adjustable and the gripping fixtures were adjustable.
3.0,Beautiful dress but sadly way to small couldn't even get over my chest and it was a 4x . Fit more like a XL or larger.
3.0,"This item is ok. The material is on the cheap side when you touch it but the sheen will make it look a little nicer. Although if around your bare neck might feel a bit scratchy. I felt it was too long. I was looking for a short neck scarf, this is as long as my winter scarfs.<br />From a style standpoint it will definitely make you stand out as nautical."
3.0,"I wore it out one day for a morning walk and later to go Pokemon hunting. It was cute and didn't make my hair feel like it was burning on my head.<br /><br />Only thing was... I could not get it to stay on if I were to just skip a step or jog for 2 seconds. I tried bobby pinning it down but it looks very weird through the mesh part. Need to figure out a way to keep it on my head.<br /><br />I even had my hair in a pony tail going through the back and it still falls right off. So, not ideal for jogging/jumping/skipping of any sort. Mind you, I also have a normal size head. I kept the adjustment in the back as it. Fitted."
3.0,Made well runs small I wear 8 shoe
3.0,They are slippery not good to walk in a hard surface very soft can’t walk.  Size was ok .
3.0,"I just received this skirt. It is very sheer, including the lining. With the two layers together it's not too bad but still more sheer than I'd like considering it does have two layers. It also is shorter than I was hoping. I am 5'5&#34; and ordered a medium and it comes to my ankles. There also isn't a tag on it at all which makes me wonder? It is pretty though and looks just like the photo."
3.0,It's fine but I think overpriced.
3.0,"Really cute, but bought a medium based on the size chart and it ended up being too big so I had to return it."
3.0,"Tight on arms, had to alter but perfect length and fitting everywhere else"
3.0,"Not very bright, but it works.  Doesn't tangle up like some do.  I wish they had a brighter, more silvery version.  This one looks dull."
3.0,"They just had a weird fit. They make me look like I have a big old Mom Butt. I mean it’s a look. Then the crack makes it look like my big butt is eating the underwear. So they are sexy if your into Big old Mom butts. I wasn’t expecting this look ,but I’m a freak I’ll rock it."
3.0,"This is cute enough, but it isn't as pretty as the picture online made it. The braided cord looks very nice, but the finding/gem piece isn't as pretty."
3.0,"We bought this for my 10 yr olds sport glasses. First, while putting the strap on the glasses One fit nicely & one I had to force. But once on, the hooks wanted to slip out of the glasses. However, the biggest issue is fit. With it tightened all the way the glasses are still not snug on his head and the strap hangs. So it defeats the whole purpose of having a strap. This is advertised for kids. It is an adult strap!"
3.0,"These fit as expected. However, the harder material used for the piece that goes over your foot, cuts into your toes a bit if you walk around. Theyre ok to the pool, or from the car to the beach. But i cant wear for more than a couple minutes."
3.0,"I ordered two different colors, but same style and they fit differently. The dark denim is larger than the light denim in the same size."
3.0,"this necklace needs help...when i put it on I thought it was on backwards, tried it 3X, then every time i moved or bent over it would turn upside down, it was very aggravating.  Not sure I'll wear it anytime soon, I spent all day flipping it back upside."
3.0,Cute suit but the bottoms are really cut more for a teen.  It was way too small on the bottom (and pretty big on the top.)  I bought another suit in a medium and it fit just fine.
3.0,It doesn't quite fit as portrayed by the model. The shirt covers up a lot more of the bust than expected. You need one heck of a push up bra to get the model's effect.
3.0,"I absolutely love the hot pink. Oakley does not offer hot pink socks. However trying to get these on one of the sides tore. I used hand sanitizer to try and slick these up, but they are very tight. I have traded out with Oakley socks previously and did not have the fit issue, but the color is enough that I might would buy these again."
3.0,was good at first but snapped in half in the first week. its good for costumes for one night but after repeated use and abuse it will break.
3.0,"Not bad, not good. For the price its not horrible but seems are definitely poorly sewn and fabric is super thin."
3.0,"It is a very cute skirt, but listen to the reviews! I am so glad I did. I usually wear a medium and I get that size because it is still big. Well, I got a Large..it was just the right size not much extra room at all.. Also, I am 5 foot 3 inches and weigh 135."
3.0,Cannot clean the dirt off as well as the original manufacture’s band. This one has a gummier feel.
3.0,"Dislike these glasses immensely. Not at all the company's fault, however. Just a personal opinion as I am unable to adjust to the lines where the bifocal changes from reading to regular. (Hope that makes sense)"
3.0,Not horrible but not the best material. Very thin and some areas almost see through. For larger girls you can see every nook and cranny.
3.0,Nice colors but material is polyester. Not a soft cotton. Returned it. Would have been cute tho.
3.0,"Fit like it should, but really thin"
3.0,I like it because it is a frog but it's not what I really wanted
3.0,Cute but not enough support.
3.0,These are elegant and light weight. Longer than  i thought they would be but gracefully so. Easy to dress up or dead down.
3.0,I bought a couple sizes up and it was still too small
3.0,I normally wear 9/10. I ordered a large because I had read it ran small. It's quite small.  It is also quite short waisted.
3.0,"I wanted to love this suit it's super cute. I got one for both of the babies (turning 1 and 2) We are going to have a teddybear picnic for their birthday. The smaller one fits well around the torso but the arms and legs are too long, no biggie roll them up but the next size up had the same size torso as the smaller size. It will go on so it works for this winter but it won't fit for long. Also the larger size, the arms are long enough for the hand flaps to cover his hands but the legs are too short. I was going to order the next size up but it won't make it here in time so what we have will have to work. I would have given 5stars if the second one was like the first just bigger."
3.0,"This came and it was yellow, not while. It was still cute and I still wore it, it just wasn't what I was expecting."
3.0,"I did not expect much, and this did not disappoint.  It's a rather nice quarter machine prize"
3.0,"let me start by saying that it is a very cute garment however, despite the large size the bodice on this dress is too tight to even button and the skirt portion is way longer than I anticipated."
3.0,"Definitely should have gone up a size. A little to tight in the bust and upper arms for me. I'm about 5'5&#34; and typically take a 14/16 or large/extra large in most things, so even though other reviews were claiming the dress runs a little large, that wasn't the case here. Though the dress was very pretty in design, the overall craftsmanship wasn't very good. But I guess that's to be expected with this kind of cheaply mass produced products. You get what you paid for."
3.0,too large to wrap around waist.
3.0,I like this head scarf but the elastic around the edges does stretch the more you wear it to the point I have to tie a string around it to keep it from slipping off. I dont have a loot of hair so I'm not sure why it wont stay on. I do like it even though it won't stay put.
3.0,"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter. She really loves it. It’s comfortable and looks really cute.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the seams on the edges unstitched in a few spots and we have had to repair it. She uses it properly, without excessive stress, so this product should have held up.<br /><br />It gets 3 stars for being really cute, fitting perfectly, and lasting a few months before needing repair."
3.0,"Really pretty, the only thing I am upset about is two pair are missing pieces a feather on one and a chain on the other pair"
3.0,Very pretty dress but very thin and see-through.
3.0,Nice little pair
3.0,My Son like a wallet pretty much his best Christmas gift
3.0,"The shirt has a great look, but the front needs work. The holes where the button go snag all the time and I'm ripping the buttons out. If you have a large bust this is not for you."
3.0,It's beautiful but it fits a little snug but that's more on me🙁
3.0,Good price but fits weirdly
3.0,"Not like the picture, there is a lot of black in it"
3.0,"its ok, order a larger size, i took the advise of other reviewers and ordered a size up and it fits nice, the fabric is not thick."
3.0,So I bought the right size for myself and made sure it would fit but it barely even works. I have to have it super tight in order to have it do what they show you and by that point it pulls in yours ears so much you get a a head ache
3.0,"I wanted to love these! They are sturdy and lightweight. However, I can’t stand metals that have that strong metal smell, which these do.  So, I’m having to return. Other than the smell, there is nothing wrong with them."
3.0,came apart at the conector after a few uses
3.0,I really like this bag. Great color and size however it does not have an inside pocket as advertised
3.0,Pant is extremely long<br />Poor quality material
3.0,"It was OK, but not the blue I was hoping for.  I gave them away."
3.0,"Price was good, hat was too big, but it'll fit next year"
3.0,Looks good. Supposed to be reversible but you would have to unscrew the buckle each time and I find that to be a hassle. Has an odd smell to it. I've cleaned it and letting it &#34;air out&#34; now so hopefully it goes away.
3.0,The item looked to me made of cheap materials and I got it not with metalic silver as promised
3.0,"I purchased the red polkadot dress and it’s very cute. Fits nicely and the material is soft. It would’ve been nice if the polkadots were a little smaller, but it’s nice to wear around the house."
3.0,I would not recommend this dress to friends and family
3.0,There’s NO GIVE in the waistline!!!!!!! But other than that I like the pants
3.0,Did not expand as expected.
3.0,"I'm not sure how this is a valet keychain as there is no way of separating the keys once in the key ring, but I do like the color and feel of the keychain."
3.0,"The jacket is great as a costume and the price was just right for that purpose.  Lucky thing I ordered a Large because it is smaller but, it will work with the right top under it."
3.0,Love it but the battery died after 1 month of use...very dissappointed...
3.0,They were awkwardly big and heavy and I ended up losing one about a week after I received them. Very disappointed since I thought they were adorable.
3.0,"Definitely order a size (or two) up to try and avoid gapping! It's very thin fabric, I ordered the brick color which a) was more of a coral color, so slightly seethrough, and b) shows every single wrinkle. The cut and buttons are cute, but that's expected with the price. Overall cute and comfortable, I may order a darker color just for an easy sundress to have on pool or beach days!"
3.0,The bag was ok. Cute and all. But I dont feel like it will last my granddaughter a long time
3.0,Super flimsy material. It's hit or miss with some of the seller sellers
3.0,I loved this dress when I first opened. It fits great. The top keeps me well covered.  After a few wears though it’s peeling under the armpits.
3.0,"So great. They definitely help the sun not blind you. My only complaint is it kinda darkens your sight to do this so it’s hard to see what’s directly in front of you as far as if the sun is in your sight. This makes no sense but it’s so hard to explain. For example, it’s just definitely harder to check my blind spot, and I have to lift the shades because it’s a struggle. Or play volleyball when I’m facing the sun because although the sun rays aren’t making me squint, you can’t see the ball coming at the same time unless it’s coming from a direction the sun is not in. Which probably still makes no sense. The quality of sight is just impaired, but I still have no regrets on buying these. At all. They’re so cheap, and I desperately needed some. I’m extremely glad I heard the recommendation for these, read the reviews, and got them. I probably will be on the browse for a separate pair of shades as well while still using these. This review may be confusing but understand I still highly recommend them. They’re truly a steal. AND YES THE MIRROR LENSES ARE A+"
3.0,"Great look, but made for small folk."
3.0,Would fit better if had a little stretch in material.
3.0,Gorgeous but poor quality. The hook fell off and I'm unable to wear or return.
3.0,Don’t get me wrong I like them. But they are sooo thin. I was scared I was going to tear them.
3.0,Liked the colors but there was a flaw in the material.Kept because I had thrown packaging away before flaw was noticed. Runs a little small but nice.
3.0,Nice top but does not fit as expected.
3.0,"Loved the jeans, and bought my true size, but they were too tight around the waist. I couldn 't even button them"
3.0,"It's a cute hat, in a gimmicky sort of way. Kinda small. The printing isn't high-quality, but I like that the design requires &#34;insider knowledge&#34; to be appreciated. I bought it for my lady and she loved it, but it's more of a showpiece/household accoutrement than everyday item. If you have some spare dough for your Firefly fan and a place to keep it semi-displayed, go for it. But don't go out of your weekly budget, if you know what I mean..."
3.0,"These are okay. Not much traction to them, but if you really tighten them, they get the job done."
3.0,Cute kids but hate the necklace
3.0,"The top fit fine. A little itchy on the collar as the sequins are hemmed in a way that they are folded over and touch the neck inside. Thankfully I was using the pants as fabric to alter something else, but there was no way this could have fit me. They didn't go up past my knees. Weird how a lot of clothing designers will make something big enough for a larger chested girl and then they don't assume that girl is probably well endowed on the bottom too."
3.0,Socks are cute but poor quality & durability.
3.0,"Even it's smallest size is large for me, but with a little stitching it fits well."
3.0,"My daughter loves them because she lives anything lol surprise but they are too short especially the pants. Not too thin not thick, perfect for her because she really does not like to wear clothes. They came with a hole in the inner thigh so I would say not properly stitched together and stretched out really fast."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:819f31082b56507f405aa9557af110d4]] Perfect fitting on my wrist. Easy install,  replace brand and like this colors. Wore this since February 16. I stopped wearing it because I don't want the colors worn out so fast. Of course no refund. That's alright but learned it what's worth to test."
3.0,The wrist band broke when trying to put it one. Never was able to wear it.
3.0,Very pretty looks just like the picture.  This one got here faster than expected.  It's a perfect gift for a teen or young adult.
3.0,"They were smaller then what I thought they were,I thought they were bigger  then what they were but still thier ok"
3.0,"Very pretty dress, but low quality."
3.0,"I was surprised when the product arrive without a key ring. For $10 I would think the ring would be there, since it is advertised as a keychain. I may have missed it, and yet I don't recall the description saying the ""keychain"" doesn't come with a key ring. So strange. Disappointing also."
3.0,Pretty. But it fits small. I would say it's not unisex. It's made to fit a woman.
3.0,"Fit is ok, though &#34;package&#34; area is not very breathable.  Also sort of looks like superhero costume."
3.0,Item was used looking with scuff marks.
3.0,"My initial reaction to putting this on was how much I liked the full coverage on the sides & the back feels very supportive.<br />After adjusting everything in place, my armpits are painfully squeezed! The seam right under both pits just cuts in. I tried it for a stretch session, but had to switch for my workout.<br />[SIZE REFERENCE]<br />I typically wear 36B, followed the manufacturer’s size chart & ordered a Medium. I’m 5’8” & 140 lbs. I should have followed my gut & gotten a Large - my size in most of the sports bras I own, but the size chart is very clear!<br />Maybe it’s just the way I’m built, but this armpit dig is too much. All of the lifting & stretching & pulling that I have tried really doesn’t change that.<br />I’m going to wear it for short periods of time to see if it stretches a bit. Like I said, maybe it’s just a thing with my body because the bra design is nice if you like full coverage. Maybe it’s just for more petite frames?<br /><br />Thanks for reading this & I hope that it’s Helpful!"
3.0,Fit is smaller than expected
3.0,"I originally ordered a Large but it was so tight, so I sent it back and ordered the XL, it fit better but the length is too short, otherwise it's really cute!"
3.0,Work very well! But the bottoms have worn out. They are very thin in the feet area & wont last long if you work 12 hour shifts on your feet
3.0,"It is an ok shirt. It does come with a really potent plastic/fishy smell that I hope washes out. The sleeves are actually sewn and folded the way the picture shows, but the print is not that cute faded look that is pictured. It is bright and shiny paint. I will still wear this shirt as long as the smell comes out."
3.0,"I like this purse just be advised it is small. If you don't really lug much around then it's perfect, for me as an everyday bag though it was just not logical. It's good material sturdy great purse.... just a wee bit too small"
3.0,It’s a cool concept and the whole process was really cool to do. The pearl jingles around since it’s very much smaller than the cage but you can’t expect exact sizes.
3.0,"Keep in mind this is made/shipped from China , therefore it runs VERY SMALL.  I normally wear M / L....  After reading some reviews I thought, with Free Returns, I would order up.  The XXL fits in chest & waist area.  It oddly enough does not run longer in length other than the sleeves.  It's weird but I'm keeping it to wear with a vest untucked.  NOT with leggings as it still hits right at butt .  Other than the fit, the quality is good and is softer than other flannel shirts"
3.0,"They are not washable , but they are comfortable."
3.0,Ultra buttery soft material with immense stretch. this was way too long on me but great for a taller person.
3.0,"They're ok, no better or worse than other similar brands. But pricey for 3 pair."
3.0,Seems to be a nice yoga strap. However it is advertised as being a mat strap as well. It did not come with instructions or diagrams on how to configure the flat strap into a shoulder carrier for the mat. I'm giving it 3 stars because it is adequate as a yoga strap. I'd give it one star for use as a carrying strap and user frendliness.
3.0,"I like these bangles. The design is elegant and unique. I bend it a little to get onto my wrist, then bend it closed again. I got one in &#34;brown&#34; and one in that light &#34;silver&#34;. The bronze one looks great and just like the picture.<br /><br />The &#34;silver&#34; picture doesn't do it justice: I thought that the lines on the leaf would be more muted, but they are bright and visible. Looks even better than on the picture.<br /><br />The only problem is - after a day of wearing it, I got very light green streaks on my wrist. Very light - not like some other bracelets, and easily washable, but that isn't quite what I was looking for in a bracelet."
3.0,"At first it looked great. After looking closer, I noticed a little cut in the bowtie. Quality control could be better."
3.0,Worth it .
3.0,"Very see-through, but a fun skirt! Little smaller than what I was expecting."
3.0,Cute gold was a lil too yellow but otherwise cute
3.0,I like how the jeans fit me. I did not have to worry about buttoning my pants because it has a draw string. What I did not like about the jeans is it had a strong factory dye smell. I had to wash several times to get the smell out of the jeans.
3.0,These were not appealing to my husband. He doesn’t find the material helpful for sweatband. I think its a personal preference.
3.0,Size is fine but quality is really cheap.
3.0,"I bought the pink and got a Large based on the description on the product, not the size chart.  It’s absolutely HUGE!  I haven’t decided if I’ll bother trying a Medium yet or just try shopping locally for the color. We’re doing family photos and I thought it would add a pop of color.  The material isn’t awful like some products I’ve read where it’s shriveled and icky. This is a pretty nice top, just not the right fit I was anticipating."
3.0,didnt fit had to return for larger size
3.0,Quality isnt great.  The material is thin and the shirt is a little smaller than I expected
3.0,"Its very simple. Its a little hard to hold it open, and the teeth look rather sharp. I haven't used it yet on an actual tie since it is a birthday gift for my boyfriend, but I hope the sharp teeth won't tear up his nice ties. I kind of wished I would have splurged on a nicer one. I knew there was a reason it was only a few bucks"
3.0,The fit and color was perfect.  The under layer length was much too short for me.  Returned it.
3.0,Bought this for my girlfriend and they did not last as long as I would have hoped.  Very cheap make up and they tore very quick...
3.0,It's very nice the only thing that I didn't like is it's the type of banned that starts to stick after a while so of course I just wash it really good while I'm in the shower...Also the lock on one of the bands broke so I'm not sure how I will unlock it to change the bands
3.0,"Cute fabric, but not made as well as I was hoping."
3.0,The outline of Kyle Ren is very fuzzy. Not  a good image.
3.0,Cheap..button popped off first time I wore them.
3.0,"Tee shirt material.  Kind of thin. Nice color, green"
3.0,"flimsy, breaks easily"
3.0,"This necklace came extremely tangled, and it took me a long time to untangle it. It tangles easily in general."
3.0,The fabric was a lot thicker than expected.
3.0,"Since it's a long-sleeved dress, I bought it for cooler weather. Unfortunately, I sent it back because the material is very thin. Definitely for warm weather."
3.0,"Earrings are gorgeous, but one of them came broken, there was no hole in the earring for it to be connected."
3.0,Beautiful & sophisticated
3.0,"I like the necklace,but, the earrings came apart as soon as I opened it. I am going to keep because I like the necklace."
3.0,Looks more a nightshirt instead.
3.0,"Great Jacket and style.  I'm 5-6'' 160 Arms were too tight, had to send it back. Cool Jacket though."
3.0,I felt like it was really cute but there was one bead on it that was very discolored
3.0,"I need cotton in the hot summer climate.  Well made, good cut but the cotton fabric is cheap.  OK for price and wearing around house."
3.0,"On the model, the kaftan appears to be long enough for a dress. I bought it for that reason. Now I'm stuck with a blouse, I need to get pants for."
3.0,Love the look but it leaks.
3.0,"I ordered: Wine Red, Medium<br /><br />My measurements:<br />38D/bust 41"", waist 33"", hips 41""<br />height 5'6"", weight 165 lbs<br />Usual size is medium, 10/12<br /><br />Shirt fit - Quite snug and long.  I could wear it and it looks okay, but felt uncomfortably small, especially up by the arm holes. For some, I bet the length makes up for the snugness as the shirt is probably best worn ruched up in the waist. I will be returning and getting a large though.<br /><br />Shirt aesthetics - The material was a stretchy/semi-shiny activewear material which I wasn't expecting. The ""wine"" red was more of a cherry red, not as 'rusty' as pictured.  It would make a cute workout top.<br /><br />Shirt quality - seems like good quality.  Material is a good thickness; thick enough to hide imperfections without adding bulk."
3.0,"The cups are too small, and the band is too big.  Seems to be well made, but I won't know until I reiece the exchange."
3.0,Not sure how to get wrinkles out other than hanging over time. Looks good other than the gathering being a bit irregular in some places. Hoping time will make a difference. I'm barely 5'2 and this is a great length for me with a 2 inch heel it's perfect.
3.0,I like graphic t’s large so that I can tie a knot. I normally wear a L-XL in shirts. I ordered an XXL and it fit me like a L. It also doesn’t look at rustic in person as it does in the photo.
3.0,It is comfortable the pads in it are kind of thick and big.
3.0,"great value, but totally tights, and see through, not leggings."
3.0,"This was way thinner than I expected and not the color I thought. I thought it was going to be a bright red/orange but it was a rusty orange pumpkin color. I dont know how they got it to look that good in the photo. However if you read all of the description they did not give false info. I just went by what I saw and assumed it would look that way. It may be perfect for someone wanting an orange, very thin, open robe."
3.0,"it does not look real, it looks like a plastic :("
3.0,The quality is really nice. All the lights worked and the wires on the inside don't bleed through the mask. But the mask is super small. Doesn't fit my face but fits my 12 year old niece's face perfectly!
3.0,Heavy and noisy. Will work for what I wanted it for.
3.0,"I was looking for heavy weight black socks for excessive walking and traveling, these socks that are advertised as heavy cushion are no heavier than the worn socks I am trying to replace."
3.0,"This worked really well for our Hawaii vacation to protect my daughters feet at the beach. They lasted a few days before they shredded at the toe. Although it didn't last long, I'm glad she had them"
3.0,"The masks were in a box and wrapped together in plastic wrap, not in individually packaged as advertised.<br />The size is adult large, black outer layer and white inner layer."
3.0,"I am a big guy and wear 2xl shirts. I bought this in 2xl and it fits, but does run small. Material is very thin but it is a nice quality shirt for the price."
3.0,"Bought the gray first and it was a nice warm material, this one is very thin.  I like the color but wish it was heavier material ."
3.0,They're nice but they feel thick and not that breathable.<br /><br />Was hoping for something I could wear WHILE working out that was extremely breathable and moisture wicking.
3.0,"Great shirt, but the sizing was too big.  I returned it for a different style."
3.0,"It was an ok shirt, fit fine. I didn't like how the sleeves flair out."
3.0,"One ear wire was broken, replaced the ear wire."
3.0,"I never know what size to order when ordering over seas.  Generally you have to order several sized too big in hopes of it fitting and then you pray no one sees the tag that says you wear a size 17 X.  Well this is not that. I ordered an XL for my size men’s small nephew and it arrives as your typical men’s XL. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Even better, I ordered TWO different ones, both too big. So I can mail them back for $17,000 or keep them and try again, (which I swear is a selling strategy).<br />With all that said, the quality was fine. Color was nice. Good luck ordering sizes as usual."
3.0,"I liked the color and the look but the problem I had is when I pulled them up, one of the belt loops pulled out. It is thin material and would have been well to put reinforcement around the loops. The sizing is a lot smaller than what they say. I wear a size 36 but wanted a loose fit so I thought I ordered size 38, I got size 40 and they fit like I wanted."
3.0,"It is cute and very warm, but the fabric felt itchy to me. Almost scratches me. Fun and instyle look, but sadly die to the itchiness, I won't be wearing it."
3.0,I should have only sizes up one or two sizes. I usually wear a size 16-18 in jeans and should have gotten a 2x
3.0,"Great hat for travel, I didn't care for the white chin strap that made it feel like a bonnet - but it traveled well in my suitcase from DC to Thailand."
3.0,"While I absolutely loved the look of this, the negatives far outweighed the positives.<br /><br />1. The “stem” of the earring is way too long. Unless you have thick ears, the earring is going to flip around and not stay in place. Easy fix for this though. Take one of those gummy earring backs (the kind that come with hook earrings), cut it to the right thickness, and put it on the stem to hold it in place.<br /><br />2. The earring doesn’t screw in at the ball “stopper” on the back. The stem screws into the decorative earring piece. This makes it super hard to screw on and off.<br /><br />3. It is very hard to secure it tightly. The metal is slippery and the threading only rotates like 2 times. I was very worried it was going to fall out. I actually had to grab pliers to get a good enough hold to tighten it more.<br /><br />4.  I don’t know about other people, but this was so painful to sleep in because the stem was so long. It dig into my ear and side of my head. I actually couldn’t sleep on the side with the earring at all. Took it out after a couple months because I was sick of not being able to sleep on my left side."
3.0,Very comfortable to wear after back surgery.
3.0,"Even though there were quality issues, I gave this 3 stars because the backpack was very pretty and roomy.  However, the backpack was too long and the strap could not be adjusted to shorten it. Also the drink holder on the side was too small.  Even the smallest water bottle would not fit."
3.0,For my teen daughter who is not quite 5’2” and 90 pounds.  Size fit her well.  But after first wash the material has started to pill.  Will be throwing away after Xmas but she wanted fun holiday joggers for remote learning.
3.0,It's not a soft material like the picture shows. It's a leathery material. It smelled very fishy when I got it. I kept it outside in the sun to air out for a few days and the smell is mostly gone.
3.0,I am not pleased with the color of the skirt. It has an ashy appearance and I wish it was black as shown in the picture. It's cute so that is why I give it three stars.
3.0,I bought the 18 to 24 month size and it's way to big for my 18 month old. But it did fit my niece who is 2 1/2 years old a little better. The straps kept falling off her(my niece) shoulders.<br /><br />I did love the material. Super soft and silky. Also seems pretty durable and not cheaply made. It is just as pictured just to big.
3.0,"I bought this too thinking it was actually embroidered but it’s not, it’s just screen printed on the shirt !"
3.0,They're pretty cute but they aren't really plus sized. I still wear them but only up to the knee as any higher and they start to roll. They're well made so if you are looking for a good pair and you don't have chubby thighs then look no further.
3.0,"Color is NOT what is shown. Actual color is an orangey brown, not pretty at all."
3.0,"The dress was ok but the sleeves were too wide. I did order a size bigger than my normal size but still the sleeves were way wider than I expected. It was also a little too long but I'm 5'2"" so that might be the reason. Also there is no slot to secure the belt. You just have tie which will move from where you want it to be. Other than the above problems, I guess Its ok for the price."
3.0,"Is it worth $10+? Yes. Is it worth more? Not much. The green color was way off from the picture, very dark.  The hardware is cheap of course, and the band won't be as durable as a brand name. It is a decent band and for the price you could buy a lot of them and still come in under what you would pay for a brand name. This a decent option."
3.0,It would be very nice if it ran true to size. The lining feels like it would be comfortable but there really isn't enough stretch. If it were cut a little fuller and a little longer it would be great. I need to return it.
3.0,Nike sign coming off after very little wear
3.0,"So pretty! I love the rose charm, but one of the chains broke within the first week and a half of wearing it."
3.0,The material doesn’t give or stretch at all.
3.0,The chest area was a little big
3.0,The shirt seems short and the pants are huge
3.0,Really like the quality of the shirt. The armpit part was kind of wonky but with a jacket was able to make it work.
3.0,Picture actually better  for the price
3.0,They were a gift and she said they are a smidgen too big
3.0,I don’t know if I was sent a returned item but this was full of soap smell. None of my other neleus item smells like this.
3.0,"mine didn't even come with the packaging just came in a clear bag. It was longer than shown in picture. Overall, good quality"
3.0,"I wear a Medium size Man's Glove and this gloves fit me like a X-Small! My wife wears a Women's Medium and they fit her okay! As for a LARGE SIZE, they are not, or maybe I should say that they are a Child's Large!"
3.0,"Material is cheap feeling, see through as well, flattering shirt style wise"
3.0,The dress is a slick material. I was wanting a t-shirt material or at least cotton.<br />I’m short and it is longer.
3.0,"Came with a chunk of the leather missing, but other than that it's a nice wallet."
3.0,"Seems well-made and looks great, but sizing is off. I ordered a medium, and it's definitely more like a small."
3.0,"Although the jewelry is not bad, it's definitely not high quality or even a matching set. Maybe they could at the very least stick to the same colors."
3.0,Shipped quickly.These did not last as long as other maidenform products I have purchased in the past.One of them is already coming apart after a few months.
3.0,These shoes are good for a sandal that secures more to the foot and for they price they are great! The felcro does weaken over time however.
3.0,"This mask is definitely beautiful, however the quality of the the mask structure leaves something to be desired for smaller faces. Due to the masks weight, it does not stay in place on a smaller face frame well, causing it to slide forward. Add in wearing glasses, and you get on major fog fest. If you are willing to do a little work adding in an extra tie in the back to keep the mask on, I would recommend this mask."
3.0,"It was so pretty, but barely covered the girls."
3.0,"PROS:<br /><br />- Fairly durable material.<br /><br />- I ordered mine in Sand, which is actually coyote brown, which I like very much.  The picture is true to the actual color, so don't be confused by the name.<br /><br />- I don't understand why people are griefing over the zipper.  I like the double zipper and many military and heavy duty jackets (this is honestly neither) have one.  I like it because I can drive with the jacket on, unzip the bottom, and still be able to reach everything on my duty belt.  When I get out of the car I zip it down.  What's with the complaints about this?<br /><br />- This jacket runs low, which is great for anyone that's experienced &#34;ice butt&#34;.  Not so great for people that carry a sidearm, but hey, just fold that side up and tuck it behind your weapon.<br /><br />- Blocks cold wind very well.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- It runs a little small.  If you are going to wear body armor, especially a Load Bearing Vest/Plate Carrier (LBV/PC), or you like to kid yourself about what size you really wear - absolutely GET ONE SIZE LARGER. Alternatively, if you wear an LBV/PC outside of it or have a physically fit reason for needing a large size everything will fit just right - as long as you are the size that you insist you are.  I ordered a 2X as I am a 6'1&#34; muscular guy with about 15 extra pounds and a 54&#34; non flabby chest.  This coat fits me, but barely. I would not be able to wear a sweater underneath it.<br /><br />- I thought I wouldn't mind not having a removable or foldable hood, but I do.  I actually hate it and will probably cut the hood off and sew the collar shut.  So just to let everyone know, there is no way to fold the hood into an interior compartment.  You will just have this hood, filling with rain, snow or leaves that will run down your face when you put it on.  Further, this is a jacket for a barely chilly climate.  I've been in cold places before.  I know what cold is.  This jacket is for Georgia or South Carolina at the coldest - and not in the mountains of either of those states and probably not even in January, and it fits too tight for me to layer under it.  Meaning that the jacket is so light and for such mildly cold weather that the hood is kind of idiotic anyway. The detachable hood issue is my preference and my fault for ordering it, but I'm providing this information to help others.<br /><br />- The sleeve straps are nothing short of stupid.  They are not long enough so when I tighten them they are hanging on to less than an inch of velcro and I have these long, stupid tags hanging off of my sleeves.<br /><br />- The &#34;velcro&#34; patches are smaller than I'd like.  I would also prefer at least one on the front for a badge patch and name tape, but I knew that wasn't there when I ordered it.<br /><br />- The arm zippers are COLD when you put it on over a t-shirt at 30f. They need to be covered with a flap of material.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />It's OK, but barely.  You are going to be buying a jacket for the fall season in most places.  It is light. The zippers in the arms will run chills down your spine.  It ain't a Rothco or a Condor.  Accept those things and you will have a light jacket.  If you want a heavy duty real military jacket, spend $70 more and get one of those.  This is worth the money - but they really need to give you a removable hood or just delete it altogether."
3.0,"Thin, cute, comfy...holds up well in wash<br />Just much shorter and smaller than expected for large size"
3.0,"It was an ok boot. I just wasn't in love with it and decided to return it for a pair of boots I do love. I wanted the heel to be a slightly higher. But it wasn't bad boots, just looking for something particular."
3.0,Good for knock around
3.0,"mas o menos, no es lo que esperaba"
3.0,Larger would be better
3.0,Like the look run Big .
3.0,"I was so excited to get these. I love most of them and they fit very true to size. I am 8mm and they fit perfectly! Only thing I dont like is the sparkle ones and opalite, which were the ones I was most excited to get. One is bright, very sparkly, absolutely gorgeous! Then the other one is dingy, dark, with hardly any sparkle. The opalites, one is transparent and the other is almost white. I dont mind them being a little different but they are very very different. Pretty upset about these. (Edited to add better pictures)"
3.0,"Sizing is as expected however, they are see through. Cannot wear unless under a dress or very long shirt."
3.0,Good quality but I wish that The letter were bigger
3.0,I love the color!! But I am a little disappointed in the fit. I am typically a M size so that is what I ordered. But I can only wear a tank top under it. Anything would make it too tight. Other than that I like it.
3.0,No good quality! From buttons come out color and one button is damaged!<br />But seller &#34;T.F.N. SHOPPING&#34; is working really very good
3.0,Lies!<br />There are no pockets.
3.0,I ordered size L but is too small.good quality
3.0,"I’m 5”4, 112-115lbs. I wanted to like this sooo much, but it’s just too big. The product itself is pretty well made and looks just like the picture, only issue being it looks like a sack on me. :(((((("
3.0,"Pretty print , liked the style & color, was delivered promptly. I usually wear a 6 or size small but have had good luck with similar dresses from Amazon by ordering a size medium.  This medium dress was very tight.  I returned it.  Considering about trying it in a large."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:651cb735462e46e290cfd6c97af9ded3]] The pictures definitely made it look like you would be able to see the picture and the words clearly.as you can see the stiching goes into the words and the quality is not great. The plus is it did come with filters although the filter pouch is open on both sides. The fit is actually good and the ears are adjustable.  I'm on the fence about returning them because I would really like to see all the writing. Hopefully this review helps someone.
3.0,Gets tangled to easy
3.0,"The look of the dress is OK, but the fabric just feels weird and papery almost. It’s lightweight, but at the same time it’s a little stiff, so the ruffles end up falling in weird places around the neck. Not terrible, but not great. I tried wearing it both ways, with the sleeves past the shoulders, as well as over the shoulders. This just gets three stars. See photo."
3.0,"Beautiful blanket scarf to mix and match during the cold weather months. However, the lint shedding is somewhat extreme. The next time i wear it I will most definitely have a mini lint brush on hand."
3.0,"These are too small to fit over my grandson’s glasses, and he has small frames. Will be used by another grandchild who doesn’t wear glasses."
3.0,"I ordered a 2XL,to have an oversized fit, but it was short as well as very tight around the arms"
3.0,"I am 5'2 and 100 lbs.  I usually wear a size small.  This item was too small in the shoulders and arm length.  The quality of the sweater was nice, as it was lightweight and had a nice texture to it."
3.0,I love the dress for the price the quality isn’t bad however her dress came damaged. The lace is falling off the bottom and I am upset because I don’t have enough time to send it back and ask for an exchange as her Baptism shoot is in two days. I now have to find a tailor to fix it and with the coronavirus issue not many places are open right now. I would give this dress a higher rating if it wasn’t for that.
3.0,I have larger thighs so there was a bit of difficult keeping them up.  They are as stated thigh highs.
3.0,"I expected this to be big and a bit off the shoulder, but it was not that at all. It looks a bit strange where the stitching is and isn't something I can even wear outside of working out without feeling strange. I ordered one size up and it is very snug around the midsection. The arms are plenty loose, but it doesn't even come close to being flowy enough to drape off the shoulder. I would have returned them, but I damaged one when getting them out of the package."
3.0,It's pretty bit the one size fits all didn't work for me too small.
3.0,"Extremely tight, but nice material. I’d say it works more for a casual evening versus anything formal."
3.0,Great customer service but they run very small. I wouldn’t recommend if you are a size 12 or more.
3.0,Too thick and hard to breathe through
3.0,"This was a gift and fit good.  The only disappointment was instead of the light colored blue, it arrived a dark blue.  Still liked it though."
3.0,"The top was too small, but liked the length."
3.0,"It's cheap and cheezy, but really pretty. Colors are bright. But the words at the bottom make no sense - which, is actually kind of a fun thing about the shirt, lol. You can't see them in the picture, lol. But it's just junky material and poorly sewn. I feel bad for supporting this company, as I have a feeling the laborers are not exactly well paid - or paid fairly."
3.0,The top firs as described. It’s not very thick but I’m ok with that. I love the color!
3.0,"This was my second pair to order and i was very disappointed that this pair was a good 1/2 size smaller than the other color same style that I ordered. And unfortunately I missed the return window so am now stuck with shoes that I cannot wear. Other than that, these would have been good shoes.<br />the sizing may be off depending on color."
3.0,"I like the quality, and I like the color of these beanies. They were not as large as I expect them to be. There really is not a nice drop of the cap in the back of your head as shown in the picture. I'm hoping they will stretch after washing."
3.0,"Tiny. It's not "" 3 x 3 x 4 inches."" It is child sized."
3.0,The looked good but shrunk a lot with cold water wash
3.0,It ripped like after 3 hours of wearing. Very pretty though. Amazon contacted me and offered me a refund or another product so that was cool.
3.0,"After reading the split reviews, I purchased this dress and ordered my normal size (large). I am typically a size large in dresses (size 10 or 12 in jeans for reference) and a 36DD in the bust, but to me this dress if somewhat tight in the burst area. Their are 4 buttons on the top that while they would allow easy access for a nursing mama to breastfeed, it’s not as friendly for the busty women. I feel an XL would’ve been more comfortable up top, but then too long for my 5’4 frame as it’s already long now. Overall I’d give the dress a 3/5 simply because the top/bust runs a whole size smaller to me."
3.0,Nice but I gave it away as a gift
3.0,"Decent... Not the most comfortable, no arch support. Not my favorite."
3.0,"Great quality, fast shipping and seamless return as it was too large in the cups."
3.0,I am a little curvy but I got the size suggested and it is skin tight which is unfortunate because I wanted it as more of a lounging outfit.
3.0,Bigger than expect but fabric is so very soft!
3.0,"They are a little flimsy, the lenses keep popping out and have to be put back in.  But they do come with a fun container and wipes"
3.0,Daughter is a size 5/7 and I ordered a large. It runs a little small but it's nice.
3.0,"Super soft and comfortable! And they're plenty long enough (I'm 5'10&#34;). Rated lower though because the color was off. I ordered red but I got orange. And they're a bit see through on top, but that's to be expected with most leggings (wear them under a skirt!!)"
3.0,Pulled up after two uses!
3.0,"Really cute but the material gets dirty and discolors quickly ( like after 3-4 washes) , and literally spreads moisture badly-- (saw this in some other reviews as well) for example I spilled a drop of water on the pant leg while wearing this and the tiny drop of water created a giant water mark on the pants about the size of the lid of a large drink. Note: This material will make you sweaty. I am not a very sweaty person and never have this issue with other clothes I regularly wear  but even if you get just a tiny bit hot in this outfit you get giant sweat stains because of the material -- super embarrassing if you're out in public, I usually honestly just wear it when I am lounging purely for style and only when I will not  actively be doing anything."
3.0,Run rather small
3.0,It’s nice and chic
3.0,"While I like the the height and width of this bag, it's a bit deep (front to back) for my taste.It feels a bit bulky to me.  It would be so nice if the decorative strap that goes back to front could be used to cinch the bag in.  Otherwise, it's ok.  The material is soft, but I definitely could tell right away that it's not leather.  (I have other imitation leather bags that really look &#34;real&#34;)  The hardware is cute, but would be better with a brass zipper on top like there is on the front.  Handle height is good, can be carried over the shoulder without the shoulder strap. I would also prefer the zipper to have two zips that met in the middle. Nice pockets on the inside This bag does not have the brass &#34;legs&#34; on the bottom as shown in some of the pics."
3.0,stii trying to get them to fit right
3.0,They feel very cheap...
3.0,I took the beads off because it looks like a kids necklace
3.0,Love the shirt it just fits a little smaller than expected but it still fit.
3.0,"The coat is ok, and maybe mine was a fluke, but the pocket's, on the left, bottom wasn't sewed up, so there is a huge hole (which I will sew up), and the button holes are too small for the large buttons, plus the holes weren't reinforced with an overcast stitching  (also will fix), which these problems aren't the sellers fault, but who makes the coats for them. The vendor is aware, now, and did give me a, suitable, refund. The company's customer service is excellent and I gave them 5 stars, but the coat only gets 3 stars."
3.0,5'6 - 150lbs. order 2 sizes up if you have a big bum like me. I ordered a large and the camel wanted its toe back.
3.0,"Actually, the glasses deserve a full five stars.  My reason for demoting it is that they are not to be worn over regular glasses.  When I saw the pictures, I thought they could be worn over my glasses.  I am preparing to return them because I found another pair that does the trick for me.  If you don't wear glasses, these are great."
3.0,Pretty dress. Poor quality and fits weird very loose in waist.
3.0,"It's the perfect size,  really secure  clips for the strap or wristlet.  Plenty of room and very functional.  However,  the plastic  smell is so strong I'm not sure if I'll be able to use it.  I'm leaving it to air out for a few weeks,  and I'll update this if it improves. Here's hoping!"
3.0,"brim has permanent wrinkles from being folded, though that does make it nice for storage. I bought it mainly to keep the sun off my neck. I live in the south and my neck is red by birth and don't need no sun to help with that! LOL....  but the top vented portion is soft cloth and has no support and there is no air flow through the mesh because the top is actually sitting on the top of my head and the mesh is down on my head therefore provides no flow of air.<br />So it helps keep the sun out of my eyes, has a piece to cover my face in case I need to be incognito, and strings to adjust the size and keep it from blowing away. Those are about the only decent features. Keep looking."
3.0,"I ordered this in a large, which was just a bit too tight, so I gave it to my son. The style is great, but most other large hats fit my bean."
3.0,If the sizing wasn't so far off I would be in love with these.  These fit WAY SMALL!
3.0,"I have to admit the pants felt very comfortable and it does not feel heavy when you put a few stuff in your pocket. The pants overall are top quality and well worth the money. Though, the pants were small on me that it did not pass my knee. Also, one of the zippers on the side got stuck when it was zipped up and broke off within a few days"
3.0,Reasonable quality for the price
3.0,I always order XL and this fit like a Medium.  The material is more like a button up shirt quality so it’s very light weight. I ended up giving it to a friend.
3.0,"I really like the fabric of this shirt! The pattern is really cute, the colors are vibrant, and it's thick enough that I could probably get away with not wearing a bra. However, I don't like the cut and fit.  I got a size Small. The armholes are strangely small in proportion to the rest of the top--not a big deal, but it feels weird. At the same time, the rest of the shirt is wide and boxy one me. If I sized up, the armholes might fit better but the rest of the top would be way too big, and if I were to size down, the armholes would be awful and the rest might fit a little better but I'm not even confident about that because of how boxy the cut is. I think it would only look good on me if I tuck the top in or if I figure out a way to take in the sides so it isn't so wide. I'm tall and thin and although I don't feel like this suits me, maybe it would fit better on different body types."
3.0,"I ordered the suit in a 50. The seller sent a 46, I thought I ordered the wrong size. I'm glad I ordered it early. I returned the suit and ordered a 50. The seller sent at a 54.<br />The suit is great, for the price, but now I that have to take it to a tailor, the price isn't so great."
3.0,Lots of repeats but it does come with a ton of product to choose from.
3.0,"Super cute, loved it but had to buy a new one cause it fell off in days and was lost😫 will be replacing with a metal backing this time"
3.0,"They are cute, but I don't like the feel of the material of these socks. They are also a little tight and I wear a US 9."
3.0,Looks like the pic but fits to small
3.0,"There's more than one shade of gold so if you're shopping for one color in particular like I was and hoping to get an even mix and that it will work out in your favor, don't hold your breath. I needed the silver and thought I could find use for the rest but they sent me more of the shipment in shades of gold than I should have gotten if there was an even distribution of the 60 pcs"
3.0,Queda apretado en las mangas  en la parte de los codos .soy Delgado igualmente me quedo muy justo  en las mangas  soy talla Small
3.0,I'm a wide size 9 and these socks did NOT fit. Ended up donating them.
3.0,Had issues with the white band getting really dirty pretty quick. The copper clasp also chipped and faded fast. They are cheaply made. But they are very comfortable!
3.0,"This outfit is perfect for summer evening wear. It fits very loose. Unfortunately, the small size i bought shallows me up. I wish they had XS. Most likely,  I will return these. I bought 2."
3.0,"So, I thought this was going to have a vintage wash feel to it, it does not. It looks very new and the printing is kind of thick(???), it doesn’t look vintage or worn at all. I’ll probably keep it and hope the brightness fades after a few washings but it’s not what I was expecting."
3.0,"I am 5'6"" and this item fit very awkwardly. If I tie the neck ribbon so that the collar fits appropriately then the waist band sits too high. Very cute outfit just not a good fit for me."
3.0,"Cute colors but wayyy smaller than I hoped. I intended for my 4yo to be able to wear these over her leggings, but they are too tight."
3.0,"Stones are Not too impressive, but it does describe them as &#34;natural and dyed&#34; which should be a good given.  Need to pay better attention to description and titles."
3.0,I love this! I just wish the sleeves were long enough.
3.0,Too large for me 😔.
3.0,"The tie is OK, but as described by another reviewer the person packing these must have never worn a tie as they fold it up to about a 2 inch bundle creasing the tie. The packaging from Amazon these day is just horrible. Huge boxes for little stuff, bottles of liquid with leaking tops not tightened and ties folded like paper. They really need to get rid of the monkeys and hire humans again to pack these items."
3.0,Sent back because too long.
3.0,"Beautiful necklace, arrived a day early, a gift for my daughter"
3.0,They were different
3.0,"Adorable, high quality dress but it didn’t work for me personally. I felt kind of frumpy in it. It didn’t give any sort of shape and made my chest look weird. I thought it would taper just slightly in at the chest and fall like the pictures. Might repurchase a size down to see if that helps but returning for now.<br /><br />Not a fan of the self tie straps though it adds another cute element. Definitely more of an out and about dress, not one I’d wear on super hot summer days due to the lining.<br /><br />I am 5’9”, 40D and 42” hips got an XL - could’ve gotten a L."
3.0,"Need to order 2 sizes up, just right for me, I did order 2 sizes up."
3.0,"This is 2nd pair I ordered(m)  length is little longer than first one,  So I cut 2” short,  it still looks very cute."
3.0,I thought that the Ferda was stitched in and was disappointed to see it’s a tag sewn on but it fits okay
3.0,"Nice print, size runs about one size bigger than ordinary store department sizes, I got a Medium and it fit like a Large."
3.0,"The actual tanks seemed to match the product information, but it was somewhat less than I imagined or desired. I hoped to wear them with my exercise shorts (outdoors), but they are too thin and short to wear in public, even when jogging. I gave a moderate rating, but could NOT rate higher to my overall disappointment. I wish I had returned them, but since they were consistent with the product information, I felt that returning them was inappropriate. I would NOT purchase them again."
3.0,Nice t-shirt but it's too tight for a large size shirt.<br />Dessapointed!!!!!
3.0,Material is de threading and has pieces of threads breaking just from wearing once
3.0,"This is labeled as a Men's watch, but it is way too small.  My husband, who is not a large man by any means, could not come close to getting this on his wrist.  He thought I ordered a child's watch.  I double-checked, but it definitely said it was a Men's watch.  Unfortunately he demolished the packaging, so it cannot be returned."
3.0,"Bits broke off as soon as I opened it, but I was still able to wear it. It also is just as shiny as the picture."
3.0,"The lace pattern was so small that it looks like a solid gold mask when it is on. I had to cut designs out to get the lace effect I was hoping for. So if you're willing to do the work it'd turn out cute but on it's own, it's just ok."
3.0,The sizes run a size to big
3.0,So this dress is lovely. I'm didsapointed that it took forever to be delivered. The date got changed on the delivery date so I couldn't use the dress for the purpose on why bought it. Regardless it's also very sheer so you need a slip. But it's very pretty and modest. It's runs small. I wear a small or a 4 in all my dresses I'm 5'2&#34; 128lbs workout regularly and the medium fits perfect.
3.0,Cute outfit but ordered the wrong size.
3.0,"Good design, poor material and construct. It's warm and well fitted. However, after a couple of washes, you feel the cheap fleece construct that makes you look cheap."
3.0,"These were huge. I bought them because other reviews said they were small and I was shopping for myself and my kids. But these hang off the face. We still use them if other masks are dirty, but we have to knot the straps. I wouldn’t purchase again because it seems you can’t expect the same sizes."
3.0,"This dress is almost perfect except that the chest is considerable small so I think it would be best for someone who is smaller chested.  The rest of the dress fit perfect.  it is a great material, not see through."
3.0,rhude is overpriced trinomic nubuck so expensive
3.0,"Well made and figure flattering. I little tight around hips, you could size up if you want."
3.0,"The sandals are comfortable, but I don't thing that I have the optimum fit. These seem to run on the large size. I wear men's 7.5 to 8 in casual shoes. The would have opt for the small if I knew better. Btw, this item cannot be returned or exchanged. Be nice if they provided a scaled  silhouette or outline of the foot bed that we could print out."
3.0,Cool hip skinny jeans for a night out in the City.
3.0,nice color and cut. but straight out of the bag it looked like it a had been rolled around in mud. Hope it comes off. I really hate sending things back.
3.0,"The largest cat is a good weight. I'd be somewhat scared to actually bend it to be bigger, I'm worried it would break. The other 2 are very thin. The &#34;sterling silver&#34; coating has bubbles and is very obviously not sterling. I didn't expect they would be genuine for the price I paid. They are cute. The quality is more like something you'd purchase at a Claire's or a similar store. Overall, the large cat is very cute, the other 2 are a little disappointing."
3.0,"This dress was beautiful.  I have no idea if it fit well over all, because the shoulders are extremely small and I could not get it over my head.  The fabric is beautiful. I was so bummed that it didn't work."
3.0,"Material seems a little cheap. Note...you have do be large chested to fill the top of the dress. I'm a 34c, top fit very baggy, even with a padded bra. Will be returning."
3.0,"Read all the reviews and decided a medium would fit, but nope, too small under arms and middle"
3.0,"The watch arrived on time and seemingly is quite sturdy. Overall, it is heavier in weight than I expected, and the bracelet part is aa bit too large for my wrist. I ordered the silver/gold combo, the watch I received is all silver (no gold accents). Not that big a deal and too much trouble to return. Hopefully, it will hold up well for daily wear. So far, so good."
3.0,Loved the dress but it smells so bad it’s giving me a headache. And I can’t walk around smelling like chemicals. Will be returning unfortunately 😪
3.0,"Good enough quality for the price, pretty comfy to wear. The only issue I have with this, is that as a Halloween costume (accessorised with blood) it is too short for a 5'6 person to wear without a short. Unless you want your butt to be totally exposed to the elements. And other people."
3.0,China's clothing sizes are very different than the US sizes. Make sure you are converting to your size. I didn't see anything in the description making that clear but I may have missed it. The bathing suit seemed to be fine other than that.
3.0,The first one I ordered was extremely ill fitting. I ordered another size it was still very unflattering. This one was just a bad design.
3.0,"Does not look or feel durable like a protective case, feels more like a toy."
3.0,"On the one I received, the top hole is centered so that the handle comes out but not retractable handle. Because it stretches, you can stretch it around the retractable handle BUT when you look at the other reviewers’ photos, their hole is towards the back where it’s supposed to be."
3.0,"Ordered a size up to really get that ""baggy"" look but got a more fitted but comfortable fit. Not too upset since it was bought on a flash-sale and will be fine for around the house. Otherwise the construction of the garment seems good. The fabric is nice. Wish the back pockets were real but loving the front pockets. We'll see how it holds up after a few washes before deciding if I would buy another."
3.0,"Super sad that it was to small, even after I read the size chart and reviews to make sure I got the right size! I think its beautiful though!"
3.0,A very nice and simple accent piece. You Dan wear it alone or add a second piece on top. Tangles and slides pretty easy though.
3.0,I really like the fabric but I just looked dumb in them.
3.0,I order m bet it's look like small size
3.0,I did like the thin and cheap material. It's the type of material that can easily snag on anything
3.0,Falls apart after short wear.
3.0,I read the reviews that said the shoes ran small and to order up a size so that is what I did.  I normally wear an 8 and ordered a 9 and they are too big.  Probably a half size up would have been a better idea. The shoes are very cute and I have ordered some sizers to put in the toe to make them fit better.
3.0,It fit as expected but I did not feel sexy at all in it. The fabric was a little itchy and the pattern on the skirt was faded like it had been washed a bunch. The wrap top was not what I expected... it came together at the top of my sternum and made my boobs look small and far apart.
3.0,Was way too small even though I ordered 2 sizes up!
3.0,"It says 100% cotton but feels like spandex. Its way over sized, but still super cute. I haven't washed it yet so I can't attest to how it will hold up."
3.0,They were too big for my fingers and they are really cheaply made.
3.0,"This hip scarf has a nice feel to it. However, the fabric does not work well in motion. During my bellydancing class, it would rub against the fabric of my clothing and slowly slip down. Other dancers used scarves made of polyester and did not have quite the same problem. This scarf might be nice for a costume or event that didn't require so much movement."
3.0,Bracelet was not made for small wrist.
3.0,These earrings do get people talking but I wish the sellers would tell buyers that both the head of the screw and the treads will come unscrewed from the earring post. I did not know this until I took my first earring out and the post some how stayed in my ear. I then had to spend 10 minutes looking on the floor for the post when it fell out. THIS REALLY SHOULD BE IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION! I notice earlier reviewers either thought their earrings broke or had to use glue to fix them. You have to look very close at one of the pictures to see that the black one has the post in the head part and the pink one in the treads. Overall not a bad product.
3.0,"These are very very wide and longer in between hooks than my bra so it's a bit uncomfortable and binds, but it will work in a pinch"
3.0,"Very cute- really like this but it’s a synthetic knit, not cotton"
3.0,"They run insanely small. However, they are soft and the color/print on the fabric looks good. The non-slip grippers on the bottom work well."
3.0,I really like the sweatshirt and it was super soft but it shrinks every time I wash it
3.0,I was hoping that it was more adjustable.  Not quite big enough for my neck.  But I love it and will get it adjusted.  Perfect on packaging and shipping.
3.0,Too expensive. Difficult to see the whole face of the bulldog in most positions.
3.0,Underwhelming
3.0,"I was a bit skeptical about this shirt as I am rather ""busty"", but it fits.  The material is comfortable.  I don't how it washes up yet.  I haven't worn it out in the heat yet.  I hope it works."
3.0,Drive horse and carriage and hat is required. This hat does well as it is cool on hot days. I have to wear my hair up anyways so then the hat fits.
3.0,"3 stars because it arrived with a glue glob stuck to the corner of the wallet that didn't come off. Gave as a gift, so I was not happy that it was slightly defective."
3.0,It was slightly bigger and longer than expected. Kinda make me feel like a grandma so I returned it
3.0,"I liked it, was a cute pin.  However, I pushed it through some thick material and bent the pin.  Other than that, it's what I expected"
3.0,The fit of these pants in the waist/hips is okay but they were way too short! I'm 5'6 and they barely came to my ankles. I know the cropped look is in but these were more like floods. I returned these.
3.0,I love the dress but horrible material
3.0,"There is nothing wrong with these shorts, they just were not what I expected. I am 5’1 150 pounds and the large for good while I was pregnant."
3.0,Dress fits nice but the seams are not lined up properly if you take a close up look.
3.0,It’s hard to tell what they are when you actually have them.
3.0,"These fit okay, but the elastic waistband is uncomfortable.  I prefer a wider waist-band that doesn't cut in uncomfortably.  I'm small, 5'2, 125lbs, ordered the M.  Also, the padding is actually too thick and doesn't line up under my sit bones as I expected it to.  The widest part of the padding should fall under my sit bones while on the the bike, but it falls just inside my sit bones and actually caused hamstring tendon pain.  I'm not wearing them anymore."
3.0,"In some ways this is nice set of sunglasses. It comes in a nice box with its own leather-look snapcase and lens cleaning cloth. However, the plastic of the frame of the glasses is cheap and rather flimsy.<br /><br />The lenses do a good job of preventing eyestrain without dampening the color of your surroundings. I couldn't find any indication in the product description online or the contents of the packaging that tell whether they block harmful UV rays.<br /><br />They are lightweight, so they set comfortably on your face. The hinges seem solid, but they do not flex like some hinges. They did not put pressure on my skull behind the ears, but they did feel a little funky.<br /><br />The style is a little ""old mannish."" Even though they are described as unisex, I don't think they would look good on a woman. Nevertheless at about $18 a pair, they aren't bad to keep as a spare in your glove box in the car or wherever you may happen to need them."
3.0,"Pros:  Well made buckle with positive latch<br />  Customizable length<br />  Holds length adjustment without slipping<br />  Comfortable to wear - Web belt is semi-firm<br />Cons: Buckle will not pass thru the belt loops on most trousers<br />  Must remove half the buckle to put it on, then replace it after lacing it thru belt loops<br />  Webbing belt needs to be thicker and stiffer to be a true ""tactical"" belt<br />  Flexes too much to comfortably hold a firearm in a holster<br /><br />If you are buying this for a belt, you will probably be okay - except for the fact that you must remove the buckle to put it on.  If you want a ""tactical"" belt for wearing a holster, you should consider what firearm you will be carrying.  For lightweight firearms, up to smaller .380 calibers, you will probably be okay.  Full-size models will sag and droop on the thinner, wemi-flexible webbing.  Overall, the quality seems pretty good.  The buckle latch works well with a positive catch and release mechanism."
3.0,"I don’t even know what size I got because the package says XL and there’s no size on the shirt?! I read the reviews and ordered a size up, actually a couple sizes up because I’m 5’5” 125 lbs and normally wear S/M. I like the shirt ok, but it’s sort of shaped like a little boy shirt as it’s short and wide. Not exactly the shape I look for in a shirt, but I think I can make it work. Haven’t washed it yet, but hoping it doesn’t shrink because if the length gets any shorter I definitely won’t be wearing it. The shirt on the model is not what you get at all, that shirt is much longer."
3.0,It wasn't exactly as I thought so I wear it around the house as a sexy cover up.
3.0,These tarnish easily. The rosier colored ones do quickest.
3.0,arrived broken. Had to fix.
3.0,"Colors were off, Teal was more green & Burgundy was more red...those were the two colors I was buying the product for, quite disappointed."
3.0,I ordered the red bow tie with the Mickey face. I got the yellow bow tie with no Mickey face instead. I’m pretty disappointed this isn’t the shirt I ordered at all. It’s really cute but not what we wanted.
3.0,Did not fit as expected have to return it.
3.0,"It's ok for what it is. It is lightweight and breathable, which I like, but it had much more black and was much darker than the photo. I bought as a gift for someone so I won't return, but I wasn't happy with it. Also, the elastic band is one length and the straps were a little long, not sure how that is adjustable like it states."
3.0,"Unless you have stick skinny legs, these will most likely squeeze your legs at the top and create a weird looking bulge of thigh hanging over the top. I am 145lbs and don’t have huge legs by any means, but not pencil thin... and these are so tight at the top that I have to push them down to just over my knee. Otherwise, they are uncomfortably tight and make my legs look like muffin tops."
3.0,Looked good initially.  The black coating on the buckle is peeling off.  so wont be much longer before I can't use it anymore.  Never been dropped on the floor or hit against any hard objects.  So I am not sure why the coating is coming off.
3.0,"They fit my narrow face/head nice, but they are not durrable..but they are priced right"
3.0,"Nice, but there is a scratch on one of the lenses."
3.0,I liked them until a hole popped up on 2 pairs on only a few uses and one wash. They were a perfect fit. I got the large and I am 180 lbs and 5'11&#34; tall.
3.0,"Every year I buy 3 or more pairs of water shoes because most of them give my son blisters or sores. These are the only ones he will wear!<br /><br />Unfortunately after 2 wears, the insole of one shoe came out and got lost at daycare, but he still wears them anyway."
3.0,good quality but expected wider
3.0,"Its okay, I love the design and fabric but its way too small for me.  I would have preferred it a little longer too but I would need to order a 3XL to fit me...I ordered an XL as per the size guide and it was too small still."
3.0,"Quality is not very good, the bracelet broke when it was put on"
3.0,I like the quality a lot. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that I ordered 2 and only got one.
3.0,"The quality of the sewing is less than expected. Where the sleeves fit, the stitches pull apart. In addition, in the illustration, the fabric seems to be somewhat heavier than it is in reality."
3.0,"These are really cute pants, the color is great, the fit is great, however these are not. Breathable!"
3.0,"The shorts are a little big and the top fits perfectly. I ordered one size up. I just got this and haven't worn it swimming but I am a little worried that once the top gets wet, the white part may be see through."
3.0,The cups are very coned shaped....but it is comfortable for around the house.
3.0,It’s made out of a weird material that’s kinda itchy
3.0,The fabric was not of good quality.
3.0,Love lots
3.0,I ordered  two of this item one came broken and the other broke as I was putting on. I was they were made better because the do look nice.
3.0,I like them but as a man they fit to small. The with is to narrow of the lenses. Plus it's to dark. The packaging is really nice. The quality is good so it's g perfect for a teen or a woman that's Slender.
3.0,Very large and heavy
3.0,"The quality and look of the bracelet are stellar.  Unfortunately the chemicals used to finish the leather are too overwhelming for me to be in the same room as the bracelet, much less wear it.  Glad I could help these gifted artisans; wish I could enjoy the bracelet."
3.0,"I measured my glasses to determine which of these to buy.  Yet, the temples are pretty short so they don't really fit the way the description states they will.  The plastic seems pretty brittle - again not how the description reads.  Most importantly, three weeks after I got them, the right lens just popped right out when I opened them up to put them on.  Not the quality I expected."
3.0,"inner knee space for placing foam knee pads is a PLUS++....but, the stitching and exposed internal seam in that area rubbed my knees raw and blistered within 2 days of a shooting school.  Even walking, I could feel the rubbing."
3.0,"I usually wear a size small, but this skirt was too tight in the waist and clung to my rear."
3.0,"Se desprende,  peor si estan hermosas"
3.0,liked the style but to snug in the waist for me.had to return
3.0,Too cheap.
3.0,This set is cute and okay for the price.  The particular set I received didn't have enough black to fill in the features of the girls so it is kind of hard to see the details of the charm.
3.0,"I am 5'5"" and 134lbs, I ordered a small one but it felt too loose and too long. I would've liked it more fitting and flattering."
3.0,"Just received these today, tossed them in the wash and as I was pulling them out of the washing machine I noticed that they started to come unraveled along some of the edges. These are also not made of 100% cotton. They are more like a thicker scarf material and not what I expected in a bandana but that part is on me for not verifying material prior to purchasing. If you don’t mind the edges coming unraveled then this is the product for you. But if you like well made, 100% cotton “typical” bandana then I would suggest looking at other products."
3.0,My main problem is that I am a tall overweight woman. Clothing companies believe if you are overweight you have to be short. The skirt hits above my knee and the slit comes up to mini skirt length which is not business appropriate. I bought this dress for the specific use while hunting for office jobs and then for work. I’m going to take this to my alterations shop and see if we can do something about it.
3.0,"These are good thin socks for sneakers. However, I purchased because I was led to believe they were thicker ankle length socks."
3.0,These earrings are a little big  and too long..
3.0,"This tank is a very light material, great for summer. Runs large that's why I only gave 3 stars"
3.0,"These shoes do indeed look exactly like the pictures, but they run small. The shipping took forever just for an over powering chemical smell, and not the right fit. You get what you pay for"
3.0,"I got these for my 13 yr old daughter and she wears them all the time. I honestly dont think they do a whole lot of what they claim to do, but she seems to think they work. They arent going to hurt her eyes either way and they are cute so over all not a bad purchase."
3.0,I like them but I have to wear them extremely low on my hips in order for them not to be too short. I’m 5ft 7
3.0,"I recently purchased 12 gloves for my daughters' birthday party, to give as favors for a Michael Jackson themed birthday. The gloves came quickly and were of good quality. The kids loved the gloves in their favor bags. I really appreciated that the gloves were made from rhinestones and not sparkly glitter that would flake off everywhere on the children's clothes and in my house. However, the shipping per glove costs almost as much as each glove. I paid almost $60 for the gloves and almost $54 for standard shipping. I almost did not buy this because of the outrageous cost of shipping. In good faith I purchased it, thinking it possible the seller would reduce the shipping costs for this order, so as to not take advantage of the customer. The package arrived in a pre-paid box with the shipper's cost marked as $4.85 to send this to me. I was charged the full $50+ for shipping. It is a good product, but a shameful mark-up on the shipping charge for multiple units. If the seller would offer a discount shipping rate to people buying more than one glove, it would make this product truly a gem of a find."
3.0,Runs quite small so get a size or two up.  But thick and warm under a long sweater or a dress (not to be worn as pants).
3.0,"These are silk, satin would be better."
3.0,It is not what I thought it to be. It is not a marble. It is glass on top of a paper. But it is not very bad for its cost.
3.0,Not as soft as others i have ordered and it came with a stain on it
3.0,These made me itch.
3.0,"The front of the panties do not fit as pictured, they are not tight in the front. The back on the other hand fits amazing."
3.0,Not quite what I was looking for but it will suffice.
3.0,These leggings are not 20-30. They are not as tight as normal compression  pantyhose.
3.0,Hard to pull on need some stretching im a medium large sock i have size 7 foot shoe and I got the xl size and I can't fit them well they're too tight
3.0,"yep, like this one. Sometimes fl gets cold. Perfect.  the three star  is because some threads were unraveled and looked a little weird to my tall guy that can see the top of my head."
3.0,"I like the overall dress. Comfortable, love it has roomy pockets. I just wish they didn’t cut the top so strange! Recommend sizing up one. I have other similar dresses and L fits just fine, even after washing. This L is tight even new."
3.0,"Cute apron, but was advertised that it comes with a chefs hat and it did not.  Reached out to seller to let her know she should change description because it was disappointing.  She never acknowledged the note, making the “miss” now a reason to not buy from them again, where I would have otherwise happily bought again if they would have just acknowledged my note."
3.0,"My wife likes it, however it broke after three days. She did not even go out of our house with it once."
3.0,Just way to tight all over.  Not comfortable.
3.0,Really bulky.
3.0,"I love the pattern on this dress. It's perfect. The fabric is super cheap, like a kids costume.  I'll be handwashing it to extend life<br /> It's thin but not see through. Fits as the chart reads. I went up a size based off bust size."
3.0,Thin see thru
3.0,"These did not &#34;crawl&#34; for me, just slipped down my ear and hung there. Not good earrings for hanging either. Too bad because they are pretty."
3.0,"The skirt is held on only by a belt-like clasp. The ruffles don't meet like in the picture and it leaves some fabric in between that shows. It fits as expected. My daughter is happy with it, but I most likely wouldn't purchase it again because of the quality."
3.0,Quality isn’t that great
3.0,Much bigger than I expected- too large for my tiny 18 year old neighbor
3.0,I really liked this dress but had to return it because the seams were coming apart before I even wore it. I bought it for a wedding and I was not going to take the chance of busting a seam while I danced the night away! I would repurchase down the line if I were in need of a dress.
3.0,they are fine and as advertised however a bit too large (my fault)...otherwise OK and will keep them
3.0,"The sunglasses are very pretty and look just like the Amazon photos, but the lens are very dark indoors and outdoors. Difficult to see through the lenses. Also, the pink lenses' frame bent easily."
3.0,Purchased four sets of these cz studs to use as gifts.  Do not know if the ladies are wearing them
3.0,Was expecting it to be nicer - band is very loose
3.0,"Very nice ring. Unfortunately, it came with a nice sized scratch on it. Are these not checked for quality before being packaged and shipped?"
3.0,Love these for my toms. I have bought several except this last order seems sub par. The toe area has developed a hole and the stretchy elastic part has come undone. This all after barely 2 months of use. Not sure if I would buy again.
3.0,They are not bad they just run a little too small.
3.0,Made small. Fits snug.
3.0,"It looks nice , but fits more like a child . I have a small wrist and it’s to small."
3.0,What can I say? It works.
3.0,"I bounced just as much if not more than my regular bra.  I needed these for jump rope exercises, so they are not going to work."
3.0,"Cute shirt, decent quality, just runs really small. I wear a 8-10 and the XL is too small!"
3.0,The ends of the shows didn't hold up well at all
3.0,I literally just bought this item I thought it was cute because it has a cooler to the bottom but why the zippers jam and the other was off track at this point I’m over it
3.0,I was told by a friend that NoGi made longer shorts lengths than what is normally found but these were not long at all. I am a taller guy and these did not even come to my knees. The material and construction of these shorts felt great but I was hoping for something a bit longer.
3.0,Not what I expected but its doable.
3.0,"I am 5'3&#34;, pear shaped and typically wear a 12-14 on top and a 16 on bottom.<br /><br />The good:  The length was perfect.  I did not have to walk around holding it all day to avoid tripping on it.  If your looking for a floor/ankle length maxi dress and your under 5'5&#34; this is perfect.  Taller than that it may be a bit shorter than your looking for.  The elastic top did not ride up at all it was perfect.  It was not sheer at all, big plus.  The ruffle on top was great, especially if your hiding back chub.<br /><br />The bad:  The slits on the side were way too high.  They hit mid thigh.  I'm 50, not 25 so it was a bit much for me.  So, I sewed it on both sides so it would hit just below my knee and it worked.<br /><br />The really bad:  The material was cheap t-shirt material  Not soft and flowy t-shirt - think more like dollar store t-shirt material.  Because of that the elasticity in the fabric wasn't too good and thus made it fit less flowy than I would have liked it.<br /><br />I kept the dress.  I will hand wash it and it will push me to loose pounds that I could stand to loose."
3.0,"Several options are listed, but incorrect description for the pair I chose. Lenses are not yellow they are blue with a yellow mirror finish on the outside."
3.0,"I love the bathing suite and was exciting to try it on, sadly, I don't think it's meant to accommodate anything larger than a B cup. I am petite at 5'3 and 125. Everything fit great up until my D's. Had to return it."
3.0,"The material is nice and the legs are cute. The waist elastic seems tighter than it needs to be and thin. I just don’t like the feel, it cold have been executed better. Also, the super high waist takes some getting use to, if you don’t wear all your clothes that high. Finally, I feel like it is going to be difficult to find flattering tops to go with them."
3.0,"Yeah, they are cheap and really small.  I really wish they were well made because they have one feature that I was looking for - NO elastic in the waist.  Unfortunately my fat ass already starting pushing out the seams on the these in the first few workouts.  Not sure how they would do in the wash - I think they are going into the trash before they get the first wash. FYI: I'm about 5'8 and have a 33&#34; waist sort of muscular build - I got the XXL.  Fine around the waist - not so much around the back side when bending or squatting."
3.0,I ordered this shawl for my birthday. The picture on here definitely makes it look more burgundy. I should have believed them when they said it was a rust color instead of going by the picture. I am a bit disappointed with the colors but it still looks like a nice shawl and I am sure the colors will work well in the fall. -Crystal Henry
3.0,Waist band sucks...after first wash wont stay up
3.0,"Decent, not very warm."
3.0,"A decent shoe - for an offshore, noncompliant (no size/material tag, just the Chinese size 34, who knows what it's made of) utterly invisible brand. I expected at least the same info as any shoe you buy @ brick-&-mortar store. You can do better elsewhere..."
3.0,"This dress is really cute. it fit a little more snug than it shows in the photo, so I would order a size or 2 larger. This dress is thin, but what can you really expect for the price?"
3.0,Pretty thin. I don't expect them to last long. I just wear them around the house.
3.0,"The listing says linen but they are in fact cotton. They aren’t bad for cotton pants but they just aren’t linen. All that being said- in 5’1” & US size 12 , the large fit nicely but the elastic waistband is (as others have said) very tight. They do fit but give major muffin top!! On my height (5’1”) they are to my ankles. The pockets are generous and the fabric is soft it’s just that elastic waistband that makes them uncomfortable:(  They are a mid rise (below bellybutton) pant."
3.0,"Cute shoe, but the straps are so tight that I felt like there was a vice grip on my feet.  I walked in my house for about 5 minutes and knew they had to go back.  I wear a size 7-7.5 and I bought the 38 which is usually perfect for me--not this time. My foot is pretty normal too... not wide or anything."
3.0,"This is a very casual polyester feeling dress.  Not very fitted, bright colors with pockets.  I like it for playing with the kids and hanging around the house.  Comfortable but not cool fabric for the Texas heat.  I bought XL and it fits loose on my 5'8"", 195 lbs frame.  Probably won't purchase another color as I prefer something a bit more form fitting, more flattering for leaving the house."
3.0,"I followed advice from other reviewers and this fit fine - I’m larger busted and many tops are too tight in chest or too loose thru bodice.  This had room thru chest, and somewhat fitted through waist, and was modest, not  a lot of cleavage showing.<br />But the color was just ok, and the patten was badly - very noticeably - mismatched between front and back sections making it look very cheap.  I returned."
3.0,"This is a really pretty bracelet. I really like the look and weight of it. It fits my wrist very nicely. It arrived on time and was well packaged. I had no issues with the seller.<br /><br />The only negative? When I took it out of the package, one of the stones popped out. I'm sure I can repair it with superglue, but that certainly is disappointing. I doubt this is a common occurrence, but that is why I gave this 3 stars. I'd probably give 4 or 5 if that did not occur.<br /><br />Note: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Positive reviews are not relative to the discounted rate paid, but rather to the quality of the product and the quality of the service received."
3.0,"We measured my sons foot and when the shoe came in, it was way too big. We measured again, looked at the size cart and according to his measurements and the size cart, we ordered the right size. We returned them and ordered a size smaller and they’re still too big. We decided to keep these with the hopes that he’ll be able to fit into them next summer."
3.0,the middle metal silver section looks cheap and serves no purpose
3.0,This onesie is well made and comfy but def not true to size my boyfriend loves it though.
3.0,"For the B3598-white shirt, I followed the reviews and ordered up a size to XXL (I normally wear a US XL) but it was big in the body and the arms were both blousy and way too long. I’m not sure an XL will work if it’s also going to be that blousy in the arms."
3.0,This is a lookalike crocs shoe.  Not even close to the original's quality.  But is cheaper as well.  May be use it for basement or something.
3.0,"I read that these were fitting people a little tight, but I don't have big feet and always have a ton of room with all my shoes. So I bought my regular size I always buy and they fit just perfect. So they do run on the smaller end and they fit very tight on me. There're not comfortable at all either as I thought because I have a high arch as the shoes does. Also the side of my food with my little toe really hurts. I only use these for showers at public places so I can live with them. They seem like they will last a very long time and won't break apart like all the cheap kind I wasted so much money on before. They also have great traction and I don't slip around anymore. Quality and traction are the best part of these shoes. Not bad for SHORT periods of use like showers. They also are cheaper than other brand names but exact same shoes I found here on Amazon"
3.0,The sleeves were too long had to get them adjusted
3.0,They were a little tight
3.0,Its hard to order a size on line but you take a chance . Sometimes your right and sometimes your wrong 50_- 50 chance!!!!!
3.0,"The hat came folded up and had a mangled shape. It needed to be steamed back in shape, but I don’t have a steamer. I placed damp clothes on the hat and kept trying to reshape it. I wore the hat, although it still had folds or creases that I couldn’t get out."
3.0,"Just did not like this.  Photos look cute but on....just frumpy looking, shapeless and boxy.  Liked the light weight of the material.  However pattern and shape just did nothing for me.<br /><br />I usually wear a Medium or a Large.  I do not think a Medium would help so I am returning it."
3.0,"Little snug in the tummy area, bit otherwise fits good"
3.0,"The shirt is nice but it runs large, size down. Also its very thin."
3.0,I like it but it's an extremely fragile material and I didn't think it would withstand much use unfortunately
3.0,It would have been awsome I bought them for the one dragon ring to match a necklace and it broke on my hand when I put it on and I didnt even adjust it yet it was the right size got my finger. It was super cheep so for the price so not horable. The other rings seem to be ok so far it's only been a half hour but I thing they will be fine I think the dragon ring was week from the start cuz of the spines on the dragons back.
3.0,I have thick legs so these don't work so well for me...
3.0,"The design of this top is really pretty. That being said, there were a few things I wasn't too excited about: tons of loose threads (fixable, but I don't feel like putting in the effort, honestly) and the color of the string that ties at the neck. It's an awkward yellow that doesn't really match the rest of the shirt. I can probably just find a different string somewhere and switch it out if I feel the desire to.<br /><br />I'm not exactly busty, not exactly small chested either, and this kind of makes the fit a little awkward looking from the side. Unflattering side-boob. I feel that if I went a size bigger then it would be too big around my waist area. I'm 5'2 and weigh around 150-160. Overall, the shirt is just okay and I will be keeping it."
3.0,"Material is thick, but not very soft. Cute style, but size up if you want a looser fit"
3.0,"Does not fit you anything like in the picture. The arm hole is no where near that large!! Wearing it you just show off some of your bra/side boob. It's not a bad buy though, the material is nice and stretchy. It just does not fit anything like in the picture with the model."
3.0,"The texture of the dress is amazing, material perfect but it fit too big. May be my fault I ordered an extra large. Should’ve gotten medium"
3.0,"The actual shorts are MUCH lighter than the picture displays. Otherwise, stretchy and pretty comfortable."
3.0,"I plan to use this lanyard to keep my mask handy and clean, when working or in public, at times when mask wearing is not required. I don't like carrying the mask in my pocket, or putting it down on a table - etc."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this, but the sizing is really off.  I'm a size 8 / 34F, and medium tops are usually very fitted/tight on me.  I put this on, and it was huge.  Returning it and ordering a small...hopefully that'll fit."
3.0,"Colors were great and the material was soft, but I couldn't keep it on. I do have a small wrist but it would just fall off my hand. They need to make a smaller size! I had to cut out over an inch and tape it back together. It fits now, it's loose enough to be comfortable and still slides up & down a bit. Not sure how good the tape will hold but couldn't think of another way to hold it together."
3.0,"The pants are great!, but, you should know, they are HUMUNGOUS!!!  I have never seen a 14/16 this big before.  They are closer to a boys 18.<br />My son is a perfect 14, so he will be in college before these fit."
3.0,"I like the nice assortment,but you get what you pay for.  I did have to fix a couple of them and the magnets do not screw together for security but seem to work okay."
3.0,These flops look cool but they weirdly turn sideways when I'm walking. They don't stay straight on my foot for some reason.
3.0,"Very loose,have to tighten every few minutes"
3.0,Everyone loves this jacket on me.. It's warm although it doesn't close.. My only issue was it came with a huge hole in the pocket and all my things were floating in the inner bottom of the jacket. It would have gotten a 5 plus stars if it wasn't for the hole.
3.0,"I ordered a 3t because my girls were in 2t and I wanted them to have something to grow into. They are smaller than all of the 2t panties we have already. They have great coverage, but my girls can wear them now, not in the future as I had hoped."
3.0,"I like these, they are cute and they feel super nice. The only issue is that on my second time wearing them, they ripped by the inside seam on lower thigh (a little above the knee) opened up. Both times I wore the leggings, I did not do much activity (I wore them to class) and I was basically sitting down, so I do not know if the rip was already there and I did not notice, or it the material is that cheap. I know it is not a size issue but I am rather petite and there is still a ton of stretch in them when I wear them. I do recommend these, but watch out for any rips along the seams. I wish I checked earlier."
3.0,"Too much glue and a visible and hole at the back of the pearl. After I talked to them, they nicely sent me a new one. However, the new one had more glue so I returned the new one and kept the first one instead. The pearl looks nice and reasonable price. Both of them looks gorgeous from the front but not from the back."
3.0,"The material looks different in the picture than it does when it actually arrived. Plus, I could have went down a size. It’s too big for me. I never wore it. May give it to someone who is bigger than me."
3.0,Wife liked them as allowed here to match to various outfits. Inexpensive yet not cheap fashion ware.  Great for kids gifts.
3.0,cool loking but crooked. ill see if i can bend them without breaking.
3.0,Great but the product does not fit well on your ear.
3.0,Dress is very dearing just runs small
3.0,"My four-year-old daughter is is going to love these!! They are a Christmas present so I am unsure about the fit, but they are soft and look just as pictured.<br />Update: I was sent the wrong size. Way too big!"
3.0,"I liked it,not as red as it looked in picture,its more pink in person but fits well. I really like it"
3.0,It's wide enough. The length is okay but would prefer a little longer.<br />I'm 5' 2&#34; and 130 lbs. and if i was any bigger I would not use it due to the length.
3.0,The color looks good but feels and looks cheap. Returned.
3.0,It was too small is not right for men's
3.0,im 150lb. get the smallest one they have if you want to give it a try.
3.0,"You cannot tell the difference between the gold and the rose gold. Also, they are pretty scratched up and a few of them have a spatter looking finish on them. The photo on the listing makes the blanks look very smooth. I will not be buying this product again."
3.0,It did not fit as expected. It was a prime item except for the one size so they would free return it and didn’t even try to help or accommodate. Not happy.
3.0,the material
3.0,"I like the color and the amount of storage. However, it wears easily."
3.0,Color of pink seemed weak. Nice chain. Came fast.
3.0,Very nice LOOKING....a bit thin. But I’ve worn it and it looks nice
3.0,"These cheap automatics are a bit of a crapshoot. Sometimes you get a decent one and sometimes you get one with issues. This watch is quite sharp looking but the date quick-set did not work. Thus, I returned it. As long as you are aware that you are more likely to get a lemon with these, they are worth a shot given that they are so inexpensive and you can always return them. When you do get a good one, they really aren't too bad."
3.0,"these are very heavy and obviously of good quality, they look beautiful....BUT I've been at 3/4&#34; for like 2 years now and I cannot even slightly fit these in my lobes. When I compare them to my other plugs they're like several mm wider...I have yet to measure them so I don't know for sure what the actual size is...."
3.0,Beautiful shirt bit it runs very big. Had to return it.
3.0,Too small for people with large face and head.
3.0,"Not an everyday watch. Wood face is finished nicely, but hour markings are cheap and applied in an average manner. Movement  and complications are as expected for this price point, simple. Crystal is fair. Wood bezel is spottily finished. Watch weight is average for a larger watch (44+mm), comfortable to wear. Band is quality in finish, comfort and weight. Clasp locks firmly when band is fitted. Crown and bezel shield surrounding are strong. Would like to rate higher but the limited occasions you will be able to wear this watch reduce its utility and ultimately its everyday value."
3.0,"Wicks moisture well and is comfortable. Does not stay down around hips as much as I hoped during yoga class, so I can’t wear them as my only shirt. I’m using the as a base layer now and tucking into my leggings. They’re great for this purpose, but I was hoping to ditch the second shirt."
3.0,They were way too big. Nothing is wrong with them
3.0,"100% polyester.  So not great to sleep in unless you are freezing.  Fabric is pretty enough, as is style, but it doesn’t breathe so it’s really hot and it doesn’t yield.  Fits good, although I wish I’d ordered 1 size up for a better lounging fit."
3.0,"Fit is okay, a little better than most amazon jerseys, but still nothing like a $100 brand name jersey. Seems alright for casual rides. Not for rides where you care about performance."
3.0,Looked nicer on the pic
3.0,"Only giving this three stars because while cute earrings, the leather is not adhered well together and has been seaparating since the earrings arrived."
3.0,I will keep this because it's so  cute.
3.0,I thought it would be a little smaller
3.0,"The quality of the gloves are decent for the price I paid. $9 and some change but they’re on the small side. I ordered a size large based on the reviews and I have pretty slender hand, but long fingers. Ring finger size 5. I should’ve ordered extra large. The thumb area fits a little strange also and is a lot longer.  Maybe a little off center. If your fingers are short, these are going to be long. Hopefully since they’re 100% leather and spandex they’ll stretch with a little wear. They also came in a nice gift box."
3.0,"For reasons I prefer not to detail here, I can no longer wear any sort of pants with a waist or belt, etc.--has to be elastic or drawstring waist and soft so as not to interfere with medical equipment. I was hoping these would be a good choice, looking almost like chinos or khakis (not like sweat pants), but the waist on these is not ideal for me.  The waist band is extremely (and needlessly and excessively in my view) wide and thus, unfortunately, these are not a great fit for my needs. I have lighter weight versions of a similar product (mostly linen and thus not great for Michigan winters) with little to no waist (just enough to hold a drawstring); these offer a great option for me in warm weather. This heavier weight product, however, comes with a wide, bulky waist that impinges on the medical equipment.  I thought about returning them but instead will wash them many times to soften them and use them only sparingly, a couple hours at a time when sweats will not do.  I wish someone made a product of this weight but with a very narrow drawstring waist."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. At $10, I had visions of waiting for the other dresses to go on sale and snatch each up. But the dress, even though I ordered my size and it fit well, was odd. First, the fabric was cheap and shiny. Second, the tie for the dress (it ties in back) looked beautiful from the back and just sat weird in the front.<br /><br />For reference, I wear a size 4/34B normally, with a 27 1/2 inch waist and 38 inch hips. I am 5'7&#34;, and the dress hits right at the knees. I ordered a SMALL and it fit very well.<br /><br />Again, the fabric appeared to be cheap, although the print was really very cute, and the tie was not flattering in the front. I can't recommend it to anyone; I will say I ordered two SMALL dresses at the same time from Grace Karin. At $20-30, it's more of a commitment, but I would suggest that company to anyone."
3.0,For the price it was thinly made and the red M F was faded at the bottom<br />Disappointed
3.0,If you wear a small get a medium. Majority of these didn't fit well except one.
3.0,"Shirts run small and pants true, would give 5 stars except the 2t shirt is more like an 12 or 18 month size."
3.0,I got this to wear under my halloween costume and i ordered a large and i just didnt like the band it was thick and noticeable but it did do its job and it gave me a coke bottle shape so it isnt the best but for the price works.
3.0,"Pretty decent shirt, but the sides are weird. It's not like a normal shirt, it's like a stiffer material going down the side and doesn't really form to my body"
3.0,"Small, but cute."
3.0,The 2 piece tops fit great but the pants are so tight she can hardly get them on and can't bend her legs when she does. Very disappointed. And she is a very skinny 6 year old.
3.0,runs a bit small  had an 'extension with it that is right now 'unfindable'
3.0,"I bought the large based on other reviews (I'm 5'2&#34;, 140lbs, 32FF). The top was a little too open, and the back hem of the dress was too long. I'd have to wear heels with it or try to rock a train. The color and pattern was nice though. I returned it."
3.0,"These masks are nice but unfortunately the elastic around the ears are not long enough and they do not hold the masks firmly in place, tend to come off."
3.0,"I bought this for it's looks and it is a very cute hat, unfortunately the wind blows right through it. Fashion hat only."
3.0,"The material is very thin, and it was a bit tight in the arms. Size runs smaller."
3.0,Works great but ring size is not accurate! a women's 6-7 barely fits the large. The small would only ever fit a child.<br /><br />Compared to the cloth ones I like that this is clear so you can still see your ring but because I needed two I ended up having to order twice to get two larges and just throwing away the other sizes.
3.0,Fabric is soft and well made but is smaller than expected. Make sure to buy a size up.
3.0,These are very comfortable however I don't feel like they functioned as a true compression sock. I'm an RN and I work 12hr on my feet at a time so good compression socks are a must. I think I would downsize and they would work better. I have used the knee high socks in the same size that I bought these from this brand before and had no complaints. Otherwise they are a comfortable sock to wear!
3.0,"Fits well, but start peeling off after a while."
3.0,Not bad but they are not tagless. There is a tag on the inside of the left hip and it's annoying.
3.0,"Love the colors of this bag but found it smaller than what I anticipated and I used the posted measurements to compare it to the bag I was using to be sure this one would give me more room.. Then when I got this and actually measured this bag I found out why I was disappointed.... the bag was at least an inch smaller all the way around than the posted measurements said it would be. And given the fact that there was a zipper compartment down the middle to steal more of the internal space it was smaller than what I needed so gave it away.  Maybe I just got one that didn't &#34;measure&#34; up but given that I had ordered 2 at the same time and they were both too small I think the posted measurements were simply wrong. Or I got defective bags. Sad... I loved the style and colors.... But not the size. Plus.... they were packaged in a way that they were wrinkled, misshapen, and the bottom stiffening insert was difficult to get back in place where it belonged. Just very disappointed."
3.0,I have been wearing Wright Socks for over 12 years and this pair for whatever reason are not keeping my feet dry. They will not be used for running as intended.
3.0,Fits well but very see through got navy!
3.0,"Well made safety vest, but runs very small in size. It is not Unisex, the size is more like a woman’s. If you need it to fit over a winter coat,!order a couple sizes up."
3.0,Cute but animals fall off with washing.
3.0,Cute but need to wear a slip under it
3.0,They look great but much too thin for my baby's feet. He hated wearing them. Robeez are best if you don't mind paying a bit more.
3.0,Buy a sz bigger if you want this to be longer to maybe wear with leggings.<br />It’s a nice shirt but not what I was hoping for.
3.0,"I bought the black pair with the logo of the weight after purchasing the red pair and loving them. Description says 5” shorts for both, however the black seems longer, more like 8”. They’re comfy and made well, but not what i want for the gym! 5 star for the red 2 star for the black (just based on description)."
3.0,"The pendent was beautiful, but the chain was cheap, it broken upon putting it on"
3.0,"Like many of the reviewers noted, one side is longer than the other.  I only wear this around the house or out running errands so it really doesnt matter much to me.  I would only recommend this item if you do not mind having it uneven."
3.0,Silver playing or coloring wore of after a few days. But for the price it's decent
3.0,"We ordered a XL for our son who is a large, and it didn’t fit. Returned for a 3X. Still fit a little snug, so you will have to wear it over a tee shirt. Also the warming jacket only works on the front or the back. Not both at the same time."
3.0,"I like the prices, but dislike the thickness of the product."
3.0,Color is not accurate
3.0,"Cute dress. Fairly tight in the top of you have larger bust. Very see through in the back, which is a bummer. I’m 5’5 and the length is just below the knee."
3.0,"I bought a size 10, my foot size but they were very tight. However my wife tried them and liked them so I gave them to her! Just remember their<br />sizing runs smaller than stated. Construction wise they look good and the soles are suited to our foothills environment in dry weather.<br />Wife likes the nice flannel lining.<br />Would reorder in next size up, but the product is no longer available! C'est la Vie!"
3.0,i purchased this top because i really needed a white top and this one look cute and flowy. After reading the reviews it said the to p came a little large so i ordered a small (i m usually a medium). First of all the shirt looks cheap the top part fits good but the stomach area is to tide so its not so flowy. I was going to wear it with a cute necklace but the shirt looks cheap so it really didnt look right. Its an k shirt for the price but i wouldnt order it again.
3.0,It fit with just a light sweater but in 45° weather I had to wear an undershirt because the coat was not warm enough.  Too tight with a heavy sweater.  It looked nice just not practical for winter in California.
3.0,"This dress is pretty much exactly as described. I'm 5'4"" 160 lbs and got a large. It fits perfectly, though you may want a belt if you want it to be a bit more flattering to your figure. It is forgiving of my larger hips and behind. The material is very light and it was so comfortable when I put it on. The problem came when I sat in a hot car. The material DOES NOT breathe and my back got all sweaty. I was very uncomfortable. Luckily I didn't have a wet spot when I got out. It'll be fine for milder weather, but I don't recommend it for hot areas. I had also ordered the yellow but will return it when it arrives."
3.0,This is not as cute in person but it fit as expected. It had a very strong smell so it will require a few washes to get rid of it. If the quality is very mediocre in the stitching is not best so probably not last too long.
3.0,The necklace is very nice but earings agitate my ear. Definitely worth buying for the necklace.
3.0,"Cute hat, but packaging was not so great. The feathers were torn when the hat arrived. Other than that, the headband was good and the hat stays in place."
3.0,My daughter is 9 and these were too small for her face. These are for little kids not even youth.
3.0,"I thought the fabric would be like a sweat pant but was not.  Much thicker than fleece, very very warm.  It will keep you toasty."
3.0,It does not fit as the picture shows.
3.0,Fits too tight. I was not pleased with the fit of this hat. It had a very snug and tight fit when I pulled it over my hair up I a bun. It did not stretch over my head too well.  I’m keeping it because I like the AKA screen print and I can wear it with my hair down.  Okay if you have a mall head and short hair.
3.0,"I ordered a size 13, and the wrong size was sent.  Actually, the bottom of the shoe had a different size, the inside had a different size, and the tags had a different size.  I exchanged for the original size I requested and it came in right the second time.  I purchased the boots to be part of my daughter’s Evie costume, and I think she will wear them all winter long.  They are a little thin, as to be expected for the price.  The glitter seems stuck on pretty well, I don’t anticipate much falling off unless my daughter tries to get it off."
3.0,I typically wear an XL in shirts so that they fit more flowy on me. The fit guide said true to size and amazon suggested I wear my normal size. I went ahead and sized up to an XXL and it is way too small. It fit more like a large. It was super pretty and shiney though!
3.0,"These are nice looking & outer soles look durable, time will tell. Inside foot-bed is not as comfy as we thought they would be, but not bad for $20 house shoes I ordered for my son. They run small so I would recommend ordering a size up! We re-ordered in 1 size larger."
3.0,The dress was pretty shear.
3.0,Somewhat small.  Recommend ordering a size up if in doubt.
3.0,"ITS OKAY NOT SO HAPPY ABOUT THE QUALITY AND THE WORST WAS WAS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE SHIPPING TAKES, ITS CRAZY."
3.0,Feels so comfy but apparently I am too busty for the top part of the dress so it stretches very noticeably.  I wear a scarf when I wear the dress so that it is not obvious to others.
3.0,"Everywhere I buy workout clothing I wear a medium in leggings. So I bought a medium and these were too tight, however the style is super cute, and I love the pocket"
3.0,"For quality it is virtually indistinguishable from the name brand product.  Size, however, is way off.  Could barely get my hand thorugh the loop and the buckle sits at the bottom of my 7.25"" wrist.  Would work if your wrist is smaller, but for larger folks pass this one by."
3.0,Ships from ASIA for starters so it took almost 3 weeks to arrive which is not mention in the description at all... Also the tip cap falls off very easily
3.0,Cute shoes sadly had to return ....they run really wide .
3.0,Thin material. Cuffs are really loose.
3.0,Smaller than stated
3.0,Love the price but after a few times in the water the flag has disappeared but the writing is half there
3.0,Didn't fit right. Material very thin.
3.0,Really like the skirt. Really didn’t like the awkward fitting top
3.0,"not what i expected..crown was jammed, feels ok wearing it... u get what u paid for..."
3.0,I loved it but it was too big for my wrist the smallest holes were not small enough
3.0,I absolutely LOVE this corset but it runs big and it's made for a long torso which I do not have. The quality of this corset is amazing. Just wish it would have worked with my body.
3.0,Lovely spacious concept however the zipper eventually becomes a issue . Used this for vacation and zipper refused to open after several attempts . Eventually I was able to open it and had to leave it completely exposed my entire trip to avoid the hassle
3.0,The sleeves were nothing like the picture they were very tight up to the elbow and the color looked very Navy instead of black had to return.
3.0,I love the color and material. It’s not the most supportive bra and I’d order a cup size bigger than you regurally are.
3.0,Comfortable fabric but could use a little more length to the straps. The bra wants to ride up over the nips.
3.0,calidad regular
3.0,It was like i thought it would look
3.0,somewhat small and a bit thin
3.0,"It's very weirdly proportioned.  I wear a small in tops and this as tight on my shoulders but wide everywhere else. If you are a size 2-4 in dresses, this will not fit you well. It is also very thin -- perfect for summer but no other time. You will be able to see everything underneath it, so keep that in mind. true to color."
3.0,"Im usually a size M, so I ordered this top in a Large because of asian sizing. However, the large was much too big and baggy, I would have been fine with a Medium/Small. The quality was not great at all, but I was going to use it for a costume so it would have done the trick. This would be a cute top to wear a few times, but I can't seeing it lasting very long through wears and washes."
3.0,"I would have loved to have been able to wear this ring, however the sizing was a bit smaller than expected (even if following the product recommendations). Additionally I was really looking forward to the lilac purple band and when it came the color is a bit more pink than purple."
3.0,Bottom fit perfect top won't fit at all
3.0,"I love this, but my gown came with tiny holes in the front by the pleats. :("
3.0,"I would not call this a muscle tee. It is just cut strangely. Other muscle tees I have are snug in the biceps. That is the point, after all. They’re also supposed to be nice and snug in the chest, tapered in the mid section, and not too long. This shirt is really none of those things. The sleeves have “wings”. My arms aren’t huge, but they aren’t tiny either. The shirt doesn’t appear to have a taper at all. It just “hangs” and the length is just too long.  I like the color contrast, the raglan sleeve (which is usually very flattering) and the quality of the fabric. But I won’t be wearing this shirt. It just doesn’t look or feel flattering."
3.0,I got a medium floral orange - love the color and the pattern. The material seemed more polyester than cotton and it was a smaller fit than expected. I thought the hip area was looser in the picture more like a swing dress but it only had a slight flair.
3.0,"I received a free sample of this product for testing and review.<br /><br />The wallet looks great, but I remain skeptical about the staying power of the magnet on the clip side of the wallet. I also worry about its implications for the magnetic strips in credit cards. These are just hunches, not founded on any real experience (my cards still worked after a day of use and they never fell out of my wallet), but I think there are better options available on Amazon."
3.0,Weird gap bunch in the front of the pants they were also very short
3.0,OK wasn’t as great as they made it sound away
3.0,Fits well color was more orange red
3.0,This is not sweater fabric of any kind. It is sort of a waffle (like long underwear) type material.
3.0,size down
3.0,too wide! my head is to small for it:(
3.0,The dress was nice but more casual than I expected. I also have a very large bust so the top did not fit as expected. I am returning this item.
3.0,"I don't usually purchase a lot of items with color.  A bit out of the box for me but somewhat stylish.  About 3-4 inches too long, and a tad see through.  I've had this dress since May, and its already unraveling under one sleeve."
3.0,The sweater looks great but has a really strange smell. I've had it laundered and dry cleaned but it still smells. I'm hoping it gets better because I would love to be able to wear it!
3.0,The style is great.  Just what I was looking for but the lenses were not so great.
3.0,Not enough stretch for me but I love the dress
3.0,A pair broke the second time I wore them. I can easily fix it with super glue.<br /><br />I have received lots of compliments whenever I wear them.
3.0,Came super quick. Not the best quality in the world but for the price I really can’t complain. Color is a little more blue ish but still very cute.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:d3ffcf4c5bfcaff405928a7b3d166dc3]] This bracelet is on the small side. I have slim wrists and on the last link the bracelet sat where I’d like it to. If I used any link further up it would be too tight. If you have slim wrists or are getting this for a child it will work, if not, it will likely be too small."
3.0,"Though I ordered Medium, thinking the dress should be full, it's too large. I do like the fabric and color and will wear it though I shall feel as if I'm encased in a large bag."
3.0,The torso too long and not enough support.
3.0,"They run a little small - especially in the front area but that is all forgivable. Unfortunately, the tag on the inner side of the underwear (that says the size) is very irritating.  I cut it out on two of the pairs and what remains still irritates me quite a bit.  I have started wearing them inside out to compensate for it .  (Yes, it bothers me that much.)  This works just fine and it's not as weird as you think because there are no markings on them.  Wanted to let you know."
3.0,"Very cheap-looking. I purchased it as a gift, but I will look for something else."
3.0,"I ordered this assortment specifically because the listing photos show four different patterns of colorful joyous socks. The assortment I received contains a pair of boring black socks. Beware, you are buying three pairs of good socks and one pair that you’ll have to give to someone with no imagination."
3.0,I have purchased a higher quality butterfly brooch for less money this brooch is nice however I think it is overpriced
3.0,Not the greatest materials but good belt
3.0,"Arrived in 2 days. Cheap material, but will do the job intended!"
3.0,"It stretches your ear hole bigger than the average earring so it hurts to wear. Plus you cant slid the earring backing on the post because the part that secures the earring in the back wont go over the plastic cover, the hole on the backing isnt big enough. So it doesn't work and was a waste of money. I had hoped this would be the cure but it's not."
3.0,"although these are pretty, the stone in the picture looks like a clear stone but the one I received is a more of a swirl of dark blue purple pink. And the small round stone looks is a dark clear purple.,  For the $ these are still cute.  Light weight earrings."
3.0,It's beautiful it was a bit snug tho
3.0,"Not exceptionally warm, pretty typical gloves."
3.0,"These are all bent somewhat differently and some don't seem to fit my deep nose hole. They're cute and a great deal, but if they don't work for your piercing, the deal isn't as good. I may have a weird nose, who knows!"
3.0,"It fit, Was not to fund of the material...."
3.0,Too small and I bought a size large so I gave it to my daughter.
3.0,"not what I was expecting, but for the price they fit great except the legs are big."
3.0,"While these are sparkly and pretty, the posts are very long and poke you behind your ears, which is why I only gave them 3 stars."
3.0,Three stars because it it super thin but cute.
3.0,Not too practical
3.0,Runs big. Kind of bulky unsteady of curvy like in picture. Do not like fit.
3.0,Wand and halo were great. The wings on the other hand was feathers glued onto 2 pieces of cardboard held together by hot glue. It held up for what I needed it too. Don’t know how much longer it will hold up.
3.0,These run small and ride up for curvy women. I use them under exercise clothing and they mostly serve their function.
3.0,it's ok. haven't used it in the sea yet but I swim in a pool every week. gets foggy a little bit and it gets harder to see. else than that does it job
3.0,Runs way too big even for something that’s supposed to fit large.
3.0,"I was so excited when I found this suit and at such a great price! However, after receiving and trying it on, it was too small. Im only 5'3 and 90 lbs , so if a small was too small on me than it must run VERY small. Its definitely for someone very petite and with a short torso. Im sending back."
3.0,Got the large and they are too tight.  Decent glove with a swede palm and fingers.  The back is a tight mesh.  These have no insulating value at all.  Anything under 50 degrees and your hands will get cold with these gloves.  Not what I am looking for.
3.0,The fit is good but it is cut very square The color is nice and dark and the fabric is evenly sewn. This is a thinner sweater I don't love the cut but the overall quality is good.
3.0,The ad said youth/adult. But these don't fit our 8yr old who plays soccer. They were even too big for me (adult female size 6 shoe). My fiance had to wear them in the end.
3.0,"The lenses are not as purple as the picture, they are mostly blue."
3.0,I didn't like the fact it took so long to arrive!
3.0,"so the product given on SHAIN is much cheaper, on the packaging it was written Shain, I thought it had better quality but it is a very thin material"
3.0,Super cute bag. Spacious. Handle fell of first day wearing it.
3.0,"Beautiful dress but the sizing was very wrong. If I had the option, I would have chosen &#34;Way Too Small&#34;. I didn't bother ordering a size up since I could tell no matter what size I ordered, it would be off. Length was good, sleeve length was good, shoulders were narrow, torso area was extremely tight (I think on purpose?). It's a shame, but you can't win them all."
3.0,INSTRUCTIONS WERE HARD TO READ AND UNDERSTAND
3.0,"Great for a tall person, but for a petite, it is way too long. Not bad for the price though. I can tie the ends together for a different look."
3.0,"It's not as display shown,there's no elastic gathering at the end of the feet and shoulder to waist is really short and it sad capri,, well it's really ankle length..overall nice material and love the style ..wish it did fit me well though.."
3.0,3 of them were broken when received otherwise my son likes them.
3.0,Lines in fabric seams show through fitted clothing.
3.0,"I was hoping it'd be a little thicker material. It's pretty thin, good if you're looking for a light sweatshirt."
3.0,I wear a size 8 in most pants but I have a belly from having 2 babies.  I got a large but the top band is tight and the high waisted panel looks janky after I washed them.  The legs roll up but that could be because I need a size medium in the legs.
3.0,"It's a really nice jacket, however the buttons were not attached very well. Barley hanging on. Had to take it and get the buttons fixed."
3.0,"feels cheap and looks cheap, but so far is okay"
3.0,"Beautiful to look at, but a stone fell out after wearing half a dozen time. Have to put them aside now."
3.0,Link it but too small
3.0,Product did not look like picture. Material is cheap
3.0,"VERY PRETTY and unique. I got a lot of compliments, but the size is too large. I usually wear a 6.5 and ordered a size 6. Even with thick socks, it's kind of uncomfortable to walk around it. And it's mainly because of the ankle part; it is very wide."
3.0,It was very thin material and seemed too oversized. I would recommend ordering a size down. The color and design is pretty to wear on Halloween but the thin material would require a cami underneath unless you don’t mind a see-through top.
3.0,The quality is cheap it could be better for the price
3.0,VERY THIN. CUTE BUT SUPER THIN
3.0,"Very cute style I absolutely loved it but it was way too small - ordered my normal size and was way too tight in the chest. If you have a larger chest, I'd definitely order a size up!"
3.0,These would have been better if they were longer.  I'm a short person and it did not reach my elbows.  They are pretty.
3.0,Very cute. But painful to put them on correctly
3.0,$10 per pair…these aren't any different than any other crew sock. My son wanted them as a gift so bought them but it pained me to purchase. Ridiculous price for Nike socks.
3.0,Nice hat. It’s warm. I thought it was more of a snug fitting hat but it’s longer then the image appears. Nothing wrong with that but it’s not what I was expecting. I like the hats that fit to your head not that kind that have the reservoir tip. This defiantly has the reservoir tips 😂
3.0,Lasted about a full summer before finally breaking. Next summer I will probably spend a little extra for the better quality goggles.
3.0,Material very rough ! Even after washing
3.0,My cellphone Galaxy 5 fits nicely. I was replacing one that the zipper broke on and I expected the same quality. The leather and strap are much cheaper quality than the original.
3.0,It’s pretty good. Runs a little small. The fabric feels cheap.
3.0,"Received this set of 7 pair of holiday earrings.  Yes they are inexpensive but wearing once a year makes that ok.  I only needed 1 pair so I gifted most of the others.  Great variety of colors, red, green, gold, silver, blue and 2 magenta pair. One is exactly the same as another.  I think this is a mistake.  The glitter is uneven on that pair.  Maybe that's why I got 2 of the same?  The others are fine.  Yes, I've found some glitter on my face by the end of the day but it's super fine and not difficult to remove by washing my face.  They are cute and fun and put me in a festive mood!  They mostly all came with clear silicone<br />""backs"" to help them stay on when masking/unmasking so great job!"
3.0,Missing crown
3.0,"Nice for travel, but had to be careful with the zipper, not real strong and the change kept falling out of the change part"
3.0,"This runs very small, and has little stretch"
3.0,"Very nice two tone vest.  Unlike other vests from Ruth&Boaz, this one runs much smaller (perhaps one full size smaller than listed for US sizing).  But, as I am losing weight, I'll keep it as a goal for myself."
3.0,They got here late but the seller did contact me to warn me of a hold up. The socks work well to keep my legs from aching after an 8 hour nursing shift. This was the second pair I purchased before I realized they shrink after about 2 weeks of daily wear with hand washing and air drying. I was really bummed. They now come about 2 inches lower than the bend of my knee. I gave them to a shorter coworker and she loves them. Being 5&#34;10 they were just to short for me. I'm just going to buy the pricey version I need measured for.
3.0,"This is a L size. The lateral size is correct but the jacket is extremely short. The shortness is perhaps the style but it is extreme. I can see that it could work for a certain situation and style. The description should really mention this because it is so outrageously unusual. Weird. Otherwise, the material and tailoring are both quite good."
3.0,Overall construction is holding up but color is chipping off? Making me think this is not actual leather
3.0,The products are nice just big
3.0,First watch had all its dials broken off. It was quickly replaced with a working watch. Nice watch thought.
3.0,Looks good but too small
3.0,"So soft, so adorable and smells like an athletes arm pit with no washing instructions"
3.0,"&#34;no water bottle pocket&#34; or  loop for hook hanging, two large compartments for racket and gear, but no inner pockets for small items. sturdy material and really cute....."
3.0,would of liked for it to be two inches longer. Other than that good material fit great colors good
3.0,Runs small and is flimsy and bends easy.  I wouldn't purchase another.
3.0,"It's what you pay for.  Doesn't exceed the elegance expectations.  A quite nice, sheer fabric that will be warm as it's sheer but doesn't breath.  The camel color is more of a cool beige than warm beige.  It does the trick. Nice enough to wear with a cocktail dress or for feminine seasonal scarf.  You won't be mistaken for having bought a designer scarf, but then you wouldn't consider buying this if that mattered enough to you I imagine."
3.0,I sent it back and ordered a larger size
3.0,I haven’t worn it past trying it on. It’s for my class Reunion in November. It is a little long (I’m 5’3”) but I will be pairing it with heels.
3.0,Bottoms came off quickly: we glued them back on. House shoes so didn’t matter much
3.0,"Top is nice and soft- but it is not the tunic style I thought I was getting. Going to keep it anyway, as it is nice and soft and perfect for the Fall."
3.0,Muy largas
3.0,I found they needed to be glued on  -  they can off as I sweated during the match.
3.0,Potential to be nice but it was too big & fit like a sheet
3.0,"I misunderstood that 1) the dress was full-length, 2) the buttons only came to mid-thigh, 3) cheap material. Yuck."
3.0,"I ordered the 4.5-5mm size and the pearls I received measured 5mm in diameter. So, they are as described.<br /><br />They have a nice luster and are not a bright white, but more of a softer, ""winter white."" And they come with two sets of backs, the traditional metal kind and a smaller back that looks like it may be silicone. I found the metal backs to be very hard to put on and to and pull off of the earring stem. So, I will be using different backs.<br /><br />I was not pleased with the way they were packaged, though. They were placed loose inside a plastic bag along with the backs and could have easily gotten scratched this way. The seller could have at least stuck the earrings into foam or cardboard, then placed them into a box to keep them protected.<br /><br />Also, when I looked at each earring under a magnifying glass, both pearls were mounted onto the base slightly crooked and off-center. This is not noticeable when looking at them without magnification or when they are in my ears. However, for the amount the seller is charging, I would have expected better quality."
3.0,Cute but the eye are low
3.0,"Adorable, shrunk a whole size in cold wash. So bummed!"
3.0,"I had to replace this because the battery was dead on the first one. The battery is running when you receive the item to with no way to tell how long its been going. The first one I got not only had a dead battery, but when I pulled it out, it wouldn't retract.<br /><br />The new one worked fine, but who knows how long the battery will last.<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't buy again because of all the issues"
3.0,The bottom hem cam undone- looks like fishing wire. It lasted 1 use.
3.0,"The color and material are great for the beach. The bottoms are  very high-waisted which is not bad and the top fits well but if you are a bigger girl on the bottom, it is extremely snug in leg openings...like affect your circulation. Leaves a weird tan line due to the scallops."
3.0,"The picture isn’t blurry- the watch band design is smeared. It looks nothing like the picture, I was super disappointed for such a promising item. It came faster than expected, and everything about shipping was great though. It just looks wonky."
3.0,It was huge and heavy.  My teenager through it was wonderful till it hit her back..  it is cute though bulky and heavy.
3.0,"there was a wire coming through the top, an underwire . seller was good about returns."
3.0,"Purchased size based description...it was WAY to small.  Although it was returned, it did look well made."
3.0,They're beautiful looking purses I just wished they were made of a more sturdy material. It still works for me and I get a sorts of complements on them it's just not what I expected.
3.0,shorter than expected.
3.0,"So I'm recovering from a very large blood clot and was hoping I could wear these some days instead of my traditional compression stocking.  While they felt firm enough in the calf they were not firm enough above the knee for what I need.  I thought about trying the next size down but I'm thick waisted and I think the next size down would be uncomfortable to wear.  I will say these are comfy and stay up!  My only other issue, they are about 3 inches too long.  I'm 5'6"" but have pretty long legs for my height and I was shocked at how long these are....again maybe needed to go down a size."
3.0,The top is perfect but the bottom is too big.
3.0,One size fits all but would look better on a size 4. Quality is very good.
3.0,It is really pretty but i am afraid that the clasp will break soon. Its not heavy on the neck which is good. As expected it clanks a little with every step.
3.0,"Don't know if I just got flawed glass or this glass just did not make it to the pit stop in time.  The number ""4"" and party of Harvick's name fell off the glass in the dishwasher."
3.0,"It stretches 1 inch, haven't been able to go over 1 inch. Instructions to ensamble it are confusing and hard to follow. For that price it's a quick fix for tight clothes."
3.0,Wasn't real happy with theses small not so soft hankies.  There is one corner with mesh around one of the corners that's been ripped off by the second washing.
3.0,I loved how this costume had a little<br />More to it than the other flamingo costumes. It has two separate battery packs but still didn’t seem to work correctly. I had to tie the strap around neck to hold the head of the costume up and still it kept falling over. I had new batteries and made sure it was working.
3.0,"I was super excited to put my baby her first thanksgiving dress but there was a button missing that covers the diaper area. The dress was really cute. The headband fit her perfect though the bow was a little loose from the headband even though it’s a clip but she doesn’t like anything on her so we didn’t even use it. The size of the dress was correct but was a little sad a button was missing. I must’ve gotten a defected button, but still had my baby wearing the dress and headband for a picture."
3.0,"Good size, good insulation, awful zipper"
3.0,Too small. Not sized correctly
3.0,Narrow in the bust but otherwise ok
3.0,pretty pin but is top heavy
3.0,"This shoe horn didn't have the quality I had hoped for. The flap securing the hoop and hook fell off the second time it was used. There isn't a whole lot to this item. The only thing that could break, did."
3.0,Dress was cute but way too small.  I wear a 12-14 and ordered an XL and it was way too tight.
3.0,34B/32C and 5'7&#34; small was definitely too short and there was a loose fold in the front that I kept having to tuck in but otherwise looks gorgeous on.
3.0,"I was hoping that this shirt would fit my husband.  I ordered a XXXXL and my husband takes a 3XL in U.S. Sizes, but it did not fit him.  I let my son and grandson try it on, they both wear a 2XL in U.S. Sizes, it didn't fit either one of them.  I gave it to one of my son's friends and it was a little short, but it did fit him!<br /><br />Here are some measurements that I measured:<br /> •  From the top of the shoulder, next to the collar to the bottom of the shirt, it measured about 30½ inches long.<br /> •  Then I measured it straight across the lower stomach area and it was about 22 inches across, so it would be 44 inches around.<br /> •  I measured the upper chest area and it measured 23 inches across, so it would be 46 inches around.<br /> •  From the armpit to the cuff it measured, 24½ inches.<br /> •  The last measurement I did was all the way across the neckline and it measured 18½ inches.<br /><br />The most AWESOME thing about this shirt, is that it was extremely soft!<br /><br />I was given this product in exchange for my honest opinion and I was not compensated in any way for this review.

3.0,Didn’t fit how I expected a little big. But overall still cute
3.0,"They are way to big , nice look"
3.0,"It gets warm, but not in the places you need it. I would want a vest with more coverage.<br /><br />For those reading the misleading reviews, you need a power bank to run this vest, it doesn't come with one"
3.0,Runs large and has no real support.
3.0,This shirt runs big. It's heavy and stretchy. The logo feels sticky to the touch even after being washed a few times.
3.0,"Cute design, but very small!"
3.0,"The waist and length are size correctly and the 38W fits fine at 5’10 and 240lbs. They are comfortable, however I find them to be very narrow in the leg.  Have worn them weekly for over a month now and have washed and hang dried them repeatedly. They are holding up very well. My legs are on the large size, even so these are tighter than normal on my legs and make it look sort of like I’m wearing skinny jeans; otherwise they are fine. At about twice the price of Levis though I don’t think I’ll be making a switch."
3.0,"Like the design, their just huge!"
3.0,"I've washed this sweater 3 times, and cannot get the wrinkles out due to packaging. They use a vacuum air tight seal, which its just huge permanent fold lines on the shirt front and back and sleeves"
3.0,Nice skirt but it reminds me of my Mom's old polyester. It's super shiny in the office light. Other than that it's nicely made.
3.0,Not bad shirts but they weren’t the same ones I was expecting. I used to buy them from Costco and loved them but don’t have membership so I tried ordering on line and the tags are different and they just not as thick and don’t fit quite the same
3.0,Thought it would fit my fat little feet but unless you have no meat on them toes…it won’t fit
3.0,Very cute but the fur ball on the top came off after a month. Inside is lined and very warm. Sometimes rides up because I have a lot of hair and lining on inside is slippery. Doesn’t itch.
3.0,Pretty good for the money. It does die unless you wear it daily which is kind of annoying but it looks nice
3.0,Nice material on this skirt.
3.0,The shirts roll up under my overalls.
3.0,"This comes beautifully packaged with your choice of a copper style chain, or black cord.<br /><br />The stone is opaque....<br /><br />It is not a bad piece - but I would not order it again."
3.0,Watch is cute. Numbers very small and too small for my 6 year grandchild. Need to return it.
3.0,Had to return due to the fact the material just felt to heavy and uncomfortable
3.0,"After measuring my daughter’s torso length I ordered the 10-12 size. When it arrived, the length was perfect but it was too baggy in the width for my slim girl. I plan to keep it for my younger daughter when she gets older."
3.0,"Smaller than expected, but was otherwise cute."
3.0,I ordered the ladies' 6 and it was waaaay too big.
3.0,I love this sweater it fits well. However mine came with black spots on the front design that make it look like it's always dirty and they cannot be removed even after washing.
3.0,Pics are better than the tie.  Color is close but not exact.  Cross between regular and skinny tie.
3.0,"It's nice and light, but without the tie it would be a tent. I'll probably get a belt for it. Big problem is that it's pretty much see through."
3.0,Really big and slip around. I folded them down and used anyway but wouldn’t recommend for women.
3.0,"These boots run large. The footbed is a little big, the upper with it's split design is huge and very loose. My daughter usually wears an 11-11.5 and the size 10 in these boots fits her. These boots are very cute. My daughter loves tu and multiple people have asked me where I bought them for her. They are also pretty warm and very soft. They are easy to get on and off. They have poor traction on the soles and are slippery on smooth floors. They are completely unsuitable for wet weather. They are not even slightly water resistant. Water ruins the look of the boots and gets your feet wet, which is kind of a problem for a winter shoe. You cannot wear them in the snow or rain."
3.0,I’m only giving these three stars because I bought these for my 2 year old and they are huge! It’s so hard to find gloves or mittens for children.
3.0,"Great dress. Just small,"
3.0,Fit and comfort not i expected
3.0,It was a nice looking dress. The material felt just right. I ordered a xxl but it would not zip up.
3.0,"Wish it would have fit, it was adorable but did not fit my breasts at all. I'm 5'7 170lbs and DD. It was way too tight on the chest and if I would have ordered a L instead of M it would not have looked flattering around my waist with the extra material."
3.0,It's stiff.  Maybe after a few days it will feel better.  But day 2 and it's not comfortable.
3.0,"I am so disappointed that they sent me the wrong size. I purchased this as a gift for a friend's birthday, the colors are great, good quality  but I need the size I ordered!"
3.0,I love the shirt but it is way too big
3.0,"It’s a nice light material and the wine color was great, but the shirt is much shorter than in the pix. I find myself pulling it down as it rides up because of the knot/twist."
3.0,It was super cute but the ring was broken. The ring was not soldered closed near the bee. It makes me think that the ring too thin thus to delicate.
3.0,"As with all Chinese magnifier optics, the magnification claim is exaggerated.  This one is around 11x, not 30x.  It is decent for the price though.  I wouldn't recommend this for people looking for a 30x loupe.  With normal eyesight, anything under 20x isn't necessary.  Do be aware however that real 30x loupes have a considerably smaller field of view."
3.0,Loved the print. Cute top. Thinner material and no stretch to fabric.  Great for summer or under a blazer. Boxy in shape does not define or showcase waist line.
3.0,These are not like the other ones I have bought<br />They have elastic that goes high on the ankle that my son who has sensory issues does not like
3.0,Pretty bright colors reminds of a sun dress
3.0,The ruber on the shoes is starting ; to ware out not as I expected! The shoes are not as strong!
3.0,Love the pendant but the chain is cheap. It broke on me the first day. Will be looking for a better chain.
3.0,"This item is a really good idea in theory, but in practice may be not the best bet. I had a c section almost five weeks ago, and purchased this about 4 weeks after the surgery. They are extremely difficult to get on due to the tightness and I can't imagine trying to do this right after. I did order the correct size, so that is not an issue, but they would be very difficult right after regardless of what size ordered. All of that said, to wear the panties for a short amount of time is great. But let's face it, most people after a major surgery are mostly wearing jammies."
3.0,I like the look but I didn't realize this was synthetic. For the same price you can get the real deal if you shop around.
3.0,i didn't like the material...it was sort of &#34;smooth&#34; best way i can describe it
3.0,"I loose the pattern, but the tie was too small for my nephew so he gave it to his younger brother. Very small tie"
3.0,I love love this dress....HOWEVER it is way way to long on my 5'3....38DD body frame. I tried everything to get it OFF the ground like other people who wrote reviews here and they all failed or look not right on my height. Since I like this dress so much I will take it to my local seamstress who has been tailoring my clothes for years including my wedding dress.  I bought the black dress with the flowers. It looks really good on. I also will be getting the sides of the dress near the boob-age taken in a little because the boobs get a little too much air for my comfort. You will also need to buy some petals of the nipples because if it gets brezzie the nips will definitely poke out...no thanks. I also was not able to walk with the length of the dress despite my best efforts in doing so. If I didn't get this dress hemmed I will walk on it and trip...yes its that long. This dress would be better if it was offered in Petite. Can't wait to wear it after my seamstress gets a hold of it.
3.0,I'm 5'10&#34; and this dress is too short for me
3.0,It is a very cute necklace but it tangles up a lot throughout the day.
3.0,made a little noise
3.0,Works well but not very bright
3.0,"Ordered child's size, for a 7 year old.  Looks to large on her."
3.0,"Meh, wouldn't order from again. Didn't fit right."
3.0,Doesn't taper with your arm. It's tight near the elbow but on the wrist end it's very loose.
3.0,"For the price of one, I can have 10.  For that I would give 5 stars but upon arrival, two of the ties were defected.  Went straight into trash.  Others seems to be alright."
3.0,I returned the bracelet because the pins didn’t fit & couldn’t be hooked onto the watch. The bracelet is beautiful but the function was poor.
3.0,This is a juniors not womens!!  I ordered a medium and returned it and ordered a large.  The large was still too small.  I ended up giving it to my 13 yr old daughter. She loves it though. Its soft and cute. A large fit her well and she is 5'2 and 110 lbs.
3.0,It is a nice pillow cover but the colors are way off from this picture.  Lots more burgandy in it or I would have given it a higher rating.  I needed it to be the colors shown.
3.0,"I loved the fit of the bag and the colors in the front, but I was disappointed that the back was orange which is not shown on the picture. It is very cute and made with sturdy material. I just would have been happier with a black back."
3.0,just ok wouldnt buy again
3.0,"I liked the material and all over look of the top, but I have to return in. It doesn’t fit right in the chest area. So if you are a bit busty you might want to rethink this top"
3.0,Love the sturdiness of these sunnies. I hoped they would replace my favorite sunnies however they are Not round as the picture and description show. My search continues...
3.0,"Loved the look of this watch, however it broke only a week after wearing it."
3.0,The bottom is very cheeky... Beware if you have any kind of behind
3.0,I read reviews and since I have wider feet I decided to order a half size up. They were too big by quite a bit BUT had I ordered my own size my feet wouldn't have fit in the front of the shoe as it is far too narrow. It's also one of those shoes where you'd be able to see the beginning of your toes... and being able to see that is weird looking in my opinion. They are cute and of great quality. Just not built for my type of foot.
3.0,"I ordered this dress in both the navy and the white and received yesterday. I am rating this a 3 based on I love the navy dress (a &#34;5&#34;) and hate the white dress (a &#34;1&#34;)- the average rating. The dresses delivered to me proved that the actual dress you get is hit-and-miss and not always the same. The same: both have a flower print on a solid background and pockets (which I love). Different: The navy is made of a polyester/spandex material that is soft, stretchy and comfortable; the white dress is a stiff non-stretchy material that is more appropriate as a curtain. The navy dress is the perfect length for me (I am 5' 4&#34;); the white dress is about two-three inches longer and would need to be shortened. The navy dress sleeve is 3/4 length; the white is long sleeve. The navy dress has no zipper and is pull-over; the white dress has a back zipper. Needless to say I am keeping the navy dress and have already sent the white dress back on it way. Buyer be aware- who knows what you will get... I am just glad I did get a dress that I do really like and will wear often I am sure. Disappointed in the white dress though- really like the color- but I don't dare order any more of this one."
3.0,"I like the shorts, but the first time I used, the snap come off."
3.0,Quality was not great but still a cute gift.
3.0,"Nice coat. I get lots of compliments on it. I have broad shoulders, so it's a little small. Not available in XL."
3.0,Arm band is a little small
3.0,I love this bra! It was a little tight at first but it stretches out a bit and ends up fitting perfectly
3.0,Loved them all the way up till I open the package had several of them like this with the star glitter all over the inside
3.0,"It is a bit helpful for night driving, but don't expect them to take care of all the issues.  Still too much glare."
3.0,This shirt is very very cute but it is huge! I wear an xl and that is what I got it it is like 4 sizes too big! I'll end up just altering it myself. I'm overall happy with my order.
3.0,Pants are too long.
3.0,"Really loved the bracelet but it frayed and broke in less than a year. I bought this a while back and I loved it, the stones were high quality and even the elastic band used was a decent band. But the issues that arose were two fold. First it didn't take long for the bracelet to become stretched out to the point where I was afraid to wear it, second before I owned it for a year the elastic had frayed and broke. The only reason I am giving this a 3 is because at least I can keep the beads and make something from the pieces left from the bracelet."
3.0,The colors are good. The fabric is ok. The socks are too small to wear comfortably. I am an 8 1/2 shoe. A smaller foot may find them long enough.
3.0,They run so small! I ordered a 3 xl and had to give them to a friend who wears a medium and they are tight on her.  But the material is so soft and they seem very well made.
3.0,"The shades are as expected, the logo can be mistaken as D&G, but the price gave them away. M happy with the product"
3.0,after i was able to put my feet in them and stretch them the slippers are comfortable
3.0,"good product, small fit, and extra wide brim"
3.0,It fits well.<br />The cotton is a bit too thin. I have other game-related T-Shirts that are much higher quality when it comes to the fabric.
3.0,Loved the color but it looked like a moo moo on me; adding the belt only bunched up the material around my waist; it was very large (but not too long) - just didn't work for me.  And yes thicker material than expected.
3.0,These shorts don’t suck but the sizing does. I ordered up so I got an Xl but they fit like a s/m
3.0,"Wrong size , but still am able to wear it"
3.0,Somewhat less effective with cold than I expected.
3.0,The hanger could be a little more user friendly.
3.0,"Item arrived quickly and I like it, the lining inside the back zipper is not attached therefore I’m going to have to return it. I love all the pockets would be 5 stars if it were a little larger."
3.0,Flimsier than expected
3.0,This would have been a five but no sleeve to store Google's in came with it. First thing in the instructions says allows store in sleeve when not it use. First time I've ever had a Google not come with little protector sleeve.
3.0,The print frames my crotch
3.0,"This couple Tshirt is a gift to my friend and her husband, the clothes size fit them well and they are satisfied with the clothes. Before I made the order, I thought this couple shirt would come with the carton shown on the item page, and as it's a gift order, the package should have been more well arranged."
3.0,"Beautiful pendant. It would've been nice if I had gotten the chance to actually wear the necklace. The clasp was broken on the chain, and it would've taken 2-3 weeks for them to send me another chain."
3.0,Quality was fine but I returned this product.  The fit was too large and boxy on my small frame.  (I am 5ft8 and 130 lbs.)
3.0,they are nice but a little larger than I thought they would be.
3.0,I returned these bras.  They seemed somewhat small they fit more like a demi bra so if you want full cup like it describes maybe go up 1 cup size.  But they were pretty and looked just like the picture.
3.0,Color faded very soon
3.0,cheap printed on fabric
3.0,"I gave this thing 3 stars because my kid loves it so much but I returned it twice. Paid return shipping twice.<br /><br />When they say, Order a size up, it's because of the hood. It's supposed to fit your whole head - over your face, right? The HOOD is small. The sleeves are way too long no matter what size you get. Seriously, it's like a straight jacket! Ha!<br /><br />Initially bought the large per the warning to order up. The sleeves were practically down to his knees! Ha! Returned it. The medium comes and its sleeves are also long while the hood cannot be easily zipped over my kid's beautiful and admittedly somewhat large head. He was looking out its mouth.<br /><br />The zip over the face thing is creepy. No pun intended. I think it's hideous but my hoodie-loving Minecraft fanatic 8-year-old loves it. It's for his Minecraft-themed birthday. What can you do? Bought another large. Third time's the charm."
3.0,"Bought this last year and have been wearing it often. The fabric is very soft but I might add that the fabric does have some kind of density to it because it is heavy or it sags. When I wash it, I air dry and do not dry it in the machine because of how delicate it  seems but overtime the holes to the buttons get loose and it would get unbuttoned while I slept. Its a great pair of pjs though, way better than some that I have bought from Target if I was to compare one another."
3.0,if your looking for something just to keep your piercing open this will do it. They are cheap and unattractive.
3.0,"Not cotton or blend- very synthetic shiney look, but photographs well"
3.0,I like this bag very much. The only thing I don't like is the zipper's stick and I can't close the bag. I only use the bag on the weekends.
3.0,I like the product!! Just was not true to size!!
3.0,Average quality for the price
3.0,Long them but way to big
3.0,"Length is nice. Fabric is soft, but to thin. Nice for Summer, but not Fall or Winter."
3.0,Reviews on sizing were all over the place so I ordered what should have worked but I got a pink tent instead.  Some of the reviewers mentioned a bad odor to the fabric and I agree with that.  I did not try to launder it since the size was huge.  Just packed it carefully and sent it back the next day.
3.0,"Comfortable, but fall out easy while laying down. Lost both sets"
3.0,Too big and not made out of the best material....
3.0,It is pretty. Material is cheaply made and caused irritation.
3.0,I love the material but the part to assemble the school bag to rolling did not work. was really disappointed with my purchase.
3.0,"I should look at it carefuly ,it was not as i expected"
3.0,Item ran extremely big. It's super adorable. It did however smell like harsh chemicals when it arrived.
3.0,The lenses do not stay in place.  When I'm looking straight ahead they are fine but if I look down to read something the become unsteady. If I look at the floor looking for something they completely come off.  I had to literally hold them with my hand in order to look down to read or to find something in a drawer or on the floor.  Too loose most of the time. I wish they had a little more angle on the end near the ears.
3.0,Much larger than I expected.  But they will get used.
3.0,Too bulky to tuck into jeans! Nice and thick but wasn't very flattering
3.0,Great little accessory
3.0,shorts are too short
3.0,Really cute - can't beat the price. Giving 3 stars because it arrived with a terrible chemical smell & I really don't know how this will hold up after I wash it? Will update review post-wash.
3.0,Very cute but way too big. I’m a true xs but sometimes amazon finds run small so you thought this could work. The waist was several inches too big. Had to return.
3.0,"These earrings are inexpensive so I guess I shouldn't have expected too much, but I thought they were a little cheap looking. Also they were too heavy for me so I had to take off all the bottom pieces. Now I can wear them. See photo."
3.0,"Longer than i expected it to be, but overall its a nice dress."
3.0,After reading many reviews I decided to buy this shirt. Mine looks just like the picture. I am 5' 8 I bought a xxl which says it is equal to a size 20. I think it is more like a size 18. The arms are tight not uncomfortable just tighter then I like. Many reviews stated that it was a little to long. I don't find this shirt long at all. I wish it was longer it is just short of covering my behind. Still a nice shirt for the price.
3.0,This necklace is a bit chunky.
3.0,"I really like this top, however it does run slightly large and the sleeves are pretty long. Also the weave is loose. I got two pulls in it the very first time I wore it."
3.0,"The package was damaged but the umbrella was fine. It was easy to put together. It does seem a little flimsy. I used 4  16&#34; patio blocks, which hold it fine, but the base still peeks out. The other option is 24&#34; patio blocks which would look better but take up even more precious patio space. I have only used the umbrella once so far, and it worked fine. I am concerned, as other posters, that the plastic anchor mechanism is quite flimsy, not sure how long it will be effective. I suggest you have plenty of room on your patio or deck."
3.0,"I love the color scheme on these, but I washed them with my other colors and they tinted everything blue-green. I would hope that for this price, they were pre-washed, or at least dyed with a higher quality dye."
3.0,"These glasses look pretty but one of the lenses was bent out of the frame and the case would not snap closed again after being opened. The snap didn't line up. The temples weren't screwed on straight. AND there are no labels, tags or stickers with the product that advertise its UV protection to assure that it is as stated in the product description. They were exchanged and the second pair was slightly better. Only a little bit of warping on one lense and only can be seen on the inside and not at all when they're on."
3.0,It was a weird fit.
3.0,"I have a tiny wrist, Iight be able to use this for an anklette."
3.0,"Sock were nice but the way they are made, distorts the pictures designed on them when they are stretched to wear.."
3.0,Too small for the indicated size.
3.0,"Not what I expected, I guess I did not read description properly. Was expecting a complete dress but it is only a skirt, very thin."
3.0,"Nothing fancy or too impressive. I knew it wouldn't be great though.<br /><br />I ordered an XL because the other reviews said it was small. I have a 40&#34; hip, 30&#34; waist, and 34D bust but because the material isn't stretchy I need some help getting it off. The fabric is cheap and very thin. Trying it on I wore a black tank and black shorts. You could tell. But I'm sure with white shorts and a tank it'd be great.<br /><br />Now once it's on and everything it looks amazing, except for the collar not being straight or centered. But it's fine. It looks super cute and fits well once on.<br /><br />Oh, the skirt zips up and on the side of the shirt is a small zipper."
3.0,"The material and quality of the dress was really nice, but I didn’t have the right body shape for this dress. I am 5’2” 150 lbs and a bit busty. I ordered a large and could not zip it up and the XL fit but my boobs looked huge in the dress. If you have hips this dress will look nice I just could not fill it out in that area"
3.0,They are nice but do not look like the picture posted. It’s hard to tell if it’s a heart. And you see more of the silver piece that holds it together then the stone.
3.0,"The tint color is what I was looking for, size of the frames fit my face"
3.0,A little cheap looking.  Good for a kid.
3.0,"I wanted to like this!  Looks so cute on the model. However, it was shorter than I had wanted (which was just above knee length), the neckline was not a big as pictured (I like a scoop neck for comfort while sleeping) and the material felt like it may fall apart after a couple of washes.  I returned this night shirt."
3.0,"These fit well, love the high waist, and the color selection was nice but I do not find them to be as warm as other fleece lined leggings I've bought.  They also tend to pill after being laundered (machine wash inside out, line dried).  They are ok but won't buy this brand again"
3.0,The cups are smaller than I need. The tankini itself is as expected but not big enough cups
3.0,VERY SMALL. I am a med/ large and would get xxl or xxxl if possible !
3.0,"The fabric is flimsy, not enough body and should have more padding on the Botton to produce pushup look."
3.0,This is not ask fluffy as it is represented its light maybe 2 layers not what I expected
3.0,Bottom fit great but I'm busty up top. The top definitely doesn't correspond with the bottom size. I literally had to shove my boob up in the top. I am 230lbs xl pant/bottoms and a 40G up top.
3.0,I was hoping the toes would be sewn comfortably so I didn’t feel the threads but it rubs on my toes and isn’t comfortable. I wear them inside out to deal with it.
3.0,I like the cuteness.
3.0,"These shorts run large. I usually wear a size 6 and a 4 (the smallest size available), was still a little big. I'm also concerned about the cheapness of the zipper. Hoping it doesn't bust!"
3.0,This wasn't the size I was expecting. It's way too big
3.0,"As someone whose always searching for comfy slides to wear around the house.. they are, okay.<br />I don’t have a particularly narrow foot but the tops of these are extremely loose. The walls of the base of the shoe are rather high which prevent my foot from slipping out but the loose tops make these very floppy when I walk. Comfy, cushy.. do I think they’re durable? Maybe? If you spend like $10 more you could just get the adidas cloud foam slides which are the most comfortable slides on the market hands down."
3.0,"Order a larger size, maybe 2!"
3.0,SUPER thin fabric and really big. But it's ok.
3.0,"I like this watch. It's a good value for what it costs and looks good. The band is great and higher quality than I expected. My beef is that after wearing it outside on a hot summer day I got some condensation inside the watch. Not a lot, but enough that I noticed."
3.0,"It looks nice for a bathing suit coverup. I haven't used it yet, but will be taking it on my cruise. I think I would like it to hide more of me, maybe a tighter weave... but still ok to wear out near the pool."
3.0,Just the size.i even ordered extra bigger sizes. But didnt fit my son.
3.0,Cute but not what I was expecting!<br />Still cute for summer
3.0,I don't like it.  I can't get it to fit right on my wrist.  The leather is very stiff!
3.0,Pretty color.<br />Don't believe this is leather. Doesn't have leather smell. It's got a plastic coating all round.  Doesn't feel like leather either
3.0,"Not very sharp when cutting thru gauze and doing dressing changes. Smaller than I expected. Very cute however, I receive many compliments!"
3.0,"This cuff well wow...it's gorgeous but I can't wear it for more than 5 minutes. The clamp is super tight, so tight that it leaves a dent in my ear and my ear HURTS  horrible after. I was disappointed that it did that because I love it in all other ways. Its very detailed and beautiful. I've gotten complimented on it many times but oy it hurts so barely after I take it off the cmprecion in the area is awful. I'm hoping I'll be able to solve the issue somehow, so I am gonna experiment around a bit to see if I can adjust it to none so day tight."
3.0,I love pattern and you can breath it’s just to big and loose around ears and mouth it didn’t fit correctly hopefully when I wash and dry it will shrink
3.0,Better than my expectations and came pretty fast
3.0,"they look cheaper in real life than they do in the picture, but I still like it esp for the price. I'm not sure how long they'll last."
3.0,"I bought this watch in May 2018. It kept good time initally, except at night while I was sleeping it often required being reset in the more. I suppose that was due to lack of motion while sleeping. I didn't mind that, because it was such a great looking watch for the money. However, it stopped on me Oct 20th 2019. I took it to a jeweler. The warranty only last for a year. He said the place he that worked on mechanical selfwindinh watches would charge a minimum of $100. Just remember if you buy it, you get what you pay for. There are some self-winding watches that come with a lifetime warranty, of course, I am sure the price of the watch is much higher."
3.0,"Although this set is cute, the fabric is so uncomfortable. Even after washing this and air drying it, it was so stiff. It has no movement and it wrinkles easily. It’s honestly very itchy. The top fits good but the shorts are too small, so if you have a larger waist than you are in tops, I would say this is risky."
3.0,I give these three stars for the quanity and the variety of colors but they are very weak. Already two of them have snapped. They are not strong at all and it is disappointing.
3.0,"The dress design is very cute and it fits well.  However, it is sheer and my daughter had to wear white shorts underneath so she wouldn't show her underwear.  The dress is light for the summer and it's great for a formal occasion."
3.0,"Really nice. Cut well, great design. I bought the pleated one before and the XXL was too big, so I tried to XL on this and it was too small.  I ended up having to return it but I'll be keeping my eye out for a larger size.  I wish it would have fit. I really loved it."
3.0,The look of the jumpsuit is good but it runs small.
3.0,bag of sand mostly rocks and a few very small specks of gold flakes
3.0,Would have liked it more with music not just lights
3.0,"My daughter loves them,  I think they are cheaply made, but she loves them!"
3.0,I was disappointed in this jacket. I bought white and it looked kind of purple/grey. Not what I was expecting. I kept it but not my favorite
3.0,"I expected more of this wallet, Is kinda of small"
3.0,"I understand this is a compression sock.  However, the sizing is not accurate.  My feet are size 8.  The xs/s (6-8) is too small and the s/m (8-10) is too big and doesn't give the proper support for a compression sock."
3.0,"I was surprised that they are a rib knit, and were very thin. Also, at least 5"" too long. I'm 5'3"" but still, I would have had to wear stilettos. They fit too tight in the knees and thighs. Also, be aware that they charged me $6.00 to return them."
3.0,"""I had Bought pair ten years ago that were more sturdy . These Glasses lenses scratched the first two weeks and the was disappointing.""<br /><br />Bummer ..."
3.0,Like the color but the fabric was too light/transparent
3.0,"The color was too red!!  The heel was too short, felt very-very flat when walking and could not feel the support.<br />I compare this sandal with another brand for two weeks. The other brand felt softer, great support making walking<br />all day effortless. I really liked the style and design, but it didn't improve my feet issue. I will be returning the sandal."
3.0,"I ordered a size larger than my usual size because people had said that it runs small. After washing in cold water and hanging dry (not in dryer) I discovered that it had gotten smaller in width and is bordering on being too tight. I can still wear it, but wouldn't want it any tighter. Also, armholes are a bit tight. It didn't shrink in length @ all and is quite long. I'm a small woman (5', 106 lbs.) So maybe this is scaled for a tall and very slender woman. Not quite right for me. The fabric is very nice and soft, though."
3.0,Las mangas son cortos
3.0,I’d post a picture.. but ain’t nobody trying to see that. Fit runs small compared to what I’m used to in other brands. Low rise as well so they tend to sink down in the back when bending or squatting. I just bought one pair to try out. I won’t be buying another. I’ll stick to what I’m used too.
3.0,Nice glasses - was disappointed that after only a few times wearing - the Qakley print across the middle of the lenses wore completely off
3.0,It's a great product just VERY small.  I purchased the XS. It might fit a 12m old baby.  Seriously!
3.0,"the skirt is very pretty looks like the picture but the sizing was not what i ordered  I ordered a size XX2 it was more like a size medium , the length  was too long for somebody at least 6ft tall"
3.0,"good size and fit for both pairs, but the &#34;rubberized&#34; black pair weren't my favorite - if they were both made the same they would be much better.  That said, we got these for our wedding party and they made for some great pictures."
3.0,"Need a large one. XL would fit too small for my size. Can't get a new one it would cost to much. I got a L one and its to small, what I need is a XL large one, but i cant send this back cause it caused to much."
3.0,the quality of material was not what i wanted or expected
3.0,"the pro's of this band: it looks great! The silicone is soft and comfortable.<br />The con's: in comparison to the original fitbit band that came with my Blaze, the quality is sub par. The clasp part feel cheap and moves/becomes loose on my wrist. Also, the pins that hold the band onto the Blaze are relatively cheap and the band has fallen off twice in the 2 days I've been wearing it. The band is also a little difficult to attach to the face, the pins move very easily.<br />Overall, I plan on using this band until I get too annoyed with is coming apart, because I like the white. I wouldn't recommend this band based on the quality."
3.0,"Cute sweater, but definitely size up if you want the sweater to look like picture of the model wearing it. The sleeves are not that long, more like 3/4 sleeve."
3.0,Fits alittle tight even tho I ordered the size suggested and after reading the reviews. Fabric is alittle on the thin side.
3.0,My mom ordered these. In her words &#34;They arrived yesterday. Super cute. I put a pair on this morning around 7:30. Went to change into workout clothes at 12:30 and there was already a hole in both socks.&#34;
3.0,It's not very flattering for a curvy figure.  Fabric is good quality as is the dye.
3.0,"Love the idea of a merino oh short set. The top is fine, although the where the bottom hem is seen is slightly twisted. Not a deal breaker. The pleating at the top lays nicely and sort of camouflages the lack of a bra. My issue is with the shorts, as they are super short. I could not wear these to walk around the house, bedroom only. The inseam is maybe an inch (if I stretch the fabric) and the shorts are so loose that it is obvious what you are wearing underneath. Also, because they are so loose, they get twisted in the night and I have to wake up and rearrange my shorts  I'm not looking for skin tight, but a bit more fitted and longer inseam would be preferable."
3.0,Not true to size the xl is more like a medium. If you buy get it 2 or 3 sizes up.
3.0,Polish didn’t have great coverage for scuff marks.
3.0,I'm 5 feet 2 inches 120 pound i ordered a medium and it was a little to big should of ordered a small .. other then that it's s real cute bathing suite
3.0,This was not that flattering on me. I think it look better over leggings since it was not floor length.
3.0,i hadn't realized there was a wire across the top.  didn't like that.
3.0,Although the overall design is really pretty. The necklace is a bit lightweight and flimsy. Not bad for the price I guess
3.0,One of my rings were broken but other than that I love the rings..they're very stylish
3.0,I really like the suction but if you are looking for a legit anti-fog pair of goggles this is not the one.
3.0,he likes the look
3.0,"I ordered two sizes up because I saw others' posts about it fitting very small. The material is very weird (definitely not cotton), and the shoulders are extremely poochy. The pattern is cute but I would not order this again."
3.0,Runs really small but is beautiful
3.0,"I liked the overall look of this shirt, but it doesn't fit the way I need it to. The arms are small and tight. and didn't wear the way it does in the picture. In the picture the sleeves look long and loose, but they definitely are the opposite. It was more cap sleeved. i received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"these were made of a hard plastic, not a rubber material like Suunto makes their watchbands out of, save your money and just buy a real Suunto band. These are not soft as advertised. I had to heat in very hot water to get them to stretch out to fit the band."
3.0,I bought this as a gift so I'm not sure the fit or feel but it looks nice I guess.
3.0,"Constantly felt the adhesive slipping, product does not lie flat on the skin and is clearly visible under form fitting clothing. Emailed company,  per their suggestion, for replacements with no reply. I recommend looking elsewhere."
3.0,"They're OK, just OK. They are night and tight on the top but that is all."
3.0,Very lightweight and beautiful. Need assist to put on. Fragile and broken within 1st week.
3.0,"I ordered way to big, because I listen to reviews on how tight the chest and arms were. Just order your regular size."
3.0,It's a pretty shirt but doesn't fall on the body as pictured. Very lose for size.
3.0,So far the inside is great and plenty of space. I really wanted a sand/ light brown color. The one I received is fairly dark compared to the pictures.my 3 star is mainly because of only color. See the picture of mine on right.
3.0,I am only 5'2 and this was so short that it cannot be worn as a dress. Otherwise it is lightweight and the fabric is nice and soft. I chose to return it.
3.0,"My daughter was going to make a bath bomb but it was HUGE way to big, it would work for other things but when she tried to make a bath bomb it just fell apart :( other wise i think it is pretty good"
3.0,"Inner Lining of CC section of Wallet unraveled within 1 day slightly, other than that Good Product."
3.0,Arrived almost a week late and sizes run small
3.0,"The description of this coat said it was down filled, however the coat tag said it was polyester filled."
3.0,"Received in timely manner. The shirt is too small in the shoulders, and is poorly sewn. It's seems it's made for smaller women."
3.0,Opening on the hoop was way too small to get on my ear. Very cute piece of jewelry though.
3.0,"I bought these glasses to replace a pair of quays (midnight runner) I lost in the ocean. The style/ shape of these sunglasses is very similar to the pair I wanted to replace. The only problem that I have, and this is a personal preference, is that they are very oversized. I have a huge head and round face. Usually, when sunglasses claim oversized, they are never oversized enough for me. These are a bit too oversized. They look nice and they fit me well. It's just I don't like this style for every day. They're just ""trying too hard"" big.  I hate that look. Other than that, they're great quality for the price."
3.0,My kids complains about the wetness that forms on the plastic and it quickly fogs up.
3.0,I dont like the shiny material but fits great.!
3.0,"The bodice and sleeves are completely different materials,  plus the bodice isn't quite as white as I was expecting"
3.0,It's a lot smaller than I anticipated. Still pretty.
3.0,Nice looking but cheaply made sorry
3.0,Cheap material paper thin
3.0,"I love this suit, however the top is a little larger than most and do not really offer much support if you're bigger in the ta-ta area. Wish you could tie the back tighter. Ended up having to return it because I was afraid it would come off in the ocean. Beautiful colors, and super flattering. I was sad it didn't work out."
3.0,"Way too small for me, if you have small nostrils go for it. They're really beautiful (especially the rose gold)."
3.0,"This was a well manufactured product and just what I was looking for, but This adult size hood mask was more like a children’s medium. It was so tight on the adult head that it was smothering in very uncomfortable. Had to return"
3.0,"The finish/texture is not smooth,. I am fine with it being faux leather, but it does not look like leather with its sandpaper texture."
3.0,Thin and Cheap but works for the costume. Wear layers underneath!
3.0,"This jumpsuit is very fun. The colors aren't as vibrant as pictured, but I expected that. The problem is the sizing. I'm 5'3"", 205 lbs, 38D, no hips but round butt. I ordered the XXLarge which definitely is not my size, but based on other reviews I thought it could work. Length wise, it's fine - short and tall girl friendly. The problem is that I need a smaller size so there isn't too much space in the thigh and crotch area, but the XXL is needed for my 38D chest. Also because it's simply too big, the peekaboo stomach area was wayyy too open and it didn't come together like it should.<br />I will not reorder but I see how it would look amazing on a different body type"
3.0,I am dark skin and the blue is very beautiful on me but not the other colors.
3.0,The balls are very tiny. I have purchased two simuilar and the balls were much larger. They are not the size shown in the picture. I do not recommend this product.
3.0,The quality isn’t work the money.  It looks it was stitched off from other spare button.
3.0,"Cards, Bills, Coins, Keys - All in one slim wallet. Awesome!<br /><br />The wallet performs it's function well with one exception: The slits in the coin pockets are too large so that anything smaller than a quarter will fall out soon.<br /><br />Looks: The brown leather looks great. Unfortunately, the inner lining of the coin pockets frays around the edges. Acceptable for a 12 $ wallet."
3.0,"If you’re looking for something light weight, look elsewhere. This thing is very bulky and very heavy, and wears more like a hefty sweatshirt than a light weight jacket. Seems to run big as well."
3.0,"Bought this as as tunic dress, too short for 5-3 woman"
3.0,This dress is beautiful. The reason it got a 3 instead of 5 is because when it arrived many of the little torquise jewels were hanging off and not secure. Luckily I am handy with a needle and thread or I would have had to send it back. I measured my bust and the dress is a bit big but the corset in the back allows it to be snugged just right and it looks beautiful on my full figure
3.0,"These are what they look like: super-cheap sandals. They're fairly uncomfortable, and walking any distance in them would suck. They're pretty much only useful if you're going to wear them in the shower, or for wet yard work where foot protection isn't an issue (I use mine when spraying things clean with a hose). For that, they're quite functional."
3.0,Feel very stiff
3.0,"I wanted to love these boots, but they lack some fairly standard traits a hiking boot should have.  I’ll start off by saying they are pretty comfortable out of the box and have a footbed that’s kinda makes you feel like you are being propelled forward when walking.  They are very light weight and have a very nice appearance.  I love the way they look.  First ding was the laces.  They are super thin and don’t feel like they will hold up.  Next was the toe box.  It’s too big for my feet, so they were sliding around a bit when I was hiking.  I have standard width feet.  I didn’t get any blisters though on an 11 mile break in hike.  Next big issue is the traction on rocks.  I don’t know what rubber they use, but it’s just not up to snuff.  I was doing a lot of rock scrambles and they did not feel confidence inspiring.  I think they should make a deal and get one of the better rubber manufacturers to help them out.  I love Stealth rubber for stickiness and Vibram for durability.  Lastly was the construction of the boot.  They do have a nice rubberized coating on the lower part of the boot, but the upper materials don’t feel very tough.  The upper part by the heel is like neoprene, and the lower mesh is sod to the touch.  I’m not sure how they’d hold up to abrasions from rocks.  I’d bet money that they will shred a wear quickly.  This boot could be fixed.  I hope On learns from this and makes a few adjustments.  I kinda wish I’d bought the La Sportiva Stream GTX or the Asolo Falcon GV’s for around the same money.  Hind sight is 20/20.  However, if you are not doing a lot of rock scrambles and like speed hiking or want a high top wp trail runner, these might be the boot for you.  They are great looking and stylish.  They do perform very well as long as your not on super rocky terrain.  Hope this helps!"
3.0,"I tend to be very hard on outdoors equipment and sadly, these didn't make it through a full season.  My first impression was great based on the quality appearance and comfort.  I rarely find a shoe that doesn't require better arch support for my high arches but these were amazing.<br /><br />They held up to a trek over Snowdon in Wales.  The waterproofing worked fine and the tread was amazing.  Shortly after this, however with a few subsequent shorter hikes on basic forest trails in them, the textile portions of the upper began separating from the leather.  Both boots did this. It wasn't long before I noticed the soles were losing traction and had actually worn through on some of the knobs.  I'm guessing I had about a 75-80 mile service life on my pair.<br /><br />I still wear them for odd jobs around the house but they're no longer trail worthy.  If you're a casual visitor to the outdoors and just need a capable pair of boots to get you through a few short hikes in a season, these are worth the money.  If you're looking into more serious trekking, I would spend some time at your local outdoor shop to find the right boot for you."
3.0,rather tight
3.0,"nice and good quality<br />but it doesn't fit right, too big<br />size small is really size medium"
3.0,"I am a 6ft, 190lb male and my default size is usually large, but not with this item. I couldn’t Zip it up with a standard flannel shirt underneath . There is no way I could ever layer items of clothing (say, a sweater ) underneath this. I needed an x-large for the very first time on any item of clothing.<br />Be careful!"
3.0,"This felt nice and soft, but the arms were way too short.  I am about 5’9” and my arms are a little on the longer side but these sleeves barely went past my elbows.  So I had to return it."
3.0,"These shoes are as expected given their inexpensive price. I really liked them initially because they were very light and comfortable, but don't plan on wearing these shoes anywhere except for walking. I wore them to the gym two/three times and started noticing the black part near my toes was rubbing off :/. Pretty disappointed since I did really like them!"
3.0,"Mask looks nice, but the fit isn’t good for kids. My daughter is12 and the mask isn’t a good enough fit for her to wear it and be safely protected."
3.0,The stitches ripped out on the front top corners.  Didn't hold up for too long. :(
3.0,Inexpensive not easy to clasp but it isn't bad for a inexpensive statement necklace
3.0,Too bright. I did not like the color.
3.0,"I really liked the look of this watch. Unfortunately, the metal part that holds the strap on broke after 2 months. I have tried to call and email customer service but haven’t got a response. I guess you get what you pay for.<br /><br />Update: I did end up heading from customer service and they are mailing me a new strap so I have updated from two to three stars"
3.0,Too tight in the sleeves. Go a side up. Asian sizes run small. It’s cute
3.0,Cute but runs pretty small.
3.0,Do not last.  Six washes and the seems fray.  Would not buy again.
3.0,Everything fit great the only thing I didn’t like was the neckline...it was too high.<br />Not the length the image shows.
3.0,"Wow these are almost bigger than my face.<br />The color is cute. And of course they are lightweight and feels like plastic, but we’re not expecting luxury here at this price range.<br />They’re fun sunglasses you can throw on and throw around and not worry about them.<br />I have high cheek bones and medium small face so they were not flattering on me at all."
3.0,The m ost un usual &#34;necklace&#34; I've ever seen.  Very delicate and one has to be very careful not to pu ll the feather or it will come apart.i'
3.0,It wasn't very long and the material was thinner than anticipated.
3.0,"The fabric that the shirt is printed on is not that great. Not a heavyweight fabric. The Yamaha logo is also printed a little off center. So if you can't even get the logo in the middle of the shirt, that's a direct indication of low quality."
3.0,Great buy for quantity but quality not that good. Real thin and small.
3.0,Looked cool and what I wanted but the sleeves where to short.
3.0,"Fits well. Sturdy material. It does not have any type of a liner, if it would I would give 5 star rating."
3.0,These were too short for my 5' 10&#34; 16 yr old son so they are being returned - other than that great quality - he was sad they didn't fit.  I received at a discount for our honest opinion
3.0,These were cute. Light weight and quality was okay. My daughter loves them. Shipping was fast.
3.0,Would be better if you could get it printed on back. Huge logo looks weird to me on front of shirt
3.0,"should have paid attention to reviews, it's tight in the sleeves and bodice. I like it enough to keep it but should have gone up a size."
3.0,Great design but the materials are a little cheap. I wear wallets out fast so I bought two of them.
3.0,"Not as expected, the color is changing already only after using it a few times."
3.0,"It fits as expected. I wear a medium in top and bra size 36C. Cheap material omce u wash it, its over."
3.0,"Looks just like the picture, except for the size. On the stock photo of it being worn, it fits snugly; however, in reality it is much taller and wider. I didn't actually out it on, but I put the octopus cuff piece around my ear and it just looked ridiculous because it was so big. Bummer."
3.0,"i love these bracelets but they have problem...<br /><br />they don't match...size or design wise<br /><br />The 24-70 is inexplicably larger then the 50.  and that would be great if the 50 was a great fit but its too small.  all be it i am big gut and have large wrists, but it if was the same size as the 24-70 it wouldnt be a problem at all<br /><br />The other is that the 24-70 has different font for MM...this isnt really a big deal, its just odd that it would have such a strange design change.<br /><br />so yeah i think they are cool...just wish they didnt have those problems"
3.0,"I really like this, my only problem with it was that it was too small but what I didn't get was why the left arm was wicked big and the right arm was super tight."
3.0,Expected longer in back
3.0,Pants good top not so much
3.0,My wife liked it but  the size chart is wrong on it it’s one size to small so order the next size up
3.0,"Sound quality is okay, the beanie is a bit tight"
3.0,"It stinks very bad. Placing next to your air purifier makes it scream. I find it difficult  to sit, squat or kneel. Otherwise it’s value for your money."
3.0,I'm 5' 7&#34; and 150 lbs. Had to return the dress- it was just way too short on me. Fit everywhere else perfectly but the length made me return it.
3.0,Bought these just to try out since they were cheap.  Used them once so far on an evening run where it was in the 30's.  For the most part the fit was good but my only complaint is with the single front seam.  All other compression tights I own have a dual front seam allowing the gentiles to sit comfortably.  The single front seam these ones have creates some bad camel toe action that is uncomfortable and unappealing to say the least.  The fabric does feel really good though and I like the pattern.
3.0,"When I think of a beanie I think of a knitted cap.  Unfortunately that is not what this is.  Because of the material it does not form to your head like a knitted cap does, so I felt like it just sat there on my head instead of being snug like I would have expected.  It's definitely my fault for not reading the information more thoroughly.  This type of hat may be great for others, but it just was not for me."
3.0,"These are cute although you get what you pay for. A little difficult to close on the two smaller pair and the smallest ones, the lever broke the second time I wore them."
3.0,"Looks good,  fashionable, and lightweight. Take note that's these glasses not NOT polarized, despite what the description says. If it were, LED screens would appear distorted which this doesn't. It does cut down on glare, so technically they do work. If you need polarized glasses, look elsewhere"
3.0,"The cuffs have unfinished edges, which I wasn't expecting based on the photos, but they'll do."
3.0,"Just what I wanted. Yellow, inexpensive rain protection."
3.0,Not the best of quality. Thin and screen sprinted.
3.0,Fit fine but looked older in person..the material
3.0,"Not a fan. I bought a large and more likely than not,  this fits like a medium."
3.0,Cute shirt for Disney World. Was a little larger than I wanted.
3.0,"This is so so pretty in my ear but it’s such a pain to take out if I leave it in for too long, I have to stretch my ear a little or turn it sideways to get it out because it’s so skinny in the middle"
3.0,"Maybe because I’m short, but this was very large and frumpy looking."
3.0,reviews said it ran small.  it will work at least for a little while before my 3 yr old outgrows it.
3.0,A little gaudy. Definitely looks like costume jewelry
3.0,"bracelet's cute and all. it has a nice quality to it and everything, but it's bigger than expected to be. i have average sized hands, not too big not too tiny but the bracelet seems to eat my whole arm."
3.0,It's not as nice as I thought it would be. It looks very cadual on. I expected it to be more dressy. Plus it fits a little bit tight but not enough to be uncomfortable.
3.0,"Seems like great socks with firm compression, but they are for thin legs."
3.0,Found material on the cheap side. Will be using for wedding
3.0,Print was cute but fabric was slick and uncomfortable.
3.0,Heavy but pretty
3.0,nice enough looking but the clasp broke as I took it out of the package- haven't determined how to fix
3.0,"Disappointed.  Runs small, and most likely will shrink in the wash."
3.0,"Cute style and length, thought the fabric would be a little thicker. Size was bigger than I thought/measured, I am definitely going to reorder again just in a smaller size. I am 5'6'' and 125lbs and I ordered a large cause i have wide hips. Going to reorder a medium."
3.0,I like the Coach look at the knock off price. This  shoe  is stiff and I'm certain that it is not a genuine Coach product. It looks great though. I wear a custom orthotic and this particular shoe does not accommodate it well. My original Coach shoes accommodate my custom orthotic perfectly.
3.0,"Cute dress, I didn’t like the side pockets, hits right on my hips. The dress runs small."
3.0,"I bought this for my husband who has trouble with his posture because of Parkinson's. He is pleased with the shirt, but would like to note that the hook and eye closures are most definitely not Parkinson's friendly. Maybe Velcro would be a better option. He gives it 3.5 stars, but there's no half option."
3.0,"Cute and nice material, but they do not stay up well."
3.0,Pretty dress. Just didn’t fit me well and I didn’t care for the material.
3.0,"It's cute, but not very breathable, but not many masks are..."
3.0,"This dress has a very flattering cut, it seems to fall very nicely. Likewise the skirt has a very cute flare that is very flattering. The sleeves are a very comfortable length, great for warmer weather because they are not too long, but they also cover the shoulder nicely. The fabric is a little bit cheap, but for the price it is definitely still worth buying (especially if you have a costume party to go to)."
3.0,"Muy buena tela, agradable, pero muy pequeña."
3.0,"I liked the ""heathered"" soft blue color in the picture but the shirt I received is a solid, weird bright blue color that's not so pretty on me :(  The shirt is kind of a boxy fit like a men's shirt.  The logo is nice and washed well.  Just wish it was the same color as pictured."
3.0,this is my secound pair.  Was so excited to get another after my daughter lost mine that I just slapped them in.  Only time since I was 7-years old that I got a lobe infection.
3.0,"I am a medium, sometimes a large just to fit a little loose. I love the colors in this purple. It fits large and very low. Its a thin light fabric."
3.0,For the price these are really cute.  They were purchased for my 9 year old and we ran into one problem.  The fabric is rather thin with minimal body.  With her skinny legs these boots would slouch all the way down to mid calf.  There are little buckle details at the top cuff.  I punched holes where there shouldn't be. This seems to be keeping them up toward the top of her calf.  Something else to note...these attract every strand of cat and dog hair.
3.0,Look good but came damage I needed to repare it
3.0,"If the cover was slightly larger and the pen holder in a different place this would rank 5 stars. I love the color, and the leather is buttery soft, but it's just too darn small! I can't fit the check register in, just the checks. And, I removed the pen holder so the cover would close better. Even with that removed, it still barely closes. Too bad :("
3.0,This product  is cotton not dri fit.
3.0,IT was very cute but I gave it three stars because it ran small... SO just keep that in mind when you order it!
3.0,The coloer is very dark. Wish I had sent them back.
3.0,"The chain is okay. It’s worth the price, in my opinion. It is a very nice looking piece from far away or for photography purposes (which is what I will be using it for so it works out for me)."
3.0,"OK, I have been using these sunglasses for a while now, it is time to review.<br />These are good for being in the sun and are 400 UV. It is advertised as polarized, but it is not polarized, so you will get glare, I did the polarize test and also took them to Oppenheimer's for them to check.  Don't get me wrong, I really like them a lot and use them for general use when I am out side. I have used them for driving and they do not stop glare bouncing off other cars or glare on the water so I use the driving glasses I purchased at the other place that is polarized and anti glare."
3.0,Too large and too thick. Not what I had hoped for
3.0,Product fit just fine that's too short not true the length will be sending that
3.0,nice light--could be a bit brighter.
3.0,Nice. Looks a bit cheap
3.0,Edge a tad sharp.  Scratched my leg up several times while wearing.
3.0,Very wrinkled in the package so not great for traveling. Not sure if I'll keep it yet.
3.0,See previous
3.0,"The sleeves Are odd. Like they are too short....they remind me of sleeves on little girls shirts. Otherwise the shirt is cute. Not a huge fan of the fabric. Expected all cotton, should have read the description maybe."
3.0,Tried today. My sons neck itched. Will not use again.
3.0,"This was cute, but really really really short."
3.0,The purse is way longer than it seems in the picture and the chain is too short. It barely passes my stomach. I had it on one shoulder.
3.0,It does not have the coverage like shown in the picture.  I think it is smaller.
3.0,The look is great it’s very cute just like the pictures the only down side is that I wanted a jacket that would keep me warm and this material is very cheep and will not keep me from being cold I’m very disappointed in how thin the fabric is🙁
3.0,The bracelet barely fits on my wrist. I am an average sized male.<br />Will measure more carefully....
3.0,"Exactly as the picture, really nice and trendy."
3.0,I'm 5'11 & Weigh 254. I normally wear an XL 16-18 but this material is pretty stretchy & the dress goes over my knees. i love the material & fit. Colors are what I expected them to be as well.
3.0,"I am totally satisfied with the look, feel, and weight of these lanyards. However, on at least one of them, the sliding part (to vary the length) was put on incorrectly. It slides back and forth with no effort at all. (The length of the lanyard can't be varied at all.) To move/stop the slider, i have to push the sides in, otherwise it just slips up and down. It's supposed to be the opposite. One is supposed to have to push the sides of the slider in to get it to move back and forth."
3.0,"this sweater is  good for 20.00 and worth 20.00 but that was the sale price, originally it was listed at 40.00 i would NOT pay that for a sweater thatnis NOT an authentic sanrio sweater, size is Youth sizing and runs small even for youths so get a large or above for everyone lol.  the hood and neck are very tight.  its made of a dry-fit type material so its not going to collect lint probably, will clean easily and hopefully wont shrink.."
3.0,The dress is nice and I liked the color but 3XL size still too small for me.
3.0,"Very thin, the quality is okay. I broke two trying to close them. I would recommend having someone else out them in."
3.0,Fabric has a good feel they fit a little small. But for the price not bad. The one thing that I do not like is the seem up the back its annoying and awkward feeling.
3.0,The fit a little tighter than I like and they didn’t have a built in bra.
3.0,"I wanted to like them so bad but they don’t have enough support, my feet hurt so bad !"
3.0,"The bracelet is very cute! I love the modern take on the idea of the classic pearl. It did, however arrive with the clasp broken (and bits of it missing, altogether o_O); thankfully, I was able to make a run to the craft store for an easy fix! And will get to enjoy it for my banquet, after all.<br /><br />My only feedback would be for folks to check for quality control, before they ship! I would have been disappointed, if this hadn’t been such an easy fix."
3.0,I didn't buy it for myself. I only bought it as a birthday present for a friend.
3.0,"So I bought this as a just in case jacket for a recent trip. It worked for what I bought it for. I didn't get a chance to wear the jacket in a hardcore rainstorm but in a little must it kept me dry. I don't think it would keep me dry for more then a couple minutes In a storm. I wouldn't call it water proof but more water repellent. The sizes are totally off. They run both short and small. I ordered a M, L, XL, & XXL. I ended up keeping the XXL. I am 6ft2 190lbs with a pretty athletic build. I can usually fit in a Medium size from most stores.  While a tall size shirt is not necessary I feel more comfortable in a tall size."
3.0,The socks came in for men's large but fit my wife's size 6 feet. They were too tight for me but also thin although she wore them they are going to wear out quickly. I returned my other order of them.
3.0,"I like the bag, but the overall size still requires me to go through a security check (Target Field - Mpls). I was hoping to avoid that. However, being clear, does speed up the process A LOT!"
3.0,"Light weight and comfortable feel, one thing not true to size."
3.0,Did not care for the clasp.  I would prefer individual clasps rather than &#34;all in one&#34; but it is exactly as pictured.
3.0,"They're much smaller/fit-wise than they appeared. High quality soft material though and warm. Although I couldn't properly wear due to fit, I gave them to my grandchildren age 10. Fits smaller than average"
3.0,I wasn't amazed by the quality of this product.
3.0,"These are completely flat and do not bend in any way around your face. They bleed a ton of light, and I found the wire frames to be flimsy and uncomfortable.<br /><br />However, the lenses themselves were nice and dark and the overall light weight feel of the sunglasses was a definite perk. They are also priced low, so if you just want some light weight throw aways, they would be a good buy."
3.0,I really liked this shirt but after a few washes the letters started to crack and peel. I liked it so much I will buy another and try a gentle cycle and maybe low heat dry to see if that makes a difference.
3.0,quality was not very good
3.0,"Super stretchy definitely fits, beware of you have bigger breasts then you will have some underboob showing through the cut out. The straps are really long so I had to shorten them"
3.0,Cheap fabric. Don’t wash other wise it’ll be ruined. Cute print.
3.0,It's cute but looks inexpensive and the chain was kinked.
3.0,I didn't get to use these. They were to big for my watch. They looked to be very well made.
3.0,The design and colors are amazing. The shirt itself is nice but the material is that kind that just sticks to you. Also I chose an xl and it fit like a medium so I would keep that in mind
3.0,Good deal for three set of earrings.
3.0,They are a little tight.
3.0,Very pretty but the first pair I wore got a hole in the toe...very disappointed!
3.0,Fit was great since I ordered a size down (5'6&#34;  34B  140lb and a SMALL fit perfect).  But the tan fabric was a little see through.  I returned it.  I might try a darker fabric.
3.0,"The girl in the picture made it look like a longer shirt when in all actuality , it just barely covers the tops of your pants"
3.0,"If you are plus size you will need a bunch of control top wear for this not only to fit properly, but to insure that your skin isn’t showing through its gaps.  The fabric is nice to look at but it has a texture to it that doesn’t necessarily cause itching but chafes against you constantly. There is a large hole (intentional) where the belt loops through and your skin will clearly be visible. It does wrap but the amount of wrap fabric is negligible so if you have a single curve to your body the dress will gap open at the snaps in front. I love the style, but thought wasn’t given to the design. Even if you’re thin, once you sit down the dress is going to gape open."
3.0,The body is small for how long the sleeves are I haven't worn it. It was a waste of money
3.0,"Size is good, but it tears easy and makes noise so not that good for hunting. Fine for hiking or camping though."
3.0,"Definitely see through,but nice fabric and comfortable!"
3.0,The bands are short so it must be complexity undone to get on and off and to put on charger.  A little more length would be nice
3.0,"It's OK but my husband's head is just too big for it. It was definitely made for a woman, child or small man. The neck warmer actually fit just fine."
3.0,The scarf and mittens were fine but the hat was way to small
3.0,"I have several pairs of these. All fit well but these. The black ones run ""small""  I can wear them but tighter than I really like. Best to order a size up if you choose this color"
3.0,"So cute, but unfortunately runs small/ short in the torso.  I will keep it for my younger daughter to grow into."
3.0,These are lovely for the price they are offered. ..
3.0,"The center diamond looks great and sparkly despite being included. However, not all side diamonds sparkle. The ring thickness at the bottom of the ring is drastically reduced. In addition, the center diamond is not set much higher than the two larger side diamonds. They are almost at the same level, unlike shown in the picture. It seems like the picture is computer created."
3.0,"The colors are really dull on the pink n blue camouflage suit. It it kinda does look like pajamas before you get into it. And I don't like how the top is sewn to the bottom, leaving the line or seam around the waist. I'm 5'11&#34; n 240 lbs and ordered the large cause it's all they had. I /It survived! Didn't get any compliments tho."
3.0,"Received a size other than what I ordered. Processing an exchange now, but the birthday party will be missed.<br />Hoodie seems a little thinner than expected."
3.0,Nylon material and is a long shirt and not a dress
3.0,came without the strap and was returned.
3.0,"shorter than the picture and went at my hips, I'm 5'7'', I was expecting it to be longer."
3.0,"I usually wear an S, but I ordered an L because of the reviews. I am 5'3 and 116 and this overall is very short, even in the L-size. The quality seems ok,for the price, but it is kind of odd, that it only has buttons on one side."
3.0,ise good qualityThey run a little small.  If we had washed and dried them they would not fit.  Otherwise good quality
3.0,We bought the smallest toddler size. They were big enough for my 9 year old almost. Sizes are way too large. They seemed nice other than that but we returned them. Buy at own risk.
3.0,This would have been perfect if the shirt where a little longer and not so sheer.  I am 5' 6&#34; and the shirt hit about 3-4 inches below my navel.  I would have liked it to hang a few inches longer.
3.0,"Love the glasses, the bow broke off opening it from package."
3.0,"It looks pretty good on, but the chains get tangles on each other and makes it look unintentional and cheap"
3.0,"got these gloves and for the money very disappointed the seam from the thum to first finger , I had to sow it and the plums<br />had to be sowed , I could have sent them back but worried the next pair would be the same.<br />Larry"
3.0,Bust area very small for size..rest of item very nice and good quality.
3.0,"Nice belts. The brown one I ordered was lighter than pictured which was disappointing. Once you cut for your measurement, it seems to lose some stability in the clasp where the belt is held to the buckle. Requires the occasional adjustment."
3.0,"I recommend them, they were just to wide for my baby's feet."
3.0,"poor quality, okay for a one day party"
3.0,"Very flimsy and cheap feeling, so we don't use them, we just keep them."
3.0,Too tight in my arms & chest.
3.0,kinda nice a little big and heavy for a kids necklace.
3.0,"Very small cazals.  Cheap make, like the gold onthe side doesnt even line up, nonetheless they are still fly and have good sun protection"
3.0,they are ok. a little too large for flats.
3.0,Light weight and nice fit. Too bad they came missing crystals from the side. Look very cheap.
3.0,Pretty but big! I have small(er) ears and these take up my whole ear.
3.0,Initially a good watch for my daughter. It quit working after about a month. Tried to change the battery with no luck.
3.0,"Decent jewlery for the price.  I'll agree with other reviewers that the gauge seems off (mine was smaller than expected), and that the color isn't really glossy as expected.<br /><br />No clue what they're referring to with the fractional inch measurements.  I ordered several pieces to finally get the size I wanted.<br /><br />The pieces I bought were all externally threaded, a common marker of low quality jewlery.<br /><br />Strangely, instead of having the threads cut into the end of the ring portion itself, there's a tiny threaded insert, what you'd normally see sticking out of the ball.  Weird.<br /><br />Looks decent, haven't scraped up the inside of any of my piercings putting these in yet, so whatever."
3.0,It’s thick material and fits fine but wish the material was nicer looking
3.0,I received two of one of the necklaces and I did not receive one of the necklaces pictured.
3.0,"The shirt is cute & fits well. The fabric of the shirt is a bit stiff, not soft. The seams around the cuff opening of the shirt are uneven, so the shirt goes inward where the seams are, instead of straight across."
3.0,Love the dress order it for a second dress for my birthday just a little tight on waist
3.0,This shirt is made well and breathable material but it's not a man's xl. I was able to wear it and I'm a women's medium-larger
3.0,Material is very soft with room for the bits. But I cannot just throw it in the washer and dryer. Item was returned.
3.0,"Might be good for airsoft or something, but I wanted to use this in the army and it's more of a costume. The places that should be velcro aren't even velcro"
3.0,They fit fine just a little more of a high rise around the waist than expected.
3.0,"Not made for winter, just for decoration."
3.0,I order a small/medium and they fit too big.
3.0,"I followed the previous reviews and ordered down a size. I’m 5’7 and 145-150 lbs. I ordered a size small. This skirt runs big. It’s really but the distress parts were cut a little to high for my liking in the back. You could see my underwear. Also, the skirt was extremely stiff. I had to wash it twice for it to loosen up."
3.0,I should of ordered a smaller size.  Doesn't fit well.  It is a beautiful blouse but too large.  I had to get it altered.
3.0,"This is super cute, I'm a sold size Medium in almost everything and this skirt is huge on me.  So big I'm not able to really wear it.  My hips are 39""..."
3.0,"I bought this belt for work, and not really happy with my purchase. The buckle itself is too bulky and not comfortable at all."
3.0,The material is very light so it's not black like it seems..
3.0,"Really like the versatility, but wish I had a bigger set - - to handle bigger studs, etc."
3.0,Very thin material. Must wear a cami or tank top underneath:((
3.0,"Went perfect with my vacation attire but on return home, a couple of the beads came off with the circle hooks missing. Have yet to try and fix it..."
3.0,These cubes are helpful for organizing.
3.0,Hurt and kind of gaudy.
3.0,"These bibs are a good size and work well for a relative. However, They are not the best quality - the terrycloth has loops not clustered together well, which makes for a non-plush fabric.  There are also some “striped” vacant areas where the loops are missing creating a bare area."
3.0,The waist is too high. Other than that it's a pretty dress.
3.0,"I only received the pants, not the shirt. The pants fit well, just disappointed about the shirt."
3.0,"This garment is very comfortable and nice looking.  I thought I ordered a XL but a L came in the mail, it's too small to wear as is but I'm going to order it again."
3.0,Looks better in the pictures tbh and kinda makes my ears itch but still nice I guess.
3.0,Not as stretchy/comfortable as I would have hoped
3.0,I’m 5 foot  98 lbs and usually wear extra small but this shit was too tight in chest and arms. A medium would work for me.<br />The color is a bit drab sent back.
3.0,They will shrink after a few washes.  Get one or two sizes bigger.
3.0,These run really small. I ordered the 6-24 month thinking we would have lots of room. Not true. Fit closer to a 9 month size. Double layered material so it won't show the diaper through. Good for pictures I think.
3.0,They are a decent pair of shades for the price. The biggest issue I had was the fact that they the came crooked. They don't sit super comfortable on my face and it is slightly noticeable that they are crooked.
3.0,"This is a really nice dress that I first bought in black.  The blue fits as well as the black version - very flattering and not clingy - but the material seems to be thinner.  You can see panty lines through this, so I'm very sad that I have to return it.  I can absolutely recommend this in black and other colors  that are darker may also be great.  This dress in black is a bargain and you should grab one before they're gone!"
3.0,Cute on the screen. Looks like iron on transfer in person. Different shades of black for graphic versus tank. Big in the armpits but maybe a little small everywhere else. Still a decent tank to wear with an overshirt.
3.0,I received the garment today.  It is cotton/polyester.  It is NOT linen and requires professional dry cleaning.
3.0,"Considero que la talla viene reducida, soy 40C<br />Y me quedo un poco ajustado"
3.0,The socks had a very strong perfume smell when they arrived.  You could smell them through the packaging.
3.0,"This is a perfect mask bandana, the only down part is that if you don’t put it right every time it will be sideways or off."
3.0,Adorable but runs small!!! I needed this for a vacation in July but was not able to wear. The shipping is extremely slow so I was unable to return it for a different size. Go up one size when ordering!
3.0,FIT AND COLOR WAS GOOD BUT JED NORTH LETTERING AND EMBLEM WAS PEELING OFF WHEN I WORE THEM FOR THE 1ST TIME AT THE GYM
3.0,Pretty good. Don't cling to me quite as well as more expensive brands but good for the money!
3.0,These have a great look to them and fit perfectly in the frames. My biggest complaint is how easily they scratch. I take excellent care of my classes and these manage to pick up fine scratches very easily no matter how hard I try to protect them.
3.0,The clothes
3.0,The handle was on the wrong side compared to the other stockings i own.
3.0,Too tight fitting
3.0,"I'm 5'2&#34;, 115lbs, normally wear a US size 2.  I ordered a small, and this dress was huge on me.  It fit like a size 6 or 8.  Going back!"
3.0,"Nice band, only thing I was unaware of was the fact the band is see-through."
3.0,"It runs a little tight in the arms, but otherwise, it's a pretty good value."
3.0,"Perfect size, perfect color gold. Very pretty. Was disappointed because they came with one earing stem bent. Still wear them, but not cool when you buy something and it comes damanged."
3.0,They are very cute. But the one I placed on my dog broke. Not from chewing but from shaking. Like when a dog is wet but she wasn't.
3.0,"This bathing suit is adorable. The problem is that the bottoms are tiny and the top is huge. I'm normally a small/ medium, size 4. I read the reviews and got a large. The large bottoms were super small in the hips and forget it if you have any sort of butt. So then I put the top on and it was hanging off. My normal bra size is 32 C (about average). The overall suit is super cute and will fit a very thin woman with large breasts."
3.0,"is bigger than it looks, and the picture was off center and faded, but for the price really cant be upset."
3.0,Comfortable but it looks like a big sack on. I wrote it with leggings and a cardigan.
3.0,This dress is so stretchy it looks frumpy. Disappointed with my purchase.
3.0,They broke so fast you put them on either they don’t hold on or they break apart
3.0,"Wish it would’ve been longer, like the model pictured."
3.0,great look and feel for my wife who i bought these for. but was ruined after one wash
3.0,my feet are narrow and i find the elastics too tight considering my feet arent wide. looks pretty on your feet but because its too snug it tends to get uncomfortable in the next few hours.
3.0,"Good color, length and fabric feel. It wrinkles a lot when washed and runs small in the waist."
3.0,Not real warm. Great for ankles
3.0,"I liked the size of the hoops, it’s perfect. However, the stones are dull and some are darker then others. I wish they were sparkly."
3.0,non-breathable fabric.  Doesn't stretch either.
3.0,Poor quality and the size was small
3.0,The item is kind of small.
3.0,"Wasn't as pictured. Different shade of green, different strap than the one in the model's picture, different zipper pulls than the white one pictured in the other review(can't really see them in the photos provided). The lining also makes a crunchy noise when you touch it. It's still kind of cute, but it's not what I thought I was paying for. Also looks smaller than the one in the model picture, maybe it's just me."
3.0,Watch is beautiful but I ordered red and they sent white
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:a4f3560005bd4edb7ae61045d42e5572]] Nice stylish shoe, material feels strong but not comfortable for more than couple hours work or standing jobs, no breathing holes (expect swede)"
3.0,"It fits as expected however, it comes very wrinkle and a few threads sticking out of the stitches. average quality for the price"
3.0,"The bag is the perfect size for my needs, but the material has torn just over the side shoe pocket- exposing the inside and rendering any waterproofing null."
3.0,"Maybe it's my ear shape, but these are sort of uncomfortable to wear. You really have to pinch them to get them to stay on. They look cool but I don't wear them much because of it."
3.0,"I ordered this along with the Smartwool Kid's Hiking Medium Crew sock, hoping it would be a much more affordable alternative. These socks are super thin, though, compared with the Smartwool medium weight sock, and also quite a bit bigger than the Smartwool &#34;small.&#34; If these fit my kid, I might have kept them, but for warmth, the Smartwool is probably worth the extra $."
3.0,The sandals are cute and the foam bottom is soft so it offers comfort for your foot but is very unstable while walking.
3.0,It fit great and it is cute. My only complaint would be that it is somewhat thin and does not fall with the creases as shown. You must constantly adjust it to look how it is intended to look.
3.0,"These are cute earrings.  They look inexpensive, so don’t expect anything amazing.  Just cute, small, fun fish."
3.0,After reading all the rave reviews I ordered a 3 pack of these yoga tops. The material is like something from a kmart discount rack. Not at all what I was expecting after reading about the superior quality. Don't waste your money.
3.0,"This dress has little stretch, fits much like a bag and feels like burlap. It’s not very comfortable to wear. It felt and looked like a potato sack. Also not very flattering to my body.<br />Got a size medium. Fit decently, besides how baggy it was and the feel of the material. Would have been wonderful in cotton!"
3.0,Bought this for an event. I like how the dress fit on the model but didnt look as close on me but I guess it all differs on the person's body type I'm 5'4&#34; 126lbs. the color is dull in person compared to the picture as well but all in all it was ok
3.0,"I'm not satisfied with the finishing of the scarf. The fringes look untidy, as if they had only cut the fabric and that's it. With the use,becaause of not having the appropriate termination, it will fray. The color and pattern is very nice, but it's not worth $ 38, is overpriced.  I'm glad I bought it in liquidation and paid very little, otherwise I would have returned it."
3.0,Faded significantly with pilling after first wear.  Foam in heel broke apart after first wear (max of 2-3 hours) at a water park.
3.0,Not as pink as shown
3.0,"Viking dress<br />Honestly I followed the sizing and based on it I should have ordered an XL but I'm usually a med-large.<br />I Listened to EVERYONE on the reviews ""buy a size up"" so I bought a large.<br /><br />When I tried it on it was WAY to big. Even my husband told me to return and reorder a small.<br /><br />I had my mom try it on about 5'9"" she instantly fell in love so I gave it to her, and she wears an XL it looked so much better on her length and all.<br />Ya'll I'm ordering a small."
3.0,The picture looked to be better quality then what it was but you get what you pay for. The eyes were crooked but they are just glued on.
3.0,Size 13 shoe here.<br /><br />The XL/L  do not fit.  Look elsewhere.
3.0,"Ordered this a couple months ago; still haven’t worn it. Cute but kinda big, the material seems nice"
3.0,This is too long and heavier than expected. The stone is too big too. Recommend to list the accurate stone size in the description. Definitely good quality for sure but not suitable.
3.0,it's a little bit wide - so probably a good fit for a more muscular or bigger boned kid
3.0,Meh. Fabric kinda strange.
3.0,"I love the soft neon color of the hair! However, the qaulity leaves much to be desired! They arrived with frayed ends and huge tangles, which are almost impossible to get out!"
3.0,"bought this for my nephew.. he loves Minecraft. this wallet is large and beautiful... however there is no money pocket(the long rectangle spot where people usually put their cash) that most regular wallets have!  what you see in the photo is literally what you get. i still think its very well made, but for the price, i feel a little disappointed.  i know he will still love it though."
3.0,"Nice top and it fits but material is thin.  I'd expected a different material that would keep the structure.  For reference, I am 5 feet, 118lbs, 36D."
3.0,"Runs a tad small and are a little see through, but great for layering."
3.0,Not good cotton socks. Doesn’t look like real cotton socks!!
3.0,"I bought it in both blue and the rust color. I wish it went up just 1 more size, it fit great everywhere except my chest which it was too tight on. I would have exchanged for a size up if there was one"
3.0,"I have muscular calves so they won't stay up, keep sliding down to my ankles"
3.0,"I bought this bra after hearing everywhere how it's the best nursing bra ever. I read it on mom blogs, had Facebook mom friends rave about it, and read the glowing reviews here on Amazon. It was on my wishlist way before my baby was born, but I waited until my milk had come in so I could buy the right size using the guidelines on their site. I've had it over a month now and it's never become my go-to bra. I really like the Kindred Bravely terry bras and prefer them over this one. It's hard to undo and close the clasp with one hand, and the cups fold down awkwardly so they always seems to get in my baby's way. I've only washed it twice and already the inside of the cups looks pilled. The racer back straps mean I can only wear it with a few shirts if I don't want visible straps. I love the fact that it pulls on so there are no hook and eye metal bits rubbing my back. I will continue to wear it since I have it, but wouldn't buy it again."
3.0,"I felt the shape of this shirt was weird. It fits, but it’s not like I expected. It’s okay and I wear it to work, but it is not my favorite."
3.0,Quality is laking
3.0,Not warm...too many holes for air to get in.
3.0,Feels flimsy like it will break within the first wear. Fingers crossed my husband gets some use out of it after opening.
3.0,Cute on. Runs a little small.
3.0,"Im loving using sock holders, especially in a colder environment. But one of the holders broke off on this like the 5th time I wore them."
3.0,It's too tight around the top but may be ok for a smaller chested person. The shorts are a thin lycra and very basic. The boy shorts are kind of high waisted and not very flattering so I wouldn't wear them without the low hanging top.
3.0,It’s really cute but the ball spins off very easy. I recommend glueing the ball onto the chain.
3.0,"Cheap and thin, if you're just looking for foot coverage then this is for you, but if you want substance when it comes to sock then keep looking"
3.0,"This was smaller than I expected; I'd bought a few infinity scarves at the same time and this was the smallest of the bunch. Nice soft material, good knit... I'll definitely use it, but I don't think I'll be able to use it as I'd originally intended unless it stretches over time."
3.0,"Little scratchy, but fine after a couple washes. Love the style and color. Fits exactly the way I want it to."
3.0,I didn't expect it to be so little not knowing the size but it worked out fine the way I wanted it to be worn.
3.0,It's cute but if you want it to fit like the picture order 2 or 3 sizes bigger than usual
3.0,"There was a hole at the shoulder seam, so I had to send it back."
3.0,"this is a beautiful bracelet, but it is not rose gold like it was suppose to be, it is gold coloration.  After wearing these bracelets for a week and a half they started turning my wrists green.  I no longer wear these bracelets"
3.0,It's nice better than nothing but is worth your moneys worth my zipper broke easy
3.0,"These are reminiscent of silk underwear. They are also small....My 8 year old doesn't like these. The colors are great, though!"
3.0,"Runs a size smaller, so I returned it for one size larger. Looks just like the photo and quality is great, but the stitching is the worst. Lost two buttons within a days use."
3.0,good product but much smaller than expected.
3.0,love the material and how it looked. ordered a small and it was way too big on me. the waist line wouldn’t even stay up. i had to shrink them.
3.0,The gloves are very heavy. And I did not like you displaying multi-colored gloves but the only color I could actually get was black.
3.0,"Pros:<br />Seem pretty tough to rip<br />Lots of pockets<br />Seller provides great customer service. The price dropped by $5 the day after I ordered them. I messaged the seller and asked if I could be credited for the difference and they did with no problems.<br /><br />Cons:<br />They don't clean up very easily, other reviewers have stated they clean up very well. I got some grease on mine, sprayed with an automotive degreaser, scrubbed, and still couldn't the stains out.<br />The sizing in inconsistent, I ordered a pair of beige and a pair of grey both the same size and the beige pair is noticeably tighter."
3.0,The shirt ran short.  It hit right at the top of my midrise jeans.  Also the knot is directly in front so made me look like I had a large stomach.  Also the material was rather thin and see through.  I returned the product without hassle.
3.0,Love the colors but the fit is small and hardly any give in the band.
3.0,They are a little too long to wear with a shorter dress.  I can o my wear them with a maxi dress or a longer style dress.
3.0,"The fit was as expected, but I expected it to be large per the other reviews recommending to buy one size up.  Which worked out well.  The feel of the short was good, meaning decently made but the stiching on the shelves was incredibly scratchy.<br /><br />However, I was really disappointed when after washing the shirt, in cold water, all of the gold in the emblem came off!  It now looks like I am Kirk from the opposite universe I guess. For as expensive as this shirt was I didn't think I'd be wearing it only once."
3.0,"not what I expected, i should read the description better, my fault."
3.0,Stoned missing and falling out just trying to mold to me teeth
3.0,"I was ok, and risked it. The shorts fit great but the top was 3x larger."
3.0,"Although I am not Catholic I have always believed in the power of prayer, this Rosary has brought some peace to my hear."
3.0,Didn’t love the fit. Good quality.
3.0,"For a 2xl, it was not as roomy as expected especially having wide shoulders."
3.0,"the shoe itself was well worth the price tag. unfortunately, I did return the shoe, due to a strong odor, as previously mentioned by another customer"
3.0,This is a well-made metal adapter but it is not M25 to RMS. It is male 25mm to female 20mm. If that is what you look for it works great.
3.0,It works some of the time. I think it helps if you let it dry before getting in the pool.. Also 1/2 of it spilled out in the shipping of this product. Best to buy it locally.
3.0,"The heart isn’t actually inside a bottle, it’s just glued to the middle of an outline of a bottle. Bought as a gift for my little sister, she still liked it but it wasn’t what I expected it to be."
3.0,"The dress gives a nice, casual fit flare. The cotton fabric can be dressed up or for casual wear. I wish the mid section at the bottom end of cut-out triangle was not too elastic. I had too much space and it looks unflattering to see an elastic band, which is why I didn't choose the red color. I felt the black color would hide that aspect a bit. I am going to exchange for a smaller size due to the loose fabric around the cut-out area."
3.0,"First I will say I wanted to like this bra. It was stiitched well and the over all quality was ok. But it isn’t at all supportive , but this could have been remedied by using more compressive material . I returned it & was promptly refunded .  If you want a light lounge bra & you have big boobs i’d buy it. It just doesn’t work for me."
3.0,Fit bigger than expected and did not flatter my small waistline. The fabric is comfortable and the dress flows and is a pretty color
3.0,It is a good deal for the price but the fit is awkward. It runs a bit large and it makes it unflattering
3.0,Love this but its cut way small for a busty girl. I'm a DDD and the largest size was not for me...
3.0,These are cute but run small and because of this is looked like a diaper on me!  Maybe a larger size would look better but I think these shorts work better for super skinny girls.
3.0,I was really disappointed in this set
3.0,"Heads up, the pants are like a stretchy non cotton material. Almost like spandex? Not a fan of the feeling."
3.0,wasn't long enough and material was very thin. I'm a curvy medium but this fit like a small and wasn't flattering. I don't think buying a larger size would have made a difference. I believe it's better suited for someone with a smaller frame.
3.0,The size and colors are perfect but the material is rough and uncomfortable.
3.0,"First - the good.  These shoes are cute.  C-U-T-E cute.  The velcro clasp is easy for independent dressers and the embellishments are absolutely adorable.  There is one major detail, however, that you should be aware of before buying this shoe.  The Amazon review states: ""Its cushy footbed is outfitted with a fun squeaker..."" and it is true!  Not just a gentle squeak-squeak like rubber shoes on a waxed floor.  Think more like a dog toy squeaker - it is that loud!  My daughter would have loved to wear these everywhere, but since I don't want her preschool teachers to hate us, I had to return these.  I wish they came without the squeak toy inside!"
3.0,"It’s the perfect length in the front, but the back is longer than i was expecting.  Super comfy"
3.0,The dress itself is beautiful however I did have to fix quite a bit. The circles on the bodest ended up falling exactly on top of the breast looking like nipples. The gold “ribbon” that circles it only made it look more so. I decided to change the “ribbon” which as actually just a cheap rope. So I hand beaded the the rope details over with gems. The train was about 5-5 1/2 ft long. I cut it  off and altered it to just slightly resting above the ground with about a two inch train in the back with a hoop petticoat under. So I was left with enough material I cut out two gold pieces of the scrape and replaced the pink circles on the breasts with the gold material. I did have to take it in a bit cause it was about 1 size too big. Even though I sent all my very detailed measurements. So if you altered it it has amazing potential. It kind of reminds me of those cheap costumes you get from party city for an a huge amount. If I didn’t have sewing skills it wouldn’t have made it worth it. I give it a three star just because it ended up beautiful after all the altering. The second picture is me with just a basic petticoat under it.
3.0,I have multiple piercings in each ear and these earrings are nice to have all in one time because they don't irritate my sensitive ears or hurt when I'm sleeping or have ear muffs on. They are hard to open and they are very thin so they bend and deform easily and are even harder to close once in my ears. Occasionally they will hook up on each other and get caught on my hair because I couldn't close them fully.
3.0,"The 10’s were super huge and super narrow, even in medium size. The 9.5’s we’re super small and super narrow, even in medium. They do offer a wide, but I suspect their wide fits like regular. I have a pretty narrow foot just FYI"
3.0,"I have this top in a sm, and I also ordered it in a med. the only difference in the size is the med is maybe it's about 2 inches longer ,but seems to fit tighter."
3.0,"Cute shirt and nice material, but runs small. It was too tight for my daughter."
3.0,The skirt was nice but way too poofy and the material was a bit stiff.
3.0,Chain is thick and necklace is more bulky than I anticipated.
3.0,I thought this would be a little thicker / bulkier as images in photos but it’s very very thin and Light in weight to the point that I’m worried it will break easily within the first or second time I wear it. Also the color is off- even for costume jewelry… it’s very yellowish and bright.
3.0,Dress has pretty colors but it’s very cheap material! And short short short! I hate it actually! Only good thing is the pretty pattern and colors. Everything else is just bad
3.0,"Definitely not US sizing. 34&#34; waist and I normally wear a medium in most, but got an XL in these based on the other reviews. They're wearable, but very snug."
3.0,not great material not true to size it’s ok for casual but not dress enough.
3.0,This item arrived with yellowish  stains on it.  It was a birthday gift so my daughter refuses to return it as she waited for it for sometime. Just disappointed. It came in a sealed plastic bag but the white over coat has big yellow/brown stains.
3.0,I ordered this in an xl and it was too short. I’m almost 5’9 and the top part that supposed to be under the collarbone was at my nipples. Very cute suit though! Good material and great pattern. Returned it.
3.0,"The sides of the breasts that are the arm holes seem to be cut in too much towards the chest, revealing more side-b@@b.  Why???"
3.0,Analog is a little off.
3.0,I liked the dress and material but not the ruffle at the bottom. The top elastic fit perfect but just not as much as I thought I would due to my own body issues. Will still wear it.
3.0,"I like it but it seems that it was packaged carelessly. I had a missing button, the watch was out of its container in the package. The container was bent and there was a minor stain mark of some sticky substance. Other then that, i do like the watch"
3.0,Travels easily. Doesn’t fold back out as nicely as I would have liked.
3.0,what did i exspect cheap.
3.0,I would recommend this product to anyone over 5ft. 7in. Otherwise you are out of luck. You'll be walking on your pants.
3.0,"It is a nice style. Great price. Fabric fair. Size is a little snug. Color is not what was described/labeled. I have been trying to return it, but no invoice or return label came with it. It has Been harder to figure outhow to ship back."
3.0,Paper thin. Not reusable
3.0,I liked this top when I ordered it. When I received it the fit does not look as it appears in the pic. It's really short it doesn't look as good. I ended up cutting out the sleeve and using it as swim suit cover up top.  If you like the look of the pic and how it looks on the model don't buy. It doesn't look that way. If it doesn't matter to you. Then it's the top for. The color is true to the pic the material is thin. Is a good summer top. Just the length is way off.
3.0,"No buttons, only a strap to hold the top."
3.0,Miss how the used to make this brand.
3.0,I loved it I thought it was super cute and super sweet idea especially because my mother loves sunflowers very much when we got it I was a little concerned that she might not like it because the flowers look like they are clay and they look very brittle but otherwise I love them they needed a little bit of a touchup as to cleaning they were a little dirty but that is not some thing that I can’t handle other than that it was beautiful the ring fit I love the idea of having an adjustable ring the earrings were super pretty and I loved everything about it
3.0,It does not stay closed. My luck with amazon purchases lately have been terrible.<br />I would love the band if it didn't unlatch all the time. Super annoying especially while I'm at work. :(
3.0,son bonitos pero me acaban de llegar y estan quebrados
3.0,"Not too bad of an outfit. The only cons are the fabric definitely feels cheap, and it does not fit me in the bust area at all, everywhere else was fine. Put on a petticoat underneath and it's pretty cute."
3.0,usually 2x fit me but this one was too small altho the dress is very nice it was not the right fit
3.0,Child chose it but didn't like it when she put it on. 😕
3.0,The strings to tie are to short!
3.0,To small in the breast area. Not true to size. Buy a size bigger. Not to happy. Cute top. Fited.
3.0,"Rated the vest a 3 due to it not running true to size.  Purchased a large and would need at least an XL if not a 2X, had to return."
3.0,LOVED THESE! JUST WHAT I NEEDED TO MAKE MY SCARFS.
3.0,"Bought this as a gift for my grandfather. Although it is good quality and the color is true to the picture, it did fit him way too big on his head despite ordering a small size. Luckily Amazon sells hat size reducers separately for a cheap price and was able to use it to make it fit just right."
3.0,"These glasses are very cute. They look just as pictured and fit well. I like how thin the frame is because I don't feel I'd get a headache wearing these for extended periods of time. Personally, I'd prefer a little bit more of a pointed cat-eye look, but they are still adorable and classy. The only reason I gave these three stars rather than five is because for the price ($12), they feel incredibly cheap. They feel like $3 glasses. I wouldn't recommend based on that observation, but I would for the fit and style. I would've given a five star review if these were half the price."
3.0,Received one ankle bracelet when I assumed two as sandals are listed plural
3.0,"From the price and the picture, I just assumed there would be some sequins or other texture to this purse. In receiving it, I am really very dissappointed in the product. NOT worth the price they are charging. Just not very nice. The chain and handle are very cheap looking and the material is just snakeskin color, no texture. Guess you can't judge something by the cost..."
3.0,"I bought the black for a basic work dress, knowing with the low cost I might be disappointed. I was the dress is incredibly cheap looking and fit oddly. Would not recommend."
3.0,Original review stated package did not arrive. Checked around again and located it some distance from mail box. Masks seem to work.
3.0,"This is a cute hat, but be aware that the rhinestone charm is not clear and silver tone, as pictured, it is a bright gold color with rhinestones. The texture of the fabric feels high quality, and the design is flattering, but I just wish the description had been more accurate. I considered returning this hat, but ended up removing the band and the rhinestone charm, and it looks okay now. I have another hat from this brand Siggi that I love, and they have some well-made, cute styles that seem to really protect well from the sun, but this just was not my favorite."
3.0,"Since I have some other Mariana pieces, I knew for the price it wouldn't be very large, but still was smaller than I envisioned.  I was disappointed because when it arrived the small  &#34;Stone&#34; that is at the end of the clasp was broken off.  Also the clasp itself doesn't seem to close tight.  I hope it won't be a problem.  However, it is a beautiful color/cross.  Very pretty."
3.0,"Love this ring. After a few weeks it has not lost any stones nor bent out of shape. I wear it with my grandmother’s wedding ring and it looks great. Ordered it too big as that was the only option, but better than too small.<br />I am not permitted to leave a review even though I am a verified purchaser of this item; I had to go to my order and click my way through several non-explicatory processes.<br />Am leaving the three-star review as I am not amused at the restrictions placed on my ability to leave a review."
3.0,I love the shirt but I ordered two sizes larger because of cotton shrinking and it’s a good thing because it just barely fits. Now I have to lay flat to dry after washing. Not pleased with this!!
3.0,[[VIDEOID:f272544bad3cf71eec3885739c17aaba]] I was hoping to get a more yellow toned pearl like the one in the picture. And the metal is so bad its going to tarnish between the first two wears… not worth the money
3.0,"I paid 21.00 for this pair of socks and there was a suggested retail value of 14.00. I was expecting an adult size small. These socks were in a youth size. The quality is fine, however I paid for adult size and received youth size. I will read more carefully next time."
3.0,"i ordered this 2 inches bigger then i needed, but it just fits"
3.0,"It's ok. It is a little too snug for me, but it is useable."
3.0,"Cute, but flimsy!"
3.0,I purchased my first order with the all black trio about a month or so ago. I loved them and still love them.<br /><br />Then I I bought the marble trio and I just dont understand the quality difference. The marble ones feel smaller even though they're the same size. The material is different AND they are see through. So disappointed.
3.0,"The buckle is great, nice and sturdy, works every time. Not a fan of the belt though. It is thin and not sturdy. Not sure how long the belt will last."
3.0,Needs to be wound up everyday to keep time.Dont recommend this
3.0,The sizes are way off.
3.0,This was alright for me. The body is suede and the gold chain is of better quality then the rest. The outer pocket is very convenient to have because I always lose my phone in the bag.  A little shiny in my opinion though.<br />However I do not think ts very practical especially for moms who need the extra space! I believe this is more suited towards younger girls who are starting to carry larger bags.<br />It came with a little plastic string bag which is always good to have!
3.0,These earrings are beautiful and for the price is reasonable. The only problem I have with the earrings are the backings are too loose. There is a high chance of losing your earring because the backing is loose.
3.0,"Cute shirt,  kind of faded picture. I am a size medium adult woman with bra size 34DDD and I just tried this girls 5/6 shirt on and it fits lol"
3.0,I have many masks. This one did not fit as snugly on the bottom as the others I have ..its pretty but its important to fit properly..I was disappointed about that and will not wear it when I go to doctor appointments. Will only wear on my daily walks.
3.0,My bra size is 40DDD and i wear an L/XL shirt. I ordered a 2XL and it was a bit too tight for me even with the padding removed. The back is nice and long like a crop top but it still rolled up and constantly having to pull it down is annoying. It's made out of nice thick fabric which is good. Wish it fit looser :( .
3.0,"Fun, stretchy, a little snug I thought for the size...I ordered up for a looser fit but I needed the room. I like them and will buy again."
3.0,I purchased the smallest size but it was still too much sleeve for my daughter.  Granted she's not an average sized 1yr old. She's 15.5lbs 26.5in. I did manage to make it work.  I took some elastic and drew them up. The shorts fit perfectly as did the length of the onsie
3.0,Too small order up about 2 sizes
3.0,"Shrunk to a smaller size, almost ankle socks now."
3.0,I like the style a lot. But I wish the teardrop was just a little bigger.
3.0,I like this sports bra for everyday. I would not wear it to run in. I got my size and if I wanted a running bra I'd order a cup size down. It is cute and it fit well.
3.0,Son bonitos .pero eso de baño de oro nonloncreo .el material se ve bien cheaper
3.0,"Just ok.. hat is huge and completely wrinkled up, other items good!"
3.0,"The description says the sunglasses are black on the outside and red on the inside. There is nobody that I know that would call this color red. The interior is brown. While it is a reddish brown, it's definitely brown. I'm disappointed but I'm keeping them since they are cute and I've run out of time - my vacation in the sun is coming up fast."
3.0,The top fit as expected. The bottoms were a little smaller than expected. But it’s a great layout suit!!
3.0,Well they work but not that much
3.0,Comodidad pero corta durabilidad
3.0,"I like the item, but I would have liked it more if it wasn't so long (I've modified it). Plus it makes loud clanking sounds when you are holding your keys or driving, etc."
3.0,"Wore this at Mardi Gras, really cool, but only lasted a couple nights."
3.0,It's much larger than I expected
3.0,"This is a beautiful ring but fragile where the 3 rings connect to each other at the bottom. The stacks are not individual, but are connected with a small silver tab at the bottom.  One tab was broken upon receipt leaving the band sharp at the break. It would be better if they sold it as a true “stacking” ring and left the bands separate. It would give you the flexibility to wear it wider or narrower.  I was disappointed that I had to return it."
3.0,Nice shirt couldn't wait to get it but the xlarge I bought fits like a large.
3.0,Sadly this top didn't fit me. I ordered two colors: the burgundy with flowers and the blue and white striped. Both of them were too small because I don't think they were meant for 34DD (which is odd because I normally wear a small or medium but the top was super tight on me even though I ordered one size fits all). Super cute tops though!
3.0,"Material was heavy which made it uncomfortable for me. Altho it’s well made no complaints there. I’m looking for more of a cotton feel soft to the touch. The fit is perfect, large is just that. I was glad it didn’t have any tight spots, bust, waste, hips. I’m 5’2 so the length is long, I may have to hem so the dress hits above my anckles."
3.0,"I ordered an XS, my typical size. While it is not uncomfortable to wear, it is a little tight at the chest even though I am only a 32A. My problem was that the coat arrived with wrinkles. I tried to iron it out, but the material does not respond well to ironing. Frustrated, I sent it back"
3.0,"I'm debating on whether or not to keep it. I love the fabric, design, style, everything. The one problem are the straps are so close to the zipper. Seems like not a big deal, until you go to use it. You can't just zip it up in a hurry. You have to sit it down and make sure all 4 straps are pulled away from the zipper. I can't believe that passed the design phase. It's completely irritating and such an easy fix. I'm really disappointed."
3.0,"Too tight in midsection. You’ll risk looking like a busted can of biscuits is you don’t have the proportions, So double check the measurements.  If you're busty, will be difficult  get top on, will need assistance to secure the back. Total fail couldn’t even wear it. Giving 3 stars because I may be able to swing it after a BBL and breast reduction.<br />I’m 5’2’’ 140lbs 36DD"
3.0,The mesh was a lot darker than my skin so it looked weird. Other than that beautiful color and fit.
3.0,I am slightly smaller in the chest area which made this dress bunch up on the top. It was very unflattering. I returned the item with no issues.
3.0,"Dress is cute but runs extremely big, go down at least one size."
3.0,"Glasses look nice, but broke the second time My son used them."
3.0,"Not really as expected, but still okay"
3.0,"This was going to be my Christmas dress, but unfortunately it's a smidge too tight. (I got the 3XL) to be on the safe side...well I'll definitely be able to fit it next Christmas for sure. Also feels like swimsuit material btw and it's too small in the boobies area. (Got a 3xl and the boobies portion looks like a ""A"" cup size...weird but okay. Length is amazing for a tall person."
3.0,"Way too big.  Pretty, a person wearing plus sizes would be able to wear it.  It swallows me whole! worth the money."
3.0,I ordered beige and it's not the beige in the picture. It looks like a yellowish nicotine stained color. Not very attractive.
3.0,It was kind of silly looking when I put it on.
3.0,"I read a lot of reviews about the bottoms being small so I ordered a size large instead of a medium. I still could have gone up a size! They were pretty tight around the waist and were slightly unflattering. I love the colors and the cut was what I expected, but due to the small size I will be returning."
3.0,"These are super cute and fit well, But- they for up Immediately and then condensation develops, so they are quickly no longer transparent. I’m getting some glasses defogger and I’m hoping it works"
3.0,They are cute but the white looks rather chintzy~ I personally think I would have liked it in black and silver instead. They also make my ears itch a little so I rarely wear them.
3.0,Very snug to get over head.
3.0,"Too small, order up but nice shirt"
3.0,Hat got a little wet and lost its shape
3.0,"Nice material, daughter said they fit well. BUT after wearing 2x the inside piece (slip) already came out! This seems to be the problem with a lot of swimming shoes but i was hoping these were different. I will add that the inside without the slip is still better than others but ..still not the point! I do like the rubber bottom; it seems thick enough vs cheaper ones ( from like walmart) and flexes with ease."
3.0,The dress is okay it see thru and run big I ordered a large and it fits okay I could have order a Med I guess. It's a good item to used for a swimming suit cover up.
3.0,I’m using them on my Red Wing Iron Ranger 8085 boots. After two weeks they are fraying where they feed through the speed hooks.
3.0,"The sweatshirt is not exactly what I was expecting to receive. It is comfortable and stretchy, but it is very thin. As you can see from the picture I posted, but it only says it says. The sleeves are a little bit short on me and I normally wear a small. This is a large so it definitely requires you to wear a size up. If you are typically a large, I'm not sure that this would be a good choice for you. I do not have exceptionally long arms either. I cannot comment on what the material is because that tag is the only tag inside the shirt. I haven't washed it yet because I'm a little bit scared too. If it shrinks my son will probably be the one to wear this."
3.0,"Visually pleasing, and was beautiful for the first 4 days. But the metal,being so cheap, broke off very easy and now my ring is broken :("
3.0,I have 2 in black-love them. Bought the green. It’s more of a bright green. Bought gray and it’s almost purple. Stick with black!
3.0,Thin and not what I pictured.
3.0,It’s more sheer than is represented in the picture.  Arm holes are a bit low.  Pockets are a bit highly placed.
3.0,Cute but the plastic has a smell
3.0,Fabric is not great feeling and too small. Get what you pay for.
3.0,They're ok.Not great but not bad either
3.0,"The shirt is not well made. You can get away with it if someone's not too close, but it's not a polished piece of work. I got the blue shirt and it wasn't the same dark shade of blue that the picture shows and I'm about the same complexion as the model too. My sister liked it on me and from afar, it looks nice but whoever made this could definitely do better at making sure string isn't sticking out along with the mesh at the top part of the shirt."
3.0,"Super cute shirt and will buy smaller size but that is inconvenient and had to pay return shipping. I ordered a Medium, I am 5'2 130 lbs- the shirt is swimming on me! I buy a lot of size Mediums."
3.0,Beautiful and too large than what it looks like in the picture
3.0,Runs small very thin. Smelled funny
3.0,"Usually I don't give reviews, however I think this product deserve one. I like the watch for the price. The bad news is the watch has many scratches, and sharp edges on the back cover. There's one such sharp edge by the stem, so winding the watch has become a problem. In three days the watch has gained four minutes. I'll be returning it for an exchange."
3.0,Top was cute but it was too baggy up top and too short for my comfort. I’m 5’3 and weigh about 120 and usually wear a small or extra small
3.0,"Not comfortable, dislike the material"
3.0,Dragging on the ground or caught under my shoe.
3.0,Runs large but I read that before ordering. I love the fit. It’s heavy fabric but breathable cause it’s flowy. Don’t get the white one unless you want everyone to know what you look like naked. I’m returning and ordering in black.
3.0,The socks feel good but they're way too small. I gave mine to an 8 year old and they fit the child.
3.0,"Waist is too high, dress feels longer at the front than at the back."
3.0,"The fit of this seems like it’s meant for flat-chested women because, if you actually have boobs, the hem across the front sits on top, or in front, of them, then hangs weird 🤨"
3.0,they break easily and the color comes off
3.0,"The only satisfying thing is its size. But overall I would not call it a quality product. The color is dull, not as bright as shown on the Amazon. I wouldn’t even call it a sweater TBH. It looks and feels more like a sweatshirt. If I had seen this before I placed the order, I wouldn’t have bought it. Overall 3/5."
3.0,"These are good quality. Slick material until after washed. Lightweight, thin sock."
3.0,"I wear a large in just about everything I order.  The reviews said that the jacket runs small, so I ordered a 3XL just to be safe.  The jacket was still way too small, I gave it to my 12 year old daughter.  Do not buy unless you are a naturally petite person."
3.0,I ordered the us equivalent of xl but it was too small in the bust. Pity for the money it was a nice set of pjs.
3.0,"I'm losing weight so not positive I am completely a large. My tummy protrudes from pregnancy and 38DD. Im 5'8"" a working out 196ib. Can't fasten bust part. The buttons on my wast come open when I sit down. I don't like how the neckline is made. I'm hoping to shrink down some more this winter and wear a scarf with it."
3.0,Love this dress! My only complaint is that it's see thru...
3.0,Love the fabric would buy again still a bit long but manageable.
3.0,Pants came with the crotch ripped out.  Were they already worn?  Or is this how their products come...unfinished?
3.0,"The tail of the belt is too long.  I define the tail as the end of the belt that extends out of the buckle. To remedy this, they should have the notched area extend 1-2 inches toward the end of the belt."
3.0,Shirts fit smaller than I thought they would be.
3.0,Boobs kept falling out the dress too big
3.0,This hoodie isn’t thick it’s thin! So if your looking for it to keep you warm it’s think for a hoodie! Graphics are pretty good as depicted in picture!
3.0,"Nice bag but once my stuff put in, it became too heavy. Found out it's on my sisters WANT list. I'm going to give it to her."
3.0,"The watch has a nice look and feel, very light weight. It also came with two bead bracelets but due to the tight packaging, some of the beads were already broken. :( The leather strap is soft but I wish it had a better finish on the side that comes into contact with your skin, since I can see that part wearing down over time. Overall, the quality is a fair match for the price."
3.0,it's ok !!!
3.0,I do like this raincoat and for the price it’s pretty good. I got caught in a huge downpour and this jacket kept me dry but the water held a little in the fabric rather than running right off of it. The important part is that it kept me dry but I prefer rain jackets I can shake off and the water all comes off. I am 5’4” 137 lbs medium was very roomy on me. The hood is a nice size. It’s great for light to medium rain. I’m wearing it while walking today because there’s a chance of rain. The pockets are a nice size. Overall it’s decent and it does keep you dry in heavy rain. It hits right above the knee cap on me. It’s good for layering because it’s a little big. I’m wearing it in 51 degree weather right now and it’s cutting the wind. I Don’t find it to be very breathable in 80 degree weather when I got caught in the rain.
3.0,"These are nice. However, one ripped the first time I used it and one seems to be bigger than the others. Overall good for wearing at night to keep hair from breaking."
3.0,"Nice tie but will definitely break down and come apart after about 6 months or a year, depending on wear.<br />Nice looking and cheap though, if you want to go through ties"
3.0,Not sure this does anything
3.0,"Cute, worked well in heels & went with my outfit but they rolled down the entire night. They were knee highs by 10 pm rather than thigh highs 😔"
3.0,"Es bonito, pero el color no es igual al de la imagen"
3.0,cute dress but didn't like how heavy and stiff the fabric was--returned it
3.0,These are just adorable and well made. What a shame that the sizing is wrong. I am 5’5 - 5’6 and 105 With 23” waist and 32” hips. These were way too small.
3.0,Very cute designs.<br />Calf area is cut very narrow....<br />More of a casual sock than true compression material......the top band cut into my leg by the end of the day.<br /><br />If you are looking for light support and have thin legs they are fine.<br /><br />Would not recommend for anyone who has edema.
3.0,They are very cute. They fit true to size leaning on the large size. But I took two stars off because there was a piece of chewed gum in the slipper. Gross!!! It took me a minute to figure out what it was 🤢.
3.0,It’s okay. It is soft but it doesn’t really flare...it’s more of a straight but not tight skirt. I’ll wear it occasionally.
3.0,Had them stretched
3.0,"Don't really like the material, I wish it was stronger- also, the size it's small, it won't fit someone size 8-9 properly. When I ordered them it said it was for sizes 6-9- it's not-"
3.0,Very nice feel but already had to fix it like 3 time because it comes apart very easily.
3.0,had to take this to a jewler to replace. luckily they didn't charge me.
3.0,The natural stone looks like artificial.
3.0,"This top is large side to side, but short in the torso."
3.0,"Semi-functional, but flimsy."
3.0,"Beautiful well made dress, unfortunately the size 3X was more along the lines of an American medium.  It was way too short and and way too tight.  I passed it on to a friend.  I'm only 5'5&#34; so I generally don't have problems with length.  I took my measurements before ordering, so the 3X should have fit.  I will conceded that I could zip it up, but....."
3.0,Bonito?pero fácil de romper el fierro que entra en el oído
3.0,"I love this, but wish it were made in regular US sizing. Order way up from your normal size. This dress would not be flattering on anyone with tummy or back weight."
3.0,"This purse is attractive and I got a lot of compliments on it, -  but it is bulky, the inner lining wants to push out the sides, the strap is hard to keep straight coming out of the inside of the bag and the strap broke loose from the bag the first time I carried it. I can resew the strap to the bag and will keep it to carry on special occasions. Even though it is bulky, it does not hold much, so best for dressy evening outings. Definitely not a bag for everyday use."
3.0,"Dress runs small very small! It was extremely snug on me and it was my normal size. I could not even get it over my shoulders.<br />I ordered this in order to review it. I knew that if it ran small I have family and friends that would be able to use it. Once I had someone try it on, I was able to get a better idea of how it looks on a person. On my best friend, it looked AWESOME! As a matter of fact, I had her try it on with sandals and jewelry and it was perfect for a day wedding.What surprised me is that the dress was an XL and my friend is a Medium. She is thrilled to have a new dress!<br />The dress is black with a peep hole at the neckline. It is cotton so it is easy to clean and take care of. Just toss in the washer and dryer and your done. No dry cleaning needed.<br /><br />I ordered this item to review and received it free or at a steep discount.<br />[[ASIN:B01EFCOC3O Summer Dresses,Laksmi Women's Short Sleeve Stretch Pure Color Scoop Neck Basic Flare Homecoming Dress Plus Size,X-Large Black]]"
3.0,Hard to put on and buckle and the feel was uncomfortable on my wrist.
3.0,"The posts are well made,  however when I opened the package for the first time I found half of the gems had come unglued. These were so cheap,  I think this is a case of you get what you pay for."
3.0,"The watch looks nice, but I’m unsure of the quality until I hear from my husband. However, shipping was terrible!!! It came in an envelope with no protection. Luckily, the screen wasn’t broken or shattered from the delivery."
3.0,"I am 5'6"" and wear a size 16 in jeans. These do fit, but they're baggy at the top in the belly/crotch area which makes for an odd fit. If I was wearing a long cardigan or jacket that covered that area, they would be fine but otherwise I would not wear them. The length is great on me. They hit just below my ankles. If these fit better, they would be great for traveling because they don't wrinkle. They are pull up style pants and very comfortable to wear. It's a shame that they don't fit well."
3.0,Somewhat small but does the trick. Wear under shorts when doing exercises.
3.0,It’s good it’s just Very large for a female face
3.0,"Wow! What a difference a couple years can make! My husband bought the same merino socks at Costco a couple years ago. They were so warm, thick, cozy and fluffy, that they were even leaving fiber clusters on the floor and in the laundry. So, we didn't hesitate to pay a premium on Amazon for what we expected to be the same Kirkland merino socks. Only these socks disappointedly and are only about 1/3 the thickness. This is one of the few Kirkland products that has disappointed. Next time socks are on our shopping list, we will look for merino elsewhere."
3.0,"Wish this was made better. It didn't come with any kind of nose piece or way to put a filter in it. It's Not really shaped for a face, unless your face is flat. I was sad to see this after waiting for a nice StarWars mask that had multiple characters on it. Really wish the quality was there."
3.0,"I kinda figured I would get what I paid for - no description of make of the material - it’s 100% polyester! I was actually expecting flannel type material, just like the picture. The only reason why I purchased this item is so that I can wear something large and loose to accommodate a healing fractured bone in my arm - less struggle in getting in to an outfit. I would have preferred a cotton mix blend, but 100% polyester??? I will keep it just because it suits the purpose at this time…"
3.0,"The style is cute enough if you like a loose dress. The quality is something that will last you a few washes, or one season."
3.0,Came late. But gorgeous glove
3.0,I purchased these for me and my girls.  I was not a fan of the fit.  Also-one of the kids one came w/o any words.  Just for reference I am 5’2”-145 lbs and I ordered the Large.<br /><br />This suit is probably great for mom’s with great bodies not for us mommas w a bit of a pouch.
3.0,They were larger than expected!
3.0,Very cheap material. You get what you pay for ))
3.0,It was kind of small for my 5 mos old baby..it's the length and she almost barely can fit the sack.
3.0,"Not bad for the price, but the luggage tags are a rubber type material and smell a little strange."
3.0,The red color is more Christmas red then the burgandy it appears in the pictures. I'm a red head do it doesn't really work well for me.
3.0,"The medallion is acceptable, but the eyelet and cheap hook provided to link the medallion to a bracelet, necklace, keyring or lanyard were so poorly designed, I nearly lost the medal twice in the first week.This piece, and hook could have been executed more thoughtfully without adding much to the price tag.<br /><br />While this seller responded to my complaint within AN HOUR, and immediately shipped me a new SFA medallion, a heavier hook, and as an apology, a slightly larger medallion including SAF's prayer this one eventually snapped too.<br /><br />The eyelet snapped off this medallion within one week.<br /><br />SO, the seller's attention to customers is superior, and their reaction-time quick and earnest. Their eyelets and hooks still need work"
3.0,"We were very excited to receive this.  The latex was fresh and sturdy and covered the face and the top of the back of the head.  Unfortunately, only one ear was painted.  This is highly fustrating for us.  Even if the masks weren't sold out, I wouldn't have the time or resources to return it for an exchange."
3.0,This set is super cute and we made it work but I ordered this for my 6 year old thinking the xs would work out. Thankfully the short were very elastics but the top is very very wide
3.0,Ordered an XL and the bottoms fit great but I'm a D 36 chest. And it practically covered my nipples. If I were to move I know my boob would fall out. But I absolutely loved the colors and material just sad it didn't fit and they don't have bigger sizes
3.0,"I'm a motorcycle Santa and burned a pretty good spot on the fur on my boots. This is a good product but alittle short for cuff of my boot. But I am a 6'3"", 320 pond Santa."
3.0,"Overall, I was disappointed by this watch. For starters, I'm a tall, thin guy--an ectomorph--at 6'2"" and 190 lbs soaking wet. So, I have thin wrists and should have known better from the photos, but I went ahead and ordered it anyway. It's a huge watch at about 2.5"" across the face from band to band. It's about 1.5 cm thick. The face alone is 1.5"" or about 4 cm. So keep that in mind.<br /><br />Just going by the site photos, I did not realize the watch was bright white. I thought it looked slightly silver or slightly gray tinted. I did not scroll three pages down to the only place it actually says that it's white in the specs. My mistake, again, I guess. It is very white; like printer paper.<br /><br />Watch functionality is OK I guess. It features the analog time in white hands, but the numbers and marks below the hands are quite dark and not illuminated so it's somewhat hard to read except in very good light. When you push the powered light button, there are three useful tiny displays that appear on the watch face providing various information such as time and day in digital form. These outputs can be set correctly if you study the directions and practice the control button sequences--there are 4 control buttons on the outer edges of the watch body.<br /><br />Another irritating feature, I felt, is that the light comes on for only 3 seconds at a time. So if you are trying to read a stopwatch or alarm, etc. you have to grab a glimpse of if and they push the light button again for another glimpse and so on. Aggravating.<br /><br />If you're into large ""impressive"" looking watches, this may be for you."
3.0,"I bought these pants in white and they were see through; therefore, I had to return them."
3.0,"I like the material and the amount of pockets.  The only thing I do not like is the length of the shorts, just too long for my liking. I’m going to keep but am going to hem myself."
3.0,"They’re serviceable, but the fabric is fairly rough, almost itchy. It also isn’t very stretchy or breathable. They run small."
3.0,"I love the feel of the robe, but it is too small so its not very comfortable."
3.0,A cute set but the straps on the back pack easily get stained and dirty!
3.0,"The materials of the dress isn’t the greatest quality but it’s cute and the price was nice. Although, I can only picture my child wearing this dress once or twice. The flower appliqué isn’t sewn on that well and the tutu is kinda delicate. I would be weary of putting this in a washer. It looks good in photos. I bought this for my baby’s Baptism party. It fits the occasion and party decor well."
3.0,Great sweatshirt but small for a Large.  Should of went up a size.
3.0,"I see that this company is a small company based out of rural North Carolina. I like their ideas. The Ariel's Grotto shirt is a great graphic as I love Disney and I love Coffee. Ariel is one of my favs also. My only complaint would be that I wish the graphic was applied more professionally looking than it was. Its kind of more crafty, etsy, type looking than anything else. But I have no doubt the as the company grows, so will the quality. Besides I love small town feels."
3.0,It fits over suitcase handle nicely. Can become bulky quick by placing items in it. Bag itself is heavy without items in it.
3.0,Very nice quality soft material cute Halloween designs ear loops are very comfortable. Reason for 3 stars is because mask is too large for my 5 yr old grandson😟
3.0,So small. Cute but more for kids. A very tight beanie so the photo is not accurate.
3.0,Nose bridge
3.0,I was slightly disappointed on how tight with the shirts are.
3.0,"somewhat small so it is hard to get on and harder to get off,  but once its on it looks good"
3.0,"Too small for me, too big for my littles, but Fit my 9& 12 yr olds perfect!"
3.0,"This was beautifully made but I’m only 5 feet tall and a size 10. I’m usually all about the loose and flowy since I have a ton of extra weight to hide, but I thought it was just too much extra fabric on such a short person."
3.0,Cute but really short and I’m 5’3”
3.0,Comfy and pretty shoes. My daughter put her feet in a usual mud after the rain and shoes never get clean again.. 2 weeks of life..
3.0,Cuban not very waterproof and if it gets wet just a little bit it's stains. How to order a different kind of watch band
3.0,I love how they look. They are very creative ear rings and look just like the image. The only problem is that when I first tried them on the back of one of the earrings pulled out of the cats back legs and body and now I have to try and glue it back in so that I can wear them. They should make them a little bit stronger.
3.0,Not correct fit
3.0,I really love the jeans only I wish they fit like the first pair I bought.  I plan on washing and drying them again hopefully they will shrink some more.
3.0,Cute but hard to screw in
3.0,"The band looks just like the original. It was pretty easy to change. Unfortunately, the little rubber loop that holds the band down broke off after a week of normal wear. Guess I will be trying another. :-("
3.0,"Great quality, the size ran a little small."
3.0,"Snug in some areas, straps not sturdily attaches. My mom had to reinforce them but cut romper."
3.0,Very nice but more aqua then turquoise so I sent them back which they were great about but good quality!!
3.0,"I love the look, but mine broke the first time I wore it."
3.0,"As a Michigan native, I really wanted to love this mask, but it’s not 5 star or 12 dollars worthy if I’m completely honest. I have bought several budget masks with better sewing/craftsmanship compared to this mask. Seams are messy with lots of fly away threads. It fits fine enough and it is plenty warm, but it’s not my most comfortable mask I own either. Super disappointed."
3.0,I like this dress. The material could be better. It's kind of stiff.
3.0,Pretty cool. But the sizes dont vary enough to west as pictured
3.0,I thought it would clean a little bit better than it does.  It is ok but not great....
3.0,Warm material but arms a little tight for size of shirt.
3.0,"Disappointed, not as large as it seems in the photo, doesn't cling well to ear lobe."
3.0,"This is a nice suit.  I find it a bit uncomfortable across the shoulders, but it is workable.  I have found it to be fading slightly already."
3.0,it looks really nice but did not have holes to go with my nicer shower curtain rings.
3.0,"I was in need of a new pair of sandals and thought these were cute. The gems reminded me of crystal stones which i love.. The insole part is very comfortable and soft, and the heel has a small wedge, and I'm short so it adds about an inch or two to my height which is nice. The length fits pretty well but slightly smaller than other shoes i wear that are a size 6, but the shoe seems overall well made and durable.. I really wish they had an adjustable straps because the straps are very lose on my foot and my foot keeps sliding forward in the shoe. I feel like i have to walk trying to keep my foot in place which is not the most natural and comfortable feeling."
3.0,Shiny and good variety of sizes
3.0,Nice and thick but extremely tight on my head.  May loosen after several washes.
3.0,I liked it. Broke very easily.
3.0,It would have been better if the edges were rounded and werent so sharp. When I slide my ring off it scratches and scrapes my finger. I had to take a file to it. Needless work for a tiny peice of metal to keep my ring on.
3.0,For loafers its not much of a no show sock. It may work for shoes that are close around the ankles
3.0,"I really love this jacket, but it is way too small. I would recommend going up a size."
3.0,The packaging is like your getting RayBands but they are not. However light weight for sure.
3.0,"Much bigger beads in person. Good for price though, got them on sale for under $5."
3.0,"Product quality is acceptable, however, calling this sand &#34;Super Fine&#34; is misleading at best. The product I received was far less fine than it appeared in the preview provided. I ended up having to look elsewhere and was able to find some truly &#34;super fine&#34; sand in the gardening section of a larger Michael's. Good product if you just are looking for some clean beach sand, but isn't recommendable if you are specifically looking for an extra fine grit sand."
3.0,"I bought these for an ATV trip we had while on a vacation. They did the trick and worked fine for keeping the dust and dirt out of our eyes, at a very cheap price for two pairs. If I was buying something for regular use, buy something better that doesn’t dig into the head quite as much."
3.0,"As everyone has said, the mask is INSANELY small but a size up and he would have been swimming in the rest of the suit. Kid was fine not wearing the mask but it was disappointing."
3.0,"The pants were too small.  Apparently the size switched from XL to XS automatically and I didn't catch it until I opened the box.  There were only 4 pairs available when I placed the order and that's how many I ordered, so I am going to have to request a refund."
3.0,"These don't fit the ears right and there is nothing to lock them into place, they would be pretty if they would stay on!"
3.0,very pretty but if your a sz 12 or larger it Will not fit I'm a sz 12 ordered a xxl but it's still way to small!
3.0,"I did not see the print on the bottom of theses shoes, baby due in july i will still use them but this is not for boys, has flower print on bottom of theses shoes."
3.0,"I like the socks fit, but prefer a thicker sole. Sufficient for around the house but not exercise. I didn't pay attention to the materials but feels like it has more man-made materials than cotton. It is well made. Love the colors."
3.0,"I do like this outfit and it fit as expected so I would suggest ordering your normal size. The tank top sweater dress underneath fit perfect and it thick, warm, and comfortable. The sweater that goes on top is why i gave this item 3 stars. The sleeves are not actually sleeves, they are wide open with a closing around the wrist. The top is too short for me as well, I'm a size D and it barely covers my boobs."
3.0,I ordered small thinking the fingers will be small but 👎🏼 nope. They are huge. Like why you have small if the fingers are longgggg. 😑😑😑 They are soft though. I guess i could modify them.
3.0,the bridge is 18mm --should be 20-22mm----the frames do not look like the photo/advertisement...1st of all they are navy blue---mine look gray black....the top of the lenses are too narrow---I will return and am not satisfied....I wanted to like these frames--hoping for extra large lenses--these are not----well if you are a small adult.....
3.0,ir runs very very small can you guys have an x lg side? i love it but is very sm.
3.0,Product bit packaged to maintain shape. Came deformed.
3.0,Very small neck. Too small around neck opening. Had to stretch them which caused tear.
3.0,It worked as a necklace.
3.0,"Las piedras azules son muy bonitas, pero la calidad de la casita es terrible. Llegó casi negra en lugar de plateada"
3.0,"I wanted to use this dress in white for my upcoming graduation, but it is extremely see-through. I will most likely be buying this dress in a color that isn't white because I did love the way it fits me."
3.0,"I really like these jeans.  I like a bit of bling, and they have just the right amount.  The waist is a bit too large...they just seem to come straight up from the butt.  I sew, so I put in a couple of darts from the back pockets to beside the back belt loop.  It was easy to do, though not everyone wants to rework clothing they purchase."
3.0,"The stone is the right size: not too big, not too small. but the metal is very thin and delicate, I'm afraid I'll break them soon."
3.0,"I received the Original versions instead of the Vest/Outback version.  I opened them and didn't realize they were supposed to be the Vest versions until I opened the second set of suspenders I had purchased intending to try them both.  I suppose I will buy these eventually as I can see them working nicely and adjust my review accordingly.  Also, the bag they came in was labeled Vest so it wasn't an error from the seller.  Only bad thing was at the time of purchase these Vest Like Comfort Outback Suspenders cost more than the Originals so I probably should have returned them."
3.0,Runs small. Size up if possible.
3.0,"I love the earrings but one of the clips got broken, so I couldn't even wear them. The look of the earrings are great but the clip quality is very bad."
3.0,"This is not as helpful as one which has at least 3 rows of &#34;eyes.&#34; This worked, but it gave little option and was rather flimsy -- rows of eyes add useful heft."
3.0,"Good quality.  Feels heavy and sturdy.  Gave it to a friend as a birthday gift.  When I opened it the rings are larger and thicker than i thought they would be from the pictures, but she liked it so works out good!"
3.0,"The blue is really pretty, but for some reason the steel looks more like a dark bronze than black. I still love the blue stones though, but I wish the steel looked more black than bronze."
3.0,strange fit one shoulder hole was smaller than the other both holes where larger than pictured and it was not as long as pictured came to about pant waist area
3.0,"Cute, but there are nicer diaper bags out there"
3.0,I like that they are super lightweight compared to my other sandals with a suggestion to omit hiking or want to wear them for extended hours over the daytime due to comfort level i.e. (4 hours max for me standing) Great item!
3.0,although this is good quality I was not willing to give them a better review due to the fact they do not tell you this is external treaded and for this size may not be a good choice for everyone
3.0,Bought for friend in wheelchair but too wet to remove to go in store. And that is what we wanted it for.
3.0,It was nice.  Kind of cheap looking
3.0,"The posts could be a little thicker. One of them bent putting it in my ear. I bent it back, but really, should it be that thin? But they do look great in my ears."
3.0,It turned out to run small.  So if I can't stretch it some I will have to give it to a skinny friend.  There is no size in the sweater at all and I love the softness of it.  It is beautiful!  I don't have the paperwork that came with it to exchange it so I will keep it for a little while.
3.0,"The listing says: 2pcs AAA Natural Peridot Green Lucky Jasper Oval Cabochon Flatback Gemstone beads 18x13mm or 7.1&#34;x5.12&#34; #GO34, so I expected 7.1&#34; x 5.12&#34; stones. They were about 1/2 inch by 3/4 inch. They are pretty, but were misrepresented, as far as size, in the listing. I am happy to have them, I just wish I had known that I was getting tiny stones, I would have ordered something else."
3.0,Needs more card slots.
3.0,"Pretty and comfortable but def runs a bit small in both the top and bottom. I got a large and I'm a 34C and the top doesn't fully cover or the bottom.  Nice though, unfortunately I won't be able to wear it."
3.0,love everything but its bigger than i thought
3.0,"Looks just like the picture, fits great but not the best material, I’ve worn them 4 times and places are trying to rip but they were reasonably priced"
3.0,"I want to give 5 stars... Visibility is excellent, very similar to REVO blue lenses.  My biggest complaint is that they scratch very easy and at about 6 months non scratched areas of the lenses started to peel.  I only used warm water or mild cleaners on these lenses.  These fit my Eyepatch 1's perfectly and brought them back to life. It's a shame I loved these lenses but I was hoping for at least a year of use."
3.0,"I was so excited to find this item.  I like to carry my phone, keys, and the basics-money, debit/credit card, insurance cards, ID, maybe a couple shopping cards or pictures.  This fit the bill perfectly-it held all of that without being either too small or too large.  Great on it's own or thrown in my diaper bag or work tote.<br />However I had issues with the quality!! The trim (white on this version), separated from the main product-it would get a lose end and almost just peel off.  It started doing this about a week after I had it!  Now while annoying, this didn't really detract that much, I just peeled any loose pieces off so they weren't hanging there.  It wasn't quite as nice looking but that was a minor factor to me.  However, the magnetic fastener on the body of the phone pocket then ripped completely through and came out of the material, rendering it completely unusable-as what good to the rest of the features do it if it doesn't do what I want anymore, which is hold the basic and my phone at the same time.  I was very disappointed in this.  I think it needed to have been anchored better and reinforced where it was attached-this happened after only 2 months of use-I would think an item intended for daily use that's going to be opened and closed every time you get your phone out should have been of better initial quality especially at this price.<br />The other negative is that the cell phone pocket needed to be just a little bigger to fit very many phones I would think.  I was not able to fit my initial phone in it at all-the length was fine but it was too thick-so it didn't get used till I got a new one.  Then, my iPhone 4 did fit-but only without any cover/case on it.  I don't think it would fit any flip phone except maybe a razor (do they even make those any more?), and when I tested my boss' blackberry that would not fit, and a friends messaging phone with slide out keyboard didn't fit either.  So anything but an unprotected I-phone or very slim other phone is not going to fit. The pocket needs to have more gusseting and the fastener needed to stretch further (or like a similar product I finally found, have some elastic at the base so it conforms to the size you need).<br />I looked at the brand's website recently, and this item is now unavailable in any color.  So either they've discontinued it completely, or, my hope-maybe they are revamping it to fit more phones and be higher quality! I am keeping my fingers crossed...but not holding my breath!"
3.0,"I'm between a 1xl and a 2xl, the 1xl was too small so I'm gonna try the 2xl.  This top is very cute but it is not a soft t-shirt material, it very stiff material and has no stretch to it. When I got it it was a little snug and it might have worked had I been able to stretch it some. I do like the length however and I like the look so I'm just going to try the next size up and cross my fingers that this one will work. I also am a DD and the 1 X fit very snug across my bust so keep that in mind when choosing your size. Like I said there is no stretch to this material."
3.0,Ran small. Nice summer fabric as the fabric is thin but not see through. Looks as pictured.
3.0,Love the glasses but priced a little high for the quality. I got them for a bachelorette party.
3.0,Ordered a large.  I'm 6' tall and average size.  Sweats were a little short and pretty tight.  Company agreed to accept return but they have to be shipped back to China.  My postage cost would be $34 to return them.  Will find someone smaller I guess since that would be ridiculous.
3.0,"I love the look of this piece, but like other reviewers was disappointed to receive the actual necklace with a bow piece that is hardly distinguishable. I also experience the issue of the necklace turning and not resting on my chest properly."
3.0,I liked the shirt but not what I thought
3.0,"Casebacks you can close with your fingers, this tool works great.  Ones you cant, it's not so good.  I have to about stand on the arm with it on the floor to get enough leverage on tighter case backs.  For the cheap price it's an okay tool for easy jobs...but for harder jobs you will need a better tool."
3.0,"Great fit, but dress made with cheap material that snags on everything."
3.0,The fit of the suit is true to size in the bottom. The top isn’t necessarily too big but it just doesn’t have any support. The top part felt like the equivalent of wearing a low cut tank top with no bra. I purchased it to wear to a water park and ended up feeling quite self conscious all day with such little support. The quality is good and the colors are pretty.
3.0,Did not like the slick heavy material.
3.0,These are cute lighter pink than picture
3.0,Not for TRI's. Great for cycling however don't try and run in them. Definitely going to get sag and burns...
3.0,"Okay for its price. Bead bracelet broke, but necklaces and the other band were okay. I wear my necklace everyday and there is no irritation. The end of the necklace is sharp."
3.0,Ok but see through not the best product I’ve bought
3.0,Well made but fit is small ordered  10/11 more like 9/10
3.0,Bag itself is too heavy
3.0,"Fit great, look nice. But they ripped on day 35."
3.0,Collar to hard and tight.  Liked shirt design
3.0,"bought late october 2017, latch broke mid march 2018. not enough room for the basics."
3.0,Good for daily use
3.0,Order to your size
3.0,I ordered large for my average size 7 years old son. The sleeves are too long but the hoodie is too tight and small. Somehow disappointed.
3.0,"Its a very good, well conditioned watch. I really do love it, but when I wore it to school and around the house, it was 'Noisy'. Whenever I moved my arm or just do normal daily things in life, my watch always shook and made clicking noises. A classmate of mine noticed it to and at the point, I had to take it off for the rest of the day :,( Its unavoidable. I just keep it displayed in my room next to all my other anime collections.... so its not so bad. Though I wish I could wear it."
3.0,Cute packaging and arrived fast but the discs are a lot smaller than pictured in the photo
3.0,"You cannot put much stuff in this wallet, unfortunately I put a little too much in it and the case separated at the top by the clasp.  I am hoping I can super glue it and fix it... love the look of it... the color of course is a lighter blue than the T.A.R.D.I.S. blue but I get compliments on it. Just wish the construction was better on it."
3.0,Love the hat it is good quality and very cute
3.0,Comfortable product.
3.0,The band fit good and looked great. It  broke after 6 months and I had to order another.
3.0,Fit as expected. More like a crop top... straps come off very easily
3.0,"Loved the way it organized all of my cards, receipts, etc.  After a brief period though the material began to crack and flake off."
3.0,Doesn't look good on my face
3.0,"Really like the mask!! It's just a little flimsy and one piece already came loose, but it's nothing a little hot glue can't fix! This did take like 2 weeks longer than it was supposed to to get to me...but that's why I ordered early for halloween I guess!"
3.0,The fit is flattering but the material is like a nightgown its way to thin not worth the price seriously!!!
3.0,"Alright so I really liked the dress, the color, material, length...but the straps (possibly just a mistake) we’re so loose/crooked that it was off the shoulder. The straps fell down the whole time. I’m pretty busty, so I know the chest area wasn’t a problem. Was disappointed as all night it looked kind of sloppy."
3.0,These bras are nicely made but they are no-impact bra and the shoulder straps almost slide off. They're one step above a leisure bra.
3.0,used as part of Halloween costume.  It was a bit short for me but it worked.
3.0,"Got a large- I am 5'6 160lbs, athletic build. I have a flat stomach and this romper was tight in the crotch. It is cheap but there is plenty of cheap on amazon that looks good. This doesn't. The material is awful. My husband said I looked like a cute R2D2. Its a bolder blue than in the photos. Not flattering at all. Returning ASAP."
3.0,Good material kind of large but nice to wear
3.0,"I bought the hunter green color because the photos and other reviews made it seem like a deep almost olive color. Unfortunately what I received was a bright almost clover green, which did not match the rest of my costume. It looks to be a nice dress, but Im putting it down some stars since the color I got was not the color I thought I was buying, and therefore I cannot use it as intended."
3.0,I really searched for these cause I thought they were edgy and interesting.  They're larger than I expected so I'm not sure they'll replace my other pink sunglasses.
3.0,"They did not fit my nephew, he's got a high arch, he needs them in 'wide,' but they looked great!"
3.0,I loved the piercings and the design minus the part how it’s kinda hard to screw in. But when I had them in the balls would fall out on its own even the side that I never touched which has lead me to lose about two
3.0,"Light, thin, sheer fabric. The entire point of buying this piece, however that allows no margin of error on your figure. I want to like it, I'm trying to. It is still hanging in my closet trying to decide if I will keep it knowing I have to wear significant undergarments to make it look decent. The torso is my problem area, for an evening wedding it might work. But not sure that is worth it for me. The length is good for flats or max 3&#34; heels, I am about 5' 7&#34; and full bust although the slit is low without some undershirt/tank. I'm on the fence with this..."
3.0,the slippers while really cute would not stay on my son's feet
3.0,For an overnight bag it is perfect! Very roomy and so organized. But for a diaper bag it was very bulky and squared at the bottom. I ended up returning it because I just couldnt see myself carrying this with three kids in tow.
3.0,items are really heavy and add a lot of weight to my purse- i didn't really like that
3.0,Tiny!
3.0,doesnt really do anything for me
3.0,thats it
3.0,Was disappointed when I found in person that the tie or bow in the front was for show and not functional
3.0,"Cute idea, but they run small! I can wear them for a short while."
3.0,Not bad at all for the price . Comfortable and soft
3.0,"cute jacket but really small. Also, this is a light cotton jacket but not a heavier denim one."
3.0,Had to return it. It was too big.
3.0,Too Long.  Inside Smells of Cigarettes.
3.0,"Love the shirt but it’s WAY too small, not just a little small. My daughter is a peanut and most of the 4T shirts we get for her are a little big, this 4T shirt was the size of at least a 3T if not smaller. We bought this about a month ago and we’ll be lucky if she can wear this till Christmas. I’d suggest that anyone order 2 sizes up from what you really want."
3.0,"It's very pretty and fits as expected, but it's very but very cheap for the price!"
3.0,VERY DISAPPOINTED.  IT DIDN'T HAVE THE FEATHER WITH IT. WILL PROBABLY RETURN IT
3.0,"I'm an XL in general, the XXL fits perfectly"
3.0,These run very small and tight!
3.0,"I didnot receive 3 sets of earrings. Silver flower,  925 diamond ambestee, 925 mini gift.  I forgot I order them. Was I charge for them?"
3.0,These are a weird fit. Read reviews bought larger size and the hips are HUGE- while the  and legs are small. I have an average height and body shape (5.5 and 140 lbs.). DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
3.0,"This is a really pretty dress and quite long, though I had to return it because it made a HUGE mess just from trying it on! The glitter falls off everywhere and it was a little ridiculous for that much glitter to be all over the floors so unfortunately it had to go back. Otherwise it was a really pretty dress and it fit very well. I went with my regular size."
3.0,I returned these because they just don't fit my body right but they are a nice material and not cheaply made. Still great pants!
3.0,I bought a size 10/12 which I believe is an intermediate but it was just way too tight. The quality of the leotard is nice and it seem like it would fit well I think I will go a size bigger. I am hoping the size is not just off. I wish they had a better size chart.
3.0,A cute belly chain but the material is a little thin and it is not for a girl that has a little bit larger waist than normal.
3.0,Pants seemed like a hospital type pants. Didn’t like the product
3.0,I do like the tank tops but I was expecting it to be a compression fitting top and it's not. They are just stretchy. I would purchase them again but not as a compression top. I think it's misleading to call them compression tank tops.
3.0,I loved this dress but it runs way too small.
3.0,"I'm not sure if the warehouse is sending the wrong sizes to the wrong address or if they really are that small.. I ordered the largest size and my foot wouldn't even fit (12 men) but I assumed it was the wrong size, so I ordered a second pair and I had the same problem with the second pair.. They seem like great shoes with excellent airflow but they arent as light as I was expecting and they run way too small."
3.0,Very blurry graphic on the picture
3.0,Worked as intended however the hard plastic figure would press into our child’s back when sitting back in a chair. This caused the to complain and mess with the cord a lot. Maybe a soft silicon type figure would be better.
3.0,I wanted to return it but I would have had to pay. I like that the buttons actually work on this shirt unlike many others with fake buttons
3.0,I love the color of this dress but I should have went a size up I hugged my pouch butt and thighs. The slit of the dress was to high for in the center
3.0,"I like the colors, easier to wear than my over-the-head P95 (construction use) mask, but it feels way to thin and when you breath in it gets sucked into your mouth and nose. Would be better with another layer or removable filter."
3.0,It arrived on time but it's a handwash only item and the pants fit a little shorter than I like I'd advise to order a size up.
3.0,The slippers are made well but run.
3.0,Part of a Halloween costume.  They worked for the hours I needed to wear them.
3.0,"I felt that this ran very large and long. It would be great for tall girls, but I was swimming in it. I ended up returning it rather than trying another size but I might give it another shot!"
3.0,"I love this purse. It's so unique and cute and I get compliments on it everywhere I go. The picture doesn't really do the holographic effect justice, it's more colorful and pretty. However, the first day I carried it, the holographic piece panels began falling off. I wore this as a cross body bag, and the pieces on the edge that touched my hip began falling off. The edges for the other pieces come up as well, as if they aren't adhered properly. I tried gluing them back, they don't really stay any better that way.<br />Basically its really cute but won't necessarily hold up."
3.0,"This product is super cute, but definitely not for fat people. It's too tight for my wrist and leaves marks in my skin. Otherwise, no complaints, it's exactly what I ordered."
3.0,"This watch kind of mystifies me.  It looks beautiful, keeps extremely accurate time and is a perfect watch for the price, with one huge caveat:  it loses days.  Yes, you read that correctly.  I know--a watch the keeps accurate time should also keep an accurate date since the two are connected, but this one does not.  I own a few watches and wear this one about every two weeks.  It's in a glass-topped case, so I look at it every day.  The time is always dead accurate.  But over the course of the two weeks between wearings, it loses about two days on the date wheel.  I know it doesn't make sense, but there it is.  I love everything else about the watch, but every time I take it out of my watch case to wear it, I have to set the date."
3.0,"I love the images of this bag, the size, and the idea behind it. The straps are comfortable when wearing, and the pockets on the outside are perfect for quick access. The faux leather is nice, and seems durable. It’s definitely a bag that’s versatile, and will look good with many looks in your wardrobe.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this bag is the structure and interior lining. There is a divider in the center of the bag, however one side doesn’t go all the way to the bottom which makes no sense. The lining isn’t connected securely, so overall it seems that you are missing out on maximized space within the bag. The bag doesn’t stay structured and makes the bag look sloppy when worn as a backpack. However, the bag does look great when worn with the shoulder strap, or when carried by the top handle.<br /><br />Although I’m not 100% impressed with this bag, it’ll work for what I need it for. It does hold a lot of my belongings, and will work great for every day and travel. Overall I give it three stars."
3.0,I wish the metal connecting links were narrower.
3.0,Very comfortable and soft and the color is very pretty (i got green). However there isnt any compression and you can very much see underwear outlines. I got the S/M size and it definitely fits more like a medium than a small
3.0,"Was hoping for back pain relief, it was marginal at best."
3.0,Runs a little small-
3.0,"MUCH heavier and thicker than I imagined. Wearable, but I do prefer lighter weight. Aesthetically, they're as pictured (a bit shinier)."
3.0,the print is super cute. I thought they would be a lot more sturdy but they are not lined so you will have to only pack soft items that won't become damaged.
3.0,"With the pandemic I was looking for compression socks for every day wear. I found the material very thick & stiff, hard to don & doff. The compression on calves was fine, however, the feet were less so & my feet were swollen at the end of the day. Glad I was cautious & only bought one pair to start. Disappointed, I wanted to get some of the bright colors...won't do that now."
3.0,Not made for wearing. It’s very thin but is still good quality. My boyfriend uses it as decoration rather than wearing it.
3.0,telling time and day
3.0,"Deliberately ordered non polarized lenses so electronic screens could easily be read, regardless of head orientation/light angle. Lenses that were provided were polarized, despite saying otherwise.<br /><br />Fit perfectly, look sharp... but wrong polarization."
3.0,"Light weight and very comfortable. I deducted a couple stars due to the fabric color bleeding extremely bad, even after washing, to the point where I cannot wear a light colored blouse under it. I don't think the lighter colored blazers will have this issue."
3.0,I bought for my 11 yr old daughter. The suit is beautiful but the bottoms are not appropriate for a young girl. They barely came above her private so I kept the top and bought different bottoms.
3.0,The mask itself is so soft and the quality of material is great. Too bad it’s HUGE!!!!! It’s definitely made for a grown man. Here’s a pic of it next to mine for reference
3.0,The colors are very pretty and they are just the right size.  Unfortunately the first pair I really wanted to wear did not have a stone in one of the earrings.  I should have returned them but I didn't.
3.0,for $15 you can complain. I'm 5'4&#34; and 175 lbs (36dd) andgot a 2XL. It fits just fine for what I need it for.
3.0,My shirts I order they r to small and they say 3x but I should of got 4x but it will just keep them I didn't like these tank tops so I didn't know they were so spandex tight on me so I am not wearing them
3.0,"It’s cute, material is nice. I can put it on but it’s tight. I’m 5” and 210lb I wear an 18 so I ordered the 3x. Thinking it may be a little loose, nope! I mean I can put it on but it’s not flattering. I wear for pjs so there’s an upside"
3.0,Shorts fit good top way to small
3.0,Only thing I didn't like was the fact that a pair of them were broken
3.0,"The chest part would always open up, maybe if you have bigger bra size it would fit better. Returning"
3.0,"Really cute print. The neckline is extremely high, borderline uncomfortable."
3.0,"Cute and they fit great,  but they dont hold for long. Had them a few weeks an they started to rip."
3.0,Smaller than I wanted. Also the wire they use for the hooks is a smidgen too big for the backs they provided. Getting the backs on is a serious pain and I've bent the hooks trying to shove them in place.
3.0,"I love the high low skirts but the material of this one was very thin, would be great for the summer but I was looking for something for the winter with my boots."
3.0,Made from thin cheap canvas not leather or leather. They won't last long. The fit is Good.
3.0,"The belt is a fine value BUT, the sizes are mostly fantasy...with a 34 waist I had to cinch the thing so grandly my 'medium' belt produced a good foot of excess belt whenever I had anything beyond a wallet in my pockets. The small, advertised as too small from me actually worked great...so beware and order a size smaller than you think you need, or spend your time with about a foot or so of excess expanded belt."
3.0,This is a good quality light jacket and fits perfectly. My only disappoint is that it arrived with a few stains. It seems as if a wash was attempted prior to shipping with the strong scent that it had when received.
3.0,"Color is brownish, not black/blue, as in photo. One lever back did not fit into the slot, which means earring could slip off when putting on a coat etc. This happened to one of my previous pair of black pearl drop earrings. Was looking forward to wearing them, but I am returning them."
3.0,These are much heavier than I expected even for fleece.
3.0,The product is fine.  Just don't like wearing it.
3.0,I have bought medium sized gloves for 50 years.  The gloves fit everywhere except the fingers are about 1/2 inch too long.  Your hands look like alien hands in them.  I didn't return them because I can wear them to the barn.  Horses don't care about what your hand look like.
3.0,Larger sizes needed.  One size fits all does not work.  There is a lot of difference between a ladies size 6 and a size 10.  Make larger sizes!  I had to give mine away.
3.0,They were way too small. Sent them back. Got a wuikctrefund! :-)
3.0,I thought there would be more form to this jacket but it just kind of hangs there.
3.0,I love the colors. I think that this shirt looks better on a thin person than on a plus size.
3.0,Fit right! Good product
3.0,2 out of 4 were not quick dry material. The 2 quick-dry ones were the plain ones. It’s unfortunate- otherwise nice Tshirts.
3.0,"Super short, could have been a shirt (I’m 5’7)"
3.0,The color and pattern was not as advertised
3.0,This is a cute top but it fits tight around but is long so the next size up would be way too long.
3.0,Material is cheap.  Shredding.
3.0,It got old looking after the first couple of washes.
3.0,"I'm a skinny, average height (5'9) male and this thing is a bit tight on my face. I can't imagine if I were to gain weight. There's no way this would fit. The material feels good but I wish it were a bit bigger."
3.0,CLASP VERY HARD TO CONNECT
3.0,"In November 2014, I researched all the hole-less belts (slidebelt, missionbelt, trakline, easybelt...etc) and decided on Trakline based on the reviews. I was extremely happy with my purchase and decided that the Trakline was a high quality belt worth every penny (5-stars).<br />I wanted to get another belt just a few days ago and got this belt because it was less than half of the cost of the Trakline. Turned out to be a mistake.<br />Pros:<br />The leather belt part had higher quality leather than I expected.<br />Cons:<br />Belt head was heavy (2x more than the Trakline), and felt cheap<br />The function for taking out the leather belt needs to be redesigned so that it's easier to detach the belt head and leather. I had to get a tool to detach it.<br /><br />If the creators of the belt make these improvements, I'd be tempted to buy the belt again as it is an attractive price point.However at the end of the day, better usability, functionality, and quality beats a cheaper price.<br /><br />For now, buy the Trakline. You will not regret it."
3.0,"materials feel nice and looks good, hate that the zipper is female sided.  while material encloses the bottom of the zipper to 'hide' it... makes it very hard to start zipping up process.  would not purchase again"
3.0,"I was super excited for these earrings, but when I opened the box one of them came broken."
3.0,Very Thin Material. Good to wear over bathing suit.
3.0,I was hoping this would be a little longer but it barely comes past my waist.
3.0,"They are really big, They fit my wife's profile, but for someone who has a thinner or smaller face, they will look to big."
3.0,the hat looks great however on the inside the seam is not done well and when my toddler puts it on it it scratches him.  Please do a better job on the seam that is on the inside of the hat.
3.0,"I knew this was made out of polyester but I did not expect it to be so thin.  In addition, the material is not very comfortable but shiny and more like the texture I would expect from rayon material.  Weighing 94lbs. I expected the small to fit me, the outfit runs too small to be comfortable and the top is shorter than I like.  In addition, the material at the waist is tapered more than I like.  I would not buy this again."
3.0,Bodice is very tight on my tiny daughter who usually takes a small.  This small is too small.  Foreign clothing is always smaller than a US small.
3.0,It's cheap so you're gonna get cheap lenses but they work okay for anyone who is looking for cheap sunglasses
3.0,"This handbag seemed well made and was a very nice color.  However, I had to immediately return it because it was much too large for my 5 foot height."
3.0,"Impressive, I'll be wearing these during the summer. I will be ordering more of these , hope the price remains the same."
3.0,It's smaller than the rest of our Flipeez.  So it's pretty tight on my 5yo's head.
3.0,This purse was exactly what I was looking for! I love everything mermaid style....BUT! Holy moly this purse smells horrible!!!! Its like a skunk who's been a chainsmoker all his life was living in there!! So because of that I haven't even worn it out yet. I've been trying everything to get rid of the stench but it's still there.. so 3 stars...
3.0,"It was nice and comfortable. Should of gotten it a size bigger, but still it feels nice on the skin. Thank you."
3.0,"Bought for my young grandson. He loves the silky-smoothness of the material, but I would suggest buying at least a size smaller as they seem to run larger than expected. The negatives: Need a variety of more pleasing to the eye colors. Positives: Silky-smoothness of the material."
3.0,"The picture for this item does not really give you a true idea of what you're getting. It looks great in the picture, but the quality is not top notch."
3.0,"Decent design, material is not the greatest but my nephews liked them. Way to small for the size it should be. Bought two, i size Large and XL. XL was more like a L, L was more like a medium."
3.0,It hits a little short but will still work.
3.0,"They look really nice, and the price is great, but the locations of the hardware attachments are too high on the back of the skulls, causing the bottom parts of the crossed bones to extend beyond the edges of a typical shirt cuff and catch on things.  Good aesthetic design, poor practical engineering design."
3.0,Returned it as the color was more of a brown than a wine. Not pretty in my opinion.
3.0,"Love the fit, but bought as a bridesmaid dress and could not get wrinkles out.  It came folded up and so therefore had a million tiny wrinkles.  The fabric did not do well when ironed.  Only the bottom ironed okay.  Order a size up runs small."
3.0,Purse is great but inside lining has odd letters and writing but parts have nothing. Otherwise works great for the price.
3.0,The glasses I received were crooked.
3.0,They are sturdy and nice colors but only 2 layers. I was under the impression that cloth masks need to be 3 layers. I will use over a disposable mask.
3.0,The setting of the pearls and stones looked as if they will fall off eventually. So returned the item.
3.0,COULD BE BETTER I WISH THE MIDDLE PART HAD A ZIPPER JUST IN CASE I NEEDED TO STORE PRIVATE STUFF BUT GOOD FOR TRAVELLING.
3.0,"Very dainty and beautiful. However, I followed the directions I never showered with it or got it wet but still it's color faded and it doesn't look too nice. I bought one for my mom for her birthday and I was sad that she's going through this as well"
3.0,Awesome UNIA colors all respect due to the honorable Marcus Garvey. Tho product lasted maybe 2 weeks
3.0,"The robe is fine and not too heavy, howerever it is NOT 100% cotton as stated in the title/description. Tag says cotton & polyester. I wanted all cotton, but I didn't notice until after washing that it wasn't. It feels ok but description should reflect actual product. Just want to make others aware since some people are sensitive to synthetic materials."
3.0,It was a good looking product ill give it that the back of the neck was far to long.i also will add that on wear it had an issue with air bubbles that i could not work out due to odd fit. the parts that sit under your arm tore on first wear i followed instructions to a t. Slightly dissapointed will update if return is accepted.
3.0,Why is it too short for me ？It is okay to look at pictures ，and the quality is average
3.0,"Cute, but very fragile"
3.0,Some came broken alittle on the cheap side.
3.0,"Well made tapers for stretching, however, they are listed as 25mm when they are, in fact, 24mm. Not 1 inch(25mm)."
3.0,"Gorgeous boot, very comfortable foot bed, soft leather. Custom fit around the calf but the shoe manufacturer/maker seems to forget that a small size foot usually comes with a short and/or petite person!!!! What's wrong with these companies?? This boot hits right at the bottom of the knee cap so it rubs and makes the knee skin wrinkle. I guess it wouldn't happen if I was an inch or two taller or had a longer leg but it seems to be the case with all tall shaft boots. I'm 5'1 and wear a sz 6. Do these shoe companies expect me to have the same length calf as a woman who's 5'7 or 5'4?GOOD GRIEF!!!! Start making shoes that make sense please!!!!!"
3.0,It was insane. Def only for costume use but the price was good.
3.0,"There is nothing special about this shirt.  Just your run of the mill moisture wicking elastic polyester long sleeve.  Please be aware that this Sub DUAL is very different than the Sub COLD.  The Sub COLD feels special, with a slight &#34;wet-suit&#34; feel on the outside, and a fleece feeling interior.  The Sub COLD performs well at keeping my son warm.  The Sub DUAL doesn't really keep my son warm.  To very different products."
3.0,"I purchased two of these and had one pair that barely fit my and spouse's fitbit and the other that wouldn't snap on at all. The one that fit was difficult to get on and difficult to get off but the served the purpose I needed it for. The other, as mentioned, wouldn't snap on no matter how hard I pushed. The other issue which I am willing to deal with is that the first pair has, since, lost most of the paint that was on it. I had read reviews before getting this product but wanted to give it a chance as I prefer shopping on Amazon over some other places. Sad that this is a lot like the other reviews but not completely unexpected. I did get refunded for the pair I couldn't use. As a side note for someone considering getting these, you will need to buy posts for these as it doesn't come with any."
3.0,I had to return these glasses because they were too thin. I have a small face and I need small glasses but these were too small.
3.0,"Loved it! But cheaply made. I bought the necklace and bracelet both and the clasps kept breaking on them. But very nice looking jewelry. I don't regret buying them, just wish they were made a little better."
3.0,The weight is nice but you can't wear it around water or sweat and as a firefighter I'm always around water. I was hoping for a more stable product.
3.0,Wore it for a week. And the coloring of the picture wore off little by little. Mostly on the wrist bottom where you set your hand down.
3.0,I received &#34;blue&#34; and could have sworn I ordered &#34;black&#34;. Keeping them tho . . .  Too much of a hassle to send back.
3.0,It was good just a bit smaller then I expected but was still able to use it. It was worth it.
3.0,Handbag is very stylish.  Material is a little thin.
3.0,It is okay for a gift but not wearable. It is kind of junky.
3.0,It is not real denim it is some cheap material
3.0,"This mask is very realistic and made very well. It does have a smell when putting it on due to the material so that was to be expected. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is there are no eye holes. You can't see anything at all. So, if you are using this to just sit in a chair somewhere it's great. But definitely not for trick or treating or anything to do with walking around, unless you have someone to walk you around and help you not walk into stuff. Otherwise, this is a great mask."
3.0,"It's ok, cheap looking"
3.0,"These are lovely looking little shoes; the suede is soft and the color is rich. I wear a size 12B. Toe cut-out a bit small and when combined with a fairly narrow toe box, these were just a bit too pinchy. The footbed is flat with very little arch support. I wanted to support Tom's company but these aren't the shoes to do it with."
3.0,"One of the backing mechanisms immediately broke of while I was attempting to put these on for the first time.  If you like the style and the bells it is easy enough to attach backing pieces from Walmart to keep these together.  However, you pay for what you get and don't expect quality here.  I do wear them but am disappointed that they are shoddy in manufacturing."
3.0,"They're good quality but the stones are HUGE. They would probably be too heavy to wear all day, and hang down instead of facing forward. I'm disappointed, because they're so pretty."
3.0,"I love this dress. Flattering, stretchy, fits amazing. BUT THE BUST IS TOO SMALL. Cuts into my chest making it look lumpy. Bought this for my birthday in Vegas but I don’t think I can do it with lumpy boobs. I’m 5’3” 175 lbs 36 C, I got the medium because there was only green in large when I ordered. Everything fit great but the cups."
3.0,Little bigger than you would expect
3.0,"The belt arrived and it was lovely; a well-made article. The issue was the size. The size instructions were in my opinion way off. So I took the lovely belt that was waaay too big & cut it so it'd be the right size. Big mistake! The belt completely fell apart, so I had to place it in the trash. Like I said, it's a lovely, well-made belt, if the right size. I liked it so much I ordered another belt in what I expect is the correct size, as the belt was too damaged. This is the first time anything like this has happened to me in 20 some odd years. Be careful to order the correct size and whatever you do, do not take scissors to it to correct the size as it will fall apart. I have mixed feelings about this purchase hence the 3 stars."
3.0,"This bracelet is even more stunning in person than the photos suggest HOWEVER the sticker on the box (Says YL) and the size of it suggests that it is, indeed, a Youth large and will only fit on the most petite women.  Only purchase this for someone with small wrists  or else there will be no comfort in wearing this bracelet."
3.0,"Waaayyyy too small.  Maybe these are actually a junior's size, not ladies?  can't even pull them up much past my knees!  Unfortunately these need to go back."
3.0,The quality of the fabric is actually quite good. Seems to run small though. I ordered up a size and it was still snug on my back and under my arms. Very flattering and good for the price.
3.0,One size larger would be a perfect fit.
3.0,"First, I'd like to say that the thickness and comfort of this shirt are great. However, I am very disappointed in the cut and fit of the shirt. For reference, I am 5'0"" and 118lbs and ordered a size Small.  I am used to shirts being slightly oversized given my petite size. However, as you can see in the pictures provided, the top half of the shirt from the collar and shoulders to the midsection is oversized, and then fits snug in the hips. The sleeves were also long. The worst part is the armhole/armpit area was significantly oversized with the hole extending down closer to my chest. I really wanted to love this shirt as I think the design is very cute, but the cut did not work on my frame at all. This shirt might be a bitter fit for a tall and slender framed person."
3.0,"Absolutely NOT compression shirts! Just a very nice work out tank! It’s comfortable, breathable, stretchy, but not compression. I’m a welder so I have been wearing these shirts under my welding shirts. I got a size smaller (I usually wear a Small, but got the XS) fits nicely!"
3.0,Sleeves were really long
3.0,"Fit was fine in the chest, shoulders, and sleeves. Torso was boxier than I expected. Probably should have gone with the slim cut. They should have better example pictures of the models wearing each cut of the shirt. Overall an underwhelming experience."
3.0,The ring doesn't fit correctly and doesn't have an adjustment.  Otherwise for what it is I like it.
3.0,Lots of compliments but it started to peel on the sides.
3.0,"the nylons are nice, a bit long for me but this is expected since I'm 5'1&#34; , however, the band at thigh is tight."
3.0,Love the color but didn’t like it was too big to be small and the fabric was rough
3.0,"This hat was purchased by my 15 year old son. While he loves the design, the hat is too big. He has to wear something underneath the purchased hat in order for it to fit. Sizing options/info by seller would have been helpful when making the decision to purchase."
3.0,"Got this for my brother in law. I would suggest you size up. I got him a large, but he needed an XL.he was so bummed when he couldn't wear this. Now I know."
3.0,Feels cheap but it is
3.0,"This product may work for some but not for me. I took it to the Acura dealer (Portland OR) and they didn't have the equipment to program it. They only clone keys. $50 (more) later. I notified the seller and they were prompt in their communication and were nice enough to confirm that the dealer would need to be able to 'program' the key. So, find a locksmith that will program an ebay bought key before you buy."
3.0,Aviator sunglasses.  The glasses have a gold frame and a black green colored lens.  I  gave 3 stars bc the arms are not coated where they go over your ears so they are not as comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The glasses are light weight and fit well. They come with a white pleather carrying case.  Decent quality aviator sunglasses.
3.0,Pants are okay but material is terrible.... it attracts everything. You need a lint roller every time!
3.0,"Style is cute, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,shoes are tight wit and without socks. not sure of the comfort level due to only wearing them once.
3.0,"Could use some internal compartments for better organization. Also, it’s rather bulkier than it needs to be. Still, it does the job of holding lots of cards"
3.0,Dont really like the material.  Hopefully it wont get to hot. In hot weather
3.0,"They...well, you really have to be careful buying shoes online in the first place, but this was just ridiculous. I was ecstatic when I saw the Amazon box on my doorstep, knowing that it included these shoes, but as soon as I laced them up I was incredibly disappointed.<br /><br />First off, the appearance is cheap. They look like very slightly indented faux leather that could be purchased at the dollar store. The soles are decent, but whenever I step down on my right foot, you can hear the squeak they make. Not from the floor, but almost like a whistle between the sole and the actual shoe. The laces are thin as all hell, and not even your average thin laces; they're hard as a rock, rough, and unattractive. I had to buy new laces to get it to look decent. Might I mention that, as I was lacing the left boot up, one of the hooks fell off. It FELL OFF. That looked embarrassing, so I had to keep them folded down.<br /><br />The inside is very comfortable, I'll give it that. The design of the fabric is very nice, it looked good when I folded them down.<br /><br />The shoes are...okay, I guess? Their quality is that of a pair of $5.00 Walmart shoes, but I think even Walmart would have better quality than this. I'm probably going to end up giving these away, because I don't see myself ever wearing them again. I'm extremely disappointed, after all the positive reviews."
3.0,This was a good buy some of the pieces where poor quality and broke off (mainly the dangle ones the bottom charm would fall off) the other pieces where good quality and I would buy again. Just as advertised
3.0,its cute but not practical for changing diapers it needs a longer zipper in the leg portion to change diapers easier.
3.0,"I have this band three stars as it does look nice. My complaint is that the buckle rubs on the sensitive skin on the bottom of my wrist. It is irritating and uncomfortable. I tried adjusting the size to slightly larger, but then the watch wasn't tight enough to take my heartbeat. Also, the finish on the buckle began to wear off within a month of purchase, exposing the stainless steel underneath."
3.0,Neckline too wide but I still like it
3.0,I like the price and so i got it. It does run small but i can use it for layering during the winter.
3.0,"These hats appear all over amazon, but this seller had the cheapest price with prime shipping. I bought the light grey and dark grey color. Dark grey is more of a purpley-grey color which is different than the picture but still nice. Light grey is a silvery grey - similar to the online pic. What really threw me though was that the quality of these hats are completely different. While the dark gray was a nice thick knit that sat really well on the head (really nice especially for the price!), the light grey was a lighter weight, super stretchy material that was huge and hung loosely on my head - like a big bag. Very strange - but at least I can return the light grey one. So just be aware different colors may be different quality as well."
3.0,"I should've purchased a smaller one, but I thought a medium was going to fit just right. It was loose around my upper body, and the bottom was way past my knees. Might fit great for a tall person, or someone that just loves a longer dress."
3.0,Fit ok I ordered one size up. Really pretty for the right occasion
3.0,Will need to wash them before use because SMELL SO BAD!! Seem to run extra large.
3.0,I bought these because my dog ate one of my granddaughter's other bracelets.  The string broke on one within a couple minutes of her wearing it. I don't expect perfection at this price but at least make the strings stronger.
3.0,"Very cute and easy to put on. However, after being worn for a while they tend to slip off the back of her heel and starts coming off, almost like there’s not enough support in the shoes around the heel and ankle area. So I suggest not to get them for long periods of time of wear."
3.0,At first the socks worked as they said it would..my feet was dry ams warm but after a few weeks my feet started to feel wet and have a foot odor because of the sweat after i take of my boots..now i have a hole in the heel
3.0,"The hoop was a bit too large for my nose. I'm only planning on wearing it when I go to music festivals. It was weighted so it definitely felt like good quality. Just bad sizing on my nose, personally."
3.0,The name on the back is a little wonky but overall it is a nice.
3.0,Thin and came big
3.0,was too large and return it
3.0,"Very good so far as their intended purpose, but way too expensive for the materials and work required to manufacture them.  I've bought these several times; I wish their were a competitor offering the same product at a lower price."
3.0,I'm short and small and I ordered small but the botton is still too short for me and the sleeves are wide and very loose. I don't feel comfortable wearing it. I'm thinking if I'll just return it or give it to my cousin.
3.0,Great dress just to big. I’m 5’2 and 135lbs and the medium was to big.
3.0,"I wear Brooks because I have issues with my feet. These shoes are comfortable except for the sides where it jabs into my ankle bone with every step I take. I was wearing the Cloud8 until they discontinued them. Now I’m trying to find a replacement. For $150.00 you would think they would be comfortable. The only reason I didn’t send them back is I wore them for a hour before I noticed what was happening. Guess I’ll keep looking, and be way more cautious."
3.0,"bag is not hard, wrinkled"
3.0,"Was even small after going by their chart and ordering 1 size larger. Seem really thin and cheaply made, not what you would expect a hoodie to be. They did a return no problem but I will look for a different one."
3.0,"This hat is HUGE! I know it says one size but unless your head is really really big this hat will be too big. I received it the day I left for my beach vacation so it had to be used....even pulled thru to make it as small as possible it was too big. Because my hair is very tight coily and there’s a lot of it (lol) I was able to pull it thru and it kinda hid the fact that the sides had gaps.<br /><br />Overall a cute style and the denim is comfy - not stiff at all, but wish it was a little smaller."
3.0,It was beautiful but would only fit a child. Very tiny. Giving it to my great granddaughter today.
3.0,"Very pretty, but broke the first time putting on. I will put a split ring to reattach the chain for clasp, but not everyone knows how to do that."
3.0,Fit very well and i like that they're thin but the stitching comes apart only after a few times and light use.
3.0,the hoodies is too tight at the bottom because there is no elastic which is strange for a hoodie and the material is like silk instead of cotton/poly blend and the size was small.  I bought for my son in a X-Large but I could fit it only the sleeves were long so I returned the item.
3.0,"Reviews said they ran small, so I ordered the xl, good thing, they barely fit. I LOVE them, so I’m making them work"
3.0,I wish the front bill was a bit more sturdy
3.0,"My daughter loves the shoes, but it runs small. She usually wears 9, and we ordered 9.5, still too small!!! We really want to return it and get the right size for her, but she does not want to wait. Now we just hope that this pair can sustain for this summer."
3.0,The top and hakama fit great.  I took my chances because I saw mix review about the hakama weither it was a skirt or pants and sadly it was a skirt.  I am happy with the product but it was not the right hakama for martial arts
3.0,"True to color, it was longer on me than what expected and the material was thin and felt cheap."
3.0,Love the design. but it is more undersized.
3.0,"Material is not as expected. The photos show a distressed cotton-like material. What arrives is a cheap, shiny polyester- like material."
3.0,Very awkward fit. Pretty material but not comfortable fit and after first use the underwire started coming out.
3.0,I'd give them 5 stars but I won't do that because they don't fit quite well when I'm using my POC helmet. They fit very well on my Giro helmet.
3.0,Looks bigger in the photo
3.0,"I really liked the photo of this dress. When I tried it on, it gaped a lot at the armpit. May be good if you're more busty. I'm not, so it wasn't a good fit for me."
3.0,"Love the color, dress fits a little large. Wear as a casual outfit."
3.0,Size was perfect for my mom
3.0,"Nice fabric not too heavy,  but it didn't seem true to fit"
3.0,Really really small. I ordered a 3XL and I am a L or XL.
3.0,Its an okay skirt. Not too crazy about it. Zipper was not properly made. Returned it.
3.0,Only issue was the stainless steal ones came with two number two gauges instead of a four gauge
3.0,"Oddly larger in mid section, not very great unless you're a D cup lol"
3.0,"Thought they would be different material, it’s starting to fray away after only washing&drying 2 times."
3.0,Pretty dress. Too large in bust area for me
3.0,Bad threading on 1 of the 4 ordered and they're too expensive for that mishap in quality.
3.0,truely over priced
3.0,Surprised by the quality. It was good but this dress definitely runs large in the waist area. I ordered a size small and the waist was loose. I am by no means a small woman.
3.0,"A nice quality band for the price. A bit stiff at the start, but I'm sure it will break in. However, it runs very short and is not good for anyone with a large wrist. Don't even try it, won't even work on that last hole. Not a chance."
3.0,like it but it rusts too quickly
3.0,"cute for one time use, after being worn once I had to throw away cause stretch of wearing it caused it to fray.  Also buttons unsnap randomly."
3.0,It did not come with a compartment to insert filters as advertised the filters are useless.
3.0,•look good<br />•are workout shorts<br />•have a long waist string<br />•have a shine to them
3.0,Broke already by clasp
3.0,I think it would work better for shorter hair. I have medium full volume hair.  I find it difficult to get all my hair tucked into the band. The top of my head isn’t covered and pops out.
3.0,I bought this for my ATV and installed on handlebars. Terrain is really rough where I ride and the holder doesn't budge. Would get a swivel one next time so I can leave the can in it instead of having to finish my beverage before I head out to next stop.
3.0,Cute but way to short. I am 5' and I got the large. They floated around my ankles! Returned them.
3.0,Too short and way too tight
3.0,Well it's good and good deal
3.0,"Very soft and comfortable, did not fit well at all"
3.0,"love the color .... great style, but the top wrinkled the first day I wore them, disappointing"
3.0,It’s OK Doesn’t fit as a scribe but I still like it
3.0,"I love the idea, but the shorts are quite tight, and the style of the folds over the abdomen aren't as forgiving as I had hoped it would be."
3.0,"I like the length of the body, but the arms are a little too tight/short"
3.0,The shirt was super cute. Bought for my 15 yo size s-m daughter. Ordered in a medium and should have gotten a1-2xl. Had to give to my 9 yo who is a size med in youth.... Use caution in choosing your size.
3.0,"Nice wallet, a little big.  Spot for bills is rather deep.  Quality leather wallet."
3.0,"This advertised for the mandrel and the set of sizing rings. I didn't receive the sizing rings which is literally half of the reason I purchased this. Very displeased with that, but the mandrel seems like it's good quality."
3.0,"This is a nice piece to layer underneath other pieces, but the fit is very boxy and not at all flattering. It is well made and the color is beautiful, but it wrinkles are easily and if you get any water on it the shirt appears stained until it dries completely. It arrived with most of the buttons unbuttoned and that was a task and a half to take care of, but once buttoned it looked nice. I’d say there are things I really like about this shirt and things I really dislike. It certainly won’t be a ‘go to’ item for me."
3.0,"I want to love these and wear them more often than I do, but they have a very itchy waistband. I don't know how to fix that other than wear high waisted panties... which would look stupid."
3.0,Watch okay but way to big for a 8 year old but keeping it..good price
3.0,There isn't much to this dress. There is no lining or shelf bra. It is very thin material. The colors are bright and pretty. The shoulder tie makes the dress easy to adjust as far as fit around the neck and shoulders. It definitely would make a better swimsuit cover than dress but cute either way. Wouldn't suggest spending the listed price of $20 in this.
3.0,"The swimsuit was beautiful, except the zipper broke within the first hour of my daughter wearing it.  Now I need to find a seamstress to try and fix it."
3.0,"Nice design and fit. Initially I thought it would be a bit too long, but it shrank slightly in the wash and fits perfectly now. The navy blue of the trim on the neck and arm holes faded slightly in the wash which I was disappointed by as it is now a bit lighter than the stripes on the body. The other thing that bothers me is the way the fabric on the shoulders bunches between the trim. It doesn't lie flat. Otherwise a good deal."
3.0,Wrong length arm piece
3.0,"Arrived on time, jacket was as said. Except size. Would have needed a size or 2 up. I purchased a Med"
3.0,"I loved this dress. I'm a little on the chubbier side and this was incredibly flattering when I tried it on. However, the zipper broke and shortly afterward, a hole formed. This dress was NOT a tight fit at all. I wish I could've kept it and worn it for the event I had originally purchased it for."
3.0,"Did not fit to the measurements listed. Was too small, and too short. Itchy material. Returned it."
3.0,"very comfortable to wear, but smaller than i thought. will have to make sure i read the description better"
3.0,I had to add elastic to make it stay up.
3.0,"I like this shirt, it’s stretchy and soft. The material is also a little thin, but I like that because I live in Florida. Its an off the shoulder shirt, but if you want it to be more dramatic I would size up one from your normal size. The one thing I’m not a huge fan of is the price. I’m just not sure it’s worth the amount I paid so I wouldn’t buy more unless they go lower."
3.0,It fit well in my holoween costume but I could hardly breathe
3.0,"These socks were ok. I've had them for a few months and they're holding up well after months of washing. I really don't like how thick the socks are, and they don't keep pressure around my feet. I definitely wouldn't buy another pair of these, but I still use them."
3.0,Thick warm and comfortable. Wish they were a couple inches higher though. Would recommend with caveat.
3.0,"Much too small and I ordered up two sizes...there was a flaw in the sewing of the neck strap, but I would have let that go, as it is a darling darling top...so for the that 3 stars.  If you are size XS, S, & a small medium this would be darling for you--but order up a few sizes.  Return was a breeze thank you Amazon."
3.0,"When I received the socks I realized that 2 pairs of the socks were the same character. I requested a replacement pack, and had the same issue. If I had received a pack of socks with 5 different characters like it shows in the picture I would have had no complaints."
3.0,This dress was ill fitting and very rough thicker material. Spend more and get the dress in the picture I uploaded below. The $39.99 dress looks exactly like this dress but it fits way better on my slim waist and the material is very soft. So the bottom of the dress moves elegantly as I walk unlike this dress.
3.0,"Beautiful but doesn't fit my toe correctly, pretty expensive for what you get."
3.0,"I ordered an XL, but I am normally a Large. So if you wear anything bigger than a Large I would not recommend buying this shirt. It's cute but it doesn't fit anything like the picture. It seems more feminine in the picture. The length is definitely there but not as drastic as the model in the picture.  For reference I am 5'9 and 175lbs. The pockets are cute, they don't stick out on the sides and the end of the sleeves are exactly as pictured. The V-cut is not deep at all. If anything i would have liked it to plunge a little lower which is maybe why it doesn't look as feminine."
3.0,Helps put on any bracelet.
3.0,Thought they would be a little bigger.  Some were a little hard to read the &#34;happy camper&#34; part but they did the trick as a little keepsake for the gals that rode on our RV that day.  Thanks.
3.0,Rings are exactly what I expected as far as overall quality. Unfortunately they seem to run small though as they fit snug on my pinky. Very uncomfortably tight on my ring finger. I'm size 8 but wish I had ordered size 9.
3.0,"Nice fabric. If you are curvy idk if this dress will work. I bought a size up and everything  fits well expect in the hips. It's too tight. It seems like  it's just a straight dress with an elastic waist, which makes it seem like there is extra room on the bottom."
3.0,The Top of the hat did not stand up straight like I expected it would.
3.0,I broke my anklet just a week before I was going home to NY for a wedding.. NO store carried an anklet and someone suggested that I try Amazon - so I did.  The bracelet came in the mail before I went to NY so boy was I a happy camper.  Only problem that I found with this anklet is that it runs big.. Instead of my ankle it lays on the top of my foot.  NO way to shorten it.
3.0,"It was so cute and comfortable….then I washed it. It shrunk and is easily a size smaller now. If I buy another set, I will size up to account for shrinkage from washing/drying."
3.0,Lasted about 15mins then fogged up. Wasn't in humid conditions either. Was using them at 30degrees filling my attic with insulation. Had high hopes but as the other reviews state fogging can be a issue.
3.0,Finally got these took 2 orders and almost a month to come in definitely sad they were for a kids birthday and definitely did not have them in time. But they are cute and lite weight so if you are in no rush then go for it but plan on a hassle to get them
3.0,The fabric is super soft and it’s a cute set. I got the grey color. The only thing that bothers me sometimes is the cut of the top I got a large
3.0,"The legs are really wide.  I bought a 4 slim fit for my skinny but tall 4 year old (still wears 2t or 3t shorts, but is almost 4 feet tall) bought 2 pair and they sit in his dresser because he doesn't like the long drawstring or how big the legs are"
3.0,"I wanted a bralette I could wear in the house while I work from home because it's hot in southern CA, I'm peri-menopausal, I can't afford much ac, and it's awkward when the UPS person shows up and I'm naked. So, I wanted more coverage than a bra but less than a shirt or when a crop top. This bralette does that well.<br />My breasts are different sizes but I'm somewhere around a 36C or D. I got an XL which was a size up from what I'd normally get. It fits well. It's comfortable. I like the mesh that catches sweat and lets off heat under the double fabric wrap.<br />I dislike that the crossed fabric cuts across my breasts instead of under them. Idk if I should have gotten a larger size or if the manufacturer just doesn't realize the real estate that breasts take on the chest wall. I also wish that the sides didn't wrinkle up because the angle they make when flattened down is very nice. But for the price I feel like these issues are par for the course."
3.0,"I bought the shirt for my wife.  She loved the touch of the cotton, the design but she wasn't fond of the fit.  She stated that it was too tight."
3.0,"These sytar earring are beautiful, but not for adult ears. could get lost in your piercing."
3.0,"I did like the feel of these leggings and if you were going to wear them with sweaters or long shirts they’d be great. I am 5’7” 140#. I’m pretty in shape. But if you have ANY cellulite, which I do, you will see it through these leggings. Otherwise good quality. I shouldn’t blame the leggings for my cellulite, but I had purchased other leggings similar to these that were amazing and I can’t seem to find the same ones. These weren’t them. Also worth mentioning, I had purchased the mustard color. So maybe that didn’t help."
3.0,Item runs big would recommend a size smaller
3.0,Poor quality brake so easy ?
3.0,It's not awful but if I were to do it again I wouldn't buy it.
3.0,I bought this specifically to hold my IPhone 8. I guess it would fit but without my phone cover. Have to send it back.
3.0,Too small for my child’s head
3.0,I love the bag. Disappointed that the zipper broke and I haven't had the bag that long.
3.0,"Had to pay to get it altered. Was too long, almost like a dress."
3.0,"I got what I paid for.<br />The picture on Amazon is not really indicative of what I received. The black enamel was haphazardly applied and looked cheap. If the buckle looked like the product picture I would've been ecstatic. However the Nickel had a satin finish, the black enamel was SHINY as heck, and not in all the places it should've been.<br /><br />The buckle I received didn't look antiqued life the photo, I tried to figure out how to do that on my own, as the product was inexpensive. No dice. Like I said, I got what I paid for."
3.0,"The shirts are comfortable, but they are not as tight as I had hoped. I ordered based on the sizing chart - I should have ordered a Medium, I should have ordered a Small."
3.0,"The outfit doesn't really look like the picture. The belt is definitely not the same so if you are looking for that, it isn’t as full and scarf looking as the pictures imply. It looks like someone saw the outfit and did a fairly decent attempt at copying its general look, but if you had the outfit pictured and the one I received you’d be able to tell it’s not the same. I kept it because I was more interested in the color than the style. But if you are looking for the outfit pictured, you’ll be disappointed. (I’ll try to attach a picture later)."
3.0,"Within a few uses of hanging this in a bathroom when traveling, the lining started to split.  It still works, but just not great quality.  Nice that it has so many little zippers to store various things."
3.0,"This item is listed as a comfy loose fit, it's not, it's a normal fit...which as it turns out for me was perfect and I love it.  I purchased another which was listed as a &#34;normal&#34; fit, but it was actually a comfy, loose fit which turned out to be way too large for me.  Could be someone mixed up the descriptions.  This is actually a 5 star product, the lack of another 2 stars is because the description did not match the fit."
3.0,It fit ok. Just not enough support in the boob area. This would look cute if you have smaller boobs. I'm 5'8&#34; 220. I wear a 36DDD.
3.0,Way too small. I gave it too may niece that six sizes smaller than me.
3.0,"Decent quality for the money, for sure. They’re cheap polarized sunglasses. They’re sturdy enough, although the lenses on half of the six pairs I’ve owned tend to want to pop out periodically. Product comes with some nice extras and a good case.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this product however is the tint of the glasses. They are polarized, not very effectively, but are. However, I never realized how better quality sunglasses manage to shield your eyes from bright objects and light without dimming darker objects too much until I got these glasses. It’s weird, but if I’m on the beach at noon on a sunny day, these glasses are keeping my eyes comfortable, but if I look toward the shady area underneath the pier, it’s impossible to see. With higher quality sunglasses, I can see it. Not sure how, but the tint on these lenses makes not so bright areas very dark."
3.0,Nice but large
3.0,I like the style of this shirt however it didn't seem to fit my body type properly. I'm normally between a size large to extra large depending on the shirt. I am big chested so that's probably what makes the difference for me going up a size. I purchased this shirt in black size X-Large. The fit was a little small for me. I have big arms so my arms did feel squeezed into this shirt. Also the chest part kept popping open on the right side creating this unflattering flap by my chest. I did like how long the back side was but I felt as though the front was a little too short for me. The material is nice & the style is cute just not on my larger frame. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
3.0,Quality  did not meet my expectation
3.0,"I loved the way it looked fit great<br />The quality was not so great, back of the shirt had multiple pulls in the fabric"
3.0,"The jewelry is pretty and inexpensive, but they didn't stay in place well and my bridesmaids were adjusting the necklaces all night"
3.0,The durability was not good. The back pack is already coming apart at seams. And it is being carried by a little girl.
3.0,"I can not wear the top. I am a 34DD, and it looked like I had two floats attached to my body. Not for the heavy set women."
3.0,Cute but it fit a little baggy around the shoulders and chest and im a 38DD
3.0,Is a bit cheap looking.
3.0,"It has open elastic for the back of the straps. I'm waiting to compare it to the rest of my outfit, but I will probably return it fit this reason. There is no picture or description of this feature."
3.0,Looks great but it’s long and turn roasted
3.0,"Although this is one of the best products that I've found thus far, it still isn't something I'd purchase again. I use it as a sleeping bonnet. It does not stay on during the night. I have mid back length locs that are thick. The weight of my locs seem too heavy for the elastic band that holds the cap on."
3.0,"Lightweight, so great for summer.  I wore as a dress several times this summer - a couple of times with the provided belt, then opted to dress up with a silver or gold link/chain belt.  I also saw someone else where as a shirt with capri length leggings.  Both are very cute looks. I was, however, very disappointed after about 5 washes (all on the delicate/hand wash cycle in cold water) because the dress is ripping along the buttons.  The rip is not in the seam, and the fabric is actually shredding.  It can't be repaired so as much as I loved the dress, it seems it is a one season wonder.  Although it was very inexpensive, I still didn't expect it to fall apart after washing."
3.0,Fits great. But the waist rolls down if you’re not on the sweet spot. The legs roll up. Kinda sad about it but if you adjust it just right they will be perfect
3.0,"I thought with this style it would have a more comfortable fit, but it fits tight and you can't adjust it"
3.0,really cute earrings but these earrings can not be stainless steel.
3.0,tab bit large but I have a small head
3.0,"The sizing of the shirt is extremely small.  I wear the same size in all shirts...until this.  I'm guessing it's overseas sizing instead of U.S. sizing.  If you have breasts, go up 2 sizes. Otherwise, hello spandex and goodbye nightshirt."
3.0,The fit is ok and it looks like the pictures. I wasn't super impressed with the quality of the material.
3.0,"The Five Senses watch has a great dial that you can tell the time (analog) at a glance. (See image) It's a very thick watch, but it has a lot of gizmos, including speakers for the visually impaired. The first challenge was getting it synched to my iPhone Xs with iOS 15.6.1—not the latest model but up-to-date OS. My advice is to first read the printed materials then go ahead with the guided connection to the 5 Senses App that you download to your cell phone. (Apple or Google Play) I tried to do it the easy way by installing the app using the QR code boxes and iPhone camera. Easy to download and install on my iPhone. Stepping through the steps turned out to be a challenge and by dumb luck I finally got the magic combination and my watch and phone were synched... time on watch and phone were the same. (The second hand on the watch starts  quickly spinning, but a very slow way to synch ... did not jump to the correct time right away but went on a long journey a second at a time.) One of the issues was that the image of the watch appears to show the back of the watch —no dial image--[see photo] and so I was pushing the wrong button at 4 o'clock. [Read the printed directions first.] The watch does come with an extra battery and tool for opening the back, but as for a ""talking phone"" ... I wouldn't chance grandma's med-reminders to a pin hole speaker up against the wrist. While eyesight fades with age; so too does hearing."
3.0,"Very cute and functional since the buttons are just for show- dress cannot open. However, the material was very uncomfortable. It was almost like a bathing suit cover up material. Very tough and polyester-like. Not soft or flowy like the picture. I ordered a large and it fit like a S/M. Size up."
3.0,Neat product and very useful. Great that it comes in a set of two! The only drawback is that elastic got damaged after first wash.
3.0,The quality of the hoodie itself seems fine. The graphics were what I wanted and were fine.  The sizing information listed for the hoodie I purchased was not useful. I ordered a medium for my 16 yo grandson since he wears a medium in every other hoodie he owns. The hoodie I received was at best a youth medium. Way too small for a normal teen boy.
3.0,"They are cool looking pants but they are so thin, they are basically see through.. 😨😲"
3.0,Item was good. The one size fits all doesn’t work for people like me that has a big fat head and neck. 😕
3.0,"The colors are nice, however the &#34;flowers&#34; are a little warped and smeared, like maybe these are &#34;seconds&#34; But, for the price, it is very nice and you can tell that the beads are glass and not plastic. Very colorful and on a nice chain."
3.0,There should’ve been a medium-large.<br />I wear a 91/2 shoe-these socks go way over my knees.<br />They’re good quality-I ordered previously but they were the right size.
3.0,It works fine but they are like red in it that comes through. It's not black and it's not pretty.
3.0,"Nice shoe, a bit tight in the toebox though."
3.0,"Looks ok, but it was cheaply made.<br />I’m still hanging it up!"
3.0,"I LOVE this but I couldn't figure out how to get into it.  The concealed zip helped, but I am way too big.  RETURNED SADLY :("
3.0,I spect fit but is big
3.0,Ok product. Not as sturdy as expected.
3.0,Pretty Desighn however cut narrow through the hips :(
3.0,Darker purple than expected. A little thin but will work.
3.0,I loved the color and the fit however they showed too much of the private area.
3.0,I got for button attachment. It was not easy to use.
3.0,Measurements are misleading. Too small.
3.0,"They are nice plugs, but wrong size - they are 4g, not 2. Or at least the pair they sent me was not a 2."
3.0,"The nice thing about this, is it does hide imperfections while being ""sheer"". The con is that it is rough on the skin."
3.0,"Too many patches, short zipper and bad metal closeure."
3.0,"I ordered the baby blue, but in no way did the color look like the marketing photo!!  The one I received was drab and a muted dull grayish blue. See photos...<br />It fit perfectly. True to size."
3.0,"I love the cut of this dress. The pattern is very flattering to my curvy frame. However,  this was just a little too snug plus the first one I ordered had obviously been a return as it had a huge makeup stain in several places on the white of the sleeves and neck.  So, I'm giving it another go, returning the large and ordering the next size up, hopefully without the makeup from a previous person."
3.0,I own the original factory Moto 360 black metal band and it cost me $75. The Ritche is a good knock of the Moto 360 band.However the Ritche band did not feel comfort on my wrist. The Moto 360 band metal was more polish than the Ritche. I did not like the Ritche button buckle when you snap close the band. There is no button buckle on the Moto 360. The fit and finish is excellent on the Moto 360 band v Ritche. I would recommend the Ritche as a second back up band.
3.0,"They arrived on time and fit as expected.  However, within a day two of the plastic decorative buttons came off and there are a few places where the stitching has loose threads.  They are not tight on me, so it isn't a matter of being stretched too far.  I wear long shirts over these, so the lost buttons don't bother me, but it might be annoying for someone else who would be pairing these with shorter shirts.  Overall I like them well enough, they are comfortable and do a good job of resembling blue jeans, though with the lacking in durability I wouldn't buy another pair unless they were more in the 12-15 dollar range."
3.0,Thought this was a regular cotton T-shirt. It looks more like a blouse with a pajama material feel. Its very thin. It has the microfiber feel.
3.0,"My daughter grew up in Stride-Rite shoes from 24 months to 5/6 years old (they just fit her the best, compared to other brands). The Made2Play Maxwell shoe is very cute/stylish but beware they run narrow my daughter can not wear them, will end up gifting to my niece. Stride-Rite is famous for their early walkers and toddler shoes, and we loved them too but now that my daughter wears a size 13 little kids (2nd grade) Stride-Rite just doesn't make good shoes for older kids a shame. School requires close toe shoes fro kids so we have switched to Champion, Sketchers and NewBalance for best fitting shoes being we need wider fit tennis shoes/playground shoes/running shoes with Velcro and/or elastic closures."
3.0,"This is cute and fits as a shrug not a sweater, but the color is not like the picture at all. It's more of an olive"
3.0,it was cool but i really didnt get as many positive response as i thought and the metal is very cheap
3.0,Runs small in my opinion. Plus the fabric is super thin - like as thin as some of my chiffon shirts. It didn't appear to be see thru but then again I tried it on at night so who knows how it would hold up in the day time. Additionally I found the collar to be very tight around the neck. Returned.
3.0,I didn’t know how to attach it to my phone so I returned it.
3.0,"This item has a clean, crisp and casual look to it. When I tried this item on it appeared to be a couple of sizes smaller than what I ordered and I am a petite woman .  The sellers are very honorable people and want their customers to be satisfied so they state that they have resized it and are also stating that they will refund my money after receiving my feedback .  If it has, indeed, been resized it might be a fun, casual and sexy top to wear on a hot day.  I would still suggest that a buyer order it in a larger size than you usually wear."
3.0,"Its really cute - but if you want it to look like the picture, need to by at least 2 sizes bigger than normal.  Runs very small - she must be wearing an XL in the picture for it to look nice and loose like that."
3.0,"Only giving this 3/5 stars as the cut needs some help. When you walk, you will have to hold the dress in place unless you want to flash your underwear to the world, same for when it's windy. Might be okay if you're short but if you're not, the cut in the front is questionable. The arms are also very tiny, and I don't have big arms. So if you have bigger arms, beware, this dress is not cut very well."
3.0,Its cool but the finish started peeling in a week.<br />You get what you pay for I guess.<br />Wish they would offer a higher quality one.
3.0,This dress pattern is definitely lovely on the photo.  In reality the colors do not match at all.  The red is glaring red not the look of the photo. I actually re order it accidentally thinking why don't have this dress yet to realize I have<br />three and it is on account of picture and reality do not match even remotely.  I would love to have one that actually<br />looks like the advertisement.  Just wearing it gardening and running around the house.  It is made well.
3.0,"Fits as expected, bought for my 10 year old.  I was surprised that it came with no tags, no liners and not in any packaging.  It appeared used and faded.  I inquired about this and was told that the manufacturer sends them tagless.  The stitching in the back was popping out.  It is not even remotley close to the colors and brightness on the picture. It looks like it was washed and faded several times."
3.0,"We bought these for a school play and they served that purpose. They just weren’t as much of a quality product as we were expecting for the price. They looked the part, and fit decently even though there were different age groups of kids."
3.0,To big so I had to order another one in medium waiting for it today but my advice if you wear a large get a medium...  For the most part is a nice blazer
3.0,"They were a little too bit and wide on the sides, I have a small face so I think it didn't look good on me although, I did get many compliments. I will return these."
3.0,"I don't think these shoes are nearly as cute and person, and honestly look and feel cheap.<br />They are also made big, I'd say .5 too big.<br />I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,"This necklace has a pretty design, but I was disappointed in the quality.  The finishing on the backs of the quatrefoils is deficient, and they are hollowed out, no doubt to skimp on the silver."
3.0,Beautiful dress!! Fits a bit snuggled in the top area<br />Going to try one size up
3.0,Didn’t know it was just gonna be a vinyl sticker on a hat. Anyone with a cricket can do that.
3.0,Bought for second hand smoke. Can still smell smoke thru it. Not sure if it's actually working.
3.0,Runs a half size too small around the waist.
3.0,Made fairly cheaply but cute
3.0,"I sent this item back.  I thought I ordered a women's watch and this was huge, way too big for my wrist"
3.0,"Very nice. The only issue, I can't get the links out and will have to take it to a<br />Jewelry store for them to be removed."
3.0,Fits kind of weird. The sleeves are shorter then expected. But it is cute.
3.0,"This fits well, but the quality isn't the greatest.  I love the design, though."
3.0,pick up for my son birthday too too small
3.0,The material is not very good quality it’s already getting a little bit all over the whole top where the materials coming loose. I can’t remember what you call that it just looks like a bunch of dots
3.0,"This is a cool idea, and is good for traveling but don't find it's use to be so efficient. I don't know, maybe I need more time."
3.0,Wasn't loose ENOUPH to b comfy
3.0,The fabric has no lining and I was going to return it but my daughter loves the print so we kept it.
3.0,"It's ok, very sheer, the arm holes are kinda weird I had to adjust to fit me properly. It's a cute top, you can tell you didn't spend a fortune on this but it's not terrible either. It's cute for a casual look but that's all you are gonna get from it a very casual look."
3.0,I was very surprised to find little elasticity in the waist. What was FOL thinking?  Not very comfortable if there is no give.
3.0,"A little too small for me, but didn’t know how to return. It was a very pretty color and I got compliments on it."
3.0,Light weight but a ltitle small.
3.0,Like it.. Doesn't fit like the pic above but still ok.
3.0,"This shirt is made from a very cheap, crappy material. Maybe polyester. I ordered the largest size- for the comfort factor. In doing so, the &#34;Hole&#34; is kind of distorted and warped. Plus, the shipping was odd- it had to go through customs, and was not delivered in the packaging, that made it obvious that it was from amazon. It is one of those things where the phrase, &#34;you get what you paid for&#34; is very true."
3.0,So pretty and dainty exactly as shown but before i got a chance to wear it clasp was broken 😥
3.0,"While the band seems pretty comfortable, it was very difficult to get the band attached.  I've swapped bands on my Fitbits for years and I've never had this much trouble!  Good thing you sent 2 extra posts, because 2 of them went flying and I still haven't been able to find them!  Guess the vacuum cleaner will."
3.0,Beautiful shirt but it was waaaay too small.
3.0,"I order XL and the were way.......too big! I have to send them back but will reorder. I went up a size, I normally wear a large. But oops didn't  fit"
3.0,Small was far too large. I am 5’6 130 lbs. They feel great and are nice quality but wish they offered an XS option.
3.0,It wasn’t big enough for me and I was using it at the smallest part of my waist. Barely got it to tie and it bunched up.
3.0,"Loved the dress to begin with, but after a few washes it has started to really thin and look way more worn than it is. I have not put it in the dryer either."
3.0,The material looks cheap but the dress is nice. A few loose strings but I cut them off. Fits nice.
3.0,"These slippers are very soft and at this time - worn 3 days still cushy.<br />Problem is the size.  I ordered a 9-10 since I wear a nine and they are probably a 10.<br />Foot slips around inside, and if not for the bungie they would slip off.  The bungie looks strange since I have about a good 1 1/2 inches of the cord hanging out."
3.0,"I have purchased these socks in the past and love them. They are comfy and cozy. Unfortunately, I only received 2 pair of socks instead of 6. Seems odd. Maybe 4 more are on the way?"
3.0,"I love the style, but they just extended the wrist band.  Too big for my wrist even though it said small and large...really only large."
3.0,"Don't fit well into the glasses, they wiggle around with barely waving the glasses back and forth and even walking. quailty is way less than original Arnette ones. Wish I could find original one... Polarized lenses part are nice"
3.0,I am sure they would have been nice if I had gotten them.
3.0,"I loved the cut & color of the shirt,  it was the fabric that is terrible.  It's stretchy & rubbery feeling. I thought it would have a soft cotton feeling, it's doesn't."
3.0,Was thinner than I expected.
3.0,It is not made of what I thought it would he however it is very cute and for the price a keeper for sure!
3.0,"Not as expected. Way too high rise and not as shown on the model-on model it is below the belly button and these are way above that on me. Also, I don't like the zippers on the side and it was not shown that there is pink (the worst of all colors) on the inside of the band. Going to return. On a positive note, made from a really nice quality material."
3.0,Nice but feel on the small side especially the carry on
3.0,"I like these leggings - they are comfortable, soft and easy to pull on and off. They go great under dresses or skirts in the winter. However - 3 star rating instead of five, because they did not come as pictured. These leggings are far longer than what is pictured, and go all the way down to my ankles!!!! I am 5'9 and not short by any means, so I felt a little annoyed when I got these that I couldn't wear them as pictured, especially since I like tights at mid calf under skirts and dresses way more than to ankle. Also the material is a little bit see-through but not too bad."
3.0,The color changed fast
3.0,the straps are not right so I had to add a connection to the straps to keep them from falling. otherwise very comfortably soft & pretty. I purchased a size Large my size is 36 inches & under is 32 inches. I hope this help you all! :)
3.0,had to order an XL the large ran smaller than expected and i'm a size 8.  shoulder straps are very uncomfortable.  but the zipper in the crotch area is the best feature.
3.0,"Thick material, well made but sizing runs a little small"
3.0,"Pretty, but smaller than I realized, but great price"
3.0,Not good for mid impact. Better for low impact. Definitely don't buy this if you plan to jog in it.
3.0,"The white is much more see through, especially the buns, then anticipated.  I guess I didn't read the reviews.  I don't mind too much as they do fit nicely and look great, just the public pool tends to stare a little more than normal right after I exit the pool.<br /><br />The very bad news, after 4 swims, in two places, the stitching is coming off.  I'm certain in another 10 to 15 swims I'll have to replace these and I would only purchase these for light swimming/show only."
3.0,I had to use safety pins to pin it to my bra to prevent slippage
3.0,Fit is good except for the calf. The zipper broke when I tried to zip up.
3.0,"Bought this to use in a theatrical production and it reads beautifully from the audience, however, the material is similar to a midrange Halloween costume.  It is very thin. I would not have minded if the price reflected the quality of the material.You will definitely need a hoop or petticoat underneath."
3.0,It was great for about 4 months. Then the leather split and now it is unusable.
3.0,to  heavy but like colors
3.0,For the price I expected them to be softer.  They have a nice texture but it feels rough.  But it was hard to find green socks.
3.0,More brief than boxer. I wear them as a last resort.
3.0,"Worked OK, but becomes heavy when filled."
3.0,"Cute but disappointed,  it states that you can cuddle and touch it, after reading the book,<br /> those are not the rules. That's the only reason I went with this instead of the elf on the shelf. I thought my kids would touch the elf and everyone would be freaked out and all the fun would be over, turns out the rules are the same in this book. Misleading description!"
3.0,"Loses its shape in the wash. Shrunk weirdly, even though it was washed in cold water and hung to dry."
3.0,Cute dress. The color a little more orange red than I had hoped but it worked nicely. Quality not the best but not too bad for the cost.
3.0,The dress is big for an extra small
3.0,"I played with pop beads as a kid.  They came in one size, and they were twice as big as the ones I bought."
3.0,"The color and look is like wood, im very happy with that. The bar between the two ends is pretty long in length and doesnt fit just right but its still cool to look at."
3.0,"Gave it to my daughter, I read the sizing before I ordered but it was still too small. Arms are small. Good quality and make other than that. My daughter likes it."
3.0,I got this sweater for my mom she says really really cute but it was extremely big on her so I decided to take it back
3.0,The seam at the slit at the thigh wasn’t strong
3.0,I liked the style but it was to big
3.0,Bummed because it's see thru.
3.0,"So I usually wear a xl on top and 2x on the bottom because of my hips and butt. I went with the 3x just in case since I know Halloween costumes always run small. Well I’m glad I did lol. The body suit itself fit a little snug and I can’t zipper it. It honestly looks fine unzipped  since I have the cape, you can’t even tell. The cape could probably fit anyone and it’s decent quality. The bodysuit is also decent quality besides the size problem. The little belt accessory is definitely cheap and I feel like it’ll fall apart once I put it on, but nothing a little glue can’t fix. To sum everything up, definitely size up!!"
3.0,"I wouldn't call these ski socks. They're not thick, and only somewhat warm. I have MUCH better warm winter socks, which I like a lot better (higher wool content, better insulation, etc). These socks are tall (come to just under my knee), and they're reasonably well made, and of decent materials for what they are, which is a tall, basic, nice-fitting sock. If you want something warm or thick, I'd keep looking."
3.0,"The design of this jumpsuit is really cute but the color wasn’t flattering on me. With my olive skin tone it made me look washed out. Also it was a tad snug at the waist (I’m a size 10 or 30” for jeans - I got the L for this jumpsuit), and I didn’t like the belt with the 2 loose ends."
3.0,Hermosa pero no supe escoger el color
3.0,"Stitching at the bottom seams come loose after a couple weeks. This is my third time buying ""Twitch"" merchandise and they all seem to be poor quality. Please do better"
3.0,Cute pajamas but after one washing they are much too small now.
3.0,I absolutely love these shoes! I wore them standing/walking 16-hours a day and they are truly comfortable. I only gave the product a three star rating because after 6-9 months of wearing them the insoles began to slip up towards the heel making them uncomfortable/unwearable. I may have wore them down quickly and wished they lasted longer.
3.0,"Once I figured out how to place them on, I did enjoy this bra for a one time use. It held up and lasted throughout the day. However I was indoors all day in the AC and I felt anytime I started to sweat it was getting more and more loose. The first set was a loss as whenever I kept adjusting it the sticky lost its hold and I had to discard them. So that was $10 gone. They did not have enough ‘sticky’ to reuse them. I have nursed a baby for over a year and have a large ‘hanging’ bust so it’s hard to find a backless bra, this did work though for the time being. So in the event of needing something again I would use it! My dress I wore though also kind of held my bust together which gave me some peace of mind, I wouldn’t be comfortable wearing these having a large bust if I was going to be outside in a hot climate or with loose clothing on."
3.0,Not what expected as was i was doing with.
3.0,"Bought these and they fit great at first.  Then I washed them (in cold water) and they shrunk a bit.  As a woman with an hour glass figure, this makes it hard to keep them up on the hips, and I usually have long on the leg.  These are pretty short."
3.0,Nice quality fabric. I wear a medium/size 6-8 and it was snug on my hips. It was returned.
3.0,"Only 3 stars because I really loved wearing these instead of shoes at an outdoor wedding, but they broke half way through. The links that were soldered snapped. I wasn't rough with them, they just didn't hold up. Good thing I had 2 pairs & swapped them out, but still.... cheap. These are one-time accessories."
3.0,The glove is good it's good havy matarial work good with hot water but when you come to clean utensils it's not going to make nice grip..i order for me to cline utensils because i have some allergies from liquid shop but the glove not make nice grip when glove are shoppy ..you can use for bathroom cliening or other work
3.0,Too long for me that's not what hurts me but quality is not good rhat it looks like..
3.0,Armpit area is a bit loose
3.0,Very cute but didn’t  work upon receipt I will have to have a working battery put in the watch. I think when you buy something it should be in working order upon receipt. My other watches I’ve ordered at a lesser price worked! I’m just saying! Anyhoo other than that it’s adorable!
3.0,"not a fan of this shirt, I'm 6'1 185 and the US large was too small. the neck hole was what I liked in the pictures but in reality looked like a womens design. might be loved by someone else but not my cup of tea. I gave it an extra star cuz mt teenage son liked it and snagged it"
3.0,"Ame el diseño y su significado por eso lo adquirí, lo uso con bastante frecuencia y noto con el paso del tiempo que ya el producto está enrojecido por un lado, ya no luce tan bien, pensé que era de mejor calidad"
3.0,LOVE the earrings.  Great size and quality.  Wires are much wider than picture shows.  Too big and painful to wear.  Will probably return because of that.
3.0,Cute but not what i expected. It kinda looks like a suspender and it Dosent really Tighten the way i want. But still cute if you want a cute accessory to ur outfit.
3.0,These run small.  There's also a bump in the pad that feels bulky and weird.
3.0,Little more high maintenance as I would have thought. But for the price it is spot on
3.0,"Bought this for my  it gave him a nice fit but I find the fabric to be too hard, perhaps rinsing it in water might make a big difference I'm not sure"
3.0,They strip easily.
3.0,"Has no strap for your wrist. Very heavy. Too big to carry in your purse everyday. The reflective edge is nice. Having an attached light is nice. Press the button and it pops open or shut, however, it is very hard to push back into original position."
3.0,The fit is great and I don't mind the fabric overall. It is just the white style that is nearly see-through and unwearable in a work place.
3.0,"I was expecting these to be thicker than they are, they are quite thin.  They are essentially long underwear for around the house.  I have a 34&#34;36&#34; waist and I ordered XXL and they fit fine.  Just make sure you look at the size chart.  I received these at a discount for my honest review."
3.0,"Cute, holds hair back well, but it doesn’t breathe."
3.0,"Not as good as described, specially not comfortable for workout"
3.0,"package arrived and the crystal came broken, chipped and not placed in correctly"
3.0,"It is a pretty piece of jewelry.  That being said, the leaf is large enough that it would look much better hanging from a longer chain, rather than on the 20 inch chain I ordered."
3.0,"It fits a bit larger than I was expecting, wished I had ordered an extra small. Hoping it'll shrink in the wash a bit"
3.0,My husband didn't like the fit.  It was too loose for his tastes.
3.0,very light smaller than expected  ok fashion jewelry
3.0,"The color was as shown but the hat brim was rather floppy. From the photo I thought it would be stiff, which is what I was really looking for. I returned this item."
3.0,Cute cute band but it runs large and I ended up having to superglue because the clips weren't sticking well to my Fitbit.
3.0,got the job done --- fine
3.0,Not right sizing
3.0,Fits a few sizes smaller than stated.
3.0,Came a little wrinkled
3.0,"Very,very,very,very tiny. Maybe size up if you want real accuracy"
3.0,Absolutely loved this suit. Bought it in multiple colors. The color faded super fast tho in chlorine. Not sure how else to prevent that but it faded after one wear. Still love them.
3.0,"The skirt was a bit too long. At the knee cap. But I’m short, 4’11 and 1/2 and weigh 104. So depends on your height."
3.0,These converters look nice but twist and do not hold heavier earrings.
3.0,"Bello producto, pero muy grande! Conviene comprarlo un talle menos del que se cree."
3.0,Design is good. Gave good service while lasted. It only lasted a week before the lenses keep falling out.
3.0,"Good wallet so long as you don't mind either carrying your ID and 6 to 8 cards, along with about 5 bills. Otherwise it's so tight you need pliers to remove a card."
3.0,"This is a cute skirt, however, it was definitely not as slimming as the picture makes it look.  The skirt is much puffier than the picture depicts.  It made me look bigger than I am.  Did not compliment me. I returned it.  I did love the frill and scallops on the bottom of the skirt."
3.0,They are too small from my husband
3.0,these feel nice in.  No problems with them except cannot really tell which ones are which color except the black ones. Still a good purchase.
3.0,I bought l-xl.  I wear size l or 14.  I ended up giving it to my daughter who wears a size 6-8 or sml.  Not true to fit at all
3.0,"Big enough in almost every aspect EXCEPT LENGTH. If you are an adult of 5ft 6in or more get a size up because, otherwise, they will be high-waters."
3.0,"Like color and material, but sewing not really good > look my pic"
3.0,"The shoes were great and looked great with the costume however, on a comfort level they were awful.  I wear heels every day and figured these would be no problem but by the end of the night I was wearing flats.  I still wear them regardless.  Look great with skinnies or a dress/skirt."
3.0,"It is well made and super soft but the picture and the description lead me to believe it was a tunic. It is actually a tee shirt with pockets. I basically need more booty coverage. If it would've been a high/low garment,  it would be perfect. I'll just wear it around the house...my husband already knows about the chunky booty situation. ;)"
3.0,"It's a pain to get them closed.  Especially once your fiddling around your septum to try and close it without hurting yourself.  Otherwise, good product."
3.0,These glasses were amazing and my daughter loved them because they were the only ones we could find that blocked the sun best for her (she has sensitive blue eyes) but only after a few times of wearing them and not using them roughly the arm snapped off when she went to put them on. Do not recommend especially if you have a child that plays more rough.
3.0,The hoodie I received  was a much lighter purple and teal than in the picture but the quality of the hoodie is good.
3.0,It was cute. See thru even though it has a lining. I excepted it to fit small. I bought 2 the medium had black marks on it.
3.0,STUNK very bad upon arrival. Aired them outside for 2 days prior to wearing.<br />The lights fell out of one of them which made my little girl cry. Must be mindful of where the batter pack is when placing on young children. It can cause lots discomfort on a car ride. But cute skirts. Bought for my 2 year old and 4 year old. Fit them both.
3.0,"I followed the size chart and it fit as expected. I usually wear a size L, but ended up ordering the XXL. It fit perfectly, but I returned it for two reasons. First, the lace didn't look as high quality as in the picture; it looked really cheap and kind of reminded me of lace curtains that my grandma used to have. Second, in the picture, it appears as though the sleeves are separate pieces with their own elastic. In reality, they were all connected with one piece of elastic which made the shirt difficult to move around in."
3.0,"They're adorable. Seriously, if you're in it for style, I recommend these. Also not bad for driving--the material grips well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they do absolutely nothing to keep my hands warm. The faux leather seems to absorb cold, and I'm talking simple cold air--not from touching snow or freezing metal, and transfers the cold to my hands.<br /><br />Gave me the motivation to repair my cozy wool gloves, at least."
3.0,Ehhhh it was too big I was going to return it but decided to get alterations done
3.0,Smaller than i imaged but still very detailed
3.0,I wasn’t impressed on the sewing and finishing of a seam right in front on the left collar.  It was ran big and looked really frumpy on me.  I’m returning it.
3.0,Worked for the Fourth of July. They ended up breaking but wasn’t too upset about it because I didn’t pay a lot of money for them.
3.0,This dress is described as &#34;loose fitting&#34; and even has a loose look to it in the pictures. I was assuming it would fit like a normal t-shirt dress. This dress hugged my entire body minus the bottom of it. The material is nice but I don't like the way it fits so I will be returning. Side note: I usually always wear a medium but get dresses in a large so that they are looser. I got this in a large and it's still very snug through the torso/chest/butt area.
3.0,I wear it around the house and to bed sometimes
3.0,They are WAY TOO BIG for hard work scrubbing. Wouldn’t stay on my hands to even try to use. I returned them unused. Just too big.
3.0,I normally wear a size 4. I order the small and it was too loose.
3.0,i like the shape but it’s a little see through. I am 5’4 125 and the medium fits well. Will be using as a beach cover up
3.0,The bulova's original is best
3.0,"Make sure to read the dimensions very well, bigger size might have been better. Not enough space for multiple phones."
3.0,"Not only were they too small (all of my leggings are size L, I weigh 165), they were also not high waisted by any means. I got them for very cheap so I gave them to a smaller friend of mine, lol....."
3.0,So after reading other review i thought would be great for my stick of daughter who is 5. There small enough in the legs but way to long . she needs 8-10 in length but about 6 in the waist. length was just too long. Very warm tho
3.0,Pretty and for the cost the quality is okay.
3.0,"Basic watch.  The elapsed time function (stop watch) only counts to 59.99 MINUTES.  It will not measure an elapsed time of more than one hour.<br />So, if you need stop watch function that commonly exceeds 59 minutes (like cooking a Thanksgiving turkey for 3.5 hours, you might want to purchase a different watch."
3.0,The shirt is super soft and comfortable but the design is a very weird material. It is like a very thick plastic feeling design. I feel this would easily peel off if I tried. Not bleached at all this is like someone printed the design off and pressed it to the shirt.
3.0,You pay for what you get. I don't use it with the straps because it never worked. But it's still a cute purse
3.0,"These were a bit of a let down but I think I’m going to keep them to give them a try? I ordered the L (8/10)<br />The bad:<br />-they are a strange length. I am only 5’5”-5’6” and these weren’t quite as long as I’d like but at least I can just wear them with sandals<br />-the waist runs small and is tough to get over my hips (I’m pear shaped). The saving grace is that once they are on, they look and feel fine…just kind of a pain to get on<br /><br />The good:<br />-beautiful pattern and color!<br />-the fabric isn’t itchy and it is lightweight so could be worn in the spring and summer<br />-I like the belt and that it’s detachable"
3.0,"I really like this robe. But the zipper is separating at the bottom. I was trying to contact the company but to get help but couldn’t get a hold of them. I want the same thing, hoping it’s just defective. I really like the style. I’m hoping they read the review and contact me."
3.0,Cute but fits like a sock.
3.0,The cap is very flimsy and not made with quality
3.0,I loved the material of this material but me being a plus sized female should not have ordered this product. I weigh roughly 270 and I am 5'7 and 3/4. My only issue with this is the really tight fit. I wished that this was made for women with curves. I can say that the packaging was professional as well as the item being exactly as described.
3.0,"As with any clothing item from China, you have to do research on sizing.  I am a size 10 (US) and I ordered the size 42.  It fit well everywhere except the cups.  I'm a full C cup and the swimsuits cups were maybe for a B.  Next time I wear it, I will remove the added cups to see if that makes a difference.  It is a pretty color and nice style."
3.0,Returned. One side was very light instead of the dark it showed also not convinced that this ring would have held up was made very light duty
3.0,"Both pair were made well; however, ran very small."
3.0,"Cute, but broke on the first day"
3.0,"I bought this for my lite great granddaughters birthday<br />The lobster claw clasp was broken an even though it was a less expensive item, it was important to me. But I just didn't want to go though the headache of sending back."
3.0,Not happy with this purchase.. they have send me wrong color
3.0,"Beautiful tie, nice color good Fabric, But come with a lot oil spots"
3.0,"The look is great, but tends to loosen as I wear it. Afraid it will slip off"
3.0,It took forever to come but it was super cute when it finally arrived.
3.0,The dress fits pretty much as expected. It mostly like the picture it has the design and color but it’s cut a little difference the waist line is up higher than pictured and  it looks cheap and the material is thin it’s not really what I expected. But I will keep it.
3.0,"I got these boots for my boyfriend. We both liked them a lot. In fact, he loved them so much he wore them almost daily. Only a few months later, the soles completely detached from the bottom. This is a result from just walking to his car and to/from classes each day. Tried shoe glue but they just got worse with time. Other than falling apart, the shape of the boot itself held up and they looked nice overall; he had no complaints about comfort aside from needing longer socks. Regardless, I have to say I probably won’t be buying them again."
3.0,"The pictures do not do this justice - it is ULTRA BRIGHT. If that is what you are going for, this will be great for you. I would call this a light weight sweater - it is not going to keep you warm in the cold as it's an open & loose knit. I think it's quality is just at what you pay for it. It wasn't what I ended up wanting, but it might be right for you."
3.0,"The small section with the buttons is to narrow for my personal preference, but even then this shirt has worn out quickly. The material is very thin and cheap."
3.0,"So, this is a tricky product to review.  I bought a medium, and the quality was beautiful.  However, the openings at the top were slightly bigger than I wanted, so I decided to try a small.  The small was a completely different product.  The lace top was a different style, the silicone grips were different, and the material itself felt thinner and less soft.  I couldn't believe it.  What the f, man?  How do they get away with something like that?  So, I kept the medium and decided to just take in the tops and sew them.  You can actually sew through the silicone and it works quite well.  So, I got a nice product out of it, and the end result is a 5-star for me, but I just don't how to rate it since the small was completely different.  So, I guess you're taking your chances a bit with this one."
3.0,Great look but after washing 2 times I ended up wit a hole on the back quality could be better
3.0,"I wanted to like it because it was cute, but upon opening package I noticed at least 3 to 4 stones were missing and they were not in the package.<br />The four leaf clover itself is cute but appears yellowish is not clear like the picture 🙁"
3.0,THIS DRESSS RUNS VERY SMALL. I WEAR A 3X BUT ORDER 4X AND IT WAS STILL SMALL
3.0,Kinda thin
3.0,"This was too small . And I have a small 21"" head. I am returning it."
3.0,cute shirt just needs to be made in appropriate sizes
3.0,🤪
3.0,Top very small but bottoms fit good
3.0,Somewhat large around calf. No way to tighten and the front would move to the side and I had to keep turning to front. Like style and color.
3.0,"So, I like these earrings. They come in a nice box, and they’re pretty. So why the 3 stars? They’re not what’s pictured! I was expecting them to be like asymmetrical - one with the paper clip side up and one down. But they’re both the same.<br /><br />So, yeah. Nice earrings but go into this purchase knowing that you’re not getting what you think."
3.0,"Review provided by spouse:<br /><br />Where to begin on this one...well, it is made from what I would call “workout clothes material” and not a jersey knit that lots of clothes are made out of and easy to pack for travel. Not a fan at all. I’m wearing a small after reading reviews and seeing that others thought it was oversized. It is absolutely oversized. Fir sizing reference, I’m 5’3, 154 and I’m swimming in it! I thought it would be cute to knot the bottom to give it a little shape and boho look, but due to the material a knot would not stay. I also thought maybe it would work as a beach coverup, but the material is too heavy and if it was also a little damp would be even worse."
3.0,Doesn't work well with a large chest
3.0,didn't stop leg cramps
3.0,I should have ordered a bigger size to get the similar fit like the photo
3.0,Too tight in arms...not long enough for a 5'10 woman.
3.0,Liked the softness but it was roughly 1 size too small and it was a x-l just like the other 2 types from this brand we got.  Wont do this 1 again unless we go up a size.  My wife now prefers the front pockets versus the side seam which is surprising!
3.0,The style of these glasses are great! However the nose piece can become uncomfortable after wearing a short while.
3.0,"Bought for my daughter for Christmas. She thought they were going to be too small, but they stretched when she put them on. However, they are not squat proof. You could see her underwear design through them. You will need to wear a long shirt with them."
3.0,"Not the greatest quality. The design is just on one side, which is bizarre for a bandana."
3.0,Bottoms fit but the top was too small
3.0,Good quality fabric and finish. Indent like the sole as much as the one I had before with little rubber dots under.
3.0,For a small person
3.0,A lot of threads so makes me feel it was poor sewing and will be coming undone. Thinner fabric then expected.  Possibly why item on sale  Aware I may need to look for matching thread to do repairs
3.0,The seller is amazing! Nice sunglasses but I wish it's not flimsy.
3.0,"i am surprised the listing says xxl, and it is super tight on me -- like skinny jeans fit on my thighs. disappointed on the fit but the quality is really good. good stitching and very nice material, although it has no stretch or give at all."
3.0,Got it for my boyfriend. He loved it as much as I did. But just didn't do the job.... Always coming unlatched....
3.0,They were super comfy and stretchy they did ride up a little after a few hours of wearing them but overall very nice
3.0,I guess I must have a child sized head this hat was too big and long on me. When I pulled down so the Pom Pom would be centered properly the fold was half way down my nose. Wearing it as intended and the Pom Pom was half way down the back of my head. Such a shame as the hat seems very warm a nice soft angora wool type feel. Maybe I’ll try a kid size in this brand. Really wish that hats came in sizes as one size doesn’t always fit all
3.0,"I believe another posted this as well.  It's fully adequate but was I not leaving the country tomorrow and in a bind for a passport case, I would return it.  It seems to be well made of a nice vinyl and fits my passport, drivers license and 1 credit card.  With that it will close flat.  More cards and it will not.  No cash in it yet either.  If it was leather it would stretch.<br />Again, not leather.  Don't buy it if that is what you expect.  It does look just like the picture.  I bought the brown (luggage tan).  There's no country of origin tags or other product information.  I am so tired of vinyl and other leather-look products being advertised as such.  I suppose I should not complain at $9.99."
3.0,"I fit between a small and a medium. But most of the time medium. I read the reviews and saw that most folks said it ran large. So I purchased the small. However, I think the small is even to loose for me. It's okay if I tuck it in, so I'll keep it. But I don't have the option of letting it hang loose because then I look pregnant!"
3.0,"I normally order XXL on t-shirts because I like them loose.  I did the same with this t-shirt.<br />I checked package to make sure it was an XXL because it looked small.  It is that size on package.  Can't find a size on the actual shirt.<br />The neckline is tight, the length only goes to the top of my hips, arms are way too tight.<br />This shirt is more like a large than an XXL.  Just way too small for me to wear.<br />It would have been a nice shirt if it was sized properly.  Nice material.  Looked like it would be comfortable to wear.  I just can't be the one wearing it."
3.0,"Very cute paired with skinny jeans, but it is a silky fabric with a sheen to it.  I was hoping for more of a jersey, casual top."
3.0,"Seam across instep is painful, toebox is good (ordered wide width) and length was good, just not comfortable to wear."
3.0,They are alright. They slide down more than I would like.
3.0,It’s not the best quality in belts. It do work for what it’s meant for. I don’t think I would repurchase though.<br />It did arrive on time.
3.0,Not a flattering fit. The material was not comfortable either.
3.0,"The shirt is OK, it looks nice but the material has no give in it at all. It feels very tight on the shoulders and arm pit areas."
3.0,Took two pound puppy around several times successfully.  Pup loves to chew on balls from hoodie ties
3.0,"Material isn't want I expected, that is what makes them run a little small."
3.0,"The ominous 3 star review...ahh, here it goes.  I'm in my 40's, 5'7 and always looking for swimsuit bottoms to cover up the inevitability of time & tacos on my hips/thighs.  This is NOT one of those bottoms.  At best, it will minimize ""thut"" area cellulite but that's about it. It would be adorable on me at age 25, but alas, times change.  That being said, the quality was fair for the price, it is that black, smooth, ""shiny"" material with a lot of slip.  I would ""on par"" quality with Target or Kohl's, not Athleta or Nike.  Hope that helps!!!"
3.0,I’m keeping and with tuck in my jeans.  It’s fanned out at the bottom.  Kind of large.
3.0,The dresses arrived on time that I ordered! However the top part of the dress is see through and I the under arm part is pretty big. So I just need to take that in. Otherwise I'm happy with my order.
3.0,If you want it to look like the picture than order a size bigger. My medium is a bit snug.
3.0,Chain is very short but the bracelet is very nice
3.0,Didn’t provide full coverage on butt! She kept picking it out!
3.0,Not very comfortable and very big
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:f0e78145761120a5ffebe2f53c9c4256]] Beautiful flowy dress that is true to color. I ordered dusty rose size 16. I am 5'10 and typically wear between 16-18. This dress is long and is perfect for tall girls. The lace up back is perfect to tighten or loosen if needed and creates a flawless look in front. The straps are not adjustable but once laced up, they seem to stay in place. The dress does have built in bra which kept chest in place. There are 2 layers chiffon and a soft silk that is soft to touch and not see through. Only issue was this particular dress seemed to be defective. The slip is sewn to back of dress where lace up ends and prevents it from laying flat. Unfortunately, I will not be able to get this dress in before the wedding so I will be sending back."
3.0,"This is not an adult watch, this is child size.  Great otherwise."
3.0,The colors are very light and difficult to read. The socks are also very thin.
3.0,"They fit the bill for my pirate costume. They are as wide as they are long though. Ok quality for costume, wouldn't buy for regular wear."
3.0,"The fit and drape of this garment ( I got it in red) is exceptional.  Sadly, it has a serious problem with pilling after just one wearing."
3.0,"This tutu it shorter than it looks in the photo. I'm 5'8&#34;, and it came just above my knees when I wore is on my hips. With the waist band at my natural waist, it was just too short. The color is also much more turquoise than the photo (which looks more royal blue). Although the photo isn't accurate then item and price did the trick!"
3.0,"It’s just me but I am not a fan, feels flimsy & uncomfortable."
3.0,Ordered the largest size hoping these would be long enough but they're a bit short.
3.0,grandma enjoyed it but it was a little hard finding the right angle to be able to see the picture inside
3.0,Well I am new to cycling and I love the class however the saddle is very painful. I ordered these shorts and they help some but the pad is very thick in the middle and I had to keep adjusting during the workout. Still gonna keep cycling though just expected a little more comfort
3.0,"These arrived in a timely manner and with all the stone on them. My only real problem is that they are too big on me....idk but they just look a little fake because of the size. I will try to get them a play and if I begin to like them more, hopefully my rating will change."
3.0,"Gorgeous color! As vibrant as the picture. Ordered an XXL because I wanted it oversized, I usually wear a L/XL but it runs small. The only issue I had was that it smelt really bad when I opened it- almost like a mildew smell. I washed it right away and the smell was gone, but it was still weird for new clothing to smell so gross."
3.0,I really want this bad I tell my boys Infiniti all the time
3.0,"I love these, but they broke. They are cute and lightweight and fun. However, the second time I wore them one of the water bottles came off and now I only have one earring. That said, I would still recommend them. Maybe just reinforce the glue before you wear them."
3.0,"wish they had an XL (got the Lg), was a little small and the pockets are position off more to the front than the side so it isn't ideal. this will still work as a lounge around dress and the material is just right for Alaska"
3.0,because they are large they slip off.
3.0,"I like the weight and thickness of this as it's not too light but isnt heavy. One of the snaps already fell off after wearing it once, and the front peices hanging looks weird, I cannot get it to sit in a flattering way. I wouldn't order again."
3.0,"The clip isn’t that strong and my keys kept falling off, I won’t be keeping it."
3.0,"My biggest disappointment with this watch is the color on the dial. The outer ring and areas around the date picker look pink or salmon. The last picture labeled fashion sport shows the color of these areas most accurately. If you can live with that, the rest of the watch is pretty cool. At this price, its hard to complain - even if you just buy this for the band, its worth the money."
3.0,"These are pretty but don't hang well on my ears, so I returned them"
3.0,"Is totally see through, it is high waist but not tummy control. The medium is a little loose, not flattering (I'm definitely not an Small). I thought in returning them but leggings are warm and I will use them under skirts and dresses. For the price I got a good set of pantyhose, so not too bad"
3.0,"The look of this dress definitely met my expectations. The length is great and the slip underneath was highly appreciated. A great summer dress. However, it was too large in the breast area. I chose not to reorder because it's really thin for the price. Maybe $20-$22 would be reasonable but nothing beyond that price range."
3.0,I chose the size per instructions. I had great difficulty getting them off! A little bit too thick.
3.0,"I really enjoy the look of the dress, it's a little big but I can just fix it a bit. But overall very good quality."
3.0,My 1 year old loves these shoes. She can put them on herself and are comfortable. The only bad part is that the black nose fell off after just a few wears. I super glued it back on but it fell off again. I was so disappointed because we lost the nose so she really can't wear them unless it's playing around outside at the house. Bummed
3.0,It’s a bit short in the front so it hits weird
3.0,A little bigger than expected and not meant for warmth at all.
3.0,These shorts are so cute! But only if you gave a 28 inch waist. I got the large and there was no way I was going to button them!<br />My size 8 daughter fit them perfectly.
3.0,"I was unimpressed with the presentation. The textured box is branded with the print not centered. It also had the sticker on the front which left a defect when I removed it. The box is a small square. The necklace was contained in two plastic baghies, one covering the attached chain, the other the pendant. It took me about ten minutes to untangle the chain, and realky life is too short. The chain looks cheap but does have a libster claw cladp, albeit a small one. The chain was supposed to be eighteen inches with a three inch extendet. Mine, extended fully is just over sixteen inches. The pendant is cute, recognizable as a turtle with a pretty blue stone. It is small. It is okay for a kid. If giving as a gift swap out the box for a traditional necklace box and make sure the chain isn't tangled."
3.0,"I ordered this expecting to have a black top and pink shorts with black lace detail, but they gave me a black top with black shorts. The top is super cute, the bottoms were a strange rough fabric, very uncomfortable against my skin. I returned it."
3.0,Wasn’t a fan of the skirt details up close but the skirt is true to size.
3.0,Great for working outside on working in my garden.Thank You.<br />Rebecca
3.0,"Definitely a lot wider than I expected, but I do have a small/skinny child. Cute overall!"
3.0,They were a bit snug.  My regular jeans are the same size and don't fit like these.  Rather than return them or sell them. Just gonna try to trim down a bit.  👍🏽
3.0,"Es fresca , pero cuando se lava extienden mucho siento que algo anda mal con eso"
3.0,"The gloves are the correct length but really wide & do not fit my 5 yo properly, but, worth the price bc they keep his hands warm"
3.0,It’s very cute but the body othe the bunny is a lot shorter then in the picture and it sheds worse then a long haired cat lol
3.0,It’s ok. Not what I expected.
3.0,"Mine didn’t come with the belt so I’m disappointed about that, it’s very wrinkled too, hopefully I will be able to iron it."
3.0,Came in great timing. it looked just like the picture. I liked that the back was a tied back so you can adjust it. But..My daughter only got to wear it one time because when she bent down to pick something up the jump suit split. The jump suit doesn't have a inseam so it would be really hard to fix. so sad because it was so cute :(
3.0,"Dorky looking style, but excellent night (and rainy overcast) vision clarity!"
3.0,Cute shoes but quite tight! I wear 8.5M consistently but these are cut very narrow and too small to feel like my true size.
3.0,"Does what it needs to do. There is only one clasp. Most bras are at least two so, you might have an issue. But mine still worked fine."
3.0,Little tight on the fit but otherwise as expected
3.0,Loose knitting will need to wear under shirt or jacket over at least in my case
3.0,Im sadly disappointed with this. It has a strange smell to the garment which I can deal with after dry cleaning. My issue is the fit. It fit tight around the legs or butt area. It is a bit short for a person that is 5' 7&#34; which makes it look borderline high water. My chest is a 34D and it fit way too big and loose. It would look good if you had bigger chest or implants otherwise will make you look oddly flat chested no matter what you do with it. Im athletic build so might be the muscle development hindering the fit in that area or I  have to lose about 1/2 inch on my butt to make it fit good and I need some implants on my chest to fill it in. I cant go bigger or smaller. Im stuck between returning it.
3.0,Shoes are very stiff.  I hope with wear they will soften up a bit.
3.0,it broke after 3 weeks!
3.0,Rings are definately midi rings but there isn't much of size difference for different fingers.
3.0,Basic shorts not as classy as picture but too lazy to send back. ok for knock around. Don’t  expect much.
3.0,"I love the style and look of these, but they are a bit small...and because of the fit issue, the lace on the front ripped as soon as I bent down ."
3.0,These are so cute. They were a bit stiff and smelled like gasoline when they arrived. They got softer and the smell went away after I washed them. They are very comfortable and fit as expected. My concern is I have just washed them a second time and they already look worn--not the design (it stayed on fine) but the actual fabric. I have washed them twice in cold water. I hope they hold up.
3.0,Pattern was not for me
3.0,"The white stones were a little too bright, so toned them down painting them with see thru black (looks like marcasite).  Love them now.<br />Size is a little on the big size (my fault for not checking) because I have short hair."
3.0,"I received these shoes super quick after my order was placed, and the shoes were in perfect new condition...my only issue was the Nike box itself was completely ruined..it had tears and was crushed on the edges...considering this is a christmas gift I was not to happy about that. My husband keeps his sneakers in their original boxes in his closet, with these he won't be able to. If it wasn't for the box I would have given them 5 stars? :/"
3.0,"Very shiny and pretty, but posts are too thick and wouldn't go in my ears. Never had that happen before."
3.0,Beautiful dress but just didn’t look good on me
3.0,"Fabric is nice, very soft. Was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. Unfortunately the reindeer melted in the dryer before he was able to wear them."
3.0,"We have ordered many ""neck gaiters"" in the past, however this one runs much smaller than any of the ones we have bought in the past. So small to the fact that my husband is not able to wear this at all."
3.0,"These shorts aren't bad, thin and comfortable material. I usually wear a 33 but there wasnt an option so i jumped to 34 expecting to have a bit of room as most 34's are pretty baggy on me. They fit on the brink of being too small. Possibly going to need to move the button 1/3 inch over for perfect fit. They do come with the belt in the pic unlike some of the other shorts you see on amazon. I was looking for some longer shorts as i am 6'3 and like my shorts below the knee. Was looking for ones so long that i could roll them once or twice. They look that long in the pic but once i put them on, they are pretty much just below my knee.<br /><br />TL;DR: They are a decent pair of cheep shorts. They run a bit small. They DO come with the belt in pic."
3.0,"I love the look of this swimsuit, however it just didn't work for my body. The solid green side has to be pulled tight to tie above the hip, and that smashes my right boob down flat, making my chest look uneven.<br /><br />The cups in the bra portion are very weak, so they add no structure to the top of the suite, nor to they help to hold your shape. This is really eye-catching as it's not a common looking swimsuit, but this just didn't flatter my body in any way, so it's off to Goodwill."
3.0,"super small fit on my head, but I am a tall big guy.  So FYI.  I will return it for sizing issues only."
3.0,"I ordered according to the measurements which showed I needed an XL. I wear a size 8 or 10 normally, so XL seemed wrong, but I followed the chart. When they arrived, I could barely get them on. They have no hip room and no stretch. The waist was giant in comparison. Promptly returned."
3.0,I returned this. The fit was okay but the slip underneath was so oddly colored that it took away from how cute the dress could be. They should make the slip the same color as the dress.
3.0,They are super cute but not oversized unless you have a tiny face.
3.0,I got it thank you. Not crazy about it
3.0,not for winter wear so that's why I returned it it's an okay suit but the price compared to the outfitt nah not for me
3.0,Pros: It's a nice quality shirt with some stretch. Cute graphic. Sort of reminds people of the tone of Simon's Cat. Cons: It's just an old school shiny vinyl decal. I wasn't expecting that. Doesn't seem like the decal will hold up to very many washes.
3.0,"A little snug. Not true to size. Will need to add 1 up from normal fit. But, i like the feel of the material and is definitely long enough to fit my 30 inseam."
3.0,He said they started out comfortable and then became uncomfortable for his feet rub blisters on his big toe shoe broke down pretty quickly he’s not a big guy about 200 pounds
3.0,Its difficult to find the kind of skorts I like. I probably order these in a larger size than I needed. They are good quality. I had them shortened at an alterations store and now they are perfect!!! A good denim skort that is good for a walk in the summer heat.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this and technically it fit okay. However, I ordered an extra large when I usually wear a large.  So I expected this to fit a little loose; instead, it is form fitting.  It doesn't look bad but it is tight enough that I don't feel comfortable wearing it to work as a teacher."
3.0,"Neat idea, but not enough breeze generated.  I am sure being better than no fan at all makes a difference, but I mostly could not tell."
3.0,"Smaller than stated, but I get tons of compliments on them."
3.0,Nothing sticks out pro or con
3.0,Got the XL like I always do. It is a bit snug around the tummy which is my worst area.
3.0,They have a great design but sizing seems off.They arrive in on time.
3.0,"It never occurred to me that there would be NO SECOND HAND! Otherwise, it's OK"
3.0,Was not fitted as a slim and is about a size to big. Needs to be fitted better
3.0,"Looks just like the picture. Not really a jacket, material is super thin. The material is pretty thin, because of that I feel like I can only get a few uses out of it. Good for causal wear, can even be worn on a hot day. I do wish it was made better."
3.0,"Didn't really like the material, it's too clingy for me but the style is nice."
3.0,Thin material. I love the design but the chest area isn't covered as much as I would like. When swimming I actually felt like I was going to pop out. I actually wore different bottoms as well because the ones the came with it was not as supportive as I would of liked too.
3.0,"I really liked the look of this dress, however... I ordered a large, I normally wear a medium & it fits as expected, but the only issue I have is the sleeves. If I raise my arms the dress hikes up super short style, definitely not appropriate for work. I cut the sleeves off & it's much better now, but I know I wouldn't of bought this dress if I would of known about the sleeve/hike up issue."
3.0,Nice skirt and it will do the job.
3.0,"Same as with what everyone writing, run very small. I am an 8.5/9, so went with the 9/10, and back of foot hanging off....if I was to order again I would have went with 11/12. However, the material is very comfty."
3.0,"This shirt is awesome. It’s 95% cotton 5% spandex (not what the listing says), but it’s super soft and stretchy and feels good. The arms are tight which I like, but have plenty of stretch if needed.<br /><br />I’m normally a medium but after looking at the model pics and seeing he was in a large, I got large and it fits great. It’s slightly loose but with my current physique I’d prefer that to a tight fit. I’m 6’0 190lbs for reference.<br /><br />I dropped in some photos so you can see the fit.<br /><br />I’ll definitely be buying some other colors if they have them.<br /><br />Almost forgot, shirt has a bit of a chemical smell upon arrival but it washed right out no problem. Also didn’t have any shrinking problems but I wash on delicate and dry low heat.<br /><br />Update:<br />Unfortunately after several washes (on delicate) the shirts have become stretched out and sloppy looking. Nearly unwearable at this point which is a shame because I loved them new!"
3.0,Way too large for an infant. I think they would be better for an older baby/toddler.
3.0,"The new purse is very nice, but also very heavy by itself with nothing in it.<br />By the time I load in phone, wallet, checkboook, etc, the purse weighs a ton.<br />I bought it because of the hobo feature; that is you can wear it around your neck<br />and have your hands free.  Works well, but still to heavy.  I guess I will have<br />to &#34;houseclean&#34; my purse to make it lighter!!"
3.0,"I felt like this suit was too short for my torso.  I'm average height and this fit as expected around, but was not long/tall enough."
3.0,"Let’s talk about my first impression of the watch.<br />I was so excited to get this watch but , when I open the box I just saw that the box was a little dirty inside like if it was used for someone else before or that someone was manipulating the watch and didn’t wash their hands .The size of the watch is a 39mm right ? I saw some reviews on YouTube before I bought this watch but it didn’t seem to be really small, turns out when I saw the watch that I bought it was so small like if it was made for women, the strap is very short and I don’t even have a big wrist but it was so difficult to but it on anyways. I like the look of the watch yes, and it’s a good watch specially because it’s a COSC trust me it’s worth it, if I would recommended? Yes! If you like small watches ."
3.0,Easy to put on it is ugly
3.0,It barely covers the front need more room
3.0,Material is very thin and not the best material but I think I could wear this skirt during summer
3.0,Good cut but material is too transparent.
3.0,"The part around the thighs is a lot looser than you'd expect, so if you want tighter shorts I don't recommend these. But overall they're comfortable and fit great"
3.0,"Ok, I might have kept this if it fit better because it was so inexpensive, but am returning. It's a thin, spandex layer that fits very small. Specifics: I am 5', 4"". I weigh 112 and have 33 and 1/2 (chest), 26 and 1/2 (waist),35 (hips). I usually wear an XS, but  fits very tight, so I'm sending it back. I had a sleeveless tank on underneath and could barely zip this jacket. The fabric is very thin, basic spandex, and there is a mesh triangle on the back between the shoulder blades. If all you need is a thin, spandex layer, this might work for you. It's not unattractive for the price. Color as shown. Do NOT buy this snug. The zipper is basic and already has a loose thread."
3.0,"Very comfortable good for lounging at home. But if you want to wear it outside, be aware that the material is thin and moderately see through."
3.0,They hold sweat OK but rip my hair out! Any exposed velcro tore my hair out.
3.0,Pretty but didn't love it. Returned. It was a good quality dress though.
3.0,Larger than I thought it would be. Almost fills up the entire palm of my hands. Quality is good
3.0,The heel area is padded nicely but my heel slip sideways  because there isn't any support to keep heel centered. So I sent it back.
3.0,color not as shown on ordering page
3.0,"Love the kimono itself, but it seems to run very small. I got an extra large which I can normally pull off and i can hardly get it around each arm across my back. Disappointing, but it is what it is."
3.0,"These fit a little smaller than I was expecting. My daughter says the fabric feels weird. The material is very thin and see through. These will be fine in the winter under a t-shirt, but she probably won’t wear them as a stand alone shirt except for bedtime."
3.0,I love the lace but the color needs a bit more pizzazz! The sleeves are a bit tight as well.  Although the dress is very beautiful and flowy I will be returning it.  I wish it came in one more size up just for a bit more room.  It looks much tighter than it actually feels...
3.0,(3.5)<br />These are decent toe/pinkie/knuckle rings. You get four of them in two different designs. The brass is in a nice sort of metallic gold finish. Closer to a rose gold than a standard gold color.<br />These are okay. They are adjustable by pulling them apart and pushing them back together. At a distance they look very nice but as you get closer they loss a lot of their luster.<br />All in all these are still pretty rings so if you like what you see here you are still getting decent rings.
3.0,They are a little tight an a little see through
3.0,Cute! But a little too small
3.0,"Steel Braid Bangle Cuff Bracelet for Snake Chain Bracelet Beads.  It looks very nice. However it fell apart in one week, it was not well made, I don’t recommend it."
3.0,"It's a pretty small container and I thought it would work perfectly but it's even too small for my thyroid pills, which I thought until now, were pretty small too.  I will just give it to charity.  I was hoping it would work for me but it won't."
3.0,"I ordered the medium, but it turned out that it was to large for me, and it looked odd on my body.  I'm 5'7"" 145lbs.  The small would probably fit better but decided to not order it because I wasn't to thrilled with the material.  Wanted something with a little more sturdier fabric.  This was a little flimsy.  I give 5 stars for the vendor's no hassle return policy."
3.0,"The dress fit fine, but it was a rather boring style.  I ordered the solid blue and returned it."
3.0,Material tore apart at bottom seam after first wash. The dye burnt the material
3.0,These are not as wide in the calf as others seem a little small
3.0,The pictures look nicer than reality.
3.0,My toe poked through in one day....
3.0,"This top looks NOTHING like what is pictured. It is definitely more form fitting. Not really flowing at all. I ordered a size up, and it's still so small I can't even button it all the way. The sleev s are too tight.<br />I'm 5'6, 234 pounds and ordered a 2x. Should've gone with a 3x. Just dissatisfied."
3.0,"I ordered a large and it fit ok, but it didn’t offer enough support. I normally get large for the girls (34G) but left like they would slip out. Had to return. A medium would have been too small."
3.0,little tight around your legs and I have thin legs....also the color is darker than shown here. Otherwise they are ok.
3.0,The thin metal piece tends to cut into my wrist when my arm is in a certain position.
3.0,Really cute but just cheap material. The first day the chain broke and I had to fix it.
3.0,Very questionable
3.0,"This was way too large for me, but it fit my mother perfectly. She has a new dress now. One of the buttons also fell off while trying it on. Beside the button and the fit (on me) it's a very nice dress."
3.0,"These earrings come off a bit easily, I've had a hoop come off once or twice when it caught on my sweater or my braids. Other than that I really like these: they are not too heavy and the diamante detail does not look cheap in real life. The picture is pretty true to life and the size is really great, I was concerned they would be a bit on the small side for my preference but they were perfect. Shipped from Turkey and arrived slightly ahead of time. But be warned that when shipping to the US it may take +/- 3 weeks to get this product via regular mail."
3.0,"Meh. I have an athletic build with muscular arms, and a torso that’s on the longer side.<br /><br />The Fabric of the dress isn’t as luscious as the pictures. It’s nice feeling, but duller than I hoped. I was expecting a tighter fit with some stretch, but it’s not that. The straps are cheap feeling, but seem to function & loon good.<br />It’s hard to say if I got a size too small or a size too large. The chest seems too high, and the back hits above the small of my back, so it’s loose and hanging out away from my skin. I think I will be able to take in the sides pretty easily so the dress lays flack on my back. but I won’t be able to extend the straps to lower the v on the chest.  it’s a decent dress, I wasn’t expecting perfection, but I was hoping for the price, the velvet would look nicer, but I wasn’t expecting it to fit perfect. Kind of feels like a decent, thick dress you might find at Walmart. Nothing special, pretty basic."
3.0,"Odd, spandex type thick material. Not going to work like I thought, for my son, in the summer/fall time for up north in Michigan. I returned this item, had to pay return shipping too.. which I didn't realize when ordering. Thought Prime always meant free returns, I learned my lesson."
3.0,Not as large as they look.
3.0,Very well made but had a terrible chemical smell. I may return.
3.0,"It seems very fragile, hopefully it will not brake in a week."
3.0,Does not hang exactly like the pic shows which is unfortunate but it’s still pretty.
3.0,Pretty dress but it’s very see through. Seems to run small
3.0,Wondering why this was made in Thailand??????<br />Kept to give as gift but with some reservation that this is REALLY a Pandora bracelet.<br />Also seems a bit thinner than the Pandora bracelets I have seen.
3.0,Too thin of a material. Bought black was fine but the blue colored one had different material.
3.0,I had ordered too from the same manufacturer and they were both way too small. They did not meet the size chart that shows up on Amazon. This XL was more like a size 12 than a 16.
3.0,I really wanted this to work. It was too thin and slightly see through in the back. Not warm at all. Also not as cute as in the picture...
3.0,"The strap popped off immediately upon putting it on for the first time. It didn't really look right on me anyway, I'm 5'9&#34; and the inner skirt was shorter than I'd like (several inches above the knee.)"
3.0,I was expecting a better quality but The touch felt really sintetic... had to return it
3.0,"The color is nice and the fit is fine, But you can quite literally read the newspaper through it (at least the adds). It would be good as a tunic over a TURTLENECK so you could cover your more private bits from public display."
3.0,The earring are nice but they are both facing the same direction not opposite as it appears in the picture. Kept them any way.
3.0,It s very small
3.0,Within a week after receiving the bracelet one of the charms came off not to long after another one came off
3.0,Much bigger and looser straps than normal.
3.0,"The purse is true to size, it's very small! The handle is not long enough to be a crossbody length.  My mother in law is 5'2"" and it's short on her, we had to alter it and add chain in the handle for it to be long enough.  Quality seems good but hasn't been used much yet."
3.0,I love the design but it just makes wrist green.
3.0,Not true to size for me AT ALL. I got it discounted though so I’m just gonna donate since it is cute.
3.0,"I wear a size 5.5-6 shoe and the heel portion of these socks were way too big. They seem like nice quality socks, but beware if you have small feet."
3.0,It's ok. Ordered 2 sizes up and it's still a little small. Material is really thin. It looks pretty good though and it made a good gift.
3.0,"Jewelry was pretty, but the chains were damaged slightly, and the keychain was broken. The sword and sheath fit together, but it doesn't lock together so it just falls out."
3.0,"Don’t get me wrong, once I got this on I really liked it. But trying to hook all 20 hooks in the back… I don’t know how many there actually are, and then twist it around to the front was almost impossible for me to do.  It wasn’t just that it was difficult to twist, but once I got the top ones done I noticed the bottom ones had come apart. It was like a fight to keep it all together. I’m going to look for something similar with a front closure and see if that helps. I really like how supportive it feels once I finally got it on. Took me 10 minutes!"
3.0,"Didnt like the material at all, it feels cheap and rough, the fit was awkward too"
3.0,So I got this dress and it actually looks great on me and fits well. The only thing wrong with it is it’s not a v neck like in the picture?? The neck line is high up?? Every other customer photo has the v neck. I’m very confused
3.0,It's quite a bit more pink than grey and the material is a bit thin so you can see through it. Not bad for wearing around the house.
3.0,I didn't like the way it hung.
3.0,"Buscaba un reloj que evocara la década de los años 70 y me llamó la atención esta reedición de Orient. Lamentablemente al verlo en persona y ponérmelo en la muñeca me siento raro y tal vez es porque el reloj no se ve de buena calidad. La maquinaria debe ser buena por tratarse de un Orient, pero los terminados no me convencieron. No es un reloj particularmente deportivo, la resistencia al agua es de solo 50 m y el cristal no es zafiro, aunque esto ya se sabía por las especificaciones. Queda como testimonio de época pero sinceramente no creo que lo use mucho."
3.0,Very cute necklace but not made with stronger material.
3.0,"I had to return it, the date window would skip gears on arrival. Probably a lemon as you’ll find in any manufactured item.<br /><br />Pros: impeccable finish, great look<br />Cons: the diameter is too big for the style of watch that it is. I usually wear a 44-46mm, so that’s saying something. I knew this before ordering, but in person it looks way bigger than it is."
3.0,Got this as a Valentines day gift for the lady. She loves it however the right side pocket is still sewn shut. There is a pocket in the inside but no way to access without tearing the fabric. She loves how these fit and they are super comfortable. Maybe check to be sure pockets are correct.
3.0,"The gold-plated bracelet I received has gold colored bars on the edges, giving it a square appearance. In the picture, the bracelet does not have these, and the stones have the round appearance that they are supposed to have. I ordered this same bracelet a while back in the white color, and it does not have bars. I wanted one just like that, but in gold. I haven't decided yet if I will keep this one, but if I do, I will still be looking for one with a round appearance.<br />When the bracelet is laid out flat, it does not lay in a nice straight line. It was the same way with my white one, but I realized that when I put it on, you can't see that ""kinkiness""."
3.0,"Love the length and pattern of this dress, but it is too small in the bust, so am returning."
3.0,"Very Tight - more so than what you would expect - that said, the quality of material is good - and if you don't have larger calves, then you are good to go."
3.0,Compression is good and they stay up well. Foot area too small they hurt my toes and they have a small hole where the heel meets the sock that showed up after the first wearing.
3.0,"Nice for costume, too small for adult. good color beard is nice plus to whole look"
3.0,"A little small, slit was pretty high on the sides. Pretty pattern."
3.0,"OK! When I see the words “tummy control and butt lift“ I expect the item to help do some of the heavy lifting.. apparently, these pants did not get the memo! Albeit, they are high waisted and do reach ones naval- this is just an extension of the regular pant material.. no special reinforcement or, band to aid tummy troubles- and with the gift of having x4 babies and that wonderful thing called gravity.. not having extra support is a fatal flaw!! Never trying pants to help hold up the “caboose” I was excited but, these too don’t have any magical powers in the rear..<br /><br />Material used is soft and made with a stretchable thickness. Ordered in pink and it’s pretty nice hue- it matches photo description. All stitching and seams are on point, no loose threads.. pants have a reinforced crotch for extra security, movement, comfort. At a $25 price point these are solid and not see thru. These have X1 zip pocket but, my favorite feature are the 2 outside pockets which hold anything from ones chapstick to car keys or, cell phone.. The pockets also help transition these pants into carpool and errand running attire- again, total bonus!<br /><br />As for the fit: I found these run small… If between sizes, I suggest sizing up! They are a skinnier fit through hip and waist area- But note: the length is a bit shorter so, if you struggle to find yoga pants for shorter height- these meet that criteria! For reference: 5’2”, 140lb, 36C, natural waist 28.3- ordered in Medium.. A large would have offered for more comfort, wiggle room and been a bit more forgiving. If, one has zero room to spare in the fit.. I would recommend washing on cold and line drying! Doing so will avoid shrinkage yet, it still allows pants to regain their shape.<br /><br />Overall, these yoga pants have ability to perform well- Just be sure to realize the details prior to ordering.. Make certain, these will be a right fit for you and you don’t need the extra support it claims to have, I didn’t notice any! I hope this info can help your decision.. feel free to let me know!"
3.0,"The braid becomes jumbled easily, but otherwise very cute."
3.0,Good look. Wears fairly quickly for everyday use easy to catch with your shirt or in the shower
3.0,"The dress fits well and is comfortable when you first put it on, but it stretches out terribly as the day goes on. It went from flatteringly fitted to very loose, sinking down below my knees and getting lumpy around my waist from the excess material."
3.0,I’m only giving it a 3 BECAUSE I ordered a white/pearl band and got black. The only reason I didn’t return it was bc I sold it to my sister for her Apple Watch because she liked it. I’m going to rebuy so hopefully I get the white/pearl one that I ordered originally so fingers crossed! Annoying though because the box clearly said black and they stuck a white sticker on it which obviously didn’t help at all.
3.0,Cute very shiny but tangles easily
3.0,"Very cute design, but the large fits like a s/m. SUPER tight for a large, skin tight and they do not offer an extra large."
3.0,"Took forever and their should be 2 honor chords but it's only one set.  Nice quality, just took forever"
3.0,"Good cheap suitcase belt. Good thing it wasn't too expensive, as the plastic buckles break fairly easily with luggage handlers.  Took several trips with these on, and two of the straps broke during the second and third trips.  Fortunately there are four so the set (as a whole) lasts more than one flight, but it seems to me that the plastic buckles/fasteners need to be a bit more durable."
3.0,The dress was pretty but the color was way off!! Supposed to be pink but definitely peach 🍑
3.0,While the quality is good this item runs on the small side.
3.0,"Not really a slim fit, and the image illustrates it to be more of a modern fit that tappers from the shoulders down, but there are no sewn in shoulders. That being said, I am still happy with this purchase it looks decent, but I feel like it lacks value. At $30 you can find some name brand Cardigans in stores that may have a more refined look, at $20 this would be a great buy.<br /><br />It's light weight, and becomes more comfortable after a wash, retains size (line dry) and is an attractive casual wear cardigan. I really like the pockets because they are functional kind of feel like that of a hoodie. The only thing is the top corner pulls from the inside to show a small dimple, but that's really not picking."
3.0,"I guess I didn't read what it was made out of...it just felt kind of tissue papery and not as relaxed as I thought it might be. Not terrible, but not what I was looking for."
3.0,"These are very small, about the size of a pencil eraser, won't be able to wear."
3.0,The hat is fine but the heat transfer logo is small and cheap looking. Not the greatest hat I ever bought.
3.0,Fits too tight around the upper arms. Little uncomfortable. Love the style. I usually buy a size 12/14. Brought this 3x
3.0,Not for tall women 5 8&#34; or taller
3.0,THESE WERE NICE AND AS ORDERED BUT WE FOUND A PAIR<br />THAT ACTUALLY CLIPS UNDER HIS BELT WHICH WORKED A LOT<br />BETTER THAN THE ONES WITH CLIPS. I WILL BE RETURNING THESE<br />FOR A REFUND.
3.0,"Battery died within a week. It's a nice watch, but I'm disappointed that I had to pay for a new battery so soon after purchase."
3.0,"The shirt it self is fine ... the problem, as with most everything coming from China, is the size difference. A men’s XL in the United States is a men’s small there"
3.0,The earrings I received was beautiful I bought them as a gift for my sister. But the post on the one earring was bent can not seem to straighten it out
3.0,"I always wear a 4...rarely a 6. I bought the small (4/6) and it was quite tight. I laid it out over a size 2 dress that I have, and the size 2 was at least two inches wider. The dress has some stretch - but not enough to make it look anything but unflattering. Decent material and decent dress for the price, but I will be returning this particular size."
3.0,Although it's long enough I'm swimming in it.
3.0,The small fit my 7 year old that is 50lbs and wears a size 7 slim 😂
3.0,Low rise but they run small
3.0,The wallet is so small it's not a normal size
3.0,super wrinkled when it arrive . Not the quality I was hoping for.
3.0,Really nice pants that would only fit my anorexic 12 year old niece!
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed in the ring. I don't mind inexpensive jewelry but I don't want it to LOOK inexpensive. I thought the 'emerald' was a bit smaller.  I received something that was large - close to cartoonish in size.<br /><br />If this ring is re-designed, I would highly recommend making the center stone smaller."
3.0,"if you have a chest at all larger than the model, this will look horrible on you"
3.0,Too puffy
3.0,The shirt is wide and short.
3.0,Super cute in the picture but when it arrived it didn't look anything like the picture. Was not flattering on. Great return process though!
3.0,"These are very pretty and a knock out in their price point. However, I have tried to put them in several times...making my ears too sore to continue. There is a bend in the insertion rod making them impossible to put in. Gonna try again tomorrow because they are really pretty. Smaller than expected which is a good thing..."
3.0,Will have to restitch seams...
3.0,"Two of them arrived broken,  but all in all they're cheap but cute."
3.0,"It wasn't very clear to me from the pictures and the reviews, but these pants are thick and warm.  They do have a nice modern look, but I was looking for pants I could wear during summer temperatures.  Had to return them."
3.0,"Not sure what the complaints about the looks are all about.  Some claim the picture looks doctored, and their watch doesn't look as pretty.  I wonder if they got a different watch than me?  Mine looks exactly like the picture.  I've had it for several years now.  I get comments on it almost every time I wear it.  I don't wear it everyday, so it obviously needs to be wound and set each time I do, but it does keep good time when I do wear it.  Still looks as good as the day I bought it.  4 stars  because I don't like the band - No matter how I set it, it is either too tight, or too loose!  I may invest in a nicer band someday...<br /><br />***update*** 08.24.2021 - There appears to be a clearcoat applied over the gold plating that has begun to frost and flake off.  Looks pretty ugly.  It was a beautiful watch that got many compliments while it still looked good.  4 stars to 3.  3 stars still seems fair, as for the price I got a solid 5 yrs out of it...."
3.0,It's made in China. So inferior quality. However for the price point~ fairly cute suit. The top runs small. I ordered a large. I'm a 36D.  The top is more suited to a 36C bust.
3.0,"My daughter likes these tank styles because the straps are more comfortable than camisole types, but this just fit weird.  She is a little long in the torso, so I ordered the large, and it fit length-wise, but it had all this extra material above the butt (like an ill-fitting one-piece swimsuit).  I was able to get a similar-style from a store nearby in a different brand that fit well all over."
3.0,"The clips holding the strap broke less than a month after we got the glasses. Otherwise, the frames are holding up well so far."
3.0,"Runs big , I had to return it and get a smaller size . Very well made and the smaller size fit perfect .I wasn't happy about how much I had to pay to send the first one back , so thankfully the second one was perfect ."
3.0,Cute idea but doesn’t look that good on white socks.
3.0,"Good ring, buth the sizes run a little small. Will order the next size up. Otherwise good solid ring."
3.0,Very nice and wash will. Forgot and did regular wash and and came out just fine
3.0,"It is comfortable, but not of excellent quality. Good for around the house though"
3.0,It is slightly flowy kind of top and reaches below the hip. The style is slightly curved in the front which might not appeal for some.
3.0,"Some came broken, so it's not a full 40. I really am disappointed. I wish it was two sided as well.<br />Other than that I like the ones that are complete, and I'll be using them for earrings and jewelry."
3.0,I can't fit them in my nose but I wish I could I love them!
3.0,"Very cute, but extremely difficult to put on! I wish the return window didn’t close."
3.0,a lot smaller than it looked in the picture.
3.0,"It works but it takes some serious hand strength to get it thru the leather. I think maybe the cutters need to be sharper. Tried to put a new hole in my husbands belt, so it was a normal punch job. I couldn't get it thru and took my husband several tries to finally get it done. The metal held up well to all the pressure, but it shouldn't be so hard to get it to punch. I have used other in the past (and couldn't find one) none of them were this hard. So my husband file sharpened the cutters and the next hole went much better."
3.0,"Sizes are not accurate. If you want it free flowing like the pic, you'll have to go up AT LEAST 2 sizes. I'm 5'7"" about 150lbs and athletic build...it fit like an under shirt"
3.0,"I knew these would be super small-I don’t mind that at all, but not being able to secure them is not a good thing.  Waste of money.  Bummed out a bit."
3.0,Not a good fit for me but it is a beautiful dress
3.0,"The first pair were fine. They are nice and lightweight. However, when I wore the second pair the elastic snaped on one foot. Not happy."
3.0,"I love these necklaces, however, in the picture it shows that the handcuffs and pistol are roughly the same size when they are much different. The pistol is about half of the handcuffs and the handcuffs lay very low compared to the pistol. Over all the necklace is what I expected other than the size"
3.0,"I returned this because it was much smaller than expected.  The color was beautiful and universal, because the size wasn't what I was hoping for at all."
3.0,"I bought these bands for my Garmin Descent Mk1. The bands fit perfectly and I really like the colors and comfort.  As soon as I saw the plastic connectors I was concerned about how secure they would hold the computer during a dive. For this reason I have always made sure to dive with the original band with the stainless steel connectors. On a recent dive trip I decided, against my better judgement, to try diving with this band. As I was removing my BCD after a dive the shoulder strap must have caught on the computer. The connector broke loose and my computer headed for the bottom of the ocean. Luckily the boat dive master caught a glimpse of the sun flashing off the crystal.  He went after it and actually found my computer laying on the bottom at 61 ft. Yes he got a great tip that day! I will still wear these bands for everyday use to add a little color. But I will never dive with them again."
3.0,charms turned colors short after getting it and I even avoided getting them wet.
3.0,Its and ok dress nothing special
3.0,Not cut and hemmed properly. Very crooked.
3.0,It’s very cute but runs small
3.0,Based on Amazon's recommendations I got a large and its big and loose and ugly. I could have went with a medium maybe even a small
3.0,Nice shirt....but returned because it was too big
3.0,Runs small and material is very thin you can kind of see through it!
3.0,"Beautiful craftsmanship, but small and more suitable for a child.."
3.0,Once I got the right size good
3.0,"The clear, brown and two tone pairs of glasses are great. The black pair arrived broken. I’d like a new pair mailed to me asap. These are the ones I planned to wear the most actually. Appreciate your help and prompt response."
3.0,good color but tinny.
3.0,Unfortunately all the dinos are not right side up. Oops!
3.0,Purchased these for my daughter and she loved them. The price was fair but they were really big and had to be wrapped a lot of times.
3.0,"I thought I would be buying a NEW purse. Well I pulled this device out of it and a couple of alcohol swabs and there were stains on the inside. Definitely was not expecting that, considering it was supposed to be new."
3.0,"I am 5'3"" and pretty much a solid size 12 in pants, and a wee bit small up top (36 C with some help LOL). This dress fit well around my waist, and hips, and the length hit about mid-calf. The neckline was a little too low cut and the bust was too roomy for my liking. It felt like you could see straight down my dress even with the slightest bending. That's the fit of the dress.....now the material. It's a very strange ""cotton 97% spandex 3%"" combination. It was such a thick and stiff fabric that it was not flattering in any way. When I would lift my arms and put them down the dress bunched in the armpits and I had to adjust the waist and bust of the dress. I ordered the color Army Green and I loved it, but the material felt more like an army canvas than a cotton/spandex mix. Sad day for me."
3.0,"Looks beautiful, but the stone fell out after a couple of months of wearing it"
3.0,The jelly straps were really tight.
3.0,"Fit is okay but the quality is not really as good.  When the package came there were about 7 lose stones.The color I was expecting, like the sapphire like color is missing, instead  they put in an extra purple color."
3.0,classic design but the wire temples are insubstantial...  polycarbonate lenses are lightweight/comfortable.
3.0,"It did the job for my wedding, after I had it altered to fit me. It wasn't quite as puffy as I was expecting"
3.0,"I was really excited to see this since the picture looked so comfy. Reality is I should have sized up, so it would look loose like the picture. I got my size and it just fits awkward. It is a little tighter than I wanted which doesn't help the look of it at all. I'm glad I did buy it in black and it looks ok. I put it in the washer and dryer and it did great, so there's that."
3.0,Not in any way fitted or close.  Correct size but style is as oversized
3.0,"I'm giving it three stars because it serves a purpose, but not the intended purpose.  I ordered this chin strap and the &#34;Sleep Aid Mouth Guard Natural Solution OTC Device - Anti Teeth Grinding Nightguard - Custom Mold.&#34;  I realized that my snoring is caused by my jaw relaxing and cutting off my airway.  Ideally, at least for me, my teeth need to be directly on top of each other, or better yet, the lower teeth in front of the uppers.  The mouth guard, which is moldable by putting it in boiling water, allows you to put the teeth in this position and I use the strap to make sure my jaw doesn't slacken and the mouth guard fall out.  The combo worked immediately.  The next morning after trying this out my wife said I did not snore at all.  Now, I don't know how the strap by itself could help with snoring because it seems to hold my jaw in the very position that constricts my airway.  If you don't want to get the chin strap get the mouth guard, it works.  BTW, my chin strap does not have the smell many reviewers complain of."
3.0,"They’re not terrible, one thing I did notice is all of mine pairs had little rubber tabs from where the mold is set. Definitely quality silicone, and I do like them. For the mold tabs I just used a straight edge to trim them off and it seems fine. I guess it’s what you should expect for a cheap set of 3 silicone tunnels. Especially since Ant walk in store you go to sells them for about $20 for a single pair. Can’t complain to much, I do like them. But the mold tabs kinda bothered me and that’s why I had to give it 3 stars.. Still not a bad purchase by any means."
3.0,"These look awesome and washed really well. But they are very tight. The fabric is stretchy but when I tried to stretch them, the single row of seams ripped. I had to resew them myself. Wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't have a really small face. These will not be comfortable."
3.0,These run big. I am 5’6 and 133lbs and the small is very loose but overall these are soft and comfortable and they look very cute. If the sizing wasn’t a bit off I would love these and given it 5 stars
3.0,The rings for great but the purple is nowhere near the color shown here it is very bringer purple. Not the muted purple I see in the picture.
3.0,"I got the shoeslocker Toddler Boys Girls Loafers for my three year old son.  In real life they look just like the pictures.  However, I do not know about the fit as they are so hard/stiff I would not even put them on my son.  Some shoes need to be worn a few times and they loosen up, but I could tell that these would not.  The soles are dense and remind me of a word my mother used to use ""clod hopper.""  The shoes was especially stiff around the opening, and I could imagine it would dig into the back of my son's leg.  I wish the material was softer and had lighter soles."
3.0,"Love the colors! Super disappointed, though, when one of the earrings was missing the hardware. That's a little frustrating, even for the cost of the earrings."
3.0,Does not have nonslip plastic so wouldn't stay on my giant melon of a head :( but nice quality!
3.0,Im 5'7 and it barely hit my ankle. Would look better on a short woman. I prefer long maxi dresses. Looks like the pic tho
3.0,"Nice hat, easy to put on and give a lot of coverage from the sun."
3.0,"Great idea, but not too great organizing bags. Bags look good like in picture only if they have same size handles. One of the clasp broke using a medium size Michael Kors' satchel. I ended up using it to store other items and some small bags."
3.0,The colors are different.
3.0,Nicely made but too small for my wife. Returned.
3.0,"This dress is super comfortable and cute.  The only thing I wish is that it was a little bit longer, I am 5'7"" and it hangs above the ankle."
3.0,I like the goggles but one of the the notepads fell off after about a week. I have not looked for a replacement yet.
3.0,De demasiado pequeño
3.0,"The wig isn't very thick, and the hair is very fine, so it gets messy very quickly. Also, it looks slightly gray, rather than white. Ok for the price."
3.0,"I do like it but, I don't know if I have any positive progress"
3.0,"these keychains are super cute but they are very poor quality. I do not even know what kind of ""metal"" it is made of, honestly, the charm might just be made of hard plastic. But I still like the look of it, but I am scared that it will get destroyed easily"
3.0,"This sweater is pretty comfortable but took a really long time in shipping. When I got it, it was the wrong color and slightly smaller than I was hoping. I just needed a sweater and this one did the job but I wish I got the right color."
3.0,not what i thought but very nice suit
3.0,"This head wrap is soft, comfortable and easy to put on. Only concern is that the pictures show the strands in the back as long and the wrap with some slouching. The product itself has short strands and does not slouch."
3.0,The material was way too thin.  Why have I not received my refund yet? I mailed the item back weeks ago
3.0,ordered this for a necklace I made for a friend. One of the chain links connected to the clasp was open a bit but I was able to close it back up with pliers. Shipping is way too much for what it is. I send out pendants that way a whole lot more than this for 1.80
3.0,Got mostly Pink and Blue  would have rather had the variety shown.
3.0,It broke shortly after it arrived.
3.0,I ordered this in a 2x since that's the size top I wear. This was way too big and didn't look right at all. I'd definitely size down next time. I ended up sending this back.
3.0,To small to see on bracelet
3.0,"Purchased the black & rust colored Maribel. Shirt looked just like the listing. I was excited until I saw the size. The XS would likely fit a 9/10 year old. I was hoping an XS for fit a younger child. The collar is wide which implies a girl fit, not unisex as stated in several areas of the listing. Pretty shirt but had to return."
3.0,Looks just like picture. I like it .
3.0,Good price and quality. Pants too long but that's ok. Just wearing them to bed.
3.0,"my wife likes the dress, and i think looks cute in it.  She says it fits well."
3.0,This is size for small girl 1-3 grade.  S is  too small M is small. I think L gonna be somewhat small.
3.0,They sizes run small
3.0,The bow tie and suspenders are 2 didn't reds. Suspenders are nice bow tie looks really cheap. Don't wear with a suit use as advertised for a casual wear
3.0,the dress is beautiful but doesn't fit right on the top.  Way too large. and the cut is too short.
3.0,These are okay if your just having a lazy day laying on the couch but will not hold up (literally) for any kind of work out. These are definitely not control top. The waist and hips are loose although fit through the legs/thighs like they should. Much activity and you will spend the majority of your workout tugging on the waist to keep them up.
3.0,"These bonnets are very pretty and soft. However, they are a little tight around the head possibly restricting blood flow in the veins of the head.  I am not a doctor.....this is just how it makes my head feel."
3.0,I am looking for the fit just like on the picture but I was disappointed that it ended up being too big for me... quality is not that bad though. It is more about the fit. It might fit well for curvier women.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this shoe. Exactly the style I was looking for however I ordered them in a size 9 and 8.5 . neither worked for me. The style is just too roomy they slipped all over my foot when walking. Heel height was nice and I think they would have been great if they were a slimmer fit. If you have a wider foot these might work for you. They were a great quality, looked a lot nicer than a $30 shoe."
3.0,"The purse is smaller than expected yet absolutely perfect for a summer festival.  It's compact size doesnt take awaybfrom your outfit, yhe phone is readily accessible while your money is aafely tucked away with a zipper.  The zipper is easy to open but not so easy that a pickpocket could open it without your noticing it.<br /><br />Im not sure if the purse is actually contains RFID blocking materials.  I put my car's key fob in the purse, zipped the purse all the way, and I was still able to open the car door.  Not sure if credit card technology is the same as key fob technology but it gave me a reason to pause."
3.0,No choice in hemline.  Either let 'em bunch at your feet or don't wear 'em.  Dumb design.
3.0,Fabric color changes over curves and needs shapewear. Fabric is this
3.0,These are cute and did the job for grinch hands. I agree they could go a little higher past the wrist and mine got a hole in the seam after the first wear is why I gave them 3 stars.
3.0,"Beautiful, but much bigger than shown in photo.  Not sure if I will wear it."
3.0,The chain right by the clasp broke after a while but it was quite pretty. But for the price it was very nice. Got lots of compliments. YOu get what you pay for.
3.0,My daugher loved it but these shinny stones on it start falling and losing within 10 days. Should have been better installed and bonded. I don't know whether I should call for a replacement.
3.0,Seems like a decent watch band. Packaging is very cheap
3.0,"loved this bag, but unfortunately I guess I over stuffed it. Handle clasp broke within a month of purchase."
3.0,"For the price, this was a bad investment"
3.0,They had an odor and kinda itchy at the wire end.
3.0,I got a extra large and it still was tight
3.0,"This shoe looks pretty on my feet,but it's not very comfortable for walking long or all day wear. Let's just say that this is not a shoe that you can use for walking around Vegas. It's ok for going down to eat or to casino, but wouldn't be great if you are on it the whole day. The support that came with it made the 9 size shoe very tight, so I had to take it off. I will use it with socks in the winter to give it cushion."
3.0,"It was very pretty, shipped perfect. As I wore it I wasn't thrilled with the shape felt I was spilling over the top and adjusting too much didn't feel like a minimizer"
3.0,Said it ran small so I ordered a size larger and was still too tight.  Need to order 2-3 sizes up.
3.0,This is more of a plastic like material than I was expecting. I ordered a size up and it did fit okay
3.0,"Flimsy, thin material, returned item next day.  Runs large."
3.0,"I really liked this necklace, but the metal is incredibly soft. I babied it and only wore it a few hours at a time, but it still snapped in the middle. Fortunately, I can solder it back together, but definitely be careful when you wear it."
3.0,Material is really clingy and the dress comes..<br />Somewhat larger than expected...but thats for me personally...
3.0,Light weight plastic material. Fashionable but not super high quality. I love the style though.
3.0,nice but it's not like you see in picture
3.0,Very disappointed- looks nice on the picture with a very nice description… they are made disproportionately small.
3.0,Didn't fit flatter my body type
3.0,Wrong description of the item.  Customer service was pathetic.  Never recvd a call from them.  Returning the item.
3.0,"Not a bad watch. Directions are confusing and the LED part of the watch is hard to see.  It has a poor wristband, which can easily be changed. It does have a solid feel to it and is definitely has a different look. For the price, a decent watch."
3.0,"They are nice but I don't like the material it  don't have enough spendex for comfer to much cotton, but everything else was ok"
3.0,the color is not as shown - more pink than burgendy. Fit is ok - a little loose on top but I like the little longer length
3.0,"Beautiful color but the frames are not wide enough for an adult; would work great for a child, teen or small adult."
3.0,"Though listed as “Adult” size, this mask runs small, barely covering from the chin to the upper bridge of the nose, and does not fit snugly across the bridge of the nose. Like so many other masks that I have tried, the poor fit around the nose results in fogged lenses if you wear spectacles or sunglasses, and puffs of air in your eyes if you don’t. The replaceable filters are a good concept, though without an N95 certification the advertised COVID-19 protection can’t be taken seriously."
3.0,Cute but a bit in the brassy side. Looks kind of cheap.
3.0,"Like that they stretch! Have too many leggings that use too much compression and aren't comfortable. These could use a longer compression band for the tummy but otherwise great.<br /><br />Dislike that they show sweat, especially is the crotch area.  No one wants to look like they I peed their pants."
3.0,"fabric is REALLY thin. I am 6 ft - these were like capris on me. When I told the mfg this, they sent me a link to the capri style. oops. sent back."
3.0,Material isn’t super thing and it’s stretchy. Not bad for the price but not a high fashion piece either
3.0,Somewhat small in the way that it is right fitting and I am a 5'4&#34; 130lb woman and it made me feel a little uncomfortable with how tight it gripped my body.<br /><br />Cheap fabric too. Has not ripped but it's clear it's cheap fabric.
3.0,"Good item, but size is too small"
3.0,Took a little longer than expected but nice.
3.0,Really cute but the sequins fell off as I took it out of the bag.
3.0,Made for tiny hands! I got a large and they're still very snug and my hands are pretty small
3.0,"I purchased this for my toddler, it's too big."
3.0,"I love this suit, but it has ZERO support for the girls. Very revealing. Probably should size up!<br /><br />It is a quality item, it’s well made and will last more than one season easily."
3.0,Runs very small but can make it work except it's super short imthe material is great but it's so short so kind of makes it hard to lift up your arms or anything
3.0,"They feel good and look good although They’re a little long in legs. My issue is air drying. They wash well, but not supposed to tumble dry.<br />After couple washings, I threw in dryer and they come out fine."
3.0,La talla no vino bien
3.0,Cute suit just too short in the torso for me. I am 5’7” and it just didn’t cover the top as much as I would expect.
3.0,very chunky piece
3.0,My husband wore this shirt in our family pictures. It fit as expected but he said it felt like plastic and did not breath at all.
3.0,"I'm not quite sure why MultiCam is so expensive right now but maybe just because it's new. This product's price is a little high and the shipping took almost two months so 3 out of 5 stars. Also, these make a noise when you walk, like corduroy pants. Not tactical at all."
3.0,Looking at picture I thought it was a faux leather look; but it looks more like black snakeskin.&
3.0,"shirt material kind of rough & the printed portion was stuck together at first... I was worried it would be ruined &/or fall apart after first wash.  So far it has held up; but the material quality is poor.  That being said, the price wasn't much either."
3.0,"I like the weight of these I plan to wear them in the house during the winter, but they are a little tight for my head 23.25"", I think they will stretch and be more comfortable."
3.0,This sock did not fit snug enough in the toe area.
3.0,Way too big for the average wrist size
3.0,"I was looking for this skirt to cover my chamois-biking shorts or pants.  I don't like pulling a skirt up when I am outside a shop or in a parking lot, I think is looks weird and have been looking for a wrap. This skirt is a simple design and fits fine but the light blue patterned color is definitely more for the beach than the shops. I am going to try the denim looking one.  I don't care for the big brand name at the front bottom of the skirt, I feel like it is an advertisement, if I like the &#34;denim&#34; one I am going to see if I can in-stich it.  Thanks for the free returns, I wouldn't have purchased it otherwise."
3.0,Stones  were falling.
3.0,"The dress is gorgeous, great quality, rich color and long (Im 5’8)<br />Im a triple D cup and this did not flatter my shoulder/ chest area."
3.0,Small sizing according to chart.
3.0,"I have 4 other dresses from this company, and medium fits great in all of them. But this dress was CRAZY tight. I could zip it, but I had major uniboob and moving around too much could have been dangerous. I'll be returning it, and hopefully exchanging it for a size up. The ballerinas are adorable."
3.0,To small and sleeves were not what I exspected
3.0,It's a belt.  It works.  Only gripe is the finish on the Cobra clip wears off easily.
3.0,"Great looking sunglasses, and materials seemed very durable until one of the screws spontaneously fell out never to be found again. Didn’t even last a month  Screwed by unscrewed."
3.0,"The interior is fail, I suspect it will crack and tear easily but its for work so it will serve its purpose."
3.0,"Cute, but small."
3.0,I really like these pants for my husband but he is average size and the pants are just the right fit now and will most likely shrink even if we hang them to dry. I am hoping for the best cuz I would get him more in other colors but I am thinking we are in for short pants after even a careful wash.
3.0,Watch looks fine but bracelet is very large so you have to take it somewhere and pay to have it made usable.
3.0,"The socks looks and fit nice, but not warm for skiing."
3.0,These earrings are pretty but too small for me! The product did have a picture of the size of the earrings but I didn't realize they were so small! The seller was wonderful to work with and refunded me after I sent the product back! I love that they give you a map of where the turquoise came from and a extra package of free backings to the earrings.
3.0,These sandals are extremely comfortable.
3.0,It's too small so if you can order a size or two up. I ordered one size up and still didn't fit comfortabley. I don't like the top. There's no front or back and fits very awkwardly and is a little short. The skirt is nice. I like the blue. If you order this you'd probably want to buy some dance shorts as well because the slit comes really high up. For the price it's a decent outfit if you're not looking to spend an arm and a leg.
3.0,"It was good quality, but was too big, and didn't seem to offer much in the line of support.  I may just have needed a smaller size."
3.0,Material too thin back bottom can off looks vether n the pic
3.0,"I wanted to give 4 stars, at least,but the issue with the bust would not let me.  This corset is flexible to accomodate your waist and hips; but if you have a small bust, there is no way to adjust the fit.  I am going to do my best to pin it, and hope it looks good. I have a 38” waist and wear a 36b bra.  I bought a 4xl (per the chart). The bust should be made to adjust for people with a smaller waist and bust not just made for larger bust and adjust for smaller waist."
3.0,"Big in some places, but is high on the waist and VERY tight there.  Oddly cut but at least pretty."
3.0,"It’s cute and stretchy, but not loose and puffy. I’m 5’1” and curvy. I ordered a small. It’s a bit short and fits like a regular sweater dress."
3.0,"It looks like it is bedazzeled, and it's actually not.  Disappointing."
3.0,"Did not fit well, returned."
3.0,I think these are worth the money. But my major complaint is that the waistband twist and you can't get it to go back into place. So when I wear them I feel very awkward. They are very uneven.
3.0,A little fake feeling but pretty on.
3.0,I guess you get what you pay.
3.0,"It fit very well. Got compliments all night... BUT!!! I actually traveled to the event with an extra dress because from the moment I put it on, the &#34;adhesive&#34; that holds the zipper started to give. I'm a size 12 and wore the xlarge. The XXL was way too baggy and in the waist and breast area, which was shocking considering my chest size is 34H!!! So although I do love the dress, be prepared to sew the zipper in place."
3.0,This dress was very tight in every area.
3.0,The materials are pretty legit and good except that the top screen protector does not fit the watch.
3.0,"Was pleased, but my son wore them three times and broke them on the third"
3.0,"sleeves fit fine, other pieces are big."
3.0,"The costume arrived with a rip in the skirt, I had to sew.  I had no time to return it because it was three days before Halloween.  Cheap material, but I made it work."
3.0,Quality is good. But the picture shows a pair which is a bit misleading.
3.0,Lost their shape after washing. Color faded quickly.
3.0,"The shirt runs short, do not buy if you have a long torso. The sleeve hooks are too big and you can't roll the sleeves up like the picture shows. Material is very see through. Back is very cute and for that reason only it gets three stars."
3.0,"I ordered the black and white tank of this style a few weeks before and got exactly what is pictured and it was so cute so I decided to order this top in black. This time around I got a completely different top from what is shown. Although the other top I got was really cute and probably better quality and material, it was a little too riskay and would probably never find an occasion to wear it so I had to return."
3.0,"It is cute, but I would have preferred a cotton blend fabric instead of the silky which would be better for pjs."
3.0,"The ring itself is very thick all the way around, would be nicer to have been a bit thinner on the bottom.  The skull head is very nice. Thickness was a little too much for me."
3.0,"Beautiful band, wanted it to fit but unfortunately the pins do not reach the holes. It is dur to the design of the band end being square and the watch beveled. Very close just not enough."
3.0,"Pretty, but too small."
3.0,Fits very snug but it's still a cute shirt!
3.0,"Much larger than expected, heavy and warm"
3.0,"Case is great if not a little bulkier than I like. The band leaves a lot to be desired, sadly. It is an annoyance to get on our off due to its rubbery nature. It stick to your skin and arm hair. It doesn’t want to clasp easy either."
3.0,I bought these and when they came they were not the same color. The picture showed them as neon purple but they aren't. However they are very durable and will not break easily. They took hard beating but did not break. Still if you really want neon purple glasses I would not suggest these glasses to you.
3.0,Description says “side zip” but I received a pair with a back zip.
3.0,Nice skirts- just maybe a size or 2 too small. Order a larger size. I'll return and try a larger size.
3.0,"Not quite the quality I was hoping for, but it will do."
3.0,It’s a nice purse and a good leather imitation  but it’s definitely not genuine leather.
3.0,"If you want an XL, but 2XL sized 1 size to small"
3.0,"Ok not very well made, but ok"
3.0,RUns small
3.0,"This outfit is super cute, absolutely adorable but the material is not the best quality. The cotton is thin, the leg snaps are spaced too far apart, and the detail is printed on that iron on transfer type material, feels kind of like plastic, so baby gets hot quick. It's also a little on the large side, I ordered a 70 as suggested on the description for 0-6 months.I had to roll both the sleeves and legs for my 3.5 month old, 63 cm baby. I'd say it would only really fit a 70 cm, 6 month old, definitely not a newborn."
3.0,"looks better online, still cute just not what i thought. Arms are super long on me. I'm short and the length seemed short (i ordered a size up for an over sized look)  couldn't wear with leggings like i hoped for. ..just not what expected."
3.0,"I like this shirt but it's to big in the back. I bought a Medium. I wore a belt to correct the problem, but would of like the shirt to fit the way it's suppose to"
3.0,It’s pretty sturdy but much bigger and bulkier seeming than it seems in the picture.
3.0,Overall design is okay. Works as it should. The problem is on the elastic band for the hood. When I apply it on my head like a helmet the hood will be pulled down and cover half the eyesight. It could have been a bonus.
3.0,The quality is so so... you can get better one at cheap store for the same price
3.0,"The sleeves were shorter than usual.  I have a few Northface hoodies, so I know what size I wear.  This seemed smaller.  It was very soft and warm though."
3.0,"meh. nothing special, sewn securely, but not a great garment."
3.0,I really like this bag instead of always caring a big diaper bag. Very cute with pockets easy access for a mom on the go like myself.
3.0,"Reviewed by Erin. Top was huge and covered way more than I want to cover, no cleavage what-so-ever, which is fine, if you want that much modesty. If you have a tummy, which I do, this suit makes you look even bigger in the middle. I'm sending it back, I gave 3 stars because it is a cute pattern and suit, if you want to be super modest."
3.0,"It’s cute, but it’s highlighter pink, not the deeper pink that was pictured. We ordered it for a costume and this color just won’t work for our needs."
3.0,LOST IT CAME OUT OF EAR
3.0,"The metal Flex Band is really pretty. Has only minor scratches after one month wear of sleeping and showering. The adjustment tool to remove links bent during install. Other than that, I love the bracelet"
3.0,Didn’t love the (red) color in person
3.0,"Not the shape I was expecting, the material of the front vs the sides and back is thicker and higher and makes it look kinda in between a trucker hat and a regular baseball cap... I was expecting a regularly shaped cap, I don't like that when I wear it my head seems larger because it is just too large at the top.  Apart from that, beautiful colors and pristine white."
3.0,PANTS HAVE TWO SHALLOW FRONT POCKETS AND ONE BACK POCKET ON THE RIGHT BACK SIDE.  BOTH PAIR- THE POCKETS ARE SEWN SHUT.
3.0,I like the length and the skirt just a lil disappointed by the color looks old
3.0,"I used the sizing chart on the web page. My palm measures 3 and 7/8 inches across the palm. The sizing chart showed that to be the XL size. The cuff of the glove tore as I was pulling on the first glove. I didn't force the glove, they are simply very thin and very undersized. I usually use 8 to 10 mil XL nitrile gloves which fit fine but am having a hard time finding them these days. I knew these were not heavy duty gloves, but I don't think they are even 4 mil."
3.0,Was not please with this item.  I appreciate that is a slim fit but it was beyond slim fit.  Perhaps the size chart needs to be updated.
3.0,"Pay attention, unlike me. It is 2.5 inches in depth.  Way too small for a backpack for any kid over 2nd grade. Fabric is ikay. They color is nice, but the Nike writing was barely visible. The his is more along the lines of a $25 backpack.  Sent it back for the above reasons."
3.0,2 see through<br /><br />I wish they were a little heavier and a bit larger.
3.0,This umbrella is not what I would call tan in color. It definitely has peach undertones. Seems pretty sturdy and is large enough to cover my patio table. Decided to keep it since the price was right.
3.0,"Size down. I usually wear a small or medium but the small is huge on me, and long.  The sky blue is not see through on the bright side."
3.0,Pants are tall girl friendly. I’m 5’7 with a 30” inseam and they touch the ground. The only issue is the jacket runs a little small. Overall it’s a good buy.
3.0,The fit was good. But I recieved my package and it looked like it was already used. The straps that go around your heel were to stretched out. I think if ur looking for some good house shoe slippers they do fit well and they are super stylish.
3.0,Purchased for wifey in September 2010.....the bag honestly looked better online than in real....more brown than copper.<br /><br />Cheap construction.
3.0,"Love the color.  The cut is nice.  It's looser in the hips than I like, so it hangs more than hugs.  It also has a fabric that is prone to getting pilly fast, which is a bummer.  I like it just fine, but I wouldn't order another."
3.0,"These are really cute, however they seemed to be a little too long."
3.0,"This dress would have been beautiful on a more slim person than I. The color was beautiful and the fit through the arms and chest was as expected but the waist area was too tight and the material was very clingy. I ordered the Large because I am an 8/10 with a bit of a tummy. The fit was not flattering around my midsection and the material was too clingy that it showed the lines of the shapewear. The arms and chest had some extra room too so going a size up would not have solved the issue. Not the dress's fault, but I had to return because of the fit."
3.0,"Very beautiful necklace, I love it.<br />The down side is that the chain came a little rusty. No worth it to send it back because of the shipping payment. :("
3.0,"It's a lovely rayon material, a nice mid-length, and cute. A few issues, it is fairly sheer (got the pink, maybe not an issue in darker colors?) so you definitely have to wear a slip.  The pink is closer to peach, but not a bad color, still pretty. But the reason I am returning is it is more low cut than I wanted - the top of the dress is right about flush with top of my bra - it's sort of loose, so if I bend over to pick something up, well no one wants to see that on a 60 year old lady!"
3.0,Really small. Not like the usual piercings but theyre cute.
3.0,Look much more comfortable than they actually are.
3.0,Cute skirt but difficult to get out the wrinkles in the pleats that got there during transit. Makes me think that it would be equally difficult after laundering.
3.0,The dress is nicely made. The cotton quality is satisfactory. I find that the waist does not fit comfortably. It seems to ride higher up. This could be me. It is worth the purchase to give it a try.
3.0,It was kinda ugly. Looked poorly made and already has fuzzies everywhere. If it were cheaper maybe I’d keep it. But it’s definitely not worth the price
3.0,Really like and want to like these... Only issue is the seam on the front makes wearing these and walling very uncomfortable been trying things to soften the seam its working okay still hopeful
3.0,"Looks and feels great. It's too small though. I would normally buy a xl but I chose to get a double xl just in case it ran small. It sure did, but still looks great."
3.0,"This dress is thick and a great length. However, I am returning it. The seam around the just is longer on one side and the it looks horribly obvious because of the stripes."
3.0,One ear fits ok. The other won't stay on. Could be my ears.
3.0,"Es bueno por el precio, pero es un poco más opaco de lo que muestra en fotos"
3.0,"I love the shine & design of this piece. It fits well and stretchs. The only thing that I don't like is the clasp.  The clasp is a bit cheap looking, weak and ugly."
3.0,My wife says it was to. Thin
3.0,Ran very very small
3.0,They are just good. I already buy 3  of them
3.0,Gave this to the kids and the little bulbs were falling out by end of day. Not made very well.
3.0,Just not comfortable
3.0,Cute for Winter but a little cheaply made.  Not worth the price. The sapphire color is mor topaz blue than sapphire.
3.0,"I went to a Bridgerton themed tea party in this dress. It served it purpose. I weight 156 and I'm a 10-12 in clothing. I got a large because I wasn't sure how it would fit. The gown was too big. Unless you are blessed with a rather large chest (which I am not), the top is going to be baggy. I had to safety pin it in place so it wouldn't fall off of my shoulder and sag in the front. The arms were tight but I could live with that. Wish I would've went with a medium but oh well! Going to have someone alter it so I can wear it again for Halloween."
3.0,I received the watch Saturday on time. Props to the seller for shipping. It's a beautiful watch for the price. I was very satisfied with the appearance. However when winding the watch Monday morning the hour hand got caught by the second hand and caused the hour hand to break and bend. How does this happen on the beginning of the second day? I will be contacting the company since the watch is under warranty. I will post another review to tell how the company handled the situation.
3.0,The chest cups are too big and hard.
3.0,"It's a bit snugger around my middle than I like, but I'm keeping it.  It's the fabric that's the problem.  It's very clingy, like most things nowadays.  Not at all forgiving!  But, if I'd lose a pound or two, that might help!  :)Other than that, cute top."
3.0,I love Grace Karin and have bought many GK clothes that fit great. I have found the smalls to be a little loose on top but just right at the hips.... not this dress. The top was a little loose and although 7 could get the dresses on over my hips or was too small. A medium would have been far too large at top. It's beautiful but don't buy unless you have super slim hips
3.0,Well made but hurts top of my ear if I leave it in all day long .
3.0,"Liked the looks, but it's a lot bigger and thicker than I thought from pics and the numbers they say in the ad. Also, the movement is kind of ""loose"" with the second hand lazily bouncing around as it moves, like it's going to fall off at some point?"
3.0,These run very small. Size up 1 to 1.5 sizes!!! So adorable but disappointed since these don’t fit and are no longer available in the size needed.
3.0,"I am 5’3” 112 pounds and I ordered a size XS. The dress itself is boxy so it looked odd on my petite figure. The bottom of the dress does not run straight down, instead it flares out which was a big no for me(since the product picture shows it as straight down). The sleeves are also wide & the fabric is scratchy. I sadly had to return it."
3.0,Shoes are beautiful just little bit wider than I expected and kind of look lose on my feet.
3.0,"I saw the reviews about this jacket and ordered a size up thinking I'd be set, but it ended up still being too small. I'm hoping the x-large will be in stock soon so I can swap it out for one that actually fits. Besides the size, the quality is really good and the embroidery is really well done."
3.0,Fits smaller than expected.
3.0,"The silver plate wore out very easily and the shipping time was long but it was very beautiful until the river plate came off of it , what can a person expect for 3 dollers lol"
3.0,get one size smaller
3.0,"While I love the color, this top looks nothing like the photo.  It just looks big and boxy making me appear heavier than I am"
3.0,"These are nice and work well for an under shirt, as I wanted, only thing is after first wash, I had to sew the strap on, it ripped from the back bottom strap, just a few stiches back together, I did't see a need to send them back. Overall good quality for the money."
3.0,"This dress was super baggy around the mid section/hip area, making my body look heavy and frumpy. The pockets just added to that look."
3.0,Fits but the material is a bit chintzy. Definitely needs a slip. Don't think it will last long.
3.0,No second hand on watch
3.0,"I had to cut them down, so they'd fit into the shoe.  But they still seem too thick.  I feel they could work for some people, just not me."
3.0,"I don't know where the pocket clip went, but I ended up getting a different kind with the clip  Why put that pocket clip in the description if it's not there"
3.0,Very small and comes with extra backs. Nothing fancy or anything really. But works
3.0,Fall off easily
3.0,To big! ONE SIZE FITS PUMPKIN HEAD!
3.0,for my daugter
3.0,"It’s a cute dress , ordered 1-3 size for 2.5 year old daughter , it’s sits just above the knees!!  Better to go a size up!!"
3.0,"The draw string on the skirt doesn't do much. The skirt is hold up to your body by thick elastic waistband. Yet this band is tight & flipping around when you put the skirt on/off. I tried to flip it back but couldn't. The draw string add extra difficulty for the task. I'm lazy to return. Hopefully the waistband will loosen up more after a few use. If you have big belly, this skirt is not for you."
3.0,"It is not as long as the one pictured in the ad...I am of average height, 5'4&#34;, and the back of the kimono only reaches to mid thigh, not the back of my knees"
3.0,"Very short, not at all long as pictured. Would recommend sizing up at least one for the baggy, off shoulder look. Decent material, more t-shirt like."
3.0,"The color is beautiful, but too small"
3.0,"The contection to charge shocks you when gets wet and lights work when they want, besides that look nice and fits nice."
3.0,It fits as expected. But it's very sheer material.
3.0,"This is not for big hunters, the straps do not extend long enough for a comfortable fit.  If you are bundled up for cold weather, might as well leave it at home.  The logo patch sewed on the front looks like some piece of rag that was attached that happened to have the logo on it.  Very disappointed to see the Vortex label on a sub-par product."
3.0,It's alright is not like I expected. I need a longer one
3.0,"I bought this scarf for my elderly mom thinking it would keep her warm.  It might be nice for a night out on the town, but its very thin and doesn't seem to have much warmth to it.  I returned it and received my money back.  Thank you."
3.0,I have to say being a very active buyer on Amazon I have yet found the same thread count as in a say Macy's and I see another thing is normally two buttons on sleeves. The tighter around the wrist area and you can see your hand and watch. So knowing it's not wash and dry now as well I will keep and get buttons sewed on.
3.0,Came as shown some really big on the waist
3.0,"The sleeves would not stay rolled up and secure, which became pretty bothersome during the day."
3.0,still have it but will give it as a gift.....looks a little different than I thought ....but it is a keeper
3.0,"They fit tight & my hands are not big. They took forever to arrive, that I honestly forgot I ordered them."
3.0,I am an adult. These hats run small. It would give better warmth if it covered my ears. These hats would be great for kids 10+
3.0,"They're alright. They fit as expected but they're more sheer than other similar shorts that I've had. They're breathable, though. Comfortable. No issues with the seams"
3.0,Creat produt
3.0,Didn't love the color and didn't like the sweetheart neckline.
3.0,Love the earrings. Yes slightly heavier and I think that is was caused the one to just slide off.  Tried switching the backings and was unsuccessful.  We were traveling and my stud backings fit so I could still wear for our night out.
3.0,Made for a large busted woman. Looks ridiculous on normal or small size chest.
3.0,"Looks and feels great, I wear a size 8 thought and they are kind of snug around the toe, I would go a little bigger than the size you wear."
3.0,FELL APART AFTER A FEW WEEKS.
3.0,Too short. I am 5'9. Pair with cute bottoms and it will be fine
3.0,"These are nice but fit a little snug on my head. If you have a larger head size or very thick hair, they're a little uncomfortable. Probably will stretch out a little with time?"
3.0,Purchased the xl fits more like a XXL or even a XXXL. The material is not silk but more of a satiny type of material which I figured it would be judging by the pictures that I seen. Over all I do like it but I believe it's over priced and I would only purchase again if I catch it on sale.
3.0,"It's cute, but it unfortunately looks like a nightgown on me."
3.0,It was a tad too small and the stitching wasn't done well
3.0,"cheap and cheaply made but they work, don't roll down and fit my fat 15&#34; biceps. The come up high enough on my arm if I really pull them up so that there is no sun exposure between end of tshirt sleeve and top of arm cover sleeves"
3.0,"Broken! Considering it was ""lightly"" used, it was good;however, the screw that holds the handle to the case was broken,& there's no way to fix it. There is only one handle to carry the case,so the fact that it's broken makes the case difficult to use."
3.0,It was not a jacket like I thought.
3.0,It's pretty but lot smaller than it was supposed to.
3.0,"The shirt and the headband fit perfectly, however the pants were too small. My daughter ended up splitting the pants in the middle."
3.0,Definitely wouldn't describe the color as a green of any kind. Heel area is a little strange. Cute for the price.
3.0,"I bought these for my finance and she said it feels like she is wearing a diaper.  She hasn't tried wearing it while biking yet and would most definitely not wear them by themselves, but rather as undershorts."
3.0,Not what I expected but nice
3.0,were a little large for my use..love the color though..wish i could find smaller ones like this
3.0,"It fits fine but isn't really flattering for my size (size 8, 5'2).  It isn't terrible but it made me appear bigger in the waste than I actually am.  It works, but I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,"Pretty but the catch is unreliable,poor quality"
3.0,It's ok. The picture looks good but in real life it's not even close.
3.0,Adorable but noisy! I can’t keep it closed. It always pops open on it’s own. Baby Yoda is constantly smacking against his metal carriage. Annoying
3.0,"It is a functional calendar with cute pictures but the pics are literally from Shutterstock or similar. You'd be better to support a bulldog rescue that produces its own calendar, and help dogs at the same time."
3.0,Nice but small ok for price n amount of items
3.0,"I think the price should be a bit lower for the quility of the product. I purchased this for my mother on Christmas, its nice and she was happy with it but it looked like I bought it at a dollar store. A+ for packaging. It made it look more expensive"
3.0,"Very large, not available smaller than Small"
3.0,Not as long as photo presents it to be. I'm 5'9 and it hits about 6 inches above my foot. Not what I expected.
3.0,"I purchased this to replace my ski mask for running.  I wanted something that wasn't as tight on my face as the ski mask.  This is perfect, with one exception.  It isn't long enough.  If it were just a little bit longer so that I could tuck it into my jacket collar then it would be perfect.  But I'm making do with it as is just a little disappointed."
3.0,Super itchy!! The little string at the top was an ugly color. Should have been the same color as the lace or gold. It was cute but I couldn't keep it on. Had to change halfway through the night from the irritation on my chest.
3.0,"Very pretty!  I'm only sad it does not close at the top, so my lipgloss comes rolling out when I set it down sometimes"
3.0,Not the same necklace that's advertised but I'll do!
3.0,The earrings look nice but won't stay up on the side of the ear.The earrings I got were packed separate so they were for the same ear.Was able to stray-en so its for the left and right ear.ear. That's way the 3 stars .
3.0,Stone is bulky and not flat which is what I wanted.
3.0,A little tight in the arms and chest.
3.0,Attractive bag but way too small for today's ladies who carry iphones and/or cameras in addition of bare necessities.
3.0,Fabric is thinner than I thought it would be
3.0,The watch was pretty but I did not like the leather bands. There not comfortable.
3.0,"these do provide some cushion for my heel but for my foot, it then creates a larger space between the heel and arch. For my foot, I think i need something that extends into the arch."
3.0,Missing the lol stone all on the left side :(
3.0,"Very clingy material, order a size up. The sipper bunched up too much"
3.0,"Very cheap looking, but colors were vibrant."
3.0,These bags aren’t as big as I thought. I don’t like wrapping big gifts so I thought a couple of large gift bags would work . Only a small doll with maybe an outfit would fit. These aren’t as large as I thought they were.
3.0,Items fit very snug around the upper arm.
3.0,It's not the color in the photo. Smaller than anticipated.
3.0,"They were a little tight on my hands and when I first started wearing them, but after wearing them several times they loosened up"
3.0,The fabric is very rough and the waist has an elastic which is weak and stretched out.
3.0,The bracelet is too small but don’t have time to return for exchange but it is very pretty.
3.0,The fit is excellent and true to size. The sandals are extremely comfortable and cute. My one complaint is the placement of the front strap is too far forward. It is just strange looking. Every sandal I've ever worn hits a little before or at the base of the toes. This hits more at the toes. It's hard to explain but it's pretty awkward looking. It ruined a perfect sandal. If you look at the user photos you'll see what I mean. It almost covers some people's toes entirely.
3.0,This shoe is wider than normal medium width. With an arch support insert the fit improves.
3.0,If I would of known it was just glued on I wouldn’t of bought them. Oh well. We’ll see how long they last. Hope the glued on plastic sheet stays on the lenses.
3.0,This is my first and only Crafter Blue rubber strap.... I like the look of this design..... the price for this strap is lower than your average CB strap... however I find that the rubber is a little too hard for me.... I find it uncomfortable when wearing these straps which is stopping me from buying their other models... wonder if the other higher price straps have the same rubber....
3.0,Kind of big but looks ok i guess
3.0,Dress is of stretchy material. Has pockets. After 1 washing I had 2 holes I had to fix before I could wear it for the first time.
3.0,Nice watch but is very frustrating to set. It is not hard to set with a lot of buttons but still a pain. Looks nice when on and seems to keep time well
3.0,"It's cute, but I wish the visor part was a little bit bigger."
3.0,Listed as extra large but are very tight. Might be extra large for a Chinese man but not a  man that weighs 250 pounds. Need to rethink the sizing chart.
3.0,"Pendant was very nice, but the necklace was dirty.  Had to clean it before we presented the gift to our daughter-in-law.  Good thing we got it before it went to her.  Wold have been embarrassed if it went to her like we received it."
3.0,I ordered an xl and got a 4x. Still love the shirt but its big enough for the undertaker himself.
3.0,"Overall it's a good watch, I like it. The minute hand is difficult to see because it's red. It looks clear in the picture, but in real life you have to bring the watch close to your face to make it out."
3.0,Hard to close.
3.0,"Loved this shirt, and it was amazing quality, however the shirt is shorter then normal and got even shorter after one wash."
3.0,"To small for my wrist.  I needed a large, I received what seems to be a small.  Great looking."
3.0,"These are really cute, but they are a bit too wide for my head. They tend to fall off if I'm looking down"
3.0,"This dress is very thin material but otherwise not bad.  I plan to use it for a nightgown so works ok for that!  If planning to wear out, just know it will show everything!!"
3.0,"I don't think these should pop up during my DG search,  not to bad for price,  I'm not a fan of polarized. But overall good quality for product."
3.0,"Cheap, as expected. The front hangs low and kind of makes it look like a maternity shirt."
3.0,it is more blue than grey
3.0,This was my thirst pair I have purchased. I originally ordered xxl due to all the reviews. I ride in them but they are a little large ( I am a size 34 waist) so I ordered xl the next time and they were a good fit.  I wanted to order another pair xl and did but they shipped xxl and I hate dealing with returning things. So if Amazon could of got it right and sent me what I ordered I would have given a higher rating
3.0,"I ordered ""Gorgeous fall"" but got an ""Army green"" instead. Right now it says that color is 'unavailable'. So they simply decided if it got out of stock after I'd ordered it why not send a different color. I do not like when companies do this trick. Nevertheless, the scarf is 100% silk, I owe several silk scarves. It's thin but so soft. The quality is also great, all the stitches are good. The packaging is super cute as well. Had it not been an ""Army green"" I would have just kept it."
3.0,"Idk man. I want to like this, but the fit is weird. They’re tight in my legs, ok in the butt, but right above the butt and the waist is weird. Like baggy. Happens no matter where I sit them on my hips. The color is great and the material is nice. And they are long enough to reach my ankles.  Maybe once I lose some of this covid weight and fall comes around these will fit better. For reference I’m a leggy 5’6, 28 waist, 34 hips with a squat butt."
3.0,"it arrived very late, but overall great product. came with a free nose ring."
3.0,I was a little disappointed to see the package deal contained soccer socks when it clearly stated baseball! Now I gotta try and locate actually baseball socks! But over all quality of the socks and belt is nice! Just wasn’t needing soccer socks!
3.0,"I got the black and white circles and the blue, black and white southwest looking pattern. These are kind of see through even if you get the right size. At first I thought maybe I bought them too small, but any larger and I don't think I could keep them on during a workout. If you wear nude undies, you can't really tell so I'm making them work. It's the white that really makes these see through, I like the blue pattern better than the black and white."
3.0,Bigger than I would have liked but that was my fault for not reading the specks.
3.0,"I did not pay attention to the detail about the hems, both sleeve and skirt, are un-hemmed.  Nice material, great color.  Returned as it was just a tad too small."
3.0,It fits a tad small. Like it otherwise though!
3.0,"Very cheap looking. If you are busty and have ANY kind of sag to your chest whatsoever, steer clear. I wasn't expecting much. But this was pretty disappointing, you can buy a cute decent dress from forever 21 for the same price. However they did contact me immediately after my review to resolve the issue. The seller was great to work with!"
3.0,"cute, comfy and accurate to the photo. I got the green color and love it. I got a medium and I am 5'7 135 lbs. I want to get the other colors now too! Update!  I ordered the beige color, which is not beige at all, its baby pink. I'm returning it. Lighter colors are way too see through. Black and green are cute and not as see through."
3.0,"Very cute and soft, but why is no one talking about the fact that the cord just hangs out the bottom!!? You unplug from the ‘charger’ and you just have this dumb 3-4 inches of cord hanging from each glove.. like, what?! You could tuck it in to the glove but you can see the bump and it’s not comfy. Not really a fan of that..."
3.0,I'm a 33 in the waist. these fit but are tight. The material is lightweight and I've seen better made
3.0,"The shoes are comfortable and perfect for wearing with slacks, but I bought these specifically because I suffer with Plantar Fascitis and these shoes  make little difference in comparison to any other shoe with a bit of arch support.  I did like that they come with a few inserts to lift your foot inside the shoe....it's not advertised as such, but my one of my legs is a smidge shorter than the other due to a car accident and it's helped with my gait."
3.0,"Great product but the small size is more like a large.<br />Way too big, maybe it is small for guys, IDK.<br />I am defiantly impressed with the material of the quality of the material."
3.0,"A bit too tight around my 2 year old's calves, but the feet are a little big"
3.0,Smaller than expected but still very cute
3.0,"Works well, water proof and snow proof. Not very comfortable, I get to spend 75% of my day indoors so I'm not seeing outside too much i get to rest my feet but i would not recommend for someone who works long hours in rough conditions.<br />Price is very economical and material quality is decent. Fits as expected"
3.0,"The post/wire on this earring is so thick that I can not comfortably wear them.  Since it was received as an anniversary gift, I cannot not keep them.  It is unfortunate.  I don't think the design is as delicate in reality as it appears in the picture."
3.0,Not too bad for what it cost Corners are puckered causing it not to keep it shaped very well zippers could have been placed a little more easier to get to
3.0,"I just got the JET BLACK OMBRÉ SEAMLESS LEGGINGS, and I love the fit and everything but what I ordered was not the picture they showed. There’s so many holes that rise all the way to my buttcheek and you can see my underwear in the side from another hole. I’m at the gym so these are the pics I can post for now."
3.0,"Bought this for my girlfriend.  Material does not give much.  Seems to fit a little too tight, not like a traditional hoodie.  Overall not a bad product.  Would recommend getting at least a size larger than expected, if not two sizes"
3.0,Very stylish but not a lot of arch support. I only wear them a couple hours at a time anyway.
3.0,"Nice senior sweater, but not as warm and heavy as I hoped"
3.0,I love the style but they fit way too loose.  Always falling down or off.
3.0,"Arms, armpits and shoulders run small.  Order up."
3.0,Are you doing was not nearly as easy on easy off as advertised
3.0,Decent quality for the price. Fit as expected.
3.0,They are not brown but clear.i ordered chocolate colored
3.0,this product size was not as expected.  I had to give it away.  Disappointed
3.0,It’s hard to keep the band tight on my wrist. But i do like it
3.0,Fit very large for the size for my daughters foot. Very cute shoe- wish it would have worked out.
3.0,Cute shirt. The tunic is not very long and it is sold in Asian sizes. The color is not red. It is more of a orange red color but it is still cute. I must wear pants with it at all times. I'm 5'6 and wear a size 11 jeans.
3.0,Never got the necklace only the bracelet
3.0,Like how it drakes on my body. Can be worn for casual and work.
3.0,"Quality was decent for the price, chest was WAYYY too tight for 34DD, i am 5'6 and the proportions and length were off. it was a complete empire waist and was skin tight at the top, does not fit like model at all. maybe if i had ordered a large or xl the top would have fit, but the skirt part would have been huge. even on the medium, it just seemed like too much extra fabric on the skirt part and hung weird. I am usually a medium. would look good on an all around smaller girl."
3.0,A bit small. Thankfully my friends little boy is on the skinny side. These looked more like 3T than the 4T that i ordered.
3.0,"The shirt we got was the same, except long sleeve. No label on the packaging to let shipment fulfillers to know it was the wrong shirt."
3.0,"I am typically a large in most tops. I was looking for this to be somewhat loose for layering an undershirt if needed so I sized up to an XL. This top fit snug with no layering ability. I am 5’ 8” and this top will show my tummy every time I lift my arms. Outside of the fact that it runs real small and is short, this top was cute and decent quality. Keep your body type in mind when ordering this one."
3.0,After a month the blulight shield started to fade off the lens made the lens not so clear.
3.0,"The leggings are a little see through so I have to make sure I am wearing a longer top or dress.  The legs are also long (I am 5'6&#34; and don't ever have problems with legging length) so I have to bunch them up.  They do stay up with the high waistline and are a nice soft material, though!"
3.0,"Purchased  this for my son for summertime.. For the price it's well made, &  I know  he'll enjoy wearing it"
3.0,"Shirt was so thin, I could see through it.<br />Long sleeve cuffs do not stretch, or they were already stretched out completely."
3.0,Colors really vibrant. My only complaint is that I believe it's overpriced compared to some I have seen before.
3.0,"I liked the dress, but I'm returning because the red hit in a weird place on my legs (not where it hit the model).  I'm 5'10&#34; and am not very surprised at this issue.  I ordered smaller than I would have usually, and while I fit, I think the dress should have fit a bit looser.  There's also a bit of a dolman sleeve going on which I hadn't realized which I'm not a big fan of.<br /><br />The dress quality is good, but on me it just didn't work."
3.0,It’s cute looks like the picture but they are not touch screen fingers they are regular gloves
3.0,The top was small but I thought it was still cute.
3.0,"I loved this dress so much, but it was way too sheer. Such a shame."
3.0,Me mandaron otro color
3.0,"I wear em, but they are too small. Very tight and short."
3.0,I ordered these hoping they were truly compression tank tops but they fit rather loosely.  I'm small and usually wear petite size clothing. I ordered these in small but there isn't really compression like advertised.  They are good for an extra layer for warmth when I'm walk/jogging on a winter Arizona day (if you can call it winter in AZ)
3.0,"As others have noted, each shirt fit a bit differently. The black one falls off my shoulder, so I won't wear that one. Also, I got two of the same color. However, for the price, it's not a bad deal."
3.0,These scrubs are made well. The top was a little too big for me and as I lifted my arms the top felt tight on my shoulders. The pants fit just as expected. I'm five foot four and weigh 145 and I ordered XL after reading reviews. Like I said the top was a little large and the pants fit.  I received these scrubs at a discounted price for my honest unbiased review.
3.0,I was thinking the beads would be larger for chanting a little hard to deal with
3.0,"Liked that the piece had a clip. I used it clipped in hair, then to strap of dress for a showy statement piece, fun"
3.0,"Definitely cut small... not quite as bright yellow as on the screen, and not lined. However, cute,  and happy. :)"
3.0,Pretty color but feet do get cool without multiple socks they are not waterproof or water resistant my feet get wet in wet snow No liner
3.0,"Hat is of good quality.  Prefer Made in USA products - not China, especially when using the symbol of an elite UN Navy Group. The emblem is “printed” rather than embroidered so I suspect the ink will eventually wear off. Would be 5 stars if these two points were met."
3.0,"Pretty, slinky fabric. Gathering is to high for me - strangely so - so I removed it! Like the dress much more now."
3.0,They run big so order a size smaller.
3.0,The loop on the tail broke right away. Had to use safety pin to secure
3.0,Fit as expected and shipped quickly. Not giving it 5 stars because the front cut out left too much of a risk of a slip out (not enough support).
3.0,"I really like these necklaces but when my daughter opened the packages on Christmas, they smelled as if they had been doused in chemicals! We let them air out for about a week, then decided to soak them in water and kinda &#34;wash&#34; them, but with no soap. That helped a little, but it took using scented soap to either remove or cover the horrendous smell. These would have gotten 5 stars if they didn't smell so bad."
3.0,I like the cut of the dress but material is thin and it wrinkles very easily
3.0,Do not put in dryer. They tend to shrink.
3.0,"While I was surprised about the &#34;value&#34; listed on this... I suppose I shouldn't have been... just thought I'd gotten lucky - the truth is it is a nice item, but not seemingly worth what is stated in the price - thus making you think that you got a great deal on a wonderful item - this is not the case, and you really need to follow the provided instructions on how to open the clasp.<br />I am giving it to multiple family members for mother's day in a gift bag with multiple other items or I would return."
3.0,Cute but the seams are heavy making it feel itchy and it runs slightly snug.
3.0,This dress it beautiful and light to wear . However is has a seam right in front and I can’t figure out why is was designed that way . The seam is just really noticeable in the front and seems like a design flaw .
3.0,"i have small ears, so it doesnt fit me. it doesnt have an adjustable size, but ut was less then a dollar, so i may give it to a friend. its made if a good medal that doesnt break and painted in a cute brushed fashion"
3.0,Cheap and hard to put on. I put it on my friend and she looked cute(she has a much larger bust) but it was still kinda sketch to wear out and just very cheaply made.
3.0,"My son loves it. It broke literally within minutes of wearing right where the ring attaches to the AT-AT. I drilled a hole, repainted it where drilled and sanded off broken connection point, attached a split ring, and now it's good to go. MacGyver expense minus 2 ☆'s"
3.0,"The quality of this dress seems great and the embroidery is pretty, but the pockets make the bottom half of the dress so unflattering. I barely have hips, yet the pockets create such an exaggerated and uneven flare that the dress made me look like I was carrying an extra 25-30 lbs from the waist down. Not attractive."
3.0,"Finally received, no fault of the supplier, however I must admit I'm a bit disappointed :( the color isn't black, but more a shimmery purple-ish, mauve color..... I have a black pearl pendant...this is defo not black, nothing like the dark picture on amazon!!! Otherwise, they are nice."
3.0,Beautiful colors. Slightly small great for summer
3.0,"Returned it immediately.  The hat was a tad too small.  Did not seem true to measurement.  I will say that the hat seemed to be of good quality.  Its a plain hat, not much too say."
3.0,"Love the design on it, but the back of the belt keeps flaking onto my kid's pants."
3.0,"I would have preferred the dress to fall at the knee or slightly longer. I wear a size 12 and this was an XL, which typically is a 14. I was nevertheless pleasantly surprised by the fit compared to other online purchases."
3.0,"This product was so cute, I had to try ... It broke within a week of normal wear. I may repurchase anyway."
3.0,"If it fit, I might have liked it better. I usually wear a size medium, however, this shirt was huge. The picture shows it as a swing-type shirt; it’s just boxy.  I might have ordered it in a small anyway, but it wouldn’t have arrived before I left on vacation. It is also a little noisy, I imagine that’s because of the sun protection in the shirt."
3.0,Doesn't ring very loud so it doesn't wake my grandson up.  Very nicely made and nice size too.
3.0,"Lenses do not match the originals 100%, maybe 85%. Therefore  they do not fit perfectely to the frame.  They are slightly bigger and change the appearance  of the sunglasses a bit.  There is also a small gap between the lenses and the frame on the upper side of the frame because of that.Yet, vision quality seems good.  I hope durability will be good too. All together,  for the price, it seems like an OK deal. Not more than that"
3.0,Kinda small for the price
3.0,"The shoes are great, and my son loved them.  BUT.....they fell apart after 30 days.  I understand kids can be rough on shoes, but I don't think they should split apart after a month.  I'm disappointed that such an expensive shoe didn't last the whole Summer.  Buyer beware."
3.0,"They break too easily….otherwise, ok."
3.0,"One pair arrived with chipped frame right below nose pad. Looks like oversight in quality control. Otherwise decent. Red and blue frame color not very noticeable. But don’t care about that. Blue light blocking appears to be minimal, but looking at iPad screen appears warmer so may help some. And iPad reduces blue light output at night. So also no big deal.<br /><br />Despite the defect in the one pair being small, it’s the same inconvenience to exchange them."
3.0,Quality is so-so.  As expected for this price.
3.0,"These look OK.Not as fluffy as pictures but do look better than others. A little harder to put on than I thought they'd be but I do wear glasses. Description said medium size usually fits women but I have small ears and think if u are a woman with a bigger ear get large. Of course you can always exchange if a medium is too small. Not looking forward to cold weather, lol, but hope these will stay on and keep ears warm because i wear my hair short. Enjoy!"
3.0,"I bought this for a halloween costume thinking I could wear it again in a casual setting. I'm really disappointed by the fabric, which really is that of a halloween costume. It's a costume polyester feeling blend, and is not something I will probably wear again."
3.0,The top did not fit well maybe because I have a little more at the top than bottom but my boobs  were showing. Wasn’t crazy about the material either
3.0,"Cute hat, but cheap material. Would not order another."
3.0,"The pj's fit but after a wash, the sleeves are so tight that it stretches the neck out until you forcefully have to pull the sleeves up."
3.0,"These I love, BUT you need to reinforce the stitching around the whole top part of the bag where the straps are, they have both broke with weight in the bag. Weight like running clothes and a toiletry bag, so not that heavy."
3.0,"Product was received as described (in a plastic ziplock, in a felt drawstring bad, in a plastic protective bag... a little wasteful in my opinion). I purchased this to use as a charm bracelet for my daughter with allergies.  I added her medic alert tag to the existing bracelet with no problem.  Within the first day of use, the letter charm had fallen off.  Within three days, the small circle brand pendant thing had also fallen off.  Does not affect the overall function, but does not bode well for the longevity of the product."
3.0,"Amazon delivered clip ons that were smaller than what I ordered.  They work okay but because they don't cover my glasses, they make me look even more geeky than if they had covered my lenses."
3.0,Tin was slightly damaged
3.0,quality material does run small I bought a large when I normally wear small
3.0,Cute saying but the keychain looks cheaply made. The top looked scratched.
3.0,Though they arrived quickly and seemed to be of good quality they ended up being to small and didn't have any give whete the arms meet the frame.
3.0,It works but is very bulky and uncomfortable
3.0,I actually returned this.  It was just too much watch band for me.
3.0,"Cute costume, but the breast cups didn't align for a proper fit. There's no adjustments on the shoulder straps to assist with this. I am 5'8 D cup and the breast cup bottom hit half way on my breast and went up from there. I ordered the Large. I don't know if an X-large would make a difference, but it wouldn't get here on time for me to try."
3.0,Iv had it since end of feb for my 4 year old and it’s already not turning on Iv left it on charger for over a hour and still no luck but sadly I threw the box away to return it thinking it was good to go. Any luck on getting it to turn back on ? She doesn’t really understand it so she rarely plays with it so I’m not sure how it’s already broken
3.0,"i didnt realize that this was so big.  maybe i can  find a smaller one. other than that, it is nice"
3.0,Loved the bold red color and it fits  true to size. Doesn’t wash well. After the first wash there were light spots all over it
3.0,It really depends on the fit you like for your cardigans; this DOES fit across my chest (38F) but that means its loose everywhere else. Will probably return for a smaller one but that's just because of my own personal preference.
3.0,Not the best fit for my small head however great quality.
3.0,"Unfortunately these leggings were too short for me. I’m 5’9 and they are about 3 inches too short and they go much higher on my stomach as I would have wanted and the waist is not as pictured, it’s more of a tight elastic and hugs in the wrong place. They’re not very stretchy other than the tight elastic waist band either. With that being said, they are very warm and very cute!"
3.0,I really wanted to love these nose hoops but they were a hassle to get in and out without stretching it out too far. I even pinched my nose a few times. Maybe these would work in a different piercing.
3.0,They are cute and have pocket for filters but after i washed them couple times ( by the washing machine) the pictures started to pale.
3.0,"The quality is good and very thick (if you like thick cover),  unfortunately it is not big enough for a US passport. Returned and received refund."
3.0,"Cheaply made, not very durable, but I suspected that when I bought them to use for a prop."
3.0,The fit is not that great
3.0,"Not super flattering on me, so I am returning. I’m usually an XS in dresses, so I was taking a risk. Dress is cute, comfy and good quality so it’s a shame it didn’t fit like I had hoped."
3.0,"fits kinda weird and tight in certain places not to mention they keep falling down, constantly have to pull them up. would not buy again."
3.0,Ok for the price. Looks cheap
3.0,Ordered a Medium and fits like a Small.
3.0,"These glasses literally brighten my day as I hike, keep the little buggies out of my eyes, and they’re lightweight and comfortable. My only issue is they arrived with a couple minor scratches on the lenses.  If not for that, I would’ve rated with 4 or 5 stars."
3.0,"Decent quality, easy to self customize/repaint. Aren’t secured to the headband very well so I advise you to have a hot glue gun for easy reattachment."
3.0,This dress is a nice material and fit for my size but just wasn't flattering. I have nice curves that i like to show off and this made me look very boxy.<br />Still a really nice dress and would recommend to a maybe a person with less curves.
3.0,"Bought a few months ago and when I got it out to wear it, it has a hole where the cuff is sewn on the sleeve. But time is up to send back. I'll check my items right away from now on."
3.0,I got this as a gift for my mother and she loved it. The only issues were that the one of the arms of the hoodie was made of a different kind of fabric and the sizes runs small I got her a 2xl and it fit like a 1xl
3.0,I like this product - it is the same type of wand you can buy at Disney.... The thing I didn't like is that the jewels have already fallen off the side of the wand and I have only had it 2 weeks.
3.0,Beautiful dress just entirely too long
3.0,"Beautiful watch! Was received super fast Internationally.  Did have to pay a jeweler to size the band, but didn't mind as it was the hard to find look and feel that I was hoping for. The bad news is that I am updating my review due to lack of longevity. The price has reduced since I purchased it. Since I paid a bit more, I expected a bit more life out of. Utilized the warranty and had a free repair the first year. Now, just a month outside of my warranty. It is broken again. Second hand moves, but minute and hour hands do not. Affordable price, but disappointed with the quality. Still in debate over buying another."
3.0,Fit is good. It seems the leather is of low quality as it easily gets gouged and marked up.  I do a lot of walking on carpet and heals are already showing wear.  The price is probably the reason.
3.0,Shorts were too tight n top too big
3.0,"The pads were not wide enough, but once I removed them, these fit OK. Not very well made though, so I don't expect them to last very long. Also, I wouldn't want to do anything more than mild exercise in these."
3.0,Love the color.  Very soft. Pockets are shallow and stuff falls out.  Not quite thick enough to ward off the chill in my excessively air conditioned office.
3.0,Neckline to lg.Had to return.
3.0,"Runs small. I washed it before trying it on therefore I can’t return it.  I am 5’5” weigh 200 lbs wear a size 16 and the xxl fits tight in breast, thighs."
3.0,break super easy
3.0,Pretty brown color. So soft and Bump friendly! I’m 30 weeks and it hugs my bump perfectly. I didn’t realize it has pockets which kind of draw attention to your hips. Only negative for me is it’s Too short - hits at my ankles. The pictures made it seem like it would be much longer.
3.0,Had to return because the size is so small!
3.0,"Size at least 2 sizes up or you won’t be able to breath, and that’s if you can get it on"
3.0,"I am 5ft 8in tall with a 34C bust.  This dress is comfortable and flattering, however there is no zipper causing stitching to break as you take the dress on and off which in a very short time will cause holes around the waistline.  I would not recommend.  To view recommended apparel items from Amazon go to Shopwithtinge.com"
3.0,Not sure why the Male jacket was so tight. I ordered it for myself because normal Male clothes are bigger but the shoulders and arms and tight and when I hold up my arms the jacket goes up with it. I looks great but I am very disappointed with the size fitting because I am normally a large if I wear Male clothes.
3.0,Color was off from picture. The purse was actually red.
3.0,"I really wanted to keep this, but it was very large for my standard key.  Had to return."
3.0,"Disappointed, as they're supposed to fit to an adult size 12 and she wears a size 9 1/2."
3.0,"I would give it 5 stars if the photo is not misleading.<br /><br />Pro: cheap price, watch works good so far (didn't test waterproof yet). It has time, day, weekday, alarm, solar power, etc.<br /><br />Con:  It's a huge watch, much bigger than the photo shows. Definitely not for ladies."
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about these shoes, they are cute as hell but hurt your feet like you owe them money so if your looking for style and not comfort, this is your shoe. I got the mauve, it was true to size and the color is much lighter in person, like a buff color almost"
3.0,it is bigger than my face and it has edges that I don't like
3.0,I wanted so much to love and keep this. There's just not enough space  or rather no space at all between the cups. It's very narrow.  I tried one size up and still not enough room for the girls and yes I'm only an A cup
3.0,"A little snug for an XL causing the tiers to lie flat rather than &#34;tiery.&#34; The back of the bottoms were loose, but not the front. More weight to lose by summer."
3.0,If they had one more size up then it might just fit my shoe. I am size 12 4E U.S and I got the largest they had XXXXL. The rubber that surrounds the boot stretches like a thin rubber when you put your shoe in that looks like it will tear over time. Had to return for different brand for bigger size and stronger and less cheap of a build.
3.0,"I normally wear a 3X, after reading the reviews I went a size up!  So glad I did!  It still isn't as roomy as others I have.  The material started out great but after a few washes it has turned very cheap looking.  Not very happy with the quality of this cardigan.  Would not recommend or buy again. :("
3.0,Good quality but runs large.
3.0,Too slim for me and difficult to connect. Seems like it might fall off. Returning it.
3.0,It’s okay. Wasn’t expecting greatness so it works.
3.0,look stupid .
3.0,"The color I loved it matched well with my shoes, however the bust area was not right the cup size is too small. The shoulder strap on one side started to tear. I do think it was a tiny bit to tight."
3.0,A little thin but worth the price.
3.0,wider than expected
3.0,I liked the style and the quality seemed good but the item ran WAY smaller than the sizing chart.
3.0,"MATERIAL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOFTEST AVAILABLE FOR HANKIES, AND 11 X 11"".  NEITHER IS TRUE.<br />THEY ACTUALLY MEASURED FROM 9 1/2-10"" BEFORE BEING LAUNDERED.  THE REASON I BOUGHT THEM WAS  THAT I HAD ORDERED A SET OF 18 FOR LESS MONEY,  BUT THE QUALITY OF BOTH SETS WAS THE SAME.  SO I HAVE SPENT NEARLY $40 AND STILL DON'T HAVE A DECENT HANKY. AND, FOR SOME REASON I AM ALLERGIC TO TISSUES, SO I AM LEFT WITHOUT A CHOICE BUT TO USE THESE THAT I PURCHASED AND HAVE A SORE NOSE<br />CONSTANTLY."
3.0,Pockets are huge and made from strong but not breathable material.  Definitively not for running but maybe good for a gym.  Order size larger than normally wearing.
3.0,ordered 2 times one showed up and the one that did are great..
3.0,size chart not true to size
3.0,——-
3.0,"I bought this bra to get away from the underwire. It’s very pretty and looks as pictured at an extremely good price. Sadly, it was just too itchy to wear for more than a couple of hours. Back to the underwire I go."
3.0,The one I bought from SHEIN was better.
3.0,It arrived and was not the same bracelet in the picture. It's cute and has pearls but the charms are different.
3.0,They are ok.  I miss my Adidas ones.
3.0,Kinda junky. It's cute but obviously cheap.
3.0,WAY bigger than I expected it to be. It also came in a pack of two? I can see why people say it may look gaudy. The barbell is barely long enough for my ear and I'm scared it'll irritate it if i leave it on all the time. Wish it was a bit smaller. 😩
3.0,didn't like material & couldn't fit on fingers
3.0,"I wanted to like this, I really did.  I mean, the idea is great and I have been considering buying one for a while.  But, this one hurts to take on and off and I find the edges to be a little scratchy."
3.0,"This Sannyra 18k gold plated Cuban bracelet is made from stainless steel and is heavy. It seems the links are durable and would be hard to break; however, the rings that connect the chain to the clasp are cheaply made which could result in the chain falling off during wear. The I definitely think the rings need to be solid and sturdy to support the weight of this bracelet. See my picture for more information."
3.0,Honestly isn’t the safest option. I used it as my first binder but after awhile it started to get holes and the material would fray and pieces would go into my skin and I would have to dig them out almost like a black head. You really get what you pay for with binders so try gc2b or underworks even.
3.0,My son wore this once. It fit smaller than expected.
3.0,"While these shoes were very comfortable, the right shoe leaked on right side of the toe box from the first day. I am thinking that the internal sealing of the seams was not done properly. Too bad since otherwise I really liked these shoes."
3.0,"Sturdy belt buckle, leather belt is okay, not a fan of the square tip of the belt."
3.0,Tanks tends to create a bit of a flare effect- fitted in chest and flares out around midsection.  Otherwise good tanks for the price.
3.0,Returned because it was very very stiff.  Not what I was looking for.  Nothing wrong with the scarf - just not what I expected
3.0,"The straps on the front are awkwardly placed and I had to cut them off because they looked like they were choking me. Otherwise, shirt is decent."
3.0,"This scarf is very soft, warm, and versitile. The problem is it sheds too much! I wore it over a fleece jacket and ended up picking gray fuzz balls off almost the entire jacket. What a mess! I still like the scarf, but not the fuzz."
3.0,Meh. My kids dont even use it. They use ear buds.
3.0,"This product was honestly a lifesaver while it worked, the adjustability is incredible, the software is user friendly, and it’s definitely the easiest way to make sure a heavy sleeper can wake up when it is important. For the first 3 months it was perfect with no issues but after that it started to go downhill, over time it has randomly disconnected, weakened, and now roughly 6 months into owning it completely lost the shock ability. I can heavily recommend this product if you are wanting a fix for oversleeping but even after taking perfect care of it it deteriorates. If the longevity issue was resolved I would hands down give this product a 5 star review."
3.0,Did not like gave away
3.0,"I purchased this suit because I thought the ruching in the tummy area would help cover that trouble area for me.  It does!  I am short, curvy, and have a larger bust, so I wanted to get something that would be figure-flattering.  Another added bonus of this suit is that it has a built in underwire, which helps when you need some extra support in the chest.  There were two things that I thought were drawbacks for me, however.  First, the way the swimsuit is cut on the side revealed a little more &#34;side boob&#34; than I was comfortable with, but that may just be the way it fit on my bust.  Secondly, the back of the suit is not lined like the front is, so I could see my underwear pretty clearly through the suit when I was trying it on.  I was a little concerned that this would be worse when the suit got wet or that chlorine would make it even more obvious if the swimsuit got bleached out.  Otherwise, the color is great and it is a great price."
3.0,Boy friend loves it. Its very detailed more of a brighter silver than the picture but still gorgeous. Only gave it 3 stars because the chain broke right away. 🙁
3.0,But it is small fit..did not fit my daughter
3.0,"Unfortunately is really hard to get the right size, they are usually really big comparing to regular shoes. We have returned two different par since we haven't been able to get the right ones."
3.0,"Nice strong and little heavy little big size than  I was expecting it. It’s very nice a clear just won’t stay able on the nose, if u wanna look down u have to hold it by hand otherwise it will be fall down easily on the floor. Otherwise  made with good quality material seems to me"
3.0,I felt the fabric was not soft on my skin and didn’t feel very breatheable.
3.0,"I had bought a variety pack of earrings from this seller before and loved them, however I had several problems with these.  While they look nice, they were bigger than the previous set (although looked similar in pictures) and they were difficult to put on / take off, as the backings were larger than necessary.  The first time I wore the gunmetal studs, the top part just broke off of one of them when I went to take them off, which was very sad.  Overall, wish I could purchase the set I bought a few years ago, but the quality seems to have had a steep decline."
3.0,This sweater is a beautiful color and the fabric is soft and smooth. But unfortunately the sweater runs small. Be sure to buy a little larger than your usual size.
3.0,"It Was too big, and I did not need the trouble sending it back."
3.0,It was really full but way too big and heavy. It’s a drawstring waist so if you’re on the thinner side it will keep falling down off of your body and the petticoat sounds like paper crumpling when you move almost as if you just stuffed newspapers under your dress
3.0,As it is on the picture
3.0,"stones had fallen out of the earrings,but were in the bag otherwise they are pretty"
3.0,"Didn’t like the lace, it hit wrong on the chest area."
3.0,"Disappointing hard to release catch,have to pull about five to six inches before it catches. It's a nice looking belt, for people with regular waist that only need a belt more for looks and not use tightly to hold up pants it will be fine!"
3.0,They are super cute but two much stuffing so don't fit her well but she will not let me return.
3.0,"I ordered an XL, which is what I normally wear. It was very tight through the shoulders, as in, I wouldn't of wanted to have tried to drive wearing the coat, or shake hands, or even button and try to move. Fit like a Med."
3.0,Pantiliners do not stick to this fabric.
3.0,"It’s cute, not so much like the picture, I always order a XL I probably wear a large or maybe a medium but to be on the safe side when ordering I do xl, this time I should’ve gotten a large it’s a little bigger then I expected. Definitely long enough for leggings and the coverage is good for the butt. Fabric is very soft. Order your normal size when ordering"
3.0,"inconsistent lengths, but nice shirts for a cheap price."
3.0,sequin quality is eh. Fits weird.
3.0,Was to small for my arm ! Other than that it was great gave it to my brother!
3.0,"Loved the fabric and colors which I was really expecting to look chintzy and cheap.. I ordered 3 -- yellow, mint and white in XXL.. I normally wear a U.S.Size 12 dress if unlined and 14 if lined. I am 38-26-38.  ThTo my disappointment 💔, none fit.  They were ""night club, hoochiie mama tight"".  I am too mature to wear something ill- fitting no matter how elegant.  So sorry, but l have no choice but to return them"
3.0,"I bought these so we could tell our 4 identical suitcases apart.  They work fine, but I am a bit concerned that they may not stand up well to frequent use.  The plastic seems a bit more brittle than expected."
3.0,"Look okay... but ran small. My daughter uses a 7, I ordered a 7.5 and they are still small."
3.0,"I bought this bag so I wouldn't have to schlepp my big honkin' range bag with a lot of unoccupied space inside. In that regard, it works for me. I was pleased to learn that it neatly fits inside the main compartment of my larger range bag, which allows me to store everything in one place at home, including cleaning supplies.<br /><br />The bag is the perfect size for my occasional trips to the range. All the necessities fit - my CZ Compact clone (a Canik55 Stingray-C 9mm), two mags and a quick loader, couple of boxes of ammo, and a few sets of foam earplugs. Actually, there are pockets for a total of eight mags, with enough extra room for my keys and smart phone.<br /><br />My issues with it may be minor to some folks, but they're still important to me. First, the removable pistol sleeve is not padded at all, and there's no zipper. It's simply an open-top fabric pouch. Second, the bag itself is not as well-padded as I had hoped. Yes, the two interior walls are padded, as is the bottom panel, but that is its only structure. Those two walls also serve as padding for the back side of the two large outer pockets. But the front sides of those pockets aren't padded at all. They're just vinyl-backed fabric, and nothing more.<br /><br />To its credit, there are a lot of interior pockets for stashing stuff, in addition to the two full-size outside pockets, which are zippered. And the zippers appear to be sufficiently strong, although only time will tell if they are durable. All things considered, including its compact size and adjustable shoulder strap, this bag is acceptable. I'll keep it and use it, even though there's nothing particularly special about it."
3.0,"The case does hold a Stadia controller, however, it is not as perfect as it seems. The mesh pocket inside proves to be a problem. Even with nothing in it, the pocket presses down on the joysticks. If you put anything in the pocket, this problem because exponentially worse. When storing, I have resorted to putting cables an adapters below the controller, which it has just enough space to fit. The pocket is essentially useless, and I am debating cutting it out altogether."
3.0,"It's ok, but don't fit me as expected. The lining of the dress was too short for the size."
3.0,"The shade at the handle is more purple than the pic. If fits my small frame face and looks nice, its just a bit flimsy."
3.0,This fit as expected but I'm not that into the fabric. It's not that soft and feels more like a light weight canvas type. It seems well made and there are no issues with the stitching.
3.0,Disappointed in the sizing.  If you were a 2X you better purchase a 5X.  The 2X looked more llike an XL.
3.0,"I make purse charms, zipper pulls and key chains.  These inspirational charms are the right size and sturdy.  However, the package says 40 charms and there were only 36.  Note to supplier...please check your quality control measures and be sure the customer is getting what they pay for,"
3.0,I didn't like the zipper design.
3.0,They are pretty small they don't go around my wrist. They are very beautiful
3.0,"nice fabric, colors, texture, ideal for fall or spring time, the only problem is that i bought a S for small and delivered an L for Large. I'm abroad of the country and the cost of sendig the shirt is bigger than the price of the item so i will try to adapt it. It's a shame that for a silly mistake or not paying adeccuate attention at the time of shipping the item the quality of the service falls down and i can only give 3 stars"
3.0,Will be wearing these too bed. Very cute. I am normally a med and bought a large in case and they still are a little small for the look I wanted. Very soft so I will just wear them as pj pants for the price.
3.0,"Check the size of your ring carefully before purchasing this. If you have a small ring with a thin band, this will work well. Impossible on medium to chunky ring bands."
3.0,Fits a bit big in the toe box of the shoe but was delivered on time
3.0,Daughter loves the shirt except it does RUN small.  I bought it for Christmas and I doubt by summer it will be comfortable enough to wear.  If you purchase I would buy atleast one size bigger.
3.0,The material is heavy and I really disliked the shade of red. I had hoped it would be like the pic but it was a bright orangey red.
3.0,A little dark for night vision
3.0,"much tinier than I thought, can barely hold them with arthritic hands"
3.0,"I got a larger size but even though I'm taller than average, the large size was much too long even in heels."
3.0,"Cute, just a little shorter than I perfer and I ordered a 9 and most of the time I am 8/12 but I'm keeping them anyway."
3.0,Top is snug but wearable but the bottom is not even close to being able to fit...we had to order a bottom from elsewhere
3.0,Not great if you have big hips. Fit top half perfectly but tight on hips and butt. Also longer than photo
3.0,Size 7/8 was more like a size 4/5. Had a small red spot on the dress. But the 2 yr size i also bought was great!
3.0,"I'll give you 3 star,nice lace,but big for me part under arm,so look no good for me,"
3.0,"My husband comfortably wears 18.5 neck, 34/35 slim fit shirts. This shirt was too tight in the neck and just slightly short in the sleeves. Sending it back."
3.0,I followed the measurement guide exactly and the skirt came in too big! It told me to order a 2x but i clearly should have just ordered an xl. Nice looking but a little thin. Will be returning
3.0,"We ended up returning this because even though I ordered my son's usual size, it was way too small.  So I can't really rate the quality."
3.0,"Sweatshirt is nice and soft.  Fits a little loose like I wanted. The one issue I had is that the sweatshirt arrived with a security ink tag on it.  I got my package on a Saturday, called customer service and I'm guessing that no one was in but there automated answering system did not notify me and I sat on hold for 15 minutes before giving up.  Since it showed up on the Saturday before Christmas, I figured removing my tag the self was the best option so I don't know how they would have handled it.  The fact that it wasn't properly checked before shipping makes me reconsider this seller next time I decide to buy my sports fan gear."
3.0,The color is lighter and it was too large
3.0,I found this to be shaped wide and short and very unflattering. Returned it.
3.0,It fits my daughter well but quality not as great.
3.0,"I love the color and the size,  have received several complements on the watch band, but it seems to not be able to sit in the middle of my wrist where I want it.  It always slides away from me."
3.0,"Darker than they appear in photo. They run small, I usually wear and 91/2 or 10 but a 101/2 or 11 might have been better. Quality still seems ok but not their best work."
3.0,The band is nice material but if you have the slightest OCD you’ll hate it. The designs do not face in the same direction. Each side of the band faces in a different direction once on your wrist.
3.0,Ordered according to specs on site and these were WAY TOO TIGHT&#62;  Cant even get them on.
3.0,It's ok just longer than I thought
3.0,"I usually love pockets, but in this dress they just made me look larger. Also the back was too long, even for a high-low."
3.0,Demasiado grande para ser talla pequeña
3.0,"I was expecting these clips to hold the charms on my Pandora bracelet in place but they didn't, they just made it so the charms won't fall off the bracelet when i take it off my wrist."
3.0,"I bought this as a fashion ring for my middle finger. Just wanted something nice to look at while I’m at work or typing on the computer. It’s very pretty but gets dirty easily so clean often. I have all cheaper sterling silver rings on my other fingers and this is the only one that turned my finger green, so I’d recommend coating it in clear nail polish before wearing. Obviously take off before getting your hands wet or sleeping"
3.0,"Only one was as pictured. The other one, which was my reason for ordering them, should have been American flag. Instead it was American flag with July 4th written across the face real big.<br />I didn’t want that! July 4th was over. I just wanted what I ordered so I was disappointed. As far as the fit. For my average sized 7year old grandson, they fit ok. Not sure they’d work for anyone over 8. When he inhaled the material would smash against his face. Not comfortable when that happens. He can wet them and wear them as do rags when it’s hot outside to help keep cool so I kept them."
3.0,Just not crazy about the color an I think it looks different than I expected but it is made well and if you like like flowers you will like it
3.0,"Overall quality is quite good.  Fabric is nice, with a medium weight melton about equivalent to your average cromby, the stitching is even, really no complaints there.  The only problem is that it's quite clearly designed for smaller-framed wearers.  I normally take an XL or 45 in US sizing, so I ordered this in &#34;US XL/Asian XXXL.&#34;  It's way too tight across the back/shoulders, to the point that it's difficult to reach my arms forward without risking tears.  The front is roomy enough though.  The armholes are high, which generally would be fine although most Americans won't be accustomed to it, but more problematic is that the sleeves are also quite tight-fitting.  Definitely not for weight-lifters!"
3.0,Pricing was high but needed wide shoes for my child.  They are ok.
3.0,Smells like fish
3.0,Hmm ok so I was so excited to buy these. The picture shows two. And I received one in a small package lol.. I was so confused and thrown off...??! Why would it be sold individually??? Weird.. anyways good product but shipping took a while and now I have to pay more for another..ONE  single GAUGE and wait again... bummer
3.0,"I got this dress in a size small. I'm typically a small. This dress was big on me. For size, I'm 5'2 and 120 lbs. It arrived with what looked like deoderant streaks and I'm hoping that it's stretched from someone else wearing it. I will try to wash it and hopefully it will shrink. The dress looks like a slip you wear under other dresses. I feel like it should say slip because that's what the material feels like. The good thing about is that I'm able to wear a regular bra. The straps dont have to be thin  because these straps are a little wide."
3.0,This is clearly meant for a child. My 11 year old fits the extra large and she's pretty small. Cute suit though.
3.0,"Cute shirt, but like any little girl or womens clothing the manufacturers make them to form fitting."
3.0,stretchy and useful doesn't feel any different from of the tube bandanas I own.The design seems solid. my only gripe is the price is too high
3.0,"I ordered a small and it was still a little loose, granted I like my clothes fitted so that could be on you on what you like your clothes to fit like."
3.0,Great looking socks buy I can't really rate effectiveness as they run large. I selected Medium and they are very loose fitting on my foot. I am a women's 9 1/2 with fairly wide feet. Trying a Small next.
3.0,I am so disappointed with this necklace set. it looks a bit cheap
3.0,"I received the boots quickly and wore the boots immediately , good warmth and waterproofing . Downgrading overall quality due to laces that are defective . Lace has separated in it's core and is unraveling from it's inside."
3.0,"This is a good looking band, but the two band retainers keep slipping off the end of the band that has the holes. This lets the unused portion of the band flop around. I considered pinching the band retainers to hold them tighter to the band, but that would make it difficult to place the band end under the retainers and to remove it. I ended up taping the underside of band retainers to the band. This is hardly an elegant solution for an elegant watch band.<br /><br />If you have a large wrist, you probably won't have this problem."
3.0,Ran wayyy too small
3.0,"ok quality, way too big"
3.0,Very thin you can feel air come through but comfortable
3.0,Product is cheaply made. Stitching is loose and not worth the $150 asking price. The shoe is light weight and comfortable. I just hope it lasts everyday use.
3.0,My arms felt too tight. The fabric is warm but it’s those that expand easily. Not good quality
3.0,"nice, soft, and true to size however the zipper is horrible. Its rough and sharp and very difficult to zip."
3.0,"i purchased a medium that fit my daughter perfect like the Many other medium coatslike this style she owns. I have Many coats like this so i ordered a large, could not zip over boobs and there Not that big. So i ordered a XL and it fit Fitted. They were purchased for trophy coats so i did not have time to look for another brand to fit correctly. None the less the material is very nice."
3.0,Great fun vibrant pattern.  The sizing is way off.  The XL fit like Mediums.  Fortunately they are stretchy.  Kept one package and gave the other to a friend who is smaller.
3.0,"This is a cute pajama set.  It fits a little more snugly than I had expected, but is still comfortable to wear, and I love the pockets.  More worrisome, one of the shoulder seams was sewn after the neckline was finished, which is not at all the way it's supposed to be done.<br /><br />I had thought from the description that it was all cotton, but it doesn't feel at all like cotton to me, it feels like a synthetic.  Since I'm into fibercrafts in too big a way, it immediately occurred to me to do a burn test, and I was able to find enough material in both the top and the bottom, which are made with different fabrics with the same construction (and identical dye), to test both.  They may not look or feel like cotton, but they are.  They do not melt, but leave a fine ash.<br /><br />So, my review, and conclusions are mixed.  I'm usually one of the world's twitchiest sleepers, but the shoulder finishing wasn't even an issue for me when going to sleep.  The fabric is comfortable even in hot weather, when a cotton knit can feel too clingy.  However, that major construction error is a issue.  I might not mind it for sleeping, but I certainly wouldn't gift it to anyone, and if I found it in an item in a store, I wouldn't buy it.<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading my review.  If you found it helpful, I’d appreciate your clicking the button below."
3.0,Set tight fitting.
3.0,"They were pretty good stuff and everything, on the hanging pictures, one of the pictures had a tear on it, it did make me sad. The scroll did look photoshopped and basically has edits on it instead of an actual photoshoot. And the posters, some were really good but there was a couple that were a bit photoshopped and edits as well. But they were still an alright giftset. Just a couple things to keep in mind next time."
3.0,Good quality and weight
3.0,"This is my first waist trainer, the first week I had it the fabric tore. It still works for what I got it for. Would recommend this for a beginner."
3.0,difficult to get cards in slots
3.0,order a size up as this runs very small but it's super cute I returned the first one cause it was very small and ordered 1 or 2 sizes up I can't remember BUT they run really small
3.0,"Sadly disappointed in this product. The material is quite cheap & there was a giant hold in the front seam, right by my stomach. Will not be buying this again."
3.0,"Good- looks great, fits well<br />Bad- excess strap comes loose, don’t like the double lug"
3.0,I'm a 44DDD  and 5' 2&#34;.<br />I ordered the 2x and it's extremely loose and kinda long. Fabric is decent. Decal hasn't come off yet.
3.0,"The pattern on these is adorable but the socks have no heel and they're very small. They can stretch a lot to fit larger feet but the stitches stretch apart as well and then the socks become see-through and lose softness, while the pattern distorts. Without stretching, the socks look exactly the size of kids' socks.<br /><br />These socks are made of printed polyester, not a cotton blend with knitted-in designs like most novelty socks."
3.0,"I bought these because I'm wearing a tennis elbow brace on my right arm and my forearm was getting cold, with my sleeve pushed up. What I wanted were very basic, lightweight knit arm warmers, and that is what I received. The two are ambi-fitting, which is great for my particular use (when one wears out/unravels, I'll use the other one). For the price, it's about what I expected, inclusive of the thumb holes in both arm warmers unraveling a little, even in the packaging. I snipped off the thread and it doesn't seem to be any worse for the wear.<br /><br />A word of caution: Velcro will WRECK these. So keep that in mind if you're wearing them around coats, bags, etc."
3.0,It draws up after washing
3.0,Love them. Beautiful. I love danglys so dangly gauges I was in love!<br />Only thing is I don’t see anywhere saying that they’re twist apart back and front. I didn’t know this and almost blew out my ear trying to get it out until I figure out you could unscrew it. You should probably add that to the description so someone doesn’t pull a me and almost wreck their ears.
3.0,Just a little too small. A little weight loss will help.
3.0,"I usually wear a size M top, but this one is a little smaller for me and the color is a bit duller than in the photo. I gave it to my mother and she loves it! :-)"
3.0,It's good but I can find others with the same quality cheaper than this
3.0,I have many pairs of Gloria Vanderbilt Ananda shorts. This pair runs very short - at least 1.5” shorter than my other pairs in the same size I returned. Which is a shame because I loved the color/pattern.
3.0,"Ok, this style was not right for my sliding door though because I am drawing it back and forth a lot and the rings stick. Would be ok for stationary application."
3.0,"It's nice and helped me be warm from the door of the hotel down to the car...just enough warmth for the occasion and for what I needed it, however, the workmanship does not seem to be very good. You can see the part where the material from where the faux fur and the shawl fabric were attached or stitched together. The fur should have gone or placed in the middle to where the top of the fur/hair covers the stitching material. Hope this makes sense..."
3.0,It is okay for the money.
3.0,"My leather strap Type 8139 (Water resistant) has just arrived.<br />Delivery a bit longer than expected.<br />Initial appearance is quite good it does not look too flashy or &#34;Chinese cheap&#34;.<br />The price was under USD10 but can't remember exact cost.<br />Dial is light-grey/white (with a crystaline appearance), case is dull black, back is stainless.<br />The strap is med brown & stiff; marked &#34;genuine leather&#34;, I can't be sure if it is or not.<br />I have relatively small wrists & the strap was ideal in length for me, it would be too short for many larger wristed men.<br />To be honest I soon discovered that getting the strap on & off was a pain, my fault; I should have selected a different type of band.<br />Wife says it will loosen up & she knows these things.<br /><br />I was disappointed to find the winding/time adjust crown somewhat loose - there is noticeable wiggle & this is avoidable so black mark there!<br />This probably indicates that it is not water resistant to any extent so I think I will need to remove just to wash hands - bugger!<br /><br />I don't know the quality of the quartz movement but assume it's basic cheap Chinese so it should last a couple of years & if it does I will be happy.<br />My overall assessment of an as yet barely tested watch is; it looks fine, & it's different, probably will keep good time (not cronometer standard), & the strap will probably annoy me daily."
3.0,"First, it took almost two weeks to receive this Prime 2 day item. Second, I'm having a difficult time separating the plastic strip from the adhesive without destroying the foam lining. Once the plastic strip is off it does the job it's intended to do."
3.0,It’s a cool shirt but to small and the hood is hard to get on. I ordered my normally 2t/3t toddler a 4t and it was still too small.
3.0,Muy pequeña la talla pero la tela está bien
3.0,"Yes, it's true what the others are saying, fabric is cheap and on the shinier side... and it does run small. I'm petite, 4'11 with broader shoulders than most my size, got a medium and it fit perfectly. It's A-okay for a few uses... I bought this for a funeral.  Don't expect to keep this in your closet long-term."
3.0,"I used it for a costume, and it was fine for that purpose, but it was really too small.  Good for an inexpensive costume prop, but otherwise, I wouldn't buy this."
3.0,Looks cheap.  The exterior has a printed appearance. It has a plastic chemical odor.
3.0,"The color is boring... not beige, not yellow, just blah<br />It fits okay... I have large hips and ordered a larger size then it's too big in the shoulders.. I wouldn't look for another"
3.0,Great for one product for night. don't plan on using them a few times.
3.0,Cufflinks were a little too heavyñ but nice
3.0,"So, I bought these leggings in both a M and a L. I pulled the M out and they looked TINY. I tried both on and they are both tight but the L seems to give off more camel toe than the M. Which is strange. I like the M but there are a couple downsides. The leggings are not full length. More like 7/8. Also I wanted to give them the go round at the gym before I reviewed. They aren’t really sweat proof. I mean it wasn’t awful, but I stopped at less than 2 miles and I usually go 3.5 because I didn’t want it to get worse. More like a darker tinge on the crotch sweat regions. I also bought the shorts. I’m not sure if I’m going to keep them yet because the M is way to tight around the legs and I’m scared the L will have the weird crotch fit. So, I’m in between on these leggings."
3.0,"Very basic shoe. No frills, but they do what they are made for and priced accordingly."
3.0,the product was just ok over priced
3.0,"My son is between sizes or the sizes are off. The small is too tight and the medium doesn’t have as much compression in the upper chest area.  The material starts to look very worn once washed a few times, I even washed alone and hung to dry. For the price, I wished there was a little bit more life to them.  My son needs these during school and therapy activities so I guess I will have to continue to replace more often than I would like."
3.0,"I bought this keeping in mind the price, so I knew it wouldn't be the best quality. The color is completely off, the rose looks cream in the picture and in person it is sun yellow. I do not wear yellow and will not wear this. The quality is as expected though, not the best, but good for the price"
3.0,"Oddly enough, although these are thicker than my other support hose, these are the FIRST pair to run!! I have such thin nude color and many colorful supp hose that are so sheer and light weight, they feel like pantyhose, BUT they last;  not a single run in any of them and I wash them in the washing machine. This brand is already falling apart ie runs, after wearing twice! I do not recommend these. Check out Celeste Stein for colorful hose. Of note: most of these One Size jobbys aren't for the super slim. They just won't provide much compression for skinnier calves."
3.0,"The straps are not long enough, and the criss cross part is not big enough. I ordered my normal size, and the top half was just too small. I'm not very tall, and have an average size bust, so I thought it would fit. It doesn't."
3.0,"I bought this backpack for my mom so she would be able to change from a tote to a backpack however, the straps were not very comfortable for a back pack, the purse itself has a lot of room and is super cute!"
3.0,Some of the rings were flawed but it came 16-30 days early. The bow ring is big enough to fit on my thumb and the rest of the rings fit where they should. Overall the purchase was decent because you get what you paid for and if you expected top quality stuff for this price? You're crazy. 3 out of 5 stars because it wasn't a buy that I hated and regretted but it wasn't one that I particularly loved to death either.
3.0,"Good for what it is... it’s fake jewelry but it looks “cool” it’s for my nine year old and is a practice piece... if he can take care of this (not loose it) ,  I’ll buy him a real chain."
3.0,I wear a size 8 1/2 and I order a 9 cause I read the reviews and seen that these run small and they still were a tad to small so a size 10 would have worked if I had the time to send back ..Also if you are worried because you have larger calves they did fit around my calves and mine are big but my foot slid forward when walking around the house in them so I knew these wouldn't work for me but they are just as pretty in person to bad I didn't wear them out!
3.0,The white band is okay
3.0,"I ordered a size 47.5, US 13.5, because that's my size in La Sportiva shoes (my US street shoe size is Men's 13). They put pressure on the outsides of my feet (e.g. pinky toes) and fit a little oddly. The width in the toe box was decent and the length was adequate. They weren't as uncomfortable as the Salomon Speedcross series shoes but were just not quite right. Maybe it's just my weird, flatter feet... I'm not sure."
3.0,"This set is beautiful! However, the post and earring backing are not stainless steel. My granddaughter loved them but they irritated her ears severely after 12 hours of wear. I kept them because she loves the necklace. She can only wear 100% stainless steel. These earrings must be a coating over some other metal."
3.0,The coat wasn’t bad but I returned it because the hood wasn’t quite big enough and the detachable fur was weird.
3.0,The dress was not well designed and a bit on the thin side.  I sent it back for a full refund without any problems.
3.0,Love the feel and look but too tight around arms (Size XL)
3.0,"It was fairly easy to put on and the fabric is nice and soft, but it did nothing for holding in my belly. My Spanx have twice the hold. The panty is cute and fit well, though you would have to take the whole thing off to use the restroom.<br /><br />I am 5'3 and usually wear a size 18."
3.0,My 12 year  old grandson loves it!
3.0,Not very sturdy construction and only for small wrists.
3.0,"I bought these for me and my husband, but I was pretty disappointed with the way they fit our bodies.  They didn't hug very well, hung low and revealed too much backside when we bent over, the padding was overly thick and dragged the shorts down and the waistline was scratchy.  We ended up returning them.  No problems with the seller though, they were very accommodating!"
3.0,"I knew the reviews on this dress were great before I purchased it, but I was hoping for the best. Unfortunately, I should have listened to what the other buyers were saying. I am 5’-8” 130lbs and this dress was too large for me in the chest (like didn’t for whatsoever) and the sleeves were too short. The color is true to what you see online and it’s very pretty."
3.0,Bright white/silver color so it looks fake. The latch in the back gets stuck but fixes with a little effort. Not bad for the price.
3.0,The necklace is as shown in the picture however the picture portrays the necklace to be better quality then it is in real life. Te chains are deffinatly cheaper and the small disk on the middle chain is very small and dainty. I say go for a better quality product even though this price is a good price.
3.0,Not true to size and it very thin. Photo looks better
3.0,"I read that the sizing was small so I ordered the largest they have. I normally wear a L/XL and while the costume fit, the sizing was weird with the top being too tight and the skirt being too loose. If you have a larger chest, I would recommend ordering up and altering the skirt later."
3.0,"First wash these gaiters before you wear them, I didn't and had a coughing fit within 15 minutes.  My doctor had to get me another mask...ooops.  There are 2 layers, so everytime I spoke I sucked in the material, really annoying.  I may run them through my sewing machine several times to prevent that.  I am adult, I don't think I have a big head,<br />(my kids would disagree), it was loose.  That wasn't horrible because of the ear loops, otherwise they would have slid down to my neck, like a scarf.<br />At the time of this review, the price is $13.99 and comes in different colors."
3.0,Beautiful dress unfortunately there’s a “half” flap in chest area under the dress which shows and makes it very unflattering
3.0,Not what I was expecting but I will make the best of it
3.0,"Stiff as a board! And feels like as rough as one too. Not comfy in the least, but it does fit."
3.0,"Made super small, very thin material.<br /> Get what you pay I guess"
3.0,"I love the look of this, but not 2 weeks after I had it, it fell apart."
3.0,the choker is attached to the body suit and it was too big so the choker hung baggy
3.0,"If you have any stomach at all... leftover baby pudge or ANY stomach, order your normal size. I have 3 of the long sleeve swing dresses made by HOTOUCH in an XL. They fit BEAUTIFULLY and make my leftover baby tummy disappear. I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered this dress in a Large and was very disappointed. I had planned to wear the dress today but the Large is so not flattering. The dress doesn't taper out much after the waist like most swing dresses so if you order your normal size it will cling and be fitted in the waist. An XL would have provided me just enough looseness. I'm 6'0 and normally wear 16,18, and XL in dresses. This is a VERY PRETTY dress and the fabric is summertime thin (not see-through, but not heavy... JUST thick enough to be opaque if it's not clinging). The red color is so vibrant. I was so excited when I took it out of the package because I just knew I was about to SLAY. Order your normal size."
3.0,The dress fit amazing- looks really good. I was upset the color looked nothing like the picture. I got it for a costume that I needed to be gold (I got the dark gold) it looked like a black dress with orange sparkles... Not gold at all.
3.0,"Looked cute, but pretty stiff, A few feathers came out throughout the day, but not terrible.<br />Definitely just a one time wear and throw away"
3.0,"I liked the look of the dress, but the size runs very small"
3.0,Doesn't hold good after two washes
3.0,"Shirts more polyester than cotton,colors also a bit louder then I would like.Although the tag says Italy,shirts are made in Pakistan.Not for someone young,or the hipster crowd."
3.0,way cuter in the pics... somehow unflattering in the chest area...challenging to put on...and buttons remind me of 90's dresses without fully committing to the 90's style that hath returned...it confused me
3.0,Will wear it but only under another top.
3.0,"I got the L/XL because I wear a women’s size 8.5 and my calves are part of what’s swelling, but they’re not as tight as I was expecting. They do look like nice dress socks for work though so not terrible enough to return, but if you’re on the borderline for sizing, it might be worth sizing down."
3.0,The bangs fall apart every other movement...
3.0,"One size fits all really does not apply to this item.  I find it to be<br />a bit tight around the abdominal area.  Would have liked to be<br />able to have one size larger for a more comfortable fit.  Colorful<br />and very pretty design,  however."
3.0,The band is very pretty and actually quite comfortable but the magnets that close the watch are not quiet strong enough and it pops apart sometimes
3.0,THEY DONT HOLD UP
3.0,So these run a bit small. Not bad. Just not great. Polo stuff never sucks. These are just ok.
3.0,"The build quality was good, but the loop that holds the quick connect part was to fat to fit almost all my 22mm watches."
3.0,"Good price, but unravel quick .."
3.0,"These are fairly warm, but they were pretty sloppily made. Like someone else stated, my thumbs hit right at the slit so are always exposed. The velcro isn't real secure for those times when you need your fingers exposed. The knitting is starting to ravel. I am glad I have them, but I will looking for a better pair for next winter."
3.0,"on the small side, fabric is very thin but very soft. It is short on me at 5' 4&#34; but great to wear around the house and it has a pocket for my phone."
3.0,For the price... you're getting what you pay for. Extremely light and thin material.
3.0,Love the weight feel and easy to breathe.  Have it a 3 because it falls off my face....there is nothing to hold it up
3.0,"Much bigger than I anticipated. Weird, slinky material."
3.0,I put foot pads with arch supports in them...they lasted only one season but I did wear them a lot!
3.0,"These shorts were comfy, but were way too tight up top. The belly band over the bump part was too tight and seem to be a smaller size than the shorts. Will probably fit better when there’s no baby bump and I have some curve back other than round. I am usually maternity size 16. Would be great on non-pregnant pear shaped person"
3.0,I was hoping to wear this with leggings but it's not quite long enough. The photo makes it look tunic length but I'm only 5'3&#34; and it still isn't long enough. Other than that it's cute.
3.0,"Watch is beautiful and sparkles however is broken and it needs a battery. I would like this watch and therefore, will try to get it replaced with a working battery so I can wear it. If that doesn't work then I will return."
3.0,Looks a lot like the picture. Wife will be putting the actual key on a different chain. The chain itself seems pretty cheap.
3.0,"The material is thick it’s a very nice dress but not the material i was hoping for , for the summer . To me i got an xl and left like a large fit me but not as loose as i wanted it to be if it was a normal xl. But still very nice dress"
3.0,Good summer blazer.  Looks cheap but works for hot Summers if you need to look somewhat professional.
3.0,Thin. Material could be better quality. But cute and great for hot summer
3.0,"Material was fine but Amazon suggested to get large I got it but it's too large for me, not at all flattering I am returning it."
3.0,"not high quality, thin material but it works for Halloween"
3.0,"I was back and forth on giving these a 3 or 4 star review.<br />Pros: All around, these sunglasses are bigger than any pair I've ever really bought with this kind of plastic frame. I have a large head, and it is good to finally have a pair of sunglasses that I don't have to rely on streching out before they are finally comfortable. I can imagine this would be a con to someone who has a smaller head though. The frames are oversized and I love it. They have a fancy-walk down Times Square kind of feel, but again, I have a large head and large face. I know that someone with a smaller head would get taken over by these sunglasses. The large lens also is nice because it gives more of a chance to block out the sun; however, that leads me to the list of cons.<br />Cons: Firstly, in the advertisement picture, there is a small little white writing across the top of one of the lenses. I was expecting this to be almost unreadable due to how small it looks in the picture; however, it is very easy to see in real life. I saw it when I was taking a selfie and had to take them off because I couldn't figure out what was on my glasses. Additionally, the picture description says these are polarized, and I don't know how to test it for sure, but I do not think these are polarized. It felt like I just had a black screen over my eyes. I didn't really feel any protection or polarization from them.<br /><br />So for those reasons, I decided to give it three stars because I don't think they are worth the price. They have a strong plastic, and they have a great style, but I don't think they are what they are advertised. If they were cheaper, I would probably recommend, but for this price, I don't think I would."
3.0,The torso is short and fits a bit too high.
3.0,the style is nice buy its a very thin would prefer if it was lined
3.0,"Looks great, but its hard plastic so if your nose is large, you may want something more flexible."
3.0,Got the larger size and it is not at all the size they showed. Way smaller but pretty cute. I easily pulled the silver part off so I can put it another leather necklace but if you plan on keeping it on the original necklace be careful cause it comes off easily.
3.0,"Well made, but the green was too bright--not a true olive drab or army green, and although I liked the red and white in the center stripe, they were bright too and my son thought it looked like a candy cane. I thought about dyeing them in some tea or coffee to tone them down, but didn't and just returned them instead of possibly ruining them."
3.0,This ran small.  I donated it to goodwill
3.0,"Was not as red as the picture, more on the orange side. Returned due to not liking the color, but other than that it was a very soft material"
3.0,Okay but the material is cheap. I guess for the price it's reasonable
3.0,OK for the price. Wish it was larger.
3.0,I choose 3 stars because it was nice but a little too small for an average size 4 year old who wears a 4-5
3.0,Blackens
3.0,"The frame has a very cute shape, but the leg need some extra length for my head. It may fit mostly woman face, if you are a narrow head men you could go for it."
3.0,I give it a three because they look very nice and I love the color but it doesnt help out with the eyes.
3.0,"It did get the point across and it made me look like Omni man, but it needs to be far more roomy. The gloves were also a bust; they do not feel good at all. I had to compensate for them by cutting off the tips of the index finger and thumb and buying some other red spandex gloves."
3.0,Runs on the small side. Cute shirt to wear on Halloween. Not a high quality shirt.
3.0,"I like it. But I don't believe the entire thing is silver. There is a small tag hanging on it that is stamped, but the usual places for the bracelet itself to be stamped is not stamped."
3.0,"Nice, but do not seem like will last long.  They are slightly big on my daughter (4 year old 8.5 toddler shoes).  All colors are “sparklely” so do not expect solids without silver shimmer.  I notice when putting on my daughter they get very thin over her big toe - and remember these are a little big on her.  I would imagine a child with larger feet, they will only get a few wears before they tear.  They are decent quality, just probably not big enough.  On my daughter the top goes almost to her ankle - so they are not “hidden” like the footies I wear.  She likes them, they work with her tap shoes and other slip on shoes."
3.0,It's way too big through the bust and hung down too low in that area. I decided to shorten the straps to get it to fit correctly.
3.0,"I'm a large in all shirts, I like button up shirts to be an XL. This XL I recieved would barely get over my shoulders and wasnt close to buttoning up. Way to small."
3.0,"I really like this necklace but after two times wearing it, the center metal design piece fell off.  Discovered it was only set with a thin layer of glue. Since I like this necklace, I will try gluing it back and cross my fingers the piece stays  for a while  longer."
3.0,This was not as described the material was very thin and not like the picture at all.😔
3.0,these are beautiful but break REALLY EASY. You get what you pay for and this product is a prime example. I bought three and all three only lasted five days of normal wear.
3.0,Super long...I’m 5’3” so that’s not saying much. Had to return.
3.0,Great material... but I weigh 140 5’4 and I had to pull them up all day long.
3.0,"I would buy a bunch of these, if the sleeves were longer.  My arms get cold at the elbow even when the rest of me is hot.  I like thin fabric, but I need some of that thin fabric on my arm at the elbow. Too bad."
3.0,They run a bit small. Very thin material I though my toes were going to go through the end. I suspect they won't last long. The binding along the edge cuts into your skin. They do however stay up.
3.0,Sequins keep falling off & this makes it easier for baby girl to put in mouth.
3.0,I love the dress it wasn’t small it was a lil tight around my arms
3.0,"Es vestido es lindo, pero es demasiado pequeño, no le quedó a mi amiga  :("
3.0,It's fine for what I'm using it for. The lace is falling off the bottom but it didn't bother me because I didn't really care for the lace.
3.0,If your ankles are not super skinny don't buy
3.0,"tried to contact you and let you know that it was not quite the one I was looking for , very difficult to contact a person .  finally gave up and kept the sword"
3.0,This is NOT an infinity scarf!
3.0,"It's a snug fit, so what ever your regular size is, you should probably go up a size if you don't like the tightness. But it's a gorgeous dress, I love it."
3.0,The cooling effect is noticeable and a welcome relief from the Bermuda sun when I am cycling and playing golf. The orange was not as vibrant as I wanted as it does not match my golf shirts or cycling kits but they do provide the protection I was expecting.
3.0,First let me say that the color is NOT black.  It is a dark gray.  They are so comfortable and really cute.  Just know that they are NOT black.
3.0,Gift for my husband. The color is very dark and only see flashes of red in bright lights. A bit disappointed. The cufflinks themselves are well made.
3.0,Very cute sports bra. However even XL is  tighter in some of these sports bras in  bust area. This one in particular. To has black stains or running of blk on inside of white spots of black. I could of worn XXL in this one. Would like to exchange as one of Favorite colors combo yet non removable pads to xl tight. Need XXL
3.0,Average.  As described.  The leather was stiff on arrival but softened with wear.  The padding in between the top and bottom layers make the band a little thick.  The quick release bands made installation easy.  It looks like it'll hold up well and feels solid.  Good for the price.
3.0,Love the picture of it... however the crotch is low so my thighs rub together. If I pull it up it looks like I'm waiting for a flood and then it’s too big around my stomach. The material is very wrinkly as well.
3.0,I was not a huge fan of how these fit.<br />The material was soft but it was a little baggy around my rump and around the whole top/waistband area in general. I feel that it made the fitted legs look foolish - like it was too baggy on top and too tight on the bottom! It couldn't make up its mind and I did not like the way they looked on me.<br />The colors were fabulous! I loved everything except the way it fit and that is kind of a big deal.
3.0,Didn't like product however had an easy process returning item
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about the dress.  On one hand it is SUPER comfy and light, on the other hand it might not be the best dress for someone with an ample bosom (ordered the XXL).  The waistband of the dress sits right up underneath mine, giving the appearance of a maternity dress.  The offers of people wanting to give their seats up to me was appreciated, but not necessary. :-) I've been wearing it with a denim jacket over it to help minimize my &#34;baby bump.&#34;"
3.0,"You get what you paid for.Bought 6 packs regular and 6 packs Capri. They are same material and quality. Smell bad,but will go better with time. Material is like a tights, not leggings. Actually light colors looks like thighs, dark colors more like leggings. Basic stuff,cheap. Decided to keep regular leggings and return Capri.  Otherwise will be huge amount of cheap stuff at home. At least regular I hope I can use more often. Keeping them only because they are $5 each and colors are nice."
3.0,NEEDS TO HAVE BETTER DESCRIPTION OF HOW BIG THEY ARE.  THESE ARE SMALL ON MY HEAD (DIG INTO MY HEAD ON THE SIDES)
3.0,"Not as pretty as the photograph and I didn't find them to be a HD quality. They are just a sunglass, at a very cheap price."
3.0,"Love the pink boxer concept to beat cancer, but the chain is not good quality."
3.0,A little smaller than I expected. Nice fit. Feel like they won’t last long though. Feel a little flimsy when they are folded.
3.0,"Good bag , very roomy for my use"
3.0,I expected the shorts to be a two or three inches longer. But the top fits nicely.
3.0,This shirt is decent quality but not quite what I was hoping for.  I was hoping it would have been a much lighter weight and a bit nicer.
3.0,"These are a nice, lightweight top to wear around the house/yard during the summer.  They will be great under a button down when the weather gets cooler too.  The fabric is thin and they do run small.  I normally wear a small or medium.  I ordered the medium but could have used the large.  These are still wearable, but large would have been better.  The armholes are small so that is where the large would be better."
3.0,not flattering at all looked like a pilgrim or like i belonged in little house on a prairie
3.0,"The gloves were not as warm as expected.  Also, a little too large which made texting impossible."
3.0,"The comfy fit was just what I wanted but I think I'll return it due to the fabric. I ordered the green and the fabric didn't have the ""worn out"" look I wanted. Instead, it was more of a manufactured, fake look. From a distance, it's probably ok but up close it seemed to cheap."
3.0,"Beautiful necklace, but it twisted/tangled 1000 times throughout the day! I got frustrated after wearing for about 5 hours. Not pleased."
3.0,Quality is not as good as I would have liked to expect.  Fabric is thin and cheap and the lettering has leaked through to the underside of the fabric.
3.0,Smaller than expected.  Material is very heavy.
3.0,Very small and even with elastic adjusted out to end still tight.  I am not an overly large person either.  Does have metal over nose which is nice.  Fabric is smooth and comfortable.
3.0,"The “JPL” is rather thin and matted, but the hat quality is good."
3.0,"It is pretty, but definately a $3 ring. There is no way it is Sterling Silver as advertised."
3.0,"I am 5'5"" and almost always wear a medium. This medium fit like a large.  Not fitted and more thin than expected.  Nice color (Pink).  Returned."
3.0,Too hot for beach days. Wore once. Cute but not for really hot weather. Fabric doesn't breathe.
3.0,The price was good and they are really cute but some were defective. One pair fell apart.  Some don't have clean cuts.  The green ones turn backwards so you only see the glitter.
3.0,"These socks are very cute.  They seem to run a tad small, especially around the ankles.  They also do not wash wonderfully.  I have washed them twice and they are already pilling.  I never can understand why this happens to some socks, but not others washed at the same time."
3.0,"Pretty, not the best quality"
3.0,"Great support wise, at least for medium size chest. The color was not quite as expected, and i don't like how the cup inserts are visible through the top. Decent overall though."
3.0,The quality was fair . I would probably not purchase this item again because it was way too high in the back for a Comic-Con Event . Even with leggings this costume was banned from my local Comic-Con
3.0,"This a gorgeous piece seemed sturdy with thick material and stiff (steel?) boning. The elastic in the back of the straps was a nice touch, but slipped a lot (would probably work if I had a larger size, which is not available or made, currently.) I purchased this corset initially because of the flared hips, which I haven't seen anywhere else on Amazon. The lilac color embroidery was a lovely touch.<br />Sadly, this confection, which I purchased in a 2X (largest size) per the measurements provided, is not meant for a curvy plus size person. Nothing my husband and I did made it look good and I could not get my breasts (42DDD) to ""work"" without looking ridiculous.<br />I would very much love to purchase this if it was made larger. Please make it larger!"
3.0,the dress looks good but the material is obviously cheap.  It could look better if you wear a full slip or if it were lined. I would have kept it except that the (yellow) color is way too bright.
3.0,"Would be cute, but the leg holes are HUGE and have a diaper look. I had to try a lot of different things to make this work (like safety pinning the legs to make them smaller), and even now it still fits awkwardly. Top and back are cute though."
3.0,They are very cute and look well made...but the posts are just too short :( I already lost the back to one and the posts are so tiny that I can't get any of my other earring backs to work
3.0,Good quality but I wish they were anti glare
3.0,"Bought these for my brother. They are way too tight on the toes. Ended up cutting the toes off. So far no benefit from the ""copper"", but work well for leg compression."
3.0,"tried to use to flt but light still came in , did like the fit tho"
3.0,Material looks cheaper in person
3.0,"These glasses are very convenient while they last. Unfortunately, because you have to pull them open and let them snap shut to use them, they don't last very long. They are made like so much from China, cheaply and poorly. But then again, they didn't cost much."
3.0,"This bag is really cute, love the Teal color and the was so happy and surprised to find it comes with and extra cross body strap that is much narrower and solid teal (maybe I missed it in the details).  It a good size holds all my stuff but the front flap is a bit stiff and so is the back pocket.  The front flap slaps shut every time I open it to look for something inside and I find the pocket in the back useless.  Not big enough for my cell phone and wouldn't want to chance car keys in it since it an open pocket.  But it really is a cute bag and I'm keeping it."
3.0,Not as well made as it should be. Tears easily
3.0,My daughter loves Groot and she thought this was so cute. She had it on for 2-3 hours and the chain broke. Now she can't even wear it.
3.0,"It's very attractive, but I mistakenly thought that it would fit a Galaxy Active 2 in 40mm since it said 38/40mm.  It will not.  It is too large, even with the adapter taken out.  You will need a tool in order to push the pin out to install it which was not provided.  I wish it would have worked though, it looks attractive."
3.0,Nice shirt but sizes quite inconsistent.  I ordered 6 and each one is a bit different in size.  Black most consistent to the point where I would need a larger size in that color.
3.0,Way flimsier than I expected. And almost too small. Would not purchase them again nor recommend to anyone...
3.0,"The material the dress is made out of hugs your body.  For someone who doesn't like super fitted clothes, this would be a little too much."
3.0,Love maxi dresses I can lounge in. This one is perfect the only thing is washing it shrunk the length and the chest area a little too small for my bust size. Over all still love!
3.0,These are cute. No fault of the manufacturer but they were way too wide for my daughter's foot. She has a narrow foot and it slipped right off her when walking.
3.0,My son bought this for his girlfriend. The stone is small but very colorful. She loved it.
3.0,They scratch way to easily
3.0,"I wish I ordered a size up, I’m always a small and sometimes an extra small but this is almost too small for me. Also looks cheap."
3.0,The left glove is almost impossible to get on. The lining is twisted so bad and sewn twisted that you can't get fingers through. Easier to get a calf out of a twisted uterus in a cow.
3.0,Miserable my feel scream putting these on but they are sexy as hell!
3.0,"definitely not flattering for those with more in the midsection, otherwise, it's very nice quality and super cute...I might save it for when I lose some weight in that area, lol"
3.0,Too large for small size
3.0,"feet dont stay on the rubber sole, we end up taking them off"
3.0,Nice product loved the fit
3.0,Looks exactly like the pic but really not impressed... pricey and wasn’t packaged nicely.  Was squished in a plastic bag.
3.0,The shoes run extremely small and I’ve processed a return. I’m usually 6 and a half and it seems like I would need a whole size instead. The shoes are pretty but I don’t believe I’ll reorder. They’re stiff around the toe area and most likely would hurt my feet if I end up trying to wear them for several hours.
3.0,The shirt had a strong chemical smell when I opened the package. Had to wash first. Fit is a tad small. Not too bad though.
3.0,Nice looking for the money.
3.0,"Fits like a beanie and not at all slouchy, but it is warm. Nicely made."
3.0,"It would be nice to offer coordinating children sizing based on the ""fishing buddy"" emblem."
3.0,"They are both really cute, but one was bigger than the other."
3.0,design is low on shirt
3.0,"This would work as a swimsuit coverup.  It is one size fits all.  I'm a big woman so it's snug on me.  It allows a lot of cooling breezes to blow thru and that's a good thing, especially in the summer months.<br />I thinks it's a little pricey for what it is.<br />Because it's black it will match anything.<br />Machine washable and easy care."
3.0,"I liked this necklace.  However, the stones are much lighter in person.  I thought it would be more vibrant."
3.0,"I would order a bigger size because this shrink quite a bit in the washer. The shirt shank, the pants stayed the same."
3.0,"Very cute, my 3 year old loves it. However it’s smaller then I expected. He’ll only be able to wear for 1 season instead of this fall too."
3.0,Survival braclet is good. But the cable bracelet doesent clip together at all.
3.0,"they do run a lil bit small, buth they fulfill the task."
3.0,they work-cover everything<br />they are absolutely round<br />they are hard-no flexibility-somewhat uncomfortable at times<br />notice the pushup bump--won't work with bras that have a little pushup foam<br />the covering fabric is good<br />they wash in the washing machine<br />3 pairs
3.0,"This was a gift to my girl, she has yet to use them yet but she seem to like them from the initial unpackaging/checkout. The case for the goggles was damaged though and the clip was ripped off.. I have yet to hear back from the sellers but we’ll see how the goggles perform next week and see if I hear anything back from the seller."
3.0,"For the price point, you get what you pay for. My son is in the middle of being in a toddler shoe and little kid shoe, and these seem to be a good transition until his foot grows. I purchased the first pair in early September, thinking these would last until he fits in the little kid shoes we bought him at an outlet store over the summer. This was not the case. As of early December, they no longer Velcro and he is pretty frustrated with them. However, there isn’t much cheaper out there, so I bought him another pair hoping that the next ones last until he fits into the little kid shoe."
3.0,Ordered a size 14. Silk like material. Odd fit.  Really small in the bust area. Pretty good in the hip area
3.0,"Cute earrings, I was expecting them to be a little bigger. I wanted them to pop, but still cute."
3.0,I love these sunglasses but in the picture you can't see or it doesn't say in the description that there is gold on them.  Whe. They're on you and wearing them you can see it.  It's on the piece where the glasses have the screws.  I was so upset.  I hate the color gold.  Other then that they're nice but I wish they would show a picture or write in the description about the yellow gold piece.  If you do t like yellow gold don't buy them.
3.0,"Runs small. If you normally need a woman's large or x large in gloves/mittens, don't buy these.<br /><br />They are so soft and warm though. Don't think I'm going to be returning them because of that."
3.0,Too large and unshapely. Soft material.
3.0,Wayy too small
3.0,"I needed more holes because it was too large for me. Also, the hook was kind of foreign to me. It was very wide, and didn't fit into all my pants."
3.0,The battery was dead when we got it. 2 day after getting it the back fell off the knife
3.0,"The characters are upside down and cut off on shoulder , I expected to look like the picture. I have another one that was great. I will change my review if it gets fixed."
3.0,"Pros: Love the color, and they feel soft. Length is good.<br /><br />Cons: elastic band at the natural waist is thick and not very comfortable - at least for me.  Also, these are not squat proof, and do show every bump —unless you’re cool with that.<br />Not my jam, and was really hoping they would be!"
3.0,When an item is called a sweatshirt I expect a much heavier article if clothing! The weight is disappointing - more of a T-shirt material - certainly not a sweatshirt! And the sleeves are a bit too short which makes for a strange fit! I like the length to wear with leggings or skinny jeans. Was wanting what the description said - a sweatshirt - so am disappointed - but kept for warmer weather - still looking for a tunic-type sweatshirt for cold weather!
3.0,Way to small for my daughter.
3.0,"Really cute! I wish there was a better place to clip the extended strap but it's not too big of a deal. Had a weird smell when I opened it, but once I let it air out it was fine! Also it's gold and not silver buckles like in the picture. That was what bummed me out the most!! Other than that it's great!"
3.0,I’m 5’4 167lbs and this for just eight. I paired it with a leopard print wide belt and leopard flats.  The major issue is the material. It comes very wrinkled and it wrinkles up as the day goes.
3.0,They wher cute in all but too small so had to give away
3.0,"Honestly I had this product for less than 2 hrs, the product is a great price, matched very well with my watch and I'm guessing most gshock watches. The only reason I write a review so soon, I think the original look was better. Main reason for the 3 stars, it did not fit 100% right, I'd say about 85% I had to do some modding to get it to go in all the way. Other than that, I bought it to try a different strap, ended up not needing the product after all, if I didn't mess with it and ruin it, I'd still keep it for the less than $15 that I spent."
3.0,Only the bottoms are fleece- the top is a thin cotton. This isn’t really what I thought I was getting when ordering ‘fleece pjs’ for my child
3.0,"Check all the seams and look over the fabric for holes first!  The seams came apart the very first time we tried this on. Very very disappointed in the quality. Haven’t even washed it, but took the tags off so can’t return it. The 6-12 month fit is nice on our 6 month old and can tell it will stretch to fit babe for a while to come."
3.0,"Fit's as expected, good deal for the price, but there is a bump at each shoulder where the sleeve meats the shoulder.  I'll try to iron them out, or get it to lay differently, but it does detract from it's appearance."
3.0,The dress is pretty - it's just not my style.
3.0,Broke pretty quickly . Lasted maybe a week
3.0,"The cut its pretty, the design it's pretty but the finish its lousy, and it's really short even for a 5.01, my husband dried on the dryer and it shrunk  :/  hope they make a new version with a longer fit."
3.0,"I love this necklace but I only gave it 3 stars because the clasp is really small. If you have someone to help you fasten it, it would be no problem."
3.0,"Having used the 20 oz Amphipod backband and the handheld one and the belt one with 4 eight oz bottles (which leak a lot when full! - like it but not happy with the bottles), I tried this instead of using my Nathan 50 oz mid size water backpack.  This is heavy around the waist when full, the bottles do get in the way of your elbows some when running (33 inch waist), and I just didn't like it that much.  I'm using my Nathan 50 oz smaller size backpack instead when I need this much water on a long run, even though it has straps over the shoulders.  Carrying this much weight around your waist only also can lead to more stomach discomfort in the post-run."
3.0,"For the price, a good deal"
3.0,"Fabric was light & airy, though the color was not nearly as dark or pretty as it looked in the photo which was disappointing.  I will be sending the shirt back however, because it fit like a sack.  I ordered a  large and I am 5'7"" and 170 lbs"
3.0,"It's a cute swimsuit for the price. The bottoms fit great, but I wish the top fit better, provided better coverage. It might be a lounge around the pool suit more than something I'd really want to spend much time swimming in."
3.0,Got it for Chris Stapleton was disappointed a little with the fit and hoped the writing was more white not grey.
3.0,ruffle neck is so high I am going to have to alter it. Comes up to chin and then some!
3.0,"Top button wont close all the way, cute dress."
3.0,Cute outfit. The pants did come with some string and threading on the outside that I’m afraid to cute off bc it may affect the overall stitching. Also runs a bit small in my opinion. I got the size 2-3 and it fit her pretty snug. She’s super thin and y’all so the pants were a bit short and the shirt a little snug. I’d say fits more like an 18-24 months. Very cute outfit though.
3.0,Must order a size to a size and a half larger to small for my fingers.
3.0,"Construction and fabric is just ok. Will work well for a one night party, but if you want something you can wear several times, as a costume for a play for example, it may not hold up. Really cute though."
3.0,"Looks like pictures. Sleeves are seamed with white thread. And I use a fabric softener so clothing won’t hold lint but it doesn’t work on the sleeves of this shirt,Strange. But I LOVE the shirt."
3.0,"They came with the ruffle not sewn well.  In addition, they were just not my style."
3.0,"I was expecting this to fit like my older gloves, but these were much smaller on the hands and shorter for the wrists.<br />For what it's worth it's ok, but I don't expect it to last very long. Especially since it was made from china and came in a little bag with staples. For guys, you might not find this comfortable. For girls, I hope you have something that goes with this lol"
3.0,"Hi.<br />The goggles are nice, but they are quite small. I was not able to use them and had to give them to my son."
3.0,Band was exactly what I wanted. White and not stiff. Soft and pliable.<br />But….I emediately had a reaction to it. The plastic it came in just said made in China.<br />I wiped down with a alcohol swab and then wiped with clean water. Tried wearing again.<br />Can’t wear.
3.0,"I won't order from this company again --- forgot to check its ratings, which are very low.  I placed the order on Dec. 8, and finally got the money clip/watch on Dec. 20!  They offer free shipping, but must be very slow to get their stuff in the mail.<br /><br />This is a handsome piece, with a nice presentation case, but it does look as if it's been around for awhile. Not at all sure that it actually is new, although they said it was.  The label has been photocopied, and there's old wear inside the presentation case.<br /><br />As the saying goes, ""We shall see.""  I surely do hope the darned thing works!"
3.0,"i went with the size chart - i ordered the 2x ... that hurt my feelings a little but i did it anyway because i'm not a small girl .. i love overalls and these were distinct enough i wanted to give them a shot. i didn't have the color in shortalls and the crisscross back is cute.  the distress is enough to be cute but not look like you got attacked by a wolf.  but they run small - if you review the size chart, i would add a size on top of that - or add 2 to your normal size.  these fit me and i don't hate the way they look, but they don't feel so great as they do come up a bit in the stride because the buttoning really lands these right around my waist rather than my hips, which is how i prefer my 'alls to sit.  so that said - the description calls them 'loose' .... in order to get to the loose, adjust the size when you order."
3.0,Material was loose and unflattering
3.0,"An attractive sweater with the slim fit that I like wearing.  It fits fine for my 6 foot frame.  The material is ok, but a bit thinner than I expected.  Expect it to shrink very slightly.  My biggest problem is the zipper has a sharp end at the top of the collar that scratches my neck every time I turn my head."
3.0,Cute suit but the bust was to large for me. No big surprise there😏
3.0,The size 11 I received was closer to a US size 9.  Since no size 13 was available I returned them.
3.0,I have a large bust and I thought it made me look pregnant.
3.0,Me gusta el tipo de tela
3.0,"The shoe is really cute, I want a 3-6 months and got a size one--way too large I will keep them & find another pair for now"
3.0,"Im not an overly big guy.  5'10 200lbs - this robe barely fits.  Not soft at all, very misleading title and description."
3.0,"It was well made and nice quality.  It had more of a matte finish than I expected.  I purchased this for my wife and although the quality is nice, it seems more &#34;man-ish&#34;. It is  She is looking for something more feminine."
3.0,Dislike<br />The fact that the shirt ran so small.
3.0,It's a little too small for comfort
3.0,"I was hoping that it would have a slenderizing effect since it's high waisted. Not the case...I'm not obese but I could have really enjoyed wearing a dress that didn't emphasize the extra weight. I should have learned by now not to buy before trying it on. Otherwise, cute dress. I think most customers would like it :)"
3.0,"Got for my teen daughter, ended up giving to my 9 year old. Sizing is way off. Does fit like a regular uniform skirt, so not stretch or give."
3.0,"It’s a cute suit. My daughter really liked it however, the first time she put it on and got in the water the first time, when she got out, she had glitter EVERYWHERE! All down her legs, arms, face, etc!! I touched her and had glitter all over me too."
3.0,This would be just fine but with no instructions who would know!  They came jammed in a box as tight as possible.  Took a week for them to regain their shape.  Would be good to have a simple piece of paper letting people know they need to set them out for a bit to allow them to regain their shape.
3.0,Nice quality but to short
3.0,Broke after 1 wear
3.0,"Nice pair of pants to start out with, but...<br /><br />Put them on, sat down and the snap broke - just separated and came off the material. Kind of a pain since I needed them that day, so I used the internal button and a belt to carry (or should I say 'hold'...) me through the day.<br /><br />I was of two minds on returning the pants - on the one side, the rest of the construction is good (and I do need the pants for volunteer work that I do) so I got a snap-kit (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004T7VT ASIN B00004T7VT in case the link gets stripped) and have worn it a day - it's holding up well now."
3.0,too small nice anyway
3.0,"The neck is too tight, and it's not true to size....but I do love the length and arms."
3.0,"I have several of these styles and this one in particular runs very very small. I can make it work, but would have gotten a medium or large instead of a small. I am 5'2"" and 123 lbs."
3.0,adhesive on labels will not come off. would order more if not for that
3.0,Buy 1 size up if you plan on putting them in the dryer. Black does not have a leg pocket just a waistband pocket so false advertising. Due to running small and falsely advertising a leg pocket I had to deduct 2 stars otherwise very comfortable and quality material
3.0,"Pretty, but it does not stay on at night. I have to bobby pin it to my hair in order for it to stay on. It would be better for those who want to sleep with large curlers in their hair."
3.0,This photo shows black ones but there aren't any. And only 4 navy ones and no white ones like this pictured.
3.0,Good product doesn't do like it shows for big boobs... 36ddd
3.0,"I bought these in two sizes and neither worked out well.  They sit so awkwardly, they aren't flattering at all.  Looked like I had a bunch of extra chub in my lower belly area.  My husband laughed when I tried them on because they were so awkward - both sizes."
3.0,I really like this company and its mission statement. I have bought several items from them before which I loved however this necklace came a bit tarnished. It looks cute and dainty but the blackish tint just ruined it for me. I did get it half off with their promo but still may not have been worth it given the condition it came.
3.0,Not really extra wide - fit somewhat tight
3.0,"For my daughter. I didn’t realize it had the side darts, or I might have gotten a larger size. Shirt kept riding up on her as she worked. She said she got very hot and sweaty, that the material didn’t breathe.<br />It is hard to buy clothes online for others. I guess."
3.0,"Had to return this one.  Ordered XL, usual size, and it was roomy.  That wasn't the big issue though - it's just frumpy and not attractive for shorter and larger frame.  I can see that on a slim person, maybe size sm/med and 5'6"" or so, would be a lovely dress.  And don't size up like you normally have to on these 'online dresses', they are more true to size.  The material and color was as expected, nice flowing fabric with lining."
3.0,Really nice but too small so I gave to my daughter
3.0,It ran short. Kind of depressing as it's SUPER soft and comfy otherwise. I just don't like feeling like I grew too tall for it.
3.0,"It is too long. I'm 5'3. And even with high heels, the dress is sweeping the floors. The sides are shorter while the front and back of the dress are at least 2 inches longer. It needs alteration."
3.0,Poor quality.  Cleats broke off left holes in the shoe sole. My son tore the shoes apart in less than 3 months.
3.0,Cheap-seeming
3.0,"Really cute, but a little too big especially in the arms. Also there is no lining in the chest, which I don't feel comfortable with. It did look super cute on other than that."
3.0,Length shrinks quite a bit after washing.
3.0,I sent it back because it had a weird fit and was a little flimsy.
3.0,"Super cute dress but it has an elastric cinch at the rear waist. It's better then the cheapo tie belt but I wasn't expecting it to be so obvious.<br />It's also lower cut then I was anticpating. It's fine but if your modest, you might want to consider a cami or something underneath."
3.0,"Doesn't look right for my 5'2 short body type.  Bought a medium and it seems more like an XL on me.  I might try to take it in.  I look like II put on 50 pounds with it on.  It is made fine, but just doesn't look good on me."
3.0,"i ordered a small pair, they say they are size small but are closer to medium/large."
3.0,"The purse seem to be of good quality. It wasn't the color yellow I was wanting, so I had to return it. Beware of shipping charges if you have to return the item."
3.0,"This dress really should be a 4 or 5 Star... BUT the size chart didn't work well for me. I wear between a Large and X-Large depending on the item. Ordered a Large because it's already a loose fit style and it's big on me... A Medium would have been better... But I never usually fit a Medium. Other than that, I love the deep red color... It's very comfortable and lightweight. I would order this again... Just in a Medium instead."
3.0,I loved the look of this dress and I bought it for to wear to an outdoor wedding.  I should have paid more attention to the fabric--it whipped around and stuck to my legs when the wind blew.  I wish it were lined so it would hang better but I guess in future I will wear a slip or find a hem weight.
3.0,"My husband was disappointed with these orthotics. While the arch support was strong, these inserts provided very little extra cushion. The inserts I've bought in the past contain gel, memory foam, and other products to add comfort to the heel at least, but these are just very firm. Most of his shoes are more comfortable without it. He hasn't used these inserts."
3.0,"I love the compression level, I wish they weren't so thick."
3.0,"UPDATE: It fell apart and another had to be ordered. Nothing was told to me about having to return the broken one until now MONTHS LATER. They are charging me twice. Disappointed!!<br /><br />Bought this as part of a gift and I’m not disappointed. Came boxed, not a single scuff mark or anything. The box it came in could definitely be better and not so cheaply made or cheap looking. I’d buy again. Very nice and well made key chain."
3.0,Nice sock but runs small. Not true to size. Order up 1 size.
3.0,Fits big order size down.<br />It’s was ok for the price. Not the best quality and awful stitching.
3.0,"Beautiful looking tulle skirt- makes wearing my fill skirted dresses more comfortable until the underskirt split, but I love when I turn quickly the shirt and tulle both glide just right ,not stiffly! love that part! The only problem is that the skirt is not the size advertised and split the seam halfway up the first time I wore it...This is a problem! I spent really good money and followed the sizing charts accordingly and still the slip skirt splits... i cant afford to keep buying new petticots!"
3.0,"I wanted to love these...My daughter and I love our canvas classics. She has another pair of lined classics for fall, and both feature flexible rubber soles. I purchased the lime crochet from the TOMS site. The soles are very rigid and extremely slippery, so unlike the others. She had a pair of glitters with similar soles, but not this bad. I hope that over time these will get better."
3.0,"fabric is very sensible, mine tore as I was trying it on. looks good but will probably tear off quick."
3.0,"Super cute, WAY too much cleavage! Had to return. Returns weren't free and we're a bit of a pain."
3.0,"fits head like mushroom,glasses will come up"
3.0,stretch out easily
3.0,cheap shoe will do for photo shoot or such very hight platform  not for a night out most likely s
3.0,Is everything I wanted but doesn’t fit my iPhone 7 Plus so I will be returning.
3.0,"I've docked 2 stars at this time.  I may give one back. Because it's a really cute shirt, it seems like it will be super cozy, and the price is reasonable. My reasoning for docking 2 stars is that I haven't actually worn it (just tried it on) I've washed it once> as I try to do with all new items, and it has already faded a ton. So it doesn't look as nice as I'd prefer for a brand new piece. This as well as it is shorter than anticipated from looking through the photos. I thought it would be a tunic type length, it just barely passes the tops of my hip bones though, so it most definitely is not a tunic length. I'm not all that tall either > 5'6""<br />I know they're not great photos. But here it is, as I originally stated, it comes just below my hip bones, if I stretch it down it does anyway. But otherwise it naturally sits right about the top of my hip/pelvis bone.  Not awful. But I thought it was going to be longer. The neckline is also rather different than what is advertised. So I am going to leave it as is at 3 stars. Not too sure if you can tell in the photos either, but like I said> I've washed it a grand total of once. And the shamrock is very faded and worn looking. Which is disappointing."
3.0,"Nice pair of boxers,but a bit short."
3.0,this hat would be a good buy at $9.99 max. The hat is lightweight and not as warm as expected. I do like the velcro strap on it.
3.0,"The 6mm was too small for my septum, so I returned it, but the quality was good and they weren't too hard to bend."
3.0,"First the good: I love the length and the fabric.  The bad:  I am not sure what the heck is with the top.  I have a triple D chest and spent a solid ten minutes shifting, lifting, tying and re-tying before having to put it away for a week so frustrated with how awful it looked.  To get it to fit/cover my chest I have to cinch the tie at my neck and meanwhile the skirt is so large it falls down off my hips.  Finally I have given up and cut the top off to make this into a cute skirt that I paired a wide stretchy belt with.  The belt holds the skirt up and hides the thin waist band."
3.0,The ring is probably exactly like the photo. Nothing wrong with ring I just decided that it wasn't for me.
3.0,They where way smaller than expected
3.0,"Cute costume, but very short.  I'm 5'4&#34; and normally wear a Medium without issue, but based on the previous reviews I ordered a XL and it's still to short."
3.0,The fabric is not what I expected for<br />So I give a 3 stars
3.0,I ordered a S(mall) and it's more like a M(edium).  I'm 5'6'' and 140lbs.
3.0,"I was looking to sparkle up my shoes for a wedding I was in.  I thought these would be the perfect addition.  Although they are quite cute, they were a little smaller than I anticipated and they don't stay in place very well as the clips are not very durable.  I was certain I would lose one by the end of the night.  I didn't have time to order a different pair, so I kept the ones I purchased.  Just ""ok"" for the price."
3.0,"I'm relatively new to skirted leggings, but these fit me well. I ordered the XL and both the skirt and leggings were fitted but not snug.  The material is comfortable as it stretches but is breathable.  I am looking forward to using these in warmer weather."
3.0,"Bought for my 8 year old daughter.  They are fun, but a little to big for her wrist.  Cutting the band to size is easy, but the face is longer than I expected and not flexible"
3.0,"Love this clip, but it is a pain if you have a lot of cash and my 1st strap broke on a night out."
3.0,Didn’t like snug fit
3.0,These don’t fit the teeth very well. They constantly fall off. They are also hard to initially fit the teeth w the molding. Once the molding get hot it turns to sticky glue which goes everywhere other than the place you want it to.
3.0,My daughter loves these but they are snug on her foot. I followed the measurement chart and now I wish I would have done another size up. The velcro is good and the strap stays where it should for the most part. The heel has a good grip too.
3.0,"Fit snugger than expected in the legs, but still flattering, super soft and a great length! However, the drawstring ring busted literally within an hour of just lounging around the house in them (and it did not fit snug around the waist).  Probably won't request a refund because I'm sure I can fix it, but definitely won't buy again."
3.0,"This design of Toesox does not have XS size. The labelling in Amazon is misleading as it turns out be a S size. Hence, it does not fit my feet very well."
3.0,I'm 5'8 135 lbs usually wear size 6. The large is snug and unflattering. Plenty of pockets make these pants useful. Wish I had gotten XL but will deal with snug pants rather than forfeit high shipping cost.
3.0,Run very small!!!
3.0,"The product arrived quickly.  They are okay I guess, I think they are overpriced a bit."
3.0,"Cute item for a Halloween costume. The chain is pretty flimsy though and the clasp needed to be changed the first time it was worn. Overall, it is worth the money. Not something you could wear day to day but good for costumes or cosplay, ect."
3.0,These sandals came highly recommended but did not fit me well.
3.0,They are nice earrings but the posts are very flimsy.  Waiting for them to come off.
3.0,Tighter around the hips than in the pic. I am 5’3” and 135 and my hips are on the larger side. I wear a size 6 pant.
3.0,"Definitely roomy and comfortable but not as comfortable in heat as it could've been if it actually had cotton in it. It is shiny and cotton isn't shiny. The pockets are nice sized and it is long but not too long. If you don't care about the fiber content, you'll love this dress. I only kept it because of the fit and pockets but it's definitely not cotton so it goes to the back of my closet for some occasion a dress like that is needed. I'll add accessories and maybe a jacket."
3.0,"I don't know how rest of the ladies have fit in this dress. I ordered it based on the reviews and when I tried it, I couldn't even fit it in although the chart 4/6 has my perfect measurement. I think the backset for this dress is the zipper on the back is doesn't go down to the hip so this makes it hard to wear the dress either from the head or the bottom. I am 5.4, 120lb.. ordered a 4/6 size and now have to return it.. very disappointed! The material is nice though. Its just the zipper on the back they have to work on."
3.0,12 year old  Son wears a size 7 in most shoes but these are uncomfortably snug around his ankles
3.0,"Watch is fine, daughter loves it whatever.  I’m just here to find out who at the factory set the alarm to go off at midnight!"
3.0,Ok for the price.  Cheap fabric.
3.0,"I wanted this sweater to work!! I ordered it in a medium but it was too large, extra material that I could bunch up with my hands. So then I ordered a small and that time it fit perfectly on my arms, however, still too baggy around my center/waist area - it just wasn’t flattering the way it laid on me in that area.  For those reasons, I had to return it again. But, if your measurements work out with this sweater you will be happy, as it is super comfortable and so soft, cute buttons in the front.  I am 36B bust, 28-29” waist and usually wear a medium in most tops/sweaters but neither the small nor the medium worked out for me."
3.0,THis bag is cute but the material looks like it is made of inexpensive vinyl.
3.0,"I ordered these mainly for the side stripe design and the size of the neck opening.  The fabric is much thinner than I expected, tho.  I am 6’ 3.5” tall.  I usually take a 2XLT size - but these are ok on length since they don’t come in tall sizes."
3.0,"Very cute, but ears make it bulky and uncomfortable."
3.0,"glasses fit well, look great but arrived with glued stickers on both lenses; most difficult to remove."
3.0,"It was cute, but I didn't like that the neckline puckered and there was no coverage for my side-boob. Also, it was too short for my liking. Great quality otherwise, but not for the price."
3.0,"could have heaters on both side of hands, but for price good enough"
3.0,"I wear this band a lot for work.  Maybe the water contact is the cause, but it has tarnished and looks dirty.  For day to day wear I’m not impressed with how the band has held up"
3.0,I wanted so bad for this to fit! It was much tighter than any other bodycon dress I own. The tan in the bottom front made a point that hit directly below my fupa. Spanx would help but the material is so thin the Spanx were too obvious for work appropriate which is the look I was going for. Fit everywhere except the lower waist and hip area.
3.0,"The glasses are great, but they do not have an anti-fog coating as it is described in the item description. Not good when skiing."
3.0,"They have more universal sizes and the XL should cover up to 40C. The cups don't have the capacity to hold that kind of size, but the bra itself is really nice and if you are a smaller cup size, it will look super cute."
3.0,ok product if you have a quiet surrounding. i work in a cold warehouse that i wouldnt consider exceptionally noisy but cannot hear the music clear as the volume doesnt go up very loud.
3.0,"The Stainless Steel Filigree Teardrop Earrings are a cute style with an artsy cutout pattern.  They would match about any outfit, casual or dressy.<br /><br />What I don't like about the earrings is they are smaller in size than expected and the quality isn't very good.  I could easily bend the earrings with my thumb and index finger.  They also fall off easily because of being too lightweight; meaning, they don't stay weighed down and my hair knocks them out of my ears.<br /><br />I received the Filigree Teardrop Earrings at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review, which I have given to assist other buyers in making informed purchasing decisions."
3.0,"It's OK.  I didn't expect the material to be what it is (like a bathing suit), and I didn't realize the cuffs were elastic.  But I'll still wear it.  Side note... I found it kind of strange that this shirt has absolutely no labels or tags.  Not that it matters, just weird."
3.0,"much larger than expected, took weeks to arrive"
3.0,The dress was way too big.
3.0,Kind of expensive thougth
3.0,Ya gotta love bat wings from China 🇨🇳 🦇
3.0,Why the girl look so mad😂
3.0,some what small material look cheap. It would do for 1 event only
3.0,"It just barely fits and when it arrives some of the stitching on the left sandal had already come undone. Needed sandals and didn't feel like ordering replacements. It's not like the stitching completely ruins it; in fact, I barely notice it and neither will anyone else they're up close."
3.0,I wanted to like this skirt so bad but it just was not flattering on me.
3.0,Offers good support and pretty.
3.0,"I was super excited about this ring when I opened up the little drawstring bag in was in today. The ring is shiny and sparkling. It's comfortable. I'm pretty disappointed to see that the little &#34;stones&#34; are just glued onto the band, the adhesive used isn't even clear, it's putty white. The price is great I just don't think this ring would hold up for very long at all. I'll be returning this ring."
3.0,I bought this set for my hubby and he liked it but the ring didn't fit as he has chunky fingers but he wears it on a necklace the bracelet he's only worn once
3.0,The backs to the earrings won't lock. I've already lost several.
3.0,It's short. And the top part is big
3.0,Cute but half of them broke right away
3.0,Fabric is a bit thin and see-through
3.0,Pretty but runs small for a one size fits all top. Definitely a small size to maybe medium. No larger.
3.0,"I purchased these shorts based on all the stellar reviews.<br />They are comfortable and well made, although it's the fit I don't like. They are a bit too long so I have to roll the waist and they flare out on the sides. They look frumpy to me. I feel they are too expensive although I did decide to keep them to wear around the house since I had been having a difficult time finding white shorts that were not too thin and were well. Since these checked those boxes I kept them. I personally cannot recommend these shorts.<br /><br />Update: I did discover great shorts that are still well made, not too short nor long, and don't flare out on the sides. I got them in white and light gray and they fit perfectly.... Tandisk Women's 5"" Casual Jersey Cotton Shorts Lounge Yoga Pajama Walking Shorts with Pockets Activewear"
3.0,"I bought the 3 pack polka dot design. Huge mistake!<br /><br />While the product did fit well and was fine while I was wearing them...once I took the socks off at the end of the day, I had polka dot indents all over my legs!"
3.0,Just want everyone to know that if you scroll down in the product description it says imitation blue amber
3.0,It states Polyester but is in fact Nylon.
3.0,"Usually i like what i order here, but this dress was really big on me for a small. It wasn't very flattering."
3.0,"It’s altight, you do get what you pay for, it’s a bit cheaply made, but it’s still a nice set to start with if you aren’t sure if you’re into it or not"
3.0,Super pretty just not long enough and I can’t adjust the straps for the top so it’s not super low cut because it becomes even shorter
3.0,"It is a gift so won't know how it will be accepted. However, I wish there had been something showing the different ways it can be used."
3.0,The fabric is thin and there is an odd seam that hits right across your boobs.  It is only tunic length.  I liked the pattern of the fabric but not much else.  The fabric gets a lot of static electricity so I have to keep pulling it down.
3.0,"The sizing was all wrong. I order by their measurements and the pants came up way above the belly button, very loose and length was just about right. I am 5’ 9” and weigh 134 and ordered the large."
3.0,"It is not the best, but ok. I bought one last week, and am using it everyday. You have to wash it before the first use."
3.0,These are really cute and of good quality material they just didn't work for us. They looked like boats on my daughter's feet so I had to return.
3.0,"Cute, but shorter than the picture. I must wear tights with it. (But they work)<br />Very thin fabric. Cheap, but cute for a season.<br />Maroon color is rich.<br />I’d buy again"
3.0,"Cute skirt, cuter than picture but arrived with a quarter sized tear. Would return but too much hassle. I will patch it as its that kind of skirt but it oughtn't have had a tear."
3.0,"Lovely material and message, but the size does not work"
3.0,It’s not as soft as it says. It feels pretty cheap. It does what it says but I wouldn’t buy it again
3.0,Very pretty but runs small. Good about returns
3.0,"Super cute but buttons constantly broke, no pockets. But it's $10 and super cute dog on the back so for a few wears it was work it."
3.0,"These stainless steel whistles are fine but not exactly what I was looking for.  However, the price was so low I decided to keep them anyway.  Their sound is not as loud as I had hoped for.  The visual quality is very nice."
3.0,"Quality is good product is as exactly as described but all i gottah say is if you dont got the body then dont buy it. My belly fat was sticking out of the straps lol which is funny because i am pretty scrawny myself. the bra looks really cheaply made btw. Not posting up pics cause of how funny it looks, rather had spend my money on a diffrerent bathing suit."
3.0,Beautiful boots I do wish they came in half sizes. I am a 9.5 purchased a 9 based on reviews that said to go smaller.  To tight but will give them as a gift.
3.0,"I expected an actual sweater, but this is more of a slightly thicker long sleeve shirt. It fits great and looks awesome though."
3.0,"I like the watch. It has sturdy feel about it. It feels like my timex expedition but a little heavier. However, I cannot change the day. I can change all the digital settings except the day. If anything changes I’ll update this."
3.0,These are fine and great for the price...but they do slide down more than some other brands that I've worn.
3.0,Much larger than I anticipated. I was expecting more of a small clutch size
3.0,The rose gold is an odd color. They were too big for my nose/face but they’re very durable and the black and silver are nice. Just not for me
3.0,the pants are waaaaayyy to short for my daughter
3.0,Order one size up. Mine is a little small for me. I am losing weight so it might fit me well soon.
3.0,Baby won't keep it on
3.0,"First thing my toddler did was rip the mouse’s bow off which she did with ease. 🙄😂 So that could be better attached. The back of the slipper is SO tight that you have to jam your kid’s toes into the stunt just to fit her heel, then once their foot is in there’s an entire thumb with at the toe."
3.0,much wider than the 2132 in the same 55mm
3.0,The color is slightly off but still gorgeous. However there is large wording printed across the bottom and the design is cut off by the hem. It does require a petticoat or tutu to have any body whatsoever. Without one it hangs lifelessly. I am disappointed in the dress but for one day as a fun dress to wear to work (I’m a nanny) it will do.
3.0,Love the color but these roll down. I have other pairs that stay put. But the argyle always rolls or scrunches down.
3.0,It wasn't the correct size that was listed on the website.
3.0,"I wish I could give this item a higher rating, but the sizing is just so off. I'm debating if I should return it or not. The top is too big, the bottoms fit just right with the exception of the legs. The waist is a little loose, but fits how'd I want. I never thought I had disperportionatly large legs but the leg openings on the bottom are ask tight! It's painful to wear for more then a few minutes. Typically I'd return it straight away, but the print is so cute and matches a suit that my toddler girl has so I love that. Because it was fairly cheap, I'm going to see if I can't alter it a little for a better fit."
3.0,"Absolutely love the bracelet.It’s very dainty.But the first time I wore it,it fell off due to the Lobster clasp has a gap.A defect I guess.Guess it needs to be returned."
3.0,"This sweater is very cute and soft, but I ordered a xl and it came as a medium."
3.0,"Cute sunglasses, just took almost 2 months to get to me!"
3.0,The bracelet is fine for the price.  I have to keep adjusting the slide on the box clasp.
3.0,"The watch itself was beautiful, unfortunately stopped working within 2 weeks. Returned and had second watch sent to me only to receive an empty box with just a chain and instructions. No pocket watch. Looking for a different brand/seller now."
3.0,a bit small but overall a decent choker. Not a big fan of the leather tie in the rear but i like it
3.0,"Loved the colore, the size, however, is not a good fit if you have a size 9- 10 foot. Very small.great valur, though."
3.0,The idea of the rings are nice and they are made nicely but ran too small shipping back was almost the price of the rings.
3.0,"Much less colorful than the pictures, many are mostly black with a small spot of color. Still, quite a few pairs for the price."
3.0,"I bought these to hide my nipples under some well fitting tank tops. They were easy to put on and take off. Sometimes, my allergies cause my nipples to react and get very visible. I was hoping these would hide them during those times, but no such luck. Also on my tighter fitting shirts, you can see the outline of the pastie. I tried it when my nipples had calmed down a bit and on a looser fitting shirt. They worked well in that situation, but that was not why I bought them. So if you tend to have very hard nipples, these might not cover them up. Also, the package says not to wear them for longer than 8 hours at a time. I bought them to wear during my vacation, where I would need them for longer than that. Overall, it is a decent product, but I am not sure that I will be using them for their intended purchase.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: I received this item for free, or at a discounted price in exchange for my fair and honest review."
3.0,"These were pretty but ran pretty small.  Plus, when I washed them they wrinkled up a lot.  They just don't look nice when they're all wrinkled and crimped, and life's too short to iron pajamas.  I won't buy these again."
3.0,Coating peeled and nose spacing is not great
3.0,Color is A LOT lighter than pictured. A also not even close to the actual color of PDX carpet. Nice thick comfortable socks. Fast delivery.
3.0,They are huge but quality felt okay so giving 3 stars. Will try and order in small or xs if they makenit
3.0,Cute but more of a child’s size than a woman. Had no trouble with the return.
3.0,So after having for a few weeks. The buckle that you adjust the belt keeps breaking. Good idea.
3.0,too transparent
3.0,"Cute shirt but picks easily, so doesn’t look nice long."
3.0,"This beanie is awesome. It connect easy, it has great sound and is snuggly warm. Unfortunately, the seam runs across the top of your head like a mohawk and looks really weird... Maybe that's why it's on sale right now. I gave it to my 10 year old because he doesn't mind that."
3.0,"Too small , maybe it for kids"
3.0,I don’t love the fabric. Cheap material.
3.0,"They were cute, but quite a bit too small."
3.0,"Pretty, but way too small"
3.0,Nice fabric but the arms were too tight and the bodice was too large. I don't recommend for a fuller figure woman.
3.0,I really like these glasses but the carry case makes it difficult to keep in my car. it is very large and awkward. If you have a way to keep these glasses safe while you are not using i would recommenced getting them. But let me tell you the carry case if terrible and large.
3.0,The women of the house loved seeing and holding the product and thought it was very cute.  But the rain gauge glass tube was not attached and needed to be glued on to the platform.  The umbrella was also needed to be glued into its hole on the platform. Disappointed.
3.0,A little bit cheap looking . But pretty
3.0,"My husband loves them, but they have broken twice in the first two days of wear. So far he is glueing them back together because he love them so much."
3.0,"These glasses are OK and most certainly work, however the construction seems flimsy and not really in line with the price point. I would rather they had made the product sturdier and the accompanying case smaller and lighter."
3.0,"Sk small and delicate. Picture is deceiving,  I thought t was bigger"
3.0,"I bought these for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves them, unfortunately some of the decorative pieces are already falling off. It's a real bummer because they are absolutely precious."
3.0,Not enough support for C cup plus
3.0,The dress don't look like the picture I didn't like it I might return the dress
3.0,Fit just right for the night but a little snug. The torso was a little short.
3.0,This product is for kids and not adults.  Details on the size should have been more clear
3.0,Great quality. The pjs are soft and cozy but it’s noy free return. They approved my return request but I have to pay postage when it stated free return. Wouldn’t have bought them if I knew I would have to pay to ship back to China.
3.0,Not as long as it appears. Good for a kid maybe
3.0,"Not a huge fan of the material. It feels pretty cheap. The pattern is cute and the fit isn’t bad, but I’m returning because of the material."
3.0,"So these are cool socks, but they are SUPER small. I got them for my partner, but they were too small for him; my calves are average for a woman and they are still tight on me, to the point of being uncomfortable if I have them on too long. They are thick and well made though."
3.0,"This dress was giving me a weird sheer, nightgown vibe. It almost made me feel like Wendy from Peter Pan. It runs a little big and overall just wasn’t me. Returned it!"
3.0,Not really what I expected. Seems to be more for fashion than actual hunting. The magnets in the finger flap and thumb flap are poor at best. If you move your fingers at all it comes undone.
3.0,"The costume is very nice. However, it runs pretty small. I usually wear a large tshirt. I am 5’ 7” and weigh 195 lbs. I ordered the 2XL and it barely zips. I would return it but I don’t have time."
3.0,"skulls were little too shiny, but works"
3.0,"This sweatshirt is much thinner than the average sweatshirt.  It is cute but runs a little small.  I am 5'3"" and 145 pounds, ordered an XL expecting it to be a little big and baggy but it was not. It has slits on the sides at the bottom which I was not expecting. I may not have fully read the description. Not my favorite, but luckily my daughter loves it."
3.0,This sweater was just ok for me.. i sized up one size for a more oversized fit & I got the green/white/gray color block. The green was a lot darker and not as pretty as the olive green shown. The neck is not as chunky as shown so it doesn’t quite have the same look as the pic.
3.0,"I had ordered this to go with a costume. The closer to the edge of the leaves, the thinner and more flexible the metal became. There were two barbs at the ends of the leaves and they would poke me all night. The cuffs would also slide down a lot. Towards the end of the event, some of the leaves broke off."
3.0,"I would have loved this dress if the pockets weren't so poorly executed. I purchased one in white and one in the rust brown color. The thickness of the fabric,color and length were all on point. Then there's the pockets... Mercy, jumbled and frumpy no matter how much I iron or steam them. The pockets just aren't sewn on properly and gives the appearance of jumbled underwear under the dress. A major drawback I have ordering clothes from Amazon...  I ordered the white in size XL and the rust brown, size L. There  isn't a noticeable difference in the two sizes but the white is of a thicker fabric,which is nice as it prevents too much  sheerness in the white color.I kept the dresses, I can always wear a cardigan with them and If it gets too annoying dealing with the pockets I can always just wear them as decent house dresses."
3.0,"This Watch is a very GOOD looking Piece. I like it very much.<br />THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS NOT WORKING FROM DAY ONE. IT WONT EVEN START. I TRIED EVERYTHING POSSIBLE.<br />I WOULD LIKE TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW WORKING ONE.<br />SO CAN U MAKE ARRANGEMENTS. I HAD WRITTEN TO THE SENDER, BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION YET."
3.0,"Cute bracelet but runs a little bigger, it has rings to tighten but still doesn't quite get small enough. But I love the colors"
3.0,"Happy with order nice mix and colors , i havent really used them since im so used to bigger size balls for my snake eyes now but only if they came a bit bigger . But nice 👏"
3.0,"Nice, medium weight linen.  Size runs at least one size small.  Maybe it is more of a junior than a misses size, also."
3.0,Sizes run small. Tank is also not nearly as long as shown in the pictures.
3.0,It was odd that the sizing was 34-36. 34 is usually a medium and 36 is usually large. I was shooting for 32-34. They fit as if they were 32-34.
3.0,"It’s a beautiful dress, but it zips up from the side that should be a big X babies don’t do not like being zipped from the side I was afraid to zip some of her skin off. There should be a zipper from the back."
3.0,"I bought this bag as an early mothers day present, and my mom loves the bag.<br />Pros:<br />This bag is very large, it's actually a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. Which is good for what my mom does for work. The bag also has a very sturdy bottom, which is great. The price for this bag was also great, especially for the quality of it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> The bag has a weird smell to it, the smell isn't supper strong but it's there. I figured a nice spray from a vinegar water mix, and the smell will be gone. The bag is like a literal pit, there is two pockets and maybe a zippered pocket inside,  and that's it. I had to order a bag organizer  because it was so bad.  With a bag this large there needs to be more pockets or some kind of organization built into the bag. The shoulder strap that it came with was a little to short for my mom,  so we took what I read from another review, and used the crossbody strap instead."
3.0,"The dress was nice, material was good for the price. My girlfriend is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 135lbs, She normally wears a small but I  had to purchased a medium and it fits perfectly. My draw back to the dress is that it doesn't carry zipper at the back which made it difficult to put on. The dress will have to be fitted before she  do her hair and make up."
3.0,"To start off, this product is lightweight, durable, flexible, and has a good quality lens that does provide exceptional UV reduction.  They are very comfortable to wear while driving, or jogging, biking and doing calisthenics; they stayed in place on my face, while engaging in those exercise activities.<br /><br /> With that said, the glasses have not been made to have a exceptional or 'high-end style' aesthetic…they look a bit ‘cheap.’  The lens is a bit too big for people with medium to small features, and they are not ‘mirrored’ as the description indicates.  No one is going to mistake these sunglasses for the Maui Jim Sugar Beach sunglasses, which the style obviously emulates.<br /><br />I want to say again that functionally, I have been pleased with these sunglasses, especially considering how inexpensive they are."
3.0,Lived the style and look of pants. Just not a good fit if you have fatty hips. The fat rolls are emphasized in these. They are being returned
3.0,Love front zipper. Do not like feel of zipper on my skin. Kind of bulky in front also.
3.0,"Cute material seemed true to size, I got a L and it was too small for 36DD, XL wasn't available so I hoped for the best when ordering. 1 bad thing, the rouched stitching wasn't centered on the bottom which would have driven me nuts but I had to return anways, maybe it was just a defect on that pair of bottoms"
3.0,"Nice buckle, but the coins are upside down. When the buckle is attached to the belt, in order for the coins to be right-side-up, the belt needs to be placed through the belt loops the opposite direction from what is normal in the U.S.A."
3.0,I like zippered compression socks and bought these before. These are too long. They come up over the knee which is uncomfortable. The previous socks come about 1 and a half inches below the knee.
3.0,"These earrings were everything because they had THAT LOOK! The rose gold added an extra flare. I didn't give the earrings a 5 star rating because they had a Label that stated the these earrings were not intended for people under 14 years of age, although I appreciated the warning from the manufacturer (maybe because of lead, I don't know) It scared me a little. I did wear them one time to take a few pictures and my ears were fine, they won't sore (due to sensitivity to some metals.... or heavy)."
3.0,Kind of cute although I'm not sure how I would react if I woke up to find my partner wearing this eyemask.  It's the eye lashes that creep me out a bit. However I don't have to worry about this because I am the one wearing the mask.  It does keep the light out and makes it easier to sleep to my preferred time even as the days grow lighter and light.  The only real objection I have about it is there is no way to adjust the strap and it feels a little tight.
3.0,its oikay
3.0,"For the price, I think this is an ok deal for a tote bag/purse. The material used feels a little off and cheap, but I quess it could be worse. The bag itself is decently cute but not amazing. The straps don't stay folded down so they're always sticking up Which is a bit anoying, but it's also a bit bigger than I expected, which is good. I'm honestly not sure wether to give it a 2 or 3 because I like it, but it's not great. If this was 1-10 I'd give it a solid 4/10."
3.0,The wrist size was not right.
3.0,"Quality material very soft - similar to other compression tights at this price point. If looking for real compression, joint, and muscle support, explore other, more specialized products. You will pay a higher price for CWX and X2u, but worth it if need something more specialized.<br /><br />About the fit: I am 5’9”, 170, 31 waist and purchased a medium. Length is fine, thigh circumference is perfect, but the compression around the ankle is too loose, which I do not like at all. I’ll admit I have narrow ankles, but unless you have “fat” ankles (and 3” above the ankles) it will be a loose fit. Because of this I wouldn’t recommend for anyone who has a problem with this. This little “flaw” detracts from a “finished” look, no reason ankle should be so loose when the material stretches so much."
3.0,"Like all the other tempered glass screen protectors for the edge display, this protector has glue only around the edges. The glue is visible and eventually the edges will collect little bits of dust and lint. The protector feels nice and sturdy and it feels nice on your fingertips. The protector does pick up on fingerprints. You can see them when the screen goes black. I applied this protector on a few days ago and I already have a little scratch. So not very scratch resistant. Overall I am happy with the protector. It seems that no one has mastered the tempered glass protector for the s8 yet because all of the Amazon reviews for different brands of protectors are pretty much the same. I am just content with the fact that my phone has that extra bit of protection!"
3.0,"They came scratched at the nose bridge. I couldn't return them as I was in desperate need for a pair of glasses as my others broke and I needed them to go about my day. Im stuck with them now, but wish I had returned them."
3.0,"So disappointed !! Not what I was expecting for what I paid!! Sadly, I returned. Not flattering."
3.0,"The bridge of the glasses broke after three weeks of use.  Until then, they were great, but I would not buy another pair."
3.0,"I just received this.  It is HUGE!  I needed a purse, but this is more of an overnight bag.  That is what I will be using it for."
3.0,I would probably like this more if I knew how to use it. I tried and failed miserably. It was only few bucks to not even worth returning.
3.0,I used  this product to push  up n out.<br />Wore this under a halter top.
3.0,Get 1 size bigger.  They will stretch a little but I wish I would have ordered larger.
3.0,The bag is nice and will do the job but does not look as pictured. It is very dull and lacks the beautiful color the website shows. Kind of bummed.
3.0,Need to return way to big
3.0,Some of different sizes. Some not big enough. The shells were cracked in package.
3.0,"It's odd to say that something so tiny is too large, but you have to tie knots in weird places to make this thing fit.  It looks nice from the front once you figure it out, but I needed help from a friend getting it tied off in the back, and then it didn't want to stay in place very well.  There are several similar swimsuits that work better at the same price. Follow the link in my profile to see me trying to wear it."
3.0,So they are nice but the went down about a size and a half once i washed them on cold. They also don't breath that well it makes you spell down there if your area gets hot.
3.0,Kind of short!
3.0,"Good product for the price, but the color is not a true gopher maroon, but rather a red."
3.0,"I'm 6'3"" 250 lbs...and this is a small. My tall 7 year old will have to wait years to wear it."
3.0,"Love the look of the earrings but the beads are very delicate and tend to get pushed into the earpiece portion as you take them on or off and I’m going to have to glue them again in spots. I don’t mind, not sure how long they’ll last."
3.0,There were difficult to put on my GOODR sunglasses. I like the mountain design and color. I have not tested them to see if they float. Some reviews said they didn't float; my sunglasses are extremely light so I bet they do.
3.0,"I absolutely love this bag for the price. I originally purchased it in black and loved it so much I decided to buy it in brown as well. However, when the second bag arrived it was just as gorgeous as the first but it stank of fish! The entire bag, inside and out, reeks of fish! I’ve tried everything to get the smell out but it’s still lingering. :/"
3.0,I was disappointed in how it was made. The top was uneven and it had a sloppy fit. The material was beautiful. The main problem was the top it was sloppy and did not lay right.
3.0,It was too big for my son.The material is nice though
3.0,I brought Small but a little big for me.
3.0,Seems well made but way too small and tight for me.
3.0,"I gave this 3 stars because it does look like the picture for the most part. I’m not sure the flower bottoms are the right ones, there is barely any yellow color in them, looks like it is the orange bottoms. The fit of the flower bottoms is great though, it is fitted enough that it makes my butt look great. The yellow top and bottoms are horrible. The yellow bottoms fit weirdly, I personally don’t like them. The top is NOT meant for anyone that has boobs. I wear a 36 C and got a large but it didn’t matter how tight I pulled the strings, my boobs fell out as soon as I moved. A different size wouldn’t have made a difference. The circle pads inside are super unflattering. I can’t decide if I’m keeping this or not just because I really like the flower bottoms. If you’re curvy at all I wouldn’t suggest this swimsuit."
3.0,Are American heads bigger on what? Very disappointed it was too small. XL size is usually right for me. Maybe it's made by Asians and they have different ideas about body size?
3.0,Little wide for women sizing
3.0,It's ok but the voice is not loud so it's hard to hear and the motor is very very loud so if there is going to be the slightest noise around where you are placing the prop then I wouldn't recommend it.  Other wise the details are good.
3.0,Item arrived on time.<br />Little thinner than all my other Nike Men's Pro Combat Fitted Mock Neck Shirt.<br />But it's okay.
3.0,Great shirt. Awesome to workout in. Not $25 worth...very thin.
3.0,It doesn't have the same measurements in both sides. Looks kinda weird at the back. The material is good.
3.0,The mask is cute! Brenda-
3.0,I would have preferred a cotton material. These are huge! Size down.
3.0,"it's a neat piece to own, but, after a couple wears one of the spots on it broke."
3.0,Cute wore it out but it already rusted 😢
3.0,"It's OK. The cloth is a thin flannel, and would easily cling to leggings or tights. The scalloped waist adds inches to your waist, so keep that in mind. It also looks bulky beneath a sweater but an open cardigan would work with this. It's very soft, I have not washed it yet to see if it pils. Aside from the waist, the cut is cute. I normally wear a large and bought an xxl which fits comfortably."
3.0,"this works so long as you have double stick tape to tape your dress to your back, otherwise this strap creeps up and is not comfortable to wear - cuts into your stomach like control-top pantyhose."
3.0,Fits as expected but the material feels cheaper than I would have liked.
3.0,Delivered without mini screwdriver!
3.0,"Arrived fast, completely see through"
3.0,"The buttons are barely hanging on after trying the shirt on one time. It looks nice, it's super light, but if you don't want to lose the buttons you'll likely  have to re-sew all of them on before long."
3.0,Thought it would be heavier. But it's ok
3.0,"Make sure you buy a magnifier glass when you purchase this necklace so that you can see the diamonds.  Also, the bar rolls constantly."
3.0,stones came out.....
3.0,Very small and because they are silver they don't really show on the ears. Wouldn't but again
3.0,"This umbrella is very compact when closed, which is an enormous advantage for someone like me who usually stores everything in a backpack.<br /><br />However, the umbrella struggles to remain open; even moderate winds will cause the umbrella to collapse on itself, which is incredibly frustrating. Furthermore, the height of the umbrella is too small, which means you have to raise it more than normal to fit under (and I am average height)."
3.0,Purchase was somewhat a little big for my girl.  Ordered a medium and received a medium but somewhat large but overall not a bad T-shirt.  She will just have to tuck the shirt in and I believe it will be alright.
3.0,Not as good fit as blue one
3.0,Slippers a little toght
3.0,"I want to say that I like the quality of the bracelet and that it looks well made. After receiving it, I wish that instead of it saying ""To My Daughter"", and instead of using ""I"", that they had printed ""To Our Daughter"", and used ""we"", since it ends with ""Love, Mom & Dad"". If I had not adjusted the size already, I think I would've sent it back. Overall though, it is a nice bracelet."
3.0,Color came yellow not green at all.
3.0,Not a very comfortable band. It is ok for me because I occasionally wear watch.
3.0,"I did not how the discription was vague, I like how it looks. However it's not a valuable product. So it's a one time wear."
3.0,Like the vest but when you pull the draw string it's not good. It stitched very bad that it would be noticeable.
3.0,Peep hole not working otherwise the dress is lovely I will play with it a bit I’m 198 5’7 busty I bought an X-Large expected fit
3.0,had to send back they did not fit sizing if off
3.0,Too small<br />Nice color though<br />Had to return
3.0,Bought these as a gift for my mother and unfortunately after some use the fingertips fell off making them normal gloves.
3.0,"They're not all that bad for the price, but I have super skinny legs and I still felt like when I bent my knees they were too tight and not very comfortable. I'm returning them"
3.0,nice hat but should not be listed in the kids section. This hat was too big for my 9 yr old
3.0,"Looks nice, fits good, but a little stiff and scratchy.  Wore a camasole under it and it was perfect!"
3.0,Returned because they were too loose and bulky
3.0,Beautiful dress unfortunately the XLarge was too small. I wear 14-16 pants 194 pounds and it was too tight and not as flowy below the waist.  If I lost 10 pounds Im sure it'd have fit better but needed something asap so had to return.
3.0,Complicado para abrochar
3.0,"Sturdy wallet, but with just a few cars it is quite thick.<br /><br />Wallet should come with money so we know what it looks like inside the wallet and how to keep bills sorted."
3.0,Pretty cheap looking... but they were! 😜
3.0,I really like the way it looked on Amazon It was dark maroon burgundy color & sleek that's why I bought it but when I opened it the dress was red & like a cotton material...size was ok..was a nice dress for someone who likes that type of dress Me That's why I hate buying things on line.pictures always look good
3.0,I don't love this shirt.<br />What's good: The material is very soft. The color is so pretty.<br />What's not: The material is very thin. So thin that the bottom looks odd where the inside doens't overlap.
3.0,Too small I bought a small by mistake. The length is good but the waist was probably a size 4-6. I had to give them away. Next time I will get the correct size.
3.0,I read the reviews and ordered my normal<br />size an xl because most people said it was true to size it’s not I could hardly get it on it was so tight it was not comfortable at all! I will admit I am large busted so that does make a difference but it was tight everywhere I am thinking I should have gone at least one size bigger but maybe even 2 sizes bigger
3.0,Cute but cheap materials. One broke and I had to get supplies to fix it.
3.0,Not what I expected but ok. Shipment and packing was good but the quality not what I expected. It's ok.
3.0,"You can't beat the price, but no one who's ever seen or worn the Movado it imitates will be fooled, though I think the craftsmanship is good.  I bought it as a lark and certainly received full value for what I paid.  I ended up buying a Citizen &#34;Eco Drive&#34; that's similarly styled, but $250 more expensive, and probably overpriced.  If you want an inexpensive nicely styled watch, I don't think you can beat this one at the price."
3.0,"I'm 5'5"", 161lbs (give or take 1-2lbs but pretty stable), 29.5"" waist, 38.5/39ish hips, 36C chest.<br />I typically fall in the M/L area....usually get an 'L' in most clothing.<br />ALMOST grabbed the M in this because I see the fit and waist is super generous.<br />I would have been OKAY with an M but even with this 'S' I still feel like it looks a touch frumpy even with the waist tied as tight as I can get it.  It's a little plain but cute....simple style. I paid like $13 when I bought it.<br />I was going to get the pink in 'S' but seeing as it's basically $30 now (lmfao) I'll pass. I wouldn't dare spend  above $15 for this. That's not shade but the sudden and substantial price increase is staggering. It's cute/cute enough but neither $30 cute or $30 quality."
3.0,I don't like the wig that much.
3.0,It arrived with the clasp part broken. I'll have to try and fix it. Otherwise it's pretty much what you pay for.
3.0,Love the looks but his normal size 6 is way too tight
3.0,"It is a nice sweater, but it is short in length. I will be nice to work outside in without another layer under it."
3.0,They’re huge! I wear a 7 women’s are they’re really big for me.
3.0,"I returned this. I can't even describe the fit. Maybe I'm just too short for it... I'm 5'2"" the whole thing was just awkward."
3.0,This shirt fits awkwardly and is uncomfortable. The lettering is beautiful though.
3.0,Too thin in my opinion
3.0,"The sweater is absolutely beautiful quality. The perfect Irish sweater for my son. However, I bought the size for my 6yr old, (who is a smaller 6 too) and it ended up only fitting my almost 3yr old. I will keep it for him but if that’s the largest size I won’t buy another as I know it won’t fit. Just be aware you need to size up. Only giving 3 stars because if it doesn’t fit as it should then I can’t value the purchase."
3.0,"It was larger than what I expected. The material was very thin, I liked the color though."
3.0,Wore it to work and it kept slipping off my head. Would probably do the same if actually working out
3.0,"First of all this purse is absolutely beautiful! I put the chain shoulder strap on and within minutes the fastener on the purse broke so there was no fixing it. It can be a clutch as well but I liked the fact it had a shoulder strap as well. I put my cell phone and a few make up items in it, which wasn't much and the bottom of the purse pulled apart. It didn't break completely but it did pull apart at the bottom of the purse. I was afraid it was going to just bust open at the bottom but it never did. Outside of those two immediate problems I'll carry the purse again, no doubt."
3.0,El vestido salió con el zipper roto lo demás bellísimo
3.0,The colors are so bright and vibrant! It almost fits perfectly! The midsection is perfect!<br /><br />A couple things that kind of broke my heart....<br /><br />The sleeves only fit arm length comfortably when I keep my arms down... I don't think I have overly average arm length...  The cuffs come right to the wrist... If I had ordered a size bigger the midsection would have been too big. So guess I'll be keeping my arms down or pulling my sleeves up...<br /><br />Thread sticking out on a couple places right out of the package....
3.0,"Runs very large. Material is a bit on the cheap side so you get what you pay for. Otherwise, not so bad for just pulling an outfit together."
3.0,The inner lining is very wick and damaged well after a few days.
3.0,The description said to buy a size up but I knew that I wanted it really snug so I bought a large which I typically go with and it was barely snug.
3.0,not adjustable...so was way too large for a 13 year olds wrist.
3.0,"I'm looking for the perfect cooling bra.  This isn't it.  The top is comfortable (and maybe too big), but the band under the breast is too tight and makes back fat look even worse.  I will admit that it may not be the bra's fault, but perhaps my body shape is just not &#34;average&#34;."
3.0,The gauges are super cute but it says stainless steel and nickel free but they definitely tarnished and turned my ears green
3.0,"I love this, but it hangs differently than the picture and the stitching fell apart after a couple of wears. The company was so good to me though, they refunded my money and didn't ask for the item back. This is a classy company!"
3.0,To small but looked nice
3.0,I'm a small woman and it almost fits like a skull cap.  Definitely not as pictured.
3.0,Didn’t think they were what I paid for them.  They ripped very easily.
3.0,Who buys one sand Sandal?  I missed it In the description because I assumed sandals would come in pairs. Now I have to travel to Costa Rica in 2 days for a wedding with one beach sandal.
3.0,"Fit as expected but was a challenge to zip without help, the fabric was a little stiff and not what I expected but in the end I was able to wear it to my grandfathers funeral, and it worked out great"
3.0,It's a nice sweater but runs very small. If you want the sweater to fit like the picture order 2 sizes bigger. Fiber quality not the best either.
3.0,"as the description NOW says, there are no bottoms, the skirt is just a skirt. This is odd."
3.0,He has been wearing them for couple of weeks now and I am not really happy with the soles they are pealing and wearing down already.
3.0,It's just okay.
3.0,They work.. they cost very little.  But the quality is low..i lose these things so I'm fine with that but  they are this so so stitching..they don't clean glasses well.. but if you lose one a month between you and the kids..they are just fine.
3.0,"The picture makes them look more black, but when I got them they were red."
3.0,Sizing wasn’t quite right. Too small
3.0,"It's cute if it wasn't made wide, not as shown or describe in picture"
3.0,Right for my daughter. Order the next size up.
3.0,The posts didn't fit very well and I lost an earring right away. :-(
3.0,I like the shoe but they run really big. They look like clown shoes on me.
3.0,Worked as intended. Didn't look too bad once it had a little brush
3.0,Much thinner than I expected.  Returned and bought a more expensive one.  This is a reputable company but you get what you pay for.  Gold is really expensive so set your expectations appropriately.
3.0,Cute but cheaply made. It's basically a furry black onsie with cheap white bones poorly sewn on with threads everywhere.
3.0,"The coat was nice and fit well in the upper body but, was too small around the hips. I had to return it."
3.0,It is ok. I bought a larger size than I normally do and am glad I did. Fits small. I had to lace the shirt up upon arrival and the ends of the lace were slightly frayed making it a task that took longer than it should have. I don't care for the strap around the neck. I want to cut it off but am afraid it will mess the shirt up completely. Will wear this for one occasion that I bought it for and that will probably be it.
3.0,"The upper wrapping material is quite short. After wrapping around, the end can not even meet.<br />I like the style and material, though."
3.0,"At night, the light doesn't light the screen enough to see all the numbers, just the hour number. Easy to read, just not in the dark. Other than that, good for basic use during any well lit time or place."
3.0,Seemed a little cheap looking. Clasp broke right away.
3.0,The fabric information stated 100% cotton but actual fabric had polyester and spandex added.
3.0,This shirt is super cute but it smelled like deodorant and perfume and had a stain on the sleeve. I have ordered another one but what a hassle to receive a used item that I have to go return now.
3.0,The buckle is much smaller than expected.
3.0,"Jewelry was pretty, but the pearls seem too big. In the picture they actually look like real pearls, but in person, they look very fake. Have metallic color to them. I really wanted something with pearls to match my wedding dress, but and sending them back to get a different set without the pearls."
3.0,The dress wrinkles.
3.0,"Very pretty. I expected them to be a little larger for the price (the picture provided in the listing is deceptive), but the quality is good and they are Sterling Silver. Lightweight, too. I have gotten compliments already!"
3.0,very small and made out of cheap plastic. i thought they would be metal :-(
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Shoes are super cute. However, I wore them twice and then the soles started coming apart from the base of the shoe. Lesson learned. I will purchase a pair of Tom's or Bob's in the future."
3.0,The chain is discolored showing its cheap but the tag is great
3.0,They are ok. I got the wrong size somehow. Also they are made out of cheap material. I will wear them but I bought a different pair on amazon for a little more money that was definitely worth it.
3.0,How the h3!! Do I get this necklace on?!?!!its so cute I just have no idea how to wear it. It needs instructions !!!
3.0,Good quality but the pants are too short for my 8 year old.  I ordered the correct size.  Another brand in same size worked much better.
3.0,"It broke apart when I tried to put it on. The slightest tug on the chain will result in it coming apart. I had to go out and get a new chain because I really wanted to like this product. Once I fixed it was OKAY, butt he material is very itchy."
3.0,The dress was fine. I didn't like the fit on me but my daughter was able to wear it.
3.0,I love the design I love the sparkle. But it will not lock in place. They keep sliding up and down it's like it needs a little latch or something underneath the one that moves.
3.0,"Tight on the waist. The pockets aren't any good, they're really small. Size L"
3.0,"Love the concept...in fact, this had me shopping for ""normal"" sunglasses again in hopes that I could turn any of them into bifocals.  However, the dream is over.  One of the stick-on lenses isn't conforming to the sunglasses lens, which as you can see in the picture, creates a very annoying zone in my field of view.  I tried a few things to resolve this:<br /><br />1) removed both of the stick-on lenses, and then re-applied without the water.  This worked pretty well, actually...until one of them fell off.<br />2) warm and cold water - i tried various temps of water...no dice.  The same 'gap' would appear.<br />3) switched lenses - I swapped left for right...nope, same problem.  The same stick on lens wouldn't conform.<br />4) other glasses - I tried them on other glasses, thinking it could just be an issue with these sunglasses...nope.  same problem.<br /><br />Ultimately, my guess is that I got a bad pair...which is unfortunate...but it also could say something about the quality of materials or the ahesive method itself (putting a drop of water between lenses, then drying the excess water).<br /><br />I suppose I'm back to hunting for bifocal sunglasses...which do exist, and are quite good...they just tend to have limited style options and a really good pair can cost you."
3.0,Still trying to decide whether or not I want to return this because it's sort of cute and doesn't look horrible but overall a pretty bizarre dress. The material along with the bright colors makes me feel like I bought a costume.
3.0,IT COULD BE BETTER
3.0,It's okay for the price.
3.0,The cropped length is perfect and the sleeves are a nice lose fit.  It has a different fabric in the armpit area which helps this top breathe. However the body area is cut quite wide.  It bothered me anough that with a little sewing I altered it.  The fabric is soft and comfortable.
3.0,"I wear a large in most women's clothing (shirts, pajamas, etc.) and this suit fits perfect, a little snug in the bust, but meets expectations. It's hard to give a good review of a product that you JUST purchased and haven't had a chance to put it up to the wear/tear test."
3.0,Looks cool. Quality not bad as per the price.<br />But in actual it doesn't glow much in dark.<br />Probably one has to be in complete darkness to get see a bit of orangish glow.
3.0,The size chart to Me is off I bought larger to fit and found out it is to big
3.0,"Very cute, but runs small. I wear 12 order the size , Icouldn't get it past my hips. I reordered I'm waiting on the new size"
3.0,"The bottoms on this swimsuit are legit! They look awesome. The top, however, is made a little odd. The extra black overlay on the white swimsuit is a good idea in theory but this just looked odd and not like it should go together. It was also a little small and just fit weird. The white part fit nicely but once I added the black part tied over top it like push my boobs into weird places and wanted to ride up giving me under boob. I kept the wonderful awesome bottoms and thru the top away."
3.0,"The seams of the inner jacket are not well finished, all of them have loose threads. In addition, the sweater has a discoloration on the shoulder.<br />The external jacket is better."
3.0,These are amazing glasses and the only ones my mom likes for her advanced macular degeneration but the arm keeps breaking! It's not attached securely. We've been through three pairs already!
3.0,Run a little big and don't fit as snug as many other brands
3.0,but these sunglasses as a gift. The person I bought a floor said it was okay
3.0,Box was smashed up disappointed because I store my shoes in them. Shoes are ok for the price range would buy again if they hold up.
3.0,"I like the color and it feels like a durable scarf, seems like it will last a while, but it isn't as soft or fluffy as I was hoping. It's knitted tightly and very dense feeling."
3.0,"A little shorter than expected. Also, material was a bit thin."
3.0,"Amazon suggested i would be a Large size, but they're too small, i just can't get used to pulling them up. i'm hoping the seller will trade for a size up."
3.0,"I have two pairs, the navy marl and the marine blue marl. I absolutely love the marine blue marl, so soft and I get so many compliments on them. But the navy marl are completely different. They are so uncomfortable and so rough on the skin. They're also not as flattering. Depending on which color you get, you'll either love it or hate it."
3.0,Fit good but the color was off I ordered a red and it wasn't really red it was more of a orangish red
3.0,Great bag cute look but my zipper broke same day 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️
3.0,I think it fit the baby okay. No complaints from my sister-in-law.
3.0,This is a playful pretty watch. It definitely has a little bling if you're going for that look. I think it's fine for casual day to day wear. My problem is that the watch is huge. I've messed up in the past buying boyfriend watches by Geneva and thought this one is listed as a women's watch so certainly it'll be more dainty... Wrong! Now I still can't wear it until I can get it sized.
3.0,"As described, but I guess I was expecting a little bit more for $30... not much more, but a bit more for sure. It's definitely a 'China' watch, you know what I mean if you have other 'China' watches. LED is the same as all other 'China' watches.  I would have preferred to pay a little less. It'll be more of a novelty watch that I might wear a few times... but sure shipped fast and made it here in a hurry!"
3.0,I bought this for a diy snow-white outfit for halloween. So it definitely served its purpose. It fit good and felt good wearing it. BUT I was a little disappointed in the material of the skirt itself. It seemed like cheap costume material is the only way I can explain it.
3.0,I didn’t notice this shirt was from 2019 not 2020 the shirts sold should be from 2020 not 2019. The shirt was very soft and fit well
3.0,"The key circle, ring, and keys were in perfect condition but the box they were held in looked like it's corner was stomped on. And for the keys themselves: all of them look amazing except for the top half of Scorpio, Capricorn looks like a knock-off Aries, and then Pieces and Libra don't look like what they do in Fairy Tail."
3.0,too fake looking!
3.0,Came in very wrinkled. The quality of the fabric was bad. Its a Chinese product shipped from California. Larger than I thought.
3.0,"The sizing on this was disappointingly way off. It's way too much of a slim-fit design. I could barely get it over my shoulders and midsection and I'm fairly average sized. If you're a little dude, this will be awesome for you. If you have moderately wide shoulders or even a little bit of a spare tire, don't bother. It won't be flattering if it fits at all. The design is nice. The fabric is nice. The fit is not. Three stars."
3.0,"I did like the dress, it ran small in the bust area."
3.0,Very thin for a winter coat and made oddly. I noticed that it was kinda up in the back when my daughter tried it on .
3.0,"It’s cute, but the chain broke after 2 times wearing it."
3.0,"If you don't size up, the leggings stretch real thin at the hips and you can see your underwear through them. I would also like these better if the bones matched up with where my actual bones are more. The xray illusion could be much better, but they're okay."
3.0,"i love the look but it does very much feel cheap, im a dental assistant and wear it 24/7 so im constantly washing my hands and has yellowed on me yet."
3.0,The glasses seem to make things look amber or yellow but not much clearer. I tested them against a pair of<br />reading glasses. Other than making things look yellow the night optics performed not much better than the reading glasses.
3.0,the product is NOT what I expected
3.0,I love the message on this t-shirt. The fit is tight & the neck is too high/tight. It is not a women's size or shape for t-shirts.
3.0,Nice but the quality was not as I had expected
3.0,Very cute suit.  The material is good quality and the fit is good and flattering.  My only problem was that I didn't fill out the chest area so there was no support.  Even little ones need support!  I think for larger chests the suit it's self may offer some support but there was nothing built into it for support.  For reference I'm 130 and 32C.  The bottoms were great and I like that the straps on the top were adjustable.
3.0,"Cute dress, but I can wear it since it is too tight. I bought the size I normally wear. Honestly not even sure if the next size up would zipper."
3.0,"they dont have a way to stay in place and look fitted, they bunch up and are loose under the collar."
3.0,"Nice looking pair of sunglasses. Unfortunately not the best quality, I bought 4 pairs and neither of them didn't last for more than a few months. Rims get broken out of nowhere."
3.0,Watch not working supposed to have a new battery.. Still need to bring to store to replace new one.. Kinda dissapointing.. Other than that it'/ cute though.
3.0,"Looks cheap but for the cost, it’s ok"
3.0,"The necklace is light weight enough and pretty, but nothing to shout about.  It didn't go with the blouse I had in mind, but may work with other things.  The earrings are rather matronly looking, so I will not wear them.  They remind me of the old clip earrings my grandmother wore in the 1960's.  The colors are accurate, there are no sharp edges to the necklace, and the latch works well."
3.0,"Although the sizing I small, this is a good quality bralet. It doesn't have underwire but has side supports and a thick band at the bottom that should hold you in. It has no clasps or hooks. It has wide shoulder bands to cut down on straps cutting into you. It has a thin padding over the breast area but not too much. The fabric is super soft. The sizing is just on the smaller size."
3.0,"I like it, although the colours aren't as saturated as seen in the pictures."
3.0,"It is what expected, but is made for a small person. Great, just would’ve been nice to fit an average sized person."
3.0,"The purse is super cute! I was attracted to the huge mark down thinking I would get a $$$ quality purse but instead I got a $ quality purse. The straps are thin and flimsy, they won't wear well."
3.0,Warm pants! Size runs smaller than normal.
3.0,"Ehhhh. No thanks. The whole para-cords and faux fur...doesn’t make sense at all. Somethingluffy and soft shouldn’t have big elastics with sharp plastic hanging off everywhere. Also, the smell was noticeable upon opening, and there is exactly ZERO inner lining. Doesn’t feel good against the skin at all."
3.0,"Fit loose on me, and the when your wearing the facemask you can't see anything directly in front of you, and can't see much at all. I've taken the facemask off, as it's more hassle than it's worth. Not a bad hat for the price though all in all."
3.0,Snags my clothes all the time.
3.0,"The medal buckle part is too big, other then that its good"
3.0,Sleeves too short and not true to size
3.0,"This is a great shirt. Thick, comfy and it looks good. However I ordered a XXL and the sleeves are just too long and the cuffs are rather wide. I wear 35/36 arm length dress shirts and even still when I roll them all the way up to the inner lining the sleeves on this shirt are still too long."
3.0,"I wish they had a better pic to see the size of these, they are way bigger than what my teen was wanting. Oversized is an understatement. These are jollybgreen giant, Halloween clown costume size."
3.0,"I love the concept of the shirt but it's just too wide and the material is too stiff, so it doesn't lay well for as wide as it is and it just doesn't quite work, I was really bummed because I love the stripes and the ruffles. I actually thought it looked cuter on backwards with there being a little V-neck but not cute  I love the concept of the shirt but it's just too wide and the material is too stiff, it doesn't lay well for as wide as it is and it just doesn't quite work, I was really bummed because I love the stripes and the ruffles. I actually thought it looked cuter on backwards with there being a little V-neck but not cute enough to keep it, it just looks like a tent."
3.0,The ONLY reason this shirt is getting 3 stars because the overall material quality was not that bad. Everything else was. The stitching was awful. They sewed the size tag/washing instruction label to the outside of the shirt. The straps were seen terribly and felt flimsy.<br /><br />You can definitely tell that this was a fast fashion shirt. I returned it.
3.0,I really liked it..but thought it would be heaver..more substantial..but still nice
3.0,"I was happy with the fit of the shirr, but the bottoms are way too small. I thought the elastic would stretch out in the bottoms after a few wears, but instead the bottoms chaffed the creases between my 9yos legs pretty badly and she will not even put the bottoms on now."
3.0,"I added a picture of it next to a 20g nose stud i have. It definitely larger probably 18g.<br />Not super upset about that because I’ll still use them.<br />Only some of them I can unscrew so I am hoping with pliers I’ll be able to unscrew them, and they aren't just made incorrectly."
3.0,"This was nice quality, but I had to return it as it was skin tight. I bought an XL - and usually wear a medium. This would be fine if you were going to cover it up with a jacket and are not self-conscious about tight clothing."
3.0,The length was shorten than expected but overall it’s comfortable.
3.0,"Fit was fine, but they did slip off the heels and bunched up in my shoes."
3.0,"I got a yellow and red skirt. I weight 125, and usually wear a small but these two skirts were more like a size 0. Both skirts have beautiful vibrant colors, but unfortunately they didn't fit☹️ I will try ordering an XL and see if they fit."
3.0,"The top hems tend to fall wherever they feel like, and shift around to unflattering positions. The dress is a bit too large on me, and I'm not sure if this would happen if it actually fit.<br /><br />The description when I bought it claimed that the dress was cotton, but it's actually rayon.<br /><br />I do like the swingy skirt portion, though."
3.0,"So the screen fits well enough, but the big glaring issue is the distortion it does to your Retina display. It makes everything look slightly pixelated. Like you're looking at an old 1990s CRT tv up close. Or a Sony WEGA or something.<br /><br />At least it keeps coworkers prying eyes at bay."
3.0,Bigger than described. And the material was very flimsy.
3.0,"Great for stadium games, but some of the corner gold buttons fell off after 1st use."
3.0,"Pluses:<br />- Love the looks - my favorite of the (4) cases I have so far tried.<br />- The US Flag printing looks very well done and seems durable.<br />- The hard surface on the back bonds well to my magnetic mount's steel plate.<br />- Fits the phone well and is not nearly as thick as some other hybrid cases<br />- raised rubber lip provides face-down protection of the glass screen<br /><br />Minuses<br />-  The plastic back is hard and slippery.  The molded ridges help a bit, but I wish for more grip<br />- The black rubber is too hard to help afford much of a grip, hampered further by only having a small edge of rubber toward the screen surface.<br />-  Aux jack hole will not accept most standard 3.5mm headphone plugs, even the ones with the bevel recess.  This is partly because the hole is too small, and the case is too thick.  My solution was to Dremel the hole to enlarge it sufficiently.<br />-  The volume up/down buttons are very stiff, and don't stick out very far.  I slotted above/below each of the rubber buttons with a #11 X-acto knife.  This helps the stiffness, but doesn't completely resolve the buttons because they don't stick out far enough."
3.0,"more impressive picture than wearing the ring, to small, returned it to possibly order a much larger stone"
3.0,"This is really cute, but holy side boob! Due to the high neck and T-cut, the cups come in on the sides. If you are doing anything more than walking at 3.5 mph and do not have full coverage tank on, be prepared for 70% of your headlights to be hanging out the sides ;) I am not a busty gal (34 B/C) I bought large, took out the pads and wear them under my rocker tanks. These tanks would be perfect for someone whose boobies only face front and center without budging."
3.0,"The fabric is good and it fit my booty, hips, thighs, calves, all of that nicely.  However, there was a little too much extra space in the front that made them kinda saggy, only in the front. Almost like they were made for men. Stinks because the color is beautiful and the material is nice. I like to tuck my shirts in, but if you like longer, flowy shirts, than this product would be great for you!"
3.0,Smaller than expected. Came with a hole in it!
3.0,Black underwear are a must.
3.0,"This is a cute dress if you have small to average breasts. But if you are large breasted, it simply will not work. The lining in the breast area is quite confining. Ordering a size up just gives you a saggy dress with an overly tight chest. Really wanted to lije it."
3.0,The necklace was very pretty but it is slightly small.  It didn't fit around my neck.
3.0,Does not come with strap to attach to luggage. I guess will use zip tie-
3.0,"Fit as expected. I just do not like the light blue shirt. If you sweat a lot, it is very noticeable. These type of shirts should only have dark colors. Its my only suggestion."
3.0,"Size would fit a small adult or child, it’s kindve tight for me, being a 5’11 woman.<br /><br />It’s decent quality. Filled with super soft stuffing i saved for later craft use. I bought it to strip pieces from for a last minute custom headpiece.<br /><br />Im confused by the plastic strap that attaches on each side of the “headband”, i think it’s supposed to be a chin strap because it doesn’t look right if you wear it behind your head. Being a chin strap, expect a nice double chin while wearing this lol"
3.0,Nice looking ear rings but my wife tells me that the diameter makes them uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,"Very soft, well fitting gloves.  Unless it's cold.  Does NOT work against freezing type temperatures.  I'm sure they are great for just a cool day.  Also touchscreen capability works about half the time."
3.0,Didn't fit like the ones I had purchased at Walmart.
3.0,"I like these pajamas, although they’re a bit heavy"
3.0,"I always thought that threads were small chains.  I never expected it to have the hook in the middle of the chain, which I don't care for.  The ruby looks pretty cheap too.  Was not overly impressed with the quality."
3.0,"Nice sweater, ugly buttons.  Debated on keeping sweater and replacing buttons, but decided it’s not worth the effort. Bought white and navy.  Returning both."
3.0,Looks good and fits well but starts to discolor after a while.
3.0,The shirt is ok.  It is see through so you might want to wear something under it and it does run kind of tight so I'd size up if you don't want that skin tight look.
3.0,"This robe is shorter than pictured. We were specifically looking for a robe that's length went to just above the knee,"
3.0,Not as tapered toward the ankle as pictured
3.0,"These do enable you to button what would otherwise be unbuttonable shirts.  Problems -- (1) they are hard to use, I find that it can take me a minute or more to get them working, (2) they stick into your neck, although after some playing, that gets better.  A good thing -- you get a package of ten, and you really only need one.  So, you can stick one in your dresser, one in the car, one in the office desk, one in the suitcase, etc.  At least you are sure to have it when you suddenly have to put on a tie, a didn't realize that your shirt collar was too small."
3.0,"They are super cute... but I can't even get the balls off the bigger leaf ones. I also can't get my fingers in my ear to screw on the ball for my Tragus. Other than that, I'm okay with the purchase."
3.0,Smelled of smoke.
3.0,not for larger size shoes
3.0,Uncomfortable. Keeps sliding down my nose. Not a fan. Going to find something else
3.0,Does need to be ironed after washing!
3.0,But was over sized.
3.0,"Its worth the investment to go with some luggage that has 4 wheels on the bottom. These suitcases only have 2 fixed wheels at the base. Their construction and material would  not last with prolonged usage. These are functional, but I'd only recommend them for someone who rarely travels ad is just looking to save money."
3.0,Husband is big guy it a little too high in front
3.0,"Good quality for costume glasses, but very small - essentially a children's size."
3.0,"I absolutely love the necklace, it's perfect and exactly what I wanted. However, after only wearing it three times it's beginning to turn. I'm so very disappointed in the quality that I can't even get a whole summer's worth of wear out of it. I expected more."
3.0,The suit is a bit too big
3.0,It’s nice shirt
3.0,"My kid loved it but it is so ill fitting. The shirt is fine and the waste of the shorts is ok, but they are so long they look like pants."
3.0,I feel like a bad boy!
3.0,"The design on this jacket is really cute, and just as pictured. I am normally a size 6-8, so I ordered an 8 for a slightly looser fit.<br />Unfortunately it fit like a size 4. I would advise ordering 1-2 sizes larger than your normal size!"
3.0,"As noted by other customers, this watch band needs to be<br />longer.  I can only use the first notch.  This makes the<br />band snug.<br /><br />The manufacturer needs to make the bands longer."
3.0,"Perhaps my fault for not reading description fully, but these are very tiny stones, more for a small child than an adult.  Lovely though.  Shipping was quick."
3.0,"These are comfortable and somewhat warm socks. However, like many other customers have reported, they do not stay up very well due to the roll top. I have fairly small calves so maybe others would have better luck. I find myself hiking them up a lot because it feels like they are falling down."
3.0,Beautiful beanie but very small. I have a small head and I can only wear it for short periods of time before it starts hurting. The sound is great and it was easy to pair.
3.0,Thought they were bigger but they are really pretty...
3.0,"It's an ok hat. Not itchy which is nice, but nothing spectacular. The grey is more purple then I expected, but it's still pretty."
3.0,great price but shipping took a long time
3.0,This shirt is cute but short. Kind of a square shape. I don’t care for how it looks.
3.0,Not worth $25. Material is thin and unlike many maxis I have purchased that are $25+ this one doesn’t have that extra length that others do. I’m returning this dress for a size bigger and hope the length will be closer to the ground. I purchased a small and It’s about 4” off the ground and I am barely 5’4”
3.0,They are well made.  They are small & tight fitting for size 13.  I think they will stretch as I wear them.
3.0,"If you're looking for cute and a good price this is your buddy. If you're looking for a long lasting/warm scarf, pick something else."
3.0,It's alright. The jacket looks much better in the picture. The elastic waist is little annoying.
3.0,"Pretty disappointed in the color. Not as vibrant as shown. Not sure I'll wear them. Otherwise, they seem decently made."
3.0,"My son feels comfy but the front part of the slippers are too big for the skinny feet.  If you have a chubby feet, the slippers will be right for you."
3.0,It's a lot shorter than it appears in the picture and is more orange than coral. It's still very cute and a fun necklace.
3.0,They are very flimsy.
3.0,"It fits the waist fine, but the holes for your legs have elastic bands, too, so if you’re someone whose thighs are a little thicker (like mine) then these won’t fit well or won’t fit at all"
3.0,Very very wrinkly hard to get out all of the wrinkles it needs to be ironed every time. Material is soft and thin and nice but pockets are kind of weird.
3.0,"Nice, but tight and I don’t even have a big head."
3.0,"This scarf is pretty. The color is something like a muted paprika. I thought it looked like something a bit fuller than what it actually is, but it is more of a long thin scarf than a square type scarf. The fabric is sort of scratchy and not as smooth as I would like. I will wear this over clothes as an accent piece but not wrapped multiple times around my neck for warmth. It just doesn't feel great on my skin."
3.0,"This is the biggest medium I have even seen, it looks like a 3X!  Color is nice but I've ordered other oversized items and I think even an XS would be oversized on me.  I could literally fit 2 of me in it and have room.  Not sure what the thought process for this was because if it ran true to size I would love it.  The color is pretty, stitching is nice but just overly oversized I'm 5""4 140lbs"
3.0,"I received an email from the company offering a refund due to my dissatisfaction with the product……for this quality in customer service I give 5 stars….I continue to state the hat and gloves are much thinner than I expected and doesn’t represent the photo…that being said the company is A-one, as you do not find this customer care these days…..<br />——————————————————————————————————————————-<br /><br />Not worth the cost…what’s with this thin summer cashmere costing an enormous amount…all these products manufactured for 1$, worth 5$ and sold for 90$....inferior quality…I expected a thicker winter more substantial cashmere hat and gloves….the packaging is lovely and more substantial than the content, but not needed—for me-what a waste…I am so very disappointed, product fails to meet my expectations….I do not recommend…go to the second hand store-Goodwill and see if they have….that is what I will do now…."
3.0,"This dress is okay, but back puffs out when you slept it. There's absolutely no shape to this dress."
3.0,It's not true to size. I'm very disappointed bc i thought these looked very similar to the ones I have that were discontinued. They are soft but sizing is off.
3.0,"The reviews said it fit big so I tried a medium, but need a large. The material is somewhat see through in the gray. Please stock darker colors (not red) in large size and I will buy. I love the high neck and knee length with long sleeves."
3.0,"When I ordered this product 3 days ago, there were no reviews (& now there are 8 reviews) for this product, but there were 2 'answered questions' (& now there are 5), which were misleading.  My order did not arrive in ""FDA certified Class 1 packaging with 10 pieces per Sterile Sealed Pouch"", but arrived with all 50 masks crammed into one flimsy plastic wrap.  I also got the impression, because the info was so limited, and because the seller is a Medical Licensed Manufacturing facility since 2007, that the masks were made in the USA, but they were made in China.  The mask does hold water, as another review mentioned, so I'm guessing that should keep my germs in, and other people's germs out; and it does not have the big gaps on the side like my previous mask did.  I felt deceived when these masks arrived labeled ""Anti Dust Mask"", but I tried one, and it's ok, I guess, since it holds water.  It's also labeled ""FILREATION [sic] EFFICIENCY 95% .  I even raised the rating stars from 1 to 3 as I wrote this review (when I began writing, I would have given 0 stars if that were possible)."
3.0,"Like the dress, but ran real small."
3.0,I like my target style of these boxers more as they are about double the thickness of these and just feel nicer.  However these are an alright second choice.  Definitely run small.  I ordered medium and usually wear small boxers - 28-30&#34; waist and these are a little too snug for real comfort.
3.0,"Cute, but doesn't look like what's on the model."
3.0,It's a little pinker thank the picture shows.  A soft pink (like the picture) would have been nice.
3.0,One battery was dead on arrival.
3.0,"Definitely not a Michigan weather coat. Is not as thick as it looks here, rather thin to have fur on it. Very tight in the sleeve area even for someone with small arms."
3.0,"The shoes i got were way too small, didn't feel like returning item because they were very nice for the price so I gave them as a gift. Father is stoked with them. I'm gonna reorder just a size or 2 bigger."
3.0,I needed this color purse to match outfits for a business trip. The material is VERY stiff and has a strong chemical odor to it that still hasn't dissipated much.
3.0,"Somehow the extra large is both too large and too small. I'm tall and thin. I wanted correct sleeve length, but X large is huge around the waist. I'll use it for pajamas instead."
3.0,Eh. It fits ok bc the straps are adjustable but it just isn’t flattering
3.0,"The material was a little too clingy for me. I have lumps and bump I'd rather hide and you would definitely need to wear shapewear under it. It is a nice weight, not heavy but not so thin that you'd be cold either. The color is a nice rich maroon and did not fade when washed. I did hang to dry and needed to iron."
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes up and it is still somewhat tight and very short. Was hoping it would come down to/cover my butt like the picture.
3.0,They are well made. They look classy and pretty but got to be heavy by the end of my work day.
3.0,Fit a bit awkward
3.0,"As a glove, they are warm enough. The fit is odd; some fingers fit yet others don’t and that’s includes the thumb, which doesn’t reach the pads for using a touch screen. It’s not user error as a teen and 2 adults tried them on with the same result. Haven’t been able to get the gloves to work with any touchscreen we have tried."
3.0,Will not fit around a 38” waist maybe 32” max. I thought I checked the sizing before ordering so I’m pretty disappointed.
3.0,"Very thick material. Can feel the seems, especially in the crotch lining. The legs are a bit loose. Not bad for the price. Just not super comfy either."
3.0,Doesn't fit. Way to small. However costumer service was good about resolving the problem no issues with that.
3.0,Really big gauge for a nose ring pretty but won't work for what  advertised :-(
3.0,"This socks are good quality, My daughter likes wearing her knee high socks to school. They are soft and well made. The only reason I gave them a 3, we ordered the white pair and they came with a yellow look. Not what we were hoping for."
3.0,They are great color and the lenses are the perfect darkness. The screw came out of the arm after two weeks and are now waiting for a repair.
3.0,"These are cute, but run small and are really kind of &#34;sexy booty shorts&#34;.  So, not for a 45 year old to wear gardening."
3.0,"Very nice.  I didnt like that it has parts that come off, i lost one of the legs and its too bad because i like them a lot."
3.0,Comfortable just too short
3.0,It fits ok. Thinner material than what the picture looks like. The belt is a loose sash to tie around. Probably won't buy another color.
3.0,"If you have larger than an A cup, this will not even begin to cover anything.  But it's still cute worn other something else or with a bra."
3.0,Nice color. Won't be ordering another pair like it though
3.0,Size up. I want to love this dress but the bodycon is no joke! In white there is nowhere to hide 😂 and the lining at the chest is very short- only covers 3/4 of my 36C chest.<br />I wouldn't buy this unless I was very small
3.0,Overall look not at all what photo is
3.0,"Usually I am a medium in everything, so that’s the size I ordered. It ended up fitting so weird. I am highly suggesting people order a size DOWN. Also invest in a steamer because is holds on to wrinkles like crazy."
3.0,"I thought it was lovely. Nice quality, great looking. Unfortunately, the person for whom I bought it did not agree. Therefore, it was returned. Personally, I highly recommend it!"
3.0,"The shirt itself is really nice, but it is very small. If your a small I'd recommend to either get a medium or a,large to be safe."
3.0,"Bigger than I thought they would be. Not really ""studs."""
3.0,"I bought these because my boat shoes have higher tops and show less foot. I was hoping they'd stay on my foot better if they covered more of the foot... But they don't. They will come completely off when you try to take your shoes off, and will likely fall off while in the shoe if you walk around a lot. You can't see them with my boat shoes, but they still fall off very easily...<br /><br />Still looking for a good pair of actual &#34;no show&#34; boat socks.<br /><br />Also, they came in a weird Chinese package... I don't think they were actually &#34;Allegra K&#34; (if that's a brand, I don't know). They look slightly different from the image, too."
3.0,It fits a little too big in the waste area and looks awkward. I’m going to try shrinking it in the dryer so it won’t fit so big in the waste area.
3.0,"I was hoping that the actual pendant would have some sort of natural imperfection, but it is completely clear and looks like glass! Not quite what I expected from looking at the sample. I had to take it off the little rope it came with, because it started coming apart after 4 days... it's now on a leather band."
3.0,very pretty hat--butvery small. It would only sit on top of my head
3.0,"the dangling beads fell off the first time I wore it, but besides that it was awesome"
3.0,Don't know why I thought this would be cuter in person. Lol Looks just like the ad. I am not crazy about it at all. However it is heavy and feels quality. I kept it for whatever reason.
3.0,"3 stars because I'm not satisfied with the size of the flower. It's smaller than the picture showed on baby's head. :-( nevertheless, it is gorgeous on my baby."
3.0,"The hat was fine, but I wanted the bright orange and what I got was a dull, almost rusty color. It just didn't work for me."
3.0,These earrings are very nice quality but the colors are much darker than shown in picture
3.0,"Color and style are nice. The fit is a bit awkward due to the structure and design.  The bottom band seems off around the seams that makes it fit a bit weird there.<br />Love the color pattern, lightweight material with the hood to wear on a nice cool comfortable day or evening."
3.0,Unfinished edges.....we'll see how long they last
3.0,"They're just OK. The actual quality of the lenses, frames is pretty good and it comes with a couple of cool accessories (a clear plastic case, a nice fabric bag, a eyeglasses adjustment tool) but I tried them on a variety of eyeglasses and they don't fit that great. The sunglasses won't fold down flat against any glasses I own and stay partially flipped up. I finally resorted to zip-tying the sunglasses' bridge to that of my eyeglasses to keep it flush, which defeats the purpose of the flip-up feature."
3.0,"Such a cute style but I have MAJOR side cleavage. If you are a true D or DD, you too can plan on the same."
3.0,I am an XL on any unisex shirts so I also normally go for XLs when it comes to womens shirts. This shirt says it is in XL but fits way more like an M. Its definitely NOT true to size. Still cute thought.
3.0,not soft at all....like at all
3.0,they're ok. a little flimsy and wide
3.0,"if it weren't so much trouble to send them back, I would. I'll wear them as PJs, but they don't make reasonable pants for me."
3.0,"the necklace is really cute, but you have to be VERY gentle with it."
3.0,Not the material I was expecting. It's OK. It's just not very nice quality.
3.0,"Unfortunately these are a little too large for me. Not as flattering as I would like. They are too baggy, not at all slim fit or hug to the body. I'm usually between an XS and small, but can get away with a small - but these fit like a traditional medium!"
3.0,"I got this for my daughter who is a teen. She was really excited to receive it and really like it. The chain it came with was thicker than expected per the picture, and it broke within a few weeks: ( so that was not good."
3.0,CUTE AND DIDN'T HURT MY EARS
3.0,"Too big and very high waist, but work when I pull them up and cinch the waistband tie."
3.0,"It does not look like the picture. So very low quality, actually it is not pants or leggings! It is as thin as tights leggings!"
3.0,This bag is huge. On the model it doesn't look that big. I didn't pay attention to the measurements I went by the models pic. Good looking bag but if you are looking for a small tote this is not the one for you.
3.0,"These bags are suppose to save space in your luggage but that’s not the case. When they are fully zipped it does decompress the sides of the bag but the center remains at its full height. I loaded it several times, measured each time and in one situation with several heavy sweaters the center height was actually higher when I zipped up the compression zipper. They are still nice bags and I’ll use them for my travels. But they don’t give you more room in your luggage."
3.0,A stone fell out before I was even able to snap it in
3.0,I don't like this buckle design. Pinch fingers getting it closed. Changed buckle to an old 'military design' one had in drawer.
3.0,"It tends to curl out at the tip, even when only sticking through a belt loop."
3.0,Tafeta material and the waist is very tight. The zipper is not a heavy zipper either.
3.0,I loved the design. But I’m going to have to add another strap to make sure my bra doesn’t show. I’m top heavy and I hate wearing strapless bra
3.0,I am a true size small and the arms on this shirt are about 4 inches too short.
3.0,"This product is for temperatures not so cold, but dress well and are comfortable"
3.0,This was a shame because it looked really nice but mine came with a large hole in the sleeve :/
3.0,Cuts into shoulders support is great
3.0,"The watch was pretty, but came with a piece of lint inside the watch face. I returned it and bought a more expensive watch from a known brand to ensure better quality."
3.0,This seller must have adjusted its sizing because I ordered a size up and they were big. Still wearable but not like I like them. Quality is pretty poor. It's nice and light but it is the equivalent to Dollar store Halloween material. I It's okay to lounge around it
3.0,"The black denim has an awful smell to it that I can not get rid of. I've even soaked it for hours to no avail. Other than that, it fits and looks good. I am 5'7 145 lbs and I got a medium."
3.0,"It is pretty, however, easily twisted."
3.0,That’s not too bad but it’s not the greatest
3.0,The bathing suit was too small for me I would like to return it. Could you send me a return label so I can return it to get a larger size. Thank you Renee Curtis 9609 Allerton terrace
3.0,These are cute! The finish on one was a little different than the other but you don’t really notice while wearing them.
3.0,"Nice gift for a little girl , however it’s not that deep"
3.0,I bought this mainly for the zip up bras. The zip up bras were on the small side... Didn’t stretch as much as the other bras which fit as expected and had adjustable straps .
3.0,Not really oversized.  Fits like a regular shirt would fit.
3.0,It was too small for me. I returned it.
3.0,"liked the dress,but did not fit as expected, somewhat small"
3.0,"The necklace clip doest not work. Bad QA. The quality is soso for its price, it is definitely good design and look nice on me."
3.0,Extra small fit.
3.0,"Decent quality band that always gets compliments.<br /><br />Strap does not seem as well made as other, similar, bands I own."
3.0,It's a nice shirt but I'm a small girl and it was a bit big on me. Wish they had XS.
3.0,"Bought this watch for my wife cause the design was nice.<br />However the band broke, which is understandable. Got it fixed. Now the butterfly fell off and cant find it"
3.0,"Not the best quality hat or design. The patch is similar to iron on the patch, not embroidered like better hats. This is a cheap Chinese piece of work that serves a purpose but looks like the price. Try buying USA products."
3.0,"The dress itself is very pretty and eye catching. Its fun for what I use it for (dancing), but the material feels weird even after being washed."
3.0,"I have a kids sized head, so I as an adult will review this and then give you the kids input. This hat is purely for looks, not functionality. The hat is WARM, but that's about it. It has fleece inside and fur on the inside of the ears. As you get to looking closer, it has these wierd flaps on the flaps and it serves no purpose. Even has a button to flip them up. For what reason? It looks silly up. Serves no function down. The velcro will get dirty easily or filled with hair for the strap. It's best unstrapped. Also, the top fur part does not told down like most. It is sewn in place up top.<br /><br />As far as a childs review, it is pink and warm. It didn't turn heads or be amazed by it. This will work for winter days when they need a warm hat that I don't care if it gets dirty. Overall, cute but not functional."
3.0,Don't like the fabric...its think I am afraid to iron it ...it may shine.
3.0,"This jacket is nice and light weight. I love the color, and the fit is perfect. However, it is a lot more flimsy than I expected, so I am currently debating whether or not I am going to keep it."
3.0,"The neckline is very open and will require a safety pin. Material wrinkles easily. Will do the job for a trip to Disney, but the quality is not worth the price."
3.0,"Initially these shirts were perfect. They worked great for my husband under his polo work shirts. He is 6'5&#34; and the over all length is perfect. The sleeves are the perfect length, and don't hang out from under the polo sleeve. Unfortunately, I washed these with hot water and they shrank horribly. So I'm reordering, and buying a size larger. Hopefully if they do shrink, they'll still fit okay."
3.0,I have them for almost 2 weeks and by the 3rd week all of them have been lost. Need better materials
3.0,"The top is perfect . It is flattering and offers support.  Hides tummy imperfections and boosts up my chest. The bottom is worthless for me because I need a little skirt. But I am ordering a second set , different color , because the top is so perfect. I wish they had different bottom options but either way the top alone is worth the price."
3.0,The product is fine. I am not happy with them as I should have realized the gage was too large for me . You do need a tool like needle nose pliers to open and close these. Quality seems good
3.0,This runs so small it fits my 7 yr old daughter. I’m really disappointed because it’s a beautiful hat and doesn’t fit :(
3.0,Looks good but very little protection on side
3.0,It was a nice looking dress but it was way too small for me.
3.0,Seem like nice quality. Disappointed that you can see my eyes through the lenses. Also the glasses are quite large and flat. They dont curve at all with the face.
3.0,End link finish (on the midlinks) is different than on the rest of the bracelet. You get what you pay for...
3.0,"It doesn't last very long as opening and closing the case causes the fabric to sheer.  Had to quickly change it after a few months.  However, for the price and the appearance I still think it's a bargain."
3.0,I wore these for about a year before the heel started to fall apart.
3.0,"This shirt would be Amazing if they made in a 3x for us big boned people. Great material and manufacturing , just small"
3.0,The item looks nothing like the picture.
3.0,"Very cute outfit for the price; however, the pants ran short for my toddler and after one wash the pants significantly faded."
3.0,"I’m 5’4 140lb , the chest is tight and the rest is loose."
3.0,The elastic on the band messed up pretty quickly . The band adjustment doesn’t stay in place and it loosens up once I put it on and after I readjust it to my wrist.
3.0,"seem a little thin on the materials, the souls seem OK, we'll have to see how well they hold up."
3.0,Kind of on the cheaper side but still cute.
3.0,It's okay; not for big heads
3.0,"If you have short arms, want a very warm shirt for chilly winter days, and don’t care about looking cute, this is the shirt for you. The synthetic fleece lining is soft, non-shedding, and warm.<br /><br />If you have long arms or want something cute to wear, this is not for you. I ordered a size XS. It is roomy, but the sleeves are noticeably short on me.<br /><br />I kept this shirt for function, not form. It looks pretty ridiculous on me because the sleeves are too short and the torso is just blah, so I wear it around the apartment or under my coat for dog walks on frigid days. This is not an item that I’d wear in public without something over it.<br /><br />Also, I think mine was previously purchased and tried on. It arrived with a strong, unpleasant perfume smell. I needed it for a cold snap, so I didn’t have time to wait for a new one to arrive. I washed it before wearing it."
3.0,"This item is beautifully made and the fabric very heavy, However, it is the size of a Jr's small. You need to be tiny to wear it."
3.0,The bracelet was kind of thin and smaller than I thought it would have been. I thought dainty but it was just way too light and small for the look I was going for.
3.0,a bit heavy on the ear and the screw cannot hold the weight of the earring.
3.0,Doesn’t help with plantir fasciitis as claimed.  No arch support
3.0,I was going through a phase were I Really wanted this piercing but decided to try this instead.<br />It was cute and it helped me through my phase tbh tho I lost them LOL<br />I recommend if ur parents r strict :33
3.0,"it fits well, it's comfortable but the two I bought tore in less than a month"
3.0,"Love the pattern, but the texture was off, it was also giving off a bit of static. Not right for me, but someone else might love it."
3.0,"I bought this dress in the 3XL size a while ago. I liked it so much that I bought 7 more -- in for each day of the week :-). I looked it up again to see if they had more colors, only to find that you no longer carry the 3XL size. I was extremely disappointed. The XXL size gets 3 stars. The 3XL would get 5 stars. They quality is great, the fit is fantastic, and I loved them."
3.0,Works alright for driving over prescription glasses. A little bulky for active use.
3.0,The collar looks more feminine than I would have liked for my son.
3.0,"3 stars may be a bit harsh, but they are pretty fragile and do come apart kind of easy, but due to their flimsiness you can definitely adjust the sizes to help you get it just right for your hand. But seriously, this product is the poster child for an &#34;average&#34; product."
3.0,"Love these belts, they fit perfectly and look awesome! My only complaint is they smell VERY strong from the manufacturing process, I can smell it from the next room. It's like a mix of fresh dirt and burning plastic. I have tried running them in the dryer and dousing them in perfume... no luck yet. They look great but I am afraid to wear them in public until I can be sure! I wish I had an outdoor clothesline, I think that may work."
3.0,Great quality. Heavier than expected but I have to take away one star for the tight sleeves. The other star was because at 5’2” 123 lbs and the sweater/sweatshirt was shorter than expected. I ordered a medium.
3.0,I didn't notice the ruffle on neck line in the picture-not a fan of that but that's on me. My husband doesn't really like it on me.
3.0,"I love most of PB sweaters but this one was a bit short at waist so I returned it. Too bad. Love the cut, style and fabric"
3.0,They're really cute but I ordered two sizes up and they're still not big enough. I'm a medium and I got an XL maybe should've gotten a 2XL.
3.0,Very small torso. Fit width wise but the length was for a little kid.
3.0,These socks are well made but fit just a little snug.
3.0,"A little to big, but it is very pretty stone is beautiful"
3.0,"This shirt was not bad, looks more casual than shown but blue color was exactly as pictured. I paired with a belt and leggings for a cute look."
3.0,"If you follow the size guide on the website, then size is as advertised, however for a 30&#34; wast to order a Large is counter intuitive. Quality is good but pockets are small and no left rear pocket."
3.0,"Pros: color, shape, material!!!<br />Cons: zipper was tough, chain not long enough and doesn’t stay on shoulder well. Looks spacious from the outside, but very small inside."
3.0,"Love the look of the bracelet, unfortunately it is too small for my wrist even on the last button and I'm a fairly skinny guy.  maybe it was meant for super skinny girls or something or i just got a poorly made one."
3.0,"nice design,but bad quality.<br />i tried one time... and that’s it"
3.0,The only problem I had was the left leg as you can see it isn’t sewn.
3.0,A little on the small side--but does its job. The price was nice for the quality.
3.0,Good fit fair quality
3.0,Not as pretty as pictured. Perfect for a child but not an adult.
3.0,Not as low cut at the photo makes you think.  Just okay.
3.0,"The dress color is beautiful!! It was very loose in the chest, and the tying in the back went past my butt which I thought was a little weird. I went to homecoming with the dress and if I tried to bust a move, then this dress would’ve slipped right off of me."
3.0,"It's just too big for my wrist. When I take off the band, it falls off my wrist. If I make the opening smaller, I can't fit decent hair bands on it. If I had bigger wrists, I'd give it 5 stars for sure."
3.0,I was so excited to find these pants. I wash them in cold water and dried them on low heat. I was very disappointed as they shrunk about 2 inches in the link
3.0,These fit a little tight.
3.0,Cinches the waist however is slides/slips out of place so constant adjustment is needed
3.0,"I think the quality is nice but unfortunately the mask was just not adjustable enough to fit neither me or my family members. I bought bc I was hoping for a lighter more secure mask to wear in the gym but these masks, while they are well made, did not feel comfortable or secure while on. Perhaps be have too big heads or faces!"
3.0,Little bit tight for size large
3.0,"Not really what I was expecting in the front and with the straps.  The back design is awesome, however the straps don't adjust and they dont sit on my shoulder correctly.  Plus the pads over the breast area are not full size and since the bra is see through it looks like two big circles under the bra.  Weird and cute."
3.0,Received this dress and the print is so pretty! Unfortunately I have to return because it was too small. I think the XXL fits more like a Large. I wish they made it in bigger sizes.
3.0,"They are so cute i buy pink and rainbow color but they were so big for my baby 😒<br />I get the ones for 12 to 18 months, baby is 14 months. Way to big...i guess i will wait till it fits her."
3.0,I have only had this set for 2 months and the rose gold coating is already starting to come off. They are very pretty but won't last long.
3.0,I ordered this because I recently had rotator cuff surgery and while the shirt itself is very soft there are just too many snaps. I was hoping to not need help putting this on but the snaps are so small and there are so many that I do need help.
3.0,Lining in dress was dirty like worn before and the belt was not in the package.
3.0,These were ok for the price. Used them for Halloween costumes.
3.0,"I really, *really* like this band. It went well with so many outfits. HOWEVER, it was nearly impossible to take the band off. I basically ruined my manicure (which sounds minor, but the original band is not nearly as difficult to change) trying to fully remove it once it started falling off SIX WEEKS after I wore it. I suppose for the price, it's not bad. If it were easier to change the band, I'd buy it again. But my thumbs really hurt :-("
3.0,It's is very pretty but and it looks like in the picture but it's a very thin fabric people can see  your bra and underwear
3.0,"Good fit, keeps the chill out but not good for temperaturs under 30° for a prolonged time. The palms are a little slippery but got the job done. Used them I while checking trailers in a yard for a couple hours. Hands were not numb but still cold after about 20 minutes."
3.0,"Nice sandals but they run small and do no have a good arch support, which causes feet to turn inward."
3.0,"These are nice sandals with a lot of cushion. Unfortunately, the straps are to big, and this caused them to flap around when I walked. It's too bad, I liked the style and comfort, otherwise. I guess if you have fat feet these would be the sandals for you. (My feet are merely chubby.)"
3.0,"When I received these, they came out of the package crooked. Never really sat straight on my face. They dug into one side of my face. It was irksome, but they could still be worn. They were cute and just the right darkness. I broke them a few months after wearing them, but that has nothing to do with the sunglasses themselves. I want another pair of sunglasses, but I will not be purchasing these again for fear that they will come crooked too. After wearing them for a while it hurt."
3.0,"They're good glasses and worth 10$, but when your wearing them and look down the lenses do flip up which is annoying but keep in mind you get what you pay for but over all worth the money"
3.0,"It said size 2xl, but it was way to small it was like a large size fit"
3.0,Very baggy on me and very see through you get what you pay for.
3.0,"I purchased the large which is equivalent to US medium [size 8]. I am 5'8&#34;, 145lbs, 34DD. The fit was great and the dress was made from really nice stretchy material. I couldn't get past the pouf shoulders. My sons told me that I looked like a pilgrim. Yup. I returned it. I do have the other Miusol dress that matches this color scheme: Miusol Women's Vintage Polka Dot Neck 1950'S Classical Slim Cap Sleeve Evening Dress. That dress I LOVE."
3.0,Huge and looksnterrible on me. I love the print was I could make it work.
3.0,"I thought it would be a cool gift, but when was the last time you saw anyone wearing a handkerchief? The material and colors are nice, but it is still a handkerchief. For someone that did use them, they would be nice, but who is that person?"
3.0,"Not really what I had hoped for. Felt like a big diaper. Didn't really help much. Actually causes some chaffing. But to be fair, I'm a mountain bike rider. May be better for road biking."
3.0,It's kind of a robe.
3.0,Love it but I really don't know how to tie this! I may have to return it if I can't figure it out.
3.0,Backs fall off easily
3.0,"This is a cute bracelet, but solid silver should be quotation marks."
3.0,"This shirt is decent but it’s not quite what you would think it would be from the pictures provided. It’s pretty enough and the material is soft but it’s also incredibly thin and quite see through. I did get a larger size than usual and that was a very bad idea with this shirt. It has a bit of a strange fit and you definitely will not have to go up a size for this one. You may find you need to downsize but I can’t be sure definitively about that one.<br /><br />This shirt has a V-neck and long sleeves. There are a few different colors to choose from and different styles as well. Some have a design on them (mine is a pretty heart) and others are plain.<br /><br />I would recommend wearing this with a pair of jeans or maybe leggings, I don’t know. If it fits you correctly you’ll have a fun long sleeve shirt to wear but if it doesn’t it’ll hang a bit funny.<br /><br />I don’t know that I would absolutely recommend this but I would recommend reading a few other reviews to see if others have likes and dislikes for you to help you decide."
3.0,Was smaller than expected. Some ladies have boobs!!! Sorry.<br />Hard to get a “softball mom” shirt in a man’s size to fit a big busted woman.  So it’s just sitting in my closet.<br />If your not super petite.....this is not the shirt for you.
3.0,"Loved the multiple alarm function, am using it as a daytime reminder for my toddler to go to the bathroom (cheaper than the ones advertised as potty watches), problem is the wrist band broke after 3 weeks of use!!!"
3.0,It's a nice wallet. The only thing is when I try closing it it'll open up so I had to take some cards out :(
3.0,"I carefully read the sizing chart and read the reviews.  Then I ordered a size up, and it's still too small.  I'm going to keep it, as I'm currently dieting but I was really disappointed."
3.0,"Okay linen shirt, but runs smaller than the 3xl I normally buy. My best guess-timate is the actual size is about a 2xl to a 2-1/4xl compared to the 3so I normally receive."
3.0,"Pretty cheap,  some of the backings fall off.  Way bigger than I thought. Not appropriate for my 8yr old to wear everyday. She thinks they are great looking,  but not comfortable when backings slip and squeeze"
3.0,Hard to keep tight enough... My daughter loves the bracelet but she is afraid to lose it.
3.0,It was like as described Thanks
3.0,I have to give it a three the size they say is wrong. I have a 48&#34; waste. This was suppose to have a 50&#34;  cut to size. Wrong I have to do no cutting and the latch grips that the ratchet locks on this is about three inches away from the ratchet before they click. so it is not a big mans belt.<br />Yes thus summer I will drop some lbs then it will work gives me a goaled laughter out loud 👍😀<br />But the material and the buckle are outstanding three thumps up 👍👍👍
3.0,Super small! However the charm is super worth it so all I did was remake the chain with stuff I had on hand and it works!
3.0,super cute very thin though I had thought it would be thicker! not the best quality but still very cute
3.0,"It's replica you see on the ultimate fighter.  it comes kind of big with no way of adjusting unless you cut the cheap weird rope thing and re tie.  If i could go back in time and not buy it, I'd probably skip this purchase."
3.0,Looked great and fit great. But the fabric faded and pooled after first wash.
3.0,Very cute but tight. Not a true size that I was hoping for.
3.0,It was to short and tide
3.0,Just ok.  The lace is kind of brittle feeling.
3.0,Well designed but doesnt breath
3.0,My 5 yr old loves it! Few weeks to a month and lights flicker. It gets worn easily due to light fabric.
3.0,"The balls just click on,  I was expecting them to screw on."
3.0,This did not fit as it looks on the model. The top is really awkward so I just use it as a tank top for around the house.
3.0,Doesn't breathe well.  I little long for the size.  Fit in the bust well.
3.0,I did not understand the sizes.
3.0,"The color is true to the photos. Given the price, the quality is decent. However, the sizing is off in my opinion. The chest area is baggy and the sleeves look like tents on me. I usually have to get the chest and shoulder straps altered with most of my chiffon style dresses but I didn't feel like the hassle. Especially given all the other areas it didn't accentuate my body type. I wasn't able to get the zipper all the way up (just below the bra strap area) because I was afraid of breaking it. The dress ended below the knee and would definitely have to be worn with high heels for someone around my height.<br />Just for reference, I'm 5', size 6 in women's dresses, medium in Jrs and size 6-7 in women's pants. I also wear a 36C."
3.0,The shirt was a bit bulky and not flattering for my figure.
3.0,Not a bad &#34;cheap&#34; necklace. Get what you pay for.
3.0,"I was looking for something to wear for getting out of the hot tub. I was hoping it absorbed water like terry cloth, but it doesn't."
3.0,Like them but they aren't what I expected
3.0,"See though on the back, If you can, I would suggest getting a size or two bigger."
3.0,"Product was pretty good for the price. The material was okay, not too heavy. Based on another review I sized up so it was WAAAAY too big. Order your normal size!"
3.0,Basically it was just much more cropped than I expected from the picture. Cute but not flattering. And not great for working out in.
3.0,"My son only wore this one time so I style of the item was great. However, the sizing was off. The legs were too short and the snaps were too far apart so his diaper showed through. I also ordered one in newborn size for my newphew and it was missing one snap entirely."
3.0,"The cut is awkward for a gym shirt. I usually ride the line between a medium and large, so I order a XL based on the reviews. But it's still cut oddly around the arms, a lot of material just sort of hung out under the arm.<br /><br />I ended up cutting the arm holes low down the side to make it more comfortable to work out in, the cost was low enough that it was worth keeping with the same adjustment"
3.0,"We had to purchase a pink leotard for my 4 year old daughter's dance recital.  Reading previous reviews, I knew it would likely be on the small side, but I measured my daughter and made sure she was well within the suggested size limits. I assumed that I left enough leeway for it to still fit her.  Sure enough, though, when it arrieved it was ridiculously small for my average sized (not at all chubby) daughter.  I reordered in a larger size and this time it fit well enough.  I do like that it is lined (neither her underwear nor belly button show, at least in indoor lighting), and the style is all right, though I wish it wasn't quite so low on my daughter's chest.  All in all, it is a decent leotard, and I'm happy enough with it.  My lower stars mostly reflect the difficulty in getting the right size, despite having been prepared with accurate measurements.  Order larger than you think."
3.0,"Luckily, I bought this robe for a Halloween costume. I thought 25 bucks was pretty reasonable.<br />It says to wash it before use. I did. There was so much ""terry cloth fuzz balls"" afterwards, that I decided to wash it a second time. The thing is unravelling. It will serve my purpose. If I was buying it to use everyday, I would send it back.<br />I don't think it's worth the 25 bucks I paid for it..."
3.0,"Cute top but the material is abrasive, causing skin irritation. I recommend wearing a thin t-shirt or a camisole underneath."
3.0,Works okay . I don't know if it was because I was using the case in an already lit up room. However very flashy and got a lot of compliments !
3.0,Good quality but very small.
3.0,It's a nice dress but needed adjustment
3.0,It looked liked it hit more loosely in the ad.
3.0,The color and design is really nice. Though it didnt fit well on me. I am just a petite girl whos 5ft tall. It looks like a dress on me. I can use it for summer though.
3.0,Not at all a fan of this bathing suit. Top was smaller than I expected and bottoms dug into my legs which made them look terrible. this might be a suit that looks better on an even more petite person than I am. I am a size 6 athletic build and this just did not look good on me. as far as the quality of the material that just seemed fine I didn't look like anything will be see-through.
3.0,"The material is stretchy, so don't worry too much about the size.  It's ok,"
3.0,"I bought this ring after I graduated nursing school. So about a year or so ago. I've worn it everyday. Unfortunately, the black is coming off of the ring near the top and bottom. I mean you get what you pay for but it is a lovely ring. Might have to buy another one."
3.0,I didn’t like the fleece/fabric.
3.0,Looks nice not the best quality.
3.0,"They are actually nice shoes and fit well, and are comfortable.  I just don't think they are my style."
3.0,Picture looks better than it does on me. :(
3.0,A little thin and should be better material for under armour
3.0,"Lovely sandals, my feet are a bit narrow but I'd think they'd be perfect for someone who has wider feet"
3.0,The belt &#34;leather&#34; itself is cheap. I wish I had bought one that was a little better quality.
3.0,"At first I really liked this case.  But after only a little use, the case isn't closing evenly and now has a gap when closed because the top portion no longer lines up with the bottom portion.  Pretty frustrating and disappointing."
3.0,"My seven year old calls these her “dream shoes.”  Yes, they have an inner wedge heel, she loves it and they’re cute.  They’re more of a fashion shoe than an everyday playclothes shoe.  She put them on and you could tell she felt amazing.  She wears a big kid 3 and the 3 fits perfectly.  I consider these true to size.  I gave them a 3/5 stars because I found two flaws.  The first one is one of the zippers came bent (see photo).  The second star was lost because she wore them around the house to break them in for about 10 minutes and the fabric scuffed (see photo).  I’m sure I can cover it with black marker but that shouldn’t happen so quickly.  If you’re planning to use these for something nice, pack a black marker."
3.0,"I've had these for 6 months now and unfortunately am disappointed. I guess they don't work for my body type. I have hips and a butt and a small waist. I got a medium when I normally would get a large to ensure a secure fit at my waist but even the medium has proven to be too big for my waist. I have to keep yanking these pants up which really really sucks. Someone with my body type should not be getting a size small but I guess that's what I really needed with these. So I don't feel they're true to size. If you have my body type, be aware of that."
3.0,Actual product is BRIGHT red. Too red for me!
3.0,"These are a little cheaper made than I was expecting but, they're earrings and they do hang from my ears as expected :) They have not broken or bent or anything, but you can tell the elephants are better quality than the hooks and it seems like the hooks are gonna go soon. Still a good buy- you really get what you pay for"
3.0,Comfy shoes but rubs on the inside of my foot.
3.0,"First of all, please excuse my dirty mirror and bad picture quality. The shirt is actually a smooth and nice fabric. This is a beautiful shirt except for the fact that the arm hole situation is a hot mess. I am really weird about tank tops..they have to cover my arm pit fat pocket..which this doesnt, and they have to not show my bra when i lift my arm..and this shows way too much of it. I might be able to alter it some how to fix this hopefully. Sigh... Because other than that, i love this top. The fabric is really nice. Definitely a step up from a basic cotton shirt. Its a little longer than id prefer, but at the same time it'll be easier to tuck in..i usually just tuck in the front and leave the back out, but this covers my whole bum...so its just a tad long. If you're tall it'll probably be perfect on you. It's loose fitting as you can see...but it still fits well. Im 5'4 145-150lbs and i ordered a medium for reference. If the huge armhole thing doesn't bother you, im sure anyone would love this top. It's really nice quality otherwise. I really hope I'm able to fix that so i can wear it"
3.0,The fit is fine but the material is scratchy.
3.0,The all gold one was way too big of a loop the gold one with diamonds is a perfect size but is hard as hell and painful trying to unclip and take off
3.0,"These masks are cute but they are huge! I mean big on my husband. I bought them for my daughter because the description said teen in it, but they swallow her entire face. Also the metal piece that bends to your nose is just floating around in the seam and doesn't stay in place."
3.0,It is very cute but is more like a tunic to wear with leggings. Not a dress.
3.0,"It's cute, but the small was too big for me.  I would have ordered an XS if there was one.  Unfortunately I had to return it."
3.0,Sleeves are very tight even though I deliberately bought a size larger.
3.0,"Not bad for price. Edging is white, so they were painted black to look better."
3.0,"These were gorgeous when they arrived, just the right size in my opinion.<br /><br />I got these for Christmas a year ago, and have worn them 4-5 times.  I went to wear them a week ago and realized they had significantly tarnished.  I keep them in my jewelry box, so they were not exposed to anything unusual.  I've never had gold do that before.  I'm disappointed -- lets me know the quality of the gold plating is poor."
3.0,"Good for summer and warm weather .... the drawstring feels cheap and material is ok i guess.  I'm used to flannel and not a thinner cotton. I'd like to see some pockets in the front also.  I have since found a product I like much better, but not sure I'm allowed to post a competitors product here.  If you want something that will fill the bill and is inexpensive ... this is a good choice for you.  I'd pay a bit more for what I want."
3.0,"The belt elastic appears to be of good quality, but as others gave mentioned the magnet adhesive is terrible. All magnets popped off the first day, with one magnet falling to the ground and chipping. I've tried using Super Glue to attach them, but that doesn't work either; it also lasts about a day. Next attempt will be to try epoxy glue.<br /><br />The magnet is very strong, so it holds my kids pants up just fine. It's too strong for my 3 year old to take off herself, and my almost-6 year old can do it but struggles. My 7.5 year old doesn't have any problems. I include this not as a criticism, but so other parents can be aware. Your kindergartner may or may not be able to take this belt off by him/herself at school, but by first grade he/she should be fine. But if you're working with a potty training preschooler, he/she will likely not be able to use the bathroom without your help."
3.0,"The top is super cute fit if you have a small body. I ordered a size S knowing that the bottoms would be cheeky. As expected they were but again, I love the top."
3.0,fits good but the back seem always works or slides it's way around to front it should or needs to stay in place
3.0,Quality was not very good
3.0,"Dress was great for what you pay.  It was a bit big on the top and hard for me to find a good strapless bra.  With a little more planning I would have had it just right, but I waited until last minute.  So while the dress fit everywhere else, I felt that I had way too much cleavage showing and it made me really uncomfortable.  Also, I kept having to shift the dress back into position as it would twist at the bottom and suddenly the side seams would be in the front and back.  That may not happen for everyone though, I am very curvy so I think the dress moved with my body.  All in all, too much adjusting and I didn't feel as comfortable as I thought I would. That could also be my own insecurities speaking though because I did get lots of compliments on the dress!"
3.0,Item purchased was shipped in good time and packaged well. Was pleased with purchase and service.
3.0,"Pretty dress, but thin material. It has a seam at the waist which was nice and a bit of flair on the skirt. Worth the $8. but no more."
3.0,"It will do the job, but I think it's ment for a tall, anorexic girl.."
3.0,Break so easy ☹️
3.0,The jeans are cute but they were to small across the butt. I was going to return for a refund but there was a  harge attached. The description stated returns were FREE but that is not true.
3.0,Very nice and minimal but to have been sold as a product costing almost 200$ I don't think so. At the low price though if you like the design go ahead and get it.
3.0,Too floppy but cute
3.0,Nice design - fabric is not breathable ....
3.0,"It fits like a blouse or top,it can be pulled down to be at the the thighs by it doesn't go to the knees and when you pull it down, it rides back up as you walk, it's kinda big up top, loose, but it's pretty good , thought the material that made it isn't"
3.0,"Que la tela no es streech, es ta bien la talla pero incómoda un poco al moverse por la falta de elasticidad.2"
3.0,I thought it was just okay. Nothing very special about it. My daughter loves it and since it was her gift she chose to keep it..
3.0,Soft material and great for working out. I had ordered the black in a small and it was great. This small was longer and flowy. I kept it but would order an XS due to my preference of more fit workout tops.
3.0,"This is pretty much what I've come to expect from a strapless bra-they aren't at all comfortable and they don't stay up. The pads in this one are so ridiculous. They are completely round and completely obvious, you can see the outline of them through your shirt. The elastic around the top and bottom of this bra are slightly more comfortable than most strapless bras, the fabric is soft and super stretchy which means it doesn't dig into you like some bras, but it also means that it doesn't stay in place. You will constantly be pulling it up and adjusting it. I'm starting to think that finding a strapless bra that is comfortable and actually stays up is about as likely as finding a unicorn!"
3.0,It's a nice suit. Material felt a little odd but well constructed. Just a bit too tight around the waist and arms. So sad i had to return. If it was just another size larger. It would have been perfect.
3.0,Cutter on picture and when you look at it but didn't compliment my shape well at all. Still a nice dress just not for me.Glad i ordered two!
3.0,"Totally disappears under my engagement ring.<br />Nice understated look, just didn't work with my ring.<br />Would be perfect for someone who has a dainty ring."
3.0,"Very pretty dress, but the size 4/6 (the smallest one currently available), was way too big.  I'm 5'5&#34;, 125lb, 32DD and was swimming in it.  The waist had at least 2-3 extra inches of fabric, but that could've been disguised by the flowy/loose nature of the dress because it comes with a matching belt.  But the top was so loose-fitting that my boobs were completely exposed, there's no way I could keep this dress without alterations.  Length was perfect for my height, it hit maybe half- to 1-inch above the floor when wearing flats."
3.0,It doesn't have the shine like the original. It looks like it an fits. Very hard to install
3.0,I like the way the bag looks and I find it to be very similar to the picture but the bags handles broke after a few months of occasional use. Not only the handles but also the inside indicate that the Quality is not the greatest. For me this was a waste of money since it broke so fast without me even using it often.
3.0,I got the teal one. It's so cute and I loved wearing it. Unfortunately it sheds :( I have a 14 month old that ran around eating it off the floor. Kinda disappointed especially since it's so pretty!
3.0,It's an okay product. But color fades too quickly.
3.0,Great looking but not comfortable to wear - too wide and too round. It would fit better if it were a bit flatter so it was shaped more like the wrist.
3.0,"Was expecting a silk, polyester feel.  It was a cotton material very heavy and hot to sleep in."
3.0,Fits well. Provided little to no support. Not good for anything bigger than c cup. No way to adjust straps either.
3.0,"Not easy to use, slips and not very attractive."
3.0,Nice dress but need a way to close the top or if you don't mind your bra showing then it's perfect.  I didn't notice that when I tride it on but liked it so much I bought it in white also. Too late to return so I'm going to have to figure out how to fix that issue.
3.0,"Nice top, but bottoms are a little small."
3.0,Nice quality. But it fits allot bigger than expected.
3.0,"I like the look of it...sort of mad scientist like.<br />The problem is you need to hold the item right up in front of your face to benefit from the magnification. Which they work decently for.<br />I've tried using it to connect small pieces together, but found it to be tricky, and had to keep moving closer and further to keep in focus.<br />I'd love to have a pair of glasses like this where I could hold something at arms length. (like a dentist uses)"
3.0,"Spacious, a bit weak had to take to shoemaker to restitch."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:811b693f4e32ebc3b49705522929cecb]] Nice basic sweater but the description does not match the item in my opinion.
3.0,"Very warm but too bulky and at some point they don't let move your hands, so you can't hold things very well.  Excellent thermal insulation, they always keep your hands warm.  Its silicone coating on the palm is very bad. Touch screen function is terrible,  you can't use it with a phone or tablet because they are too thick and it doesn't recognize the device. Not even 15 days after having bought them and the silicone has already come off.  Quite expensive for the quality of the product.  I bought them because I had a gift card, otherwise I wouldn't have bought them.<br />If you need them to go out in the cold they are fine, but if you need them to work in a warehouse or cooler, they are not useful. I would definitely not buy them again especially for the price, too expensive for the quality."
3.0,The sleeves were a different length. Like significantly. But it's a cheap beach coverup and I wore it once so eh.
3.0,"Not a bad sweater. The pockets would be better if sewn on after (a patch pocket) that way you could put things in them without them hanging out away from the body - not a good look and also a good way for things to fall out of you pockets, like your cell phone. And of course buttons always make a sweater warmer. I did find it strange that this same sweater is sold by more than one company and has different washing instructions"
3.0,It nice a little to big but nice.
3.0,The fabric is very light so the jacket doesn't hold its form very well.  I haven worn it yet because it is not stiff enough for the look I want.
3.0,The top is too short. The bottoms are cute.
3.0,"This dress is cute, however, has a few flaws! I purchased the color camel and the dress is a different color than portrayed. It's more of an orange brown color. Another issue is that the top is completely see through! No liner or anything! The listing states to size down so I did and bought a medium. Even at 34 weeks pregnant, I feel that a small would have fit better."
3.0,I bought this for my wife's birthday. It didn't cause any reaction with her skin like some metal watches and lasted for a little over a year before it stopped working and a new battery wouldn't fix it. She loved the appearance so my sister got her another one for Christmas. The second one lasted a year and a half before the stud that holds it latched pulled out. It's a shame this watch doesn't last because it has a very nice appearance.
3.0,I expected better.  They are not AAAAA quality.  Maybe I should stop buying pearl earrings.  Live and learn.  Next I may go to jewelery store and see quality.
3.0,"A estos guantes se les despegaron y salieron los ""dedos"" plásticos, negros de la primera vez que los usé.  No han cumplido con el propósito esperado."
3.0,Okay for cheap jewlery.
3.0,"I liked the ones that were seen right, but two had a cup sewn into the back (a cup for my shoulder blade?)."
3.0,"The pants roll and like slide off during wear,  I'm constantly having to pull them up. The material feels super nice and who does love pockets although"
3.0,"I really love the fabric color and pattern and thought the pocket would be very helpful. The fabric actually looks just like some yoga pants I have so I presumed it would be similar quality. Unfortunately, this fabric was much thinner instead.<br /><br />Perhaps for some sports that's desirable but I personally like a short skirt to have weight so I won't feel like it'll fly up at every turn when I'm dancing. It may be suitable for other people though so if you like the style you may as well give it a try if it's style a Prime delivery option."
3.0,We got it for like $2 it’s cute but cheaply made so you get what you paid. For lol
3.0,"I should think carefully about the quality, it does get shaky and you get what you paid for"
3.0,The band was narrower than I wanted. I thought it would be 20mm wise.  It wasn’t all that easy to install.
3.0,Cute. Not same as pic. But it’s okay. More dull than the picture depicts.
3.0,Watch out as some on the scarfs tend to run.  I got blue stains on some of my clothes in the load they were in.
3.0,I love the shorts and the pockets. It works great for running I have places to put my phone and and other personal items. However I don't like the new compression fabric. They used to make these  but without so much compression. When I run I would rather be more comfortable.
3.0,"I love the strap, but I am disappointed the the color is not as advertised. I bought #24, and it is black and white, not brown and pink as pictured."
3.0,The fabric is shiny which I wasn’t expecting but didn’t mind. It’s cute on and comfy. Only complaint is that it ripped during my first wear! My toddler pulled on the bottom a little and it completely ripped at the tie at the waist. Wish it was more durable. Not recommend for moms.
3.0,I did not like the online description says long cloak and it was short! No way to fix it! The broom was a joke! T<br />he brush part looks like a small thin paint brush! Not a witches broom at all. The hat was the only accurate item in the package. Packaging was beautiful!
3.0,"All it does is make white lights look yellow, not clearer or less glare, just yellow.  I guess if you wanna look like Bono then go for it."
3.0,could be just a little bit bigger. good for size 10 mens.
3.0,Would like a way to exchange for next larger size<br />Fits like a large and is marked 3x.  How can I return with no charge
3.0,"Measurement is not accurate. About 11"" wide (almost) and about 64"" long, unless you include the fringe. I would not classify the color as navy blue but close enough. Very thin and although it is soft, it is not cashmere soft. A little pricey for what it actually is."
3.0,Sizing problem
3.0,Not like I expected
3.0,Decent underwear. Not sure what constitutes five star underwear but these are comfortable and fit fine.
3.0,"Thought it would be cuter.  Top is VERY small, skirt fits fine.  Laundered well.  Air dried after washing.  Overall I am disappointed."
3.0,Small holes in the seams near the pockets. Good snug fit though and durable so far.
3.0,"I've how there is alot of space for cards and has a seprate cash spot that won't have crumpled cash. However, I do tike the fact that it dosent have a separate zipper to put coins in. I usually put them with the cards but I tend to struggle more and have lose change falls. If this would have had it own compartment or better sustained it would have decirved a better rating."
3.0,Too small ☹️
3.0,I found it too small
3.0,"States it is a Small, but is more like a L/XL."
3.0,Nice masculine military like design. I have a small writs unfortunately this watch band does not have enough holes to fit my wrist. :(
3.0,Wide fit and not very flattering. I wouldn't buy it again.
3.0,"The top is cute. I'm 5'9"" and the small was a little short for me. A medium would have been too billowy.  I love the shoulder cut outs and it is very comfortable.  The color is simple and will go with many other things.  Overall it is a unique top that I like to wear."
3.0,"I think the hat is cute & fun , I may have to trim the fur around by my eyes lol, I have had<br />Some funny comments on it but I don’t care,<br />I am me!"
3.0,"These are really nice sunglasses, from an ocular and style standpoint, but the nike flash mirror coating is really easily scratched.  If you're spending this much on sunglasses, go for something a little more scratch resistant, like ray ban or something to that effect rather than being disappointed a few months later when its scratched to death and looks cheap."
3.0,Like but I should have ordered in another color.
3.0,"It's a really cute beach cover, but it is much shorter than expected. I'm just under 5'3&#34; and it fits like a tank top. So if your looking for a dress, your not getting it with this. It is really cute though, so in keeping it."
3.0,Not what I was expecting.  It looks like a durag for men
3.0,"The size of the diamond is ok, it's small but if was shiny and not cloudy it would be worth it"
3.0,The size is not to the size on your chart disappointed all the other items I bought from different sellers was a perfect fit.
3.0,"extra long bill. comfy, but not exactly my style. Definitely will keep the sun off  your face."
3.0,The dress is beautiful.  But the top is too large for me.  Definitely for bustier women.  Sadly I am returning it
3.0,"I should have paid better attention to other reviews.  I bought these for my daughter as workout leggings, but they are thin enough you can see underwear underneath.  It would be suitable for wearing under skirts and the patterns are cute."
3.0,These masks are super cute.  However mine had the nose pincher on the chin. Unless you are supposed to wear them upside down.  My kids still wore them because they love Mario.
3.0,"I was disappointed to get all light colored panties when I wanted the black, and darker colored.  Reading the description closer I realized it did not say what colors you would get.  Somewhat misleading as not as pictured.  I will keep them but probably will not order again, as I want the darker colores."
3.0,Worth the buy. Fits just as expected.
3.0,I wish the charms had come with rings to attach to bracelets.  I have to buy them now before I can attach them.
3.0,The tie on top seemed too short to me and it just didn't look good.
3.0,"Was a very slow arriving, 3 days past of what they said it should have been. Color of the print is not as prominent as I thought it would be, a little light."
3.0,So small that the three sizes go through the holes in my ears
3.0,"These are nice, padding is fine, but they are larger than i needed and i keep getting caught up on the seat when i stop and go back on ."
3.0,"I like them, but they are more of a pink color then red."
3.0,Bought for my 2.5yo and it was too small for her. She’s 37in tall and 35lbs
3.0,It’s not a sweatshirt material. It’s a stiff non-stretch printed on one side material. Fit fine.
3.0,"Super cute top, looks just like picture but I’m an XL (bra size 38 D) and it was too small. I don’t like returning things so I just gave it to my mother in law."
3.0,"Runs very small, and the material is scratchy. I returned it."
3.0,feels cheap but does the trick. Not great not bad and woks for intended purpose (driving)
3.0,NO STRETCH at all. Sleeves were fitted for a child
3.0,"It is a fine cheep suit. The outside fabric gets completely soaked. It doesn't go all the way through so my daughter stayed warm. If you notice other snow suits people are wearing, none of them have wet snow pants. The snow falls off and doesn't penetrate, this is the only suit I have seen that lets the snow soak in and melt. And they straps don't adjust so we had to cross the straps in the back so they didn't keep falling off. If you are looking for a cheep suit, it works."
3.0,"Great looking, but not for a skinny wrist. It slips down so far as to make it rather annoying after a few hours."
3.0,Runs small. Gave it to my daughter.
3.0,Nice bag but the color rubs off on clothes.
3.0,Tuxedo fit well but missing my cuff links.
3.0,Tight on shoulders
3.0,This is a nice wallet but the magnet will demagnetize hotel room keys and gift cards. Seems ok with credit cards.
3.0,"6 of them were fine. 1 of them though the threads weren't cut right and it didn't screw together. Maybe I got a dud, maybe they have poor QC. This product is a gamble in my eyes."
3.0,Loved the fabric and style. Ordered usual size. But the Item runs.
3.0,The shirt was fine but the material is like a swimsuit so I sent it back.
3.0,I like the fabric but it was so long. I’m 5’1”.
3.0,Its a nice warm jacket but the pockets ripped withen hours
3.0,Little tight putting them on and taking off.  This pair is not stretchy and they are made out of completely different material  and ordered from the same sight. The2 other shorts I ordered were stretchy and soft and this pair their was hardly any give in them.
3.0,It's good for the prize buy a size larger mine seems to run smaller.
3.0,"This is a review from day of recieving. It appears in the ticket that socks are made of 18% of polyester. Polyester for me is a very uncomfortable synthetic fiber that I won't use in cloths. If a product I buy contains synthetic fibers I would like to know this in advance, and not have a surprise when recieving the package. It is not mentioned anywhere in the description. This is an annoying deception.<br />Update: after 3 weeks of using socks: decided to still try them. So, putting aside the polyester issue, they are relatively comfortable.  A little thick for summer days, and make you sweat in them. They passed 2 laundries ok. If their contained materials would have been mentioned in advance that would be a fair buying option. Price is reasonable and they seem fine..<br />Raising rating from 2 to 3 stars."
3.0,"Looks cheap but well, it is"
3.0,"not as 'rainbow' as I would have liked, not as colorful as I expected it to be"
3.0,"First, the pants really do fit true to the actual listed size, not Asian sizes like some reviews suggested.  I ordered based on these suggestions and the pants were too big.  Second, the image shows a side zipper on the pants, the pair that I received did not have a zipper and were loose on the top.  Third, the fabric is really wrinkled.  I think I;m just going to donate them instead of hauling with a return."
3.0,"When I received the order, it was so wet inside the package.  Hopefully the batteries will still last long......."
3.0,1 of the 4 items came broken
3.0,"They are too tight in the wasite, to the point I can't even get them over my hips. They are super cute jeans tho. Material feels sterdy. I'm giving them to my cousin."
3.0,"It came earlier than expected which is great but the sizing was a little off, this was a gift for my boyfriend and he’s a lanky 6’3 guy. It was shorter on the arms which I didn’t expect but it most likely could’ve been fixed if I had gone one size up"
3.0,"I guess you get what you pay for! There was some gross stains on outside of packaging, I'm not sure what it was but not sure I want to know. See pics. I threw it out and immediately washed my hands. These are extremely tiny and look like they would fit a baby. I ordered 3T for my daughter to wear under her school uniform dress and are too small and without even stretching material they are see through! The only good thing is they are soft. You can see in the pic that her size 3T shorts from Carter's doesn't even compare to this companies sizing. Granted I understand they are meant to be like a boy short but it should still fit on her waist without restricting her if it was a true size 3T. I'm dissapointed and not worth returning and the hassle!"
3.0,Nice and compact. Seems easy enough to be able to pack and smash down in luggage to fit nicely
3.0,"Runs on the large side so take that into account when ordering. Good weight for the price.  As far a style goes, the hood is sort of like &#34;lets make this sweatshirt into a hoodie&#34; and they just attached this huge hood.  All in all not a bad deal.  Just be aware of the size running big and the over-sized hood you'll be getting."
3.0,"Very attractive glasses but *super* dark, buyer beware on that front. Not the highest quality overall, some loose parts that can't be tightened on the pair I received."
3.0,I have small wrists on the band is really short ...just  about on the last hole.
3.0,Love the hat style
3.0,Pretty but made for a large neck.
3.0,Super cute and flattering but be warned that the clip comes undone very easily and you may flash.
3.0,"Quality product, but the magnet is weak."
3.0,They run very big. So the fit isn't great.
3.0,"Outfit looked great but the cut is waaaay to small. I returned the item twice. It kept getting returned to send. The seller was outstanding not went out their way to help me.I WOUILD buy this item again, just gotta chk the small cut sizes."
3.0,The cover case was broken in the package when I opened it. I can’t find any contact information.
3.0,"I am 5' 6'' and usually order regular sizes.  These are comfy, but they are a bit short. They needed to be 2 inches more in length to cover my ankle."
3.0,"Bit disappointed. Smaller than expected. One I got I had to assemble it because it wasn't assembled. It was annoying that I had to pull off all the plastic and assemble it. Shiny, but didn't like that it was smaller than expected and I had to assemble it myself. I'll see if it holds up, but I'm not confident it will...at least it was inexpensive, but expensive for what the product is."
3.0,"The styling of the sleeves are big and bulky - especially around the shoulders and upper arm.  Unfortunately, it makes the sweater unflattering and unfeminine.  The fabric and colors, on the other hand,  are absolutely beautiful. I wish it fit better."
3.0,nice form and function except the material that is supposed to hold them on your nose needs a not oily/sweaty surface or they slide right off.
3.0,"Very cute, but too large. Order a size down."
3.0,"This coverup is ok,  sheer, kinda boxy and doesn’t give much shape, it’ll  be ok to wear to the pool. Pic is a picture straight out of the bag , it’ll be less wrinkled after I wash it. I hope!"
3.0,"Wanted to give 3.5 stars. Good price and decent product but these laces are a little stiffer than others I've purchased. Also didn't care for the packaging. They were not organized by lace size, each set came in a bag and were all stuck together so I had to peel them apart and align them before installing."
3.0,The color of the amethyst was cloudy-- not as pretty as the photo.
3.0,"The color does not match the picture, it looks yellow in the picture and it’s orange in person. But it still somewhat cute."
3.0,"I am 5'9"" and 170 pounds so average to maybe a little heavy for my height. I have worn a 36 C bra and a size 10 or 12 pretty consistently. I ordered the XL which was listed as a 10/12 and the top was too big. Not by that much so if you are more of a 12 and have a slightly larger chest that would have worked. After 2 kids my chest runs a little smaller. I returned it and am hoping the Large is better. The bottoms were a disaster. I have a decent sized booty - not too big but definitely there. The shorts are cut as a perfect square with almost no allowance for the backside....so unless you are pretty flat it is unlikely the bottoms will work well. They were so bad I thought I had them on backwards. I liked the top enough that if the next size down fits I will just get a separate bottom which is easy to do as most places sell them that way."
3.0,IF your smaller faced- these can be a tad big<br /><br />Totally comfortable and wash before wear
3.0,Nice coat lousy zipper. Coat was very warm fit very nice but the zipper split the third time I wore it.
3.0,"It fit wonderful except around the bust.  I ordered a small, 5'2 and the halter area was awkward.  I ended up sending it back.  It needs darts for the bust area since it gaped.  It is beautiful material and looks amazing except that area."
3.0,very sticky... but work very well. we will see how long the sticky lasts and if it stops working and sticking to me after time.
3.0,"The material of this dress is polyester (synthetic). The material is not breathable. In the summer its hard to wear because you will begin to sweat. Wear this dress often impossible. I ordered a size S. It has a very tight rubber band, which  pain. It is better to order a size larger. Then it will be more comfortable to wear. But the dress looks cute."
3.0,"The waist is not like on the Model.  It is quite high - like an empire cut for maternity.  I'm 5'9&#34; 160lbs.  I ordered a large. Fits ok in the shoulders, but that waist is REALLY high and awkward.  The kids said, &#34;Mom, it looks like religious frumpy&#34;.  Returning the dress. Not giving it away.  Fabric was cheap and it wrinkles very easily."
3.0,The fit and the quality of these leggings are truly great. The material is thick enough to hold everything in but not so thick that they are uncomfortable to wear. My only complaint is that they are not very breathable.
3.0,I love this. I wish it was a bit longer though so that it is easier to get in.
3.0,"I bought patio dresses in two colors-coral and orhid,they are bright and beautiful colors.But dresses run too big,pleats on the bally area wide and make you big and bulky.I had to return both dresses."
3.0,I haven’t worn yet. But when I took it out of packaged it look like it was see through.
3.0,"I like the material. It has a little stretch.<br />The lace does go down a bit further than what is shown in the picture. The zipper seems like it's cheap. Not like the other dresses or skirts I've bought in the past.<br />Overall, the dress is nice. The color and lace design is as pictured.<br /><br />UPDATE: 7/30/18 the zipper broke. I have only worn it once so sad :("
3.0,I did not buy this for “calming” or anything else other than I like the look of hematite
3.0,The picture is beautiful! The strings popped off the first time I used it. Kept it though because I loved the pattern/picture.
3.0,"It's a super cute shirt, but has a flaw in the fabric that is creating a run in the material"
3.0,"I like this dress but it didn't fit me. I think i'm in between sizes. For reference, I am a size 14-16, 5'4&#34;, and 186 lbs. I was looking for an elopement dress that wouldn't make me feel fat. This dress comes with lightly padded cups, and is comfortable. I did not have any issues with the sleeves, which is great because I am fat and as a massage therapist, my arms are very bulky. I didn't like it enough to make it my wedding dress. I think it would look lovely on someone who is skinny."
3.0,They are cheaply made
3.0,"I had hopes it'd be great, like all the reviews say, highly disappointed in the small size. Barley past my waistline, and tight.<br />Gets a three star because, it seems quality made, and the shipping was fast."
3.0,I'd suggest going up a size my boy is a little husky and wears a size 10/12.. In other brands he's a medium so I went with same size and they hardly fit and are too tight so buy a size larger is my recommendation.
3.0,"The socks seem good quality and fit well.  I am just not sure about the function in general of yoga socks.  I bought them because my feet slide on my mat, especially during straddle poses or warrior.  So I thought grippy things would help.  The problem is that your feet still slide INSIDE the socks.  The socks stick to the mat but your feet just slide inside the socks so the socks end up kind of sideways on your feet.  So the socks are nice but not a solution to slippery feet/mat problem."
3.0,They cling to my nose and mouth vs. cotton face masks; it is more difficult to breathe wearing these. Additionally they did not have a nose wire... so my glasses continually fog up when wearing these.
3.0,Make sure you choose a size or two larger than what you usually wear. An XL fits more like a Med-Lg
3.0,"You really have to have the right body for the dress.  Right in every area: chest, butt, hips, height, etc.  if one is not perfect for the cut the whole dress looks weird.  I almost had it but not enough...:)"
3.0,"I really loved my turquoise so much that I purchased one for all my Aunts and cousins.  Well the other stone bracelets are not quite as nice.  Some of the gold bead trim as been omitted in this particular river-stone looking one BUT..... with a bit of creativity, a glue stick and some supplies from a hobby store, I will have a very nice bracelet to give.  Remember, you are paying less than $3.00 a piece!  Think of it as a good base for your bracelet design."
3.0,Odd fit. Kind of boxy.
3.0,"Waaaaaaay shorter than what is shown in the picture! Also, a size small was extremely tight on me, and at 5’2” 117 lbs I wear a size 0-2 in most clothing."
3.0,"Material is thin, I really liked that about it at first but the first wash it seemed like it all pulled up and is even thinner than before."
3.0,"The earrings are unique and really cute. However, they are made out of a cheap material. And the hoops came with a janky clasp. I did not return though because the cuteness of the earrings make up for it"
3.0,Two of the bags came apart at one of the seams.
3.0,"Overall, you get what you pay for. This is plastic- not metal. It came packaged like a necklace you would buy at the $1 Galore store. Very cheap looking. I have wore it twice now- it is holding up but I am also being very careful with it. It is light and plastic material. It does have very pretty details but I was hoping for some sturdier materials. All in all its just ""ok"" ."
3.0,Love them.! So cute
3.0,I do think the price is a little high compared to the quality and materials.
3.0,"NOT BAD, BUT NOT impressed !"
3.0,"This sleeve doesn't compare with scratchmenot.  I am not sure why scratchmenot stop selling their sleeve on amazon.  Anyways, this sleeve does not stay on.  I think the reason is that the fabric is not stretchable so they made the shoulder part longer for easier put on.<br /><br />It's very easy for babies to take off once they learn to lower their hands and the shoulder.  As a workaround, we use a rubber band to tight up the back and roll it into DD's shirt"
3.0,Nice fit on top great fabric definitely not floor-length way too short
3.0,"I'm 5 feet tall and ordered a size S. It's a nice material, but looks shapeless and kind of dowdy. Unbuttoning the top buttons helps a little, but I don't love it."
3.0,One of them won’t open/close after I opened it the first time and now I cannot get it off my ear.
3.0,They a really pretty but a little to big
3.0,This is only one bat not five
3.0,This is a very soft shaw like blanket. It is warm and easy to wear. There are 2 well placed buttons that keep it closed in front. The only reason I took stars off is because there is a hole in one of the seams. I can fix a lot of things but seams are difficult at best to fix.
3.0,"A bit larger and heavier than I expected,"
3.0,"This Album has a really nice shape, I am happy to get it at a good price. It has 30 big pockets in 10 pages which can fit most bills, I've been using it a while and it looks to be of good quality. The only disadvantage as other users have mentioned is you can not add pages to it! and I would have liked that the size of each pocket would have been one inch higher to fit my very huge banknotes. If you keep adding bills to your collection, you should look for an album that has more pages and pockets to hold more bills, before you ran out of space, but overall it's very good for a start."
3.0,"I usually purchase a medium, but this bralette in size medium was very very large on me. The body strap didn't even stay around my ribcage. I wear a 34 C bra for reference. Product did seem quality, but had to be returned do to awkwardly large band. Make sure to double check your size!"
3.0,Lots of similar items in the pack. Smaller than expected
3.0,The plastic protectors tear easily
3.0,We had to cut the entire shirt up the back
3.0,"Sizes run small.  I'm normally a XXL and this one is snug.  Buy one size bigger, if you can.<br /><br />Zipper is left-handed like a girls jacket, and it's hard to zip.  Maybe it needs wax?<br /><br />Other than that - it does what I wanted it to do, and the price is outstanding.  Don't expect too much and you'll be fine."
3.0,Love the product  by it was half  gone because  of poor packaging
3.0,"The fit is good, I purchased a medium. I am 5'7&#34; and 140lbs. I was very disappointed in the fabric though, it is a very cheap 92% polyester 8% spandex. For the price it's an ok dress, but it's really hard for me to get past the feel of the fabric. I am keeping the dress to wear around the house, but it is just not quite nice enough to wear on a special occasion."
3.0,Nice warm coat but lightweight. The three stars are because the black tie is not as big as pictured but rather a thin strap and the side loops broke after only 2 days.
3.0,"very trendy, super cute style, but the buttons were odd"
3.0,"Nice earrings, just wish they were bigger"
3.0,material very thing.
3.0,they a baggy
3.0,Slippers appear to be as advertised. I did not like the low back strap or end of the slippers where your heel rests. Didn't feel right for me.
3.0,"These leggings are very comfortable, but don't fit my long legs very well.  I sure wish they made them in a tall length!"
3.0,The top fit amazing but the bottom was weird in me. I don’t have the biggest booty but do have a fit one and it was very unflattering
3.0,It does not have a good description. These are over the knee boots but it's described as a regular calf boot. I sent them back. But they were real nice boots just not what I ordered
3.0,The insoles is hard but overall they are comfortable
3.0,"It smells like if I were to hold pennies, real silver doesn't give off a smell but this does.<br />I have a lot of silver jewelry, so I'm skeptical about this piece. it looks real and it has nice weight to it but the fact that it gives off a smell is reason for concern."
3.0,It’s cute but a little smaller than I thought it would be.
3.0,"It is very beautiful, but the lunch box can not stand up and too thin."
3.0,My son has been playing for awhile.  He wears alleson pants for short pants and he wears A4 long pants when he needs to wear the long pants.  I bought both these 'short' pants in a medium and a large and thought I'd return the one that didn't fit.  They both don't fit.  Mediums way too small.  Larges are swimming on him.  So disappointed to not have one pair work.
3.0,"Worked out well but took some doing they need to send instructions,"
3.0,They look good and fit good but everything falls out of the pockets when you sit!
3.0,"I really liked it for my forward helix, its 6mm which is perfect. The only problem is the head is constantly falling off. CONSTANTLY! like im talking every other day I sleep in it. But the color and size are great. just have to keep and eye on it a lot and constantly tighten it"
3.0,It seems to be a well made purse but was shipped without a handle so it was sent back.
3.0,The design is cute.  They fit strange.  They just didn’t fit right.  They were just straight with no definite place for heels.  Cute to wear short term but not comfortable for all day wear as an ER nurse.  They twisted in my shoes and they fell down.  They are  definitely a novelty item.
3.0,My 8 yr old has a hard time with the zipper. It’s not the “ better quality” zipper & it’s hard to put 2 sides together zip.
3.0,It was too small all overall But a beautiful dress
3.0,One foot s always a little bigger than the other but they fitand once they get wet they will stretch a little so over all I am please with these shoes
3.0,"My chest (32F)... overtook the entire shirt. It kinda turned into a crop top. It looks good on folks with teeny bits though, and it’s still comfy + good material so to my smaller folks this might be perfect for you!"
3.0,It does not stretch very well. it has a weird smell so washed it a few times first. The color has not faded yet. It’s super cute love the print and colors. The sleeves are a little long but may just be because of my daughter being tiny but chunky.
3.0,"Nice enough for the price, but the pattern is just printed on, so looks a bit cheap. It is nice and white.  Couldn't really wear it as a nice dress, but as beach cover up it's decent. I am impressed with the delivery though. Was due around the 2nd week in Aug and I received it about third week of July, A+ for that."
3.0,"These are really pretty colors.<br />They are really cheaply priced, which is a plus.<br />They tend to just smoosh though. I didn't find them particularly comfortable. In the end, Comfort is more important.<br /><br /> I ended up donating all of them to charity. I hope someone enjoys them!"
3.0,They are long which is nice but a little tight. I just needed them for under things so it works for me
3.0,"These are.. ok. They are very pretty bright colors but I’m looking for a headband that will stay put when my hair is in a ponytail. These, unfortunately, were not the ones. I put on one and within minutes it’s was on the move, and I was only at home watching tv. I bought these because I have physical therapy three times a week an my hair tends to take on a mind of its own while I’m there.<br /><br />I’m keeping them though because they are cute and should be fine when my hair is braided."
3.0,"I had hoped for something I could wear as a first layer, but these felt kinda slimy and cold."
3.0,I wear a 2XL and it’s a very pretty dress for church but it was too small in the chest and stomach. And I ordered a 2XL. I say if you order this order at least a size or two bigger.
3.0,It stretches & doesn't fit as well after you wear it for a while.
3.0,Ok fabric; not that comfy
3.0,"Ok for very light rain, but it is very thin and if you are caught in a downpour you will not stay dry"
3.0,I would recommend buying the next size up
3.0,"very tight, hurt my ears"
3.0,I Stick on isn't the greatest. Wore it for 2 hours and felt it would fall off at any moment. It Does give push up though.
3.0,"It's cute, the material wasn't what I was expecting. I haven't worn it yet."
3.0,The size was oK but the way it was put together was sorta cheap. We also bought a red one and it was a much better quality. They were just for a one night theatrical show but my daughter was not liking the quality of this one and has no interest in using it for anything in the future.
3.0,A lot thinner then i was expecting it to be but most likely my fault for not fully reading the description & measurements of it
3.0,Straps too long. Workmanship disappointing. Color brighter than pictured
3.0,Too small to wear with jeans a d boots might be okay for young girls
3.0,"Not real leather, but looks good enough."
3.0,The glasses and cases are cheaply made.
3.0,"It's different,  however, it's a Quartz movement."
3.0,"It’s not high waisted, more like mid waist."
3.0,"I like this dress it’s cute and fits me well (I am big Chested so this was a pleasant surprise). However it is thin and cheap feeling. Should’ve been priced less. I am afraid when I take it on and off I’ll rip the delicate straps. Thinly sewn and made. But it’s unique and I’ll keep it. Hopefully I can sew it when the straps rip. Note that the elastic is only in the front, not the back. So It can be a little tricky to get over your chest"
3.0,"It's a pretty dress, but too tight around the arms."
3.0,Not comfortable.  Veey odd fit and memory foam is smaller than the slipper just an awkward fit
3.0,Love the feeling of the material and the size was great however the print on the front was off center so it drove me crazy but overall love the shirt
3.0,"Package arrived quickly, plugs came in a plastic baggie inside of a paper mailer - not wrapped up. Plugs are in good condition & seem to be carved well. However, the Sodalite plugs in the picture are higher grade (darker blue) than what was sent."
3.0,"Took these laces to a music festival. Put them on my sneakers and once the sun went down I turned them on. They were awesome and I got so many compliments UNTIL about 3-4 hours later, I noticed my right shoelace wasn't even on anymore. I pressed the button and it turned on. I jumped a few times and it turned off again. I kept having to press the power button every few minutes until I just gave up and left it off. I wish I could give these 5 stars bc they were awesome while they lasted, but if they're gonna die on you after a few hours then that doesn't merit the 5 stars at all."
3.0,I did not receive the print I ordered. The background color was as listed but the print was different than pictured. I normally wear a medium but decided to order a large as I wanted a looser fit. I may return it for an XL.
3.0,"This is a well made watch band.  easy to install and material used is high quality.<br />as far as the quality and fitting are concerned, I have no complain, however, there are much better valued, exact same watch band, in Amazon.  The brand, Wristology, is charging very hefty price for their marketing and brand name.  If you do not care much about the brand, you can find much better valued, same bands in the amazon."
3.0,Glasses are heavy & larger than half moons.
3.0,"Very cute but not balanced. All of the bows have the ring for the chains connection soldered in the same spot, rather than having a left and right bow. So when the chain was added you end up with it sitting high on one side and low on the opposite. Still, for the price I plan to wear it and realize/hope no one will be looking at it on me that closely."
3.0,Case was nice but sent back because the rotation was making loud noises.
3.0,I’m<br />Always a size S I’m 5.7 and 125 pound.<br />It’s very small:(
3.0,"They seem like OK gloves, I guess, but the stench is utterly unbelievable. I'll let them sit until that improves... (it's a mystery... I'm no stranger to leather gloves, but, well, these are bad)"
3.0,I liked aron only thing wasThe pink was more neon bright color than I was expecting
3.0,Pretty top but runs small.
3.0,Just did not look right once on.
3.0,I recently bought this polishing cloth and all I can say is that you get what you pay for.<br />It is large but it is very thin and doesn't have much of the polish in it. It works ok and is worth the money. I'm just disappointed and should have spent more money to get a better one.
3.0,Would have been 5 stars but did not come with and watchband spring bars.
3.0,The reviews were very accurate when they said these sweatshirts run small. They run VERY small.  I want my sweatshirt to be kinda roomy and comfy not tight.  I usually wear a large so I ordered an XL and it was so snug and uncomfortable. I would size up times 2.
3.0,thought is was it would fit on my watch but is ok product
3.0,"The fabric seemed nice on this and it was pretty as pictured but the only reason I give 3 stars is the fit. The waist is high and the body length too short for a taller person. I am 5’10” and would need a completely different fit. If you are more compact, this should fit well."
3.0,Really cute<br />Cheap material runs small
3.0,Lense size diaopointing
3.0,this was a gift for my son's girlfriend looks just like the pic very nice
3.0,Not enough fabric. It didn’t fit. I packed it up and returned it the day I received it.
3.0,Design is beautiful but material is very fragile. Make sure you ring is packaged/delivered in a sturdy box/packaging or your ring may be compromised.
3.0,I really wanted to love this swimsuit but it didn’t fit as I expected.Great material and beautiful color.
3.0,The quality of the shirt is wonderful and the fabric is great. When my fiance put it on we were very disappointed that it didn't fit him at all. When I order this shirt I took his measurements and grabbed one that was a size bigger than what was suggested. I'll have to send this one back and hope I can find another one since we got this for our wedding next month. Hopefully it doesn't take too much time since he needs a shirt for our wedding day....
3.0,"The strap broke off after a few months . The rubber piece it self from the shoe where it attached ,  not from the button . Also , the graphic would be cute if it were detachable , the light went out rather quickly ."
3.0,"Looks great. Has a second hand (unlike Movado) which is important because sometimes after pulling out the stem to set it and pushing it back in, the watch doesn't restart, and without the second hand you wouldn't know. I pulled and pushed it a few times and the second hand started moving again.<br /><br />The band is pretty awful: stiff and almost too big to fit through the hasp. Before I put it on the first time, I manually curved the band so I wouldn't put a lot of stress on the pins that hold it to the watch. I have another watch from these folks (identical frame, different face) and one of those pins popped off when I pulled too hard. Go easy and it's okay.<br /><br />I paid about $6 including shipping from China. Can't beat the price!"
3.0,I followed the recommendations and ordered a size smaller and they were still too big.  They run about a size and a half too big.  Other wise they are cute and good quality.
3.0,"I loved the print on this.  Flattering.  I'm, 5'9 and 185 and small chested.  This REALLY flattened me out - maybe it was tight around the chest and that was the reason.  I tried putting padding in just to see if it would help, but it hardly made a dent....just too constrictive.  (it was like I was 'bound'.  Other than that, the 16 was a good fit .. bummer, returned it."
3.0,Not real sterling silver. After a few wears the silver began to fade.
3.0,They sent a free gift... It was chain you would find attached to a bathroom tub stopper... What a gift 😢...<br /><br />The little black pouches were nice though.
3.0,it will change to silver but solid ring
3.0,"cheap, falls apart easily"
3.0,"This is really large,  and I have big wrists. I can literally wear as an anklet. There is no way to make it smaller."
3.0,"I have a large bust, 34DD, and this didn't give me any waist, so I looked huge.I gave it away."
3.0,I love the style. But I got a large since I know it's Asian sized and it fit my body fine but the neck hole and shoulders are much too wide.
3.0,"After looking at the quality of the shoe, they do not seem the same as other shoes in the line. The clarity of the inside label is fuzzy. Typically, shoes in the line do not have hazy labels. My son has 5 other shoes in this line and these shoes do not seem like the same quality."
3.0,"This shirt is just ok. Kind of cheap looking material, similar to shirts you can get at Walmart for half the price. I wouldn't wear this shirt anywhere other than as a pajama top. I bought 3 of them, and the colors are pretty much what I was expecting."
3.0,Comfortable. As described. Color off a little but still nice.
3.0,"Just a heads up, there are sequins on the front of the shirt on the leopard spots. I didn't notice this in the pictures or in the description.  Not crazy about them, will probably return."
3.0,Comfortable pants but no lining and the material is very thin. I ordered xl and I’m 5’5 155 lbs
3.0,"For the price it's pretty, really fake plastic stone.  But cute enough to give my little granddaughter one so we have matching rings."
3.0,"I bought these sleeves to cover tattoos while at work, unfortunately they are very thin and my tattoos can be seen through them. They are comfortable and are cooling and appear to be quality built.  Overall they just fell short of my expectations."
3.0,"Seems like a nice watch, but I bought this for my 10 year old son since it said this was a boys watch.. it fits my husband perfectly. This watch is huge and very misleading"
3.0,"It’s a dry-clean only item.  I was about to order other colors.  Great fit-but at a continual pay-out.  So, one is enough."
3.0,"Way oversized, but I should have looked for dimensions."
3.0,"The lettering on the inside is messed up, but in good condition otherwise"
3.0,One tube had a hole in it. I had to use a patch kit to keep us afloat. The straps were a great idea.
3.0,"GET IT MUCH BIGGER THEN YOU WOULD USUALLY!!! It is very tight and makes me flat chested, but its still super cute and I can squeeze into it."
3.0,"I still wore it but fit was off , the waist is at an off spot"
3.0,Wearable for its intended use but the metal band is tight and cannot be worn for extended periods of time.
3.0,Fits small heads. Only one size fits all is offered
3.0,"My husband wanted to get our grandson a camo bucket hat like his, so we found this one on Amazon and ordered it. While it looks great and seems to be good quality, it is WAY too big for our little grandson. In fact, it fits my husband. It was found on Amazon after doing a search for toddler hats, so even though it says &#34;one size fits all&#34;, I don't think it should have been listed among children's hats. My husband should have read the reviews before ordering, but finding it listed as a children's hat and the &#34;one size fits all&#34; description is misleading! It obviously does not fit all. The hat also took an unusually long time to arrive after ordering it. If you want to receive it sooner, choose a different shipping option than the free standard shipping"
3.0,"I rated three stars as it fit somewhat small and the skirt was a odd, stiff fabric. I did the like the look , it was just hard to put on as it was a tad small."
3.0,Lights always look better in the dark photos. These ones are just super cheap looking both in the dark and in the light in person. They would be best marketed to 5 year old girls
3.0,To early to say
3.0,"I really like this,but I found out it is a man's bracket,after I ordered it lol only had 6 strands not 7,I got over it."
3.0,Cute sweater and overall good quality. The size was accurate for a 6t. The tags were sewn on the outside. It took some time but I was able to carefully cut them off without damaging the sweater.
3.0,Never wore them because I can’t pull off this look. You have to look like that kid playing Paul in the new dune movie. I look more like Zach galifianakis
3.0,"I purchased these pants as I was searching for natural cotton pants and these seemed to fit my need. I carefully ordered these pants along with a similar pair of navy cotton-linen from another seller. (That review was posted previously.)<br /><br />The waistline on the pants I received, measured larger than the online description indicated. This caused extra bunching for me in the waist area. I am 5’ 135 lbs and I usually wear a large, but I sized up to a XXL in order to achieve the bagginess I desired and because I was unsure of the fabric quality/shrinkage.<br /><br />Since these pants are cotton fabric, they were washed in a cool gentle wash, 3-4 minutes dryer time and hung to completely dry. Even after taking care, they shrunk app 1 size. This is disappointing, since I wanted loose, cotton-linen pants with frequent washing which would still be comfortable during the summer months.<br /><br />These pants are constructed of a heavier, rougher cotton fabric that (so far) has not bled dye. Also, since they are cotton, I expect some dye fading after numerous wearings. Because of the fabric heaviness, they were not as cool wearing as I wanted them to be. Perhaps they would soften more with repeated washings.<br /><br />The inseam length was ankle length for my small frame upon first wearing. After careful laundering, however (see above) the length shrunk app 1”-2”. It hits at a much higher ankle length at the moment.<br /><br />These pants are baggy (if sized up), with pockets, and they arrive quickly. The pockets on my frame however, proved to be excessively bulky and would need to be removed. This may not be the case with every wearer however.<br /><br />The buyer needs to be aware, when ordering that they may be different than US garments in construction consistency, construction and basic sizing. I advise buyers to check carefully (and compare sizing) before ordering and especially before pre-washing garments. Also - Please remember these pants are shown worn baggy, which means sizing up 1-2 sizes depending upon your hip size if you wish the final garment to look as pictured.<br /><br />I doubt I will be purchasing more of this style of pants as they did not meet my needs in terms of fit, cut, construction or wearability. As always, this is just my opinion. They may work differently on your frame.<br /><br />I strive to write honest, frank, true to life reviews in order for future readers to make informed purchases. I do not and will not write false reviews for items that do not meet up to my expectations or needs. My reviews are my own opinion, honest and to the point."
3.0,it came with one pin broken.
3.0,These barely fit my size 13 feet. Do not seem to XX-large as advertised.
3.0,Cute little dress but too short for me. Ultimately I gave it to my daughter because it's a little young for me.
3.0,Cute but fabric is anything but soft or comfortable.<br />Lace was stiff and itchy.<br />Returned
3.0,"I've got his to Cosplay Spock (original TV Star Trek series) and it fits the bill. It is not a high quality wig (not expected for this price anyway) but will last long enough to be worn several times without any issues. The one I received will need a small trim on the bangs to make it really straight cut as in the image, but overall fits fine. It comes in a good package and includes a wig net and small silica gel pack. I would recommend for Cosplayers that don't want to spend too much in their costumes."
3.0,"Ok, will do"
3.0,"I’m 5’6 and 140lbs and needed to buy a large for them to fit comfortably. I like the pockets, and the length is fine too, but I accidentally tossed them in the dryer and they shrank considerably. Be sure to hang them dry."
3.0,"ordered a medium, way too small. also incredibly itchy."
3.0,"Has no warmth value, very thin.<br />More of a novelty sweatshirt than something you'd wear outside"
3.0,good price but not good quality
3.0,"The sweater is a lighter grey instead of black, from ts good once on. But does not stretch at all. Difficult to get on and off. Overall I will keep it but won't be ordering any more."
3.0,"The material is thinner than I hoped, particularly the strap. Although I don't carry much I worry over time it would just break while I'm carrying it. I think for occasional use it'll be fine though."
3.0,Price was right but item was just “ok.”  Short in the arms.  Quality was mediocre.  I probably would not buy again.
3.0,Fabric falls apart easily.
3.0,"Picture no where near as vibrant as in the picture. Very cheaply done. Actual sweater quality was fine.  But my niece liked it, it was her Xmas present and she was super excited to get it. That's what matters."
3.0,It is real see through!!
3.0,"Exactly what I was expecting, will be great walking the dog or pushing the snowblower.  My only regret is the elastic adjustment doesn't hold,  but I will have to deal with it.  For that reason I give it 3 stars"
3.0,Super cute and love this little shirt. It has shrunk though…Regular material.
3.0,"Love the dress, fits well, soft, stretchy and great colors!  Sadly, after the first cold wash  it now looks like I've washed it 12 plus times in hot water.  My daughter loves it too much as its soft and she’s autistic so i get to keep it.  Had other items for her from thia company and they all did the same wash thing but have to make life easier and she likes the softness"
3.0,This is a gift I'll have to comment about it later
3.0,not soft
3.0,"Good quality product but got a little short in length. I have not washed yet, we will see if it will shrink more, if it happens it will not give more to use"
3.0,"I bought two different brand from amazon. Compare to the other brand, the other one is softer.<br />The color for this one looks nice and no discoloration, same as the picture shown.<br />This one also has very strong elasticity.<br />It might be a little bit longer than I expected but it’s on the right size range.<br />It’s thin but not see through.<br />The two stars I didn’t give are due to the softness and comfort compared to the other brand."
3.0,Not a true fir
3.0,For the price you can buy a rug or floor mat and cut a hole in the middle and save yourself $40.
3.0,"Cute rings, but tarnish within a couple days of wearing them."
3.0,"Cute necklace and bracelet for my paw patrol loving girl. However, a little disappointed that it did not include the hair clip, as advertised."
3.0,Plastic lenses scratch and nick easily. I really loved these until they scratched
3.0,Two problems with this was that it's a little small but the bigger problem and it's my fault for not knowing how but I cannot even get the pins out of a broken Invicta. I know how but I just cannot them out. If the ends of the band where it meets the watch was a little less precise I could probably get it. I did let a jeweler in the mall try it and he came back and said he didn't have his tools. I don't think he do it. I'll find it on you tube.
3.0,"Shoes look great and fit true to size. However, when used in the beach the sand gets inside A LOT. Won't be buying them again or recommending them for that reason."
3.0,"The fit is great, but the colors are not true to the picture. They’re much more pink and pale blue than I had expected."
3.0,"I was wearing my new bracelet with pride for about 3 days, then I noticed I had lost my &#34;I love my soldier&#34; charm and my &#34;Army mom&#34; charm :-( I was fortunate to find &#34;Army mom&#34; charm. The clasps that hold the charms on bracelet are thin and does not hold the charms on bracelet properly that is why I am only giving it 3 stars."
3.0,"I LOVED this dress online. However, in person the way the &#34;lace&#34; on top is cut and trimmed, it doesn't give a clean edge and leaves the dress too cheap-looking for the event I was attending. Also, in the photo the top looks more &#34;light&#34; or delicate than it is - in texture I guess. It was a bit more solid than I thought it would be from the picture.<br />It's a bit small for a four, especially since the zipper gets stuck. You might want to order one size up."
3.0,I love the sweater. The pants are too short and the elastic in the waist is awkward and weird and I don’t like them at all!!
3.0,The slit is a lot higher than the pic.
3.0,"The buckle and belt are a little on the large side, and I find this ratcheting system to frankly be more trouble than it's worth.  I wore it exactly once, and have since gone back to traditional leather belts.  I really wanted to like this, but in the end it's not my cup-o-tea.  It is however extremely well made and of high quality."
3.0,Cute but the pockets are accidentally sewn too small.  Frustrating because I had to open the pocket and resew it.  returned the first  one and second had same issue but with other pocket
3.0,"Impulse buy.  I wanted a Rasta one piece and this delivered with quickly.  I'm 5'4"" 115 lbs, flat as a board but wider at the hips.  The top was padded with cups which was nice.  You can see some side boob which gave a nice illusion of boobage to my mosquito bites.  I'm pretty petite but I found the hip/leg part to be really annoying. It cut into my hip fat pretty hard and was a uncomfortable.  Someone else posted the they were shorter and heavier than me but thought the small fit her great.  Maybe she's used to uncomfortable bathing suits?  I didn't like it, but I felt the medium may have been too big.  I loved the Brazilian thong style and the backless cross straps in the back.  I wanted to love this so bad but it was just too uncomfortable and too tight in my crotch and hips.  Also, I thought it wouldn't be so wise to be walking around wearing a pot leaf when it's still not technically legal yet.  I returned this but it inspired me to keep looking for something similar in style."
3.0,I was not expecting this to be so thin. You can see through it. If that's okay with you then go ahead. But I would prefer a thicker material so it wouldn't get ruined easily.
3.0,I ordered two sizes up after reading reviews and that was a mistake. It swallowed me whole. I would stick with true to size. It’s a cute dress but the sleeves were really puffy. It’s much cuter in the picture than in person.
3.0,"The thin material bunches both up the legs and down the waist too easily. They feel awesome to the touch, but they do not stay in place."
3.0,"Because they are white, they are see through and therefore additional shorts should be worn under them."
3.0,"nice hat in terms of style but I must be a larger head size, maybe if I dampen it it will stretch. Also the crown is too short to really get this snugly fitting fully down onto a larger head, but for smaller heads it could work well. I like that the brim is wider for more protection."
3.0,The leather little thin
3.0,"Ordered white, got blue anyway..."
3.0,"It is little bit knotty to buckle the strap for 5years old. Except that, comfortness, design, design, design everything is perfect."
3.0,keep shopping
3.0,To heavy for my ears.
3.0,"Bought it for my wife, she likes it even  It is a little too big on Her wrist."
3.0,"I struggle with three stars.  This would be a 5 star review but, IF only I were 100% sure it was 14 k. This is a lovely ,delicate and substantial pendant. The color seems to almost be a cross between a bright silver and a rich yellow gold tone. It’s bright. My suspicion is that this piece is “dipped” in yellow gold. I do wear it with a 14k yellow gold chain"
3.0,Like it but too big for my wrist
3.0,"I ordered two, the blue and the ivory.  I love the blue.  Very cute and I get lots of compliments.  The only reason I give three stars is because the ivory is a lot smaller then the blue.  Even though I ordered the same size.  I would like to order the other colors but I'm just not sure which size to buy."
3.0,Eeek! This shirt is much more cropped than it looks in the picture! Too cropped for me so I’m using it for PJs. Otherwise it’s ok- the material isn’t see through and is comfy.
3.0,bows were different color than the tutus so doesnt match like shows in picture
3.0,This fits just right. Can't wear with long sleeves. This has buttons but it's jus for show because you can't button it.
3.0,"it is very easy to use, blends with pants and is good quality, is just that is very tight and not as long, therefore i think i will not be able to use it for too long as it is not as strechy as i thought and sometimes feel restricted."
3.0,The socks were not as long as I suspected and are a bit tight trying to get on.  Other than that they are good quality and comfy.
3.0,Ran very small. Like would probably need to size up 2-3 sizes for this to look cute for me. Returned.
3.0,They are very cute but didn't last. My granson is a toe walker so that might have caused some of the reason they didn't last. The feont toe seam came a part within 6 weeks. Thats why I only gave it 3 stars.
3.0,"Overall the swimsuit is high quality & exactly like the picture. I agree that the shoulders are a little too loose which takes away from the style of the bathing suit, meaning I'll have to find a way to fix it. But other than that it's definitely worth the price for the quality you receive. This is ideal for someone with broad shoulders."
3.0,Very very short !!! Fits everywhere else
3.0,"SOME OF THE SOCKS WERE TOO SMALL AND DIDT FIT, HAD TO THROW THEM OUT! ONLY KEPT 2 OF THEM. WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN."
3.0,Ear loops are relatively long and are not adjustable. I could not get the right fit on this mask. No better than a regular surgical mask since it isn't adjustable and doesn't seal properly.
3.0,"Shirt was ok, did not receive my stickers."
3.0,The arms are tight. I read the reviews and ordered up.
3.0,I wear a 10 and these were  too small.
3.0,Turned colors and looks dirty now
3.0,"I bought this for my brother who is in high school and he seems to really like wearing it. I did notice that the zipper was having some issues, so I’m wondering how long it will hold up.<br /><br />On a scale from poor to excellent, I rate this one “good”..could be better"
3.0,Definitely doesn't fit as cute as the photos make it look and the sizing seemed a bit off. It is not as 'sweater' fabric as I expected. UPDATE: The seller contacted me and apologized for the dress not meeting my expectations. They gave me a full refund on the order. I appreciated the quick customer service and give that 5 stars!
3.0,"I ordered white, but I got yellow."
3.0,Neck opening is a bit too wide and has bib riding too far down on chest.
3.0,These charms are cute and sturdy. Clasp on easy and stay put. Simple to remove. Would like them not “F-r-i-e-n-d-s” tv show based. Would also prefer them blue over pink details. Alice in wonderland inspired charms should have more iconic colors.
3.0,Very cute but lights didn't work
3.0,"Nice fabric, quality fine for it's purpose. It's just not a dress for those of us with bosoms and I'm only a 36 C.  Fit fine everywhere but in the top.Just cut really high waisted."
3.0,"not a huge fan of the material, the model looks way cuter in this shirt than I do!<br />could be cute but definitely go a couple sizes up if you are wanting an oversized look!"
3.0,The dress is fine. Quality was better than i had expected. The embroidery looks stunning and very detailed but the arms are very tight. The sewing on the middle of the dress is bit off. Other than that its wearable. 🤷‍♀️
3.0,Shirt itself looks great but instead of xlarge it was the size of a medium buy 2 sizes up
3.0,This product is adorable and I've enjoyed using it for a couple months. However after a couple months the weight of my keys has loosened the clasp and now my keys won't stay on.
3.0,Fits OK. Good to wear around the house.
3.0,"Being significantly taller than &#34;average&#34;, I appreciate the length of these leggings. They're nearly opaque, even in the rain, and warm on cool days.<br /><br />Watch out for cat claws and sharp corners. Any little snag will turn into a full-length run with no warning."
3.0,"Half the batteries didn’t work, some died within minutes.<br />They are pretty heavy as well but that was to be expected"
3.0,"Cute hat, super cozy, but I was sent the wrong color. I ordered a light/icy blue and was sent royal blue."
3.0,"Wow, kind of disappointing. I recommend sizing up a full size. I went up a half size and they were a bit too tight. I'm returning for a full size bigger than my usual size. Also, the finger pull strap is just for looks. It immediately broke off the moment I tugged. The strap is cheaply glued on and I was honestly shocked it came off so easily. I'm hoping a bigger size will keep that from happening. I have other Chelsea boots, and using the pull strap is how you get them on... they are a pretty color (brownish grey) and I'm still trading them in. But I'm pretty disappointed"
3.0,They were too tight to get on..  holds/supports but hard to get on and off.
3.0,Great jacket but fits very small. Bought a size bigger and it was still too small. 😢
3.0,"Super cute but they’re pretty large. I only use the pink and tan earrings I actually have the green away, just a color I don’t really wear."
3.0,"Nice charm, but smaller than expected. It's very difficult to see that the stones are pink."
3.0,"I HAVE 46' HIPS SO I USUALLY BUY MY DRESSES TO FIT MY HIPS AND THEN DO WHATEVER ADJUSTMENTS ARE NEEDED.<br /><br />THIS WAS NO DIFFERENT. THE PICTURE HERE LOOKS BETTER THAN THE ACTUAL DRESS. ALSO, I TRIED IT ON AND BENT OVER TO PICK SOMETHING UP FROM THE GROUND AND THE ZIPPER RIPPED!! YES... BEFORE I EVEN GOT TO WEAR IT, IT RIPPED. THE DENIM IS VERY SOFT TO TOUCH, BUT ALSO FEELS CHEAP.."
3.0,My husband usually wears a large. 6ft 200lbs.. yet he had to order a 2xl in order to get the fit right
3.0,It does run small.
3.0,Tear pretty easily
3.0,Too small. Love the print.
3.0,"I'm 5' 8&#34; and this was too short on my torso. Its a large and it fit my mom thats 5' 5&#34; 120lbs perfectly. She's definitely not large, she's a small/ medium. I recommend ordering 1 size larger than your comfortable with."
3.0,This is not true size
3.0,I wanted to love this. I wear a 38C in bras and the cups were incredibly small. My girls were fell straight out of the bottom and we're smashed flat when in the proper location.  It fit around perfectly so I would guess it would be for a much small cup size with around a 36-38 band size.  It is cute and fairly durable though!
3.0,A little too bulky for a front pocket wallet in my opinion.
3.0,"After one washing, had to sew side seams just below waist band."
3.0,🤨🤔🤔🤔
3.0,Fit weird.  Returned.
3.0,"Love this tank and am a huge Schitts Creek fan. But it definitely runs small, so size up."
3.0,"When I first received these they were really tight, but like any set of &#34;leggings&#34; a few wears will get them fit to your body. I don't suggest wearing these every day, they are made of a thinner material and will eventually rip or tear. I wore mine several times a week and because I have big thighs the thigh area eventually faded then ripped. I still bought a second pair because I really do like them though, just keep this in mind if you're planning on wearing these daily."
3.0,These are super cute for price but they are cheaply made.
3.0,"The hat looked nice, but I didn't even take it out of the bag.  I ordered an Orange hat and this is more of a red color... not something I can use for hunting... I will probably return the item since the color wasn't as I had hoped for.."
3.0,"I wouldn't call them &#34;XL&#34; at all. Maybe a medium or large. While it lists the overall length, it doesn't list the finger length, and there lies the problem. The fingers only goes about 2/3rds down on my hand, and the gloves are quite tight ( I do have large hands ). The material is thin enough that I can see my skin through it, and there's a seam in the thumb that gives you a lump on top. The material isn't bad, and is quite stretchy. 3/5, but not what I'm looking for in gloves, and definitely not XL."
3.0,"It’s cute, but a little too big. I ordered the small and around the waist it’s a little loose. The adjustable straps are nice though. I also wish the bit at the bottom was a little flouncier like in the photo."
3.0,I purchased 12 different shirts from 12 manufacturers--all size large--this was the largest of all the shirts and fits like an XL.
3.0,"This item is just meh, I wouldn't say poor quality, but definitely cheap materials.  At first I thought it was really small, but once I placed items in it,  it seems to be a decent size.  In the pics I have two small throw blankets rolled up and placed sideways, for size reference. If I were to see this at a store,  I might be willing to spend $10-$15 on it, definitely not $32.  It came relatively quickly,  considering it came from China, in just about 2 weeks.  I would say pass, find a better quality item for that price."
3.0,"I usually take a medium in yoga pants but went up to a large in these. I probably should have tried x-large. Heavier, shiny material."
3.0,"We bought these ""Size 18-month"" shorts for our 19 month old son.  The quality and comfort are good.  The sizing is WAY too big.  They hang down nearly to his ankles but are big and baggy.  An odd look."
3.0,not sure what I think about it.
3.0,I got this for a gift to go into a holiday donation box for a school drive. Mt only complaint is it came in a zip lock bag with no directions so it is disappointing to use as a gift with no physical box or directions.
3.0,"Good socks... a bit too thin to be considered ""winter"" socks... at least in my neck of the woods... wish the toes and heels were a bit more padded... all in all... not a bad sock"
3.0,"I needed a shirt for a trip to Miami last fall... it fit the bill.. nice flow, soft fabric.. super easy to clean.  Paired well with white bermudas and white pants...however... here I sit at the end of March and this shirt is only good to wear in the house lounging or cleaning... it has faded terribly, and is pilly.. (due to washing)... For the price point, I'd probably purchase again, but this top falls into the category &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  This is a 1~2 season top."
3.0,"had to return, very small but cute"
3.0,"Its a beautiful robe, albeit it very light weight (could be a bathing suit cover up).  My only nit, and its a big one, is that the belt loops, and the inside ties are set way too high for an average height woman, which means not being able to have belt loops, which means having your belt fall down everytime yoy untie it.  It's here so I will make new belt loops and ties myself (but I shoukdn't need to!)"
3.0,Cross came out of infinity circle... It's been difficult to put back in...
3.0,"It's inconvenient to have it slip back through the belt loops, then you have to chase the ends around to get them back to the front. Holds together well once clipped though."
3.0,Thought it was going to be better materail and a little longer but its not bad
3.0,"I love the stone, but I didn't get the chain.  Now I have to find a chain, which I'm not thrilled about."
3.0,Not the material I expected. This shirt picks up sweaty smells quickly.
3.0,"The pants are pretty good size wise but once it came to quality it wasn’t. It has a bad, cheap material, the product overall is very overpriced for what they give,  It also  came with a stain beforehand. Not recommended"
3.0,"They are cute, just very fragile and small, not able to use long term."
3.0,"Great, cute product however 2 mistakes:<br /><br />1) The Amazon size description for this item is not correct. It's supposed to be size ""10.5-4,"" not ""10-5.4"" which is incorrectly stated in the listing and the actual white product label on the package, as pictured. SELLER - PLEASE UPDATE THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS LISTING.<br /><br />2) The shipper sent me a ""6-10.5"" toddler size which is much, much smaller then the ""10.5-4"" bigger kid size I'm looking for.  It's clearly printed on the Frozen box and does not match the white Amazon product label.<br /><br />I ordered 4 sets.  Only one order was actually the correct ""10.5-4"" size.  Luckily there is free returns so I'm returning the other 3.  I ordered more and hopefully they will get it correct and send me the larger ""10.5-4"" size that I need.  Great value, good price, fast shipping, fun holiday advent - just sent me the wrong size."
3.0,Half of the ham was cured the other half was not.
3.0,"How novel! A dress true to size and cute with flair! Fit on the first try! HOWEVER! The buttons on front are fake, you cannot unbutton them. What a hassle! Only way to wear is over your head. That's not convenient for dates!"
3.0,Great for  Summer weather And definitely not see through.
3.0,AFTER READING SOME OF THE REVIEWS....PEOPLE SEEMED UNSURE ABOUT THEIR PROTECTION.....I USED THE RFID SLEEVE YOU PUT YOUR CARD IN TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION...THEN PUT THE CARDS IN MY RFID BLOCKING WALLET....TO DOUBLE SECURITY AND HAVE ADDED PROTECTION FOR MYSELF AGAINST THE CRIMINALS WALKING AND SWIPING MY CARDS....
3.0,This hoodie is nice and thick to help keep me warm
3.0,"Not bad for the price, but definitely was hoping it’d look more flowy."
3.0,I didn’t like the combination of the color
3.0,The top fits perfectly and I love it but I was disappointed that the bottoms were too small for my 39 inch hips.  I ordered a large and I decided to keep the suit because the top alone was worth the price I paid.
3.0,"This is the first time I have purchased a pair of earrings like this one which goes along your ears instead of dangling down.  It was very hard for me to put on.  It took me over half-an-hour.  It is a different feel.  It really hurt my ears, but it is beautiful, thoe."
3.0,a bit shorter than expected or a 5t child
3.0,"the armpit was too small and had a faint stain on the front. The same size in different color (pale blue with dots) fit me perfectly, so i do not know why this is cut differently. It might fit as you wear it since the material is stretch, however, you never know.  My other dress I kept because I like it very much, but The fabric  does not breathe well, making it very hot. I will return the current item, but on the return site, it does not show this item, so I am not sure how i can return this,"
3.0,"I love the style of the shirt, but the armpits are way too small and cut lines in my skin."
3.0,Love the pattern but the pad is slightly thin.
3.0,These pants were for a wedding & they are way to big!!
3.0,Product should of been a medium but I went by the reviews
3.0,Están bonitos lo único que son muy largos
3.0,"Great colors, but the ""high waisted"" bottoms don't cover the belly button, and as a result, they kind of look like a diaper! I loved the idea of this suit, but in reality, it was to small and ill-fitting. Sending back...<br /><br />For reference, I am 138 lbs., 5'8"" and 34B - I ordered a medium"
3.0,"The necklaces are actually okay (you get what you pay for), but it did not come when it was supposed to."
3.0,"Fits well, not as warm as I thought it’d be.  But the color is really pretty."
3.0,gave it to my mom ..my fault got confuse with the size
3.0,"WAY WAY WAY too small!  The fabric has absolutely no give to it and it just didn't fit.<br />Also, I was hoping the pinks on the gray would be a bit more vivid, but they aren't - it doesn't look quite like the picture.<br />Sad because it was a pretty top and would have been SO cute this summer...<br />I may reorder - the blue instead - but in a couple of sizes up!"
3.0,I am 5-3” Fits from ankles till knees. Might fall short for longer legs.
3.0,Size not true to size. I always use S but this one even a M cannot fit.
3.0,Cheap.  Lenses fall out ... a lot.
3.0,It's smaller than it looks but works out just fine. Very good quality.
3.0,battery is heavy and no adjustment on the sleeves at wrist
3.0,I don't think it runs small. according to the chart I got an XL and its HUGE.  I'm 5.2&#34; 140lb. I would consider the Medium. but ended up just returning it.
3.0,"After discovering this brand/style of shorts randomly at Costco, I decided I needed another pair and was thrilled to find them on amazon for a reasonable price.  Unfortunately this pair came with a small hole in the front seam, which I didn’t notice until after I’d thrown away all the packaging.  It’s probably repairable and these are still soft, flattering shorts, but it’s a bummer when the quality is not what I expected."
3.0,"This is nice, formal, and not see through material. The stitching made the fit a bit strange with bunching in odd places such as by the shoulder blades. I have broad shoulders for a woman but there was still extra shoulder room."
3.0,"When I ordered no size definitions had been listed. Colorful, sturdy and nicely packaged but tiny. Depending on what design you choose could be impossible to see the graphic. The Bill Cipher is just barely all visible. For a child the size would be ok. If your getting for an adult mYbe not the best size."
3.0,"Liked that item is on the heavier side, it doesn't feel like a cheap peice of plastic, but it is missing a coin.. not happy with that. Checked the box in case it was in there, I would reattach it, but its not there.  Should be a quality check. 3 stars because ill have to return & get another one.."
3.0,The material is soft and the waist band is nice.  The are more see through that what I expected.  Wish they were a little more thicker.  Overall nice quality.  They will be fine with long shirts worn over them.
3.0,I bought 2 of these ugh I thought I read cotton but its polyester and this material makes me sweat plus it's not as large it does stretch to well. Gave it a 3 ⭐ cause the design is nice.
3.0,"It's just fine for a quick Halloween costume. Not amazing, just fine, but that was okay for the price."
3.0,"I was excited because these are inexpensive and cotton and involve a skirt, which is my preference. They're okay. The skirt doesn't really adequately cover my rear end as it does in the picture, but it's not bad. They're very comfortable, but also very thin. If I can do a warrior 1 and see my knee through the fabric, I will likely be over-sharing with the neighbor on the mat behind me anytime there's a forward bending position on the books. Since I wear stuff like this around the house and so forth, and I often layer with tights in the winter, I'll keep them."
3.0,"Very pretty but sizing description incorrect. It stated that it would fit up to a 2x. I'm an XL and it was too small. It it actually fit, I would have kept it. It would've been perfect as a beach cover-up."
3.0,"It's a comfortable shirt, but it's almost sheer in white. Plus it shows every little imperfection I try to hide 😅<br />But it'll make a comfortable under shirt or for around the house"
3.0,"Cute top, thicker fabric than I was expecting. The puffs on the shoulders are not attractive. As another reviewer stated, the garmet appears to have had shoulder pads at one time but they are no longer there. Sizing was slightly smaller than expected. I ordered an XL, my normal size, based on other reviews and a 1XL probably wouldve fit better. While I thought this garmet was incredibly cute, it didnt look well on me (a woman who had 3 children in  a span of four years and carries most of my extra weight around my midsection). I plan to return the product."
3.0,UPDATE - The Backpack might be awful but the Customer Service is Great! They tried to solve the issue and I was impressed by the response time.  We did end up going with a different backpack.  Perhaps we ended up with a lemon but we were not going to get the same one again.<br />Original:<br />It just came today and I'm Not Impressed.  Came with holes on sides.  Son leaving tomorrow and I don't have time to buy something else or I would return it. Don't buy!!
3.0,Love the bag. It’s slightly smaller than the typical Rebecca minkoff crossbodies . The biggest issue is I ordered a black bag and I received a navy one
3.0,"Pro: Got the white hat, was nice and clean.  It's snug fit, but I have an above average melon head.  The rings are individually wrapped, which is nice to give customer option.<br /><br />Con: The separate rings is a pro (as optional), but is also a con (for me personally) because it is very different to put it on.  Finger had blisters.  For now I left the rings off.  Some different vendors, pre-add the rings."
3.0,I had to return these because one seem was ripped. I am ordering another one because I like the belt a lot.
3.0,I purchased this head mountable harness for my contour HD camera to use while riding my Quad bike.It worked good while riding through smoothish terrain but in the fast heavy going the weight of the camera caused the harness to move around a little and had to be re-positioned  frequently.
3.0,"I received my new pair and I love it, no scratches or finger prints, and looks brand new<br />July 8,2019<br />The plastic piece by the nose was broken, looked like it’s been wore before, small scratches on the lens and the frame was very lose on one side. But was easy to return and get money back"
3.0,"Surprisingly thin fabric, was adequate in 40 degree weather, but any colder than that and I doubt it would do very much.  Did not fully cover my ears (size large head)"
3.0,"They are okay, overpriced and quality is just okay, One side of the bow wasn’t attached to the sandal."
3.0,It's larger then expected
3.0,"As you can see from the pics I attached, I ordered this dress in black...and received it in a burgundy color. It's pretty, but not what I wanted.  I ordered a size large after reading numerous reviews (I'm 5'3 about 135 lbs) tried it and it is a bit too big. The dress is definitely cute, so I'm returning this one and trying again for the black one I actually ordered-also going to try a medium and see how that goes."
3.0,"Hurts the ears when worn, not comfortable at all. But it does the job of hiding the fact that ur listening to music at work."
3.0,"I am 5'3&#34; and weigh 155 lbs and ordered and X-Large based on the reviews.  I am returning it and ordering a Large.  If you want it fitted, order a Large.  For a loose shirt, order an X-Large."
3.0,If you have thick hair... or waist length hair... this will not fit with your hair wrapped up in it. Very disappointing... although I do have A LOT of hair so maybe I should have assumed.
3.0,Fits somewhat smaller than anticipated. However I like the colour.
3.0,"The material is soft and washes well BUT I wish it was like 2 inches longer. I cannot lift my arms without my skin showing and at 38, no needs to see that! 🤪"
3.0,I love the look and style of these earrings but they were broken as soon as they arrived. I pulled them out of the pack and one of the chains were broken off and a bead is missing from the center part.
3.0,Interesting dress - solid material and construction and interesting design.  However- the design was not well thought through.  Should have had a zipper in the side to make dressing and undressing easier - the lacing up the back is quite cumbersome.  Would have been nice to set the lacing once and then use a zipper to get out of the dress
3.0,Box doesn't close well it is off center. Lock clip lose.  Faulty product.
3.0,Feels like t shirt material
3.0,The bottom dangles broke off quickly and the color chipped off as well. This belly ring is cute to wear to an event where it will be showing but it is not durable enough for everyday wear.
3.0,I love it but it didn’t fix the top 🥲
3.0,It's a good watch but at work the face cracked and now I have to replace it
3.0,"Would have been great, but was way too large.  Gave it to friend."
3.0,I like everything about it except for the size... it's a lot smaller than expected. I don't recommend this bag for school or for anything bigger than 2 books and a wallet (the big rectangle ones).
3.0,"Really heavy versus ones I've used that are similar, but you may like that."
3.0,Cheap cotton material. Comfy around-the-house dress. Not great for public.
3.0,"This gown was way too long, picture shows ankle length it puddled on the floor.  Also was too small. I purchased the size I normally wear but it was a snug, uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,very pretty but hurts quite much when wearing for a long time
3.0,The arms were too small. I could not used.
3.0,If you have a large top and a small bottom this product is not for you.
3.0,"Cute sweater, runs really large."
3.0,These are great. Be even better if they were actually kid size like description description says they are.
3.0,For the most part the band is nice but the party that faces up to the sun the most faded to an ugly color pretty quickly
3.0,They looked amazing but the frame seems fragile.
3.0,"I wanted to love this one more than I did.  This is a pretty charm - my favorite thing is how it sits on the chain.  It is never upside down like Pandora's so you will always see the sides or the top.  The design is nice and the gold detail really gives it a regality to it.  It's a larger charm so it sits a little higher and wider than other charms.  I love the shape.  However, I was hoping that the little flowers on the side would be a little more distinct - the hue is muted in reality. I think if the brighter colors (oranges for example) would be in the center instead of to the side, they would have stood out more). If you are looking for a charm with a lot of blue and sparkle this is it."
3.0,This was a cute dress but i did not care for the material. It was too thick and heavy. The dress felt too heavy and it was returned.
3.0,"I expect a sweat shirt to be nice and thick, this is very very thin. I am very disappointed my granddaughter picked it out online she lives in Montana and its cold this will not keep her warm, otherwise its nice but not good enough for cold weather."
3.0,Colors were way off.  Pink bottoms coral top.  O will be sending back.  Bought from another and received one with correct colors
3.0,"I like the band, but am unable to take one side off!  I've even taken it to the store where I purchased the watch and they are not able to remove it. I don't know if this is a problem of the watch or the band."
3.0,"Nice design, they are all on the small side, I do hope that when washed they do not shrink."
3.0,"I love the mask and the face part is good quality, but one of the ear straps pulled out of the mask after only 3 or 4 uses. It looks like only a small edge was sewn in, so it easily pulled through. It's too bad. I had already gotten lots of compliments on it."
3.0,Belt looked just like picture. Slightly on the small size
3.0,"THESE EARRINGS ARE VERY CUTE BUT WAY WAY TO TINY, CAN BARELY SEE IN MY EARS. PICTURE WAS VERY DECEIVING WHEN I ORDERED THEM, I HAVE MY EARS PIERCED FOR OVER 35 YEARS AND NEVER HAD SUCH TINY EARRINGS."
3.0,Good quality but is too small
3.0,The fit is really good. I just wish that the fabrics are thicker so it dose not show to much of the tummy.
3.0,I’m 5’5 & weigh around 165 pounds. A medium was too small & they were VERYY see through
3.0,will have it taken in a bit
3.0,well the beanie it self it a good quality beanie. it fits me good I got an average size head. the connection of the Bluetooth was simple to connect to. there is sound on both side of your ears the size of the speakers is about 2inches tall. the over use of the Bluetooth speaker does not seem to well for me. when i have it connected my music seems to cut off and on a lot especially when I put my phone in my pocket.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.
3.0,Love the dress but it requires hand washing and drying flat.
3.0,They were nice but they fit too big
3.0,"Cute, but need better material."
3.0,Very good coverage and protection but difficult to put on with one hand because the temples are very tight. Was a bit painful to wear until I put foam pads on the nose pieces.
3.0,"Its ok, but the style is not very flattering. I didn't like the material at all either, it feels like a starchy cotton t shirt if that makes any sense ?...im bummed because I looove the back zipper closure design,  but oh well!"
3.0,Will not work as intended so I will give it to my local Headstart classroom and take the tax donation.
3.0,"Sexy material, but the dress runs a little large and no way to adjust the strap. I will more than likely give this dress to a friend. Nothing wrong with the dress itself. I really like the dress and kinda disappointed that it would be beautiful on someone who can fit."
3.0,"A little short, fits as expected, but looks like pajama to me. I returned it."
3.0,"A lot of extra Sewing thread everywhere on the item.<br />And the poor Sewing quality as you can see!<br />For the design I would like to give 4 or 5 stars! But can’t like the quality so, I am thinking every lesser than 3 stars!"
3.0,It was a cut but sent back b/c tags were cut out so clearly it was used.
3.0,This design is adorable I love the cheetah pattern. The straps are adjustable I wish they could cross cross I think they would fit a little better. It is a little loose across the front so I use a small hair band to keep it from falling down
3.0,Too small cut for the Asian market
3.0,It's a nice little Pendant. The chain however is extremely flimsy.  Swap out the chain for a better quality one and it's a great pendant.<br />The pendant's glow is AMAZING!!
3.0,The weights were kinda uncomfortable but it was super soft.
3.0,not quite what we were looking for we returned
3.0,I bought them as a Christmas gift for my husband thinking large would fit. They seem to run small so he gave them to our teenaged  grandson. They’ll probably only fit this one season.
3.0,First use and the zipper got stuck.  Had to pull it off over my head.  Otherwise seemed fine. But being able to zip and unzip the jacket is a pretty core function that it can't perform.
3.0,"It really does push up your boobs and looks great but the cup size is way off! Its also really flimsy, and sort of weird because it pushes my breast up but also tighten and pushes down so from a side angle they look flatter. It’s probably best for girls who are a B or lower. For a girl who is a natural C or Up it is going to be way to tight and overflowing."
3.0,The clutch has a zipper that does not really enclose the entire top. On the clutch I received there is an area on each end which results in small items like a tube of lip gloss or change to slip out. The size is great and the quality of leather is fine too.
3.0,Cheap price. Cheap product
3.0,Cheap not worth it.
3.0,Fits need nice but can't be used as scrubs because of the material. I'll have to return .
3.0,"One of the ""buds"" fell out as soon as I opened the packaging. Quickly applied Gorilla glue and problem solved. Even so, the merchant doesn't get a pass for selling not so superior merchandise not well made. Even though the charm is cute and I will be using it on my handbag,  I'm taking off two stars for shoddy workmanship."
3.0,Sent back.  Quality was fine but item was just too large.
3.0,"These shorts are cute and comfortable, but the crotch area looks kinda weird, maybe I stretched them out when I squatted to pick something up. Flattering for new moms.  Unfortunately, I absolutely need to wear a belt with these because I get a huge gap on my back. I got a large but my waist is a small.<br /><br />Update, they stretched out easily."
3.0,"Ordered a 2X to for my large chest, 40DDD and it was extremely too large. Maybe I overshot it based in the reviews. I think I could fit a size late in this top. I'm a size 14, ordering a size 2x was a big mistake for me.<br /><br />It's a beautiful shirt though and the color is so vibrant! Would have made me look so professional around the office. I may try in a smaller size."
3.0,"At first, I was surprised at the quality of the boots for the price.  They were fairly comfortable- I'd suggest them for a day working outside or a hike, but not a long-term operation.  They were waterproof as advertised.  The downside, after a few months of wear the zipper on one boot failed.  I'm out of the return possibility so I'm going to try and repair it myself and, failing that, take it to a professional.  I knew the risk of buying a pair of boots for less than $200 but figured it was worth the risk.  If I can get the zipper fixed, I'll say it still is worth it but I won't go this route again."
3.0,"Looks really nice, size is adequate though the quality feels really cheap material. The design is well worth the money but no award winning class."
3.0,"Decent quality, the white rings around the sleeves have started to crack after 1st wash. Sleeves were melted together when it arrived. Poor quality control"
3.0,Super cute and sexy but its a little snug by the armpit area. After I wash it I let it air dry.<br />My bra size is 34D and I ordered a medium.
3.0,"The fabric “pills” as do so many fabrics.  I do like the style, but these tops do runn a little small."
3.0,"For the Camel, the coat I received was definitely not like the picture. It has shorter collars and the buttons are asymmetrical. The material itself is good, however, but it was not what I was expecting."
3.0,"Nice material, sized too small<br />No return information"
3.0,"Cheap material.  Stretches out of shape.  I don’t like it because it’s too big for me, but I missed my return window due to my recent illness."
3.0,It is very small and thin not what I expected it would be in the picture lovely if it was more bigger and thicker
3.0,I'll give 3 stars simply because it is not the authentic ring necklace. The inscription on the inside reads 9-J2-79 for the coordinates.
3.0,"Got the black boots and they are good, after 5 months of semi regular use (3-4 times a week, tying laces only 1 time in the morning, estimated 70 times shoes tied total) the laces were fraying.  It's actually a white string wrapped in a black sleeve so once it tears a little, the sleeve separates and leaves a bright white string on an all black boot.  Had to go buy replacement laces to use with the boots.  If you're buying new, buy a extra pair of trusted laces with as you'll most likely need them."
3.0,Too small.  Returned
3.0,The fabric and fit were fine but it’s not a true Carolina blue. We kept it anyway.
3.0,These run super small.
3.0,"if you want the sound of a good slap these work great.  it is up to you how you want a paddle to perform.  sexy cute playfull spanks this is for you.  anything more, this is not stiff enough to really play.  like a leather belt snapping on itself.  its loud and sounds intimidating but mostly harmless"
3.0,Colors are off.  Not nearly as vibrant as the picture
3.0,"This skirt looks basically just like it does in the picture, and the price denotes the quality. I absolutely love how this skirt looks, but don't so much love the quality and feel of it, which is why I've given it 3 stars. To be more specific:<br /><br />QUALITY and MAKE:<br />The fabric of this skirt is thin and stretchy. It doesn't really feel &#34;nice&#34; or &#34;soft&#34; as you would hope for a skirt, but what shiny, scaley fabric really would? I won't machine wash this for fear of stripping the scales, because it looks like the type of fabric that will quickly wear away the sparkle and scale bits.<br />The elastic in the waistband feels cheap and doesn't have much stretch. I would worry about the elastic giving out within a few wears.<br />The hem of this skirt is unfinished. It's not stitched but instead just cut across, like they stitched a piece of fabric to an elastic band and figured they were finished. On the plus side, I pulled at it a bit to see if it frays, and so far so good!<br /><br />FIT:<br />Follow the chart in the product pictures. They are true to size! I thought this skirt would be too tight, but it actually fits just right. :D<br /><br />LOOK:<br />This skirt is really cute and fun. I got the black version because I wanted it to be at least slightly subtle (the others were so loud! but I also would have loved to rock them all) and I'll say that, while a shimmery, scaled skirt will never be subtle, it looks exactly as I expected. It will be fun to wear on nights out in the city, for example.<br /><br />If this skirt were better made, it would have earned 5 stars from me. However, the quality (or lack thereof) really brings down my opinion. It's not falling apart, and really, it's what I was expecting from this, but it is a major factor.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I rely heavily on the reviews of others to make informed purchases, so will leave nothing but honest open reviews in return."
3.0,"This would be a 4 to 5 star, yet the bodice was messed up on it.  The material sewn in to cover the breast is off centered and crap. Otherwise, I really loved this dress. I am 5'3 , 135lbs, with a bust of 34C. On a sidenote, I would need to shorten the bodice by about 1 inch, tad bit too long. If you are a D cup or wider in the rib cage, wouldn't be an issue.  Also with heels the hem was great, hit about mid knee length. If I was going to wear flats I would shorten it by 1 to 2 inches. The color matched the picture... Hope the next order is better sewn."
3.0,Super cute!!! I ordered a small and it was way too big on me. ):
3.0,"They looked crumpled, so I gave them to my poor husband."
3.0,Bought a ladies size and I received a child size
3.0,"I really love the design, If the lining was silk I would have kept it, but it was a harsh material and not the best for my type of hair."
3.0,"I ordered a dress that pictured is lacey, short sleeves, and round neck. What I received looks like a trench coat, totally different martial, collared neck, buttons in the front. Not at all what was described. The return process is proving to be very simple though."
3.0,"I love the color and how slim and comfy the watch is. I wear it swimming quite a bit and have been wearing it all summer. Unfortunately, about two weeks after buying the watch, the wristband broke. I have been using tape to keep the watch together. I need to buy a new one but the watch works perfectly fine and is fully functional besides the wristband. The rating would have been much better if the watch wristband would not have broke!"
3.0,Loved them but I'm a petite and they were six inches too long.  A petite size would be great
3.0,Several broke on the 1st to 3rd use.... had to return them.
3.0,"Runs small!  Bought this for a gift for my dad.  He loved all the pockets, but sadly it was too snug.  And unfortunately it was not available in a larger size."
3.0,"Ordered 2 ties as part of larger order.  First one came and looked fine.  The second olive green came a day or two later with a large black grease smudge on it, making it unfit to wear."
3.0,"Cute dress, but returned because it was big."
3.0,"Looks very well on my hand. It may be a bit pricy for an unknown brand, time will tell. So far it is running perfectly. I was surprised that it's not a jewel movement. If I have any issues will update my revue.<br />Update: After using it for a while I noticed that its gaining time when I'm not wearing it, and there is no adj. I contacted the Company but got no response. So I would not recommend this watch. There are better watches for less."
3.0,"I love the keychain, but each photo contains two keyrings, but you're only buying one. False advertisement."
3.0,"My gf loved the shirt. The only problem is the pocket is sewn strangely. It was a little in the center. As well as the print of the pizza slice was even more in the middle, somewhat on the edge of the pocket. Making it look as if the pizza slice was almost directly in the middle of the chest. If the pocket was more where it would be expected and the pizza slice was printed in the pocket more centered I would have given 5 stars."
3.0,Product looks like picture but size chart is completely off. I am 5'4 I weigh 165 pounds ordered a Large and is way too small.
3.0,They are hard to get on. Once on they are very good.  I have back problems and now a knee problem.so I guess that is the reason.
3.0,"The fit is fine, but I don't like the cut. I like more of a scoop hem, thinner shoulder straps, lower arm openings to allow for lats,"
3.0,"These were not comfortable at first, but after wearing them a week or so, they molded to me feet. I wore them practically daily for three months before the side started shredding where my pinky toe sits. For the price though, I think they worked rather well for me. I've ordered a different Ryka pair, in leather this time to see if they'll last longer."
3.0,This skirt is okay.<br />Pros: The color is exactly as pictured and it is true to size.<br />Cons: Stitch work is sloppy and looks a little cheap.<br /><br />I will wear this skirt and since it was inexpensive it's not a total loss!
3.0,"The material was very flimsy.. im afraid it will tear, or break one day when I'm wearing it out."
3.0,"I like the ring overall, but the dislike is that the red Ruby fell out revealing a hollow hole under the Ruby. Lucky I got my good ole Crazy Glue."
3.0,"It’s a beautiful sweater, as I expected for the price"
3.0,"Its ok.... looked more delicate in the pics, its a bit larger than it looks"
3.0,Very pretty looks yellow though
3.0,"Love these pants, they run a little big which is good. But the only problem is the button. It doesn't stay fastened and you have to wear a belt."
3.0,Not enough substance for me. For that reason I would not buy again.
3.0,Runs small. Go one size up. Quality OK. Wouldn't. Glad I didn't spend more.
3.0,It fit right but the top felt like it was going to fall off. Might need to change the Brest cups to fit better
3.0,"Love the necklace but color was pink, NOT red as advertised. I had needed a RED necklace but will make this work."
3.0,"It worth the money. However, the material is not right for the skirt model. The material would would work for temp 40-65f. It is elastic and should be used for tight skirt models."
3.0,Saw that larger sizes were offered so I took a chance. It's a fine around the house bra but the cups run a bit small and the band large.
3.0,"I had higher hopes for this dress than what I received. I'm 5'5"", 130 lbs and the S is a little baggie on me. I should have gotten the XS. Also, the fringe in real life looks more disheveled than attractive."
3.0,"Fabric is kinda thin and pills after just 2 wears, otherwise comfortable and flattering."
3.0,The jacket is shapeless and missing a button from the hood connection portion.  I'm returning it.  Disappointed.
3.0,"One of the sets was broken, but the other 2 sets were okay and they looked adorable when they wore them for our “one in a melon” conference."
3.0,"I wanted to try some new compression socks so I thought I would try these. They are nice and thick, which I like and wanted. The problem is that they are not long enough. They don't stay up for me. I won't be ordering them again. I will try another brand."
3.0,Runs small and doesnt have any stretch in band
3.0,"It's ok, but had trouble to try to send back with seller."
3.0,I loved my steering wheel cover 100%. The only reason I only gave it 3 stars is because after 2 weeks my lanyard broke. The silver hook part just broke one day while it was in my pocket.
3.0,"The color and fabric are great. The spandex gives it a nice mobility. The stomach is in no way loose like in the picture unless you are thin. If you are looking for something that doesn’t cling to your muffin top this is not the shirt for you. The length is great, covers your rear end and you can lift your arms without exposing skin."
3.0,"Bra fit well, great compression, but it did not have any type of molded lining as described. A shame that no one makes decent high quality sports bras with sewn in lining for modesty."
3.0,"It was so soft I was tempted to keep it, but it doesn’t look like it does in the picture. The picture looks like a matte cloth, but it’s actually shiny, and the stripes are printed, not threaded."
3.0,"Bought this for my older child, mask came and when she put it on the piece above the ears tore on both sides. Like how elastic does after its aged some. It is more to fit like a 4 yr old than anything else. I gave it 3 stars bc the design is nice and it is made of neoprene, which is the easier to breathe material."
3.0,Great material! Cut a little shorter in the back than I prefer.
3.0,The smell is so strong of chemicals
3.0,Got these recently and instantly loved them. They are light weight and fit great but feel a bit cheaper than i thought they would. The polarization on the lenses isn't the best either. I recommend these as a pair to wear when you're working in the yard or on the lake as an option to higher end glasses.
3.0,"I ordered the shamrock ""sweatshirt"" not a sweatshirt at all- weird shiny material.<br />I dont like it, sending it back."
3.0,It fits but slightest short. Not sure I'll wear but I'm keeping it for now
3.0,Dont remember buying or recieving these
3.0,"Color is as indicated, however the fit and style is more for bed."
3.0,I like the style but the shoe was too small for my size
3.0,Nice material. Very soft and flowy but the dress runs really very large. Also had like a million wrinkles on it.
3.0,"I'm 5'8 and ordered an xl. It was too short 😣. It looks like high waters, which is sad because I love the dress."
3.0,"This is the most comfy shirt I wore, does run a little bigger. sadly my washer ruined the lettering even washing in warm water."
3.0,This is a very weird material and not stiff like the picture. It fits very awkwardly. I returned it. I am giving three stars because it arrived on time and the construction of the skirt was fine.
3.0,"It keeps my pants right where I want them. It's comfortable, and there's no buckle poking my tummy. I do a lot of crouching at my job, and I never get a ""plumber's crack."" The only thing is the fabric is fraying around the clasp, but it's still functional."
3.0,Quality skirt and definitely on the nicer end of tulle but I’m giving 3 stars because I ordered blush and it’s more peach.
3.0,"Within a month post purchase the gears within this watch started to loosen such that the arm indicating the time would randomly stay still. I had noticed that the watch was malfuctioning when I set it one morning, then looked at it later that day only to realize that I needed to set it again because it was stuck on 10:47 AM. I admit, the watches natural minimalist aesthetic is nice. But this watch is clearly poorly made. Fair warning for prospective purchasers."
3.0,Not true to size and the fabric is really stiff
3.0,Darling item but entirely too small. I had to wear a tank underneath. Gave it to my smaller daughter.
3.0,"Item runs small, especially with the sleeves. Cute green color and design, just not sized appropriate"
3.0,Sleeves not snug.. shirts short in length possibly would work  if my torso was short
3.0,It fit well and great color. Disappointed it has no real support. I will be returning it.
3.0,"This is the best bra I found so far, they still bounce, but working out at a high intensity is at least bearable now :) in a 38 D, I should have ordered a 36 dd, the cup fits, but the band on the tightest setting is a bit too loose."
3.0,"For the money they do the trick, but they were super lopsided and still are a little lopsided. Also, the lens don't really stop the sun and can get foggy at times. Regardless, for the price you really can't beat the cuteness."
3.0,The top was too small. If you have a bigger chest I would say go up a size. Other than that I loved the colors & it was very stretchy (top just not stretchy enough)
3.0,"This is the only polyester shirt I own that comes out of the dryer wrinkled.  Maybe it's the material???  Other than it's not a wash and wear, I have no complaints about the fit or quality."
3.0,Runs a little small but it will work for now.
3.0,Runs small.  The lace is attached differently than I expected
3.0,too big and too heavy to use as purse.  definitely a tote..a large one.
3.0,If you like a really thin and dainty band this is the one for you. It also ran a bit small. I’ve sent mine back for a refund. They do seem nicely constructed though.
3.0,The sleeves are like highwaters on jeans.. Sending back...
3.0,"I love my other PattyBoutik items, but this dress just wasn't what I had in mind.  The material was too thin for a winter dress. Plus I felt like the gray washed me out and the size Small was just too tight too look good (I am 5'2"" and 108 pounds for reference). I did like the swing of the skirt, but that wasn't enough for me to want to keep it. I'm ordering a different Patty dress in hopes it'll work better for this winter."
3.0,nice style order a size up
3.0,Great purse but way too big for me.  Need smaller purse
3.0,Does not fit as see in the picture. While i was aware that the bottom slit was in the middle it came up way too far and would have been very difficult to wear in public. returned.
3.0,Was a pretty dress but ran small 😭
3.0,"Too large for 5,2 100lbs girl.  Didn't like how long it was"
3.0,32-34 size large is too small
3.0,"Nice purse but a little smaller  than expected, i did like the color combination a lot"
3.0,u need to add links to make it longer but its ok.
3.0,"The swim shorts were fine, but the top did not fit appropriately. Pads were in a weird position. Size was appropriate, but weird swim top."
3.0,need to get use to nylon net
3.0,Heavier then expected
3.0,"It fits fine, but once I tried it on, didn't like how it looked on me"
3.0,Less than perfect. Does the job. Pinches my arm hair. Almost a good idea.
3.0,"These boots are not waterproof, I tried to walk in the rain and some water got into my boots, less water than a normal shoes but still got my socks wet. The fur doesn't really help keep my feet warm in the cold either."
3.0,It has a weard Chinese type sign on the Hat. I'm sure it's fine if you're Chinese. but we are not and don't know what it means.
3.0,It’s a very thin fabric and it works great also good price for its quality.  Bought it for my 4 year old  fits a bit loose.
3.0,when i took it out the package the wig had static i bought hair spray sprayed it down. i just wish it had clip ins or some adhisive to stick to my daughter's hair. other then that it looks exactly like the picture
3.0,Sleeves were too long.  Clothing designers need to figure out a way to make sleeve length adjustable.  Rolling up sports apparel doesn't look right.  And of course when you want an item of clothing to shrink it never does.  I'm 5'5.5.  I need a 22 inch sleeve.  The rest of the top is very nice.
3.0,"The only problem with this dress is that if you raise your arms, the sleeves pop right up to your shoulders and you then have to re situate the dress"
3.0,Didn't like the material - very thin and somewhat itchy against my skin. Ended up returning this because it was too small. Usually wear an 8/10 - bought the 8/10 and couldn't zip it up all the way.
3.0,"It is an adorable dress, and I really wish it had fit. However, I had to return it because it was several sizes too small for me.  I measured myself according to the size chart provided in the pictures for the item. I matched my sizes to the size it said I needed, but I could not zip it up more than a couple inches. I'm hoping I can reorder a larger size, but I'm unsure what size I should get now."
3.0,This top was GIGANTIC for something sized as a small. I was able to sew it to fit me but it was huge.
3.0,This could have been a perfect dress except that it was at least 4&#34; too long for me (I'm 5'4) it literally dropped onto the ground and the pockets are down the middle of my thigh.
3.0,"Wig is MUCH longer than expected, and doesn't look the same as the picture. It's actually quite thin, especially the bangs. When I took it out of the bag is was extremely tangled, and I had to cut a solid 6 inches off the bottom to reach any sort of smoothness. I use this wig for Homura's hair in braids because of the tangles."
3.0,Jacket fit good. Hat was very wrinkled and couldn't fix it. Gloves were long from the fingers but fixed them by cutting them.
3.0,The gold is much more yellow than pictured.
3.0,"They say they are longer in length I am only 5'6'' and 135 lbs not obese and do not have huge boobs, and they are still short on me. I even went one size larger to get extra length. I hate when my back shows when I bend over..... I"
3.0,The waist band is very tight. I like the stretch in the legs  and how they fit but the waist band seems to be way tighter then it needs to be. I like how they stay up and in place when doing yoga. Love the pants just wish the waist wasn't so tight and restricting. For reference I am 139lbs and hold my weight in my hips got a size large.
3.0,"So this is a love/ hate post. These water shoes are awesome and my kid loves the design. They seem like they'd get the job done well, if only they fit correctly. My toddler is a size 9-9.5 depending on the brand of shoe, so I purchased the 9/10 size shoes and they're easily two sizes to big for my kid. Pretty upset about this for I needed them for tomorrow's trip out on the boat, but now I'll have to make a trip to the store in hopes they have something I can convince my kid to wear."
3.0,Cute but was way too tight in the shoulders and arms - I could barely get it on/off. I usually wear a size XL or a 16 and it fit everywhere but the arms. Thought it would have been cute with jeans or leggings but unfortunately had to return.
3.0,Second attempt with this product .<br />Unable to get them to stay stuck .<br />Loose one and done .
3.0,"I like an assortment in size and colors. They are not what I expected, not sure I would have bought them had I seen them in person. They do have an assortment, etc but just not my style, therefore my rating."
3.0,Beautiful fur fabric and heavy coat. The pockets were driving me crazy... too far back and one had started a hold in the stitching. Poor thin pockets-could have been made better. Not satisfied... will keep looking. Going back.
3.0,"I'm assuming it was in travel, but the lenses weren't unscared and part of the side was peeling off.<br />Still blocks the sun, so there's that."
3.0,This shirt looks and feels like it was made with some sort of super cheap fabric.  Not at ALL what I thought I was purchasing based on the price.  It is so sheer you can clearly see right through it.  VERY disappointed!
3.0,"This was also an X-Large, but it fit tighter than expected."
3.0,The shirt fit great except for the shoulder straps.  They are sewn too close to the shoulders and keep falling down. This of coy makes the whole shirt fall.  I still liked the shirt so got creative and used hair elastics to keep them up.  Kind of a pain and changes the look unfortunately.
3.0,"Fabric does not breathe well, so might be a little warm.<br />Wrinkles easily"
3.0,The color is beautiful good quality love the material but it doesn’t look good on me I’m busty so I didn’t like it I ordered L I’m 5 3” 170 lbs fits perfect but I didn’t like the way it looks on me maybe for some one thinner
3.0,run large and have a seam through the inseam
3.0,"The XL was too small, but not so small that I couldn't wear it. Just tight around the arms. Great color."
3.0,"I was expecting a little better quaility, but you get what you pay for. I found this belt was able to do the job for what I needed it for."
3.0,cute but very see through.  will have to wear tights underneath.  ordered in black
3.0,"The dress was very pretty, loved it but zipper is plastic and broke when I was zipping for the first time."
3.0,The size is too small for large
3.0,"I bought these because I thought they would work on boots. The picture makes them look bent for a boot. This pair is not for boots. Just shoes. Returned them to get the female boot stretcher. Since I have a bunion growing below my big toe, I used their black “bump” for that. And they’re great!"
3.0,"Good fit. I understand these are compression socks, but they ran a little snug in the calf (and I did order a size larger)<br />Love the print!!!"
3.0,Well I ordered this hat because it was a mesh trucker hat and that’s not what I got. My husband said it fits fine just disappointed it’s not the hat that was pictured.
3.0,"Eh. I don't like it. Kind of worn looking. The lace was cheap.<br />I'm small, was bigger for me.<br />It was clean, as shown, delivered and returned.<br />  Maybe suitable for a med up, no not small.<br /> Vendor easy to work with. np"
3.0,The material is wonderful but l feel the size ing is off they are very tight and l ordered my correct. Size
3.0,"It was super expensive, and the quality of the watch was not very high!<br /><br />I cannot suggest it to others"
3.0,Parece ser duradero pero muy pequeño si estás buscando un reloj grande no te recomiendo esté thanks😉👍
3.0,The color is the same as the picture.  The material is comfortable.  The part that I am disappointed in is the waist band/draw string.  Whatever is I the waistband lining after the first wash seemed to have folded in half like cardboard and will not straighten out again.  I’m not sure if it is something I can iron flat again.
3.0,"Received these in the mail, they were packaged well, and seem like they are good quality. I have only worn them a total of 12-ish times and they are holding up quite well, they look really good layered around my leather watch.<br /><br />A complaint that I do have though, is that the glue near the ends of the bands is quite scratchy, I put my glue gun to it to lay down the sharp ends with the glue to keep them from fraying, it has worked well so far.<br /><br />I would recommend them if you know how to properly layer, because as a stand alone they look... um... anemic? Yeah that is a good word for it."
3.0,Look decent and comfortable.  However not form-fitting enough -  they slip off feet too easily. Need to have some contours on sole to grip the foot better.
3.0,The fit is good but somehow the mask looks goofy when I wear it. My fault. It was sold as a funny mask. Having a mustache 50+ years I hate hiding mine and am looking for a classy mustache-mask. I will wear this for now.
3.0,"My 10 year old asked for this hoodie. The image is pink, not white. It's not true to size. It is on the small side. I would size up 2 sizes.  Took a long time to arrive, but we knew that when we ordered it."
3.0,"I was pretty disappointed in the bracelet's band.  It was very flimsy, and I think it will fall apart quickly."
3.0,"Maybe it's just my body type or I lost weight, but they certainly didn't fit like the picture - in fact, they fit like MOM jeans on me!! I ordered a size a bit larger just in case, but my butt and legs were swimming in them. I will order a size smaller. The denim is comfortably stretchy, so it will flatter your curves ."
3.0,"The quality of the sunglass is good.  However, the picture looks like a big sunglass but it is not as big as the picture.  Seller should put the size of the the item so there will be no mis-understading.  Anyway I can still use it and the price is good."
3.0,"This necklace/earring set is dramatic!  The color I received was not purply-pink like this one--but more deep royal blue-green with opalescent touches--which was fine for me but if you're trying to match it to a particular outfit that might be a problem.  If you look closely at the necklace, it sort of looks like crumpled tinfoil under colored plastic, but this really can't be seen unless you are holding it in your hand and really staring at it.  I wore my necklace for a New Year's Even party with a plain black dress and recieved many compliments on my &#34;outfit&#34; although dress itself is quite boring and basic, this necklace seemed to turn it into a showstopper! One problem I had though was my semi-sensitive skin became irritated when I wore it once with perfume--I believe the combination resulted in sort of a chemical reaction.  It went away once I removed the necklace, so I'm pretty sure the necklace was the cause.  I left the perfume off my chest the next time and had no problems.  If you like dramatic, statement pieces, this ones worth the small investment!"
3.0,"Watch is very nice and my 2nd one..1st was a leather band and was great. The wire mesh band however is hard to tighten, no flexible slack and can be tricky."
3.0,"Very clingy,  not as much t-shirt as expected"
3.0,Apretan un poco
3.0,"I ordered up according to other reviews, and the large does fit more like a medium. However, it is short on my torso.  I don't want to wear a belly shirt.  I am 5'4"" and 142 pounds, so I am not particularly tall.  I am giving this one away."
3.0,Material started to pile after just a few months of normal wear with gentle detergent
3.0,"I love the design. Very soft. Fits as expected. The white banding ripped at the seam and started fraying, though, during the very first wear. I tried to mend it on my sewing machine, but the fabric just keeps fraying. It's almost as if they used decorator fabric rather than clothing fabric for the banding. The body of the pj's holds up well enough, though. Odd that only the trim is so fragile. Unfortunately,  until they use different fabric for the banding, I can't recommend buying these pj's. Sorry."
3.0,Larger than expected. Does not dry fast or draw moisture away. Synthetic.
3.0,"A little snug for the size listed. The elastic keeps rolling within the band area, kind of annoying. The skirt itself is very cute!"
3.0,Thin material. Returned because it was to sheer.
3.0,"I initially purchased this item to make earnings, and I was surprised that all the pieces were picked randomly, and I was able to find only 1 pair."
3.0,"They color looks grey in the pictures, but its actually lavender. It's not made great either. You pay for what you get."
3.0,They're abit flimsy but I lovr the style
3.0,"I got the leafy print and it's really pretty.<br /><br />It is a wrap skirt, with a loop hole for the long wrap strap to pull through before it ties off around the front.<br /><br />I'm a little worried about the air flowing it up the front - it would be nice if there was a hidden button mid-thigh to connect the wrapped pieces."
3.0,The color was not as pretty as I expected. But I do like the magnetic band.
3.0,I bought these for my daughterinlaw as they were on her wish list.  I was disappointed how they look.
3.0,"Wanted a baggy fit, not fit to the body."
3.0,"They look great. Biggest problem is that they are very loose on your head. I try to wear them for sport, but get a little sweat and they fall easily."
3.0,Not to impressed with it.
3.0,"Its fits as expected. I really like the look and works great in hot weather. However, there's an unusual amount of fuzz that comes off the socks after wearing it. Its almost a disgusting amount."
3.0,The sizing with these pajama jeans can be inconsistent. But comfortable and wash well.
3.0,"Sowed up in an unmarked plastic bag no logo on them like in the picture, not sure if they are knockoffs. Did not feel a difference from crew socks."
3.0,This blazer is a hybrid of a blazer / cardigan. Works great over any blouse but won't be super dressy
3.0,Purchased 6 pack of mask for a party. Only five mask were received. Other than that the 5 mask I did get were good.
3.0,This band is great looking but the pins wont stay in my watch. I keeps falling apart.
3.0,The top is very VERY sheer. I got black and you could still see everything. Shorts was cute but thin material
3.0,The fit is very tight. I wear a Lg and bought an XL and could have easily gotten a XXL. It is very tight if you are wearing it over a dress shirt and tie as I do. The quality is so-so. It will leave massive tons of lint on your shirt. I'd recommend washing it and air drying it a couple times before using it over a shirt if you planned to take the sweater off sometime during the day.
3.0,I had to return item. It was too large.
3.0,"They are great, and very soft and comfortable but they are see through. Don't recommend wearing underwear with these."
3.0,It is cute but VERY TINY charms. I wish they were a little bigger. Would not buy again.
3.0,"Cute, but much too small. Couldn't even get my top in!"
3.0,Very nice and a good value. It is stretchier than I expected it to be.
3.0,The material is really clingy.  I appreciate a bit of stretch but this dress looks and feels like spandex; including the shine.  I really like the design and the print.  This dress is more suitable for a teen / young adult.  Disappointed to have to return it.
3.0,"THE BUCKLE IS VERY NICE, THE LEATHER BELT MATERIAL IS GOOD BUT THERE NEEDED TO BE SOME EXPLANATION ON THE BEST WAY TO RELEASE THIS, NOT THAT EASY, ALSO ALTHOUGH IT SAYS IT IS TRIMABLE, UNLESS YOU HAVE LEATHER WORKING EXPERIENCE i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT AS IT WON'T LOOK RIGHT."
3.0,Its bigger than I thought it would be. It is not a slim wallet.
3.0,I would say you could wear a handful of times.  Worked well for the one time we wore it.  It did not come with a headband.
3.0,This pajama runs small and overpriced for quality. Found same one on Walmart for almost $10 cheaper. I bought a size 4 for my 4 year old granddaughter but ended up just giving to my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter due to size.  And it was more of a hassle  to return which is why I kept it.
3.0,Quality product but for over twenty dollars one would think it would do a little something. It does accent the war machine costume nicely although it is overpriced.
3.0,Shed till making me think that I have a woof friend. It is cute and cozy. I would give 5 stars if it doesn’t shed too much. Now I see fur everywhere I take a step.
3.0,"Cup size is too big so you'll want to go down a cup size and the red isn't as pictured, it's more of a tomato red"
3.0,Too tight and too long for my short 🦵
3.0,"I bought this to use as a Wednesday Addams costume and was planning to wear it to work on normal days as well.  While it was the absolute perfect Wednesday Addams dress and I got a lot of compliments, the material is very polyestery and it is not something I'd wear to work on a regular day because it has that shiny polyester halloween costume look.  It ran a little big, but maybe I'm thinner than I think & should've ordered a size down. Haha"
3.0,they run a little small.  If you're rocking the dad bod
3.0,"The colors are nice, it fits well and is cooler than others I have tried but they are very fragile.  After wearing them 3 times they were fraying and tore."
3.0,I couldn't wait to get this sweater. It took longer than expected to receive which would be fine except I am not sure I like it. The length is shorter than in the picture and the sleeves are more like 3/4 inch. I never wear 3/4 inch sleeve sweaters..I think I am going to try to return it. I gave it 3 stars because the material seems to be good quality but it is not long enough.
3.0,"Theses are nice masks, however, they are too big for my 8 year old....they fall right off. The masks themselves are really good quality and good for an adult."
3.0,"They're super cute, three stars because once there's a smudge on them its all over. These are absolutely impossible to clean, I've scrubbed as hard as I could, used glasses cleaner, different type of rags but there's forever a foggy look to them after being smudged. The lint from whatever you use to clean these also attaches to these glasses like a magnet."
3.0,Brought these thinking they were headphones ...... ended up giving theses to my mom for the winter and she likes them.
3.0,"I'll start with the positives:<br /><br />Super cute pattern & style<br />Material is thin but not see through with the printed pattern<br />Good length for shorter girls, I'm 5'3 and will be able to wear the XL with flats as long as I wear it ""high waisted""<br /><br />Negatives:<br />Way too small! I ordered the XL based on reviews, I'm normally a size 12. I can only wear this as a super, high-waisted style and even then it's a little tight."
3.0,"Some don't even fit my septum. Too tight or hard to pull off or put in, the set is cute, few allready turning green.. their cute n comfortable once u find a good fit- out of 20 - 4 didn't fit . Everyone's septum different ."
3.0,"These would be awesome if I had realized how small they were and gotten a larger pair. That's my fault, but the earring broke in my ear while I was fiddling with the clasp."
3.0,So while these are definitely neoprene and will hold my glasses to my face they surely don’t float. Glad I tested my expensive glasses in a pool before I went in the lake... kinda disappointed.
3.0,too long and not very flouncy like in picture
3.0,"Ordered the XXL based on size chart. too big overall, but way too big on top. Couldn't order the XL the day i ordered this XXL due to a system error, but may try to for another event, since i like the style. If i order again, ill update my review."
3.0,The pattern on this shirt is cute. It fits well except for the arms which are too loose which makes it look a little weird on me unfortunately
3.0,Beautiful but was too big for me.
3.0,"I returned it. First of all, it is too big for me. Second, the material is too soft to make a shape."
3.0,"The charm is beautiful, but I won't count on the chain holding up for long.  I have others that I plan on swapping out with this one so that I don't have to worry about it as much."
3.0,"It’s cute, but the material is not the most comfortable. It looks and feels cheap. There are higher quality girls’ nightgowns for a similar price available."
3.0,"I had to get the dress hemmed. I ordered a small and I'm 5'2"", 125 lbs. The dress seemed to be a bit on the cheap side as far as how it was made. The seam along the side wasn't consistent as it wasn't a straight hem. Not sure how to describe it, but the way the side hem was stitched, it made it hard to determine if the slit in the dress was supposed to be on the back or side. It kept shifting. Other than that detail, the rest of the dress was great and it would make a great summer dress. Just wish the craftsmanship was a bit better."
3.0,"I have had this for about 3 months now and its started to peel, I love Armani and usually their products are great. Iam guessing this one was a bad egg in the bunch. on the other hand in the first couple of weeks that I wore it, it looked incredibly great."
3.0,"Quality appears to be great, but the sizing is large. We are returning the product, because it's a small mens size, but my son's head is too large for the youth sizes."
3.0,"I love big comfy loose sweaters, it's totally been my thing this year, and I thought this top looked so cute when I saw it. Unfortunately I will not get to wear it though, as it is too small for me. At 5'3&#34; 130lbs I checked the size chart and the length, bust, and sleeve measurements were appropriate, so I was sure it would fit, it's big and baggy anyway. Where the bottom of the sweater falls on the hips of the model looks cute, loose and comfortable. But it will just not work for women with big hips, unfortunately. I am petite, but I have big hips, so it is very tight at the bottom, making the middle kind of just bulge over the tight part. Not a cute look, and not comfortable for me to wear. I wish there was hip measurements or a width measurement listed. My hips are about 38&#34;, and when I measured the top for this review it was 19&#34; across, so about 38&#34; around. So if your hips/top of your buttock areas is smaller than 38&#34;, it should be fine for you. I gave this top to my boyfriend's mom who is smaller than me, and she liked it.<br /><br />I thought the sweater was a bit thinner than I expected, isn't a totally bad thing since I get warm easily, and it doesn't get too cold in Southern California anyway. The material is softish and comfortable to wear, but is not &#34;knitted&#34; and didn't exactly look like the photo for me, as it was a little shiny or something (see my pics), kinda weird. The sleeve cuff looks a little shorter to me too, but that isn't a big deal. There is no tag in the sweater, and it appears that you can wear it either way, both sides are the same front and back. I actually like that there is no tag, as someone with very sensitive skin related to fibromyalgia, tags can be a nuisance. The shipping time was pretty good, I ordered the top on 12/28/15, and it said it would not arrive until between 1/22/16 and 3/9/16, but I got it 1/9/16.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is a cute comfortable top, but the part falling on your hips is small, so it would be best suited for someone with hips well under 38&#34; for the same baggy look. I received this item at a discount for review purposes, but this in no way changes my opinion of the product."
3.0,For a 4x it's small. I can wear it but its just not really what I expected .
3.0,Looks good. However the time is not easy to see and the lights don't work.
3.0,I love this dress but I'm short and it was very long. The only thing I would say that needs improvement is it's very heavy.
3.0,"All cotton, wish it was a better material."
3.0,"Cute but be forewarned...  It's a very thin case.  So if you're prone to dropping your phone a lot then this might not be the case for you.  Otherwise, it's great!"
3.0,"Although this didn’t work for me, the seller was responsive to my return request and remedied the situation. I wish this outfit would have worked, as it was cute on the model. It was a small, but was too long for my daughter. It also had some strings hanging off and the material was rougher than I thought it would be."
3.0,Didnt realize its just a toy. Not metal or anything shiny. More of a kids toy than a collector for a nerd.
3.0,"The top of the dress was sorth of big, and that's me saying this when I am large breasted, I keep noticing my top was going to the side alot and I had too keep fixing it, only wore it once and I don't think I will wear it again, I am not a heavy set girl I did get a medium I did like the rest of the dress but just felt that the top part was uneven"
3.0,"Odd selection, must be what was available to grab on top of every return, dark colors given most of the time especially black, darker colors and 2 lighter colors for a spring look. Not everything matched on the website"
3.0,"Pendant is as pictured, but the chain was broken when I received it."
3.0,Cute but  hurt my shoulders. A little to tight.
3.0,Realized it was more a child's jewery piece when I received it. Does not side on the chain very well
3.0,See through and my daughter wears size 5 and the 6/7 swim shirt kept ridding up.
3.0,"It is a super cute dress, BUT I am 5'7"" and it is CRAZY short, Mid thigh ish.  And it has pocket, which I know people love, but I'm not a fan of pockets on dresses or skirts because it makes it lay weird.  If you are shorter, or plan to wear over leggings this dress is GREAT."
3.0,This is a nice dress but a little thin.
3.0,"pretty outfit it just did not do much for me, so I gave it to someone else"
3.0,"Arrived quickly.  Cute, but they do not match; one has a blob of black on the forehead, the other is just blue as shown in their photo."
3.0,"I'm 5'8 and the size M was really short... like, can't lift my arms short. Really cute dress but had to return :("
3.0,A little on the bigger side compared to Fruit of the Loom 2T underwear. My son is 27 lbs for reference and waist/legs seem baggy. They are cute and very soft but we’re potty training and they’re quite thin - concerned they may not hold up well if event of an accident. I fear 0% containment.
3.0,Very comfy but the fabric does not line up in front. I think the length is too long and I am 5'7 and I will hem since it look better at knee.
3.0,Got these for my 8yr old daughter. The shorts looked cute but the material is kinda shiny. The waist fit fine but the legs are HUGE! My daughter is slim but she's going to set them aside until she is a bit older (bigger).
3.0,"Quality is suspect. Very thin material. The fitment is very rigid in style. I wouldn't buy again, nor would i recommend. Also, I'm 6'2, bought the XXL and they still barely fit for both length and waist, to be honest. I'd understand if I was overweight, but I'm a fairly fit person."
3.0,This shirt is more like a light pink versus the Melon/Coral color that is advertised. It isn't as long in length either. The material is soft though.
3.0,They r a little small ant tight but they seem to fit OK!
3.0,They don't stay shut. They keep opening up and coming loose.
3.0,Little on the small side I thought they would come up more on my thigh and not very soft
3.0,"I bought these according to the size chart.  Loved how it fit, once I got it on, but had a heck of time getting it off.  I would suggest going up a size so you can get it off."
3.0,too tight and too long
3.0,"The Material is has a little stretch to it.  However, the size chart is off.  I wear a size 8 and a large fits me just right.  If I had ordered a medium it would have been to small.  Order one size up and you will be fine."
3.0,"Works for me.Just do not expect flannel as we knew it in the past.<br />A new kind of fabric:half flannel,half cotton.<br />Worth the low price."
3.0,I am 5’7 and 150 lbs. I bought a large and it was too small. Just hit my hips in length. And was very snug when I had a long sleeve shirt on underneath .. otherwise super cute and good material
3.0,"My daughter is 5 years old and usually wears a size 6, so I got her a size 6/7. It’s way too big on her and they don’t have another size in between that one, it jumps from a 2/3 to a 6/7 NO 4/5."
3.0,One of the watch faces didn't work.  Should have made sure it worked before bracelet made.
3.0,"fun but they are not very functional, the nose piece digs into your nose and light get in the sides a lot"
3.0,"My granddaughter liked the feel and color of the material and the look, however if you buy this, I would suggest you size up."
3.0,The front band is itchy and uncomfy
3.0,Fits way too small. Amazon suggested a XL even though I'm usually a 2x or XXL on the bottom and the description said it was fun large so I trusted in this... Normally I could not even get a XL buttoned and I could but it was so tight there's no way I could have sat down and the fit on my thighs and butt would have had the seams popping if I moved too much.<br /><br />Now if you are a small 2x go for it but my butt and thighs are large (27in thighs) and 50in hips) so if you are on the bigger side on the bottom then size up for sure.<br /><br />Gave three stars cause the quality was good but they told me to order this size and it was wrong.
3.0,It's pretty with a tank top under it but was only able to wear twice before the holes popped out and it is almost unwearable now.
3.0,I should have ordered a larger size💙😊💖
3.0,Way tight on my temples. Gave them to my 8 year old
3.0,These masks are lightweight and would be comfortable if they would only stay up better. They keep slipping down below the nose.
3.0,"It fits… but you have to mold it to your body. It fits tight to the skin, and not comfy like how it looks in the picture. It’s cute but I just wish it wasn’t so tight"
3.0,Expensive very costly
3.0,This was cute but sizing was off.. had to return
3.0,"I love the band, but you have to be careful putting it on. The little tine that hooks thur the hole falls out.Must put through stapes to secure.love the color"
3.0,size still small
3.0,Es muy angosto para dar el paso pero todo lo demás esta perfecto
3.0,"These pants are adorable but I am going to have to put in some SERIOUS time at the gym. The pants are VERY tight in the butt & thigh region and start flaring at the knee. The flare is pretty big and super awesome! They're SUPER adorable, but if you're curvy they may not work out too well. Not very stretchy. I have a big butt and thighs with a small waist. I'm hoping someday they'll fit, because they're adorable!"
3.0,Feels cheap and incorrectly bias cut.
3.0,Necks to tight and kind of bell shaped. Colors are cool but not well tailored .
3.0,Beautiful top very firm fitting. It was to small even though I ordered my size from the charge. Gave it to my teenage daughter
3.0,It was good for a while but while I was at a convention the nose pad thing on it fell off then later that day the frames broke when I took the sunglasses off
3.0,"Cute pants, but Waaayyyy too small. Not accurate sizing at all."
3.0,Order at least a size up. Very interesting color. Like a white sand. Not that comfortable even if they did fit.
3.0,needed them to be waterproof for my son he's uses a wheelchair and he needed them to be waterproof for the winter weather and they were not so disappointment
3.0,"Plan on wearing a slip with this dress because it's a bit see-through, which was a little bit disappointing. It does have a lining, but it's not enough. I think the pattern and colors on this dress is super cute, but the fit was just off for me. The elastic waistband just left the dress looking baggy.<br /><br />The material is comfortable and it might look cute on a less-curvy body type, but it just didn't work for me."
3.0,Material not as expected. Not very comfortable.
3.0,The memory wire is to big for 5mm end caps. The wire is way to hard to bend.
3.0,"The quality of the shirts themselves (not the printing) is great! I love the styling, they are a medium/heavy weight and very soft. They don't shrink much if at all that I noticed. It's the quality of the shirt<br /><br />The issue is with the vinyl that is on them. You MUST wash these inside out (which I did, though I don't think it says it on the tags). This is vinyl, not paint or screen print.<br /><br />The vinyl on the adult T-shirt started to peel off with the first wash - just a little bit on the fine parts. It started to peel a bit more on the third. It isn't cracking, but it's most definitely coming off of the shirt.<br /><br />They are super cute and I love them on my son and his daddy (they were a Father's Day Gift). I just wish there was a bit more durability."
3.0,Received with chain broken. Jump rings missing. Good thing I know how to repair jewelry.<br />r
3.0,"Bralette itself was really cute! Too small though, so I had to send it back. So unfortunate :["
3.0,"I bought these slippers at end of October for my grand daughter.  She visited yesterday and liked these slippers a lot so I made her take them home.  When I shopped online trying to get another pair for her next visit, I found the price has jumped!  Understand we have inflation now but it still does not justify the price hike."
3.0,"Just received them today, October 7th. I ordered them on September 14th. Got them for my 14 yr old son who is 5' 9&#34; and about 130 pounds. I ordered a medium, but received an XL. They are nice looking, thick, and well made. The length is perfect and he fits the waste fine. He doesnt like that the pant legs are not tight enough. They went from us expecting joggers to looking more like sweats. So we're gonna try shrinking them and hopefully that works."
3.0,"Compared to OTHER Jiraiya headbands this one is acceptable. It has the symbol and band color right, it's realistic, but it isn't SHAPED like Jiraiya's Unique headband.<br /><br />But, and this is a big BUT, when you compare it to all the other Jiraiya headbands on the market, including the ones that are properly shaped and sized, this one still comes out on top. Because the ones that're shaped right have the wrong symbol or are the wrong size with the correct symbol."
3.0,i bought this for a friends birthday and was kinda surprised that it was only one in the box. anyway i ordered the other one no problemo. the other thing is that it strips if you shower in it and stuff. other than that its pretty kool
3.0,The design is cute but the quality is not good. They won't last very long since the sole material is very flimsy.
3.0,Found the locking mechanism not secure on some of pieces
3.0,"I ordered a size small as I usually would, and it fit really big in the breast and waist area. it also wasn’t as tight around my body as i would like. unless you’re petite with very big breasts, i recommend sizing down. im a size 34C and the small was way too big"
3.0,Only be ear would stay on :-(
3.0,"I so love the look of this top. I can't really bring myself to call it a &#34;cardigan&#34;, because it is just t-shirt material. I ordered an XL, after looking at reviews. I normally can wear a Large or XL. I couldn't button it or hold my shoulders straight! that's how tight it is. Also it's made of a t-shirt material, that doesn't stretch. I'm just going to donate to a local charity, because it clearly doesn't fit."
3.0,like it when i first got it . after putting it on the bracelet  and wearing it for a few month the dolphin  just fell off<br /> was very dis satified
3.0,Real comfy but not too much support.
3.0,The quality of the dress is very nice. It isn’t see through or anything. It fits very big though. I ordered a Large at first because that’s what I needed according to the sizing I tried it on and it was wayyyyy too big. Sent it back and got a medium and it was still too big for my liking but I kept it because I didn’t have enough time to send it back and get a new one. I’m 5’6 and 150lbs. I wear a DD bra and a size 7ish in jeans!
3.0,Runs small in the armpits and it’s too short in the waist
3.0,Love the jeans but had to return twice due to sizing way too small.
3.0,Super flare and fun
3.0,"This tank is super cute, but WAY too small in the bust. Order up a size or two if you are large chested. I'm a 38D and ordered the XL. I should have gotten an XXL. *sigh*"
3.0,Not great coverage for those of us who are well endowed. Ok for light exercise but I would not recommend for many activities if you have a larger bra size.
3.0,Good for the price.  The only issue was the rubber sole came apart within about 10 wears. I guess we got our money's worth out of them.
3.0,These look great and are easy for kids to get on.  My daughter reported that they are pretty warm but I would recommend them as more of an early winter/early spring rain boot rather than a play in the snow boot; they are just a little too short so snow can get in the holes in the sides and the laces are always coming undone and in the way.
3.0,"Small in the bust, so if you are full busted not the best option. I went a size up and still had trouble!"
3.0,Typical Under Armour material but way too long. Have another shirt the exact same size that is 6 inches shorter. The inconsistency in sizing is maddening.
3.0,"This thing actually works, but it itches like crazy .Think u have to wash everyday to minimize the itching"
3.0,Wrap around too small
3.0,"two main problems, head does not rotate so it will naturally aim up, even if you adjust it it will turn back up after a while. also it sits flush with your head which makes it angled inwards so your forehead will cover a part of the video. i had to attach a 20^ wedge to resolve this issue. other than that it holds good. all an all i would say this is worth it for 5 bucks other wise you are paying too much. I ended up getting a gaggles attachment and connect it a head strap that i had. worked better that way."
3.0,"REALLY NICE COLOR AND DESIGN  (BURGUNDY RED) WITH REFLECTIVE EDGES AND SEEMS STRONG.<br />THE ONLY PROBLEM IS I'M FINDING IT A BIT TOO HEAVY TO EVEN WALK THE DOG IN THE RAIN FOR MORE THAN A HALF HOUR. I'M NOT EXACTLY A FEEBLE PERSON, BUT I'D SUGGEST KEEPING IT IN THE CAR TO GO IN AND OUT OF PLACES.<br />I'M KEEPING IT, BUT ENDED UP BUYING A MORE LIGHTWEIGHT UMBRELLA FOR GENERAL USE AND PUTTING IN MY PURSE."
3.0,It wasn't too bad of an outfit but the top fit VERY weird. The length of the straps on the top were very long.
3.0,"Ordered a large, pants fit great (I usually wear a medium in pants) but top is very small, fit like a small/medium n was too tight to be comfortable."
3.0,"Basically fine for the price, but the 'keeper' on the clasp has a tendency to pop open. On the other hand, the actual clasp on the band is pretty hard to get open, so there isn't much danger..."
3.0,"I returned this because it was a very thin material. The shoulders didn’t stick up very well. The pink color was pretty accurate and the size was accurate. It wasn’t terrible, just didn’t think it was worth it for the thin material."
3.0,Not fond of the material and elbow patches are off.
3.0,Had something in the front of the watch like a sticker residue and I couldn't get it off
3.0,fits a little tighter than expected and the material is not what i expected.
3.0,Nice shirt but Asian sizes
3.0,I’m an extra small and ordered a medium….Way to tight. I may just return them
3.0,Really gorgeous bathing suit but no lining in the back or shorts.  Pretty see through when dry and I imagine it would be almost transparent when wet.  Too bad because it was very flattering.  I ordered several sizes based on the reviews and the best fit was XXXL...the equivalent of US 10...my normal size.
3.0,"I took a chance on this one, and I'm not very impressed with it.  I ordered a size larger than needed because I wanted something cozy to wrap up in, but it's barely big enough to say it fits.  It's also thinner than I expected, more  a lightweight windbreaker.  It is soft and cozy, and I like the material and color.  It's just not quite what I wanted.  Worth the price, but definitely not what is advertised."
3.0,Too tight around upper arm and snags very easily.
3.0,Product is very comfortable. Only issue is that it's slightly too big so it keeps sliding down to the back. But not that much of a problem to pull back up.
3.0,"I'm 5'6, 189 lbs and ordered a large. It was too tight. The top string around the neck was hard to tie and looked a little awkward."
3.0,It does not have enough storage.  No change compartment.
3.0,it is small I got the bigets one I'm not a large person but its not a great fit
3.0,"I got this ring just cause I liked it, and is till do, but I can't wear it a full day without my fingers turning green. :( it was cheap so I wasn't expecting much, it would have been nice to wear it and not turn..."
3.0,"Fits great. Very comfortable. However, they cannot bu used for any sort of activity. They provide no support, and the straps on the back are too elastic and springy to hold anything in place. They are comfortable for around the house use though, so I'm keeping them for that."
3.0,Item shipped well. Item is very small for the price.
3.0,Nike emblem started falling off after 1 use!
3.0,Really pretty but was short - more like a choker with a tail than a long lariat.  I wish it was longer though - its really very nice.
3.0,"Like the hat style but was rather disappointed when I tried to take one of the stickers off (very carefully) and some of the stitching got pulled out. A week later the stitching on the underside of the visor part has also pulled out somehow. I had to use very fine scissors to trim them. I have purchased many new era hats over the years some of which I used at work (construction jobs) for years on end and this low stitching quality is a first for me.. Cost wasn't cheap but the quality is. Well atleast some of the $ went to a good cause, supporting the armed forces so I'm happy about that atleast."
3.0,nice product  jist a little too tight . Take some getting use to.
3.0,A little snug and color was not what I expected
3.0,I'm 5'1 and only weigh about 90 lbs. Don't foul yourself in to thinking these will fit you if you are like me.They were so cute though for other people!! Def buy if you are actually the size!!
3.0,Its a good seller. Recomended
3.0,Wish it was a little long for tucking in
3.0,It's not super flattering but very comfortable to just throw on to go out to dinner.
3.0,"Not as comfortable as others i purchased,not a smooth texture, has a ridge,,slightly disappointing"
3.0,"They don't stay in, way too easy to lose."
3.0,"Just received the strap, with no picks or end covers as advertised… I was counting on those picks…"
3.0,I like that they are over sized but they look cheaply made. They don't look like the picture what so ever.
3.0,"Really like this dress.  Quality is about a 6-7, which is to be expected given price.  Love it after a hot day at the pool or beach"
3.0,"Looks much better on the model than in person. I’m 5’6 and the top was way too short for me! In addition, the fabric was extremely thin. I had to return it, as it was NOT worth it. A shame because I liked it on the model."
3.0,"To small, not true to size."
3.0,Extremely tight in the chest area even ordering larger than I normally wear
3.0,Love the material but it was cut at an odd shape and already had a hole in it when I opened it.
3.0,I like the keychain but have to return it due to the fact that it wasn't advertised with an Audio logo on it. I would have kept it if it was the actually item pictured.
3.0,It’s too long to be worn under the dress. But it’s very comfortable.
3.0,Too small but nice people
3.0,"The person I bought if for liked it but had to glue one of the feathers back on as soon as she opened it, cute but cheap quality."
3.0,"It looks good, but it’s very uncomfortable to wear around the neck, even for a just few minutes. The finish on the ribbon at the back (the burned ends) is very stiff and keep poking the skin. I can’t return anymore, so will have to find a way to cover this part with some soft type of material."
3.0,"Nice. Bracelet.good,thank you"
3.0,Looked neon in the picture but came in pink.
3.0,Your only able to see out the right side of mask and you will have to adjust continuallys to see.
3.0,"The dress is cute and fits as expected but if you have a bloated day, the dress will show it, just like if you wear a button down shirt, if it’s tight everyone can see. Also when you sit in it your stomach will be out regardless of if you’re bloated, there is a gap between buttons at the midsection that opens when you sit or bend over"
3.0,"In part, I thought the detail could have been better. It did not smell as other feedback mentioned. It is definitely for an adult, not a child. I found breathing to be a little difficult with the mask on, but that may just be my opinion."
3.0,"I originally purchased the 3X 5-pack. I wear a 44C, but had to return my original order because the bras were way too big. I reordered the bras in a size 2X and my order just arrived today. So after trying one on, I am not very impressed. The bras are very soft, comfortable and do not cut into the skin, but they are listed as high impact and offering maximum support. When I tried the bras on, the first thing I noticed is that the cups do not provide sufficient support for &#34;my girls&#34;. They don't jostle from side-to-side, but when I jumped up and down and started jogging in place, my breast moved up and down a significant amount. More than my other high impact sports bras allowed.<br /><br />I want to be fair, so I will be posting an update after I wear one to the gym and have a proper workout. On first blush, I think these sports bras are probably fine for low-to-medium impact workouts or weight training, but anything more intense? TBD."
3.0,This is weirdly big for the belly and if your bellybutton was recently pieced I wouldn't recommend eating l wearing due to the size. I didn't like the product at first but once I put it on its actually cute. This should be worn almost a year after its been pierced though. But it makes a big statement as a belly ring. So let it show!
3.0,"While it aligns the balls very well, it still influences the roll of the balls. Not super easy to use, needs a bit of patience."
3.0,"I’m really torn on this Open Leg Long Maxi Print Dress from Blink.  The pattern is really pretty, but on me it just looks sort of frumpy unless I’m moving.  The dress does flow nicely outside when a breeze hits it.  But otherwise, just hangs there.  This is definitely a dress that looks better in motion.<br /><br />Cons - The dress is super see through.  I will have to buy something to wear underneath it.  And the closures for the buttons gap open pretty bad, especially in the chest area, so I’ll need a lacy cami perhaps so I can leave the top unbuttoned.  A belt is needed with this dress as well because there is no button on the elastic waist part where it ties and it gaps open.  Also, there were a  few loose strings I had to cut off from the seams.<br /><br />Sizing  - I am 5’ 5” and weigh around 140lbs.  I ordered this in a medium and it fits, but is a bit snug in the upper arms and chest area.<br /><br />Thanks to the seller for selecting me to review this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"Could not use, returned"
3.0,I think everyone should buy a larger size
3.0,The material is silky and thicker than expected which I liked. It was too loose for my chest and a little too snug than what I like for my hips. The length came to the middle of my knees. It may be too big if I order up a size. Hate it didn’t work for me.
3.0,Adorable but it came with a loose gem. Lucky it was in the package so I glued it back<br /><br />Nit sure how long this will last
3.0,Extremely cute outfit. Although careful when washing and drying.... bow tie came off
3.0,"The earrings are nice but colorif the aquamarine stone has to be light sky blue. The stone is without any color. It is gift for my granddaughter to maych the same necklace, but color isn’t matching at all"
3.0,Thee glasses slipped down  my nose so I returned them.
3.0,Not a matching size set....<br />Shirts both 16/18<br />Pants 12/14
3.0,"5'8, 36C, size Large fit well.  Very thin, and very short, but was purchased to wear on the beach over bikini, so works well for that and is super cute.  The fabric is about like a handkerchief, and it barely covers the bottom, but for over a swim suit it will work well."
3.0,"It is much more flimsy  than it appears on line. While the look is okay, it is far from the quality represented."
3.0,I bought a large because medium was not available but I'm glad I did. The large definitely fits like a medium. Overall I think it's nice but not ecstatic about it.
3.0,Padded my wife's butt very well for her spin class. Going to buy another pair very soon.
3.0,"Too big,but everything is find"
3.0,"Like something you can buy out of a gumball machine for a quarter.  Charms are the best part of this.  The chain part of the choker looks like it could break at any time.  Just received and haven't given to  as a gift yet, but upon initial inspection Im not impressed.  Maybe she will be."
3.0,"Halo fell apart immediately.<br />Other than that, it was good."
3.0,Love the pair but have to send back due to damaged.
3.0,Nice band just don’t like that it doesn’t quite transform to your wrist! It’s hard! But overall it’s ok I like the color!! Very nice looking when it’s on!
3.0,Not a bad belt for the money
3.0,Nice design but not good quality.  very fast it is change color
3.0,"I hoped these were good Celine knock offs, but they are really large."
3.0,The picture shows a very loose leg. I found it to be narrower than expected. The hips are snug. I weigh 145 size 10-12 and if I had to do it again I would buy an XL. The fabric is on the cheap side. I haven’t washed it yet so I can’t comment on that.
3.0,"You pretty much get what you'd expect to get for the price. It's not amazing quality, it's built very cheaply. The clasp/chain broke while trying to put it on. Luckily, I can fix it and make it better. But you definitely get your money's worth."
3.0,"The material is thin so I have to wear nude colored boy shorts underneath, but I love the style. I’m 5’1” 127lbs so I wear them highwasted otherwise they are too long. I washed them in the washing machine on a normal setting and they didn’t fall apart so far so good 😊"
3.0,Very disappointed as it broke only after one wearing.  To flimsy.  Made poorly.
3.0,"every size is different, I have ordered 6 everyone loves it and itis adorable on if you are lucky enough to get one that fits!"
3.0,Not sure what I can do to make them stay on covering your nose.  They just fall down even with ear loops.<br />Definitely not suitable for children
3.0,graphic lifted from fabric after a couple of washes. Still looks ok
3.0,The color in the picture is more of a magenta shade and the hoodie is more of a hot pink.
3.0,"It's too small, which is disappointing because it is so pretty.  The sizing does run small because all my other blouses in this size fit fine."
3.0,"This company's short sleeve shirts fit the way I like, a bit slim and better material. I'm disappointed with this long sleeve version in comparison. It's loose fitting, a bit baggy, and not slim cut."
3.0,"Fast delivery. The romper did not fit as I had hoped it would.  It was too big on me and appeared baggy.<br />I ordered an XL. I'm 5'3"" and 230 lbs pear shaped, 40DD. I am returning for a smaller size.<br />Note:  The romper did have a few strings frayed (see pictures), but no other issues. The color was Blue as expected."
3.0,Cute but strap isn't long enough to be a purse as i was hoping and can't find this sequin color design in the larger bags even though there are like 10 different sellers on amazon
3.0,"Very thin, but nice"
3.0,"Siding is a little small. If you're have size is borderline, go with the bigger size.<br /><br />The gloves leave a strong lingering leather smell on your hands long after washing."
3.0,The top of this tunic is really nice and fits good but the body of it is a lot of material.  Might talk myself into wearing it with leggings or such as it is quite lengthy too and I'm a tall person.
3.0,"I was so excited to get this dress for work but it is painted on at the hips! No seamless underwear could hide under a skirt that tight! My measurements are 34B chest, 28&#34; waist and 37&#34; hip and purchased a small, and I couldn't keep the skirt from riding up. The chest was very low cut and had a lot of extra room but I could have worn a cami and pushup bra to fill it out. The seam attaching the top and skirt seemed slightly asymmetrical; the top made little bunches along the skirt. Also, one of the buttons had a loose ring inside that would jingle when I moved. I thought the ridge on the back of the button had come off but that was still attached. Otherwise the fabric of the top and skirt was decent in quality for the price. I would put it on par with Forever 21's clothing quality. Overall this skirt would fit amazing on someone with a full chest and tiny hips looking to make them look more shapely, but if you already have curves it will be tight!!! Sadly I had to return it."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but runs small."
3.0,Beautiful but run small. Order a size up
3.0,A little more casual than we thought (a but rumpled looking).
3.0,Wish I knew it was just paper... Could have made it but it's still cute and fun for what it was for
3.0,"Personally they scream “cheap and tacky” very loudly.  I should have returned them when I could have, but hoped they would grow on me.  Sadly they haven’t (grown on me)."
3.0,they tarnished and scratched quickly. the hoop part is a little small for my ears so they are tight.
3.0,"Came quickly, only complaint is some of the headbands came a plain, solid color instead of a pretty pattern"
3.0,it’s cute....but not short enough for me
3.0,don't care for the material
3.0,"Its very pretty.  Only one issue... the bell doesn't actually make noise.  Some people might really like this, I am still on the fence about returning it.  I can get a real bell and put it on there but I am not sure its worth the price if I have to modify it.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because it is a nice silver piece.  However the whole thing isn't silver.  The bell seems plastic and the internal piece that SHOULD make a bell sound, does not.  That is definitely plastic.<br /><br />Had originally purchased to wear for my dog that is going blind.  We are trying to train her before its totally gone, so for my purposes, I need it to ring."
3.0,Super cute up top but the bottoms fit a little weird. I wore it with shorts and loved it!
3.0,"These are pretty decent, but one or two of the connections will pop of if you were them kind of tight and wear them on a daily basis. These would be good for occasional/special event purposes though."
3.0,"Nice fabric, great color, very small medium.  Need to send back.  Found out I have to return ship to CHINA!!!!!  and thet are going to make me pay for it!<br />If your selling from another country AND it affects the finances of a return --- you should be up front about that from the beginning.  I will not buy from  SWOMOG again."
3.0,A little flimsy. Mine got caught on something and immediately bent and fell off
3.0,The white stripes are see thru
3.0,These are pretty good for the price. They run small in the pouch so your kibbles and bits fall out sometimes.
3.0,The straps do not adjust enough and the back clasp could actually adjust in some more. I am a 40DD but pretty petite. I can do yoga but that's it.
3.0,"Product was pretty and felt very good but size 12-24?? what is that? They did not fit at all, so disappointed."
3.0,I sent this back because I felt it would break the first time I accidentally tugged on it:
3.0,"Always size up, this shirt doesn’t fit true to size"
3.0,Some good
3.0,The colors on this sweater are very vibrant. But I only got it today so I'm not sure how we will hold out when I wash it. But I was disappointed in the sickness of the sweater. For $30+ you would think it would have a Hanes type feelings but it doesn't it's pretty thin. I am a woman's large so I was going to get a men's medium but I'm so happy I didn't. I got the men's XL for looser fit but the arms are way too big. It's like a men's 2XL on the arms in The width though but lengthwise it fits fine considering I have short arms. So if you want a loosefitting sweater get a 2 sizes bigger but for a tightfitting Switter get one size bigger. And the neck is tight even on an XL
3.0,Cute bracelets but don’t get them wet . They’re super awesome to put around your Buddha.Great provider! If you have an always contact the company they are efficient!!
3.0,"Pants was too long, made my son look like an old man"
3.0,"I like the size of this wallet but it is oddly made. The cash pocket front is made smaller than the back so it does not open right and is difficult to get cash in and out. And I dont carry much cash but it's still hard. FYI the ID looking holders are dark mesh, I am sharing this bc I was hoping to put my kids pics in 2 of the 3 of them and that doesnt work. Holds lots of cards and a teeny bit of change. Pretty color. 3 stars because I don't think it is made right. But you get what you pay for."
3.0,I bought this for my nail tech and she loved it! Great price!
3.0,"The skirt is a little big, but I am constantly tugging and pulling to get it to sit appropriately. Reserved for only around the house where it’s ok to have my butt hang out, literally"
3.0,"I thought this looked cute online. I'm 130 lbs 5'2, 34 C and sometimes DD (weaning baby to formula off breastfeeding) and ordered a small but it was TOO SMALL. My belly showed in the middle where it wasn't supposed to. One thing I wasn't expecting was a seam straight through the bust area. My husband could see it on the model but I didn't look close enough. Made me feel like it looked funny with a big chest and a seam right over my nipple area. Cute and great great great quality! I'm actually returning the one that is too small and I just bought a different one entirely because I can't see myself in the ruffly stuff like this belly ruffle. THE SUPPORT WAS FABULOUS. Tight and no underwire, but kept breasts high, supported, and looking great! I do recommend if you don't mind the bust seem and the belly ruffle. If you are 5'2 or taller, don't order the small unless you have smaller bust. I wish I had been told that."
3.0,The dress is very pretty I got the red one as well in a large and it's wrinkle city.<br />Press the dress and don't sit down.
3.0,It's a little on the small side. I haven't worn it yet. I was kind of expecting the material to be lighter than it is. It's a dense fabric. living in florida I don't think ill be able to wear this out much during the summer
3.0,"Nice dress, but the belt was missing :("
3.0,Love the suit except for how the built in bra is set in the suit. It is way too high unless your breast is at your shoulder level. Since I do sew I was able to make alterations by putting in a new bra.  Love the higher neckline. Three stars rating is because of the bra position
3.0,I love the colors.  Love the length.  But unless you have toothpick arms....
3.0,Okay not as pictured!! Love the necklace tho!
3.0,"Very comfortable band, fits well. I am unable to use the pink band, one of the connectors is backward, so it’s completely useless."
3.0,Good quality.  Looks like picture but WAY TOO SMALL.  Order at least 2 sizes up.
3.0,"Not bad gloves, and I would have kept them, but for the fact, I ordered green, and they sent me red. In a bag that SAID green on it. Yeah, well, not quite there. And actually, the gloves I did eventually go with, [[ASIN:B06XSB386T Cycling Gloves Mountain Bike Gloves Half Finger Road Racing Riding Gloves with Light Anti-slip Shock-absorbing Biking Gloves for Men and Women]] , actually work better, I think. The Velcro closure on the gloves I got was on the back and felt more secure and comfortable than the Velcro closure on these gloves, which is on the side of the wrist, and so going over a curve instead of a flatter area. Not to mention, the two loops included on the other gloves for removal are far better than the ... not quite loops they give you for removal of these gloves. On the whole, I'd say I got lucky they messed up my order."
3.0,Very comfortable. But a lot bigger than I like.
3.0,looks nice but quality not so nice
3.0,Not a fan. They peel and shed too much
3.0,The work and image are blurry looking. But I love the pineapple. The material is super soft but it’s a shear shirt so I will have to wear a shirt under it.
3.0,"It is what I expected, and looks good.  If you need a chain like this, this is a good option."
3.0,"They are nice. Snug, with well-placed cushions. Mine are just sitting there. Probably won't use them. They are slippery, and feet slide around inside sneakers when wearing the socks"
3.0,"They're fine as shoelaces go. Would've given 5 stars but the colors are off. The red is very orange. Wasn't able to use it in the shoes purchased for, but found some others to put them in. Other than that, no problems."
3.0,"Excellent quality, but they are cut small. I ordered a large, which is what I normally wear, but I should have ordered the next size up."
3.0,Nice looking and light weight but lock broke on first use on the middle sized luggage.  cheaply put on so it broke right off.  Also handle or &#34;grab bar&#34;<br />on bottom of luggage would of been helpful.  Looks like there might have been a thought about adding it but nothing is there.
3.0,Very see through. Buy a slip if you dont have one.
3.0,"I have an average size head and this hat was too small.  Plus it could have been packaged better.  It arrived rather smashed and even after much reshaping, already looked worse for wear .  Usually hats like this are rolled up and placed inside a tube for shipping, but this was just sent as is in a plastic wrapper with some useless protective paper.  I gave it a three because the hat itself is of good quality."
3.0,"Nice shirt, but not a ""tee"". Soft and shiny silky material. Not what I expected, more of a ""shirt"" than ""tee"". Purple is more like pink."
3.0,"These are nice looking bags, and the bag is generally sturdy.  As I have now read other reviews I too had a problem with the straps breaking at the stitching line above the rivets.  This is a design flaw that could be corrected by placing the rivets above the stitching line. The stitching weakens the strap with the perforation.  I was way past the return date, but contacted the supplier and they promptly sent me three new bags.  I thought very good customer service.  I will use the original ones for storage, and try to figure a way to reinforce the new ones before I use them.  I have noticed they have posted them as not available so hopefully they will correct the flaw or use stronger strapping."
3.0,"Item is plastic, I thought it would be metal"
3.0,"Love the message on the shirt. Color is not true black, more of a off black. As previous reviews stated sizing is not accurate. I'm petite frame ordered a medium, fits like a small. There is no way this can be a medium shirt. Would love to give it 5 stars but I do believe shirt will fade, and sizing is off. I will be hanging to dry. Received plenty of compliments, due the message."
3.0,"Wanted this for my upper ear. Was really excited by the snake eye design. Unfortunately, I'm not very good at visualizing the size of things & when it arrived I realized that the snake eye is so very small that you can't see the design without a magnifying glass. Returned it for a refund without ever having opened the packaging. Can't fault the product description, but there should be an ""actual size"" photo included for folks like me."
3.0,"The piece is a bit flimsy and its very light (I guess that could be a pro if its what you're after.)<br />It just feels cheaply made and really it is not that impressive. I think the photos here do it too much justice. In all honesty, this is just not a good piece."
3.0,"After riding multiple 30 mile rides. The gloves are not that supportive where it counts. Breathable yes, durable yes, just not very comfortable."
3.0,"The anti-glare component of the glasses is fine, but the clip-on blocks full vision."
3.0,"the charm is bigger than I pictured, but really very pretty and meaningful, I collect moons."
3.0,Not as pictured but still very cute and lightweight.
3.0,Like great price and material and construction but felt elastic band around legs was a little loose.  Probably depends on body type
3.0,It’s cute but not so quality wise. It’s cheap making. The pendant stands out and the chain is kinda cheap. Maybe you can wear it 4 or 5 times but not beyond that.
3.0,"While the gown was made well, beautiful, it was not the correct size, even after we measured.  It is sleek-line and not really meant for curves.<br />The return of the gown was much easier than with other companies.  It was a real pleasure working with this Seller."
3.0,I found them too big for son who is 7 years old. They are suitable for teenagers and adults. I will not recommend them for smaller kids.
3.0,Very thin fabric.  Some already have holes...  after a few months
3.0,Somewhat large but the dress is as pictured.
3.0,They’re comfy just make sure you get the right size. But both of the pants I ordered the left back pocket ripped almost immediately.
3.0,not as advertised.  was way too small.  will not order again.  seller never contacted me to return the items
3.0,"First thing I noticed was they come in a nice carrying case with a mesh pocket inside to store extra batteries.  They were to tight to begin with but I was able to put a little bend in the center strap and that took care of it for me.  The ear cups are a little smaller then some I've used and I like that personally, they seem to fit better for me.  I have not had the chance to take them to the range yet but think they will be a nice addition to my gear bag. I would perfer them in black."
3.0,Nice shirt well designed not sure if it’s worth 100 bucks
3.0,Very loose. I was pretty sad when I put these on and my size 6.5 didn''t fit snugly in this shoe. Super cute though and I am trying to make it work with some crafting.
3.0,"Very nice material if size was correct. I purchased a L/XL I am 5'5 230lbs. All my other brand size XLs are too large lol.  I got them on, since they are a stretch material, they were see-through.  Hoping when I drop another size they will fit better. The length and shapr were great though."
3.0,I really wanted to love this long sweater cardigan but it just doesn't feel right on me.  It's almost like the sleeves are a little too short and I'm actually petite (5'4) so for whatever reason I just couldn't love it.  The material is nice and heavy but just not the right fit.
3.0,Warn hat.  Comfy and nice. The emblem on the front is too big and sharp!<br />Happy I bought it though
3.0,"Clasp bend easily, otherwise ok."
3.0,He is still wearing it because it is comfortable and hasn’t stretched or ripped but the color faded within a week.
3.0,Ordered a large which is what I always wear in leggings. To small. Should have ordered a size up.
3.0,Got this for a costume.  Definitely a little less pretty than the photos but that's to be expected.  Material is a decent weight though I had hoped the pleats would look as nice as the ones in the photos but find that they are too closely done and don't lay as nicely (even with ironing.)  It will work nicely once it's modified though!
3.0,Returned one because zipper broke.  Second one's zipper sticks at the corner so I can't close it all the way.
3.0,It’s difficult to use the molding
3.0,"It’s an “ok” band IMO. The band is stiff, which is why I gave it a lower rating."
3.0,"Runs small order larger size, maybe two."
3.0,"Super cute shoes BUT there are spots of discoloration on the top of the shoes, creases in the boot and the straps are creased and undone, these are every obviously worn, I waited 2 weeks for these and now I have to send them back 🤦🏽‍♀️"
3.0,"I took a chance and got the medium thinking it would be a little loose and was pleasantly surprised that you really couldn't see any gut in these:)<br />Now the only things that really bothers me is they wrinkle very easily. You have to be delicate with it or there will be wrinkles.<br />Secondly,  I this the front had just a little more fabric. It's a little too short. Other than that i really liked them. I will probably order more"
3.0,"I got them so I can practice on. when tried to put the glue the nail on it wouldn't stick. but its not terrible, im still happy I got it."
3.0,"These were a cute addition to the costume.  The ones we received were pink and blue instead of pink and purple, but they were fine anyway.  They are on the thin side, and don't have a lot of stretch at the top if that is important to you."
3.0,"Cute skirt. don't use the amazon size chart. use the one from the manufacturer with the pictures. Also, measure your length. It hit right at my knee and I have a 34"" inseam...seamed a bit long. I ordered a size smaller and may still need to hem it. Fabric is very soft and flexible."
3.0,I bought this back in July for a wedding in September. Washed and hung to dry where it stayed till event date and although i like the fit and style of the dress the zipper is terrible and hard to zip up. Just as I’m leaving for the event I noticed a rip in the seam. ☹️ Easy fix but I didn’t have time to change so a little disappointed.
3.0,Makes a noticeable sound when you walk.
3.0,"The dress is a little snug around the chest and waist, and just above my knees. I should have sized up but waited too late to return it. For reference I am 5'10, 225 lbs and 38DD chest. I ordered the XL."
3.0,Cute well made product but didn't fit me. I'm a 3x/4x 24/26 and 5'10 and I couldn't zip it.
3.0,Dress looks a little different then pic. Not liking the color or v neck area because it kinda flips. Runs kinda smaller around hips but because of shapes masks the lumps and bumps.
3.0,"We bought 2 of these.  They work fine as sunglasses, but the clip is not an easy one handed affair.  The clip is short and not easy to grasp.  We have to take our glasses off to attach or detach so it is very inconvenient.  We would not purchase these again."
3.0,"Love the fabric, beautifully finished, way too small."
3.0,"In truth , I was a little disappointed with this article which is the first time I have been disappointed with anything I have purchased from Amazon . I thought it would hold my music books but it was not quite big enough .  It is strongly made , however the press stud buttons did not fill me with confidence . Having said all that , It is more a case of you get what you pay for and this was not expensive . I don't blame Amazon for it . If purchasing it I would advise being more careful about evaluating the dimensions and then comparing them to those of the articles you wish to carry in the bag"
3.0,Worth the price<br />I wore it once n got wet n it started fading doh<br />But it’s wat u get for cheap things right😂
3.0,"It's a cute top, but it's pretty thin.  Not see-through, but too light for winter.  I sent it back since I need a top that will keep me warm."
3.0,The design of the shoe very beautiful the only thing is they’re made out of cheap stuff and they fall apart easily but other than that beautiful  design .!
3.0,Little tight in the chest area. Ordered a medium and I am a 34B.
3.0,"I agree with the review that said the V-neck is much higher than the one pictured.  And the dress has princess line seams in the bodice that are not visible in the picture, so its larger, looser fit does not line up correctly over the bust.  The skirt is not as full as pictured, and the white fabric is quite see-through, especially in the bodice.  I feel like I'd have to wear a cami under, which defeats the purpose of buying a cool dress for hot weather.  I'm 5'-4"", 128 pounds with a large bust, and the M-XXL was large in the bust.  If it had fit more like the picture, it would have been okay.  But those princess seams throw everything off."
3.0,"Bought this watch for my husband, but he thought it looked too feminine.  I now use it for myself instead but the sizing seems to be a very small margin for a man."
3.0,Necklace came broken and I had to add some missing jump rings.
3.0,"Got xl, Fitts like a medium"
3.0,"This is an original piece of pendant. I especially like the French inscription and the clasp which looks quite good. The around-the-edge pattern is simple but elegant. However, im a little disappointed at the paint, it is faded on one side of the locket, i can see the grey colour of the metal underneath the paint. In addition, the chain looks very tiny and not strong enough if stretched accidentally by force. Those are the 2 main defaults that cost it 2 rating stars. Nevertheless, one of my friends is  a huge fan of vintage stuff so she may not mind these tiny little shortcomings. Anyway, this is a nice piece in general and im going to keep it for myself. Thank you Amazon."
3.0,"I write a three because it seemed like the sizing was off (to large).  Otherwise, pretty cute for fitovers.  I sent mine back due to size issue."
3.0,I am 5'3'' and around 170lbs and ordered the large size. I was able to fit in but my boobs were pressed flat in the top and the bottom just cut very slightly into my hips. I would have kept it but the material felt so uncomfortable and felt like it really cuts into my skin. Had to return it. Also because the bottoms are not a high leg cut. It was this old granny style cut that doesn't fit my figure.
3.0,These legwarmers are not great. They are barely long enough and they don't stay up. One of mine came already ripped. Would not buy again.
3.0,"The clip doesn’t work, it’s purely decorative.  Otherwise, cute."
3.0,They slip off because they are heavy. I got the black for a funeral and my neck was rubbed raw by the jewels on it after a few hours.
3.0,"It's okay. After folding and rolling up the umbrella, the end tips are hard to make fit into the plastic disk that keeps them in place."
3.0,The color is a brighter yellow than pictured and the size runs large. I got a large and I normally wear a M/L. Its a loose flowy fit so I could have sized down.  Also this is NOT a sweater. Its a sheer chiffon kimono drape. It makes a nice shrug for coverage but is not warm nor is it a knit. I would order again in a smaller size and other colors.
3.0,The bracelet looks cheap..big stones and cheaply made.
3.0,I ordered 2xl pink.. but it doesn’t fit me.. it doesn’t fit me in the tummy place.. but the material is perfectly fine.. color is absolute beautiful.. will recommend if u have a flat tummy..Order 2 sizes more if u have a tummy!!
3.0,Way too tight in the waist.
3.0,I ordered the xtra large and still very small.  sure can't gain a couple pounds or wear them in public.
3.0,"this has zero structure to it, so things are constantly falling out when you set it down. otherwise, it's just ok."
3.0,"First off….the bottoms cover the model’s belly in the advertisement photo… the bottoms I received come just below my belly button, which makes it look like i have a roll just above the bathing suite bottoms. The bottoms either need to be higher or lower waisted to be flattering. The top is made of very strange material that I believe when it gets wet will become heavy causing the material to stretch and your boobs to fall out…"
3.0,"I love everything about this except the neck, it is the most feminine looking shirt ever due to the way the neck is cut. My wife even noticed before I said anything."
3.0,It was a really cute set but the hat kind of fell apart after I washed it.  The tassle on the top fell off.  The scarf was great and the gloves.  My daughter did love it.  I just wish the cap would have held together better.
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter who is in love with the Trolls movie and wanted a watch. I was disappointed when it showed up with dead batteries. I took the back off to see that the batteries were not designed to be replaced. I contacted the seller (Primetoys) and a few days later they shipped me another watch free of charge. New watch is working fine. A word of caution, this watch is not water resistant, so keep that in mind."
3.0,This pair fit very awkwardly. Someone was in a hurry to finish sewing. It feels as though the front and back pieces were reversed in the sewing process.
3.0,"No es de muy buena calidad la tela pero esta bie,  el gorro no es de buena calidad y se rompió al ponérselo mi hijo"
3.0,"I am a petite woman and I found this mask too small for my face. I have been wearing Old Navy brand masks for many months. These masks do not cover as well as those; I can blow out a candle through this mask as well. Since I bought the holiday pack, I suggest that they be worn for decoration only."
3.0,I love the material! Very soft. The short fits well. I do not like the graphic because it looks cheap.
3.0,"Definitely run big. Had to cut and reattach for my daughter to wear. Cute style though. I gave 3 stars because it is wearable, but only after some creative cutting and knotting."
3.0,The taste was rather bland.  We ended up tossing this in the garbage after taste testing!
3.0,"These are fairly loose. Three in a pack (all one size). One of the three won't stay over my nose at all. I assume just bad tolerances at factory. The ones that fit are thicker than most bandanas or gaiters. I use them for running and they are pretty easy to get off/on when encountering others. They also don't fog up my shades too badly. Since I paid for three in the package, I just wish all three were usable."
3.0,The sheer sleeves were itchy and the material seemed cheap.  Daughter did not like that part and the bodice was smaller than the size measurements.
3.0,It barely fit my 9yo daughter. Did it’s job
3.0,barbells with male end is easier to place for fresh piercings …best when you can slip tip of ring in back of needle.<br />kit gets the job done came with two needles.
3.0,"It's not nearly as long as it is on the model. My shirt is visible even with my arms down. It has a strong chemical smell and it's slightly scratchy. Also, the fabric has sparkly thread running through it, which you can't see in the photo. It's okay, but I'm not going to wear it as often I was hoping to; it's just not long enough to be warm enough."
3.0,It's okay not bad for a little chain to shine
3.0,"Love the colors but its too small.  I ordered a large and it was too tight.  I would prefer an extra large but they were all gone.  However, this is not like the fleece cuddl duds that stretch and give."
3.0,Love the style and color but small for the size I ordered. If I had been a bit bigger in the bust it would not have fit.
3.0,"I like the dress but the color is WAY off and so is the material. I thought that it was cotton but it’s such a weird feeling material. It’s very see through. Also, it looks more blue than gray. It’s not gray at all. The picture shows it being very gray...almost a heather gray but it isn’t at all. I’m disappointed in the dress. I ordered it for Easter thinking it would be so perfect but I’m just not sure about it. I will keep it but I’m sure when I wash it, it will be ruined. Not worth the money."
3.0,"The dress is otherwise great, but the one baggy arm ruined it for me. It hangs like a giant, awkward flap and I much preferred the more form-fitting arm (dress arms are asymmetrical). If you don't mind the batwing arm (shown in the right side of photo) then you may love this dress. Keep in mind that your arm will rarely be in the same position as the model's, and the flap/batwing hands will look much less attractive when the arm is held in a relaxed, downwards position.<br /><br />Also, the fabric is surprisingly thick and comfortable with a nice weight and drape to it. I did not detect much, if any sheerness, even when I best over or otherwise stretched the fabric.<br /><br />If they sold a similar dress with both arms in a formfitting cut then I'd totally buy this, since I love the modern/Euro style.<br /><br />I am 5'9&#34; and a size medium/large, and have broad shoulders which may have not worked well with the flap."
3.0,"Its the 3 one I've owned, they get small holes in like the thread comes loose."
3.0,Bought this while pregnant. The stretchy area being high helps but it is not flattering at all. Very baggy for the chest and made me look bigger than other dresses the way it fit. I have been buying non maternity to be able to keep after but this one did not make the cut. Returning. I don’t think it’s flattering for all figures.
3.0,I have numerous Olu Kai sandals. This style runs very small. It is short and tight. Will return.
3.0,"My ring size is very large for a woman<br /> I liked that this because it came in my size (13.5).  However, it is not as pink as it appears, and it seems to fade when I wash my hands.  As a nurse, that is up to 30 times a day."
3.0,La tela y el acabado no era lo que esperaba
3.0,Good quality but the legs were way too tight. I even went up a size to medium despite the size chart and I could barely bend my legs. I'm usually a 4 but maybe I should have ordered a large? just was hoping for a wider width in the thighs
3.0,I love this dress on my niece but the zipper is a no!!
3.0,"Definitely size up, 135 5’4 medium did NOT fit ):"
3.0,Fits small. Order the size up from what you normally would get. Very tight under the arms
3.0,"Sleeves are a bit long.  It’s very casual in design, the material is a bit cheap."
3.0,"Oh, how I wanted these to be my new go-to black shoe for work and other business casual events. They just aren't. Though they have good cushion and arch support, the tops hurt in all the places where the leather meets. I'm hoping they get more comfortable when they break in. If I can stand them that long, that is. Can't return them after they have been worn outdoors, so... I guess I'm stuck with them."
3.0,"I ordered a size small I’m 5’2 and about 140lbs, I wear a 34B so this fit covered my upper area well but it is open from the side (I wore pasties underneath) but as for my hips and butt this suit was basically a thong I’m usually a M/L for my bottom half so it felt like I had the biggest wedgie from the back and front overall, the fit looked AMAZING as for the size definitely go up."
3.0,"the blouse is ok is warm, but the pant is too big, and the fabric is different is not warm."
3.0,Too thin for the winter will not keep you head warm<br />It's more for bikers for there helmet
3.0,"I had a previous pair of eyeglow that I rather liked, these didn't stack up as well as those did. The screws constantly come loose and the construction is a little sloppy, even so It's hard to beat titanium in this price range, and they have put up with a fair amount of abuse."
3.0,"These are way smaller than I thought, which is why I didn’t give them 5 stars, but the material doesn’t bother my ears so that’s why I’m keeping them."
3.0,These are ok if you need something for a few months but the lense scratches easily
3.0,"Material is good, but the size T2-T3 is more T2 than T3. Fortunately my kid is thin."
3.0,"Runs small, made in Korea so size up. I can wear it with Sleeveless dresses but  wish I had sized up. I went by  Amazon's size chart and in  this case a medium would have fit perfectly over other light blouses. A large would have fit much better had I known the country of origin."
3.0,"Should have ordered a larger size. No enough color saturation. Other than that, a nice stud for everyday wear."
3.0,It was def cool just to small had to return it
3.0,I'm 5/7 and the winch part of this shirt is in an awkward spot. It's at my belly button. I feel like it's not long enough for people who have longer torsos. It definitely doesn't sit at waste as pictured above
3.0,Its okay. Not a snug fit like one would expect.
3.0,"They should make this in small petite...I’m normally a 6P and bought a small, still too big."
3.0,"This is not gold, it is yellow. Be sure you realize that before ordering."
3.0,"i have no problem with the quality of the pants, just the size chart.  I ordered a size 10 for my 9 year old, who is of average build and  short for his age.  The pants were too short and the waist too small.  I then got a size 14, which fit."
3.0,"Loose in the chest, tight in butt"
3.0,Very pretty necklace!<br />Pros:<br />Reasonably priced<br />Seems to be decent quality<br />Not cheap looking at all<br />Cons:<br />Incredibly difficult to clasp (I almost never have a problem with this)<br />Somewhat dainty/fragile<br />Clasp constantly ends up in the front by the charm due to the extension not being weighted enough.<br />Overall: Would purchase again. Going to add some weight to the extension myself to keep it from turning constantly (can be bought at a craft store)
3.0,"I was looking for a stretchy, soft Modal fabric pajama, similar to some I have had for several years and loved.  This one fits fine, but is a lot thinner fabric, so for winter it may not be very warm.  My old ones had a thicker, almost fuzzy feel.  These are more thin and slick feeling.  Seem perfect for summer time, but a bit cool for fall and winter."
3.0,Stitching horrible otherwise ok
3.0,Beautiful mask. Fits a little tight so I didn't wear it long.
3.0,"Beautiful hoops in a nice size! Once on, I have difficulty closing the ends. Smaller sized “sleepers” just click into place."
3.0,I bought this shirt to be worn as a tunic top. I'm about a size 4/6 depending on brands - 5'7&#34; about 138lbs. I ordered a XXL and it fits like a normal button up shirt. Its not long in the body and I have to roll the sleeves up because they are too short for my arms. Its also tight in the shoulders. I think I'm going to have to take it in towards the bottom because there's all this extra material that makes it sorta look like a maternity top. The material is heavier than I expected so that's nice. Id send it back if I didn't have to pay the price of the shirt to return it. If you're  a pear shape with absolutely no upper body strength then this is the shirt for you!
3.0,Doesn’t stay on ear.
3.0,"Eh. It's ok. It serves the purpose I needed it for, but it's a little 'cheaper' than I prefer. Bends and flexes and doesn't always thread properly. A pack of 10 would have been better so I could just throw them away as they wear out. But...it works I suppose..."
3.0,Ran a little too small for me
3.0,"I wear a size 7.5.  These were small.  And holes have already begun to develop.  I love them.  They are adorable.  If they were a bit bigger, the stress on the toes wouldn't be so much, and I believe they'd last longer.  Disappointed."
3.0,cool but broke quickly
3.0,I like the style of the tennis skirt but it is too long. I will have it hemmed.
3.0,"I am 5 foot tall and this dress is short, really a long tunic length... might use as tunic top or summer night gown ... very soft"
3.0,"Not the best, but adequate for the price"
3.0,They're cute but I didn't think they were that small
3.0,"I bought a couple other T-shirts at the same time, and this one was more stiff and not soft like the others."
3.0,Beautiful but too tight and painful after 1 hr. I returned them.
3.0,I could fit two of me in this shirt.  Way too big.
3.0,"The stones were much smaller than they look in the picture, but it's still a cute little addition to my collection."
3.0,I purchased this as a part of a costume for a photoshoot.  It's so small it probably won't even translate to pictures.  I definitely need to find a bigger chain for it. A little disappointed but not as little as the necklace itself.
3.0,"My boyfriend got me this as a sort of joke (everyone kept asking if we were married so he went all out and bought this) and I love it.<br />That was mid-March. I don't know when this happened but one of the stones fell out. That said, I work in a restaurant and use my hands a lot and I know that $14 don't have a huge life expectancy and aren't really meant to take a beating so it's kinda to be expected.<br />That said, it's still a pretty trying and I'm gonna buy a new one"
3.0,"my 13 year old loved this and had to have it, I thought it was silly but in person it is very cute however after only having it 3 days it broke at the bracelet part I was able to fix it using a spare little ring I had but after only 3 days it shouldn't have broke."
3.0,"Fits exactly as expected, but washed once and it's already started to peel up. It doesn't exactly bother me enough to prioritize doing something about it, but it is still annoying.<br /><br />The top of the lettering and his shoes are the worst areas, but it's flaking universally. I expect that by the end of the year it's gonna be completely gone"
3.0,WAY too small. I ordered the largest size there was because almost everything I buy on Amazon is too small. It was about an 8. I gave it to my daughter's friend.
3.0,A little loose against fitting the face without using straps to tighten fit. Previous mask that was damaged fit closer on face without fitting straps tight to back of head.
3.0,"Quality could have been better, especially for the plates and the table cloth."
3.0,it's pretty comfy but after i washed it began to ball up. I wear this more as a night/ around the house dress now.
3.0,The area underneath the arm pokes out. Straps and clasp is weird
3.0,Love tbe way it looks although it's a very basic backpack and kinda small
3.0,"They are quite a bit bigger than I expected. Because they are quite big they are also heavy, so I'm not sure how often I'll wear them. I wish they had been shown on someone's ears, I would NOT have ordered them."
3.0,"This skirt is really cute and a nice athletic flowy material. However, if you have hips or a butt like me, this may not fit you. The waistband has a seam around it with minimal stretch. :( Wanted to love it but this isn't for me sadly."
3.0,It's really a sweater cape with fake fur trim. Cute bit not impressive.  The fake fur shed!
3.0,Nice quality but the way it attaches to the lace on the Tilley hat doesn't really allow it to fan out as I expected.  It looks goofy enough that I don't really expect I'll use it much
3.0,"Very pretty, but unfortunately runs very large. Did not return because it was a gift, and the recipient wanted to try to alter it instead."
3.0,tight and the fabric is somewhat large.
3.0,"It's a beautiful blouse. It's cut narrow across the width above my chest to the arm pits.  I ordered an XL. I am normally a medium. But with past experience on cheap clothes from China I ordered the larger. It looks lovely, but it is see through.. So need a top underneath which now makes it too tight across the chest.. This is my last time buying these cheap articles from China. It's hit or miss...."
3.0,Easily snagged
3.0,"Se rompieron después de la segunda que use, son lindas, abrigan pero la calidad deja mucho q desear"
3.0,the box is fine. the brushes are good.The polish is ok. The daubers are cheap
3.0,"The size small must have been mistaken for another size, the small looks like a extra large, it is that BIG!!!!!! I'm so disappointed because I really like the style, and the material is ok too, its just not a true size, I also ordered a navy and not a mint green colour!"
3.0,Really long arms and runs small around the waist
3.0,"Kind of disappointed... Rose does not really look like the one in the picture. The construction is the same, but the lower part is yellow not white at all, red part is only on the very edge on the top and even that is more purplish than red (or burgundy, whatever). This is kind of big deal for roses, since yellow signifies friendship and I didn't get this rose to end up in the friend zone :). Finish on the stem was lower quality than I hoped for, lots of bubbles and imperfections. If you don't look at the details, it does look good and would be a great gift but for 70$ I hoped for better quality.<br /><br />P.S. Broken off leaf it arrived with does not help, it's already Valentines and I can't have it replaced or refunded. The broken bit, at least lets me vouch that there is indeed real rose under there with a real stem(not a plastic stem like I read in reviews of some other roses)."
3.0,These are pretty thin. But they work for what I needed.
3.0,"I ordered this clutch wallet solely on its description of 10 inches in length. That's what I was in need of. Not only does the height not quite measure up to the description, but the length is off by a bit over two inches. I can't use an 8 inch clutch wallet. Had I known, I wouldn't have wasted my time."
3.0,Only negative is they are all the same color and look alike. Not like the pictures. Mine were all blue and white. Fit is good quality is good
3.0,"My first shirt fits great. I ordered a size up, per others comments. I love their selection of colors and the shirts appear to be well made. My second shirt looked great but the sleeves were 2 inches shorter than my first one. Same size, completely different fit. Was un-wearable, unfortunately. It's a shame as I love their shirts, but am afraid to order another one as I don't know what I may receive."
3.0,XXL is smaller than a XL.  I hope this is a this is a mistake bc I am reordering a XXL.
3.0,The bracelet is not sterling silver but the bracelet looks awesome and it serves the  purpose
3.0,A LOT larger than I expected.  Gifted it to someone.
3.0,To tight in bust. They said they would send a xl since shipping it back was costly. Have not received.
3.0,It tangles easily and was a bit of a challenge to untwist the first time that I wore it.
3.0,Won't stay in place as headband
3.0,"These leggings are squat proof, except they are not sweat proof. Definitely shows anywhere you sweat in them which in leggings can be kind of embarrassing. Otherwise for not working out very cute and flattering."
3.0,"Let me start off by saying this bracelet is beautiful and was the second one I bought! The first one started to unravel where the connection that makes it smaller or larger is. I thought it was a fluke and bought another color. The second one I've had for two weeks and has also started to unravel, this time the tassel also fell off. Either these arent meant for daily wear, or the quality is a bit off. I'm disappointed because I think they're lovely, just to expensive to continue replacing."
3.0,Bad with using just one week breaks
3.0,"#1.  The strip at the bottom of the dress is really just fancy holes, not sequins. #2. my ""short-style"" spanx show at least 4""s at the bottom of the dress.  #3. The sizing must be Asian because a 2xl was skin tight on me though I'm normally an x- large. #4. The top on the zipper didnt lay right on my back.  If you can figure out the right size, however, the overall dress is good quality lace."
3.0,They are comfortable but do not offer any compression.  Karen Kohn
3.0,"It’s looks just like the picture and it came on time, but I give it 3 stars because it’s super light weight which means it’s fake."
3.0,The dress has this weird fitting that is disappointing. I don’t hate it but it is not what I expected.
3.0,Nice bag.  Smaller than I thought.
3.0,"While these are not expensive glasses I was still a bit disappointed with the quality of the materials. The plastic tries to mimic metal but feels like it could easily snap if mishandled. The design looks like it might be a nice cross between edgy and classic, but in person seems almost gimmicky. They are polarized which you usually pay a premium for and it cuts glare especially reflected by water, though you sacrifice being able to see some digital readouts because of. The actual look might be a good look for some, though was not a hit in my house. Still, the cost is a fraction of what designer brands ask, albeit their better materials and longevity."
3.0,"This ear cuff is sturdy, but you can't keep it on your ear."
3.0,"Just disappointed with these earrings. Not at all what I expected but does have some redeeming qualities.<br /><br />The Negatives:<br />Backing on the earring is the little plastic holder. One of the earring came without the back.<br /><br />The top of the earring doesn't go far enough up the ear. I don't have but one hole in my ears. I was hoping these earrings would make it look like I had two. But alas no.<br /><br />The price I paid vurses the product I received is not a good buy. I would have passed these up if I had seen them in person.<br /><br />The Positives<br />The earrings are light weight and shimmery. The dangel part of the earrings do catch the light and shine.<br /><br />The earrings do not feel heavy on the ears. They look like they are made well with a thicker metal than most earrings.<br /><br />As I said, if I was shopping in a store, and for this price, I would have walked on by after saying, &#34;Oh how pretty &#34;<br /><br />Maybe my rating is so low because what I expected was not what I received.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, please click on the like button. Thank you!"
3.0,Size up.  This sweater is shorter than I expected.
3.0,"The shape and knit are very nice. I really like the sweater (you can see a shirt underneath at the collar and the waist. And I would call it a light sweater, not a thermal as others have. The overall fit is great, but the sleeves are just a little short, and I’ve never had that issue with tops. I’m thinking about ordering a larger size but I hope it’s not then over-sized."
3.0,Not compression
3.0,The quality isn’t what I was expecting and you have to be very careful with them
3.0,Way too big<br />But they are very cute
3.0,"It isn't truly a Steven universe shirt it's just a walmart shirt with a star ironed on it, but my child still loves it."
3.0,"Depends how you plan to use them. We bought for our 5 year old for camping.<br /><br />They were just ok.<br /><br />They were fine around camp allowed her to run around while keep her foot cooler then a sneaker and safer then flip flops.<br /><br />However, the inside lining came apart almost as soon as they got wet. We took it out and continued to use them. But here is the biggie THEY DO NOT FLOAT. I’m the lake one slipped off and sunk to he bottom never to be found again.<br /><br />So I’m summary. They’re ok they’ll do the job but if you plan to spend all day in water buy them snug so they stay on."
3.0,I purchased these to easily cover us as we go from the hot tub outside to the house. As far as that goes they work. We still need towels once in the house. The fabric clings to you in an uncomfortable cold awkward way when your body is wet.  I think these would be better suited for spa treatments where your body stays dry.
3.0,"I sent an email to the seller of this cuff bracelet asking about the largest size wrist this would fit since I was thinking of giving it as a gift and was not sure what size to order.  I received a very timely response:  &quot;Thank you for the question. Thus is made quite large and can be bent down. I would say it starts as similar to a 9 inch bracelet. Maybe even larger.&quot;  So, feeling safe with that answer, I did order the bracelet.  I do like the idea that it can be bent down to a smaller wrist size and that this would be good to use as a gift for someone.  I was a bit disappointed when I received the bracelet, however.  It seems to me to not show as much silver as I had expected from the online picture.  Also, I don't believe the overall quality is as nice as is depicted in the online listing.<br /><br />I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my fair and honest review."
3.0,Super cute but no compression
3.0,"I searched for days to find the right 3 generation necklace and decided I liked this one best of all. It arrived quickly and I have no issue with the quality of them. But, I have a big issue with the hearts not staying upright. I even changed the order from small on top to small on the bottom in hopes that they would not flip upside down when worn. If they were soldered together, this wouldn't happen. I will take them to my local jeweler to see if it can be done but will probably cost more than the original $20 price I paid for each of them. They were supposed to be gifts but I may change my mind. So disappointed."
3.0,"I'm giving a three star because when I got my package it was only one headband, one out of nine. But the one I did get is very cute, and is the same as the picture. I am very disappointed that I did not get my other eight headbands that I ordered on October 4th and still have not received. But other than that the one I got is perfect and is super cute."
3.0,The only downside is there are no pockets!!!
3.0,"Our 4 month old that is not even in the 50th percentile for his age for head size or anything else got massive red marks from how tight these were on him. They give measurements for the front of the glasses which is great, but the arms pinch in so soon that they're way too tight at the back."
3.0,Love the feel. I like color. Followed the size recommendations but still a bit snug.
3.0,You’ll get about two wears out of them before their a bronze color really wouldn’t recommend
3.0,I got this as a Christmas present for my husband so his face would stay warm when he ran in the winter but the tentacles bounced up in his face when he ran and annoyed him to no end. So... not good for runners but my kids think it's great fun to use as a costume. It is made quite well and should last a long time.
3.0,Not as nice as the picture. Cheap pale plastic. Looks like play doe.
3.0,Just gave it a 3 star ⭐️ because I picked the small size and it still didn’t fit me .other then that it was cute.
3.0,The color was a bright neon orange. Nothing like the picture
3.0,"Very light, but worth cost."
3.0,"I normally wear a med, but this was way too small, so I ordered a large. It too was way too small. This is more like a body con cut and was very tight. I ended up sending them back. Otherwise it seemed to be a nice dress for the money"
3.0,"The rhinestone earrings are slightly larger than I thougt they would be.  I like the attached crystal heart, and the 2 chains which hang nicely  Nice set of 2 earrings"
3.0,"Decent quality. Super cheap price. A few double prints, as we expected. Some plain prints, some really cute prints. But we only received 23 pairs, instead of 24."
3.0,"I love this dress, and thankfully I can pull it on over my head, because the zipper was installed inside out, and the zip pull is on the inside of the dress to where I can't pull it down. Apart from that, the dress is comfortable, fits as expected, and looks nice on. I really love the side pockets. Nice little bonus item."
3.0,I wear a 7 3/4 it's a little bit tight
3.0,"It's okay, but considering price, it's prob. great."
3.0,"Buyer beware of these shirts.  The CB brand is great and the shirts are awesome but for some reason, the sizing on these is way off. A usual Large fits more like and XL - so tried a MED and it didn’t fit right.  Thought it was a fluke and reordered  and had the same issue so back they go.  Can’t argue with the quality but something isn’t right on the sizing for these shirts."
3.0,I don’t like the cheap looking branding used on the outside. Makes it look like a promo product.  Otherwise it is suitable
3.0,Concept is great but the cap is deformed where it is sowned.
3.0,good jacket... go up a size. Large looks like a med... or a large small.
3.0,It fits perfect nice sterling silver material...only thing the end piece to close it together broke...
3.0,Fits but washed twice and these don’t seem up to par with some of the other saxx I’ve bought.
3.0,The price was great as was the fit.
3.0,These would have been fine if not too small. The reviews stating they were too small were all posted after I had bought the product. I will donate them to the homeless. I ordered the same size as I have ordered in the past ( different seller- similar product ) large. I can't re-order these because they come no larger than large . I use them while traveling- What a disappointment to arrive at my destination and find they they wouldn't work.
3.0,Not bad case but if you have a job that you do maintance work it easy to pop off the cover . Happen to me a lot while doing plumbing work
3.0,"See through, but very comfortable. I wish the fabric was a little thicker because they were very comfy, but I can't be running in see-through tights!"
3.0,Tight on baby
3.0,"I love the idea, I like the beanie. But my left headphone is busted. It buzzes. Sounds like something is rattling in it. I want to use these but it's very annoying."
3.0,"I like the style and the breathability of this product, which is great to me!"
3.0,"I like that they are disposable and compact to pack for travel.  The first pair was small in the waist area but a little large in the hip area.  It didn't have elastic around the waist.  The second pair has elastic and is comfortable at the waist, but a still a little large in hip area."
3.0,"even though this bag is sturdy and durable, it is smaller than it appears in the pictures.<br />Tote bags are most useful for daily shopping specially to store the grocery items as i have the habit of carrying my own bag.<br />But this did not dp the work as my stuff did not fit in well. infact this is smaller than most tote bags i have seen."
3.0,"The actual tassel is only 1 inch,  the measurement includes the size of the cap and hook that goes to the keychain. Total it's 1.5 inches, but it's not a 1/5 inch tassel. It's just a bit misleading/tricky."
3.0,Purchased a Large but it was more like XXL
3.0,"Great value for the price and quantity. Unfortunately I had to fix a few due to the way they were packed, the bows fell off of their clips."
3.0,Kind of cute but very cheaply made. Beware they tangle up too easily.
3.0,"My Dad loved how with arthritis in his hands, he was able to put the socks on with more ease tan other compression socks."
3.0,The clasp doesn't hold very good. Other than that it is nice.
3.0,"Unfortunately I will not be able to keep them as they have absolutely zero arch support. If you tend to overpronate at all, good luck finding insoles that will work for these narrow shoes. Also, they run a full size smaller than Nike or ASICS, and will only work if you have narrow, neutral feet."
3.0,Love the quality and look but do not fit as expected. If you order definitely order up in size
3.0,I loved the ring!!! however it turned green hours after I put it on.
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter to use going to/from school. She loved the sky pattern on the inside and I thought the inverted nature was unique. However, it didn't last more than a few uses...several of the points where the ribs connect to the edge of the umbrella broke off. I have no doubt that this was due to the umbrella getting jostled around while she was at school...still...not real durable to only last a few days."
3.0,"Just wasn’t the type I was looking for. Was not comfortable enough for me to wear ever. I’m very picky about that. Also was not flattering on my body. I’m 5’3, 110 lbs. I am trying to find a cheaper version of my beyond yoga pants. They are sooo comfortable. Unfortunately these were not close, so my search is still on. Seem like good quality from what I could tell though."
3.0,Love the print. The elasticity is not the best in the waist area but everything else is just fine.
3.0,I ordered a XXL and after I washed it I was able to give it to a friend since it shrunk down to a medium.  The shirt itself was awesome it just shrunk.
3.0,Not while it half shape and flat. My son loved the taste but was disappointed with size
3.0,"some have came untied and no locking bead to stop the others from sliding around , and with the locking buckle<br />some have cut my wrist because it wasn't filed down to remove the sharp edges ,<br />and the beads them self  great , so that's why the 3"
3.0,"I bought this for an upcoming wedding and wanted something I could wear more than once. I'm 5'2"" and bought 2in heels to go with and it's the perfect length. I ended up returning this because I didn't like the color, it's more brown in person. I'm very pale and it was not flattering to my complexion. It was very soft and felt more like a nightgown than a dress."
3.0,I have bought this item twice. The first one fits just right. The second time I bought the exact same thing. And it’s noticeably smaller
3.0,"It's a little too loose and my neck isn't super small or anything. It looks pretty and seems well made, but I don't like to wear it since it doesn't really fit well. :/"
3.0,Cute shirt. The material/quality is not the best and the Large seems a little bigger than a true Large. I bought it for a fun little gift and it was fine for that purpose.
3.0,"Nice bag, but thought the buckle closure would be very cumbersome, so I returned the purse."
3.0,"Material is very soft, but the fitting is not perfect. Neck is very deep and tight on the vest.<br />I love the color and the prints on the dress."
3.0,"They are cute, but the pendant looks more like costume than I thought"
3.0,"The seams were loose, and puking apart before he even put the costume on. The mask is awkward fitting as well."
3.0,Cant wear so gave to my daughter
3.0,THE 2XL LOOK MIDIUM
3.0,Alright for the money. It's not perfect.
3.0,"I’m 5’ 5”, 140 lbs, muscular and curvy athletic build. I actually found the size to be ok, maybe a tad bit smaller but not a crazy size difference. I bought a large when I’m usually a medium in sweatshirts....I probably could have tried the medium too to compare. The description says it’s a stretchy fabric...it is not however. It is soft on the inside though so that’s nice. It is super boxy, so it does not flatter my figure at all, and unlike the model in the ad, it doesn’t look fitted. The image on the sweatshirt seems like it was cheaply pressed on and will probably not hold up over time. I got the light grey color. Thinking about returning."
3.0,They don't really look like the picture at all. They fit well and are comfy but they're not like actual denim.
3.0,"I will say the material is comfortable, it has a light soft feel. The holes are close together enough to get a good fit. I was very disappointed with the color. The lavender and green are darker compared to the image listed and the pink is more of a salmon color. A fair 3 stars."
3.0,"This shirt's fabric stretches in the water.  It fit well, although a bit loose, when dry.  In the water, the fabric stretches and was billowing around me as I swam.  I am much happier with Speedo swim shirts, which fit closer to the body and do not strech in the water."
3.0,I purchased the XL and it did cover my chest. I reordered the XXL. I get lots of compliments on the look of the vest but I can't zip it. I wear a 16/18 and a 40 bust
3.0,"These shirts are made of breathable material especially with summer upon us, they're super lightweight but feels good against my skin. They do however fit a bit shorter nd looser than the average size small polo t-shirts."
3.0,Only dislike other than sizing issue is the material seems poor
3.0,"These do not fit over your normal glasses, as they indicate."
3.0,Wife liked it but it was tight around the arms.
3.0,"Dress fits perfectly, but disappointed that it arrived with a stain."
3.0,"Very pretty, but also very long.  I have a  short neck, but I will wear them.<br />They are pretty much as represented in the picture."
3.0,This was for Halloween.
3.0,The magnets are not strong enough and I lost the cover after only 1 day.  Beautiful but not practical
3.0,"The bag is nice but the material, not so much. Also, the stitching is not too good."
3.0,"Shows too much of my stomach. Will wear as lounge wear, not how I  wanted for a dress."
3.0,A bit smaller than i hoped for.... more for a child 5 and under.
3.0,"Turns out my watch is too wide to use the band. However, I really like the clasp on the band and am going to purchase another watch just to use the band."
3.0,"Nice material, fairly warm, good stretch. Im a US 10 and the medium fit well. The product is true to the photos.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  I order 2 pair. The ones with the thin holographic stripes fit well. The wide holographic stripes... not so much. Medium was waaaaay too small. Large fitsmy legs, but the waist is badly cut. Like, the front comes pay my belly button but the back barely covers my crack and it doesn't stay up well.  I couldn't recommend the wide stripes for any active behavior. They look nice enough, but there are maybe some quality control issues."
3.0,"This is a very nice dress; however, it was a little short. I'm 5'6 and 160 lbs. I ordered a large based on the size chart and the dress was huge on top, but snug in the hips. It has boning in the top as well so it should stay up well if it fits properly. I wish it had worked for me because it is very well made. The sequins did not fall off all over like other reviews mentioned."
3.0,"I in no way have what you would consider a &#34;big head&#34; but for this to even fit on my head I have to put it on the last two pins. Don't get me wrong this is a quality hat, but it is much too small."
3.0,Really like it but not large enough to easily use with iPhone 6 Plus. Would be so nice if it were.
3.0,"Um not so much. I'm a scuba diver and got this to keep the hair out of my face, it didn't. Kept slipping back, and coming off. I think it's too silky for me. Oh and I was just swimming in the pool with it. I recommend the uv50 Lycra hood if your looking at this for the same reason. It is really pretty though."
3.0,"Very Very dark lens, hard to see out of even"
3.0,"This outfit has super vibrant beautiful colors and a very cute design, however this outfit was a bit disappointing. It was a little on the small side. Plus, the fabric is thin. Unfortunately, the first night my baby wore it it tore in the crotch area. It zips and it only zips partially down the leg so it makes putting it on and taking it off difficult. I really wish it was a better quality sleeper because I truly loved the pattern."
3.0,"Well Built, Size runs very small.  Returned a large for an extra large, which is still a tad to small, but usable."
3.0,"I thought $20 was a bit steep, but I took the plunge based on all of the good reviews. They worked great at first. I would snap them in place and they would hold for the entire day. 2 months later they are either sliding off or travelling along the edge of my shirt towards the front. My daily work routine consists of heading to the restroom to either re-attach or re-position the clamps."
3.0,I like the way it looks but it's so small. The white elastic is easily visible so I have to strategically place the beads
3.0,I unfortunately had to return these as they arrived not clean and with some stain on the material. The pants are glacier grey and I did not also like that the pockets can be seen through the material. Also they are not so soft as the peacoat color capris that I own.
3.0,Waited over a month (6 weeks) for the tote. I am still airing it out. Smells a bit like mildew.
3.0,For what you pay it is pretty decent of a dress. Fabric is thick and stretchy but seams and zipper is lacking. Besides the cheaper materials and some flaws (It was unhemmed) I still like the dress for the cost I paid.
3.0,"Honestly, if you're looking for anti-chafe shorts, get yourself a multipack of Fruit of the Loom mens boxer briefs and they'll work better than these.<br /><br />I spent the entire day fighting the waistband as it rolled down over and over and over again. These snag on the slightest thing. If I'm going to make these work, I'm going to have to sew my own separate elastic waistband onto them, and that's not worth the trouble.<br /><br />Do they stop the dreaded chub rub? Sure. But if you're wearing these under a dress and in a professional setting, the embarrassment of having to run to the restroom or constantly adjust is not worth it.<br /><br />Like I said, get yourself a multipack of mens boxer briefs--men don't mess around with waistbands rolling down or bottom hems rolling up and their products don't do this junk.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful."
3.0,didn't realize it had pockets fabric on skirt is stiff so pockets really poked out I sewed them flat Not made very well it's kind of  off-center
3.0,"Comfortable but not good for sleep as they leave black marks all over the pillows, after a while it looks like someone just scribbled all over it with a permanent marker."
3.0,purchase XL for my mother. She is elderly and has a flat butt.  She has to wear diapers also.  So it was very tight for XL's she only weights 138.
3.0,Beautiful print but the fabric is not worth of the price.<br />I returned it as i received
3.0,I order a size medium n it fit like ex small!!
3.0,"Only about half of the items were wearable in the sense that it didnt slip off.<br />The wavy gold piece and the cat I couldnt care less for because they don't really sit right or look that great on.<br />The skull is a great piece BUT my piece wouldnt completely settle into the closure. It just hangs off loosely. If I tilt my head it just falls out of the closure. Very disappointing.<br />The headpiece with the chain is probably my favorite. If you have thin hair like me you might have trouble keeping the comb in place, but it should be ok if you tuck it into a ponytail or bun.<br />As for the last 2 dangling pieces, they are nice. Mine was missing a closure tab, but no big deal."
3.0,"Love these, but After 2 months the post broke off. :/"
3.0,"As another reviewer noted, the opening is rather small for the size of the bag. Also, it is less structured/much more slouchy than the image makes it appear.<br /><br />And the images also make it look like the hardware is silver, when it is gold. I never wear gold jewelry, so I tend to stay away from handbags with gold hardware. Had I known the hardware was gold, I wouldn't have sent the link to my SO as a birthday gift idea. Especially with the small opening."
3.0,Pills up on inner thighs after one use
3.0,"While the quality is still great, last year's medium was fit like a 10/12 and this year it's a tiny 8. Much too small."
3.0,Fits a bit snug I would advise anyone Togo up a size. I wear a size 12 so I ordered the med(12_14) l feel it's just about snug.
3.0,Material is very thin. Bodice is very boxy and arms are very big.  The back is quit a bit longer than the front which made it kind of awkward to wear with jeans but would be perfect for leggings.
3.0,"I really like these, but I'm leaving a 3 star review because one of the pairs cannot be worn. The one with the bumpy edges prevents the ball from threading securely, if at all. This set comes with only one set of bars and balls, so if I drop a ball on a night out, I'm kinda screwed (no puns intended.. but also, puns intended). These are very pretty, I just wish I could actually wear them all."
3.0,"Nice shirt but size runs small, would choose a size larger than normal. My shirt was to small gave to a friend."
3.0,Cute shirt but it's much smaller then pictured. It's a tight fit and the sleeves are a tad short. I got a large and I'm petite. I wanted a loser fitting shirt and it's still tight. Runs very small.
3.0,Not a fan. I have bought this brand in the store and quality was much better.
3.0,the black easily came off
3.0,Kinda ugly& gawdy
3.0,Bathing suite is nice would have been better is they sent the size I ordered.. And I order up a side based on reviews but I think my size will be right two sizes up was really big
3.0,"much smaller than I had hoped. These are for children, much too small for adult."
3.0,"Good quality, but it runs a little small"
3.0,I bought this as a gift and there is pieces of crystal missing. How dissappointing is it to give a gift for Christmas and your mom tells you that her gift is missing pieces to it? It's very dissappointing.
3.0,It's a nice dress for the price. 3x is more like a large size.
3.0,It looks nice from the front and the back but the open side looks funny. I wish it came with a thin bend to hold the sides together so it doesn’t move around so much.
3.0,"Very cute dress. Falls nicely and is flattering by drawing attention away from the abdominal area. Unfortunately, when washed the colors did seem to bleed in the skirt so now the white background is more yellowy. I’ve only worn it three times so a little disappointed."
3.0,Just the length
3.0,"They broke the second day I had them, I’m disappointed because I really liked them"
3.0,"very good looking watch in a room, but in day light very difficult  to see the hands and the smaller hand also the lock for the band is easily come loose just a bend of the wrist toward the lock."
3.0,They fall down.
3.0,The shirt was ok and looked nice. The fabric was not the highest quality with some defects. It ran very small in the chest so I had to return it.
3.0,I went up in size as recommended but it fits weird (or maybe its the ways its sewn)in the hip area and about at the waist. Its a beautiful pattern though. I think the fit would of been better if the slit (shown on model) was on the product that I received.
3.0,"The fabric is gentle, soft, and flowy, and the color is very nice--true to the picture. However, it is unflatteringly wide; I got a medium, which usually works on my 36&#34; bust/31&#34; waist. But I had to take the sides in one and a half inches each, in order for the shirt to look good on me. Order as many as two sizes smaller, or be prepared for a sewing project :) Still love the color and softness, though."
3.0,"Jacket was really small, I made it work but I would not call it by the size I ordered it as"
3.0,"I support for women with a larger chest. Choose not to wear out but it look nice, it was just the no support I couldn’t do it and worry about nip slip all night lol"
3.0,"Bought for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it, but it doesn't glow very long, even when ""reactivating"" it."
3.0,"It's a nice looking key ring. It just sits a little wide. My Honda key (which I got this for) has one of those narrow slots for the key ring. So, this key ring would get stuck sideways in it and jam up.<br />I say it's more a faulty key design, but what are ya gonna do? If you have keys with narrow slots or small holes this key ring might not fit."
3.0,"The tights are alright, I would avoid squatting because I heard some fibers snap when I squatted. Hip thrusts are okay though. You get what you pay for I guess. Design is pretty large and noticeable"
3.0,"These are indeed incredibly and comfortable.  Sadly,  they are not very warm and I I would've thought a product advertised as ""thermal "" would be warm.  Great PJs though"
3.0,This was too short and pretty clingy.
3.0,"The quality of fabric is strong, not flimsy or see-through. I do feel that they run on the smaller size. I would have returned but I'm giving to my daughter."
3.0,This clap on earring is so pretty.
3.0,"Warm, it said it had a lining but it did not."
3.0,"The hat is the proper size and works fine on my child. I was however very disappointed by the color/ shade. I ordered the yellow expecting a similar shade as the picture, but it isn't like that at all. What I got was a more flat mustard yellow color, nothing like the cute bright yellow in the photo. I kept it because the embroidery and everything still looked fine, but I'm definitely disappointed."
3.0,"This is a really cute dress, nice fabric, well-made, extremely flattering except whose 2X arms could fit through a size 2 petite arm hole? This would’ve been a 5, but isn’t wearable so I should’ve sent it back. Unfortunately I got it just before the long trip I bought it for and then we came home to covid kerfuffle and it just didn’t happen."
3.0,I bought two pair - I wear them in the gym shower and around the pool.  The first pair got wet - and the right sandal curled up like the Wicked Witch shoes - I can't wear them any longer.  The second pair performs as expected.  I guess there was a defect in manufacturing.  I will be returning this pair to Crocs for a replacement.
3.0,"I think this was pretty good, seemed like good quality but I had to return because  it was to small. It runs about three sizes to small."
3.0,Thought the watch was going to be like the picture.  Face was actually more a rose gold.  Not the silver as depicted.
3.0,Love the feel. However they started to tear after about a month of use.
3.0,Pants are smal
3.0,"The bracelet itself is nice, however, From the first day of wearing it, the clasp kept coming loose. The second day of wearing it, the bracelet worked itself loose and fell off my wrist unknowingly to me. Update: The company actually read my review and contacted me to either replace or refund me for losing the bracelet. So A+ on the customer service!"
3.0,"Suncloud Pursuit replacement lenses work well, but would prefer darker lenses with more variety of colors."
3.0,"Still not sure if these shoes are real leather, i dont think they are which means they will probably last me less than a year, but i guess for $35 what could i expect?  Look good now will update."
3.0,The silver lining surrounding the crystal is too thick and the crystal is a bit dull/cloudy. I don’t think I would purchase this style again.
3.0,It started turning colors already
3.0,Seems a bit bigger than a medium... And it's all white... Picture makes it look black on the inside and thicker than it is... It's sheer.
3.0,"These are very cute and nicely made. Seem very durable however, they are made about a size or 2 bigger than normal. Other than that the are great however, ordered normal size and too big."
3.0,The material is very thin and the sweater did not fall right. Expected it to be longer in the front
3.0,band color is discoloring.  watch was functional but not for long enough. would like a replacement
3.0,"This is a very nice band and would be very comfortable. It's advertised as fitting 42-46mm watches. 4 pins are included, but they were all for the 42mm watch. The pins are too short for the 46mm bezel. My wife has a 42mm Galaxy watch and was pleased to have the band."
3.0,Fragile but looks great
3.0,"You know your feet the best, but for me, these were hard to break in and when they did, the arch wasn't in the right place. They were never the right shape for my feet, making them look shorter than they really are. That made it harder to get nice lines. The plie II's (capezio) worked better for me, but these might do the trick for you and they're quite a bit cheaper. These are great if you have a wider toe and a strong arch."
3.0,"Any way I try and tie it, it shows my boobs and falls apart. Doesn't stay right :( sad because it's so beautiful"
3.0,Great lightweight pullover. Wanted a neutral color to wear in warmer weather. This is perfect. Size fits well. I ordered an XXL because of bust size and wanted room to move.
3.0,"Colors were as pictured, shape as expected.  Upon inspection, noticed hole and fabric pull.  Waiting to hear from Amazon if they want it shipped back or discount it for me to keep"
3.0,Wallet itself was sturdy enough. The snap broke the first time my son took it off
3.0,Quality of product was good but not light weight as discribed
3.0,This bag is on the small side...
3.0,Wish u sold it in larger sizes. My son is 11 months old but fit him too tight.  I need size 2t
3.0,"I pulled these shirts right out of the dryer and they are still WARM and still have wrinkles.  This material is soft and comfortable, but so thin and wrinkly I would only wear them to bed.  Actually they are perfect for that use.  So I gave it a 3 star, but no one wants to leave the house looking like a hobo.  Wrinkle city."
3.0,"They do the job, but there not made to last long, about a month, and one of the side pieces broke. I guess it was worth the price."
3.0,"Bought these for bridesmaids for a wedding and they're were wonderful. Pretty, but not too flashy and it's great that you can get earrings and clip ons. As the one who needed the clip ons I can say that they are very comfortable! I wore them all day and barely even noticed that they were there.<br /><br />I bought one extra by mistake and the return was fast and easy."
3.0,Light a little too light in color but a great fit I wish the print was darker but for the price I can live with it
3.0,"It was so pretty, but it broke the first day I wore it (the owls separated), so it could have been made better."
3.0,"Fabric is soft, but it looks messy all of the time."
3.0,Not great quality but ok to use for few months for growing feet
3.0,Too big didn’t feel like I was getting the necessary quality of the mask
3.0,"These are stylish shoes that are easy to put on and “tie” if you haven’t learned to tie actual laces yet.  However, the strap system doesn’t do a great job of getting our staying tight and eventually they almost seem like slip on shoes.  As a result, they are not great for quick movements, rapid turns, or running.<br /><br />If I were doing it again, I’d get big boy laces and spend sone extra time teaching my son to tie them properly.  I think that would serve him better in the long run."
3.0,Don’t expect high quality for the price but my daughter still loves them.
3.0,"Great product. I gave only three stars instead of four because the third pair of leggings has a small hole in them. Otherwise these are great! Fit as expected too. I am 5'4"" and about 170lbs and the large for great."
3.0,Esta ok para el precio
3.0,Beautiful necklace but I was disappointed because it wasn't the same colors as the one pictured on here. The one I got isn't as brightly colored but it's a nice necklace.
3.0,The description says there are pockets but there aren't.  Pockets are important to me so I returned
3.0,Nice looking men's bracelet however; the clasp keeps coming undone.  I move around a lot in an office setting and found that it had fallen off next to my desk several times. If it had a more secure clasp it would be on my wrist all the time.
3.0,"These don't fit as expected, the sizing chart listed isn't accurate. The pair received fits more like a 13 in men and not 15"
3.0,The stickers that came on the bat was coming off a bit but other than that it was great
3.0,runs small but cute
3.0,Cute but don't stay in well.
3.0,"The material is very thin - not thick like a sweat pant- more like similar to a windbreaker, and the slits in the sides only work  if the parents are consistently pulled up on your waist."
3.0,Love this dress and I am sad that I have to return it. I am 5’4 135lbs and ordered a medium. It is a little too big but I was willing to work with it until I saw the yellow stain right on the front. I will probably reorder a small after I return the one I have.
3.0,They are very short and a bit small
3.0,I had to send this back because I was expecting 2 pairs and only received one. The  quality seemed okay but the size was also a tad off.  I might have kept it for the price had I received 2 pairs... seller needs to update description.
3.0,This is cute but it’s not as small as it seems and everything is kinda bulky
3.0,Cheaply made. Piece fell off after a week.
3.0,Cute dress. I would have kept it but the zipper didn’t lay flat on the side.
3.0,"The sweater arrived wadded up in a bag unzipped. Looks used. Faded. Has some pet hairs on it. It has zero stretch. It’s soft enough but seems like after 1 wash it wouldn’t be anymore …like a cheap beach towel. Also seems like fabric that’ll shrink up with a wash if that makes sense ? I got Xxl. Very large busted usually size 16. It’s plenty loose as of now maybe too loose but like I said after a wash might be more snug? In my option, its way over priced for what you get. I recently got a danskin full zip hoodie that was so super soft and was hoping this would be comparable but it’s not even close. Look for that one on Amazon. They just have 3 colors but you’ll love it"
3.0,Hard to use because they are short so you need to remove hat and or other items you are wearing to get them on.
3.0,I got a 3X and it's more like a regular size large
3.0,"Several things made me return.<br />1.) Light pink is more  like flamingo pink, instead of nude, blush pink, not attractive.<br />2.) Fabric is a little heavy and stiff<br />3.) little high waisted, so if you have a longer torso, odd fit."
3.0,The smalls come at size 4 and I am a size 2 so it was a little bit too big for me however I think it's still a nice dress.
3.0,The best part of these socks is the boost you get when you wear something colorful on your feet. These are very comfortable and the colors are a refreshing change. They work well with loafers and sports shoes. I did not find socks like these anywhere. They have bold colors. They have a high cotton content. Nothing is more uncomfortable than wearing 100% polyester or a cotton polyester blend with a higher percentage of polyester that directly touches your skin for most of your waking hours of the day!<br />I give these a 3 star for the above reasons. Now the missing two stars are for the following reasons. I wear a size 11 US shoe and these are a little small - they also slip of the feet and into the shoe while running. Very thin construction and I don't think that they will last for too long.
3.0,Only buy this if you love granny panties.
3.0,"It looked so CUTE in the photo & I couldn't wait for the dress to arrive. Unfortunately, it ended up being like a &#34;Granny&#34; dress on me. There is elastic that falls in an odd above the waistline area & looked horrible on me. Back it goes 😥"
3.0,Fits big for an XL but it serves its purpose for work since I dress business casual at my place of work.
3.0,"I bought this for my sister for Christmas.<br />We’re about the same size in shirts, she’s  wanting to “ renew” her wardrobe and she likes the things that I find whenever I go to town for groceries and stuff. I picked this polo because of my sister likes that style.<br />The underarms are too loose and I know that she won’t wear it. It’s also a little too short for a person 5’2” and long torso.<br />I like it but it’s not going to fit me either, I’m taller than my sister .<br />I don’t like “bat wings” .<br />I’m returning the shirt."
3.0,It runs very small. I normally wear a med but got this in a large so I could sleep in it. It fits me very snug!
3.0,Very cute and I was super excited to wear it. I normally wear a large but ordered an xl to be safe and it suctions to every part of you. Wish I would have known this before ordering. Def not a flattering material. Sadly I won’t be able to enjoy this as planned
3.0,The black part is nice and stretchy but the opaque parts is not so the fit is a little uncomfortable
3.0,"The hat looks great but it's too small.  I am a 7 3/8 hat size & this cap barely fits on the last snap, which looks kinda goofy. If I use the 2d to last snap, it leaves indentations in my forehead...which looks kinda goofy. I'd say this is more sized for an 11 year old boy."
3.0,It is not steel boned and could use another hook in front and you can't get it to tight because it comes open where the hook should be.
3.0,Cute but too many wouldn’t light up
3.0,"The description said that they were 4&#34; high but wow! I don't think I could wear these for long. Unfortunately I will have to return them. Even though they are lace up, my calves are still a little too big for these boots."
3.0,Never got to use them as they were ment to be. Not the most comfortable glasses to wear but we'll made none the less. Good product. Just bad experience for me. Would still recommend to everyone.
3.0,"I liked two thirds of this choker set, I got them as a gift for my sister.  They all fit her very nicely but she had some issues figuring out the longer one.  It was a little too long for her liking.  The quality overall was not bad, pretty good for the price and it doesn't look or feel that cheap/  The clasps are good quality.  The package as a whole arrived well protected and on time.  The two pieces she thought were very cute!"
3.0,"These yoga pants are nice and soft. Except I ordered the 3 pack and only one of the pair fit as expected. The other two are more like a large than the xl I ordered. I love the colors, I just wish the other two pair fit like the black pair. The grey is too tight and the green do not stretch at all in the waist area."
3.0,I purchased two of these bags less than six months ago for daily use. The inside lining started to fray with in the first 60 days. At ninety days I had to cut the lining out because I spend an hour searching for my cars keys which had fell inside the lining. Scary!!
3.0,Pretty dress fit is off runs small
3.0,"fit as expected, but i'll tell you this.. if you have boobs larger than a B cup, your chest will look ridiculous in this dress. you'll need to wear a tank top."
3.0,"The shoulder &#34;pad&#34; is just a stiff piece of plastic with spikes for grip, so not very comfortable, but is still perfectly functional."
3.0,"I'm 5&#34;1' and about 115lbs. This dress was just too big for me and a bit frumpy. Cute dress, would have kept it if it was a better fit for me."
3.0,Top part too high above waist needs to be longer for flattering waistline as it is . Fabric for skirt Ballons around waistline not flattering  on bodice.
3.0,"Ordered the tan color, material is pretty thin so choose under garments wisely, but it does the job. I am usually a medium but it fit like a large so I exchanged for a small which fit perfect."
3.0,"The hat is super cute, but its super small. I will be returning it"
3.0,"I love the color, pink. However, I am unable to get the wrinkles out. The care instructions prohibit using the dryer or an iron,and line drying it doesn’t work either."
3.0,"Pretty average, not spectacular but will do. I like the design, but they don’t seem to stay well when sliding the ends into the watch itself."
3.0,"Is beautiful design, but the sizes are not for kids faces, they are too big"
3.0,Color and quality are as expected. My only disappointment was that these were not wide legged as the picture shows.. more like a slim boot cut.
3.0,"I looked and looked and looked on the website for a WHITE weekender watch band and couldn't find one.  So I purchased this one.  It's okay, but the color is not what I need or want.  Can I get any help with finding a white one??????  Tx"
3.0,good product.worth the price.
3.0,This scarf is the perfect weight for everyday wear but its short and doesn’t loop well.  The size of the scarf seems more suited for a child not an adult.
3.0,Ran small. Had to reorder. Otherwise a great hoodie.
3.0,Cute shirt.  Not the best quality and runs small.
3.0,It runs quite small.  It is sold as &#34;blue&#34; but it's actually turquoise.  The quality is excellent.
3.0,I really like the way the purse looks and all the pockets.  However. I have used it for 3 months and it is already falling apart.
3.0,I love the functionality of the wallet. A bunch of pockets and zippers to put whatever you want in it. Only thing that sucks is the material. It's not leather. It's a cheap matte material. Well it feels cheap. I'll update when I see how well it holds up. It's bug enough to fit my iPhone 6s plus in a few of the slots. So that it nice. Even has a nice wristlet. I really hope the material hold up. Wish it felt like real leather.
3.0,This feels like plastic and is not what I was expecting.  I give it a 3 because it was still cute and my young niece loved it.
3.0,"Disappointed. Returning the top. The sleeves are way too long, and, though this is a long-sleeve top, the fabric is quite thin. It is soft and clingy. The seams on the sleeves can be felt against the wearer's arms."
3.0,"Just a little tight in weird places, but super cute."
3.0,"After washing, mask gets wrinkled and hard to get the wrinkles out without pressing with steamer.<br />I would not recommend this product."
3.0,"Great price, the clips are extremely difficult to open and close for adults...tons of assistance required for kids!  If you are a baseball player, you need the magnetic clasp if you want to wear this on the field; however, it is about 10% of the cost.  For the lower cost, I am happy to have my son take this off when he is in a game.  Bottom line, I would buy it again.  I had to take 2 stars off for the clasp though."
3.0,It was heavy so even though it was a wide weave it was warm. However I was upset when looking in a mirror there was a non intentional hole on my chest.... had to return and wasn’t worth ordering again.
3.0,"I always wash my family's  clothes  after we buy them, and this suit faded first wash, and also bled onto other clothes... I also had to fit the had, hot glued the rim to the hat part, it looked funny."
3.0,"Even with the size listed, I still found them smaller than anticipated.  My fault likly for not having a strong grasp on the metric system."
3.0,The cups are small. When I pull the cami up the cups don't quite cover! Just a strange fit?
3.0,Eh..so so...very light and the inside of them is not even painted black. I wont return them but would not buy again.
3.0,gave to a freind
3.0,"Product too small to fit comfortably on my head.  I can get it on, but should be larger sizes for men"
3.0,"These are VERY cute! I wish we could have kept them. But size 2 was somewhat small in length, while the bow part was way too wide. Too bad."
3.0,Was purchased as a gift. I don't know if they liked it.
3.0,"I was looking for an actual wrap dress so that I could tie it in a way that it would fit my frame snugly.  This is actually a faux wrap dress, and though you can tie it, you can't pull the tie very tight, so really there's no purpose to having tie straps.  So while it fits my arms and is a good length, it is still a little boxy on me, so I'm less than thrilled.  I will probably return it.  I wish they had said that it was not really a wrap dress (the way other faux wrap dresses do), and then I could have not wasted two weeks ordering and waiting for something that was not what it said it was."
3.0,The strap wasn't sewn on!  I had to sew it myself....you get what you pay for I guess
3.0,Doesn't wash well.  One wash and the middle part of the shirt was faded 10 shades (the arms didn't fade at all though)
3.0,"Too tight on my leg. For Hinata cosplay, but it kinda hurts my leg."
3.0,beautiful product but was for extra tall women
3.0,The fabric and color are pretty but it is very small. I released all 8 darts and now I can button it.
3.0,"I got the solid black pair and the galaxy print. The solid black seems thinner and looser. They fall down when I run. The pair with print are not like this. They feel thicker and stay put when running (unless there is something in my pocket, then they fall on that side). Overall good pants but I won’t get any more of the solid color and feel like I lost on that buy."
3.0,I love the look of the hat but there is not a string inside the hat to make it smaller.  My hat is loose and should fit better.
3.0,Good product but chest too tight with D breast size cups
3.0,Was a lot smaller than expected and did not fit my daughter. Def order a few sizes up. It was a really nice shirt though...
3.0,"These earrings work better in theory than in actual wear.  The hoop part of the earring goes through your piercing.  The top of the earring is supposed to rest inside your ear in the conch area, but it there is no mechanism to keep it there.  As a result, the top of the earring simply falls out.  Without some type of anchor for the top portion,  gravity will win every time.  The earrings themselves are beautiful and well made."
3.0,"Wanted to like these as finding a 6&#34; inseam for short legs is hard. Seams bunched after 2nd washing, and fabric picks up lint like a magnet- straight out the dryer they look dirty and I have to run a roller over them. Looking elsewhere . . ."
3.0,I only wear this around the house so I'm not so concerned with looks but this hoodie doesn't look that great lol. It is pretty tight around the neck so I cut it. The front pocket is pretty small also. I would probably go with a different brand if I were to purchase another hoodie for around the house.
3.0,"I returned the bands.  Thought they were cotton, not cotton with sparkly metalic weave. They are pretty, just not what I was looking for."
3.0,"It's definitely meant for smaller people or children because the mask is rather small even for someone of my general size (I'm 5'7"") the resin mold definitely guarantees sturdiness but sacrifices comfort as a result."
3.0,"I ordered the multicolored ones but received the black and white ones due too personal issues i was unable too return them, But they are cats so i am keeping them. I will reorder them when they come in the multicolored ones again"
3.0,Did not fit comfortably.
3.0,"20mm watch band barely fits an 8"" wrist, I have it notch one, and it's almost too tight.  I may have to return it.<br /><br />The band itself is very nice."
3.0,They’re comfortable to wear around the house or in the summer. A little thin for the winter. They waist band is a little constricting.
3.0,"Cute, but no good quality"
3.0,"Great feel however,  the lint will be all over your shirts. If you wear a white dress shirt it is over. I have to keep a lint brush handy if i wear this scarf. I even washed it and the lint still continues."
3.0,Very comfy but the fabric fades and fluff after a few washes. Cheap fabric.
3.0,"You just can't tell the size on these watches. . They are pretty cool, but be prepared to give it to someone with smaller wrists"
3.0,"Here's the thing about this dress: you get what you're paying for when it comes to quality and fit. The dress was mad cheap and arrived very quickly, but the fabric is very thin and the collar is a bit tight. I recommend sizing up just so you have a little room to wiggle, or just like.. breathe in general. But if you're looking for a tight fit, then yeah order your normal size. I think it's a cute dress, but I definitely think you could find something better looking and feeling somewhere else."
3.0,"First off, this is listed as a dress. I'm 5'11"" and this is a longer t-shirt on me and not a dress. There's no way I would bend over in this thing without pants or shorts on. I don't know if it's supposed to be a short dress or what the manufacturer is going for, but I will wear it as a t-shirt. My review will be based off that. I like the black color, how stretchy it is, how comfortable it is, and how well made it seems to be. I don't like how thin the material is and it's not really very flattering. It's a long t-shirt. There's no extra details to make it flattering. That's just what it is. Overall it will be nice in the summer, but I probably won't leave my house in it."
3.0,It’s very pretty and easy to put it but it’s so huge. It hung almost down to the top of my lip. I can’t even wear it because it looks ridiculous.
3.0,These are really small you can't even tell you have it in I already lost 4 of them trying because they are so small you can't see it on the floor great price though but to small for me
3.0,"Perfect size, material and price.  Very nice jacket. But runs small so order 2-3 sizes up...😣😣😣"
3.0,"Love love love these. At first, some spots felt a bit tender, but that dissipated within a day or so and now I cannot wait to get home to wear them. (I use them for my inside shoes)<br />2/6/18 update. so about a month ago the part near my toe started ripping, pinched my foot and I had to throw them out. So bummed, as I really loved them and was hoping they would last longer. I resisted buying another pair for a while, but I really miss wearing them around the house. So, I just came on to buy another pair and they went up $10. $50 is just too much, especially if they are going to break in 6 mos. so disappointed :("
3.0,"Hmm I just got it tried it on, 1 of the 2 lock nobs just popped off when I went to take it off :-(  I didn't want to pinch my neck so i was being gentle, it seems sturdy but a little pressure at the wrong angle I guess and its a wrap."
3.0,"Well, on the plus side my package came a lot earlier than expected.<br /><br />On the downside, the color of the dress is nothing like the picture or description.  The description described this dress as &#34;army green&#34; and the color I got was more of a very light sage green.  Also, the material is very see through so I would definitely choose wisely when selecting undergarments.  I am going to keep the dress because I feel like I can dress it up with accessories as depicted in the pictures that the seller uses."
3.0,"These were very nice leggings, however I sent them back because I constantly had to keep pulling them up. They fit good when I first put them on. The more I walk the more they would slide down. Maybe it was because of the fleece lining. Very warm and comfortable though."
3.0,"Same great Casio quality, but the watch is very small."
3.0,hat is stiff.  it stands up.  Doesn't slouch.  put it on a basketball to stretch it out.  We'll see how it works.
3.0,"It's cheap, but it has some threads very notorious and you can crack down the buttons with it."
3.0,Unremarkable.  Fits OK and no significant issues.
3.0,You get what you pay for there not awful but not great either and it took FOREVER for it to get here .
3.0,I love them and think I look super cool but they are a bit flimsy and may not last very long. They were very reasonably priced so I don't feel bad about this purchase.
3.0,"This sports bra offers little support. It also runs a little large and cannot be adjusted. It’s soft but, unfortunately, it didn’t work for me."
3.0,They were not comfortable for my granddaughter<br />they hurt her feet’s
3.0,"Sock sizing is inconsistent to the point that it made me wonder if I had a mixed batch of two different socks. One will go right up to my ankle no problem while the other needs to be stretched significantly to get around my heel. I've tried them on both feet and this seems to be a problem on half the socks I received.<br /><br />That said, socks are comfy and a good price. Would buy again if I knew for sure they would all be the right size."
3.0,"I love the design and I thought this was a nice quality bag, but I used it everyday for 3 months then already handle is coming off... Not a great quality"
3.0,"The top fits okay, will have to be careful. The bottoms are too small, I ordered a large all though I wear mediums in bottoms just because I saw it runs smaller, the large is still to tight can not wear them especially with them being a thong based bottom."
3.0,"Don't go by the picture. They look orange and that is why I chose them. BUT...the color does say ""wine"". Mine are definetly a dark red. Not burgundy but red. So if you like these shoes and wish they were red you are in luck!"
3.0,you get what you pay for... but they work!
3.0,Not as it appears... very loose knitted...will give away
3.0,had to order 2x the normal size to fit right.
3.0,Very nice looking dress but the sequins are itchy for your arms
3.0,I returned the shirt. It looks generic and cheap. Sizing was correct.
3.0,"I have a bezel set diamond and thought these would be a nice compliment. I was a little disappointed, they are much larger and heavier than I expected. My fault for not really knowing what 7mm looked like. In hindsight, I would order the next size down. I think they would have looked a little more believable and sit better on my ear lobes."
3.0,It was very wrinkled
3.0,"Pretty thin yarn, not plush. They work for in the house or something where you need a sock but not putting in a lot of actual movement eg cycling, rowing"
3.0,All I can say is you get what you pay for. It was true to size. It’s just a lot more cheesy in person. Doesn’t catch my fancy in person like the image did.
3.0,This bet did not perform as advertised.
3.0,Bit smaller than I expected but for price a good little suit
3.0,I loved the style but it would need to be ironed to look decent. I ended up sending it back.
3.0,I live in Az and the heat in summer can be 105 degrees plus so regardless of how much I wet the hat it will dry in less than 1 hr. So on the golf course I have to soak the hat frequently
3.0,This shirt does not look like it's pictured. It's a thinner material than it looks although it is lined with fleece. It's wearable but fits tightly and has no stretch to it. I would recommend going up a size. The shirt looks nice enough overall.
3.0,"would of loved it, if it fit"
3.0,I have a bunch of SoleHugger Actives and I love them. They never slip and never have odors. Thought I'd try out a different product but these aren't as comfortable.
3.0,"It's too small in the arms you have to have slender arms to fit this dress . I ordered a large and I am only 5ft 4  about 140 I usually wear a 6 but based on the reviews I read I decided to buy a large, well it's fits with the exception of the arms so I will probably give it as a gift of return it."
3.0,Cute fits well but see through
3.0,Satisfied!!!
3.0,Seems smaller than my size; hurt my toes. The back of shoe on my left heel also hurt. I still want a pair of Gravity Defyers so will treck out to the store that carries them so I can try them on before purchasing
3.0,Great shirt. My son has one and loves it. However this XXL was wayyy to small. It was closer to a Large.
3.0,It is NOT 14K it is overlay.
3.0,It was too small.  Item was not true to size. I sent it back
3.0,"I would love to put 5 stars. I bought 2 dresses, the seahorse and cherry one.<br />Pros: 1. Very affordable cute dresses! Many other companies sell plain cotton dresses for much more $. My 5 year old does not like ""boring"" so these are perfect.<br />2. Shipped very quickly<br /><br />Cons: The seahorse dress was great. The cherry one had a dark stain right around the cherry. I decided to return. Got the replacement very quickly! However, the replacement also had a stain. Instead of going to the trouble of returning again I sprayed with shout and washed it. The stain did not come out.<br /><br />I love the dresses themselves but you would think they would check to make sure my replacement wasn't flawed as well. Dissapointed overall.<br />I got the 7 Y for my 5 year old."
3.0,"Bought two pair of these and both ran small. Also both came looking like they had been washed and in no bags. So surprised at this great brand, and at Amazom for letting thes go out. These were for a gift, so I of course am sending them back."
3.0,Digging a new hole for a plant in soft potting soil is the best use I've had for these.  Digging up weeds worked for a few but then the edge of the claw in the glove would start to scrape and hurt my nuckels.  Having some sort of graduated flexibility or rigidity would be helpful feature for these.
3.0,Colors were very vibrant. The material for the bottoms kept slipping down. I returned it.
3.0,"These seem to run a bit small. They have a velcro strap on the top to ""tighten"" them but it doesn't tighten anything, it's just a velcro strap really. I don't know how they will stay on yet, but I am guessing not well since the velcro strap is pretty much pretend"
3.0,"Order up a size, this runs small. It's a beautiful lab simulated Opal, however, the silver ring part is not as thick and pretty as shown. It's been soldered where it silver touches silver, and it's quite obvious. The ring arrived tarnished."
3.0,Good material but wasn't long enough and I was unable to get it to tie like the pic. Had to return.
3.0,"Sadly, I had an allergic reaction within a couple days as a result of these earrings. If you have sensitive skin, don't purchase."
3.0,"I've ordered two packages of these. The first one I ordered was great. All the compasses lined up correctly and the threading on the fasteners was fantastic. However, with the second package I ordered, none of the compasses pointed north, and the fasteners were unreliable and extremely scratched. It's nice if you just want the compasses as more of a decorative piece, but if you actually want a working compass on your bracelet, don't buy these. Needless to say, I will be looking for another supplier soon."
3.0,"Way too big, so I sent them back and got something else."
3.0,"Love the outfit, 12mos size bottoms fits good,top fits like 3to6 months could not wear the top,baby is 10 months old very disappointing"
3.0,"The quality is pretty cheap, but you get what you pay for.  I will definitely be using a different chain"
3.0,I expected them to be thicker but thickness was medium level
3.0,I wanted to keep these shoes. They are so cute and the heel is a great height but I could get them to stay on my heel.
3.0,Works but not very comfortable
3.0,Bought theSe for my daughters and daughter in law. Finish wears off.
3.0,Not really teal.  More turquoise blue.
3.0,"The material is amazing, size was great, I’m 150 and liked the size 10 for generous sizing (size down for tighter fit, or use a waist belt). My issue with this product is that the stitching between the various layers is facing outward by design but looks very cheap. In the black color it’s not noticeable but any other color, it is. However, an amazing material for the summer and the dark green is not see through. Also I’m 5’4” and the dress was floor length."
3.0,"Looks cheap in real life, but it its big."
3.0,Filters aren’t secure and move around. Toggles on ears break easily.
3.0,small but liked.
3.0,"It doesnt keep time and the strap pinches like crazy! Needless to say, I dont wear it."
3.0,Big for me had to return it.
3.0,Sides too short
3.0,"Soooo flattering on me! I am 5’1” and 120 lbs and this fit PERFECT. looks great on me. The only reason I gave 3 starts instead of 5 is because the 2nd time I was putting this on the left strap broke off. It was a quick fix because it could just be sewn back on, but it was still a little disappointing."
3.0,Thought it was nice at first.  Good weight.  But after only about 3 times of wearing it I've noticed it has stretched out.  There looks like there is a bead or so missing now.
3.0,Runs large not exactly like pictured
3.0,"The boning doesn’t allow for the back of the panty to come up high enough in the back if you have a fuller, rounder butt. If you do, it’s pressing down on your butt and doesn’t give a flattering shape. If your butt is smaller and sits a little lower, this is the perfect garment for you."
3.0,"Had read this fits true to size, so I ordered a large. I received it 6.5 weeks after ordering it (which it to be expected since it came from China). Material felt nice, need a crochet hook to attach a majority of the buttons (elastic was stitched too short on some), color was a bit muted but pretty. Couldn't get the dress over my boobs and had to unbutton all of the chest as I wondered how the stomach area was. I am 5'4"", 170 pounds and 38DD. Probably would've needed a XXL for it to fit properly in some areas lol. Perfect for someone with zero curves."
3.0,Bigger than I expected but still nice.
3.0,It smelled like chemicals.
3.0,"One chipped easily when I took them out of the bag, the color is coming off onto my ear. Wouldn't shower with it on or sleep on it but they are cute."
3.0,Was a little hold
3.0,"Thw quality of the fabric is great. I like this shirt dress, but it most definitely runs small.<br />I typically wear a large, but like to go one size up for extra comfort. After reading the reviews, I ordered two sizes up, and got the XXL.<br />When it came my fiance and I scoffed at how small it looked. Putting it on, it comes in as probably a Medium in size.<br />I can wear it, but it's certainly not what I was opting for in terms of a casual, loose, comfortable look and feel."
3.0,"It is nice looking and flattering through the waist, but the leg openings were super tight even though the rest of it fit well.  It gave me the dreaded double butt that was very unflattering."
3.0,"runs weird,,,,tight in the body,,but if I got any bigger would fall off my shoulders???"
3.0,"I wasn't expecting a plastic metal plated emblem. Sorry, way too expensive for the quality. I use it for the ignition key on my Yama, I'm guessing it won't last long flapping in the breeze."
3.0,It looked odd on.  The top section just feels like a bib and the bottom wasn’t fitted so it added a husky feature.
3.0,"I NEEDED THE SNAP ON THE END BECAUSE THE ONE I HAD BROKE,DIDN'T NEED THE REST"
3.0,"Estos articulos se visualizan buenos, sin embargo la billetera es de mala calidad, super fragil. por lo que no auguro durabilidad."
3.0,the color is diffrent
3.0,"Bought for my wife, but she says that they are too heavy and the clip eventually loses grip.  She has lost this and other similar earrings in the house because the clips are not strong enough for the weight of the earring."
3.0,I think these come from China where everyone is tiny. It states it should fit all. I'm not huge but it was not loose enough to look like picture.
3.0,"These are simply made, and not something I can see most adults wearing. It's more of a costume piece for teens/preteens.<br /><br />There currently is no listed price, so I can't say whether it is a good value for the price. If affordable enough, I could see this being a cute party favor if your younger one is having a Little Mermaid or Moana theme party."
3.0,Nice but the color advertised is darker than the lime green that arrived. Fits well.
3.0,"I like the fact it has ties, but quality of the bib is very flimsy."
3.0,"The red of this dress is beautiful. Stick to your usual dress size! Wish I stuck with my usual M size instead of getting a large (which honestly looked more like an XL bc I was drowning in it). Returning bc even if I did get a M, the cinched part makes my bust area look way larger than it already is and gives a ""Little House on the Prairie"" school teacher vibe. Looks great on the model but stay away if you're top heavy. For reference, I'm 5'4, 140 lbs and 36DD."
3.0,I read other reviews some said it runs small but it is not the case with this blouse. It is true size!!! I am size M and I bought size L and is too BIG!!!<br />I will wear it as a pajama.
3.0,I love these caps except after two weeks two of them don't light up anymore. The rest are working perfectly and are lovely.  Slightly disappointed
3.0,Pads in shoulder a little off
3.0,i like this a lot  but i will not were it all the time  only once in a wile because its way to dante  i will were it going out to dinner or to the movie s  o and one more thing be very careful when tacking it off or putting it back on very thin chain also be careful when you clean it  you could break it and the pearl  is the right size
3.0,"Kind of cheap looking, but fine for a beach cover up"
3.0,"These are very nice looking, however, the index finger has twisted so badly that the pad that should be on the inside has twisted to the outside!"
3.0,You get what you pay for! Looks better in the picture than in real life!
3.0,Way too small then I expected.
3.0,"I bought this dress to use in my photography studio, but didn't end up using it. As soon as I opened the bag, a button fell off. The dress wasn't my client's style so I returned it, but I would consider buying it again for a future client. The fabric is a bit thin, however. Not sure if it would've been see-through when on."
3.0,makes my neck itchy but I like the style
3.0,"The picture shows two pairs, I only received one"
3.0,I found the bags too heavy for traveling ...
3.0,"I was so excited to receive these compression socks!  Couldn't wait to try them on!  I'm an 8 1/2 wide and the S/M was like 1+"" too long. Broke my foot in April so I bought them for the compression, but had to send them back."
3.0,"i normally don't like to write bad reviews but i wanted to help out others who are my height. I ordered the dress that had the bell sleeves and the collar attached to the dress. I heard good reviews from a blogger and someone else i worked with on this dress, so i figured i'd try. I am 5'3 and the dress was very long on me. In the pictures it looks as if it would sit above the knee, but it went to the knee to cover and looked really goofy on me. The return window was only a few days, so i am stuck with this dress. It just doesn't fit right at all. I ordered a small and i'm pregnant so you'd think that the length/fit would be tighter too. I wouldn't order again."
3.0,"I like the pin , but writing is to dark to see, it would be just right if it was the same color as the little girl shirt, or white writing, the whole point of the pin is to be seem, by people and ask &#34;What is JW.ORG?&#34; and us to give a wittness to them"
3.0,"Let me start by saying I bought my regular size, an 8.  I really needed an 8 1/2 or 9 in this shoe.  They definitely run small!  I would have returned and swapped for a different size, but once I received the shoes I felt that the quality did not match the photos.  They felt and looked cheap, and I couldn't see them holding up well."
3.0,This was really cute.  But the first time I wore it the clasp broke.  Bracelet was nice but the clasp Very cheaply made.
3.0,This top runs small. Definitely size up or even go up two sizes depending on the event.
3.0,"The skirt was a perfect fit but because I’m a little bustier, the zipper would pull so I couldn’t zip it the way I want. If you get the one with buttons and are busty, I wouldn’t suggest it."
3.0,Pretty cheaply made.  I feel it is going to break in the middle after a few times wearing.
3.0,"Material not as expected, but it stretches.  Cute enough to wear over all white, blue or denim."
3.0,"This item would have gotten a 5 star if the sterling silver chain was not dull. I was shocked that they did not clean it. It only takes a minutes to use the cloth to shine up a sterling silver chain. The pendant was very pretty. This will be a bday present, but I had to clean the chain so it would look like a new piece of jewelry.  Doesn't this suppose to be new merchandise."
3.0,It’s OK but I wasn’t expecting to be rigid
3.0,"Chest was too small and overall snug.  If you have a med to large chest, don’t bother.  This fits the more petite woman.  Very very cute tho."
3.0,Good quality but sizing is off. My daughter is 3 1/2 years old so this should fit. It looks like it would fit a 5-7 yr old. The leg opening is way too wide.
3.0,This shirt was very stiff and felt pretty cheap overall. I worried the decal would come off after one wash.
3.0,"fabric was waffle textured, comfortable, soft 2the touch and did not itch. it also fit as expected (xl). i was disappointed, however, in the thickness. the ""sweater,"" as it was described, was not sweater material."
3.0,I bought a small and it reminds me of a moo moo. I knew it wasn’t  suppose to be fitted. But goodness it was wide and flowy. Goi g to return it
3.0,Maybe it’s just me but I like my pairs of earrings that I sell to match. 10 of the batch don’t and it’s annoying cuz I won’t sell them that way. So I’m stuck with them unless I buy another batch and hope they match the new ones gggrrrr. Other than that they are really cute that’s why I gave them 3 stars
3.0,Nice jacket but the size runs small. I would suggest you order a size larger maybe two if you have intentions of wearing on top of a bulky shirt. I would order again.
3.0,Very cute. Top is completely mesh so you need something under. Shirt isn't stretchy. Skirt fits perfectly. Nice framing feature.
3.0,The sweaters are OK for casual use.
3.0,It’s ok- bought for a 3 year old but it has the word baby printed on front corner which she hated.
3.0,It's a heavy duty weight stainless steel but the faux opal isn't very convincing and it is big.  It won't work for what I had in mind.
3.0,They cut but a little awkward. Hopefully I'll get used to them.
3.0,These are cute but slightly sheer. Definitely don’t feel comfortable wearing these out unless I have a longer shirt on.
3.0,There cute but broke after a month or so.
3.0,They allow more air through than most. I just hate masks.
3.0,Not wool. Sweater material. Not as baggy as the picture.
3.0,"My daughter is 4.5 and this is very snug on her. I would recommend ordering a larger size.  The material is ""you get what you pay for."""
3.0,Writing is a little small to read
3.0,"These shoes are very pretty but they get dirty easily because of the material that they are made out of. And they do run at tad bit tight. not too bad, but a tad bit. Other than that they're very nice shoes."
3.0,"it was just okay, the quality is not so good."
3.0,The earring were hard to open and close
3.0,"Nice little gift. Shipping was fast for coming oversees. Wife and daughter love the watch. I bought two, different colors but both came same color. Also size was off a little so my wife and daughter switch watches to make it work out. Both have petite wrists so watch band is small."
3.0,My 13 year really liked the look BUT it turned color about 3 weeks after occassionally wearing it.  She is disappointed because she really liked it
3.0,clasp broke the first time I tried putting on my wrist.
3.0,Thought they were silicone. They are not.
3.0,"This dress is meh. The fabric is stiff but thin, and the cut is really shapeless. I also think it's an inch or two too long for this style, but I'm short.<br /><br />Based on other reviews, I ordered an L. It fits across my chest but is a little too big everywhere else. If the fabric had a bit of stretch an M would have been prefect. For reference, I'm 5'4"", 32L, hourglass shaped, and wear size 12 dresses/pants in most brands."
3.0,"Sorry for the ugly photos, but I hope they help someone.  As you can see, this top is not for you if you're like me:  busty and carry your weight in the torso.  I am 5'4"", currently 167 lbs & I normally wear anywhere from a large to a 1x top.  I ordered this one in a large b/c it looked roomy.  I would send it back and get a larger size- but as you can see, the arm hole is cut really big.  So I would imagine that if I did size up,  that too would be bigger.  I'm not  a fan of having my undies show when I lift my arm. So, this one for me is a definite 'no', but may be great for you if you're built differently.  Also, just to note- the orange color is much more pale than that shown.  Still a pretty color, though.  Hope this helps you choose a size!"
3.0,"I really like these glasses and this is my third pair, because I had lost the others, but these broke quickly"
3.0,"I received this one piece bathing suit in good condition. I ordered the ""Floral311"" color and it looks exactly as pictured. It is a light blue background with dark blue and dark green leaves and red flowers. The colors are vibrant and the print looks nice. The fabric has alot of stretch to it. Amazon recommended I size down to a medium, but I decided against that and ordered a large. This was a good decision for me and my body type. So in my experience this bathing suit is true to size. Unfortunately it is only lined at the front, making it sheer at the back which is really confusing on why they couldn't just line the entire thing throughout. The fit is comfortable, but the cut in the back is definitely a little cheeky. Not a thong, but not full coverage either. Additionally, it is described as having tummy control, but there is none whatsoever. It does have cups at the chest for a little support. I'm really torn about this bathing suit, it's beautiful but the design isn't what I'm usually comfortable wearing so I'll see if I actually end up wearing it. Smaller girls with nothing to hide or those with plenty of confidence should be fine."
3.0,"These are just thin (though soft) spandex, and run very small.<br />My daughter just turned 11 and wears a size 12 slim in clothes, and an A cup bra - I ordered these bras in 14/16 and they fit real snug. Jeez.<br />I def need to replace these with something better."
3.0,It is much smaller than in the picture.
3.0,But I got a misprint where the red bottoms on one side were crooked. Fit was good though
3.0,"Cute shirt, runs small. Fabric is okay but feels like it will wear quickly"
3.0,I bought these glasses for my wife specifically for her nighttime driving. They looked and fit nice however they did not reduce the nighttime glare so we returned them.
3.0,This product was advertised as a sweatshirt but I would not classify it in that category.  It is a very light spandex like material.  If you want a sweatshirt do not order this!
3.0,"Pretty sweater, mine came damaged, but also a little small."
3.0,"this is a cute case, but not something to be opened everyday as the clasp will break so you have to be most careful with it"
3.0,"Cute colors! Quality is ok. Length runs short, had to send back"
3.0,It is pretty but some of the lace at the bottom tore after 2 wears. Pretty see- thru so know that. Comfortable to wear though!
3.0,"Add elegance on the costume my daughter got for Halloween, LLC Glitzy Goddess, White/Gold, Small."
3.0,"LOW SUPPORT for bigger breasts (38e), good enough for light exercises like yoga. Fits pretty well, covers everything nicely, but if you have shorter torso/ high positioned bust you'll have a problem with straps width and back length - straps only have about 2 inches to adjust. Plus for a very nice padded part on the shoulders and good quality for the price."
3.0,"The shirt is a bit seethrough and wrinkles easily, but besides that, it's a cute shirt."
3.0,Too big def not for short women
3.0,Very cute boot but silver doesn’t hold up long term. By the end of the season they were looking rough.
3.0,Both zipper pulls fell off after 1 week of light use.  The stitching on the lunch bag was separated upon arrival.  The lunch bag is too small for food and ice pack.  She used it for snack.<br /><br />Quality  is inconsistent. I bought 3 other bags in different patterens and they seem to be made better.
3.0,HaHa cheep sunglasses. It’s ok for the price
3.0,"This little silver book looks better on a 16&#34; chain and is too large and slim for a bracelet. Therefore, the description &#34;charm&#34; should be taken lightly. Other than that, it is a pretty little piece."
3.0,"Wanted to love however, very long / saggy in the crotch or to have fit right, would have to hike the to belly button..."
3.0,"Tissue thin, a little transparent, even when a little broad."
3.0,Absolutely beautiful! Was surprised the earrings did not come with backs though - will have to purchase separately
3.0,They're okay .. One of mine broke as soon as I got it
3.0,It is fine to wear a few times.  Definitely not high quality though.
3.0,This is longer- but not very stellar fabric. I was expecting more lift or control. This doesn’t have much.
3.0,"Comfy, but HUGE and the pads are a pain to get in/out when washing."
3.0,The shorts are a weird puff in the front. The underwear are odd looking and material is super rough not soft. I like the bra top.
3.0,I like this a lot but the zipper snags when i have the phone in it which is kinda dangerous.
3.0,"These seem like good quality with a nice case and frame. But they come with small and large bridge (connecting eye pieces) and even the small is too big for my husband, who does not have a small head (far from it).<br />Note that I received these at a discount in return for my honest review."
3.0,These are ok. They serve the purpose but are shorter than pictured. Just about long enough for my 7 year old. The plastic clips which hold the masks are difficult  to open and make putting mask on and off more difficult than it should be. If given the choice buy one with metal clasps like on most lanyards.
3.0,Thier okay. Way more catty looking than I thought. Plastic is extremely light weighted.
3.0,THIS FEELS VERY CHEAP !
3.0,Color I got was different than what I thought before buying it. I do like the texture tho.
3.0,Love the colors but did not realize this is pullover not button down blouse. Ok for the price
3.0,"They don't looks as good as in the pictures, kind of cheap looking. One pair came bent and looks lopsided on my face. I'll use them on occasions where I may lose them and not care. Wouldn't buy again."
3.0,The shirt is great but the sizes run small. I got an xl and it fits like a large or medium.
3.0,Very hard to secure clasp
3.0,sizing ran small. ordered my daughter normal size and it was way to small.
3.0,"It is very warm but seems very tight in the arms and bust (with only a sweatshirt underneath).  I got a medium.  I am about 5 feet tall, 125 lbs (give or take since I haven't stepped on the scale since before the holidays).  I am thinking of returning it because it is so tight.  It arrived in an unsealed plastic bag (plastic bag had a ripped hole in it) and the tags were enclosed but not attached to the jacket, so it appears to have been a prior return."
3.0,I liked this product. The material is a bit thin and flimsy. They were are a bit snug on me but still fit well. Could have a better material. Overall not bad.
3.0,Dress is beautiful as shown in the picture. Color is very vibrant and very skin friendly. But there were lots of loose thread hanging.. and also the bow was big disappointment. It had rough cut shown.
3.0,It is really cute. Not the quality of would expect for the price.
3.0,"The feathers are not long like in the description and because they're feathers, they weren't even as shown in the picture"
3.0,pretty but big
3.0,"Colors were a little different, no biggie, still rainbow. The ties ripped off and material was thin. Good for a cover up but probably won't make it to next summer."
3.0,Only used this product one day and they are unglued now.
3.0,they're cute but not well made. you get what you pay for.
3.0,"The only problem for an average persons is that the sleeves are a little short, need at least 1 inch longer. Material very nice, arrived on time."
3.0,Nothing like the picture.  Its very short.  Material is good color is good but short in body.
3.0,"These socks are very comfortable...however they don't seem to stay up.  I don't know if it's my wiggly feet or a problem with the product itself.  Once I almost slipped because the extra fabric left at the toe doubled up on me.  If you buy them, just be sure to pull them up anytime you stand up when wearing them."
3.0,Kinda thins falls apart in the washer
3.0,"Beautiful, cheap, but heavy - hurts ears. Or maybe it's just me. But I like them anyway)"
3.0,"The Chosen one bracelet is good. The one with Harry Potter on it, the lettering is too tiny."
3.0,Didn't look as good. Wasn't flattering on my apple body type. Returned item
3.0,"Cheap plastic! Would be beautiful if it was not plastic. Good size, would love if it was better quality"
3.0,Smaller then I thought..it's just OK
3.0,Nice fit but it is NOT as long as it looks in the picture
3.0,"This both fit larger than expected and the way the seam/front hung was an odd fit. Maybe would be fine for different body type, idk. For reference I am 5'4"" and 137 pounds."
3.0,Colors and design are good. Fit is smaller than expected. I would recommend getting a size up from your usual.
3.0,It was okay.  I only wore it once.  Cheaply made.
3.0,"Beautiful, but very thin chain. Broke after a week."
3.0,Pattern so large that it looked like I was wearing the curtains 😞
3.0,"Nice color and swim suit, but too big when I ordered according to the size chart. The straps were also not as pictured and kind of awkward to place."
3.0,"I wanted some nice metal cufflinks, and while I think these are made of metal, they feel like they're made out of plastic. I guess it doesn't matter if it's all for show, but there is just a general cheap quality to the cufflinks."
3.0,"The hook piece is awesome- perfectly sized and really great looking. The only problem is with the lanyard- it feels sort of plasticy instead of leathery. This also makes it too easy to adjust- the fastening knots slip a bit.  I think both of these issues will be resolved as the k eclace gets worn in! I'll keep everyone posted. Overall, I LOVE the necklace!"
3.0,the lace gathers in the front at the wrong spot and looked like nipples poking out.
3.0,"Sadly I had to return this. Bottoms fit well, maybe even a bit loose. However the top was no match for 38DD. I ordered a 2XL. I am 5'6&#34; & 185#. I usually wear a 14. Quality was as expected for the peice but as I said I didn't use it so can't be sure."
3.0,Believe it’s just sharp because of the threading but believe me u will get annoyed of countless time u have to unscrew the back but they look nice and shine bright as for the the earring it’s self as a whole
3.0,The charm itself was a lot bigger than expected. You need to have a large chest area to wear this and have it look right. I bought this for my boyfriend and it's too big on him.
3.0,"Likes: cute design, price<br />Dislike: not true to size and patch doesn't exactly fall on elbow"
3.0,Very nice quality ties but had to return color was mint green  wanted dark terquoise it wasn't as the picture
3.0,I wasn’t what I expected.
3.0,Within the first few days the material looks worn and old. Not good lasting quality of the material.
3.0,I used it as a cover up and it fits great and looks great; however it was cheaply made and started coming apart after only a couple uses.
3.0,"Glad I got a size up. The style is nice, but it should be a baggy fit and it's more like a regular long sleeve shirt kind of fit. I think they made a design mistake putting the waist band's ""cross"" in front rather than in back. It pulls the fabric closer at your ribs which loses the peekaboo effect. It's still ok, but switching that detail up would have made it better."
3.0,They came apart from the middle and you couldn’t tie them
3.0,"I ordered two sizes up and it's still a little snug, but I will still wear it.  As others said, you do need to wear a tank underneath.  Great colors tho!"
3.0,The Good:  They look pretty cool in the picture.<br /><br />The Bad:  Then when you put them on you realize...&#34;oh crap I have to lace them up.&#34;<br /><br />The Ugly:  These shoes when they are laced up.  They come with two shoelaces each so when tied as suggested by the packaging it gives the impression that you fear your feet will somehow escape from the insane asylum of your body.<br /><br />The Summary:  They look awesome in the picture but are hard as heck to tie without ruining the style.
3.0,I had to re-order. The package states to order 1 to 2 sizes larger than what I would normally wear and I did that. Still too small. I ordered the 2X and hopefully that is larger than the 5X.
3.0,Obviously cheaply made due to price but I thought I would take a gamble. I'm large chested and it was impossible. Also if you tie the top tight the bottom becomes shorter and shorter... if you know what I mean. Returned.
3.0,Very thin and the top seems as though it'd be for a very busty woman.  I'm a C and it's VERY loose on my girls.
3.0,Does not have a partition to carry a bottle of water. I like the size of the bag.
3.0,The croc style doesn't allow as much as the non-croc styles.  I pulled the same cards from my old one into my new croc style and it was difficult to clasp.
3.0,it look better on line
3.0,"Okay, this dress was a fiasco!  I ordered a large to start with and when I finally received it, it was too small.  I couldn't return it so the seller refunded me and I ordered an XXL since the L was so small.  Well the XXL was too big!  I am a seamstress so I was able to make one beautiful perfect fitting BOHO dress WITH pockets that fits me perfect.  Also I might add that there were differences in the two.  One had facing around the neckline and arm holes and the other didn't and the pockets were also different.  I'm happy now."
3.0,"Great socks! They work like they should stop all the moisture. That cause feet to itch, I got 6 pair's and I'm very happy with order. Would buy again These  other socks that claim they wick moisture work some but nothing like these. Made very well sizing is on par.<br /><br />Update after 6 months of wear 5 pairs have holes in the big toe area. I like how they keep my feet cooler than regular socks. The quality is not their I hope the company will fix this problem, these are good socks overall. But they don't last long at all."
3.0,"I gave 3 stars because it's actually pretty and made well... The issues I have is while the body part of the shirt is really large,  the arms are narrow and the shoulders are narrow..  I'm 5'2&#34; weigh 120# 34 DD and got medium and a large... The medium was way too tight through bust and shoulders... The large fit me like a sack dress...  It swallowed me up... So the sizes seem way off"
3.0,"nice cap, I did not like how it liked on me so I gave it away."
3.0,"Rather low quality.  I kind of expected that given the price for a set of two.  I was hoping to use it for a cell phone microscope project, but they are not suited for this -- laser pointer lenses seem to work better.  In any case, these loupes do provide decent magnification and might come in handy in the future.  I'll definitely hold onto them and have no need for a more expensive loupe."
3.0,"It said xl, I’ve bought xl alway and this simply is not xl, large tops. I’ve since bought 2 pair elsewhere and no problem."
3.0,my order had six pairs. five of them were not knee length but rather came up to the middle of my calf; i have average sized legs. the top of the socks rolled underneath itself. the material felt warm but scratchy on my skin. darn shame because the patterns are so pretty
3.0,La tela es corriente. El forro se encoge con las lavadas
3.0,Fit really tight..I am a small women but this was really small.
3.0,"ITS okay. the material of the jacket is cheap and appears as it may rip. i got a size up and it fits well, i recommend getting a size up fro original size."
3.0,This dress did fit as expected
3.0,Is there any way that I can return this gift?
3.0,Its okay...its thin and it pulls my hair. But when I wear my satin scarf with it...its just fine.
3.0,The belt looks nice and it seems true to size but the quality is not very good. The holes stretch out easy and the belt itself kinda feels like cardboard.
3.0,still trying to adjust it.. after working on it for a while i got tired and i haven't tried to work on it since. i will.  i don't buy something i don't hope to like.
3.0,Kind of cheesy but I still like it and will wear it often to work.
3.0,"It has a plastic protection sheet, but there are no instructions to remove before applying heat. Thank goodness I had a protective sheet between it and my heat press! I only ruined 2 blanks."
3.0,Super cute but runs very big. Our little one swam in it for her first birthday party 🤷‍♀️
3.0,Is really a 1/2 shirt
3.0,"I like the fit, and this 'shirt' does give good back and stomach support.<br />However, I expected it to 'press' my shoulders back more than it does (if it does it at all, I couldn't perceive it)<br />Still, I'll wear it again."
3.0,"Ok fit, if you lift your arms at all the entire shirt comes with it. a little extra slack on the shoulder cut out would have probably helped."
3.0,Everything was perfect with this band. The size was a little different from other I have purchased. This is great for smaller wrist.
3.0,"These fit great and were very comfortable when they were first put on.  VERY thick.  And then we laundered the socks, they came out smaller and tighter.  I guess the lesson is to wash on  warm at most, and then don't let them go into the dryer.  The idea of having to plow through my laundry to pull out a pair of socks is really not worth the effort.<br /><br />So, these are comfortable socks.  BUT there are lots of other thick socks of this ilk that don't shrink the first time you wash."
3.0,"I thought this was going to be a cool shirt for an afordable price,  but it shrunk so small after washing it that my husband never got to wear it.  If you do buy it,  choose a size or 2 up from what you normally wear"
3.0,"Cool looking sweatshirt, as described it is very light weight.<br />No pocket in front makes it odd."
3.0,"Not that impressed - bought for my three kids ages 6, 5, 2 and they constantly slip down from over their nose. I have tried everything to get them to stay and they just slip right down. Was really hoping to love these since they are thin and lightweight; perfect for summer"
3.0,I’m 145 and 5’7” and got a M and it fit fine ! I am tall so it rode up a little and I have no chest so I had to pin that!
3.0,"The style of these rings are adorable, however, they arrived mostly broken and seem to be made out of aluminum foil. Do not recommend, even for the price. That being said, customer service is impeccable! They are sending replacements rings."
3.0,"The shirt is OK. It doesn't fit me as well as I'd like, and I ordered a small (5'5&#34;, 135lbs). If I lift my arms up, part of my stomach will show, and I have a short torso. This shirt will most likely be my weekend shirt."
3.0,"The only issues I have found are these:<br />It puts extra strain on the button or snap up front and the farthest forward belt loops.<br />If you are carrying anything heavy, the elastic has too much give and it will allow your pants to ride down your waistline."
3.0,Tiny. Ordered these beautiful little pulls for sweaters but way to small. Decided to use them for wallet pulls. Looks cute.
3.0,"Great quality but fits only if you have a head like a pencil. Too small, little stretch, too uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,"Over all an okay product, but when it came down to it, the underside of the bracelet has too much bulk and is too uncomfortable due to the leather cors used to create the x pattern. The cord seems to be simply laced through and tucked under itself creating a very uncomfortable asymmetrical feel on the wrist."
3.0,"Fit ok, but short cuff would like the cuff a couple inches longer"
3.0,occurred! Product is great. And I plan to buy more. Fit was perfect.
3.0,"Don’t get me wrong, I like the way it fits but personally I don’t like the material."
3.0,"Got to say, although these look cute when on, I'm not impressed by their quality. Turquoise part looks like enamel and golden part looks stained already and they are brand new.  From afar they look cool, retro and stylish but they aren't good quality earrings.<br /><br />On the positive side, they are pretty lightweight!"
3.0,"It has a more wider, blunt shape for an anhk--I prefer the anhk to have a smaller &#34;neck&#34;.  It's is well made--I gave it three stars simply because I don't like that shape of anhk.  It still has five star quality."
3.0,"Some of these were really nice, some were too tight!!! The seams in a few of the socks are uncomfortable and squeeze all around my feet , feels like someone wrapped string around my foot in all different directions really tight! Some of them are great though, dyed and full color. Not the patterned seamed ones tho."
3.0,The waist doesn't stay up the way my other leggins do. I feel like they slide down as I walk. I'm 160 & 5'5.  I ordered a medium which is what I normally wear. Not impressed!
3.0,"You can't wear them as high waist if you want then to be long. I'm 5'3"" and i had to pull them down a little and could only wear my 3"" heel for the long look."
3.0,I liked the picture and color but it was way too small
3.0,Really liked these for a while went through like 4 pairs in few months seems like supplier went cheap. All always broke in the same spot
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:c9179a697ee8c50f225389a950387710]] I loved my whole outfit but the dress wasn’t a complete look without this petticoat.<br /><br />This petticoat can in a small circular bag and it expanded when I took it out. That part was cool<br />But what wasn’t cool was that I couldn’t figure out how to close it back so that I Could get in the car. I had to ride with it in the back seat expanded. I then had to almost break the thing to be able to step into it discretely right outbound my car.<br /><br />The look was giving, but I could only give it three stars because the velcro on the inside wouldn’t stay closed. Luckily I think the designers new larger women would be trying to squeeze themselves in it so there was also a draw string that I was able to tie. But…the con again there is that I tied it so tight trying to make sure it didn’t fall down and embarrass me that I literally had to cut myself out of the thing.<br /><br />Now I think with a little more patience I could have worked the knot out…but anyway, it looked exactly h"
3.0,"Disappointed. I think it would be great if it was longer, like the picture shows. I’m only 5’4 and this came to just above my knees. Need to return it."
3.0,A bit of feedback...dont glue the white label to the front of belt requiring a person to pick at it for 30 minutes to get all the white label and glue out of the threads...thise are the details that separate quality from not quality.<br />I also removed the loop as it was pohibitive to slide the belt through and I can just as well slide it through a jeans loop.<br />Like the tecture and colors.
3.0,Yes! It was a very well liked gift!<br />LaDonna Dixon
3.0,"Very cute dress, fit me wonderfully through the body and length was appropriate, but it was extremely tight in the bust area, so I won't be able to wear it. If you decide to order, go a size or two up from what you usually wear."
3.0,"I bought a pair of these in San Diego at the Lego park. Amazingly they were cheap and fit my weird shaped head well. But after a great deal of abuse doing HVAC, I lost one of the nose peices. So I bought a new pair on here and after three months of babying them, they fell right in half. No joke. They completely split at the area that is at the crest of the nose.<br />They look great for a cheap pair of glasses. But quality is what you pay for!"
3.0,Was alright but the side panels don't allow easy card access. I live in the city and taking out a metro card is fundamental.
3.0,is not soft.
3.0,"The dress didn't fit through my shoulders and upper chest. I went by the measurement chart (XL, 5'6&#34; 200, A/B cup, pear shaped) , and it fit everywhere else. I have a pretty small chest so I was surprised that it didn't fit there.  The material was good and it even came with a liner, but the Navy color was way darker in person than the photo. That much was fine. My only complaint is the fit."
3.0,"I brought it for a friend, she loved said was going to wear it."
3.0,So this shirt was a good fit great material however I washed it before I wore it and when it came out of the washer it had no letters. So essentially it’s now just a black shirt. I also ordered 2 sizes up
3.0,I can not wear this dress without leggings because it opens easily all of the way up the front.
3.0,"I bought three of these so i could change it up. Out of those none of them worked for my charge 3 at first!!!!!!!!!!! The problem was that one side would lock but the other would not!!! It would go on looking as if nothing was blocking the way, but yet still not locked. After calling by bf for words of encouragement i hulk smashed and squeezed the straps in hopes of being able to get it past the clips and it work!!!! So only buy if you have the capacity to hulk smash and squeeze that clip on there! Have a nice day<br />P.s my hands hurt"
3.0,Pretty but I don't like how you have to bend the bangal to take it on and off and with Charms on ito doesn't seem to fall right on the wrist.
3.0,"These are nice shirts, very comfortable, but shrink to the point of being too small after just the first wash. I would suggest purchasing a size bigger than normal so when they shrink they might still be useful."
3.0,"We bought a size bigger to allow my toddler some room for growth. Seemed ""cheap"" as the strap tore after my toddler wearing it once. Appears to be true to size."
3.0,"I loved the color which is not too white not too cheap looking, but the SIZE...<br />even though I ordered the small, which I'm very average small size, it was a way to big.<br />I gained weight so I thought it could be tight but the waist is the bandage.<br />It did not even hold my waist. I returned it."
3.0,"Liked the design and bling, larger than thought, but some of the bling came loose after a day or two."
3.0,"Fit larger than Patty’s other similar styled  sweater dress . Size medium in the zip front elbow length sleeve dress was considerably more fitted. Decided to return due to itchy material. Size would be fine for business use but if you want a true fitted look choose your  size carefully.  I am 5’ 7” and a size 4 . Broad shoulders, narrow hips , 32 DD."
3.0,"This blouse was a bit smaller than I usually wear. I ordered my usual large size, and it fits pretty snug. Arms are ok though. Its pretty long, can wear with leggings with no problem. The print on mine is more orange than the picture shows. the biggest problem I had was delivery. It came from China and it took two months to be delivered to me."
3.0,"I got this to wear over a tee while camping. The material feels nice, almost synthetic. That said, the sizes are definitely off, considering it's from China. I'm 6 foot, 160, so I'm slim, but have broad shoulders. I ordered a large, a size up, since I wanted to make sure the sleeves fit right. They barely fit right at all. If I could do it again, I'd order an XL."
3.0,"Great material, great color but maybe an over the bathing suit dress for the beach would be it's greatest career.  It just really hung on me like a potato sack.  I wear it around the house.  I would try to find a belt or something but unfortunately it doesn't work because of the much loved pockets."
3.0,"I like how they looked and were light & fur lined so they were warm, but they are not very comfortable. Even with inserts that cost more than the boots, my feet ached at the end of the day."
3.0,"I couldn’t take a pic because it was too revealing where the slit was.<br />If ur curvy, like me (I’m 5’9-10ish, 205lbs) most of my weight is carried in my thighs and hips and butt. This dress is ideal for slim women not anyone tall with curves unless you go up drastically in size. I’m small breasted so I couldn’t. Anyway, it’s a beautiful dress. Really elegant but it didn’t work out for me."
3.0,I ordered 2x the waistband elastic on the pants was so small I gave the pants to my size 1 daughter.  The top fit nicely and the fabric is super soft.
3.0,these were cool glasses but unfortunately not nearly dark enough for my macular degeneration
3.0,Cute but u get what u pay for...
3.0,When ordered just be aware that there isn't much stretch to this dress without thinning the material. I ordered a size up for this reason. Overall a very pretty dress.
3.0,"This is brown. It cannot be confused for any other color. I hate the color. The shade of brown is just not nice when coupled with a puppy paw. The two just kind of make me think of one thing. My sister said the exact same thing. It is also not a sweatshirt, it is a shirt. Not a thick shirt either. If I hold it up, I can see through it."
3.0,It's beautiful but much much smaller than the size indicates. Unfortunately I am unable to wear it to the wedding I bought it for because it is way too small.
3.0,Hat was too large for me and very stiff. Was very well made though.
3.0,"It's ok to wear for short time while at work, but the end comes out too easily. not made for all day wear or while eating."
3.0,"Too small for a mans wrist. Maybe for a woman or a boy, I returned."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this bracelet, but it was just a poor design. The two solid pieces were bent far too narrow to be wearable for anyone. It would probably fit a small child or petite teenager but not a normal sized person. Unfortunately I missed the return window so I can get a refund, but I do not know anyone with a wrist that small."
3.0,Size are not right
3.0,"I got a pair of these pants to wear with suspenders, but they are way too loose and baggy."
3.0,Made of good quality but it was too short.
3.0,Love the color and fabric. But short in the length and crotch
3.0,The fit was a little snug through the hips.  The color is beautiful.
3.0,"Feels comfortable, but the footstep/sole color has too much grey when I was expecting it to look more black."
3.0,It looks nice. The straps are comfortable. It fits a little larger to me. Only thing I hate is the wire. It hurts the on sides.
3.0,"I like the look of the item but it came apart after one week of wearing. Not broken, the piece screwed back together, but I will probably look for a different band for regular use."
3.0,It doesn’t look brand new to me.
3.0,"I really like.the feel and look of the metal band, but after a couple months the edge of the band starts getting sharp"
3.0,"I give it 3 stars for the style. The fit, for me was too small."
3.0,I bought this because of the message and color but it was wayyyyy to big which is odd because the size I purchased normally fits. Therefore I had to tuck it in and it still looked big but a little more presentable.
3.0,Slippers run 2 sizes too small<br />Daughter usually wears a 6 so I got the 6/7 size and it’s more like a size 4
3.0,The backlight barely illuminates the display.  Did anyone else have this issue? Other than that I like it.
3.0,I should have gone with the waist measurement instead of the hip. I always worry about them not fitting my hips since I am hourglass shaped and carry most of my weight in my butt but if they weren't elastic in the waist they would probably fall off but they are comfy. Next time I will order a size down.
3.0,The dress fits but the belt is a little small.
3.0,Easily torn
3.0,Does not conform to face well just kind of hangs there in front. Also came a day late.
3.0,The Velvet is nice. The color is good. The fit is a little baggie. But the main issue is the bottom does not close! I am having to wear pants under the dress in order to not have personal parts exposed!! I thought about returning it but I do love the top of the dress. It fits really well and even a little baggie.
3.0,"It was a little small. I was expecting it to be loose. I ordered a medium. It is cute though, even if a bit on the form fitting side."
3.0,The dress in the picture and the one that arrived are different. The sleeves are shorter and have flowers on them.
3.0,Odd fit. Little longer then I thought but I’ll still keep it
3.0,The quality of the fabric and stitching were great. The only down fall was the top portion was too short.
3.0,Looking for soft outside & inside. This is soft inside.  House pants for winter.
3.0,I measured my finger accurately before purchase but still doesn't fit
3.0,Cute for a small gift
3.0,"Fit was a bit small, but cute anyway."
3.0,"For this to be an oversized hoodie, it sure runs small.  I wear a medium and I needed an XL for it to fit loose on me.  Material was super soft. Pockets are extremely small/shallow. I wouldn't feel safe carrying a phone or keys in them."
3.0,"So this one is hard to review. It is super cute, but it is short. I did order a size up as told, but the torso part was really short. Considering that I am only 5 foot 4 I was surprised that it did not want to come all the way up. If you tie it tight enough it will then fit somewhat, but still not perfectly"
3.0,"Looks just as pictured, downside..way too small."
3.0,"Escribe texto o la dirección de un sitio web, o bien, traduce un documento.<br />is not as nice.<br />was dispatched and delivered at the estimated time"
3.0,"A lightweight cap in a very cool effective pattern. I dont like the design of the cap as much as some other companies which make a more rigid cap. Brim is a bit long compared to others too. It costs more then some, but since most companies producing Pencott pattern gear are not in America it makes sense they would charge more. An acceptable cap in a great pattern."
3.0,I rely heavily on sunglasses because of sensitivity to light.  I bought a couple of these. They look nice and fit my glasses perfectly. They also do a decent job and I loved them.  However the right lens came off both pairs after like a week or two of using them. I was very disappointed. I don't know if it was a bad batch. Am contemplating if to get them again or just use the ones with the big knob in the middle that am currently using.
3.0,Pretty cheap but fine fora 4 year old
3.0,I thought the bracelet was a little thicker. Very thin. It's ok though.
3.0,The seam in the inner thigh want sewn correctly so I had to fix that. And the crotch was a little wide eventhough the rest fit well.
3.0,I bought these for the tapers. The paint chips off the metal tunnels.
3.0,The colors on this are very vibrant. Only 3 stars due to the sizing. Read the reviews and ordered up 2 sizes to allow for it running small. I ordered a 2xl and received just xl. It fits snugly and will work for the occasion. I
3.0,Very nice design but cheap quality material
3.0,Smaller than expected but it works
3.0,Not super flattering on for me. Falls in a weird way. The lace on the shoulders is a little much. Good material though!
3.0,Very nice cute but small I love them 😍
3.0,Ordered a large and was way small
3.0,"I would call these thick tights,  NOT leggings"
3.0,"its cute, the clasp is a pain, not easy to put on.It would be nice to have something easier to work with when putting this one."
3.0,Bit thin fabric
3.0,Shirt was just OK
3.0,There is a seam down the middle front and no seam on the back. Should’ve reversed that.
3.0,Product is fine. Expected 2 pairs
3.0,"Ok materials, looks cheap"
3.0,The ballcap has a huge fish on the side. Husband did not see that in the pics. He still loves the cap but uses a sharpie to color out the fish
3.0,"Demasiado grande, compre talla S y parece talla L"
3.0,Gave this a 3 because not true to size but so darn cute. Would have given 5 stars if the correct size. I have 0g and what was sent would fall right out. I love the kitty design an really wanted them but had to return. So sad.
3.0,Not long enough in torso!!  Comfortable!!!
3.0,The necklace is beautiful but the clasp was broken and I had to replace it.  Once said and done I wear it constantly
3.0,Some of them broke within a week.
3.0,It's very simple
3.0,Very comfortable and the Khaki color is a nice olive/army green.  But be aware that the New Midnight band is black.  You only see the blue color on the part that you fold over to secure the band.
3.0,the earrings are somewhat heavy and they look comperatively cheap( to be expected with such low price)
3.0,Cut very large for a juniors..I got a large as I am 5'2 140lbs/38c..it was loose and very short waisted/returned it although print is cute
3.0,WAY TOO small. Had to give it to my wife. Fits her perfect.
3.0,"I personally did not like how think it is. Way way thin...but the actual cut of this blouse is very flattering. It just clings so much it shows every single roll , curve, bra texture and all."
3.0,I bought this hat cause my daughter loves unicorns. Great design but the hat runs small. My daughter is 4 1/2 and the hat wasn't deep enough to sit correctly on her head.
3.0,Because of the leather
3.0,"This dress didn't work for me. The color, lace, and bodice were beautiful, but I found that I did not like the way the slip was much shorter than the hem of the dress. Also, the slip tended to ride up in the back when walking so I returned it."
3.0,they are too big for me.
3.0,"Mostly good, but felt like B quality yarn.."
3.0,I wish they had the nose wire on the top
3.0,They shrink so if you have a size 10 or above foot. They will disappear in your shoe. Fantastic colors .
3.0,"The “Stainless” steal has a non-stainless portion inside the rubber which rusted on my band, causing a rash on my wrist.<br />The band doesn’t fill the section of the watch where it mounts as the photo-shopped pictures suggest in the description on the add.<br />Not quite the quality of the Apple Watch Nike band. Two thumbs down."
3.0,very tight on ankle and i am a small woman size six shoe and very small ankles
3.0,rode up my crotch
3.0,Perfect gift at low cost!
3.0,The shoes gave my daughter blisters
3.0,it's nice just not for me
3.0,"Seem like great quality but the skid-proof stuff quickly started breaking even though I've been careful not to over-stretch the material or put into shoes, etcetera. It started happening on some before I even washed them for the first time! I do like them overall because they are very thick and I like them to walk around in our tile floors (I'm young but I have a spine injury and can slip easily)."
3.0,These slippers were a little flimsier than I expected.  Would like a bit thicker sole.
3.0,"Comfortable, great price, quick delivery.<br />I ordered the size i needed based upon the website size chart. I had to send back and reorder a larger size."
3.0,"I absolutely loved this necklace at first. It is delicate and subtle, and exactly what I wanted. However, it tarnished REALLY fast, and I also discovered that the seahorse is really bendable. I'm a little concerned about how well it'll hold up over time, and I'm not thrilled about having to clean it frequently in order to keep it looking nice."
3.0,The prongs are to long and the jewel piece sits very low.i got a lot of compliments on this ring but I felt it was cheaply made.
3.0,"These are sized much different than the black pair I bought first.<br />I received the black ones and they fit wonderfully!<br />So I ordered the navy and maroon shorts and I can't get them past my thighs:(<br />Loved the black ones, super disappointed in the other colors."
3.0,"I like them enough to wear them, but the sizes are a bit off; I use the International Shoe Size Conversion chart recomended by Propet because those are the best fitting shoes I own. I wear a size 8 4E/5E(I have very wide feet) in womens and according to their size chart I should get a Large but when the shoes came in today they were way too big. The material is also very thin, as I said the shoes are a size too big and when I put them on they are not stretched very much but I can see through them enough to see the details of my toes. They come with an insole but unless you're going to be walking around in these a lot out of water or sand I would take them out, they don't provide that much support and it's just feels odd in a shoe like this, plus I found that I slide around inside the shoe less without the insole. It came in a plastic zipper storage bag. I provided photos of everything that came with the product.<br /><br />*UPDATE* This is the same review I applied the the pair I bought previously, this time I ordered a size smaller and they fit perfectly. I ordered a Large before and this time I ordered the Medium.<br /><br />If it weren't for all the reviews saying to size up I probably would have gotten the correct size, I got a L but a M would have fit perfectly, but these stretch so much that I could probably get away with squeezing into a S if I had to. I have very wide feet but the width of the soles don't matter to me that much in this instance as I will mostly be using these in the water just to protect the bottom of my feet and keep from falling on slippery surfaces."
3.0,Came broken but would of been nice if it wasn’t.
3.0,Very thin. Needed to purchase a slip to wear in public.
3.0,Pretty ring but the same gem fell out twice in the same spots in two different rings. They’re good about holding to their word with the warranty. This is my third ring that I’ve gotten from them in two months. Hoping the third peridot doesn’t fall out again.
3.0,Kinda cheap but comfortable
3.0,my boobs look funny
3.0,They were either way to big or way to small. They only fit my 7 year old (Not my 9 and 4). I would have returned but missed the window by the time we used them.
3.0,"The masks are thick and comfortable for the most part. However, the metal nose piece is not placed in the same position on all 3 masks. One is too low and one is not centered -- can be a bit annoying. I would suggest some better quality control in manufacturing."
3.0,"I like this dress a lot. It's super cute and I wanted to love it, but when I put it on I realized it is not form fitting whatsoever. Pair it with a plain black belt and it would look great! However without some type of belt it looks like either a slip or a nightie. The material is nice and silky and it feels amazing on my skin, but until I can find a proper belt to wrap around it, then it's basically pointless for me to wear it. It sorta makes me look like I'm wearing a babydoll dress or a maternity dress, I'm very short and have a large bust, so it's hard to find dresses that fit well and don't make me look pregnant."
3.0,Smaller than expected and slow shipping
3.0,The product is okay but do not the liquid touch your suede or nubuck shoes directly it will wipe the paint right off just like bleach
3.0,"This looks like a much more expensive bag.  The design is great (I use the front compartment for receipts, the middle for mini wallet, lipstick, mints, house keys and the rear compartment for my iPhone 8+.  There is also an interior zipper compartment in the rear that I use for my keyless car key to keep it safe.  The nylon fabric is super and the gold zippers are bold and great looking.  The ONLY problem is the zippers break.  They start doing that opening-from-the-middle thing.  I used to be able to ""gentle"" it closed but now it's completely open."
3.0,"Very soft and nice fabric. I hate that the waist band isn’t wide. I thought it was wider than it is. It digs in to mine. If I had a flat stomach it may not be a problem, but I do not. So there’s that"
3.0,Nice looking cap however it does not stay in place. I do not sleep rough but the cap still slides off.
3.0,The product fits my child around the waist but is a little loose at the top
3.0,Color is so much more brighter than expected. The fabric is okay and the only thing I like is the length since I'm 5'7&#34;.
3.0,Good looking but print is only on one side and the fabric is not warm
3.0,"Brand new, these socks are wonderful. However, following a hand washing, these socks really lost it. They no longer provide support."
3.0,"Lol, there wasn’t a hole in the button hole on these. Took a seam ripper but def didn’t pass QA! Works for a costume tho!"
3.0,Just falls out phone
3.0,"Very minimal decrease of my glasses fogging up, found myself not bothering with it most of the time"
3.0,This piece is beautiful in design. But it is not as substantial as I thought. It is rather flimsy and will bend easily.
3.0,These pants are extremely comfortable and very soft. I just wish they weren’t so sheer and see through.
3.0,The material is very thin. Not worth the money. The color is accurate and the look of the dress from the picture. Except when you receive the product it feels nothing like you would expect. Just seemed cheaply made
3.0,size of garment way smaller than tag states it is.
3.0,Too small and r see thru
3.0,"As advertised it's very small, however you will be surprised how much it can hold. Nice leather and seems like it has a strong zipper but time will tell. I wish that the zipper went around the entire wallet allowing you to open it up completely which would certainly give you easier access to your items. This design makes it difficult to pull your cards out especially if you pack it full like I do.  This &#34;wallet&#34; is basically a small &#34;credit card sized&#34; pouch, nothing more. However, I like it because it is exactly what I was looking for. The real negative that led me to rate it only three stars is that I personally feel that this &#34;wallet&#34; is way over priced for what it is."
3.0,"Disappointed, this was shorter than expected and then shrunk after the first wash."
3.0,"I ordered these because they were listed as 20g, unfortunately the earrings I received are a 16g. It isn't worth the hassle of return and my spouse wears 16g so they'll get used, just beware if ordering these that the gauge was wrong when I ordered."
3.0,good wallet fell apart at the corners
3.0,"Looks good, but quite heavy, instructions almost impossible to read, and some of the functions of watch difficult to get to and difficult to read."
3.0,Fit awkward and the material wasn't what I expected.
3.0,I'm a true medium and this was soooo big.  I would go down a size.  It wasn't very flattering so I will be sending back.
3.0,Fits in pocket nicely and will protect your ears
3.0,Really not what I expected.  Very thin don’t really think the will be that warm.
3.0,"This sweater is okay, it keeps you warm but is a very casual sweatshirt dress. Unfortunately I couldn’t wear it as shown in the picture since it’s very short and  I had to put on leggings with it. The quality of the material is pretty good and it’s made well. It also fits a little tight and doesn’t have much stretch."
3.0,"This bathrobe and doll robe came ball up in a plastic bag.  It looked slightly dirty.  Wasn’t happy with the appearance at all.  Granddaughter birthday next week , so I am going to wash it.  Wasn’t happy at all."
3.0,"Bought this Olaf suit for a dance studio production of Frozen. I was disappointed that it has two fans and only came with one battery pack. Had to buy another one to get it to partially blow up. We finally figured out that to get the suit to fully inflate, you had to remove the orange nose. It’s too heavy and pulls the entire head down making it impossible to see. The suit looks great on when you have 2 blowers and 2 battery packs and no nose is on. In the process of making my own felt nose to replace what was given."
3.0,Love this back pack but beware the inside is bright red and white stripes
3.0,I did not like the pants they were a different type of fabric than the jacket and the size range was different
3.0,"I actually really like this jacket, it’s very warm, the quality is okay and it’s cute.  It is, however, too small.  I ordered a size larger and it still doesn’t zip and button.<br />Not returning because I’ve been losing weight so it will fit next winter!  Worth $15, get 2-3 sizes larger."
3.0,"I wish it was a little longer. And, I think the fabric will pill, but we'll see. Love the pockets!"""
3.0,"The material is very thin, more suitable as pjs. The joggers I get from Walmart are much thicker. I wear a size 14 in pants and got the XL, they are a lil tight on the stomach and a tad bit long since I’m short, but they fit nicely everywhere else. Over all they are ok, just wasn’t expecting them to be so thin."
3.0,The pants fit and feel great but the hoodie is a little tighter than expected.
3.0,"It's a nice shirt, it's just too short. I'm a small in women's clothing, but since this was in Chinese sizes, I went up to Medium but that was way to short. guess i should've gone with the large"
3.0,Shirt is super cute but runs big
3.0,Too hard
3.0,I loved it until I washed it.  It just didn't wash nicely and I didn't even put it in the dryer.  Won't be buying another.
3.0,Gold sections came chipped and smudged.
3.0,"look good and are very warm, a little short and I ordered a half size bigger."
3.0,"The color is more of a coral than pink. Also, this bra is very tight. Make sure to order a size up if you choose this one"
3.0,"I like the mask and the tails the details, but somehow when i put it on it hurts my eyes, it rub against my eyes, normally it has a space between eyes and mask, so i need to return it, i tried to wear it but i couldnt open my eyes, and i have a normal head size, too bad coz the mask is beautiful"
3.0,"Not sure how to rate this, I guess I need help or a suggestion on how to fix the image. I've made two of them and they both have a flaw."
3.0,"A very pretty dress, nicely made with good quality material.  This is not made for American women with curves so size up 2 sizes ladies."
3.0,"The shirts are sheer and about a size too small. The colors are beautiful. The chest is tight, and I have a smaller chest. I went with the sizing that was recommended by the websites chart."
3.0,Nice patterned fabric but is very hot. Nothing  fresh to do exercises maybe for winter
3.0,toooooooo narrow
3.0,The compression around the arches was so snug on a few of these that o couldn’t get them on my foot! And I have a narrow foot! About half worked/fit
3.0,A little ro small
3.0,I liked the stretch and feel of these but.....the straps have absolutely NO support...they stretch out in an hour and keep going ....
3.0,"Got 2 of these to husband for Xmas. Nice and soft, but when he sat down, waist pulled down. There wasn't enough length in the seat. Has never had this problem before so something is off with the cut. Back they go."
3.0,"The material reminds me of a workout clothes. I ordered a medium and it’s super big on me, I would suggest to size down. It’s not exactly what I was expecting but it’s comfy to lounge around in with leggings."
3.0,"I got it on time, which is great, but the durability was ok. Over time, it started to bend, and the lens would occasionally. Over all, i think it goes well with outfits."
3.0,"I love the size and backing on these earrings but the ones I received have bubbles on the surface. It’s honestly not enough to go through the hassle of returning them, but it’s still frustrating that they didn’t care enough to check the quality of the item before it was prepped to go out for sale. I get that they are only $13 but dang. I’ll wear them, but wouldn’t purchase from this shop again or recommend them to other buyers if this is the quality of item they think is acceptable to send out."
3.0,Too Big. Had to return them.
3.0,"I bought these for using around the hot tub.  The ones I got was WAY too big but they were also uncomfortable so I sent them back.  If you buy, buy small."
3.0,Aren’t the greatest quality and didn’t last long
3.0,"I would have liked a different chain, but overall.. it is a very inexpensive necklace that my daughter is going to love"
3.0,These are very useful and there is a large variety. I did find some of the clasps were very hard to open. These are worth the price but know that a few might be harder to open.
3.0,very pretty but sizing is off.  runs small.
3.0,Lots of fun.  The kids enjoy them.  A few came that did not work.  Some were brighter than others. Overall good for the price.
3.0,I loved these when I got them. They feel great and they are very flattering. Unfortunately they already have a hole in the back at the waist after just one wash. 😔
3.0,I got this for my son who was born at 36 weeks. He was 5 pounds 11 oz. the hat is a little big and the pants for some reason like to slip and bring the diaper with. We didn’t keep rewearing this outfit because of that but it was sooo cute as a going home outfit.
3.0,Adorable print and soft fabric but the fit is way too big. Order a size down
3.0,Not visible in daylight
3.0,All of them run really small but we had no time to reorder
3.0,"I did not care for how this hat fit. It's not slouchy at all. It was more fitted than anything.<br />I didn't believe I had a big head until I bought this hat. I can place it on my head and there is no extra slouch behind my head from the fabric. It's fitted more than anything. I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a true slouchy hat. With that being said, I can wear this with a ponytail and it isn't entirely awkward but it does not fit as though what I thought a true slouchy hat should fit.<br /><br />The fabric is nice, though. I like the material and the color. The hat is warm in the winter. I just wish it was much bigger in the slouch part than what it is. I use this hat almost the entire winter as it did fit and I could wear it with a pony tail. It served it's purpose to keep my head warm. I just didn't care for how it fit me. Cute hat nonetheless, though. Just not what I wanted."
3.0,"This is a gift for a friend...she loves unicorns and the price was right.  However, the chain is ugly...does not look nice at all and looks worn and almost rusted.  Not sure I would recommend this product."
3.0,"These would be great for the transition back into the workplace as they walk the line between slacks and joggers. However, they are thick material, and I live in the desert. Also the belt could be longer as there’s no way it can make the bow as displayed. Also, I have a short torso and long legs, so the crotch sagged oddly. Had to return."
3.0,"I am used to the quality of Dakine bags so I was a little disappointed with quality of dress. Cute as a beach cover up, and will work fine for a younger women as dress."
3.0,"It’s short on me, hoping a size larger would fit better"
3.0,"I LOVE the way these pants fit. They lift and define in every way you want. I’m super stoked that they seemingly aren’t see through whilst in movement.<br />Sadly, they arrived with a pull in the threads on the thigh and already a small hole in the crotch around the reinforced area of fabric. Also, you can tell by the way the fabric pulls, thin and see through, in the crotch that this material won’t last long (future holes) especially during activities like squatting.<br />So it’s not a matter of being transparent but that the material won’t last long along the seam line regarding holes.<br />I’m 5’6, 130lb, with a fairly lean athletic build; I purchased a small. I don’t attribute my physique to these conditions stated above, this is purely due to quality<br />I’d intended on buying another pair until I realized this to be case."
3.0,"Very big size ; wobbly,falling of the head and very hard"
3.0,Fits smaller than other items I have if the same size.
3.0,Is really big and heavy
3.0,This is a great cover up I just wish it was shorter. It goes to my knees but will still use it because it’s cute
3.0,Weighted and definitely not for people with allergies. It's not color accurate but it still comes in clutch for last minute costume parties.  Had to  return cause I was allergic.<br />Edit: Realized south Asians and east Asian might take offense  to it because of Japan's past. You  might not  want to buy this so no one gets  offended
3.0,"I bought these to wear as a base for skiing. They are no warmer than any other flocked legging.<br />Plus they are quite long. I'm 5'3&#34; and these were ok for wearing around, but too long for skiing as they would bunch up around the ankles and felt weird in my ski boots."
3.0,XL. On this blouse looks like a small size.
3.0,it ok  chain is nice
3.0,"No support whatsoever. Fit runs large but even after ordering smaller size, there was zero support. If shoulder straps could be adjusted I think it would help."
3.0,"Way to heavy, not nice as closer look."
3.0,The rings stretch out but they're so cheap that I don't mind buying more.
3.0,It's cute but top is too big and bottoms too small. So no &#34;fine in between&#34;
3.0,Good for small chested woman or little girls
3.0,It's cute but runs small very tight
3.0,"As I've seen in a previous review, I too had one shoe noticeably smaller than the other by width. Not enough for me to return but enough to disappoint! It would be in the sellers best interest to address this issue as it is a duplicate flaw. All around I think the shoes are great! Seems there are two different production lines making the right & left shoes.....no uniformity?"
3.0,"I’ve only had a few weeks and the material is pulling away from the rubber/sole on the toe area, at the seam.  You can see in the pic how the seam is opening and causing the gap/hole between material and rubber"
3.0,My Girlfriend likes the style and the color of it. it goes with almost all the tops she owns. She looks really cuts in it
3.0,These are cute and we'll made but my hubby needed 2 sizes bigger than he would normally order
3.0,- Not included in our order:<br />FREE WHITE BELT w/ STRIPE BAR – Our lightweight men’s BJJ kimono is complemented with a free white belt for beginners which is made of the same cotton as the GI. The free while belt also has a stripe bar that will allow you to earn your stripes and show them with pride displaying your progress as you climb up the levels.
3.0,The material is cheap but the style is cute!
3.0,"Sent back, very cute but too big for my ears."
3.0,I love the top and the look of the suit.  I am disappointed that the bottoms only have a lining on the front part of the pants.  Don't really understand that.
3.0,It's nice. But not what I expected in material I guess. The cost for the blouse is expensive for the quality. Quality isn't bad just isn't top noch.
3.0,"I am 5'7"" 205 pounds and ordered the xl in wine red.  The dress fit great,  but only giving 3 stars because the color looks faded new out of the package like it has been washed 20 times."
3.0,Liked but was yo small. Had to order bigger size.
3.0,I love the print and sweet little ears on the hood. It is so warm and soft but I noticed after my son wore it a couple times that there's a few rips/tears in it. I'm not sure how they happened but the Fabric seems to tear easily.
3.0,"I think this is a cute shirt. It doesn't scream holiday, but it's a holiday shirt. The lettering is good and is securely on the shirt. The shirt is a heavier weight one than I expected and seems to be a good quality. The sizing however, runs very small. I'm a size 16/18. I can usually get by with XL, but from my experience, I decided to go with the 2XL. I couldn't even get this shirt on."
3.0,"They were to big for my head.  They would not stay up over my nose.  The fabric and colors were beautiful.  I washed And dried one to see if it would shrink, but it did not.  I put a color catcher in the wash with it, and it did not bleed any dye.  I mailed them back and received full refund."
3.0,Overpriced. Check up Dee Mum knee high socks.
3.0,It has a small opening at the bottom that would allow small objects to fall out
3.0,The bag is very pretty but came out of the package with one of the “ball closures” missing.  Too close to wedding to send it back.  Looks good but poor quality.
3.0,Great logo & decal.  Not expecting this to last.  Cheap material.
3.0,A STONE FELL OFF IT WAS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK
3.0,I thought it was oversized and bought a small and it’s a bit tight I would’ve gone up a size had I known
3.0,"Products warm, must watch tho. Wore them two weeks and bottom was separating from material."
3.0,Cute but just a tad heavy
3.0,The fit was good but the ring point is longer than pictured. Its an odd fit. The point passes my knuckle and if curl my fingers it stands up. Might do better to be marketed as a self different ring but it might hurt you more than them.
3.0,"The shoes are real looking and the footbed is comfortable, but the straps that go across he toe/foot are too wide and don’t offer support / stability when walking. Disappointed that I had to turn them."
3.0,Gets tangled
3.0,Ok and as expected but the blue marbles ran as the dye leaked out onto the plastic stretch cord. Not sure how much they will fade in the coming months
3.0,"this bathing suit is super cute, but it was too small. when you order this i would size up a couple."
3.0,"Size ok, look ok ,cheap material"
3.0,"Be advised...the shimmer style suits run a little smaller and will not stretch like the fabric styles. If you choose the shimmery large, it will be a too small. Don't know if going xl will be the fix, that size is unavailable currently."
3.0,Really hard to get on my daughters foot runs a bit small
3.0,It seems as if the company changed the quality of their masks. This set is much thinner than the first two I purchased. Slightly disappointed and won't be buying my next set from them.
3.0,Its a little thin.
3.0,"Fabric has no give, arms were tight"
3.0,"I enjoy bracelets as an accessory to my wardrobe. It was nice to find a bulk deal on bracelets. Although these items are cute, I didn't find that they last very long. I may be tough on jewelry however. A lot of these felt lightweight and delicate. They were pretty, fashionable, and did serve their purpose. I just wish they would have lasted a bit longer and been better quality for me."
3.0,"Super lightning fast delivery!  Ordered for my daughter, she wears a small in junior sizes, I purchased the large, based on reviews saying it ran small. Surprisingly it fit and still loose enough for additional layers.  Material is very smooth, green is a bit darker than in pics, the arm length was just right, she's 5'5&#34;.  Very light, appropriate for Spring.<br />Loose threads, no zipper."
3.0,The material is thicker then expected and it fits a lot larger then what shows in the picture.  I ordered my usual size a US M.  Ordered 2 and tried to cancel the other but it shipped.  I keeping this one only because maybe in 10 years I will gain enough weight to fit into it on a very cold winter day.
3.0,"I have several pairs of Hold Up suspenders. The undergarment ones are the only ones I have had any problem with.At the point where they are sewn together where they cross in the back. is flimsy. It comes apart over time. Also, they are so loosely elasticized, that they must be adjusted more frequently than the other suspenders in their product line.<br />I have tried using their regular suspenders in place of the undergarment suspenders, but the leather crossover directly against my skin irritated my back. I have written to them regarding the flimsy sewing at the crossover point several times, but I never heard back from them. They handle shipping issues very well, but they seem to suffer from the &#34;we've got the market sewn up&#34; syndrome&#34; when it comes to customer concerns with product quality and design. They just don't seem to care."
3.0,"This either runs small or my head is big... Aside from that, this hat definitely has a presence!"
3.0,"Was to small for me,can't were it"
3.0,"I got the rose gold set, the coloring fades/rubs off quicker than I anticipated. However, I can make each piece last 4-6 months before my skin starts reacting badly to the metal underneath. I love how many there are! The gems last really well over time."
3.0,Had to stretch out
3.0,"I ordered a 4x, however, 4x was smaller than most. The length was almost waist length, instead of thigh length ( as picture shows)."
3.0,I like the way they are organized in individual size envelopes.
3.0,Bought for 4 year old to be like Daddy but rather big. He will grow into!
3.0,"The earrings are pretty, but the material is cheap. One of my earring stems aren't even fused evenly in the middle. Also, when I got the earrings in the mail, the earring stems were bent to the side. I had to bend them back upward so they could be worn."
3.0,Not what I expected but quickly resolved the issue to my satisfaction
3.0,A little smaller than expected but what can you expect from an item from online shopping? The lace immediately was ripped on one pair after one wear but the other two are fine. They serve their purpose of layering and fit my price point.
3.0,Looks yellow 😣
3.0,"Nice enough Wild Rag but NOT turquoise. I'll wear it but I bought it for a specific event, too dark so I just ordered from another vendor and paid $22.00 for overnight shipping."
3.0,"Super cute dress, however way too short. I am 5'9&#34;, and this was inappropriately short to wear anywhere. I ordered a small which fit perfect minus the length. I'd say if you were 5'5&#34; or shorter this would be adorable."
3.0,Tight and short . But soft
3.0,Be aware - the length will shrink quite a bit after washing.  Tried this on prior to washing and the length was perfect.  Washed it and they shrank about 2-3 inches.  Disappointed.
3.0,I didn’t read the whole description and was surprised to find that only the front of the pants have the tie dye pattern. The back is just black.
3.0,I know this is strange but it was a secret valentine gift and I realized the guy didn't know it was a bottle opener.
3.0,Top is not designed for women with medium to large breasts. Top keeps shifting while sleeping I might as well not wear any. Material was great feels wonderful.
3.0,Nice material but the black changes to grey once it stretches...
3.0,"My husband loves the fit and feel of Bioworld sock material and comfortably wears his Bioworld Zelda socks. However, he wears a size 13-wide shoe, so unfortunately, these socks didn't work out for him. Fortunately, our 7-year-old son wears a size 6, so these socks fit him perfectly. Our younger son wears a size 2 (also regular sizes, not ""kid/toddler"") and is able to comfortably wear them as oversized sleep socks. The designs on them are perfect for my Marvel-loving family, but unfortunately those same designs prevent the socks from stretching comfortably around an adult leg."
3.0,"I bought one pair and they fit just right and I loved them, so I bought another pair a size bigger and the whole sole fell off. I would have given them a 5 star if it wasnt for that. I was bummed that I had to send them back."
3.0,El tornillo se salio y porpoco pierdo el reloj
3.0,"It's a very pretty dress, but the material is a bit stiff and wrinkles very easily."
3.0,"Got what I paid for. Should've listened to reviews about quality. But, you get what you pay for. Looks nothing like leather. Looks like cheap pleather. But I will say that I do like the face guard."
3.0,"This is a nice comfortable sandal.  Sadly, the strap over the foot is flimsey so you cannot just slip your foot in and go.  You need to raise and steady the strap to successfully slip your foot in."
3.0,"Roomy and comfortable, but VERY thin!"
3.0,Sizing is off description<br /><br />Sizing don't go with the description.Returning and ordering probably two size up.<br />Because dress is very pretty
3.0,"My hubby said the material is wonderful but they do not hold all his stuff, if you know what I mean."
3.0,"The helmet has a shape which is not compatible with that of my head. Otherwise, it seems like a decent helmet for the price. Due to poor fit I am returning the item."
3.0,Super cute dress but it runs large. I’m 5’5 145lbs 34D and the large was too large
3.0,Not long enough for boots with 8 rows of eyelets.
3.0,Kind of bulky.  Doesn't look like any kind of cat. Looks more like a serpent.  Crystals are OK.  I didn't keep it--back it went.
3.0,"This peignoir set was very disappointing with regard to quality of materials and workmanship.  Simply put, it is extremely over-priced and should be priced at $40-50.  I was very much looking forward to receiving it and was really disappointed when it arrived."
3.0,Successfully got them on once. Kids this small it’s hard to get their tiny hands in these. Save your money. Buy the cheap dollar store ones that have the fingers and are fuzzy
3.0,"Made out of good quality material and made well. It's very cute but runs extremely small. Not made for curvy shapes. It is stretchy, but unflattering when tight. So bummed!"
3.0,"Kinda cheap, fits ok good value for once a year wear"
3.0,"It says these are boys, but they are not.  They are well made, but they did not fit my 9 year old...they fit my 45 year-old husband."
3.0,I like the dress it’s too small. Deciding to return it to my huge surprise the seller is charging 45.00 to ship it back. Now I’m stuck with a dress I paid for and can’t ware. Beware of this seller!!
3.0,The belt is pretty but I am a size 10-12 and it was tight so I gave it to my daughter who is a size 1 and she loves it.
3.0,"Really like the necklace which is great quality, but the wheel should have been larger so you can see it better when worn."
3.0,Does not fit face well. Sucks in with breath.
3.0,"This was such a cute bathing suit. I'm 5'8 & 132 lbs. cup size is 36DD. The XL top is waaaaay too small. & the bottoms were waaaaay too small. I would have just bought bottoms in the smaller size but if the XL won't cover by breasts, there's no winning for me."
3.0,"Material is scratchy, not a nice soft linen I was hoping for. Looks like the pictures but runs large."
3.0,"The stones were bigger than expected and the post longer. Too long of a post and too big of stone for a tragus. Post is great for outer ear cartilage, my ear is on the small side so the stone also looks too big for those on me."
3.0,Ordered 3x fit like large. Don't buy if you have a tummy.
3.0,"Its a nice pendant, worth what I paid. Gave to friend to hang off her car mirror. It's pewter, and that's exactly what it looks like."
3.0,Can’t dry them in dryer.  Would not have ordered if I had known that.
3.0,Material is a little cheap but for the price it was definitely worth it.
3.0,"This skirt is very cute and will look great with Mary Jane style heels and a button up shirt.  It fits well, but is a little too long for me.  I am 5'8 and it comes almost to my ankles.  It is mid-calf in the picture.  Not sure how shorter girls will be able to wear it without rolling the top.  I plan on rolling it to be mid-calf and it looks way better at that length.  The waistband is not sewn as well as it could be, but otherwise the construction is good."
3.0,Was disappointed with the heart..you get what you payfor and for the price it wasnt bad
3.0,"a lot of loose thread around the color, makes it look cheap.<br />nice material, very thin though. Cute design, i just wish there was more care in it."
3.0,Would not buy again.  The top fit as expected but the bottom was very tight.  I even ordered a size up!
3.0,"It’s cute but the large fits like and extra large and bell hangs, one size smaller would be better"
3.0,"It is very thin, but I do like it.  The color is what it shows, the fit a bit too revealing of my body imperfections, but it is easily corrected with a slip"
3.0,"Super cool jacket, tried it on after it came and it fit a little small but then I made a mistake of washing and drying before first use and it shrank ALOT! Maybe hang dry if you buy. Runs small in my case."
3.0,"Fabric is wonderful! Cut is interesting, although not a great fit for me. There was so much pulling after only two wears! Just ok for me."
3.0,"Definitely only a cosplay bathing suit! The bottoms are super thin, but not thin enough that you can really see through them. The top straps are pretty thin feeling as well. I would definitely not swim in them but cute for cosplay!"
3.0,It is too small for many adults unless you like the hat to be really snug. But the quality of the hat looks good.
3.0,"Did not realize how heavy this watch is.  Also, the clasp on the SS model is very hard to open and close.  Seems cheaply made band compared to the regular inox band."
3.0,Did not cover my head and I would say I have an average size. That being said there is no space to tuck hair out of sight. Descent design and fabric just wish it were larger.
3.0,"While I loved this when I got it, sadly, it did not hold up :( the tie at the end of the string came undone and all of my beads fell to the floor bouncing everywhere! I thought about having it sent back but we couldn't find the blue and red beads and I had to just let it go. Hopefully one I purchase in the future will last a little longer. I did get many compliments on it and asked where I got it from! That was a plus!"
3.0,It wasn't just small it was a weird cut and tight in awkward spots that wouldn't be tight if you just bought a regular shirt that was too small
3.0,Loved the top but the tummy area did nothing to help my 3 C-section pooch. Material seemed a little thin so I was also questioning how it would hold up when wet!
3.0,"This dress is a thin woven fabric similar to cotton quilting fabric, which would be nice in the summer, but is extremely easy to wrinkle. The bust and arm holes are snug so if you are blessed up top, this will not be for you. If you do order, get a size up."
3.0,"While the elastic waistband is helpful and the gathered high waist is cute, they are much shorter than anticipated and there is no way I can bend over in these.  Also, I have a small waist and a big round bum and these shorts were probably made with a straight up-and-down pattern...not taking into consideration a woman's form.  Best for petite women (I am 5'9"") with a boyish figure."
3.0,"These pajamas were comfortable enough and they fit better than I thought they would, but they are very wrinkled w/o pressing.  The gray color makes them look like prison garb.  I would not buy them again."
3.0,I was minding my own business when my 4 y/o pointed out that my undies have butterflies coz she could see them through the pants. And to think i had ran errands without a care in the world.. oh well.
3.0,For smaller heads. I wear 7 5/8 fitted cap. Causes pressure points behind ears. About 20% block of Blue Light by my estimate.
3.0,I received this item at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.<br /><br />I found this shirt to fit a little snug.  I bought it the correct size according to the chart. Also its a completely different material than I was expecting.  Its a thick stretchy material similar to exercise shirts.  The neck is also a lot higher than depicted.  With they being said its still a cute shirt.  The design is cute and was placed on the shirt nicely.
3.0,"When I opened the earrings, there were several pair that did not have the clear/metal backs either them. Some did but majority did not. For the price I paid, I am not going to rate them poorly. Most of them are great for a fun statement earring!"
3.0,"I was really excited to get this sweater but it’s just way too big. I got a small, and I read it was oversized, but I didn’t expect to me drowning in it. I look like a child wearing her parents sweater."
3.0,Earrings look smaller than the picture
3.0,Runs small and clingy. Order a size up.
3.0,"The pendant arrived quickly, but was not as advertised. The center heart is not Amethyst, but Fluorite. The green stones were not all green onyx either, but dyed Chalcedony & Amazonite. I like the piece, so I did nothing about it in the way of returning it, & the cost was very fair for what I actually got. I just want others aware of the incorrect identification."
3.0,"I ordered this dress in April when I found out I was pregnant with the intention of growing into it throughout the summer (I keep my arms covered from the sun) but I don’t think that’s a possibility because the material of this dress is THICK! I’d say it is definitely more suited for fall to winter. What irritated me the most was the sleeves are definitely not long, they MAY be 3/4 or less. They do not reach the wrist like pictured on the model. I really like the deep V and will hopefully allow easy access for breastfeeding."
3.0,This was adorable and seemed like it was well made. I have long dreads though and it wasn't able to hold all my hair in them so I returned the item.
3.0,Super cute but the size runs really big. Bought the 9 to 12 months and my daughter weasrs 12 months and it was so big she didn't end up wearing it. Really cute though.
3.0,Smaller than I thought they would come. And they’re abit fragile. But they will do for now.
3.0,Product did not fit!
3.0,There is NO support what so ever and it stretches out to much
3.0,"It's not as nice as it looks on the picture.  The material is too thin to hold the bow design, but it's OK."
3.0,These are EXTREMELY tight get 2-3 sizes up for comfort  fit
3.0,Comfortable but I won't  wear it outside the home
3.0,Beatiful but heavy.. i ll keep it and try to change for a pressure closing
3.0,Great denim skirt but smaller than they say.
3.0,"Not as glamorous as the picture, but OK."
3.0,Its a lightweight material. Doesn't keep me very warm. Stitching isn't great in spots. I just needed a light jacket that was in my size and this one is cool.
3.0,"While the design and fabric seem fine.  This runs extremely small, so beware.  I tend to wear a small or medium in most things.  This medium may fit a medium child.  I think i would have to buy the XL to have it fit correctly."
3.0,"Fairly uncomfortable, but last just as long as Carolinas"
3.0,"Disliked material, shape  and dingy looking pink color.  Appeared to be made of recycled material."
3.0,"I recommend that you get two to three sizes larger than what you normally wear. The page suggests that you get one size bigger, I usually wear a small & I ordered a medium.<br />I am 5'8 and 135 lb and my measurements are 34 "" 27 "" 41 "". I probably should have ordered an extra large.<br />I bought these to wear under my shirt at my landscaping job and they are constantly crawling up my hips."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:bfbe6dd8727f1c56fe783e365b806501]] Not as thick as I had hoped for the price. You can tell that in the short video and the hole, that was there as soon as I unpackaged it, that I mentioned as well. I am returning obviously."
3.0,They don't really stay up. Lame.
3.0,"Eh, this belt is okay. I was expecting more, but it will do."
3.0,"I got these for my son for his first year of track. The sole of the shoe started coming off in the first week, but considering the length of the season is so short, it didn't matter much to me."
3.0,I have a very large chest 36DDD and the XL I could even get around my chest.
3.0,"Hard to open, much more yellow than expected. Fits and works though."
3.0,Bought this shoes for my little boy but there were kind of heavy.
3.0,"This should actually be a 3.5 star but you can't give a half.  This pin is super cute and totally different from any I own, but I was surprised that the &#34;stones&#34; were not glass (or whatever they are usually made of...crystals?) but these are made of plastic.  If they are not plastic, they certainly look plastic.  They are not as shiny as I'd like, and a bit of the painting is a little sloppy but honestly it is still a really cute pin for a very good price.  I would buy this again if I lost this one, as the price is great and it's a different pin... just remember, you get what you pay for.  ;-)"
3.0,Don't waste your money. They are the most comfortable for the 10 minutes before you lose them. The first the little rubber backing will slide off then the earing will be gone.
3.0,"I expected the top part of the lens are clear, but they are not."
3.0,"got the blue one and it came as not blue at all, maybe aqua or teal but wayyyyy closer to green. i still like it but it looks nothing like the picture"
3.0,I like it but it is too large!!
3.0,Elastic around shoulder broke while wearing for the third time
3.0,Not for grown women.  The only reason I'm keeping them and giving them 3 stars is because it was a sale and I have a niece that these would actually fit.
3.0,The middle dangle fell off about a month after purchasing. Other than that it's amazing. Even with the middle one gone it still looks fine.
3.0,"I needed this shade of purple to wear with my dark purple workout pants. Not wonderful, but it works."
3.0,"I usually wear larges in bottoms, but this was a little too small. It came as a different color than pictured too. It worked as my grinch outfit though."
3.0,"Great size, nice inside. Outside is shiny instead of having a better faux leather texture. But for the price, you can't beat it I guess."
3.0,"Multiple loose threads, so it looks poorly made. Having a hard time finding a way to contact the seller."
3.0,Not as nice as the pictures but it ok.
3.0,"These ties are rather inexpensive looking, but they serve the purpose for which I wanted them.  The print on the ties are very cute.  I am using them as a gift to go along with a monetary gift for high school seniors.  One is hoping for a scholarship in golfing and one in flying.  The golf ball print was cute and could even be dressy, as well as the tie with airplanes printed on it."
3.0,"I needed to wear this for a performance and haven't worn it since.  It's just not my style.  It fit and it looks as advertised, though,"
3.0,"They're ok replacements if your original lenses are scratched, but they are definitely not built to the same optical standards as your Oakley lenses. These installed pretty easily and fit nicely in the frame, but they both have optical defects. One is slight, the other is much more noticeable, both in the form of horizontal warps across the entirety of the field of view. For most applications, this isn't a huge issue, but when driving or biking it can be a little distracting or disorienting."
3.0,Very shiny and see through.  I ordered larger than normal based on reviews.  I was swimming in it.
3.0,"Fabric. Seems to be a common complaint. The style is cute. The fit is fine. But the fabric is harsh and scratchy. Especially around the arms and seams.<br /><br />There is no stretch, and it isn’t soft.  I would wear this often but I can’t make it more than 10-20 minutes without taking it off out of discomfort."
3.0,"Too small top, regardless of your size, and the pants legs are way too big"
3.0,"These feel like a rubber band on your finger! Water and air get trapped under them and your skin under the band gets all pruned! If you work with water, sweat, or in a high moisture area this is not the band."
3.0,Much larger than I expected. Color is good and seems to be well made.
3.0,"This dress is nicer than I expected. The material is very stretchy, the color is matte and nothing unusual. The fit is flattering, however I'd recommend for larger chested ladies to size up and/or pin the top if necessary. I like the sleeve length, as well as where the hem falls as it's not too short (I'm 5'9""). Great ""little black dress"" to have in the closet to grab for a night out or event."
3.0,"This dress looks lovely, and I receive a lot of compliments when I wear it. But the material is your basic quilting material, which has no stretch to it whatsoever, and is not really meant for clothing. The design is printed onto the fabric. It is not lined, so it feels slightly thin and cheap, especially around the collar. But I've washed it twice, and the print is still looking nice!"
3.0,"Tight, very tight can't wear them"
3.0,"This is one of those horribly disappointing purchases where quality and sizing are opposite! The sizing is way off! The strings that go around you may match the size chart, but the depth of the cups do not. A size large (what I ordered even though in usa sizes I am a medium) leaves most of my breasts hanging out. Each triangle may be 4 inches wide, but once you account for filling them you are looking at more like 2-3 inches wide.<br /><br />The bottoms are perfect width in the front, but since the back of the bottoms is the same width as the front of the bottoms, if you have any backside you will be turning these into thongs real quick! I walked about 4 steps before both of my cheeks were hanging out!<br /><br />What adds a bit of insult to injury is the shorts. They fit PERFECT! They are actually so adorable.<br /><br />The quality of the material is great, but if you are well endowed on any part of your body the size chart will not work for you."
3.0,"Meh. You get what you pay for. The elastic bands aren’t great. I’d stick with name brands, less in the pack but more comfortable."
3.0,"Nice concept.  The automatic open button doesn't work like regular umbrella.  It unlatches the umbrella, but it still requires that it be opened manually.  I  returned one for this same reason and ordered another.  Guess that's just the design."
3.0,Just too small for me. Sorry.
3.0,"Super cute, appear to be made well. However, they do not fit my Costa glasses.  (Loretto) they have the slightly thicker sides.  I tried my cheap aviator, I was able to squeeze those in. But were uncomfortable.  Contemplating a return."
3.0,Cute but the door comes open.  I'm almost afraid to wear it because if I don't pay attention I might lose my tracker
3.0,Much bigger than I wanted. Looks grey not black.
3.0,"I purchased this dress as a summer cover up for when I went to the beach. I got a medium because I am busty, but I could have definitely bought a small as there is ample room in the top and being 5'2"", there is about 3 inches of extra fabric at the bottom."
3.0,cute for a child
3.0,"Im US XS and it fit a little loose on the waist. I expected a better quality in the material, it wrinkles. I washed it twice, be sure to use softener and as for the letters are still fine.  I expected a softer and not wrinkable material as it seems in the picture as for the price. Although I wear it in my house often because is very comfy."
3.0,"The description says black. It is NOT black, its gray. So disappointed.  I'm so good about reading reviews and for some reason I didn't on this and wish I did because others complained about this too. Contacted the seller and never heard back. Will never give this seller my money again"
3.0,i do not like the color
3.0,"These are a bit of a mixed review - on one hand, they are well made and I like the high waist. On the other hand, I don't like the length and find the tummy control annoying...it actually seems to add bulk. The length of the legs is a bit too long for a capri length and a bit too short for anything else. Overall I'm not nearly as happy with these as hoped."
3.0,"My five year old daughter uses this purple clutch when she wants to play &quot;grown up&quot;.  The stitches along one of the zippers are already coming out.  She's had it less than six weeks and only uses it periodically.  I'm sure she fills it to the brim... but since she is only five she lacks the strength to zip it when it is overstuffed.  Therefore, she can't put much strain on the zipper/stitches, yet it is still falling apart.  She is a dainty girl who takes very good care of her belongings.  Very disappointed.  You will be too, especially if you are planning to use it on a frequent basis.<br /><br />UPDATE: Customer service sent me a new one, free of charge. I will see how it holds up and update my review in a few months."
3.0,"I would have rated 5 stars, except that there was not enough fabric in this shirt to accommodate a larger chest. The fit was nice everywhere else."
3.0,Cute pieces but a few have already broke so not happy about that
3.0,The top was a lot shorter in the front than I thought it would be. A bit large as well.
3.0,decent strapless bra
3.0,They were alittle tight but i think my footis just fat. Was shipped to me earlier than quoted.
3.0,"I didn’t like the way It fit, but very nice dress"
3.0,"very strange!! I ordered this belt earlier and it was just as the picture shows.  it was beautiful and fit reasonably well. I say reasonably because it could have been a tad more snug.  my waist is 25.  I would have given the first fit and the beauty of the first belt a 4.5 stars.  but here is what is strange.  I ordered a second belt because I misplaced my first one...or maybe my granddaughter borrowed it?  anyway, they sent me an altogether different belt!! it is a black velvet flower and it doesn't have the little filaments/stamens with the little beads which is thought was so unique!  the black velvet flower is very nice and I will keep it.  but it does bug me that when I order something someone else decides to give me what THEY want me to have!  I guess I better find the original one."
3.0,"I thought that the shirts would be a little roomier, slightly small, next time I will get a size large,"
3.0,"They were smaller than I thiught, but uality was good."
3.0,The metal itself is good. But the post is either too long for a rook piercing and too short for a belly button piercing. The spikes at the top are also very sharp.
3.0,Broke  within 1 week. Bummer.
3.0,"These undies are really cute looking, and fit really well, but aren't made too well. After just a couple of wears, they start unraveling at the seams- the lacey trim is sewn in flimsy and not secured. I was really happy with them at first, however, sadly it seems they won't last too long."
3.0,It's cheaply made but My Granddaughter thought it was cute to share with her mom.
3.0,"I like this item but did NOT have an hygienic shield on panty.  This is completely unacceptable.  As I don't have time to reorder, I will launder accordingly making sure to sanitize."
3.0,This is more of a heavy weight polyester tee. It fits narrow and small. I would say it is more of a women’s cut as I ordered a small and it fit my petite frame (5’4”) If you are ordering for a man or teen boys size up several sizes. Make sure to use the measurements and probably go up a size if you like hoodies roomie. Print looks blurred to me but colors are accurate. It has no fleece or fuzz on inside. This is more like a long sleeve tee made in the style of a hoodie. I am returning as it wasn’t what I hoped and the pattern wasn’t crisp enough for my taste.
3.0,"Maybe I just didn’t realize it when I read the description or my bifocals weren’t working the day I clicked “add to cart”, but the material of the black skirt is not matte as the pictures seem to indicate. This is a shiny material…like a swimsuit. It screams: “check out my rear!” Or shiny like a magician’s cape. Not the look I was going for (see below). May work for others, but I don’t need help attracting attention to my large derrière. It does fine on its own unfortunately.<br /><br />Now, as you might guess I’m a curvy gal. And near 50. So I was looking for a longer skort than what I would have rocked 20 years ago when I was much more tiny. No longer skort here. This thing is the same length as a cutesy one I found a few years ago. And one stroll across my living room had the shorts underneath creeping up my thighs like they were trying to get away from a flood. The seams cut weirdly across my hips and backside (accentuated by that shiny swimsuit material). But the flirty pleats in the back are adorable and, well, flirty.<br /><br />I’m sure if you don’t have thunder thighs like I do, this skort could work. Thick thighs yes…the shorts don’t cut in. But jiggly, thunderous, smooth-as-baby’s-bottom thighs…no. Maybe the size was off. Maybe I should have ordered an XL instead of a large. That will teach me to read reviews: one reviewer is the same size as me and recommended us size 12 gals get the large instead. It’s not uncomfy, mind you. But it’s eager to go on safari the second you walk around.<br /><br />For the price, it’s decent. But don’t expect a skort miracle. Thankfully, I ordered a different one from someplace else and it’s marvelous. Longer, doesn’t ride up, doesn’t cut in and show every bump and bubble on my butt (heh-heh…bubble butt…hey, I embrace my curvatures with humor). I’ll keep this weirdo. But only as something I wear at the lake (‘cause the fishes don’t care) or working around the house. The hassle of return isn’t worth it.<br /><br />But if you’re curvy in the right places, fit, or skinny  like I used to be, this skort is adorable."
3.0,Cute but the material itches like crazy for some reason. I barely wear it even though i love the look.
3.0,Like the colors and length but it is too small to fully wrap around from the waist down. I ordered the Large so that was a bit disappointing.
3.0,"Narrow sleeves and fabric is a bit thinner than expected, smooth texture but on the sheer side."
3.0,Not very thick.  I don't believe it is thick enough for ME in the snow.
3.0,This sock did not have enough cushion on the bottom. Too tight on ankle.
3.0,Smaller than I expected. Will serve their purpose just fine.
3.0,"Eastpak Mastermind is quite a sturdy knapsack.<br />I use it to carry items to and from work.  It does a great job<br />in holding my lunch, books, folded jacket, notebooks, keys..etc.<br />Most sacks I've had don't handle the weight that well, especially if you are a college student.  I have actually had a knapsack rip apart at the seems under the weight off all the text books I'm carrying.  Eastpak doesn't have that problem.<br />Also wearing an Eastpak on your back is quite gentle.  The straps and backing are foam, so it's easy on the back and shoulders.  The knapsacks material is also pretty water repellent.  I've gone through more than my share of being stuck in the middle of a torrential downpour, the outside of my knapsack is soaked, but the contest were bone dry.<br />My only negative comment about Eastpak is the no-slip straps.<br />They should be called &quot;always-slip&quot;.  I've threaded the straps every which way and they've always come undone under the most light weight carrying conditions.  I've ended up knotting the end of the strap so it doesn't slip through.  Really not astetically pleasing, but it got the job done.  My only real issue with this fine bag.<br />For the college student on the go, or for the white collar worker rushing to and from work, I believe Eastpak is a good buy with some minor reservations."
3.0,"I loved it, but for my event it was a little low, showing way too much cleavage.  I could fit into it but the back laces were really open. I had to return it."
3.0,These were smaller than expected.  More appropriate for a young child than my teenage granddaughter.
3.0,"I was looking for this type of shirt extender in cotton. It seems nearly impossible to find any more. This material is shiny and not stretchy. Not really what I was looking for. Since it’s all I could find, I kept it. Probably would not repurchase. I may have to just find and purchase extra long T-shirts."
3.0,My son loved them as part of his baseball uniform
3.0,i like this product that i ordered for my wife iike the leather well made but wife didnt liked because it was too small to strechy to open not enough space this would be good for somebody who has like 2 credit cards couple bills and 1 lipstick thats all no more space but is made of good leather reason for the 3 stars and i want my money refunded into credit card i dont want a gift card or anything like that because i read something that says your gift card is ion the way so just to make sure i keep very close eye on my purchases and refunds on my credit card ok thanks again
3.0,"I like the idea of the style, but the overhang down the front is not flattering if you're not trying to hide something.  I took it back."
3.0,"I wear size 00 pants and ordered size Medium for a perfect fit. However, the shorts need some lining as I get a camel toe. Also, the wide waistband rolls around in the casing when washed. They are &#34;just okay&#34;."
3.0,"Hat as described, fits, shield is good.  My issue is that UPS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO SHIP ANYTHING.  Due to arrive June 30th, came today after TWO redirects and the second redirect saying it was delivered at a location an hour away from where I live at a place of business.  I'm glad it wasn't breakable as box was MUTALATED!  Called UPS and got the run around then called Amazon and let them know about UPS nonsense.  They are working with me to resolve the issue."
3.0,"The bag is nice but for the price I paid I wish I wouldn't have bought it. The zipper and seams do not allow the bag to open as wide as it could, therefore it makes putting items in/taking them out annoying and a little difficult.<br /><br />The handles are also weird. They're too short. I don't usually use long straps on my bags but I tried the one that came with this one since the shorter ones were uncomfortable. But the strap is too long and I can't adjust it to go any shorter.<br /><br />Like I said, it seems of pretty decent quality but it's just not what I thought it would be and for $90 I could've gotten something much better suited for me. If the above mentioned could be issues for you too I would recommend to keep looking."
3.0,Ridiculously small but otherwise cute.
3.0,"This isn't bad, and I like the sliding ratchet belt design (when the one I had wore out, I went for a different one with the same design), but this one is a bit less flexible and bulkier than the one I had before. It's chunky, and for me at least, is a bit uncomfortable around the edges of the belt and buckle. It works well enough, however. Just be prepared to acclimate to a chunky belt."
3.0,"This shirt just arrived and I liked the texture of the material and cut and even the small graphic letters. But after sliding it over my head I wondered if they had sent me the wrong size. Nope, it's a medium. It's not a question of being a slim fit. Even the sleeves are way too short, and I haven't even washed it yet. I imagine with expected shrinkage it might fit a small boy after washing and drying. If it fit correctly perhaps in a larger size I would have given it a strong recommendation. But beware, it is not sized properly. I am a trim man at 5' 10"", 160 lbs. and always wear a medium. If you want to try it, please get a size larger to even attempt a proper fit. As such, I cannot recommend this shirt."
3.0,I've lost some weight and I was hoping this would cinch a shirt up more rather than just look like a decoration.
3.0,Too short...glasses pull out...
3.0,"The bra is comfortable, but has one thing that bugs me.  The flaps inside the material that covers the breasts folds over every time I put it on or take it off.  I have to ""readjust"" every time I wear it.  That problem makes it just too much work for me."
3.0,"it was raining VERY hard today so i finally got a chance to put this to the test.  the poncho is okay, big and roomy (enough for me & a backpack full of snacks) but the hood is LAUGHABLY small. it did not cover my face at all, i had to accept my arms getting wet so i could hold the hood out over my face to see where i was going. By the time i got home the seams around the front pocket had soaked through so it was pretty damp on the inside. If the rain hadnt been so torrential/windy i think i would have had a better experience, but that still wouldnt help the hood.  MUST wear a hat with a bill or??  i might sew some plastic to it, i'd rather my hair be a little wet than my face be a lot wet"
3.0,*3.5 stars*<br /><br />I wear a 10/12 and got this in a L. My largest complaint is the matetial! It looks so thick in the ad and in reality this is a thin sweater and the material is not soft.<br /><br />The fit is an oversized sweater fit and was what I expected. The turtle neck isnt too tight and the seam down the middle is like whats shown in the ad. I just wish it was more comfortable and thicker
3.0,The sunglasses were exactly what I wanted. Fit was perfect. the lens color were a lot lighter than I expected. Had to return them. I was looking for something on the darker.  Wish they had a black lens option
3.0,Fabric is good but very tight to put around your head. Wouldn't buy another one. Fast shipping though.
3.0,You have to screw on the back to the earrings! The back of my earrings were stripped and earrings kept falling off my ears because they are a little heavy! Won’t but again even though they are pretty!
3.0,"The looked nice, but my son said he did not like the look of them (the stripes) and wouldn't wear them.  So I sent them back."
3.0,"Fits great, flowy and comfortable. Quality slightly poor.... Peices of threading coming apart."
3.0,Nice quality but the waist is large and the leggings are very short. Just not a great fit for tall people.
3.0,Cheap jersey material. Not what I expected.
3.0,"CONS:<br />-  The fit was almost too tight.<br />-  It was a little on the &#34;thin&#34; side as far as material goes.<br />-  The product picture incorrectly defines how &#34;short&#34; this mask really is. Your neck WILL show.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-  This mask will scare the BEJEEBUS out of &#60;insert house pet here&#62;. It is truly creepy and allows for accessories. Like hats.<br />- IT DOESNT SMELL! That is beyond a pro when it comes to masks. Most of them smell like theyre made of rubber and cat turds, but this latex does NOT smell chemicalized at all.<br />- Pretty clear viewing. No problems adjusting the mask to the eyes.<br /><br />TL;DR -  Mask scary. Mask no stinky. Mask little cheap."
3.0,Ordered the wine red in medium which I liked but was too big so ordered a small. The small I received was not made by Ekouaer. It was made by Sheshow and the fabric was a lot thinner and felt cheaper. Also the color was a different shade. I did not like how high the zipper is at the bottom. Decided to return both and order a Ekouaer in a longer style. In the photo the Ekouaer medium is on the right and Sheshow small is on the left.
3.0,"It's nice, just very small. I had to stretch it in hopes it would not break but so far so good"
3.0,The fit was ok. Maybe slightly snug for me. The color is more red than the wine pictured. There was a snag in the lace on the front of the dress that caused a small hole.
3.0,"Although this is made of super yummy soft fabric, it is very thin and clingy - not oversized at all.  I would have to go up at least two sizes to get the oversize flowy look."
3.0,They are a little small and tight. Good if you're constantly looking back while riding. They definitely won't go flying off. Over all good enough for a cheap pair.
3.0,"Very colorful, beaded cuff bracelet.<br /><br />Reminds me of the 60’s and 70’s. Very colorful beads braided into a cuff style bracelet. It comes packaged in a burlap drawstring bag. Perfect for gift giving.<br /><br />One thing that will prevent me from wearing the bracelet is the ends of the beaded link have rough wires. They catch on everything. Clothing, blankets, towels; even the burlap bag it is stored in. It even pulled some of the threads in the bag.<br /><br />If you really like the bracelet and want to wear, I recommend that you tighten the ends."
3.0,A bit small but may because I have locks! But it's a nice hat!
3.0,The quality of the earrings is fine and they are attractive BUT the backs that came with the earrings don't fit so the literally just fall out.  I ordered 2 sets and the vendor included 1 set of alternative backs even though I ordered 2 sets of earrings...probably won't order from here again. :-(
3.0,What I really don't like about this wallet is it feels like there's paper between the leather and it makes the worst noise and terrible feel.
3.0,small fits ladies
3.0,I wasn’t crazy about the color I thought the red was going to be as pictured but it was actually lighter then I wanted
3.0,Love the material but not the most flattering on the bum.
3.0,One of the coins was missing.
3.0,I bought this for my husband's Bday.. But unless your from the Jersey Shore & a Guido this necklace will probably be too big. He is going to hang it from his rear view mirror. Good quality tho.
3.0,the sizing of this jacket was way way way off.  Fortunately was able to have it altered but still doesn't fit quite right.
3.0,The fit is a bit more clingy around the middle than I expected.
3.0,Beautiful colors but they were too small and kept falling out of my boyfriends ears and he ended up loosing them.
3.0,This dress feels like high quality and the color is beautiful but I feel like a pilgrim. It also runs big. I ordered a medium and I’m 5’7” and 155 lbs.
3.0,it is samll
3.0,Okay…be ready for the thin hold plating. Copper color underneath
3.0,3 stars because I broke one after a week of use.  Been using the second band for three months without an issue.
3.0,"These were really cute, but not high quality. I've bought sturdier sunglasses from the dollar store."
3.0,Fits perfect.  The bows fell off day one of wearing but my daughter loves them
3.0,It's shorter if you are 5' 7&#34; like me. The fit is a little smaller so go up 1 size
3.0,its hard to get one of these and they not shed and fall apart but this one really looks great its just exactly what it is and they never last long
3.0,"The Good: The mask is well made, and I like that it has a filter.<br /><br />The Not So Good: 1) The mask seems to ride up on your face and has to be pulled down constantly. More than any other mask I have worn this year.  2) The design looks great online, and looks good while laying flat on a table, but when you are wearing it no one can tell what it says.  My mask has the Rock Band ""YES"" on it.  When you are wearing it, it looks like a big mess of colors.  So, if no one knows what it says, what's the point of getting something like this?<br />In the end, it is well made, but needs to be modified so it doesn't ride up on your face.  If they fixed that issue, I might consider buying one with nothing on it."
3.0,Cheaper quality socks with lots of loose strings.
3.0,I ordered this twice. The first one fit ok but the binding around the neck was &#34;caught&#34; into the main bodice. Sewing issue. Sent it back. The second one came and was very large.
3.0,"This wasn't a terrible buy, I am gonna use it for sure but the fact that there were loose strings everywhere and that it does not look like the photograph I cant complain. I do feel like a paid for what I got. But others might disagree. If you don't have quite the talent for sewing then I would say get this for yourself. OH AND ANOTHER THING THE POKETS DON'T WORK!"
3.0,Average makers better night gown than dress..
3.0,"Color & material were fine. Need an option for different sizing for top and bottom. Purchased for my Granddaughter, bottom is a very good fit, but top was too small. She’s a 32 bust & had to continue pulling it down to keep breast from being exposed. Loved color & fabric. Only issue is sizing for the top."
3.0,I ordered the red one and I got an orange color instead. It was definitely not the color that was shown. I really don't like orange color but the material and the fit was okay so I'll just keep it.
3.0,"I'm a 14.  I got the XL.  The fit was good.  However , the top part is super cute.  The stomach area was a NO ! I have a little pooch.  This made me look  pregnant.  I'm 5,8 199pounds.  Someone with flater stomach would look awesome in this !"
3.0,"Too small. If you don't have a lot of hair and a small head you might be ok but it's tight, y'all. I wish I had listened to the other reviewers!"
3.0,They never arrived.<br /><br />Update: my neighbor dropped them by today. So now I have masks that say Merry Christmas lol. I ordered them the first week of December. I have lovely Christmas masks now for next year lol!
3.0,Much shorter than expected but served its purpose.
3.0,"It is pretty and seems like good quality, but it is VERY small. My daughter wears L or XL. I bought the largest size to be safe.  She can barely get in it."
3.0,"The balls aren't cast that well, but I am comparing them to real Bali made silver balls that I had ordered online which were beautiful. Still, they were made for some charity in Asia for women."
3.0,"If you are bigger than a size medium, you will have to look elsewhere. The jeans are cute and look like the photos but are INCREDIBLY, laughably small. I got a 2XL and could hold them wide open at my waist like they were an actual size 6 or 8. LOL Be warned. You will not be fitting these! I'll have to give these to my tiny cousin!"
3.0,It is super cute and fits well but the color is not like the picture.  It is more of a heather version of that color.  I am returning it for a different color.
3.0,"Nice shirt, but not a ""tee"". Soft and shiny silky material. Not what I expected, more of a ""shirt"" than ""tee""."
3.0,"Go this in a medium, I’m 5 7/160 lbs. it’s about 2-3 inches longer than I’d like. Sending it back"
3.0,The string that adjusts size is loose so I cannot keep it on my wrist.  Otherwise it was what I wanted.
3.0,It's good in general but the color not like the photo.
3.0,This little trooper looks great on the night stand and the alarm is very effective.  In some cases it is a little too effective (induces panic from a dead sleep) and since there is no snooze you always run the risk of turning it off and falling back asleep.  It may be more effective if you place it across the room from your bed.
3.0,They’re decent. They do the job. I noticed initially opening the bag that some were super loose and the balls would just fall off and others were so tight the balls wouldn’t budge. You get a multitude of pieces but only about half end up working out.
3.0,Shirt was form fitted cut and was 1 to 2 sizes too small. Everything else was great.
3.0,Sizes run on the small side.
3.0,The dress I received does not look like the photo. There is an unexpected elastic gathering that puts the waistline under the bust.Disappointed because this dress looked cute online. Seller offered me a full refund which is appreciated.
3.0,The shorts are nice but they feel cheap. I would have given a five-star if they were $12-$14 but $19 is steep for what you get.
3.0,I like the design and it is printed well.  However the material feels really thin.  For the price I think they could have used a little better quality material.
3.0,It worked but it was for big teeth
3.0,Pretty but had to return because it was too transparent.
3.0,"Great! Just know the wig is pretty small.. so if you have big hair, it won't fit.. I tried everything lol<br />And be careful with the gold pin thing, mine fell out in less the 4 hours of using it, other than that, it's really good.."
3.0,Broke mine with very little pressure
3.0,"These slippers are nicely made, but they run very small.  I wear a women's size 8 shoe, and they are too short - don't fit from toe to heel.  If you have smaller feet, these are great.  If you have larger feet, you should probably get the men's slippers."
3.0,These run EXTREMELY SMALL! I'm a woman and when I order men's clothing for myself I go (S).  I ordered these a (S) by habit and (M) due to the reviews.  I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE REVIEWS!!! LOL<br />I could not get ONE THIGH in a pants leg LOL<br />I will be ordering again because they are AMAZING! I LOVE THE STYLE!<br />I'm a W (M/L) I order M (S) for any women that could've used this as I could have lol<br />I will be trying a M (1X) next time!! Weird IK!!
3.0,Nice looking but wife has a problem with the rounded back which means it rolls around too  much instead of laying flat.
3.0,"Love the fabric but it's a tad shorter, almost like a long shirt. Color is beautiful & washes very nicely. Ordered two, different colors. The second one (grey) was extremely small, in all areas."
3.0,Actual size is not correct I got an XL just in case I needed to size down and it was to small. The quality was great but the fit wasn't.
3.0,It's not exactly what I wanted. It looks very different in person but hey at least it's pretty.
3.0,Love the dress with the pockets were deeer to fit a cell phone. If deeper pockets I would buy more prints in this dress
3.0,Loved this dress!  It was a little bit ill fitting the lining underneath wasn’t 100% sewed correctly - wouldn’t stay straight but it’s an awesome dress!
3.0,"I bought this product as a gift and while I do love it, it was not the greatest quality. My sister loved the shirt as well and the design is as pictured, but it runs just a little small and the fabric is flimsy. Once she washes it it looks as if some of the design will come off and the fabric is very thin."
3.0,"Shoes are great, made well, however they are NOT true to size. They run smaller than actual tennis shoes. My child wears a 1, when we got them and put them on, I should've bought a 2. He will not wear these the whole summer, his toes are already touching the end of the shoe.  He does love how they look, says there real cool!"
3.0,Super wrinkly.  Inexpensive looking.  You get what you pay for with this one.
3.0,"Nice color, looks pretty with belt tied around it. It is a little too large and shapeless without the belt. 5’2 130lbs ordered a small for reference."
3.0,"I was so excited to see that this dress was offered in TALL, but when I received it the length still landed over my ankles  at a weird spot.  The rest of the dress was pretty great.  This WOULD HAVE been a nice addition to my closet but had to return.  FYI I'm 6' tall"
3.0,"Nice earrings, however, a bit a flimsy"
3.0,[[VIDEOID:22c1874363714af386dfacedcbfb8e1a]] I bought this for my DC trip. Very fashionable and will make your hand warm. Downside is the touch screen does not work. I’ve been conatantly taking if off and putting it back on whenever I use my phone. Too bad because that’s the main reason why I bought this.
3.0,"The material was beautiful, but I am an American 1x<br />I won't wear anything with 4xs or more!<br />If they sell to us, they need to size to our standards.<br />Item was returned"
3.0,"These capris are pretty thick, so a bit too warm for summer. But they will be great in the winter time. Due to their thickness, I never have to worry about them being see-through, a huge plus in my books. The way they are made, I do get a bit of a muffin top that I don't normally get with other brands. Hopefully that'll lessen as I get rid of post-partum baby weight. For now, I just wear a looser/longer shirt. The capris are pretty good moisture wicking, but due to their thickness, don't dry as quickly as thinner workout pants. I haven't had any issues with them slipping or falling down. Overall, I like these and think they are decent quality, but due to the fit, probably wouldn't purchase another pair."
3.0,This dress is pretty cute. It's a little tight in the chest area based on the sizing I would recommend going up a size. The belt is definitely more right under the bust and only ties in the front (it doesn't wrap around you). The material is a bit see through but is light and soft. I definitely recommend wearing a pure white bra or a slip.
3.0,Didnt look like picture at all
3.0,"I have been wanting to get a vest like this for some time now, but since it's a little expensive, I kept putting it off.  I finally decided to buy this right before a vacation where I knew I would be hiking and out and about.  While the color is great: I got the red, which is nice and vibrant; the vest is a bit short (and I have a short torso).  I'm normally a S/M in Misses sizes, but I bought a large in this vest, and it worked out great for when all my pockets were full of things.<br /><br />I've washed the vest several times now, and the color is still a vibrant red.  The vest can tend to feel bulky when full with a cell phone, money, credit cards, sunglasses, keys, and passport.  I am glad to have the vest, but I wish it was longer.  The shortness of it, especially when its pockets are full, give me that feeling of being a little disheveled and not put together."
3.0,"It's a beautiful piece don't get me wrong, but when I received my necklace, I've noticed some cracks going around the entire name plate as if they was quickly trying to get it done. I did receive the necklace days before the original date it was to be delivered. So I guess that's a plus.<br />Also, the material that is on the back of the name plate to give it that mirror like affect was also wearing off and I hadn't even worn it yet."
3.0,These run very small for US sizes
3.0,"Cute print! The material was thin and light so it would likely be very cool and breezy in the summer. It fit as I thought it would.<br /><br />I’m returning this because the length of the sleeves just made it look bulky on me. It was a lot of fabric on top for a summer dress, but had the sleeves been shorter or there had been a little less covering the chest, I probably would have kept it. Upon reflection, it does look like the photos, you just never know until you see it on yourself."
3.0,Material had a funny petroleum smell to it - still can't get it out.  Haven't been able to wear in public yet because I think it smells bad.
3.0,"The zipper broke. Strangely, the metal piece just broke off making it impossible to zip the vest up.  A major flaw in design."
3.0,Great looking shoe but the back of the shoe is too low so it’s more like a slipper.  Needs to be a little higher so that is more stable when wearing but still slips on.
3.0,"Okay bag. Decent every day size, plain design."
3.0,"It is nothing fantastic, I got it to fit my phone in it (I have iphone 8- similar size to 7), but it zips up really tightly as if the zip will break off. Okay for small size phones.<br /><br />Otherwise it is okay."
3.0,Don’t care for both ends looking the same
3.0,Love the belt. Perfect size for my outfit.  Only downfall is it smells horrible...
3.0,"I ordered these shoes in brown/pink and black/white, because they are so adorable; and I could have easily awarded them with 5 stars, but the inconsistency in the sizing dropped it down.  My daughter wears a size 9, but we decided to order a 9.5 so that she could have some growing room.  Well, all I can say is that Willits needs to reevaluate how they size their shoes.  This shoe would be equivalent to a 10.5 at best.  Her foot is completely swimming around in it and could easily wear an 8.  That's how bad the sizing is.  If you order this shoe...please be aware of the sizing; however, you will be pleased with its quality."
3.0,4 of the 6 pair are great...however 2 of them had runs in them...
3.0,Item delivered without shirt and tie!
3.0,Makes a great gift for those who are huge fans of The Walking Dead
3.0,"Design on the shirt is very cute for animal lovers. However, it runs small/narrow & the sleeves are more capped-sleeves than short-sleeves. Also, material is soft but a little on the thin side."
3.0,"I like the look of this wallet; it's got a lot of space for cards, change, and bills. However, the card slots are really too small for basic credit cards/insurance cards, which renders the space a bit useless."
3.0,My wife doesn’t like it
3.0,"Cute, but break easily"
3.0,Had to close clasp.
3.0,"They do not stretch quite as well as I hoped, but will be fine. The yellow bracelets did rub off colour onto the skin. A much harder/rigid plastic feeling than the bracelets I remember from the time. But fine."
3.0,lots of compliments but it turns my wrist green(some metals do that) i have to paint the bottom with clear nail polish in order to wear it about every third day i wear it. still love it
3.0,They are very tiny and easy to loose.
3.0,I purposely ordered one size up and it was still tight in the shoulders.
3.0,The liner color was different (black) from the photographed item. Smaller than expected. Lots of unfinished edges. The zipper was very sticky. It looks like someone had tried it on before and gave up on getting the zipper to come back down.<br />Seems like it would be warm though!
3.0,"I love this bra so much, but the straps are too short and my ladies fall out the bottom 😭 so close to perfect"
3.0,Warm and comfortable hat- but the lining is already separating from the outside later unfortunately!
3.0,Thought back of pendant was flat- instead it is rounded so it rolls around when worn
3.0,They run a little small even though I bought a large. I wanted to get the extra large but they were out of stock. The pants are Adidas knock offs but you get what you paid for. Overall I do like them just wish they had bigger sizes for different body types.
3.0,The material is cheap looks cheap on not good for a wedding
3.0,Beautiful shirt but def too small and I entered my measurements. I would say to go up 2 sizes to fit comfortable. Debating on returning or trying to lose enough weight. Was a good value.
3.0,"Very nice shoe but tongue keeps getting caught on the inside of the shoes and must constantly be pulled out, which is annoying since it hinders the independence of the 3/4 year old trying to put them on."
3.0,"UPDATE:  After wearing them several times, the color faded drastically and unevenly. I was visiting my sister and had to line dry them outside. When they were dry, I noticed how discolored they were. I am so disappointed. I'm going to try and redye them and bring them back to life because before this, I loved them.<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW<br />I love the fabric. It is light and very soft. I really like the flat band at the waistline with the elastic in the back. It is forgiving. I am curious to see how they hold up over time. The elastic seemed like with a few washes, it might not hold. I haven't worn them yet, but I washed them in a lingerie bag and hung to dry and they fared well. After washing, the fabric has a slight ripple or texture to it, but I like it. If you ironed the pants, this ripple may would go away.<br /><br />The reason for my 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that I ordered gray and I discovered this is NOT at all true gray. It's more of a dusty lavender. I don't have a lot to go with this odd color. It is one of the reasons I haven't worn them yet...I don't have a top that works with this color other than maybe a black or white t-shirt and even that looks strange. If I were the company I would suggest changing the description of the color or talk to the fabric manufacturer and ask them to change their dye to a truer gray. I will update after I've worn them.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I wore the pants to work yesterday and received compliments. They are incredibly comfortable! There is quite a lot of leg fabric, so I kept rolling over it in my desk chair.  :D  These pants would be perfect with pockets! Can you please add slit pockets in the side seams?"
3.0,No es lo que aparenta en las fotografías
3.0,the lining would hang lower than the skirt. Great color!
3.0,"I love this umbrella, but mine does not stay lit for more than an hour at night. I have it out in the sun all day, and it's the FL sun which is bright all the time. Very disappointed. Having to return it sadly..so frustrating!!"
3.0,"Bought this as a gift for a little German girl for her birthday. Item is nice,delicate.  It appears to be of good quality.  The seller show a gift box with this item.  Mine arrived in a red silk bag with the name on it and the necklace was in a small zip lock bag.  I guess I am not supposed to mention that because Amazon would not post my first review stating I needed to focus on the item.  Well there isn't much more to say about the item but I think the packaging is important especially if you are purchasing as a gift.  If they are not going to use a box then don't show it in the picture.  The seller and Amazon should realize that while they want me to focus on the item the focus is also on the presentation."
3.0,I was looking for a shoulder bag for  trips to my local art museum after having an unpleasant encounter with a staff member working security who harassed me for a nonexistent issue (at the time) with my small backpack. I came across this backpack. I was a bit surprised that it could only fit my  portable battery charger and my smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S10). Can't put my keys in it because my battery charger and phone takes up most of the room. I don't recommend this bag if you want to fit larger items into the bag.
3.0,Thicker than I would have liked.
3.0,"The material the slippers are made of is pilling up in little balls where the cuffs of my pants rub against them. Also, the soles tend to grab on the carpet on the steps causing me to stumble several times. The support of the insoles is good though."
3.0,"The style was not as flowly as I expected, however material was good."
3.0,Clip is too big - it slips off the tie.
3.0,I got the XXL according to the size chart and the waist was about 3” too large on me. The “champagne” fabric is stiff and wrinkles extremely easily. Probably going to return this one.
3.0,larger fit than I'd like
3.0,Really cute suit but fabric too thin and see through.
3.0,Love the shape but the lenses need some work...meaning vision is blurred in some areas of the lense
3.0,"This hat fit okay for me, but it really needs a chin strap.  You need to plan on having a free hand at all times to hold onto it.<br /><br />The good thing though is it kept me from burning in the hot Brazilian sun, but I would not buy it again."
3.0,This is a cute little summer dress if you’re looking to wear the dress once it shrunk about two sizes but it is an inexpensive dress for one location
3.0,"I ordered these for my 8 year old son to match his pjs for pj day at school. He wears a size 4 shoe (not little boy shoesize). The 3-4 big boys was way too small for him.  They barely made it past the middle of his foot. I would say they run small, since his other slippers are a 3-4 big boys and for perfectly.  Other than that, they appeared to be great fluffy slippers. Shipping was fast too."
3.0,"Very pretty and well made. However, I ordered a 0/2, and it’s tight to the point that I struggle to get it on and off. I’m 5’5, 125 lbs, and a 34C. Maybe size up if you’re bigger than a B cup."
3.0,"Bad for anything long-term.  Molts like you wouldn't believe. Looked like a bird died in my bathroom, and I had to convince my guests that I wasn't a murderer."
3.0,"microfiber with denim-look- my fleece microfiber of past pills horribly & what i'm trying to avoid buying any more of because it looks old & dumpy before too long so these i sent back. medium fit me good: my size is 29&#34; inseam, 40&#34; hip, 28&#34; waist."
3.0,Loved the color but they scratch easily
3.0,"Ohhh boy she hated it,success haha"
3.0,Very cute but too snug! Returned!
3.0,Really small! Also I wasn’t a fan of the Ex fabric on the bottom of the legs. I sometimes like to wear compression shorts under my tights or sweats but that extra flap looked like I had boxers on. It just wasn’t what I was looking for.
3.0,I am  5ft and 110 lbs and got the smallest size. I usually don’t have an issue-but the arm bands on this were really small. I couldn’t get them to fit around my arms where they were supposed to go. Almost child sized.
3.0,"Hard to see, they are really dark unless it's 100% sunlight.  They also don't fit well, they're flat and don't contour to my face."
3.0,"I am a 5ft 7 inch women who wears a size 10/12 with regular calf circumference, this leg wallet fits my calf but if you are a gentlemen (unless a smaller man or one with skinny legs), it will not fit you. Do NOT order if you have larger calves unless you want to wear it on your forearm (which you could do under a long sleeve shirt)."
3.0,"Sweater is shorter than in the picture. It's like a long crop top, it barely stops at your waist. Im 5'3, 132lbs and it fits perfect (i got a small) but i just wish it was longer. Still looks decent to wear an undershirt with it. 3 stars.."
3.0,I ordered a 14 and they are too big.
3.0,"I love the thickness and the feel of this choker, but the downside is that it's too big!! I put it on at the tightest and it still slides down my neck."
3.0,Its fits pretty good.
3.0,"Although the shoes were rapidly delivered, and the fit of them was OK, after only two training sessions the tip of one of the shoes was ripped."
3.0,A little baggy around the neck
3.0,"Nice shirt,however; the arms to shirt run very small.  If you have large arms I will not suggest  buying this shirt.  I usually a wear medium but bought a large.(arm tight)."
3.0,"I really like the look of these earrings. However, that being said, one of the gold ones has slipped out of my ear several times. (Thank goodness, each time I found it!). So, I just pinch it closed after putting them in my war. This has seemed to solve the problem."
3.0,"This a beautiful dress and is very well made.  Also, It looks just like the picture.  I am between two sizes and I ordered the larger one just in case.  It fits very snug, but not too bad.  I would just keep that in mind while purchasing.  The reason for three stars is this dress was supposed to be dark red and purple.  I am going to a wedding where I am supposed to find something purple to wear (she said other colors are ok too), but my boyfriend is wearing red accents so I wanted to match.  I read reviews and nobody said anything about it not being the color advertised, and there were questions on whether the purple and black dress was blue, and the conclusion was it is as advertised.  This one isn't.  It is a darker red and a royal blue, with a navy slip and navy ribbons across the waste."
3.0,strap broke 2nd use
3.0,We ordered this for my daughter. She loves the necklace and the assortment of charms is perfect. The difficulty is getting the charms on and off. You have to pry the ring open each time. I knew this when we ordered it. I wish they had put a spring ring on to make it easier to change the charms. But the necklace is cute.
3.0,At -2° my hands were cold after about  45 minutes of snow removal. On the plus side they do seem to keep your hands dry.
3.0,"This swim suit is for women at least 5' 7'', returned it"
3.0,Went with reviewer's advice and Got the smaller size but gonna give it away as it's a bit too snug on my average sized  male wrist. Also gonna go with the darker shade of metal.
3.0,"a little small, but heck maybe i will lose weight."
3.0,Doesn’t fit as expected more along the lines of a 1x instead of a 3x. Definitely do not purchase if you are larger.  Very uncomfortable
3.0,some of the balls didn’t screw off.
3.0,"Beautiful top, very soft...but it was sewn up wrong and has threads sticking all out of the side. :/  it can be fixed but is a lil annoying."
3.0,Runs way too small. Husband sized up to a 3XL just in case and it was still too small. Looks and fits more like a xl instead of a 3xl.
3.0,"Received these in the garnet, January red.  These earrings are not 11mm as described, but are much smaller stones, I would say maybe 8mm. I know they are smaller because I own 11mm ones I bought somewhere else.  They are petite and small in size, and are very pretty, but $15 is way overpriced for such small earrings, otherwise I would have bought another pair in a different color.  They should have a picture of these on a model so you can have a better idea of the real size you will be receiving. These are more like for a child than adult. You can buy this same style earrings in different sizes for a much lesser price that is very popular for its auctions....beginning with an E."
3.0,These were way to big for me so i had to return them... the material was very thick but also well made.
3.0,I bought this for my niece because she loves jewelry but she often forgets where she placed them...
3.0,How are u supposed to go to the bathroom ?
3.0,"Needs to come in 2 sizes, medium & large."
3.0,"Wasn't very flattering on plus size women and a bit small, ordered a size larger."
3.0,"Bought these a closure for a drawstring on a backpack, and while they work, the springs are on the light side and the hold on to the paracord is not very tight. I don't want them so stiff I can't depress the release, but at the same time these feel so weak to me that they are just barely holding my bag closed."
3.0,It's beautiful but the magnectic part come apart easily-you can lose watch
3.0,It looks nice that's all I'm really going for especially buying jewelry on Amazon can't really expect it to be top of the line real gold. But serves its purpose.
3.0,"I haven’t tried these on my daughter yet so I cannot speak on the fit or quality at this time. They appear standard and okay, but I will update.<br /><br />The socks arrived with only 4 socks. I have the paper wrapper for the fifth one, but no sock. I bought these for the white socks mostly, so of course that’s the color mission. I’m really bummed because these were for my daughters 1st birthday party this weekend."
3.0,"The dress is of nice quality and looks cute but the collar part is loose and if you have a big chest the dress might be tight in that area. Also the arms is quite tight. Basically if you have a large chest or big arms, I recommend sizing up by one."
3.0,Very cute but disappointed that I can't match my earrings because there is no match. It's just single earrings in silver and gold.
3.0,A bit too tight for me.
3.0,The jacket fitted as expected but I noticed the next day the under the armpit the stitching had came undone about 3inches.
3.0,Didn't care for this one. I had ordered one previously an loved it. I reordered an recieved a thin shirt different material.
3.0,"I ordered these for my husband for Christmas he is a size 8-8 1/2 I ordered a size down based on the manufacturers recomendations.  They were tiny, more like a men's 7.  The quality of the leather and fleece is great for the price, however the soles are very thin.  The slipper is a good value at $15, but order a size up!"
3.0,"Relatively satisfied with this belt.<br /><br />Other reviewers are claiming that the mechanism failed on them, I haven't had any problems with the belt mechanism. It's the most comfortable belt I have, since you can adjust it so easily. Unlike, cloth belts with the rings to adjust tension, the buckle doesn't gouge into my gut.<br /><br />However, I can't give this a 5 star review since the paint on the buckle cracks off and it looks terrible. I still use this belt, since I mostly wear t-shirts that are long enough to cover it, but I will not be buying this brand again.<br /><br />This is a good starter slide belt."
3.0,"Whatever size you wear, like if you wear 9.5. You would get large, per the size chart. But in reality, you should get XLarge."
3.0,Eh. Just okay. Fits a size small
3.0,Hard to read time if not in daylight. I need to get a different band because the metal closure digs into my wrist.
3.0,"They are cute, just a little awkward to wear because the top holes slip off my shoulders and the bottom two are too tight"
3.0,Was a size 11. Suggested purchase one size LARGER (not correct) Wanted a 10 1/2 !
3.0,Too tiny for my daughters foot.  This shoe runs small.
3.0,"The necklace is very pretty and I love it . The only reason I gave it 3 stars it that when I opened the package, two of the links had come loose. I was able to fix it, but also has to close other links as well."
3.0,I ordered a medium and it’s very close to a size small.
3.0,"I like this dress - the design is cute and the top part fits well. However, the skirt is...strange. The pleats don't lay as uniformly as they do in the picture, the skirt is kind of smashed to one side. I have not been able to wear it out yet because I have not figured out how to get the pleats to look normal. If you're savvier about pleats than I am, go for it."
3.0,"They’re a little smelly to the kids, but they’ll wear them."
3.0,"For me the band is too thick around the bottom of the finger which makes it feel uncomfortable. I wear a size 7, received the ring had to go up a size because it's not true to size in my opinion. I bought mine for a pinky ring, so if you have a size 7 you need to go 8 if you have a size 8 need to go a 9 and so forth and so on."
3.0,"My daughter loves these! Unfortunately, after a few weeks, one of the turtles fell off the post."
3.0,"This dress was ok. I know this dress was not advertised for a nursing mom, however, there were defects with the dress itself that would apply to anyone. I loved the idea of this dress to nurse my daughter while keeping mostly covered up. BUT the light color in the skirt though is see-thru. Of course the first chevron piece that is the beige color is right at the underwear line. I found this out after already being at a party with hot pink underwear on, ugh. Also once I nursed my daughter by pulling the wrap top to the side, it got stretched out. So my bra was showing to everyone also at this party. I looked like a hot mess. If you're a nursing mom, it works, but just make sure you don't wear any underwear and maybe a cardigan for the top!"
3.0,I ordered a men's xl and it was more like a child's xl and a woman's instead of mans.
3.0,I have sensitive ears--these were slightly irritating at first but I got used to them. I'd also recommend getting new backings--if you want to sleep in these it's better not to use the backings that come with the earrings.
3.0,Sizing is very off...luckily it came with an extender.
3.0,Muy ordinario
3.0,My husband is a 32 waist so we ordered the Mediums the 32-34 which should fit fine. They don't fit around the waist at all the length is good and the material looks decent quality and waterproof. However its not much use if your not going to wear them. We do a lot of snowboarding and these would be extremely uncomfortable using a full day. Remember to Size up
3.0,"This poncho wrap looks a lot better on the product page than it does in real life.  It doesn't fit me well - I'm 5'9"", 142 lbs, 34B and I though it would hang a lot better.  It needs to be a little longer and I just can't seem to get it adjusted so that it looks like the picture.  It's thin and not for cold weather unless you have something substantial on underneath it.  The fringe string is really cheap looking and I might find better fringe at the cloth store to replace it later.  As a matter of fact, I think I will sew it up like a real poncho and see if that helps it to hang better on me.  Thank God mom taught me how to sew.  I was really looking forward to wearing this but am somewhat disappointed with it."
3.0,I received this product free or at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.<br /><br />I received this socks couple days ago and I really like how it looks but then I noticed that there is a white line on the top of sock but it supposed not to be there. I am giving this to my two years old niece and I am pretty sure she is gonna love this cute socks a lot. The material on these socks are okay not 100% made by cotton and maybe can't absorb a lot of sweat.
3.0,"This jumpsuit is really cute, and fits as expected, but the one pictured shows a solid black fabric neckline and I received one with a mesh neckline.."
3.0,I found them comfortable but I could see my toes silohuette even though this was allegedly my size. Nice color.
3.0,Love the beads. The closing part gets wore out if u wear it everyday.
3.0,it alright but nothing spectacular
3.0,"I normally wear a Med. There is no way I could wear this. I would at least need to go up one, maybe two sizes, for it to work. It is a cute top, though."
3.0,"The sizing is small and we had to exchange it for a full size larger. The bottom is stiff, like an old school flip flop. Not my taste but it was purchased for my 14 year old who likes them."
3.0,This fits more like a 6x. I ordered a size 4. The bow in the back is off-center too. Glad it was just for play.
3.0,"Very pretty, but too heavy. I couldn’t last more than an hour with them."
3.0,Runs really big and thin material.
3.0,"It's an alright jacket. Fashion yes, quality of materials.. eh. The XL/US Medium' is more like a US Small."
3.0,"We are all familiar with this beautiful painting.  Unfortunately, the dress is too dark and it does not display a distinction between the beautiful orange, green and blue.  The dress is more like a monochromatic dark blue greenish.  :("
3.0,Cute but runs pretty small
3.0,"I like the organization aspect of it, while it hangs and shows you everything, this is flawed. When you put items in, they fit very tight."
3.0,Would be better if it had more coverage/ protection. Wear a ball cap.
3.0,Difficult to figure out how to put on.  Doesn't look like picture
3.0,The item shows as pictured and is hallow on the other side. The chain doesn't look delicate around my neck and I added gemstones around the neck to make it look better. The necklace is too long on me but it does look very cute.
3.0,looks close to the Polo Ralph Lauren it seems to emulate.<br />Good value for money.
3.0,"Awesome! They look really cool in, and they're really comfortable to leave in for days at a time. Yes, they do snag a little sometimes on longer hair, but not enough to really bother me... until one of them fell apart.<br /><br />It wasn't like I was messing with it at the time, I just glanced in the mirror one day and realized to my horror that the star was gone. I later found the lost star on the floor at home. For all I can tell, whatever had been holding the star to its post just gave up and let go. I tried gluing it back together with apoxy but no go. Not enough surface area to work.<br /><br />I'll give it another shot because I really like the style, but seems like a scenario of ""you get what you pay for"". At least I have a backup in case one of the new ones decide to split, too."
3.0,"I bought the red ones because I liked my Tesla base layer tights so much. They are comfortable and effective. However, be aware that these are not made the same way as higher-quality brands like Under Armour. The fabric they use is dyed and will bleed. I learned this the hard way as the red ones I bought ruined a brand new pair of running shorts with white in them along with a brand new white Under Armour shirt that was tucked in. I would buy them again, but I would be sure to wash them with like colors a few times first. I deducted two stars for that, but they work well otherwise."
3.0,Great fit but thin material.
3.0,I wasn't impressed but then again it wasn't expensive so I guess I got what I paid for.
3.0,it was ok... not as soft as I would have expected it to be and kind of stiff.  Doesn't really take the shape of your body
3.0,not for anyone over a B cup
3.0,The reason I paid more for this is because it had the plastic block that would prevent the teeth no to dig into the fabric. It only came with one plastic block.
3.0,"This is beautiful and has good quality material. I tried it on before washing and it fit my figure quite well, but after one washing the matierial shrunk just enough that I can’t get my D-cup girls to stay where they are supposed to in the dress. Thankfully the rest of the dress is flowy enough that I didn’t notice the shrinkage anywhere else."
3.0,"So I ordered based on their sizing chart. Just order your size, or even size up. The socks are to tight around my calves so unfortunately I can not wear them, which was extremely disappointing because they really provided so much relief to my feet, support in my ankles and comfort up until the calve/knee area. They are also very difficult to put on, but I think that could be resolved some with the next size up."
3.0,"Like the belt. Won't ever use for bottle opener.  I am 36&#34; and I would buy bigger, then cut down. Felt like too small"
3.0,"I love that this is lightweight on the head, but the extra scarf can be heavy if you don't know many ways to style the scarf.  I wish it came with more options than the one on the package.  I couldn't find a way to contact the seller via Amazon (no option) as they did offer to learn more styles to tie the headwraps.  Hopefully, they will see this review and contact me that way."
3.0,"They look better in the picture due to the fact that they are very small in person. You can still tell they are khamsas. Theyre okay, in my opinion."
3.0,I love having something on wrist at all times if there nothing there I feel naked. I was browsing for a new wristband I came across the gem the picture made it look great and it looked to have the certain 1930's explorer feel to it which sold me right there and then. When I got it it looked cool loved the way it wrapped around my wrist. but it is made very cheaply I know it probly got a life span of a few weeks but ill enjoy the hell out of it.
3.0,I like these glasses this is the third time I’ve ordered them. This time it was raining in the Amazon bubble wrap package was open and the glasses were hanging out
3.0,"It’s a good size but the attaching clip and band are very non functional and take away the chicness of the look I was going for. I had to take it apart a bit on the inside and then see in some hair combs I bought online. I can kind of claw it onto my head now but it takes work to get it secured enough not to flip around. The clips it came with were metal and tore my hair mercilessly. The headband makes it look like a costume hat IMO rather than stylish. If you’re willing to modify it a bit, the size is nice and can be used to pull of a ver Megan M look."
3.0,"My only issue with this swimsuit is that one of the breast pads folded over (either before it arrived or after the first time wearing it). I was able to manipulate it back into place, but there's a permanent crease in it. That being said, it's a darling suit, it's easy to take on and off to go to the bathroom, and it fits as expected. I've been looking for a one piece for years that was modest, didn't hang my cleavage out, didn't ride high on the butt, that didn't have a hook at the top that I'd need someone else to buckle and unbuckle for me, that wouldn't break the bank. This suit checked all the boxes!"
3.0,The socks were a nice color! But the foot bed was way too short for my foot. The measurements are not correct at all.
3.0,The stitching is not really sewn to stretch...which should be expected for active pants.  They fit fine with plenty of room but as you stretch them just to put them on you can hear the stitching breaking around the waist band.
3.0,Pretty fragile but also very pretty.
3.0,"I love the coat but it fits smaller than expected and the stitching was poorly done had to do so.e repair, but overall looks nice and is warm enough"
3.0,It is pretty and fits well but within a month or 2 it’s already started fraying
3.0,"good fit, but very cheap material. will be fine for a few wears"
3.0,"Some masks were good and some were bad. We were individually wrapped, but most were not.<br /><br />They either did not have the wire molding nose piece, so they were unusable. Or the straps were torn and therefore the mask has to be thrown away.<br /><br />Not terrible but not great either."
3.0,"Cute but should be stated in Juniors sizes, for people with NO chest"
3.0,"It is amazing but runs very small, had to return. My husband is a 36-38 waist. The large was too small"
3.0,"After a while the metal sperates from the fabric so you have to reglue it. Great band otherwise, very comfortable"
3.0,"I love the look, it arrived relatively quick.  But the larger purse does not stand up, it keeps tipping over I only keep my cell phone in the side pocket but the whole top half just sags over & tips spilling my stuff as I usually do not zip my purse for easy access to my stuff.  Over all I probably would not recommend this to someone one unless you were just using the larger bag as maybe a work bag and not a purse."
3.0,This shirt is absolutely what I expected as far as looks are concerned. It's sort of a sheer material so I had to wear a tank underneath. And it also fits a liiiiiittttttllee bit tigher than a normal large. Still cute though.
3.0,I'm 5'2 125-127 lbs and got a small. Length is good. The side sort of gapes a tiny bit but not big enough to show bra. It's a sort of weird feeling fabric but not uncomfortable.
3.0,"It's a nice manual watch, major con with it though is now matter are hard I try it within 3 hrs it's either ahead or behind 10+ seconds, which wouldn't be a problem except for that you have to wait until the spring to be almost completely unwound just to set the thing."
3.0,"Shipping was fast. She loves them but was upset that they do not look like the picture. She likes things to be as close to perfect as she can get shes a marvel super fan...we order purple gradient it's supposed to be lighter at the bottom, they are just black. I gave a 3 because they are not as pictured. I will order another pair to see if it happens again."
3.0,Very nice materials and pattern but felt too big like a tent on me. Unlike the picture of the model. Could work as a coat but not. Top.
3.0,It is definitely silky but easy to wrinkly as well
3.0,The top seems to be a bit big then expected
3.0,"I ordered this bulk pack cause I love playing around with my different looks for earrings. Red especially is my favorite color, so when the gummy bears set came out, the red gummy bears earrings looked more like a darker shade of orange rather than red as it was after all advertised. Other than that, the rest of the mix set came out perfectly fine."
3.0,I did not like this at all it looked nothing like the picture
3.0,I had ordered a size Medium and received much like an Extra Large
3.0,Bought specifically for use on extremely long flights (20 hrs +).  Took them off after the first flight of many.
3.0,Does not look like I expected from the photo.
3.0,Stock photos are of a Bronson Breton. These are not. They are a thin shiny synthetic blend stretch material.
3.0,"Pro:  excellent quality, zipper pockets, good price, fast delivery, mesh lining<br />Con: heavy, too warm for summer windbreaker, maybe ok for winter, bulky for packing, color selection low"
3.0,"I got this scarf for a competition my friends and I did. We all had to match so we bought them in a bundle. Overall the scarves were nice but one of them were a different shade of blue. Also, the material got really weird and rough after one wash."
3.0,"I'm usually a small and ordered a medium.  I think if I order again, large would be the way to go.  It's cute but stiff."
3.0,"The dress started out great, but after just a few machine washes, it has faded and pilled.  I purchased it to wear to work, but now it's just a errand running skirt with sneakers."
3.0,"Much too small, but I might have ordered the wrong size.  There are several listings for this type of shoes, and I may have gotten them mixed up.  I wear a women's 9 1/2 (or a 41 or 42 in those Chinese Mary Jane shoes), and ordered a size XL.  It didn't come close to fitting.  I could get it on, but my big toenail would have had a hole ripped in it within a week.  I returned them."
3.0,The product is made from cheap material and the stitching is not great but that goes along with the price. It appears a little small to me but we will probably try to take a few photos and that will be all the use we get out of it. The ribbon came attached but the bow was not tied so you will have to do that yourself.
3.0,"I bought this in 2 colors, the grey is thicker fabric which I love! because it's not see through at all but the neon orange one is made with a thinner fabric so I don't think I could ever wear it out. It's a nice color though. I wish both dresses were made with the same fabric!"
3.0,It is good quality but the sizing is much small than what the size says.
3.0,They break very easy
3.0,I like this item but feel the backings weren't big enough for the weight of the skull.
3.0,Fits well but is super wrinkly. No matter how often I iron it after wearing for 5 mins it has wrinkles in it.
3.0,Item was different than pictured (pants were mainly animal print with plaid flair) but was still super cute.  Only gave 3 stars since it was not what was pictured and expected but it worked.
3.0,"They run very small. The description showed then as loose fit and a 36"" waist. The shorts arrived with a 36 tag stuck on them but with a waist that measured 33 and 3/4ths of an inch and there was a sewn in tag marked M (likely for medium). Other than the quality, findings and fabric seemed quite good."
3.0,I wear it often but it is slightly smaller than a normal medium runs. I typically love North face so I'm surprised with the fit. Delivery was very quick though!
3.0,"The post is very short , scared I'm going to loose it. It was packed and delivered very beautifully and I like it."
3.0,"Returned watch. While it is beautiful, it's too difficult to set."
3.0,"I paid around 85$ for this watch, its ok, the band is junk, other than that its an ok watch, it does look nice but will see how long it holds up."
3.0,This ring was very light in color and the emerald cut stone lacked depth and richness.
3.0,"After only 2 washes the seams are coming undone-_-. Mind you, I air dry them and follow the instructions on the label ."
3.0,"These sunglasses do what they need to, but they are kind of bulky."
3.0,"I find the description a little hard to believe as far as capacity, but they seem durable.  They are TIGHTLY packaged so don't wait until your groceries are being rung up to try and get one of these out and ready to receive items.  I have no idea how I'll get the bag back into a pouch.  I noticed the stitching is already coming off on the trim around the handles and I JUST used the bag for the first time today.  I purchased some other bags that I prefer over these and seem to be made to a higher standard."
3.0,"The show itself is of nice quality, but it runs small.  My grandson wears a size 1 in kids size, and after reading such mixed reviews saying that they fit true to size, they run small, they run big, I ordered the size that my grandson wears.  A size 1. His toe was pressing tight to the end of the shoe, and if I were to reorder the shoe, I would go to a size 3 in order to give his toes enough room. I definitely recommend ordering one or two sizes up to be sure they fit."
3.0,I thought they would be a little longer than they are.  Cord is a little wider than anticipated also. But should be very sturdy.
3.0,"Beautiful purple color, but the fit was smaller than expected. Unfortunately, I was out of town and missed the return window, so now I'm stuck with a dress that doesn't fit."
3.0,"Bought the black leopard print. They fit nicely, and the pattern is cute, however the material is thin which makes these leggings slightly see through. I don’t expect these to last very long."
3.0,"Sizes run a bit tight. I returned mine and decided to go with the brand that, according to my, sets the standard for what an outdoor/tactical short should be: TruSpec 24/7"
3.0,This is the second time I've ordered these lenses as a replacement. The first time was great and I wore them for over a year before I needed a replacement (just usual scratches from life). I loved them. This time I've been wearing them for 2 almost 3 months and I'm getting a hairline crack in each lens starting from where the lenses connect to the frame and straight across. Not ideal. Now I need to look for a new lenses and I'm hesitant to buy them again.
3.0,Ordered my size. Didn't fit well
3.0,"They were  not long enough in the ear area they were to short, but I loved the look the entire reason I purchased them"
3.0,"I tried their [[ASIN:B08F7QQ11T colorful version]] of this mask and it was so large it would not stay on my face or ears. However, this one is a little snugger. It does stay on my nose and ears but I have to be careful it does not fall down during use because it is still larger than I need. It is a comfortable and attractively designed gaiter.<br /><br />The current price of $12.99 is expensive but still competitive for this."
3.0,"Came extremely wrinkled. Not for someone with a larger tummy. It only accentuates it. In the process of trying to lose a few pounds, so will hang onto it vs the hassle of a return. I was going to buy a few colors-glad I didn’t. I’ve learned when ordering online to buy one and if I love it, then buy more. Otherwise, you get stuck with 3 or 4 of something you don’t like and miss the return date."
3.0,"The fabric is thinner than I expected and the leggings fit tighter than I had thought - more of a U.S. 16 than 18, but still cute and fine to wear with black panties."
3.0,"These are lightweight and work for Yoga or running.  But mine was a size too big, it keeps slipping down. Size down. And after a few wears the seams started coming unraveled. It’s good for a few wears."
3.0,Color is darker than pictured
3.0,"Nice but doesn’t not look like real gold for the price, bought a cheaper one just for the look"
3.0,"Almost exactly the same as the band that came with my watch except that there was not a size option.  I really need the S/M and this is either a one-size fits all, or a M/L.  The tip of the band reaches to the underneath of the watch when I have it clasped on.  For anyone needing medium to large, though, this is an excellent alternative to the cost of buying the band from Apple.  The quality of the material is exactly the same."
3.0,"Picture is misleading, this is a pack of one of each color, not a pair of each color.  Earrings are otherwise as expected"
3.0,Very cute shirt but it runs small. I ordered a size up and once I wear and wash it I guarantee it will be too small.
3.0,I didn’t love the material. Fit good.
3.0,Not a good fit for a tall person.
3.0,"Band looks ok, not one of my favorites but I am going to keep it. It’s an unusual band."
3.0,It came in super fast but it is huge!!
3.0,"Based on price alone this was a fair combo pack.  The shirt fabric was as adequate, as expected.  The comfort button closure on the neck was a big plus.  I should have looked for an athletic or slim fit because the shirt was huge and had to be tailored at least four inches on both side seams (since I was having the pants hemmed it worked out).  Next time I will opt to purchase the items separately in an effort to find a higher quality fabrics.  I think the cummerbund and tie would have been sharper if they were a higher quality in silk.  The studs and cufflinks were as expected.  If you plan to make use of the tux more than just on a rare occasion I'd consider thinking of the studs and cufflinks as your jewelry; there were several options available to reflect class and personal style."
3.0,they wear out in 5 weeks.
3.0,I love the dress but it is completely see through.
3.0,"Way too heavy. Useless timing dials with only a one hour capacity. Looks great, but that is all."
3.0,"I like this vest but it's too small, need to get it altered to fit that's why I give 3 stars."
3.0,I love the shoes but they are a Lil bit too big but they will do
3.0,Looks pretty but didn't like polyester kind of material.
3.0,Love the shirt but the shirt is falling apart... Very disappointed in quality it has none.
3.0,Es sintetica muy cara
3.0,"They were too big (I'm a size 6 in pants) and I tried to use the awl to add more holes, but my awl had a defect and doesnt work well... More of a hassle than it would have been for me to just go to Target and buy a couple belts there."
3.0,Came a month earlier than expected. I like how the studs are small & discrete. I don't like the look of a huge nose ring! My only complaint is the color. The colors aren't as bright as I'd hope & keep in mind that you will get random colors. I got a lot of duplicates. I also didn't like that they came in a ziploc bag & not a secure packaging. So I wouldn't say that they're sterile. Make sure to clean them before using!
3.0,A little tight but the fabric was great!!
3.0,"Cute but runs small, order a size up"
3.0,Gorgeous jeans but they do not have any stretch as stated in the headline. I usually wear a large would need an XL in these which is not prime eligible so I’m going to return them because I wanted to wear them this weekend. All sizes should be prime at this<br />point. Who’s going to wait 3weeks for a pair of jeans!!!! If you order go a size or even two up. They are super cute though!<br /><br />I also ordered the pink jeans with the rips! Cheapest zipper ever!!!! Didn’t even get to wear them I had to take them to the cleaners and spend $15 to get a strong heavy duty zipper. Great jeans but cheap zippers on both! The color is exact though and they would ya e been super cute had not the zipper broke.......lmaooooooooooo!
3.0,I loved these I think they should fit my boys.
3.0,I ordered an XL because I like my T-shirt’s big. Tried this on and it’s very tight around the belly. Fit more like a medium. Loved the graphic design but tshirt tuns very small. Order a bigger size of you like a bigger T-shirt.
3.0,"These socks fit well and were warm.  I just didn't like the rubber dots along the bottom.  While I'm sure they would work for traction, it irritated me that I could feel them while walking around."
3.0,The outfit is stretchy so if it’s too big the shorts will ride up so I would order a size down.
3.0,"The shorts are soft, but the length just isn’t it. They’re way too long on me and look kind of frumpy."
3.0,It was shorter than stated
3.0,This is a very basic cami.  It is comfortable and true to color and size.  Nothing special about it and the neckline is a tad higher than I expected.  It’s a nice top for lounging around in.
3.0,"I'm not sure how to describe them. They just looked a little cheap but in their defense, they were."
3.0,"While these are very cute and made for a nice best friends got to my friend, you can tell that they are very cheaply made. I barely took the one out of the packaging and the clasp had already come apart from the bracelet. They are very cute and I'd say maybe just take them apart and replace the clasps with good quality ones but for the price you really can't complain to much."
3.0,Not the same as in the picture
3.0,Very lightweight and very stretchy. But has raw edges and doesn’t stay up well do to a lack of structure
3.0,these are OK
3.0,I should have ordered the longer bar with these but they are definitely cute
3.0,Love the shirt!! Material was rich in color and also soft. My only issue was that the sleeves were too tight.
3.0,this wallet does not stay closed when a check packet is in it in the slot meant for a cell phone. This seems like a no brainer to me that as a check packet is the same or less thickness than a cell phone the wallet should stay closed. I would have to not recommend this item as the &#34;description&#34; is not true to the actual product.
3.0,I bought this as a gift for 6’6” and 250lbs. It was too small.  Buy one size up.
3.0,"I'm five feet and 122 pound and ordered a size small dress. The middle was actually a bit loose and v-neck was more of a u-neck on me because I have small boobs. The dress is also much darker than the image shown. The color is very close to black than blue, so if you are looking for a blue dress don't buy this dress!"
3.0,"I usually wear a large, that's what I ordered, I probably needed at least a XXL for this to fit. So bummed!"
3.0,The elastic waistband on the pants is very small. The other items were as expected.
3.0,"The earrings themselves are great, but mine came missing the heart shaped ones!"
3.0,"Runs a bit large.  Im a size 9 on my bottom, I bought the M and there too big."
3.0,Stiff sandals.. good but not great !
3.0,This fits very large and its itchy so I never wear it.
3.0,"I somehow ended up buying 2 of these (the black frame with the green lenses and the pink frame) They have a great shape and the feel very sturdy!  They look beautiful on! But my thing is that they extremely heavy! I cannot wear theme longer than 10-20 minutes without getting a head ache. Also due to their weight, they also constantly sliding off my nose and have to be adjusted. So not the greatest buy on my part. Heavy"
3.0,A cheap copy of a Citizen pro master diver. Works alright for now but had to change the band because the one that was on there was just too cheap looking and feeling. I'm pretty sure the watch case is made of plastic.
3.0,Cute but makes me look pregnant. Not fitted enough around the top.
3.0,"This is too large of a piece for me to wear. it covers most of the ear. No worried, I will give it to a grandchild."
3.0,"Silicone band is comfortable, but hangs up on things and I finally quit wearing because I was always re-doing end keepers."
3.0,"Shirt is definitely a see-through. I got a medium to wear it baggy, but this is already baggy enough. I don't recommend sizing up. The lengths of sleeves are really awkward. Its too loose to be a roll up shirts, but too short to wear just like that.<br />The lengths of the front and the back are really different, to the extent that I felt it looked somewhat weird."
3.0,My bad for thinking this was a hand bag. To much for a shopping bag
3.0,The band seems to light
3.0,"I did not purchase these from Amazon, but still wanted to leave a review. These are super comfy, but I could only muster 3 stars because they are very bulky, lightweight, but bulky. They are also very roomy, too roomy for me even with both insoles in, and I wear a size 11 and don't have narrow feet. Lastly, they made my toes fall asleep. Overall, I think these would be great for the right feet, but they weren't for mine."
3.0,"Not as sturdy as I expected, but it hasn't failed yet."
3.0,"I thought it would be a bit bigger, but it is still really great quality!"
3.0,"The fit is fine, but it does look and feel a little cheap.  I gave it three stars cause at least there's pockets that fit and iPhone 10 in it."
3.0,I weigh 250 and am 5'7. After reading alot of reviews I got a 5x because I wanted it a little baggy and many people my size said go larger. It was HUGE on me :(
3.0,It could have been better described.  It fit great in the bottom half but the top half was really tight around the bust area.
3.0,"Nice bracelet,  the little ball came off"
3.0,The bracelet is really cute but the clasp comes open too easily. I've had it fall off several times.
3.0,"Product fits small. Size up.  The print is cute, the zipper adds an edgy touch. It's somewhat thin material."
3.0,"Enjoyed for one day, but now you be have to wiggle the wires by the batteries to make the lights barely flicker. Something is loose in the wiring, so unfortunately it doesn't light up anymore."
3.0,huge!
3.0,"Meh, its aright. don't pay too much if ur not sure about it."
3.0,"The neckline is a wide scoop and my bra straps peep out ... but I wear it with a contrasting tank top underneath and it looks okay. Nicely butt-covering, but the empire-style would look better if my chest were smaller. A very pretty, &#34;vintage&#34; style floral, though!"
3.0,Didn’t know the internal stitching was pink. Looked rather silly walking around the factory in it.
3.0,I contacted the seller who said it was too late to change the size even though the item was not  shipped. I was to return it in order to get the size changed. I gave the dress to my thirteen years old daughter.  The item runs small.
3.0,Pretty good quality but slightly tight elastic can get uncomfortable and I have thin calves
3.0,"These were purchased to be used for my circulation issues. My doctor said I needed to wear them every day. I missed 2 days out of 49 since these arrived. It was sad to see that the zipper broke on one of the pairs in just a short time of everyday use.<br /><br />The socks would also roll starting at the toe rolling back to the arch of my feet while wearing shoes. This made them most uncomfortable.<br /><br />Do I recommend them? NO!<br />No money saved buying these, even though the subscription compression socks would have cost $89. to $300. for a pair. If I have to buy these socks on a monthly bases due to poor quality... where is the savings."
3.0,They are very pretty but a little difficult to put in and my favs broke. I plan on using super glue though!
3.0,Beautiful pendants but cheap chains .
3.0,"I read the reviews and thought these would be great! Wrong answer,  not warm enough for a buffalo winter!"
3.0,"It doesn't look as nice as it does in the picture. In person it looks more cheaply made, but for the price I guess I shouldn't have expected much more. It did not fit my daughter's ear, so we had to return it. She really liked it (she's 10) but I expected a little more based on the picture."
3.0,The material not expected.
3.0,It's a bit pricey considering it does nothing.
3.0,Runs extremely small and had to return. Material was very nice.
3.0,"Love the top, is long enough to cover belly but the bottom is very tight around my legs and uncomfortable."
3.0,fabric is too thin.
3.0,"Before I had a chance to use them, the rubber pads on the temples fell off."
3.0,So cute but too big and wide
3.0,Kind of large
3.0,Loved these and is squat proof but after 4 washes there was holes in the seem:(
3.0,can't fingure out how to wear this.  It might be beyond tangles up or maybe I'm an idiot - something is not right here .  But I like hte idea of this
3.0,"Enjoyable designs, nice weight on the socks (heavy, but not thick), but way too short for men.  Advertised as typical mid-calf socks, but come not too far over ankles for average-sized guy."
3.0,"Loved the style and color.  The headpiece was big (which I loved), but the headband was a little loose so it did not stay on my head very well.  (If I looked down it slid down my forehead.)  Didn't love that the decorative part was pink and the headband was black, but it wasn't the end of the world."
3.0,"I had never heard of the Saxx brand until the opportunity to get these boxer briefs and a T shirt. In the end I come away finding them not my thing. I did come across them this past weekend in a major department store, so took some time to take a look at other items from the Saxx line. It’s an interesting idea and they look interesting, but in the end, I don’t think they’re my kind of thing. That doesn’t make them bad, just not for me. One thing I did “Miss” - thought going back into the product page - they are really a slim fit kind of thing. No where do I see them listed as such and I got my size, but they are REALLY tight and I’ll need to get some more weight off before they’ll fit right. They look cool - that black steak thing is a nice look. But wearing them - from what I COULD tell - remember they didn’t fit so didn’t have them on long or fully - but they did not seem like they would breath to me. That’s just a read from other experiences with boxer briefs. The pouch on the inside I never really got a true chance to try. But again, just did not seem like my kind of thing. In the end I personally was not a fan and to that end, give it the 3 stars. I think other larger guys are going to find a similar opinion. On the other hand, some guys may find these SAXX Men's Underwear – VIEWFINDER Boxer Briefs with Built-In BallPark Pouch Support great. It’ll be major personal opinion. Mine isn’t a good one..."
3.0,"These black socks are about as boring as socks get. No gold toe here, no red piping or stitching. They are, however, ideal for everyday use and are comfortable, breathable and appear to have the potential to be durable too.<br /><br />The cons? Excessive packaging. Each pair is individually wrapped in unrecyclable plastic film. And then all these individually wrapped socks are put into another plastic bag. Just way too much packaging.<br /><br />I am a big guy with big feet and these are decent socks. They are comfortable for all-day wear (which you should expect from any and every sock you buy), they have good elasticity at the cuff (not a given, so nice to find), and the heel appears to have some kind of reinforcement.<br /><br />I'm on the fence as to whether I'd buy them again. The packaging irks me and I'd prefer to support a product that doesn't produce trash on arrival. But the product itself is good, and good value, so if you're not irritated about the packaging, these are good workaday socks."
3.0,"This is a cute shirt, but I was hoping it was going to be longer, it does not go below the waist line. (I am a shorter person at 5 ft 4 in)"
3.0,Product was received damaged.  Very nice and cute purse no outside zipper.
3.0,This watch band is not for me. Its to bulky and very stiff. I have other bands like this that are very soft and stretchy. I wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,"Measurements on width is as described however very small length size. I m a 36, ordered a 38 just to be safe and still only made it to the first hole of the belt. Also the quality of the adjust ring is not the best."
3.0,"I love this watch, i brought 5 but you have to be careful because ono off them is in bad shape, it does not work ok"
3.0,"I love this watch, so pretty , and i got a lot of compliments, but now after 3 months of use, the strap broke :(<br />Is there a way to buy a new replacement"
3.0,This dress run small disappointing
3.0,cute and comfortable BUT very low and open on the breast- I'm a 36B and I use a safety pin for a little more coverage.
3.0,"pretty , but too small and too deep plunge"
3.0,Not too keen on this item
3.0,"They are all super cute but very cheap, obviously. I havent worn them all but for the money they are worth it."
3.0,"The gloves arrived quickly and do the job, but are a bit shorter than is best in this environment."
3.0,"Definitely not for anything more than a very light rain.... I wore it in a heavy rain last week and pretty much got soaked!  BUT, it does say in the description that it’s for light rain, so that’s my own fault....<br /><br />I gave three stars because the inside the jacket the fabric is unraveling at every seam and hem.... not where it affects the integrity of the jacket yet, but there’s all these loose strings inside that show when the jacket it open.  It just looks tacky and unfinished.... one extra turn of the fabric when sewing the hem and seams would have fixed the issue.<br /><br />All in all, it’s a decent rain jacket for very light rain showers...."
3.0,"Medallion is nice, but the lanyard (rope) seem cheep. It falls about where a 22 inch necklace will hit the chest. Gave this to my teenager who really liked it then he promptly gave it to a girl he met on the beach who liked it as well.  So I would say good for boys or girls."
3.0,"I thought the coloring on the mask would be more vibrant. The coloring is dull and not what I expected. They do provide the charcoal inserts for added protection but overall unsatisfied. Also, wanted to add that the mask's<br />stitching is in white. It makes no sense."
3.0,"Based upon my height and weight, the large was too big in every way."
3.0,"The magnets on the pockets are a little awkward to try and get to close. Would actually have preferred if they were just real buckles and straps. The handles on the top don't quite touch so it's almost impossible to use the button strap on the handles to lock them together. Overall, happy with the purchase. Material is good quality and it is definitely fashionable."
3.0,Band is always getting loose
3.0,"Accordng to most online bra calculators I measure as 36DD. Those are always too big. I was meaured professionally at a lingerie store 8 years ago and my best fit was a 34DD, but that was 3 kids ago. Based off of those measurements I've been trying 34DD, 36D, and 36DD bras and nothing fits right. So for his bra I thought I would tr a 36C and see what happened. unfortunately it didn't fit either. The cups were too big. I really like this bra however- the straps were wide and felt supportive. The cups were nice and firm. Overall, this looked like an attractive bra that was decent quality. Since then I was fitted using a Boob or Bust calculator which put me at a 30G so no wonder the 36C (or any of the other sizes I was trying) didn't fit. This bra doesn't come in that size or I would definitely retry it."
3.0,The top was too large. It was VERY THIN. Pretty color (yellow with blue details)
3.0,"Good fur quality, yet a bit too thick and a bit too  baggy for me . I didnt notice it was in an oversized design as I expected something to be figure hugging."
3.0,"The chokers with multiple strings on them don't really stay in place, it's a cool idea though."
3.0,Not a bad piece for product. Wish they were a little bit thicker.
3.0,"I expected way more than, what I received, It's not a door stopper. ."
3.0,Thin material nice for summer but ran small. Husband is a XXL. Needs a XXXL
3.0,They do their job as sunglasses as is in they block the sun. Flip up feature works fine they are not loose and wont open when you look down but not really practical for anything.  I bought the red shade and the world looked very cool through my eyes. Through other peoples eyes I must have looked pretty stupid. You have to have a big head for these to not look stupid on you. The lenses are huge. The sunglasses are bigger than I expected. I would wear them for a costume maybe. For the price your paying it is a good deal considering that it even comes with a carrying case. A very nice bonus. If you are looking to buy small John Lennon style sunglasses look somewhere else.
3.0,"nice looking but feel very cheap, as expected"
3.0,The sizes are larger than described. They were so cheap it's not worth it to return. If I had the right size they would be a good deal for the money.
3.0,"Very pretty and exactly as described but too delicate wire it once and it broke and not in way can be fixed, very disappointed"
3.0,it's okay in quality and reasonable per the price.
3.0,"Fits smaller than expected and cheaper quality than anticipated, but got here a day early and looks nice. I could crash diet for a few weeks and it'll fit ok. I don't need it till the second week of November, so I have some time to fit into it. Over all not the best experience I've had buying costumes online but not the worst either."
3.0,"Nice shirt but small.<br /><br />I have a small 8 year old.  Size 8 in regular shirts is usually slightly big.  Ordered a size 10 hoping it would fit next fall; should have ordered two sizes larger.  If my son didn't need the shirt for a performance he's in next week, I would have returned it.  He will likely get only one wear  out of it.  Other the sizing issue, it seems to be a great shirt.  Material is soft.  Shirt seems well made."
3.0,"I didn't like the way the banding was at the bottom or at the wrists. It didn't fit the way it is pictured. It pulled it in tighter. Otherwise, I would have loved it."
3.0,When they say XL oversized I guess the really meant it.  It was too big for my face .  I returned them.  Not good for petite faces.
3.0,This jumpsuit is not for me.
3.0,"The top and bottom pendents are very ugly and cheap, won't wear those.  I like the middle pendent and the chains. Very cheap."
3.0,Price is Terrific. 3 Star rating is for the small size.
3.0,It should be there is a plastic box to protect the watch in the cartoon<br />But in this item there is plastic box
3.0,"I’ve been collecting, repairing, and assembling mechanical watches for a few decades, give or take. When I saw this bracelet, I figured it was worth a try, since the price was right and I always have a dive watch or two looking for a bracelet.<br /><br />These bracelets have hollow end links, which is both good and bad. It’s good, because the end links can usually be adjusted to fit most watches. It’s bad, because the bracelet will usually need some fiddling before it looks good or fits perfectly. In this case I had to bend out the little tabs that hold the spring bar in place in order to get the end link far enough into the lugs that the spring bar would snap into the holes. I scratched one of the end links while bending it to fit. This watch will probably get enough nicks and bruises that I don’t really care, but be aware that some caution is required to avoid scratching the finish on this (or most) bracelets.<br /><br />Also, the clasp didn’t want to open or close properly. I think the release button was sticking and just needed a couple drops of oil before it worked correctly. Now it’s fine and snaps shut with a satisfying “click.”<br /><br />Now that it’s been adjusted and lubricated, the bracelet looks pretty good. The adjustments I had to make are fairly common for a low-priced watch bracelet; generally, this one is well-made for the price. I think it’s a generic product, so you’ll probably see similar bracelets sold under different brand names. Just be aware that you’re likely to have to tinker with it a bit to get it to fit and work properly."
3.0,Loose fit if you normally wear a large.
3.0,Wool is a little thinner than expected and not very wind resistant on own but fits well and easily with other clothes either over or under it
3.0,"It was bigger than I thought, l returned it."
3.0,I marked this “fit as expected” because it’s made to fit a body shape similar to the Kardashians...or the model in their photos. I bought the Medium and I’ll have to take it in in the hips as there’s a good 1.5-2 inches of fabric that my body simply doesn’t need! Other than that it fit just fine and I’m  5’4” 110lb and 36DD! I bought it as the starting point of a Princess Tigerlily costume so itll suit my purpose perfectly with minor adjustments.
3.0,"I usually get xl shirts because i like to have the extra space for my chest, the shirt is loose fitting however goes half way up stomach when lifting up arms. That shouldnt happen when the shirt is up a size from normal.<br />The string that is there to make a bow is just way too long as well."
3.0,"For the price it is alright, super cute and clean not just really cheaply made, I would be afraid to wash it.."
3.0,Looks great on but when working out in it doing sqauts they are see through
3.0,Ring is pretty but uncomfortable.
3.0,Pieces have fallen out.
3.0,It’s extremely well made but the length is too short.
3.0,would be better if it was magnetic clip
3.0,It's an ok buy...looks better in the picture.
3.0,"Been trying it on for 2 weeks now with my &#34;Merica&#34; buckle. Takes a little getting used to, but I'm diggin it.<br />Would be nice if we had the option to order the belt with special buckle permanently attached. Just a thought.."
3.0,I thought this was going to be actual goodies material. But it's more like a jersey kinda material. So it is best wore during the spring time.
3.0,"The dress was very lovely and stitched well. It was a little small on me, but still wearable. The description was correct. Asian sizes run small. All the instructions come in Japanese or Chinese for washing instructions so I'm not sure how to care for it. If they had washing instructions it would be great."
3.0,"Firstly, I would like to say that I had a great deal of trouble dealing with this company. I ordered this item on May 22nd and was told I would receive it by June 3rd at the latest. It was almost June 3rd by the time I received a notice saying the necklace was not in stock, even though it was labeled In Stock on the page when I purchased it. I was given the option to take a refund or to wait a week and have it shipped out. Being that I felt so strongly about this necklace, I chose to wait the week. Time passed, and by June 12th I still hadn't heard anything as to the status of my order. I wrote the company and waited for a response. When I finally got one, I wasn't very pleased with the helpfulness or civility factors, and they still were not very informative. It was only later when I saw an email stating my order had finally shipped that I got any information about it. The entire next week I tried to track my shipment with no success. It arrived today, June 20th - 17 days later than promised. For this reason I will never do business with this company again. That being said, the swan pendant itself is very nice. The first thing to keep in mind is that, if you're looking for something somewhat substantial, this really isn't it. The height of the swan is only about two pinky tip widths, which is okay, but I did think it would be a bit bigger. Also, while I realize the diamond accents would have to be extremely small, they don't look the same as in the picture - the wing might as well just be bumpy sterling silver, as there is no sparkle, and the bumps between the diamond accents are far more noticeable than the accents. Overall a very nice necklace that I am sure to enjoy, but I was beyond turned off by the company's demeanor and will never be shopping with them again."
3.0,fit was a little funny...large thru middle
3.0,The leg opening is Too small
3.0,This little guy is so cute and really expensive looking.  He just wouldn't hang straight on a chain because the the clasp wasn't centered when he was made in production.  I'm definitely going to get another one and will update my review then.
3.0,"The shirt is cute, I usually have no problem with a medium, so I'd say it's on the small side."
3.0,I was excited to try these for the price but you get what you pay for because after wearing it for a month I lost all of them they fall off out of no where.
3.0,They get off easily of feet. I would not buy again
3.0,"Breaks easy, you have to be very careful. But arrived as advertised."
3.0,"Much longer than expected but fit around the waist was accurate.  The skirt pictured on the model is much shorter even when I tried to hike it up and and create more layers it still didn't look right. I also brought the skirt way above my natural waist, almost to the bra line. It is cute but I will have to take it to alterations and have about 5 or so inches taken off. I'm 5'3"" and I weigh 147lbs.  I got the large."
3.0,Awkward fit!!
3.0,"it's okay but it ripped on the side after one wear, it's very thin and a bit smaller than i expected."
3.0,"It’s OK for the price, but you can tell that it won’t last too long.  The material feels very cheap"
3.0,"This dress ran a bit large, looked frumpy when on. It also came very wrinkled and looked pre-work. The top hung down awkwardly and would need to be fastened to be able to wear in public. This was not for lack of filling it out either. Had to return."
3.0,"To start, genuine leather should not be used for there selling point.  At the top of the bracelet..(if's an iffy type leather, if at all), stiff feel at first wear, pliable at 6th n 7th wear.  Snaps n stitching placement are passing, (large)  it's 1 1/2 inch, in with, works for me (having a small wrist).  Hoped the bracelet would be genuine leather (not leather like) it smells like leather..!! does that count..??!!"
3.0,"These polarized sunglasses came well packaged with a nice pinch top case. This aviator style has a very masculine look, and they are, indeed, oversized. If you like large frames, you'll love these. Get yourself a pair of cheap sunglasses."
3.0,The string is a little annoying. I might cut it off
3.0,"Bought these a couple of months ago. I like the cozy feel to them, specially on cold days. What I don't like is the soft sole, you can't go outside with these. Yeah! I know what you're thinking... why on earth would you go out with these? Well, if you're going to receive a pizza in your garage or go for the newspaper your feet will definitely hurt, or if its a rainy day, the soles are no good for that, but other than that they are really nice for wearing at home."
3.0,This is way to big if you need a large order a medium
3.0,"Was hoping it would be a little larger, maybe an 3x next time as Chinese sizes are always smaller on Americans"
3.0,These bags are light weight but feel more like panty hose material than soft cloth.
3.0,"All my rings are Size 7 like this one.<br /><br />But: this ring is way too small!!!! It can be Size 5 or 6?!<br /><br />Otherwise it is nice, shiny, looks like a real wedding ring. I did buy it for regular use only. I was a bit shocked."
3.0,Like the shirt but quality not great
3.0,"I followed the size chart and it ended up being too big. I looked like a frumpy soccer Mom, which is fine if that's who you are, but I am a single young lady and unfortunately this dress looked better on the rack."
3.0,the shoes didn't fit as expected
3.0,The blouse is shorter than what is shown on the picture. It's about 3 inches below the waist.
3.0,Looks nice but is not as adjustable as the description suggests.
3.0,Was hoping it didn't look really cheap but it does.  Wasn't expecting fine jewelry but was hoping it was a bit nicer.  It arrived on time and in good condition.
3.0,Light weight good to wear under a blazer or cardigan
3.0,"I was looking for a gym backpack that had separate compartments for shoes and deep pockets for shower accessories and this looked like it would fit the bill. It comes close, but in everyday use (5 days a week), it's short comings became apparent over a few months:<br />1) Shoe pockets can barely fit size 11 wide trainers<br />2) Material isn't even water resistant -- walking 4 blocks in the rain was enough to saturate the material and water leaked through getting my dress clothes and shoes pretty wet and soggy. (Material is thin and not rubber backed like my Targus backpack)<br />3) Bottom side of pack is not reinforced so that just by setting it down and picking up on the sidewalk while waiting for the bus, has already made the piping and bottom layer thread bare.<br />4) Main compartment is a triangle, that its widest point still will not allow a pair of dress pants folded over twice to fit laying flat and must be rolled on either side.<br />5) Main compartment does not have any zippers on any of the three sides so it is basically a top-loading duffle bag which means alot of digging trying to retrieve items.<br />I think this would be ideal for carrying sports gear to games and workouts at the park or gym with just casual clothes that can be rolled and you wouldn't mind getting wet if you get caught in a shower"
3.0,I didn't like how the bottom end was basically just a small rubber band. I was too afraid it would fall off so I didn't use it much.
3.0,Loved it but lost it as they slid off my shirt the first day…wish they would stay in.
3.0,Good quality just don’t really like how stiff they are
3.0,Like the front graphics but the back put the horse at the bottom where it gets tucked in. Didn’t realize this was not a cotton type material. So pay attention to the material description. It’s a medium weight rayon maybe?  No label in the shirt for material. And size runs big!  I’m typically medium but shoulda ordered small.
3.0,My first time using the purse the flower and charm came off. Other than that I like it.
3.0,"I was excited to find watch bands that are stretchy like this and are Christmas themed. That’s a difficult combination to find. I have worn one band for the 5 days and it has faded without any effort. I haven’t showered while wearing the watch band. I haven’t swam while wearing it. I haven’t even sweat while wearing it yet. I’ve done no activities that would cause it to fade so easily. The only thing I can think of is that it was cheaply printed. Maybe I got a bad band. I’ll be trying the other two soon to see how they hold up. If they do the same, the review will stay the same. If they work well, I’ll update the review. The sad part is that I ordered two sets. One for myself and another for a Christmas gift. I hope the set I give as a gift keep their color a little longer."
3.0,Really nice colors but it’s too loose. I normally wear a gaiter over my mask. This one keeps sliding off
3.0,A little small but I wore it under some high waisted shorts and it worked perfectly👍🏻
3.0,Nice design but super long
3.0,It’s definitely a different type of jacket.  More of a light sweater almost burlap material.  Pockets are fake but I am keeping it as it’s a good type of throw on for the office.
3.0,Didn't look good on me by I have a tummy pouch and its very form fitting. If I had a flatter tummy it would be more flattering. Top was a little big for my 42D boobs. I purchased an XXL and unfortunately will be returning it.
3.0,If you have glare after cataract surgery these glasses will not help sole the problem for night driving.
3.0,"Dear Ritche,<br /><br />Please do not fold the Leather NATO strap in your packaging. When I got the strap, the leather has a big crease on it. That's about the only complaint I have for this strap. It's comfortable and leather feels good compared to the other leather straps."
3.0,Material to thick
3.0,Comfy but too sheer. No tummy control too.
3.0,This is a neckless and the string was not long enough to go over the head and had to be cut and retied.  Otherwise it was ok but very much a disappointment to have to work on it before it could even be worn.
3.0,I think overall it may have worked out well. I didn't get a chance to try it because I ended up returning mine. It ran big. I'm 5'7&#34; and about 155 and the length of the large was too long. I endes up sticking to my waist trainer.
3.0,"It looks really nice, but you can't wear it for more then a few hours at a time because it cuts into your ear.<br />You can only wear it on your left ear, I thought it was for the right. Not a big deal, but I need to use the space up so..<br />Oh! I ordered it in silver and got it in a goldish color instead. I ended up liking it, but still not what I ordered."
3.0,I bought a large but they are tight n I'm 160lbs shoulda got xlarge
3.0,It's difficult to get on my belt loop
3.0,cheap material!
3.0,Not cotton or XXX-Lg
3.0,"Bigger then expected for daughter, tho worked out nicely for my partner, he likes them."
3.0,"Nice suit, but too big."
3.0,The product is not as comfortable as their yoga pants and they run small.
3.0,I like the hardware securing the post but the hoops themselves seem to stretch a bit when you release the backing of the post. I suspect over time this may cause a stone or two to fall out. Maybe. Only time will tell. They look great for now.
3.0,The color said Lime and the picture isn't as Yellow as it actually is.  Lemon is a better description for the dress I received.<br />The fit is great - it's just the color isn't what I was expecting.
3.0,Love all rose gold
3.0,They do not fit as well
3.0,This material is very see through and thin. 'I'll have to wear a tank or something underneath.  Seems to run large in size.  Very comfortable
3.0,It was purchased to replace a similar size wallet.  It won't fit basic business cards in it and the credit cards are very crammed in there.  It may stretch but that wasn't the goal.
3.0,Can't wear them but they look pretty. Gave them to my daughter she likes them.
3.0,not the best!
3.0,Fabric isnt as soft as I would like
3.0,They are very small but nice
3.0,the bracelet is too big and it doesnt stay in place
3.0,Nice shorts but I was hoping for better quality for the price
3.0,Hook is to loose so it falls off constantly. Scratches easily.
3.0,The fabric is not great quality and shorter than it appears but fit is good.
3.0,A little too sheer for me. Will be ok under jacket or over tank top
3.0,It's not tight around the waist
3.0,"This is nice material,  however the grain is up and down, not sideways. There is absolutely NO give or stretch sideways. I'm a little concerned that it may stretch in length in time. If you like your shirts a little lose or are wanting some sideways stretch, you may want to consider ordering a size up."
3.0,Runs a bit small. Go a size up.
3.0,"Ok product, needed new batteries as soon as we opened it. But if you got a kid or adult addicted to Fortnite then this is a good buy. Pin pulls out and handle makes the Granade play sound and light up."
3.0,Cute but too narrow
3.0,"Quality is great, solid build. Big throwback is the size, Im used to big watches but this one was too much.<br /><br />The main reason I bought it is because I wanted both an analog and a digital display. I was expecting that the digital one would be bigger than it is for the size of the watch."
3.0,"It's definitely larger than I thought, but it is definitely funky looking and cute. Totally worth the money!"
3.0,"I purchased this t-shirt because of the message it has printed on it. As item arrives,  it is so pretty, very colorful, material is very soft and comfortable and as I wore it, I did receive many compliments. What I did noticed was that in the first wash ( and I did wash it on delicate cycle), the black print got discolored. It doesn't have that vibrant black bold color any more."
3.0,They feel like they are straight from China. Very lightweight and flimsy. Have not tried them with our 2 1/2 year old yet but we have ordered other glasses from other suppliers that feel like much better quality. These probably cost $0.25 to make!
3.0,Fell apart right off my wrist within a week or 2 after purchase. Still finding pieces now and then... :/ Very pretty tho..
3.0,"I am still deciding whether I should return it or live with the shortfalls. The band itself looks nice and makes the Fitbit look more like a watch. In my opinion the butterfly clasp makes it easier to put on and take off than the original Fitbit band. I also had an allergic reaction to the original Fitbit band, but have not had a problem with this one. However, there are some significant cons. 1. Where the band hooks into the Fitbit will not fully engage. The band stays on but it can be wiggled off pretty easily, unlike the original Fitbit band. 2. One side of the butterfly clasp does not always close completely so the band will randomly open. I don't think that it would be able to fall off, but it does create an annoyance. 3. I got the black band and within a few hours of wearing it, some discoloration has occurred at the clasp. I don't think this would happen with the silver color. The discoloration is not a big deal to me, since it's mostly in an unnoticeable area. If I wasn't allergic to the original band, I would probably return this one but for now I am still weighing the pros and cons."
3.0,I love this shirt because it has pockets that is the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars because soon after I got it the buttons started falling off and after 1 washing it had holes in the seems and pockets. But I do have to say I think it looks better without the buttons and it is my favorite shirt
3.0,"They look like good quality sports bras and I love the colors. I looked for my bra size listed under each of this brands sizes until I found the size showing my bra size indicating this was the size I needed. I ordered that size and received them just now. I love the colors and was so excited to wear them. I tried it on right away! My excitement turned to being majorly bummed out because there was no way these were going to fit. I tried one on and had major spillage on the side and over the top. Needless to say it did not hold my girls in. Not only did this bra not hold my girls in but there was absolutely no support in holding them up. Felt like I wasn't even wearing a bra, which is a good thing as far as comfort goes, but very negative when need the support and lift out of a bra. I think it was just too stretchy of a material or how it was made. In order to get the support needed I felt like I would have to size down about 5 or so sizes but to get everything to fit inside the bra I would need to go up a size or two. Returning because no way I can make these work for what I wanted to use them for which is just lounging around the house and doing some light yard work. #biggirlsproblem #bigbust I hate looking for bras because they are either ugly or don’t fit right. Just because I have larger breasts doesn’t mean I don’t want my bras to be as sexy or fit as someone who is an A,B or C cup. #dreamsofhavingareduction"
3.0,"My daughter loves it.  It does run a bit small, but not bad for the price."
3.0,A little on the small side..bought a large and it fits more like a shrug
3.0,"This is your standard printed image fabric.  I love these normally as the image is literally in the fabric so there isn’t any degrading of the image over time.  The problem with this design is it appears to be that they stretch the image in some areas resulting in a very blurry image, particularly on the sleeves.  I think it is still worth it if you are wearing it for non-special occasions.  If you want to wear it for cosplay, it will likely not meet your standards."
3.0,Runs small. I went by their chart and I should of went up a size.
3.0,The pads are so annoying. They moved all over the place. Found a pad in the back of the bra.
3.0,I have small hands and the y were a little to small for me.
3.0,Very flattering for any shape and size even helps keep your tummy in
3.0,Very large. The top has insanely long straps
3.0,"I like this dress, but the material is a little odd mixed together."
3.0,"I ordered the light gray shirt and received a shirt that was not light gray but something between brown and lavender. Not a bad color, but not what I needed. The fabric was a strange, coarse texture, not the smooth fabric in the photo. The collar also did not hang right. Returned the shirt."
3.0,I am a size 10 and the large is way too tight in the waist and thighs
3.0,"Runs small<br />Cute , quality ok<br />Definitely a jr. size"
3.0,Disappointed that the image was not the same clarity/size for my 0G. Hard to see and nothing like the picture
3.0,"Fabric is pretty thin with no stretch BUT RUNS TRUE to size. Could’ve been made a lot nicer, but for the price works. Looks better on than in package"
3.0,"Way too long, would like to be shorter"
3.0,Delivery was fast ! I gave this 3 stars because this dress I got is ROSE GOLD and the picture shown is a GOLD dress. Amazon even suggested a shoe to go with the dress but I'm glad I didn't order it because the colors would of been off. Orient irder the show because it's like $ 100 bucks and I had planed on making my own shoe to match the dress.  I have attracted pix as well.<br /><br />I'm 5'9 this dress is for shorter people the split on the front is too high. I have no idea how I'm going to sit down with out feeling my like my goodies are on display. I have butt and hips with a small waist. This dress does not cling to your body. It's sequin dress so naturally it's itchy but expected. Overall good dress. I was disappointed in the color because I was customizing a heel and clutch to go with it and now I have to do something different.<br /><br />Hopefully this was helpful.
3.0,Love the material the stitching is very well the clasp is extremely  strong. The picture shows the bad I use it for eyeglasses never over bent lid just bend enough to  put glasses inside but at just over a month the left corner stress line is spreading. So if you use it for sunglasses and only need to open once in awhile then this is  your case but for every day use for  eyeglasses no don't recommend it.
3.0,Cute top but the applique is falling off. Disappointing.
3.0,"The items I checked as 'I loved it' were just what I was looking for in color,fit and attractiveness.The other items were just ok . The<br /> skirts  needed more material in the hips."
3.0,"I bought this dress to attend a wedding. In the picture the dress was beautiful and everything. I received the dress and it's as described however, the lace/ribbon for the corset back was never sent. How am I supposed to wear the dress now? I spent almost $70 I don't think I should have to go out and purchase ribbon. I'm disappointed and a bit upset as I can't really try it on to see if it fits or anything right now."
3.0,Looks great but doesn't fit well. I wear a 34 C and it's way too small!
3.0,"I'm not sure if I purchased the wrong size, or if I just don't have the chest to fill out this dress but something is off.  It's too loose in the chest area but everything else seems to fit fine. Also, this dress would require you to wear a little chicken cultet bra if you don't want any straps showing. It's almost impossible to wear a regular bra or even strapless bra with this dress (trust me, I tried)"
3.0,Very comfortable when comparing to most other face masks. I work in the cold weather at a carwash so this is a MUST. A lot of these masks make your face very itchy but not this one. The price to me was a little pricey other which is why it didn't get 5 stars other than that it worked good the 1st time I used it.
3.0,"The pocket watch and necklace came, no ring though. On top of that the watch is alright and the necklace is pretty short but i'm decently pleased otherwise."
3.0,Very dark
3.0,I would like to change the size
3.0,I loved this blouse at first. The style is nice and so is the embroidery. The material is synthetic and not warm weather friendly. The blouse fit me everywhere except the shoulders. They were cut so narrow that part of the sleeve rested on my shoulder. Because of the tug in my underarm this was sooo uncomfortable. This definitely went back
3.0,The quality is wonderful - but they fit too snug.  I returned them.  They barely reached the bottom of my hand and my fingers felt a bit too snug inside.  Almost like they were a child's glove.  I have average size hands - I am 5 ft. 5 in. and weigh about 110 pounds. But they were very warm and soft.  Just small for me.
3.0,"These are good enough, but all three shirts fit differently. Also, they are shorter in length than they appear. As you work out the material will slip and slide upwards or rotate around the body. The arms on the purple one are shorter than the other 2 pairs. I give 3 stars because they are good enough, but  not the quality I believed them to be."
3.0,don't last as long as my old scarf
3.0,"Tried the Smart Wool and Icebreakers, and I think these fit the best, held their shape the best, and were always comfortable. Not much pilling either, I'd rank them a close second to the Icebreakers in that regard. They lasted about 20 to 25 wearings before a hole appeared. I'm not sure if that's good or bad, I'll just say that of the three, these wore out the fastest."
3.0,"I bought two Bondi bands. I was excited after reading  some of the reviews. However, after receiving it I was disappointed by the quality: thin,  light, flimsy. Material feels cheap for the price."
3.0,The string came out loose and came apart!
3.0,I really liked this shapewear top but it was too small : (
3.0,Nice but definitely have to wear shorts under lol if not well you will flash people lmao  but fits fine I'm 2XL and got this in 3XL good choice.
3.0,Cheaply made.  No one believed I had gold teeth.
3.0,"Bought to help secure a vintage trailer. The unit seems beefy, but I do worry about the fairly flimsy metal cover protecting the crank mechanism - if a thief were able to pry that open (looks like all they'd need is a small pry bar) then they could easily access the mechanism that causes the jaws to open and close. As others have said, this is more a DETERRENT than a true preventative measure, but with it's imposing, yellow presence it definitely sends a warning to would-be thieves. As it is, I'm glad I also paired this unit with a tongue lock mechanism - I'd be nervous relying on this unit alone.<br /><br />One other thing: if you have nice wheels then you'll probably want to put a thick piece of duct tape over the long, protruding bolt that affixes the wheel nut shield to the jaws. The bottom end of that bolt rubs against the center of my wheel, and would definitely scratch it, so I covered it. Depending on your fitment, you might actually want to trim that bolt with a cut-off wheel, as it may keep the shield from making a nice, tight fit against the center of the wheel."
3.0,"The nubs on these sandals are harder than I expected, and therefore not as comfy.  I did yard in them, I wouldn't be able to tolerate walking the dog in these sandals.  Regular $3 flip flops yes, but not these.<br /><br />They do keep your foot off the sandal, if you are in need of dry feet in a moist environment."
3.0,Order a size smaller really great quality though
3.0,For the price it’s a great deal.  I should have paid closer attention to the thickness of the watch.
3.0,It fits nicely. I bought it to wear with a sundress that is cut a bit low under the arms.
3.0,Everything was good except the marijuana leaf on the back of the hat. I was NOT impressed
3.0,"Cute, but cheap quality. The clasps break easily."
3.0,"Had to return because I sized up and they ended up too large (I am a size six, usually a medium but bought the large).  I could tell the product was good quality and can't beat the price."
3.0,Looks cheap when you get it
3.0,"Nice, but the wood is much lighter than appears online."
3.0,Its a bit small and I got a 4XL this is more like a 2XL at the top comfy tho
3.0,"The suit is still really cute--but like other reviewers, the sizing difference between the top and bottom is not proportionate. For being plus size, you would think the top would have ANY sort of structure or support, it does not. Knowing how the straps were, I thought I had extremely low expectations--but I was still disappointed by them. The tension of the strap didn't seem to be due to sizing but due to poor construction of the garment. The top, though tight in areas still felt formless--almost like how your boobs feel in a sports bra...but instead there's NO support and straps that make you feel the necessity to contemplate how much you want to risk accidentally exposing either--the top/bottom of one/both of your breasts (dealers pick).<br /><br />The bottoms were cute and fit wonderfully, in a cruel twist of fate.<br /><br />Tldr: Top fits weird with no support, especially with bigger boobs. Potential unwanted flashing. The bottoms were great."
3.0,"When I received my necklace, it was super cute and the perfect size! I wore it for about a month (taking it off to shower) but when I took it off one day, the chain snapped. This necklace doesn't tarnish, but I would suggest buying an alternative chain for the pendant."
3.0,"Not my favorite pair of sunglasses. I thought the tint would be as dark as the other pair of sunglasses I bought from SojoS. Alas, they were not that dark at all. The design is cute in person as it is here. Perhaps if the tint was darker I would like them more. For now they're my back up pair."
3.0,I used the charm for a prom but it didn’t adjust easily
3.0,"The fabric is extremely cheaply made,but the print is very high quality.I just received the hoodie yesterday and I saw a hole on one of the sides.I will  be returning this one unfortunately."
3.0,"Nice shirt, but I ordered a 3x as I'm plus sized.  However, the size it actually is more like a large.  I had to give it to my daughter which it fits her perfectly.  Defiantly not a plus sized shirt.  I gave 3 stars because it is a nice shirt and my daughter loves it."
3.0,"If you’re tall and prepared to stand with one leg crooked out like in the picture all the time, you might like these pants. Otherwise, they’re just an odd shape. They’re like a voluminous A-line skirt with an inseam. I have several pairs of wide leg, high-waisted pants that I love, and I was excited to add this beautiful persimmon color to my collection, but they’re not going to work for me. These aren’t wide leg; they are extra long culottes.<br />Pros: nice color, lightweight breathable fabric with a little stretch (but not stretchy), wide waist band<br />Cons: a little tight on my tummy (but I have a big tummy), waaay too wide at the ankles, way too long for me. Also, the fabric’s a little see-through for me.<br />For reference, I’m 5’4” and could easily cut several inches off the bottom. I’m trying to decide if I want to return them or hem them, because the flared out bottom could be removed, maybe, and I’d have actual wide legs."
3.0,I personally felt the fabric was a little thin- I am 5’8” and normally get a size large and this shirt did not hang on my the way I was expecting it too. I didn’t like it with jeans and it wasn’t long enough to wear with leggings- if it was shorter or I was shorter it probably would have fit better.
3.0,Good quality but wayyyy too small not for women with curves.
3.0,The material was not sweater like- more cotton.
3.0,Got these for my granddaughter for Christmas. She doesn’t like them at all. She said they are uncomfortable and feels like she has a Diaper on. The metal is kind of spongy.
3.0,One of the charms broke the next day
3.0,When you buy this you know that you aren't buying a quality piece of jewelry and not to be trite but it is what it is. Cute enough but a little small.
3.0,Love the color of the lens. When I try them on it was a bit small fit.
3.0,"Fits ok, tears easily at seems"
3.0,"Cute in style; however, I thought their clothing was a 3xxx in &#34;American Size&#34; but its mainly for &#34;Asian Size&#34; women. Dress did not fit even a half of me and nor do they carry &#34;American Sizes&#34;, such as 1x, 2xx, 3xxx. Guess I should have read the labels more carefully."
3.0,order to small of size
3.0,It’s a great concept but it’s shockingly small. It was too tight to get over my 4 year olds head.
3.0,These lasted about 10 months with reular useage ans washing. bumped up to three stars because it fits my cash flow allowance.
3.0,Very long delivery time and appear to be handmade.  Some small defects but overall okay.
3.0,I like the look and style. However after one use the band wholes strayed to rip. After 3-4 wear the band.....it looks like I have worn the watch for years . It appears that it’s a cheap bank quality. It dosent appear thatbit will last very long before looking to wore out to wear. Bummer
3.0,it was ok didn't fit like I expected not tight enough.
3.0,The product came folded and I'm having a difficult time getting the memory of the folds to disappear. The flower doesn't seem to be as bright either...looks better in the pix in my opinion
3.0,Colors are not as pictured. They are more muted. Definitely disappointed. I wanted a nice spring colors
3.0,Seems a  nice enough band but it doesn't match the pictures.
3.0,"Beware, for me these were very small. The wrap around wire has to be opened all the way nearly to wrap so they don't stay on. I'm going to pass them to a little girl."
3.0,Feels like a large
3.0,"I purchased this to be able to pluck my eyebrows since I can no longer see stray eyebrow hairs up close, even with a magnifying mirror.  These glasses sort of help but it is still difficult to see to pluck tiny hairs."
3.0,Super small couldn’t even fit the pencil case
3.0,Purchased for a dance recital. Perfect fit
3.0,"Loved the color, but had it 1 week and the little rivets started coming off. Will not buy again."
3.0,Very basic quality dress.. No stretch in the cloth at all.. Going back!
3.0,The dress was ok for the price. It was a bit large so I had to return. I am bout 117lbs and usually wear a small
3.0,"It was too big for my face but it is really cute and recieved many compliments. However, the most important part, which is the filter, could not cover my mouth because it's just too big for my face. I had to fold and tuck in the bottom half in order to use it appropriately."
3.0,Too big at the top. Sleeve openings too wide. The rest of the dress fits nicely. Might be returning.
3.0,Run very small didn't fit my  in between size 6.5 To 7 daughter. ( I bought in a 6.5 too) she could not even get her foot in...  they look adorable in brown and black color. So just order a size up!!!
3.0,Very flowing... kind of warm when moving a lot.<br />The bottom edge is not hemmed and thus is easy to adjust if too long.
3.0,"my daughter-n-law has a small head, but she liked the color"
3.0,The top fit true to the size. But the bottoms are wayyy too large.
3.0,"Looks very cute and fits nice, but have to be careful and handle carefully. Stitch seams unraveling after first try on."
3.0,"I finally got my hands on this bag, decent quality, nice design. But the uber gold hardware kills me. I was hoping the hardware wouldn't be so gold, but it is. I'm sure I'll wear thr bag, just not as much as I'd love to. The bag was exactly as described and shown."
3.0,Seems very cheap!  I'm sorry I ordered this.<br />It clings to your body and looks nothing like the picture of it.
3.0,Cute dress but it was too large at the top. I have large hips so I got the 2x but my top could not fill it out. The dress was sliding off my shoulders.
3.0,"Nice material, soft but runs small."
3.0,"The pair of glasses is OK, however they are a little bulky"
3.0,"I was hoping to love this and I ended up returning it. Keep in mind I'm an A cup so there isn't much on top for me to expose or push it out with, but the gap in the middle was HUGE - like, uncomfortably huge. This dress is cute overall and if you can find a way to sew up or fix the size of the gap, it's probably a great purchase. Disappointed overall."
3.0,"Dress pattern is beautiful and very stretchy, but very see through and pattern seems to turn white if it stretches to much, Buy 2 sizes bigger."
3.0,"It is very pretty, but it is a heavy. I didn't expect it to be so bulky, when the description says it is comfort fit . I cannot wear it all day."
3.0,Very nice watch for our daughter. Keeps time well. Only issue is some condensation...even after placing the watch in rice for several days.
3.0,Ordered 2 sizes and 3 sizes up and still to small ;-(
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:f87908f3c5ed291d72356223eb49c320]] Thank you for the credit of Mama Bear but I still need a Papa Bear hat, please advise."
3.0,"The fit is perfect. The quality is pretty terrible. I pulled it out of the package and found a six inch hole on the inside. It hadn't been sewn. Other wise, it's great!!"
3.0,There is zero give in the lace in the bodice- In my opinion the lace in the bodice also has a chunky texture to it- giving it a &#34;your grandmas curtains&#34; feel- it was returned
3.0,I don't like that it low profile (the extra part goes under the belt instead of over) but it does look nice. Not sure how durable it is but so far so good.
3.0,backing to small
3.0,"These socks are VERY SMall. I would say for a 3 or 4 year old. Hearts are pink,"
3.0,C++
3.0,"Some of the socks fit well, others he can get on just barely.  Still others would not even go all the way on his heel.  Maybe half fit correctly."
3.0,"Cute hat, it fits VERY snug, I’m trying to wear it in to stretch it out. Mine also did not come with the string to adjust the size, FYI"
3.0,This is a heavy weight hooded bathrobe. It fits great and my husband especially wanted one with a hood.  I would not call it luxurious. I was disappointed that  the material  was so rough. I was expecting it so be soft since it read luxurious. It was better after I washed it. My husband loves it though.
3.0,"I gave this to my wife, it runs small"
3.0,"These sandals are a copy of the original style…look similar—sole is hard, does not bend—toe loop wide. Good for slippers."
3.0,"This necklace arrived today, I purchased it for a Christmas gift for our daughter in-law. I am pretty disappointed in the quality and the font used for the names it iso small you need a magnifying glass to make them out. I am not wanting to give it to her now it looks kinda cheesy. I would not recommend purchasing this necklace it will be a disappointment. It was expensive for what it is."
3.0,"I am small to medium and ordered x large, my arms are extremely short, the length of the arms is to short for me (that is a 1st ever!), it is stretchy material, looks ok, warm, soft."
3.0,Very cheaply made. There were bubbles where it was fixing to chip off. But it did looke like the pic and it wasnt like i pid an awful lot for it.
3.0,Light on ears.
3.0,"Cute enough, color is a bit off but for a cheap shirt it's ok for running around on Saturday. Ordered and XL and is slightly large but arms run short so I wouldn't size down...I'm only 5'4"" so sleeves shouldn't run short but you get what you pay for."
3.0,I'm 5'7&quot; 150. This is stretchy but too short for most. I trimmed off the scallop on the top front (only about an inch or so) and use it as a skirt for my bee costume. It is still a cute short skirt. Works perfect. Also there is a small stinger attached to the rear which isn't shown in photo. I will wear a sexy black top and heels. If I get brave I will attach a photo.
3.0,"Adorable little shirt, but I ended up returning because it was too narrow for my very skinny 3 year old. And dog design started at his belly button... just didn't look right."
3.0,Seller should link a guide (like the sizing charts) for choosing correct compression pressure. It took 2 days for the pain to go away from wearing too high pressure socks for one 12 hour shift. I didn’t realize choosing good socks at the wrong pressure could actually hurt.
3.0,"Product was sized for girls, not women, am sending it back"
3.0,Not bad but every mask has to ditched on 1 side whe r the mask are not tacked down not stitched down. But some thread and a needle solved that little problem. Not bad for a $166 each😂.
3.0,"Nicely made, however does not work for a short waisted person."
3.0,While these are pretty they were very hard to get apart to put my pearls in.
3.0,Pretty great but the hinges are difficult to move… Good for the price I will say
3.0,Is not that great is good for kids .
3.0,"Product came as described but seemed very plain.  My son would have worn it for Halloween however it was too small.  He normally wears 12-14 so we sized up to give him some extra room, it was still too small.  We were worried that if he bent over at all the bottom would split open.  Make sure to size up."
3.0,"Comfy, but very stretchy. I’m med-lg and size medium feels too big on me."
3.0,"This is a cute little bag and will hold all of the things I want to carry (keys, phone, small wallet). The first thing I noticed was it STINKS!! I am hoping this smell goes away. I have been airing it out for a day and it is still as stinky as the first day. I will not be using it till this smell subsides. It seems to be made nicely. The stitching looks straight and even. I will really enjoy using this bag if the smell goes away. I will add to this review when that happens!! Well it is July 9th and the smell is mostly gone from this purse. I am amazed that there is still a lingering smell at this point. I guess it will always be there. I purchased this with a discount in exchange for my unbiased review and honestly if I knew I would have this smell I would not have bothered getting it."
3.0,"These glasses do fulfill their purpose of reducing the amount of headaches I get from using computers at my job, but the glasses frequently fall off of my head and my nose. This deters me from wearing them as much as I wanted to, but maybe if you have a wider face they could work?"
3.0,I bought this for my 6 month old daughter. Very cute but a little too big on her head. I read that it would be able to adjust to her head size with a pull adjustment string but that’s a lie. You can’t adjust it to fit your baby’s head. That was the main reason I bought. It also arrived way later then the actual date it was supposed to come. I did keep it so she can grow into it but I bought one from Target that fit her perfect because this one didn’t come in time for our hiking trip.
3.0,Cute pattern and really nice length! I recommended sizing up though because there is a weird hemline right underneath my bottom. It isn’t a very flattering fit and I’m planning on returning my regular size for a few sizes bigger in hopes that it will be loose enough and not fit weirdly!
3.0,Nice but a little cheaply made
3.0,"It's only 10.5"" but it fit and it's pretty."
3.0,"Received wrapped in tissue paper that is stuck on the pink rubber edging around the corners and handles.  It won't come off!  Otherwise nice purse, lots of room, eye catcher!"
3.0,The outfit is not exactly georgette as I thought it to be . Fit is ok . Not that great
3.0,"This is a beautiful outfit, just runs big. I ordered 7 months and don't think it'll fit till she's a year old. Good thing is it's pants so still works out for us either way."
3.0,"I really liked the look of this watch. And the other SKMEI watch I bought held up well to abuse. There were two things about this watch that were problematic:<br />First, the hands on the smaller dials on this model do not move. They are for appearance only, which was disappointing.<br />Second, I bought this for work, since it is inexpensive, and naturally I accidentally smacked it against something.<br />I didn't notice at first, but the second-hand fell off. It then became wedged under the hour hand, and eventually the watch stopped. I took the back off and got the thing out of there, but by then it had ceased to work.<br />I could have taken it to a watch repair but the hand had already come off once, and I didn't want to pay to fix it.<br />In summary, I liked the watch, but only the three hands worked, and if you're doing manual work, this isn't for you."
3.0,I am 5'6&#34; 165lbs.  Large fit as expected. I just wasn't crazy about the style. I did not like there wasn't a seem in the sleeves
3.0,"This dress is fine -- maybe not as ""neat"" as in the photo, but the material was fine, not too thin or thick, doesn't cling.  Do order a size up.  I'm normally an xl (5'7"" 185#) and this fit in an XXL.  I haven't decided if i'll keep it or not.  As I said, it's fine, but it isn't great. For the money it may be worth keeping as a back-up work dress.  The styling looks like you are a flight attendant (at least in the navy with ivory trim that I ordered)... in some ways that could be cute and classic, but it didn't wow me."
3.0,This dress is cute but I should have paid more attention to the reviews saying how small it runs. It is skin tight despite sizing up which is not what I was looking for. The material is also thin and somewhat shiny.
3.0,"The look and workmanship of the cufflinks are fine, however, both the cufflinks and Patriots emblem are much smaller than it shows in the picture and especially the emblem is so small to be noticed by anyone."
3.0,"Appear more low quality in person, but they are earrings"
3.0,Very small size but it is original.
3.0,"The garment is fine, fabric is not stretch as described but of fair quality, design is pretty, what is completely wrong with it, is the size, I bought this skirt for a friend that uses size 9, according to their chart I was supposed to order an M in order to get the right size, but instead of that I ordered an L, and it didn't fit to her!, it was so small that it didn't even close by at least 1 inch, we realized that an XL wold be small too, so I had to return it and search in another place."
3.0,"Looks better in picture, a bit disappointed"
3.0,Returned it. Not like a thirty-one bag at all.
3.0,"Apparently these run a size or two larger than my usual which is XL or 14 US. I'm 5'5"" 200lb and just holding them up they were huge and not even worth trying on. Material felt decent and ok construction but the cut also looks a bit matronly. I could be wrong and just ordered way too big but I don't think I'll bother reordering 1-2 sizes smaller to retry them even though the shipping is free."
3.0,The bra is good but the pin on the strings are too soft and break easily
3.0,I am somewhat disappointed to find that after a few wearings the canvas around the grommets is starting to fray.  This belt won't last a year at this rate.
3.0,"The necklace looks exactly like the pictures show. The problem is that the ad says it's made in Italy, and Murano glass is mentioned. The necklace received had a tag on it that read ""China."" China is a long way from Italy and Murano. It's nice but almost certainly way overpriced if it is actually made in China."
3.0,The color was nor brown
3.0,Runs big feels stiff
3.0,Gloves were ok will purchase again but the box can all mess up.
3.0,"Very thin, unfinished egdes. To use as a mask, it would need to be folded into thirds, and it would still be extremely thin. I purchased two 8 packs; one rainbow assortment, one that is half black, half grey. They look as if they will need to be hand washed."
3.0,I thought it would be a cute item for my daughter in Texas. It's cheap and tacky. She hated it.
3.0,"Love this little dress, but the pictures are misleading. The dress is actually a very shiny, silky material."
3.0,"It's quite poofier than I thought. It adds way more visual weight to my bottom half than I can get away with. It's very well designed, and I love the fabric, but the pleats and superfluous material just aren't great for me. I'm going to take it apart and see if I can remove fabric to make it a little more flattering on my shape. Or, better yet, see if my seamstress mother can do it for me!"
3.0,Lovely fit also love the color
3.0,Purchased my normal size and while pants fit fine- I couldn’t button the top. I made do and wore a black tank under it.<br />I’m 5’2” and about 130lbs and ordered a small.
3.0,My kid wore these twice and the button popped off already...frustrating.
3.0,Not so good for grocery shopping.
3.0,Decent product for the price. Definitely polarized and about the same size as my Ray bans.
3.0,I bought two checkered skirts to go the Indy 500 this year in August. This skirt is ok. The hem is raveling which I think it’s supposed to do but the fit is a little small/tight and quality is just ok. The price is right.
3.0,This is advertised to have an adjustable inner band which I assumed to enlarge as well as tighten. Unfortunately it only tightens but barely. I needed a larger hat. I have an average head but with hair up in the summer would be annoyingly tight
3.0,Order up a size or two if you want it to fit like the picture. What I received is definitely not the same print or cut around the neck (its more like a mini tank up top) -  it fit me like a bodycon dress. I ordered the small - but the medium would look too sloppy up top under the arms.
3.0,"Really pretty shirt, lovely pattern, soft fabric. Unfortunately the racerback style didn't fit flatteringly on me. If they made the exact shirt but with regular back straps, I would buy it in a heart beat. If racerback fits you well, you'll love the shirt and i'll be jealous!"
3.0,The quality is great. Size dont fit
3.0,Jumpsuit reminded me of an onesie..bedtime attire.
3.0,It looks good and feels good but you should buy a size larger than what you normally wear.  Mine is tight on me.<br />Also note the returns.  I tried to exchange the item and couldn't.  I could do a return if I paid $4 for a postage label and then the refund would come in a month.
3.0,The material is weird.  Otherwise would be really cute.
3.0,"Nice sparkle and shine but there were kinks in 3 places.  Usually, with a rope chain, you can wiggle them out.  Not this time.  Perhaps if they put it in a larger bag."
3.0,"Run large and wide; opening for foot is quite large which is good for those with high arches, but is a bit overkill in that regard.  Relatively attractive, just okay.  They are waterproof, no insulation, do have a grip pattern on sole.  Inexpensive but they do the job for walking the dog, taking out trash, other quick trips outside with a shoe that's easy on and off."
3.0,"My biggest gripe is the part that slides between your toes, it is way too big and chaffs quite a bit. Other then that, they serve as good shower shoes."
3.0,Size says &#34;one size fits all&#34; but that is definitely not the case!! It was very small and almost fit my 11 year old. They were great about return though!!
3.0,I ordered two shirts from Grayson Shop ( this one and another) through Amazon and on both shirts all the glitter was off before I made it home from work.
3.0,"I ordered an XL. But tag says 12<br />I'm a curvey girl, small on top round on bottom. This coat is loose on top and tight around the bottom. I love this coat. So I really didn't want to return it. Fortunately there is a two way zipper, so I can unzip the bottom part some. I am trying to lose weight. So I believe I can make this coat work. Fits great on top."
3.0,Very flimsy for the price. Haven’t turned colors on me yet but honestly don’t wear them often because they don’t seem like they will hold up very well and I don’t want to ruin them right away.
3.0,They run small. I should have gone with a size larger than I normally wear.
3.0,I loved the pattern but it was too big.  I went by the measurements when I ordered the dress but it was too big for me.
3.0,A little flimsy but I got so many compliments
3.0,"This is cute in a ""fast fashion"" sense but I don't find it to be a garment that will last through many washes or wears."
3.0,it might work
3.0,The color isn’t like the picture and it runs small.
3.0,The dress style itself is pretty but you can feel and see how cheap the material is.<br />Kind of expected from this price
3.0,"These are not even close to being knee high.. I'm a strapping 5'2&#34;. The color is great, the foot fit well. The ankle is snug. They are stretching out as I wear them."
3.0,Very nice handbag.
3.0,"By itself the mask fits well-enough, is pretty comfy. Light gauge wire for bridge of nose improves coverage, but isn’t uncomfortable.<br /><br />That said, unlike my other masks, the shape is pretty flat and doesn’t work well when used over an n95."
3.0,The right lens came unattached and the other lens popped out.  Overall I am pleased but was disappointed when I had to fix the lens when I opened the package.  The glasses themselves are good.  I like the product and would recommend if the lens continue to stay in.
3.0,The watch was cute and looked sturdy but it did not work upon delivery so I had to return it.
3.0,"Some reviews said they ran small.  Others said true to size.  I wear a 10, ordered a 10.  They fit like a 9.  Way too small.  Returning."
3.0,I do really like this shirt and it does fit well it's just that it does this weird thing around the armpit area where it seems too small. Unlike many shirts you order online where they are very thin and bad quality this shirt is pretty thick and not see through and it's sooo soft. Maybe if you buy a size up it will fit better around the arms
3.0,I ordered this because I thought it was a really cool idea to be able to wrap a hair tie around a bracelet and kind of hide it a little and not get a red band around my wrist from the tie. The bracelet is pretty and seems to be good quality but it was very difficult to get a tie around it and almost impossible to get it to stay there. This should not be advertised as a hair tie bracelet because it will not hold a hair tie. It is a pretty and good quality bracelet that you could just wear by itself.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
3.0,The durability of these shoes is questionable! The color is great and I love that they don’t have laces to dress them up.  The sole is nice and durable but they lack comfortable support also they seem to mark up quickly.  They came with some blue markings on them I can’t get off.
3.0,Lettering small and hard to see but on time and correct
3.0,"Can anybody tell me how to set the watch, digital time and date.  Don't have any instructions.  Thanks"
3.0,This skirt was too poofy and fit really weird.
3.0,"Made in USA!  I like how the skirts feel; I can move & breathe.  I like that these skirts truly cover the subject,  although a slip is needed,  as too much would be revealed in sunlight.  After I received these,  I saw the ones which are flared rather than straight - so I ordered them too!  As for these straight skirts,  I would suggest to order a size up if you have real hips."
3.0,I ordered a M and received a S. I like the one piece suite! I am 5'3 and about 130lbs. If I would have received the correct size I would love it!
3.0,I love it but if you're ordering it to wear as a shirt to go out I would order it a size smaller than you are .
3.0,I’m indifferent about these. Correct amount arrived on time BUT Harry our main guy has blotches all over the face with a dry super glue feeling on the face. Some other characters have the same blotchy face or color mix. Debating if this is a keeper. Overall not bad but had an expectation.
3.0,It fit size wise as expected but it is soooooooooooo low cut. And the front flies open in the wind really easily. It's cute but I am deffinetly going to need to get a slip of some kind for underneath or else this dress is way to indecent to be anything but a swin suit coverup...
3.0,It's a little small for an adult but it still fits. And mine came smelling like some kind of fuel like gas or something. I washed it once but the smell is still very strong.
3.0,The material is itchy & staticy
3.0,"Although they were still comfortable, they did run tighter and because of that ended up being a little see through. Luckily I had long shirts to wear with them"
3.0,"This dress is beautiful but definitely sheer, I have yet to find the perfect slip to wear under it but I am going to keep looking."
3.0,The material of the pad is not as dense as other slightly pricier product. Overall quality seems so so.
3.0,"I wanted something that would fit in my pocket, but this wallet could’ve been just a tad bit bigger or at least had a deeper/wider pouch so I could zip up my cards/cash. Plus it’s hard to take your cards in and out of the slips. I don’t feel safe sporting my money like this. It’s very cute though, you could use it for gift cards and change in your purse, but it’s not a practical wallet"
3.0,I little too thin. Elastic seem to wear easy.
3.0,"I love the pants, but I believe they run large.  I meant to exchange them for a smaller size, but I let the time frame for returning run out."
3.0,"I thought the material was more of a cotton and light weight  but it’s that shiny stretchy slightly heavier material,  they are still very cute, they run a little big. Depending on how you want to wear them, if a little baggy not snug then stick with your usual size."
3.0,Maybe because I needed to fit both regular eyeglasses and sunglasses in it.
3.0,Runs small. I normally wear medium. Ordered large and it’s a little tight. Beautiful blouse though.
3.0,"Too small across chest. Fine otherwise. All is well, I have to friend who loves it."
3.0,The picture looks gold gold however it is clearly rose gold. It's still very pretty just not gold.
3.0,Not what my boyfriend wanted but he uses it every day
3.0,Only thing I am giving 4 starts is because it is not as dark as the regular toffee color usually is. But I like them!
3.0,Cool shirt but runs really small for this brand.
3.0,"I'm 5'5 and 130lb, size small fits me well, the length is good too, covers my ankle but not to the ground. However, the material feels heavy and cheap, stitchers are not lined up well and already have some treads coming off when I just tired in on. The pockets make my hip looks a bit wider (probably not too bad for someone who prefers a curvier shape). Also, the ""Dark red"" is pretty dark, almost like a plum color to me. This actual color of the dress is closer to the pictures they showed, but far away from the sort of brighter red in their videos! I'm still keeping it because I like the style with the split (looks a bit fancy), and the size is perfect."
3.0,Clasp won't stay close. Almost loss it. Nice looking  bracelet
3.0,"These tights were somewhat small. I purchased them to wear on Thanksgiving, and luckily planned on wearing them with boots because they are a little floody! Also, if you have a booty, these probably aren't for you. The leggings aren't super stretchy so you might have a little butt crack hanging out all night. Haha.<br /><br />But I LOVE the style. I love the rips, they are in perfect spots. I wore with boots and a long shirt so I was plenty comfortable all night. But just keep the above in mind when buying!"
3.0,My other shirt fits much better. Much more comfortable.
3.0,the size was wrong. I ordered a 9. the size runs small. send a 10
3.0,Nice design. Rips easily. Was pulling pants down and 5 inches from the waistline now has a 1 inch hole. Not high quality fabric at all
3.0,Too tight at ankle
3.0,Not as pale of a gold as pictured.
3.0,Much smaller than anticipated.  They are cute though if you like small earrings.
3.0,Keeps pressure on the leg all day. Stretch has not changed after 8-10 washes.<br />Negative: too tight to take off; too thin where the toes are (might rip soon)
3.0,"I’m 5’6” and about 145. I’m usually a solid medium in pants (6/8 in jeans), but if I want a baggier fit I can go for a large. I ordered both. The medium fits like yoga pants. The large fits like I would expect. Be warned, lighter colors show every bump and imperfection. The dark olive color is brown. The length was fine on both sizes. They are very stretchy, so maybe that part is true to size. They may be a tad thicker than leggings. These are just not for me."
3.0,"Cute slippers, non skid bottom is great. Ordered a size bigger than my child is currently wearing and still is small, definitely size up as the UK sizes don't seem to correlate as they say."
3.0,"Went a size up after reading reviews and its way too big in the arms and the length in the back is way too long, looks more like a dress only too short in front.... Even tried to shrink and still too big. With proper sizing could be worth a shot?"
3.0,The backing on the studs is very loose. I had to change then so they wouldn’t fall out of my ears
3.0,"This was way cuter in the photo. I thought it would be lightweight, instead it’s a weird almost quick-dry feeling material. Certainly not made for warm days."
3.0,"Way too small. I would have liked it if it fit, so I’m giving it 3 stars"
3.0,It’s cute and fit great at the top but my lower body is probably not meant for these kinds of A line dresses. It made the bottom part look really poofy and too big.
3.0,They look like I'm wearing my husband's shorts .  Imo they are too long and tight legged to workout
3.0,A size small is smaller than what I expected it to be. Probably should’ve gotten a medium. I was still able to put it on at least but it would’ve been better if I had more room.
3.0,"Thin, light weight, made a little small, quality is good, it would be perfect for those slightly cool nights. It’s not really sweater material but more like a thicker t-short material."
3.0,Pretty but too narrow.
3.0,"The only reason I rated this 3 star is, If your self-conscious or weigh a few extra pounds I would look at some other options they have some really cool brief that do the same thing only different style.Last thing is, if you just take into consideration what it can do for supporting your &#34;unit&#34; it's awesome."
3.0,"While being the right length, the width of the tie, up where the knot is formed, is way too thin for my taste, resulting in a very small and thin knot when tied. I'm looking for the double Windsor thick knot. Otherwise, the tie is very nice quality and color. As expected."
3.0,"Mine has the same defect as described by William from California in another review, namely the interior liner is not affixed properly so a wrinkle develops which is keenly felt by the foot all the time.  In the shoes I received, the defect is in the heel of both shoes.<br /><br />I also agree that the construction of the shoe seems sub-par for Skechers.  There is a general cheapness in feel and appearance to the shoe.<br /><br />I've owned the shoes all of one day so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and wear them up until the return date and re-evaluate.  At that time I will edit my review.<br /><br />ETA:  I decided to return them.  They are just too cheap and tacky looking for my tastes.  A friend of mine described them as ""pimp hikers."""
3.0,"My daughter is a tall lanky 9 year old. We purchased size 30 (7/8). The skirt is too tight, so we had to makeshift a closure to give her more room and the top is about 2&#34; too wide and needs to be taken in. Luckily both are easy fixes for me because I sew. Just be aware, that these were not meant for a girl like the one who is modeling the clothing."
3.0,Way smaller than I thought.  It fit someone but not who it was purchased for
3.0,The material not as nice as expected but still okay key chain
3.0,"Fits my watch, but a little big on my wrist, just have to slide the watch a little further down my arm."
3.0,"Very thin see threw fabric, doesn't seem like it will hold up very long. It is a cute design but the lace seems like it was rushed."
3.0,"I wore these once and just noticed that one of the dangling bars is missing on one earring. Either I was sent a damaged pair or one dangling bar broke off when I wore it the one and only time. I would return it, but the return window has already closed.<br /><br />Something else to mention - the gold is more of a brushed or matted gold, not shiny gold. These are also lightweight."
3.0,these are ok. a bit too wide for my tastes. they interfered with my glasses when working out or at work. made my earbows dig in and by the end of the day the top of my ear was hurting. if you don't wear glasses these will be ok.
3.0,The top is beautiful but it kept pulling the front to high up and was rubbing my neck
3.0,"I thought, from the picture, that the ""Cub Cadet"" would be embroidered. It's only fuzzy-print...Oh well."
3.0,"The 'coral color is quite faded, and the chain for the necklace is not really a gold color, so I will keep the set, but I will find a different chain. Othetwise, pretty cute and nice packaging."
3.0,"I had purchased this several times in the past and they were much larger in size. These can only be used the arm unless you have ""Olive Oyl"" legs or arms.  For those that don't know who ""Olive Oil"" was, she was Popeye's girlfriend.<br />Look a little farther and they have the old ones back in stock but are more expensive. I wouldn't have bought these if I'd know how small they were."
3.0,Design looks just like photo.<br /><br />Mask is a bit big and uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,was a little short
3.0,"Although the material is very nice, soft and cozy, I did end up returning this product to do it being extremely wide, it may have been a size issue on my part in ordering, but I ordered typically what I wear, I would recommend ordering a size down if you wanna give it shot!"
3.0,Uniboob issues for 34H size.
3.0,"stitching/finishing on the thumb hole is not very neat/professional looking, but they do the job."
3.0,"Too tight in the bust, arms and waist also too long not satisfied"
3.0,"These shoes look great, solid, and are warm. However the synthetic upper material lasted just for one winter season. I wore it probably for about 250-300 hours total and have noticed cracks in the upper foot where the shoe bends.<br />I'm giving it average 3 stars because of the short life."
3.0,"The fit of the dress is great, I like the material too. However, the color is not at all the same as pictured. It’s basically a light baby pink."
3.0,"they were just okay, nothing fancy. small. flimsy. pull apart to open and I worry they don't secure well."
3.0,I wear size 10 shoe and the socks were a bit long in the foot. Quality very good.
3.0,"My sister got this lovely top for me. It's GORGEOUS! However it's a little small, not a lot of stretch. Unfortunately, there was no larger size so I couldn't return it for a bigger size. But, luckily it wasn't too small and if I lose a few pounds I'm sure it will fit better."
3.0,"These are cute earrings, but the first pair I tried the threader end of the earring broke off.  I did get another pair in and we will see how long they last. I guess I will keep them since you do get 12 pairs and what can you expect I guess when you get 12 pairs of earrings for $13."
3.0,"It was what they said it would be but it just wasn't for me.  I've donated it.  That being said, it did fit well and the color was perfect.  It just didn't look great on me."
3.0,Very thin material. While I am 5' 11&#34; these pants are long! My Daughter is 5'6&#34; and they are 2 inches too long on her.
3.0,Can not see face when this is on and blocks sun great. Of u need to walk by but down wanna be recognized this is great
3.0,"This is a pretty shirt, but order 2 or 3 sizes up!<br />I’m 5’4, weigh 125 & wear 34dd & I purchased this shirt going by the measurement sizing chart listed for this particular shirt. Sadly it’s way way way too tiny. It’s one of those shirts that looks like a toddlers shirts until it’s put on & then it stretches to fit & appears to mold around your upper arms, over your boobs & then basically clings under your boobs. It is shorter than the measurements say on the sizing chart. It’s just a very tiny shirt. I gave it to my 11 year old niece who is 4’ feet tall, weighs 80 pounds & has no boobs & it’s is adorable on her though!"
3.0,They are really cute but the back of the earring kept falling off on the third time i wore them. I've had to use other backs to get them to stay on.
3.0,"I like the length of these shorts and the high waist and pockets. But the high waist isn't tummy control because the fabric is too thin. It's not a thick compression material I thought it was going to be. You can see all the lumps and bumps! Even though the shorts are thin, it is not see through so that's a plus."
3.0,Very see through and super thing material. Very tight and I ordered a medium
3.0,"Okay, this review is two-fold. The pants are correct size and I like the pants. Having said that, I ordered twice. First order I received wrong color. I didn't sweat it because I use those for extensive hiking so color wasn't a huge issue. The second order I received the correct color, but during first wash the snap button came off. Found it in bottom of washing machine. Took to dry cleaners and they said they could not repair. They told me to go to a shoe repair place. I went to one, and they told me no because once a snap button comes off, even if it is replaced, it is more likely to come off again and again. They sent me back to the dry cleaners to have a regular button sewn on and a slit cut in for the button."
3.0,fall apart fast
3.0,"I’m 115-120 lbs and I’m about 5’4”. I ordered a small and it’s oversized, not cropped. Its also not at all lightweight like it mentions.<br />Its a nice sweater though! I’m gonna keep it because it’s soft and heavy so makes me feel secure."
3.0,"Cheap fabric, smaller than described and overall cheap"
3.0,"Nothing special, very typical sweater. Although I have received a lot of compliments asking where I bought it. If you want an affordable sweater, you should buy it."
3.0,I had originally bought the peach color but it was see through and returned it. Customer service from this company is outstanding they offered me another dress at no cost and I picked a black one and Just wearing a bra will be fine with a darker color.
3.0,Nice bras way too small though (at least 2 sizes) hence 3 stars.
3.0,Nice quality but runs small. Not for an average size woman.
3.0,"The picture looks like this sweatshirt is a very vivid bright pink. I received mine yesterday after a short delay…. The color is more a coral pink. I purchased it because it was BRIGHT PINK… did not get what I expected. Size good, comfortable but color very disappointing 🥲"
3.0,Definitely order a size down. This sweater was huge.
3.0,I was looking for a very large tote bag.  This one was only average size.
3.0,Thin material but very cute and feels nice as well as fits nice. True to size I am 5’6 190lbs
3.0,"This outfit is very cute, soft and comfortable. But it runs a little big. So I had to return it"
3.0,"The phrase ""you get what you pay for"" rings true here.<br /><br />Decent little cheap sunnies to keep in the car, or to grab in a pinch. Picked up a set of each color to hold me over until my Oakleys came in. Once Oakleys arrived, these have been collecting dust.<br /><br />NOTE: The black pair do NOT come with a clear nose pad per the photo.<br /><br />Cool pair, but too inexpensive to return.  No, I would not buy these again."
3.0,It’s really stretchy which I always love a good stretch but it’s TOO stretchy. It has no support because of it. It has the bra insert which is like neon white and completely visible through the shirt.
3.0,"Fit is as expected but very straight cut. Not the best for anyone with a hip and no adjustable waist option. I'm sure they function well but I returned. For reference, I wear size 4, womens."
3.0,no cooments
3.0,Fits comfortably but i did need to order a size bigger. It didn't go off the shoulder like pictured
3.0,"The price was good and the item is lightweight. But I didn’t feel that it was secure enough to hold the elastic of the mask. I was using a cloth mask because it was comfortable for the skin and I used a disposable one over the cloth mask, It would not hold the elastic for both mask. It’s my honest opinion based on my experience"
3.0,I ordered a size larger than I wear and it didn’t come close to being my size. I couldn’t even button it. It was at least a size too small even though I ordered a size larger. Good quality shirt. The sizing is just way off.
3.0,It seemed to help a little with a floppy hat
3.0,Size smaller than expected.
3.0,African American women with natural hair dont try it it will frezz your hair up noce hat though bought for my wife
3.0,"Fits as expected, arrived on time, the only reason I gave it a 3 Star is because it was supposed to be a 3 pack and I only got 2. It was missing the blue one."
3.0,"After I washed it with some fabric softener it made it a bit softer, but it is definitely a size down and than marked. I ordered my daughter a 3T and it is definitely fitting her like a 2T. Thankfully she is just now moving into 3 T so she’ll be able to fit in it for a bit but compared to Carter’s brand it is much smaller and not very stretchy. If I did this all over again I would have ordered a four instead of a three! Because they’re cute and hold up in the wash."
3.0,Quality could be better. After the first wash a few threads started to pop out.
3.0,"As advertised, very light weight. Didn't like that they get super wrinkled. Had to iron them."
3.0,Look stunning but I have to find earrings back that will actually stay because they are heavy and fall out after two seconds of movement:/
3.0,Very pretty but may be slippery.
3.0,"These are not the greatest quality and I did not get the silver and opal as ordered.  I will keep them,  but would not order again."
3.0,"I really liked the skirt but there are two things which I was not too happy about, one it was too thin thus a little see through and the other I don't know why there was static with the lining and the top material of the skirt which made the skirt rise on the back, maybe it was because I wore it with leggings under not sure. But overall really nice skirt."
3.0,"I like the look of these earrings, but the clasp is too loose and they keep falling off and getting lost.<br />I tried tightening them by watching a DIY YouTube video, and it helped a little bit, but I'm not confident in wearing them out of the house because they have fallen off so easily at home."
3.0,The sleeve length is not my favorite.  Shrink with each wash.
3.0,Padding is a little thin and not wide enough
3.0,Fits weird but great print
3.0,Color is perfect.  It does however have a horrible smell in my nose. No other septum ring I own has this smell.
3.0,It's beautiful and bright. All the feels... only cons not much stretch so the bathing suit allows for some cheek actions. I actually paired it with a skirt and received several compliments.
3.0,Cute looking shoe but runs a size too big.
3.0,Es un poco grande como llavero.
3.0,"Material is thin, arms fit tight, color looks as picture, received numerous comments. Really like the shirt however not thrilled about the material."
3.0,"Less than expected, but alright for the price."
3.0,Rings were too small
3.0,"Cute Shirt, but very thin. Will look nice with a camisole underneath."
3.0,It cut into my cheeks every time I smiled
3.0,"It’s good quality pants. But unfortunately I’m done with youngla, their pants don’t fit in tall guys. I’m 6’4 and their large/xl don’t fit on me. Too bad"
3.0,"Plenty of space, not very durable."
3.0,Pretty... a little big
3.0,Much thinner and cheaply made than expected.  A little snug for a medium.
3.0,Pretty cute. One chain was broken when arrived but I fixed. Was way more orangey yellow than a pretty gold though.
3.0,"This blouse does not fit well. You would have to keep adjusting it every now and then. The material is polyester and looks cheap. Having said that, from afar the print and color is lovely and attractive."
3.0,"Great tie, but very yellow.  It's bright and very dressy. Still worked for what we needed."
3.0,"The belt looks very nice and sturdy, but after time I started to see the color starting to flake off where the metal is rubbing the belt."
3.0,I wear a size 18 and I am about 5'7. I could have used an XXL. But it only came in an XL. It didn't fit as long and full on me ( I was expecting for it to be draging the flooras it appears on the model). It is a good length for me but I wanted it to be fuller. Iam still gone wear this because I need it on the 12th of February. Other than that it is cute hopefully I can pull it off.
3.0,Kind of cheap fabric not real denim
3.0,Not very easy to put on but very cute
3.0,"I'm always hesitant when I shop on line, however I needed shirts for work and didn't have much time to go shopping. I order this blouse and was happy that it wasn't flimsy and fit well according to the size chart. I would buy it again in another color"
3.0,"Cute leg warmers, on the small side though which says a lot because I have skinny legs. I was expecting them to be bulky which is what I wanted. But good quality, not cheap looking."
3.0,"I like the gloves for what they are, warm and comfortable winter gloves. They do seem a bit... feminine though. The buckle and strap just makes them seem like women's gloves to me.They also have a strong scent, will hopefully go away once they are worn and washed a few times."
3.0,I SWIM IN THIS SHIRT.. EVEN after washing in hot water and drying on high
3.0,"This dress fits fantastically, but the ribbon is made of satin and therefore does not hold a bow well. The bow becomes heavy and starts to droop, leaving you looking sloppy. In addition, the lace wrinkles very easily and the fabric is hard to iron. Dry cleaning did not get out the wrinkles either.  Would not buy this again."
3.0,No... good. Only design good.
3.0,"The strap measures about 10&#34; not including the buckle. I have a 7.5&#34; wrist and it's JUST long enough to tuck under the last ring. The band is soft and seems to be of good quality, however there is signs of fraying in the holes after one day of wear. Hardware is good. Not a bad deal for the money, but if you're over 7.75&#34; it's going to be too short to wear traditionally."
3.0,It was a little to small. But very nice
3.0,Bought 2 of this style dress in same size and different colors. They state they are same material but this  was HUGE and thin. I wiuld have kept it if it was 2 sizes smaller
3.0,its too short
3.0,Not bad! Not so good either. Whites are more like grey in reality.
3.0,"I’m currently 31 weeks pregnant. I purchased these shorts because my regular shorts were getting uncomfortable for my growing belly. I purchased a size small and they fit perfectly. The grey shorts were sooo comfortable and the material was think. Almost covered my whole belly. I loved my purchase until I tried on the black ones...I was very disappointed. They were the exact opposite of the grey shorts. Although it was somewhat comfortable, the material was not soft and very thin. When I bent down you can see my underwear or how my 7 year daughter tells me “Mom, I can see your butt”. The only parts that aren’t see through are the pockets because they had double fabric. I purchased these shorts because I wanted the black/charcoal color. The pockets on the side of both shorts are a great bonus but I can’t wear the black ones in public."
3.0,"Great build, though the hands became loose and fell off of the middle pin within a week. Other than that, it's beautiful."
3.0,"I'm giving this dress three stars because it is cute. It is very thin and white so you will likely need to wear a slip underneath but for the price I think thats reasonable. However, the biggest issue was how large the dress was. I have seen conflicting reviews and debated between a med and large. Got the large and it was huge! Not just a little baggy but literally felt like I could fit another person in the dress. I am going to try another size and see what happens its easy to return so worth the second try."
3.0,"A size 6 turns out to be much larger than a medium, they are way too big for me to wear![[ASIN:B00008ID39 Jockey Elance String Bikini - 3 Pack]]"
3.0,"Ugly, but served their purpose."
3.0,The gaping is unattractive
3.0,Looks used in person
3.0,Love the look of these but the soft plastic backs fall off randomly. I lost one earring the second time I wore them. I will literally just be standing there and a back pops off and falls onto the floor at my feet.
3.0,It isn’t as fluffy as I thought. But very warm
3.0,Scarf is heavy & falls down b/c of the weight of he scarf.
3.0,"Lens is dark and polarized but does not fit right into frame. When I wipe the lens with little pressure, they tend to fall out easily. As long as lens is not being touched there is no issue but will fall out when wiping."
3.0,"The smaller rings hanging off the main one are a bit fragile. Two of them fell off right out of the packaging. Lucky for me they were the same rings on each earring, so it balanced out. But they are attached by a really odd, pretty insecure method of ""pinching"" the ball. Otherwise they feel nice and have a nice weight that isn't too heavy"
3.0,The black one seems to have better quality than the navy and gray ones as both got torn above the lace first try on!  The length is good.  You can see the sewn seam behind the lace on the top part.
3.0,"I love the pattern and the thin material, as it has been very hot where I live. However, it does not stay up on my face very well. I literally had to hold it up in a store the other day."
3.0,"The silk screening part was low quality, shirt appeared ok but again not the best quality.  It was a low price item so you get what you pay for."
3.0,"These were fairly uncomfortable due to the point on the wrist, and they're not really dimensioned to be turned around. The material wasn't flexible, so even when I laced them loosely, I couldn't get them comfortable. They look fantastic, though, so if you were only going to wear them for a short time, they'd be fine."
3.0,WAYYYYY to small up top. Pretty dress though. Sent it back.
3.0,"I bought this for my sister for Christmas because she just bought her dream car - a ruby red Mustang. I got the largest size available - which is two sizes larger than her normal size - and it was way too small.  If you're curvy at all, keep looking."
3.0,Runs small but very nice
3.0,Nice. A little unsturdy. Small-medium sized heel. But ok. I got what I paid for.
3.0,"This swimming suit is a cute pattern, but it was a bit snug on me and hard to get on and off. It does't have a lot of give."
3.0,"These are super cute, my granddaughter loved them, however, all the way up and down the seam where the zipper is sewn just shreds out with the thread, we have trimmed them off several times, but those zippers will come out, at least in several places very soon."
3.0,"The dress looked great when I first put it on. It was tight in all the right places but not overly so just like a bodycon dress should. However, after trying it on, the shape of the dress became loose. I returned it right away. This is an amazing dress if it can keep the fit, but in my experience, i think it will easily become super loose and lose what we all want in a bodycon; support."
3.0,Lock is really bad; it opens automatically; we lost it on first day.
3.0,Se ven mas grande en la foto
3.0,"This dress is beautiful but it’s very large in the chest area. I had to safety pin it in a few places, but it still looks very pretty on. It arrived very wrinkled, though!"
3.0,"Loved the look.<br />Loved the material. Thinner than sweatshirt material but thicker than a tshirt.<br />Loved the uniqueness and air of femininity.<br /><br />Although I am short-waisted, I found this hoodie to keep working its way up to my waist whereas I like my hoodies to almost cover my bottom."
3.0,It looks very nice when you put it on but it tears off so easily.
3.0,"I like the shirt, but it’s not a razorback."
3.0,"Cute dainty bracelet and nice quality, the packaging was rubbed off though so if I gave it as a gift it wouldn’t have been that nice"
3.0,So far perfect . Hoping for and Olive and Gold color
3.0,A size XL runs more like a smaller- fitted large.
3.0,Color different than how it appeared online. And it is a little scratchy unlike cashmere.
3.0,Loops for ribbon broke the first time wearing
3.0,"The length is a little short. I'm only 5'3 and 23 weeks pregnant. My bump has some room to grow before I need to wear it, which will help fill out the dress better, but I am worried it them might be a little short. The seam around the waist is a little too low down on the bump too. Overall just not the best quality for those pregnant."
3.0,"I love the two snaps the best because it doesn't excessively cover my bottom half. I wear it over my diapers, and like how it doesn't hide all my diaper but still supports it. It is very strong and stretchy material but fits very tight."
3.0,My son ordered them a size 10 and when we got them they were a size 9 so they are too small. He is going to return them for size 10
3.0,I returned the shirt
3.0,Love it but don't wash and dry. It shrunk a lot. I replaced it and will only dry clean the new one.
3.0,"Overall it's okay, but the pockets are not well created so it gives it a strange look. The pockets randomly flip out, so it looks like the sweater has to things hanging out of the sides. I will wear it if and when I need to; however, I will likely avoid it generally because it looks pretty bad."
3.0,La tela se estiró ha la segunda lavada
3.0,I like this cover-up however the sleeves are tight. Part of the pom-pom fringe came loose when I washed it .
3.0,"Description says true to size... I ordered 8.5 (Mens) and they were almost 2 sizes too large. The box they came in had the size listed as 42. Hope that helps. Overall for the price the boot is nice, the sizing was just way off and had to return"
3.0,"This was a really fun mask, but arrived damaged. It was ripped about halfway across, so I exchanged it for another one. The second arrived bent out of shape. The quality of the print and card stock itself was good. A little pricey, but it’s a novelty item so that’s okay since if you’re buying this you probably have a specific need for it. I’m not sure if these figures or photographers get royalties for these or if they give permission, so that made me feel a little uneasy and guilty buying this."
3.0,I saw some people had gotten a rash so I washed it before wearing and the water was black for a long time. I assumed this would avoid the rash but I still got one anyway so I wear it for shorter time over clothes
3.0,Really small/tight  on adults. More for little girls.<br />Pretty and sturdy though
3.0,"The pieces are absolutely gorgeous, BUT the earrings are of a felt material, which means they don't have any weight to them. They need to have the earrings made as the pendant on the necklace and then it would be a better set."
3.0,They are very cute but a little thin
3.0,"This dress was purchased to wear to dinner on a cruise. After trying it on last night I will say this, I typically wear a small in most clothing items, but this dress is definitely small. I agree with the previous reviewers in the fact that the sequins are very itchy. There is no lining of any kind on the inside. The zipper is also a bit stubborn where there are sequins. This dress is also SUPER long. I am 5'2&#34; so I expect most dresses to be long, but I can typically avoid alterations with 5&#34; heels. This dress is still almost 12&#34; longer after I put on 5&#34; heels. Alterations are a MUST! All in all I will wear it to dinner and probably immediately take it off!<br /><br />UPDATE: After further consideration I decided to return the dress as I decided I would not be comfortable in it. Disappointed!"
3.0,It very nice clothes but it is a little bit small.
3.0,Buttons come unloose at the bust.
3.0,"These leggings are cute, fit as expected, and are really comfortable. They seem to be really well-made. The material is a lot thicker than I expected and when I wore them to barre, I was glad I actually remembered to bring a water bottle because these leggings are really good at keeping heat in. I was so HOT! And as one of those people who's always cold, that's saying something. I'll try them again when winter rolls back around..."
3.0,Get size up then normal
3.0,"Returned this.  Based on reviews, I bought one size larger (Medium) than I normally wear.  The sleeves were oddly a little tight, but the rest was too big and there was just a lot of material.  The red color was pretty, though."
3.0,"The cloth and color were amazing, it just didn’t fit me as expected."
3.0,I expected these cubes to be light weight.  They are well constructed but their added weight worries me.  I need to keep my bag under 50 lbs.
3.0,Good quality but the size is not ok
3.0,Super cute design but if you have curves it's a little tight. Fabric was thicker then I expected but that was ok.
3.0,Product delivered quickly. Doesn’t really stop the glare while night driving the blinding glare just becomes blinding yellow glare.
3.0,Nice coat but zipper broke after 20 or so zips.  Its a very warm coat and we average 30-35 degrees most days during the winter so I only have him wear it when its in the 20s.  Costs more to get a new zipper in so I might as well get another coat.  Vert bummed!!!
3.0,had to purchase additional metal adhesive inserts to try to get a deal to prevent my glasses fogging up... sorta works.. LOVE SRV though..
3.0,Comfortable for working out. I could use more material on backside. It barely covers the crack of your butt.
3.0,Beautiful color and seemed to be made wonderfully but definitely runs small. I'd even go as far as almost 2 full sizes too small.
3.0,Pattern is more spread out than it looks in picture. More white between the flowers.
3.0,Fibers from the pajama bottom pilled into fuzzies. They weren't has soft as expected that is the blue pair. Penguins pair I try tonight.
3.0,This is a cute ring. However it’s very thin bends super easy. But it was cheap. It does look like a cat just like the picture.
3.0,Not even close to the Cute Booty Lounge OG! Material is cheap. The scrunch isn’t natural and the mesh material in the waist is cheap. Returning but if you want to pay less they may work. I don’t see these lasting
3.0,Well put together but run small.
3.0,"They shrink in the wash, so mine are a little short now. Overall, I like them, but I am not sure if I would buy again.  I love the pockets, pant loops, and tummy coverage. I am not a fan of the material. It is not as soft as other brands. 3 stars. You could either way on these pants."
3.0,"This wallet is great, except for one important, key complaint:  It's slightly too small.  It is JUST as long as a US dollar bill, so you have to squish up your money to make it fit.  If you don't carry cash or don't mind folding your bills (which makes your wallet fatter), I'd recommend.  It's cute and easy to carry.  Fits license, credit cards, etc., nicely, and it has some extra pockets on the inside for membership cards, medical ID cards, etc.  But it really should be at least half an inch longer."
3.0,"No structure, made with inferior material."
3.0,"PRODUCT WAS NOT AS I EXPECTED.  I THOUGHT IT WAS A 'STRETCH BAND', IT WASN'T.  DON'T THINK THE DESCRIPTION WAS CLEAR ENOUGH....OR MAYBE I DID NOT READ IT CORRECTLY.  GOOD QUALITY THOUGH."
3.0,"We put this umbrella on our patio. The color was a little more turquoise than I had wanted ( my cushions are a spa color). But the size is nice, heavy canvas fabric. It had tassels which I hadn’t seen in the pic,  but we cut those off. It’s decent, just not perfect."
3.0,"I love these gloves a lot. So much that I bought a second pair the day the first arrived. The newly arrived brown pair is equally as nice in material as the black, however it fit much larger in size (despite both being mediums). The brown pair slips off my hands unless I have other gloves underneath them. All in all these are awesome gloves though. Very soft, durable material that keeps you very warm. I just wish the sizing were consistent."
3.0,"Top fits as expected, bottoms are too small. I wish you could pick the separate sizes like department stores. But I LOVE this suit and so I ordered a larger size just to get the bottoms. Still cheaper than the name brand suit!"
3.0,"I use L, I ask XL, this is XL too small, please compare with another brands, I feel this like M size. Have beautiful day!"
3.0,"I was disappointed with this fit, because it seemed to accommodate my big stomach, but it looked odd, then the skirt tapered at the bottom. It created this really weird shape on me and just enhances my size in a very unflattering way."
3.0,"I'm not sure what I was thinking when I bought this. I had a wedding to go to and picked out some dresses, but also let my boyfriend (who works on a bear farm) pick a couple out. He didn't pick this, and did not like it on me at all. I guess everyone has a different opinion. I didn't mind it, but I hate to admit it... I think my boyfriend was right!"
3.0,The top was just fine but the pants are way too big!
3.0,Love it gave it away arms run really small
3.0,"Ordered a size 8-9 and the tag on the dress says 13.  No place to ask if this is correct or not?  Dress seems on the rather large size, but will be grown into.  It IS soft and a nice shade of blue."
3.0,Very cute. Very lightweight. Doesn’t seem like the most durable but overall as described.
3.0,"The look is very good. It feels nice as well.<br /><br />However, you would have to be careful with it. I had a feeling it's not too strong so tried to bend it with just a little force and it seemed to start bending so I stopped. Coincidentally it fell on the wooden floor when I was putting it down, and one of its pointed end got bent out of shape. Because the material is so weak, I was able to use a coin to straighten out the end as well.<br /><br />Depending on how careful you are with your jewelry items, you may or may not want this. I just got this today - I really like its look and feel. Hope it stands the test of time and lasts for a year or more."
3.0,"The shirt part Fit but the tiny bralette must have been at best a b cup with only a 6"" spread....too small for regular to large boobs. But if you are small chested this shirt is for you"
3.0,"This purse and wallet is beautiful and functional.  However, my gun won't fit.  I will buy a smaller one that will because I like it.  The purse will not stand up because the bottom is bent inward, but I still use it everyday."
3.0,"If you're looking for any kind of cinching look elsewhere, this buckles if you pull it even a bit tighter than your actual waist. its cute to just wear loosely as a belt but it feels pretty cheap. I wore it once and never again."
3.0,I didn't think this purse would be so soft. it's pretty deep too so it makes it difficult to search for items.
3.0,"I bought these in a size up from normal because I was having abdominal surgery and I wanted something that fit loose at the waist.  I also like my sweats to fit large anyway.  These pants are a bit oversize to begin with so they were fine during my recovery period.<br /><br />For some reason, I thought I read a description that said these had a drawstring waist (like every other pair of sweat pants I own).  However, they do not have a drawstring waist and cannot be adjusted to fit tighter.  After recovering from the surgery,  the only way I can wear them is by using a safety pin at the waist to take up the extra size.<br /><br />Other than the lack of a drawstring and my ordering larger than normal, the pants are pretty good.  The material and workmanship are on a par with Champion and Russell Athletic lightweight fleece.  But the design is the problem.  I wish they had that drawstring...if they did, I would rate higher.  But lacking a waist adjustment, they're just barely okay--really 2.5 stars."
3.0,This was a bit small and way too short for me! The material was soft and the color was great!
3.0,"I thought the “clasp” was more permanent. It easily stretches, even just for a night out to dinner I had to tighten them constantly. Tou can not hit the dance floor with these lol"
3.0,"Horrible, ordered a 2x wear a M to L and the arms are so small the shoulders are cut narrow and it to my knees and I am 5'8"
3.0,Please read the fine print it is only 1 sock not a pair my kid was disappointed when she ordered it. The one sock is nice but she cried so please be aware that its just 1 sock
3.0,I got this hat to wear in the jeep with the top down for extended time in the sun.  It is very thick and not breathable.  The front rim came a little off centered and will not readjust.
3.0,"THESE SHORTS ARE NOT SHORT. JESUS CHRIST THEY ARE SO LONG. EVEN FOR A PERSON WITH A LARGER HIP MEASUREMENT.<br /><br />I'm a seamstress and I know that we took the measurements right. The hip measurement was fine and the belt that came with it was actually awesome. But when we put these on him, holy cow. They were nearly the length of normal pants. Like, three or four inches above his ankle.<br /><br />Beware of these if you're in a larger size. For someone with that measurement, even if they were proportionally a non big-and-tall person, there's no way this would hit below the knee like you'd expect."
3.0,"Used to replace of old broken doc martin laces. These are not as nice, they are &#34;shinny&#34; almost and don't stay tied very well. Would just pay the extra couple buck for the doc martin laces next time..."
3.0,"This shirt is cute, but the fabric looks cheap. Also, I had to trim a lot of loose threads off it before wearing. It's an okay deal based on the price, but I was hoping for a little higher quality."
3.0,"Neck line is a bit high, okay made. Had to cut strings off. Thicker material."
3.0,"These are cute but they are definitely meant for adults, will not fit a child-size head."
3.0,Kinda baggy and poor quality of design and fabric. DO NOT PURCHASE
3.0,I loved the look of this dress but the picture made it seem like there was fabric under the lace detailing that borders between the chest and just under but its completely see through and inappropriate for what i was looking for.
3.0,"I loved Polk dots , but little too big for me ."
3.0,"In person, the dress does not look as nice as pictured online.  The floral print looks blurry and the material is not as soft weight and light as I expected.  It makes the dress look too young and cheap."
3.0,Very small and not the best quality gear
3.0,"Comfortable, soft and look adorable on my toddler. They fit true to size, and are easy for her to put on and take off.<br />Some shedding but not a lot, and they're holding up well so far.<br />Update:<br />5-star rating dropping to 3. 3 months in and we're overdue for a second pair as these started falling apart around the 2 month mark. The fabric soles ripped and there's no cushioning any more. My daughter still loves them and the blue one is very cheap, so I will just buy another pair for her to wear until it starts getting colder and she can wear her proper cozy slippers."
3.0,"they are okay, a little difficult to close the latches."
3.0,"This review is hard to do. The dress sent to us was completely different. The dress pictured here, looks like a true princess dress. The dress we received, looks like a fairy costume. It has a laced up bodice and a rainbow tulle skirt. The dress we received is soft, colorful, and comfortable. I am almost more pleased with the dress we received than what was pictured. It fits a 4 year old perfectly, and will probably fit next year as well."
3.0,I really like them.  The colors are great and it fits great I just would like the fabric to be a little thicker.
3.0,I'm an XL and bought the XXL and it fits just right. I'm 5'6 and it is at a proper mini length that I don't have to worry about showing my back side. doesn't show love handles lol. Fabric and layers allows proper look to allow a belt around the waste if you want
3.0,"I had wanted the shirt in Kelly green, but the site would not let  me do so and never said that it was out of stock."
3.0,"very thin material, will return"
3.0,The top itself is cute. This top works best for a pear shape. It’s tight across my chest and very loose around my waist. Keeping it to do yard work
3.0,Too small. Size up
3.0,The dress fits perfectly except for around my arms. It is extremely tight. Also it is a very light material and I assumed it would have been a bit thicker
3.0,Color “milk” looks yellow. 3-year old confirmed when asked if the color is white or yellow. Gave a way.
3.0,The fabric is not the best quality and the feeling on your skin is not the best. Fair for the price but I would not buy it again.
3.0,"Thinner material than a typical sweatsuit, which is fine but runs way too small! Order at least one size up! Returning my size large for an xl when all my closes are typically a women’s size medium."
3.0,Quality is ok but it has a very fishy smell.
3.0,"When I received it,it was bent and the chain wasn't  together luckily I was able to fix it."
3.0,Would have greatly preferred cloth material.  Started to get an itchy rash from the chain within the first 2 days and had to stop using.
3.0,"These REVS are really a fun color.  Sorry to say, they run very narrow."
3.0,"My wife had been wanting one of these bolo type bracelets for a while.  The price was right so we tried this one.  She likes that the colored stones do change colors when the light shifts.  The only problem, one of the round balls at the end of one side fell of (lost).  She does office work and isn't hard on any of her jewelry.  Not worth send back."
3.0,Cute but very thin material. I imagine it won't last long.
3.0,Returned. Correct size not available. Ordered different style.
3.0,"On the one hand, these bands are super cheap, and I can't fault the company overall. On the other hand, they look extrodinarily bad and will cheapen the appearance of your watches. If you're after a cheap piece of junk that is pretty durable that you don't have to worry about, go for it. If you value the appearance if your time pieces, save you money and buy something with a bit more quality"
3.0,Too narrow at the connection of the visor to the hat body.
3.0,"It's a cute shirt, but it's mostly for girls with smaller boobs. I'm a 34D and I got a large and I had to literally place my boobs in order for them to not be spilling out of the sides. Other than that, good material. Not very stretchy, but super cute"
3.0,"It is for people with small wrists, but it's elastic, so once you get it on, it's very comfortable. I have problems getting sleep readings with it, probably because of the way it fits"
3.0,Good work but too heavy after carry all labtop and things. It would be great if add the shoulder hanger to the design.
3.0,"They are attractive, but bands are too loose ! They keep slipping off! The inner soles feel good! Wondering if a shoemaker can do something to make the bands  smaller!!"
3.0,The straps were entirely way to long. Actually had to safety pin them almost in half but the rest of the length was perfect?
3.0,Good quality but these pants are HUGE.
3.0,I liked the scarf although it was different from what I originally intended.
3.0,This is just ok.  Not exactly the look I was going for.  Other commentators said it ran too small but I was not concerned as I have a small head.  But this was even a tad too small for me
3.0,I loved the wings material but the it needed to have an attachment for the hands to make the wings look more realistic. Instead they just hung there.
3.0,"I do like this belt, but when they say its a XL they mean XL.  I am a 14 and usually belts don't fit me well so I always order L or XL in stores.<br />Next time, I would get a L only.  But for the price and to be able to wash it, it is a great belt."
3.0,"My granddaughter loves the shirts, but they run very small."
3.0,"Love the color, how breathable the fabric is and how adjustable it is but the crotch seam came apart after a week of use as pajamas...😢"
3.0,"I just got the kit, it seems OK enough but how the hell are you supposed to connect to loop to the needle so that you can get the ring thru your piercing??? They don't connect, and I'm not piercing expert, but in what I've seen the jewelry connects to the needle and is then pulled thru the piercing. Maybe I'm missing something here, but I can't figure it out 🤷🏼‍♀️"
3.0,I p[ut them on and had to take them off because they were not the right size and were cutting off my circulation!  They are very tight! And hard to get on and off!
3.0,"The chain looks nice and discrete, but it just does not seem to be appropriate for the gem, for it seems to be too thin for it.<br /><br />The gem does not look really good to me, I guess that the way it is cut makes it look like it is not real, and even when one of the amazon pictures is some sort of &#34;authenticity certificate&#34;, that did not come with the product.<br /><br />I like how it looks, bought this for my gf and hope she will like it as well.<br /><br />The packaging is extremely cheap, it's a golden small box, but inside both the chain and the pendant come separatedly packed in a small ziploc-like bag, so if you buy this with the idea of giving it as a present, I would advice you to find some nicer box.<br /><br />Other than that, the product arrived earlier (3 days earlier) than expected, which was really good."
3.0,I’m 5’11 and the sleeves were short but not horrible. After about 5 times of wearing it I noticed the seam was coming undone in the back. It was an easy fix to just sew it back up but you get what you pay for
3.0,"It’s still small, hurt my wrest taking it off. Still thank you"
3.0,Great Light weight shirt but it is sooo small. Ordered a large and it's more like a small/medium. Then ordered an XL and it's more like M/L. Definitely size up. Maybe a 3X might fit like I expected the XL would.
3.0,"Bought this dress for vacation next week and the sizes are not true to size. The XL was more of a size 10/12, so I advise buying up. The material was light, and would have made the perfect summer dress!"
3.0,"I received my package pretty quickly considering it came from China. Now obviously, I didn't expect top quality, since I didn't even pay $10 for these, but i already had one of the spirals break, and i have only had them in for a day or two. They also came in a small bag, all mixed together. I had to sort each size out by hand."
3.0,Hems are not sturdy at the wrists. I would have liked it to be a bit longer (for a better wrap/scarf)
3.0,"I ordered a xxl size, I normally take a large or xl, clearly whomever sized these leggings were xxsmall because they know nothing about sizing. I feel like they are going to slide off my butt when I bend, they do not stretch either when you bend or walk up steps. There is no tag to mark front and back so it's however they feel the best on you."
3.0,Not worth the money. Cap is to simple. Poor design.
3.0,Beautiful but ill fitted . I'm Athletic skin with 32dd it's definitely not for larger breasted ladies. I had to keep putting in in place all night which was a bit uncomfortable. I got loads of compliments though .
3.0,Can see through. Very thin material
3.0,I love this shirt. It’s so pretty and comfortable. But I wore it once and the pretty cross cross neckline came unsewn. Begrudgingly I rolled my eyes and spent an hour reseeding it. I should not have had to do that. It might not be made well. But I do love it especially before this.
3.0,Didn’t like the fabric- no stretch at all  I returned it
3.0,After reading reviews I thought this was perfect for what I was looking for. Daily wear I have had no bad reactions however they do not sparkle as I had hoped. To be expected for price.
3.0,"It's an okay shirt. For what you pay, you could go to khols or target, or even Walmart, and get something nicer.  The material is thin, frail, and an odd texture. It took months to arrive, then there were issues with the tracking#, where it said it arrived a month earlier than it did. I know ordering from over seas would take a while, but for the price and what you get, you're better off going to a store near you."
3.0,The case is soft and will not help me in my travel needs. It gets easy bent with little pressure. Also the zipper is not as sturdy
3.0,"These are more for dresses and long tunics and they are see through. They run extremely small, so order a few sizes up."
3.0,Soft and comfortable but a bit thin. Would definitely wear a slip with it. Ordered the green but thre dress I received was unambiguously brown.
3.0,"Demasciado pequeña casi no cabe nada, el dinero debe ir doblado y pocas cosas."
3.0,Didn’t like the cut of sleeves or top. Too tight.
3.0,One earring had a bump on it like extra material.  I sanded it off and painted the spot with &#34;pearl&#34; nail polish and it looks fine.  Intend to wear these in summer when out on a boat or swimming so didn't want an expensive pair. They look nice now.
3.0,"I like this jacket, but I  too trusting.  I did not take a close look at what was represented as a new jacket when it arrived.  A few weeks later during a trip to Europe, I noticed that the back of my right sleeve was severely worn with multiple scrapes.  This was before I had worn it. Ultimately I decided to buy a duplicate because the price was good.  This is a good light weight jacket good for 95% of Texas winter time."
3.0,"The earrings are very cute, but are made poorly. The posts are very thin and flimsy. They bend very easily. I really like them, but I wish they were made better."
3.0,"Stiching on emblem was great, poor fit, head opening too small, belly too tight"
3.0,You need to get a size bigger than needed. Luckily I read the reviews before purchasing and got a pair that fit my children. Unfortunately the quality of one pair was not good at all - the Velcro straps came apart and there’s glue on the side of the shoes. I purchased these in order to paint them. The designs look sharp but I’m afraid they won’t last long.
3.0,"They were fine, but not exactly what we were looking for the purpose of using in the car. Too small."
3.0,"The design is great, however the material isn't very god and only after a few wears it is already looking worn down."
3.0,"I bought this for my little niece. You get what you pay for. It obviously is not top of the line, but it came in one piece, did not look too cheaply, but again this was for a child. she was happy with it."
3.0,This shoe is not for those of us that carry a little weight. Felt like it would break. But super cute. I was forced to return. Didn't work for me
3.0,"3 stars for inconsistency. I absolutely love 90 Degree leggings but sometimes you get a dud. I have a black pair that has been immaculate and a plum pair that had some thread separation but nothing I couldn’t just knot off and trim, seams were still all intact. This pair, the Sage, completely came apart! I wore them for maybe 10 minutes? Thank goodness for Amazon amazing return policy. Not sure if it’s this particular color that has bad seams or just this one color. They are still superior to the other brands I’ve tried so just make sure you check them over, try them on and make sure they are okay to keep or if you need to return."
3.0,"One pair was so much smaller than the rest it immediately ripped, two pairs were large and one other was a little tight but okay. Not consistent."
3.0,I do not like the black in this style . The material is too cheap and flimsy especially for a curvy person. Go for any The material in the other colors are good.
3.0,The mask is too long and large so it doesn’t fit properly on the face.
3.0,"It's okay but it is much bigger than my Pandora charms. That's not the company's fault, I didn't check the size before I ordered it."
3.0,they look nice put a bit pricey....
3.0,Fabric becomes weird and not soft after washing
3.0,"Difficulty in inserting band into holding slot’ in some charging devices, when magnetic  ‘coupling’ takes place…"
3.0,"These earring are everything I needed. But, two of the hoop earrings broke after one wear."
3.0,The opening for the head was kind of small.
3.0,"Product looks exactly as pictured. It feels cheaply made and if you plan to wear it on your neck this is not for you. It feels like the plastic is melted together at the clip on your neck and scratches you. Now, other then that it’s Luna Lovegood so I like it."
3.0,Shorter in person than in the photo. The fabric is soft but thin. Would not recommend.
3.0,"its ok, not fitted at all like in the picture, it's baggy."
3.0,"Shipping was quicker I expected,earrings are small for me,in the picture looks bigger."
3.0,"I thought it would have been a little more solid, it feels cheap not great"
3.0,"These are Not crew socks!  The cuffs do NOT fold down.  The cuffs are SO tight, my feet went cold with some numbness while wearing!!<br /><br />LOVE  the colors & little sparkles!!<br /><br />Wish the cuffs were a-LOT looser!!!"
3.0,"Had to return because I'm top heavy, but it is a cute suit."
3.0,From the advertisement the lettering looks black but it isn't. It looks like it is just etched in with nothing to come to the attention of paramedics easily.
3.0,"My daughter loved it. Me, not so much. So I compromised with a three. Take from that what you can."
3.0,"I know that even the product description says these 'run a little small' which is the understatement of the year. the Skin color variation in XL that we ordered looks more like a normal medium, they're a foot across even after stretching and pulling trying to get them on. The material is somewhat soft and silky. The size is far, far more than 'a little small.' I seriously suggest if you wear an American medium the XL or maybe the Large from Toponechoice would possibly be a fit for you. It's very hard to judge the proper size to order because they run so small. They do come in a rather beautiful gift-box.<br />I received this item in exchange for my review."
3.0,"these are odd fitting. They do not accommodate some areas. I don't know how sizing works where these were made, but we need bigger crotches in the U.S."
3.0,Texture of material not as good as expected
3.0,More like leggings than sweats. Made to fit thin men.
3.0,It’s beautiful but too small for the ear
3.0,No a big fan of the print on the front it’s kinda faded and doesn’t look like the picture otherwise it’s comfy
3.0,"I own a total of 7 PattyBoutik sweaters (I was hoping this would be my 8th)  as well as 3 dresses. The sleeves run long on most of Patty's items that are long sleeved, so I wasn't completely caught off-guard -- but they've never been unmanageable.  These were just ridiculous.  I gave it 3 stars still for the style and quality. It's a beautiful sweater, just wish the sleeves were shorter! For reference, ordered a medium at first and returned for a small. Small fit everywhere but sleeve length. I am 5'5"" 130lb, 30H (UK size) 38-27-37."
3.0,"Loved the earrings, however/unfortunately from afar they look like men's private parts.  The silver waves on the sides and the top of the lighthouse, my bosses took me aside and requested that I don't wear then at work.<br />Sad because I totally love them but I do understand.<br />Get rid of the waves at the bottom and make them sparkley/colorful.  I will buy again."
3.0,Product is pretty but VERY tiny. I was very disappointed in the size for the price.
3.0,It was cheap and fell apart before I had a chance to wear it.
3.0,"I bought this for my niece, she usually wears a small-medium. But the medium is way small. Also the fabric is not soft . Cute design, but im returning this."
3.0,"These are advertised as VERY green. The product I received is literally a Tiffany & Co/robins egg color. I mean it’s still cute, just not AT ALL what I was expecting."
3.0,padding sits more posterior than the need
3.0,Love the bracelet but very hard to put it yourself to close it.
3.0,"I am 5.10 and they were way too long for me. Beware the material is &#34;NOT&#34; cotton/spandex as advertised, the material is &#34;rayon/spandex&#34;."
3.0,Nice hat but the silk liner should be at the top of the hat too so it protects your edges
3.0,"I bought an Awesafe and HL brand hearing protector prior to buying the Earmor brand headset. Although they look like the same headsets, the Earmor brand's sound amplification is far inferior to either of the other brands. If you buy the Earmor set, get them as a gift for someone that you don't like much."
3.0,Looks much brighter in photo
3.0,I like this shirt but the material feels almost sticky. The v neck also isn’t as deep as the picture.
3.0,"I am torn on how to rate these. On the one hand they are awesome and my Daughter squealed when she got them. On the other hand one shoe stops lighting up after 5 min if it even lights up at all. So basically it is crushing because they are so awesome while working but one shoe only works for 5 min and sometimes not at all! They are a tease! I am so disappointed that my daughter had to have something soooo cool just to have them not work the way that they should. I read the other reviews with the same problem and I just thought well, only the people who have a problem review. This probably won't happen to me. Well, it did and now I am reviewing my problem in hopes that the company will work to fix this problem so we don't have more disappointed kids."
3.0,"Super cute, but beware of size. Definitely get bigger than usual."
3.0,"I like the weight of this top, and I bought it for layering...good thing I was planning on wearing it as a bottom layer because it is super short (more like a petite than a regular-sized top. I do usually like longer shirts, as I have a longer torso, but this is exceptionally shorter than most normal shirts."
3.0,I think price should have told me 🤔
3.0,Sadly a few of them either broke or turned color. They are very beautiful though
3.0,Such a cute style but ran small especially the arms🥲
3.0,"These were rather misleading. The way they are advertised is 3 for the price, but you only get 1. If you dont read the whole page you wont realize this. They are decent quality and bigger than I expected. The disc it rolls into is larger than I expected but easy enough to use. I rarely use this though, as it just is not as sturdy as I expected and it only fits a handful of things."
3.0,Good for wearing around the house. Fair quality. Bright colors.
3.0,"Very small, my daughter's little wallet will not even fit in it. Other wise very cute and well made"
3.0,"I ordered this primarily because I wanted a V waistband. When I first put it on, it felt great. Smooth, nice and thick, perfect to keep me warm for when it gets cold again. Not transparent at all! But, the V waistband completely disappeared. Ended up looking like a regular u curve type of waist. The price was good but ultimately did not work for me. I usually am a size 4 so I got the S and it fit fine - but I guess my waist is too wide or isn't the right shape to maintain the V shape?"
3.0,sleeves are tight
3.0,"I got a large I'm usually a medium it's too small looks and fits like a small it does have stretch though and quality is good, go up at least 2 sizes for a loose fit"
3.0,A little small for my taste.  BUT very pretty!!.  If you like earrings a little smaller and less chunky... Get these... You will not be disappointed.
3.0,"I am petite.  5'0, 122 lbs and this coat did not fit well.  I got size Large after reading reviews that it ran small and that the Large fit well.  However, it was rather big in the sleeves and looked awkward even after I tied the belt around it.  I prefer a clean, chic look, similar to what is shown in the advertised photo.  Also, the color was a bit faded as it was not the bright red shown in the photo.  Overall, it did not feel like a quality coat.  The coat looked more chic in the photo advertised and created an idea that I would have received a decent quality for such an inexpensive price such as shown in the photo."
3.0,"I got the Small size after going through Amazon's Generic Sizing Chart for Gloves, and even though the gloves fit my palm, the fingers on the gloves are too short, so they don't go all the way to where my fingers meet. I could have used a larger size, but I am not sure if they would have fit my palm.<br /><br />Overall I did not mind the gloves being a little small since they were going to be used for a halloween costume."
3.0,really nice quality a little smaller then i expected but still beautiful
3.0,"Three stars bc while they look similar to the image they don't look the same. Kinda wonky as if they were cut on an off angle. They are alright, just not what I was looking for or expecting."
3.0,"Meh, felt very comfortable but provided no support. Seem like a good option for walking around in the summer but not for aerobics or lateral movements"
3.0,"I purchased these thinking that with the Thinsulate, that they would be very warm.  The look is nice, as well as the quality, however, in my opinion, they are mild weather/driving gloves.  They don't keep my hands warm in temps lower than 40 degrees.  Will be great if you need a nice looking glove.  If you need warmth, check out something else."
3.0,Too large on bottom and fits weird on the top half. Waiting on refund but they have been fast to communicate
3.0,the quality on the buttons were just like the picture! And the stickers were really great! BUT! The lanyard quality is really weak
3.0,Fits great and cute shoes but the bow came right off. Now there’s one shoe with a bow and one without.
3.0,Needs to be thicker  - higher quality - but will work - ok - as a face mask -
3.0,Loved how they kept everything organized. One came with the mesh ripped. Wish there was a way to contact seller to have gotten it replaced.
3.0,"After I received this band, I found I had to buy a watch band adjustment kit to make it fit.  That was annoying."
3.0,"Fit was flattering, I was not blown away by the material or stitching. I did have to wash it and let it air dry for some time as the material was quite stinky."
3.0,I'm giving 3 stars because the size are too small. My wedding band is 5 and the silicone rings are 6 and they are small. That's the only issue.
3.0,Stones were a bright orange not the amber look but I will use it for certain events
3.0,I like the design but it looks fake and like a shiny plastic almost. I don't see where it says it is .925 on the charm or chain. Was going to give this as a gift but decided not to because of the look.
3.0,There is no coating on the stem so it rubs the back of your ear and hurts!
3.0,Very fragile... Breaks easily if you're not gentle
3.0,"The picture made them look very appealing but, in reality not so much."
3.0,"I'm normally a Large in hoodies, however I wanted something a little more baggy so I order a 1XL....it just came & it fits like a medium. Zero stretch. I'm hoping through some wear it'll move a little more"
3.0,Cant really breath with it on and the filters
3.0,I purchase this dress to wear for Easter and went a size up and realize I should of never did that because it was super big. The quality and everything was beautiful though.
3.0,A bit pricy compared to other that I've seen.
3.0,It's comfy but it balls up/pills on the sleeves very quick. I washed it on delicate and hung it to dry and still had this issue. I noticed the pilling on the sleeves the third time I wore it.
3.0,Purchased for a weekend trip. The bag came unthreaded on the last day.
3.0,Beautiful design but a bit tight around the ears. Gave it to my 11 year old.
3.0,"These sunglasses look great. I bought these instead of Ray Bans that I usually buy, but I found out the same company makes these also (Luxottica). From what I understand this company bought up all the other eyeware companies and moved manufacturing from Italy to China. I have been buying Ray Bans for years and have at least 6 pairs. There is a huge difference in quality between the Italian made glasses vs. the Chinese ones. They end up falling apart after a few months of use. These glasses were not made in Italy and this is the last chance I will give Luxxotica with this purchase. If these glasses start falling apart in the near future I will post an other review."
3.0,Its okay I guess. Its very hard to put on and super bad quality. I needed my friend to help me put it on
3.0,"The color is perfect and it fits well through the chest and shoulders. The sleeves are a bit narrow and it's quite a bit shorter on me than on the model (and I'm only 5'6&#34;). The fabric is also much thinner than I anticipated from the photos, so I'm not sure how long it'll hold up, but for now it looks pretty nice with a pair of leggings."
3.0,I like the cap but I don’t know if I love the stamped logo. It’s a little faded to my liking. I love the sopranos !
3.0,These are nice glasses and are exactly like QUAY MINI but UNFORTUNATELY I wanted the standard Quay size and why I was so comfortable with ordering a pair of sunglasses online.
3.0,"Very nice material, beautiful top but little too big for me.."
3.0,"I got these for my 4 year olds swim class, they suction great but the tightening clicker doesnt hold the strap tight. I got a different type of strap and now love the goggles for her"
3.0,"These were way to long, super cute but had to return!"
3.0,This is too big for my average size face. Quality seems good.
3.0,It’s lightweight and the color is not as seen on picture
3.0,The material won't comfortable it for awkward
3.0,feel good fit good but after used for a week starting fogging
3.0,"I don’t know, it was super wrinkly, and because of the seam placement it’s difficult to iron. I steamed it and it looked a little better but still. The back gapped a lot on my body. I’m 5’1 and 106 pounds with an athletic build, and the torso was too long on me and the zipper gapped a lot in the back. No lining either.  I hemmed the bottom to fall just beneath my knee and I added back darts so the zipper wouldn’t gap. That’s a ton of work for a cheap dress. And I only wore it once as a newscaster costume. But it has a lot of stretch if you need it. And an ample bosom area."
3.0,Not elastic enough and keeps nagging around the ears
3.0,Kinda cheaply made but my daughter loved it
3.0,Material feels nice but it does ride up and definitely needs more space in the pouch area!!!  Won't be purchasing this again.
3.0,"It is a shame that I had to return this top.  Very soft linen and well made.  The back and sides are very short with the tails tied.  If left untied, it looks weird.  I would not wear this to the office with my waist exposed.  I feel this brand is not true to size.  I'm 5 ft 1 inches, weight 115 lbs and purchased the medium.  It is not too big, it fits just right."
3.0,Can’t expect much for the price. Worked for what I needed which was to see better into the water while fishing. Upgraded to a more comfortable pair soon after.
3.0,Didn't particularly care for it.  Cheaply made
3.0,Like them and ware often.
3.0,So these thermals are NOT cotton thermals. I wear Med but got the large and it’s still tight. They’re not soft. I’m just not pleased with them.
3.0,"I liked the looks of the watch, but had to send it back. The band was to big."
3.0,"I was surprised by how little merchandise there is for the parent trap so I was so glad to find this! Its great no complaints! I would suggest having a pair of these where one says you’re the Annie to my Hallie and you’re the Hallie to my Annie cause usually with keychains that say something similar to this, they would have options for both ways! Again, well made and looks great!"
3.0,"Somehow, I did not like the stich. The fitting is not perfect, it is little big.  The front opening and the buttons are not so good on this shirt.<br /><br />The material is soft and goes very well on light blue jeans."
3.0,"I took a risk ordering this style and sure enough, it was not flattering to me. If you are large chested, you will not want to order this style. It is tight across the chest and baggy underneath, emphasizing the chest even more. This particular fabric was a cool print but way too thin with no body in the actually fabric quality. I’m going to stick with A-line dresses for me. :)"
3.0,"very pretty top, but fits way too tight.  I usually wear a small, but in this, I would probably order a large.  Returning it, but really did like the fabric and color."
3.0,This product is very warm and comfortabal but the quality is not very good
3.0,Runs small but they are cute.
3.0,The picture on the order page shows a crown and that is not what arrived. It is the wig and ears ONLY... Quite deceptive. Would return it if I didn't happen to have a crown here already....
3.0,I bought this shirt and was not a fan of it. Fit TTS and is longer then most shirts I buy online (great because I'm tall). I ended up returning it because it reminds me of a maternity shirt.
3.0,Super cute t-shirt only been washed once (inside out) and the lettering is starting to lift off the shirt
3.0,"These feel nice against the skin and hold you in place during normal activities. I do wish that the leg was a bit longer. After a few hours, the leg openings stretch a bit which may lead to your boys poking out to say hello there by needing to readjust yourself. Fortunately, this is only if you're extending your leg like when getting into a car or onto a bike. The pouch isn't as ample leading to feel a bit smushed. The material is holding up and the stitching is not unraveling after several washings. Don't go mountain climbing in these. Perfect for relaxing around the house."
3.0,I love the comfort although they didn't seem to keep the cold out very well. They are soft and comfortable but unfortunately they ripped on the second day of wearing them as the picture shows.
3.0,"For whatever reason, this hat does not fit me right at all. I am not fond of the ball topper either, needs more fur to give it fullness to help the hats shape....(maybe-shrug???)<br />Good luck to the maker of these hat's. Not trying to be rude but to help you with your product. So that maybe one day I can buy one and it fit just right. Too much top too.😊"
3.0,"Iron nor steamer worked. The liner is too thick. Maybe cute around the house, but otherwise not very flattering."
3.0,"This nightgown was pretty and fit as expected, however, the fabric was strange. The sleeves will literally stretch out at least a foot past my hands when pulled. The fabric is very heavy. I wouldn’t buy it again."
3.0,Beautifully made but ridiculously undersize!
3.0,Had to go a size up from M to L on this one.  I've bought other dresses from Floern and mediums fit perfectly.  Great dress for the price though!
3.0,"This dress is cute, not gorgeous. I like the deep green color but wasn't crazy for the print. The fit is small, which is why I'm returning it."
3.0,"Cute, but it doesn't glow in the dark!  I still like it, though."
3.0,Blouse looks great in the picture but doesn’t appear to look the same when it was received.
3.0,"It's a little bit wrong, but still cute. hemline at the waist is crooked and parts are cinched with other parts not cinched. Somehow it's still adorable."
3.0,do not like the band/its too short and to hard to fasten /otherwise its fine
3.0,"great for exercise,"
3.0,This cap doesn't fit me as well as others I have bought.
3.0,"The picture that was put in the shirt is already fading, peeling, and coming off.  Wish it was made better because I live the design/pic on the shirt"
3.0,1st dress I ordered was as advertised.  I had to exchange the size. Second dress I got was not at all what they advertised. Annoying.<br />The first one was real cute but tight fit. Second dress was ugly.
3.0,"It's a cute charm, affordable, but it's already showing what I'm guessing is the brass or something under a coating of silver. It's not enough to notice by others but it's ok for the price."
3.0,"This dress is very pretty and great for vacation. It's fun, laid back and has a tropical vibe. I like that it's strapless (no crazy tan lines).<br /><br />The top doesn't feel like it's sliding off or like it's too tight. The pockets are nice and deep. The colors are vibrant. The fabric is cooling.<br /><br />I do feel like my arms look big when I’m wearing this, but that just might be my arms. The dress hugs my curves and gets flowy at the bottom.  The fit is great, even for a petite person like me. I can get away with wearing the dress with flats. For reference, I'm 5'2 and 125 pounds.<br /><br />I think the dress is a bit expensive, but otherwise it's nice."
3.0,"It’s warm , not see through. Color is nice and just like shown"
3.0,Too big looks like a snap chat crown. If that's what you're looking for then it's perfect.
3.0,Ehhh. It's loud. The plastic hooks and the plastic rings clink making it difficult to stalk. The amount of stuff you can jam in there is great. The bag doesn't sit against your body so the load shifts with every step. We bought 5 last fall. From adults down to brand new teenagers each of agreed they could be softer material and quieter. And 2 of the 5 we purchased had trouble at the seems starting to seperate from carrying a couple water bottles and the days food.
3.0,"The colors on the tutu are bright just like the picture.  My daughter squeeled when she saw it. My only complaint is that one side of the underskirt was obviously sewn on wrong. The seam was showing. I bought it for her birthday party outfit just for fun, so I didn't worry too much about it. I had to take scissors and trim the extra fabric so it wasn't so obvious. It's a good colorful tutu for a special occasion, but I wouldn't feel confident to say you would get a lot of wear out of it."
3.0,Got them in in 2 days with my prime account so fast shipping but one of the buttons that holds the strung tight to your wrist was broke so it can slide freely
3.0,"I LOVE this necklace so much.  But it's my 3rd one.<br />They keep breaking at the hinges.  But while it lasts, it's perfect!  I hope this one lasts longer."
3.0,I really like how it keeps you tucked in and straightback BUT it lifts up your chest area very exaggeratedly and they tend to hurt during and after you remove. Definitely do not use at all.
3.0,Wrinkles after washing
3.0,If you have a larger chest sizing up is a must.
3.0,It's comfy but I look like I cut holes in a parachute. I'm only 2 weeks postpartum so I still have some extra weight and I even sized down and it's still HUGE. It has no shape at all and the v cut doesn't even go down very far. It's like a moomoo
3.0,I may not have bought this cosplay but my daughter was looking at it and almost bought it before noticing how they yin Yang balls on the cosplay are not there other then that I might buy it
3.0,I am kinda disappointed. I got this dress for hoco and the slit was WAY to high and went all the way around and showed my goods. I’m 5’0 so if your tall and getting a large. DONT.
3.0,I liked it but I really wanted it to be engraved.
3.0,it looks bigger than it actually is
3.0,It’s great but the rubber breaks easy
3.0,"The skirt is a knit material, making this much less formal than I expected from the photos. Definitely not what I was expecting."
3.0,So incredibly disappointed! The white in the skirt doesn’t match the white top! The white is more a cream color on the skirt where the top is a pure white. Adorable otherwise. So bummed!
3.0,"Lens are good, but not as good as the originals. They get kinda rainbows at certain looks."
3.0,"Cute-a very bright, almost white silver."
3.0,"The earrings are adorable on my 10 year old but to make it clear it doesn't have 12 different pairs of earrings, it has two identical pairs of each of the six styles.  I was disappointed but decided to keep them as my daughter tends to lose earrings anyway."
3.0,This dress was to crept and unflattering for me.
3.0,Not as tight as i thought it would be near the legs but overall not too bad
3.0,It’s super cute.
3.0,Just a flip-flops. Nothing special.
3.0,its not as wide a band as I expected
3.0,"Not true to size, clean fits like a medium."
3.0,"Fits smaller than I wanted it to but I kept it to wear under vests, etc."
3.0,it is large for my face
3.0,next time upload the correct picture with the correct color
3.0,Didn’t look good on 😕
3.0,Cute but too small. I wear a L/XL this fits like a XS/S
3.0,"The earrings were cute, I, unfortunately, was not able to wear them, since they fell apart. I reached out to the seller and they were kind of enough to give me my money back. They offered me a replacement, but since I had ordered these for a specific event that already passed, I was happy they refunded my money instead."
3.0,"Little bit smart than I expected,  returned."
3.0,"Arrived as expected. The dress is made of thick cotton but not unbearable for summer. The pockets stick out making the dress look awkward. I am normally a medium to large, I went down a size due to reviews of the dress being more like a bodycon....I would have been happier if there was an extra small option. I don't know if it was worth the 20 dollars I paid for it but it's simple and  the pocket issue can be fixed with a denim jacket so I'll keep it."
3.0,"it says it is for up 44&#34; waist, that is true if don't want the chain to hang down for a stylish look. It is a beautiful chain. But if your like me & want the trend look better order 2."
3.0,"I like the dress but the pockets are high up  on side. You have to put hands in pockets and stretch them to come forward. When hands aren't the in pocket, they stick out and make you look wider."
3.0,"Nice looking band, not too heavy, but one side of clasp comes open on its own."
3.0,Nice watch but a bit small for men. Gifted to girlfriend.
3.0,The alphabet L was smaller than I imagined.
3.0,"I found them to be a bit flimsy, but since I was using them as driving gloves it was not a deal breaker. However, for a real biker I would think that they would want to spend a bit more money and get a higher quality glove."
3.0,The lenses are too flat. I was getting back glare.
3.0,"Wear LG,org xl but too small."
3.0,Good quality and my son loved them but despite fitting properly his pinky toes always come out of the sides.
3.0,"Ok, first up ladies, you're going to need to order up on the size. I ordered an extra large and usually wear a large. It's wearable but a bit tight for my taste.<br />Secondly,  the fabric and seams are rather fragile.  I can tell that I will only get a couple of wears out of this item before it completely falls apart."
3.0,Thought it would be a little bigger and it was a dinky little scarf
3.0,"It was an okay shirt, the only thing I didn't like was the shirt was somewhat snug because of the material, and the necklace broke before I even got a chance to wear it."
3.0,Product is not consistent. Only one pair stays in place. Disappointing!
3.0,The actual necklace is very cheap. It is like a black adjustable string? It is a thicker string but not what I was expecting. Still a nice key but  will be getting a different chain for it.
3.0,Absolutely beautiful but it's too large . I expected much  smaller but it's still stunning. It looks like a diamond studded pimple.
3.0,"This is a very pretty grown, but the fabric is quite thin.  Definitely a gown for summer.  I wear a Misses Large-Extra Large depending on cut.  I ordered 2XL, and it just fits, so I definitely recommended sizing UP when you order."
3.0,It did not fit as well as I expected
3.0,"The quality,threads were raveled."
3.0,The shirt for this outfit is perfect and looks as the picture but regrettably I was under the impression that the shorts were more like thighs or biker fitting shorts and they are not . They fit very loose and more like basketball shorts
3.0,I liked them because they are sturdy for the most part but the insulation ripped by the stitching around the lid edge.
3.0,"I have a slightly smaller head, but even after tightening the band, it was still a bit too large. I didn't expect anything fantastic for the price I paid, but the material was nicer than I thought it would be, also sturdier than it looks in the picture.<br />However, shipping process was terrible; package came in a bag and as a result, was very wrinkled. I'll have to try ironing it out or putting something on the brim to weigh it down enough to press the wrinkles and creases out. I also thought the brim would be wider, it's very short at barely 4 inches in length."
3.0,"I was looking for something that had exactly what this bracelet did, but it's pretty lightweight and flimsy. It gets caught on things and pulls off. It also got dirty really fast. I love the idea of it, just didn't work for me."
3.0,"I like the fit and the look of these sweatpants. The problem is they're 100% polyester that is comfortable but is not durable and quickly pills up and looks ratty. Okay for around the house after a workout, or doing some gardening."
3.0,"Good delivery, but the ring wasnt as pretty the picture. Plus one of the stones fell out the same day I got it. But it was worth the .99¢ I paid for it."
3.0,Nice bracelet. The magnetic strength is strong enough to be felt.
3.0,"I ordered these for my Grand daughters birthday party. They did arrive on time. They were way too small. I got the size right, they just didn't fit.<br />Luckily I have several grandkids so I gave them to another kid, and bought the grand daughter a dress instead"
3.0,"I ordered the yellow sweater and when received, it was not the quality that I expected. The fit was average but the knit was a light cotton blend. Where cashmere came in I'm not sure. The neckline was a little out of shape and didn't lie flat. I returned it."
3.0,This item is okay.
3.0,I had to buy a size larger. Runs small.<br />Then in the wash shrunk to the size prior!<br />It's of good quality and very cute but size is the issue.
3.0,"Quality could have been better for the price, higher cap than expected."
3.0,"So I love this dress because it is really cute. The quality is nice and I get compliments when I wear it, but it's hard to wear because the embroidery is really scratchy on the inside. So it hurts my arms especially to wear it. Pain is beauty?"
3.0,"I admit I was disappointed when I received this shirt. First of all, the description says it's 70% Polyester and 30% Cotton, but the shirt is actually 100% Polyester. And it looks like it. Judging from the photo, I was under the impression that the shirt had a soft, cottony feel—a casual, textured linen-look. I even thought the pattern was woven—my fault since I didn't read the description correctly. It does say ""striped print pattern"". Anyway, the shirt does not look at all like the picture to me. The fabric is shiny and resembles rayon more than cotton. The printed stripes look like photographed denim. The other difference is the cleaning instructions: the tag says: ""Wash separately, Professional Dry Clean Recommended"".  I didn't find it to be oversized, but then I am buxom; it gaps at the bust, which is obvious with stripes. That's not a complaint—merely an observation. The construction is ok. It should be cool in the summer. Still, had I seen it in the store I wouldn't have bought it."
3.0,"I got the largest size, but I am busty so it looks bad on me."
3.0,"Good looking and quality seems fine. BUT the band is short. I do not have gigantic wrists, and I can barely get into the first whole. Is this designed for kids only?"
3.0,"It was hugely too large! Instead of returning it, always a bit of a bother, I took it in on the sides to make it wearable."
3.0,"Very cute romper. It was a little tight in the chest and shoulders; I’m 5’5”, 150 lbs and ordered the large. Also, the zipper seems cheap. Only time will tell if it holds up."
3.0,"I had bought a 22 mm version of this band for a another watch and that one was great, I had no issues with that one but this one is not that great. The links stay stuck to each other and it sqeaks when I move it. The clasp does not function properly, it does not close when I push it down I think the pin is not aligned properly, it might be a defect but I don't care to return it. Overall if you get a band that works perfect I recommend it."
3.0,Russell Athletic always was a good product. These new sweat shirts I bought were extremely heavy and I really didn't like the heavy fleece lining
3.0,They did develop a hole on the left side on 4 out 6 items
3.0,"These are advertised as being faux sheer, but they really ARE sheer. You can see straight through them. Everything from toenail polish and tattoos, to scrapes and bruises, or your undergarments will show through."
3.0,"The lapis lazuli and onyx charms are great. The clear one just looks like cheap plastic. The chain is fine. Longer than what I wanted, but too short to double up as a choker."
3.0,Glasses work well at night. Not so well when it's raining.
3.0,"It's a bit lose for my taste, so I have to keep pulling them up.  The tag in the back is very large so I had to cut it as it just bothersome.  They are really cheap, but offer very little compression, I guess they are just right for the price, but I won't be ordering any more.  The quality of the material and the sewing is pretty good though."
3.0,Like the charm but the chain is a little cheap.
3.0,"This is very cute, but it is REALLY thin material and the hat is made for a newborn."
3.0,"This seems like a well made insert, but it was too large to fit correctly in the several cases I tried it on."
3.0,"Flimsier than expected, slight tear in a hole I'll never use, so I'll give it a chance since it was cheap."
3.0,"Case was fine - it was smaller than we anticipated.  Wanted to be able to put cell phone, keys and driver's license in it.  Was just too small."
3.0,I love the hoody but the size is WAY off
3.0,Very cute shoe and I will be happy when my son can wear them. His foot will need to grow a good bit
3.0,I like the ring the fit but it turns my finger green & thats the only down fall of the ring
3.0,It's pink and purple not navy and pink as the picture. Very misleading. But it does fit
3.0,I've definitely seen better.
3.0,too tight and tends to roll down
3.0,This doesn’t look to be very good quality. It’s thin if that’s what you’re looking for to roll up in a suitcase for travel. Otherwise it’s not stiff enough to stand up and looks cheap. I don’t think it’s a nice gift but I do love the black and white stripes! It’s nylon so it would probably hold up fine but the rope is thin. It feels lacking.
3.0,The dress is very pretty! I received many compliments. However the sizing is very off. I read the reviews and vendor size chart. I'm a size 10 and ordered a 12. The 12 was too small and would not zip all the way. I wanted to order the 14 but it wasnt available for Prime and I needed the dress ASAP. I ended up ordering a 16 and guess what? IT WAS TOO SMALL. If you really want to wear this dress do a custom order and send your measurements. The measurements are way off and the size 16 I ordered should've been too big for me. I returned the 16 and kept the 12 because my event was the next day. I wore the dress zipped halfway since I had no other option. Go the custom route to save yourself a headache. Also the cups in the 12 were perfect and not visible. The cups in the 16 were sown in lopsided and it was noticeable
3.0,"If you need to go inexpensive this will work. It is infinitely adjustable and comes with two plastic buckels, but I like a little better quality. I prefer to pay a little more for Mission or Railtek."
3.0,"These fit ok. I am 5'2"" and ordered the small. The length fits good. The waist is fairly roomy (even for my chubby belly) and expands way more than necessary. So it adds a little bulk under your clothes around the waist band. They are comfortable in their loose fit, but I feel that the material can be softer. The cotton is a little bit scratchy feeling. But they are fine for wearing around the house. UPDATE: I lowered my review to 3 stars. The length fit perfect until they were washed. I do not have the patience, time or place to air dry lounge pants. My expensive sweaters and bras, yes, but not cheap pants. I threw them in the dryer on low heat with a few other delicate items and they shrunk. They are now almost too embarrassing to wear alone at home. I do not recommend these pants."
3.0,The item received was not as shown on site. The team logo is only printed once on the flip up rim; not all the way around as shown in the photos.
3.0,"Dice talla 14 y no concuerda en talla, parece de 12"
3.0,"The underside of the arch has a bottle opener built in.  Nifty feature, right?  Well, only if you have nice arches.  These were very uncomfortable for my husband as he is flat-footed.  I do have another friend that has a pair and loves them, so it's all about your feet.  When it comes to size, my husband is a sz14 and the fit was great."
3.0,"They seem to work, but they are too tight for my particular nose bridge, so not comfortable."
3.0,"It’s just feathers glued to cardboard, but it’s fine enough in a pinch. The arm bands are absolutely not sized for adults, however."
3.0,"Looks great. Very original.  Fit great when it arrived. After a wash, the shirt shrunk in an odd way. Still wearable, but fits way tight in the chest."
3.0,It was super cute. Glitter was only super thick on top though.
3.0,They’re ok. Pockets are great. The pants don’t stay up well. I felt like I was constantly pulling up my pants.
3.0,The material is thin so I wore black tight shorts under it. It is nice for hot days and also looked cute over a swinsuit during a vacation. The adjustable straps are helpful in making the dress for well.
3.0,I wear a US medium which to them is a 2XL and it fits somewhat tight. Go one size up
3.0,"Two out of the three were fine, but the one color I really wanted came broken!"
3.0,We got lots of the same charms bit unfortunately they were not attractive.
3.0,updated: the company replaced the necklace at no cost. still love the clasp. this cord is perfect tension for aromatherapy necklace use ...  causes the charm to lay flat making good skin contact. however it is a bit irritating to the skin (2 diff people) ... the charm has rubbed back & forth across the plastic like material coating causing little splits and cracks that irritate the skin<br /><br />original: love the clasp but cord tore in less than 8 weeks
3.0,"not quite what I expected, under skirt is shorts seem a bit long. It will work though to take my son to the waterpark."
3.0,very warm but are already coming apart
3.0,I tried them on and they don't stay on the ear lobe.  They seem to twist.  Haven't worn them yet. This review is from trying on.
3.0,item still was a little too big
3.0,"I wanted these not to show, but they do. Gave them to my daughter, and she likes them."
3.0,"Fits well, however the sequen/shine starts to fall after just one swim! Will definitely look old and worn fast."
3.0,"I gave this item three stars, would have given it four, because I really like it, but the sizing was off. I ordered my size and it was too small."
3.0,"I think this bracelet is very pretty. I have small<br />wrists and the chain is way too long, with no real way to adjust it. I can wear it but have to be conscious of the length or it gets caught/snags on things."
3.0,This is cool but the &#34;jewel&#34; fell out after 3 days. Easy fix with superglue but still...
3.0,"This is such a loose knit that the sweater gets saggier throughout the day.  I thought I would like it but it's just annoying. And because of the loose knit. it's not even warm.<br />The neckline fits really weirdly, which is probably why the photo is a profile. It's not quite a round neckline, not a jewle neckline,  but it's not really squared off either. The neckline is unattractive and lays weird...it kinda chokes me a little because of the way it lays flat across your neck."
3.0,Flimsy material.... kids can't touch it till Halloween when it'll probably break.  Sticky tape was also falling off and had to glue it.
3.0,Cheap and fits well
3.0,Its very comfortable and fits perfect in the back area. I the only thing is that it flattens my bust just a little but. But other then that would buy again.
3.0,"Bought this front closing sports bra because some shoulder and wrist problems on one arm make it difficult for me to close a conventional bra. Unfortunately, closing this item requires firmly grasping the two sides and using both hands to complete the operation.This is very well made and true to size, just not what I needed for my situation."
3.0,"I bought 2 sizes and returned my normal size, which was quite baggy. The next size down fit hreat and gave a nice slim line."
3.0,Waist was too little
3.0,"Shipped very quickly to me, but I didn’t know they’d be so small. Most likely my fault, but can’t use them for much now."
3.0,"Beautiful sweater, vibrant color, however, I had to return and order next size up."
3.0,"a little too big but, it doesn't quite look as cute as it does online."
3.0,"There was a kink in the chain right from the start that I couldn't get out. Also, the &#34;front&#34; of the dangle portion had no reinforcement to stay forward so it often shows the back side only :/"
3.0,Wrinkles too easily.
3.0,I am glad I went up a size because these were still pretty snug.  I like my clothes a little loose so others might be okay.
3.0,This blouse was sewn inside out!  Waste of money. The seams were on the outside of this top. I tried to fix it the best I could but still looks bad.
3.0,used for my belly piercing because I always end up loosing the metal balls for the belly bars and then they fall out however this works great and has yet to fall out.
3.0,"I'm normally a Medium, ordered a Medium, fits like a small"
3.0,Really small; should’ve read some reviews.
3.0,"It's a nice shirt, but it is a litte thin and rough material. I noticed there was a hole in the side the first day I wore it. You get what you pay for though."
3.0,"The material was to hot, maybe different material and mor stretchy it would be a great item"
3.0,"For the price, these flip flops aren't as comfortable as i expected them to be.  They are definitely good quality, just not the level of comfort you would expect."
3.0,"I was so excited when I saw how this chain sparkled, and so happy with the purchase. However, after wearing on a daily basis my hair gets entwined with the chain and it feels rough on my skin. Unfortunately it was beyond the 30 day return policy when I started wearing it."
3.0,The shoes fit fine but the lights stopped working in one shoe within two weeks.  Fun for my son while it lasted.
3.0,"The stones have fallen out on a few. Other wise they are nice, no reaction, metal doesn't turn colors."
3.0,The waist line fit good. I found the butt and legs were a bit loose. Ibam heavier on my top and slim on bottom. I may not wear it to go out but wear at home. The material appeared to be soft and didn't look as if it would fade. Delivery only took a few days. For the price I am keeping it.
3.0,"Item is great, except for one issue.  From the very second I took the costume out of the box, it was loosing stuffing.  Costume is fantastic, I really like it.  But I sadly would not purchase it again due to the leakage issue."
3.0,"I'm 5'7"" 140lbs, so this slender cut fits nicely on me. Sleeves were a good length. The material is thin and not particularly warm.  It's decent for what it is.<br /><br />My big issue is the the general look of the coat is very different from what is pictured. The coat i received has a tapered bottom which flares outwards, giving it a slight ""skirt"" like appearance.  The buttons are big, and somewhat cheap feeling.  Overall, the coat buttons up the right way for a men's coat, however the cut and look gives it the appearance of a women's coat.  Thankfully I was able to return it."
3.0,"It's a cheap vrytiff cardboard hat with black felt finish. Looks fine, but... No 'give' to get it to fit my human head, so it is unusable.  It's a cheap piece for a cheap price, worth no more than the cost at best.  Sent into the round flip-top storage bin for ejection."
3.0,It is tight by the temple
3.0,it took way to long to long to get it.
3.0,"Ordered these for school spirit week and was super disappointed that they are far from yellow. Not even spicy brown mustard is this color. The picture was vibrant yellow with royal blue, and honestly this looks like baby poop and navy. It’s too late to order another pair and have them arrive in time, so kiddo will have to make due."
3.0,These are much chunkier than I had envisioned. They also slide down and become a bit uncomfortable.
3.0,"The pants are great, with the exception of one leg being slightly longer than the other.<br />The fabric is cool and comfortable. They fit great and I've gotten loads compliments when I wear them.."
3.0,"My daughter is small for her ags, so I went down a size and it is still huge. She is 12; I ordered a 10, should have gotten an 8. Very cute! I really wished I had gotten the size right! Oh, well- next year it will fit."
3.0,"I failed to understand the size of these when reading the description.  They are simply too big for my petite ears.  The first time I tried to wear them, they constantly got caught on my jacket as they stick out past my ear lobes.  For someone who likes larger jewelry pieces/has larger ear lobes, these would probably work perfectly.  I love the design and they are good quality.  Nothing to complain about except personal preference.  I will hang on to them to give as a gift."
3.0,"After a few days of wearing the pendant, I have taken it off. It keeps getting stuck to my shirts. I have to peel it off...and it's covered in lint. I think someone forgot to put a protective coating on it. I never had this problem with my phoenix pendant. Very disappointed. Don't think I will wear it again.😞<br />Original review:<br />Very happy I purchased this pendant. It's beautiful. I felt positive energy coming from it as soon as I put it on. Great product. Great company too. It arrived quickly...with a ""thank you"" gift enclosed. I ordered a phoenix pendant from them before and was very pleased as well. I will continue buying from them."
3.0,I had high hopes for this dress unfortunately I had to return it.
3.0,Just not do able for my 97 mom
3.0,It’s was larger than expected!
3.0,It came ALOT smaller than I had hoped. Hax to give it to my wife. She seems to be enjoying it.
3.0,"My glasses kept falling out, afraid I would lose them. Only lasted a few days. Will see how next one does."
3.0,been wearing the ring for about a month now and overall pleased with the purchase. the size (2cm) is perfectly fine if you are expecting it to be a bit bigger than a simple belly ring. all rhinestones are still intact but the silver color does wear off a bit on the corners of the eye. not for sensitive skin.
3.0,This is little large for my feet and also it is more than just the toes it comes half way out of my toes and displays out which is awkward
3.0,"One of the ear ring were bent ! Had to send them back, they looked nice otherwise."
3.0,I loved the print and the style but the arm holes were too snug.
3.0,"Son más pequeñas que el número que indica debe comprar unas tallas más de acuerdo a su pie, pero son muy lindas"
3.0,It literally stopped being able to hold a charge after less than 5 uses.<br /><br />Edit: the seller is sending me a replacement for free! Hopefully this second one will work and I appreciate their customer service.
3.0,"3 pair at $10.99 and that means $3.66 per pair and yup, the quality looks it. The pictures definitely look better than in real life. They are called aviators and there is the basic semblance of the aviator style but they are a little too rounded on the bottom to look the classic aviator type. They sit crooked on the face and will have to be bent considerably to look halfway straight on the face. They came naked in a box without protection. I will not return them because they are polarized and I keep ruining my older pairs by sitting on them or rolling over them with my office chair and so I need these till I can get better quality ones that really look like aviators."
3.0,Strange cut and fit around the waist. I was uncomfortable. But it is well made.
3.0,"Super cute pants overall, but not exactly thick thigh friendly. I'm 5'3 and about 160 lbs, they fit GREAT in the waist in a medium, but I was blessed with thick thighs and a large backside, so the legs were slightly uncomfortable.<br />Overall good pants, just be aware to size up if you're curvy."
3.0,I opened the package and one of them has a hole in it. It looks like someone had it on and returned it. The other was fine.
3.0,The colors are less vibrant than pictured.
3.0,The pattern is pretty & vibrant however it doesn't have any stretch to it so I'm hoping my niece will not have a hard time getting this on & off her baby who is due to arrive in January 2017.
3.0,"Fits a little snugger and is shorter than expected, but is very soft and warm."
3.0,I love everything about this dress. It fit me perfectly however I have to return it because there is a damage in the dress.
3.0,These are cute but the back hurts the back of my feet
3.0,"It was too small.  I Ordered a size up and it was still sticking to me. The material is cheap. Which , I did not mine, because it got here and I wanted a light weight fabric. However, this ran too small. I would by 3 sizes up if I had to get it again."
3.0,It's shiny and kind of cheap looking--surprisingly because it wasn't really cheap.
3.0,Great look but did not fit.
3.0,This case is ok. I wish it has more protection but it is pretty.
3.0,The pendant itself is very nice but the chain broke immediately. We kept the pendant and got a new chain.
3.0,"too big. Good piece, the big size makes it look cheap"
3.0,"I have thick upper thighs, and these shorts just didn't work for me.  I bought my normal size and ended up returning them for the next size up.  Those were too big in the waist and still felt too snug in the thigh area.  I need something with a little more stretch."
3.0,"Loved the pants but they were way too small. I usually get a L or XL with Kerrits, with this one I got the XL and there was no way I was going to fit. Was more a size S or maybe M if that"
3.0,"I am 56” and weigh 152 lbs.  and pretty busty.  If I were to order this item I would order it in an extra large, it shrinks a little and it’s not very big on top.  Material is comfy😊"
3.0,"I loved the color, design and price of this item. However it stated that it was compatible for a Samsung Galaxy 8 plus. I only have a thin skin on my phone but this case was just a fraction too small to fit in this case. I was so disappointed because I loved the look of the case. The company was very good about refunding my money after I returned the case."
3.0,"Thought they were black, continuous red tint frames and lens, compact, not high quality materials used"
3.0,The boots are a heavy but the leather is of good quality. The leather uppers have a matte finish. They run a bit large. I had to return them because of the fit.
3.0,"I wish these had come a little closer to the knee, but I am happy with this purchase."
3.0,"I don't like to leave reviews that are anything less than exceedingly positive, but I received five shirts recently, and this one was probably my least favorite. On a grading scale, I would give it a D+. In other words, it's not a total fail, but it's not something I'll wear that often, if ever.<br /><br />First of all, it didn't fit like an XXL shirt at all. I wear L size clothes sometimes. I'll size up to XXL for comfort. However, this was such an unflattering fit on me, I would swear it's more like a medium?!<br /><br />Also, it's not my preference to wear a shirt that requires you to wear something under it. There are little, like... fashion holes in this shirt? I don't know what you'd call them, but you definitely can't wear this on its own.<br /><br />Even as a hoodie, I didn't love it. I wear hoodies as jackets all the time, but this wouldn't be serviceable as a jacket either.<br /><br />I think I'll probably look for a different home for this shirt. It looks much cuter on the model, so someone out there has got to love it more than me."
3.0,"They are a great shirt! But I would definitely not call them compression, so that was a little disappointing. But definitely a solid tank"
3.0,"The hat itself looks just like what is pictured, and it is really really cute.  I was incredibly disappointed at how small it was.  I can't wear it without getting a headache, and I have not ever had that problem with other hats (just meaning, I don't think I have some surprisingly large head or anything).  The product itself looks well made, but it should definitely be mentioned in the description that it is SMALL.  Might be better for teenagers."
3.0,These earrings are ENORMOUS!!! Should of read it correctly 😔
3.0,Runs small. Pretty color!
3.0,"I ordered this last summer and really liked it.  However, it is different this year.  For some reason the quality seems cheaply made."
3.0,Fit a little too big.<br /><br />Arm sleeves were huge!!
3.0,Would rate higher if they had different hinges
3.0,I like the fit and style and I like the convenience of this jacket .unfortunately I had it on all night and  it barely warmed up ..I dont know if mine was defective..but I am returning it and trying a different brand
3.0,The quality of the material isn’t good. The shirt runs really big.
3.0,They are a bit thin.
3.0,"These are comfortable however, it’s annoying that the green in the shirt and the green in the pants are very different. If you are wanting a matching set this is not for you."
3.0,"I felt really uncomfortable in this. Between my butt cheeks and my boobs, nothing would stay in."
3.0,But a little on the small side. Overpriced.
3.0,"I thought these would last atleast a week handling boxes and working in a warehouse.  But unfortunately, once they started breaking down on day two it was down hill fast. For the price, if your working in a warehousing constantly moving boxes, these are not cost effective. They are very grippy but do not last."
3.0,"ok so the ring fits perfectly, only complaint is that it turns my finger green, so instead of it being my daily, it now sits on it's prop with the other lantern rings, so if you order this ring Do Not Expect to get to wear it for more than a day or two at most, use it as a prop display"
3.0,"I read the reviews before and knew it was going to be small. I ordered to wear under my shirts not to wear solo. This provides NO coverage if you are any thing larger than a B cup. It is cute for the caged look but I recommend ordering 2 sizes up. I am a small 36c, ordered a medium and it still squeezes me."
3.0,I loved this earring when I saw it but when I received it I was disappointed in the size of each individual arch of diamonds. I wished each line of the arch was thicker in width and had larger diamonds - I think it would improve the overall appearance of being higher end/nicer quality.
3.0,Wanted these to work because they had pockets but they do run very small.  Ordered up a size but still too small
3.0,this case was not rigid enough for me to resist crushing. It is otherwise a good case
3.0,they do not absorb as much sweat as I thought they would
3.0,Está bastante bien para su precio
3.0,"This is a cute little coin purse. Exactly what I was looking for. I doubt it will last long as the zipper isn’t very heavy and the material the purse is made from is pretty thin. However for the price, my three year old great granddaughter will love it inside the big purse I got her."
3.0,"Cute, def for a kid"
3.0,The color came in much darker then the picture. It doesnt look as vibrant as the picture. But otherwise its just all right.
3.0,"The jeans are really cute! However, they run really small on me. I currently wear a size 16, so I ordered an XL confident they would fit, they are still too small. This is the first Allegra K item I have bought that didn’t fit too big or perfect."
3.0,"It's easier to breathe through than a cloth mask, but filter on the inside bunches easily making it uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time."
3.0,"These are cute ... the elastic forces your foot back, so these are surprisingly difficult to walk in. The way these are structured, (for me anyway) -- the front part of the shoe is more exposed, and it's easier to trip/drag your feet? THESE ARE HARD TO WALK IN AND THEY MAKE YOU TRIP. and they're so cheap that the leather-colored sole peels off the first time you trip, so that's cute too. but, they come in a size 11. so I bought them in black knowing full well what I was getting myself into."
3.0,It is limited in when a person sees a difference.  Does not work in house.  Need a bright day for best results.
3.0,Everything fit except the top.
3.0,Excelente presentación. Muy lindo
3.0,Loved the fit of this but the first wash the threading came undone in 4 different spots i sewed them back up because I liked it enough to wear it.
3.0,If you're normally a medium get a small!
3.0,Way too big. I bought 0-6 month and my 6 month old isn’t even close to being able to fit it. It will be a waste because it will be too hot by the time she can fit into it. Very cute though. Tutu way longer than expected
3.0,bought this for my husband but he wears glasses and he said the hat really pressed against the frames and hurt his head so he could no longer wear it. disappointing since the model in the picture wears them lol
3.0,"Its a good size, but very thick."
3.0,"This dress is a comfortable knit fabric, and is well made, but it has some fit issues. The sleeves are not fitted as shown in the image. They are loose and required taking in to be flattering. And while I am very short(4’11”) the waist still hit about two inches above my natural waist, rather than right at the natural waist, as shown in the image. Would probably not work at all for taller individuals."
3.0,"These socks should not be advertised for yoga. The first time in downward facing dog pose they slide off the foot. They maybe fine for walking around a slippery floor, but not for yoga."
3.0,weird material and runs small i have aXL and it fits as a medium
3.0,It was tight on my arms I don't think it's a 3xl but was very pretty
3.0,"Frame was too large for my face even with adjustments,,,wish was made in petite size to hug my head better compared to the normal frame same size and strength."
3.0,Not as.flattering as I had hoped. It just hung kind of big even though I orderes a small.
3.0,Definitely shorter than the picture let on.
3.0,"The photo is accurate for what you get - a set of four silver metal bracelets with a set of four matching rings. The rings match the bracelets exactly, which is kind of cool. The bracelets consist of a rope braided chain, an open link chain, a silver metal cuff chain, and a thicker metal chain. They are all shiny but you can tell they are stainless steel, not silver jewelry. All of the bracelet come with extenders except for the open chain link. I found this one hard to clasp. The other ones were easier to clasp but then you're left with a long extender chain dangling from several of them. I guess you could use a pair of pliers to remove them for a less messy appearance.<br /><br />Overall the quality is average - you can tell these are not very expensive. It's OK, more for a teenager than an older adult."
3.0,"They are fine except too short. Inseam on size medium is 27"" you can wear them lower on hips but then the crotch hangs super low & looks odd. Material is thin & breathable ok for casual summer wear. Black is not see through when on. The leg tappers a bit toward the ankle it is not a straight wide leg. Not high quality but is ok if you are shorter. The waist is super stretchy and comfortable. Just wish they were longer, as the size chart stated :( They will be perfect if you are 5'3-5'4 and shorter."
3.0,Gets the job done but is quite small. I’m an average sized guy and this is almost at the largest setting
3.0,"Stitching at the top of the arm started to come undone, but I like the fit."
3.0,"I enjoyed these cubes for my recent trip to India, however, in 2-3 cubes, the zipper broke after one use. However I still use the remaining cubes!"
3.0,"I am a repeat customer for this terrific shirt. Unfortunately for the 2019 version, some of the details have changed.  This fabric is harsher, the cut larger, longer and baggy.  My two other Dylan shirts are cute and beachy.  This style borders on matronly.  I kept the Batik Floral because I am looking for a less sheer fabric but am disappointed that the fit is no longer youthful and fun."
3.0,"The purpose of these cargo pants was met. I was very disappointed in two ways:1. Waistband tie has disappeared into the waistband, and is not retrievable, so I'm going to waist a lot of time fixing that. 2.After washing these pants, the waistband is so twisted. Other than that it served its purpose of keeping me dry,"
3.0,"A little stiff and tight compared to the same bra and size with no pattern. I expected it to be the same material as the same bra with no pattern, but its not and thus isn't as stretchy or soft."
3.0,The leggings fit good...the only problem was the mesh was a little torn
3.0,"Other ?? do not apply, is not shoes."
3.0,Zipper was broken when I opened it
3.0,"This ring is just okay. The gem in the center is HUGE. I mean, it is honkin'. It is in no way believable as a piece of fine jewelry ... not that your average Josephine would be wearing a diamond that gargantuan; but still. I thought it would be much more realistic looking and classic. Instead it's like the cocktail ring your little sister stole from Great Aunt Tess's jewelry box. Disappointing."
3.0,"Loved it at first, all the stitching came out within a week"
3.0,"Not flattering on me. I’m sure it’s fine for smaller bodies but this looked terrible on me. Hit in all the wrong spots and was not flattering. Very cute and good quality, though."
3.0,Nice shirts for the gym. Colors were pretty nice & they fit well.. overall not excellent quality material
3.0,Didn’t like the fit at all. I never wore it and gave it to a friend
3.0,"Food looking mask,my daughter is happy BUT it doesnt seal the upper portion of the nose.perhaps if they were to include an overlap to cover the nose better or some sort of spandex elastic,it could get a higher rating"
3.0,"The actual dress looked nothing like it does on the model. I am 5’6”, the dress length came to my knees, the slit exposed pretty much everything and the top part of the dress was way too low."
3.0,The product came 2 sizes too small I recommend ordering 2 sizes bigger
3.0,"nice hat , didn't fit , too small"
3.0,"The waist keeps rolling down, otherwise I liked these leggings."
3.0,I got 2 different sizes from Prime Wardrobe to see which one would fit better.  The smaller one was too small and the larger one was way too big.  No luck with this brand anymore.  Had to return both.
3.0,Nice dress.  You can tell it's not the best quality but it fits true to size.  I'm 5'2 and 102lbs and It's on the shorter size.  One thing is that it is bulky and I think it's because of the type of fabric.
3.0,Love the way these fit but the waistband isn't attached well in the back so it kind of bunches up. It's not very comfortable. I'm hoping I can tack it down because I really want to love these and don't want to return them.
3.0,If you have any type of muscular legs you will want to go for a bigger size.
3.0,"Its beautiful. I paid $2 for it so it's hard to give it a negative review... but it came chipped.  It's a solid piece and I'll still wear it. If I had paid more I wouldn't have been happy, but for $2 you can't expect too much so I'm happy with it"
3.0,"The clips are so far apart that I can see them in my field of vision, and the ""blue"" is not very blue.  They appear to be more silver than anything, but the case they came in says ""blue"". Otherwise, they clip on easily."
3.0,Fabric was ripped
3.0,"No stretch so if they fit &#34;just right&#34; then when you move, the suspenders pop off. And if they had more adjustment, then they would just be floppy.  They need elastic."
3.0,The texture is good but it’s too loose. I wear size 8.5-9 shoes and it’s way too loose with size small
3.0,"I bought several items from these folks,  this one was a &#34;DEAL&#34;.  Terrific price,  BUT it arrived very tarnished,  AND NOT in the box under cleaning cloth and top cover like  all my other charms from NINAQUEEN.  I have to believe it was preowned. I am extremely familiar with jewelery making,  cleaning and repair so I was able to remove mosg of the tarnish,  but still not in NEW condition. This is a difficult charm to clean as it is a beautifully designed piece with many design elements.  This was for me and not a gift.  All other charms I received from NINAQUEEN received 5 stars."
3.0,I'm happy the product came earlier than the seller predicted. I wear a large and ordered a XL but received a XXL.  It's still small and the material is very thin (cheap).  Watch the sizing on this item!!
3.0,Didn't have as much stretch in the fabric as I would have liked.  I returned it.
3.0,"I actually really like this product, but it's not *quite* what I had expected which is why it gets 3 stars instead of 4.  It is soft and super cozy.  I have no problems with itching like I read in some other reviews, but my skin is not super sensitive.  The material is stiffer than I had expected and does not show body shape well.  It is also smaller than expected.  I usually wear a med (sized between 4-8 depending on what brand I purchase from) and I bought a large because I wanted it to be loose, flowy and long.  I am glad I bought the large instead of the medium because the large fits closely on me like a long shirt  - like I said, it's nice but not exactly what I had expected when I purchased the product. As always though keep the price in mind and know that you get what you pay for.  Overall it's a decent top and I would buy this again, but probably one size up."
3.0,"Because of the material, you do not need to order a size up, I thought it would be very tight and I ordered and XL and it was way too big all over, did not fit in just thighs or back area. Really great material and would look good if fitted properly."
3.0,They were smaller than I anticipated.  One of the bullet ends already came off the cufflink; I'll have to glue back on.<br />The strike mark on the cufflink is pretty cool.
3.0,Seems to run smaller than described but nice looking hat.
3.0,"Realizing the price, these were comfy and served their purpose.  I wore them at a two day outdoor event and had to toss them at the end as they had become thread bare and pilled up quite a bit.  They are great if you need them for just a short while."
3.0,will work-would have liked slightly longer clips also a little stronger clamps
3.0,love the material .
3.0,I did not like the fit and returned them
3.0,"Beautiful watch from Kenneth Cole, however there was no protective piece between the stem and the watch itself, and no plastic cover on the crystal, the watch was running when I opened the package, I would never buy a watch in a store unless it wasn't running and had the stem pulled out or a piece of plastic to keep it from running, so I imagine I'll be at the Mall Watch Station soon, purchasing a $15-$20 battery."
3.0,I wanted to wear this for my workouts but the material isn’t that good for that the fabric its more like a tshirt fabric they are okay to wear around the house but no to the gym
3.0,XLarge was too large Large was a little too small? Nice looking shirt otherwise.
3.0,"My daughter opened this and fell in love with it, but 2 of the seams were ripped. Her size is now unavailable so I can't replace it. Pretty disappointed in the quality"
3.0,"They look great, but tend to get tangled up in my hair. Keep twisting upside down so I end up fussing with them for most of the night."
3.0,"Good quality, non see through."
3.0,"I had read reviews and someone in my office even had one. I am not for sure if I ordered a bad one. If the dress wasn’t too small I would have loved it. I even sized up and it was way too tight. The material was nice, the stitching seemed to be okay. I also noticed that the string for the dress was half of what it should have been it was so short it barely went into a bow around the waist. I’m normally a large/x-large. I ordered extra large and it was right. I’m wondering if I would need a 3x to have it be loser fit and a 2x for it to be a snugger fit. I was very disappointed and I had to send back. I was really hoping this would be a keeper for me. Amazon has already processed the refund and I am adding a star to the review for that."
3.0,"I like this dress. If you get warm/hot with ease this isn't for you. It is long, even with sneakers on I had to adjust the dress or pick it up when walking or I would trip. Overall I like the dress, will cut about 4 cm off to hem it perhaps."
3.0,It's cute but it gets dark really fast😭
3.0,Very nice item and received as ordered. The tie doesn't stay tight when pulled unless I put a double knot in it. Appears the cord is to slippery to keep tight without the double knot.
3.0,"I really like the appearance of this watch strap. However, it's extremely stiff and does not seem to be getting any softer or looser. This means it doesn't conform to the wrist very well and becomes uncomfortable after wearing for awhile. I have worn it every day since it arrived and it's still very stiff."
3.0,Adorable pjs but way to big!!! My babies could not wear them.
3.0,It's not the best fitting hat. Works though.
3.0,"This is an adorable cotton knitted bodysuit for baby. It is so soft and the penguin pattern is adorable! Unfortunately, I looked at the instructions and they are to hand wash. Since babies can go through multiple outfits a day, I don't foresee this having much use! Cute, but impractical."
3.0,"This runs extremely small! I got X-L and I am 5,3” 128 lbs. it feels thin compared with other bamboo nightgowns. Check the size chart closely or it’s not going to fit. It’s the Asian type sizing. It cute but I don’t recommend it.  It takes a week to arrive."
3.0,Runs a bit long had to cut down to size
3.0,I would go a size or 2 up if you’re looking for a casual dress look.
3.0,For a plus size it had not hold at all.  It's true to size i ordered too big. But nice.
3.0,"I like the color and style of this hoodie for my daughter. And the size is exactly like a ladies or juniors size medium you would buy in any store. But I'm not crazy about the fabric. It has too much of a polyester knit feel and the graphics are kinda light, and don't show up as well as they should. However, it's for my 14 year old daughter, who's crazy about BTS and I don't think she'll notice or care. So overall it's a good purchase."
3.0,Fits sort of big. Icahn sew will alter it myself
3.0,I love the style and the material but definately the color beige is see through. Needs to go back :-(
3.0,"As it arrived (June 2018), the dress showed up with a fairly small neck opening (not something I could wear off the shoulder without stretching it hugely), and the armholes were snug on my arms, meaning it didn't drape well. The sides of the dress went straight down and then had a sort of corner before going inwards, not a smooth curve. These were all things I could fix easily with my sewing machine, so I did so, since it would probably cost more to buy sufficient fabric and make it from scratch."
3.0,I ordered the 3XL and it was way too small.  I wear a size 16/18 so you may have to order the 4XL (maybe).
3.0,I did not end up using them for long. Used them for two twice and it seems a lot of hassle to carry them all the time
3.0,Cute but got rusted the first time i used it
3.0,"It's cute, however not true to size. I'm 5'4 and generally an xl. Ordered an xl and it fit, but was snug in the crotch area.<br />Also the ears are placed more like Yoda, not a bear.<br />Onesie you buy, fit it does not."
3.0,"I am only 5'2"" and it was way too long unless I had on sky high heels.  Story of my life so this didn't bother me.  It's VERY pretty and well made for the price.  However, I looked straight out of Little House on the Prairie.  I've seen it look so cute on others, I guess it just wasn't for me."
3.0,the lace break of to eayly
3.0,"easy to put on and take off, but somewhat difficult for her to walk in. They're slippery on tile floors. Also, the bow slips right in and out; it's not sewn in. Just FYI"
3.0,Bought extra large. Each pair fits differently.
3.0,cute but very tight
3.0,I am only 5’2 and this dress was too short to bend over. I would be very self conscious. More suitable length for a coverup. The fabric was much heavier/thicker than I would like for a summer dress. Quite tight in the chest this an XL
3.0,"These have a great sole and support but they are way too big. I ordered a 7, my typical size and they were at least an inch too large."
3.0,"I like the fact that they are really dark, but the spring is very tight and you cannon put them on with one hand."
3.0,They were comfortable but to big. I had to return them.
3.0,"I found that this has a strange, unflattering fit for me.  They are good quality and would probably be just fine for a person with a thin build."
3.0,"Dress is cute, but a little cheap. Also runs a bit small. I would size up."
3.0,"It does what it is supposed to do. That's about all I can say about it. I paid over $50 for it, so I expected it to be metal. The chain is metal, the watch is not. I'm not terribly impressed."
3.0,"Okay, to be fair, I'm not a sleeveless shirt kind of person. I thought perhaps that this would be a compromise, but it actually accentuated the part of the arm I wanted covered. So, I'm probably NOT the best person to be reviewing this top. The pattern is pretty. I love anything with roses on it."
3.0,"Cute as heck. Blue material is polyester, so it isn't soft. Makes me look like I should be working at a diner, not going on a date."
3.0,It came apart in the wash.  The straps weren't sewn on properly.
3.0,This product is more suitable for minor polishing than bringing  a  severely tarnished  piece of silver back to normal. Easy to use - but I find the cream polish far better for any serious tarnish.
3.0,"This hoodie was a birthday gift for my daughter. She fell in love with it. She then brought it to me to tell me that there were two holes in the sleeve.<br />I told her I could return it, but it would take a while for her to get another one. Since she could not wait and she wanted to wear it the next day, I sewed the areas that had the holes. It turned out great, but it was unfortunate that we had to repair something at this price range."
3.0,The first one or two I purchase last year were sold single. They fit great. I ordered the pack of three. And they are large.. very large. They wrinkle up on my arm. I have waited this long to write a review because I hate writing reviews good or bad. I wish I would have wrote this sooner and sent them back to get a smaller size. I will order a smaller size next time.
3.0,"The top fits great, but the bottoms are very small! I have a larger chest, average bottom and wear a 12/14. I will buy some full coverage swim shorts for the top."
3.0,Not a bad set. I am 5'3 and very slim and the pants are a bit short for my liking. Being that the pants are more of a trouser style rather than a legging this length feels a bit uncomfortable. Overall the material is comfortable though. Not the softest but also not rough. I just wish the pants could have been a bit longer for a more relaxed fit.
3.0,"These sunglasses look great from far away but up close it's not the best and it feels kind of flimsy. The roses and the lens are the only things that looks good. The bridge, topbar, and from the end piece to the ear piece are just bad. The metal looks so dull and gritty that I just wished they would have polished it or at least made it the same color as the roses on the lens. But overall it fits well and it looks decent so three stars for now."
3.0,It was ok. Not what I was hoping for
3.0,"For someone with better dexterity, I am sure it works great  I am not the most coordinated person, so it works in a hit-or-miss fashion for me.  Unfortunately, I have not seen anything better."
3.0,Neckline is too low.
3.0,Sise runs mall
3.0,The heart is faded on the corner or not completely there. The heart has a stain on it and material isn’t the greatest...
3.0,"These socks were great, but we ordered 2 differy sized packages and both times, the bows on the sock came off almost immediately the very first time they were worn. She was not doing heavy lifting or energetic, just regular little girl activity. They fell off after just walking around. Very sad. Grandma has extra sewing jobs that is unnecessary."
3.0,2 month delivery<br />Cheap as #%=÷#%^&**
3.0,"I really wanted to love these socks, as I was looking for socks with compression and cushion. I love the cottony feel of these socks  and the cushion is wonderful, but if your looking for really good compression, these might not be the socks for you."
3.0,"So cute, but thing fall out. It doesn't have high and stable sides, so anything heavy can fall out when you unsnap it."
3.0,So overall not bad. Wish they had a smaller size then the one I got. To big for my overall frame and size but cute. I had to pin it in the back to not make it so baggy.
3.0,Medium fit like large on me maybe it’s the “boyfriend” in the description makes the cut very loose. Its like the waist is med the thigh area is large and med again at the knee. It’s cut highwaisted which is great for my body. The tag says 42 if I had known that vs small medium or large choices  I would have ordered a 39 or 40. It doesn’t follow shape of the butt.  It is a good color and very cute distress look. I can still wear but not for a sexy fitted look with a tucked in shirt unless I get it altered. Should be fine with a shirt worn outside of the skirt. I’m 5’5” 140.
3.0,"This skirt is very small, and the fabric is rough to the touch. It is cute though."
3.0,"You get what you paid for. Way too small up top for me, but I'll hand it off to a friend whom it will fit. Very light t-shirt material. I can imagine this will stretch in all directions once worn and washed."
3.0,This is a great watch until daylight savings. Arizona does not go to daylight savings time. The watch set itself to daylight savings. I set it manually because it would not let me set to a different time zone that matches AZ. IT RESET to daylight savings. Not a good thing for hubby with dementia and can’t mentally understand that it’s set an hour ahead and it’s not really that time.
3.0,"If you want a skin right then order these in your regular size.  The do roll up when you sit down.  The material is soft, the arm holds are proportionate.<br />I would not recommend these."
3.0,Not highest quality but very beautiful
3.0,THIS PRODUCT WAS A GIFT AND FIT MY SHORTER FRIEND REALLY NICE...I BOUGHT A PAIR FOR ME AND THEY WERE WAY TOO SHORT
3.0,"It was SO cute, minus the fact that it was way too short. Not for tall girls."
3.0,"Its ok,  can work with fits big tho"
3.0,"Very easy to put on without working with clasps, etc.  It matches my other black onyx jewelry with a nice presence."
3.0,Does not fit all despite large adult size.
3.0,"I THOUGHT the picture looks better, lol.. Its OK, wouldn't get again NOR recommend it.. Had it 3 weeks now & already unthreading & falling apart.. Also very thin & small.."
3.0,"I love this pattern so much! The material feels soft and almost like a knit. But it’s very, very clingy and stretchy. That in itself might be fine — although I wish the skirt portion were a bit more flowy to minimize some of my curves. The problem is that the fabric is white on the inside with the print on the outside. Wherever it stretches to cover bust lines or curvy butts, it shows the lines of white through the material, making it looked stretched and lighter than the parts of the dress that are not stretched. This will highlight any less appealing bumps or curves you might have. The dress fits me well, but it’s just too clingy for me to wear confidently (although if I were looking at me wearing it, I would think she looked good). The patterns on all these dresses are amazing, so I wish the fabric were slightly less clingy and a bit more forgiving. If you are less curvy and able to wear it without stretching the fabric so much, this dress would be divine and show off everything. I am not the consumer for whom this dress works well."
3.0,"It is kind of large, I am in between a small and a medium, ordered small and it was still kind of large. Yes, you can adjust it with the straps and could work but the leg opening portion doesn't really open just by walking or standing like on the picture, you literally have to open it yourself which is not the style I was going for. The material is good, the print is nice too."
3.0,"I like the color and the material seems to be of a good quality and it basically fit as expected. I also liked that it hangs low enough to cover my belly, but not so low that it looks like a dress. The reason for the 3 stars is the straps. They are placed very wide and I do foresee them persistently slipping of my shoulders. But other than that it looks really nice and I like it."
3.0,Arrived splattered with some sort of dirt or water and scratched in two places. Not worth the price.
3.0,"Fit is good, but not a &#34;Super Soft&#34; as described. They have a fairly loose weave which you can feel on the feet. They're OK, I just would have liked them to feel much softer."
3.0,Pants SUPER long but thigh area super tight. And jacket is too small.  pants very tall girl friendly
3.0,The leather and trim on this unit is great and I was able switch out my old school belt style strap on my Coach watch with little problem. However the easy release bars at the end of the straps were just long enough to fit in the holes on the watch head. I ordered the exact size (23) so it wasn't a sizing issue. I had to pry the spring assist rods out and insert slightly larger more robust rods. But......it looks great and so does my coach watch now.
3.0,"The quality is really good, however I'm 23 years old and I could fit it and my brother, who I originally ordered it for, couldn't. He's 9 and it's in the 5th grade.."
3.0,Ordered an XL and I wear a size 14/16 and it was too small.
3.0,Not the most comfortable but they work
3.0,It looks great !
3.0,The top was pretty good for the price. Like the color.
3.0,Look better in photo.  Cheap material and didn’t stand up nicely when put on. Worse purchase I ever buy for costume.
3.0,It fit well enough. The seam work was so so.
3.0,"the waist band is sinched super tight, make the rest of it hang on you"
3.0,"It's tall enough to hold my iPhone 7 plus.  The problem is that it doesn't expand much in depth.  I can put my cards and ID's in but I can't flip through them, not even a little.  Just have to take the whole stack out to fish out what I need.  I'm not sure if the middle pocket is supposed to functional or not.  It just too tight.  I cannot put my cards, keys and phone in the purse at the same time and close the flap.  So it's good if you just need to carry a few things around but not as an everyday wallet, which so too bad because it is really nice looking and have gotten compliments on it.  The button opening in the clear part is really convenient with my iPhone."
3.0,"The size of stone is good, not to big not too small and seems good quality. BUT for me the bar is too thin and falls out easily. I had another brand in for a couple years without changing and never fell out. The good thing is there are plenty to replace"
3.0,Make sure you pin it to your head!! It tends to not stay on your head
3.0,Too small. My son went from 2T/3T to 3T/4T (what seems like) overnight. We ordered these in 4T so we could get plenty of use out of them this coming 6 months or so. We’ll be lucky if they fit a few weeks. After a wash and dry they are actually smaller than some of his 3Ts in other brands. Disappointed cause they’re cute and wish they were sized more accurately.
3.0,"Very nice earrings , just very very small."
3.0,"I wear a large and that's what I bought, but this dress runs large.  I'm ok with that 'cause I just going to lounge around in it.  The fabric is soft and the price was right.  The orange/gray combo reminds me of a clown outfit, but it's ok, as it serves my purpose."
3.0,Just fit very awkwardly.
3.0,A little small in the waist compared to the last pair I had
3.0,Pretty good quality for how much I paid for it! Very happy.
3.0,This was okay to wear. Comfortable and stylish but nose ark was off center a bit.
3.0,"I’ve been searching for a smaller sized solo loop for my wrist and this one fits! However, it’s been 2 weeks and the fresh and bright color that it used to be is already faded and looks dull. I’ll have to return this. I wish the stayed nice and bright like when I opened it."
3.0,"Look great, but not for cold weather below 25 degrees F."
3.0,I had to cut the elastic headband inside to keep the hat from sliding up my forehead and coming off. The pinch in the crown is too low and hits the top of my head. Overall the material seems a bit fragile. Looks good though.
3.0,"This watch actually looks great and I received many complements on it. Unfortunately, it would often lose time and can not be relied upon for accurate time. After just 2 months, it completely stopped working. If it didn't stop working, I would be happy... but having a non-working watch on your arm is really lame."
3.0,"For someone who has MANY credit cards, this isn't the wallet for you. I have easily twice as many cards as this compact wallet can handle. It's a nice wallet for going out for an evening without a bulky one in your pocket....and mine is very bulky. This wallet holds about 8 pieces of plastic plus the money on the outside strap, which, if you don't mind holding the money on the outside, works great...but I don't like that either....I'd rather have it inside where it is locked up. So, I bought a different wallet and will use this one when going out on the town, when I don't need ALL of my cards."
3.0,"Don't know when these were made, but the batteries on these is shot. No Peppa Pig oinks. Bad sales practices."
3.0,Need more bees on them
3.0,"The socks are cute, but there’s no way they are 95% cotton. They don’t breathe at all, and feel more like polyester."
3.0,Just got this top. The fabric doesn't seem to be as great quality as some other brands and is a bit rough to the touch. You also don't want to get it if you are short. These KOI tops seem to be made for people 5'6&#34; and above. It is true to size. The person this was for is 5'2&#34; and 115 and normally wears an extra small and this did fit. It has varying colors of blue so it can work with various colors and black.
3.0,"They're not bad.  No curvature to the frame, so there's a lot of light that gets in from the sides and causes glare.  But look good, feel sturdy enough, and they are polarized, so they're a good cheap-o pair for now."
3.0,"I like it and it looks like it does from tbe picture. It is very fitting on the top, by the neck especially. It just didn’t fit like I thought it would. I may just have to stretch it out."
3.0,"This dress was so small that I gave it to a person who is smaller that I, and it was too small for them as well, and I ordered an xtra large."
3.0,"Too tight for my 5'9&#34; 135 lbs, even though it's a Large.  Otherwise a cute dress in nice material. As others mentioned, the neck opening is small.  At first, I thought I had it on backwards!"
3.0,These are super cute and I wanted to love them.  The sizing is off tremendously.  I ordered a large and the they run at least 2 sizes small.  Sending this pair back and ordering a XXL.
3.0,This is a very puffy shirt/jacket. It’s warm but be prepared to look like the little brother from the Christmas story movie.
3.0,Looks weird..lol.<br />Never wire it.
3.0,What do you expect for 9.99? Mediocre quality made in China but they will fit on your nose.
3.0,"I am a 30DD, usually an XS bottom but ordered a medium. The bottoms are definitely extra cheeky and run small, but the top just a teensy bit too small.<br /><br />Love the way it's adjustable though, just wish the pads were removable. Probably won't keep the bottoms, but I'll alter the top myself and it'll make it worth the $15."
3.0,Cute but not floaty like the photo. Go a size up if you're looking for loose.
3.0,"Design is nice. Material is soft. Sizing is off. Description states will fit from  size 0-14, but it's more like size 0-8. Measurements does not fit size."
3.0,"for the price paid, it was a steal. been wearing it daily and it has held up very well. it however took so long to come, i nearly forgot about it. looks nice from a distance, but up close the rose gold band looks a bit cheap...far too shiny to be real. overall though, a decent deal."
3.0,It's ok. My husband didn't really care for it.
3.0,"The bag is decent quality for the price and a good size. My big complaint is that I ordered &#34;Royal Blue&#34; and the bag I got is most definitely navy blue. So either the color was described incorrectly or they sent me the wrong one. For the price, I won't bother sending it back but it is disappointing."
3.0,Ridiculous.  Would not fit in boots and cannot wear as designed
3.0,"Much more flimsy than I thought it would be, almost sent it back."
3.0,"I bought this to give as a gift. When first opening I thought the items appeared cheap. The top feels very cozy and soft! The pants look cheaper, and seam thin. The pants do not feel soft, I decided to keep them and hope that the pants soften up with a wash or two"
3.0,I wish it had American measurements and a larger size so I could do large and small bracelets.
3.0,"Very thin. I sometimes like to wear no bra with loose tank tops, definatley can't with this thin material."
3.0,This looks like a bonnet from Handmaids Tail
3.0,Cute belt but it did not fit me. I am size 14 waist. I do like the wide elastic though. Really wish it came in a bigger size.
3.0,a tad small
3.0,Magnet has already broke in two pieces
3.0,Not as sturdy as I would have like but did the job
3.0,Comfortable and you have dexterity in them but cold air gets in easily.
3.0,Do not love the material.
3.0,Watch itself is nice but the Band is almost 2 inches too large and there doesn’t seem to be any way to adjust and the latch guard was only connected on one side.
3.0,"It was pretty but had an odd odor to it, so I returned it."
3.0,"Decent, not the material I was expecting. More slick like material than expected. Only worn once so far but didn't really seem to make a difference for me /:"
3.0,"This is a nice coat, kept warm with a few layers under in average 50 deg F.<br />But the waterproof and dryness....<br />Went camping at Fish creek pond in the Adirondacks in September, it rained a little, mostly drizzle with a day of heavy rain.  I felt dry and warm, had a jumper and rain jacket under this coat.  The puffy part of the coat was very damp, the cuff collars soaked and water had seeped through into the pockets.  Water was trapped in the pockets and had made the contents in there wet.  Don't think I will be wearing this one again on drizzly rain + days again"
3.0,These organizers were ok. I felt it made my luggage heavier than it should have been but I'll give them another try. I'm still not too convinced.
3.0,los tirantes quedan medio grandes y mi busto se sale por los lados :(
3.0,Does not look as fabulous in person as some of their other designs.
3.0,"Tbh it was a little big I have to see if I can at all, get this downsized to got my wrist. But idk if it's even worth it to do that all I needed this for was for one time on Halloween now I don't even want it."
3.0,Beautiful bracelet and I really loved it until the elastic started to fray and stretch out. I have only had it two months and I’m afraid to wear it for fear of the elastic letting go.
3.0,kind of cheaply made
3.0,I used it for self-leveling concrete. My right one was missing the front strap so I had to untie my shoe and use the shoelace to keep it tight to the bottom of my shoe.
3.0,"I purchased the Capri Pale Red Violet in medium and it fits perfectly.  I'm usually a small, but I have a big bottom so medium fits well.  The color is more of a lavender color.  The material is nice and soft.  I love that it has the pockets on the side, which was the main reason I purchased it.  The only thing I don't like is the crotch area where I feel like it's always slipping down, like a drop-crotch type style.  I find myself always having to pull it up constantly because I don't like that feeling.  Unless you do, then it'll be fine.  Overall for the price, I think it was a good purchase still."
3.0,"Unfortunately the material is not soft or comfy. The brick red color is nice, but the style is not very flattering. Too expensive for its quality. I cannot use it as a pajama, it's not comfortable enough."
3.0,"Striking, I get lots of comments on it. i put it on a purse as a broach.  Sad to say, the clasp broke.  But its a fun striking piece!"
3.0,Neckline too high uncomfortable around neck area otherwise nice top
3.0,the sewing quality is not that great at the top.
3.0,"The dress is nice and as pictured.  However, I had to make a couple of alterations in order for it to fit comfortably. The lace back straps didnt &#34;hug&#34; my back too well. They were a little bulky, so i got those parts tailored. When the dress was zipped, the upper portion felt a little snug therefore I had that part tailored as well. It fits nicely now."
3.0,"Love it, super awesome bracelet. Bought myself the black & a brown for my friend.. Buuttt mine came apart after about 2wks of wearing. Now I feel sad & unprotected :/ hopefully I can figure out how to repair it."
3.0,"It Runs Huge, so big that I can't even wear it. Extremely disappointed."
3.0,strap broke after a month and a half.
3.0,"I had pretty much the identical jacket before, wore it for years until the lining fell apart. I tried another jacket or two as a replacement but came back to the same model mostly for the good fit and clean style. Only difference with this one is that the collar does not lie flat, it tends to stand up and you feel it around your neck. Fine if you're in a cold weather situation or something, but I would prefer it usually lie flat. Two stars off for that."
3.0,I love this color but it's too short 😞
3.0,"The seller was great. Rings came on time and in their package. I have been ordering these types of rings for years for different parties I throw. Unfortunately, the quality is no longer there. These rings in the past would last so long I could use them a year later! Now, I was lucky they lasted 24 hours. Some lasted way less than that. I will say they all worked though. Sometimes you have to fig-it a bit to get them to turn on."
3.0,"I did not like that the seams were not sewn down on the inside of the horizontal stripe.  Feels weird on the inside because of it.  Also, I do not consider it a sweatshirt."
3.0,"Cute sunglasses, they aren't as transparent as the bottom picture makes them seem The material is a little flimsy, but so are a pair of my Gucci sunglasses"
3.0,Smaller than expected and felt rather cheap.
3.0,My wife says the fit is prefect but the material is somewhat ichi and uncomfortable!
3.0,The laceless tightening system doesn't hold and the shoes loosen up easilly.  My son also broke one of the laces by pulling too hard after only a few wears when he was trying to constantly make the shoes tighten.
3.0,I was not aware that this is made in China…It was not disclosed! I will give it as a gift instead.
3.0,I returned it. I'm an adult male.  The bow portion of the bowtie was seemingly well made but was sized more like a tie for an older child or early high school.  It was so small that the narwhals fit into the bends of the bow.
3.0,"This product is pretty sweet. I used them for a costume in a movie I made, but they borke a few weeks into to shooting. They are of decent quality, but quite delicate.<br /><br />Arrived quickly though!"
3.0,If you just need put in the jaket's pocket will be too big size.
3.0,Stones are very dull
3.0,Alot of the lettering wasnt centered or was miss spelled
3.0,"Not 100% wool, as advertised, disappointed!!"
3.0,"Ordered a large since I'm more bottom heavy. Shorts fit like a medium and the top like an XL. The material is very soft, so for pj's they are okay."
3.0,It's okay. A cheep knock off of a spirit hoodie. Girl I know paid over 100$ for her spirit hood. It's tight for the price.
3.0,"Nice, well made hat.  I have an average size head and this hat is tight..."
3.0,Only received the clear beaded handle...no gold metal chain was included. UPDATE THE DESCRIPTION
3.0,The cups don't cover very much! Lol I look like I'm going to spill out and that's saying something since I'm a B cup.
3.0,"If you have a small wrist, it is ok...a little too small for wrapping three times."
3.0,I like this dress a lot
3.0,"My kid is 12 but complains that this is a little small.  Believe me, she doesn't have a large head.  I like the design better than others because this has a zipper so there is easy access to the electronics.  Bluetooth on inexpensive electronics will always be ""you get what you pay for"" meaning, for what it is, it works.  If you want music on your walk and want to keep warm, then don't complain.  The sound is decent, and it keeps you warm.  If you want to spend 300 dollars on the coolest bluetooth headphones and are willing to let your head freeze, then you are free to do that too. With these inexpensive bluetooth products, whether it is earphones, a headset or these beanies, keep your phone in your front pockets, know that sound will be a little tinny and be happy."
3.0,Over fit was good. My only complaint is that the zipper is touchy. I have to be very careful otherwise it will get stuck.
3.0,"This is a beautiful piece, especially for the price, however it is not durable and within three hours the chain snapped twice. It wasn't used roughly but was instead only being worn when the chain snapped each time. It was very sad because it was a Christmas gift for my son."
3.0,Beanie is cute but larger than pictured
3.0,"This is a very pretty shirt, but I really didn’t like the chest part. It’s fairly hard and not as comfortable as I would have liked. If you don’t have a large chest I wouldn’t recommend."
3.0,Skipped a few stitches. Took a long time to receive
3.0,I ordered a pair of black ones. They are great. I ordered the khaki pants and they are tighter and different pocket configuration. Will probably not order again.
3.0,The small was way too big for me. I am 5‘4“ and 117lbs. If it would’ve fit I would’ve loved it the material was beautiful.
3.0,thin see threw.. Way to small.. pretty print though .. need to layer
3.0,It was a different type of T-shirt than i expected. Also did not fit as well as i would have hoped.
3.0,Poor quality. Fell apart within 3 weeks. Fit small.
3.0,Good too texture but the torso was too small so it fell short to  just my hip area - not for me.
3.0,I listened to the reviews and got a size down or my boy would have been swimming in it. Cool outfit though
3.0,It does look like the picture but it's a little see threw.I wouldn't get it for teenagers
3.0,"Did fit as describe by some, I wear a 36 to 38 more towards the 38 lately. Fit was good not tight and not lose in the waist. The waist band is a little thicker than others I have, more like a swim short or something. Its not uncomfortable but does leave mark from wearing them due to the thickness.<br />The rest of the boxer material is thin and light material. Air flow no problem there. Won't keep you warm. They seemed a bit big in the legs when I first got them, kind of puffing out. Wash them and that has gotten better, I like a fit that follows the body but not tight and not so lose it bunches up in your pants when putting them on. They"
3.0,Attractive. Good value.
3.0,Was comfortable but not long lasting
3.0,good quality. they look big on my face though
3.0,"My necklace set was teal, not at all purple. It's pretty but it is not what I wanted."
3.0,"very pretty stone, however didn't come on a chain but rather a nylon string. a luittle disappointing as I now need to buy a decent chain for it to go on."
3.0,"The dress was gorgeous if it all in the right spots, except for the sleeves of the dress and the shoulder area of the dress, which causes you to have to continuously turn the force it up on my shoulders Throughout the night"
3.0,Its ok. Too big for a mens wallet
3.0,"This is a solidly made and well finished product that is really exceeding my expectations.  The case provides excellent protection with an acceptably low profile.  I've appreciated the follow-up from the seller to be sure I am completely satisfied.  I will be buying more of these when some of my other glasses cases need replacement.<br /><br />9-Month Update:<br /><br />The hinge spring that holds these cases open or closed lasts about 6-9 months in daily use.  They seem to break partially and then completely, so first there is a less tight closure and then the case swings open freely and would need to be held closed with a rubber band or discarded."
3.0,"At first, I really liked this cardigan. Nice material. I got it to leave at my desk and throw it on when it was chilly. Unfortunately, after a few wears, the seam at the collar separated from the body of the sweater. Good for a few wears, but not durable for regular use."
3.0,Pajamas are much heavier than I expected.  Not appropriate for summer wear.
3.0,"Cool Halloween Mask! My 11yo son loves it! Only problem, the mask has 3 snaps to secure support around head - one snap arrived broken. Worst part - apparently this item is ‘not eligible for return.’"
3.0,Doesnt have a 40 hr power reserve.
3.0,"Quality seemed decent, but size runs small. It didn't fit. Had to return."
3.0,"Cute dress, but I didn’t like the material. It was itchy and I felt like it was too thin. It also ran a bit small, I wear a medium and I had to return it because I felt like if I bent over the dress would rip."
3.0,"had a lot of fun with these, but there were several that didn't work straight out of the pack and they are really cheap plastic junk. Most of them broke within the first day or two of using them. The little finger straps pop off and a whim, the plastic switches break or they just don't light up at all. So, expect to be able to use a little more than half of the package you receive. Not a bad deal since the price was so low, just don;t expect full value."
3.0,"I'm a size 4/Small in US sizing which is 34 in Europe. Based on the reviews I ordered a 40 and I can't even button or zip it, they run very small. Otherwise they are gorgeous!"
3.0,Very odd cut… I got rid of it.
3.0,This bag looks great. I've had compliments. But for nearly $100 it's not built very well at all. I was hoping it'd be more robust. The zippers feel like toy zippers compared to those on the OGIO bags.<br />EVEN WORSE: the shoulder straps don't maintain their length. The little plastic hoopy parts don't hold the length. So many times I've swung this bag on notice it's very lobsided and i have to fix it.
3.0,"Was happy when it arrived but, for a 2X it is a bit snug already.  Have not washed it yet, since I cannot wear it so not sure if it will shrink or not.  Tried to stretch it a bit but, I could hear tiny threads snapping.  Not good.  Really thin material"
3.0,"The earring has no problem just its smaller than tha picture is showing, very small."
3.0,"Happy with the style and color, true to the picture. The cuffs and bottom of the jacket don't seem to be the right size for the jacket."
3.0,"Great product... kind of. I ordered my usual size and it fit beautifully, but getting it on and off is IMPOSSIBLE! The dress has no stretch and no zipper, only a tiny little button hole that when undone doesn't really give any slack. I ended up having to cut the back just to be able to get it off (I'm going to sew the cut parts so it looks like there was supposed to be a slit there, but for someone who can't sew, this would probably ruin the dress for them). All in all, it's absolutely gorgeous, fits perfectly, and is well-made, EXCEPT FOR THE LACK OF A ZIPPER, which makes it virtually impossible to put on and entirely impossible to take off. Keep that in mind when considering buying!"
3.0,"Cheapish material. Overall tho, with the design. I can't complain. Looks great. Ran a lil big. A did get a xxl. Overall I'm happy with it"
3.0,Nice enough dress but sizing runs a little small.
3.0,The pasties are great! The other 2 aren't very good.
3.0,My wife liked it but was a big big.
3.0,"Being a fan of “Charmed” and loving Celtic knots – a “Celtic” trinity inside a heart is PERFECT!<br /><br />Right off, I knew I was going to replace the chain with a sturdier one – a longer snake chain with lobster claw clasp.<br /><br />When this arrived, the chain didn’t disappoint me – I knew it wasn’t too study.<br /><br />The charm? That was a bit disappointing. It was small – okay, I can get over that. But, it too was a bit … thin. It definitely isn’t “sturdy”. To give you an idea, it is BARELY thicker than the original chain it came with, and certainly not as thick as the chain I put it on.<br /><br />For $22, I expect a bit better quality. This is more or less a $15 piece.<br /><br />Not too giftable either – comes in a jewelry pouch in a plastic bag."
3.0,Sleeves shrink
3.0,"These safety goggles do perform as advertised.  They haven't fogged up and they do protect my glasses and my eyes from chemical splashes and from any little chips or small pieces of metal that I see when grinding and using chemicals for cleaning purposes.  The only thing that is bothersome is that they tend to creak and pop and snap when I am putting them on.  Normally this is a symptom of a short life, but these seem to be holding up OK."
3.0,"This is very thin, not a sweatshirt, more like a thick long sleeved tee shirt."
3.0,the stubs on the back were super short and would slip
3.0,It was a little bit loose for me but I probably got a size too big but I didn't like how it wasn't solid and is hollow on the inside of the skull.
3.0,Material is very stretchy almost like womens jeans. Zipper and waist button are very cheap. I expect they will break quickly.
3.0,Nice band but impossible to remove links on ur own. Had to pay $20 to have it sized.
3.0,I suggest if you’re a medium or a small
3.0,Really enjoying this watch.
3.0,It is a very cute and comfy shirt BUT the sizing is off. I ordered a large and it fits more like a medium.
3.0,"Not a fan of the darker color of the frames that we received. The lighter turquoise in the picture is prettier, bummer."
3.0,After two all day wears a head fell off. If not for that I'd give 5 stars
3.0,Authenticity seems legit. But other places have it half the price.<br /><br />Edit: it looks like they finally have the price close to the original. I raised it by two stars.
3.0,"Love the jewerly. It's gorgeous, but the backs on the earrings dont hold well enough. Lost an earring before I even started my bday party at a lounge. Should switch the type of backs u use."
3.0,The patterns are cute and the material is very soft but I have a hard time keeping these from sliding. Maybe my head is too big?
3.0,It's ok. Doesn't look very sturdy.
3.0,"these are great if you wear a lot of post earrings, if not it may not be a good value for you."
3.0,Just didn't love the style.
3.0,Product looks cheap and feels cheap. Which I suppose is expected because it is pretty cheap. If your trying to get a nice piece for a low price then I suggest looking somewhere else. If your ok with something that doesn’t look all that great then buy it.
3.0,"I tried to win with my Mother who thinks she’s Beth Dutton. She loves this dang coat but the pockets are fake! Good lord, now I have to seam rip this thing and make her some dang pockets. Thanks a lot."
3.0,Wish they had more coverage.
3.0,"Eyes are easily removal by my 19 month old, choking Hazzard."
3.0,"Wish the description had included the fact that they ship from China--took two weeks. Appear to be well made, with nice deep pockets. but the shape is odd--very long legs out of proportion to smallish waist.  I will have to hem them up at least  4 inches to be above my knee."
3.0,"Well they aren’t exactly cuffed and fit about 2-3 sizes too small. I normally wear between a 6 and 8 and bought a 12. It fits but it’s tight. I was hoping these would be baggy on me. I will keep them for the low price, not at all bad quality."
3.0,"This bag was larger than what I was looking,"
3.0,"Received quickly. Leggings are soft,but tinner than other brands I purchased before, material looks lower quality compares to other brands. Very tide at waist (waistband)  if you are not too thin in that area.I got the one with elephants and the pattern is pretty, but upside down. Will keep it,but not my favorite leggings."
3.0,"I have a size 7 US foot and these are very big for me. I love them, I just can't wear them."
3.0,"What I loved about this dress is the comfortable material, the flexibility of it, the fit, and the color. Now let's talk about those shoulder pads....terrible. I know the description says it's padded, but I figured they could be removed. They can't be removed because the sleeve of the dress is built into them. So there's no cutting them out. I will likely never wear this dress and wouldn't get it again."
3.0,It smelled like an ashtray. I didn’t realize it was a dryfit material. It’s okay. Not as cute as photo.
3.0,"Ordered in pink - what a pretty color! The ribbed fabric, high cut and belt looked too flattering. However, the seam under the bust was visible as a line/shade difference through the front of the suit and there was gaping in the fabric under the arms that didn’t lay right. Quality decent but not high - could tell the difference between this and bathing suits from established brands. Wanted to love this because the shape & concept were so cute but ultimately sent it back. If I ordered again, I’d go for a smaller size and darker color to account for the issues I experienced. Other reviews look positive so I’d say it’s worth a try!"
3.0,"I honestly assumed that it'd be glossed and neon as the photo suggested, but it's more of a metallic pastel soft sheen green. Although I dont fully hate it, it's not the color the photo suggested it to be."
3.0,"Met my expectations which were pretty low because you can't expect much from a $25 shoe. The memory foam in this shoe is so thin its not cushioning enough but once again, you can't expect much. Sizin was on point, I ordered a 4.5 in girls and it fit just fine. This shoe is less narrow than any other shoes I've seen which I loved because I hate narrow shoes... color is beautiful! I've worn them once to school and honestly they are comfortable but I kind of feel like my feet don't agree. Overall great shoe for the price."
3.0,"I absolutely love cactuses so I had to purchase this bracelet ... it was so cute! I received many many compliments on it.<br />The only downside for me was that I really tried squeezing the bracelet hoping I could adjust the diameter of it, the bracelet would not get smaller :("
3.0,"These smelled strongly/harshly of chemicals, and I tend to wash everything anyway, but they didn't look like they would hold up to much washing.<br /><br />They didn't!  I rinsed them in cold water and the water ran green.  Some of the shine came off.  I stopped and feel I reached a happy middle ground between too dull vs. not clean enough, but if I were a performer who sweated in these on stage, perhaps with lots of makeup, I wouldn't be too happy with them.  Fortunately I plan to use them a few times for halloween costumes, but this will probably limit how many times I get to use them."
3.0,Beautiful dress but ran small. I'm a size 12 and got the large and it was too small :(  They don't make a larger size.
3.0,"I had to return, looks nothing like the picture"
3.0,I feel like this outfit is cut a little wide. But I do like that it’s made of t-shirt material so it will be very comfortable to wear for an extended period of time unlike most special occasion toddler clothing.
3.0,Hat looks great but pins are flimsy.
3.0,I usually wear a large but ordered X-large. It fits like a medium
3.0,"I'm between a size 8 and 10,  so I ordered a large. It definitely is not a large for the top, fits more like a medium. The bottom is smaller than expected was well."
3.0,The earrings are cute but smaller than expected.  About the length/width of a standard business card.
3.0,Definitely a stunning statement piece!  It will instantly dress up any plain shirt.  However there were some minor jewels missing when it arrived.  I didn’t think it was a big deal and you couldn’t tell.  I unfowas only able to wear 3 times because it broke in half in the jeweled part.  When I did get to wear it I got a ton of compliments.
3.0,"I'm giving this product a lower rating to bring some attention to the company.<br /><br />The clock was GORGOUS, it worked perfect for the music festival I attended and I got so many compliments.<br /><br />However the ""free pasties"" that came with literally ATE the skin on my breasts. I have to go to a doctor the damage is that bad. I have open soars and bloody cracks, my nipple is red and swollen. It looks like a chemical burn.<br /><br />I would advise NOT TO USE THE FREE PASTIES. It's not worth it. Would have been a 5 start review if it wasn't for the terrible pasties they are giving out for free."
3.0,Top is 3 sizes to big and bottom is fine
3.0,Suelta color
3.0,"Loved this in the pic, and prob if you’re a M or smaller, but for L and XL super wide and the horizontal stripes did me zero favors"
3.0,"It is a cute sweater but it is baggy and doesn't have a good shape to it. However, if you are looking for a casual light sweater for this fall to wear over jeans, this would be it. I have to wear a tank top underneath it as it is sheer.<br /><br />It is loose but makes your belly appears bigger than it is. It is comfortable and that's what I look for in a sweater."
3.0,I read the reviews my daughter usually wears a small and I bought the large.  A medium would have been fine.
3.0,Shorts fit well. Shirt was narrow and snug compared to shorts-like two different sizes out together.
3.0,Cheap looking belt in an fancy box
3.0,Lights worked for about a day or so.  They are really hard inside...not enough cushion.  My daughter would not keep them on.
3.0,The face scarf is usable but I feel the diameter of the neck scarf is to small for the average size neck of an adult to wear for long periods of time.
3.0,I was kind of hoping the material would be a little bit thicker but other than that I like it
3.0,"It's at least a whole size too small. I have to wear a tunic top that's long enough to cover the hip area bc it's too thin. I'm 5'7"" and the length is perfect!"
3.0,I like this shield.  But wearing it for a long time gets to be uncomfortable.
3.0,These were so much smaller than I expected. The colors are still nice but I was looking for a larger earring.
3.0,Very pretty. Product came broken. I was able to fix the links as I needed it for a wedding.
3.0,"Fit my head around, but was too long over my ears."
3.0,Good price seems fairly well made. Survives laundry. Biggest complaint is it rolls up on the sides. I've tried various sizes yet still rolls along side so not very comfortable.
3.0,Inscription too small  hard to read
3.0,"very pretty, but tight for size 8 women.<br />fabric will withstand one to two wears."
3.0,can only be effectively used when it isn't extremely windy outside. I've only used it about 2 to 3 times but yesterday It almost broke when I used it as it was extremely windy! aside that I guess it's an okay umbrella.
3.0,Gave it away...nowhere near correct size. Unhappy customer.
3.0,"Couple bands came broke, rest were fine, decent product"
3.0,Very nice and good quality but the butterfly is large and i was buying it for my great granddaughter.
3.0,The size chart is not accurate. Size up
3.0,"This item is inferior to similar items on the site (Igloo gloves).  You are much better paying the extra few bucks, they are warmer, softer, and a better fit."
3.0,"I wanted to love these, but I can’t. The quality is poor. We’ve had them a month or so now. One pair has a hole near the fly hole, I thought it was just a case of a missed seam. Still wanted to love them. Another pair has a seam that has now completely came un-sewed. We won’t be purchasing again! If we hadn’t worn them I would be returning them! Don’t waste your money! Stick with Hanes - they’ve been much better quality in my experience."
3.0,I didn't realize it would be so masculine - looking.  Its bigger than I expected and I am looking for a replacement band that might be a bit more feminine.  It reminds me of a watch my father had!
3.0,So cute but wayyyy too small. I am 4’11” and about 115 lbs and it was too short and tiny. A large would have been the right choice but I had to return. It’s a bummer because the dress is beautiful.
3.0,I'm pretty satisfied how old is the snowsuit to be in the first place so I believe it would fit properly once the baby comes of age
3.0,"I really liked this earring,however when i tried it on it was just slightly too tight to wrap around the top of my ear.I managed to make it fit,but it was too painful to wear.I thought that I could slightly widen the curve of the tail area and attempted to do so with pliers.The tail snapped off.I think i have pretty average sized ears,so unless your ears are smaller than average,this earring may not fit."
3.0,Wore them only twice and they ripped still te crotch. Wasn’t doing anything out of the ordinary. Was rather embarrassing. They were 15 bucks though
3.0,"This is nice for a breezy look with jeans, or a fancier look with a blazer. I was looking to layer this piece that way. It is fairly sheer, watch what you wear underneath."
3.0,"Overall, it’s really cute for the price. Material is VERY thin, but I had on leggings underneath so it wasn’t a big deal. Due to the super thin material, the side pockets show up and look a bit odd in my opinion, but I still wore it and received compliments."
3.0,The bottom fits perfectly however the top  is a bit small I wear a small but I'm D cup in the chest area wish I was able to choose the size of the top
3.0,"Trying to find snow pants has not been easy and unfortunately, I have to keep looking. I’m a hourglass with an emphasis on the hips. I ordered larger and it fit great on the hips but the waist was huge, even with the adjusters. I was also hoping that the length would work but being a hair over 6’, it’s a no-go. They look high waist in the picture but they’re definitely mid."
3.0,"The lanyard itself seems to be good quality.  Have been using it for a while now with no issues.  Only complaint is that the images that run up and down the lanyard material are not centered on the material.  Some of the symbols are partially off the material.  When you purchase a lanyard specifically for the logos on it, it's kind of disappointing when that's the issue."
3.0,"They look great. However, they are difficult to put on and take off, the clips leave marks on my new glasses lenses, and I have to be careful that they're on straight. They aren't very sturdy, but it's all I could afford after buying new glasses. Maybe a little overpriced, should be Polarized. Otherwise, they look good."
3.0,Not cotton and they run small to me.
3.0,"These are very pretty, and can be considered dainty, but the posts are way too long for me to be able to comfortably wear them."
3.0,"I purchased this muscle tank thinking it would help me look like the guy in the picture.  I put it on and wore it around for 5 days straight without taking it off and guess what, I still don't have muscles.  I was going to return them but they are so comfortable I can't stop wearing them.  I like to wear them with jeans tucked in when hanging out with my lady friends or while I'm just relaxing on the couch binge watching Star Wars.  So if you looking to get ripped I would pass but if you want a great all around muscle tank, give it a shot..."
3.0,"This is a solid choice for a casual summer dress though it does have its drawbacks. The fabric dying seems odd, as when the fabric is stretched it becomes white and a bit transparent. Given how large this dress runs, however, for most that shouldn't be too much of an issue.  It certainly speaks to quality nonetheless.  As with most maxi dresses, it is at least comfortable.  As previously noted, the blue is a deep shade but with a purple base more than a true navy. At ~200lbs and just under 5'9"" I purchased a medium and it fit perfectly.  Granted, I am a dramatic example of a pear. The only fitted portion is the top, and that's definitely where I am the smallest.  Even so, the medium is an 8-10 US according to the size chart. In no universe am I a size 8-10, pear or not.  Take that into consideration when choosing. I often buy multiples of something I like in different colors.  I do enjoy this dress, but not enough to purchase it again or otherwise recommend it."
3.0,"Biggest plus is that I can keep it rolled up in my car, so I always have it.<br /><br />Buttons are hard to fasten, especially top hood."
3.0,I had to return it since it was small and a little too short for me
3.0,xmas a gift
3.0,The wand was pretty bad Quality but the glasses where good.
3.0,"Nice summer glasses, quite large though."
3.0,decent watch but light is weak/ hard to read is dark
3.0,"First of all, it’s obvious from the photos that the lining is cotton plaid flannel, let’s not call it Sherpa.<br />I really wanted to wear the cuffs turned up so you can see the corduroy, but the sleeves were just a tad short on me without turning them up, so that’s a no go. The real deal breaker was that the sleeves are lined with the same flannel as the jacket, so it’s difficult to get your arm in if you’re wearing a sleeve at all because it gets stuck on the flannel lining. So as much as I wanted to like this jacket, I sent it back. Cute in the photos, but it would be frustrating to me to wear it."
3.0,"Tracking didn't update. Showed my package arriving at same facility several times. Took 3 weeks to receive package. I was worried I wasn't going to get the masks. But the kid size fits my 9 year old perfectly, just slightly big on my 6 year old but the adjustable ear loops help. The exhale valve doesn't work as well as a more expensive mask."
3.0,Very cute and great for dressy events. The strings that the beads are on are a little thin so I worry if you stretch it too many times they’ll pop.
3.0,"Not crazy about this robe, for the price could probably get better quality."
3.0,I ordered a small and it slides up and down my arm. A small should of fit perfectly but it does not. Make sure to go a size down.
3.0,"I love this bra, I bought this one and the gray one. They fit comfortably n are super sexy, but this one is already falling apart and I've only worn it a handful of times and washed it 3 times (in a delicates bag, did not put in the dryer). The gray one has been washed the same way the same amount of times and so far it's still holding up. But this one is my favorite because I adore the color, but I'm so disappointed that it's already falling apart."
3.0,received with a weak battery
3.0,Fashion glasses and really help on a long day behind the computer
3.0,I read the comments and they said this blouse was too tight so I bought a size larger but it is huge. I definelty have to tailor it cutting almost 30% of it. The quality is good and it is true to the color in the picture.
3.0,"I got my watch real quick, I believe it was 3 days. The packaging was done well an everything looked fine. I wound it manually first and set the date to the 31th of the month. Everything was fine until I woke up the 32nd of the month,( the next morning) I did a double take an it did say 32 so I figured trouble was coming. Also I noticed the watch had stopped some time during the morning of the 32nd. After looking at the instructions I figured out, they had forgot to include the watch they sold me in them. After fooling around with it I figured out that pushing a button on the watch the 3 would rotate if the stem was pulled half way out. I finally got the date set, wound the watch again manually and put it on. About 3:00pm it had stopped again. To make a long story short it stopped 4 times, I then wound it about 50 turns and put it back on. After that it's worked real well. As for keeping time, I don't think it's lost a second in the short time I'd had it. The date seems to be working alright, but I don't think it will Change at the end of the month. It will probably go to 32nd again. As for the selfwinding feature, it does not work, I wind the watch 30 times a day to keep it running. The self winding mechanism seems to be working but it just doesn't wind the watch, and I use my hands all day long doing woodwork. The watch looks very good and I guess as long as I wind it and don't care about the date or instructions it will run. I would send it back but I just don't feel like fooling with it. I gave it three stars because I got it and it's keeping time. As for would I buy another one definitely not."
3.0,"Just got this, the design and print is incredible, it looks fantastic but it it was too small. I bought a 3xl because I am a big guy, the item I received looked like a medium but it had a 3xl tag on it. Will be returning."
3.0,"I was expecting bigger earrings. I think it was my mistake since I am not good in measurements. Nevertheless they are beautiful, but way too small for my expectations."
3.0,"I snagged this in an Amazon lightning deal. It is great and fit as expected and the colors are lovely. The stitching is OK. These pants are better than many pants I ordered on Amazon.<br /><br />So why the 3 stars? My only concern with this is that I developed a rash shortly after wearing it. I was told by my doctor that it could have been sun poisoning caused by trapping heat in my body. In doing yoga, or hot yoga it is perhaps to get something that could breathe so these are for sure for any other activity other than Yoga. I also should note that I wore them to run an errand for 40 minutes so I am slightly aversive to wearing them for an activity. I will use them indoors or for the winter but I am not going to use them for Yoga."
3.0,I love the shirt but gave it 3 stars due to the color. It is NOT RED. More like burgundy
3.0,"These tape strips do secure a mask firmly to my face, but I wasn’t a fan. I found the adhesive irritating, and I had to use several at a time since I’d just have air leaks intensive in areas not covered by the strips if I didn't seal off the whole side and top. I am happier with the results I got with a neoprene mask brace I made myself, but I can also get good results with ordinary medical tape. Medical tape doesn’t stick well when removed and reapplied, and the Cabeau strips do, but a roll of medical tape is also much cheaper so it isn’t a big deal to just use a fresh piece."
3.0,No inside pockets!  I guess I didn't check the photos carefully.  It's worth keeping just because it looks good.  But it doesn't function well for everyday use.
3.0,it’s an absolutely gorgeous dress unfortunately they sent me the wrong color and it just doesn’t fit my chest area I will be returning it.
3.0,"The dress is nice and it looks even better when you put it on. The reason giving 3 stars is : after trying on the dress I decided to wash it , the dress faded a little but didn’t care , I got my dress ready after ironing and to my surprise when I put it in the zipper won’t come up, my husband try helping and nothing so I take it out and try to zip and that is when the zipper broke.. I’m so frustrated and disappointed, and I can’t return it..So my advise , try the zipper a couple of times before cutting the tags cause it may not go up"
3.0,These are really small. I got mine to bend so they fit a little.
3.0,"I love the size and the style od this earings.  The price was fantastic.  i would have given 5 star but I had a problem with the size of the insertion of the earing ,it is to wide for my ear hole and irritate my earing hole."
3.0,I wear a size 12 and typically a large fits well but this is very snug. I love the color and design of the skort but was disappointed in the fit. The supplier was very reliable and prompt with delivery
3.0,I love the shirt but size is not accurate.
3.0,It’s was MUCH shorter than expected... would have liked to see it on a model first... quality is nice though
3.0,"This is not going to be a warm hoodie at all. I wish amazon had a thickness graph for clothing or atleast a subjective ""warmth"" rating."
3.0,Cute onesie but the bows on the tutu and the headband are very loose. Expect to see them on so they will stay.
3.0,"I REALLY like the way they look but 2 have already broken,"
3.0,"The shoe is great and exactly what I wanted, but the stitching on the top started to be pulled out in the second week and there's no reason that should have happened. I don't remember catching the top of the shoe on anything."
3.0,"I bought this dress for a friend's wedding.  It's relatively comfortable, but the fit will need to be adjusted.  It's made for someone a bit more curvy than myself.  Great if you can fill out the dress, very noticeable when you can't."
3.0,Fit is a little weird & runs small.
3.0,The lenses fit loosely in the frame and makes a rattling sound.
3.0,Slightly right around thighs and stripes do not match up which is annoying but overall was great for picture day.  I haven’t warm it again though
3.0,The clip broke after wearing it for three day. The lense is great but the attachment is all plastic. Not very easy to take off my seeing eyeglasses.
3.0,I didn't see any dramatic difference from other jewelry cleaners.
3.0,"I kept the top and gave a the bottoms away, ran small!"
3.0,"Shirt is pretty but fits like its 3 sizes less than the actual size. I usually fit a L/XL and had to get a 3XL and it fits right. I got it sized that way due to the reviews I read. Also, the material is very thin so you HAVE to wear an under tank shirt."
3.0,"I ordered extra small for my slim 12-yr-old and it is way to small.  The waist measures 21"", not 24"" like it says on the size chart.  It might stretch to 22"".  We are sending it back and will try a small and medium hoping one of those will fit."
3.0,Hat is of fair quality - typical of low cost clothing from overseas.  What was disappointing is the Logo is not a sewn patch but an IRON ON TRANSFER.  Please keep this in mind if you are considering ordering.
3.0,Tiny and a very fragile chain. Hard to make out the dog. Good as a child gift.
3.0,These are very small which is deceiving by the picture.  I wanted to return them but they are not eligible for return.  Waste of money on my part since they are to small and you cannot get them on.  They do seem well made.
3.0,"I usually wear a US 14/16 and even the 2xl was way too small. It fit snug, it was a cute dress and came with a belt. I would like to return it,  but i purchased it for only $12 and got a great deal on it. So i may just give it to someone it will fit."
3.0,The garment is much bigger than needed for a 13 year old Indian girl. The fabric also is not as good as it seems in the photo but I guess we get what we pay for. 30$ is perhaps the right price for it considering the quality
3.0,I ordered 2xl did not fit me
3.0,It is very light and has no anti-slip effect. There is too much difference in size and description.
3.0,"Nice looking, the only thing is the length, my inseam is 28. The size xl was  length 31, I had to alter 3 inches. When ordering they don't have the inseam stated. But the alterations turned out ok. Didn't want to alter new pants."
3.0,"Not the best quality. Dress part ripped a little in the chest area when putting it on but will work for what I need it too.  Great accessories- mask , cape included ."
3.0,A bit stiff
3.0,"didnt like it, also the hooks are cheap quality they feel like"
3.0,"Batteries do not last in this particular watch.<br />I do still like this watch. Seeing jeweler to look at, will try to update later. ""Capt.Khaos"""
3.0,I would have liked the edges to have been more finished. But it will do the job.
3.0,"Easy to use, very adjustable just don't like the big piece of metal where the adjustment is, could be slimmer"
3.0,"I thought the photo they used looked really nice and classy, and I had another belt from them that I liked, so I got it. I have to say it looks much tackier in person than in the photo. It feels pretty cheap too."
3.0,Necklace pendant is nice but the leather chain feel apart.  You can away use the butterfly on other chains.
3.0,It's really pretty.<br />But it broke within like 2 weeks
3.0,fit fine runs short-- real short after washing
3.0,Not the perfect fit. Leaves gaps at the sides.
3.0,"I love this blouse, the only problem is that the sleeves are super narrow for the size I ordered."
3.0,I am 5'7&#34; / 125 lbs and typically wear a Medium. I ordered the XL and it fit perfectly. I decided not to keep this because there are ruffles on the shoulder that are barely visible in the photo. It was a little to frilly for my style.
3.0,"Haven't decided to keep it, not as good looking as the picture, really dark lines, much darker than advertised.  Makes it look like an antique ring and not such a SW ring."
3.0,It's cute as a shirt..I ordered up a size as recommended still way too small.. not long as in photo..barely covers my daughter's hips..will probably return since I bought it to be a dress for a fall wedding..
3.0,"It's really cute but if you zip it, it's no longer a triangle.  You can &#34;hack&#34; it to close into a triangle without zipping."
3.0,"I love this. It is a little tricky to wear. My booty pops out a little bit because the shorts ride up and the waist band is sewn weird, but I still wear it. I am lucky that most outfits look great on me: I am 5'5, 125 pounds, hourglass shape. I do have 34C/D chest, so if I was not careful one of my boobies would actually slip out. Since I did not have a bra to wear with this, I wore those tape on breast lifter stickers in a nude color which helped me out. So you might have to play around with it, but it is worth buying. I would suggest going up in a size since the top was pretty small. Also, I wore the top and shorts separately (with jeans and an off the shoulder top)."
3.0,"These had a chemical smell that I immediately had a reaction to. I tried to air one our for an hour, but it was just too overwhelming for me. I might be more sensitive than others. It's a great deal, and they are comfortable."
3.0,It was a little larger than expected and the color was not as dark as in the photo.
3.0,"Very thin, kind of scratchy material. It was a cheap bathing suit so I guess it's ok, but I don't think I'd buy it again."
3.0,"It is a very rough material. Not sure how I feel about it yet. It's okay, fit well very flattering. I didn't notice the poofed shoulder sleeves when I bought it. Unsure whether or not I am going to keep it."
3.0,Yo what's up
3.0,"Compression is not as great as my other 20-30 stockings.  As a small woman, I bought the smallest size offered.  The are long.product is ok"
3.0,"Poor quality, likely won't wear it. Just received and will likely return."
3.0,I did not like the way it tied in the back. It could not stay down and flat to the body like I had hoped. Cute top though. Needs a certain length of pants to make it fit right.
3.0,good for the price. the seam on top is starting to unravel a bit and it hasn't been taken anywhere. just sits on my desk for photos. not the best quality but looks good and doesn't show dust like the velvet ones do.
3.0,No lining - lots of loose threads -
3.0,"I ordered this scarf in Black and Tan. The Black one was as expected, albeit quite large. I’ll admit I didn’t look at the dimensions before ordering so that was my mistake. I happen to be using them as hijabs so if you are too, bear in mind it’s better suited for classic hijab styles than turbans. The Tan one was okay but the color/material combo looked a bit too much like a linen tablecloth so unfortunately I will be returning that one.<br />Props to the seller on the packaging, the linen drawstring bags they came in were a nice touch!"
3.0,My ears are on the smaller side so these ear covers didn’t fit securely. I used them in shower and they fell off Twice as I was washing my hair. I will try it one more time and see if I can get them to stay on. Maybe i can shrink them somewhat.
3.0,"The waist band isn’t as wide as most high waisted workout bottoms I own, which is 30+, and it seems a bit large, I wear size 4 in pants, but always a medium in gym wear. Seem a bit too large in the waist, might fit better after a wash, currently not impressed. Good pockets"
3.0,"My son loves this shirt and was very excited to wear it the first time.  Buyer beware!  It shrinks A LOT!!  He is a slim, shorter 15 year old boy and the size Adult Small shrunk so much it is like a boys size Large.  So disappointed that for a $20 shirt he won't be able to wear it for long."
3.0,These were larger than they appered ..too large for my face. They do fit my husband well so he will try them. The bifocal seems large enough to be useful but not too large as to abstuct view while driving.
3.0,"You get a lot of pieces with this purchase. Look like they will last, but dull in metal color (I got the silver posts)"
3.0,"The dress is nice, neatly stitched,  however the size is off. Order up a size."
3.0,"This is a fun-looking pair of earrings strictly for casual wear because the ""enameled"" part looks a little too cheaply done to wear with anything dressy. These earrings are very large, which is part of the fun of them, and they do make a statement and definitely arouse comments from people.<br /><br />Mainly, you should be aware that the posts on these earrings are thicker than usual. I have had to remove the earrings after only a little while because they become very uncomfortable due to the thickness of the posts combined with the slightly heavier-than-normal weight of the earrings  These would be a much better choice for me if they were lighter-weight and more delicate in general and/or had thinner posts."
3.0,"This tigers eye necklace  is dainty, feminine and beautiful. It’s just unfortunate that the fake metal really itches my neck. 😩"
3.0,"Nice enough shirt, just a bit too revealing for me. But good quality."
3.0,The quality is good. They stay on well. I find them difficult to put on. The band is really long and I have a hard time tucking the excess into the band. The color is great. No other complaints than being hard to put on.
3.0,"I really liked the anklet, but after about 3 days it broke.  It's pretty but the clasp needs to be more secure."
3.0,Bottoms are true to size but top is extremely small.  Def made for someone with no chest at all.
3.0,"They'll work for now for my VERY small 9 year old who normally wears a size 7.  She'll out grow quickly, however because the length just barely fits now.  No way these can be worm by a child older than about 10 years old and still be considered pants."
3.0,Incorrect size ran small
3.0,"Colors not as in photo. If u want to color code your keys, forget it."
3.0,"These are a good quality and fairly long but the size was a little too small.  Fortunately they have free returns so I will send them back and get the next size up.  A little pricey, but pretty much all I can find at this time of year in navy."
3.0,"Got what I paid for - I didn't expect much for a 17 dollar watch. Sure enough, the thing comes in, the adjuster broke, it was almost impossible to fit those pins in, and the watch feels very very very cheap. It also doesn't tell time super accurately. The page says stainless steel but it feels more like ceramic (it's not, it's just not dense, feels hollow)<br />On the other hand, it looks nice which is all that matters to me.<br /><br />All in all, if you want to spend $17 on a watch that looks nice but you should never wear while working out, go for it."
3.0,It fit well everywhere else except in the boobs. The cut is very low and if you don't watch yourself you will expose a nip if your not careful.
3.0,"For reference, I'm 5'1&#34; 112lb 34B - I tried on the black previously in XS and it was borderline too tight and returned it since a replacement wasn't going to arrive in time for a wedding I was attending as a guest.  I ordered the S in pink and it was too big and came with a small red stains at the chest (hopefully not blood).  The black dress was really cute despite the excessive cleavage.  The pink is dull in color and reminds me of a grandma's lace.  It's not vibrant or a happy color - just skip the pink for this dress!  Also, sorry for the poor lighting, my phone was having issues with taking photos."
3.0,Very nice looking just on the smaller end of medium!
3.0,"These are workout headbands, not something I am going to wear outside when I visit Wisconsin<br />in December. These are fine, good price but not my favorite head bands."
3.0,They look great but stones came off after 1 wear…
3.0,Very light-colored denim. Fit is true to size but had I seen the color on a rack I would not have purchased it.
3.0,It was okay but it was 12 bucks so I cant complain.
3.0,Super cute and love the reflective. Scratched very easily.
3.0,Dress is nice but the fabric is too thick and it’s sequins on velvet which is no where in the description as far as I can tell. Very disappointing.
3.0,"Has pretty good built quality from what I can tell though I haven't had the opportunity to use it in the rain just yet. My biggest pet peeve with this umbrella at the moment however is that the handle doesn't fit around my wrist or forearm as advertised. I don't know even know how one would get their hand in their without dislocating fingers or something. Other than that, it's not too bad, but having one of its main perks/functions be a lie really hurts its value."
3.0,Wayyy too small. I’m normally a medium and I ordered a large just to be safe. The large looks like a size small! I couldn’t believe how small these leggings run. Order a size up or two just to be safe.
3.0,"Bought a size small, I'm 5'6, 114lbs. Fits appropriately everywhere EXCEPT for the shoulder area. The elastic circumference is too large/loose. When I try to wear it off the shoulders, it simply just falls down to my waist. I contacted the seller, thinking that maybe I had received a defective item?, but after I gave them the dimensions, they said that the dimensions were correct. I'll keep this because it can be worn on the shoulders - not as flirty but still cute enough."
3.0,"WRINKLY, like tissue paper.  Thinner fabric, so crisp feeling, almost like starched tissue paper.  I wish the fabric was different, even with some poly because I could not keep it with the terrible wrinkliness.  The design and style of this Stetson shirt, with great detail work and snaps up of the cuff was exceptional.  I liked the color too.  But returned because of the fabric."
3.0,"not the right size for my glasses, but ...."
3.0,Pretty piece..
3.0,Way smaller than an XXL. Cute but not even close to a normal XXL.
3.0,"I've purchased Indian MC shirts before. The quality is great. This particular shirt was a bit disappointing because the logo is very faint. At least for my shirt, the black logo was faint as if it was washed out. The picture is much more visible. Other than that, the 2x size runs a bit small. Not much but a bit. Thank you."
3.0,"the quality of the leather isn't great...i doubt its even real leather. its a pretty tough material but it does the job.<br /><br />******Update December 18th 2012*****<br />So its been almost a year since ive been using this belt and although i was dissapointed by the fake leather, it is very durable! its still holding up just fine and i still use it on a daily basis.<br />however i will keep it at a 3 star rating because of the false claim about the leather."
3.0,"Mala calidad, se me rompieron al tercer día"
3.0,Its a bit loose. May work better with a sweater under it.
3.0,"This comes in TWO SEPARATE PIECES//1 You have to put on the hat and shield separately, manage them separately...so what is the point? no long convenient!"
3.0,"The size is good for a small tote. If it had material in the middle to make two separate sides it would be easier ti find things quickly. That's my only complaint about this item. Otherwise it is gorgeous , easy to carry and very well constructed."
3.0,"I love all things pirate, so obviously I bought this lol. Now the buckle itself looks awesome! The paint job is sweet and the detail is awesome!!<br />But keep in mind this isn't a &#34;real&#34; belt buckle. I'd how long it will last me but until then it's deffinatley sweet.<br />The belt itself is some super cheap pleather but hakunamatata. All in all it looks tight and it'll keep your pants up. 3 stars all day. Worth the price nit the wait lol"
3.0,"The stones catch the light nicely, but they refract rainbows, making it really obvious they're fake. It looks passable from a distance in dim conditions. Within five feet, it looks cheesy. The clasp is faulty. Mine fell off the first time I wore it, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Overall, it's pretty enough if you're not concerned about fooling anyone."
3.0,I like the style but the size is a bit small
3.0,This band is made well and is cute.  I do wish it was about an a half inch or inch longer.
3.0,Too small. my iPhone 13 pro max doesn’t fit here. Too late to return. False advertisement
3.0,"I really do love Reef's stuff, but my lesson learned here is that footwear should not be ordered online. I was stoked to receive them but could tell before I even tried them on that they were going to be too narrow (by a lot) and too short (by a little) for my size-11 feet. I wore them for a couple hours anyway, and developed painful blisters. I gave them a second chance but it was no better. I have since passed them along to my 10-year-old son (who wears 8.5) and they fit him much better."
3.0,"The bracelet looks nice, but runs small."
3.0,"Fits well and comfortable. However I selected black and teal, but i got sent there black and gray. Otherwise it would've been 5 stars."
3.0,"This dress is cool. I like it, although its a little to big. I got the extra large in floral Burgundy and have purchased a large in the floral black. The large fits perfectly 👌."
3.0,"Runs a bit small, but is comfy nonetheless."
3.0,"they dont fit the size stated. Avidlove usually does a great job with sizes, these are about 1.5 sizes too small though.<br />So, order at least 1 size larger."
3.0,it could have been longer
3.0,I like the light weight and it is comfortable  but it just doesn't stay up.
3.0,"I don’t even know where it is, my wife lost it months ago. Covid you know 🤷🏾‍♂️🌬👍"
3.0,Nice be runs way small.
3.0,This is a decent tie. the only reason I had bought it was because it cam pre-tied and i wanted something that would match one of the school colors
3.0,"Band wore out pretty fast. Had to replace battery fairly soon, too. But a great value, for sure. I've gotten several compliments on this ""Cheap"" watch."
3.0,way bigger than anticipated.  returned.
3.0,Definitely not what I expected. It is the correct size and MacBook Pro slides inside it. It’s a little tight and hard to get out. But I think that will improve over time.<br />Not worth the amount spent. But it’s not bad quality. It will keep your MacBook from getting scratched up but nothing more.
3.0,"I purchased the burgundy in small.  I like the way it fits - a little longer which is good if you have a long torso.  What I don't like is that the edging around the neckline isn't just one color.  One side is the burgundy stripe but then it transitions to the ivory color.  It sticks out like a sore thumb to me (you can see it in the picture).  I also originally thought I was sent the wrong color - to me this burgundy appears more like a dark red, but as I look online I can see it is what is described as burgundy.  The last thing I would note is that this is slim fitting in the small size.  My rib cage measures only 28 inches around and this fits me with almost no extra wiggle room.<br />Mostly due to the neckline coloring I'm returning the top."
3.0,smells funny
3.0,"Cute set for the price but seems like sizing is more for children. the tail is short, the bowtie is tiny, and the headband is sized for children's head size."
3.0,I loved the design of the glasses but they were hardly tinted at all- not good for a sunny day.
3.0,"Didn’t love these as much as I had hoped. First one stripped. Then one some how got a chunk torn out of the material holding the “glass.” It’s not hard acrylic, more like a clear silicone. Wondering if that’s why my ears itch with these. Also noticed the color has faded severely in one."
3.0,"I recieved 3 smalls, 1 medium, and 2 large triangle earrings. So overall they mispackaged the medium pair with 1 medium and 1 small triangle. Therefore I'm missing a full medium pair/set... pretty disappointing ):"
3.0,Cheap material and I had to end up returning the item because I brought a large for my very petite daughter because she likes all her sweaters over sized and she is 13 years old but doesn’t even weigh 90 pounds yet the sweater fit her small. She didn’t like it and asked me to return them. Since AmZon refused to take them back I ended up giving them away.
3.0,"This is an extremely slim fitted jacket. It's great that it can roll up and be put into the zipper pouch, but it is quite hard to do. The front zipper was rather hard to zip, candle wax didn't help.  It only lasted for about a month.  This is a very light weight rain jacket, but the water resistant factor is extremely poor.  If your walking through a misty fog it might be okay, but a light drizzle will get you damp."
3.0,beautifully made...but have only had it for less than a month and the vinyl is cracking...BTW not Real leather....
3.0,Somewhat small and extremely long other than that nice gown
3.0,"Waist hem in picture was natural waist, was more empire waisted which isn't what I wanted. I ordered the large and it fit otherwise (5'11 185lbs 38 30 42) material wasn't bad, lightweight but not junk. Returned because the design wasn't what I wanted"
3.0,"A really nice  Black  Bay homage - I were it regularly at home - a beautiful watch with nice design and a reasonable Chinese movement - reasonable -6s/day.<br /><br />Cons: no microadjust on bracelet, no complications (I'd like a date), weird auto weight motion - seams with this movement.<br /><br />I had two quality issues. first, when sizing, the link 3 parts came apart several times.  I eventually wrapped pins in cellophane and refit.  Has worked OK.  Second, the bezel pip has disappeared - I won't return the watch for this, but still..."
3.0,Really high neckline do not like at all the really cute dress though but I can’t breathe with anything next to my neck
3.0,Not what I expected. This tote was plastic I was expecting cloth. Still a good size. It will be good for groceries
3.0,"Loose, but works"
3.0,this key is HUGE but it’s still good
3.0,There not what I expected and ran rather large.
3.0,Would have preferred something with a little heavier material.
3.0,"As someone who doesn't normally wear heals, these shoes were very easy to walk in even though the lack of arch support makes it difficult to wear them for long periods of time. I think the two most annoying these that happened was one of the straps breaking (Easy fix with a sewing machine.) and the toe area being a little too &#34;low roofed&#34; I think is the only way to describe it."
3.0,"Absolutely beautiful,  but very body-hugging. It was too tight to wear,  even with a body shaper underneath it, it showed every single bulge. I had to send it back."
3.0,"I am keeping this dress as a nightgown. Even though it is adorable and comfy, I can’t see myself being able to wear it in public. The fabric is extremely thin, and with such a low back, I would not want to wear a bra with it. In most cases that wouldn’t be a death knell for me, but the sheer fabric combined with a looser fit in the chest was just not a good look for me.<br />If you have a larger chest, or one of those nifty backless bras, or have been blessed with breasts that stay up on their own, I would highly recommend the dress."
3.0,Nice looking earrings but before I can even wear it one side wasn’t snapping together..will return for a replacement
3.0,"Cute bras, but they offer no support. I got the 3X and in regular bras I wear a 40DDD. In reading other reviews, I was hopeful for at least fuller coverage with this size. I'm not surprised at having no support, because it's hard to find a regular bra that offers good support for busty women, so I don't expect a sports bra too. Gave 3 stars because they are cute and seem well made"
3.0,"Much too tight and the sock itself is so very thin, very elastic more like a compression sock"
3.0,its alittle big for a Pandora bracelet and the snowflakes are not very clear
3.0,"Decent shades, came a lil bent though They only sit crooked"
3.0,This does not seem to be ceramic.  Looks and feels more like plastic.  Very difficult to take our links to size.  Luckily only one broke and I could strill where it.  For $17 its fine but don't expect it to compare to other ceramic watches.  Go for the Anne Klein versions well made and stylish.
3.0,"I've been wearing a size L in most items recently after having taken off 30 lbs, so I thought the XL on this jacket would be roomy.  I was wrong.  I could barely get it on, and it didn't come anywhere near closing in the front.  I wish there were some standard that clothing manufacturers would stick to for sizing so a person could have more confidence in the size they order, but then there's reality."
3.0,"Basic hoodie with basic Navy lettering. Nothing fancy. Was not my first choice to be honest but another brand fit too snug and this one is more true to size. Length is a bit short but still wearable. Priced reasonably for what you get. If other brands don't fit you, this is serviceable."
3.0,They are a good boot..these are maybe a good yard work boot for the summer maybe into the fall the sizing is somewhat small possible from being made overseas i wouldnt buy again
3.0,We thought it was really cute but it broke after a couple of weeks.
3.0,"The fabric is kinda flimsy and the colors could be more vibrant, but it's an ok shirt."
3.0,I wasn't expecting the silky material...very hugh heffner!
3.0,The size fits; although I wish it was a little narrower.
3.0,"Nice band, love the elastic, easy to attach. But the smallest size was too large.  I had to double it over in the middle and sew it to take out almost an inch of length."
3.0,Nice. But a bit large
3.0,"I loved the band and the look, magnet worked very well. I just had an issue with one of the little  pins falling out and now I can't wear it any more."
3.0,Runs small. I am a 8/10 and purchased a large.. Way to snug
3.0,Its not quite the fabric i expected. It looks rather shiny rather than matte and seems a bit thin. The seems arent well made. On the other hand the fit is fairly generous and as a throw for over your swimmsuit on the beach its ok.
3.0,"These are soft and comfortable but have a 15"" rise.  The inseam is good but because of the large rise, these go up past my belly button.  I am 5'9"" tall.  I gave it 3 stars because in order for me not to walk on the pajama legs, I have to hike this up above my bellow button and the goes down below my but and a bit snug.  The top is also very soft."
3.0,Looks cool and as far as I know it works but having a hard time programming it. It came with no instructions at all which is very poor.
3.0,"I have had this dress in my shopping cart for two months, finally decided to purchase and was a bit disappointed, the dress is nice, but the material is very thin, like T shirt material thin, so definitely wear a body shaper underneath. It feels like after a couple washes the material will start fuzzing/ball up. There is a pleated stitching to the side under the bust, which I didn't notice on the pic before. I am 220lbs 46-36-46 a bit chesty and have a booty I also have big arms, the fit at the arms were a bit snug, but from the shoulders down the fit was a bit loose, which I was grateful for bc of the thinness of the material."
3.0,"Dress runs large. It's okay, but pretty basic cotton dress. Ended up returning it because it was too big."
3.0,This is a good sized bag. Easily fit a larger smart phone and a few small make up items. It stays shut pretty well. The strap is very flimsy and breaks easily but it's good if you just want a clutch and hide or remove the chain.
3.0,"This dress would have 5 stars if it had more fabric where the breast area is. You can see everything! Nips and all, so if you are trying to be sexy at the club than this is your dress. If you plan to wear this around family or children you may need some pasties."
3.0,Watch is beautiful!!!!  Gave it 3 stars cause it keep coming unhooked and falling off.
3.0,only would wear inside the house or as a beach coverup
3.0,"This is a decent product for the price, but you must order at least one size larger than you think you'll need."
3.0,they are thick rings way thicker than the picture. but they are ok for the price I guess that was the only problem
3.0,"Fit fine and was very comfortable. i had to wash it couple of times before wearing it though, it had a very &#34;plastic&#34; or something like that smell."
3.0,"This IS NOT made by MAJESTIC !!<br />It's a basic cheap T-Shirt with the 2018 MLB American League ⚾<br />Champ's: The Red Sox 🎯🥳👍<br />Printed Logo's on it. I bought it because I thought that it was a deal at ONLY $14.99, However, since it's a knock off of a T-Shirt by MAJESTIC,it really ISN'T a 🚫 DEAL any longer..... IS IT❓❓🙃<br />I guess that I'm going to keep it. After all, I'm a Die Hard SOX FAN..<br />Probably, I'll keep it for more of a souvenir, rather than a basic Tee. I'll tuck it away with other items that I've collected from prior Sox World Series wins, as well as other Championship trinkets that I've accumulated from the 🏉 Pat's, the🏒Bruin's and Celtic's🍀  🥳"
3.0,Ordered a large because Allegra K cloths run very small but this one runs large.
3.0,I love this. except it makes my ear swell and gives me pain. but I don't know if it's from not wearing earrings in those holes for a few years or from the bar being thicker then normal. otherwise it would be getting 5 stars.
3.0,like the color but this vendor sizes their
3.0,Personal uses looks good
3.0,It does not fit my tongue my Tongue is way to big. It Keeps falling out of mouth
3.0,"I ordered, from another site, similar gloves.  They were to thin and flimsy.  Well, these are from China and not as much padding and also seem thin but better than the others.  Can't tell yet on durability as just used twice.  Looking for something more substantial"
3.0,"I returned this because the fit was not at all like the photo. Fabric had a heavy drape which seemed nice, and I liked the pattern, but it just fit like an especially baggy potato sack. I'm a 36D and the chest closure came to about my navel no matter how I tried to finagle it."
3.0,"I bought this as a gift and although it was definitely cute, the actual rose looked pretty cheap. Something about the way the flower is shaped and the size just wasn't what I expected. While it DOES look like the picture, it doesn't look as elegant in person."
3.0,Much too small to fit anything but a cell phone and a Kindle.  I am using it until I get something better.  Construction is good.
3.0,"Odd fit, quality not as expected"
3.0,"Not like the quality from Disneyland, but it’s good for the price you are paying!<br />Comfortable! Was able to wear for the entire day at Disneyland and didn’t hurt my head"
3.0,Loved that the earrings stayed in place. It did hurt my ears after a little while. Magnet fell off after a few days.
3.0,This is an ok headband for the price but it arrived without the Nike swoosh as shown in the listing.
3.0,"Range is terrible doesnt work from the street, I have a short driveway."
3.0,The field of vision is great coverage.  The frames are lightweight which is nice but I need something more heavier since these fall off my face and my head.
3.0,"Very small, not high quality fabric. Was nice graphics though"
3.0,my husband is extra large this was too big for him- buy one size small them you would need
3.0,It fit funny and not to the measurements on the guide. Too long in torso too big in the front mons area.
3.0,nice material--runs small
3.0,"The band is nice but it’s difficult to get it to the right size.  Because the Fitbit needs to snug on your wrist to accurately track the band has to be either to tight or its loose and moves around, which causes the Fitbit to not track!  So would I not pleased with it and would t buy it again"
3.0,"The zipper won’t stay up, I have to pin it every time I wear it."
3.0,"Item is good, given the price. And it has a cool retro look. However, it is more like a kids watch. I thought this would be a good cheap watch to wear when I did not want to ruin my nice watch. I have average-small wrists, and this watch looked very tiny and the band was on the second to last hole to fit around my wrist. For this reason the end of the band kept coming out of the small ring that secures the end of the band. Also the light was so poor, you could not really see the screen in the dark. It is a very basic watch . But, I guess what do you get for $14 bucks. I was not happy with it, so I returned it."
3.0,"dont like the fact that they keep slipping of my daughters back of the head. would rather have goggles where the elestic band splits in two, one part being on the top of the head and one part on the lower back of the head. this would ensure the goggles dont fall off"
3.0,"They're only for one ear, these are not sets🤔"
3.0,They dye your hands bright pink every time.
3.0,"Overall, this product is cute. However, it's too big for my wrist, and there is no way to fix it/make it a shorter length. The picture is misleading, because it shows that you have a clasp that has holes for adjustable wrist size. This is, in fact, false. I have uploaded the picture of what the clasp actually looks like. But, you get what you paid for."
3.0,"I ordered a size up and it was still way too small. The color isn’t even gold, it’s more like an ugly"
3.0,"Although this is flattering when worn, it isn’t anything special. I was disappointed it isn’t longer"
3.0,it's fine but i'd point out the material is similar to chicken wire.
3.0,Get the smaller size.
3.0,"This is exactly what I needed, but one of the pins arrived broken."
3.0,"I just received the shirt and my first impression of it:<br />It's so cute!<br />Unfortunately that didn't last long as I was quickly disappointed by the quality of the shirt. I don't just mean the threads sticking out at the stitches, but one of the button holes wasn't even cut out! It has the stitching that clearly shows that's where the hole is supposed to be and has a corresponding button but there is no hole.<br />The shirt itself runs a bit small, I normally wear size M but had ordered a size L just to be safe and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review. All opinions are completely my own and not sponsored by the company or Amazon in any way. I purchased this product with my own my money and thoroughly tested it to provide the best review to help with the purchase of the product. I hope you enjoyed it and it was helpful."
3.0,Bought for my 14 year old daughter for her birthday. A little big for her tiny nose. But they are exactly what was pictured. She did say the flat piece that goes on the inside hurts a little.
3.0,"It is pretty much see-through (not totally but enough to have to wear at least a cami underneath).<br />Otherwise it is nice, runs a tad bit small"
3.0,"Package says “Men’s Collection “<br />Very well made, but this is clearly a man’s shirt.<br />No loss, I will give it to my husband."
3.0,I like the style - 1 star<br />Made well for the price - 2 stars<br />Arrived sooner than expected - 3 stars<br /><br />I'm not giving these 2 more satisfaction stars for the reason that they were NOT new... Had fat finger prints all over and small scratches... sad
3.0,Still not staying closed
3.0,I ordered several different dresses to try on and choose from for a party. My daughter-in-law and granddaughters weighed in on which one they liked the most. Two chose this one. But I sent it back because the fit wasn’t quite right (very short waisted) and it had lots of wrinkles that I didn’t think I would be able to iron out.
3.0,Talla corrió pequeño Le ajusta a mi niña
3.0,Not a big fan. Looked like a hospital gown on.
3.0,I just didn’t like it on me.
3.0,Cards are hard to get out once in wallet. It's just okay.
3.0,The color was not as brilliant in person. I purchased the maroon or purple and it was quite dull unfortunately. It looks like it's well crafted otherwise.
3.0,"I returned the produce because of size, but had no complaints otherwise."
3.0,"I really wanted to like these. They actually fit my calves really nicely. Leggings are always big at the bottom of my calves for some reason. However, they were too small in the waist and bottom. You could see the tag when I’d squat. I’m 5ft 2 and 137lbs and ordered a medium.<br /><br />The material is nice and they are constructed well they just didn’t fit quite right and if I go up a size I’m pretty certain they would be too big in other areas."
3.0,"It really looks nothing like the picture. It’s also much shorter. The front falls just below my daughter’s knee and she is 58” tall. The back is to her ankle. It’s cheap satin with no lining. We’re using it for a costume but I would never buy this for an actual occasion. One note as well: the entire back mesh is buttons, so it all has to be buttoned up one by one. The top mesh fabric is also inexpensive and scratchy. Best for a one-time costume use."
3.0,I was disappointed that there was elastic string to keep this on. Doesn’t show it in the picture. I find that misleading
3.0,Definitely not red. Much more pink. Nice style but I felt it runs a little small. Certainly not a good look for a 36D.
3.0,"The material doesn't seem quite as soft as before and the elastic, which I'm highly allergic to, is exposed in some of the seams around the crotch area of the leg band. Just have to clip it really close, not a good area to have a reaction and sensitive skin exposed to elastic for hours on end. Otherwise, a lot of pairs for the money."
3.0,Overall dress is cute and is of good quality - but if you have an apple-shaped body steer clear. Dress will not compliment this body type.
3.0,The light blue is not even close to the picture more gray-blue.
3.0,"The sweatshirt material seems fine enough, but the “iron on” portion seems really poor quality like it will begin cracking just by looking at it for too long.  My daughter loves the look, but I do not think it will last more than a few wears.  Kind of like it is disposable clothing.  I really hope I am wrong so she is not sad."
3.0,just a gag gift nothing else
3.0,"too big, felll off my face"
3.0,Itchy from inside. Not too bad though.
3.0,"Actual watch band is slightly darker, pebbling of leather is coarser, and padding is thicker. The photo is actually of a different product."
3.0,Just a little too small
3.0,"It is a fine looking sweater, however I caution anyone that would buy or receive this item... if you have any type of difficulty with your hands or fingers, this product is Not easy to button up. The buttons are a bit ""loose"" (by design). Had it been easier to actually button up, I would have kept it. Just an fyi to a potential buyer. I have returned mine."
3.0,"I loved this pin, but I lost it within a week.  The back did not stay on.  Major disappointment."
3.0,"Price was good, but the woodgrain finish starts to wear off in 3-4 months of normal wear.  The lenses also pop out easily.  Expected better, but disappointed."
3.0,"I ordered this in a size large (I usually wear a US size S or M) because that was the only size available on prime. It was too big and shapeless and looked like an oversized bathrobe, so I returned it.  It was warm and comfy and I would probably order again in a smaller size."
3.0,"I just got it and there is a bit of a pull/gap in the middle of my chest. I’m a little bummed, but I’m going to see if I can still make it work."
3.0,"It is too heavy n bulky for under seat use - I could hardly access it when it was there. And I felt it was too bulky on top of my other suitcase, However if it was used as an overnight bag alone , it would be fine."
3.0,The top of the sock should be a little bit bigger for people with bigger calf’s.
3.0,This suit is cute but defiantly size up!<br />When you sit down the lace does buckle and looks silly when sitting down. It's cute if you are planning on standing the whole time wearing it hahaha  I wouldn't buy this again.... but it's still cute but not the ideal suit
3.0,LOVED THE DRESS JUST DIDN'T REALIZE IT RUNS SO SMALL. COULDN'T EVEN ZIP UP ALL THE WAY. ORDER A SIZE UP IF YOU WANT THIS DRESS.
3.0,"These are very cute and seem like they could be comfortable, but be aware when you order that the sizing options you select are not necessarily aligned with what they send. We had to return, much to my daughter's frustration. I purchased a 9-10 Little Kid, and they sent us a 10-11 Little Kid. As of when I purchased and returned, there is no option to select 10-11 Little Kid in this posting. It goes from 9-10 to 11-12."
3.0,I bought this for my daughter and had to return it a soon as it arrived.  The material is very clingy and slippery.  Not good for anyone overweight.  It also runs small.
3.0,"Comfortable fabric, but it’s too short and I’m sure it will shrink upward when I wash it"
3.0,The actual QR code is already half faded. I try to keep the qr exposed because I didn't want it rubbing on my skin and being rubbed off. Rubbed off any way. MyID itself rocks and I would recommend just getting something else instead. Like the stickers.
3.0,These are so cute and the material is soft and thick exactly like I like but they are too small for my 18 month old and I measured her feet per the size chart they provided.
3.0,Clip broke after 1 week.
3.0,"This runs about one size small - I usually wear a medium (women's 10) and bought a medium, which is tight through the arms and shoulders.  Should have bought a large.  Not worth the hassle of returning, but it isn't as comfortable to wear as it should be."
3.0,Nice but started to unstick
3.0,I really liked it. Its a little on the heavy side but its a nice chain. I honestly tried my best to keep this thing untangled but it wasn't on my side. It broke in about two weeks
3.0,"the top part is a little bit too tight & elastic waistline too tight, maybe a wider elastic band dress would hang more nicely around the hips"
3.0,"Looks cool, smells bad. Kinda thought it was a good idea when i bought it, I think it lasted like an hour on the slopes before i ripped it off and put it in my back pack."
3.0,Not the best fit for someone who is tall (5'9&#34;) and has a large chest (DDD). The chest area is a bit tight and the length is awkwardly at the midcalf area. The material is nice and would be great for someone shorter and less endowed on top.
3.0,"Fit as expected, only downfall is how thin the material is."
3.0,"I love the ponytail hole and the design on the hat, but the hat seems to stretch out as you wear it. When first putting it on, it fits nice and snug, but as the day goes on it’s loose, even with Velcro tightened in back."
3.0,I thought they would be more comfortable.
3.0,IT is a cute necklace. They rust quickly but for the price they are ok.
3.0,Had this bead a couple on months now and I already lost a stone!!... but is it pretty and you really don't notice the missing stone.  I only noticed it because I found the stone on my desk.
3.0,It’s a good support bra but I ended up returning it. The zipper on the bottom key rubbing me/scratching me raw. Tried wearing it twice but just didn’t do well. While running it rubbed terribly.
3.0,"Very pretty, but i was wanting to purchase a natural quartz and found it wasn't . Still i love the chain and use it for another crystal."
3.0,I had a chance to try on. Very soft and fit super good! Love the feel and they will be warm. Good quality and came quick.
3.0,workmanship and materials are good.<br />had to trim for length.<br />don't care for the extra steel retaining loops.
3.0,"These are cute and look good on, but caused slot of pressure on my head. They were too tight for me and I'm a small woman. My son now uses<br />these for events and concerts."
3.0,Larger than anticipated
3.0,Not sure what happened with this pair but they fit weird. Either way they stay on and he likes them
3.0,"cute and liked material.  I wear large and all 4 of the other shirts I ordered fit great, but this one I could barely get over my head!"
3.0,I disliked the earrings were made of paper and the bracelet was smaller in size.
3.0,"Nice product, but oversized. Bought for 5T, looks like a 7-8T"
3.0,"Good clock, I've been using it for almost two years, just want to know how can I get a replacement battery? Well I'm failing, but the clock is good"
3.0,Not stretchy enough.  Doesn't want to stay up.  I have to put a clip on the back to keep them tight enough to not constantly fall down. I am a 200 pound man.
3.0,Sizing not so great! I will be finding a way to tailor.  I Iove the color and the neckline but the rest will need some adjustment.  Beware it took almost 3 weeks for delivery.
3.0,Was way more purple in person than it looks in the pictures. Fit & finish what you would expect for a low cost robe.
3.0,its thicker than I thought. Already lost a tassel and if you look you can see that they're basically just hot glued in. Looks cute layered though.
3.0,"Lord erred next size up,wear it with some leggings so I can bend over."
3.0,I have purchased this brand before and was very impressed. This particular style not so much. In about a week the insole was coming out and peeling back by the end if the following week it was completely out. I tried to glue them back in but that was a no good. They are already skuffing all around the edges and they smell horrible. I know my 5 yr old is active but never has his shoes smelled this bad.  Basic care isnt enough you will need to wash weekly.
3.0,I thought the bags were bigger as I wanted to use them as a gift bag. I love what it says but I just thought they were bigger
3.0,"Just received but notice two differences! I ordered RED but this is a true RUST color! In the on-site image, the top is tied into a twist and the cut is straight across! The product I received has a loop which the material is stitched around (loop is made of same fabric) and hangs down into two points on each side of the loop. Images that others have posted will better explain what I’m describing BUT neither of those images have the fabric loop I mention! What would make this item much cuter was if the top was not cut with such angles on each side of the tie and was actually rounded like the Seller’s images!!!!!! Even with the two differences, the top is cute enuff & for the cost am thinking of keeping. BUT if you’re looking for a red top you need to keep searching bcuz top this is far from red and definitely more of a rusty orange!"
3.0,I received this a bit bent out of shape. I was able to carefully fidget with it to make it look like a crescent<br /> again. Its pretty and delicate otherwise and I'm looking forward to gifting it to whom I'd bought it for.
3.0,"The graphics weren't screen printed on the tshirt very well. Even brand new, the graphics looked a bit faded. I'm glad they did provide a bag to wash it in! Really cute shirt design and fit."
3.0,"Love the bag, fun for summer but the zipper broke off after just a few uses."
3.0,Color price all good.  16” chain too short.  Need extender.
3.0,"Shorter than I expected. I'm a male wearing a size 11 shoe, I would say these socks are more for a woman per say"
3.0,I ordered a size down as recommended by reviews and it’s still pretty big. It’s cute enough but the material is rather thin. I’m going to use it as a beach cover up instead of a dress.
3.0,The dress is very pretty but a bit see-thru.  The stretch part in the waist kept moving up to under my bust and made it look like an empire waist dress which to me made me look like I was pregnant.  I ordered according to my bust size and got the medium. For reference I'm 5'4 140lbs. Overall the fit was good but I just didn't like how the dress looked on me.
3.0,"These masks were super pretty, super-soft, and great with adjustability.  However, every time I put them on to get them to stay in place and not slide, they had to be really tight, and then if I talk, the fabric goes into my mouth.  Even if I am walking and start to breathe through my mouth, the fabric kind of chokes you; it's odd.  I can not find a happy medium between staying on my face properly and not choking myself if I need to open my mouth."
3.0,"Love the way it looks on. However the chain keeps breaking. I am still able to wear it, the chain keeps getting shorter and shorter."
3.0,"I bought the 3/8 and you can tell that there actually the 5/6 so they are to small for my nose, but they look really good and like it’s good quality"
3.0,"Cute, but very flimsy and definitely for smaller wrists. The pink fuzzy slips off very easily too."
3.0,"Got the purple- the color is much darker than shown online. I was hoping for a light purple, instead it's pretty dark. Maybe it'll look lighter outside.  The plastic also feels pretty flimsy but you get what you pay for so can't really consider that a 'complaint'. They're cool for the price."
3.0,"If you have any belly at all, the white top will accentuate it. Sexy sexy belly fat. But they are hella comfy and cute AF otherwise."
3.0,good for the money but basically pretty inferior goods
3.0,This shirt is super comfy and soft which is great but the material is thin and it’s big in a way that is not flattering.
3.0,Color darker and not as purple as expected but nice
3.0,Material is cheap and see through...would be fine for a beach coverup tho
3.0,Not as large as I hoped
3.0,I like the shirt but its too big on me and I thought it would be shorter.
3.0,Pop easy
3.0,"These earrings are extremely cute, but smaller and more delicate than I expected."
3.0,"It is a nice bathingsuit but for big boobs girls it is not good a large size, I just order an extra large just to check how it fits. If fits better than the large I will ask for a refund and merchandise return on the large one. Let's see tommorow."
3.0,"The gloves are very pretty, keep me warm, and seem durable. Unfortunately the little hearts used for touchscreens did not work well."
3.0,i orderer in color black and come in white
3.0,Not made very strong. They ripped after a few weeks of wearing
3.0,A couple of days after wearing the finishing begun to wear off. Product was not exposed to water and moisture.  The discoloration is mainly on the bottom of the wristband so no one can really see it. I get lots of compliments. People often thing my Galaxy watch is Michael Kors because of the band.
3.0,Nice belt.  The material not so great but overal reasonably priced.  I have been looking for a red brown belt.  This doesn't match the red brown shoe I was hoping.  Over all nice bent.
3.0,It’s ok. Worth the price.
3.0,They are beautiful but they hurt my right ear . I think my ear whole maybe to small on that size
3.0,Top too small for  a c-cup or over.
3.0,"Product came on time, only 2 were the same, BUT the colored paint has been coming off my tongue ring in chunks...Probably won't order again, I DID like the included short gauge ruler included in the packaging though!"
3.0,Shorter than expected for 7/8 but material is good
3.0,It works but rolls up every time I sit down.
3.0,Runs very small but is so pretty!
3.0,"The dress is very nice. Love the texture and design, however it was too small.  I ordered a 2xl based on sizing chart. Normally in store I purchase XL and this dress was still too small. Either the sizing chart is incorrect or I was sent the wrong size"
3.0,"The earrings are a little heavy and uncomfortable if worn all day, but they look good."
3.0,"If you're an XL like me, you might want to order one size up to be certain."
3.0,"Material is a bit weird, but cute otherwise."
3.0,Good fit but snags really easy not very high quality made
3.0,These jeans are kind of tight around the waist and in the crotch area and seem longer than 32&#34;.  Good news is they are warm.  I only hope the zipper holds up as it seems kind of flimsy to me.
3.0,"I wouldn't wear it, but I just had to see what a $7 watch from amazon looked like"
3.0,it looks a little bit bigger than size m
3.0,"I was not expecting the waist to be as high as it is. In the pictures, it's just under belly-button height. In reality, they come up several inches higher. It feels like wearing weird spanx. Like spanx, the top also has a habit of rolling. I'm 5'3 and chubby, so YMMV. The material was good quality, it's definitely not see-through, the lining is super soft, and all seams appear to be well sewn and reinforced."
3.0,"Loved the look but one of the rings broke right in half putting it on. Too bad, they are very pretty. Wouldn't recommend"
3.0,Returned and ordered larger
3.0,"These are not hard hats, they are a flimsy plastic but they were great for my sons construction theme party!!"
3.0,"Now I know how it feels to be visually impaired. You will need someone to guide you down the haunted road, lest you be swallowed alive by the thick fog swirling in front of you."
3.0,"Bought the biggest size. .. xl i think and the band in the center is a little tight and the padding keep shifting around. .. i think if your a petite person then this will be great on you.  It's OK tho I go to the gym so I'll probably fit better in it in a few weeks. Measurements 38D,  waist 30&#34; and hips 42&#34;"
3.0,Ok we like it
3.0,"The dress is cute and looks more formal, but the straps are super thin and offer little to not support or structure to the dress."
3.0,They keep falling down.
3.0,"I bought these to wear instead of a compression garment, I figured they were like one I had years ago but they aren’t, they’re like tight tank tops. I will still use them under my fajas after my hysterectomy surgery though."
3.0,"The material is too thin, like a night gown. I’ll wear around the house, but not out in public."
3.0,Way too small for adults
3.0,"If you don't have a butt you should be fine😂😂😂 But if you are well endowed they will sit extra low in the back....sliding down, showing panties low. The front is almost to the bra line."
3.0,They got destroyed within a month.
3.0,"Price a bit high, but otherwise works as expected. Found one slightly cheaper at walmart a week after purchase."
3.0,This didn't wear well on me. Great colors but it was too blah. I returned.
3.0,"I wanted to love this outfit, i really did.. i even bought 2 sizes to make sure i ended up with one but unfortunately i am returning both. The outfit itself has a nice look (on the model) but if you dont have a ""body"" then just dont because the pattern on both top & bottom will only make your situation worse lol. Anyway, im 5'8 and it wasnt as long as its suppose to be. Maybe if you are like 5'5 it will be perfect for you (and probably wont even drag on you either) but for us unfortunate tall girls.. issa no."
3.0,"UPDATE:  After reaching out to the seller about my disappointment, they refunded my 50% of my cost AND are sending me a new pair of shoes as well.  Hopefully this pair is better.  Will follow-up.  Definitely impressed by their concern and customer service.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought these sneakers TWICE for my 10 year old son.  He is hard on shoes so when the lace broke the first time I figured it was just how he plays.  It snapped apart in the first 3 mos.  The second pair we purchased just broke and it was just under 3 weeks!  Because the laces are elastic they can't be repaired.  I'm going to attempt to return for a refund.  Super disappointing."
3.0,"These are nice sunglasses, however they are really white on my face and therefore not flattering. I will be returning them but I'm sure they might look nicer on somebody else."
3.0,"For diabetic's, they need to be thicker to keep feet warmer.  Good quality and appear to be well made."
3.0,"They're really comfortable and they fit well, but the holes in this pair are poorly made. It looks like someone just took a pair of scissors to them versus the normal, almost shredded hole look that most distressed jeans have. For that reason alone I give them 3 stars and will return them. In the picture, you can see what I mean, as well as see the color."
3.0,They are pretty cheap quality but I'm embroidering dog bandanas so they should do for that.
3.0,"The ring is very pretty, but I am having to send it back as the wrong size was sent to me.  I ordered a size 6, but received a size 5.  I hope they are willing to exchange it for the right size."
3.0,Super cute and my son adores these and asks for them every time we go outside- some strings inside made it hard to get my sons hand comfortable in the mitten before I trimmed them. The string connecting the two mittens is easily broken as well (not a big deal to me but may be to some)
3.0,"Very cute, detailed, but the metal used for the cats was thinner then I was expecting which make the earrings feel cheap. I gave them to my niece for her birthday only because she has a cat that looks exactly like them."
3.0,I didn't like it so have to return it.
3.0,straps were way to long and are not adjustable.  will have to alter the bathing suit to make it fit properly.  It's a very nice looking bathing suit though.
3.0,"I always order my dresses in a medium. This dress fits like a shirt. It was cute, which is why I purchased it but I can’t wear it because it’s too small. It also looks like someone ripped the tag out of the inside of the dress so I don’t know what size it actually is."
3.0,Looks great but bar was too short so I couldn’t fit
3.0,"I am 5’3” and 175lbs, with 36 DD chest. I ordered a large and had to return it due to it being a little tight but mainly because the pockets stuck out far in my hips. I also ordered and XL and the size fit but same issue of the pockets sticking out on my hips so I returned it again."
3.0,"I want go like it because of the fabric, but it looks bulky on the pelvic stea. Maybe i ordered the wrong size."
3.0,"I was looking for SUPER DARK, not super dark, smh but it does cover all the sunlight areas."
3.0,"These boots were painfully hard and I had to return them. They offer no cushion inside but they look absolutely great. If you can get past the pain and don't plan on walking a lot, they may be worth the purchase. They did not allow enough room to add an insert. I could feel the outline of the heel through the boot."
3.0,Waist is extremely big
3.0,PROS:  Pretty.  Soft.  Well made.<br />CONS:  Size XL (4) fit more like a size M.<br />100% cotton means it will shrink too.  :(
3.0,"Returned.  Sorry, one size does not fit all."
3.0,I am usually a 0-2 and the small and x small were WAY too small.
3.0,Would be perfect but shrunk once you washes them. Happy to give it 5 stars if I get a new pair
3.0,"I wanted to love these because the fabric is so breathable and comfy. BUT the fit is so bad. The waist band has no give and gives me a serous muffin top which isn’t normal for me. And the shorts stretch out and by the end of the day, they’re all saggy and bunched up. Wool underwear is a great idea, but they need work."
3.0,I like the boots were a little too big
3.0,"Great quality, but they didn't look so ""cat eye"" shaped in the pics & they're much larger frame than expected. Wouldn't really call them unisex because the corners make them look ""cat eye"" like. Not our style."
3.0,The pins came with a VERY hard backing.  I could barley take the back off.  They are heavy too.  Not the best product in my opinion 😬.  Don’t buy it
3.0,I love the cut and the exposed shoulders but the material is a little thin and clingy.
3.0,These are pretty nice pants. I wasn’t expecting the sheen. They are a little too shiny but i kept them and i wear them around the house.
3.0,I bought two. The black on black ripped right away and the grey on black is decent!
3.0,"My son tried these on to get them adjusted to wear with his uniform - one of the straps was stitched poorly and came off.  For the price, this should not come imperfect or poorly assembled.  Would be different if they were $3.00."
3.0,This swimsuit is beautiful but is made for long torso women.
3.0,They are a little shorter than I expected.  The black background is a little faded.
3.0,I really like these until the nose pads fall off.  They get lost and the 2 prongs sticking out hurt your nose.  Either you need to glue them on or the MFG needs to make them more secure and or provide extras.<br />The bi-focal lenses are placed perfectly for my needs.  magnification options are also perfect for my needs.  Only issue is the nose pads.  I am not buying anymore sets just because the pads fall off and get lost.  Looking for another brand that solves this issue.
3.0,Photo is better than product. Very cheapy definitely get what you pay for. It is good for a kid which is whom I bought this for
3.0,"Great price for such a cute dress. Material was a little stiff but you get what you paid for. Wish there were belt loops because it moves whoever I walk and I have to keep readjusting. Also, when I received the dress there was light grey numbers that looked like had been written in marker on the back. Wasn't really noticeable at first but after giving it a wash it went away.<br /><br />Besides that, I received lots of compliments and will definitely be wearing throughout the summer."
3.0,Not as pictured but okay.
3.0,The top runs small size :(
3.0,"Got the size petite small in heather color.  I am 4'11"" and 112lb.  Since I am very short, I found the leg length on these just perfect.  The color was very good BUT the fabric was a bit too thin for my liking and very tight across the hips where it looked like I was in spandex.  This look made me uncomfortable so had to return them.  Someone else may want this tight look and just love them, but I'm 59 years old and a slim build but still didn't think it looked right."
3.0,great but too big for me
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:7eb212d7cea8782eeecec46a6261b83e]] I’ve ordered a few of these(because I have double nose piercings)<br />Went back to order more because I lost one, from the same company and received ones that were entirely different.<br />Smaller opal and longer bar than the ones I’ve previously ordered."
3.0,not very soft
3.0,"Works, but binding"
3.0,Really cute but the surgical steel must not apply to the dangly charm because it’s already rusting /turning color.
3.0,"The fabric is adorable and cotton-like, but if you have boobs at all, it will not close in front!"
3.0,"not bad, not great"
3.0,"I purchased a set of Sharper Image packing cubes at TJ Maxx and love them so much I wanted to grab some more. These bags went on lightning deal so I figured I would try them out for the prime shipping convenience and price. After a 1 week trip a lot of the pulls broke.. not the end of the world but overall the quality of these bags is ok<br /><br />*UPDATE* I’ve added a 4th star because the company reached out to me after seeing my review and offered a replacement or refund on my order. I am impressed by their customer service, I was not expecting them to contact me."
3.0,Fun piece of costume jewelry and a good conversation piece. I noticed that the paint appeared to be chipping off already as soon as I got the necklace- but for under $2 for the necklace it was not unexpected.
3.0,"Very disappointed. Medium size fits like Small. very difficult to zip it without help.  Fabric is cheap, very thick , unpleasant on touch to skin. Took almost a month to get it"
3.0,"Upon taking the case out of the packaging it looks much more ""red"" than bright pink/fuscia...my daughter even commented on the same thing. It feels decent and fits my phone perfectly. Major issue....I put one credit card in it, my corporate security pass and one business card in the three slots. I then put three very thin post-it notes in the area behind the slots and the magnetic piece will not hold.<br /><br />I'm going to return it and order another FYY product like what I had for my Note 5 phone as it was the most quality product I bought in a few years and the magnetic clasp was long enough to go around and strong enough to hold in place.<br /><br />Disappointing because otherwise it seems to be a nice wallet case."
3.0,"Santin material, reminds me of a neglage more than a dress for evening wear on a beach vacation."
3.0,"I got the medium and it fit everywhere EXCEPT the bust. I'm 5'3"", 125 lbs. I read the reviews that this dress did not fit big-breasted women (one was 38DD). I don't consider myself big-breasted - average. But it pulled so much at the buttons that I would have had to unbutton it and wear something under it. The fabric was nice, seemed like it would wash well. Soooo disappointed. Had to threaten to file a claim with Amazon before they finally refunded."
3.0,I didn't realize tht it came with different sizes so I made my daughter a band for her apple watch and actually used a little bigger size and didn't realize it..even tho it states three sizes it makes you think it fits up to those size not knowing each one fits a different band..confusing I never knew til my daught pointed it out so ya they worked great but need marked as to which size is which
3.0,They’re cute shirted but a “girls Small” fits like an3T-4T
3.0,"Well they are disposable masks. Bought them for a funeral because my grandmothers fav color is purple. Thought they were completely purple, even the white part at the top (like the original picture says)... they are not they ha e white and purple. So not a huge deal but not as pictured. But they work."
3.0,"These are comfy. Pretty thick and warm. If you're going to sweat a lot, these are not the right pants as they aren't very breathable. I'm 5'8&#34; and these are too short for me with the stirrup. They also run large."
3.0,The blue is very pretty and the material felt awesome. It does go up higher in the neck than pictured. It came up right to my neck as opposed to showing any collarbone. The belt was not good very flimsy and small.
3.0,"It actually is very long. Like...very long. I may keep it and take it to a seamstress for hemming. I like the material and the fit is a bit large, but I like it that way."
3.0,"I found it quite long but I am 5.3'' so probably under the average. The quility though it was good and the color, a chic white cream. But I had to return it back."
3.0,"Love it that they’re made in USA, and agree that the quality of the material is very good.  They are the same color on both sides, and will eventually (after a number of wash/dry), will be soft enough for my face.  However, they are NOT 22”, and in fact, mine are not even square.  I haven’t measured all five, but the two I did measure were 20” x 21”.  Maybe they shrink while drying the first time, but if that’s the case, maybe the item description should mention that.  In fact, if that’s the case, the company should make a 24” bandana that would end up at 22”, I’d buy some of those.  The size is important to me, because on our Texas ranch, we get dust storms, and I need them to cover my face, tied behind my neck.  So, I am pleased with the made in America quality of these, but not pleased with the incorrect sizing."
3.0,"Son exactamente como las fotos, lo único que tienen un olor súper fuerte semejante a un diluyente de pintura (thinner)... lo que hice fue sacarlos de sus bolsitas de empaque y el olor a disminuido mucho!!<br /><br />Fuera de eso, a mi hija le han encantado!"
3.0,"This shirt/dress is not for my body type. I'm 5'5, 160 lbs, and I carry a lot of weight around my waist. I thought that maybe because it was supposed to be a dress, that the extra material would allow me to pull it off as a shirt. The fabric is very thin, and doesn't really have any structure. It doesn't look good on me, but I think it would be quite cute on a slender girl."
3.0,"The shirt is really cute and cropped just the right length, just a bit below my belly button. The only problem is that it’s very small and it fits way too fitted. I would have gone up to an XL if it had been available at the time. I usually wear a small and ordered a large."
3.0,The belts(straps) are too short
3.0,Love the bag! Looks just like the picture and the price is reasonable but it took forever to arrive.
3.0,"In the picture, the skirt looked gorgeous but in me it doesn't look like the picture, the back has more fabric and the front a little, it doesn't looked like the picture, the waist it get a little wrinkle when I sit, and I am not plus sized. Sorry for my English."
3.0,"I did like the style concept. The light blue ruffle (I ordered navy with light blue ruffle) was surged on the bottom and not hemmed. That coupled with the fabric itself made it look cheap. Sadly, I had to send it back."
3.0,"We liked the shoe, but not so much the black sole and it ran a little small. On one of the shoes there was a tiny place unstitched. Returned them with no problem."
3.0,the silver faded after approximately 1 year of occasional use
3.0,Exactly as pictured! A lil on the cheeky side for this gal and honestly super skinny through the crotch..: but it’s cute lol
3.0,When I got this I took one look at it and thought there was no way it would fit me. I followed the size chart and since I'm usually a 38DD prepregnancy and I'm at the point in our breastfeeding journey that I don't get engorged anymore I ordered the 2xl. Upon arrival I double checked that they didn't send the wrong size it looked tiny. Dh convinced me to try it anyways I had nothing to lose (other than my confidence) to my great surprise it fits me well and feels amazing. It's not as restrictive as other nursing bras but not so loose you don't have any support and for only 40$ I'm highly impressed. I will definitely be recommending these to all my nursing moms that are top heavy. This is the best my breasts have felt since before my pregnancy and DD is 11mos.<br /><br />Update after wearing for a bit and washing a few times I don't feel this way built to last. It's definitely not going to last a year. It's soft it's comfortable. The foam pads are a joke they keep folding over on themselves inside the bra when using as intended. At first I was highly impressed now not so much. Still good but the shiny new toy affect has worn off. And I'm noticing the flaws.
3.0,"Work as intended, quality and color not so much."
3.0,It looks like nylon and 3 where missing. I guess it's not bad.
3.0,"I teach yoga and have sampled and worn hundreds, yes hundreds of yoga pants. I was attracted to the cool designs offered with these yoga pants. I ordered the xsmall in cobalt blue. There are swirls of blues, greens, gold, light and dark purple. The fabric is buttery soft but offers little to no support and is modestly see-through. The size is way off also. I ordered an xsmall but it fits like a small/medium. I was hopeful that these yoga pants would work. These might work for some, but for me they lacked support and ran larger than anticipated."
3.0,This top is not for me. First the color is misleading. I ordered purple. The picture shows a deep purple or eggplant color purple. The color I received was somewhere in between a light plum and dark fuscia. The knot is not as defined as displayed in the picture. I gave it three stars only because it did fit as expected.
3.0,"The Listing makes you believe you're ordering a Women's &#34;Slouchy Wideneck Sweatshirt&#34; and suggests &#34;Want an off-the-shoulder look? Order a couple sizes larger.&#34;<br /><br />So I assumed they used women's sizes. Normally I'm a Medium/large so I ordered a Large.<br /><br />I received a large UNISEX CREWNECK sweatshirt. Needless to say I drown in this sweat shirt, and there is no way I can do the &#34;off-the-shoulder look.&#34;<br /><br />While it is a red sweatshirt that says &#34;chill&#34;,  it is badly printed and I really am displeased.<br /><br />*EDIT*<br /><br />I contacted the seller about my order and the sent the me the correct sweatshirt for free, and told me to keep the incorrect one. They said it would be sent express however, it took a little while to get to me. The correct sweater is perfect. I'm normally a medium to large and it fit great. It is also very soft and comfortable.  The print of &#34;CHILL&#34; still isn't as great as the picture, but it's not horrible."
3.0,"These arrived neatly packaged and have a cute little velvet bag to store them in. So far, just one of them arrived broken, I don't know about all of the others since I haven't opened all of them yet. They're not small like other reviewers have mentioned, they fit both my 5 year old and myself. I guess $10 is an OK price for all of these anklets."
3.0,Exactly what you expect stress marks on the crystals but pretty and for a cheap cute craft
3.0,Love the outfit my daughter is a tiny two year old so she will have to grow into it but overall outfit came in perfect condition love the style looks just like photo
3.0,Watch band is cute love hearts. Unfortunately very disappointed that the clip bust loose it does not stay on. It clips and stays but out of no where the band comes loose. Almost dropped my watch and I could have damage it. Definitely returning it back. So bummed!
3.0,The masks are just okay quality and arrived almost a month late
3.0,Am returning photo did not display item accurately. Prompt delivery was great!
3.0,Beautiful shirt but extremely small. I had to give it to my daughter
3.0,Mine broke while trying to tighten.
3.0,"This hat has a blue and red hat band that is glued on with a heat sensitive glue.  What this means is do not put this hat in a hot dryer or that band will come off and the glue will permanently stain any part of the hat it touches or other cloths in the dryer.  Recommend sowing the band in place if you have to use heat to dry it.  This hats waterproofing treatment work very well and will prevent the hat from fading easily if one wants a warn in look; this hat does not play that way.  Out of the box is looks fantastic, and I am sure it would of been fine had I skipped drying it.  Live and learn.  My hat was ruined by me being stupid but it does have a lot of character now and is still quite cumfy."
3.0,"I always order Large in leggings.....and a large is like an extra large.  I like my leggings to fit close and hug my skin...these are loose, especially in the legs.  They were also longer than the other &#34;name brand&#34; leggings I normally like to purchase."
3.0,rather thin
3.0,https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B017O1MDWU/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
3.0,The size fits good but the screen print is not what I had expected. It’s slick & cheap looking
3.0,"I had these as a party favor for my 80s birthday party. People seemed to like them, My only issue was that some of the lenses were blurry and made them hard to see out of. Otherwise great for a party favor."
3.0,"I bought this for my nephew award ceremony, it was purchase days in advance. It arrived the pants were too short, the shirt is a lovely print, the vest was too small . We were able to use the shirt with another suit. If ordering get size larger to be on the safe side. Linen usually runs small"
3.0,ok product.
3.0,The material is soft on the inside and looks cute with jeans or leggings. The only problem was that it runs small and the length is short also it shrinks when you wash it. I didn't even put it in the dry and I washed it in cold water and it still shrank. If you are going to order this just get one size larger at least.
3.0,"I bought it for my husband, but it is too small for him.  I ended up with pajamas."
3.0,Feels cheap and has no give when working out.
3.0,Buckle is kinda small
3.0,"So within 5 minutes of wearing this the chain broke, the charm is still cute and I'm sure I can just put it on a different chain, just a warning to be prepared with another chain because this one isn't going to last."
3.0,"Nice enough sweatshirt but after 2 washes and a month of wear (not every day!), it’s disgusting and covered with pills. See photo"
3.0,I could see the padding from the outside of the sports bra and it did not provide enough support for what I was looking for. I bought the blue color but it looked more gray than blue.
3.0,They fit well and I don't have stick thin legs. The only problem is the design is not printed straight as shown in the listing picture. Too bad.
3.0,"Got it right on time,and satisfied with the items. ( :"
3.0,I guess for 3.59 you can't expect the whoa factor. The face of the watch should have a sharper image. The quirky face is the draw and the reason for purchasing the watch. This face looks like it was done on a low image printer or copier. The little velvet bag gives one the impression that this a step above.
3.0,Hat doesn't fit my 7 7/8 head. It looks great just not for big headed people. I'll give it to my brother for Christmas. He has a normal size head!
3.0,"This was just a bit too small but I think when I lose weight I'll be able to fit into . But I love the shirt,didn't want to send it back. Going to try everything I can to fit into it ."
3.0,"These look really cute but the memory foam is wafer thin. Zero support. The fur, which I assumed was ""faux"", feels and looks as though it might be real bunny. I am praying I am wrong."
3.0,I'm 5'7&#34; and these were not nearly long enough. I just constantly have to pull them down.
3.0,"It’s ok, only worn twice and but it would fit better if it was tighter in the ends with a lil grip to hold it in place"
3.0,Has a horrible odor
3.0,The waistband is separating. My wife just smiled and stated. &#34;I think I can fix it.&#34; I feel bad that she has to do that to a gift. However she wants to try.
3.0,"I ordered the hot pink necklace and although I like it, unfortunately mine is defective. The longest pendant from the necklace is off centered. Based on the product page photo of it, mine seems to have one too many smaller pendants on the right of the longest one. The longest pendant is also missing a small bead. :( I've attached a photo of what my necklace looks like. My finger indicates the longest pendant, which should be at the center. :("
3.0,they're really cute but one of the rubber support things broke soon after getting them :/
3.0,"Bottoms are great.  Like previous posters said, the top is virtually worthless.  WAYYYYY too small."
3.0,"They are nice, just can't fit them. They are not true to size. No where near. I'm 6.4 with a 42 waistline. I ordered a 2XL, they were tighter than my boxer briefs."
3.0,"I bought this scarf for the 2011-12 Chicago Winter.  It's a nice scarf, I don't think it's worth the price though.  Yes it is Kashmir, but it is not very thick.  The length is nice, but not too long, which I would have actually wanted since this is so thin.  Perfect for moderately cold temperatures, but anything below 20 degrees and you're going to need something a little more heavy duty.  Nice dark gray color and highlights of red/maroon."
3.0,"This necklace and earring is pretty striking, but a close look shows it's inexpensive costume jewelry.  Given the price, it's fine if you have a specific outfit that it will complement  - but it's a big, heavy piece of jewelry and not something you will not wear often."
3.0,The descriptions of this hat are confusing. There are 2 different ads for this hat. Both say leather trim (band) but the picture shows a cloth (felt) band.<br />The first one I bought was through Ebay from another vendor. It was very nice hat but it's was way over sized. Had to return it. May have been incorrectly marked. (?)<br />I always buy X-Large hats and my measurements are for a X-Large. I'll try a Large.<br /><br />This hat a Large fit perfect. But it had a defect. Tried return for an exchange. They wanted me to pay for return shipping. From there I had to get Amazon involved. I'm getting a refund from Amazon A to Z. This company created more misunderstanding and<br />confusion than I want to go through. Just hope it fits and it doesn't have any defects so you don't have to return it.
3.0,"i like this hat, and bought many more.  But after a time the clip in back does not keep it snug to fit.  So I stitched a little on the back to keep it from slipping bigger."
3.0,"Love the fact I have so many now, but it is cheap acrylic. I have had three spikes crack in half already when I was trying to screw them on."
3.0,A little small.  Somewhat flimsy material.
3.0,"As other review says, the wristlets are definitely  smaller than average. But what bothers me most is that the inside of the key ring is rusty, the plastic band turned black after running through it. Don’t know how long the outside of the key ring will stay clean."
3.0,"Size and fit: I bought 3 other swimsuits with this one. Two were 18W and the third XXL. I got this in 18W. It doesn't fit as snuggly as the others. Feels like it may have been for a taller person (I'm 5""5'). The right sub-mammary area has too much lose cloth.<br /><br />Colour: The red doesn't 'pop' as much as I would like it to<br /><br />Material: no problems<br /><br />Stitching: seems secure"
3.0,"Should have ordered small instead of medium. I'm 5'5 140 lbs, fit curvy. The medium is loose in mid section and a bit in the straps. Good price though"
3.0,I like the bracelet!
3.0,"The Watch itself is nice For sure.. however. The box was damaged, and the watch was just put in the box, wasn't strapped to a pillow or anything just freely bouncing around. I'll edit this after further inspection of the watch. No to impressed with the way the seller felt it was ok to ship it.."
3.0,Missing chain
3.0,"Runs very small. After 1 wash, pants are faded and there is a hole in the crotch area. Arms are tight and we sized up a full size."
3.0,Love the quality & look of the item. I hate that it only comes as 1 there should be an option to buy as a pair.
3.0,"My little sister wanted something with the mood changes and we found this very pretty, sadly the same day it came it broke a few minutes after she put it on.<br /><br />She was very sad but I worked my magic and was able to fix it another way and removed the part that would come lose once she wore it. It now works but without a certain part to it, thus we still appreciate it.<br /><br />She is happy and I am happy, so as long as it doesn't break it is a good piece, pretty good for its price."
3.0,"This shirt is very thin. Good to wear under something else, which is what I bought it for."
3.0,"These are decent jeggings. They run quite large, so if you think you are a 16/18, you may need to size down. They look and actually feel like regular jeans, but definitely buy them elsewhere."
3.0,Expect to reglue everything.  Still worthy of 3 stars because my daughter loves it.
3.0,No bad for the price. Especially being gold plated and zircon. Why not make it a notch or two better and increase the price point around $50.00. I've seen bootcamp grads pay up to $300.00 for cheap quality rings that were not as nice.
3.0,"I bought these necklaces a year ago and while I really love how dainty and feminine they are, I had initially bought five of the gold ones for myself and four friends to wear as friendship necklaces more or less and the gold all rubbed off and now they are silver. They still look good and have held together well but I just wish that the gold coloring had stayed. Not a single trace of it is gold but I still love it and wear it almost every day."
3.0,"The material was much heavier than I expected. I planned on wearing this as a cover up for the beach but it is too heavy a material, would be way to hot. Other than that it is fine."
3.0,Hard to hold in hand.
3.0,"I ordered a size large, but It is is a slightly too small.  The quality is fine."
3.0,The problem with this bra mostly is it’s a little scratchy. Clearly there is zero padding so she wears it mostly for me as it’s sexy but not for out of the house because she really prefers padded bras for comfort and to hide her nipples.  Fits fine as expected. For its purpose it’s fine just said it’s kinda scratchy.
3.0,Beautiful vest.....good quality.....well made..... I ordered a XXL it was at least 2 sizes too small on my husband who is NOT a slim fit......LOL.....It is so pretty I am keeping it for my son who wears a LG slim fit.....So I will stick with it runs 2 sizes  small even for slim fit.......
3.0,Somewhat small in the bust area not sure if I want to keep pulling the top up to cover my upper half of my body.
3.0,"These are fine and do the job, the I've only had them a while and the toe area is already getting thinner and showing through."
3.0,"Beautiful ring, but bc the adjustability feature is basically pinching the metal around your finger & the weight of the ring, it doesn’t stay out and keeps sliding around."
3.0,Girlfriend thought they were uncomfortable and not well made
3.0,Choker would not stay layered!
3.0,"So the watch is lovely--even more striking than the photos can display and has heft to it. But NOTE: you must clockwise wind the crown before setting the date or time (this means 20 rotations in the direction away from your body). You can also do this later should you not wear your watch for an extended period of time. But ""automatic"" does not mean self-winding when unworn, so don't panic if the watch is stopped shortly after buying it. The packaging weighs 3 lbs. because of a ridiculously heavy manual which has only one page relevant to this model. But here's the real down side: the manufacturer's warranty does not transfer because the watch is sold through a third company. They will do repairs if needed but only within 30 days of purchase. Amazon's own return policy is also 30 days and only if the watch doesn't show signs of wear or had links removed on the band to fit the wrist, as mine was. Supposedly, purchasers receive a discount on the watch via this website but might not be worth the worry on repairs."
3.0,"Love the color & the price.  But as others have said, it runs VERY small and tight.  I ordered size XL and still tight but ok for workouts (I usually wear a medium!)"
3.0,Quote charm fell off key chain within 2 weeks.
3.0,"Cute, but waaaaaay too small compared to same size in local store. Buy. Few sizes up."
3.0,Nice shirt. Got lots of compliments on it
3.0,"Might last a couple nights out, it’s really thin and feels cheap but looks like the pictures!"
3.0,Super cute but terribly overpriced for what it is. I get tons of compliments on it but even with an ice pack it does not really stay cold for that long.
3.0,Very nice but chain is very delicate and I wish the infinity symbol was bigger
3.0,These are super cute in person and my daughter loved the color and sparkles. MM is so difficult to nail down with their sizing. These fit ok in the length but we’re too wide and heavy for my child. We ended up returning out of fear she’d trip over herself a lot because of the clunkiness. Love this brand and the smell and quality of the shoes
3.0,I will be sending these back as the really run small.
3.0,"The Charm is much smaller than I expected. But, it's a beautiful piece."
3.0,It was okay looking
3.0,"cute bracelet for the price, only complaint the beads are much smaller than the picture shows. All in all, you get 2 bracelets for $4.00...good Easter basket gift"
3.0,"At first glance, these looked great. But the fabric was just a tiny bit too shiny, not stretchy enough. I  also hated the band at the waist, with that elastic rubber band in the front, ugh, so uncomfortable. The ankles were just cut off and not surged--not sure if this is a design of theirs or a mistake. Either way they went back."
3.0,"Pretty swim suit, but very short in the torso length. well made though"
3.0,"Not impressed, blue light blocking is more distracting than helpful, tough to keep clean."
3.0,Thin.  A bit see through but very comfy and stretchy.  Great for under a short skirt
3.0,It's not actually a scarf. It's a quality piece of satin but don't expect this to keep you warm
3.0,I loved the dress but retuned because the back was too short.
3.0,Not as silver toned as in the picture but still pretty
3.0,It looks good but it's very small and kind of cheap?  Looks good on my hat.
3.0,"Cute but it reminds me a bit too much of a maternity shirt. It sits okay just standing up but when bending over or sitting down, it billows out and looks like a baby belly. Would be great if actually pregnant.<br /><br />Other than this, the material is thick and stretchy. The olive color is nice and the length is just long enough to wear as a tunic."
3.0,The fit is good but the neckline is a bit loose
3.0,See through so you have to wear with a slip. Should be advertised as a swim cover up
3.0,"Fits well. Because I didn’t like it or the material, the seller offered to refund my money. It doesn’t have the gradient color like the picture suggests. They went ahead and refunded my money to me."
3.0,"I purchased 4 packages of 12 pairs each of the Magic Winter Gloves in the assorted colors.  48 pairs of gloves for &#34;party favors&#34; for a class I'm teaching that the subject is &#34;Warm Hands, Loving Hearts&#34;.  The gloves arrived well packaged.  Each pair is individually packaged.  I did get a big assortment of different colors, many that aren't shown here, but over half are black gloves.  No white gloves.<br /><br />A few pairs of the gloves have &#34;runs&#34; in the material or snags.  Also, there are some that are extremely small, like child's size gloves.  I'm female with small hands and the pairs that are extremely small don't fit me.<br /><br />With the exception of the pairs that have flaws in the material and the extremely small gloves, the remaining gloves are fairly good quality and stretchy to fit as needed."
3.0,"I usually wear US Size 10. But when I got this, it was loose for me. I returned this boot and ordered size 9. My new order didn't even ship even the final estimated date. So I ended up cancelling the order. Shoe as such looks good and was comfortable."
3.0,Overall pretty good.  The sleeves were a bit snug though.
3.0,"The pads should be more size appropriate to the product. If they improved that feature it’d be great. It’s comfy but on some clothing you can see the pad outline, which I don’t like."
3.0,"Works. Don’t expect more than $12 worth of watch. Alarm works, and that is worth $10 by itself. Don’t worry that only a child could read it, or that the light illuminates only the first digit in the best of circumstances, or that the stopwatch loops to zero after an hour. Why would anyone complain about a $12 watch?"
3.0,"love the color. love the IDEA of this dress. im 5'7 180LBS, curvy. if this dress was a little LONGER length wise, it would have been perfect."
3.0,but too small.  gave them to my kiddo.
3.0,If you have a kangaroo pouch from pregnancies go a size larger
3.0,"First of all, I ordered a YOUTH large, and received a shirt large enough for me to wear comfortably (I am a tall, average build adult woman). Secondly, I assumed this was a t-shirt, and was going to be cotton, but what arrived was a very silky, shiny shirt. It was not at all what I expected, but thankfully, my son still wanted to keep it. He'll be swimming in it (figuratively speaking)."
3.0,Little big. Most of them fit all the way on my fingers.
3.0,"very expensive for the type of product that is, the corners are not leather and the fabric is not very good, you can get a good strap for the price of this."
3.0,"Ok, had to rig it because my son's acoustic doesn't have the additional thing to hook it into"
3.0,"Great style, very cheap quality. I bought them more as a joke than to really protect my eyes from the sun."
3.0,It's a little long for my taste and didn't like the fabric
3.0,The colors aren't as bright as shown in the picture.
3.0,small in bust area
3.0,"The backs screw on, and are difficult to thread on a squirmy toddler. She also managed to loose a back within the first week."
3.0,Chain broke so easily
3.0,Everything you would expect from a $20 pr of slippers. Materials are of fair quality fit is good but a little on the snug side. Comfortable but my thread has already torn at the V on the inside of the shoe. Have to pick up some heavy thread to stich it back. Over all not to bad for an in-expensive slipper.
3.0,This key chain is durable. To make it a 5 stars the leather should be more soft & pliable instead rough and stiff.
3.0,"Worked fine for a few days until the zipper caught on the seam right at the neck. I just could not get out of it. The zipper just broke at that point when I tried to unzip. The quality is just bad. I was happy when I was making the purchase because this is cheaper than most name brands out there, but I found that the reason is quality.<br /><br />Update: they got in touch with me and offered a new piece or a refund. I very much appreciate the good customer service. I still think this is good value for money if you don't want to splurge on a Patagonia."
3.0,I finally got around to using them and they were bent. Im not sure what to do in this situation. I passed the return date window. But they made my friend and I nauseous and they weren’t like the black ones in the same brand. I’ll likely have to order a new pair but the black ones.
3.0,"I purchased these for my husband - an essential worker - however, they are way way too tight for an adult man.  In fact, they are tight on me.  Maybe my 10 year old grandson?  I am not sure what we will do with these..."
3.0,"I purchased two pairs one brown one black. I live in a fairly mild climate here in California but some mornings I have need for gloves. The black pair gloves after about 10 uses the stitching started to fall out of one of the fingers. I ordered them November 28, 2019.I certainly thought they would’ve lasted longer"
3.0,"The shoes are cute -- but seem to run small.  Also, they don't seem to offer much support, so would be better as dress shoes than everyday/preschool shoes.  But when does a three-year-old need a dedicated dress shoe?"
3.0,"Pants fit great, just as I expected. Only problem is buttons on the pockets started popping off after the second time I wore them. Lost two buttons. Now the pockets won't close."
3.0,My sister loved it and put it on as soon as I gave it to her.
3.0,"I liked, however the initial necklace around the neck is plastic.<br />Can still be rocked with a nice outfit; for the trendy at heart."
3.0,I've purchased these same leggings at Marshalls and really like them. When I found them on Amazon for a few dollars cheaper I thought I'd try them out. Only problem is the elastic stretched out in the waist the first time I put them on.
3.0,Wasn't expecting much for the price but I wore a few of these three times in a week and they already started to tarnish. Not surprised but thought they would last more than a week!
3.0,"Had a kink in the front brim and was a little out of shape due to the packing..  Hubby worked on it.  Got it to correct shape, except can't get the kink out of the front.  I like the style and the chin strap for windy days"
3.0,Fall off
3.0,Hay que pedir una talla menos
3.0,Stylish but smaller fit...thin material
3.0,they are cute just not what I was honestly expecting
3.0,"Was very small, but pretty. I gave it as a gift."
3.0,Earrings are very light and cute. I ordered the 5 pair bunch but got 4.5 earrings. Missing one earring. Also the .5 is a repeat of the yellow tone.
3.0,"It is really nice! The work and everything look amazing but it is too small, barely fits over my head and the necklace had some pointy parts which could hurt when once worn."
3.0,I am usually a small so I got a medium knowing it runs small but even the medium was way to small. I needed it for Halloween so I had to make do but be warned it runs very small if you are a small I’d get a large.
3.0,Pretty and pretty cheaply made...
3.0,"I ordered the tank in teal. In the photo it's very light but it's actually much darker. It doesn't even come close to the picture.  Otherwise,  really good quality. I ordered several colors."
3.0,Size 10 is not true to size
3.0,Wasnt what i expected and didnt work they way i needed it to
3.0,"I know this is an amazing tech suit, have seen enough swimmers wearing it and know many that recommend. I also know that tech suits are very hard to get on and must fit VERY snug/ tight. I also know it takes a lot of time and effort to get it on. That being said... i ordered this suit according to Speedo's size chart for the LZR Racer X. I ordered a 22 for my daughter. She has 34&#34; hips, is 5'2, overall small but curvy in the hips. She wears a size 20 in the Speedo Aquablade. We tried a few times to get this suit on but there was NO WAY we were gonna get it over her hips. And yes we gave it sufficient time to get on. We watched several videos on how to put it on, and she got many tips from fellow teammates. We expected it to be hard. We have been in enough dressing rooms at competitions to see how girls struggle to get these suits on. But this suit was NOT getting over her hips without damaging/ tearing the suit. I think if your swimmer is not curvy, more straight up and down, this suit will work. We will go to local swim shop and try on some other suits that may be better suited for her body type. I only give this 3 stars bc of sizing. The price online for this is amazing tho. If you are confident in your size, dont pass this up! You wont find a price like this in your swim shop."
3.0,A lot of different ones but no nose studs and that's what I initially bought it for. I know it's a variety but was hoping it'd had at least one of each or something.
3.0,I really liked the design of this ring. I thought I would be able to wear it but it is so snug on your finger and it's hard to pull it to get it to open. My fingers are pretty slim (ring finger size 8) so I am sad that I will be giving this to my niece to wear.
3.0,"Not, at all what I expected, just ok"
3.0,The inner lining was not what I thought it should be.
3.0,LOVE THE STYLE... BUT THEY WERE LITERALLY FALLING OFF AS THEY WERE TOO LARGE. NOT GOOD AND A BIT AWKWARD FOR SKINNY JEANS.
3.0,Hard to open and doesn’t work great with Pandora
3.0,"Inexpensive, get what you pay for, but worked for Halloween"
3.0,It lasted a day however my kid loves it
3.0,Fits smaller then expected
3.0,"Like the other reviews, it is soooo much darker than the picture shows. I got it for my son for Christmas. He thought it was nice, (course, what are you going to tell your mom as a Christmas present). The picture just needs to be truer."
3.0,bought for grand daughters
3.0,It is beautiful shoulder bag but unfortunately the zipper broke and now it is a little difficult to zip and unzip my bag .
3.0,the brown is not so nice
3.0,"This is  not what I expected.  It is thin and cheap looking.  I thought it would be longer than it is, based on the pictures.  Nothing cozy about it.  I am just disappointed."
3.0,it is quite a bit smaller than expected. I thought it would be the size of about a half dollar and it's Definitely the size of a quarter.
3.0,"I am 5'3""- 135 lbs and a 36C. A small fit me perfectly but I was disappointed that the bottom of the dress was really flat and kind of frumpy."
3.0,Too small for my hands
3.0,These are cute keychains only downside is the box it comes in arrived damaged thankfully the keychain wasn't
3.0,A bit cheap material but thats ok it for a gimmick.
3.0,Much smaller than realized
3.0,I do NOT like how you have to put your cards inside. The design should have taken that into consideration. Otherwise size and color is great
3.0,"I ordered the black one and received a kind of purple one. I lucked out, my kid liked it better."
3.0,"They're nice enough looking and I love the variety of colors they come in BUT once I filled in all the info and put the card back, the security flap does not lay flat.  I even tried tucking it into the holder but that was no help. So it went from being something that I thought would be secure to being something anyone looking at it could get my info from. I wouldn't order these again."
3.0,The shingles keep fallin off!
3.0,It’s okay for price
3.0,Like the look; hate the polling that occurred almost immediately.<br /><br />Wear it for casual look.
3.0,I wear a med normally so I ordered a large per recommendations. Arm openings were still too tight and I just didn't like the way it hung on me. I am sending it back.
3.0,I liked it but the material is cheap.
3.0,"it was delivered as promised ,but it was to small"
3.0,"I purchased this ear headband to match a Rapunzel shirt I have and they are so pretty and exactly what I wanted but they are very flimsy and hard to keep on my head. I have to wear barrettes to hold them on. They might be better for a child I don't know if the'd stay on better or not. The ears are fine, the actual headband is thin and small."
3.0,The color is completely different color.  Very disappointing. Its more of an army green nothing like the picture or description.
3.0,It was really cute but it kept cutting into the sides of my face. Would work better for someone with a narrower face.
3.0,"This outfit looks nice and washes well but seems to run small.  Also, the seam of the shorts began to come apart the first time my son wore them"
3.0,"I usually fit 34b and read the reviews and went on a lim and got 34b. It looks great but the cups are too big and the band fits okay, not snug like it should be :( going to try to exchange it for a smaller size."
3.0,"This skirt is so tiny. I'm a size 10 generally, and while I can get this skirt on because it's stretchy, it's very tight and digs into my hips, giving me major fat rolls. It's so unflattering. Also, it's very short (it does have the shorts underneath but still). I feel like it's meant more for smaller girls (probably size 6 and below) despite the 'one size fits all' claim."
3.0,"Se bajan un poco, pero me Han ayudado para El invierno porque son suaves y calientitas.. lo unico que una de Ella's ya tiene in hueco abajo entre Las piernas"
3.0,"This swimming suit has a cute pattern, but it is somehow wrongly design in the area just below the breast. I had to fixed it with my sewing machine in order to make it fit properly. If you are a petit person, is not a good choice."
3.0,No guardan el calor y la talla no es muy especifica me quedaron grandes
3.0,"Given the price it's hard to complain, but I would've been willing to pay more for a better quality dress. I really liked the overall design of the dress and it fit fairly well, especially since I'm only 5' 3&#34;. The fabric that's at the waist really cheapens the dress and it actually sat up higher on me than I expected (above my waist) so a heads up to anyone who's tall. Had I kept it I was going to look for a belt to cover the fabric at the waist - which would've had to have been rather wide to hide that fabric and still hit my waist."
3.0,"The top is very low cut.  So while the shorts and flowy top is nice and discreet and appropriate to wear at the gym pool...the plunging neckline is crazy low so I wear it only if I gave to or I pin it close. The shorts roll up on my legs and inner thigh. ( I'm 5'4 157lbs, 34c)"
3.0,Wish it was another 12&#34; longer - a bit to short.
3.0,Got what I paid for 😞
3.0,"This helmet liner fits like a really tight shower cap. There is an elastic stretch band that goes around the bottom exactly like a shower cap does. It is extremely tight, and to use I had to cut in a few places to ease the tension. I would have returned, but needed to use immediately."
3.0,"Overall good quality, but the face is small. Is looks tiny on a grown adult. I bought to use as an inexpensive mask that would have a lasting value and ultimately just use it as a hat. I ended up making a mask instead."
3.0,I ordered a medium and it was way too big.  I tried to alter it to no avail. have always ordered medium for Eileen west nightgowns so I don’t know what happened. I would appreciate it if you could send me a size small at no cost to me.  I can’t return the medium because my alteration ruined it.
3.0,"The bras themselves are great, but they run very small. I wear a C cup and ended up giving them to my best friend who is a small B. She's happy with them though!"
3.0,Cute but as soon as I tried to put it on the pin detached.  So disappointed!!!
3.0,"The blouse fits a bit small.  It also feels a bit scratchy against the skin, and will certainly have to be ironed before wearing.  Even after washing the blouse there were deep creases in the material from being packaged.  Perhaps after ironing it for the first time, and giving it another washing those creases will not reappear.  But I have not tried that yet."
3.0,Lovely dress...fit perfectly! Too bad I can't wear it. It shows a belt in the picture. I received NO belt and there are belt loops on the dress!
3.0,"For the most part this boot seems to be ok for this price point. I ordered the exact size I wear in other boots and these are too small. I wear an 11 and they fit more like a short 10. So, if you order these, make sure you order .5 or a fill size bigger than what you normally wear. The construction is decent for the $$, but the tops are not made for ankle support. The zipper on the side is convenient, but the snap that covers the zipper clinks when you walk. I am returning them for a different boot."
3.0,The chest area is too small
3.0,It’s a little smaller than I hoped for since I bought it for work. It hits my mid thigh & I am 5’7. I love the plum purpley color I got- but wish it hit right above or at the knee!
3.0,Recieved this yesterday .. I decided to check it out before wrapping it for Christmas...its a pretty noticeable notch..can this be exchanged..?
3.0,"Well designed and pretty, but extremely little. I went by the photos and not the description details. It was my mistake."
3.0,"The fabric of the black sweater is not the same weight or quality of the other three sweaters I purchased from this brand. The medium, which is normally perfectly oversized w/o being sloppy, was snug and hit at exactly my waist. The others fall at the hip area. Sadly, I had to send the black one back."
3.0,"Pants good size; fit well. Keeper.<br /><br />However: I had to cut and remove the built-in belt. Big problem trying to latch/unlatch the hook. Difficult.<br /><br />Removed it completely without wrecking the pants, and now using a plastic clip-style belt."
3.0,"I was so excited to get this suit today, but my excitement soon turned to disappointment.  I am 5'1 and approx. 175 lbs with a short torso and 38DD  breasts.  After reading the reviews, I purchased the size 48 (XL) hoping it would fit my body type.  This suit is made for someone with a longer torso and smaller breasts. Unfortunately, I have to return it."
3.0,"Hat is nice, but was stuffed in box instead of packed.  The ribbon in the front was folded over and creased, and the brim on one side is warped from the positioning in the box.  May straighten out after &#34;airing out&#34; but will have to try to iron it, otherwise.<br />3 stars"
3.0,"I am a big guy 6' and 330lbs.  I recently lost over 70lbs so my undershirts where too big for me. I went down to a 3x.  These shirts are tighter than regular shirts but its meant to hug you.  They are very comfortable for long time use.  If you suffer from man boobs, these will help reduce the look.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 3 out of 5 is the stitching was already coming loose from the seams only after 2 washes.  Other than that, these are are 5 plus shirt"
3.0,"They are too tight around at the top, making them very uncomfortable.Took them off after about ten minutes."
3.0,"Wouldn't buy again, even if inexpensive"
3.0,Bought for my 7 year old son but way to big.
3.0,"Glasses worked amazing for two days, then suddenly would flash red when turned completely off. As you can see above, I used to be able to set both lens to be pure white. That is no longer the case, white isn’t an existing color in the left button anymore. Only red. Kind of disappointed. Found that it’s also not worth looking into a replacement pair because everyone seems to be getting defective pairs.<br /><br />EDIT: Pulled the ends of them apart and did some “remodeling,” now they work fine. BUT if you set them down too hard they go into flashing mode. Kind of annoying."
3.0,"Bonito pero no me gusto la calidad,  y además muy largo."
3.0,The muff was pretty but the strap to go over her neck was actually a shoe lace.  Not what I expected.
3.0,The bag itself is nice however I thought it would be more adjustable than what it is. Though it is probably supposed to only go around waist I figured it would accommodate going around torso as well from a picture another reviewer posted. I'm not a huge guy (roughly 5'10 200lbs). So if you're slim you should be able to fit around torso if you want.
3.0,"So much smaller than picture they show.  Very cheaply made, but at least another layer of protection.  Made in China......I thought when I ordered it was made in USA"
3.0,Nice gloves. Nice fit just not what I had in mind.
3.0,"bought for a gift, looked large but she kept them"
3.0,"I mean, for the price... I guess six months is some time. I was just disappointed for it to break. I wore it almost daily during the week during that time. broke at the area that clips onto the watch"
3.0,"No where near as thick knit as depicted in the picture.  Very lightweight yarn. No at all like the textured, snuggly sweater in the photo."
3.0,"They're okay, they say crew socks but they are really ankle socks."
3.0,"Wonderful color nice rounded top shape, but way too large on the bottom for me. I'm short and on the fat side, the extra fabric at the bottom is not flattering on my figure. I need to aim for a straighter cut."
3.0,"Love the pants. They just got me too loose. Measurement: size S, Ht. 5’6, Bust 34D, Wt. 118"
3.0,smaller and tighter than expected
3.0,The adjustment strap is too short
3.0,"Was told to get a size up and it’s more like two sizes. Bra completely hangs out, this shirt is for putting over a bathing suit. Obviously I expected it to fit like the picture! Disappointed but it is very soft."
3.0,"I bought these for the pocket space for working outside. The stitching started coming apart within a week, and things in my pockets started pulling all the stitching apart, leaving a tangle of white string in pockets. I don’t recommend them for outdoor work, but they were the only shorts I could find with a lot of pockets. It’s also not a typical strong cargo pants material."
3.0,"I really liked these earrings, but they are SOO small -  it's so hard to make out exactly what the photo is in the earrings.  I have a friend with a black cat with same color eyes, so it's purrr-fect for her (pun intended).  It's just a lot smaller than you would think from the photo."
3.0,These are very cute but aren't holding up too well. The finish is already rubbing off the shoes after a couple days of wear.
3.0,Difficult to change lenses without a screwdriver.  No instructions enclosed with package
3.0,This product did was super small and super short so i retuned it.
3.0,"was given as a gift, she liked it"
3.0,"I want to like this cause style is cute. But it loses it shape so to speak and bottom belt part sags. Just not very well made or it’s the fabric. I will say, I still wear it anyway haha"
3.0,fit smaller than expected.
3.0,"Well I liked the slippers, they are nice but here are my comments:<br /><br />- I'm a 7 / 6,5 food size and they run kind of small.<br />- As others have said they heat too hot. I knew that they didn't have any control but feels like it keeps warming and warmig. You need to disconnect them or take your feet off. So they are not practical at all because while you are working at your computer or doing whatever with these slippers you need to stop because your soles are burning if you don't mind taking in and off your feet the product it's ok however I don't have a real winter in my country so if you are looking something for those 5 degrees / -0<br />I think it's not a good purchase.<br /><br />-I bought them in July, so far they still working (eventhough the USB makes some weird sounds sometimes)<br /><br />I like the design and well let's be honest the price is great! so not much to say about."
3.0,Cute but the gloves tore up the same day my daughter wore them!<br />Such a disappointment.
3.0,"I think this bracelet is such a cool and dainty design however after wearing them three times, they are tarnishing. So disappointed,  I was hoping they would last longer. I contacted the seer because they sent m a wrong item and it arrived quickly, the customer care was fantastic.<br /><br />Disappointed"
3.0,"I love these shirts, but the Men's 1X fits like a Medium?"
3.0,High waters.. I am 5'6 125 pounds ordered a small
3.0,Nice fit but the material makes you sweaty
3.0,"This too is pretty, but the material is like polyester and a oittle cheap looking. It is a little bigger than expected!"
3.0,I liked it and not see thru but horrible camel toe
3.0,It works better on some shoes then it does on others.
3.0,They fit but you couldn't see the wood grain really at all.
3.0,"The customer servuce was fine, however,  the shoes were much too large. I returned them."
3.0,La tela no textura de la tela no es la más agradable pero le da buena caída a la falda
3.0,I like this I got it over sized to wear with leggings not a thick sweatshirt
3.0,The colors don't look anything like what I was expecting. Much more of the light coral color than shows in the picture.
3.0,Loose size but beautiful I liked it
3.0,"The shoe fits somewhat narrow.  My pinky toe felt squished by the end of the day.  Also the seem was uncomfortable.  Initially the shoe felt comfortable, but by the ens of the day my feet were hurting."
3.0,Felt like the crotch was too short. They kept riding up in the front
3.0,"so cute & comfy for a heel, a few strings have come loose around the buckle part after only wearing once so not the highest quality but a great price & love the color!"
3.0,"I didn’t even try to get these on. I laid them out alongside brands that I currently wear, and these were easily 2 inches smaller, although marked as the same (medium/32-34)"
3.0,"Beautiful robe, but after the first gentle wash it started falling apart, very disappointed!"
3.0,This hat is really big and made of thin material.
3.0,3 stars because of slow shipping. Product was as advertised. Seems to be high quality
3.0,They are a little bigger than what i wanted but still work well
3.0,"Not suitable for a c or d cup..changing the bra, otherwise pretty and good material"
3.0,I love the feel of the coat but it's not warm as I had imagined. But for the price I'm happy. Umm I got a large and the coat is large but it's tight right by armpits and make shoulders look bulky
3.0,Works great and provides excellent compression. Only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because if you use any oil based moisturizer in your hair it stains and if you have colored hair the color transfers.
3.0,"Undersize garment, so didn't fit and I had to pay return shipping. Looked ok, though, as a product."
3.0,I purchased a few watches from this seller & love the watches but the battery life isn’t long after you receive & wear them. But still really funky cool watch.
3.0,Fit well but a light material
3.0,I have worn rag socks for many winters. I've had to darn a few of them but they are sturdy and thick. That's not the case with these boot socks. These socks are pretty but they are very thin and do not offer much warmth. They are also a tad big and they wrinkle under my foot when putting on my boots. (I wear an 8.5 - 9 boot.) I hope the socks will shrink. If you are a fan of slouch socks these will work for you. They don't stay up and my boots seem to pull them down. These socks would be great with my summer hiking boots.
3.0,Little small around head to fit on ears.
3.0,These are a little hard to use.  Would be best if index finger was able to grip and pick up weeds.
3.0,The product was everywhere in the box. Half of them didn't even have there own bags and none of the bags were labeled. So unless you have been stretching your ears for a while and know alot about it find the size you need is like looking for a needle in a hay stack.
3.0,Covers nose
3.0,"Forgive the creepy picture. As you can see, the gauge is too long, making this nose screw way too loose and constantly looking like this. I have a fairly thick nostril, so I honestly don't know who this would fit. Really disappointed because I absolutely love the color. This company really needs to offer this in gauge sizes smaller than 20."
3.0,Product runs small. Quality not too good
3.0,"Cute dress, bad fit"
3.0,"The fabric was a bit thin but otherwise the quality of the skirt was good EXCEPT the cut-in on the front looked like it was stretched open or cut in a wide ""V"" that was not very attractive.  The skirt fit properly in the waist and hips but the opening made it look like the skirt was stretched beyond its design - both on and off.  Quite honestly, the length was good, the fit was good but the way that slit was cut made me feel fat. A slight flap-over of the sides of the cut would look nicer. I returned the skirt."
3.0,"Thought this was a better quality materials, like others I had bought from this seller. Not so and the color lacks luster also, and I am disappointed."
3.0,"Great bag. Has pockets in all the right places. I bought the navy blue about a year ago. The color is amazing. I received compliments on it wherever I went. Unfortunately, the outside laptop zipper broke about 6 months into my using it so the construction leaves something to be desired. Having said that I have missed the bag so much I was going to buy another blue bag but they no longer sell it. So disappointed but I think I'll give the black one a go. I'll check back in to advise on how the zipper holds up this time"
3.0,Stiff and wrinkles easy
3.0,is that earring were beautiful. but was missing stones they were not even in the little baggy so I could try to fix myself...not happy!!!!!!
3.0,Good weight and good fit.  Wish the exact belt was in silvertone.  I wear this with ankle pants and a tunic and get compliments on the look every time.
3.0,"Pants run bigger that normal; order a size smaller than you usually would. Quality, is lightweight and okay."
3.0,"Somehow, this watch just feels cheap to me. The bezel is extremely chincy (cant tell if its plastic or not, clicks feel like a broken toy or something) and the finish looks spray painted. For the money I paid, i could have gotten a nice Seiko. The spring bars are so close to the body, that most of my nato bands won't fit it... weird. The finish on the body is not even. It's just cheap! I'm keeping it for the collection, but I really can't wear it in public. For 80 bucks maybe, for 250, keep looking."
3.0,Cute but it was not flattering on my chest. 38D I just didn't like how it looked on me. the length was also an issue. At 5'2 it was a little longer than I had liked
3.0,I think the vest is easy to wear and sort of warm.  I am in a dialysis center for three days a week.  Because of the machines they don’t change the temp. As soon as the sun goes down the temp drops 20 degrees  The jacket comes in handy.  Thank you
3.0,Received the khaki colored shirt. Very soft and vintaged. I usually wear a lg-xl because I like my shirts big. I ordered a XL  and was way too big in the v neck and also the sides. Will probably return and get a large.
3.0,Showed up a week later and smelled like somones super strong BO. Super disgusting to get a shirt that somone obviously wore and returned and was repacked. The Weird veclcro patch is unnecessary unless this was ment to be a secuirty unifrom.
3.0,I love these...unfortunately they easily tear at the big toe. Wore a pair once and came home with a hole in my toe.  Two pair have done this so far.
3.0,I ordered a small youth shirt. .  The size chart said it would fit like a 7-8. It is more like a 10-12.  It is going to be way too large for my granddaughter.  The shirt is very nice but sized wrong.
3.0,They just don’t look that great once you put them on.
3.0,"Waist gaps. Pants quickly lose overall elasticity. I have to pull them up every few minutes. Wish they fit correctly because other than than that I really like them. For reference I’m 5,4” 125 lbs, very athletic/muscular build. Bought the smallest size. My search for the perfect gym pants continues."
3.0,"I ordered based on my measurements. The dress was way too big and the apron was way too small. It's almost like they gathered pieces from two completely different sizes and disregarded their measurement description. Also, this outfit smelt extremely terrible upon arrival. I had to let the fabric soak for hours to get the terrible smell out. There is no proper way to fasten the bow to the dress,, so this was a huge let down. At the end of the day, I would suggest spending a few more dollars and ordering this from a more trusted vendor. It did what it needed to but at the expense of comfort and quality. Considering the price I would have expected something of a medium quality, and this was not it."
3.0,"This hat is tight, even on my little head. It is also super warm. It'll be great for winter, but really too warm for the fall. The sound quality is good and I like that there's a voice that tells me it's time to charge it. I would've given it four stars, but after a month or so of wear the stitches around the charging part have begun to unravel. I can fix it with a crochet hook and some thread, but I shouldn't have to."
3.0,I really like the stones but the posts were hard to get the backs on so they weren't very comfortable otherwise they were up just okay.
3.0,"Most of mine worked, the rest did not turn on at all or they were extremely dim. I also am not sure how to replace the batteries on these without breaking them, so I can’t even attempt to try to fix the ones that came broken.<br /><br />My kids loved these. We used them yesterday for “Flashlight Friday” at school."
3.0,The fit is great. The black thread is fraying a bit now that I'm washing them.
3.0,"Great Hoodie, had one just like it for years and wanted some new colors. Fits slightly baggy, but nothing to complain about. My first hoodie has shrunk a maybe an inch on the sleeves and a bit on the hood. If you don't want this to shrink just let it air dry or dry it on low.<br />For $15 it's a great deal.<br />UPDATE: I have washed this hoodie a few times and now it doesn't fit quite right. The hood has shrunk a bit, but only length wise, not width. I like to wear a hat under my hood which I've done for the past 5+ years with my previous hoodie and I've had no problems. The newer ones seem to have a slightly altered fit which also makes them bunch up around the pocket area. Normally I wouldn't care about these things, but having an older hoodie from the same company shows me they have changed in fit and quality a bit over the years. The old hoodie I have from them was made in Mexico and the new ones are made in Honduras...Not sure if that has something to do with it.<br />If you don't have an older hoodie from this company I doubt you'll care about the differences though. It is still good material and a decent fit for the price."
3.0,Cute but was too tight
3.0,"The socks are nice, but they look nothing like the colors shown."
3.0,"clasp works well, but it gets caught and pulled the bracelet apart."
3.0,These sunglasses fit my frames really well but I didn't receive the color/style I ordered
3.0,"The material was a little disappointing.  I feel like you can go to any store nowadays and get a $20ish sundress with much better quality.  Fit my chest but was a little big around my waist.  I will probably wear it as a last resort but on a 10 day trip to Mexico, I tried it on once, choose a different dress and left it in the closet for the remainder of the vacation."
3.0,The shirt felt good but it ran small.
3.0,I'm a grandmaw to a 13 month old boy who has the cutest chubby cheeks and legs!  Are there sizes or one size fits all?  He loves onsies and hates pants so after readings these  reviews I thought these would be great. He is walking but he is loving playing on the ground with toys so I'm not sure if these would make it to easy to slip.  Any comments from parents who have bought these.  Thank you!
3.0,They’re super cute but the lenses pop out CONSTANTLY. It’s frustrating.
3.0,Looks like it should fit.  Will find out Christmas morning.
3.0,"Handmade but a bit overpriced, I think."
3.0,its pretty but brakes easily
3.0,"Very cute design, fabric is more thin than I expected"
3.0,kind of large but ok.
3.0,Not as soft and plush but doable.
3.0,"Too bad it was too small to fit me.  It's cute though.  I wear a 34 C.  I ordered a 34 C but it did not fit me.  you might want to order a size up.<br />Instead of return it, I am giving it away."
3.0,Vary happy with my handbag but it is too small.
3.0,"Very light- can hardly remember I have earrings on. Unexpected style with a pearl on the front of the ear, and the “lace” on the back. If they get snagged on something I’m in trouble, but for now I’m getting compliments! I like the length, and it’s pure white."
3.0,"This is not pink, more of a salmon/coral color."
3.0,Image appears on front and back which is cool but the bottoms are huge. Way way too big. Will have to pair with another bottom.
3.0,"Purchased for my son and daughter. I ordered the size they currently wear and they're too big. Not true to size! I wanted them for wearing this year, but I doubt they fit until next year."
3.0,Washed this once and has holes all in it now
3.0,I was a little small
3.0,It was so stunning and beautiful and then ....broke after one use. I was even being so incredibly careful with it. I may try and figure out something to do with my &#34;pieces&#34; left from this. I guess it's a show piece. wear it once and then broken. Quality must not be a concern when they  made it.
3.0,It was a cute jumpsuit but it was cut too small.  Shipping was fast. The material was soft and stretchy but even with that the jumpsuit just wasn't a good fit.  The sizing was too far off.
3.0,Posts too long......hang out of my ear
3.0,"I'm pretty sure this is what gave me a belly infection. Granted, I did have this on for a long time.. overtime it became too exposed to moisture and became green. Go with something better quality!"
3.0,"I wish these shoes would have fit my feet, because they are constructed well and have good arch support.  I have a narrow foot and ordered narrow width.  The shoe was much too wide in the toe box area and front of shoe.  I even checked the inside of the shoe to make sure it was indeed narrow."
3.0,"I tried to be careful to see that it had a zipper, but it did not, Fine if that is what you want , is a good sweatshirt"
3.0,Length is too long and general fit is too loose.
3.0,The shoe was very comfortable and great but the size are bigger then normal shoes of same size.
3.0,Just another pair earrings.  They're serve the purpose.
3.0,The arms are a bit short and pretty tight on my husband. The rest of the shirt was somewhat baggy. I got a size bigger than normal.
3.0,"Don't believe the images of amazing, colorful shine - it's gray and barely iridescent, at least to the human eye. Crazy part: Unaltered photos of the bag in the right light are actually colorful, however only when viewed through the device. (In the pictures here, the bag looked gray and unlit in person, even though the photo in sunlight looks colorful.) The bag structure is floppy and caves in on itself when empty. To its credit, however, it seems to be made of sturdy material and is well-stitched with smooth seams, plenty of zippered and easy-access pockets inside, and a good size for carrying a few essentials."
3.0,I love this dress. It is one of my favorites just because it's super comfortable and the print is very pretty. It gets only 3 stars because it's cheaply made. I have to keep sewing up holes that randomly appears at the seams. This is my only problem with the dress. I did get it for about $6 so what was I expecting? It is also very thin material so I would suggest anyone who decides to buy it to buy a slip so you can't see through it.
3.0,Its the perfect color but its too small. Theres just a small piece of lace and it doesn't come over my eyes.
3.0,"I do not know if it was me or not, but I was disappointed. I thought it was white but it's cream colored. It made me feel like it was dirty. However, I bought it for my Mom and she really likes it.  It has lots of bead work as it says.  I may just not have read the description and probably bought it from the picture which looks white."
3.0,"These run very large. They gap around my daughter's belly quite a bit. We bought in her usual size. Too bad, they're super cute."
3.0,These are made of cheap black shiny plastic that seem like it will break fairly easily but what can you get for this price really.
3.0,The shoes is lovely but small and narrow
3.0,"The sweater was cute,  but the sizing wasn't accurate..."
3.0,Needed it for an event and it worked…not sure about everyday use.  Colors not as vivid as photo and Velcro clasp is of concern.
3.0,It works out fine but it is not as pictured. Does not cut down in the back like in the pic and is very long. It served uts purpose but not what I was expecting.
3.0,"My 5 year old was so excited when these arrived. They are very cute shoes but, I can't say how well they will hold up, because they've only been worn once. She got the worst blisters (even through socks) and hasn't worn them again. When I suggest she wear them for short periods of time to ""break them in"" she says she is scared it will hurt."
3.0,"Made in China, so it's not high end, but they suffice."
3.0,"This is a pretty bracelet, and I like it, but I don't love it.<br /><br />The pluses:  it is as represented.  I like items with the blue &#34;evil eye&#34; motif, and this is a good exemplar of that.  It has an extender built in, so it will fit people with large wrists.  I have a fairly large wrist, and it fits even without the extender, so it will work for lots of people.<br /><br />The eye itself and the sparkly crystals around it are pretty and eye-catching.<br /><br />The center motif is kind of thin, and the jump links attaching it to the chain are pretty big, and look slightly out of proportion.<br /><br />The worst thing about this bracelet is that the clasp is impossible to close or open by myself.  That's not so unusual in a bracelet, but even when I asked someone to help me with it, it took her several tries.<br /><br />Overall, I like this bracelet, but I won't wear it often.  It’s just too much of a hassle to put it on and take it off.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for my honest review.  I review all items as if I had paid full price for them."
3.0,"I'm kind of middle of the road with these glasses.<br />I recently started wearing contacts and was advised to use something like this for night time driving.<br />My mistake was not noticing that they were not polarized.<br />They do reduce the glare / star effect from oncoming traffic but I think I am going to have to find a polarized version.<br /><br />They are well made, nice quality. I actually purchased 2 pairs, one for each car."
3.0,Material is way to thin. Was looking more for a thicker material but this shows every bump.
3.0,"This bag slips around too much when I'm wearing it. Does not stay in position on the cross shoulder. It does hold what I need though, so I kept it anyway."
3.0,"This is a basic, authentic-looking Chinese-style shirt ideal for meditation, exercise, and generally looking good as a cover-up on a warm day. The sewing is excellent, and the material is very good. The downside to this shirt is that it's quite snug for a medium men's shirt. I'll need to wear it open over a t-shirt when I do choose to wear it."
3.0,longer than pictured but fits ok
3.0,These are not that impressive for the price being charged. They are cheap yellow color and feel like costume jewellery. When you hold these in hand they don't feel that good.
3.0,"Stylish workout shirt, but not tight. I'm a big guy. I'm 5'10"" and 300 lbs. The XXL is comfortably tight. No compression. I'll wear it as an undershirt, but kind of disappointed."
3.0,"As reflected by the price, to call this a &#34;Bridesmaids dress&#34; is ridiculous. However, it is a very comfortable cotton-blend dress. I purchased it to make into a Halloween costume, and I couldn't have been happier."
3.0,"Good for the price, it does look cheap"
3.0,These arrived with no pads.  I sized up because other reviewers had commented on sizing.  My daughter normally wears a size m and the L fit her perfect.  Support is lacking for a bra that lists running as one of its uses.<br /><br />This is a fine lounge/day bra.  Sports??  PERHAPS gentle yoga?  Cycling? -  Not appropriate for any sort of 'bouncing' activity.
3.0,"I like the dress, I ordered it pink according to the picture it was light pink but when it came it was more like soft peach"
3.0,A bit smaller than expected...fair purchase.
3.0,The little crystals came off and feather started fading some how
3.0,"I really like these jeans, they are comfortable,I was so excited to get them. Sadly the zipper on them doesn't work right. I am not sure how to even fix it.  Once it's down it's down and it's really tricky to get back up. I hate to send them back because because what it the next pair is the same. I like the way they fit and the<br />feel of them."
3.0,"I think it is a cute design and cut for a dress.  The issue is the material, it is a silky jersey knit that shows and accents your bra and panty lines even if you order a size up."
3.0,It is a nice looking pattern pants except the pocket has a hole. It was just a defect I guess
3.0,Really detailed and beautiful. Wish I would have read the reviews. The price is a bit steep for only getting a dime sized pendant. DID NOT come with a chain.
3.0,They are very comfortable and warm but way to bulky.
3.0,Okay a little thin
3.0,"As long as you working with a computer screen... and staring straight ahead through the lenses, they are ok.<br />But if look off to the side... or move your head around... then the image get blurry.<br />Need to take the glasses off if you want to move around.<br />Lenses aren't really shaped properly. But they are cheap glasses."
3.0,Sturdy construction but no drainage for use as a shower shoe.
3.0,Makes my wrist fahbulous.. :-)
3.0,"👍extra length is great, nice print"
3.0,"Great for back ups, I’ve only tried 2 so far. One was already cracked around the hole in the ball and another wouldn’t thread straight. You can probably get a few good ones out of the bunch."
3.0,I have had this belt for about two weeks now and today when I put it on this circle thing popped out I don't know what I'm going to do now but I'll just wear it and see if anything else pops out
3.0,I have to agree with the other comments they are really small... but its kute.. working in the health field its perfect for me.. im more comfortable
3.0,clothes are thin and she wore it three times and the pants ripped already i threw it away
3.0,"I love this swimsuit, it just did not fit correctly in the bust. Too big on the sides/under arms."
3.0,"As sunglasses, they are ok.  I do not notice any major change in being able to see balls easier though."
3.0,"Nice belt. Runs small, need to order 1 size up from what I normally wear."
3.0,I think this is a cute shirt but it is a little tighter across the bust than I normally wear my shirts. . So if you like your shirts loose order a larger size
3.0,It said one size but couldnt fit my 7 year old
3.0,Perfect for swim suit coverup. Wrinkles easy but comfortable
3.0,"Like the jeans, very comfortable, but way to long. Wish they had sizes for short people. I knew this when I bought them with the expectations of having to get them hemmed. Otherwise very nice."
3.0,"The watch is cheap and seems pretty reliable for daytime use, but the light button doubles as the select/reset button, so it’s a real pain to try to set the alarm in the dark and it’s impossible to use the stopwatch in the dark.<br /><br />Also, the light is not well distributed and only lights up half the screen."
3.0,"The fit was large and the dress was I’ll fitting, I did like the material and sleeve length. I end up returning the dress."
3.0,"So I ordered this and received a totally different dress. Completely different style, but same color and pattern. I kind of like it, but not the dress I ordered and not what’s listed at ALL!"
3.0,I think the sizes are not to accurate<br />Get one size smaller<br /><br />But the quality is good
3.0,"I love this dress even though it ran really big, it’s still very simple good enough for a spring or summer day around the house"
3.0,"The leather handle is nice for the money but after two weeks of daily use to lock my doors, the little nail that holds the strap together came off, I lost it and can't find a way to replace it. Will have to replace the whole wristlet to get what I need. I'll do without this one next time"
3.0,This was just okay. It wasn't a very flattering fit. It also wasn't as soft as I had hoped. I am a 36C chest and the chest in the Large was too small (the seems came up over my boobs). I returned it.
3.0,"I expected the color to be a little darker, but I think the bracelet is still beautiful! 😊"
3.0,"The dress is great but it wasn’t new like it was supposed to be. It was clearly worn before because it came unzipped, in an unmarked bag, and covered in dog hair. I don’t have time to return it because the wedding I’m going to is in 2 days. Pretty crappy that you send out dirty items."
3.0,I just got them. Pretty! But way too big! I thought they would be dainty. Not even close. Still thinking about what I am going to do with them.
3.0,Nice dress a little to short.
3.0,"these plop off my feet when i walk,  id like them had a bought a size too small possibly"
3.0,"Cute blouse, but runs small.  I bought a 3X and it is about the size of an 1X."
3.0,"Nice hat, but it was not like the picture. It had a denim Velcro chin strap. It was very small. My son's head did not fit in it, even though I ordered up a size."
3.0,It's a great design and I got so many compliments. I'm just bummed it broke only after a few months that I had it. The little metal rod that holds the leather band to the face of the watch is what broke. It bumped a shelf (not hard even) is how it broke.
3.0,I like the shirt but even for large it was not as loose as it shows in picture.
3.0,It was a gift but ran small
3.0,The sleeves area is to tight and the pockets are to high. The fabric is soft but is almost see through. I don't think is worth that much money is worth $15 but no more.
3.0,"Good cut, generous coverage, sits just at waistline, but the stitching started to unravel halfway through my 1 week vacation. Served its purpose for the trip but clearly not made to last long. Luckily it was a good price but I would not buy again."
3.0,"**UPDATE**<br />Wore this for an event I worked at the Heritage Tournament. I still love this dress, got loads of compliments BUT I was not impressed when a small hold appeared on the back seam while wearing for the first time (on the butt, exactly where the threads need to be strongest).<br /><br />Upon closer inspection, the thread on this seam is thin and not very secure at all. Luckily I was able to get hold of an emergency sewing kit, but yeah... Not cool, had to knock some stars off unfortunately.<br />*******<br />Love it, fits very well and perfect for heritage tournament. I can see why people said the material isn't very breathable (scuba material) but It's very stretchy and flattering."
3.0,"Just got this, so no comment on how comfortable or water resistant it is, yet. It seems pretty nice and has many pockets, which was one reason why we picked this. The other reason was for the rain over.  It did not come with it and I am thoroughly disappointed. This is the reason for only 3 stars."
3.0,It was really thin but the color and design are beautiful. Ran huge.
3.0,"I wanted to love this shirt, i was so excited for it to come. I got it 14 days before it said it would. However, i ordered a Medium, and received a small."
3.0,Was looking for a white and black purse. This purse is tan and black and much smaller than I expected. Not sure if I'm going to keep it or not.
3.0,"Cute shoe, but the red should be redder. Fits fairly close to size. But they are heavy to wear and I was surprise that the 3 onch heel felt so high..even with the 1 inch platform. Maybe its a matter of getting used to them. They don't feel all that stable, but they are a CUTE SHOE"
3.0,"I have a lot of hip scarfs. I ordered the small medium, I am not a tiny waited gal. It's a lot bigger than expected, never had a small fit so large."
3.0,Way too big. Might try and send back for another size
3.0,"I want to like this product. I ordered it 3 times for my husband.<br />1) arrived as vest and jacket. no pants.  returned<br />2) ordered XL.  Snug jacket, couldn't button pants.<br />3) ordered XXL. Pants falling off his butt. Jacket looks like he borrowed it from his dad.<br /><br />The overall construction is very nice, especially for the price.  We needed for two weddings this spring without breaking the bank.  But the sizing was just too weird, very disappointed.<br /><br />Husband is 6'2, 220llbs.  Wears 36 waist and XL in most brands."
3.0,"Poor quality, needs more wool. Returning it. Feels like I'm wearing a robe."
3.0,Looks more like a teenage boys shirt.
3.0,i still wear it but its not the best ive ever bought
3.0,"This is a super cute dress and I will be wearing it. It’s just a tiny bit short so I’ll be adding extra fabric at the bottom. No big deal, a lot of dresses are a little too short for me. The front part isn’t baggy (which is good, I was expecting the straps to be too long) I ordered a M and I’m 5 ft 4 in. Overall, super cute dress and decent quality."
3.0,Looks great but was a bit tight getting them on.
3.0,Cute outfit but the onesie and leggings were a bit larger than expected for a newborn size
3.0,I love this but it runs super small.  The cup size is ok but the girth is very small.  I usually wear a large and I ordered a x-large because of the reviews.  It feels like it’s squeezing me.  I only weigh 115 lbs. but I am a bodybuilder so my back may be a little wider than the normal 115 lb. person.
3.0,The panties are comfortable but the waist rolls.
3.0,It looks very cheap but it's still nice to have.  The moon stone is not the actual crystal moonstone you find in occult shops though.
3.0,Not sweatshirt material...looks very thin
3.0,"I bought this replacement umbrella cover for our deck, love the color and the material feels nice but when I went to attach it to  the pole I found out the grommeted hole at the top of the umbrella is too small to fit over the piece on top to secure it to the pole. So, in order to make it work I'm going to have to cut through the material and around the grommet that they have.<br />Wish I knew the hole was so small before purchase. Trying to decide if its worth just cutting or if I'm going to return it. Photo shows the grommet size compared to what it needs to go over."
3.0,"Cute dress. I'm not as small as the model. I'm 200lbs and 5'8&#34; and I ordered the pink one size(only choice available in pink). Even though it's listed in the size chart as being between a small and medium measurements, it fits large, but short(expected). However the shoulders are awkward amd end up not sitting on my shoulders in the right place. Possibly because I'm not super thin and top heavy. Very see through dress. Needs something additional underneath or a swimsuit. Still good buy."
3.0,I bought it just for The charm itself.. thought it was going to be a darker shade with the grading being more evident. But it still does the job as a car charm for me.
3.0,"This jacket is not a very high quality piece of clothing. One arms wrist elastic is not sewed properly, the pockets are shallow, and the zippers are low grade and hard to close without breaking. It’s perfect to stash in your car for a Quik coverup in case you are caught in a shower.<br /><br />I’m pleased to report the seller reached out and satisfied the issues."
3.0,Was to small for me.  Need a larger version for bigger faces.
3.0,"For the price point you can't beat it.  It's a thicker spandex/knit material and not see thru the way so many of them are.  It does run small, but we all seem to expect it.  I'm usually a med 8/10 and I ordered a L here.  It's pretty clingy still and some folks might not like that.<br /><br />The color is not a royal blue by any stretch of the imagination.  It's very much a blue-green color.  Very similar to the mallard blue VS had many years ago.<br /><br />Over all a nice enough dress and not a bad buy."
3.0,I like the weight of the robe. Wished it were longer.
3.0,My daughter wears a size 0/00 and they were about 2 sizes too big. She’s 5’2” 98lbs.
3.0,Cute design; I wear size 10-12 ordered XL.  I look like a sausage.  Return freight too high vs cost of shirt.
3.0,I like it because of the amount of card slots it has but it's difficult for me to get my ID card out of the slot. Other than that love it so far.
3.0,Unraveled and snagged easily unlike other elastic bands I have had..
3.0,The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because of me not the sweater/shrug.  It looks better on the hanger than it does on me.  It seems &#34;frillier&#34; in person.  I am not a frilly kind of girl.
3.0,Very pretty but the chain is too small.
3.0,Must get help to put on outfit. There is a zipper in the back that is hard to do by yourself
3.0,Picture is accurate but runs small.
3.0,item was a little too big for my petite hands so alterations had to be made. very cute though
3.0,Smaller than expected. I was unable to even zip it up and i tend to be a medium normally
3.0,"So for 45$ bucks (and that's a lot for a piece of clothing in my opinion) you get a cardigan that looks like a freakin' Tardis!  That is AWESOME!  The quality of the shirt?... Not so much.  It seems thin and frail, as in if I washed it one too many times the threads would come undone and the image would wash off. :-/  There was even a tiny hole or a gap in the back of my cardigan, right on one of the lines.  I was not too happy about it, but I'm not finding this anywhere else in stores and having to settle for an internet purchase, I'm keeping it.  Till I can learn to make my own, i'm gonna have to suck it up and just own it, literally! :P  All in all, I know you'll end up getting it because, I mean, Come ON! It's a freakin' Tardis! (In my best Amelia Pond impression!)  :)"
3.0,The dress is beautiful but the shoulders gape. Its really really long and I'm tall. And it takes another person to help you into the dress because it doesn't just zip up in the back it does up like a corset and is really difficult to do up and make it look nice. Can't do it alone
3.0,"This product is great quality! Worth every penny!<br />I wish that the fit was accurate. I usually wear a large, I sized up hoping to have a little more room for sweaters. The XL fit like a small. So sad I have to return this and miss out on the deal I got."
3.0,"They were pretty, I sent them back because they would always slide down my nose, I had to keep pushing them up. The fit was awkward."
3.0,"Bought this sweet space helmet for my [...]<br />It's a hollow, hard plastic shell that is uncomfortable and oversized. You will have to custom modify or MacGyver something in order to get it to stay or fit on your head. Otherwise your space party helmet turns into a depressed robot with it's head down."
3.0,Not the best fit.  Just a tight drape.
3.0,"I wear a xxl and that’s what I ordered. It was a little snug so if you want a loose fit order one size up. The quality wasn’t the best but for the price I guess it’s not too bad. Personally I’d rather spend $4 extra and get a better quality shirt, but this one will do the trick for what I need it for (wearing once or twice). Also the sleeves look funny because they are rolled. Not sure how it will do after washing but my guess is probably not that great. Again…spend a little extra and go for a better shirt."
3.0,It is a nice ring but I have a lower belly button piercing and it doesn't for right on me.
3.0,The magnet isn't strong enough. I worry I will lose my badge.
3.0,I got this for my daughter and she loved it but it is kind of flimsy and can easily break. The little rings on the side of the hearts are very thin and flimsy and broke off and she can’t wear them again. I’ll try gluing it. Might need to be soldered together.
3.0,"Super cute in theory, but the zippers get stuck often. Took this on a bachelorette party in Vegas - I looked super organized in front of the other girls, but it truthfully wasn't very practical in the end - would have been easier if the bags had different labels on them, I kept having to open everything to remind myself what was in inside."
3.0,"They are nice, but, I was surprised to see they look Faded, Second hand looking."
3.0,Too small... Got smaller when I washed and dried it.
3.0,These plugs are a great value for the money. Don’t expect perfection. Several of my plugs had chips in them that showed that the “look” was just painted on. Now some of them are real stone. The fit was a little small but not bad. You might want to go up to the next size.
3.0,It didn't look good on my body. The pleats in the front looked bad on me.
3.0,I was so disappointed!!!! I chanced it with only 2 reviews. NOT as pictured on the model. Be mindful of the length. Very short! I wanted long! The stone is so cheap looking. It all looks plastic. Almost like kids jewelry you see on the toy isle. I hate saying ugly things. Just NOT what the pictures and model display is. I’ll keep because I feel bad.
