5.0,I love the way these pants fit. The pockets are deep enough to fit my Samsung phone and my keys and chapstick. I plan on ordering more of these!
5.0,Beautiful raincoat! I had another one that I LOVED. This one is more trendy and made out of a heavier fabric. Best costs I've owned for the rain. Great with my fancy dresses or jeans.
5.0,"El color es igual a mi reloj, cómodo y elegante"
5.0,Like the color pattern and style. It’s a little bit big. Machines washed great.
5.0,"The service was great, product arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged.  Although I was looking for a heavier weight glove more so, a felt fabric for a semi-cold fall day these were fine for days that are warmer."
5.0,Beautiful ring!  I get lots of compliments.  It looks very nice!
5.0,Super cute outfit. Get lots of compliments when my daughter wears the.  Only complaint is the legs look a little bow legged.  Like the inseam wasn’t sewn right.  But still looks very adorable
5.0,I love it nice looking bracelet
5.0,"Very nice,pretty,quick and easy key removal"
5.0,Fit a little snug. But like them.
5.0,I love these shirts. Very comfortable and durable. I wear them just about every day.
5.0,Support socks  are so darn cute they do the job they’re supposed to. Easy to get on and off yet support my legs through 8 to 10 hour days.
5.0,Light weight and stylish.  More than I was expecting for the price.  I'm going to buy brown and red.  It works for me !
5.0,"I got this bracelet for my friend, she loves it!!!"
5.0,"There’s so many cute options for these earrings and I got the pack with the green stones. Their so cute and nicely made. The size is the perfect size for your ears, nothing small but also nothing huge and weird. I love these and would probably buy another set for other options."
5.0,"much cheaper than new, especially since new glasses are no longer available..."
5.0,i love this. it is very beautiful and fun to wear
5.0,Very lightweight and cool.
5.0,"The belt is attractive, and fits well. I can't comment on how long it will last, but its leather--not some cheap imitation--so I expect I'll have it for a while.<br /><br />Jack"
5.0,"Dress is very comfortable and and the large is perfect.  I typically wear a size large, 12-14.  Very nice fabric, light weight, but not thin."
5.0,My son loves this he wears an extra large but this runs big so a large is a bit big on him. He still likes it.
5.0,"The ""regular"" apple watch bands are just too thick and after swimming tend to capture moisture when watch is continuously worn.  This thin band solves the problem.  I can go swimming and because it's thin, it dries out and is comfortable to wear.  Love it.  Now if only it could be designed with little holes in it for additional air flow, it would be perfection."
5.0,Looks juat like the pic love it its very unique.
5.0,"Cute comfy top, arm holes somewhat large"
5.0,It is a very pretty ring. Love it very much.
5.0,Good for travel. Super lightweight. Repelled water ok and was good windbreaker. Don’t think it would work of all day in the rain but good enough with an umbrella.
5.0,Absolutely in love with this. Cuffs nicely and is adjustable. Made very well. Haven’t taken mine out yet.
5.0,Even though it’s a little bit snug I still love it
5.0,"Perfect fit, very heavy duty, very comfortable. I highly recommend these!!!"
5.0,"I love this sock! It makes me feel comfortable when wearing it. Though I didn't expect it to come in two different colors, but I like them both. Thanks for the extra piece."
5.0,They fit great! The girls found them comfortable.one had pink the other had purple.They went great with their unicorn themed birthday dress costumes!
5.0,"I love the cut, color, and style, but mostly I love the pockets. It's lightweight, feels soft, and fits me beautifully."
5.0,Very much liked the flamingos on the hat and that it had UPF 50  and it was foldable.  The gift was for my sister-in-law and she loved it and looked great in it.  I am going to buy myself one.
5.0,"Always a large Hermes silk square but didn't want to shell out $700? This is a GREAT substitute! Scarf is huge, 90cm/90 cm (ish). Silk is super soft and well, silky. Looks and feels like real silk but I'm not unravelling a thread for the burn test. Thickish fabric. Colors are beautiful and vibrant and this thing goes with everything! Navy, black, brown, khaki green, red, gold......I think this scarf's color palette is very versatile and works with many skin tones.  The design is spectacular. Love it! The edges are rolled towards the wrong side and stitched. The scarf is not reversible, so with that and way the edges are rolled, on close inspection it isnt going to be mistaken for Hermes. But it looks and feels high quality, and certainly appears MUCH more expensive than it was!"
5.0,"I wasn’t to sure about this dress when I purchased it, but upon receiving and trying it on, I absolutely love it. Fits perfect! 5’ 3’’ 117lbs. XS."
5.0,Bought as a gift for my boyfriend. He loved it!!
5.0,Love them. Warmth Softness Texting ability
5.0,It was a gift.  She loved them.
5.0,I got this dress in 12-18 months for my 11 month old so she has room to grow into it. She is true to size. I really love how it fit!
5.0,It was better than expected for the price! I bought it for my best friend's birthday and she totally loved it! Thanks so much!
5.0,It shipped at a reasonable time. It's study quality yet adjustable. It isn't too thick and the company sent me some dainty pink stud earrings as a plus! Looks exactly like the picture as well! So happy that I decided on this one!
5.0,"Super sturdy, long lasting, comfortable. Would definitely recommend to anyone who needs some. We use them for boating, kayaking, fishing and every day use"
5.0,"I have been using this for months! It has never bothered me in my pocket and it fits all my cards! The orange color has gotten a bit ugly, but its still looks nice to me. I would get a lether one next time."
5.0,"Exactly as expected. Love this shirt, great price and it fits over my large bust while not bagging on my torso! It should be worth $ 60 I think. Totally recommended."
5.0,It seems durable but I don’t wear it when I sleep or shower. Only issue I had was the funnel was useless. The ashes was not fine enough to go through it. Kept clogging the funnel. But other than that I love it.
5.0,"Great quality, I have tried the others and this brand is the only one that holds up to the wear."
5.0,Nice and comfort
5.0,Producto muy bueno y con terminación de primera.
5.0,Bought as present - he loved them!
5.0,I’ve tried a lot<br />Of goggles but they leak and fog up. I stumbled on the Aegend goggles about 3 years ago and they are terrific. They don’t leak nor fog up. I recommended these to several of my swimming swimming friends and they enjoy them as well.
5.0,So pretty and the fit is perfect! I typically wear a 14/16 and the extra large is just right. I will be ordering in black as well. Such a good deal for the price.
5.0,Very cute. Came faster then I expected
5.0,Very comfortable but I broke first pair but I replaced them because I like them .
5.0,"Very nice piece, sturdy and heavy. Super fast delivery. Thank you"
5.0,"Bought this in florescent green, 2 in a package. The band is a good width, the weave seems thick enough that it won't tear or unravel.<br />Happy with this purchase."
5.0,"I purchased these shoes for my elderly Dad who has severe issues with his feet and needed a soft cushion but a soft bottom shoe (difficult to find).  I found these and he loves them!!  They are so comfortable, he would prefer to wear these outside vs regular shoes.  They are soft, form fitting and the heel doesn't come off, and they keep his feet warm without being too hot.  These were a winner!"
5.0,"Remember, these are sized for men and women. Maybe a little too big for some women. But comfortable!"
5.0,Perfect fit! My daughter loved it. Great quality for the price
5.0,"Fit my 6g ears, big flare on the tunnel, makes them look larger in your ears. Easy to put in, pretty colors. Most pleased with this purchase. :)"
5.0,"soft to the touch, not stiff.  very roomy well made and great packaging"
5.0,I absolutely love this dress! It’s so pretty and feminine and perfect for the spring.  I’m a little top heavy so it was a tad snug at the top but other than that I loved the way it fit me. I’m 5’3 and 137 pounds. I ordered a size small.
5.0,Such a nice addition to my bracelet!
5.0,Very cute ! Beautiful bright yellow color . So pretty and unique
5.0,"Very cute little gloves. The 2-3 year size fit my 3yo old exactly, and they stay on. I like the way the velcro wraps across the back to tighten the whole glove. They seems very comfortable and soft inside and warm, and they stay put, and I LOVE the way the wrist piece is soft and flexible to easily put it either inside or outside the child's jacket sleeves. Great gloves."
5.0,The watch band is quite pretty. The sparkles are subtle and not bold. The watch pins were too short. I  had to take It to a jewelry shop and get the right size.  I'm quite happy with it.
5.0,Great fit and awesome design
5.0,Excellent quality for a great price. Once this is washed it is very true to size! I highly recommend this for a quality sweatshirt.
5.0,Any short sleeve shirt can be worn year round.
5.0,"These made my legs feel great and the price was right! I am 5-ft 6-in and weigh about 220lbs. I have women's size 10-11 extremely wide feet, so I ordered the large. I wonder if the smaller size would have sufficed, as I have a bit of extra fabric at the top of the sock to turn down and a large &#34;pinch-full&#34; of fabric at my toes. I would not, however, have been able to tolerate their being too short and not reaching my knee or a lot of torque pulling on the ends of my toes. They are thick, but I kind of wish they were thicker if only to ensure their durability. I wore them one right after the other on the first two days after they arrived, and I could definitely tell a difference on the 3rd day when I didn't wear them. My legs felt &#34;heavy&#34; without them. I will order again. SOON!!"
5.0,"I love this pretty casual shirt!  It's also super soft and long enough to cover my rear (just as I wanted). I'm a tall girl; 5'10, 200 lbs, but this didn't make me look it. It's a very flattering shirt. Very happy with it!"
5.0,"Not too bad,a bit smaller than Pandora charm. Packaging is good."
5.0,"Comfortable, cute, and soft! First wash caused a few little string loops in the fabric, but what can you do. Perfect for what I wanted. Took the little padded pieces out, but the pads are actually cloth and not just cheap foam so I'm saving them for later use just in case."
5.0,Me encanto. A mi hija le quedo como lo esperaba.
5.0,My husband loves these boots! He owns them in two colors.
5.0,I would like it a little bigger.
5.0,Great value and cute hats. Prefect for these hot summer days by pool. They fit good and the brim holds up nice. Greatful they came in 3 pack as I can change them out daily depending on outfit.
5.0,Bought them for my husband and he loves them
5.0,"Hello, I purchased this wallet for my husband. He has has multiple surgeries on his back and his physician tells him every month that he needs to lighten up on how much he carries in his wallet, but we are creatures of habit right? So he insists on carrying a wallet that is overstuffed with cards that he has not used in years. This wallet however, was easy to sell to him... at least for using while we are on vacation or in highly populated areas. For now, it is the wallet he uses for  those type of scenarios, hoping that soon (since he loves it so much) that he will realize he doesn't need his certification cards that he hasn't used in over fifteen years and switches to this one permanently.<br />Love the product, quality is great, packaging added to the gift quality.<br />This was an excellent purchase, I plan on purchasing more for my adult sons.<br />Thank you,<br />Full Disclosure: I have either received this product for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my HONEST and unbiased review.<br />I will not recommend products that I do not truly believe are worthy. My integrity has always been of the utmost importance to me.<br />If this review is helpful to you, please let me know by clicking on &#34;helpful.&#34; If it is not, please let me know what you felt was lacking."
5.0,They're bright and even helped me when I lost my luggage.
5.0,my husband was very pleased with these<br />he will be trying them out on a motorcycle ride in a few weeks
5.0,I love this earring! I get many compliments on it! It is an 18 gauge and had no problem getting it into my piercing (from a gun piercing) just a little push and it was in. I have no problems sleeping with it in. Thanks!
5.0,"Great quality for $6.99! This was a last minute purchase for St. Paddy's Day and it exceeded my expectations. The boat neck neckline and feminine cut is very flattering. It fit great! I'm 5'6"" and 145 lbs and ordered a small, which was pretty fitted. I usually wear a medium, which would have been a good fit too, just a little bit looser, but the reviews said to size down. Either would have been fine, just depends if you want it fitted or not."
5.0,I know it is for men but I loved the joggers so comfy and perfect fit personally I think it’s unisex.
5.0,"I am 5’6”, 190 lbs, 38B, bottom heavy and ordered a size Medium.  I really like this house dress. It is very well made.  It has generous arm holes, mid calf length and is very comfortable. It’s not too thin, so you can wear it outside to the mailbox and in front of others. I’m definitely a size large in most tops & gowns but the medium fits me great. If you are large busted you may want to order your regular size.  I hand washed in cold water & hung to dry before wearing just in case the blue dye faded.  I didn’t notice any fading.  I Will machine wash & dry the next time."
5.0,"Super cute, comfy and on trend! Love!"
5.0,Ver Nice
5.0,This coat is Everything pictured.  Warning: it is VERY warm while being very lightweight.  I've learned to only wear mine 32 degrees or below.
5.0,"Good material, love everything about it...."
5.0,I love everything about this blouse!
5.0,This is a beautiful crystal to wear. I wore it today and it made me feel very happy and positive.
5.0,"For parties and special occasions, this tie is hard to beat.  It has beautiful, vivid color and looks perfect with the pocket square.  A real attention-grabber, I highly recommend."
5.0,Love it- bought it in two colors and would buy in more if they had different colors to choose from.
5.0,Cutest pair of sunglasses ever!!!
5.0,Perfect fit. I wear a 9 W and these are just right. Very comfortable and cute.
5.0,Beautiful dress. Flattering. The only thing I did not like was the size I had to order!Lol  Go by the measurements!
5.0,"This was used by someone who was post-op from a rotator cuff and bicep repair. When it came time to get out of the house for follow up appts, this made things very easy. Even the surgeon was impressed by the shirt and asked where it came from to provide as a resource to his other patients. Highly recommended!"
5.0,We use this blanket all year round. From camping to lounging on our couch. We've washed it several times and it is slowly becoming softer.  Still a little stiff. My only issue so far is wishing it was bigger.
5.0,So cute on.....I find my self wearing it all the time...true to size....I didn't know it was a maternity dress LOL! but fits like any top...Soo comfortable
5.0,Beautiful dress on my nice!
5.0,My wife ordered these protectors. Water on the slide sole will cause you to stick on the approach.<br />They work very well. Easy on/easy off.<br />Keep up the good work!<br />JF
5.0,I love all of my nightgowns from this company. Nothing better than the feel lof this soft cotton. I own several of these nightgowns in short and long sleeves for year-round.
5.0,Perfect for rock painting! No preparation required prior to painting.
5.0,This shirt is amazing. The graphics look even better in person. Fits perfect. I’m 6’1” 190 lbs and bought the large. It is light and perfect for summer. It is not a cotton shirt. It’s a polyester that feels very smooth and comfortable. Better than I expected for the price.
5.0,Bought this for someone and she is very pleased with this purchase. The fabric is nice and it looks really nice on.
5.0,"I LOVE THESE.  I'm kind of picky about PJs, and these fit the bill.  They are soft and slinky, don't cling too much, and have just the right amount of stretch.  They wash excellently, haven't pilled at all, and seem to be off good quality."
5.0,Many compliments. Comfortable and cute!
5.0,These are very pretty can wear casual or with dressing up they actually look very pretty glad I bought them
5.0,"Great coat, bought one for my Daughter and she loved it so much I ordered one for me !!! Awesome coat , super soft and comfortable. Runs small so check size chart. I usually wear a sm- med. Extra large fits perfect"
5.0,So much more vibrant than the photos online suggest!
5.0,This is an excellent watch winder and it costs less than half the price of another unit brand that I bought.  The other unit has some significant issues.  Not this one.
5.0,"Love it, love it,love it. Got lots of complements. Even my husband said it looked nice on me! And I love the beautiful jewel tone color!"
5.0,The wife was very happy with them. Nice packaging and a great and easy gift
5.0,These claws are the best! Exactly like Wolverines! I had a different set and they were heavy and cut my knuckles and the blades were straight which is not what Wolverine's are. These are absolutely perfect. Lightweight and exact! Love them!
5.0,Fits great and very comfortable. I have big calves and they go on with ease!
5.0,Perfect. My daughter wears them for soccer - and even makes them a part of her everyday outfits too!
5.0,I bought this for my mom for mother’s day and she absolutely loves it! Such great quality and the three cubs are very defined. Highly recommended!
5.0,Fit and feel great. Buying a second pair.
5.0,"The t-shirts fit true to size. The fabric is lightweight, soft, stretchy and breathable. They are well stitched and well made. These t-shirts are perfect for sleep, in hot weather, under long sleeved shirt. My son likes wearing them."
5.0,"Cleavage, lots, but really a beautiful black lace dress. A great buy!"
5.0,"Purchased a 3x expecting it to run snug. I'm 5'7"", top heavy, hips, and rear. It's more so tight at the top and fits fine everywhere else. Lettering is good quality and length is too. I've tried it on with a shaper and without. It looks fine either way. I'll decide whether it's needed when I get to Vegas in August."
5.0,Cute. Bought it to go on a cheap (but cite) purse I bought. Did the job!
5.0,I'm 5'4 130 with a small bust but a larger rear.  I ordered a small and it fit just right.  It pairs perfectly with leggings and boots.  The only thing I wish was that it was thicker material.  I do have to wear a tank/cami underneath.
5.0,"great sunglasses, very comfortable!"
5.0,Delivered on time and the hat has a great fit. This long time Angels fan love the logo.
5.0,True to the description!
5.0,Love these they came quickly and they are official
5.0,perfect length/shape...product arrived right on time...thank you...
5.0,Nice on time delivery.  This product only has don wonders for my husband's legs.  The color is coming back almost normal. Second order and they hold up in wash. Will order 3rd order soon.
5.0,"Needed something I could wear to work and wear to church! This is perfect! I'm shorter so it's a little long, but with a pair of wedges it flows perfectly at my ankles! You won't be disappointed!"
5.0,These undershirts appear to be small when you first open the pk.  The purpose is to provide a protective layer between your skin and the orthotic (back brace) without creating wrinkles.  The undershirt is very stretchy and performs just as it should.  These shirts do relax and stretch out over time and numerous washes
5.0,I wasn't expecting a big watch but it's ok
5.0,This Dress is no disappointment. It fits and looks exactly like the pic. I am very please!!!😍😍
5.0,"This dress is FANTASTIC. It’s well worth the money. The quality is amazing, too. It does run very, very large. I wear a size 12 and originally ordered a size XXL, which was ginormous. I exchanged it for a medium which fit perfectly if not a little too snug (I’m planning to shrink myself a bit by the time I need to wear the dress for the annual Versailles ball in May). If you’re on the fence, go for it. I did a ton of research before settling for this gown and I’m extremely pleased with my purchase. It is a bit long so you’ll need to wear heels or hem it (you can cheat with hem tape - wink)!"
5.0,The fit was fine for my size 9 I ordered but it has a very narrow toe.  In addition they are very stiff so I recommend breaking them in ahead of time.
5.0,Color was more orange than red but it’s so cute and fit so well I kept it.
5.0,"Worked perfectly for the infusible ink I cut on my cricut maker and applied using a cricut easypress. Nice bag, very flexible, long handles."
5.0,IN LOVE WITH THESE EARRINGS! I get so many compliments and everyone asks where I got them! These were a great fit and I never have to worry about them falling out or out of place.
5.0,These socks are just like they were advertised . Gave to my son in law and he said they keep his feet warm and dry
5.0,Good quality for the money. Fits perfect and looks great.
5.0,Just as described. Super soft and comfy
5.0,"This sink far surpasses the picture. It is beautiful swirls of ivory, beige, and tan. There are no black marks or holes the way the photo depicts. It is not white, yellow, or orange.  And it being real stone for the price is amazing."
5.0,My grandson loves them; nice quality.
5.0,"I am a fan of wearing my husbands pants around the house because for some reason men's pants are just way more comfortable!  I was a little thrown off by the tight cuff bottoms but upon putting them on, they weren't tight enough that it would cause discomfort.  These are made to have a loose baggy fit, perfect for running. I picked this size because I fully planned on stealing them from hubby's drawer to wear myself.  I ordered them in a small.  They were pretty tight around the waist so I didn't find much use for the drawstring.  The sweatpants feature two pockets on the front and one on the back.  The pockets are all large enough to really hold any personal belongings.  The fabric is relatively thick and definitely warm.  It is well put together and the stitching is nice and tight.  Very straight and beautifully done.  These will hold up to wash and wear!  I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Quality Nike as always!
5.0,Beautiful and looks way more expensive than it is! Read directions on how to adjust the band ;-)
5.0,"Fits perfectly & was very comfortable. True to size, i ordered a medium"
5.0,Nice addition to the holiday jewelry.
5.0,Reciever of gift liked his Disney Stitch sweatshirt. The quality was what you'd expect. I felt it was a fair price.
5.0,Wife order these she said good fit and comfy
5.0,please do not hesistate to buy this skirts. buy  it without doubt. beautiful  skirt i ever buy on amazon!!! i am going to buy more colors
5.0,"Beautiful and well made, would have paid 3x the price for it. I've been pairing this ring with my white gold engagement ring for some extra elegance. Awesome."
5.0,Easy to put on and looks nice.
5.0,"Got these for my dad for his birthday, great gift for x-men fans."
5.0,"Love, love, love it!  Exactly what I was expecting!  Not cheap looking and goes well with a regular t-shirt or dress."
5.0,Cute my daughter loves it. A classic touch to any outfit
5.0,"Cute, cute, cute! Love it!"
5.0,"I got one for my husband last year and he had a coworker who loved it,  so I was happy to get one for him as well.  Very nice tie, and good quality at a good price.  I"
5.0,The yarn spiral is more comfortable to wear and sturdier than plastic.  I have them as gifts to  other teachers and kept a few for myself!  I've had mine for a few months;  I  keep my keys on it.  It hasn't stretched out or shown any wear.  Very convenient  considering women's dress clothes never have pockets. ..now I  don't worry about locking myself out !
5.0,Great product going to buy another one
5.0,This is a nice Shelby T and the quality is ok. The sleeves are somewhat large for a medium. But it’s not a huge deal. It hasn’t shrunk much after several washes and the graphic is still intact. The product photo doesn’t show it but there’s some small copyright print under the Cobra logo. It’s not too apparent in person.
5.0,"Love them, will get more soon"
5.0,"I am 5'11, so I was worried about the length on these, but nope! They come all the way to my knee. It's just the right amount of compression. Not so much that it's uncomfortable. I wear them to bed at night and my legs feel amazing in the morning, not to mention they look slim finally! No more cankles."
5.0,"Fits as expected. Well made. After I received the first one, I immediate purchased another. It covers up in all the right places."
5.0,"These were great and a huge hit with the kids. I was a little worried about ordering these because of so many bad reviews but was happy I did! I got them to give them out for my children's class goodie bags we made to hand out for Halloween. All 40 of them were working. We still have a few left and they all still work and my boys use them every night! Not sure if this matter, but I ordered from USA Toyz, they have great reviews so decided to pay a little more to get from them and I think it was worth it! Very happy!"
5.0,Perfect for my 6 year old daughter.
5.0,"Nice , vibrant print, big lettering. .."
5.0,I liked the quality of the hats.  I had a hat for entire family.  Got some great Christmas pictures all wearing the hats.
5.0,I love it! it's beautiful and the button on the neck helps to keep it in place & you warm.
5.0,The dress was a big hit at my job’s Christmas party. I’m 5’7 136 lbs and The small fits great
5.0,"I spent a few days debating on what size to order since I read a few conflicting reviews from other women around the same body type as mine. I decided to order a size medium and overall it's a good fit. I was a little worried at first because it was a little bit of a squeeze to get the dress over the bust area but once I was past that, it fit like a glove. The sleeves are a bit snug but I think it'll loosen enough once I move around in it for a little while. Overall quality of the dress is very nice. The color blue is true to the product photo and the material has some stretch, as well. Got this dress for a company holiday party. I'm 5'7, 150lbs and 36D.<br /><br />Hope this helps!"
5.0,"This lingerie is super sexy, and flattering to my size 12 tall curvy figure. It isn't easy finding lingerie of good quality that makes me look like a superstar lingerie model, but this definitely does the trick. The fabric is soft and breathable. It is well made and the stitching is strong and high quality. It should last a long time. Just enough of a see thru quality to make it interesting. It does support my breasts, though they want to pop out of the chest hole if I move too much ... and when I wore it for my S.O., there were no complaints about that. The gstring and the thigh highs feel a little bit snug, But you can't see that, they worked, and they didn't stay on long anyway.  That was a fun night. Now this is staying in my drawer until next time I want some purple spice in my life. Probably won't be very long.  I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and fair review. I am very pleased with this purchase!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:c86f2773021d10a55919d5c00be7cfc6]] Wife loves the ring & so far nothing wrong with it
5.0,Love it !  Beautiful and quality.
5.0,They are perfect for my job! I will buy them again for sure!
5.0,I like the way the shirt fits ans feels as I wear them daily in the cooler months of the year.
5.0,This hoodie is extremely comfortable. It’s warm and fits exactly how I wanted it to. Color is nice and bright. It’s not muted or faded. Materials seem to be of good quality. I’m going to buy another one. For twenty bucks in these big sizes you can’t go wrong!
5.0,"Great Merchandise, quick delivery, perfect for what I needed, A+++++ seller, Thanks!!!"
5.0,"I haven't worn it yet - but tried it on upon receiving it. The fit was fine, and I loved that the material was nice and soft. This will be great for those hot summer days."
5.0,love the shoes but they broke on August 20th!  no returns - so I didn't even get to enjoy them for 30 days - :(  that was disappointing!
5.0,I picked this out for wifey and she looks super summer hot at the same time she's being protected from UV rays. Win/Win.
5.0,Daughter wears them everyday
5.0,The pants are light and comfortable.
5.0,My husband loved the keychain.
5.0,I ordered this purse/bag for traveling.  I found that I love it's functionality so much that I am using it for everyday use.  I think I will be ordering it in more colors!
5.0,Fits like a glove. Simple design but the back is stunning. I got a ton of compliments.
5.0,"I really like this shirt and plan on buying the long sleeve version soon. Fit was tight (it was supposed to be) and if you're looking for a loose fit, go up a size."
5.0,"I needed a work watch that would hold up to rain and sweat and this watch has fit the bill. The automatic mechanism works well,is accurate,looks good, and the time is easy to read.It does not glow in the dark although it looks like it would. When I first got it, I had trouble setting the time. I couldn't pull out the stem. I unscrewed the stem slightly and was able to pull out the stem and set the time.I then screwed the stem back in. This is the first Field and Stream watch I've ever owned and I am very satisfied with it. Update: I've had this watch for about 2 years now and I'm still extremely happy with it. I own about 20 automatic watches and usually once you take a watch off, it will run for another 2 days or so. This watch lasts about a month! I've never seen anything like it. Anyway, I'm shocked at how long it runs. I'm not sure if all these watches go that long but this one does."
5.0,These shorts are literally perfect!  Soft as butter and still makes your butt look good!  L
5.0,The product rocks! I will buy again and again!
5.0,"Bought these for my sister for her birthday. She LOVES them. She said that she can do her walks or go work out in them and they are very comfortable and do not bind or impede her exercises. She also said that they were warm on her legs, which was nice since it is beginning to turn cold in Louisiana. She said they were well made and she really is happy with them."
5.0,"To answer the question, these pants do fit as expected....to be completely honest these pants remind me of a long lost love in that I'm wearing them for the first time, but there is something eerily comforting with them....as if I've been wearing them for over 10 years.  I would absolutely buy these pants again."
5.0,"Just as pictured, perfect accent to my formal dress!"
5.0,"These glasses have a nice weight to them. They’re lightweight without feeling flimsy. They are also beautiful! The rose gold frame is so pretty and neutral and the gradient brown lens looks great and is a nice color for driving. I love the bamboo arms! No plastic adding to the pollution problem! They came nicely packaged with a triangular hard case, a soft case with a drawstring and a cloth for cleaning them. My only complaint is the logo on both sides of the temple. I’d rather they be plain, but overall, I’m very happy with these and kinda wish they had more colors."
5.0,Stunningly beautiful. I may order again.  Theresa
5.0,Cute and item fit good. It’s a little to big i got A medium I’m 5’0ft 145pds. I believe a small will fit way nicer. Item is as picture.
5.0,"Cute little dress. Nicely made. Good material. I'm 5'4, 115 lbs. Love the bottom of the dress. It's not real close fitting in the waist. I don't think it was made to. I got the med.<br />I later ordered the wine. Love it too. Wish they had it in more colors. Mediums are gone in the blue. :("
5.0,Great sunglasses. Held up well in the ocean and pool.
5.0,"Cute,light weight & smooth feel..Beautiful rainbow colors! I love it"
5.0,"The excitement in the picture speaks a thousand words! Beautiful, clean, fits my head great with it being a ""can't go wrong"" snap back adjustable.  Really like the smooth textured feel the hat has to it also! Definitely recommend, the seller has done an amazing job!"

5.0,"Exactly as pictured, described and delivered."
5.0,Stunning well-made skating dress. It was beautiful in the pictures and even better in person. The dress came with a little baggy of extra rhinestones in case any popped off. This dress is extremely comfortable and has a nice skirt length.
5.0,I love how the different styles of this bracelet wear well together.  They are not heavy and I like wearing several at a time.
5.0,"Purchased for running and martial arts training, I can kick and stretch with no issues. Good value & good buy"
5.0,"Look, when I say I feel like a goddess floating here on earth when I wear this dress, babay! The fabric is lightweight and comfortable. The cut is super cute and flattering. The design is nice and tropical. And the slits and cut outs! Fire! Buy this and strut Queen! Strut!"
5.0,"Not super sturdy, but for the price, works & looks great if you aren't too rough on it.  It is very thin."
5.0,These make a lovely gift for the women born in August
5.0,Expensive looking piece at affordable price for a gift for a special someone
5.0,This hat is really awesome! I got it as a gift for my boyfriend who is an OEF vet. He's been looking for a hat that wasn't the normal. He loves it! It fits well and it's good quality and made well. He wears it almost daily and it has really held up.
5.0,Love the color & fits well.
5.0,"Love this dress, I am 5’4-170lbs and brought a Large. Fits perfect. I brought it a second time in a different color. Perfect dress for fall."

5.0,"Beautiful dress, perfect fit, and great quality!"
5.0,Cute keychain!
5.0,Given as a gift to a runner and dog walker!
5.0,"This dress is stunning! I love that the silver isn't too shiny and has just the right amount of shimmer to pop without being overwhelming. The lace design at the top is beautiful and well made, and seems sure to be strong enough to last a long time without tears or pulls. The skirt is a thick material of great quality that holds its shape surprisingly well to give you a very nice shape; I thought I would need a petticoat but it seems unnecessary. And I love that the material doesn't crease or wrinkle easily--even after being folded for shipping, there are very few noticeable creases, so I'm confident I'll be able to sit through a wedding ceremony and dinner without looking rumpled. And there are pockets! I'm going to be the envy of SO many women.<br /><br />Make sure to check your measurements against the measurements provided for the dress. I ordered up a size from what I usually am in the US based on the sizing chart and it worked out excellently.<br /><br />And an extra five stars for their customer service! I'm always timid about ordering clothes online and wanted to know the return policy (which is very reasonable), and I was really worried about not being able to get this dress in time for the wedding I have to attend. All my messages were answered very quickly and thoroughly, and they reassured me I would have the dress by September 3: It's August 30 and I already have it even though the earliest shipping estimate was September 1! I'm so awed and thankful. Now I'm hoping for another wedding to attend so I can have an excuse to purchase another dress from Fanhao. I'll definitely be keeping them in mind for future formalwear needs!"
5.0,Kept my head very warm in Iceland. Also kept my head warm and dry when random rain showers would appear.
5.0,Love my shades. Perfect dupe & I have been receiving so many compliments. Very durable & the blue is so pretty
5.0,"Really great buy. I ordered two, and we were both very happy with the necklace. feels good to wear. the marks on the stone are actually inclusions of the shungite, and a way to tell that it's real. the inclusions actually look pretty neat. I thought I'd mention it because I noticed that some people thought that they were scratches."
5.0,Very happy with this dress.  I bought a size bigger than my daughter wears and it’s still super cute while allowing her room to grow.
5.0,The product was beautiful and exactly what I was looking for and as it appeared online. The vendor shipped quickly and I had the product in sufficient time for Christmas.
5.0,These worked well as loot bag gifts
5.0,"I am 5’9” and 140lbs. I bought a size M and they fit perfectly. Squat proof. Snug around the waist, compression, will be perfect for CrossFit. I own a lot of gymshark leggings and I would purchase these over gymshark in the future. Cost is better and quality is similar."
5.0,I bought this dress for my granddaughter for Christmas. It was adorable and she wore it Christmas Day.
5.0,Product features and fit as described.
5.0,Great look on my granddaughter
5.0,Fits perfectly fine and it's comfortable.
5.0,The cut on this shirt is so cute. I loved the material and the overall look but it was too small. I gave it to my daughter and she loves it.
5.0,"I used this in a Father's day ""card"". Made a ""wallet"", put this in one side, and a gift card for his favorite ice cream parlor on the other. It turned out very cute."
5.0,So comfortable & everyone that sees them want them ! Will buy more in all colors!!
5.0,Totally love this dress and got so many compliments at my nieces brunch wedding. A must have. I’m 6’ft and 210 and curvy.  I could of done a medium but instead I went with a large and it was very comfortable.
5.0,Las compré para mi nena de 3 años le quedaron un poco grandes pero no hay problema
5.0,Great quality for the price and love the look. I’ve gotten many compliments.
5.0,"Comfortable and cute, but runs a little big."
5.0,Super cute and the fit is good
5.0,"Great light weight vest.  Lots of pockets but sizable for fly boxes. mesh adds cool and reduces weight. There are no built in retractors so you'll need to get some for your tools, but there are several places to connect retractors to suit your preferences. can carry lunch, water bottle etc. in back pocket for day long hike in fishing. The built in fly pads are not so good; dry flies get squished a bit ok for nymphs. I added a clip on tuff for dry flies to air out. This is my go to vest now period."
5.0,"Nicely made and cute keychain and as a bonus, a donation is made when you purchase one:)"
5.0,I normally wear XL but had to return and buy 3XL.  They do not stretch and run very small.  The fabric is soft and great looking. The 3XL fit good and everyone gave me compliments on the color and look.  Just beware of the size.
5.0,"Quick shipping, and it works well."
5.0,"I loved these socks, they kept me so war, and comfortable up in the mountains ! Would totally recommend if you’re going on a ski trip &lt;3"
5.0,Got for my 3 yo girl who LOVES boy undies. They fit perfectly! They fit like short shorts more than boy undies but she loves them and that’s all that matters. The only weird thing is they don’t have tags in them so I’m not sure if the picture is in the rear or front?
5.0,Love love love these shoes. So comfy.
5.0,My Grand Nephews love it!!  And there are enough for friends to join in the Super Hero fun!
5.0,My son is very happy! It’s light and keeps him cool.
5.0,Love these! For the price and have all the options for colors to choose from!
5.0,THIS WAS PERFECT!! I used this for my little girl's 1st birthday cake smash and it was super adorable! I could NOT be more satisfied with this!!!!
5.0,"This watch looks and feels like it should cost twice as much as it does. It's an excellent fit, it's comfortable to wear all day, even while working. It's strong and resilient as well. I have worn it in the shower multiple times and I wash my hands with it on with zero issues. This watch looks nice and is a fantastic value!"
5.0,Loved the length and strength for this cross. Our daughter looked wonderful in it.
5.0,Great price and very cute ear rings!
5.0,"Beautiful, good quality earrings that I gifted to my sister for her birthday.  The geometric elephants makes them unique and not like something a little kid would wear.  Cute in an adult way.  I chose the silver and they are a bright clean white silver, not a tarnished or vintage look.  The little saying on the card is cute, too."
5.0,"The necklas appears just as pictured.  It's bright, seems sturdy and is exactly what I hoped to get when I ordered."
5.0,"They do what they are supposed to 😉 just using to stretch up to desired size without spending a billion dollars , lol . This is 20mm"
5.0,Received one as a gift last year. Still sturdy. Makes a great gift!
5.0,I liked the fact that it stretches and doesn't feel tight on her head. Do recommend this. I will be buying more.
5.0,"I used these as bridesmaids dresses and all of my ladies were in love with them. They were comfortable, good quality, had some stretch to them, and the girls felt like they could wet them again. I was surprised by how good the quality was for the price."
5.0,Light weight and so far don't fog up much.
5.0,"Kid loves it, great fabric."
5.0,"This polishing cloth is wonderful and an absolute must have if you posses sterling silver jewelry.  It does a beautiful job when combined with Precious Jewelry Cleaner, made by Beadsmith.  You'll also want to purchase  a set of Nitril disposable gloves, as the cleaning product can be harsh on one's hands."
5.0,Beautiful mala!
5.0,Very good quality purse love the look and how sturdy it is. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
5.0,Great for the price and comfortable.
5.0,Earrings are sooo Comfortable!
5.0,Bought for a Xmas gift...  My daughter loves Steve Madden slides...  She wears a 3Y...  I always buy a 4 and it fits with room to grow...
5.0,"This is a OZ top, but for me perfectly. I'm 5'6 at 150 pounds. I love it."
5.0,My daughter loves these. A friend of hers in London had a pair so of coarse she had to have them.
5.0,"Cute colours, fit just as expected, while fabric was not too heavy or thin.  Will be buying more."
5.0,This is a great comfy stretchy top with vibrant colors- I will order more! It’s quite thick material and very long - I wouldn’t wear for golf in hot weather like a SanSoleil that is breathable - but it’s great for cooler weather - it’s true to size - arms are baggy and shirt is long while it’s fits quite narrow - but I like having a real collar and will order more.
5.0,Supperrr cuuttee!
5.0,I'm petite but curvy this product fit like a glove ! It had some stretch to it it was perfect!!!!! I wore a petticoat under it for a more flared look.

5.0,Love the colors and fit of these.  I use them under my shirts in yoga and for everyday layering.  Very soft and comfortable.  The price is right for so many!
5.0,I've been experiencing neck and shoulder pain. I researched & researched and decided in the Healthy Back Bag. I then decided I would select a nice leather one. I like this green one very much. The leather is very nice to the touch.<br />My neck and shoulders are feeling better already.
5.0,"I got the 3 pack of blue bottles for $11.99. They're good quality... Nice, thick glass and study spray levels with spouts that extend nearly to the bottom of the bottle. The labels work nice. They adhere well the surface but can still be removed without leaving residue. I like how the caps are included. The bottles also just look nice... They're really pretty cobalt blue and look much more classy than those plastic industrial cleaning bottles.<br /><br />I purchased these primarily to use for essential oils. I did some research a concocted a mixture to repel ants, spiders and scorpions.  These are working great, the misting function allows me to cover a high volume of area while the spray function enables me to zoom in on a specific region such as a Black Widow web."
5.0,A++++++++++++ Fit Great
5.0,This is a very nice dress. Much nicer then I was exspecting for the price. It is fully lined and not at all see through.
5.0,"Great quality, daughter loves it. Fits!!"
5.0,good buy. I have mine going on 4 years.
5.0,"Oh my goodness I love this item I can wear it as a.  Slouchy hat, A scarf, A turban, I can even pull my pony tail ( that my hair is normally in with a hair clamp or elastic band ) through it! Plus it's so soft and comfy. Thank you! It's great!"
5.0,Fantastic product will buy it again Thank you
5.0,"Love this dress. Had to get XL for the top portion, but it's not a tent in the bottom. Lots of compliments and it's so soft and comfortable!"
5.0,This dress surprised me as it was better than expected... it is more comfortable and adorable than I anticipated.  It is flowy with rather thin material that may need a layer underneath.  Overall very pleased with this dress.
5.0,Cute dress. Nice quality for the money.
5.0,Fit perfectly and its a really pretty dress. Fabric is a really good quality and is very comfortable.
5.0,I bought these for my niece and she can only wear studded earrings. These are very pretty and look very nice on. My niece loves them and you get a good amount for the price you pay. I’m very happy with them.
5.0,Bought 3 for my team. Sized up after reading the reviews. Super comfy.
5.0,Beautiful color and lots of sparkle-on the small side but if it is what you are looking for it is a good buy.
5.0,I liked it is what it says it is. I wear it on my head
5.0,"Plenty big enough for my sunglasses, keys, wallet, phone, lip gloss, and even baby snacks if I fill it all the way up. Awesome color, well made bag, I love wearing it! :)"
5.0,"It is out of this world gorgeous! I ordered one for my niece . And it was so beautiful I decided to order one for myself . And my<br />Sweet friend loved it so much I decided to order one for her. Her birthday is coming up, so she's going to be so surprised.<br />Thank you for the wonderful quality and care in the design. Hope to be a customer<br />Of yours for a long time."

5.0,Prcious
5.0,Good quality! They are more sturdy than expected. Worth the money
5.0,I'm 5'6&#34; and 165 lbs. The length is perfect. It goes to just above my knees. It's great for mid night nursing because of the front buttons. Soft and comfy!
5.0,"If I could wear it every day and get away with it, I would. Love the outfit. Super comfy."
5.0,This dress arrived quickly and was exactly what I hoped. It was for a friend who is 5’3” and fit her perfectly! The accessories are well made as is the dress. We can’t wait for our Gatsby event!
5.0,Muy buena calidad y cómodos
5.0,Fits perfectly and feels so comfortable.
5.0,"Great fit, good quality and great customer service"
5.0,"The blouse arrived in a lovely package, which I appreciated. I ordered the extra large and it fits perfectly, I am 4.11 and for once, the shoulders and length is perfect. I usually wear a size 8/10. It's so soft and silky. This will now be my blouse for work and are going to order more straight away.  Hope it stands up to washing and wearing a few times. Will keep you posted!"
5.0,I've tried many a shoelace and these seem to hold up the best. I work as a mechanic and do a moderate amount of welding and these seem to take sparks pretty well. They normally last me about 6 months which is pretty good considering others only last me about a month
5.0,"Beautiful dress, fit wonderfully, looks like it would cost way more than $30! First time ordering clothing from this site and will not be the last."
5.0,Daughter loves!!
5.0,Love my Bracelet  Wearing it now
5.0,"I bought this hat for my husband for Christmas and he’s worn it every day since. Fit, style, and sound quality are all great. I really love how the side panel that allows you to control your music actually match  the hat, unlike others that are similar. My husband it amazed he can actually take calls while wearing the hat too. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,"I love this eye glass holder! The magnet is very strong, it is pretty & versatile with the interchangeable pieces!"
5.0,Too cute!!! Shipment was on time.
5.0,These earrings look great .
5.0,They look great. Great accessories for Black History.
5.0,I feel like Pretty Woman when I wear this!!  An amazing value...  Very wrinkled when it arrives....  but toss it in dryer for a bit and it's perfect!
5.0,"This is a really great replacement part that keeps me from having to throw away a perfectly good watch and band.  I'll get several more years out of the watch now!<br />I was able to stretch the new loop over the metal clasp, and didn't need the tool, but I can see how the tool might help too.<br />The new loop is definitely tighter than the loop that came with the original watch, but that's actually a good thing.  The old loop slid around throughout the day, but the new one holds the strap in place securely and won't move.  It's tighter than before, and a little harder to slide in the strap end, but I'll get used to that quickly.<br />The new loop looks very similar to the original loop - the color matches well, and you wouldn't even notice it looks different.<br />The package comes with 5 loops, which seems like overkill considering that these things are not easy to break.  But who knows, maybe I'll need another replacement in a few years, and the price is very low.<br />Overall this is a great replacement that will give my watch several more years of use, and it is well worth the money!"
5.0,"i loved the color, not so common for the winter ootd. i think i ordered 1 size larger but hey, it’s still fine, i still look great on it. all in all, this is a must have specially on snow fall. i would love to have another 1."
5.0,Very original. Beautiful watch
5.0,Love these shorts! Bought for a 90s country night and they were super comfortable.
5.0,It's pretty well made for a quick protection charm.  I like that it is painted on both sides but has the main side more detailed.
5.0,"Nice packaging, excellent leg coverage. Kept me warm on the cold Alaskan winter."
5.0,Would love to buy it again.
5.0,"I was a bit hesitant to get this dress because of some of the reviews and I am glad I didn't listen.  The dress is awesome. Got tons of compliments on it.  This is supposed to fit a bit loose ladies.  I am a size 16 and got the large.  It was perfect.  I probs could have gotten a medium but wanted it a lil loose.  I have a big ole belly and you didn't notice it at all in this dress.  I think it looks best if you have it off one or both shoulders.  Snazzed it up with a long necklace and gold bracelets and boom, out to dinner with my girls.  I think this would compliment anyone but my plus sized sisters, do not be afraid.  Looks great.  I have it in the brown and the black. I just may get other colors."
5.0,"The sweater is attractive and very-well constructed, with soft fleece on the inside and a smooth knit on the outside. The neckline is attractively styled but might allow some cool air to get through when the hood is not being worn. The Sage color is as shown, a nice change from the commonplace bright colors frequently used for sportswear.<br /><br />I was unable to wear the sweater due to the fact that I chose an Extra-Large in my zeal to avoid a tight fit. It looked close fitting in the picture and as I prefer casual clothing to be comfortably loose I went with extra-large. (I found the manufacturer's size guide a bit unusual.) The seller was easy to work with and provided excellent and courteous customer service, facilitating a refund of the purchase price."
5.0,"Wow, these are soft, well shaped and fit well.  I'm a medium but prefer my t shirts not to be skin tight. I ordered a large of these and they are not baggy or floppy. I already ordered more. These are now my go to summer shirt."
5.0,"As a member of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. I am very selective about the paraphernalia that my letters are used on. This watch band is BLUTIFUL!! 💙💛 and the perfect compliment to my new Apple Watch 7. I truly love it. Please let me know if you create any other versions on this band. I will definitely purchase again.<br />I only have one request, that you add a couple more holes on the strap because I have small wrists and the last hole isn’t really tight enough so the Watch spins on my wrist sometimes. But other than that I love it."
5.0,Wore for a wedding! A million compliments! Not too tight - wore all night!
5.0,I bought the purple and it was a beautiful royal purple. The quality was great. I ordered an X large to be safe. I could have ordered a large. The belt in the back helped the fit a lot. I would order again.
5.0,I simply love this bracelet! It is my favorite and I have probably a hundred to choose from everyday.  It is casual but can a add a bit of fun to dressy. it fits perfectly on wrist and I get many compliments when I wear it. The clasp is very secure and I do not worry it may &#34;open&#34; or fail. This would be an awesome gift for any true Boho gal or the younger urban boho chic of any age.
5.0,"This bodysuit is sooooo sexy!! The material is soft and good quality for the price. I feel so sexy when wearing because it really flatters my body shape FYI it DOES run true to size. Usually when I order from amazon I need to size up to medium but for this item I wish I had ordered small instead. Anywho, I still love it and my bf loves it even more than I do ;)"
5.0,I loved it...🥰🥰🥰🥰
5.0,"Love this hat, super cute & colorful!!"
5.0,Great looking and made with great quality
5.0,"Great price and fast shipping!  I love the variety of keys you receive, they are pefect for my upcoming crafts!"
5.0,I used them for Easter &#34;baskets&#34; and they are easily recyclable!
5.0,"Gorgeous blouse, I got many compliments when I wore it to work. The fabric is a little different but nice. The price is also very good. I got the blue one and it looks exactly as in the picture."
5.0,Very elegant bracelet.
5.0,Outfit is super cute and fit perfectly! Both my daughter and I love it!
5.0,"I have a tatoo that matches this toe ring on my ankle.  It is a flora design from a 2600 B.C. funerary carving found in England.  I like wearing toe rings, they make you look like you take care of yourself, and they compliment a wild toe nail polish, not to mention highlight a tan (or lack thereof if that is what you wish)."
5.0,Love it!!! Got a size Medium and I am 5'6 weighing 135 pounds in case that helps anyone and it was a perfect fit!! Love the material it's very well made and it hugs very well all the right places. I can really recommend this product!!!
5.0,"Beautiful color and construction! Very beautiful, especially for the price. Will probably buy another in another color way. :-)"
5.0,"Excellent mask! Fully conceals, and “form fits” so my nose breaths easily through hers!  The hair is full and very convincing in look and feel."
5.0,"With the cost of replacing very expensive car fobs and remotes , it's a no brainer to have them attached to a worry free 100% solid key  clasp. It doesn't hurt to have a very nice looking one to boot. Keys are also very impracticable to replace  easily.<br />Do yourself a favor, gear up!!!"
5.0,I am in love with this dress.  It is a soft stretchy material and the fit is great. I’m 5’8” and 185lbs.  I got the xl and it is perfect.  Definitely going to get more of these.
5.0,They were just for a little gifting at Xmas... cute sturdy broaches... didn't make people uncomfortable to take one... they are perfect 'Bling' at holiday time.
5.0,Love it very nice sexy and it stretch.
5.0,My sister is size 22 but this pants runs a little large in the ankle and the waist. The fabric is good and comfort.
5.0,"My young nieces will love these. I do.  I purchased two of these chains because they are shorter than the ones on the pendants I bought for my young nieces.  I had no idea that they would be so very beautiful and sturdy, much better than the ones that came with the pendants.  They literally glitter.  And. . .,the box chains are so strong that I suspect three and five-year olds will be unable to easily break them. How can they be so reasonably priced?. . .Real sterling priced like cheap silvertone! Oh. . ., and they also arrived in record time."
5.0,"Fits great, well made. Love the color and the way it fits."
5.0,Comfort casual or dressy.
5.0,Daughter loves them. Got white and blue.
5.0,"It's comfortable, but I haven't washed it yet so I don't know how much it might shrink."
5.0,"Amazing dress, especially for the price."
5.0,"A beautiful keepsake. Well made. Deeper consideration should be given to to a better jump ring that connects the lobster claw clasp to the necklace itself. Other than that, well done."
5.0,"Love my dress, fits as expected, comfortable, colors are nice and bright"
5.0,"They work well; grip the shirt tail securely and don't tear the material as some metal clipped versions do. It helps keep my shirt tucked in so I'm not always having to do it in public. Unfortunately, the snug shirt is form fitting, and I don't have a fit form!"
5.0,"Came very quickly, just as stated. Love it. Thank you"
5.0,Looks exactly like the photo. Very well crafted. Looks like it will last many years. Looks real. I walked into Helzberg Diamonds with this ring on and got VIP treatment. Lol
5.0,These are so cute and a great price
5.0,"Got these yoga pants delivered yesterday & decided to wear them today.<br />Love the material, the stretch, the entire feel of these.<br />An extra plus is the pockets!"
5.0,"This dress fits well and doesn't feel cheap at all. It's very comfortable, and the fabric hangs nicely. The fabric and style make this dress one that can easily be dressed up or down with a quick change of shoes and accessories."
5.0,These are so beautiful and wrapped with such care!
5.0,Great flow and pockets!!!
5.0,Got most of the scuffs off my ultra boost heel cap and made them look clean again. It got my boost as white as it could be since boost yellows with time.
5.0,Very pretty with a vintage look.
5.0,"I love my Mopas leggings. I have them in the black with aqua waist (I've had those for over a year, and they are still going strong - except a little fading, but that's to be expected with black yoga pants), and I just bought a pair of navy.<br />It feels like I'm barely wearing anything. I like that the slim leg can fit into my winter boots easily, and they don't get in the way when I ride my bike.<br />I also love the fold over waist - it's so soft and comforting - and totally adjustable for how you like your fit. They are a little long for me, but that's not a big deal as the legs are fitted at the bottom. Just a bit of a scrunch."
5.0,Received thank you. Little one loves it
5.0,I have 2 of these in black and white. Im a tough fit because I’m wide through the shoulders muscular through the chest with a belly. This product worked great for not only the chest area but through the torso. After the wash which tightens it up it’s tough to get on but the binder never tore or lost it’s shape - I’ve torn binders trying to get them over my shoulders as I need them snug for the chest. Never had an issue with this product. Will be buying more for convenience. I’ve had these binders for months and still they are good as new after a lot of abuse and washes !
5.0,"I love it because she loved it as a gift. But she hasn't worn it so I cant tell how warm they are. They are a good fit and true to size, plus they are stylish"
5.0,Not the highest quality but awesome for the price. Ive worn these almost everyday postpartum. Theyer fantastic.
5.0,Very easy to install.  Nice that watch tool was included to assist with the removal of old band.
5.0,I absolutely love my dress.
5.0,"So cute, it look god quality!!!... I hope he like them..."
5.0,Love the nod to labyrinth
5.0,"Every time I try to use a different purse, I keep coming back to this one. If there was one thing I could do to &#34;improve&#34; it, I'd make it open up wider. Other than that, it's perfect and everything I was looking for ♡."
5.0,Very great and stylish watch band/case.! I bought it for my husband and me and him both love it.
5.0,"My husband loves them! He said they are so comfortable right out of the box. He likes the sole - he can wear them outside to get the mail. After buying other slippers that fell apart quickly I tried these. They are night and day better with stronger stitching, thicker materials."
5.0,My guy looks HOT in this
5.0,quick delivery  and 5 minutes or less to install.
5.0,Quality is great! Color true to picture
5.0,"Very comfortable and I love the pockets! Fabric is not cotton, but some mix...rayon? Still love it and it looks great!"
5.0,"I really like the style of this key chain, it is simple and stylish, what's more, the key chain is made of a special material so it can keep its shine for a long time."
5.0,"These are great, they don't slide down on the heal and can't be seen even when I wear my Toms"
5.0,"This is a beautiful scarf; it's lacy and feminine. It's a bit wide, but not too wide to make it &#34;too much&#34; to wear. I really like it. My favorite part is the lace. I highly recommend this scarf!"
5.0,very beautiful and light weight to wear
5.0,"Love this label.<br />Washes, lasts forever, cool in summer and great for travel."
5.0,"The fabric is great, it has a rayon feel to it. The dress is very  A-line, it’s a bit fitted at the very top, then just falls, I love the fit. I bought it for vacation in Aruba, I could definitely dress it up with shoes and jewelry or wear it with flip flops. I got a small."
5.0,"Beautiful color, perfect size, versatility is off the charts. True to size, plenty of pockets, bought it as my go to for trips, picnics or out door events, and overnight bag but now i might just carry her everywhere. Smaller than a 13in mac book, cant wait to break it in because it’s a little stiff. Recommend 10/10"
5.0,"Sunglasses work really well, fit great and look cool!"
5.0,Fantastic !!!! They fit and I'm so happy and now ready for our &#34;Blast From the Past&#34; 70's weekend !!!!<br />Great jeans !!! Good quality !!!
5.0,This fit perfect and was so cute!  The lace made it elegant and the back was so pretty.  My daughter by far had the best looking leotard in class.  I am going to order more.  The quality is also top notch!
5.0,My 16 month old son has been a chunker since birth and his chubby feet don’t go into normal shoes very well - these are a lifesaver for the summer! Well made for the price but just a bit smaller than I think a true to size fit would be. If in doubt get a size up! He runs in them full tilt and they don’t come loose or anything. Excellent value!
5.0,I bought this for my son because he is ALWAYS losing his wallet. He LOVES it!!!
5.0,"WOW!  I was surprised, the quality is on the mark.. The fit is perfect and overall comfort A++."
5.0,"THIS ITEM CAME AS  IT APPEARS ON LINE, AND THE QUALITY IS BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS. I'LL  FOR SURE ORDER MORE IN THE NEAR FUTURE."
5.0,"This is just a fun ring. It’s low profile which I love for glove weather, but large enough to be its own statement piece. Super comfortable for wearing everyday as your own signature piece, but perfect for pairing with but not competing with another statement/stone ring."
5.0,Very heavy sweater and fit perfectly
5.0,"I LOVE this bag!  It is big enough to put all of my personal items, laptop, lunch snack, sweater... It has deep side pockets, an extra pockets inside of the main compartment.  It is easy to maneuver in and out of the car and to and from my desk.  It is also stylist and sturdy.  My favorite feature is that the laptop compartment can detach into a bag with straps for easy transport into meetings are other places where one would not to bring the whole bag.  Previously, I brought a purse, a laptop carrier and my lunch bag to work.  This bag has truly saved my arms and back.  I just can't say enough about it."
5.0,Needed some undies that grew with me An didn’t roll due to my growing belly. So far so good. Love them!
5.0,Look okay for the price
5.0,Beautiful dress and fit.
5.0,I originally purchased these socks as an alternative to my medical compression socks to wear during pregnancy. They have worked great for that purpose and I am looking forward to wearing them during my next marathon training. High quality and true to size 👌🏻
5.0,Little bigger than I thought but LOVE it nice leather
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. Quality metal and the black finish is beautiful. My partner has his D*** pierced and I will be getting another one! If buying these for nipples, make sure to get 2."
5.0,"I just received these and this just might be one of the best purchases I've made? Immediately pleased, even took pictures that I'm generally too lazy to bother with these stay on so well, it's the added prettiness that I hoped for but didn't quite expect. So no show socks aren't supposed to show but they always seem to peek out from somewhere depending on the shoe. With these socks it's a bonus. I took pictures in my shoreline converse and some flats to show you. Also please note that the material is silky soft, the lace is not itchy at all (I was worried) the only thing I would change would be making the bottom a little thicker for my sweaty feet. Ignore the big vein on my foot (apparently I was pumped about these socks Lol)  Honestly these are just perfect. Thanks!!"
5.0,I wish I had sized up for my husband but he still enjoys them!
5.0,"I am very Pease with this company,  good quality dress fits beautifully."
5.0,Such a flattering dress. Have gotten so many compliments.
5.0,This is perfect for what I needed it for... Disney world!
5.0,Our ropes arrived right on time and are perfect! Thank you!
5.0,"The fit and fabric and wonderful,  it washes well. Buying more."
5.0,My daughter loved this as a Halloween costume!  Cozy too!
5.0,"I haven’t been able to find decent tank tops for a long time. For the price, these are a great deal. I’ve bought 2 sets so far and they are holding up well. I am 5’7” and these are long enough to cover the top of my hips."
5.0,"I bought this earring for my wife, to see if pearl looks good on her, she loves it, it looks like real pearl. Really beautiful."
5.0,"I don't like leather watch bands and my Samsung gear classic had one. This replacement was nice, and easy to put on"
5.0,"I really like this shirt! First of all, I really like the material used for this shirt. It is perfect for summer weather and it is comfortable. Because this material does't easily form any creases of that sort, you don't have to worry about ironing it to clean out those lines. A great go to shirt for the summer."
5.0,A GOOD ITEM.
5.0,"Out little dude picked this shirt for his birthday and it arrived better than expected! He loved every detail about this shirt and I loved that not only did it fit him well, but the blue also brightened up his smile. This is hands down one of his favorite shirts right now!"
5.0,Definitely works. And I have a big head!

5.0,"I'm pretty surprised how quick this shipping was I literally ordered these February 21st and got them on the 24th I'm pleased they're all different there is no repeats I got a lot of naughty ones lol.you don't get all the ones that are shown on the picture for those who gave them 1 start because of it there's only like 2 I don't really care for but I'll still use them it's not like I walk around with my tongue hanging out my mouth lol,overall great product and super fast delivery I will be ordering more when I loose all of these lol 👍"
5.0,"Super love this jacket! At first, I was a bit hesitant to order one cause I wasn't sure that it would fit but I just couldn't resist! I'm glad I ordered it though as it fits wonderfully. I usually wear Large or XL jackets depending on the style and the XXL fits me perfectly. The design's amazing! The hood and the inner cotton fabric is detachable so you could dress up or down but personally, I think it looks better with the hood attached to it. This is my favorite jacket at the moment, though it's a shame I don't get to wear it as often as I would like to as I live in a tropical country where it never gets cold! I keep it protected in a suit bag and just pray that it won't peel before I get much use out of it!"
5.0,Excellent quality face covering. High quality visual.
5.0,"Arrived quickly, blue color exactly as shown. Went perfectly with my dress at polo match."
5.0,"Bought these for my little one when she was 1 yr old.  She has been wearing them for 6 months now.  She loves them.  Out of all the shoes, she always pick these ones when we are getting ready to go out.  It seems comfortable on her.  No complaint.  Would like to get bigger sizes for her as her feet grows.  I think we can stick with this brand and style for a while.  Easy to match with her dresses or pants.  We got the light purple and pink ones.  Very girly girl.  Gets lots of complements. Would recommend!~"
5.0,"So comfortable. Not confining, or difficult to put in. Pockets are even great!"
5.0,The straps don't stay up no matter how tight you tie them they just keep falling. Don't waste your money.
5.0,I loved them.  So cute and shiny lol looks exactly like the picture
5.0,"This is a medium size sock.  This is a great sock.  Cool enough for the summer and good enough for a mild winter day for business indoor use, Sunday church, or casual indoor gatherings.  I use a size 8 shoe and this sock fits perfectly.  I didn't know socks for men were actually made that fit smaller feet; plus it is an over the calf sock that stays up!  Wow!  I am very happy.  When needed, I will buy again."
5.0,Very delicate and exactly what I thought it would look like. Chain in very sparkly. I am very pleased with this purchace.
5.0,My grandson loves these and they keep his hands warm and dry in the snow and cold.

5.0,We like the fit of these better than the typical one size fits all compression socks.
5.0,"Bought as a gift for my daughter.  At first I think she wanted thicker scarves, until she wore them.  Light is GOOD because it's wrapped around twice (worn in a figure 8 shape) around the head.  The layers hung so nicely.  Bought 2.  worth the money."
5.0,Very nice small pendant- color of stone nice. Pendant is well made... Delivery was fast.. Price was reasonable. The reviews on it were good...

5.0,It’s worth the money 😍
5.0,I love how this necklace is fun but also great for everyday! Thank you!
5.0,Love them! Bought them in various sizes.
5.0,"I like the lightweight, stretchy material on the Navy blue dress! I feel like this could be easily dressed up or down with different shoes, jewelry,  scarf, or sweater. I work in an office and feel comfortable wearing it there or out with friends. I also hate shopping at stores, so this was great to shop/order online and receive quickly with my Amazon Prime membership."
5.0,"Super cute, great quality headband! Stays in place. Absolutely love it!"
5.0,"For someone with small and medium size glasses, this Case is a gift from heaven.  I hate to say the number of times I have gone to my opthamologist asking for a smaller glasses case, to find they do not carry anything for small and medium size glasses.  I highly recommend this glasses case for anyone like me who was always searching for a case that fits.  I believe you'll find that this case does fit!!"
5.0,This wallet is superior quality. Smooth zipper and removable wrist strap. The inside of the wallet has all the features I am looking for. Everything else works well. Love it.

5.0,"Good quality , very warm"
5.0,Got this for my dad's birthday. Easy to put on and looks awesome.
5.0,Nice picture; good color.  Makes me smile while I work.
5.0,Moon time dress!
5.0,No me lastima nada !!!! Me gusto mucho
5.0,I like. Got a lot of compliments. My sister bought 2 sets
5.0,"Great price, happy with the product, fast shipping."
5.0,Excellent trouser socks and the delivery and packaging was great. Will definitely order these socks again.
5.0,Very comfortable & well-made. So far so good.
5.0,Absolutely perfect! Very sexy and quite dramatic. I ordered a size up and they fit just right without pinching toes (could be a problem if size ordered had been my regular fit)
5.0,I love love this purse. This is my 2nd. Scarleton  purse. You can't go wrong for the price. I got it in Coffee and it is true to the picture.Some people said there was a smell.  There was none with mine. It looks like leather although it is synthetic. The other one I purchased about a year ago and it is still as good as new. It has a zippered pocket front and back. There is a zippered pocket inside and a cellphone pocket and another smaller pocket. It might fit a pair of glasses. I use it for my pen and  a nail file.It is soft sided not formed. which I like. It is very roomy. I carry a lot of stuff in my purses. There was room to carry my tablet and bottle of water and had room to spare.
5.0,"I bought this for a cartilage piercing, knowing that the 14 gauge ring would probably be too thick (it was).  I'm currently using the feather/crystal charm on a 16 gauge ring bought separately (see photo).  It doesn't snag when putting on and taking off hearing protection ear guards all day, and it doesn't bother me when sleeping.  It is a little long, though; perfect shape and classy detail, but definitely NOT unobtrusive.  My husband teases that I've become a punk.  But I like it."
5.0,"When I workout at the gym I want leggings that aren't see through, that don't show every lump and has pockets to store my phone without worrying about it falling out.  These leggings are perfect for that!  They are high waisted and as a short person, that didn't work for me.  The waist came up to my rib/under my breast.  But it was easy to fold the waist down so they fit more comfortably.  These leggings are soft and comfy and stretch well.  I don't feel like I spend my time adjusting them during my workouts.  These are really well made and are a quality pair of workout leggings."
5.0,"Really love this sleep shirt. It is extremely soft and comfortable, easy to wear and breathes well. I also love the color- the pink is super cute, and the style is flattering. It's a sleep shirt, sure, but it's still nice to look cute at the same time!"
5.0,I love these earrings! They arrived very quickly and have just been wonderful! I never take them out. I sleep in them even.
5.0,Love that I can fold it and put in suite case
5.0,These are very sturdy and big enough for adults!<br />Came quickly !<br />Am extremely happy with this purchase!
5.0,"I love these cowboy boots.  I especially love the American Flag belts around the ankle!  This is what sold me.  I have had many pairs of cowboy boots but these are my favorite.  I get so many compliments everytime I where them.  The only thing is that after a while, they hurt my feet but I do have plantar fasciitis, so it could just be me.  I love that they have a heel on them.  I am short and always look for boots with at least a 2 inch heel."
5.0,2nd dress from AX paris and I'm in love.

5.0,Total comfort. Nice style.
5.0,Brought a few hats from Siggi...love this one the most. This hat doesn't have the wire thing around the edge so I don't have to adjust it every times I pull it out of my hand bag. Wish to see the same style in printed fabric.
5.0,"I have bought dresses from rommys collection princess and the bag where the dress comes has had their loggo before, and this one did not have it.  Also dress quality feels different, now I just have the doubt if it’s really from Rommys collection princess dresses."
5.0,Best surf poncho hands down! I use it for spear fishing in California. Makes changing in the parking lot a breeze and keeps me from getting the bone chills from the wind out here. The materials are top quality and its so comfy I could sleep in it. I did a lot of research before purchasing this on amazon and it’s the best one you can get. If your are considering buying do it. Best product for the best price. Great job Voited.
5.0,They customized the corset for me for an extra $20 and it's exactly what I wanted.<br />Really responsive customer service.<br />Overall buying experience was very pleasant.<br />Highly recommend
5.0,"Its slim enough to place in handbag and the hard case protects my reading glasses ,love the  colors!!"
5.0,My wife and daughters love these
5.0,"I love this dress!, It fits perfect, I'm vertically challenged and I don't even have to hem it. I want one in every color."
5.0,These were just adorable and well made for the price.
5.0,Beautiful set.  It looks just as the picture
5.0,Great mask if I could Just get him to keep it on.
5.0,Thanks I like them they fit very well  I thank you very much
5.0,Finally a comfortable sports bra that doesn't flatten you out. I have been looking for a bra I could wear all day for all activities and this fits the bill.<br />I am very happy with my purchase. I plan on buying the white and nude so I can wear them all my outfits.
5.0,Perfect material. Perfect size.
5.0,"I love this shirt! Looks as pictured. The fit is a little snug for a t-shirt, but love the material and the way it feels. If you like your t-shirts big I’d size up one, but if you like them more form fitting I’d stick with the original size you wear. I’m 5’9 190 pounds and ordered an XL for reference."
5.0,"It looks fantastic when you wear it, I have small ears, so I used eyelashes glue to stick it to my ear that way it doesn't fall off even when you dance."
5.0,The old man loves them and has gotten lots of compliments...
5.0,"Very durable, easy to clean, the white doesn’t stain or discolor. I have been getting a lot of compliments!"
5.0,"I bought this as a secret santa gift for one of my employees and she absolutely loved it!  It is, however, made of plastic and the chain broke the second time she wore it (as expected).  But a quick trip to walmart for an inexpensive chain can fix that no problem."
5.0,"I love these lightweight cardigans. They provide coverage and comfort over summer sleeveless outfits which can be handy with the chill of air conditioning at a restaurant or an evening chill on a summer night. The colors are cheery. I bought yellow first, and now I own one in black, white, pink, and red. These are fine knit and do not snag or stretch, like sweaters."
5.0,This fits beautifully!!! I added a silver rhinestone belt. I recommend this dress!
5.0,I was looking for a top with somewhat good compression and this was perfect.
5.0,Has two clasps and the chain is small. The rhinestones are beautiful and looks very cute with anything I wear.
5.0,Like the many adjustment slots!
5.0,"Very happy with the parasol received, it's useful for rainy or sunny days. The medium size is bigger than I anticipated and I would recommend purchasing the small size for personal use. Overall the quality is very sturdy and the parasol has been a nice boon for rainy days or bright sunny days. Just a small detail, the umbrella doesn't provide shade, it dims the sun and protects the skin and eyes from UV rays. Additionally aside from it's usefulness it is also really stylish and light.<br /><br />I recommend buying this product to anyone who is looking for a combination of ; a sun protection parasol, an umbrella for rainy days, a stylish accessory and a parasol that's sturdy and firm. I would suggest for someone looking strictly for 100% shade to seek a different product however.<br /><br />Lastly, I wanted to purchase this from the Brelli website but shipping wasn't available to my country without purchasing from Amazon. I would suggest looking on their website for similar products if it is available in your region."
5.0,Wonderful! It's just perfect. My husband and I are both so pleased with it. The fit is right and the look very professional!
5.0,"My teenage son recently started wanting to do some serious bike riding. He speed skates and was told cycling was good cross training, so I got him this shirt. He really likes how there are pockets in the back. My son is tall and thin and the medium fit him well. It was snug and ideal for bike riding. He really likes this jersey."
5.0,Beautiful and exact like the picture. I just loved it
5.0,Nice product.  Got it to wear at the office where they keep it very cold
5.0,Wonderful selection of masks with a stylish finish.  They are well fitted and I really like my masks with a chin gusset.  I have a small face and really like the masks for dresser occasions.
5.0,"I plan to buy every color of this dress. Truly the best dress I have EVER worn. Looks beautiful and classy and is beyond comfortable. Yep, buying all of them!"
5.0,Larger and heavier then I expected and good value for the price.
5.0,"Okay; so I took a gamble on these jeans.  I'm usually pretty hard to fit; as I am long-waisted.  I'm 5'7"" and appx. 135 lbs.  I ordered the large and the fit is perfect.  I did take the hem completely out after wearing them the first time so that they would be long enough for me to wear wedge shoes.  Now they are just right and have the cool frayed look that is popular now anyway.  I also love the color and the slight stretch to the fabric.  I'm 57 years old so I remember bell bottoms from when I was a teenager and these didn't disappoint!  Plus for the price you can't go wrong."
5.0,"Love this dress, good material, nice tailored fit ! Excellent for the price, will definitely buy again from this vendor. Received several complements."
5.0,"I think this shirt is very pretty. It's soft, quality made, fabric is perfect- not thin or cheaply made- I'm 5'2 and the length is long enough on me that I can easily wear this with leggings for work and it covered my bottom. The color is very vibrant and looks just like the photo. Sleeves are not to loose nor to tight. Great tunic to cover my ""Mom pudge"""
5.0,"I've never seen a real spirit hood in person, but I can't imagine how much nicer they can get!!<br />Colors are beautiful, ears are sturdy, fits my head well (my heads kinda tiny..), and is super cute!!<br />All my friends who have seen it in person fell in love and are considering ordering themselves one!!<br />Love. Love. Love. Especially for the price!!!"
5.0,Bought this for my son for his cosplay . For the price the ring is good. I just wish the latch wouldn’t open so easily with hand movement.
5.0,"I love this dress, it fits perfect for me and true to size. Most comfortable dress. Worth the great price!"
5.0,This was a gift for birthday for someone who grows a lot of sunflowers around her house. She was delighted with the bag! It looked well made & sturdy. Time will tell!
5.0,Omg!!!! These are beautiful!!! Way better I’m person!!! Oh I’m in love

5.0,Feels secure around my neck
5.0,"Used at work, in retail establishment that is considered ""essential"" business.<br />Customers & patients can hear conversations when being serviced.<br />Many positive interactions with both customers & patients.<br />Being ""decorative"" helps soften the interactions."
5.0,"Great idea but these are made from men, they’re very big for women. I have a recommend they try to get smaller sizes. This is a really nice idea for those of us who have leg length disparities. Appreciate somebody working on it"
5.0,Delighted!! Grandson loves the pair!
5.0,Great! Bought as nursing top.
5.0,Fits well. Not heavy or thick.
5.0,Such a beautiful and well made dress. Great material and length. Did a return due to stitching being a tad bit off on upper portion but I do plan ordering another from the same seller in hope's that it is better the the one I returned. This dress is absolutely beautiful and perfect for Spring and Summer. I'm smaller athletic build and average height but bustier on top. Small fit perfectly!
5.0,Accentuates all the curves.  I  love this dress!

5.0,"My mom loved the design, the fabric and the fit.  I liked how the wash and dry.  Color holds and fits great."
5.0,These are still holding up! I was a little worried because of how small they are but I wear them in my second ear piercing often and they look so simple but nice.
5.0,I wore it to the office and was highly commended in it.
5.0,This is very nice for the money; I’ve seen dresses like this going for higher at the shops. I am 5’8” and 170lbs. This is very flowly and loose on me - perfect for lounging around the house and especially by the pool. The material is also soft and comfy. I had ordered a 2nd exact dress because I like it so much!!
5.0,Exactly as presented.Good fit and well made
5.0,I love everything about this shirt. Its feel fit style and the price is right. Lol Oh yeah the packaging says it’s quality and showing the customer their appreciation.

5.0,Love it and it fits as expected
5.0,These are so comfortable I will never go back to wearing a regular type bra.
5.0,Nice quality chain/necklace!
5.0,Bought this for attending a Yankee game. I wear it for golf too. Its a pretty color and looks feminine without being &#34;pink&#34;.
5.0,My daughter wears a size 6 or 28. We took a medium. She is obsessed with this two piece dress. The quality and fit are Amazing!! She couldn’t be happier.
5.0,Can't beat these glasses for the price.<br />Great quality for not high price.
5.0,Vibrant colors and quality material. Fit as expected.
5.0,Soft and drapes well.
5.0,Absolutely excellent. I wish more socks with this level of creativity and affordability existed.
5.0,"I got so many compliments on this dress. I ordered an XL. I'm 5'9&#34; and my pants size is a 14. The XL dress fits perfectly. Beautiful colors, soft fabric. Great Dress"
5.0,Excellent bow tie and I was able to get it last minute.
5.0,Very soft and just the right weight jacket for slightly cooler weather. Nicely made.
5.0,"This dress is absolutely gorgeous. I wore it to a daytime wedding and got many compliments. It was also very comfortable and cool since it was outside in 95 degree weather. The sizing is off in terms of what you are used to ordering, but I followed the size guide and it was spot on. I normally wear an XS/S and ordered the M as the size guide indicated and it fit like a glove. Very pleased with this dress!"
5.0,"These are perfect for walking on grass, brick, stone ...."
5.0,Nice item at right price. Light jacket for coolish times.
5.0,"Have a terrible time finding stylish pants for a tall slim guy, these are perfect!"

5.0,They’re beautiful! Great quality for the price!
5.0,"Had difficulty securing band that came. With the watch—ihave a small wrist. The band was easy to switch out and the magnet is very strong, no dwarf of loosing the watch"
5.0,"Hands on, this is the best pen from Jinhao, maybe from any Chinese manufacturer that I've ever used. Right from the unwrapping, after I cleaned it, inked it, the result was amazing. So smooth, flawless, flowing, wet, and I couldn't believe my luck. If you like light pens, you probably won't like this, but frankly, I like its heft. I plan to order a few more of these.  I didn't have to adjust the nib or the feed. What a buy!~"
5.0,"Finally, a product that fits as it says it should. The Cardigan is a great weight, fits well (I'm 6'1&quot; and with 220lbs) and has good pockets. Looks great as well. In fact, I'm going to buy another one."
5.0,Well constructed and fits properly
5.0,"I wear these tanks under my scrubs at work. I stay on my feet and run around all day, so I needed something that didn’t make me more hot than I already am at work. These shirts are fantastic! I tuck them into my pants and they don’t come out at all. I’m going to buy more now that I know they get the job done."
5.0,Perfect for keeping masks safe.
5.0,These are very stylish and draws attention.  I love them!
5.0,"Hated to even give one star...so disappointed, and I missed the return date by mere days.  Cheap junk. I see many others had the same experience.  Bought two pair.  They looked nice, but the first time worn, they ripped under the back pocket.  Both pair!  Save your money and aggravation...stay FAR away from these.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The problem with the tearing under the pocket has been corrected.  The seller has contacted me several times and wanted to make things right.  He sent two new pairs, free shipping.  So far, they have held up well.  I am very impressed with the seller's kindness and strong desire to have happy customers.  They have achieved this!  Thanks much."
5.0,I really liked the style of this dress.  It did not work out for me because I am large around the middle and it has a definite waiste line but it would be a perfect dress for someone slender
5.0,"I just took this on vacation to Destin Florida and it was perfect. I love all the pockets around the bag. I put sunscreen, suntan lotion, sunglasses, a speaker, my cellphone, 5 beach towels and 3 bottled waters in this bag and it held up well. I will definitely be using for my next beach trip!"
5.0,Amazing.  Love these inserts.  Made my Iron Ranger boots (which felt roomy and hard at times) much more comfortable!
5.0,"I ordered these for a concert and it turned out to be better than I expected. The pair looks great with casual outfits. Of course new shoes always give you discomfort, so make sure to wear high-neck socks and you should be good."
5.0,Love this glasses I keep buying Different styles and 1 is better then the other
5.0,I love these socks I ordered 2 pair one for my Guy friend and one for my guy Bestfriend.
5.0,Great purse used at a wedding I was a guest.  Works for everyday or dressy and has plenty of room.
5.0,"I like this brand because I tried some of others and if the adjustment beads don't slide good, then your tugging at it and it's looks like you're having a fight with your wig.<br />This brand has beads that stay in place, but allow you to slide the beads to adjust to snug up...and to loosen to take them off.  Buy these.<br />My eye glass place can't seem to fit my glasses so they stay up on my nose...so I have implemented this glasses holder.  The adjustment beads have a bit of decoration...so it actually looks kinda designer."
5.0,"You get exactly what you’d expect, very happy with this purchase"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:4d5017417f397b38412895ba15b2a07d]] She says…<br />This is a nice versatile headband. I prefer to wear the knot on the top instead of the wide band on top due to having a small head. All headbands and I have battles, but this one has enough material to play with. Scrunch up the top for smaller heads like mine, or wear the knot on top, either look is cute. This fits our daughter’s head far better than mine and it looks absolutely adorable on her. The material is very soft and the little gold medallion sewn on it adds a nice flare to it.  I think this is nice and fashionable.<br /><br />He says…<br />Headband is a semi silky feeling with stretchy material and is lightweight. The headband is 7” wide at its widest point and has a bow like area on the narrowest part. Nice feel overall.<br /><br />We received a product discount for testing and review purposes."
5.0,I bought this watch from a jewelry store last year and returned it because of the price.  It is incredible to see this watch again at such a steal of a price.  I told my spouse that I wanted this for my birthday this month and I can hardly wait to open it!!  The pictures do not do it justice.
5.0,Bonita sencilla y cómoda
5.0,"This is my 2nd separate order of these shirts and for the money you really can't beat it, my last set I ordered for work held up nice for about 3 years, so I'm purchasing again!"
5.0,"Great adhesive and comes with a cute case. Was gonna give a 4/5  because the material is thin, but great backles/strapless bra, regardless. (And some people might want a thin material.)"
5.0,Will definitely buy another one
5.0,"This is a perfect spring/summer bolero for those who prefer to keep their arms covered or need a little extra warmth.  Incredibly well made and lovely.<br />  Not made for heavier arms though, they are rather narrow in circumference"
5.0,"Super comfy, but a little wide"
5.0,Love these tops! Love the flow around the waste.
5.0,From just a Regular earing these start Exactly were I wanted. These are PERFECT!!<br />EXACTLY as Described and arived Early ♡♡
5.0,Well built. Love it!
5.0,I love very high quality.
5.0,"This watch is a looker. It's easy on the eyes and it's very beautiful. Can't believe I got this for $68 with synthetic sapphire crystal at that. It's also big as in huge. It occupies the width of my wrist but I like it that way. Walking around town, I can see people looking back at it especially since I got my black mask on my face , LOL. Anyway,  for $68, it's a no brainer!"
5.0,I love all these bracelets
5.0,"Super cute, comfortable, sleek material. Sizing is pretty spot on!"
5.0,It's a little sexy but cute.
5.0,"This is a super cute sweater and well made.  I ordered a small, which is very petite, but fits well."
5.0,Products as expected. Thank timely delivery.
5.0,"I got this dress in the multi gray and I absolutely love it and receive lots of comments on how cute it is when wearing it.  It is flattering, not a super high neckline and not super low either, and it's very soft.  Plus it isn't see through!  I am 5'6 and 150 pounds and it fits perfectly.  I am able to wear flats or wedges with it.  The length is perfect for either.  It may be kind of long for someone shorter though but it looks cute with a little tie at the bottom to solve that problem for anyone it is too long on."
5.0,"Love this sweatshirt!!! Fit is perfect and it’s comfortable. This is a thinner sweatshirt and it’s not fuzzy inside. For size reference I’m usually a Large to an XLarge. I’m 5’2, 180lbs and wear a jeans 14. I am a 38DD bust and waist is 33 inches. The XLarge fits perfect!"
5.0,"I love these shoes! A friend of mine bought the exact same pair from another website (for considerable more money too) and when they were out of my size, I went on a hunt to find them somewhere else. I was able to find them here and for a great price! They are versatile and warm."
5.0,This purse is light weight and roomy.  I also bought this in the pink canvas.  I'm used to leather hobo bags and this is so much nicer to haul around during the summer.  I think I'll get this in another darker color for the winter.  Great purses!
5.0,Fit as expected and well made
5.0,Nice size not too big et bright colors. Fits charm bracelet perfectly
5.0,THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!
5.0,"I was skeptical at first but once I received the dress I was happy that my daughter loved the dress. Not because I bought her something but for the price this dress was a steal. Strong stitching, cotton material with proper color dye and fitting which was perfect. I would definitely recommend buying this dress as it's worth every penny."
5.0,"Beautiful color. Be ware, these will pill even washed on cold gentle cycle. I’ve had to shave the pill balls but over all, good quality. I’m 6’ plus size 16-18 top, and the 2xl works fine. I honk they run a tad small and won’t shrink."
5.0,exactly what I needed and wanted. Soft material
5.0,"I have arthritis, as does my 92-year-old aunt.  I bought one of these for each of us.  The up-down feature is wonderful and easy for each of us to use.  The colors are exceptional.  The umbrella is very sturdy, we've already pitted it against G-force winds behind her apartment building.  I have no complaints and the price was very reasonable!"
5.0,Perfect for tennis shoes!
5.0,It's beautiful! Great quality!
5.0,"The material is thin but very opaque. Very nice quality, just the right size pleats! I ordered it for a cosplay but I'll be wearing it casually as well! I can tell it's well put together."
5.0,"Needed a bag for a wedding that would hold my cell phone 8, tissues, wallet, glasses.  This fit the bill and was reasonable priced"
5.0,Nice watch for a great value
5.0,"I'm allergic to fake metals, so I have to get the nicer stuff. Highly recommend this brand. Very nice."
5.0,My grand baby looks soo cute in this outfit love it

5.0,"Love this bag, perfect color, great size good quality"
5.0,So cute and light weigh!
5.0,Looks great on my keys
5.0,"I bought according to the size chart & the dress was at least one, if not two sizes too big, but it's a great dress,<br />Very well made, great fabric, very nice style, the fabric is stretchy, but has a good weight. Not see see thru at all! Falls very nicely. It is very roomy in the bust. I am going to reorder in another size."
5.0,"I was looking for a bag big enough to fit all the stuff I bring when we go to the swimming pool with my kids and it is perfect!<br />Big and with interior pockets, which is a definite plus. The material which is made of seems to be waterproof or at least will dry quickly.<br />I love it!"
5.0,Love love love this too!  It’s soft and flowy and exactly what I was looking for!  Super cute and flattering!!!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:3c2c25556b91dcd08d1655fba2cf6acc]] I love how light and durable the frames are I love the detailing the gold on black absolutely beautiful<br />⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5.0,Loved it so cute for grandson
5.0,"Received as a Christmas gift and this is a very nice purse.  Conceals handgun with easy accessibility, purse is roomy inside and very sturdy"
5.0,They are awesome work gloves. I don't have any complaints.
5.0,"My favorite hat! Warm, comfortable and good-looking!"
5.0,"The tank top feels heavier and thicker than I thought - but in a positive way. You have a feeling it is a good and long lasting quality. I am 5'7"" and ca. 140 pounds and the size M fits as a glove! It is very flattering. A great tank top to your shorts or jeans!"
5.0,These are cute t shirts. True to size. My daughter loves them!
5.0,its amazing my boobs a little big for the cups but over all its comfortable and i might get another except different color. the only thing i didnt favor was the shipping price lol. but technically i save $4more instead of going to hottopics.
5.0,I bought a Lg should have gotten an XLg. Im size 10 jeggings at AE and a Lg on top
5.0,"This is exactly what I wanted. It came earlier then expected, received four days from order/purchase day. Color is true to display and has the soft lining inside. I’m 5’1” and 120 pounds so I bought a small, it doesn’t look/feel big or overly lose."
5.0,I love this dress. Quality is more silky than cotton which I was expecting but still i love it. It looks great.
5.0,I love this shirt.  It is so comfy and soft and casual.  My favorite top right now.
5.0,"I LOVE this costume...with one change. I wear plack leggings under it and wear it as a shirt. I borrowed a friends costume, it was a large. I LOVED how it fit but the sleeves were too small for my batwing arms to fit comfortably. So I ordered the xl on line. My arms fit well now but because I'm a little (a lot) bottom heavy, the top was very loose. I plan on wearing a tank top under the shirt, so it's not a big deal. The XL is longer than the L is so the XL covers my butt more. I am including a picture of me wearing the L size. (because I ordered the XL after halloween) I would NOT wear this as a dress unless you plan on flashing everyone, but I'd order it again for sure!! (I'd probably get the large next time and alter the sleeves.) This costume also came with a wand and HP style glasses. The legs of the glasses were on upside down but I fixed it. Super easy! This is a GREAT buy!!"
5.0,I ordered these phone covers because you got a variety of colors and the price was unbeatable.  These covers fit nicely and are pretty durable.  I recommend these covers to anyone with this phone.
5.0,"Gave this to our pastor, pastor appreciation month, looks awesome. God bless"
5.0,"Perfect size, and makes the Blaze look so much more like a normal watch. Thanks so much!"
5.0,Exactly perfect for what I need them for . Keeps my hands warm and leaves my fingers free
5.0,Even better than expected!
5.0,I bought 2 other brands and one velcroed to itself and snagged so bad I threw it away. The next one was so thick that I was hot and sweaty before I could even comb my hair. This was one perfect. It doesn't stick to the waffle weave sturdy fabric and its light weight. I also love that the velcro wasn't just white. It was the fabric color. I ordered another one just because I loved it so much.
5.0,"These pants are fantastic! Fit great, well made, and the heathered brown color is lovely. After my first pair of 90 Degree I've sought out more and now have a whole bunch of them."
5.0,Really helps hold battery tight in charger!
5.0,nice quality! Perfect for the just starting to walk or stand baby!
5.0,Great product and delivery. I recommend this for everyone. The fit is great and the quality appears to be fine so far.
5.0,Loved it! Good material true to size looked beautiful on!
5.0,Very comfortable! Perfect for all seasons!
5.0,"I love how tight and loose you can make this pumping strap. It is highly adjustable and can fit numerous sized breasts. It is perfect for wall pumps or any pumps with flanges but is not meant for wearable pumps such as s12,s9,s21. Comes with straps if you’d like the extra support for around your neck/shoulders. I’m bigger breasted and it worked beautifully for me"
5.0,Love love love ! Perfect size for work. I can fit everything inside even my laptop. Plus it looks really high fashion
5.0,Love this skirt!!  Wish they made it in navy!!
5.0,Very cute key chain
5.0,Fantastic! Love them
5.0,Daughter loves this gift
5.0,Fits good but shoulder straps are big they fall down but very cute on my granddaughter
5.0,This turned out far better than I expected and my daughter loves it
5.0,I purchased this hat so my glasses would be protected from the rain.  The plastic shield does a good job.  I also like the drape down the back of the neck .
5.0,Awesome experience
5.0,Great Soccer keychain.
5.0,"High quality.  Great yoga, or low impact support if you have a larger chest.  Lovely, unique, color (dream blue)"
5.0,I bought this to serve as part of a Kali costume for Halloween. (I never wear large jewelry). The quality far surpassed what I expected. It is an awesome necklace! I think I will actually be able to wear it for more events. Very pleased.
5.0,"Bought them for protection against puppy wounds ...<br />works ... I bruise easily, and bleed when punctured ...<br />These are great !<br />You try teaching your puppy to fetch then drop .....<br />I highly recommend"
5.0,"My fiance' lives in the gym and she hated not wearing her engagement ring while she was there, and I wasn't too thrilled about her beating up something that cost thousands of dollars.  This was a great little &#34;just because&#34; gift that she loved.  Very cool ring and DuePunti makes it in about a million colors."
5.0,I love how this strap stays put no matter what.  It's the only brand I have found that doesn't slide off my head during workouts!
5.0,Very nice little dress ...<br />Nice color...fast delivery...<br />Thanks
5.0,Love this! Sweat sweat sweat! Targets your abs and thighs at the same time. Easy to use.. fits perfectly! Individual results will differ!
5.0,I our purchased for my husband. The glasses are comfortable and yet stylish.
5.0,Great shirt size maybe on the smaller side soft material nice quality product!
5.0,Very soft and stretchy!
5.0,"I read the reviews and ordered a size up and i love this dress! It fits well and is flattering.  Very functional! I have a hard time finding nice dresses to nurse in, so this one is a great find!"
5.0,I liked the shawl a lot
5.0,"Material is thick enough to where it's not see through. Very soft. I'm 5'6, 185lbs, fit perfectly. I didn't have to squeeze myself in them. Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Love these capris, although they come to my ankles! I am really short (5’), and they did not come in a petite size. I like them at the ankle. They fit well, and will be perfect for chilly weather. I will wear them to and at my gym."
5.0,"These are good shorts for working out if you want to have your phone with you, but not disrupting you.  An iphone will easily fit in the pocket that sits against your thigh.  It will not fit in the zipper compartment on your hip.  There is a little bounce, so I wouldn't go for a long run with my phone in the pocket, but it is great for the gym, errands, walking, etc.  They are good to wear for a long run, but not while carrying your phone in the thigh pocket."
5.0,Absolutely love!!! Super cute!! Good quality! The tail is thin so I’ve been careful not to damage it.
5.0,Better than I expected  so soft and fits perfectly my 9 month baby girl
5.0,"I love this adorable Mummy tote bag! It holds a lot, and is very durable. I got a lot of compliments on it during the Halloween season!"

5.0,Was a gift but she didn't like them I guess because the colors .
5.0,Love the dress...I have seven of them to wear at home fir comfort.  Just wish they were a bit longer
5.0,"Comfortable, cute and has pockets. Good buy!"
5.0,I ordered these earrings to make small little cross necklaces from each one of them.  The biblical words have<br />folks looking to see what is written.  As pendants or earrings they are beautiful and a good buy.
5.0,These got to me SO fast! I was surprised to see them just a few days after purchasing. They were exactly as pictured and fit like a Moonie's dream.<br /><br />Thanks!!
5.0,"I like how soft and comfortable the material feels like. What's more important, this set fits me perfectly, especially the length and the shoulder fit, almost feels like it's tailor-made for me :) This kinda of fit is quite rare for clothing items I didn't get a chance to try on before buying, I guess it's due to good design and choice of material. I'll come back for more for sure."
5.0,Overall I definitely like these boots. They seem very sturdy and the fur is very soft. Although the fur doesn't line the entire inside of the boot. It only goes about halfway. Re-lacing them took a while but it is worth it. I'm looking forward to wearing them out.
5.0,It is a nice suit.  I just ordered a size a little too big for me.
5.0,"This will be a practical accessory. There are many different patterns and colors. Although the prices may be higher compared to other wallets and purses, Anuschka hand painted accessories are unique. There are many paintings in the Anuschka lines. It is art to go in the with unique art and colors."
5.0,Very comfortable wish it came in more colors
5.0,I really love this purse!  It is a very pretty pink.  I have had so many compliments on it.  The leather is so soft and easily cleanable.  It is the perfect size to fit my new 8&#34; tablet.
5.0,"Got them as a gift for my mother's boyfriend, who has plantar fascitis. He finds them difficult to wear, but in a good way. They feel therapeutic for him, and he has experienced relief (and regained some sensation!) after periods where he wears the sandals for as long as he can handle."
5.0,"Stunning on my daughter, she really likes it!"
5.0,Cute necklace for a little girl.
5.0,Great product.<br />Fits well and looks cool. I really liked the fitting of these glasses.<br />I would recommend these glasses for hot summer days and beach days. Looks cool on beaches.
5.0,GREAT TASTING!! I'm so glad I got this jerky. It came so fast and the fast. I got the original and it was delicious. I will be ordering more. Wish they would sell other deer stuff like burgers and sausage.
5.0,Great price! My daughter loves them!
5.0,My wife loves this ring! She wears it daily and it looks just like the picture.
5.0,Much bigger then expected but totally adorable!!
5.0,Our friend a bee keeper LOVED this gift. Comfy and roomy by design.
5.0,Me agrado la confección muy cómodo y super bueno
5.0,"I bought it for my mom, now I’m ordering one for myself 😋"
5.0,"I have to smile as I notice that user Vanity507 said exactly what I want to say in her review from January 9, 2016.<br /><br />I am only writing one review as I ordered the blue and the pink<br /><br />I too purchase this blouse to add to my work wardrobe as I thought it would work well alone or under jackets/cardigans.I was really happy to see that when I received the product it looked exactly like the picture.<br /><br />I would recommend however ordering 2/3 sizes up from whatever size you initially wear, I ordered one size up and was a little disappointed it wasn't oversized but instead it just fit me a little snug.  I have however size lost a few lbs (yeah me) and it fits nice. I wear the shirt as is or under a jacket/cardigan for work. The shirt is very versatile and was definitely a wonderful addition to my closet."
5.0,"Wow, super fit and comfort. Styling is great because they are not clunky at all or flimsy either."
5.0,go for it.. i have tested it and passed all the test to defer it from all the fake Casios
5.0,Perfect for my husbands' Red Wing boots!
5.0,Nice wears well cute gift idea and great price
5.0,"Edit: Not sure what is going on with this listing. I purchased earrings and my review is for earrings, but when I click on the link, it's for a completely different item.<br /><br />Original review:  These are a bit smaller than I expected, but they are beautiful! I'm very pleased with this purchase!"
5.0,"I love everything about these masks, but I only received 5 of the 6… 🙁 not sure how to contact retailer about this."
5.0,"Great quality, fits very well. Let’s see if In the long rung will last."
5.0,"My boyfriend normally wears a 2x, after reading the other reviews we decided to size up and ordered a 3x and it fit him perfectly! He said the jersey was comfortable."
5.0,"The sweatshirt is more lightweight then I expected.  It’s great for a cool day, however on a cold day it might not keep you warm enough.  However, the colors are outstanding!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:39bdd3c78759d0eec435cf0ac057c976]] Very happy with this shirt and shorts. The material is terrific and the ways its put together even better.<br /><br />I ordered the large and typically wear tighter fitting clothes either a size medium or maybe a large.  But for a  looser fit for warmer climates, went with the large.<br /><br />Fits great. The shorts have an elastic waste plus draw string. The elastic fit without tightening the draw strings felt about perfect for my waste (typically I wear a size 32 or 33 waste in jeans, measure out at 35-36 inches with a tape). These could have easily and comfortably fit if needing to stretch more. I don't think I'd recommend a Large in the shorts for anyone with a smaller waste than my own.<br /><br />This is probably going to look best after pressing or having it dry cleaned even."
5.0,Very comfy. Good material. Not too thin.
5.0,They arrived & are very pretty & in good condition<br />Definitely giftable
5.0,I have tried it on but not actually worn it for a period of time yet. I really like the way it feels and looks. I am 5’4” tall and weight is 140. It’s length is just above my knees.
5.0,"Love that these pants fit like yoga pants (elastic at the waist), but look professional with belt loops. Great fit too!  I normally wear between a 10 and 12 and I ordered the XL and they fit amazing!"
5.0,"My husband loved the material, said he wants me to buy more but in different colors, if they have them. The fit was perfect on him. Highly recommend."
5.0,These shoes don't fit at ALL!!! BUT I did get a totally cute purse out of the deal so I'm happy.  It's a little than I thought but not by a lot- just enough for me to fit everything I need in it.  Great buy.  10/10 would recommend.
5.0,Very cute and different!
5.0,"Beautiful, elegant and sexy as hell! Loved it, got so many compliments,  the only down side is that it itches like crazy! But I still give it 5 stars."
5.0,This outfit is super cute I get lots of compliments on it the only thing is if you have a more petite toddler like I do the straps can fall down but we just got a piece of ribbon and when she wears the outfit we just tie the straps together in the back so that way it stays up and she’s more comfortable!
5.0,I love the bamboo fibers used in these sox. They fit great and keep moisture away from your feet.
5.0,Looks great and well made for costume....shipped fast
5.0,"Comfortable well fitting and warm socks, yet cool to feet."
5.0,Fue un regalo y la persona le encanto!!!
5.0,Gorgeous piece of jewelry! Very well made! LOVE LOVE LOVE!
5.0,love them so soft will reorder them
5.0,Finally got it. It's real pretty.
5.0,"Torege sports sunglasses.<br /><br />As an avid fisherman, I go through a lot of glasses. From expensive wiley x to your cheap wally world clearance ones. I tend to favor ones right around this items price point, because I spend a lot of time in my kayak in the saltwater.<br /><br />These glasses arrived in an awesome hardcase. It is tough. Now, it's a bit big....because it also houses the extra lenses, but it isn't overly so. I quickly swapped the lenses out from the regular shades to the polarized ones, as this is what is most important to me.<br />I will say here that the lenses were fairly easy to replace, and felt secure when fitted in.<br />Now, I'm not a fan of this STYLE of shade at all really. I prefer bottoms on my lenses. But they fit well and looked alright. As luck would have it, I was going out bass fishing the next morning. Perfect .<br />These glasses were great. While not s sharp and my glass Hugo Boss prescription glasses ,  obviously, their polarization was awesome and they were so light and comfortable that there were times I forgot I was wearing them.<br />I'm excited to have them, and I believe they will become my new kayak glasses!<br />Well worth the money!<br /><br />I recieved these as part of a group discount in return for my honest review. I read no other reviews before or during my purchase"
5.0,These are really cute.  I gave these out at my daughters birthday party and she uses them to wear when we go out.
5.0,"As other reviews mentioned, the back flaps don't lay as cute in real life as they do on the model, but I still like the top a lot. It's a thicker cotton, high boat neck that still hides bra straps, sleeves are long enough, and the shape is a little boxy with closed zipper but it works well as a comfy work top for me. If you're looking for a sexier fit or emphasizing curves, try sizing down with the intent of having the zipper open like the model."
5.0,"Fits great, comfortable and top quality item. Shipped as expected. Not sure why the black and beige are so different in price but they are the same,"
5.0,"I love these pants. They are super cozy, soft and stretchy for the price. The material is perfect, not too thin and not too thick. Would buy again in other colors."
5.0,"Fits perfectly,  thank you."
5.0,"I normaly don't order dress shirts online because I'm wide shouldered and I never know if they will be too tight across the chest and shoulders. But this shirt is true to size and fits like the rest of my XL shirts. Im 5' 10"" and 185 pounds.<br />I obviously just pulled this out of the package so it has the fold wrinkles still but it lays realy nicely and doesnt show my mommy gut hiding under their. The fabric is thin but well made. It feels comfortable and not restricting. Best of all its  ot crackly or scratchy material and feels nice. Im pleased I ordered this."
5.0,Great socks!  I bought these cute socks as a gift for a baby that is just beginning to walk and had them direct shipped.  They were delivered today and the mom was so excited!  She loves the socks and she also commented on how nicely they were packaged.  Great product! Hassle free transaction!
5.0,"I liked the bracelet very much, it arrived on time.  I got two compliments on it.  It matched my lapis earrings and necklace very well.  I was glad I purchased it.  The price was very reasonable.  I would recommend it to anyone thinking about buying one."
5.0,"They look real cute on me, nice on my complexion and love the color"
5.0,This is a great crossbody wallet purse that actually fits my checkbook and iPhone X. Love it
5.0,Very cute not too thin perfect for this AZ weather!
5.0,"I love this dress! After reading some reviews, I decided to go down a size and get a small instead of a medium. I am 5'3"" 145 and 34D but steadily losing weight so I went with a small. It fits great, hugs all my curves, and fits well at the bust. Material is nice, not see through, and color is same as pictured. Debating on whether or not to alter it to make it a tad bit shorter. As for the bra situation, I recommend gaffers tape and taping the girls in place, it works wonders when wearing dresses like this where you can't wear a bra but want more support than pasties can offer."
5.0,"The fit was good, and the colors are perfect for Fall!"
5.0,"This scarf is beautiful!! The colors are vibrant and it’s super soft...I can’t wait for the weather to cool down again, because I’ll use this thing all the time."
5.0," <br />This little romper is 1) definitely little and 2) definitely cute. I am so obsessed with this. It's really perfect for a beach day or just when you want to be cute but comfortable. To get it to the length in my photos I adjusted the straps, which I didn't know was possible until the romper came in the mail. It's still perfect, though. I'm 5'5&#34;, a 32A and about 120lbs.<br /> <br /> <br /> "
5.0,Size perfect fit perfectly what a bargain.@$5.99
5.0,They are a great size
5.0,Supporting my Father going through stage 4 cancer!
5.0,"This is amazing, better than the photo. Would buy again it's heavy and the crystals are on all sides even the bottom. This is the first brand I'd go to for a clutch, easily. Beautiful, wore to swan Lake ballet"
5.0,Love this company! Their glasses are affordable and GREAT QUALITY. Stylish as well :)
5.0,"Preggie Naturals chews significantly helped my wife with pregnancy morning sickness. You also get more chews ordering here vs buying in the store at Target. She enjoyed each of the flavors, but the green ginger chew was her favorite."
5.0,It was a Christmas gift and she loves them and looks great in them ♥️
5.0,"Bought these to have extra panties for before and after having a baby. They are comfortable and stretchy and fit as expected. The colors I bought (red,black,grey,white,b&wstriped) were perfect for me. Great deal for some quality underwear."
5.0,I bought these because it seems like every store under the sun now has their own rewards cards and I had so many of them I couldn't keep track of them. These turned out to be just the thing I needed. The plastic is thick enough that it has held up to my regularly putting things in and taking them out again without tearing. The plastic is clear so that I can easily see and identify quickly which cards I need.
5.0,"Love these! They are trendy and not expensive, I recently had lasik so my eyes are more sensitive to light and these work great. I greatly recommend them"
5.0,This was a gift for a very dear friend- HE LOVES IT!<br />I may have to get him another one and put it away for his birthday!
5.0,They are just great and very affordable!
5.0,"Finally got these today!! They are amazing quality. I got the 3 pack. I tried one on it is extremely comfortable, and they look great."
5.0,"great tank no bra cup support, so let it hang, but does offer mild support.  personally, i don't always like to wear a bra and have the inpingement.  so this is perfect for those days."
5.0,Purchased as a gift. But it is beautifully done. Soft and feminine. I believe she will be happy.
5.0,"It keeps my keys organized & prevents them from clanging against my steering column, which was my goal.  I also like that it can hold credit cards & some folding money.  I like the way it looks & is easy to find in my purse."
5.0,This bag lives up to the ad - heavy duty fabric and great size.
5.0,Beautiful purse love it
5.0,Love the item stylish and appropriate for my job
5.0,It's a nice simple long-sleeve T that's not too loose or too tight.  (I have small boobs so i wish it was a bit more fitted in the chest/armpits but probably no one else notices).  The fabric isn't super thick but it's not ultrasoft (it doesn't need a second layer).  It's the perfect T for putzing around town or laying on the couch or hiking.<br />i'm REALLY happy with my purchase!
5.0,"This Palmoro hat is a great hat for the money.  The straw is very tight and i anticipate many golf rounds this summer with this hat.  A great purchase would expect this quality on a much more expensive straw hat.<br />The size fit perfectly and should remain size consistent over the life of the hat.<br />I will buy another at the end of the summer, just so i have a replacement, when i need one."
5.0,"I ordered this dirndl not knowing what to expect in the size I ordered(size 6) since that is not my usual size (size 8 or 10).  However, the dirndl fit perfectly.  I couldn't ask for a better fit.  Follow the sizing table and you will not go wrong."
5.0,I've gotten many compliments for it.
5.0,"This aging metalhead approves. Good quality, great price."
5.0,"This sports bra is really cute and supportive.  I was a bit caught off guard by the logo on the front, but it's clearly there in the product photo, so that was just something I didn't notice when I purchased it."
5.0,"My husband loves his. Comfortable, and toes stay in."
5.0,Bought one size larger and fits perfect. Stretches and clings in all the right spots. Looks great on. Heavy material not a summer dress. Great quality.
5.0,Beautiful 🤗
5.0,Loved the floral print and the fabric. Such an easy travel dreas
5.0,I usually wear a large size and this one fits as expected. It did not shrink or pill after washing/drying.
5.0,I love it but i can't get it on the bracelet :(
5.0,"great hat , this is my second hat , very comfortable ans warm."
5.0,Perfect fit for me! Love It!
5.0,Cute Shirt but I bought size 3-4 and it was huge on my oldest who wears size 6x. Large armpit holes as well. Hoping it may shrink up
5.0,"I loveee these pants!! I ordered a size small, and I’m 5’3, around 130 ibs, short torso, I’m mainly legs, and I have a small-medium sized bum. I’m not thick but I’m toned, and these pants are great for complimenting your body type!!! I love how the color is nude too so it will suit a variety of different outfit combinations! I don’t think a medium would have hurt me if I wanted it a little more baggy, but the height and the way the pants fit me in a size small are pretty comfortable enough. I was hoping for it to be more baggy, but I still like the way these look. If I ordered a size medium I’m afraid it might be too long. So the small did me just fine. I will add if you do have a bigger bottom that’s when you would definitely need to size up at least one size than ur regular. These pants don’t stretch too much. Overall, They’re adorable! I just want to add it’s twice as cute with the belt that comes with it! I’d say it’s worth the money."
5.0,"I bought this for my fiancee because he hates carrying wallets around. He finds them to be bulky and annoying. When he goes out he only carries his ID, credit card, and a bit of cash, so this was absolutely perfect for him. There is a slim extra pocket area in the middle split of the card case which is great when you get a business card or need to carry your business card around. This was a great buy for a simple guy like him."
5.0,Very comfort on head.
5.0,I don't know how they make the picture so real. Very pretty jewelry.
5.0,Look sharp wearing these glasses. Had no snow glare when on the mountain and they fit tight so they don't fall off when you bend over.
5.0,I JUST LOVE THE GRACE KARIN LINE.  MY GO TO FIRST WHENEVER I NEED A FANCY SCHMANCY LOOK
5.0,Wide ties are the best for tall men that likes Windsor knots.

5.0,Good looking belt and I believe it will hold up well over time and use
5.0,Wife loves it. Fits just right.
5.0,She liked it. Very pretty.
5.0,"This dress is absolutely stunning<br />I purchase it to attend an african wedding and it did not disappoint.<br />I am 5' 11&#34; and the length is as shown in the picture, the back of the dress was exactly at the heel.<br />The material is amazing (not thin) and the dress is layered for added texture.<br />I recommend it without any reservation, for the price it is a deal of a buy."
5.0,I would recommend this product to anyone. Its beautiful and the price and perfect for the dress and it fits perfectly. Thank you.
5.0,Came on time/as expected.  Daughter loves them.

5.0,My 16 year old daughter uses the pendant on these for the pendant on her hemp necklaces and she gets so many compliments when she wears them! They're really striking to look at in person!
5.0,"Got this for my husband and he loves it. The fabric is soft, which was a must. He’s stinking tall (6’4”) and skinny. Definitely make sure to wash before use. But amazing and I love the logo!"
5.0,"I liked this watch from the time I opened the box.  The dial is very easy to read and the watch band fits me well.  I have a large wrist.  It has the three things that are most important to me in a watch.  The time, the date and the day of the week.  Sometimes I'll forget if it's Tuesday or Wednesday, so this helps me out, too.  I would buy this watch again and I think it's money well spent."
5.0,This watch is amazing for the price definately recommend it
5.0,Worked great traveling to London!
5.0,These were not shoes but the lenses are awesome..
5.0,Really liked all the plane could have even been more
5.0,"I bought six of these for my nieces for Christmas. They are well-made, cozy fleece, and the best part is they have pockets. My nieces loved them."
5.0,"Love the scarf, it's thin but fluffs up very nicely and looks great on."
5.0,"Love, love this small compact wallet. It carries everything that I  need. I love the color, the material and the fact that can I can put my coins in the back pocket.  It is exactly whybrid I loved it. I also bought one for my daughter and she loves it."
5.0,Love the print and the fact that it is waterproof.
5.0,"I ordered 1 size larger, 2 sizes might have been better. otherwise, seemed well made and very soft."
5.0,Casual and comfortable! Nice medium weight.
5.0,This is a nice large bag that is durable and easy to clean or wipe.  Made of a nice nylon material with sturdy zipper and handle construction.
5.0,"Got this as a gift for my dad who is 1) a navy veteran, and 2) has a history of skin cancer on his face. He loves the hat and so does his dermatologist!!!!!! Great quality hat!"
5.0,Best shoes for me!  I have three of these BOBS slip on shoes now.  They are so comfortable and so cute! I love them.  I have the pink with little kitties on them. The dirty pink with cherries on them and these with the big cat heads on them. I'll probably get another pair before they are all gone.
5.0,Awesome colors look great
5.0,A Xmas present from my Son to his Grandma
5.0,Thank you for making such a beautiful product at a decent price rate.
5.0,happy with this wasn't clingy
5.0,These are absolutely adorable! The packaging was very classy. My son loves them.
5.0,I usually buy cheap beanies and hats on sale so I decided to treat my 12 year old to a nicer one. This beanie is very cool (according to his 16 year old brother) and looks very good quality! I just hope he doesn't lose it because I'll be very sad. I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
5.0,Love love love! Ordered a pair for my sister too!
5.0,"Im inlove with this earrings. At first I was worried to buy this because it is cheap and simple. I thought I wouldnt like it. But when I got it, it is more beautiful than other earrings that I bought with a beautiful designs in the picture. I guess I will never depend on the picture again. I will surely order this for myself since I order this for my usherettes as a gift."
5.0,"Great quality product, love it!"
5.0,"My daughter absolutely loves this shirt. I think she would wear it every day. Love the color, love the fit and style."
5.0,I really like this key chain wristlet. It's even cuter than the pic. The colors are vibrant and it's put together well.
5.0,Showed up on time. Fits awesome. My most favorite hat
5.0,"Bought this dry back to use while snorkeling on a cruise.  The weather was to rough so the boats couldn't go out, so didn't get to test the waterpoof-ness of the bag.  I will say it feels really well made, bright colors and the backpack like straps were a welcome surprise.  I didn't know the phone case was coming with it either so was nice to have.  Plan on using both when we go to the Keys this summer."
5.0,These gloves fit perfect as I did the measurement chart they gave.
5.0,These are very comfortable and doesn’t ride down I love them
5.0,U love this watch and have gotten loads of compliments about it. Light weight and beautiful color. Love it
5.0,"Ordered this thinking it wouldn't provide as much warmth as it does. It breaks the wind amazingly well and I throw a hat on top of it. It stays snug to my head and face not moving, when you have the face mask up your breath keeps your face warm without generating a large amount of moisture. Shipping was extremely fast and would most definitely recommend this to anyone I work with or for just going out to shovel snow."
5.0,"Sooo cute, look like a little starwberry. Small size is fit for 2 year old girl."
5.0,Hâte this cheap hat
5.0,SanYork is a small free trade zone located in the Denver Colorado area they produce a variety of handmade products all of which appear to be good quality. My Chullo which is of pure Alpaca is very warm and light. In contrast to all other wools Alpaca is not scratchy or irritating in the least. All in all it was a very good deal.
5.0,2nd pair I've purchased.... these glasses for so well on your face.

5.0,"Love this PJs perfect, fits exactly as expected, great product, good material excellent value."
5.0,"This key chain works perfectly for me.  I don’t carry my purse to work so I needed something to hook my car keys to the belt loop on my pants, and this was the solution for me!  I don’t have to worry about my keys becoming detached and lost."
5.0,"I was surprised I was a small, but I followed the measurements on the description and it fit perfectly. I loved the fabric too, I wanted these to pair with a silk shirt. I was worried the fabric would be more of a mat/cotton material, but it was a silky shiny spandex that worked perfect for my outfit. They looked and fit great"
5.0,Super cute I love these! I want a second pair for my daughter.
5.0,"Socks work and feel great.  A little too high so have to fold over at the top, but other then that seem fine."
5.0,"I got over 36 likes on my facebook photo, my friends love this shirt! Everyone wants to buy it! :)"
5.0,This was purchased as a gift and it is perfect! My son listens to music on his phone all the time and it has a great battery life. I really like that it only allows a certain volume so it doesn't blow your ear drums.
5.0,Loved this for summer the top will look cute in the fall with leggings and a sweater!
5.0,My son loves his slippers.. they are warm comfortable.
5.0,"Love the deep teal green color and all the zippers. It's a smaller sized bag but holds everything I need, and it's nicely made. I bought it to match a pair of shoes and it worked!"
5.0,Looks like picture as described
5.0,Bought for my son for school. Works great and he loves it.
5.0,I have 5 stars for service. Dress arrived as expected. But it was way too small. I ordered it 3 sized bigger than I wear too.

5.0,Seemed a little short but width was good. Very cute. Good quality. Haven’t washed them yet though.
5.0,"Love the style, fabric, and weight! Beautiful for every occasion!"
5.0,"Hey, I’m relatively new to the tactical shooting community and I picked this rig up to test it out. Do you need something rugged, versatile, great quality and affordable? This is almost that. Almost.<br />The build quality is descent, won’t break too fast but you will hit snags right away. I’m terms of ruggedness and it’s ability to hold a lot of weight? Meh, again it does it well enough. As long as you don’t overdo it with Velcro everywhere you will have a good rig that’s simple and slick. You actually can wear this under a jacket and have it be pretty inconspicuous. Overall, good bang for your buck but if you pay about $30 extra you can get something much better"
5.0,"Absolutely love these, super comfortable and perfect for gym or normal wear; AND THEY’RE SQUAT PROOF!"
5.0,"Surprised they were not tie shoes. OMG!  They stretch, easy to put on and the fit is snug enough for playing Pickleball!"

5.0,"So beautiful Bodycon dress. fits perfect to me! I ordered small in my 32B, 25waistline and 5'1height and it is perfect to me. The material is very light, stretchy but very good quality, the material is not cheap.. I like it so much.. It hugs my body so well and I can wear it in some occasions.<br />I received this product in discounted price in exchange of my honest opinion."
5.0,Love them!! Great fit for anyone who likes big sunglasses. Got them at a great price too
5.0,I completely love the coat!  A little tight in the arms.  But absolutelylobe it
5.0,Great masks for comfort and breathability.  Perfect to wear here in Northern Lower Michigan!
5.0,"Fits perfectly. Only worn for 5 days, we’ll see if it lasts."
5.0,Im 5'5 and i weigh 165 and the dress fit great. The only issue i had was the neck area because i have a lot of hair in my head and it took a minute to get it over my head lol.
5.0,The pants fit perfectly and kept me both dry and warm. I used them back to back days in Colorado. Would highly recommend this purchase.
5.0,This necklace is really nice. I am very happy with it. I was going to give to a friend for her birthday. Haha decided to keep for mine. It hangs beautifully. Would not hesitate in buying another one.

5.0,"Quality is great, cannot tell it’s fake unless some hater is examining it closely. Gucci doesn’t actually make an Apple Watch band. It’ll obviously rub off at some point but for the price just buy another one. This band is perfect!"
5.0,"Light, compact and strong grip. Makes it real had to lose the keys once it’s attached to tour bag or pants"
5.0,"I bought these because I like to avoid the &#34;booty-jiggle&#34; in some of the skirts I wear.  I'm not necessarily trying to control my fat, but the jiggle of my fat, if that makes sense.  This is the perfect amount of control.  Incredibly breathable (I live in Phoenix - so that's important in the summer months here), so much so that I now wear them with skirts to help keep my inner thighs from chaffing (replaced the powder, which was my go to method to reduce chaffing).  I got a large; I'm 5'4, curvy shape, wear a 10 or 12 in pants, weigh 160-160 lbs."
5.0,Coat is beautiful! Fits great! I love it!
5.0,This stone has a darker vein running through which give it a more casual look.  I love them.

5.0,"What I liked the most about these socks is comfort! The socks hold the feet very well and have got the right amount of cushion for a long run or an intense session in the gym. The material used is of good quality and is quite flexible. I am positive that it will last long. It did not slip a bit while running with my regular running shoes. The socks cover the ankle part completely and appropriately to avoid bruising of any kind! I ran around 5 miles in more than an 80-degree temperature but socks did not allow sweat to trouble me either during or after the run. Altogether, it seems to be a very promising product in this price range! I recomend this to all"
5.0,Color is beautiful and washed up nice!
5.0,They are beautiful.  A little smaller than I expected.
5.0,Great quality and color. Really soft
5.0,"I sleep a bit hot but do tend to get a bit chilly at times in winter.  These are soft and warm (without being too warm at least for me), just so nice to sleep in.  Definitely recommend!"

5.0,Gorgeous and high quality
5.0,glasses are awesome!!
5.0,"Beautiful, nice shine to the stones, substantial, slight bit heavier but not so much as to keep from wearing it."
5.0,"Product definitely fits as the chart shows. I like that it looks like a little retro dress. It is definitely red, sometimes when you order something red it comes a bit more on the pink side and this was true to its color. The only negative thing about it was that there was a bit of the white inside of the swim suit that did show a bit, but I'm sure if I took more time to adjust it properly it would probably hide just fine. I like that it's open backed because I like to show off my tattoos on my back and I like that the skirt part hides my thick thighs. I am very self conscious of how I look in a swim suit sonwas looking for something that would hide the worst of it and also be mommy appropriate. The material isof high quality also.<br />I did receive this product at a discounted price for my honest review"
5.0,What can I say other then they work as intended “ would likely buyback then again which I might before the cold weather
5.0,Very soft and warm. Fits perfect on my petite hands and I’m a size small.

5.0,"Smaller than I expected, but still great quality and worked great for the costume we used it for! :)"

5.0,This is a very pretty Charm and the details are well done. Just remember the Charm Beads are small so details do not stand out like other large items. Even after stating this I believe you will not be disappointed if you buy this bead.
5.0,This us exactly as listed. Great substitute for a big purse!
5.0,"Got this watch for Christmas for my boyfriend who is very outdoorsy and works building bridges. It’s a perfect everyday watch. Christmas Eve night he opened it and then nerded out on me and read the entire manual while tinkering with the watch. He loves all the settings, the auto light up when you check the time, the alarms, the barometric pressure, sunrise, compass etc. Looks very nice with everyday attire."
5.0,I love these jeans so much! They look great and feel great. Next time I buy a pair though I will go down a size. I am usually a &#34;tight&#34; size 14 in pants so I went with the 16/18. They fit great at first but stretch out a bit.
5.0,Love the color love the wearvery comfortable

5.0,"USE SIZE CHART. I bought a Large, fit nicely, not skin tight. (5'6"" 120lbs, usually wear small or xs in clothing) Exactly as pictured, thin breathable material. Nice fall colors!"
5.0,Who would have thought that these little things would be so helpful. The material is fairly soft and can stretch to accommodate different arm sizes. I have them for my daily glasses and sunglasses. Quite pleased
5.0,"These are by far one of the best workout leggings I have had in a while. I am 5’1” and about 145lbs. I got a size large due to the sizing chart, buuuutt I just bought another pair in a Medium. The leggings do fit very well and keep everything in place while I am working out. The waist band is just a little above where I would like it to be due to my height. So comfy and so cute"

5.0,Very good product and business firm.

5.0,"So lovely. Love the fact that you can wear it with a variety of skirts underneath. Also like the multiple lengths and layers, and the corset structure is very appealing. Darkly elegant."
5.0,"By far the most comfortable boots I have. Tonos of compliments on unusual styling.  Can't say for sure they are leather but sure looks like pebbled leather../..the smell, however, seems to give it away.  No matter:  You've fooled 90% of us.  There are brands that do similar rose styling on shoes for way, way more.  We shoe addicts LOVE Amazon!"
5.0,The detail is amazing
5.0,very nice will wear often
5.0,"Am on my third one, love these so much. Comfy, material soft but not hot, well made and the back detail is nice."

5.0,Thus is my second bag with my first one being purchased 6 years ago in black. I live to travel and the safety features give me the comfort in knowing my wallet and belongings are safe!
5.0,"I couldn't figure out why my dress felt so tight until I remembered that I was shoved into this shapewear like a sausage into casing.  This did exactly what it's designed to do!  The hole for using the restroom is REALLY large, I threw on underwear on top because my bum was falling out and making for a very interesting line...."
5.0,"Very nice find, comfortable, durable, and affordable. Thanks Freehawk"
5.0,"Beautiful necklace...looks great on the neck line. it's a little long, so I made adjustments."
5.0,I love the way these headbands fit. I wear them every day whether I'm exercising or not. They are so pretty and the fabric is so soft. I cant wait to order more from maven thread. I found some workout clothes I'll be trying next.
5.0,"Purchased these patriotic sandals for my husband. He is usually a 10.5 and I ordered him an 11 and they fit him perfect. He says they are really comfortable and based on how much he wears them, I believe him. If your usually in a half size I would definitely size up instead of down!"
5.0,VERY AFFORDABLE
5.0,Fabric is soft and lovely. Got to use for breastfeeding and it will work perfectly.
5.0,It's as comfortable as a mask can be. Easier to pull on your face than the masks that go around your ears. And very pretty.
5.0,Its very cute! I got many compliments. I wishe they would make more prints!
5.0,The inside is super soft and warm.  Our little dude love it.
5.0,❤❤❤❤❤❤ love ❤❤💞❤❤❤

5.0,It was for my granddaugther are it fit nice
5.0,I got this to replace my original strap and it is far superior!  The class are much easier to Clío on and off than my old one  The stitching is perfect.  Exceeded my expectations!

5.0,Was really worried that they wouldn’t fit not being able to try them on before I purchased them. Was so happy that they fit perfect. Also very reasonably priced.  Will be ordering again!!!
5.0,"Awesome. Thin, so bend easily, which is not surprising for the price, but I feel beautiful in them and they are so comfortable that I never take them off."
5.0,The watch itself is beautiful. Boyfriend wears it all the time. The packaging was just as gorgeous.  I love this!

5.0,Bought these for years. Great quality glad I can buy replacement pairs easily
5.0,I ordered these as a gift for someone and she says that she likes them. They seem like they are a good knit and will hold up well.
5.0,"I love the size of this bag. It has compartments for various things: hand cleaner, gloves, tools, and electronics.<br />The perfect size for me (I'm a hospice admissions nurse)."
5.0,"I own some lovely cotton jersey PJs that feel like rubber the minute the weather gets a little warm and humid. Not these.<br /><br />The fabric is light-weight, non-stretchy, non see-through comfort. And I did not find them over large at all, but I can't sleep in anything tight and form-fitting. The top and bottom are even the same size! With too many PJ sets the size L comes with the top an XXL and the bottom barely an M. Not these. And the top and bottom are both long enough. Not those pants that stop three inches above your foot, or the top that stops an inch below your waist. The top is long enough that I could even slip off the pants and wear it alone if I wanted to. The short sleeves are a nice length too. And the breast pocket is not so tiny you can't even stash a tissue in it.<br /><br />The one flaw is the drawstring. It's a flat piece of cotton like a shoelace. At the first wash it crumples so badly it twists itself all the way around the inside of the pants. I had to pull it out and replace it. Otherwise, these are the most comfortable PJs for warm weather I've ever owned."
5.0,"Love love love it! Great material, soft and fits well. I plan to order a few other colors!"
5.0,"I was wanting a new dress for work and this one is perfect.  It's comfortable,  soft, and best of all - it has pockets!  The pockets are reasonable size and you can comfortably and securely hold items (my chapstick, my phone).<br />For sizing reference, I'm 5'11, 150 lbs"
5.0,"I purchase it as a gift for my friends, he really like it ,he thought I spent over 100 bucks on it ,but the answer is not! The belt with high quality but less money !"
5.0,Cleats look great. My son likes them because he doesn’t feel like they are going to fall off. Plus it helps keep his laces tied.
5.0,"LOVE it! Beautiful colors, enough pockets and holds more than I need to carry."
5.0,"I have big hips and usually have to order a Large or XL in yoga type pants, I bought a Large, these I could have gotten a Medium. They become looser also as you wear them. I fold down the waist band which is nice and comfy. They are super lightweight silky smooth pj pants with pockets. They get too loose to wear in public, unless maybe I got the smaller size."
5.0,I LOVE this shirt and so does everyone else.
5.0,Perfect size to cover my entire head.
5.0,The lighthouse key chains were very nicely designed. I brought them for gifts to women of my church. I was very pleased with the order.<br />The women liked them a lot.<br />The key chains is a ministry for God.
5.0,I get so many compliments on this skirt. I wear it high waisted. It's absolutely adorable. I ordered an xl.<br />I'm 5'6 about 150 lbs.
5.0,"My daughter loves this hat, it works great and she especially likes that it has an extra added cloth crown on top. Apparently there is a version of this hat without a crown too that she has seen."
5.0,My son loved this as a gift wears it all the time easy to wash good material comfy and nuetral colors .
5.0,"These boots came in a blue shoe bag that can be used to store shoes. I ordered size 5.5 and the fitting was accurate.  I liked the heels on these boots. It is very comfortable to walk on these heels. Also, they keep your feet warm. I have not tried it on a snowy weather yet, but will once it snows. So far, it’s good."
5.0,Bigger then I thought but its perfect much nicer in person an it came earlier then they said it would
5.0,"My son loves these slippers!<br />Okay, he has flat feet (on the really bad side of flat feet), with overpronation. Size 14. He must have quality shoes and slippers, to not aggravate his feet. These are by far the best he has EVER worn/owned.<br />They are made extremely well. I will update this if we encounter any changes, but I believe at this time, this was a great buy. I would recommend these slippers."
5.0,My mother in-law  love this dress
5.0,I enjoy this watch.
5.0,It's a bit short for size but very cute top.
5.0,I luv this material and it fits nicely.
5.0,My niece wore for our family wedding. Looked amazing on her. She loved the set
5.0,"Finally, a key ring that doesn't require a ""tool"" to open. Quick to open, slide on and slide off. It is secure once on the key, also. Very light weight, too. I guess I was surprised by that. I'm looking forward to using them for many years to come."
5.0,I can see my iPhone with this  pair of sunglasses  the dark pair I cannot see at all
5.0,I did the double band with my halo engagement ring and it's like they were custom made just for my ring. I've had my bands for 2 years now and haven't had any loose prongs or missing diamonds. They are the same quality as any band sold at major jewelry stores but at 1/3 of the price
5.0,"I’m obsessed. They are such nice quality. Soft, warm and adorable!"
5.0,"Perfect<br /><br />Update: This jacket was the best investment I did for my Iceland trip.  I bought it L, but I’m usually a M, and it was the best decision. Due to the fact that you need to wear your clothing by layers, this was perfect because I was able to wear a warmer, a wool shirt and a zipper jacket under this system. The warmth that expels is excellent, and we experienced temperatures as low as 7 degrees F. Great waterproof technology, of the 8 days we spend in Iceland, 7 rained, and I’m really pleased with the results. Bottom line: this is the jacket you need! Don’t think that much!"
5.0,I love this hat. Very well made and will keep you nice and warm. The stitching is done well and the snap on mask is an added bonus for you ninjas out there. My head is on the bigger side at 7 5/8 so it is snug but feel that it is stretching out a bit and over time will fit perfect. No cons to speak of and I purchased at a great price. Can't go wrong with this seller. Cheers!
5.0,"I like the women’s summer strapless floral dress due to the tiered ruffles.  It looks nice and elegant with a classy look.  I’m 5’1, 110lbs, and ordered a small in Yellow.  I was a little worried it will be too long since I’m short and petite.<br /><br />The dress fits well.  The length was not an issue.  It hits right at my ankle and with heels, it will be perfect.  The dress fits well but I prefer it a bit tighter.  I wish it came in an XS.<br /><br />Overall, I’m happy with this dress.  I like long dresses but because I’m short, it is hard to find long dresses that look good on me.  The dress is lightweight, soft, and comfortable.  It is not see-through.  Great summer dress!  I washed it before wearing and it washes well and didn’t wrinkle."
5.0,"The cape was a little short I length but not a huge deal. The dress was amazing and worked well for my Halloween outfit, then some. It’s super comfortable and I’ll keep using it."
5.0,Order size up.
5.0,Great Fit and Fast Shipping
5.0,love this blouse.  very comfortable.  fits nice
5.0,"These are just what I’ve been looking for, good fitting cropped wide legged jeans.  They fit good on the hips & butt and are very flattering.  I love then with a T-shirt and cute heels."
5.0,"Got them as a gift to a former friend of mine, she loved them, very cute"
5.0,Just what my mom needed. Wore this under a white dress. Perfect! Couldn't see anything. Great length below the knee.
5.0,Great material. Nice and comfy for the kiddo. He likes them alot that what counts
5.0,"Definitely bigger than expected but holds a lot. I have a half pack of pampers pure wipes, three size five diapers, rash cream, bags for dirty diapers, one puppy pad (in case we are in a changing room) and an outfit with plenty of room. I like having this for quick grab while I'm out with the little one."
5.0,Good fit for son with beard-xl<br />He ordered a second time.
5.0,Fits like a dream!
5.0,"We loved this because while it was super cute, it was still easy to do diaper changes since it is a one piece with buttons on the longs and crotch."
5.0,"This is a cute set, my daughter loves it. It's warm and well made."
5.0,great fit and like the colors
5.0,"This top is very light-weight and comfortable for summer, and the fit is flattering."
5.0,"This necklace is stunning!  It has some weight to it, but a necklace of this size it's understandable.  It's exactly as pictures.  I am truly happy with this purchase."
5.0,"Fits a little small, I had to go up a size."
5.0,Good price for a kids hat. Is a bit large for my 2 year olds head but it adjusts enough. Fits my teen daughter nicely.
5.0,Great for the price. My children love them.
5.0,Was a gift for my daughter she loves it!
5.0,Get compliments everytime I wear this top!
5.0,"Fit my wider shoulders and chest, had to tuck my spanx shorts up just a little with the leg split. Got great compliments!"
5.0,"This is exactly what I expected. On the flimsy side, of course. Fits my adult head."
5.0,Love them and so have my cat living friends.
5.0,"I wish they were cheaper. Used them while traveling, working on a blog that will endorse these!! Would love to grab another soon."
5.0,just what I needed to carry medical insurance cards and credit cards.
5.0,I love this purse and wallet. I get so many wonderful comments! I plan on buying a black one for my winter purse.
5.0,"I bought this to play a brass instrument at an outdoor wedding that really should have been indoors, as it was the end of  October in Pennsylvania.  They kept my hands warm enough to play, and the grip on the horn was secure. They limited the finger dexterity just a bit, but it didn't matter for this gig."
5.0,"Fun colour, great to perk up olive green or grey dresses. The shoes are comfortable and although fabric have the look of suede. Adore the block heel too, it's the perfect in-between height."
5.0,Fits true to size also is shiny & clean. I purchased these one and a plain band from the same company and they both look great.
5.0,"I have always loved long necklaces, and this chain is longer on me than I expected, and I LOVE it!. I have always had a fascination with hourglasses, and I was happy to find a long chained necklace with an hourglass. I am taken with the fact that it actually have granules of sand that will actually sift through the hourglass. I find that I turn it and let it end if nervous. I love to pair this hourglass necklace with my [[ASIN:B00SH2ZFBM HUAN XUN Vintage Owl Steampunk Necklace Owl Pendant Necklace Silver]], that I am also in love with. I have received a multitude of compliments for both necklaces, and one even asked if I was intending to give a nod to Harry Potter (hourglass to give homage to the time turner, and the owl for obvious reasons). Not intentional, but fun none-the-less. I also love to pair it with these bracelets [[ASIN:B017U3V648 Black Silver Brown Alloy Genuine Leather Bracelet Bangle Rope Tribal]], [[ASIN:B010HE5V6Q Brown Gold Alloy Genuine Leather Bracelet Bangle Rope Braided Tribal]], and [[ASIN:B015NUY7BY Brown Alloy Genuine Leather Bracelet Bangle Band Wrap Wrist Cuff Rope Braided]].<br />Overall, I would highly recommend this necklace to anyone who is looking for a fashionable accessory.<br />I was fortunate enough to receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for a completely honest review."
5.0,Great everything arrived in perfect condition ring isn’t adjustable by the way but overall amazing just runs small
5.0,Great ítem!!!
5.0,Great quality. Easy iron on.
5.0,Perfect size<br />I love it
5.0,"The stones are delicate set in the silver making this a perfect gift for any little girl. It would look perfect on a smaller wrist than my 7"" wrist."
5.0,If I can I will give this ten stores then 5 stars this hat is awesome the sound quality is good the battery life last long
5.0,"I have more credit cards than slots for credit cards but, I just use other compartments to put them in. It still holds all my cash, change, comb, toothpick and my phone just comfortably. Love it."
5.0,This bag is so adorable and roomy. Material is high quality and made well. Fits a lot of items and an extra outfit and pair of shoes. I bought it as a carryall for work but I think I'll use it for every day. Looks classy and cute
5.0,This money clip credit card holder is very nice.this is good for travelling.this is nit bulky in the pocket not like the regular wallet.the quality of materials they used is heavy duty.it hold the card tightly..edges are smooth and the carbon fiber is nice.it came with 3 strap..
5.0,Can hold everything I need!!  And nothing fall's out great wallet and not that expensive but look's it!!
5.0,The pendant looks great.
5.0,"My son loved it, it came with an additional necklace that was a surprise and he liked that even better and wears it all the time.  Well made and a great deal!!!!"
5.0,"These are Beautiful. I got matching ones for my girls. They wash well, are soft and comfy and they are super cute."
5.0,What fit ( =
5.0,So Amazon doesn't seem to have the sizing chart that I found when buying on a different outdoor recreational chart so I'll start with that:<br />S/M  |  L/XL<br />Arm Length<br />15 - 18 | 18 - 20<br />Bicep Circumference<br />10.75 - 12 |  12.5 - 15.5<br />Wrist Circumference<br />6 - 7 |  7 - 8<br /><br />That said I see people with questions on sizing.  I'm 5'10 ~ 175lbs and don't have huge biceps but not small either.  The S/M fit great for me once I saw the sizing chart and measured my bicep circumference and length.  I was just nearing the tail end of the S/M sizing chart.  I've had these on a few bike rides as well as some outdoor work in the sun for a few hours.  I didn't have any noticeable redness or burns in the northern Ohio hot summer days and they provide a bit of a cooling sensation.<br /><br />I picked up a pair of the Alloy color and will have to see how they look long term with use but I have other gear by OR and know them to be pretty good quality.  They are better tapered to be larger in the bicep than other cheaper sleeves I have tried and I like the optional thumb holes and slight grip ring placed on the inside of the bicep cuff to prevent the sleeve from slipping down.  I'm very happy with this purchase compared to others.<br /><br />At the time of this review these  were priced at $35.95 here on Amazon and at the place I bought them they go for $29.00 and I happened to pick them up on sale for $20.99 a few weeks back so perhaps I'm more easy going given how much I may have saved over other reviewers here.<br /><br />I'm bound to leave these in my bike panniers since they weigh nothing and I'd hate to be on a ride and forget to grab them if it's starts out cloudy or overcast and the sun comes blasting out soon after.
5.0,What can I say? It's funny. It's fairly large and well made. I use it for my portable phone charger. It looks like my cat.
5.0,Tight but awesome
5.0,Love so much!
5.0,Ver Ver pretty
5.0,"These goggles are absolutely fantastic!!! They do not leak. They fit to your face with a suction but not uncomfortably. The fit is perfect. They also do great in the sun and take the glare off the water. I would wear them for sunglasses.  That's how good they are! The nose piece fits well. And, the ear plugs fit well and do not hurt. My 15 year old grandson LOVES them!  would definitely recommend these goggles to everyone!!!"
5.0,Order arrived very quickly. Love them all my fav the blank with the love birds...will buy again excellent. product.
5.0,Nice looking tie! I guess we didn’t read the description well enough because we weren’t expecting cuff links. So that’s a bonus!
5.0,very comfortable and hard sole is great for running outside for a minute
5.0,Absolutely perfect!  *high five*
5.0,I love this suit. Camouflaged all my little places while just looking cute.
5.0,Colorful kid glasses with case and cleaning cloth.  Nice quality.
5.0,"Super cute, not small at all; perfect fit"
5.0,"Saw these after I had been shopping for a snowsuit for my grandson.  While the weather has not been cold enough yet to use them, they are colorful and cute and with the fleece lining inside should keep his little hands warm."
5.0,As long as you have the RED find button on the garage boor opener this remote should work fine
5.0,It is a great design. I really like the ease of closing and opening and always the exact tightness. I hope it holds up well.
5.0,This was a GREAT IDEA it resolves the issue of having to purchase sunglasses with any kind of eye prescription. You just buy regular sunglasses (most of which DONT come with any prescription) any style which is great! You just stick on to any glasses and you can move them back and fourth of just buy 2 sets and your done! Excelent purchase highly recommend!
5.0,Was absoletly beautiful. my girl loves it.
5.0,Love these robes. My nieces and nephews don't use anything else. They're absorbent and comfy. I got them a little bigger so they can grow into them. I will keep purchasing as the grow. =}
5.0,"I bought this scrub cap after purchasing a different cap on Amazon that didn’t work out. This cap is flattering and is easy to adjust. The bouffant style is by far the best option in scrub caps, the other style available is very unflattering. The print is very cute!"
5.0,Cute as can be. Great quality for a young child.
5.0,This Visor is Wonderful. The Price and the Quality are Great. This Visor is Well Made. I Really Appreciate that it is Suitable for Hello Kitty Fans From 2 to 82. I Wished it Came in Additional Colors and I Will Recommend this Visor for All Hello Kitty Fans Big and Small.

5.0,"Awesome material, and it was a hit!"
5.0,"This dangle heart looks great on! It is well made, and is good quality for the price. I highly recommend."
5.0,"They are adorable but should be called vintage styled.  I am also confused about the little blue guy, what is he ?  He isn't holiday anything."
5.0,I just received it in the mail today and it’s sooo festive. Just like picture. Cannot wait to use it during my house Christmas party
5.0,"Once set up, this watch works superbly. Resets each night at approximately 12:04."
5.0,This hoodie was perfect and warm.  Recommend this hoodie if you are cold natured
5.0,"These boots are extra cute and fit great.  Cowboy boots in general are hard to get used to walking in.  These are very comfortable, and don't slip like other boots I've tried.  I like them, and I was able to purchase them fairly inexpensively with the Amazon discount."
5.0,Perfect fit and works great
5.0,"Its not loose fitting, really frames my face well. I get a lot of compliments."
5.0,"This bracelet is stunning!  I chose this one because of the larger diamond presence on the heart, and large ring.  Rich buttery real yellow gold frosted with dazzling white real diamonds.  Spring ring clasp plus extender.  Great for casual to fancy wear.  Gorgeous cello wrapped black box with owner's guide and I especially love the certificate of authenticity.  Super giftable.  I am a fine jewelry collector and this gets my highest rating.  Diamonds in gold, baby!"
5.0,A very lovely brooch which arrived with quick shipping.
5.0,"After searching for over a year, both in stores and on the Internet, for a navy blue purse, I found this one.  It exceeded my expectations as it holds everything I normally carry, is very lightweight, well-made, and a reasonable price.  I'm now using it everyday and don't have to bother with changing purses all of the time."
5.0,Love the brand and they fit well and comfortable
5.0,My feet feel better wearing these socks!

5.0,These gloves seem to be of the same quality as my famous bicycle gloves. Timely delivery. Easy on and off. So far very satisfied. I will recommend it to my friends.
5.0,I purchased this hat because I’ve loved every product I’ve tried from scent assassin and I liked the look of it. When I ordered it it came way sooner than expected and when I opened it up and put it on I immediately fell in love with it. It's one of the most comfortable hats I’ve ever owned. Thank You scent assassin for another great product.
5.0,It is exactly as ordered
5.0,This is the best stuff I have found with helping keep acne off my shoulders!
5.0,"The black scarf is absolutely beautiful! It feels very soft and so smooth. I really like that it has a slight sheen but it's not shiny or shimmery at all. I used it as a long scarf with a fancy dress and oh-la-la, so nice! I got a lot of compliments on this scarf. The edges are completely finished on all 4 sides. It hangs very well and evenly with no sagging. It could easily be folded it in half like a shawl and would look very pretty like that. It's also large enough (78 x 52) to wear as a sarong or a cover up but much too sheer to wear as a dress alone. I am pleased that this scarf came with the tag hanging on a string from the discreet label and not the scarf itself. No chance of snags or holes which has been a real problem for me with scarves from other online sources. It came with a reusable carry bag. I did not pay full price for this item. I take my reviews seriously and hope you find this one helpful."
5.0,"Super Soft,Love the Purple color I got! Well worth the Price."

5.0,"I had already bought a pair of these for myself a year ago and have loved them ever since then my daughter tried mine on and said ""oh Mom if I had these I'd never take them off they feel so good"". Not only are they the most comfortable pair of flip flops I've ever owned they are so well made and are holding up to constant wear. So I got her this pair and another in a different color. They have the most amazing arch support you rarely find in flip flops. They don't hurt between my toes either or the tops of my feet."
5.0,Love them came sooner then expected
5.0,This dress was gorgeous.  I purchased it last minute for a wedding.  It was super comfy.  I'm petite so I did have to hem it a bit but I was amazed by it that I purchased another one.  I really loved the pockets

5.0,Great for earrings and necklaces
5.0,"I loved this dress. The length is perfect for me, I love the loose sleeves, the slight ruffled hem, and the option of wrapping it around to fit your waistline perfect. The only issue I had was the V cut, if I wore a bra it was visible. I choose not to wear a bra and  adjusted it with a safety pin. I purchased a Medium, I’m 5’5 138 lbs and 36B cup."
5.0,Went 1 size up (6-8). Perfect fit.
5.0,Exactly as described - Exactly what I wanted!
5.0,"soft, comfy and looks great on my hubby. very happy with this purchase"
5.0,My husband loved it!<br />The t-shirt is a perfect fit and good quality.
5.0,"This is the perfect relaxed, yet cute dress. I usually wear an XS top and pant size 2/4 at Express. The small in this dress was perfect. The waist hits at a perfect spot, and I didn’t have to adjust myself at all while wearing it. The material is heavy/thick enough to not be see through, but not so heavy that it’s hot. It has some nice give and covers me well enough to stay modest while chasing kids. I love it!"
5.0,"Awesome boot, fits great!"
5.0,Just wished the print was not incorporated with the folds so you could read the message easier.

5.0,I was in need of a good pair of driving glasses and I wanted them to look good as well and I have to say worth every dollar I paid. I love the  macho man Randy Savage look that I get when I have them on I will be picking up a few more.
5.0,Love how well they fit
5.0,"This top is exactly as pictured. It is well made, good quality, fits true to size, and SO cute! It's a unique design; it looks like a formal button down shirt but is also flowy and cropped. It is light and perfect for summer. The colors and design are vivid and bright. I received many compliments on this top. It can be paired with shorts or jeans. I bought a size small, and I'm 5'3, 115#, 34B and 25 inch waist.  Love this, highly recommend!"
5.0,My son loved it! I ordered a medium thinking that if this comes from international places a small might be too small. But I think it would have fit him even better. But at least he can now wear it a couple of years!<br />The quality was excellent. And shipping was way faster than I expected! The jacket was exactly like the picture! I would not hesitate to buy again!

5.0,"I pretty much live in v neck tee shirts. I love the way that they look on me and tha oaricular shirt is no exact in. It fits great, the neckline is just right, not too low but not too high either. It fits well throughout he rest of my body, it's form fitting but not overly tight. The material tha it is made out of is very soft and comfy and a great thickness, it's thin enough that it isn't hot to wear but not so thin that it is see through o will easily get holes in it. I have washed this shirt a few times as it has become my new favorite and I wear it often and it shows no sign of wear. I don't dry it since I don't really dry any of my clothes but it has held up in the washing machine perfectly. Overall I'm very pleased with this shirt, it fits great, I like how it looks on me and it is the perfect addition to my summer wardrobe!<br /><br />Full disclosure: I received this shirt at a discount in exchange for my exchange for honest  and unbiased review. However that in no way influenced my opinion or review of it."

5.0,Beautiful Earrings in reasonable price
5.0,Love them smaller then I exspected but. They work
5.0,I purchased these as vase layers for my summer trip to Iceland. They were wonderful and very comfortable. I have a 32H chest and these were not too tight or revealing. Plus having a traditional sleeve was helpful. I followed user recommendations and sized up for a looser fit and they were perfect!
5.0,"Perfect for carrying just a few things and not lugging around a giant wallet.  The chain was a little long, I just cut a few links and it's perfect now"
5.0,The quality is pretty good and the print is as picture

5.0,"I bought this for my husband, who not only loves it but looks good in it!  The fit is perfect."
5.0,My daughter loves these!!!

5.0,My daughter loves them. Says they are super comfortable
5.0,"Got this for my daughter who is 5 foot 8, 150 LBS and 38/32/41. We got a size large.<br /><br />This fits her just right. It comes right to the top of her pants, so she's not showing too much or her stomach, and it is not too tight.<br /><br />it appears to be well made, no loose threads or seams."
5.0,I think it's super pretty just got it today I ordered it on the 9th of Jan and it got here finally today on Jan 20th!!!

5.0,"Came nicely packed, great quality leather and the magnets hold the bills safe. I tend to play with the wallet as I have it in my pocket and I haven’t damaged the rather at all. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality wallet. I’ve had no issues with my phone or cards due to the magnets."
5.0,Easy to put... adorable!!!
5.0,Battery didn't last to long but it came with an extra one
5.0,I love How this fits and there’s pockets!
5.0,Very well made and fit beautifully
5.0,Very nice.  I’ve already worn 3 colors.
5.0,"I bought these earings for my nine year old niece and they were perfect. The heart, a piece sign, and multiple colors all appealed to her. They were the ideal size and were youthful but very pretty as well. They came tightly wrapped in a cute little blue box. They were so cute I plan to buy a pair for my granddaughter as well even though she is well stocked with earing changes!"
5.0,"Fits a little large, but I haven't washed it yet-"
5.0,"easy to read, lightweight, you forget it is on your wrist"
5.0,"There are some complaints about this scarf being too short, but in my opinion, it needs to be.  I bought it for warmth.  It seems to naturally snuggle around my neck without having to be tied and it's just long enough to stay down in my coat without all this excess scarf taking up room in my coat.  I bought two of these because I had found something similar for twice the price and was loving it so I wanted a couple more.  My poms have not fallen off yet and seem secure.  I can't locate any little hole at one end to slip the scarf through, but it doesn't seem to be a necessary feature so it's fine. I consider this little scarf one of my greatest finds.  If you are expecting it to be long or want a long scarf 'look', this one is not for you.  But if you are looking for something to keep your neck warm on those below freezing days, you will thoroughly enjoy owning one of these."
5.0,"Great value for the money, should cost more!"
5.0,Fit as expected because I know to order one size up.  Fits great.
5.0,"Very comfortable, love that I can wash and reuse them. Also love that there's no wire poking out."
5.0,Comfortable and easy to wash and dry
5.0,"WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT<br />FOR 10 BUCKS....<br />IT DOES ITS JOB, IT LOOKS<br />COOL, BUT THAT'S IT, DON'T<br />EXPECT TO LAST A LONG TIME.<br />I BOUGHT THE MATTE BLACK COLOR BECASE IT LOOKS LESS<br />TACKY THAN THE GLOSSY BLACK"
5.0,"Wow, you cannot beat the price! It is such a beautiful piece for such a low price. It really does complete an outfit. My only complaint is it does slip a little, but it is still worth every penny."
5.0,I get many compliments on this scarf each time I wear it. The quality is amazing and the length is long which I love as it’s easy to style in many ways.
5.0,"Comfy, good quality, attractive, terrific value. Still early in season in Chicago. See how they work in polar vortex!"
5.0,"I love, love this dress, I 4 different colors with 2 more on the way! SO comfortable; can be dressed up with heals for church or dressed down with sandals."
5.0,"The skies are thick rubber, the tops are super soft.<br />Best pair of slippers I’ve bought. Bought 4 more pair."
5.0,"Good quality slipper. Runs true to size & the best part, they are machine washable."
5.0,"Lightweight, thin, well built."
5.0,Love the jacket! Can wait to wear it to work when the weather gets cooler. Love the cream color- goes with everything!! And very well made.
5.0,I like the Nintendo series it was a cool era
5.0,"Woah! I wasn't expecting that! I am so very happy with my purchase. I thought it is a small tote handbag but the size is just so perfect, spacious inside. It is the base that measures 10&#34; x 4&#34;. It is nicely packed, comes with a white protective pouch, and all the signs of it being authentic is present. I love it!"
5.0,"As the title says... it is indeed small, but once you tuck it all in it does the job and is comfortable."
5.0,Love these socks! Just the right coverage and the colors are great!  Feels like I'm not wearing anything!
5.0,I bought it for my son
5.0,"I haven’t tried it on yet but the stretch is there, incase you think you need to go bigger DONT  the product looks as pictured  and it’s made of a very stretchy heavy fabric … it does look extremely short so be prepared to wear something under it that’s not going to show bloomers or straight down Azz…."
5.0,"Very nice top. Lightweight, exactly as described, will be getting in other colors."
5.0,I really like how it fits and plan on ordering more colors if available!
5.0,Love these omg I have never seen earrings like this and they are amazing quality. I did paint the top of them with clear fingernail polish because there were starting to turn but other than that I love them!
5.0,"I have worn this same watch for 20 or 30 years.  They keep great time, are water proof to a point, and last for a few years.  The band usually breaks before anything else.  I notice that now the battery is not replaceable (at least not as easily as before) but for less than $10 delivered they can't be beat."
5.0,"Getting compliments....,"
5.0,"Nice fit and easy to put on. Like the color and coverage it provides. Althought it is label as a men's phone case, it's perfect colors for a female as well."
5.0,Amazed at how cute these are. Highly recommended.
5.0,Received product intact and as shown. Fast delivery.  My girlfriend loves it.
5.0,"Nice lightweight comfortable pants. I got a large, but with my thicker hips, an extra large would’ve worked better. The large fits fine was a little snug around the hips, but loosened up as the day went on. I like the style and print of these pants, great for lounging or wearing for a nice relaxing day out."
5.0,"LOVE this swimsuit! It's very comfortable, but still form fitting, and of high quality materials. The cups are definitely for larger sizes, and probably would not fit cup sizes below C without some gap. I also don't know if I'd call it a &#34;push up&#34; top, but it is lined,  and with an underwrite. It also comes with a nice little beach bag. Very satisfied with this purchase!"
5.0,"Awesome glasses , very cute , a little tight on , but nothing bad. Nice shade and helps keep the sun out of my eyes, along with being stylish!"
5.0,Great belt the only thing simi negative is the release lever is on the bottom and sometimes hard to do but it does grow on you. Love the belt! And use it all the time and plan on getting more of it ever goes bad
5.0,"This replacement band for my Suunto is perfect and I like that it's a little less long than OEM. Color is very nice, too. Thank you!"
5.0,"After seeing this dress all over Pinterest and Facebook, I was so excited to see it available on Amazon. I've never had much luck ordering anything I've found on Pinterest :/. The dress arrived on time and is BEAUTIFUL.  The colors are amazing and the quality is on point. I'd defiantly order another dress through Amazon from them."
5.0,Beautiful dress. Soft material. Great quality! I am usually a medium and purchased a small based on other reviews. Very comfortable to move around in and dance for special events.
5.0,These are so comfortable on my 7m old. They fit him perfectly and we're perfect for my daughter's superhero themed birthday party!
5.0,"My new favorite dress. It’s so soft and comfortable. Good quality fabric that isn’t sheer, but still flowy. It’s more beautiful in person and looks like a dress that costs much more than I paid. I ordered the small and it’s a perfect fit. It’s not so baggy that it makes me look frumpy, but just loose enough that I can move around comfortably. I hate wearing heels and with this, I don’t have to. It’s the perfect length for me and I didn’t have to hem it. I ordered the navy in small. I’m 5’3, 110 lbs, 34B bra."
5.0,My son loves his new ring. Great colors and fun!
5.0,Great deal for 6 pairs and a wash bag so I dont lose them after washing! Love it. I will buy from again!
5.0,"I<br />I'm a professional handi-man. I need gloves every day. I've tried them all, and these are the ones I use for every day work. They are soft and comfortable, yet very durable. Quality has been excellent. Use the HEAVY gloves for the really nasty work; use the GENERAL glove for every day."
5.0,TheTieBar is outstanding! Great quality and comfy fit.

5.0,"Soft, lightweight & comfortable! I’m 5’4”, 160 lbs & ordered an xtra large for plenty of room in the midsection. Like the first one I ordered so much, I ordered a 2nd!"
5.0,My daughter got a Hedgehog for Christmas so she was so excited to ge these. Well made Very cute!
5.0,"I ordered this to attach to the box I chose for my late husband's urn.<br /><br />It's metal, very solid and BEAUTIFUL! The USAF logo is detailed. The colors are bright and clear. Nice details!<br /><br />There is no adhesive provided (not a problem) so I used the Command Adhesive Strips to attach the medallion to the top of the urn. So far, no issues with it staying put. I'll probably opt for a more permanent adhesive later. I wanted to be sure I was happy with the placement.<br /><br />I'm very happy with the size. The quality of the medallion is great! I believe this company also does challenge coins. I would definitely go to them again and recommend them to anyone looking for military medallions for any use."
5.0,"I don't know why some folks aren't happy with this product.  It was like magic instantly removing the tarnish from my silver bracelets, earrings and necklaces."
5.0,Looks much more expensive than the price tag suggests. Perfect for a holiday party or date night. Definitely recommend!
5.0,I'm very happy I got this. It's just what I wanted and I am enjoying very much. It would make a great gift too!
5.0,A friend contacted me about making her daughter a tooth keepsake box - I was looking for inspiration when I came across this and knew it would be perfect for what she wanted. Needless to say she loved it. It even had a place to save the hair.
5.0,"my mistake, i guessed and didn't measure.  the product is excellent and of high quality.  you can feel the quality when you string them through the eyelets... looking forward to re-ordering the next size up!"
5.0,By far my favorite heels for girls. They’re comfortable and adjustable if too big. They go with pretty much any dress
5.0,"I ordered this purse for my mother in black for Christmas and I was amazed at the quality!  It is so nice and well made and made of real leather!  So, I ordered the burgundy purse for myself after Christmas.  I wasn't going to be disappointed if it really wasn't burgundy based on other peoples comments.  It just came in and it is really a red, not a bright red, just a little on the darker side.  I love the color anyway and will get a lot of use out of it.  The black was out of stock when I ordered the burgundy but it is back in stock and I just ordered it. Great purse especially for the price."
5.0,Sense my granddaughter have to carry more thing. This backpack is awesome. It may only be a few weeks but the way there rough I would be looking but definitely up to the challenge. The inside has sports for everything
5.0,Beautiful!  Gave as a gift and they loved it.
5.0,"I ordered this a size medium, because I saw that it runs small on the size, and it fits me good. I wear a size small/medium shirts, but I also like my shirts a little loose and not tight. But, I am glad I ordered a size up, because this medium fits almost how my small fits me. The material is light and see through an undershirt is most likely needed (at least for me). It was a comfortable fit for the most part, I do think the shelves should have been a couple inches longer, for a better fit. But, I got this shirt mainly for the look of the quarter of the shelve look. Overall, its a cute nice shirt to wear on a small breezy type day."
5.0,Great handkerchiefs.  Good designs and a generous size.
5.0,"Bought it to take on a trip and it was perfect. I was able to fit my ID, credit cards, cash, and phone inside the zipper part. And on the outside pocket a small antibacterial, small lotion, and lip gloss. I love it."
5.0,A gift for a friend who loves math and this was the perfect size for his ties!
5.0,Covers  just right! Picture is so perfect!

5.0,Super cute didn’t sit where I wanted it to so I sent it back
5.0,As described. Great for my fisherman!
5.0,I love this shirt. It stays in place and its comfortable. HOWEVER be warned that it is made of that slick synthetic material that if you're prone to sweating is NOT forgiving.
5.0,"These boots were purchased as a gift. But they were so nice I bought a pair for myself. Good fit, comfortable and will meet our needs during the rainy and snowy days ahead.  Good enough to wear in the house as well as outside for quick trips into town or to the wood pile. No further need to constantly change footwear."
5.0,"Excellent quality and materials, very strong.  Big durable zippers."
5.0,Very nice for my daughter.

5.0,"Love this casual, so comfortable and classy!!!  Soft and not see through!!!  Get this!!!"
5.0,Looks expensive. Really nice bought as a gift for my boyfriend.
5.0,"Adorable! Well made and soft. Fit her perfectly. The nonskid feet are great, but if I had it to do again I probably wouldn’t get this kind. It makes it a little aggravating to get some of her shoes on."
5.0,"I balked at the idea of paying so much for slippers, but cold Russian floors finally sent me over the edge. These slippers are very warm, perhaps too warm. However, they are amazingly comfortable. The foot bed provides fantastic support, making these a treat to slide your feet into after a long day at work. The rubber soles make them sufficient for quick trips outside too. All around a fantastic shoe."
5.0,"Granddaughter loved it, only complaint is that the camera didn’t work very well but for the money it wasn’t bad."
5.0,Super thick and warm socks! They would be great for hiking but also great for cold winter nights at home.

5.0,"Great earrings, really cute and really comfortable."
5.0,They were perfect for graduates to wear in solidarity for a classmate who was not able to walk.
5.0,This is my second pair because I misplaced one. They are amazing and I receive so many compliments on them.
5.0,This is SUPER cute! I recommend.
5.0,Just wish it came with the matching wallet which is proving hard to find.
5.0,"The band is very nice I plan to buy more colors ,my watch is the Gear Fit 2 Pro, it is large i had to remove 5 links could have removed 6 but i don't mind a little lose, the links after a coulpe of try's i got the links out, i bent the little pin but was easy to straighten out,  it could use a safty chain ,over all the band really dresses your watch up."
5.0,My daughter loves these sandals and she even puts them on herself. They are so soft in the inside with a padded sole part. Then the plastic part is also soft. All around great shoe for an independent toddler.
5.0,"They are nice and shiny, i am very allergic so its important to me that the whole earring is plastic, not only the post!"
5.0,It was easy to use the phone keypad to get to apps.
5.0,I’m going to be wearing this all the time it’s so comfy. At first I didn’t know how tf to wrap it. Lol I probably still don’t know how. I just be winging it and it’s a vibe. The only con I have is the instructions because they only have picture and not  many how-to instructions. I think they should give you multiple ways to wear this instead of 2. Smh. But nonetheless this is actually very nice and it keeps you warm slightly. I have no complaints and I think I want more.
5.0,This is my second pair.  Warm.  Love the non skip soles
5.0,I needed some of these to take on my honeymoon and to work out in. Perfect! I wear a size 7 and it was true to size. And I love the stackable options.
5.0,These are good tanks and will buy again

5.0,Comfortable.  The waist band is a little bulky but overall it's a good comfortable fit.
5.0,"The color goes with everything. I have been wearing it for months and is so much more comfortable than the original one. It is easy to put on and off, no buckles!  It is adjustable so you get the comfortable fit you want."
5.0,Husband loves them. They cover his prescription glasses very nicely.
5.0,"My granddaughter loves her new ladybug jacket! I bought size 9-12 mth for a 7mth old. The sleeves are long but she will grow into it & wear it til winter! Cute, fits well & made well!"
5.0,"I wear these quite frequently, I like matching my jewelry to my mood so I really like the variety of this pack.<br />A lot of reviews claim cheap/fake not 316L stainless steel like claimed. This is partly true. Some of these clickers turn Green in the creases and where the clicker bar connects to the designed part. However, I have not had any itching or issues caused by the bar that goes into the piercings, so I do believe that part is made of the 316L stainless steel. I have a terrible sensitivity to fake jewelry and because the fake part isn’t actually touching me I don’t have any issues.<br /><br />Would recommend keeping them away from moisture when not being used and taking them out and cleaning them frequently as to not get a buildup in the bar joint."
5.0,This ring looks just as in the pictures! It was an Easter present for my daughter and she loves it! Very well made.
5.0,Love these belts.
5.0,I love these pjs. Soft comfortable fabric beautiful colors.
5.0,I ordered this in white. The shirt looks great with a pair of shorts over a bathing suit. I wore it to the beach and it really worked out. The shirt moves with the breeze and I could tuck in my arms in the folds of the sleeves out in the sun. I think the shirt was worth the price.
5.0,I get many compliments on my sunglasses.
5.0,"Bought if for my wife and she really enjoys it. It's a think watch but sits very nicely on her wrist. Overall, a great watch for the price."

5.0,"These cropped pants fit true to size. The fabric is soft, the waistband is stretchy but can not be tightened. The leg cuffs are soft and are not tight and do not rub skin. There are two front pockets. 60% cotton, 40% polyester, machine cold wash. Great for everyday wear at home, outside or to school. I like them."
5.0,Love ly

5.0,My friend loved it!!!!
5.0,"Wow! These are a must buy! The fabric is is so buttery. I got a size large and a medium to see what would fit and the medium fits and holds perfectly. The large is a tad bit too big, but I can still wear it! Both lengths seem the same and both hold my tummy in without being too tight!"
5.0,Much better than I expected
5.0,This Koala necklace is quality made and the packaging excellent. The already printed card from a Grandmother to her Granddaughter is very nice! My granddaughter's birthday theme was Koalas therefore this was a perfect present to her from me. Delivery was very fast. Money well spent.
5.0,"Thin, soft material. Super comfortable and cool enough for warm nights. True to size. The material is thin but the pajamas seem well made. Buying more in different colors."
5.0,"Grandsons love these pants because no zippers!  Plus, they think they are cool."

5.0,"This necklace was ordered for my granddaughter in another state. So while I have not personally seen it, I am told it is very nice."
5.0,read headlinr
5.0,It fit perfect. I ordered it for a 16 year old boy
5.0,Updated to 5 stars because seller proactively contacted me and after a couple emails they refunded my purchase.<br />Bands are &#34;ok&#34;. Orange isn't quite orange rather more salmon color and clasp for all bands are a bit loose so there is a risk of losing the Fitbit.  Have to use a wrap around the clasp to prevent that.
5.0,Love this. Looks great with leggings and boots.
5.0,I bought these socks in orange and blue. I wear them when it’s football game day. Chicago Bears!!
5.0,Lovely hat and sunglasses
5.0,I love this replacement strap!!<br />The stiched hearts us raised and very well made
5.0,Bigger than what I expected but still as pictured it looks so cute on my car keys
5.0,The jacket is what I expected it to be cute light weight just what you need for the fall.
5.0,"I was not expecting this to be as nice looking in person as it is, but it is great. It is a nice stretchy fabric so I bet it is flattering on lots of body types. It is long, but the cut outs make it a little more fun. The sleeves are very long but not enough to really bother me. My only complaint is that the zipper stops a little high (would be nice if it went down further to make it easier to get on/off in both directions)."
5.0,"I work out A LOT.  5 bare classes a week and hike up to 40 miles a week.  I have all the LULU and Lucy.  I had decided Zella was my fave and thought I was getting a deal, at 52.00.  These pants are AWESOME.  They come with a tag that says 78.00 and I would believe it.  I had bought some Athleta, but they were see through when I bent over.  No one should be able to tell what color my panties are in my work out pants!  I am 5'10&#34; 150, bottom heavy, small through waist, normally wear a 6/8 in American sizing, but waist is a 4.  (Bless my seamstress)  I got a medium.  I will keep them as my bloated day work out pants, but will order smalls next time.  Mediums stay put but a little loose around my waist. These are nice and thick without being hot.  A good capri length even though I have 34&#34; inseam, they still come several inches below my knee. I am going to order more.  I mean I can get 4 pairs for what you pay for 1 of the other guys!!!  I have not washed yet.  If they go bad, I will come back and update."
5.0,Great addition to my charms
5.0,Fabric was a little rougher than expected but still a cute top for going out

5.0,Arrived in time. Excellent product with authenticity certificate.
5.0,I was looking for a semi cheap but nice pair of sunglasses for the summer and I was so glad when I found these. I love the color and the frame sits nicely on my face. Also the fact they came in a nice sturdy case that I can take with me was a nice edition.
5.0,This watch is really cool! I love the rubber material and it fits comfortably. I wear it with my workout gear or when I'm working.
5.0,"We purchased this for a birthday present and it was adorable.  It glows really brightly.  It is smallish, but that is what we wanted and expected."
5.0,Great; comfortable to wear at home.
5.0,Apsalutly love them light up real well.
5.0,Loved how comfortable it fit and the quality was very good.
5.0,This watch is more than i expected is really classy it look better on hand than on computer if u like these type of watch don't hesitate to buy this one really really nice and solid feel
5.0,"Size s5 for adult wrist, not baby. Great product"
5.0,I love Patricia Nash! This brand always speaks for itself. I needed a larger size due to inside being stiff and limited on space.
5.0,This is just looking nice bracelet. So pretty!<br />I’m satisfied.<br />Thank you.
5.0,theyre fine exactly like described
5.0,Great belt great fit quick delivery good quality I am sure I will get lots of use out of it
5.0,The bag is very cute and will be used to hold a bunch of little gifts.
5.0,Nice glasses...quick shipment
5.0,Love these compression sleeves! My only regret is not buying them sooner! I was starting to feel shin splints coming on so I decided to purchase these to see if they helped at all - & they did! Wearing these sleeves during my runs in addition to icing my shins has worked wonders and in just a week I am back to running pain free!
5.0,This is a beautiful bead.  it is made well and sparkles beautifully
5.0,Doesn’t seem like a cheap lanyard by the looks and feel of quality. And I’m glad it was! I’m happy with this purchase. Very cute and vibrant design.
5.0,"This is so comfy. Thick, smooth material and stretchy!"
5.0,I weigh 130 pounds I am 5’9” and this fits me great I got a medium it’s my favorite swimsuit
5.0,Love softness of fabric and unique prints available!
5.0,"love these, ready to order more colors"
5.0,"Such a great bathing suit! If you are feeling insecure in a two piece, I recommend ordering this bathing suit! It is sexy and even my husband said that this is more sexual than wearing a two piece. So fun to wear! The only downside would be if you were planning on laying out... the tan lines would not be fun!"
5.0,"I can't wear any type of pierced earrings, so these are perfect and look exactly like pierced hoops that I used to wear.  Love them."
5.0,My cork soles on my Birk’s were looking raggedy and looked like they were disintegrating.  I used the cork sealer to coat the damaged area. This stuff goes on looking white but after a few minutes dries clear. I did 3 pair of my shoes and the cork looks like new. Great product.
5.0,Just as pictured! Perfect price and love the colors!
5.0,Nice.....wear it at the gym.....just the right size.....
5.0,"It’s fleece lined, quite snug and very warm. Especially nice if it’s windy. Worth every penny and am enjoying it. Don’t know when I’ll need another but would definitely repurchase."
5.0,"I received these sunglasses for a discounted price. The sunglasses look great. My husband wore them playing golf this past weekend. He said he really enjoyed them. The only recommendation I have concerning these glasses is that, a hard case with the glasses would have been nice. Even if you had to pay a little extra. It would be worth it."
5.0,This is a nice watch.  Very classy looking for the price.  I'm pleased with this purchase.
5.0,"Good looking from a little distance, I like the dress but reminds me old lace curtains."
5.0,love it.  Fits as expected
5.0,"Very nice, excited for using them at my bridal shower this weekend."
5.0,Sooooo comfy. Love these!
5.0,"When Virginia claimed that ""Virginia is for Lovers,"" we responded with ""Maryland is for Crabs."" This apron is perfect for a Marylander. We love it!  I just ordered two more."
5.0,Product arrived quickly and fit product description.
5.0,Protect my fingers while working on equipment with small parts.
5.0,"As an adult-I can wear this. Its not charming or functional, but I just want to state an adult head can fit into it if you try. The &#34;baby sheep&#34; design is adorable, and my daughter wore this with her snow suit to have a hat/scarf that tucked down inside her still-too-big snowsuit. Unlike the photo shows, my daughter's face was still &#34;inside&#34; the hood part, for a better wind break, which I like.<br /><br />Shipping...was weeks out. I'm spoiled by 2 day shipping, so I had completely forgotten I had ordered this by the time I showed up. Thankfully it was still winter, but I also think my little one will be able to wear this next year also."
5.0,Works and fits I love it 🎅❤️
5.0,"I give it 5 stars for great fit, style, quality and overall beauty.  The fabric is nice and solid, but soft.  I expected some flimsy cotton, but was very pleasantly surprised at the good quality. I originally ordered in my regular MED size, but had to exchange for a LG, as it is quite form-fitting and the MED was a bit snug for my taste.  I am a size 8 and the large fit perfect without bumps or lines."
5.0,I'm an 8/10 and the M fits perfectly. It's flattering because of the pattern and the fabric gathering in the front. It's great!
5.0,I appreciate this company a lot! They accidentally gave me the wrong name but they fixed it real quick and replaced it. It came out beautiful and good quality! Recommend them.
5.0,I use these to protect my head and hair from ticks and keeps it out of my face so I don't keep touching my face.  It works for what I need it for.
5.0,Lightweight and beautiful. Basic hoop kicked up a notch!
5.0,"Super cute and adds that wee bit of ""artist"" to any outfit."
5.0,Light and beautiful. Good for the price.
5.0,Cute.  Looks like picture.
5.0,This neck scarf is excellent.<br />Not too thick and the placement of the badge in the photo is incorrect.<br />The neck scarf should be worn folded and therefore the patch will be placed at the top/near the neck area.
5.0,I LOVE I Repeat I LOVE Theses Bras !!!!!! They Are Gorgeous ! & Fit Perfectly!!! Came Earlier Then The Date Expected !! Ordered Dec.9 And Recieved Today Dec 13. (Expected Date Was 15-20) I'm Definitely Ordering Again !!!
5.0,My man loves it ! Perfect for traveling or just wanting to feel amazing walking around the house 😍🤦‍♀️😂

5.0,Exactly as described and expected
5.0,"I’ve ordered twice already. Flattering shape, look expensive."
5.0,So cute! love them!!
5.0,Perfect dress! I couldn't be happier. I got for a wedding and I struggle to find dresses long enough and this was the perfect length! I'm 5'9 145lbs and medium was perfect! I got the watermelon red and the color came as pictured.
5.0,Ordered for my very cold natured dad. He loves. He says they keep his feet warm without cause his feet to sweat
5.0,Would  order c again
5.0,Love all of them and the colors are beautiful lots of compliments too!
5.0,This is a great product. Our use them daily to keep from losing my glasses. Have not had any problem with them at all.
5.0,Fun suit with a little flair--and flare! Fairly modest without looking old ladyish.
5.0,I wish these were in stock again. I purchased this @ used it on 2 international flights and it held up beautifully. The spinner wheels work amazingly (unlike other sets I've purchased). Looking forward to these becoming available so that I can get another one!
5.0,"I am very pleased with this bra. It doesn't provide a lot of support (for yoga, not running) and it doesn't do anything to &#34;shape&#34; you. But I wanted a pretty strappy back, and this is perfect. I usually wear a 36C or D with an underwire, so wasn't sure what to expect. I ordered a large and it is just right. I'll be getting a black one next!"
5.0,REALLY NICE GIFT
5.0,No this is a quality product took a couple of days to get to me but it great condition I ordered two just to ensure they had one on hand total Designer dupe! First pair broke . Second pair a little tight gives a headache at times but I’m<br />Literally in love and for the price point - worthbit
5.0,Loved it I bought it for my best friend!! She loves it
5.0,Hats looked very nice
5.0,"Shipped timely and great quality, well worth it"

5.0,Great quality and color! Lights can be set to be still or flash!
5.0,"The first one I bought turned out to be a little on the small side, so I got another one in a bigger size, and it fits perfectly. (Yes, I did measure before ordering.) The smaller one resides in my purse so it can go with me. The bigger one I leave in my car for everyday use.<br /><br />It's a clever design. After a little practice, I can now pop it on with little fuss. Love it!!<br /><br />Update: December 31, 2012<br />Still using this, and bought another one for 3 total. I keep one in my car, one in my hubby's car, and one in my purse. All three are holding up just fine. You do have to use a delicate hand while maneuvering it on/off and when cleaning it to avoid breakage, but mine have held up fine. Also, there's no scratches on my Rx glasses lenses from using this."
5.0,These are great lightweight gloves for chill weather.<br />Great insulation.<br />Not for use in blizzards or REALLY cold climate.
5.0,"What can one say. If you are looking at this item, you already have a Flex. You know how cool the car is, and well the key chain, just adds a little more fun factor for me. Zero issues with construction. I really appreciate the slender design of the blade. Barely noticeable in one's pants pocket."
5.0,Very nicely made and fit well.
5.0,I have very small boobs so that was an issue that can be fixed. Very nice dress for the price! Spanx will make it look great since it fits like a glove
5.0,Love love love these pant. very thin gerat for summer.
5.0,"This dress fit me perfectly.  I'm 5'6 and 130 lbs, measurements of 36"", 29"", 38"". I bought a medium and it is perfect. I have received many compliments and it is my most favorite of all of my dresses."
5.0,"These earrings are so cute. My cow-loving daughter is going to love them. Some reviews say they came tarnished, but mine were perfect."
5.0,Bought them for my wife and she loves them!
5.0,Love them and will order again

5.0,"Exactly as pictured. Was a Christmas gift for my husband who does a lot of the cooking. No problems with shipping, received it in plenty of time for the holidays."
5.0,My daughter is 5 but a little small for her age and usually fits 4T so I ordered a 4T. It fit her perfectly! She actually picked this dress out herself for her Daddy-daughter dance. My daughter loved it and it is a very beautiful dress!
5.0,"I was really impressed with this dress. The cut is excellent and the fabric is thick and plush. The length was good for me (5'4"") and was a little shorter than I thought it would be. So if you're tall, this may end of short for you. The waist is super flattering, and the neckline is low but doesn't expose your bra, even for a large chest. The sleeves have an interesting design as well. It's a keeper."
5.0,"I LOVED the style and fit of this!!! I am 115 lbs, 5'5, 34A bust, and the &#34;small&#34; size fit perfectly! Well made and tight/lose in just the right spots!"
5.0,I normally wear a 1 or 2 XL but got a 3xl in this shirt and it's still a bit tight.  They make them for little italian fellas I guess.  Love it anyway.
5.0,"This is my second purchase from this company and I am absolutely in love with their products!! They are great quality and do not hurt my skin. I love the screw on backs, I am no longer getting it poked by the back of the earrings when I lay den. They are durable and just simply the best. I don’t think I will purchase earrings from anywhere else from now on! ❤️"
5.0,Lightweight wrist watch. Easy to use and has the most used features (Alarm and stopwatch)
5.0,Very nice bracelet. I bought two as gifts. Looks great on the wrist.
5.0,"A beautiful piece but noticably fake looking, which was a tiny bit of a disappointment the center stone should be flatter so it does not sit so high and should come in smaller sizes but other wise very pretty.."
5.0,"Absolutely love the bright color, matches my berry skirt perfectly."
5.0,Bought this as a gift and it was very much liked!<br />Item was as described and was delivered quickly.
5.0,"Very cool, and sturdy craftsmanship."

5.0,"My absolute favorite joggers! Material is soft, stretchy and so comfortable. Pockets are a plus! Overall, they fit like a glove."
5.0,"This is a very well-made and good-looking hat.  The stitching is thick and well-done.  It's an attractive hat and also comfortable.  Since it is""one-size-fits-all, it may not be comfortable for everyone but so far everyone who has tried it on has said it fits.<br /><br />Very nice hat, a must for any Cubbies fan!"
5.0,"Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend, they are very nice quality."
5.0,"Perfect size. Not too small, not too big"
5.0,"It's perfect, just what I was looking for!"
5.0,Excellent quality. Fits perfectly. Love the dress.
5.0,Lightweight material. Very comfortable
5.0,Nice product... But! Delivery driver threw my package at my door and that's acceptable! Product was great as said above!
5.0,They are light and comfortable easy to take on and off I keep it around my neck when I don't need it and pull it up when I do
5.0,"Omg, I cannot explain how soft  this fabric is, the designed is actually printed in the fabric, excelent quality!  I'm so excited to use this and shoot some casual beach d.va material 🔥"
5.0,great buy again
5.0,love it. soft and fits well. got it for my Halloween costume but will probably end up wearing after. seems like it will last a while.
5.0,"This pack of nose rings are the perfect little studs if you are looking for something classy but cute. They were perfect for me because you get quite a bit in the case and they're inexpensive, and I'm constantly losing my studs. They have the tiny little ball on the end to make sure they stay put as well, and the gem in them doesn't look cheap. From now on, this will always be where I purchased my nose rings from. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review."
5.0,I really like this dress. Perfect for those that have to big arms and don’t like to show them...
5.0,I am a dog walker and my feet freeze in the winter but these boots with 2 pairs of socks are super warm. No more need to buy the toe warmers also sold on Amazon!
5.0,fits perfect ordered several cause they are worth every dollar
5.0,"styling is good, as well as band, star is the 6r15 movement.  I have not had to wind it with the 50 hour reserve."
5.0,"I'm 5'8"" 145#, 32"" inseam with athleticish legs, and I wear size 9.5 heels, 10 in flats. Overall the fit is like a US size medium. Waistband is snug but not too tight and doesn’t roll much. But did wear a skirt right where waistband is. Minor complaint for me is the toe sleeves could be a little longer. If you wear 8 or less in shoes they will be long enough. I’ve tried other 5 toe nylons. These have a little spacing between the toes, so much easier to get my toes started in them. There is a seam all through the toe area. So your toes will be cramped in shoe normally worn with regular nylons. Since there is nylon and 2 seams between each toe. The pantie area has a seam from front to back without a gusset.<br /><br />Update: these are size M-L. I also got this brand 5 toe pantyhose in M-L and L-LL. Which must be L-XL because they are bigger. Will review those later. All of these nylons had a chemical smell that seems to of washed out after 1 time hand washing and air drying. Unfortunately I like to keep original packaging, but the smell is from the bag each pair is packaged in and not going away. So recycle the bags and I’ll just use ziplocks."
5.0,Looks supper cute
5.0,So nice and fun!
5.0,Nicely made.  Good quality. Would buy from them again.
5.0,"Nice and long, covers rear. Pretty true to size maybe runs a little large if anything."
5.0,"Used this on 3 pair of Jordan's and I wish I would've taken before and after pics. I will give you guys tips after soaking overnight. Get a toothbrush to clean your shoes with and a small amount of baking soda. Even though I doubt I needed it with this product, I can't get out of old habits I guess. Very nice"
5.0,"Very, very comfortable shirt!!!"
5.0,Loved the bag! And it's as described! Good quality. Thanks!
5.0,"This bag is very good quality and extremely cute.  It may look kind of child-like but if you pair it with the correct outfit it is soooo cute! I matched this purse with some clear heels that have holographic straps.  So cute! I love it.  I probably won't wear it again, so it will be a great Christmas gift for my little sister!"
5.0,Light enough to see your dash cuts glare. Try them they may give you a mood
5.0,Perfect fit for Bilipi Halloween costume. Kids LOVED IT!
5.0,"Simple, adjustable, stylish, fits my fat head."
5.0,I like the fit for me. I am short waisted so the mid rise was fine. Great fabric-very soft and flexible for paddling.
5.0,I purchased this top in the light grey color size Medium.  I am 5'4 150 lbs and it fits me great. I find this top to be exactly as indicated in the photo and the material is even softer than I had imagined.  I highly recommend!
5.0,NICER THAN PICTURE!
5.0,I love these shades. They don’t get scratched even when I drop them. Grinding steel? No problem. I have a huge melon and they fit it wonderfully. I’ll never by any others. Customer for life.
5.0,I had to do some work to bring it in. I got a large instead of a small. The material is lovely and I will ware and it for a number of Halloween’s to come.
5.0,"love this watch band very sparkly, easy to put on and off, attaches very easily as well"
5.0,I ordered this just for a chance and I absolutely love the fit! I want to order more!
5.0,Durable fabric & the husband loves it
5.0,"Bought this shirt for my 11 year old son to wear as part of his Halloween costume. He loves it. He is a men's medium and it fits perfectly, length, girth and armholes. The material is nice and thick. It's been washed many times and still looks great, not fading, print is strong, no peeling or  cracking."
5.0,"I like that they say exactly what is fans think. Great product for die hard fans. Delivery of package was on time, this is the 2nd time I have ordered from them and will keep doing it"

5.0,Color is beautiful!  Fit is loose and forgivinv
5.0,I wore this stunning dress to my father n laws funeral and it was so appropriate for the occasion. The dress is very flattering as well! I felt very comfortable and I love the length.
5.0,"Please read the whole review because i have great things to say but also some critiques.<br /><br />Because of previous reviews, i messaged the seller after ordering asking if i could get my custom measurements and if i could change the length of the slip. The seller responded but amazon never notified me and the dress was shipped with a non-altered slip.<br /><br />The dress doesn’t fit me correctly but it is amazingly beautiful. The corset is amazing and supportive and the sleeves and skirt are poofy and gorgeous. The cups are a bit weird as they’re white, but i’m just gonna remove them and dye them. I’m going to return the dress and ask if the seller can make the adjustments because i absolutely love this dress and i’m hoping i can wear it to prom because it makes me feel like an absolute princess"
5.0,Omg they are sooooooooo cute! I didnt read the description carefully and I thought they would be bigger but thats perfect! My sister and I made necklaces for our family with them.  We made letter in a bottle necklaces and they are precious! Our family loved them at the reunion! Thank you so much!!
5.0,Great quality fabric. Soft and comfortable.
5.0,"These burp cloths are soft, absorbent and have a very cute pattern. These and regular prefold diapers are all I will use!"
5.0,Work in hospital. I use this to protect my hair from aerosols and germs in the air.
5.0,"I used the sides of these to repair my broken silhouette glasses.<br />once attached I removed my original Silhouette green trims and put them on these, worked perfectly.<br />I used a $58 tool kit also on Amazon to do the work,, still a bargain and set up for future repairs."
5.0,"Still waiting on the baby to come, so can’t say how it fits a newborn. However, VERY soft and beautiful material! And I love the hand cuffs. Bought this as a “take home” outfit but I’m very sure we will be using this numerous times as a sleeper just around the house!"
5.0,I will definitely purchase another pocket<br />Watch it was awesome..
5.0,This mask definitely comes in handy during this time for the Corona virus requirement. Lightweight and breathable
5.0,"amazing quality, awesomness! thanks a lot!"
5.0,Super soft. Neckline different shape. I love this item!
5.0,"Purchased two hoodies: Black and Beige. Both are very nice and fit perfectly. 5' 10&#34;, 145 lbs. and choose a medium. Leif Nelson makes unique and slim fitting items."
5.0,The colors are great! The chest could be a bit tighter
5.0,These are the first earrings that I have been able to wear in a long time. They're nice simple earrings that didn't bother my sensitive ears! My 2 year old didn't know what they were since I haven't been able to wear earrings in years.
5.0,Love em so much I got two pairs!
5.0,"Just love this! I am a huge tank girl and well, these are amazing during workouts. They do not roll up or move once they are on. I was so pleased a the length of them as well because I am tall at 5'10"". Some tanks are just not long enough."
5.0,"Inexpensive and colorful, with plenty of variety. Love them!"
5.0,"good material, fits comfortably"

5.0,Bought these for my daughter who plays soccer and needed to be able to breathe. Works wonderfully
5.0,"Fits perfect!!! It is true to size, I ordered a M and for reference I'm 5'0' and 135. Covers my mommy tummy and no hemming!!! Ordering more!!! I also bought a little black waist belt to make it alittle dressier. Perfect for my upcoming beach vacation. Only downfall is you can see the outline of your bra through the thin fabric but hopefully that can be remedied by a nice new bra!!!"
5.0,I love this dress i maybe could have gone up one size.<br />I ordered a small and it’s a tad tight and short but i don’t mind.<br />If you don’t want it tight or short i definitely recommend going up a size.
5.0,Like the product they are soft and they dont slip off.
5.0,My nephew loved them and they fit great.
5.0,Wearing them now!  So soft. Comfortable. Just enough stretch.
5.0,"Got this and the green one. I’m 5’4”, 170lbs, bought the large. This dress fits perfectly, and the flaring really helps hide the mid drift."
5.0,Ordered for my youngest daughter an she absolutely was pleased with her order. She even wore her custome to school an even to the mall an people loved it . Will definitely order again
5.0,The material is so soft and the embroidery is simple but stands out. The fabric is one of those wrinkle free materials which I loveeee bc who has time to iron everything everyday?! There were a few snatches on the seams and around the buttons but nothing a little tug couldn't fix. I ordered a medium because I wanted it a little loose and I'm tiny but it's just loose enough not like a bag. It comes under my behind so depending on what you're looking for it's appropriate for dress pants to tuck in and to leave out but also with jeans for a casual look. I'm really glad I purchased this and from this company (sometimes you order fro amazon and receive stuff material) but not in this case and I'm looking at other shorts in their store:
5.0,It's a great quality cup . Bigger than I thought. But my fiance is a gamer he's going to love this gift. I got it for our Anniversary.
5.0,Definitely will show some side boob so make sure you’re aware of how much side skin shows. Fabric is super soft and comfy. Fit a little more snug than anticipated but overall a really nice shape.
5.0,Excellent fit for my 20 month old boy. He love it now that it keeps his pants from falling off.
5.0,Thick. Great for winter. High quality difficult to rip.
5.0,I love these pants.  They are comfortable and fit great.  The pockets are snap buttons so snap them closed when you wash/dry them so they don't wrinkle and curl up.
5.0,I purchased these for my husband who has plantar fasciitis. He enjoys the high/firm arch on the inserts but noted that compared to some these don’t offer much cushion at the heel. They definitely work for their intended purpose.
5.0,Great design for a comfortable fit and durability. My grandson was quite pleased. I will definitely be back to buy more when he needs them!
5.0,I bought this watch for my husband for his birthday. I loved it but the two tone isn't something he's ever gone for so I was a little nervous if he would like it. We own 20+ Nixon watches between the two of us. He absolutely loves this one. It looks even better in person. So happy with the purchase as always
5.0,My daughter’s friend who is an avid Cricket player LOVED this bday gift . great quality and design too .
5.0,"My goodness what a practical stroller.  Genius design.  Lightweight, easy to fold after some tries naturally, and well built. We took it overseas then brought it back home and are raving about it.  Saved our baby and us peaceful trip.  Buy, buy, buy!"
5.0,I use while sewing.
5.0,I purchased a small and the quality was beyond any Halloween costume that I've ever bought and I have a lot of costumes.  The material the layers the fabric is so nice.  I highly recommend!
5.0,"Love the quality and color. Looks like the photo. Thicker, quality cotton. The snaps hold well even when the little one is very active."
5.0,Omg what beauties these are! I fell in love with these from the moment I saw them. They fit so perfectly on my wrist and are eye catching. I bought these for Christmas gifts and I know that they will love them too. I am not much of a jewelry wearing person but these I would wear these  all the time!<br />The beautiful craftsmanship on the designs are amazing as well! Thank you so much for making such a beautiful product and sharing it with the world
5.0,Absolute perfection !
5.0,This is a nice shirt. It's well made and comfortable.
5.0,"If you’re looking for a sign to buy these Lululemon Align dupes, THIS IS IT! These are literally so comfy and cute. Near exact dupe for the Aligns. These are only $28 and are exactly the same quality and design as the $98 Aligns I bought from a Lululemon Athletica outlet store. I don’t think I will ever be purchasing the originals anymore since these dupes are amazing. I will definitely be ordered more colors once they restock in my size (XXS)."
5.0,Bought these for my granddaughter and they are soft and fits nicely.
5.0,I bought these for my mom for Christmas. She loves hummingbirds & dangle earrings & real sterling silver. Very good quality & she will love them.

5.0,Exactly what we needed to keep track of sunglasses

5.0,Beautiful shoe.  Very comfortable.
5.0,"Love the softness, comfort and warmth.<br />Bought them for a gift for driving gloves."
5.0,"Perfect pants.  So glad I ordered two.  The perfect pants because they have drawstrings and pockets.Very nice material and very confortable to wear.  These will be my go to pants.  I absolutely love them.<br />If I could offer one suggestion.  Please make them in colors.  Maybe Navy, Charcole,and Brown.  Iwill order 2 of each and get rid of  my other pants.  Great job on fit and style."
5.0,Beautiful...Love it!
5.0,Love it . Got the same one for my sister :-)
5.0,Great very cute
5.0,Beautiful and easy to exchange. Can gobwith every outfit. Woohoo.

5.0,The shirt is a bit slippery material but I love the style - I am short so it is a little long but I am very happy with the way it looks and fits!
5.0,Love this T-shirt and get lots and lots of compliments every time I wear it.  Only thing I wish I would have known it the fabric has quite a bit of stretch to it.  Order 1 size smaller that you usually wear.
5.0,Very like this product 👍
5.0,"Lots of compartments, light material. Great adjustable shoulder strap so you can have your hands free while shopping."
5.0,Super comfy boot - could def walk around in these all day long!
5.0,"I like nice sunglasses but they are so expensive at department stores..These were $80 cheaper than anywhere else I had found. They are comfortable-the most important thing, nice quailty, not small but kind of big which is what I like. They are prettier than photo here on the page.<br />I like a lot."
5.0,"Good color, holds up well in the wash. This was a gift for my husband, he wears them so I assumes he doesn't find them uncomfortable. I think they make him look very good."
5.0,"I first started getting these toe rings for a friend and myself as a joke, but turned out that we love them and you don't have to just wear them on  your feet.  They also make really cute and conversation starters as a pinkie ring.  The almost invisible band that goes either around your toe or finger make the total effect really nice.<br />The Seller has wonderful prices and good shipping (quick and fair in price) along with a huge selection of different items.  After about 6 months and a ton of wear one (1) of my frog tow rings bit the dust, but never fear, I had backups in all different colors. If you like to be different try any of their products.  Recommend Seller and Products."
5.0,PLEASE RESTOCK PLZZZZZ I NEED THESE FOR A OUTFIT AND THESE ARE PERFECT FOR IT AND I CANT FIND ANYTHING LIKE THESE ANYWHERE ELSE PLEEEEAAASSSSEEEEE🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😫😫😫😫😫😫😫💔💔💔💔💔💔💔

5.0,Awesome sunglasses for the price - my husband loves them
5.0,Excelente el producto 👌
5.0,"I have already worn these earrings four times since I have received them, and everyone gives me tons of compliments.  The plated white gold shines so bright. Also, you cannot even tell the cubic zirconium is as such. They shine also like little crystals.  The size is smaller than I expected. I was expecting the earring to cover my entire earlobe, but when they came and I tried them on, they were not as big. But I like them this size. They are not over powering. I can wear them with casual clothes and when I want to dress up for date night. I like the fact that these are considered unisex. My brother wears earrings and he has asked to borrow these.  I like how the earring posts are strong, and that I can trust that they will not bend.  I also like that the earrings backs go on strongly.  They will not slide off during the day like most of my other earring back do. It is like they were made and fit to these metal posts.  I also like that the package came with spare earring backs in case I lose them. I really like these earrings and I think I will buy a few to give out at Christmas.<br />*Disclaimer* I received this product for free or deeply discounted for reviewing purposes.

5.0,Socks are very good quality!  Very glad I purchased them.
5.0,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. This dress works so well as a slip that I ordered it twice."
5.0,This hat fits and looks great.!!
5.0,Really helpful product
5.0,This cape was as pictured and expected.
5.0,I have numerous MK bags and wallets myself.  This was a gift to my niece!  She went nuts and loves MK now  too!  Amazon has the best prices on MK products!  Highly recommend
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted, VERY warm and luxurious robe that fits perfectly! Color is gorgeous!"
5.0,The earrings were as advertised.  Quality workmanship.  The only recommendation would be to change the backing to a more balance metal.  Highly recommended.
5.0,"I love the high banded waist and the feel of the material! Wore these to yoga tonight and they were perfect! Comfortable and not see through. I will be buying another pair! I bought a size XL and I am 5' 3&#34; around 200lbs. They were not too short or too long, had about two inches from my ankle exposed."
5.0,"This dress was a little roomy in the top and had to be hemmed, but overall it was an eye-catching smash."
5.0,Makes a great gift for a senior soccer player
5.0,Love it... ....will buy again
5.0,The canisters screw together. Each canister is the lid of the one below. Very clever!<br />Easy access to oodles of small itty bitty stuff. I use it for M2 and M3 fasteners. Perfect.
5.0,Love it. Very comfortable fashionable
5.0,Nice bag. The material is nice and sturdy.
5.0,"Cute, light weight and fun!"
5.0,Great for super comfy and cute
5.0,I bought this for my 3 year old son and it fits perfectly. I wanted him to dress up for Thanksgiving in a nice outfit. It's great.
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised with the quality It keeps perfect time! It took a long time to get here but It was less than $3 for The watch & shipping! It came from Hong Kong! I wish I would of bought a couple more for my Grands & Neices!! I'm keeping this one for myself!! Thanks!!
5.0,"Love these earrings!  These are great, versatile earrings that go with just about anything and can be used to dress up/down anything.  They are a fabulous deal for the money and I will be a return customer!"
5.0,"These are big goggles and definitely stand-out in a crowd; however, I feel that wearing them with a mask (or double mask) provides more safety than just wearing regular glasses  or safety glasses. They fit to the face at every angle and do not fog! I recently had to fly and wore them in the airport and for the duration of both flights, along with double-masking. The fact that fit so perfectly makes me feel safer and I love that they don't fog in the slightest. I highly recommend these if you need some serious protection during this pandemic or for any reason."
5.0,Perfect summer dress. Comfortable & cute. The material is very soft. I want to buy this dress in every color!
5.0,worked well nice and big for the dog
5.0,Very sexy but tight and revealing
5.0,"I bought this dress in search of a white summer dress. It fit as expected: I wear a size 14/XL, 5'5.5&#34;, 180lbs, and the size 0X dress I ordered fit just as expected. It fits more like a fitted-but-not-tight bodycon dress moreso than as an A-line dress, as it was described. As I'm 5'5.5&#34;, it fell below my knees, but pulling it up to just above my knees makes the dress more flattering for my body shape (curvy), so you should consider your height if you don't initially love it. Once I get it tailored, I'm sure I will love it. Also the placement of flowers is really good at hiding flaws that may have been visible otherwise. It also allows me to avoid wearing any shapewear or special underwear. I'd highly recommend this dress."
5.0,I sent these to my Granddaughter she is<br />6 she loves them they are pink and red<br />I will be ordering more<br />They are made well fast shipping<br />Y wont be sorry<br />Great shoes for kids
5.0,Love it! Easy to size down.  Ordering another for a friend who admired it.
5.0,"Great bundle. I love the variety of design and size. It may be all in my head, but I think it really does help with my aches and pains. My previous ones broke and the beads went flying everywhere (playing with my pooch outside) and I figured I could live without one. Well after a week I &#34;felt&#34; the difference. I've given these away as gifts and they are really appreciated."
5.0,Love this! It's nice and cozy and I have received tons of compliments!
5.0,"By far the best dress I’ve ordered from amazon! Looks so classy, good material, and tassels are SO CUTE"
5.0,"Love love love this dress. The material is perfect; it is thick and not cheap looking. I bought a small plus and I’m 5’7” and the front was just below my knee. For anyone looking for a nice, classy dress, you cannot go wrong on this one."
5.0,"I love this bowtie. With the adjustable sizing, I was able to use it for my 7 year old as well as my 9 month old. Will purchase more in different colors. Was a huge hit when both wore it!"
5.0,This skirt is so flattering!
5.0,"Good quality but not true to size, needed 1/2 size larger than usual."
5.0,"Exactly As described, real pretty and sparkly, exactly what a girl loves!"
5.0,"Needed some black shoes for soccer refereeing. These fit the purpose and, with  yellow highlights, compliment the referee uniform.Great shoe. Good traction. I like these  better than my Saucony Cohesion 9's which look very similar. They are a little heaver than the cohesions but will keep my feet dryer."
5.0,cheap but good quality!
5.0,Inexpensive and very nice!
5.0,Love this dress. A little thin but works out with having the long sleeves
5.0,Comfy and fun
5.0,"beautiful, well made, stitched beautiful. BUTTTT too small even though i measured and bought one size up, even let out the sides with the extra given but still could nit fit. Buy like 3 sizes bigger to get the fit. Worth the money though. Its gorgeous"
5.0,"Great boots for walking in the rain, and they look nice too."
5.0,Looks nice but not put together well falls apart.
5.0,"Beautiful the fabric is waterproof as far as I can tell ,at  least by the meaning that if you spilled something on it you could wipe it off. The colors are very bright, the inside was pink, I've been looking for a really nice pink for the summers and this is perfect, I  love the fact that I can have two different purses at a blink of an eye, you wont be disappointed with this bag, seller said it was used , but looked brand new to me, the shipping was very fast. The dimensions  are perfect ,not overly large but not too small either. This bag is perfect for teachers, students ,or  anyone wanting that nice size tote to carry."
5.0,"I love these.  Received a lot of complements.  Seem sturdy, come with a bag.  I've only had for about a week so far so hoping they last awhile.  Thinking of getting another pair!"
5.0,The recipient wore it all day on Christmas and absolutely loves the Stetson Fedora as he owns an Italian Restaurant

5.0,Very cute on. Warm like sweatshirt.
5.0,Per the size chart got a large for my son and they are extremely large .. the leg part is ridiculously long
5.0,So comfy and warm and long enough for me. 5'2. Pockets could be situated further to the side so that when you're bundled up they can be easily accessible.
5.0,This is just as it is sturdy  and as it is depicted on the picture and more. An excellent bargain.
5.0,The quality is good and the size great for me. I just wish they came in different color frames. The gold color stands out to much for me and takes away from the color of the lens . But otherwise there pretty cool.
5.0,These are super cute and fit my 4 year old perfectly!
5.0,"Top-notch quality and workmanship.  Sizing/fitment was spot-on; keep in mind however that this ""newer"" version of the Open Road sits a bit higher on the head than the ""old"" version.  The only thing I can think of that I feel Stetson should do differently with the Open Road, would be to make the medium brown version more widely available."
5.0,Fuu oh stop great and looks great.
5.0,Great product! Arrived promptly and without damage to the packaging or the item itself.
5.0,Very happy with this shirt!!

5.0,Really like the Tri-Mountain shirts.
5.0,Excellent shoe and fits perfectly!!
5.0,"I'm 5'00"" and this dress is just barely not touching the ground length. So light and flattering. Love wearing this dress! This is my second dress in different color. I bought blue a couple years ago and still love it, so decided to buy a different color ;) My favorite summer dress."
5.0,I got these for two young children (5 and 1) and they fit so well! They come in an incredibly sturdy case with a bag and cleaning cloth. So two glasses and all the extras...incredible deal.

5.0,Weight of fabric is good. Size is perfect. Exactly as described.
5.0,Good product fast shipping.
5.0,The band is very pretty and it was easy to install. The only issue I have is tightening the band on my wrist.  I have to hold the ends of the chains with my teeth and then push the release button to tighten it up. I still think the band is worth it. It is so feminine.
5.0,I read the other reviews and ordered 1 size larger and it fits perfectly.  Love the flow and symmetry of the shirt.  Fabric is nice and smooth as well.  I will buy from this designer again.
5.0,Super cute- fit great. I’m 5’9 ordered a medium the length and fit was perfect.

5.0,"Perfect for a day at Disney. Great price, def recommend purchasing your Minnie ears prior to Disney, you’ll end up paying close to $35 there for something you’ll wear what? Maybe once?"
5.0,Buy them x large. Washing them makes them go down a size. They fit comfortable. Excellent material
5.0,I like the fact that they fit and the fact that I really won’t be able to lose them. They are pretty and affordable.
5.0,Great product I bought 8. Not offensive.
5.0,Lovely and nice handbag
5.0,Love it! Definitely my new favorite hat!

5.0,I really like the flower
5.0,"Perfect! Except if it’s a little tight, it’ll pop open when you bend over."
5.0,Queda de lo más bien a mi me gusta
5.0,great goggles
5.0,Cute! But runs large. Definitely go 1 size down.
5.0,Fit my five (size 12) and six year old (size 1) perfectly for soccer. There's room to grow so I'm expecting they will be able to wear them for next couple years

5.0,"It is just like it's described, like the light pink color. Will buy more."

5.0,Great  shoes
5.0,Blingy mask that I got so many compliments on .
5.0,Work clothes
5.0,The Classic casio's watch simple and reliable is a great choise
5.0,Great watch! Highly recommend!
5.0,"I purchased a pair of 9's because that's the size street shoe I wear. When I first put these on, they seemed to be too tight & I thought I couldn't wear them, as they're pretty stiff. But as I wore them they broke in real well. I've been in the snow & cold & these keep me warm & dry, which is what I wanted. These Go on & come off pretty easy & are not hard to lace like boots. They look to be well made, with good quality material, & look like they'll last a long time. So, all in all, with the price I paid for these, they are well worth it. I've just ordered a pair of the black ones. I would recommend these to anyone looking for this type of winter shoe/boot."
5.0,"Ok I only paid .99 cents for this and I was worried the inside might be the kind of finish that rubs off after you wear it a couple of times, Boy was I wrong! The flower cut is great it really shows through and the inside is this really smooth surface it feels like a highly polished stone almost, I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, except it is very smooth and comfortable. It is polished stainless so it shines. I've gotten so many compliments and you cannot beat the price."
5.0,Almost returned cuz they are so stiff. I have wide feet too. How we i wore them one day and broke them right in! I love them and they are a great price!!!
5.0,Loved this dress so much I bought it in three other colors.  As a tall gal 5'-10&#34; it hits the tops of my feet...how rare is that to get a long dress that is actually LONG?!  The shoulder straps fall a bit wider than most dresses which is perfect for hiding my bra straps and not having to fidget with them all day long.  The v in the back is just low enough to be cute but not so low it shows your bra.  The fabric is thin so definitely a Spring/Summer dress but not so thin you can see through - perfect perfect easy dress.
5.0,Breathable did I mention Breathable and cute
5.0,My son loves these. Well made
5.0,Very pleased with this bag. I received it in 11 days. It is high quality and well made. It is quite small on the inside so don't expect it to hold a lot. I'll probably keep a larger purse in my car just to hold my other non-essentials.
5.0,Love these and they go with everything and my 1 year old doesn't slip and slide any longer.
5.0,Super cute and magnets function well. We don't notice when they attach all the time until we go to let go of one another's hands 🥰
5.0,These fit very well and are exactly what I was expecting and needed.
5.0,"These pants are good for dress wear casual wear any type of day. The material is beautiful, and made of excellent quality. I bought VIV pants maybe a year ago maybe longer and loved them. But wasn’t able to find them again until just last week. The fit is like they were made for me so before I loose you guys again I’m buying every color I use in my wardrobe. Thanks for coming back VIV. Very pleased customer"
5.0,"Wear this dress everywhere- work, travel, parties- it's so versatile!  I hand wash and hang to dry; steam to wear.  it's the best!!"
5.0,not the same color of my pendant but I still think it is a pretty piece of jewelry
5.0,Fits very snugly and a little long but I love them
5.0,"Best pair of sunglasses I've owned. Especially for the money. I have to complaints, they look great, they shipped fast, and they protect against the sun really well. The little bag they come with is great too. Oh and if you've seen the movie Nightcrawler, they look just like Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Louis Bloom's sunglasses. Seriously, like exactly like those."
5.0,Useful and cute day of wedding gift to the groom!
5.0,This makes your Fitbit look 10 times better. I use my Fitbit at work in an office and this looks very classy. I've gotten some really nice complements and this stainless steel band doesn't cost a lot of money. Links are adjustable for different wrist sizes.
5.0,I like the length. The pockets are a plus. They are smooth with a light sheen to them. I think I'll buy another pair.
5.0,"I live in Phoenix, AZ.  I did 3 hours of yard work, when I took my sweatband off it was soaking wet and I could squeeze the moisure out. Not a drop of moisure on my face or glasses! 5+ stars!"
5.0,great quality of fabric and fits comfortably
5.0,I have bought several pair for grand & great grand kids
5.0,This is my second pair.  I had the first for two years before I lost them.  Comfortable and sturdy - a great combination.
5.0,Looks fantastic and seems to be great quality.
5.0,Good quality well design happy i bought
5.0,My daughter ordered this and she's extremely happy with it.<br />She wants more for Christmas.
5.0,I got these silk gloves for a 82 year old friend who always has cold hands while<br /><br /> sitting  watching T.V. at nite. Not bulky and does the trick.
5.0,Happy with what I got no complaints.
5.0,I love this dress!  I have two now
5.0,"For a replacement band, this one has a great price point. I do wish I had gotten to 2 pack though.<br />It was easy to install on my Galaxy Frontier watch.<br />The band does have a LOT of holes for the clasp. Im 6'2"" and 220 lbs but must smaller wrists than you would think. I have to use the 5ht hole from the smallest it will go. There are 7 holes left to move into which means there is a lot of band to keep under the strap. Not a big deal just throwing that out there.<br />Overall, it seems lie a great quality band and should be a good everyday use as long as you arent around things that would soak into it on a regular basis (i.e. automotive chemicals)."
5.0,"Love this necklace.  Have had a lot, but a lot of compliments too."
5.0,Excellent quality. I have them for almost two years and they wear well.
5.0,"Super cute ,came fast in the mail"
5.0,A favorite piece. Very important bc I have necklace with cross and now my fish.Episcopalian. :-) perfect.
5.0,"Holds cell phone, wallet, sunglasses, keys, compact, lipstick.. Nice for summer!"
5.0,Good material but small size
5.0,"I love the light look,very pretty and the packaging was good."
5.0,It arrived as expected. They Fit well and have withstood washing so far. They are great also because they are meant for bigger feet and are not at the top end of a size 6-12 limit which makes them more comfortable. Nice buy.
5.0,These shirt stays are very comfortable and work great.  As a tall person they adjusted to my height perfectly.  After a while you won't even notice they are there.  Best of all I don't have to worry about attaching the lower end to anything since I got the stirrup style.
5.0,This is a very nice little pendant. I really like it and have received compliments on it. It IS a little smaller than I thought it would be. But a very nice product for the price.
5.0,"I was so,happy that they fit, were comfortable that I ordered more."
5.0,I love this so much I bought outfits in every color it’s so comfortable
5.0,"bought this along with a bottom to compliment the outfit for my sis, she could not wait to wear it for a dinner event"
5.0,"Well made, very comfortable. Great band for the price! Super fast shipping."
5.0,Cute dress. Tons of compliments. Flattering for a pear shape and a fantastic value. Love this dress!
5.0,"This is quite comfortable, and works very well. I also tried the style that clips on the side of the pants, but I didn't like that style because it rubbed under my arm. However, this x-cross in the back lets me hook to my pants just like my other regular suspenders from them, and these are very comfortable for me."
5.0,The material feels like a waist trimmer so I think thats a plus because the point is to sweat and its a legging as well so you get 2 in 1!
5.0,"Everything went well.  The order came as designated in e-mail correspondence.<br />It fits a little too snug but I believe that this is due to the fact of where it was manufactured.  In the future I would order a size larger.<br /><br />Other than that, I am happy with the mdse."
5.0,"Beautiful wallet and well made! This wallet was designed for women who carry a lot of cards. Beautiful and practical layout. Holds many credit cards, large zipper compartment for change. And I bought another one for my friend!"
5.0,My sons love them. Very comfy and stylish 😉
5.0,I have gotten into gold jewelry lately and I love the look of stacked and layered pieces.<br /><br />This set is perfect for instant addition to an outfit. It would make an awesome gift for anyone in your life!<br /><br />Bracelets are nice quality too. Like that it is a mix of stretch and clasped.
5.0,With the heat wave in the eastern part of the country I wore this dress and it was so comfortable. Great fabric and fit.
5.0,"This umbrella was great! Easy to use and strong... Purchased a weight sand bag for added support, but probably didn't need it. Received a lot of compliments!"
5.0,This is compact and we have the option of using batteries or plugging it in.
5.0,I adore them!
5.0,Super fast shipping great condition new with tag exactly as described and on picture beautful wrapped. Thank you 5 stars
5.0,Great quality and vibrant color

5.0,Nice pair of cheap sunglasses.
5.0,You will love it
5.0,Perfect fit! Great material! Love it!
5.0,True to size cute dress
5.0,"These masks are great for people who have trouble breathing in a mask. I have asthma and I have a lot of trouble wearing the cotton masks. These are a dream and I feel like I barely have a mask on. These masks would also be good for people who need to wear a mask while doing something active like go to the gym. I wouldn’t say these are highly protective, but they’re adequate and fit well. The ear loops are also very comfortable. These fit an older child through male adult—they are very stretchy."
5.0,Looked perfect with my outfit. The earrings were too heavy like most review so I made a belt with them!
5.0,"I love this outfit for it's design, color and fit."
5.0,Very cute!! My 4 year old loves them I bought them for her birthday! They light up and are easy to get on and off.
5.0,"Love the mask, bought it for my 4 year old and it fit big, but fixed the elastic and he loves it."
5.0,"Stretchy material but not clingy. A little shorter then I prefer but I'm 5'9"" so many things are short on me. I wish this came in other colors. Very comfortable dress."
5.0,very nice and gold looking
5.0,"I want to live in this dress, it's perfect! True to size, flattering, and super comfy."
5.0,"Nice silicone seal.  Just larger than most lap pool goggles, but excellent for packing for a snorkeling outing."
5.0,I purchased the 3 pack and glad I did. These tops are perfect! I wore the white one hiking and living out West it gets HOT and this top protected my skin and kept me cool. Further more the white one in the picture had been washed prior so as you see it wears and washes well.<br />A must shirt in your exercise arsenal!
5.0,"Perfect for what I was looking for. Provides 'lift' when it's under my dresses, but not too much."
5.0,My girls loved it for our trip to Florida!
5.0,"Bought for wife, she enjoys them and wears them often. Very nice...look real."
5.0,Made a big difference at work where I am on my feet for at least 8 to 9 hours straight.
5.0,Came on time looks and fits great.
5.0,"For how inexpensive these are, they are pretty great shoes. I have worn them nearly every day since getting them, and they're quite comfortable, although there isn't much support... But that's generally what you get with flats. I expected them to fall apart after a few wears, but they are still going very strong months later. I will be purchasing another pair."
5.0,"It's a very comfy dress, but I wish it was a little shorter."
5.0,Love the necklace. It’s fairly heavy and feels well done.
5.0,Love it! It has lots of room!
5.0,The softness of the robe is excellent.
5.0,they do run small-buy one or two sizes larger. Grandkids love putting their slippers on as soon as they put on their pj's
5.0,Wear them ever single day. Not too big and not too small. Highly recommend!!
5.0,Gorgeous necklace! Shipping was fast and my sister absolutely loved it!
5.0,"These boxer briefs are really soft. The quality is good for the price. I bought them without reading the other reviews and got my usual size, but it's a bit snug, so I would advise to get 1 size larger. Overall, these are really nice briefs."
5.0,Very happy with my hat.
5.0,"My daughter loves this set, perfect for school! It washes well and did not shrink."
5.0,Great buy! Such a cute and elegant piece for such a low price! Highly recommend! Just as pictured
5.0,Great value for the money. Mom loved it because she's a huge elvis fan.
5.0,"These are so cute! They came exactly as expected, and much quicker than expected. They are good basic socks, nothing thrilling when it comes to the softness or fit. They are comfortable and strechy enough they should fit most feet."
5.0,It's the same size like the steward pin.
5.0,Nice daughter was surprised.
5.0,After reading other reviews I bought a smaller size than I normally would have. The dress fits and looks great! I can't wait to wear it to the banquet this Saturday
5.0,Sent out of the country as a gift
5.0,Pictures don't do this chain justice. i bought one a while back which my wife laid claim to and I bought another and both are of great quality. We have people asking where we got them everyday

5.0,KaChow!!!! Lightening McQueen for the win.
5.0,Wonderful dress looked beautiful . However it did not fit me and the next size would be too large .
5.0,"Fits as expected.  High quality, comfortable."
5.0,"Normally a size 2 (5’3 119lbs) so went with an ex small, however the dress was too large on me.  Sad because it was really cute."
5.0,Absolutely love this purse! I got the dark brown one. At first I was nervous that it was going to be too stiff and not have a little give but after a few uses it is definitely a cool purse! I love that it has two straps and I use the long body one often. The material is pretty solid and I like all the pockets it has inside. I now have a spot for my sunglasses.
5.0,Coloring is beautiful
5.0,"i love this beg, nice and big. good qaulity"
5.0,Fit perfect around neck and the sleeve length was spot on. The color was great too!
5.0,Fully lined warm cotton jacket at quite a reasonable price.
5.0,"This a keychain gets so many compliments.  I saw it and thought I have to get this childhood toy, a mini version of the Monchichi doll.  The purple fur is super soft and the bling is AWESOME!!!  I never lose track of my keys and did I mention all of the compliments, I think it's worth repeating."
5.0,"These yoga pants are very comfortable and fit me well. Most importantly, the waistband fits smoothly and does not give me muffin top even though I carry my extra weight on my waist. The fabric is not too thick or too thin so I don't feel overheated or overexposed. The fabric is not shiny and there is a hidden pocket. I will definitely try another pair. If you have a thin waist then consider sizing down."
5.0,I purchased for my sons birthday.  He loves it.
5.0,I love how this looks and it came just as I expected =)
5.0,"Always great!<br />light is never good, but it’s better than nothing.<br /><br />my second one since i wear the other one to death, and band broke. But it did last for 4 years and i never took it off."
5.0,This dress is beautiful  I just ordered  wrong size
5.0,"Light weight, Very pretty and sweet looking on. Love it for a modest but beautiful work day fit or brunch"
5.0,"Love , love love these sunglasses! Ordering more pairs... so many compliments!"
5.0,Being from Arkansas we are definitely not Bama fans. My husband loved this shirt! Bama fans at his work didn't like it as much. So needless to say the shirt served it's purpose.
5.0,Very cute and nice quality. Also great customer service.
5.0,"This dress is perfect for so many occasions! It hits me just below the knee and has a short slit in the back, so I’d definitely feel comfortable wearing it to work or church. The sleeves are nice and flowy. Would definitely recommend!"
5.0,Great sunglasses for the price
5.0,Handled the trip well. Good size. I loved it.
5.0,"I love baby Yoda, and needed a cute piece of jewelry, to go with my baby Yoda ears and shirt for Hollywood Studios for our Disney trip. It's good quality and fits perfectly. I love this style of bracelet and the baby Yoda is so cute!! Definitely worth the purchase"
5.0,Was a gift and we'll received.
5.0,Great quality similar to gymshark
5.0,"The product fits perfect, it’s very comfortable and has helped me with my legs. I have swallow legs and poor circulation.  The first day I wore them I felt a big difference .  It’s such relief in my legs, the swelling is down and I walk much better. I highly recommend them. Joyce"
5.0,Very nice I love it lots of compliments
5.0,Thank you my baby loved it
5.0,They were really nice glasses for the price!
5.0,"Quality built! Can't get any better, STRONGER than that."
5.0,"Great, can flip down for a frilly collar as well"
5.0,bought as a gift they loved it thank you!
5.0,Good quality product. Looks just like it is pictured. Size is accurate. Soft and comfortable.
5.0,Extremely comfortable. Runs true to size. One of my favorite shirts.
5.0,"I really like wearing these headbands for working out. They keep my hair in place and out of my face, they are super soft and not too tight. I love the colors! I also have the Maven Thread headbands in coral and grey stripes and they are going strong!. They wash well and are very durable."
5.0,I used this shirt to cover my upper body.
5.0,I bought these for the 4th of July and love them.
5.0,Love the fabric n design
5.0,Nice shirt. Lightweight fabric and well constructed. I'm 5-11 and 190 lb. A size large fit me well if a tad roomy.
5.0,"I got this Coai bracelet for my husband, and I am pleased. He isn’t into jewelry, except a wedding ring, but he likes that this bracelet is simple. It is well constructed and fashionable. It will match most outfits (casual to dressy) since it is just a subtle accent piece to an outfit. This bracelet is made of black onyx and seraphinite stone beads, which are strung through the middle and around the outside of each bead. The center or middle bead is seraphinite, dark green in color. At first glance this bead blends in, no big difference noted, but when the light hits it just right, you do notice a slight variance/a subtle design (in the green bead). Note: You can see it in the picture but in person, not so much. You can adjust it (to fit) by pulling the strings apart. The strings are accented by two smaller beads. It looks and feels substantial. There is some weight to it. Feels great on your wrist. This bracelet, while probably unisex, is masculine. Surprisingly, my husband really likes it. I’d recommend it."
5.0,I have to wear glasses and I love this pair and the color!
5.0,Very good comfortable fabric. Silky and breathable.
5.0,"I was impressed with the quality of the shirt. I’m fact, I ordered another one in a different color."
5.0,"I’m a huge fan of toe socks. I’ve worn them almost exclusively ever since a California company named Injinji introduced them in the early 2000s. The concept soon became wildly popular, and more companies came to market with their own interpretations of the style. I’ve tried many other brands over the years; some of them have been as good as the originals, and some have been bad (as in the heel ripping completely out after a few wearings).<br /><br />I’m happy to report that these OrrinSports Athletic Toe Socks fall into the first category.<br /><br />They’re quite thin, very lightweight and exceptionally soft. I’m not sure they’re best suited for really heavy-duty activities; even though they’re marketed for “running, hiking, walking,” they seem a little too casual for strenuous “athletic” applications. But they’re great for just lounging around the house, running errands, neighborhood strolls or other light-duty uses.<br /><br />The fabric is sufficiently elastic to accommodate a range of foot sizes. The Mediums that I got supposedly fit U.S. shoe sizes from 7 to 10, or EU 39 to 42. Strangely, there’s no distinction in the sizing information between men’s and women’s sizes, and there should be, because they’re NOT the same, at least for U.S. sizes. They’re not really “unisex,” as the sizing chart indicates. Right out of the package, these appeared way too small for my size 9.5 feet, but they stretched out easily and ended up fitting like a glove.<br /><br />I wasn’t wild about any of the gaudy color choices available—I prefer solid colors—but let’s face it, toe socks are fairly weird-looking under the best of circumstances, so their color scheme doesn’t make a lot of difference in the coolness factor, or lack thereof.<br /><br />These toe socks are supremely comfortable, and a welcome addition to my sock drawer. My only concern is that, because they’re so thin and lightweight, they may not last very long. I rate them at five enthusiastic stars based on my first impressions. If they should wear out too quickly or fail prematurely, I’ll revise this review."
5.0,I liked the fit and the fabric. Very comfortable and goes well with severAl different colors of pants
5.0,It is a gift for my Son in law.  He is a big Steelers fan.  I know he's going to love it.

5.0,Great shoe. I wear these everyday for work.  They're comfortable and light weight.
5.0,"These are great. They a bit weighty, but not in bad way. They are easy to attach to your hair. They really added to my succubus cosplay."
5.0,Love this ring so stylish.
5.0,"Don't mind the negative feedback's that others say with this product. For it's price, they expect heaven and earth. Item is pretty decent. leather is soft and the stitching is acceptable. Very comfortable on the wrist. length of the band is just right, not too short not too long. As for what other reviews mentioned, the RICH BROWN color is more on the ""Chocolate Cocoa"" tone. if you're looking for the reddish tone, go get the regular BROWN. Suits my SKX perfectly and gave it the vintage look I was aiming for. I was worried tho, In my order slip the size says 20mm even though I ordered 22mm. But when it came the size was correct. Quality was better than what I've expected. Overall satisfied."
5.0,I love these jeggings.  They are very fashionable and fit very comfortably.  Thanks.
5.0,Fits really well. True to size

5.0,Simple and easy to use

5.0,Perfect color to represent my FSU seminoles !!!

5.0,Just received my sloth hat and was surprised by the quality and fit.  Just as nice as my carhart hat but cheaper and with a sloth.  Win Win....Will by again.
5.0,"These really are amazing. I had a nice pair of emerald earrings that I was nervous to wear because the earring backs that came with the pair were too dainty. As soon as I put these on I could feel the difference (and hear them click into place!) It is very reassuring and I highly recommend them. I wish they were cheaper, but I am going to use this pair of earring backs with all of my earrings so I will certainly get my money's worth!"
5.0,Size was an exact fit. Fabric good quality
5.0,Like the color and the way it fits
5.0,Not a dressy dress. More casual but very cute and got perfectly. 5'6 180 I got a medium and it hugs. in all the right places.am Also is perfect length not too long or too short.

5.0,This was my daughters favorite. It was unique and cheaper than purchasing from a dance store or walmart.
5.0,"I loved the value for my money, 2 nice watches at one low price!"
5.0,"Although these leggings aren't made by Tesla, the car company, they're great!<br /><br />I don't overheat when working out with these at a heated indoor gym, and they keep my legs a bit warmer during cold days. More than the thermal aspect, though, these leggings provide great &#34;support&#34; down low and feel like second skin!<br /><br />I was worried that the seams might bother me when ordering, but I don't even notice them once I put the leggings on. Would recommend to a friend!"
5.0,Very attractive and nice quality!
5.0,"Nice blouse. I could have ordered a smaller size, fits big, comfy tho"
5.0,I love it. I'm 5-11 230 lb and it fits me perfect nice and long.
5.0,"Very happy with these pajamas. They fit my 4 year old perfectly. He wears a 5T so I ordered the 5 and the size was accurate. They washed very well and my son said they are very comfortable. The shorts are perfect for the hot summer nights here in Houston. The material is light, but not flimsy or thin. I am very pleased with these Pjs.  Disclosure!

5.0,I LOVE these rings! I wear them every day.
5.0,These are great i just loved them.
5.0,"I was worried it would be too small, but it is true to size. Super flattering, excited to wear out !"
5.0,"Bought for a bachelorette. Subtle, but still bridal. Good quality for the price. She has used it for a few wedding-related activities now and it still looks good."
5.0,I love these jeans and have multiple pairs and colors.  I wish they came in more colors. They fit wonderfully and are so comfortable. You can dress them up or down.  Looks and feels great.
5.0,You can wear them anywhere.
5.0,"Love it, comfortable. Does shrink a bit when wash and dried in dryer. If you like loose order one size higher. My 2nd purchase. Bought one loved it so much I bought  a 2nd one. Material is very good not flimsy. Definitely recommend!!"
5.0,"Great gloves, super comfy, order a size small though"
5.0,These plugs are great.  The variety of colors allows me to change them frequently and having so many allows for backups when others are lost.  Would definitely buy a again.
5.0,"Loved the item. It was a bit smaller than I realized, but is perfect for what I wanted."
5.0,"Good fit,Comfortable. Love it."
5.0,It hooks tight with no play and is easy to adjust
5.0,Bought it for my grandson’s birthday and he loved it. The quality and the fit were exceptional. Very satisfied with this purchase.
5.0,It looked small but it wasn’t perfect fit light weight since I hate sleeping in heavy gowns. Thank you
5.0,"Love, love, love my necklace it's perfect! Just put the name in the gift options and it turns out great! Shipping time was reasonable, came a little sooner then estimated. I just need another baby to order me a second one!"
5.0,The hat is much darker than the pic suggests.  The dark grey areas are black.  I love the color.  The hat looks like a quality piece except that the badge on it is a little crooked.  Hat is very thick and well worth the $9.00.  Don't hesitate buy this hat!!
5.0,"I love this shirt! Fits true to size. Very comfortable and soft. It's thin, yet, still warm for winter. I love the print. Overall, it's perfect. If they had other patterns, I would buy more!"
5.0,I like that it’s slightly loose so I have room to eat. But I’m petite for context in this review.
5.0,"It’s perfect, and you can refill it!"
5.0,Wearable out of the box. True to adidas sizing for soccer boots. Nice feel on the ball. Invest in a good pair of socks. The boots do rub at the back top of the heel. It’s not something that bugs you while running around.
5.0,I have this ugly body.  I am super hard to fit.  My nickname is Squatty Body.  You get the  picture.  These pants fit me to a t!  I have a VERY high rise and really hard to fit. I already have 3 pair of these in different colors.  I will be buying more!  I don't  remember ever wearing anything as comfy as these.  The fabric is so soft.  I even have a butt now.  I am thrilled to bits!
5.0,"I am an athletic size 6/8. 5'5&#34; about 132-135 lbs. and I am 43 years old. I chose to order the medium since it does have room to adjust. I do have the Velcro attached all the way to the snugger end but the skirt looks and fits great! I could go small or medium in this and be happy with either. I love the quality, feel and look of this adorable and sporty skirt. I have already ordered another one in the longer length as well and love it! Beautifully made! Nice job to the designer. I like to wear these with leggings underneath, very cute!"
5.0,Came as mentioned
5.0,Great eye pieces and the shipping was super fast!
5.0,I liked the value of the cap.
5.0,"Cute, well made shoes, but run just a tad small in my opinion"
5.0,"This has become my favorite headband. Unlike my two other pearl izumi head bands this one  covers more area around ears and back of head. Even though it is thicker and warmer than Pearl izumi it still fits perfect under my bike helmet. The inner fleece is very nice and keeps me warm on the winter morning commutes to work on my bicycle. Shipping was free and estimated for a month, but it came much quicker than that. Great vendor as well. They have great communication and made sure I was completely satisfied. I highly recommend to any biker or anyone doing outdoor activities. I look forward to doing business again with this vendor!"
5.0,My daughter loved wearing them!
5.0,I was looking for a bra that had a shelf-like fit so I wouldn't have to wear a tank top under every shirt during the summer (to keep long necklaces from falling in between). This bra is very comfortable and it has a little lift. It is not a sexy bra but it's a great bra for work or leisure.
5.0,Nice confortable top.  Can be wear as a swimming top as well.  Love it. Very sexy
5.0,These glasses are so sexy ... Just love them
5.0,Daughter loves this peppa pig umbrella
5.0,"Another great buy.  Fits great, and love the fabric.  Warm for the winter, fall months but not too heavy.  Love to wear these beautiful colors with LulaRoe leggings.  They really compliment each other."
5.0,Absolutely adorable!! I love how cute and dainty this jewelry is. Its easy to use and not gawdy or unpleasant to look at. Definitely adds a special flare
5.0,"I bought the cat bags specifically for my mom as a gift for mother's day. I have a set of my own, and had used them when shopping with her. She was very impressed on how small they were when all folded up and how easy they were to bring around and pull out whenever we needed one.<br /><br />These bags can hold a lot, and I mean A LOT, of stuff. Whenever I go grocery shopping with my mom, we are able to pack a bag full of heavy cans and jars no problem. It really just becomes a battle between how much you can put in the bag and how much you can physically carry yourself.<br /><br />Another great thing that I don't see many people talking about is the fact that you can wash the bags in the washing machine if something ends up spilling or the bags just get dirty over time. I myself sometimes use my bags to transport my houseplants, so there can be quite a bit of dirt and mud in my bags. I throw them in the wash and they are as good as new. They are so great for that reason alone.<br /><br />These are great to have for yourself or give as a gift to someone who you think could really use them. I bought them for my mom because of just the sheer amount of groceries that she goes through every week, and this way my parents wouldn't be drowning in plastic bags anymore. She loves them and uses them all the time now."
5.0,Amazing quality for the price. I bought this dress to wear to the KY Derby and was impressed with all of the amazing reviews. The dress hugs your curves exactly where it should! The one issue you may have is I found the top to be fairly large. I am a 38DD and was a little surprised at how much room I had in the bust area of the dress. If you're smaller chested you may have a little trouble filling in the top. Highly recommend and will be purchasing more in different patterns!
5.0,"Daughter Loved it... lots of room, stylish  & she loves  BLING"
5.0,Received lots of compliments!!!
5.0,Really cute although it is cut very low at the front. had to wear a bathing suit top underneath.
5.0,This is now one of my favorite dresses. It fits really well and has held up great.
5.0,"This is made of quality material, sewn and not iron on.  My husband absolutely loves it.  Even after several washes in a short period of time it is like new and threads are not coming loose. I was skeptical due to the lower price comparatively but it is great."
5.0,"The item work well! No problem, I love it!"
5.0,"Rich color, gorgeous print, lovely design.  I highly recommend this wrap.  It's made of rayon, though, so it does wrinkle."
5.0,"I got these fast, and I really love them! They are so soft, and very sexy. Loved all six colors!"
5.0,very comfortible
5.0,"I really really love this necklace! This necklace is very light, attractive, and classy. You can wear it when dressed  up or casual and look fantastic. This necklace won’t disappoint."
5.0,"This top runs big.  Im 5'5, 38D, 200lbs. Normally I wear XL but decided to order L and it fits perfectly.  The colors are vibrant. I ordered all three colors. Love them all! For a casual and business wear.  If you have rolls to hide or belly :)  this is a top for you."
5.0,"This is a nice, heavy watch. It looks professional and classy. This is my new date night/meeting/interview/special occasion watch until I can afford a more expansive watch. I'm satisfied and will recommend this product."
5.0,Fit to the tee! It's such a cute outfit!
5.0,"Soft, pretty color and I love the built in face mask. Washed and dried in dryer and it was really wrinkle free. Shirts are only one layer of face mask protection but I use it to cover my N95. It’s also great if you forget a mask and need to run into a store etc.."
5.0,This item is perfect- fits and looks great. Exactly as described and fast delivery
5.0,"Exactly what was said and what was shown. I love these slippers, so super soft!!"
5.0,Oh how I love this head covering. It is very light weight and can be worn in a couple of different ways. View the videos on youtube and you will see.
5.0,Love the firey blue opal as it picks up and accents most blues and greens that are being worn. Plus it is a great price and goes awesome with the matching earrings
5.0,It looks perfect
5.0,"Here, these were perfect! I love these! They came exactly on the guaranteed date, and they were the EXACT color. And i'm glad they came with a nose plug, ear plugs, and a nice case to keep them in. I am so happy with these!"
5.0,Purchased for a birthday gift and she loved it!!!!
5.0,"These earrings are really nice, great colors, perfect size (3mm) and great price!"
5.0,"I love this piece! It's dainty, feminine, bright....I'll be getting more with Christmas coming."
5.0,really quite nice
5.0,"My grandson is  bit too young to wear this year but by next spring, they'll be just fine. Love the drawstring and the pockets"
5.0,I was looking for something warm and comfy and this was it! They got me through the freezing Ohio nights and love the colors! Nice!
5.0,This shirt is so dressy and great for work. I love it! I always tuck it in because it’s long in the front.
5.0,Liked warmth and doftnedd
5.0,I am a RPM instructor. I got these as a backup pair for my much pricier Shimano. They fit well and are great for the ride.
5.0,"Love it. 32D, 28 inch waist and I got a Medium! Very happy."
5.0,"Liked the price.  These are the same scarfs I buy at the drug or beauty supply store.  All items are a satin like material.  The scarfs are lighter in weight than some but still do the job of smoothing and protecting the hair.  The caps are a new item, that I haven't tried. So far my daughter likes them, says they stay on well when sleeping and she has been using them when exercising."
5.0,I like the jewelry set very simple and delicate . The price is very resonable.
5.0,Fits my FitBit Blaze Classic as advertised. Seems like durable construction. Have used it for several months with no issues.
5.0,"Definitely worth what I paid. Arrived early, fits well, reasonable quality."
5.0,It’s cute can’t wait to wear it on my birthday November 30
5.0,Love these.  Great for bikram yoga.
5.0,Looks and works great after 4-5 washes
5.0,I gave this bracelet to my niece for her birthday! She loved it.
5.0,"I really like these. They look super nice, the color is great, the material is so soft and stretchy and comfortable. Only thing I can say that wasnt 100% awesome was just that they run a little larger and I dont know if thats just because of how stretchy they are or what. But I assume that once I wash and dry them a couple of times they will shrink down a bit and fit perfectly. I would buy these again."
5.0,Very good product happy with it
5.0,bought it for my granddaughter and she loved oit
5.0,Love these! 2nd pair ordered!
5.0,Absolutely Beautiful!! It is everything i was hoping for!
5.0,"I bought this watch at WalMart in October 2017, it's the end of April 2018 and I have work this watch for more than 95% of the time in between. It goes in the shower with me, goes to work with me and goes to bed with me. This is a dependable freaking watch. 15$ has never been so worth it before. I can probably count MAYBE 10 times that I have taken the watch off for more than an hour"
5.0,Nice quality and color! Holding up well - have worn 3 times! Looks expensive - fun earrings!!!
5.0,"As a negligee, this is lovely. It fits well, is alluring and very soft and silky, and it is easy to put on and take off. As a slip, it moves around a bit too much and the lines on the bust end up showing through your clothing. So, I don't recommend this as a slip, for underneath your clothing, which is one of the stated purposes of the garment, but I do recommend this as lingerie. It is beautiful, it feels wonderful, it is attractive, and it works for that purpose, so I'm giving it five stars. As to use as a nightgown, it won't keep you warm and it will move around a little more than you might want it to, so, again, it's a lovely negligee, and that is likely to be its best use."
5.0,America's Team fans need this hat in their collection.  I have several and will buy more for the fit and easy care. Enough said.
5.0,"Nice bold colors, didn’t fade or shrink after washing"
5.0,So many compliments from complete strangers!
5.0,Whenever I’m wearing any of these colored glasses I get tons of inquiries and compliments about the them!
5.0,This product is awesome for all reasons.  This is about the 8th pair and they stand up to wear very well.
5.0,Bought two in different colors. I am constantly misplacing my glasses so I always carry a spare with me. The case is adorable and I love that it comes with a small screwdriver and a glasses cloth.
5.0,"These tights were exactly as described and what I expected.  They were a perfect fit for 70 lb, 5ft ballerina.  The waist does come up higher (comes well above navel) than she prefers but not out of the ordinary.  They seem to be sturdy and of good quality.  They have been worn once so I will re-post if we have any issues with runs before we should."
5.0,Loved this one the best! ( I also got a black and red bucket hat.) I will order again from this seller.
5.0,I love this. It's nice and big but not overwhelming too big. Just enough to wear either hanging or short.
5.0,"High quality and appears to be durable (spring mechanism is tight, but we'll see how it holds up over time).  Love the rubberized part of the key chain.  Just the right size, not to bulky or diminutive.  Excellent purchase for the money."
5.0,"So these didn’t look like much when I got them and they even seemed flimsy. But I was impressed! If I looked down too far (I wore these at work! I’m a waitress) they fell off, but that only happened a few times. They were comfortable and durable. I got lots of compliments. The batteries for the lights is still going. Happy Halloween! Thank you!"
5.0,This bracelet is absolutely perfect on my wrist.
5.0,I wasn't sure about the material. .but when I got my package. .the material was so soft .I wear a medium. .but take a large. ..I like room in my dress.shipping was on time. ....I like my dress
5.0,I got so many compliments on this jacket! highly recommended!
5.0,"What a great name for a rock band, eh? These inexpensive, over-eyeglass sunglasses work great. Not TOO dorky looking, but hey, we already wear eyeglasses : ) Fits well for a big-headed guy like myself. Flip-up feature is nice in many different ways. Don't fret it, just get it, you won't regret it!"
5.0,"Cheap, great quality, thick long compression socks."
5.0,"great fit, will look great on my wife on the safari ,cant wait , now where shall we go ? She will be French and I''ll be British."
5.0,mr. rogers eat your heart out
5.0,I love these boots. They fit just as expected and they’re comfortable and warm. My husband even complimented me on the look of them.
5.0,I have finally found the most comfy bra!  Thank You
5.0,"Great color, nice ribbed and soft material. Fair price."
5.0,looks amazing on my husband
5.0,"This shirt fits me perfectly! Possibly one of my new favorite shirts. I'm 5'4, 125 pounds, and have an athletic build and got the small. Not too tight but not too lose and is longer than expected which I love. Comfortable and perfect!"
5.0,"Works great! Fits watch perfectly.  Love this band, so much more comfortable than the rubber bands you can buy. These hold up great and comfortable."
5.0,I love this shirt but it is very sheer
5.0,I wore my Burberry purse and shoes so this was a cute addition to my outfit!
5.0,"My son wears this under his volleyball jersey, and he likes it.  It seems decent quality and fits well.  He's very happy with it."
5.0,Very nice super sexy! Can’t wear with panties that’s a plus lol
5.0,"I love these pants. They are perfect. They looked like they would be too small however, unlike most workout spandexy pants they stretch a lot. They end about 8 inches above my ankle which is exactly what I wanted!"
5.0,These are my daughters favorite pjs
5.0,"These earrings are absolutely stunning!  They are well made and of good quality.  The backs fit onto the posts great, so I don't have to worry about them coming out of my ears.  I am pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I received this product at a promotional discount for testing and reviewing purposes.  My opinions expressed here are my own honest, unbiased viewpoints."
5.0,fits great and look great on!!!!!!!!
5.0,"If you are a fan of the Vulcans of Star Trek, and have pierced ears, this is one of the most perfect ways to symbolize your belief in universal acceptance of all aspects of sentience."
5.0,My go to sunglasses.  Just love them.
5.0,"I'm 5' 2'' and an athletic 100 pounds, and ordered a small - it fit me perfectly.  But, I may be the only person out of all who reviewed it here who had a problem with the zipper, which I'll have to get replaced.  I also had the strap adjusted, as it was much too long, and had a hook added above the zipper.  Kind of a bummer that I've had to have so much work done on it, but thankfully I have a great alteration place that can do quick quality work, since I'm a violinist and need this for a show I'm playing this coming weekend.<br /><br />If you buy this corset, just be prepared to have modifications done; apparently I'm the only one who got a bad zipper, so don't let my unique problem deter you.  The zipper is heavy duty - metal, and not plastic - and there appears to be nothing wrong with it, but obviously that's not the case, since it keeps breaking on me.  Especially if you have an hourglass figure, it looks fantastic, and is very comfortable to wear.  Especially for the price, I say, go for it."
5.0,"My wife absolutely loved this.  The picture didn't really do it justice, it's a really cute piece of jewelry."
5.0,"I can't say enough good things about the quality of the graphics on this!  I wish you had t-shirts and hoodies with this!  It's also a perfect size for just an out on the town, over shoulder bag!  Great value and great quality!"
5.0,Works well for my active daughter
5.0,The material is so soft and comfy. It washes and dries very well and material doesn’t bead up. High quality and very cute on.<br /><br />I ordered the Sage and black. Sage has arrived and color is as shown. I wish they also made a maxi skirt with a hidden waist band to go with it.
5.0,My friend loved this necklace.
5.0,I rescue hedgehogs and this is well made and looks as it should  and I thank the person who designed this key fob!
5.0,Didn’t have a better picture.  The wings were perfect with the dress I made
5.0,Slippers fit as expected and daughter loved the style. They are easy to get on and off and are nice and cozy.
5.0,handy!
5.0,Shoes are adorable!  Easy to slide on and off.
5.0,Nice. Arrived on time.
5.0,Fits perfect. Love it❤️❤️
5.0,"Great bag, use it every day for work."
5.0,I liked the glasses. Exactly what I ordered.
5.0,Many compliments when I wear this necklace.
5.0,SON LOVED THEM AND QUALITY IS GOOD
5.0,"I bought these tights in size Small in two colors: black and chocolate. They fit me perfectly and comfortably. I am 5'2 and 112 lbs. My stats are 34-28-34. As capris they are pretty long on my short frame but I bought these for precisely that reason. I needed tights that would land on my calves instead of just below my knees. Most full-length leggings and tights in regular women's sizes are at least a foot too long.<br /><br />I don't wear these for working out; they're part of my work wardrobe. I've worn them with button-down shirts, crew neck T-shirts, tunic blouses, etc. Everything has paired well with these tights. No sign of VPL either. The material is neither too thin nor too thick.  I am so glad I found these capris!"
5.0,These watches are cheap but are a true classic.  Will last you forever if you take care of it.<br /><br />Love this color variant.  I swapped out the rubber strap for a nato and it’s even more amazing.
5.0,"It Israel perfect! The size, the color! I lo e it!"
5.0,"I love these, the material is super soft and they don't show through."
5.0,Fit wonderful runny small
5.0,"I love these! They work well, easy to use, and hold tight."
5.0,I'll look forward to wearing this during summer months and is an excellent post-surgery option for staying stylish through recovery.
5.0,Np
5.0,"it shipped fast, my wife loved it"
5.0,"Super cute design, got what I ordered and it even came with a small plastic bad to put them in! Would definitely recommend!"
5.0,"When I received this shirt, I thought that it was going to be way too big and the sleeves way too small.  When I put it on, I was wrong! It fit great! The sleeves were perfect full length and the shirt was long enough to wear with leggings.  It did fit a little large the first time I wore it, but after washing and drying, it will shrink a little bit, so I'm not too concerned about that.  I love Allegra K products.  Every shirt that I've bought in an XL fits me well and flatters my body type.  I am 5'7&#34; and a size 18 in pants, XL in tops."
5.0,Nicely made came in the mail on her birthday which was great thanks a lot
5.0,Short is great but takes a very long time to come
5.0,I just got these shoes on a whim and happy I found these. Note: I was attracted to them on Prime Day ;-) Good vale.
5.0,Fits really well. Looks nice!
5.0,"Great looking shades.  Not polarized but... they were 7 bucks... The two toned look is a nice touch.  These exceeded my expectations, would buy again."
5.0,I love this watch. It’s made for small teeny tiny wrists and it actually fits me. The resin band is a little tough at first but once you get it more malleable it’s pretty awesome.
5.0,Beautiful dress!! My girls received lots of compliments in them.
5.0,Bought these for my niece....they were perfect not too big or tight on her head. Beautiful colors!!
5.0,It can be adjusted.
5.0,"I was very impressed with this purchase. I didn’t know what to expect but I got a very great, sewn and well made jersey."
5.0,I first bought these sneakers at Kohl's and they were the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn in my life. So I bought my parents and my niece a pair. Be careful not to get knock-off ones because those aren't as comfortable. I hope Under Armour continues to make these just as comfortable and continue to sell them. Thank you Under Armour you guys rock!
5.0,"My girlfriend loves these earrings, wears it as much as she can . Got it as a mother's Day gift ."
5.0,"These are cute and comes as is. Gems DO NOT fall out, they are covered/coated with some sort of plastic or silicone (not sure) but they definitely will not come out. The bottom ball is a bit smaller than normal tongue ring balls."
5.0,"Pins are exactly as described...good quality, nice look.  Arrived within 2 days. We love sharing them with our patriotic friends."
5.0,I was attending a summer wedding could not find a dress to wear! The date kept creeping closer and closer and my schedule kept filling up until I had NO time to go shopping and my only option was Amazon Prime. This dress arrived the night before the wedding and was truly a Hail Mary! It fit exactly as expected and I got so many compliments! The material is great and it's super flattering. People can't believe this dress is from Amazon and costs like $20. Definitely recommend!
5.0,"Love this necklace! I get compliments on it all the time! Great necklace, great price! Could give this as a gift."
5.0,"I use ethika male products and bought these for a friend! she loved them and i will be copying these reviews over to another ethika product. See main points for this and most their products and the final point for the review on this product, ""Ethika Shorty""<br /><br />Size Fit:<br />Their sizes are the same all across their products because there is no change (in my experience) of size difference between their product lines. If you are medium in one of their products, you will be a medium for almost everything else. Example: would be a Medium Sports bra will always be Medium size for all their sports bra. But you might be a Small in another of their product because sports bra are the only ones that are a bit tighter than the rest. There are a couple of differences but not so much.<br /><br />Material Quality:<br />There material, from what my friend told me, is that they feel WAY better than Victoria Secret's products. They are softer and there designs are softer/smoother and have their sew lines placed in location that wont irritate you. The materials they use are also non irritating for almost all their products. Guys/Girls they are both soft and great quality.<br /><br />Price:<br />meh, on amazon, you can find great deals and even on Ebay or their direct website! but you get exactly what you pay for! good quality for sure! no shortcuts on manufacturing and producing these.<br /><br />Specific review on these:<br />They are great! sold material and the design is dope! Of course the print is rougher since its a print but the material it sits on is very soft! The ""shorty"" fits a bit tighter than other products depending on your waist and butt size but still, you will not have any issues with their fit. They will feel comfortable and breathable!"
5.0,Nice case. I use this case for my markers. Fits about 25 markers depending on the thickness of the markers.
5.0,I love this purse. Very durable and cute. Smaller than expected but I'm very pleased with it
5.0,Great value and as described
5.0,"Get these hooded workout shirts! They're nice, great quality I've bought most of the clothes and sets these brand has to offer and put my wife on it. Go ahead and expand your workout wardrobe with these and check out the other Neleus products while you're at it. I've tried a few different online based workout clothes brands and they're my favorite."
5.0,My husband loves this hat.  He did say it was somewhat slippery on his head but he likes it and its working out well for him.  I would recommend.
5.0,Awesome product! We loved them!
5.0,"Have ordered off this seller multiple times and they never disappoint. Dress was beautiful and fit true to size. I'm 5'5, 140lbs, 34b and carry a lot of baby weight in my stomach so this dress was perfect for hiding my belly fat. Length was perfect and the color(purple) wasn't as vibrant as pictured but that's to be expected. I ordered the size 4-6 even though I wear 6-8 just because I'm small chested and this isn't a fitted dress so it worked out for me. I think I would've been more satisfied if I had ordered the royal blue or red though. Still keeping it though."
5.0,"Exactly as described.  During winter months I wear a hospital grade face mask to avoid breathing in germs and bacteria from the public (coughing, sneezing, etc).  This is a GREAT alternative to those masks!  Several people have already asked me where I got it. I emphatically state AMAZON. Also tell them there are many patterns to choose from.<br /><br />Suggested to a Harley guy too."
5.0,Purchased for my fire dancing costume and absolutely love it!!!
5.0,Cute. Sits just right on the ear.
5.0,super cute probably one of the best gifts i have ever bought
5.0,"Love this suit and I will be ordering another one. I hesitated to buy anything online because I was so worried about the fit. I have tried on soooo many in stores and wasn't happy with the fit or support. I'm glad I took a chance. I am 5'2&#34;, 170 lbs and a 38 DDD. I ordered a 12. The bottoms fit fine, but the top is a touch small. It will work and I'll just order a size bigger next time. I'm  a mom of a 1 year old and 3 year old. Great support with lots of cleavage so I still feel sexy, but covers my tummy."
5.0,The engraving was nice.
5.0,I love this!!! Perfect fit for glasses
5.0,"These are definitely the best no-show socks around.  If you are looking for no-show socks for ballet flats or fashion sneakers, GET THESE!!"
5.0,It’s beautiful! It take a while to get here but was worth the wait .  Love love love it .
5.0,Got it for my Granddaughter who taps.
5.0,"cardigan is so good and fabric is so soft and so good not the cheap soft<br />i loved it and will order more.but the size chart is by the number it should tell by the S,M,L,XL OR MORE"
5.0,Quality built. Perfect size.
5.0,Comfortable and having a small wrist being able to adjust a stretchable band is a big plus.
5.0,so far all good
5.0,"I got mine about 2 weeks ago, and I absolutely love them. The shields and the regular bars fit comfortably and they don’t have any discoloring."
5.0,Beautiful as always
5.0,"I’m 5’11 and wear an 8/10. I bought the large and it fits nicely. You could probably be a size 12 and go with the large. This dress hits me right above the knee, which is great for being tall, especially since the skirt is full. The belt needs one more notch put in it for my size but that will be easy to do. For the price, this dress is adorable and a very good quality; nice fabric and the top is lined. I’ll probably wear it with a strapless bra but you could go without. I’d buy other dresses from this seller."
5.0,"love this bag, comfortable to wear while biking"
5.0,"Love it ! It's so cute , went perfectly with my outfit ❤️ Material is pretty thick, it's great !"
5.0,"It fits perfectly, colors are outstanding."
5.0,"Make sure ya got long nipples.. if you're even slightly wondering whether or not they will go around yours, they will not."
5.0,I love this very comfortable and cool. I love it so much
5.0,This case appears to be well made and attractive.  Looks like it will hold up over time.
5.0,So comfortable and fit well
5.0,Beautiful I love the moon stone
5.0,"Love these tops! I bought this and the Bubblelime Yoga pants and they are exactly what I've been looking for!<br />I bought about 5 of these tops. These and the straight leg yoga pants are my favorite! Seriously, BUY THEM! 😊"
5.0,Nice new
5.0,"This headband fits perfectly, covers my ears, and keeps my hair out of my way.  I've never had a headband before that actually stayed in place as I exercised outdoors.  Love it."
5.0,great little dress! nice quality at a low price. love it!
5.0,"Anyone who loves Boggle will love this carabiner of Boggle-goodness. The timer is detachable, the letter die are shakeable--it makes taking your Boggle game on the road easy and fun. I rated the durability of the game a 3 only because the timer is detachable (for game play) and therefore could get lost."
5.0,I love it. Getting another color.
5.0,looks like the grips will last. cant wait to try them this winter. thanks
5.0,Love these stockings.. comfortable & great price!
5.0,I just got these last week and am blown away by how much sharper my vision is day or night. I cannot speak to how they will last but love them so far.
5.0,"So Beautiful!!!! Pics are genuine! So, so many compliments on these earrings! So pleased!  Delivered quickly, and exactly when they said they would! So happy with these!"
5.0,Nice shirt great for workouts
5.0,"This is a great suit. I'm 5'8&#34; and about 125#, typically a size xs to sm. I ordered size small and it fits well. I like that I feel secure moving around.  Also, the shade of blue complements my pale complexion."
5.0,Beautiful. Excellent quality. Only wish is that they were a bit lighter weight.
5.0,Delivered  on time.  Item fits perfectly
5.0,Super cute on! Good quality!!
5.0,Amazing and polarized. Can't beat the price. This is my second year buying these because I can't keep up with my sunglasses but I love these.
5.0,I wear this ring everyday and have fallen in love with it. I have rather large fingers and it truly is adjustable. The metal is just sturdy enough to hold shape but still allow user to adjust it. I was nervous about the fit but also wether or not it would cause discoloration in my finger (turning it green) but I have had no such issue!!There is also amazing detail work.
5.0,"Fits great, quick delivery."
5.0,After reading reviews I was expecting to get something very cheap and plastic looking. When they arrived and I opened the box I was so impressed and it takes a lot to impress me with jewelry. The pearls have a nice weight to them as real peals should. They don’t look plastic or glassy. A nice ivory color which is what I wanted for my daughter wedding. So glad I purchased them! I must have been one of the blessed ones and ended up with a great set. Thank you and hope you continue to make more sets that are so affordable!
5.0,the recipient loved it and ordered more for her family.
5.0,I wore this to a Derby Party not long ago and I received a lot of compliments
5.0,"This package of Banaware High Fidelity Earplugs comes with two pairs of silicone earplugs (one larger, one smaller), a blue carrying case with a carabiner clip, and a set of instructions. The larger pair of earplugs has a noise-reduction filter in each earplug. If you need to switch to the smaller earplugs, the instructions tell you how to remove the filter from the larger set and reinsert it into the smaller set. The larger set fit fine for me so I didn't need to do any of that, but it's nice to know I have that option if I decide to let my wife borrow them. These earplugs work very well to reduce loud noise to a more comfortable level, and they are easy to wear all day without any discomfort. They are also extremely easy to clean. I love the carrying case, and can clip it to my backpack when I'm traveling, and to my belt loop when I'm otherwise out and about. I like the fact that these earplugs do not block all noise, but instead just bring it down a notch. I still want to be able to hear and react in case of emergencies, and even to respond to something as basic as my phone or doorbell ringing. These allow me to do that. This set of Banaware earplugs is currently marked down to $15.29 from their former price of $20.99, and I consider this a good value. They also make a nice gift for anyone who works, lives, or plays in a noisy environment."
5.0,"This was a gift for my boss, she loved it!"
5.0,Got this for my only daughter (10 yo) of 4 kids so she could go from the shower to her bedroom in style and comfort. She loves it! Children that develop feelings of comfort and abundance will more likely lead lives that provide them the success to live that way as an adult. This is as much an investment in her future as is a college education as a teenager.
5.0,My daughter loves them. Easy to walk in.
5.0,"I love this belt! It's comfortable (not too restrictive) and gets the job done. I like that even though it's an elastic belt, it doesn't look cheap. They aren't kidding when they describe it as flat. It's the most unobtrusive belt I own. I'm thinking about getting it in another color, I like this one so much."
5.0,This tie is perfect. Well made and to my surprise it almost looks 3D. Love it. Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Great workout leggings. Strong compression and slimming!
5.0,Very good pin
5.0,"The socks are a good expression for old folks like me--I'm not dead, and I'm not boring. Yet. The socks are also comfortable, with a little squish to go with the artistic component."
5.0,"love love this dress! super comfy, and perfect for my bachelorette party! fun and loose! I'm 5'1, and I got a small!"
5.0,Very warm have used a few times and kept my face very warm

5.0,Very cute and fancy match perfectly with any dress
5.0,This is very nice and I like it more than I thought I would.
5.0,For the price! Good quality and style!
5.0,My daughter loved each  and every one. Great value!!
5.0,Great shipping speed even during the holiday's. Order was placed Friday night and delivered Sunday by USPS.<br />The gloves.<br /><br />The Good<br />Ultra soft and Great fitting. Was purchased for a friend they fit better than any gloves they own. It actually made them say &#34;it fits like a glove&#34; lol.<br />Excellent Gloves for driving. These gloves are also very warm can easily be worn in windy 30 degrees temperatures. When using a touchscreen it reacts and feels just like you were actually using your hand but...<br /><br />The Bad<br />The gloves are a little too sticky. They stick to each other your phone screen and everything else you touch. It's kinda like a lightly sticky movie theater floor. Also because the leather is so soft they should be worn with extreme care. No touching anything sharp or abrasive otherwise you risk tearing or damaging the gloves. I'm hoping that either one of these issues resolve themselves with usage or oiling.
5.0,These arm sleeves are good. They keep me cool & also protects my arms from the chemical that I use at work.
5.0,"Loved the material, just too snug around the stomach area"
5.0,"Nice earrings, a little bigger than expected but happy with them!"
5.0,"Love these, have purchased several pairs. Since I wear them a lot, I've had to repair some small holes but that's not a problem."
5.0,Material is nice .
5.0,"Perfect material as I wanted a thin jacket, but find so small especially if you have boobs.  I had to return"
5.0,they are the most comfortable shoe I've had for along time.

5.0,This bracelet is very pretty. I love it!!!!!!
5.0,Perfect fit for my grandsons birthday.
5.0,These are a very comfy fit. They fit as expected and even after washing and drying they kept the size. These jeans have nice deep pockets front and back.

5.0,My son loves these!! He said they fit as they should and are very comfortable!
5.0,I love these socks they are not thick or tight.

5.0,The sun doesn't stand a chance in these.
5.0,"Nice stylish case, quality made."
5.0,Beautiful. Very sparkly. Clasp was fine for me.

5.0,Ear Nunchucks. Great edc for the wife

5.0,Loved the shirt. Very high quality. Did buy one size larger because it's  100% cotton.
5.0,"Comfortable, lightweight, affordable summer pieces.  Plan to buy more in different colors."
5.0,I love it. Very comfortable and fits great. I bought a large incase it was too small but I'm sure if I got a medium it would have fit perfect. I'm still good with it though. So soft I would purchase again.
5.0,Perfect fit such a cute leotard! Can’t wait to buy other colors!
5.0,"I lost them since purchasing them, but they were high quality and made everything seem brighter and more lovely :-)"
5.0,Beautiful. Arrived as described
5.0,"We bought these so that our daughter could use them on a winter canoe/ camping trip. We have only used them once, but they were comfortable and warm. They are a little thin, so if you do a lot of canoeing, you might want to find some that are a little sturdier. But, for the occasional canoer, these were perfect."
5.0,I absoluty love this dress. It is so cute. The top is see through but I just worn a cami under the dress.
5.0,"The shoes are in brand new condition and look exactly as the picture. In my experience, Brooks has always been true to size. Package was shipped quickly. Good experience!"
5.0,Como se ve en la foto
5.0,I’m 5’6” and 145 lbs. the small fits me barely. I think a medium would have been more flattering
5.0,"Really  nice quality wallet. Barely bigger than the tiny card holder I had before and yet this holds 8 cards, currency, and coins!"
5.0,"Not only are they gr8 for standing for a long time, feel gr8 and pretty too."
5.0,"Wore this dress to a business meeting last night and I received SO many compliments!  I love this dress. It's beautiful, fits well and the fabric feels sturdy. I'm very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this dress. I want to order more. I ordered a size small. I’m 5,5” 130 pounds. It fit as expected. Not too long! Perfect length for flip flops. I really love the material too. I don’t think you’ll ever have to iron it. Love love love this dress!"
5.0,Cute and exactly as described
5.0,"These pajamas are great. Saw them and thought they'd be perfect for my daughter. Upon delivery, low and behold they're perfect. Tossed them in the wash and my daughter couldn't wait to get ready for bed! Which is always dope. She absolutely loves them. And they fit her perfectly. She's cute as a button in them. An absolutely great purchase at a great price. I would happily purchase other pajamas of different designs from this seller. Very happy with them. I was happy to see the range of sizes available at the time of ordering. Highly recommended. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
5.0,"I needed a new modest suit for swimming laps. I've been told I'm very boring with all my swimsuits being solid black or navy blue. This suit is colorful. There is no cleavage hanging out and the suit has a high back, both a rare find. I am a 36 D, 5'4,"" 155 lbs and this suit is a touch tight to pull on, but a perfect fit. I bought a size Large."
5.0,Just bought these in 3 colors and LOVE them. They look exactly like the pictures show. So happy!
5.0,Gave it as a present. Loved it! Great leather feel and nice look without the animal cruelty. Great size Fits everything. Will continue to support this collection.
5.0,"Bought this for my wife, and holy crap, she looks smokin in it!!  Thanks"
5.0,El color negro es espectacular
5.0,"Nice quality, trendy & great price!"
5.0,Love them! No more foot pain!
5.0,"I'm 5'4 and about 135 with 34d and the small fit perfect. I had a baby six weeks ago and the material is stretchy enough that I could still nurse in this but its tight enough to look right and fit well. The material is so soft and stretchy. The length is perfect mid thigh, long enough that I dont have to worry about a gust of wind blowing the hem up.  It's been in the mid 90s and humid and this breathes really well. I'll definitely buy in other patterns."
5.0,I love these they also come in orange wore them all summer just a cute additive to a daily run around outfit. However they did wear down fast (as to the bottoms very light weight) and stretch a little but still would buy them again in a heartbeat
5.0,Bought this for a gift and he absolutely loved it.  Just as pictured and the quality was very nice.  Now he wants another one.
5.0,"Love the cool comfort,  especially since it's hot where I work at"
5.0,These were much thinner than I expected but still cute. Not for very cold weather.
5.0,Perfect and extremely comfortable.  Highly recommend.
5.0,VERY dark lenses...but were a great addition to our bachelorette party!
5.0,EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED!!!
5.0,"Beautiful watch, appears to be high quality materials and well made. Time will tell if it’s quality lives up to its looks."
5.0,Well made. Dad wears it everywhere.
5.0,"Works perfectly. Holds it securely. No worries about it falling out. Only wish the chain was a little longer. It is an easy fix, so it is not a big deal."
5.0,Purchased for my girlfriend to wear over a bathing suit at the resort.
5.0,Pretty and lightweight earrings. Perfect size...not too big not too small. Multiple colors that go great with any outfit.
5.0,Love this dress. Super comfortable and flattering. Wore all day at a wedding. Casual enough to wear to work but looks great dressed up.  Planning on buying in black. The purple is a burgundy/wine color.
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and fit of these pants. I normally wear a size 6 in pants so I ordered a size small. The material is nice and sturdy/ thick. Since the pants are fitted, I recommend wearing a long sweater or tunic with them. At first I was concerned the color (orchid) was too tacky/bright for the office , but it got me out of my rut of always wearing gray, tan, and black. I wore them with a tan sweater to tone things down a bit! I plan to buy more in other colors to wear to work."
5.0,Felt so sexy in this dress
5.0,love this bracelet...bought for my mom who is petite framed and it is one of the only bracelets that actually fits her well.
5.0,Love this hat.  No sunburn while fishing. So perfect
5.0,"Needed a durable sneaker for my active 2 year old and this shoe fit the bill. Comfortable, stylish and doesn't have cartoon characters all over it like so many children's sneakers."
5.0,Awesome little tool. Worth the price.
5.0,"I really like this black leather bracelet.  It looks exactly as pictured.  It came tastefully packaged with the bracelet in a sealed sterile bag with the sterile bag then inside a sealed ziplock bag that also contained the tasteful black faux velvet storage case.  The stainless steel clasp is different than other bracelets I have owned.  This clasp is easy to use both for putting the bracelet on AND for taking it off.  And even better, it will not come lose and fall off like the goofy magnet clasps so often do.  The stainless steel itself is shiny and clean.  The leather is high-quality and has a supple feel.  The design is simple, but it looks manly and elegant.  I would recommend measuring as I ordered mine a bit too large.  It's still fine though as it feels good on my wrist and does not chafe.  I received a discount for a fair and unbalanced review of this bracelet, but I assure you that it is great.  I will be wearing this all the time."
5.0,"Shopped local 1st and found only ugly, high priced shirts. Went to Amazon and in a few moments found exactly what I was looking for in this Lands End plaid flannel shirt. Received in 2 days as stated, pkg in great condition. Removed shirt, tried it on, it was a perfect fit. Put it the washer then the drier and put it on again with no ironing. Still perfect fit and it is the softest, most comfortable flannel shirt I've ever worn! Nice weight to the material, should make it last for years. It looked better in my hands than it did in the Amazon photo. Yes, I love this shirt and I do highly recommend it."
5.0,These wouldn't fit my wife
5.0,"This looks so great in person. I bought it as a gift, and everyone loved it. It's a good size - about the width of my palm. The quality is great, and the colors are stunning in the light. When the light hits it, you can see many colors in the glaze. The ribbon necklace is very nice, too, and is a good length. It's not too short and not too long."
5.0,I was happy to find a replacement for the broken band and I hope these are more durable than the original.  I do wish they came in other colors.
5.0,Perfect size to fit my inogen oxygen in and other things
5.0,Trunks look just like the picture and were true to size. The colors were bright and vibrant. Great purchase with an awesome cost!
5.0,Just as pretty as I expected.
5.0,i just wanted something to block the sun while i was floating at the lake. this works for me because i have long hair and hats don't fit well over a big top bun.
5.0,Bought these for a wedding shower because 40+ wine charms was too expensive. Everyone had so much fun with them. Worked great. No complaints.
5.0,Great Product Best Price
5.0,"Beautiful ring! Nicely crafted, not heavy, unfortunately about a half size too big for me personally. But I'll make it work I like it that much!"
5.0,it is a little thinner than I thought but very warm. wished it had strings on hood to tighten on windy days but very warm to walk dog in winter. I also had to tie the waist strings myself bc there is no clip to tighten that show a waist. I do recommend. oh yes the pockets are hidden on side of pocket fold down and hard to get hands into. the fold down pocket look is nice but not an upright pocket. I wished it had better pockets and maybe inside pocket or zippers for phone or keys.
5.0,"Great Top Grain Leather Reversible Belt !<br />Amazing product, looks great, fits great, great quality, and great price. All around, I’m very pleased with this belt. It looks much more expensive than it is, which is a plus. It's held up well, which is another huge plus, especially since I wear it multiple days a week. And i can dress it for the brown side on the weekends with just a easy twist of the buckle. Highly recommend this Savile Row Company belt."
5.0,These have a grippy sheath which helps keep them tied
5.0,I love this dress. I purchased it to wear to my cousin's funeral. Family members are asked to wear gray. Can't wait to wear it. I tried it on and it looks gorgeous.
5.0,I love how thin they are. I work in a factory and its so much easier to breathe with these. The ear holes are great at preventing the mask from sliding down your heaf
5.0,"This product is medium sized but discrete (I'm 5'5&#34; and the bag sits just above my hip and just below my breast if that helps paint the products size). It is very light weight and has 2 pockets. The large pocket is about 5 inches deep and 5 inches across. The small pocket has an angle to it, but is about 2.5 inches deep (slightly higher on one side) and 5 inches across."
5.0,I love this bag so much. Being Kate Spade it is excellent quality. I have gotten alot of complements.
5.0,Fits and feel great 👍🏾... Will recommend...
5.0,Fits perfect exactly what I expected a little small on the face though but that's fine totally not just for Halloween my kids plan on wearing this for Comic-Con and just for play as well
5.0,I love belts
5.0,I did like this item. But it was very thin almost like a longsleeved shirt. However I was completely fine with that.
5.0,For the price it’s really a comfort fit.

5.0,my daughter was happy to get this.  it arrived on time.
5.0,This fit perfectly!  I love it!
5.0,I bought this band for my Mom’s Fossil smart watch. It dressed the watch up beautifully. She loves it every time she puts it on she shows it to me and tells me how much she loves it. She is 90 years old… Thank you for such a beautiful band.
5.0,"Love love love!! This dress is high quality, it’s muti-layered, it’s beaded very nicely and I thought it fit as expected! I’m 5’4” and 120lbs and I ordered a medium. I’m excited to wear this to a wedding or other formal event! If it becomes available again in other colors I’m going to buy it again!"
5.0,"I wear a lot of sweaters, cardigans, and blazers and this is just the thing to keep them from flying open. It's well made and adds a pop of color. I get compliments every time I wear it."
5.0,"Absolutely love these! My daughter kicks her boots off that take forever to put on, so these looked like a great substitute. These stay on and are so easy to put on. I ordered 6-12months for my 3 month old (shes huge) and they fit perfect with a little extra room. Super cute, even ordered more in different colors!"

5.0,"These stylish , well made ( very nice quality fabric) pajamas  were not a disappointment. On the contrary...it came as somewhat of a surprise to see this level of good quality. I'm very pleased with the style, the fit, the softness, yet durability of the fabric, and of course the delivery was great too. Got a wee tired of my &#34; leopard print &#34; flannels...ha....kinda' fun to go to a little more girlie/ traditional. Thanks!"
5.0,"Purchased for a friend who is a turtle lover, she really liked the bracelet."
5.0,All colors all shapes..I love them
5.0,"I love these hats. My dad has always had a fondness for hats that will keep his head warm without looking like he is always wearing winter clothes and this hat is perfect. After finding it and buying one for him early last year, he won't wear anything else. So here I am after buying his 3rd one. This hat (the black one) is a soft yet sturdy material, it doesn't pick up pet hair easily (which is important since we have a fluffy white dog and his hair ends up everywhere), and it keeps my dad's head feeling warm without being too heavy for year around wear. It's also stylish, adjusts easily for a perfect fit, and after a year of daily use, his first one still looks brand new. I look forward to my dad getting many years of use out of these great hats and am betting that it won't be long before I'll be buying another one to add to his collection. :)"
5.0,Fantastic product! Couldn't be happier with this helm!
5.0,Fits really.nicw. my daughter in law really likes it

5.0,"This band turned out to be really cute. I like that there’s a cover with it, makes the whole thing look even better. Love it!"
5.0,SO dang cute! I ordered mine a tad big on purpose so it was loose and comfy. I get compliments every time I wear this shirt.

5.0,Love the material & the flattering flow. I get a lot of compliments when I'm wearing this.
5.0,"Good for workout, absorbs sweat perfectly"
5.0,I purchased this to use on an overseas vacation for its RFID blocking feature.  I liked it so much I continue to use it for every day use.  The compartments are just what I need and it looks brand new even a year later.  I does look a bit plastic but I accept that drawback for its safety feature.
5.0,"Wow!  This brush really works.<br /><br />Yesterday I got the brush.  My son had bought a white, 4X hat as a second but it was such a good deal he couldn't pass it up..  The deal was because it had lint all over and a smudge on the hat.<br /><br />I got him this brush so he could try to restore the hat to near mint condition.  Didn't know if it would work.<br /><br />It sure did!  Within 15 seconds, the brush had removed the smudge and greatly reduced the lint on the hat.  I don't know how it worked, but it appeared to remove some of the talc/white powder from the hat and lifted the stain right off.<br /><br />I am buying a dark one for my cowboy hats and getting some powder cleaners to go with it.  This product took a $25 hat and made it stand out.  My son loves it."
5.0,"First off, these are not just for boys. My 9year old daughter really likes these. They fit her well, are comfortable and match Broncos colors!<br />They’ve held up very well in the washer and dryer. She frequently reaches for these as pajama pants. We’ve been really happy with the A is for Awesome brand items we own."
5.0,Definitely great earrings for the price!  So far I’ve only worn the black ones & have already received a handful of compliments!
5.0,Easy to clean and very comfortable
5.0,"I love these. I bought them eleven months ago and have worn them every since. I get headaches so I want earrings that are small and I can live in. They're a little hard to get off, but that's not a problem for me since I don't take them off. I was worried after reading some reviews that they might not last long but this is not the case. Even if they break tonight, they will have been worth what I paid for them because I've had them and loved them for so long. Still just as bright and pretty."
5.0,"Lovely. I like the way it lies. Definitely a real Michael Kors product! Delivered at lightning speed, so, thank you to the seller."
5.0,This bracelet is beautiful! I got it for my friend who's husband died. It is well made and the company did a fantastic job setting the picture perfectly.<br />The first one they sent me had the birthstones mixed up. I emailed them and received a quick response. They readily agreed to make it right at no cost. FANTASTIC  customer service. I will definitely use this company in the future for personalized gifts. A+++
5.0,"Was a gift, receiver logs it."
5.0,"Absolutely love these, I have another set of cubes but I purchased these and was able to use them as shoe bags"
5.0,"My trainer told me about this brand, I was nervous about the fit when I took them out of the package, they seemed tiny! I tried them on and they fit amazing- good length, I’m 5’10” and purchased the XL. The fabric is very soft and even after my workout there were no sweat marks on my tush, like when I wear a cotton-y blend. Very comfortable waist band, hits just above the belly button- keeping in my problem areas. Will be buying additional pairs- the quality for the price is greater than other more expensive pants I’ve bought. Definitely a must buy!"
5.0,"perfect size holds all my cards, money and phone"
5.0,Super cute! Made a great gift for husband!
5.0,my daughter in law received this along with another charm for christmas. she absolutely loves it and will help her have a good memory of this christmas in particular.
5.0,"These fit just as expected, and are even warmer than expected.  The non-gathered leg makes them look like casual knit pants rather than sloppy sweats.  They are so great, I may buy more!"
5.0,Fits great and works awesome
5.0,I love this product....MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT ALSO ITS HER VERY WELL.
5.0,"The sweater got very fast. The supplier AMAZING GRACE LLC sent it the next day after the order. It's a little big on me, but I will not return it. The sweater is very soft and pleasant. My size is XL. I bought a sweater size XL."

5.0,My sister will love it!
5.0,I received a lot of compliments at work on this dress. Fit perfectly and very comfortable.
5.0,"Fit well, ordered a size up as I was 2 weeks postpartum and it fit well. Ordered this dress for easy nursing of my baby and worked well even tho the dress has no stretch to it, it was easy to slip down a strap."
5.0,"48 pairs for $35 can’t beat the price. Definitely an excessive amount of socks. However, I can’t murder or hired assassin to take out the troll. They keep stealing socks I digress. I gave some to my sister who also like them. My daughter doesn’t really complain. I like them."
5.0,Es un producto bello. con muy buen acabado y con una calidad insuperable
5.0,My boyfriend bought this Santa suit for a local event we have every year!  It fit great and the material was very nice.  Great suit for the price!
5.0,I only wish the necklace was a bit longer other then that i really like it compliments outfits well amd feels nice and smooth to the touch

5.0,Very pretty snowflake. It really needs to be on a longer chain so I changed mine out for a 20 inch chain and it looks much better. The pendant itself is very pretty and the stones look clear and sparkly.
5.0,"For a halloween thing, it was a nice hat. Cheap but worth it. Fit as expected which is nice cause I have a large head."
5.0,"Love the color, the comfyness. Would buy another."
5.0,Bought 4 of these as gifts during the holidays. No idea how they’ll hold up. Appear to be good quality and all the girls liked that they received different colors. Colors are true to what you see. I think my favorite is the grey and red. They like the inside pocket as well.
5.0,"Good quality, enjoy!"
5.0,"Good stitching, good amount of spots for anything you may carry in your wallet. It's a little bit thicker than I was hoping, not great if you have a bad back like me. But, overall it's a 5 star item."
5.0,Got this for our twin babies for an anime convention in Milwaukee. So many people loved it! Only thing is the hat looked off and not like Totoro at all. So I stuffed them and tired thread to make it look better.
5.0,"Perfect dress! Was great for a wedding, got so many compliments! Good material and color."
5.0,Love it.. comfy material and fits really well!
5.0,Great pin! Perfect for wearing on a ball cap. Great quality and service!
5.0,Theses are adorable and super soft!  We love them!
5.0,"Birthday dress.  I am 5'5, 120 pounds.  I wore 3 to 4 inch heels.  I didn't think it was too long.  It could have been hemmed about 3 inches but I loved the fabric!"
5.0,I had 6 pairs from a previous purchase and wanted more.  They fit great and are priced very affordable.  These are NOT for bigger girls .....
5.0,Great for additional security for the Fitbit. Secures well without stretching.
5.0,Perfect! The color is true to picture.
5.0,"These run somewhat large but I just tie them up to make a cute workout look. Very open and flowy. Make sure to air dry, it says to not tumble dry."
5.0,My brother in law loved them
5.0,"So much nicer than I expected! I went up a size because I like a lot of room in the hips so i’ll take the waist in a little bit. Planning on buying more pairs in other colors. Fabric is light which is good for me in LA, as I plan to be able to wear them in the summer. Probably not great for cold climates."
5.0,"Connects, Feels and looks like the name brand but a much better price"
5.0,This is a first time in history that I really really love a bra. It fits so perfect! It feels like it was custom made just for me. 👌

5.0,Great statement piece for the price
5.0,I lose my glasses all the time and at this point getting two was perfect for me and my husband.  No worries about lost glasses now!
5.0,"It fit perfectly and the length is awesome (I'm 5' 10&#34;). I was worried it would be lower quality light fabric because of the price. It is not! It's heavy but not too heavy, perfect. I ordered it in black originally and then ordered the gray(which could also be called silver) also.I would love to see more colors in this."
5.0,Husband LOVES these pants. They were delivered a week ago and he hasn’t taken them off since buying them. Gross? Probably. Does it get the job done? HECK YES! He says they’re warmer than he thought they’d be given that they’re cropped. They’re stylish and comfortable. He loves the zippered pockets. Idk if you can tell but he has HUGE calves. Everyone comments on them. These were perfect for him. He wears a 28x28 and we ordered a small in these pants. Highly considering buying another pair.
5.0,So comfortable and amazing for! Even after pregnancy!
5.0,"This dress is so cute! I got tons of compliments on it. I’m 5’4 130 and ordered a small, It fit perfectly."
5.0,"Easy to use, I don’t recommend for lip or belly button but great for ears."
5.0,I got this for my 12 year old daughter I thought it was going to be to reviling but it fit her great she wears A 7/9 in teens and the medium fit her perfect and length was appropriate!
5.0,"We bought these due to the virus for an extra layer of protection, and they are exceptional. They do not fog up, fit well AND you get 2 pair as opposed to one. Have told neighbors about them when they asked since we also wore them to do yard work in the dusty desert! Great value and product!"
5.0,"No dislikes, Awesome"
5.0,"My girl loved it! We got it for her birthday party... We were expecting it to be not so good quality for the price. But we were surprised by how good quality it was when it came in. The only problem is now, she wants to wear it everywhere😄."
5.0,"This is a very nice thick, quality T-shirt! The lettering is vibrant, it is also true to size. I ordered a large, My actual size is medium but I didn’t want a close fit, the large fits me loose just as I wanted it to! Great buy, highly recommend this Tee!"
5.0,"I wore the blue pants with a big white blouse and strappy wedges and it was perfect for an outdoor brunch in hot weather. Loose but not sloppy. Washed them on cold, quick tumble in the dryer and they were perfect."
5.0,Love the material. Should if bought a smaller size. I’m losing weight. I love the pockets!!!
5.0,Soft and very comfortable. Good as a base layer but nice enough to wear by itself. Warm considering how thin it is.
5.0,Fun costumes. Fit great. Wish that cookie image was on backside too but it still worked out.
5.0,I love them and they are fashionable.
5.0,"The fabric is really beautiful. It has an almost natural cotton look and feel to it despite being 20% nylon. The knit is crisp and clean, and there are no defects. Fits well and will make a great addition to your fall wardrobe."
5.0,The horseshoe was a lovely addition to my pandora charm bracelet. Hope this helps.
5.0,"The jumpsuit fits great and it has pockets.  I got a large as I’m in between medium and large and I don’t have issue with getting in and out of it.  The legs stop mid calf and I’m 5’7”.  It has a string but it is ornamental and doesn’t make the waist tighten, only the elastic does."
5.0,"Great price, well made and arrive in small blue pouch. Perfect way to dress up & deliver key for new homeowners!"
5.0,"Seiko did it again. What a beautiful watch face with open back design.<br />The Crown is smooth for winding, the fit and finish of the watch is exellect.<br />The Dial is incredible.<br /><br />I have received many compliments, but my absolute favorite is when that glimmer of sunlight hits the watch at a 180 degree angle, Mamma Mia!!!<br /><br />Flawless."
5.0,Nice in every way
5.0,"this ring for this price is incredible! I got one for my fiance with engraving on the outside, it was done perfect! so happy with it!"
5.0,"I've been looking for this for years. Perfect with tank tops, tank dresses and no sleeve tops and dresses. Great fit I did go up a size to be sure."

5.0,Fits well and it's not too long. So excited to wear this to my next hiking.
5.0,So far I really like it
5.0,"Beautiful print, great fit, comfortable to wear! I saw another customer photo of this print and I thought it looked too good to be true. It's true! I wore this to the office and was comfortable all day. I was not sure if I'd need a cami underneath but I didn't wear one and it worked out fine!"
5.0,Gift was received on time and fast delivery!
5.0,Bought the watch after watching a youtube video about it. Very light and comfortable
5.0,I bought this for a gift.  It arrived very quickly.  I hope she likes it!
5.0,Exactly What I wanted!!
5.0,Very strong magnets. Attractive stones. I would order again.
5.0,"Love this dress! Very flowy and light. I’m 5’3” and a bit curvy and a M fit just right. If you’re tall and are looking for the maxi look you might not find this to be long enough, but for us shorties it’s perfect.<br /><br />If your mom ever did the 80’s thing where she “does your colors” and told you you were an “autumn,” the green will look stunning on you."
5.0,I wore the 35 Below Compression Socks under a pair of athletic socks and my feet were never cold.  They worked really well.  I also wore them alone and they worked well too.  Wore them with athletic shoes and with boots and had no problems with either.<br />The only problem I had was that one of the socks developed a little hole in it on top of the toe area.  Not sure what caused it.<br />Would definitely recommend these socks.<br />The seller contacted me directly and was extremely concerned about the issue.  A replacement  pair was issued and all I had to do was return the original pair at no cost.
5.0,"Super cute swimsuit, it is a little tight on me I probably should have gone up a size but may have been too big then. I am 5’1” and 130 lbs and ordered a small."
5.0,"Product was awesome, better than what my wife expected.  She loves it. I would recommend this product."
5.0,Everything I could have imagined for a pendant necklace.
5.0,"Great customer service! The backpack arrived fast and well packed. I bought brown one and it's very pretty. The color is vibriant which I love. The leather feel nice and has a nice shine to it. I also like that it has many pockets. The style is clean & simple, yet modern. I've got a lot of compliments from my friends."
5.0,"Sophisticated!  Gold accents (mustache, go-t, brows) well done.  Looked good on my male friend who mentioned the mask was also comfortable to wear.  We had a great time at the masquerade party and received many compliments."
5.0,I need to wear one compression sock every night after a minor foot injury. These are easier than others I've tried to put on and are very comfortable to sleep in!
5.0,Nice packaging. Quick delivery. Cute design. Perfect for Hamilton-loving granddaughter
5.0,"Whenever I travel to Las Vegas I always get shocked from static electricity , using the band was a game changer for me. Almost no shock when I touched metallic items or elevator buttons and if there was a shock it was very minimal"
5.0,"Very smooth material, could definitely be worn as a layering piece"
5.0,Great for day trips.

5.0,Fit as expected and good quality for price
5.0,Came earlier then expected. The material is great. Easy to pull off and on and breathable. Would recommend!
5.0,Shoulder not adjustable
5.0,Love it !! Is a great dress !
5.0,buying clothes on amazon can be pretty hit or miss but this dress was a success. It has become one of my favorite pieces. it is seriously such good quality and so timeless. my mom is a seamstress and even commented on the quality of the craftsmanship and fabric. the hidden zipper and pockets are nice touches and it is just very well made. definitely not for busty gals though! luckily it fit perfectly.
5.0,Very well made mask. Love it!!
5.0,I liked them because they was a perfect size abd gift for my daughter.
5.0,nice chains girl friend loved it.
5.0,This romper is super cute and comfy
5.0,The earrings are beautiful. They are small like other reviewers have mentioned but they were as expected.
5.0,Cute and goes with my Myra backpack
5.0,This is a very nice coat dress. It is soft and very comfortable. It is flattering on. The fit is very good.<br /><br />We were pleased with the durability of this jacket. The quality seemed very good. It seems like it will last a long time.<br /><br />It is pretty versatile. It will go with most things. It is very attractive.<br /><br />It provides a good amount of warmth. It isn't too thin or too thick - it is a good medium jacket.<br /><br />I would recommend it.
5.0,"I bought this dress in purple and love it!  The seams are flattering, and the knit fabric has enough heft to make it a good fall or spring dress.  Wear a sweater over it for colder temperatures.  Very comfortable.  I am 135 lbs., 5 foot 5 and bought size small."
5.0,Great quality.  Love them
5.0,"First I received a pair of these Garden Genie Gloves as a gift, then I quickly purchased more to give to my gardening friends and family. Wonderful cultivating action with the clawed hand, good tactile response with other. Black polyester knit gloves, snug ribbed-knit at the wrists, palm and fingers dipped in waterproofing latex. Decidedly best for those with right-handed dominance. The package included two pairs of gloves, but both have the right-handed glove with the clawed tips and left-handed glove without. Very good value, reasonably priced. Recommended!"
5.0,This was perfect for my granddaughter.  Good quality and looks so cute!
5.0,Soft stretchy neck gaiter.  Wicks well.  Very pleased with color.  No shrinkage or color loss after two washes
5.0,Inesperado absolutamente lo volvería a comprar👍
5.0,Velcro back instead of zipper .
5.0,"I got this as a gift for an angel tree at my place of work for a little 2 yr old boy. This reversible dog hoodie is adorable. I am pretty sure the little bot will just love it. Also, this company is great. Being a grandma of 2 little girls I am looking forward to ordering from them again, :D"
5.0,This is exactly what I needed.  I get so many complements.  Love it!
5.0,"These capes are bright, floor length with Velcro straps. Easy to put on and interchange. The capes are lightweight, sleek shiny fabric. The masks are made out of felt with stretchy band to hold them. They fit kids any age. They are fun to play dress up with."
5.0,This watch is very well made and the style is extremely different for a watch so very cute and comfortable. I cant tell I am wearing this watch so it fits me perfectly and the coil fit of the watch snaps back with force everytime. I would recommend this watch to anyone who likes bracelets with the hidden twist of a watch and wants something different from the normal look and fit of a watch look.  I also ordered the brown one so I cant wait til its delivered!
5.0,exactly what they look like. for ten bucks can't really beat it!
5.0,Great and stylish sunglasses - very comfortable and lightweight
5.0,Very good quality I recommend purchasing.
5.0,"You get what you pay for. This sweater isn’t warm or heavy; but it’s not see-through either? Overall pretty good quality for the price. I’m 5”5, 155 pounds, 32DD, and usually wear an 8 in jeans, and this hit me right at my belly button, so for me this was the perfect length. I’ll be buying another one, because it’s good for Florida winters."
5.0,"Overall high quality leather bag. Based on some reviews of other bags, they said to use a leather sealer to ensure the color would no stain your clothes. Maybe I used the sealer wrong but I prefer the original finish.<br /><br />As with any leather bags, it can and will be scratched which adds to the look. I normally have a 5 subject notebook, 13in dell laptop, power adaptor, small tote umbrella and an iPad mini in here with no issues. The inside pockets are useful for pens, and business cards. The center pouch is where I store cables. I do wish they had a key chain hook as right now I keep my VPN dongle hooked onto one of the internal zippers.<br /><br />The back pouch is very convenient for an iPad or storing a wallet or phone.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this bag. Very solid.<br /><br />Update: 3 years later<br />Zipper no longer shuts. Hook on the strap broke. Bag still looks great. So not horrible for 3 years if solid everyday use."
5.0,This top is very comfortable. It has the perfect amount of stretch.<br />My chest is large so the front pleat does not hang the way it should but I like the top so I can live with that.
5.0,"Item was exactly as described and was perfect. Love this wallet. Bought it to match with my MK bag and cosmetic case. The wallet is spacious, very well made , high quality and looks really classy"
5.0,"Comfortable to ware, is heavy duty."
5.0,"I was suprised at first becasue I noticed that part of the frame had already come apart during the shipping process, however, I quickly realized that they are designed with plastic nubs that hold the frame together and could easily pop it back in. Now that I have done that, they show no indication that it will pop apart again. The frame is amazingly light. I thought it was just cheap plastic at first but came to realize that the plastic is actually quite nice and has a lot of flexibility to it. The polarizing lenses are awesome and the glasses are overall comfertable to wear. As of now, I am quite happy with the glasses, especially for the price. If my opinion changes I will fix my review."
5.0,I wear a women’s size 8.5/9 and purchased these in XL 9-10 and they fit me perfectly. The slippers seem somewhat narrow. I have narrow feet so its not a problem for me and I imagine they’d stretch out a little on a wider foot. They also have a nice rubberized bottom but aren’t too stiff. Very cute and comfy!
5.0,"So fun, cute and comfortable!"
5.0,I loved the shirt. Sexy
5.0,This is ABSOLUTELY  True to size so if you are an XL buy that do not go bigger . I am a large but decided to go bigger just in case ..HUGE MISTAKE  its wayyyy stretchy & subsequently too big for me but that doesn't take away from how NICE ...this outfit is. Its GREAT quality nice thickness<br /> (can't spot my cellulite through it lol) and the color is just like the picture.<br /> Its straps are nice and thick it will cover your bra straps or anything else. I bought green XL im 5'3 and its not extra long it leaves space so if you're 5'7 it will go on your ankle and not rise yet it fit me fine. I am going to order again in a medium & give this one to my mom. Love it!

He'll LOVE it! I appreciate you too!"
5.0,Perfect size for my back pocket.

5.0,Elegant. Beautifully crafted. Fast delivery and elegant bag is a very nice touch.
5.0,"The charm is small, but just what I wanted."

5.0,I first bought it for myself and it was so beautiful I bought one for my daughter and her friend.
5.0,"Love these socks! My 5 month old can wear them! They are a tiny bit big on her right now, but I know she’ll be able to wear them for months to come! I’m super happy I ordered these!"

5.0,Fits my kiddo great and great quality.
5.0,Nice belt an real leather
5.0,I read reviews about getting these broken.... but got it anyways because it goes great with my bridesmaids dresses. They are beautiful and I had no issue. Knowing your not buying a 40$ necklace the material can be cheaper.... but I think they look and feel fine. Better then the price quality in my mind
5.0,Not judging yet as I just got them
5.0,"This is the 2nd bow I have bought for a little one I love.  Both purchases have been wonderful.  The bows are well made, durable, and hold up to a toddler that likes to take them off and play with them.  I will continue to purchase bows from this seller!"

5.0,Brought these for my fiance and I am loving him in them! He really likes them and I will be buying more!
5.0,"Nice jacket, very well made and pretty :)"
5.0,"Well first I'll say, these boots look even more awesome in person! You can't really tell from the photos, but the boots are super shiny, almost like a metallic look. At first I think they are gold, then you seesilver. Anyways, it's an awesome color. On top is these large jewels, which I was unsure of at first, but, they really fit the style and look pretty sweet. Now the pattern on these boots resembles a snake skin material, that I adore. As far as comfort.. they are amazingly comfy. The inside has a soft, wool like material to keep you feets warm, toor but also feels good to walk in. The make of them are just as great, it's certainly not a cheap looking pair nor do they feel cheap. I don't see any reason why they wouldn't hold up for many seasons. I received this product free for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Most comfortable pjs!
5.0,This dress fitted perfectly. I really liked it a lot.
5.0,"It was packaged well and came in 2 days. This is really an inexpensive bra compared to other brand but it hugged pretty well. I like that it is convertible and can be worn with strap or without strap under a sleeveless dress or shirt. It’s good material too, comfortable with a supportive lift."
5.0,Awesomely fun and very good
5.0,"this product was exactly what i needed it to be.  It came to be very useful, thanks for the product."
5.0,"will definitely buy again, only which there were more color choices"
5.0,"Great flower girl dress! I do advise that the dress is designed to be somewhat open in the back to display the lace up effect. I ordered a size up for my flower girls and the dresses do not close in the back due to the design. Regardless, the dress is absolutely beautiful and I am very pleased with my purchase!"
5.0,Made earrings they were perfect
5.0,This is exactly what I was looking for. The right size. The right material. The right feel.
5.0,"well made, very beautiful"
5.0,The only thing that really distinguishes this from Apples is the double post.  My watch came with a white band and I wanted black but now I am thinking to add some new colors.
5.0,my artist loves it
5.0,Good value for the price. A little big through the arms but I am using on a paddle board so that works really well.<br />Lovely coverage.
5.0,Great vibrant colors.
5.0,I am loving my new sunglasses. They are very stylish and comfortable at the same time. The neutral color lets me wear them with anything. They are pretty durable. But pretty sure that if they were mistreated they would be damaged. These are perfect for this summer.
5.0,both my girls loved the jackets. Especially all the embellishments and pictures. Great quality
5.0,Great fit. Top is long but probably not long enough for leggings
5.0,Super cute design and well made! It came with buttons to insert into your instrument and it was easy to install. I’ve enjoyed using it to play my ukulele.
5.0,"Love this top! It dresses up any outfit, skirt or jeans, and the fit is perfect, flattering and classy. I always get compliments whenever I wear it, and absolutely love the look. Ordering a second in an alternative color!"
5.0,"I absolutely love these! My favorite Christmas theme is gingerbread, I'm a completely addicted gingerbread fan so I had to have these. My frame is usually an extra large, but I bought these in large and they actually fit perfect. if you want them a little bit loose I would suggest going with your actual size. They are colorful, they look just like the picture and I've already gotten a few compliments. Definitely worth your money."
5.0,Good dea
5.0,"I am 4'11, 145lbs and I ordered a medium. This is 100% acrylic which makes it really soft against your skin.<br />the zipper on this thing is metal and its pretty solid.<br />it looks so nice when you have it on. if I order another color I may go up a size!! they way this sweater is cut you can easily throw on some tights and make this a easy outfit!!<br /><br /> I have zero complaints about this sweater"
5.0,"Very soft, nice print"
5.0,"I love these tanks, I have an array of colors now, but what I love more was the quick and kind response from the company’s customer service. I originally received large tanks in a medium bag, but they were replaced without issue and I received the medium tanks in just a couple of days. 5 stars for the CSR :)."
5.0,Alright I must admit as a tournament tennis player with 35 Championships in the last 5 years I can honestly say that these compression socks do the job.
5.0,Great value.  Capri looks awesome.
5.0,Bright colored and cute. More of a fall/spring jacket
5.0,I love it. I ordered 5 colors. I ordered my usual size and it fit perfectly. Great for wearing over tank blouses and dresses in my office.
5.0,"Current price $15.99. Size 4-5T<br /><br />Simply adorable dress! I love that there is a button on the back of the dress, so I don't have to dry to smush my little's head through the neck opening. The tulle is soft and is complimented by the chambray top. I am in love with gold and the stars accent the dress perfectly. Simply love this dress and so does my little! 5 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful. Very well made. Comfy to wear!"
5.0,Birthday present for my oldest daughter.
5.0,My daughter is into the 80’s jazzercise videos on YouTube and wanted a similar looking leotard. This is perfect!!! High cut legs and the cross crossing straps look beautiful.
5.0,"Great quality band. Love the imaging, so cute!"
5.0,"Good quality, very much as pictured"
5.0,"The pants are very comfy and roomy do walk, run, dance, any kind of movement! And the fabric is light so it doesn't feel heavy. It has two pockets so it's convinient to carry stuff. For care I just wash warm with easy detergent, hang dry & light iron. These pants are great for casual wear for outside or lounging inside."
5.0,I like it to ride my recumbent bicycle
5.0,This shirt fit my 7yr old as expected sizes are accurate and the print is pretty vibrant
5.0,"These are so fun, and the variety is wonderful.  I like that it includes different tones of metals, and varying shapes.  It makes for a lot of fun for jewelry making!  My daughter and I like to make gifts for her friends, and mine.  These look so nice! :)"
5.0,"I am a little heavier and thought I should go up a size (like I usually have to do on items I purchase online), but there was no need and these are the most comfortable pants I have ever worn.  No pulling and tugging at them, they are extremely soft, and are what I consider easy wear.  I absolutely love these pants, I will be purchasing other colors.  I also love they are a fair trade company, believe in sustainability, and create materials naturally."
5.0,Perfect for a casual night out.  Shear and breathable but not see through.  Adjustable straps. True to size.  I highly recommend this dress!
5.0,Best glasses ever! Great price! Loveeeee them
5.0,Awesome sandals! Love the fit and color! Seller was fast to ship and sandals came brand new exactly as described! A++
5.0,Xmas present so dont know if it fits or not lol
5.0,"I love these shirts! I bought a dozen xL and roomy in white to sleep in, another dozen in large in gray to work in my yard, and many of each blue, black and burgundy in medium to wear out socialize’n… I love the heavy quality cotton…the fit is great!"
5.0,"Id love to buy more colors, true to size ordered in a gray I'm 188 lbs orderd a xl fits great."
5.0,Looks great and exactly what I was hoping for at a much more reasonable price.
5.0,"A great product! It didn't shrink in the wash, as so many other 100% cotton tees do. The graphics are vivid and true to the picture. Overall, it's a great purchase for any Whovian!"
5.0,"The material seems to be really good. It is cute and comfortable. Wouldn’t recommend to people, like me, with big breasts cause it doesn’t have support."
5.0,This bracelet was just as described. I love it and have had ma y compliments on it.
5.0,"I received the dress quickly, fits great, a little long but I can fix it. Thanks so much!!!!"
5.0,"Cute, soft adorable"
5.0,"Lighter, thinner fabric than expected, but very good quality."
5.0,"Excellent quality cap w/some nice attention to detail like on back of hat, and the pattern under the bill.  I was looking for &#34;dog themed&#34; cap when could no longer find my longtime favorite &#34;Life is Good&#34; brand caps featuring the dog and just happened to run across these Barkology brand caps in my search. The saying made me chuckle, and when received was impressed w/quality, so ordered the navy distressed &#34;Woof&#34; cap as well and it too was excellent quality with nice details. I am female, but my opinion is caps are unisex...so good for any dog lover."
5.0,"Love the material on this. It's thick cotton. My baby crawls around on carpet a lot, and so far I haven't seen any lint piling from rubbing."
5.0,"These are so soft and comfortable. I don't like tight clothes so I got XL, I'm 5'3"" 140 lbs."
5.0,"I bought it for my vet tech, fish obsessed, boyfriend who loves it! Perfect fit, can be adjusted, and the straps for his mask is fantastic so he can ensure his goggles or face guards won’t move or slip. Thank you"
5.0,"Very happy with this purchase!  Excellent quality.  Perfectly cast with a shiny, flawless finish.  Would buy it again."
5.0,My daughter loves these. She was so excited to put them on when she opened them for Christmas. They fit her perfectly. She is 4.
5.0,"My wife loved this for Christmas, just as described just what I wanted."
5.0,I love this bracelet keychain! It is so simple and easy to get on and off my wrist. The silicone formed rings are too small for me so this one being stretchy is amazing!
5.0,This is beautiful!!!! Great material and the style is supper cute
5.0,"I ordered a size up just in case because you never know when you're ordering things online you can't try them on or look at them you know, and because I ordered a size up they are a little loose but they're perfect. I love the pocket it's nice, holds my phone securely. I love them."
5.0,"Oh, I have gobs of these Tides flip flops.  I love, love, love them.  With 2 bone spurs in each foot, I have to have the support of the arch & also the deep heel cup.  I've been wearing these all Summer long for 3 Summers now & am praying they never discontinue these ever, or I'll be up a creek. I have just about every color...well, almost every.  :)"
5.0,"Adjustable for comfort; good size bow for the average person's neck; does not look clownish. Color goes well with white, black, grey, blue shades."
5.0,I got these earrings two weeks after ordering it .I was very satisfied with the overall appearance.
5.0,I received the cover all this morning. It is beautiful and it almost looks a casual dress. I highly recommended it!!
5.0,Loved it! Beautiful piece
5.0,"I loved it. Super cute and on my 2 month year old son it looks so cute. I get so many cute compliments. I so recommend it. Super soft, thick and it keeps my baby warm.."
5.0,I have bad knees and have worn shoes for years that have easy straps. Now with the shoehorn I am able to wear loafers.
5.0,Nice shower shoe. Good construction for the price
5.0,"SO cozy! Fits really well, i love the off the shoulder look. Handwashing is kind of a pain but the sweater is so worth it. Does run big but they said that on the website."
5.0,very nice bag! love it!
5.0,These blue light glasses are perfection!! The black frame is super sleek and light weight! These are perfect to wear while staring at the computer screen all day to protect your eyes and easy to transition into evening wear while causal glancing at your phone! Very comfortable and EXCELLENT value for the money!
5.0,"Cute glasses for the price. Not as sturdy as Oakley's or Ray-Bans, which was surprising since the normal retail is about the same - but definitely worth the $39 I paid.<br /><br />As info, the metal IS silver. Sometimes hard to tell in photos and it drives me nuts that never listed. I don't wear gold."
5.0,Initially when I bought the dress I wasn’t awed by it. Looked like a regular casual dress. But it’s actually great in pictures and I love the pockets. The dress is great for autumn n winter and I usually wear it with Capri leggings and boots or slip on shoes.
5.0,It was just like the picture I would recommend it
5.0,"Have been using this wallet for several months now. Takes some getting used to once you first get it but you'll get the hang of it eventually. I don't usually carry money on me so this was perfect for me, if I do carry cash I've never had an issue not feeling secure. Rubber band is holding up nicely and the metal isn't fading."
5.0,These fit extremely well. They are truly high waisted AND the leg length is long enough. I wish there were more available in other color-ways!!
5.0,"I was worried about it looking cheap, but it's actually well made and really pretty."
5.0,100% favorite glasses i have purchased and will be ordering from this company again!
5.0,This is a great leotard at a great price. The quality and fit are excellent for my slim six-year-old. Better than expected.
5.0,It’s honestly much bigger than I expected and it’s adorable! The ring feels sturdy so nothing will just fall off and the accessories are high quality
5.0,"Super soft and comfortable, did not slip off while running."
5.0,"Perfectly as described!  I cannot find captive jewelry physically around my location, so i resorted to looking online.  The hoops snugly hold the balls, but not so tight as I cannot get them in and out.  I say worth $10/set because these would be more expensive than that at Hot Topic or Spencer's.  Thanks!"
5.0,"I NEVER buy sunglasses online. I always have to try them on because I'm super particular. I also always overpay for them too. After taking a chance on these, I am absolutely hooked and will buy more. The style is flattering and the sun coverage is perfect. After being in full sun most of the day, I notice no eye strain. The weight is good. Enough to feel good quality but also so light that you'll hardly know they are there. The company seems to be very customer-oriented. Comes in a nice box with instructions, thank you note and a polarized test card. I highly recommend these sunglasses and am a new fan of the brand."
5.0,Beautiful - met all expectations
5.0,"Ordered 3, these are a perfect gift for a special teacher! Good quality."
5.0,This vest is great! It fits true to size. It looks and feels of good quality. Looks great over a button up shirt with or without a jacket. The color seen in picture is pretty close to how it looks in person. My husband said it was comfortable and would wear it with a T-shirt as well.
5.0,Wife likes it very much
5.0,I bought this just for the diaper cover but ended up having my little guy wear the onesie too because it was so cute. The suspenders are made from ribbons and the number 1 is actually embroidered. High quality for the price
5.0,"Possibly the best on the water sunglasses I have ever owned. If the polycarbonate are this good, the glass version must be off the charts."
5.0,Got these for the beach and gave them out to family and friends good quality will buy more
5.0,As expected great clean product
5.0,This is amazing.
5.0,"size was right and elastic inner band works well, brim is not perfectly level but the 3&#34; brim blocks the sun just right, I replaced the thin black band with a better band, but overall this hat comfortably does what I need done"
5.0,Very cute costume
5.0,Doesn't hurt when I put it in. Its the perfect shape.
5.0,"Love it, love the sound"
5.0,&#60;3 this necklace.
5.0,"We were sent a pink instead of the lavender, but it fits perfectly."
5.0,So cool. Lot bigger then I thought. My grandson will really enjoy this. Very nicely designed.
5.0,These frames are by far my favorite frames I have ever bought I love the funky design and they fit fabulous on my face I can't wait to customize them with my own Swarovski crystals and put lenses in them they absolutely worth the price tenfold I'll be buying more in every color for sure
5.0,These keychains are so cute.  They are well made.  This is the best possible price for Prime delivery of these key chains.  I am using them as favors for my daughter's sweet 16.  I tied the keychains to an small organza bag filled with Hershey kisses.
5.0,"This is one of those, ""holy smokes Amazon retailers, you've done it again!"" I've spent 3-4x  the price on comparable high-end joggers (lulu & athleta) bc thats what i thought was required. nope. These lil cuties look exactly like the athleta salutations. they run *smaller* tho the material is a pretty close match, if a tad shiny. also great color selection. I'm 5'7"" and 132lbs & wear the Small Tall in Athleta, which i find a bit too snug on the belly. With these, i ordered a Large  and they fit like S/M if Athleta made hybrid sized joggers. These are slim fit at waist and then looser till the ankle. they're more forgiving than the athleta, and thats what i wanted: less compression, more freedom. They're not billowy or overly loose. I'm ok with the length of 29"", bc i scootch up the legs anyway. Could they be longer? yea. that would be nice. But. For the quality and price, these are a terrific  bargain! Love them! Yay! Thank you, Oalka! xx"
5.0,Bought for my grandson Christmas present; he totally loved this jacket.  Style was great as was fit too.
5.0,"I purchased this for my husband, who’s us big Rolling Stones fan. He loves it and it’s a nice wide mask."
5.0,Great souvenir of the Chicago Cubs first World Series win in 108 years.
5.0,Light weight and pretty while being highly functional
5.0,"very well made, fit was right on."
5.0,I bought this item twice for both my grandson's birthdays and they are extremely happy with the product they've had no issues. And of course I thought all the hoodies to go with it
5.0,You’ll have to wear it for few days so leather soften. Great looking band.
5.0,I love these! Studs are so cute and don't look cheap at all. Pearl ones are my personal fave!<br />Def would buy!
5.0,Bought these for my grand daughter for Christmas. She loves them and everyone thought they were real diamonds. They look fabulous on her.
5.0,Got this bikini for the top and it fits great! I wear a 34 DD and got a large. Happy with my purchase!
5.0,Excellent and stylish.  A true watch band equal to my those found on higher end watches.
5.0,I love my watch band! The colors are so bright!
5.0,"I like the model , it is comfortable and loose, the material is amazing.<br />Thank you"
5.0,Stylish comfortable and durable! Worth the money.
5.0,"This dress is beautiful- the colors are just gorgeous. I have a short torso, and this dress really compliments my frame. I’m 5’4 so it is a bit too long, but I can alter it or wear a wedge type shoe. Great price and quality and so comfy yet stylish. I’m so glad I bought two."
5.0,Sized as expexted.<br />Looks good<br />Functional.<br />What more can you ask for ?
5.0,Came is pictured with no problems. These are nice.
5.0,"These are great my husband is so happy he is very hard to buy for but he loves &#34;toys&#34;. He had so much fun hunting with them and being able to record hands free, they are fun when we went zip lining too!"
5.0,Dress came in quickly. Packaging was intact. Purchased as a present. Unsure if  it will hold up for many washes. Very soft and lightweight.
5.0,"Really good quality. Arrived inside a clear box. Head band and two clips.<br />Rim, about 6.5”. Height about 4.5”. Satin finish. Very sturdy."
5.0,The dress is as exactly like the picture. I just loved everything about it.
5.0,"Son couldn’t wait to put these on his crocs, and absolutely loved them. There was to many for his crocs so he ended up giving some to his cousin"
5.0,Bought these for my 3 girls for Christmas they're going to love them
5.0,"I get lots of compliments when I wear this sunflower top. The blue background is not dark navy as the photo shows, it’s closer to royal blue. Very roomy in the size xl I bought. Soft and flowy fabric, long enough to cover my butt."
5.0,Easy and breezy
5.0,"Very happy with the look of this dress.  Great quality, fits perfect.  Reasonable price"
5.0,Exactly what my daughter was looking for
5.0,Great earrings great price. Love them
5.0,it came in after a while but I love very far (USA) from the seller. I was more than happy when it came it doubled my expectations . I have a somewhat bigger head and it for me I love that you can adjust it it fits all . like seriously get it it's worth if
5.0,"It looks good on me for my birthday and makes a statement,  love it"
5.0,"Got this as a gift for my best friend and her daughter. Saw them today and they were wearing them! My friend even told me her daughter hasn’t taken them off since they arrived! They looked spotless and seem to be very durable, which is super important when picking out gifts for little ones. Last but not least they really are super cute! Really great value if you’re looking for a “mommy and me” style gift, I’ll be sending them to more of my mom friends for sure."
5.0,Looks great and quality
5.0,its great but the only thing bad about way when i first buttoned it up one of buttons fell off but that's nothing i can't fix. sill a great shirt.
5.0,"My son brought one of these home from the hospital where he works, and gave it to me when the one I was wearing broke. I like it so much, I found the exact same ones to order more.<br /><br />There are multiple layers of protection and a tight, but comfortable fit. Yet, it’s very breathable, and not hot. (I live in Texas.) As someone who is extra vulnerable with a chronic condition, I feel safer in this mask than others.<br /><br />Be aware that the two straps go behind your head, not ears. It’s comfortable, but not as attractive if you have long hair. I put the lower strap underneath my hair, which is upper back length."
5.0,They are Awesome!
5.0,"This bracelet is the perfect fit for a small wrist... It is comfortable and looks stylish, yet still dainty enough.  Also, the watch came with an extra battery, which I have never received when buying a watch before!"
5.0,So cute. As good of quality as you could expect for the price!
5.0,Bought them for my boyfriend. I was hesitant about buying them but went ahead with it. Cheaper than Oakley had them for and he doesn't notice a difference.
5.0,"I love these, they are so comfortable and perfect for sensitive ears! My piercings used to get so irritated even when using sterling silver. Titanium is the way to go for sure and these are so cute!"
5.0,It was a gift and my son loves them
5.0,"I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by the fit and the quality of this hat. This hat is surprisingly well made. It really is a nice hat and it's a snug fit. And you surely can't beat the price. I absolutely love it. And the other plus to owning this hat is it is machine washable. I put it in a small mesh laundry bag by itself, on a small load, short cycle in the wash. I hung this hat on an over the door rack for it to air dry, and it is absolutely perfect. I'm going to buy all of the other colors. This really is a nice hat to own. Besides that, it keeps my head toasty warm and I've gotten lots of compliments because it's different, but nice. A few people have asked where I got it, but I won't tell them for fear that I'll see them running around here in 'my' hats.<br /><br />This is an absolute awesome product."
5.0,My husband loved this watch gave him for Christmas he believes I broke the bank to get it he is so impressed
5.0,"Super cute, comfy and modest dress. I bought the size small and I’m about 5’5.5” and 135lbs. I typically wear a size 6 and am pear shaped. This fit perfect in a small. There is some stretch to the dress, but if a cheery gal, may need to size up as there isn’t a lot of wiggle room there, think the small could only handle a B cup or less. It hit a little past my knees and curves up a little on the sides. Polka dots makevit youthful, but the muted blue makes it feel a little more mature. Would buy again."
5.0,"Beautiful dress! Got the burgundy color and it is gorgeous! I’m usually wearing size small, but ordered the medium for per the size chart and it fits great"
5.0,The bands are soo pretty!!!!
5.0,I ordered a pair of magenta space dye. Omg are they soft and supple. I had my doubts that they would be good quality because of the cost so I was really surprised! They are so bright and eye catching I've gotten 2 compliments on the magenta both times I wore them!<br />Went back and ordered the charcoal space dye and heather grey too. Heather grey fabric is a little thicker and not quite as soft but still great.<br /><br />I take s small. They seemed a little big at first but after a first washing shrunk a bit and now fit perfect.  Not sure they would hold up for heavy exercise like running but perfect for yoga/barre and so comfy I don't want to to take them off!

5.0,"This is truly a great quality chef hat, with the monogramming!!  Superb customer service from the seller.  After placing my order, they made a last minute change for me.

5.0,"Incredible I thing my dangle earring hangs backwards, but I love them so much."
5.0,"Silicone is nice and soft, so feels great on the wrist. The dots mimick perforated holes you would find on rally straps, so it gives it a modern aesthetic."
5.0,"this is not available in ""Womens"" sizes though it says ""womens"".<br /><br />the xl is not a Womens size.  I wish it came larger I would certainly purchase it.<br /><br />Kristi"
5.0,The mask is made of quality material the is no itchy. It is a conversation starter.
5.0,Are use this for when it’s 20 degrees or lower is very warm perfect fit!
5.0,This dress I ordered in a medium im 5'11 150lbs 34A and it fit like a glove  and didn't have to wear a bra and looked great. The material was perfect not too thick not too thin  very breathable.  length is right below the knee for me with heels on.  Would definitely  buy again in another color I bought in the navy blue and was beautiful. Very well made for the price. Came on time for an event. Very satisfied customer
5.0,"It is very thin does not look like 2mm chain, but it is pretty strong, looks nice and real gold. So give the price of gold. Its is an ""OK"" buy."
5.0,It’s very nice beautiful coloring and very comfortable
5.0,"I LOVE these! They are all so attractive, sturdy and a great price. They don't look cheap either which I like. -My sister bought me a purse hook a couple of years ago and I really didn't think I would use it. Now I can't imagine being without one.-By the way, I am the kind of person who puts my whole life in my purse...I usually buy a new purse every 3 months because I overstuff my large purses and they end up breaking. These hooks can even handle my huge and heavy purses. YAY!-It's nice to be able to keep my eye on my bag instead of draping it over the back of my chair and not just hooking it to my leg or putting it on the floor. -This is so civilized :) Haha."
5.0,Very comfortable. I like the light weight.
5.0,"I really love this dress! It was exactly what I expected. And a huge hit at the wedding I wore it to. The only thing that needs to be fixed is its a bit long. I'm so short. 5' 1&#34; (on a good day lol) and it was about a half inch too long. If I had time before the wedding I would have shortened it a tad, but I still LOVE this dress!"
5.0,The color love This very Soft want in different colors like pink. white red

5.0,Great product easy to use  and clean
5.0,Purchased two pairs so far. They are great and no pain when sleeping with them in
5.0,I give this a 5 star because the product is just as good as the more expensive onesies. For the price it’s great. I ordered a xl because I’m 6’2 200lbs most onesies fit small but this 1 is bigger then I thought it’s more like a xxl. But still worth the money.
5.0,"I am pleasantly surprised by the size (not fat like I feared), the color is true to image and it appears well made! I have glasses with a bit of bling plus magnetized shades and the case is perfect size. Love love love the purple exterior and bright green interior! Looked at many before choosing — so glad I chose well!"
5.0,"loved the shirt; however, had to return the XXL and order an XL."
5.0,"It is listed at 1250€ at Frederique Constant's website and I got it for 373$ + Fees, what a great deal.<br />Watch is quite elegant, very high quality as expected and looks much better than the pictures."
5.0,"So, I couldn't decide black or red?  I opted for this three pack and ultimately went with the black.  It was only a few bucks more to get three pair, so what the heck!  I have gloves for the future.  I wanted these because I was going to be at a wedding and didn't want to have to take off my gloves to eat, these were perfect and beautiful!"
5.0,They work like it said. Comfortable and easy to wear.
5.0,My daughter loves these.  Have used them extensively to practice her nail art.

5.0,I am a woman and bought these for myself. They are so comfortable and I love the pockets.  They are made of heavy denim and are warm.

5.0,Great buy and good quality.

5.0,Love Elvis

It's not too tight, not too revealing, and I will be wearing this to a wedding with a black shawl and black heels. It looks like it's from Saks, honestly. I'm so happy with this purchase."
5.0,The vest fits exactly as how I pictured it. Nice material & color. A good buy.

5.0,This dress was perfect! I have never had so many compliments in my life!
5.0,"I loves my sweater. But when I got the package and open it. It look like somebody just grab it and throw in a smaller ziplock bag that was too small for my sweater to fit in. Last one I got was fold neatly, in bag seal tight and in another ziplock bag that I was please and happy but not this time I was almost going to send it back but time it running out and I need it for my trip"
5.0,I love this dress it's so comfortable and pretty at the same time the length is a little long for my taste but great dress overall
5.0,Love this nightgown

5.0,"The bonnets were used in an 8th grade play and were not only the favorite of the performers, but also the audience.  They received many accolades."
5.0,Really cute evil eye brooch
5.0,"Perfect fit (even after washing), super comfy."
5.0,Honestly....I’m a legging snob and lululemon is where it’s at.  Until I received these! I will probably never buy lululemon again!!! These are the same... I might even say BETTER!!! Totally in love! Even bought three extra pairs! THANK YOU!!!

5.0,"A little thin, but will work"
5.0,Were as advertised
5.0,"I just received this sweater today and it was worth the wait. This is a gorgeous, very thick and well made sweater. It doesn't have a tag. I'm thinking it's hand made to order. It's very unique and that's what I love about it. I ordered the army green and the color is beautiful, exactly what I was looking for. This will look nice with a pair of jeans and booties, a t-shirt and scarf. I wouldn't wear it with leggings because it's not quite long enough for that since it comes just under my butt, maybe if your younger you can get a way with it.<br /><br />The picture I added doesn't do the sweater justice since all I did was lay it out on the bed, but I just wanted to show the color. When I put it on it's so heavy then it stretches out and looks great."
5.0,Love this backpack! Perfect size for just a few things for the day! I’m impressed with the quality for the price!
5.0,I have only had these glasses about 5 days so I can't give an in depth review. I do like the looks and they are comfortable and lightweight. I'm not sure about the tension on the arms of the glasses. I don't know if the tension can be adjusted.
5.0,I can't ssh enough about this skirt. It's very figure flattering. Looks expensive.
5.0,Great pants. I love them. Fit just as expected.
5.0,Good value.  Nice looking bracelet really dressed up vintage Swiss hand wound watch.  Elegant bling!  Fit well.
5.0,Very good bra! It doesn’t have patting which is fine with me but if you like patting then this bra isn’t for you. The back waste band is a little itchy at times but it’s okay. Overall love this bra!
5.0,Any size will fit. I'm 5'2&quot; 172lbs and can wear the small -large. I like small bc they don't stretch out over time. I like em a lot.  Waitress in em every day.
5.0,They arrived so fast! Loved that and the floaty pens.

5.0,"I absolutely love this ring, it is more beautiful and bigger/thicker in size than l imagined.  I get a lot of compliments on this ring!<br />Thanks Amazon 🥰"
5.0,Love this purse so much
5.0,I use this for work. I love it. I wish the straps were longer but overall it’s great.
5.0,"I want one in every color! It is the ultimate maxi dress, so comfy, so flattering, and it has pockets! Material is soft and i can dress it up or sleep in it...whatever I want!"
5.0,Great decorative glasses! Very trendy and of a good quality!
5.0,Wonderful item for a young child.
5.0,I'm really thick have big thighs and i am 5'3 I usually wear a size 14 or 15 in jeans and after reading a few Qs & As and some reviews I didn't think these jeans would fit but I took a chance and ordered a size XL they fit me fine I love these jeans I want to get them in all the colors I can but unfortunately I haven't been able to get them in green really wanna order some my size but anyway if you have thick thighs like I do I suggest you order a size XL
5.0,Cute pattern and comfortable!
5.0,"Perfect covered my teenager appropriately, and was still hip"
5.0,Beautiful vintage dress
5.0,Fits great. Padding could be better but not bad for the price
5.0,Perfect! Just the item I needed for my no sew quilted ornaments! Quick shipping!
5.0,The bracelet was delivered as promised and in perfect shape.  I bought it for my sister-in-law and I think she will be very happy.

5.0,"I have worn these earrings several times, and people always comment on how cute the are."
5.0,Fits as expected. Nice thicker shirt. Just what I was looking for.
5.0,"Great quality, oversized aviator fit, when compared to my quay high key rimless, there’s no difference. Am definitely buying another pair! It also came with a cleaning cloth and protective bag."

5.0,Gave it to my granddaughter – she loves it!
5.0,These gloves fit perfectly and kept me warm in the snow.
5.0,Very fine and elegant product. The dial is way lighter than shown in the photos; it is a very light color almost white. However it looks beautiful and although was not what I expected I decided to keep the watch. Very high quality as one would expect from Rado. Packaging and shipping was great.
5.0,These fit great. I like the shorter posts and have no problems! You get a ton too which is nice.
5.0,I really like.  Seems like a good quality.  Very happy
5.0,Exactly as pictured easy to use and light weight!
5.0,"Overall,  the bag has a very sturdy construction. It has a lot of storage space to the point that I downsized from a backpack twice the size of this bag and still had room to spare. The extra pouch that came with it is a welcome addition for extra storage space.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the plastic keychain clip inside the larger of the two outside pockets seems a bit flimsy compared to the rest of the bag's construction.<br /><br />This bag is now my new EDC bag and I'm sure it will be my EDC bag for years to come."
5.0,"I really like this dress, and how it can be so versatile."
5.0,Cute white belle sleeve shirt. Lace is soft and stretchy shirt is comfortable.
5.0,I lIke being able to buy different sizes for each piece. I have a bigger top than bottom. Which makes it hard buying swimsuits.<br />These swimsuit bottoms are nicely made and fit well. Not cheaply made! Sizes are correct not small or too big! I love the poke-a-dots and so does my husband! Lol
5.0,this bracelet looks exactly like the photo and it took less than a week to get to me and it fits perfectly!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful! I had to adjust it a bit to make it fit my ear. It is adjustable just be careful when bending so it doesnt break.
5.0,These fit just right and are very comfortable.  The fabric is somewhat thin but holds its shape.
5.0,It's comfy!
5.0,This is the 3rd one I've purchased. Looks and wears nice. Doesn't feel cheap. Lots of compliments. Love these to wear to work so I don't have to worry about damaging an expensive watch.
5.0,Amazing Seiko diver. Beautiful blue with a great movement. And spend the extra money for this....the made in Japan version.  A modern classic. I cant keep looking at it.
5.0,"Slim and fashionable, perfect for the occasion."
5.0,"These hats are adorable! Since our son was a newborn, we have always called him our little turkey, so I couldn’t resist getting this hat for him. He is 9 months now and it fits him well with a some room to grow. It comes with two hats, so the other we will give as a gift."
5.0,"It's so hard to find quail socks sometimes, but these were super comfortable and stylish!"
5.0,"Strap is very comfortable. It feels sturdier than I expected for the price, but buyers should keep in mind that it is somewhat thin, but not a problem considering it's affordability. The portion of the strap that goes around your neck is fairly thick, but where it attaches to the camera is thin. I am very happy with this purchase and think it looks much nicer and more professional than a factory camera strap."
5.0,I got this for my bf and I and we absolutely love it super adjustable for different wrist sizes but both of us have small wrists. I recommend for anyone looking for a gift for their partner👍👍
5.0,Perfect replacements for a commonly lost part thanks to a few younglings.
5.0,"Love them.  They are round and fit my face well,  just my style. The arms of the sunglasses are definitely more fragile then other sunglasses you may find but I like that they are thin and have a danity design."
5.0,"My family use these during the holiday season to wonder around the neighborhood to look at the holiday lights. Last time we went however, one house was particularly decked out and it was a mind-blowing experience through these glasses.<br /><br />Me, my mom, my grandma, my brother, my aunt on my mom’s side, her husband, my three cousins all were staring at this house for a good 15 minutes mumbling “wow”, “incredible”, “stunning”. Then grandma hollered out quite loudly “this is the best day of my life”.<br /><br />The homeowner apparently got concerned, exited the abode and yelled that she was gonna call the cops. My grandma just said “Sorry, we just love your house.”  I guess the homeowner was flattered, as she quickly changed her tune, and her and my grandma started talking about the house, then a cookie recipe, long story short, they’re now friends and play bunko together on Wednesdays.<br /><br />All because a bunch of related idiots were dumbfounded because of these glasses. Should note, my grandma did have some pain killers in her system as she had just gotten a root canal the day before.<br /><br />Overall, would recommend these glasses. Yes they are paper, so 100% will crumple and fall apart. Be careful with them, you don’t want to miss out on a potential friendship, and the best day of nana's life."
5.0,Great googles for a great price! Made for a good ski trip.
5.0,The scarf feels nice to the touch and looks great. It arrived sooner than I expected too. A very good value for the money.
5.0,"I wasn't expecting much with this,but its perfect! The material is a weird but still looks great. I wear a medium/large in all clothes I buy and ordered in a large. Medium would have worked perfect but large made it long enough to wear with some jeggings I have been wanting to wear and no shirt to wear with them. I will be ordering more colors!!"
5.0,I love my cap and have gotten compliments at work.  I love supporting a small company hand making these.  They came beautifully packaged with some dried flowers and lots of love.
5.0,Great value and easy quick meal
5.0,they were quite a few different designs and options within the pack.  Quality seems OK I guess we will see how they hold up but for the price they are cute and there are plenty.
5.0,"Excellent product, way better than expected for the price.  I bought this for a 13 year old boy that is 6'1&#34; and 150 lbs.  Very tall and thin, the suit fit perfectly."
5.0,These socks run a little big but overall I am very happy. I wanted a non white but cream color sock to wear with my vintage sneakers and neutral summer outfits. I get compliments on them all the time.
5.0,"These are nice socks, well constructed, appear to be durable.<br /><br />I've walked several miles in them and they're comfortable. The terry padding from the toes along the sole to the heel adds some cushion. They slide in my shoes more easily than some others I've tried, but they aren't slippery.<br /><br />No trouble with itchiness.<br /><br />The toe seams are medium size and hard, but with the padding on one side they feel somewhat flatter than usual.<br /><br />The ""arch support"" band around the middle isn't uncomfortably tight. I don't know if it really helps with the arches.<br /><br />I usually wear size 9.5 or 10 shoes. The size L I got fits well, with enough stretch to fit a couple sizes bigger. The size chart on the packaging is a little different than the one in the Amazon description. FWIW, the packaging says: S 3-5.5 men/4-6.5 women; M 6-8.5 men/7-9.5 women; L 9-11.5 men/10-12.5 women.<br /><br />The packaging also differs from the description here in leaving out the Staycool fiber, which Amazon says is 3% of the fabric. The packaging gives the fibers as 60% alpaca, 35% recycled nylon, 5% lycra.<br /><br />I like wool socks for their toughness and comfort. Like others I've had, these have less trouble with odors than other sock fabrics do."
5.0,Husband wears for landcaping..good watch.
5.0,"Oh. My. God. I wish I’d bought these months ago for my son, because babies in leg warmers are basically the most adorable things you’ve ever seen! I got these for my son, as he is tall and his pajama legs pull up and leave exposed leg at night. These are perfect—and they are organic! They cover him up, keep him warm, and he loves to look at the bright designs (especially the airplanes). I’ve washed them several times without shrinking or fading, or any other compromise in quality. Get these now!"
5.0,Dress fits my 8yr old daughter. I usually buy her size 7-8 . Very good material has held up after washing.Overall this dress is beautiful and worth it will be purchasing other colors.
5.0,Perfect height! Love these shoes! Super comfy!
5.0,I brought these for my daughter and she lives the way they look and feel on her ear
5.0,"This dress is VERY stretchy, and fits my curves so well. It also came super fast. I was really shocked. I got it in less than a week! Love the colors, and hugs me in all the right places. It slips over your head, so there are no zippers, but it's so stretchy, that it's really simple and easy to get on and off."
5.0,PERFECT. Do yourself a favor and buy these lanyards. The “buckle” can be adjusted to help oversized masks fit more securely and allows the mask to hang comfortably when not in use. Great and lightweight. Highly Recommend!
5.0,"What a great dress!  Soft, flattering.  Well made for the price, and washed well. I put in a lingerie bag and hung dried on the rack.  It's short though!  I'm 5'3, 125lbs and it's as short as in in the picture. With the right shoes, you'll have legs for days :)"
5.0,Sturdy watch with a clear display.
5.0,These were a huge hit with the kids.  I highly recommend.

5.0,I love this purse.  Lots of complements.  Great price
5.0,"Like it, very pretty. Just to big for an event I needed it for. Ordered xs but guess I accidentally ordered large."
5.0,Got this for my nephew and it’s so cute!!!!!
5.0,I was worried because the size is bigger than I thought but when I put it on it fit great. I have room to move around and it looks good. It may run small for other people.
5.0,Like everything about them
5.0,The color red is deep and not cheap looking. They are soft and comfy bend with your foot but keeps its shape. Lovely boot it is. Not certain of the size as the seller contacted me and asked me what size I usually wear and adjusted them accordingly...I have plenty of room for winter socks.
5.0,I Always purchase this bad ass pants they are super comfortable I love them and I will always keep buying them thank you .....
5.0,I like the style a lot and have worn the ring many times.
5.0,I bought this for my Asus Zenwatch 2. It arrived on time and as described. Installed it in less than 2 minutes and it fits perfect on my rather large wrist. I like it so much that I'm going to purchase one of the silver colored bands to have some variety.<br /><br />Anyone looking for a band that fits a large wrist should buy this.
5.0,"Great sturdy hand made wand, very magical"
5.0,"I really like these straps. I bought the special edition FitBit with a cloth strap because my skin is sensitive to the silicone strap. The one it came with I got diesel on and I couldn't get it clean enough to where it didn't stink. I bought these as a replacement and they are great. They fit comfortably, and are easy to remove. If you had a large hand they would be cumbersome. The hook and loop (velcro) works very well. I will be purchasing more colors at some point."
5.0,I love these! Good quality cotton and double zippers make it easy for diaper changing.
5.0,Came in the mail early. The rope is well made and the lapis Lazuli crystal is beautiful.
5.0,Just like the picture. Wore it with my Mardi Gras Costume and loved it!
5.0,"These earrings barely feel like they are there! I love how light and flowy they are. The strings can crease a bit but with a little light steaming, they even out nicely."
5.0,This jacket is really really warm
5.0,"I love these, very easy to use and wear. Vary stylish as far as hair nets go."
5.0,"I'd rate it lower if I could..I loved the band but it broke within 2 days of wearing it!!<br />UPDATE: This company sent me an email after reading my review, they were very nice and sent me a new watch band..keep in mind, I didn't contract them, they contracted me!! I've had no trouble with the new band and u couldn't be happier! Thanks again!!"
5.0,They are very well made and the width is just right -- not tight.  Easy to slip on and comfortable to wear.  This style is the first I've encountered to wear well.
5.0,"Beautiful colorful beads, with a modern design. So light and comfy."
5.0,Awesome product make sure it stays on and shoes underwater for best results
5.0,Love these earrings. Quality material and so cute.
5.0,Good quality and match with the photos!<br />Awesome for the price!
5.0,"I bought the 2X because I am heavy up top. I am 5'2&#34; so I was worried about the length. They are a little long, but with heels, its PERFECT!!"
5.0,"This Tutu is gorgeous in person. I love it and so does my daughter! She doesn’t want to take it off!<br />If you’re on the fence just buy it, you won’t be disappointed. It kinda had a weird (new) smell when first opened but washed twice on delicate cycle/ hand wash and air tossed in dryer was perfect. Daughter is in between sizes 3T/4T and we purchased the 4T/5T size and it was perfect. Very happy with our purchase 💓"
5.0,It looks just like it’s pictured in the ad. Big but not too big. I can carry a water bottle if I need to etc... nice cross body purse
5.0,Fun and fashionable.
5.0,Cute and inexpensive. Chain and clasp are good and secure. Great for a young teen.
5.0,Very nice garment bad.  Well build.
5.0,I am now able to go out and walk without pain from my neuropathy with these comfortable shoes.  If they had more colors I would order more.  Great fit and extremely comfortable.

5.0,Better than I expected for the price. I appreciate the feeling of well made socks and these surprised me.
5.0,"I am short (only 4'11) so it came to about mid calf on me. I could have it hemmed if needed. The dress itself is super comfortable, soft and flowy. I definitely recommend"
5.0,Nice inexpensive option for a recreational gymnast.
5.0,Great hat for a guy for Halloween party won 2nd place.
5.0,Super cute.  Loose fit.
5.0,Very happy with these socks—nice level of compression  Can’t speak to durability yet.
5.0,Sirve para guardar tanto los lápices como el maquillaje.... justo lo que buscaba
5.0,"I love it Buetiful fit , come on time., Buetiful color , exactly as on the site I’m more than pleased"
5.0,"Super cute bikini bottom. Sexy and flattering without being too showy or skimpy. Keep in mind though that these aren't very strechy and run a bit small. If it's any help, I'm a 35&#34; in hips and weigh about 115. I typically swear small in bottoms but had to order a medium. I'd suggest ordering a size or two up from your typical bottom size."
5.0,Great material and fabulous look.
5.0,"I've gotten 4 of these hoodies so far, being a larger guy, they fit comfortably for me in the 4x range, and seem quite durable.<br /><br />I plan on getting a 5th so i have 1 for every day of the workweek."
5.0,"Usually I wear small size but I ordered M, it sits loosely,but I like how it sits on me."
5.0,Bought this for my grandson. Love it .
5.0,"This may seem like a boring, plain tee shirt... and in some respects it is: but that is why I really like it. A solid color, V neck tee shirt that is fitted near the waist and fits perfectly at the bust. The material is soft, and it goes with anything from a pair of shorts or jeans, or with a pair of pants and a nice blazer for a comfortable, classic look that dresses you up enough for the office but keeps you comfortable all day long.<br />Now I was able to get this shirt at a lower price in exchange for my honest review.  A lot of companies do this it seems, to get the word out about their products. It's terrific to discover a tee shirt that is comfortable and will last a long time! I have this type of tee shirt in my closet in in no less than 10 colors to mix and match with all my pants, jeans and shorts. This one is a welcome addition to my closet for sure.And at prices like this, I will buy more at full price. I made the pic in black and white so you can picture it in any color in your closet."
5.0,I love it fits good just too long but that's ok though. My family loves it
5.0,I love it! Fits perfect ! Used little tool provided to take out extra links;  watched you tube video and it was very easy to do.<br />It looks beautiful! Getting a lot of compliments. Overall very happy with my purchase. Highly recommend!
5.0,My boyfriend loved it! Great fit as he has a small head.
5.0,"Like the colors, was a bit confusing to put on as it wasn't a samsumg product, but it worked."
5.0,They are the perfect size I wanted a pair not to big.
5.0,A must have for any Harley Quinn fan!!! Very comfortable!!
5.0,"It pretty much looks like the photo and arrived right on time.  The blue is a little darker and looks black in less than bright light, but it's pretty nonetheless.<br />Edit:  It is actually color changing, with body heat. That's info that isn't in the description. It changes from dark blue to bright green and then bright blue.  Extra nice!"
5.0,"I bought two of these rings to put on either side of my engagement ring. They look perfect with my platinum ring and for such an outstanding price!!! Also, I received the package only four days after the order. I have since bought other items from SabrinaSilver and they are all great."
5.0,Gets darker with time but holding up fine
5.0,My wife needed red straps for her Lindsay Phillips shoes. She was very happy with what I found.
5.0,5ft4in 165lbs..fit wonderfully.  Washed once and it looks just like it did when I took it out the box!
5.0,Received tons of compliments on it.
5.0,I use this as a workout top and have received so many compliments on it! Kind of runs small size up one size
5.0,Perfect for travel and running around town on Saturday mornings! Love the color too.
5.0,It's a good watch.
5.0,"i have been looking for a real cotton hat all winter. When I first looked at the color choices, I realized it was made for men.  I am a women but I have a large head so the size was what I needed. The colors were, well, manly colors until I saw the pink! Love this hat! Only negative is, I wish you made one a tad thicker."
5.0,"Beautiful, well made and fits a large chest well! Fits perfectly on 5’7, 130lbs and D chest size."
5.0,Love it. Gave many as gifts

5.0,buy this
5.0,Haven't used it yet because it is for a June wedding...perfect match for the dress and just the right size. ...and a reasonable price.
5.0,very very comfy and washes well
5.0,I love this bag!<br />Size is perfect fits underneath my arm perfectly.
5.0,"I was a bit skeptical about ordering this top because of the lack of reviews and the price (50%off?!?!) but I figured if it wasn't what I had hoped it to be, I was only out less than $10. So glad I took the chance! This too is lovely, well cut and stitched and feels really good on. The fabric has a swing to it and fits true to size. So soft too. The length is great, can easily be worn with leggings as it covers the bottom well. And being 5'11, that's a rarity for me! Came back and ordered a different color!"
5.0,I bought these for my Son and he loves them. He wears them everyday in the house and sometimes on the porch. They arrived as promised and packaged properly so there was no damage. Shoes are made good no defects. The sole are study and flexible. Overall a good product and value.He was very happy I bought these for his birthday.
5.0,These are great glasses.  I use them mostly at night as they do a good job cutting the glare from on-coming traffic.
5.0,"Excelente, la tela, diseño, muy cómoda y ajustable, cubre la cara como muestra la foto"
5.0,The material was soft and comfortable.  I typically get XL and they fit but these were a tad snug.
5.0,"She loved it.  Have no idea how to check for authenticity, but came in a Coach box (I requested gift wrap for $3.99) and came with a price tag and care instructions.  Overall, quality looks on point, however, as I said, no idea how to check that it is authentic Coach."
5.0,My husband loves it!  Nice and smooth in the pocket.
5.0,Fit my son just right and looked just like the picture!
5.0,Kids like it alot
5.0,"This cardigan was just perfect for me!  It's cropped to just the right length to where it's not a bolero, but doesn't come down past my waist so i can wear it perfectly with skirts or dresses.  Always a little skeptical as someone who is around a size 24 with trying to buy clothes on Amazon, but this was a total success and I can't wait to buy it in a thousand other colors."
5.0,"These are perfect . Bout these to match my royal blue Jordan 1’s and I love them ! I am 5’9 , 155lbs and I got a large. After a few washes they will shrink, so keep that in mind."
5.0,Happpy with purchase.
5.0,"they are very light (what i wanted) they are just a shell, they appear to be water proof as advertised, i encountered some serious cold wind and they took most of the bite out of it theyve seen about 20 miles so far though nothing really harsh just trails no real bush whacking but so far they fit the bill well and dont break the bank"
5.0,Nice Quality chain and pendant! Very satisfied with this purchase!
5.0,They are perfect just get one size bigger they run a little small
5.0,"I actually ordered the silver, but the gold is gorgeous! Very well made and has some heft, if you're looking for a nice, sturdy pin."
5.0,Loved the material. Very good quality. I got compliments in Munich.
5.0,Love the styles and beautiful colors and the fit is perfect.
5.0,I bought it for my friend and she like it. The small size is great for  around 118lb & 6.3in(My friend's size). It is certainly worthy of your money. You pay only $33 to get a great product.
5.0,"Perfect hiking gloves, nice and durable for alpine scrambling!"
5.0,"The hoodie is soft and warm. The inside is fuzzy and generates some lint. I got the pink color and it's the kind of faint pink I hoped for. Looks great with a pair of jeans. Stitching isn't completely in line, but I've seen worse. There are obvious stitches sticking out, but overall an okay generic hoodie. I am average height and slim build. The small fits perfectly. I'm usually a women's medium and the small was snug so if you want more room size up. TIP: Make sure you keep a lint roller around and you should be good."
5.0,"Great long tunic to wear with leggings! Very comfortable, can dress up or more casual. Love the print!"
5.0,"If your wonder how boss you'll be in the kitchen cooking BACON with these bad boys, Look no further."
5.0,"Great leggings, 5'7"" 112lbs got size small and fit perfectly, flexible don't ride up or down. Nice pattern with mesh detail on the sides, look good and very comfortable. Can't beat the price for the quality. The fabric is not see through (except the mesh), definitely recommend."
5.0,My son really love this backpack! Lot space for all his books and stuff!
5.0,I like the items well and they are breathable
5.0,Great dress that can be used for all occasions
5.0,Allot of Very cool pieces
5.0,"This purse is beautiful!  It's prettier in person than in the photo.  I purchased the plum and the color is lovely.  It's roomy and the material seems to be of good quality.  I specifically like that there is no open compartment on the top of the bag, but both pouches zip close - keeps someone from reaching into your purse or you from spilling something out of it.  Would definitely purchase again!"
5.0,I really like color and flexibility of the band very casual and or sporty looking
5.0,Not appropriate for kids
5.0,"These were everything that I had wished for.  Fit is right on and driving is actually a joy now without dealing with my sweaty hands.  Finally, the quality of the product is spot on."
5.0,Super comfortable. I bought when I was pregnant and still using it 10 months after baby. I love the material and would happily purchase more of these.
5.0,Didn’t come how it looked but necklace is good
5.0,Great deal on diamondbacks shirt
5.0,I bought this ourselves a gift for my mom for Xmas. It looks to be in great shape. I enjoy the purple color and all of the pockets.
5.0,Exactly as shown in povture
5.0,"Looks amazing, super comfortable. The lenses are great and perform just as well as my polarized Oakely's."
5.0,They are so cute.  Exactly what i wanted ❤
5.0,Just what I wanted in a dress summer shoe!
5.0,"Love it, didn't realize at first that it had to be screwed on but working good. Again, love it"
5.0,Nephew loved these jammies!
5.0,"Fit great! I probably would go a size up for myself because I am 6 months pregnant to allow the wrap to go all the way around my waist, but honestly it was perfect! I also loved the V-neckline the wrap created in the front<br /><br />Very comfortable, and super cute!!"
5.0,"Following cataract surgery, I found it difficult to drive at night.  I purchased these glasses with hope in mind to assist with this problem.  I wore them recently as a passenger and believe they will serve as a deterrent to giving me clearer vision driving at night.  Another plus.  I have actually been wearing these glasses often during the daytime as well.  In Hawaii, our outside viewing is always green and very colorful.  These glasses enhance the colors, actually enhance my distance vision in reading road signs, etc.  For the surgery, I opted to use glasses only for reading.  So I don’t need glasses for distance.  But I often use these glasses for daytime outside vision.  I will consult with my opthamalogist about their use as such.  Overall, I’m very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Perfect fit for my son!
5.0,Loved it very nice Looking
5.0,AAA+++AAA+++good
5.0,Gorgeous and worth it
5.0,light weight and does not wrinkle but is great for cool evenings. Great to use if traveling.
5.0,As described! 5 Stars
5.0,"If you like it, buy them! I used them with my flat shoes"
5.0,"It wasn't a cheap feeling keychain. It was bought as a gift, and she really liked it. Worth it"
5.0,I bought these rain liners to see if it made a difference in how comfortable my rain boot would be.  The liners are made well.  They are slightly thick and warm which I like.  It made a dramatic difference wearing them with my rain boot.  My boot feels more comfortable than wearing regular socks.<br /><br />I liked them so much that I bought 2 more pairs.
5.0,"Smooth, clean, cheap, steel and Beautiful.<br />What more can you ask for?<br /><br />The price was great!<br />The shipping was fast!<br />I would re-order again!<br /><br />ONLY 1 downfall........I ordered 2 rings, shipped from the the same place, in the same package<br />but was charged $6 shipping per ring."
5.0,Nice fit and I have long thin fingers.
5.0,"As expected. Beautiful, rich color."
5.0,Wore these on my last hunting trip in my waders and they really did a nice job of keeping my feet warm. My waders are watertight so leaking wasn't an issue but temperature control definitely was and I sure appreciated having these. I won't be going out again without them.
5.0,I wear it every day!  I love the bracelet it makes me feel protected
5.0,"Perfect fit. I am a 38"" waist and it fit just right. Looks great too ;)"
5.0,Great for my long skinny grandson..
5.0,I love this sweater. The material is good. Very classy looking.
5.0,Very soft and comfortable yoga pants! Breathable and not see through! :)
5.0,"This hood, mask, & hat is amazing for winters in Wisconsin! There has been -20° for the past few weeks and when I did have to take my child out with me she was the warmest of all of us and she has a built in mask so she can’t forget her mask at home. 10/10 would recommend for the harsh cold days 🥶"
5.0,"I have been using this grease container for my kitchen for a few months now. I use it regularly, maybe 3-4 times a week. This is a great product. Here are my observations.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The strainer never gave me problems. It's attached well and filters well.<br />- The container itself is good quality, even oil straight out of the fryer never warped or damaged it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The holding tray that it has sometimes sticks to the container when I pick it up. It's due to the oil that drips off and catches in the tray. Maybe have the ridges a bit higher so it doesn't create a seal, causing for the pickup."
5.0,The mask is made of quality material and did not Shrink when washed.  It is designed so that you can insert a filter.
5.0,Bought to keep sun off me when mowing as these were sterile no advertising on them<br />I wear lg but got medium and it’s perfect fit without being baggy<br />Sleeves long enough to rest on hands without 2-3 inches extra fabric<br />Also had various colors to choose from<br />Soft and light pulls sweat off you
5.0,"this is probably my most favorite trianing top - it has great upper support but not pressing on the shoulders, flattering, long enough to be comfortable.  just awesome."
5.0,It looks great and fits perfect and was delivered in no time
5.0,"I absolutely am in love with this bracelet!!! My husband bought this for me for Mother's Day to represent my sons birthday and I can't say enough how much I love it!!! It's just beautiful, colorful and ove been complemented on it."
5.0,impressive
5.0,This hat and neck warmer is quality! Looks great as well as keeps me warm!  Highly recommend!
5.0,"I love these as well do my lobes.<br />I wish they came with plugs but, no big deal.<br />They gradually stretch to the next size and the all the sizes are accurate. :)"
5.0,"Not only is this cute for my motorcycle key, but it’s not even effected by the weather! It’s been through rain, dropped in the mud and you can wash it and it’s still as bright as when I bought it."
5.0,They're great! My son loves them!!
5.0,This is my 2nd time ordering this brand and I love the quality/ comfortable fit as described.
5.0,Love it!! It’s a bit large at the bottom when zipped up but I still love it. May have it altered. Worth the price
5.0,I am so happy with this suit. It looks just as advertised.  It fits well. High quality. It washes well. The color is vibrant.
5.0,The quality is amazing.
5.0,"Well made, had hoped it was a bit longer but it did the job! Great price."
5.0,"Keychain arrived quickly and on schedule.  It came in a nice box and the key holder was made of quality materials.  It exceeded my expectations.  I especially like the detachable key holder, and ability to attach it to my purse or luggage.  Very pleased!!!"
5.0,Ordered this for my sons 10th birthday. He is a big fan. The quality of the sweatshirt is on par with anything you would find in a store. The graphic is crisp and clear and looks exactly as advertised. He loves it.
5.0,I love it is very comfortable and very breathable which is amazing
5.0,"Awesome concept.  I won’t be going back to traditional lighters.  After 50 lights, it still has 4 of the 5 bars.  So far, we’ve used it on birthday candles, a propane fire pit, and  a propane grill and it works great on all, whether windy or not."
5.0,This fits well and is made well! It is comfy and fashionable.
5.0,Bought for my dad. He loves them they do the job!
5.0,"Although the dress size small, fit was too large for my daughter, she loved the dress. We needed to return because she really needs an XS. The seller responded very quickly and was GREAT about returning the item! Great customer service!!"
5.0,"Great little robe for me. It does have pockets, and this is a lot more attractive than my plush robe. Good for summer weather."
5.0,"What planet is this reviewer on? There’s a reason this bag retails for $415-465 depending on the size. I have the Isabella tote; the leather is gorgeous, raw, cowhide leather and it even smells beautiful (like good quality leather should). Stunning bag. Check out reviews on rent the runway or similar- or go to Bloomingdales and check it out in person. Better quality than similar designers in the same price range. I have seen this bag in a few colors, the red being my favorite, which I own. Absolutely beautiful quality purse."
5.0,Adorable and easy to pack. Just what I needed for my beach vacation!
5.0,Familiar with this brand is consist quality and fit and happy that Russell has kept quality high and price controlled.  This happy customer will be returning again.
5.0,"This product is amazing, I wear it around the house while I am cleaning and it helps me sweat. I also like to wear it when I workout. I just had a baby 5 months ago and I am trying to get rid of stubborn baby fat. I’m definitely seeing results with this sweat band."
5.0,"I'm around a 40D, I did not have high expectations when I first ordered this product, but for the price I was willing to throw caution to the wind. I was pleasantly surprised by how this product delivered on its promises. Does take a little practice to get on right. I found it easiest to cup my breast into the position it would ideally be squished into before applying the bra. That works pretty well. Note that the circle without sticky in the middle is not at all where my nipples ended up. As long as your nipple ends up behind the very tip of the bra (where the clasp is) it won't be visible.  It does lose its stickiness over time, but I figure you could probably get about 7 uses out of it. For 7 bucks that's a damn good deal. Will definitely be making repeat purchase."
5.0,Perfect for my student government meetings.
5.0,Fits wonderfully I think I can deft wear it for occasions other than just as a costume
5.0,"I'm 5'5&#34;, 120-125 pounds, athletic build (not curvy at all), usually wear medium gym pants and 2-4 normal pants. I purchased the medium after reading the sellers size chart and reviews, but sent them back for a large. The length was awesome, hit just above the ankle bones. The waist band would have been fine if the elastic wasn't such a thick solid elastic. But it felt way too suffocating. Love the style... loose and flowy without too much fabric, and can go with basically everything in my closet. Hoping the large doesn't drag on the floor.<br /><br />Edit: The large is perfect, and isn't any longer than the medium."
5.0,"Cheap bag yes, but for 5.99 its a great buy! and a beautiful color :)"
5.0,Great works well
5.0,Nice Christmas gift!
5.0,"I am still one year later, very happy with this pair of sandals. my dog chews on them and they don't break into pieces. I still wear them almost everyday."
5.0,Excellent for cooler weather. Great !!
5.0,Perfect summer or vacation dress. I love that it is cotton and it hugs all the essential curves. Would definitely buy in other colors.
5.0,"Some people may not like how ""flimsy"" they are, but i love them. They're lightweight (and won't pull on your ears) - you almost forget they are there. Can wear all day comfortably. Pretty High-polished silver."
5.0,I wore this to a theme Great Gatsby party. It was perfect!
5.0,Do fairly good at keeping wind out of my eyes
5.0,"I love jewelry that is pretty without being expensive or gaudy.  This is a pretty piece that will go with just about anything from casual to dressy.  It arrived in a teal color box which is nice for gift giving.  The piece itself is actually a pretty substantial size without being too big.  It is not a tiny little piece.  The whole piece is silver plated, so it has a nice silver look and shine to it.  It has a nice weight to it without being too heavy.  It is well made and should be durable for years to come.  The heart and butterfly design are pretty and simple.<br />This is nice enough to give as a gift.  Though size wise this would probably be best for a tween or above.  I would opt for something smaller for younger children.<br /><br />I received this item at a free or reduced rate in exchange for my honest an unbiased review."
5.0,This is very pretty and fits great!
5.0,Fits perfectly. Nice band around too<br />Very soft<br />Cross cross in the back is very pretty very comfortable
5.0,Awesome low-key watch probably one of the most Dependable I've ever had
5.0,I bought these for two main reasons: to wear out to the pool on summer days and to sleep in. (Or wear around the house in the evening.) Light fabric is perfect for that. Great fit too. Couldn't be happier.
5.0,These are industrial or work type suspenders but they can be worn with any type of garment. Very durable and thick Construction.
5.0,This shirt first as expected.  This is the second short I have bought and definitely exceeded my expectations on every level!
5.0,Should of went a size larger. Had to resize it
5.0,It looks just as cute in person as it does in photos.
5.0,Got 2 of these for my daughters to go to monster jam. They worked out great and fit my 8 year olds perfect.
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this dress - I got it in black, and I truly believe it is the PERFECT LBD!!  Dress it up, or down or anything in between! You will NOT be disappointed.  The fabric is not to thick, but just the right texture.  I am truly happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, comfy LBD.  May purchase another one in another color, wish they offered more colors and patterns on this one; it's a keeper!"
5.0,es un poco grande pero son bellos
5.0,Con ganas de estrenarlas ya
5.0,"I bought this shirt to put a smile on my husband's face, he's been having a bad few days.  I usually wear size small and decided to try size small. It fit perfectly!  Right away I noticed how soft the material was and when I put it on I loved how stretchy the material is. Overall,  very worth the price. Not sure yet about washing and letters but I'll keep you guys posted. I'm pretty tall (5'10&#34;) and slim and this tshirt was just right.<br /><br />I received this product with a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,Love the quality of this bracelet! It's very heavy and the beads at the end are like an iridescent. I purchased this for my girl and she loves it! Will definitely purchase from this seller again.
5.0,Granddaughter loves them. Always has several pairs.
5.0,Wedding loved it
5.0,Great easy to use and very comfortable.  No water seepage.  It is easy to adjust.  I would spend so much time adjusting and readjusting my kids mask.  Adjust it once and it's done.  It's very clear and with a wide view range.  My boys love these masks.
5.0,Wonderful fit and compression is just right! Love the butterfly design. My girlfriend has some in pink. Perfect for after workout or upcoming plane ride to Kona!
5.0,"These are beautiful, but they just don't fit me well at all and do not want to stay on my fingers."
5.0,These leggings are so soft and comfortable! Completely opaque and flattering. And the price is unbeatable! Will definitely order more!
5.0,"I specifically ordered one size up on this blouse because I wanted something looser-fitting to go with slim pants. I normally wear a medium but opted for a large. I think the medium would have been fine overall, but the larger size gave me the look I was looking for in this particular shirt. The back side is longer, and the shirt is very comfortable, yet professional. If you consider the material, it IS see-through/sheer, so you'll need a cami under it, of course, so plan accordingly when purchasing this blouse."
5.0,Bags are large and very handy.  Grocers tend to over fill them.  Then they are to heavy to carry.
5.0,My Husband bought me these pants and I love these pants!  They definitely fit really small for it to be a comfortable fit.  I normally wear a size 4 or small and I bought a large in these.  I want them in every design and I color!!
5.0,"I love love love this bag!! I get so many compliments and it works with most I've my outfits when I go out. The only flaw is I wish the strap could go across your chest, but it barely goes on your shoulder comfortably, which sucks!! I had to omit the strap all together, but aside from that it really is a great bag. Will post bag soon"
5.0,You old and tarnished jewelry will look new with this polishing cloth. I am satisfied with the quality of this cloth.
5.0,I am not a teacher but I wore this on the first day that my kids went back to school and it was a hit. It fit well. It's soft and comfortable on. Well made. Great for a gift
5.0,I'm big into norse mythology so it's great to tell the story about ragnarok and how Thor saved middle earth by killing Yurmungandur  (the dragon).<br /><br />I wish it was double sided but it does a good job.
5.0,Very good feel of the T-shirt. Loved the universal grey color to match any bottom. Fits very well.
5.0,So soft. My daughter loves it.
5.0,"Got then for my geeky husband as an early Christmas present and HE LOVED THEM! Great, soft feel and the colors are just perfect- not too scandalous, not too boring- honestly he's been rocking then with suit pants and just look AWESOME!"
5.0,This is a nice breathable workout shirt. I’m 5’10 150lbs I went with a medium. Probably could’ve gone with a small. Overall I would purchase again

5.0,was the right product our Dr Recommended we Get
5.0,Beautiful fabric and quality
5.0,"This is a fun set. We like it very much. Why?<br /><br />1) Super soft inside and out<br />2) Very cute - a fun addition to any outfit<br />3) Would make a great gift<br />4) Durable, well constructed<br />5) Booties are very cute but uncertain how well they would stay on, very loose"
5.0,"Follow the sizing provided in the size description. I love the look of this corset. I bought it as a base to glue stuff to for a costume, but when I put it on I liked the look of it so much that I’m keeping it as is. It’s the first corset that I just wanna wear out. The color and pattern is beautiful. The strings are actually decent. I usually buy paracord to replace what comes stock, but these are fine. I plan to replace the boning with higher quality spring steel. This is something I do with all my favorite cheap corsets to make them last longer. Not necessary unless you’re curvy."
5.0,Material and fit are great!!
5.0,"Love my new slippers. They are the most comfortable slipper I have ever had. My feet swell because of gout and once I put them on the warmth helps get the swelling to go down because they are so well fitting. Even after washing. I do let them room dry I do not put them in the dryer. Of course this means I need a second pair... THEY ARE GREAT!!! and they don't cost a bundle. I usually pay 10 times as much for slippers that won't even go on my feet once they swell, but these Kissxioya slippers stretched but did not lose it's shape or size."
5.0,Very sexy and love how it fits and looks
5.0,Love these headbands! They are so cute and soft! Easy to clean! I just stuck them in the washer/dryer.
5.0,"The watch is very nice, it doesn't looks cheap, good material,best way to wear it, with a bracelet and Voila looks great. I recommend it."
5.0,"Quick ship, very nice."
5.0,Very nice. Great gift for boys or girls.
5.0,I bought 4 necklaces and they all were delivered perfect. Shipping did take a couple weeks though.
5.0,Love the deep pockets and it's light weight and soft
5.0,These are great looking shorts. They stretch a bit but run on the tight side
5.0,"These were a gift. They were received today and my friend was very happy and pleased , as i was sure he would be."
5.0,Great hat! Worth the money.
5.0,"It's great, my boyfriends son loves this bathing suit and I love how its a two piece. The shirt really protects his light skin from the sun."
5.0,Toasty warm and cozy.I would buy them again.
5.0,"Nice product, good seller."
5.0,Washes well and can be worn casually or dressed up. I wear with just a sports bra underneath or a sparkly tank.
5.0,Great glass. Bought a pair and loved it!! Best cheapest sun glass.
5.0,Used for pictures....Adorable
5.0,I absolutely love this dress! It’s comfortable and well made. I love the bodice and the sleeves.  Very bohemian.  One of my “go to” for a summer party
5.0,"I love this shirt, it was a hit at Daytona Beach Bike Week."
5.0,"Packed very carefully, nice job, and it arrived in just 4 days despite being told it would take 9-14 days.  Colors are as vivid as the picture shows.  Soft and unstructured with no reinforcement in the crown which is my preference.  This purchase is for a woman --  I like the bill curved more, so doing that and adjusting the strap tighter makes it work for me--- my head is 7 3/8 in. which is larger than most women I know.  It's a keeper for the cool tie dye colors and great price."
5.0,"After I went to see ""Rocketman"" in the theaters, I was on the lookout for some funky sunglasses to wear this summer. These are exactly what I wanted: aviator-style, bright colored, and large for my small face. I've always been partial to 'rose colored glasses' but for those who aren't used to seeing a pink world, the bottom half gives you a golden color when you look down.<br />My only warning on these is the very thin gold frame. The case these come in is very pretty, but I won't be using it. I have a feeling opening and closing them will be hard on the little hinges. These are too pretty, and I wouldn't want them to break. I've always been in the habit of storing my sunglasses open, so I can grab and go, so this won't be a hardship for me."
5.0,"Very cute, true to size. Material solft, very light."
5.0,Pretty ... But see thru also ... I will wear it with leggings
5.0,Very well made sock...the graphic speaks for itself...just a great idea design
5.0,very helpful! great idea.
5.0,Bought for my mother she loved it
5.0,"Awesome beanie! It's great for cool/mild weather, and I've even worn it on hot days."
5.0,Bent over to tie my shoes like a man in these things! Amazing!
5.0,"Great outdoor pants, super comfortable, very cool, dry fast. Will buy again."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for.  I like that it is not one of those stretchy bracelets.
5.0,Excellent bracelets! Top of the line quality and look really nice. Even the packaging came in really nice. Definitely worth getting.
5.0,"love the fit.  super soft, I get compliments all the time.  true to size"
5.0,"FINALLY. An anti-fog product that lasts longer than a few hours. I don't wear regular glasses, but I wear close-fitting sports sunglasses. Really easy to fog them up even without wearing a mask. This product works well. It lasts about 3 days, tops, before requiring new application. Love it."
5.0,Exactly what we needed - fits the Alta perfectly.
5.0,It's very pretty and classy and under $30. Makes a nice gift.
5.0,Other slippers have always been just a little too small or a little too large and slipped off.  These are so easy and comfortable to walk in.  They also look nice which is important too.
5.0,Very nice quality. Order your true size
5.0,Very good item.
5.0,My fav hat!
5.0,Love them for just right💯❤️🤗
5.0,Perfect 70th Birthday gift. Made a big hit at the party!!
5.0,Liked the pattern
5.0,Love my new Prada glasses!!! This Is my second pair and by far the best🌺
5.0,Nice comfortable play outfit.
5.0,Gave it as a gift they loved it
5.0,"Love these! They are very lightweight and the colors are great for everyday wear, especially fall!"
5.0,I bought the matching backpack 2 years ago and I finally found the wallet by surprise! It’s super sturdy and the texture and quality are great! It’s one of my favorite wallets ever! It’s been holding up now for months.
5.0,I like the way it hangs and flatters.
5.0,"It comes with ear and nose plugs, my kids and their swim teacher loves these! What I love most about these is that they are easy to adjust and stay in place once audited, also the kids see able to put them on themselves because it has a very easy snap to put it on and take it off, really nice product, I’m very happy with my purchase"
5.0,I ordered this top in a size bigger than I would normally wear because it runs small and I am glad I did because it fits perfectly. I love it!
5.0,"I really love this mask. The filter pocket is secure and comfortable, which isn’t the case with several other gaiter masks I have."
5.0,"These earrings are gorgeous. I expected them to be made out of cloth but they’re actually plastic. Other than that, they’re definitely a good purchase."
5.0,"Was a gift for my daughter , she loves it . fits great !"
5.0,"Fits well, would probably go a size up if i could"
5.0,"Love the design of this, the two equal sides, how you can see everything. You can fit a LOT--as much as in the osprey farpoint 40--with much better organization. Really my favorite pack for the packing organization. Sadly I found it not super comfortable to wear, in part because I am 5' 8&#34; tall/long torso. My petite mother, 5' 3&#34;, purchased it from me and it's perfect for her."
5.0,"I Love This Necklace!!  The Base is Made of Beautiful, Loving Rose Quartz Which Emits a Powerful, Balancing Energy.  The Supporting Stones, Representing The 7 Chakras Are Also Very Beautiful and Grounding. The Stainless Steel Necklace Is The Perfect Length On Me, Touching The Heart Chakra.  A Perfect Combination To Wear. I Will Definitely Acquire More Pieces From This Collection!!"
5.0,"Lightweight, wash, dry and wear great.  I would purchase this brand again. Great value."
5.0,Perfect for my little girl!  good quality and comfy.
5.0,Wish I had bought two before they ran out. They are true to fit and  I love them
5.0,Adorable! Love this hat! I wore it to have tea and watch the royal wedding on TV with some friends and I felt every bit the part!
5.0,Have a set of twins. Bought one pair of boots from store. OIther twin loved ithem but store did not have another pair in her size. Amazon had the boots. Have two happy twins.
5.0,My daughter loves this hat.
5.0,Cute heart bracelet.<br />Good quality.
5.0,Lovely ring. My daughter loves it
5.0,"Cute,  sturdy,  great product"
5.0,"Very lightweight hat, good fit, nice for the beach and walks on hot days."
5.0,My granddaughter loved these mask. I like the disposable masks and my granddaughter loved tge adult  size butterfly masks.<br />We had several  options to choose from daily.
5.0,I have a largish head and was concerned about buying a hat off the internet. This hat fits perfectly and does a great job keeping the sun off my face and neck.
5.0,"My eyes are very sensitive to light - not day  blindness level, but it is hard to find glasses that are dark enough to help.  I have gone through all top end sunglasses, nothing compares to these, great super dark tint!"
5.0,Very good nice and small
5.0,Love the bag they come with and they fit perfectly!
5.0,Everything I wanted in a safety vest. I would buy again.
5.0,Bought this shirt for my girlfriend who have the same birthday month with me. We loved it😁
5.0,The ring is perfect. I love it and so does my fiancé. its just like one that you would get at Kay or some other jewelry store and it was only $25!! I have no complaints.
5.0,Wore this for my wedding and couldn’t have been more pleased! It fit perfectly and was very flattering. People couldn’t believe it when I said I got it on Amazon. The white satin was NOT see through at all. I also have this in another color.
5.0,"PERFECT! FINALLY!  I've been cursed with stubby legs, so one size does NOT fit all!  I have to roll the waistbands of my sleepers down like 8-15 times, or I trip all over them!  Not these!  And they've got Jack!"
5.0,"Cute A line above the knee rain coat that is lined and heavy enough to be worn in the winter here in the PNW. The buttons are snap type, no zipper. Great quality fabric."
5.0,Hehe I got this for my nephew. My brother is less amused but it is sooo cute and soft and actually very well made. I wasn't expecting this nice of quality from a novelty onesie.
5.0,The jacket is well worth the price and is amazing.  The sleeves are short so you may want to order a size bigger
5.0,"Looks great, but runs a bit large."
5.0,Le agrado mucho a mi hija y son resistentes
5.0,This was a gift.  It was well received.
5.0,"I'm an amateur photographer who is out in all sorts of weather conditions.  I'm obsessed with shooting water, both ocean and river, so getting into a river or surf is essential for getting the images I want.  These socks keep my feet warm whether I'm wearing water sandals or high rubber boots.  They DO NOT keep your feet dry, but work like a wet suit, allowing water inside the sock that is warmed by your body temp.  I can stand in 50 degree ocean water for 2 hours with these socks.  Without them, I've had close calls with extremely painful cold feet after 30 minutes.  My only complaint is that they dry quite slowly, but I'm not knocking off a star for that.  Instead, I'm getting two more pair!!!!"
5.0,really detailed. sparkles beautifully
5.0,"These are great leggings, I really like the set. Great customer service as well!"
5.0,This band meet all my expectations!!! Very happy with my purchase.
5.0,I followed the sizing chart and ordered the XXXL (which was a huge blow to the ego.. I usually wear a large) but it fits perfect.  The cups are just the right fit for me (36DD).  Super cute!  I'm a little worried its not the best quality material but hopefully it holds together for a while!
5.0,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She wears it everyday.
5.0,So in love with this! Great quality!
5.0,"Great fit and the pink is a dusty rose.  Size large.  (Normally, size 8-10) I would say it runs a little small and snug."
5.0,The picture represents the color and quality well
5.0,Perfect fit and so classy. It may look simple on here but once on it looks so nice and expensive. Definitely recommend.
5.0,These tiny hoops are exactly what I wanted. These do not irritate my sensitive ears. Easy to sleep in and the clasp holds tight.
5.0,This tshirt is beyond awesome.  My son absolutely loves it!  The quality is actually really good!!
5.0,"I recently gave myself this piercing so that’s why it looks irritated. I ordered this seeing as it was a shot in the dark because barely any reviews were posted and I knew little about the jewelry. Turns out, I really like it and my risk paid off. It’s the length of a common bobby-pin so it would be WAY too short for people with wide ears. Unless you already have a longer 14g barbell and can move the center piece to that one, i don’t recommend this. I have small ears so I just got lucky with this one. Other than that, it’s really pretty and seems like it’s got good quality. Keep the clear rubber piece in when you wear it so the tree doesn’t slide around. Hope this helped!"
5.0,Size very accurate vey good quality of picture
5.0,Very nice shirt.  As expected from Lands End
5.0,Very nice to work with thank you
5.0,"The shirt is well made- but it is a thicker material. From the photo it looked like it would be more flowy. Quite a boxy fit.<br />It is still a very cute top and I do plan on wearing it, but I am not in love with it."
5.0,"The material is soft, the lace is gorgeous and holds up like a champ in the washing machine and dryer. The color is vibrant and I get compliments all the time."
5.0,"Just received the watch today --  can't beat it as an add-on for less than $6.00.  Watched reviews on you tube and this is an authentic Casio (holding the button near the seconds display for 3 seconds will produce the CASIO name on the screen and holding all three buttons down will display all the symbols that the watch uses).  Back of watch says made in Thailand and the front of the buckle says CASIO and the rear says CHINA.<br />Comes with instructions and warranty.  Very easy to set the time, date, and seconds.  Very thin and use the third hole on the strap (so it allows me to place one finger between the watch and my wrist.  I have other Casio watches (mostly solar atomic g-shocks) that are more expensive, but this watch is much smaller, accurate, and is worth adding to my collection.  Should last for years, and if the strap breaks it's easier to replace the watch anyway.  It's a classic, so don't hesitate --  buy it!"
5.0,"Just as described, no tricks or suprises A+++"
5.0,Perfect. It came on time and as expected.
5.0,Nice pin.. I little pricey but well made and exactly what I wanted. I’m a happy customer.
5.0,"dad & our grand baby is well,  we all love it."
5.0,"I just received these in the mail this morning. They look just as they do in the pic, I feel they are a nice size for everyday wear, seem to be good quality and are comfortable when wearing them. Good price for a pair of sterling silver leverbacks with genuine stones. I will definately purchase more jewelry from this company."
5.0,It’s a beautiful swim suit.  It’s absolutely perfect.
5.0,"I love these earrings! I wear them a couple of times a week. Great size, not too heavy, good quality"
5.0,I purchased these for my granddaughters. They are solid and nicely made. I cant wait for them to open them on Christmas!
5.0,I love the easy to wear design.  Nothing to fasten. It looks expensive. I love it
5.0,"Exactly what I needed,"
5.0,My guests loved finding the one that fit their personality. Great quality & such a fun way to thank my guests for coming.
5.0,This wallet is fantastic! Best used for cards only as well as a phone with the right fit. Nice & soft with a many color availability. Have been the victim of identity theft years ago when the local PD said they had more important things to do than try to find someone who wanted to be me. It took me two years and probably a dozen signatures or more to convince the card companies that I didn't make all those purchases. Credit card companies are more on top of identity theft today but if you want to take better care of your own identity you should have one of these or one like it. I recommend them to all as well as use them faithfully. If you do use this one as a wristlet I would re-enforce the clasp for your wrist just to be on the safe side but that's me.
5.0,"I really liked the feel of this product! It's soft, weightless and when I put it on it felt like I wasn't wearing anything. It's stylish. I pretty much wear them year round especially on my bad hair days and it doesn't make my head feel weighed down. I wear it mostly as a slouchy hat and there isn't a difference if you are inside or outside...it still works and looks great! I recommend this product to anyone!!"
5.0,"Wish they would bring back this hat! I bought it at Costco, lost it, then replaced it here — and now I have to treat the replacement like gold, because I don’t know what I’ll ever do without it! I wear it all summer in the intense Texas sun, and it really keeps the sun off. The style looks good with both dresses and shorts/t-shirts — not overly fancy, not overly plain or sporty, just classic and clean. The chin strap has saved the hat from blowing off my head on many a windy day. I’ve had so many people see me and say “I need to get a hat like that!” Solar Escape, please bring back this style so more people can get this brilliant hat!"
5.0,For some reason the right shoe keeps turning on while I'm wearing them
5.0,"Great quality, fit, and comfort"
5.0,Nice quality and a very nice gift idea for a teacher!
5.0,"Light compression, but comfortable after 12 hrs. My ankles don't swell anymore."
5.0,I love the wallet it fits everything and the color I always get Compliment.
5.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my GrandDaughter. When I say Perfect, it was a PERFECT Fit !!! My GrandDaughter immediately performed a quick wash and wore that same night! No worries ! I purchased two of the same styles but different colors. She was Pleased."
5.0,I was recovering from ankle slip and this shoe nailed my requirement. I already use Wildcat from LaSportiva. This one is perfect when terrain is not that treacherous that I need to bring in my big Scarpa GTX Pro
5.0,"Color and fit as described, can wear high waisted or fold down. I’m just under 5’7” and 135 lbs, small for perfect. Very stretchy and comes to mid calf on my height. Squat and sweat proof!"
5.0,Great quality. My fingers are small and this looks makes them look lean and mean!
5.0,"This is a pretty bracelet that looks good on its own, or stacked with other bracelets.  Easy to put on and take off as well.  The seller was prompt in getting the package to me, and very courteous in contacting me to make sure I was pleased with my purchase.  I would recommend this seller."
5.0,These are so cute and I ordered them for my newly walking 15 month old. She will not keep socks or shoes on her feet and the floors at daycare and home are chilly. These fit great and do not fall off so she can walk around well in them. I wish I had bought a 2nd pair to keep at her daycare.
5.0,"I love this dress!!! It's survived several washed thus far. The material is a little slick but it makes it flare nicely and flutter ever so slightly in wind or while walking. It's not very breathable but I haven't been uncomfortable in it. In fact, it's very comfortable! I would still advise a slip under the dress though because it's not soft.<br />I'm size 14 US and got the XL and it fits perfectly. I have a bit of a muffin top that this dress hides well! Heehee~"
5.0,I absolutely love these! Looks perfect for my short hair look & have this boho vibe that I am loving. Would definitely purchase again!
5.0,"Great glasses, great service"
5.0,I really love this bra. It fits me perfectly. It comes with black and clear straps that are removable of course.
5.0,"I use these to deter my prisoners (I work as a teacher) from thinking I'm available to flirt with. It works. They don't last forever but they work for what I need and it's worth having to rebuy them. They're cute, though they get dirty easily but that's easily taken care of.<br /><br />Thanks for helping keep this woman from harassment."
5.0,I say fit as expected because I saw people stating that they run small so I went to a 3X when normally i am a 2X and they fit perfect! I so love these and in my favorite color combination of black & purple. Was going to buy more but saw 3X was now out of stock.
5.0,"The belt is rich in color and it fits perfectly. My son is always asked, where did you get that belt from? He receives so many compliments on the belt and you can wear it with a number of outfits."
5.0,Si satisfecha
5.0,"I ordered a medium and it fit well. I'm 5'4&#34;, 135 and busty.  It falls just at my knee. The lace was not itchy or otherwise uncomfortable. I ordered navy, and the color was nice.  Dress has a Mad Men feel."
5.0,"Great sun protection, no sunburn on my last vacation."
5.0,"Excellent quality, soft feel, light weight, and half the price of certain bigger “name brands”.  Great decision!"
5.0,"Like the gloves,  my size,7, fit exactly right,  not long fingers, exactly what  I need. Soft leather<br />100% satisfied"
5.0,This necklace is costume jewelry that is so much fun to wear. I bought it to &#34;glam&#34; up an outfit for a night out without having to worry about losing real jewels.
5.0,"This was a pretty good buy if you ask me, I love this. &#60;3 Now it cannot be worn as a necklace because the chain is TOO long and I think it might irritate your skin but you can wrap the chain around your wrist and it is quite the nice bracelet. The time is also a little hard to set but if you look inside it's pretty cool and all pretty even my own mother thought it was pretty cool. :)"
5.0,I absolutely love this watch! The color are beautiful. It works very well and love how comfortable it is to wear. Love having the date available as well.
5.0,"My first time buying jewelry on-line, I've always considered it too risky. My wife has had a very nice Mikimoto strand from a jewelry store, that she has has for 30+ years, and these are every bit as nice.  Very satisfied with the set."
5.0,"This bracelet was given to a friend and she thought it was beautiful. It didn't cost much, but looked like it cost more."
5.0,"Got these for my partner as a birthday present, They are heavy but that’s the only flaw. Love them and how they look."
5.0,Nicely designed  quality stitched good material cloth

5.0,"Perfect. My husband has trouble getting hats to fit. Find a sizing chart online and order accordingly, this was exactly the correct size."
5.0,"Purchased several of these for a family member after weight loss surgery. He liked them better than the Spanx brand, and these are a fraction of the cost."
5.0,I have a number of these bracelets and wear one almost every day! I’m a devout Catholic and it helps me to remember my faith.
5.0,Super cute. Good value
5.0,Fast Delivery! and great for attaching to knotted Rosary!..
5.0,I love these! I get compliments every time I wear them. Good quality but not too heavy for day wear.
5.0,My fiance is a restaurant manager who's always on the phone/laptop for work & likes to step outside to smoke while he does. I saw this & immediately got excited! He can now multitask with this beanie & winter is here so it's a win! He loves it & thinks it's bad ass! Lol The sound quality is actually amazing! I can hear him clearly like I would if he had the phone up to his face! It's also great for listening to his music/taking phone calls while he's putting away product in the child walk in cooler at work. Just purchased another one to give to my dad who's always cooking inside & outside now he can have his music on without the rest of us having to speak over it.
5.0,It’s comfy and easy for my son to put on
5.0,"Love the color, tent, and feel!"

5.0,"Bought this sock as part of my wedding tux outfit with the guys to show a little personality of us all. Sock wasn't too tight, felt good, not loose. And its a cool design and in some way, a part of my personality of what I like and or do."
5.0,I love it! Like just as pictures! Fits great and I like it so much for my classroom key
5.0,A great value. Tan strap with black bag is very versatile. Perfect size.
5.0,These boots are Beautiful!!!! The bomb
5.0,Very well built
5.0,Gift for my Girl
5.0,I love this so much I have it in two sizes! One to wear over pants for a beach casual look and a larger size to wear as a beach dress/ cover up.
5.0,"Amazing sweater, love it"
5.0,"nice.  bought it to have to give to the wife of 29 years when there was no special reason, gave it to her this weekend for no special reason. she was tickled. awesome surprise.  really glad I bought it"
5.0,"I really like this wallet.  I had searched for a compact, real leather RFID wallet with a zipper compartment for change for a long time but was disappointed with what I found until I found this attractive wallet.  There is plenty of room for cash and cards, and it is compact enough to fit easily into my small sling bag.  The divided zipper compartment is roomy, so I can carry change in one side and business cards in the other.  It is true that business cards are slightly too large to fit in the card slots, which is why I carry them in the zipper compartment. I was thrilled to not have to give up a dedicated ID window, so that I can find my ID without searching for it.  This wallet embodies everything I want in a leather wallet, with added RFID protection."
5.0,Bracelets small size a plus
5.0,"Excellent designs, comfort, and price. The pockets come in handy."
5.0,"This cardigan fits great and is very soft, lightweight and comfortable. It has plenty of give in the sleeves (I hate tight restrictive sleeves). It makes my regular tops look dressier for work."
5.0,Purchased this as a pinky ring and it’s perfect. The scrollwork is mesmerizing.
5.0,My Daughter bought this because I believe a she was a 90 year old lady in her last life.
5.0,"This is a super cute two piece ninja costume that my kid is really happy with! It’s lightweight and fits fine over other clothes, and really is perfect for little kids for dressing up! It’s best to hand wash I think, but it’s so light that it dries really fast.<br />My only minor concern is that the mask/head cover is a little on the tighter side, so my kid gets a little overwhelmed if he has it on for more than an hour. So maybe size up if you are worried about that. Otherwise it’s great!!"
5.0,"Perfect for my son, exactly what we expected."
5.0,"I purchase one for daughter and myself, the material is great along with the support. Great fit!!<br />I would highly recommend this swimsuit! Patterns are so nice."
5.0,I absolutely love these glasses!!! Great quality and fast delivery!
5.0,I like it. Fits a lot of cards for its size.
5.0,I'm full figured and it crawls when I walked. So if you have curves go up a size or make it a cute top with leggings.
5.0,I always wanted something that resembled Hawaii in jewelry and I found it! My search is over. It’s definitely beautiful. I even bought some other jewelry options that Sandytide has.
5.0,I'm 5'4 around 145lbs with 36C. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. The material feels excellent against my skin and I can move around without feeling like it's going to rip.
5.0,"I really like the look and feel of this bracelet. I can't believe I got it for such a low price!! Are they even making a profit? I'm about to order 2 more, one for me and one for my brother lol."
5.0,Great jacket really cute fits me great.
5.0,"I followed the size chart perfectly (I'm a US size 6, I ordered this in a large), and it fit perfectly. There were a few loose strings when this arrived, but otherwise, there were no issues. I got compliments from all my friends in this top (a rarity with my friends!). I am very happy with this purchase, and the price is right."
5.0,"I had a little issue with the chain part, it’s a little hard to adjust it to the right size for your arm but once on it was pretty sturdy. The design itself I feel is subtle.’you have to look at the watch on the sides to fully see the design or jewels. Which is why I tried to capture it on the pictures. It’s pretty comfortable once it is on.’however, I have a smaller wrist, and the remainder of the chain hung a little long. So if your a person who doesn’t like hanging chains that might be a problem for you. Overall it’s a great design for the watch and fits comfortably. It’s a hard metal so it is stiff on the arm. It’s a beautiful band"
5.0,a mi hijo le encantaron estan perfectas
5.0,"3 Pairs Teardrop Shaped Mother of Pearl, Simulated Onyx & Lapis Drop Earrings Set in Sterling Silver.  I wear these earrings regularly.  I was hesitant to make this purchase but have been pleasantly surprised.  The earring material does not look cheap.  If these were offered in other color choices I would definitely make the purchase."
5.0,I was a little worried that this would be a nock off but no this is the real merch and I am very happy with my purchase
5.0,"Great price, quality and quick delivery. Does it's job."
5.0,"These socks are great for hiking, and later on in the year for the snow. A nice design on the outside compliments the moisture wicking ability from the inside. My wife has already stole these from me"
5.0,"Just ordered a second necklace. It is simple and gorgeous! Natural color of dark hazel wood, no polish. Will go well with many things..."
5.0,"Great cap. Has a nice slouch, without being over-the-top. The inside is made of a very soft material that fits snug without feeling like its going to fall off, and without squeezing your brains out. These beanies are pretty durable as well. Been wearing mine almost everyday for the past several months and all the stitching is intact, and color still very vibrant.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend Z&S Slouchies to anyone who enjoys the look of a slouchy beanie.<br /><br />-<br />Nick"
5.0,The look and feel of the watch band is amazing and substantial. The quality is on-par with high end bands.<br /><br />I only docked a star because the band fell apart after a screw from a link got loose on its own. It was by the watch end so I didn't even touch those when I adjusted for the length. I suggest you tighten all the screws links prior to everyday use or you might suffer an expensive loss! Luckily mine broke at home and I was able to recover the pieces!
5.0,"Even though I could have went a size up, these boots are very warm. I don’t know if socks are supposed to be worn with these boots and that’s what makes them small. I wear socks only they have to be thin"
5.0,It was a great purchased.<br />I really love this product!
5.0,Got these gloves for my friend in time for winter.  He loves them.  Fits his large hands perfectly.  This is soft and not rigid. The lining is super soft and very comfortable.

5.0,Fits perfect per the size chart. Very soft and comfortable to wear. Love it
5.0,"I love this scarf. First it has cats-but in a somewhat subtle fashion-well sort of subtle. I like the material, it's soft, lightweight, but with some warmth.  I wasn't sure I'd like it, even if I do love cats. I don't usually wear cat things, but this is very comfortable. I've gotten compliments-from fellow cat lovers of course, and got one for a friend also."
5.0,I get many compliments when I wear this and everyone asks where I got it
5.0,I'm a size 4 and its loose but I love it. I just through it on over my head. People kept complimenting me on it. I highly recommend.
5.0,Longer than I expected but a good shirt
5.0,Bought this for my grandma. She liked it because the numbers are big and the face is simple so its easy to read. The watch itself looks classy and not as cheap as it does in the pictures
5.0,"I got this to wear on my wedding day, it is solid beautiful!!"
5.0,This is my favourite top EVER! SEEEXY
5.0,Great price compared to other options.  Use this on our 4-month old. She had terrible diaper rash and doc recommended to leave her diaper off.  But it's winter so I bought this to keep her legs warm.  These will also be useful during the change of seasons: dress your baby in shorts and t-shirt if it will be hot in the afternoon and put these on in the morning when it is still cool outside.
5.0,They look exactly like the picture. I just don't like how they look on my face shape. I have a heart shaped face.

5.0,These are the most comfortable pants I've ever owned.  I keep repurchasing
5.0,Fun. I bought them for a boy and they have some silver thread which makes them look slightly girly...but my son doesn't seem to mind. He loves the lights and he gets comments on them every time he wears them.
5.0,protects my glasses well.
5.0,"I love this dress.  The neck line is a bit plunging so a bralette is probably appropriate or no!  This dress is super flattering and doesn't drag on the ground.  I'm 5'2!  I wear a mostly small tops, sometimes medium.  And am a size 8.  The medium dress fit me perfectly!"
5.0,"This belt is magical, it goes with any kind of outfit I have on. No need to punch any holes  because it fits by the quarter inch."

5.0,"great price, looks great and i keep my phone makeup and money in here while cycling"
5.0,These are by far my favorite tummy control panties. They really hold you in and aren't too bulky. Elastic band is really durable.

5.0,I love this belt would defiantly buy again
5.0,"Love them, look great."

5.0,Great bowtie.  Used it for my wedding.  Highly recommend.
5.0,Love love love this dress. Fit as expected. I'm 5'2 and 135 approximately. Material is surprisingly thick (warm in the summer) but breathable so it's nice for a summer night out. Has a raised neck and makes shorter necklaces look misplaced but great piece for the price. Will order again!
5.0,Great pack use for the gym also very comfortable when riding a motorcycle
5.0,I absolutely love it! Love the stretchy material.
5.0,Love this! It's the most comfortable hoodie I've gotten in years.

5.0,"Not for the very tall person, but it is soft, comfy, I recieved several compliments on the dress I’m minutes of walking out the door"
5.0,"Love it once, Love it twice. I bought one a year ago so that's how long mine lasted before the rope started to come apart. I work as a Grocery Stocker so it held up pretty well for the kind of work I do. I love the quality and that it is very comfortable around my wrist. I also love how the magnet clasp holds it together nicely."
5.0,"I was looking for sunglasses large enough to protect that sensitive skin around the eyes, also wanted polarized and UV  protected.  These have it all and as an added bonus they are really sharp looking.  I will be getting them in other colors."
5.0,Dress fits and looks great! I’ve received many complements on it!
5.0,"It’s a swimsuit, very colorful & pretty. Fits perfectly, size 12, holds bulky areas in as described in advertisement.<br /> I like the straps on the back, unusual yet beautiful."
5.0,My husband is 6’3” and this shirt fit perfectly. Great quality and the colors are very nice.
5.0,I like these but wish I’d gotten a half size smaller.  Noticing a little stretch.
5.0,As described. New in bag tags attached. Quick service and turn around. Prime!
5.0,nice little gift
5.0,The earrings are lively and if a nice quality. The stones look very much like mined stones with delicate  black lacey lines.  The wires have finished ends and are easy to put in and take off.  The earrings look like high quality turquoise--at a great price.
5.0,"This is a Christmas present, but based on my holding it up ... it looks like it will fit as expected. I give this entire shopping experience  a 5 star rating."
5.0,"These are SO comfy and roomy, it doesn't feel like you're wearing pants at all. They are perfect. I am 5'4 192 lbs and they are just adorable."

5.0,My 14 month old actually kept them on her head and they really seemed to help. We bought them for an amusement park to help keep the loud noises from rides to a minimum. Definitely worth the money.
5.0,Matches picture
5.0,Lighter than I thought would be.
5.0,Perfect! It is exactly what I wanted!!!
5.0,I really like it so much I bought 2. They are very compressed so the second one I sized up even though the first one was ok. I just wanted a little more comfy fit.
5.0,I used this for a costume and the picture is accurate! Surprised by how comfortable they are.. I will be using these for more than my costume!
5.0,"I had a natural leather belt that was a little too light for my taste. After a few treatments of neatsfoot, its the perfect light brown."
5.0,If you have bigger cups go up a size and it will fit great.
5.0,Very comfortable what else can I say.
5.0,Awesome dress love the color and the style
5.0,I bought a medium because I wanted it more baggy with a bit of a wider neck. I like it!! Thick material so big win!
5.0,"didn't realize how large these were going to be, but I love them! they are very sparkly, a good eye catcher"
5.0,SPEW makes another stride towards elf equality. The socks fit well and keep House elf toes from getting to cold in the drafty castle kitchens.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter as a gift. She loves the fit and the beautiful spring colors
5.0,I loved the boot but wrong size was sent twice.p
5.0,Sweet people easy to work with great communication

5.0,"Love the way this vest fit. I brought this vest for my husband he was looking for something to wear when he worked out. The style of this vest was perfect, because it was easy to put on and take off do to the zipper in the front of the vest. This vest increased his sweat while working out with the sauna effect. The quality is good. I would  purchase again and recommend."
5.0,The elastic in the middle is the strongest of all the beaded bracelets I have. I love these so much!
5.0,Got these socks for my kids (ages 4 and 8) for flag day! They are perfect.
5.0,Comfy and good quality. Just be careful taking the metal clips out. They can damage your sock.
5.0,Gson love it@
5.0,This is so soft! I wasn’t expecting this wonderful quality for such a low price. I wanna go back and buy another one.
5.0,Excellent....!👍🏼👍🏼
5.0,Very nice. They work the right way
5.0,"Wow! What a pleasant surprise! Very cute, comfortable & surprisingly well made.  Checked each dress right out of the bag, no issue with straps or seams as reported by some consumers.<br />Top stretchy area of dress is not the best fitting if you have a larger chest (i'm a 38dd), it's not uncomfortable just unflattering.  Cute & casual, they make a great swimsuit coverup. I did go up a size, I wanted a billowy fit & was concerned there might be shrinkage when laundering.  Very happy with purchase, incredible price for 4 dresses!"
5.0,Super cute little outfit. I bought it for my 18 month old granddaughter and she looks adorable in it. She's on the tall and thin side so the pants are perfect but the top could have the straps tightened up a bit. I wish they were adjustable like bra straps. Otherwise it's cute and I would recommend it
5.0,"These socks are so cute!  Run just a tiny bit large in the foot, which is perfect for my size 10 feet."
5.0,Love this genuine Coach bag!
5.0,"Lovely necklace -- reflecting the tree of life. Beautifully made; striking -- have matching earrings. Get compliments every time I wear it. Gave one as a Christmas present, which was also well received."

5.0,love the quanity for the price
5.0,Christmas gift.  Took a while to figure out how it works.
5.0,This is a professional cape. Feels just like the shop cape. Must have.
5.0,This is the cutest mini bucket bag ever!!!  I purchased this bag in the blue or denim color.  I love the leather quality because the bag is study and will stand on its feet.  I love the color.  I love this bag!!  I will be buying this bag in black.  I just hope that it does not take as long as it did for me to receive this bag.  I highly recommend this cutie!
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress.. bought in 2 colors.. wish they have more options! 5'4, 145 lb the Large fits perfectly. Don't wash in hot water, it can shrink."

5.0,A nice fit and cute design

5.0,I get many compliment on this. Sturdy and well made
5.0,Son loved them! Great Back to the Future look....
5.0,"These do actually keep my glasses on my face. Easy to use, and I don't feel them behind my ears. Good product; recommended!"
5.0,Bought this for a friend and he loves it. It is well made and a great looking travel bag. The picture doesn't really show the details and the leather is so soft and the smell of the leather is great. Highly recommended this bag.
5.0,These were exactly what I was looking for and I got 3 for the price of what I would have paid for 1 at the store. Great value for the money
5.0,[[VIDEOID:828b1db49047eac94a2c63648f17916b]] It runs small so I sized up. I'm an XL and this is a 2xl. Very pretty and made well. Has a lining so it's not see-through. Beautiful lightweight top!
5.0,"I paid ~$50 for my Invicta Pro Diver watch on Amazon. It was delivered THE NEXT DAY after ordering, which astonished me. I opened the wrapper to find a very nice ""Invicta"" box (ugly yellow color!) with the watch inside. It started ""ticking"" immediately once I picked it up. I shook it a little to ""charge"" the automatic watch engine, and set the time. That takes me to commentary on the bracelet.<br /><br />The bracelet on the watch is different that bracelets I've had on my other watches. It's not complicated, but being new it quite stiff. The first few times I took it off took some effort, but it's much better now. That's my only beef with this remarkable little watch so far, the bracelet, and I think the bracelet is going to be great once it's broken in.<br /><br />As for timekeeping, I set it to my ""atomic clock"" at home and it's consistently stayed within 1 minute of the time on that clock since I first set it. I found it has a reliable Seiko engine, and I've found it to be very accurate, especially for a bargain automatic watch.<br /><br />Overall I'd rate this a 4+ star watch, but for the money it's better than 4 stars. Maybe I got lucky, but this watch is superb so far and I'm actually enjoying it a great deal."
5.0,I love these I don't know what more to say. But 1 size smaller than normal
5.0,Easy to use and hold tight
5.0,These are very durable glasses for the price. Made by smith so they are quality!
5.0,Great and fun to wear watch.
5.0,I love this mask it comfortable and fits. Perfectly not to mention it has the survey corp symbol WICH MAKES TEN TIMES BETTER I SWEAR I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND FOR EVERYONE READING THIS TO START WATCHING AOT AND OTHE ANIMES
5.0,"i was looking for economic glasses to help me when my eyes got tired.  I found these and love the colors they come in, the construction and fit are great.  Also, the added blue light blocking is so good and so needed by many that work on or live on a phone or computer."
5.0,I just purchased these boots for my nephew. They were shipped promptly. After reading other reviews on random rain boots I checked all seams and so forth. Boots were entirely intact and appear to be well made for the price.
5.0,Runs a bit big. Fits 38D /30/40 figure quite nicely. Cinch up side strings for sexy high hips. Comfortable soft fabric.
5.0,This is an excellent product which served it purpose. Be sure to carefully align the pushing tip to the watch band peg while turning because the tip will bend easily.
5.0,"It is a pretty nice hoodie, seems to wash well. I am 5’3” and 115lbs and got it in small - the sleeves and the hoodie itself are too long. I will be wearing it around the house. Other than that I like it."
5.0,I used it for a gift my husband and my son
5.0,"I love these tights for my 3 year old daughter!  She puts them on by herself, no issues going potty! They keep my princess who is determined to wear dresses all winter long warm and I love nonslip since we don’t have any carpet!"
5.0,This is my 4th one personally and I’ve also bought them for friends and family as gifts! These things rock!! The best belt I’ve ever had! The quality is absolutely amazing! I’ve had my first one for over 3 years without a single issue! Great product and great price! Highly recommend!
5.0,It runs a little big but very comfortable
5.0,Cool socks - nice quality. The motorcycles may stand out more if you order the blue.
5.0,Nice quality. Good for my niece who loves HP
5.0,Beautiful robe fits as described will likely be ordering another one soon.
5.0,"Excellent purse for what it is--a small purse.  Even though measurements are given, I thought it was going to be bigger, so returned it."
5.0,Great socks...I love them!
5.0,Sooo I always have a problem with ordering nipple rings and the bars being way too long and getting snagged on everything. These are simple & perfect! But if you have bigger nipples they might be too tight and be uncomfortable!
5.0,"If you need to toss on a formal outfit, this is a great addition to your attire.  I needed a white maxi skirt and blouse.  It was for a installation which we were all to wear white!  Thank you so much for an answer to my hopes and prayers.  The skirt is just beautiful."
5.0,"Super fast delivery. Packaging is very professional and nice. I think mine is a bit smaller than I wanted (16g, 4mm,3/8) but it will do. I think next time i will get just one size bigger (maybe I just have a big nose?). Anyway, LOVE IT!"
5.0,"I would re-buy this wallet a million times over again; I love it!  I ordered the Canyon Red color which has darkened as the product has become more broken in (which was anticipated when I chose the color so thats quite alright).  If you're on the fence about spending the money like I was, I would say take that leap.  With their lifetime warranty this is the last wallet you will ever need to buy!"
5.0,I love this dress I bought the dress for my son's wedding and everyone LOVED the way it fit my body. I would get this dress in a different color for my next wedding I have to attend.
5.0,Well worth it for all the smiles and laughs
5.0,"The fit, the color was on point. I decided to order two other colors. My daughter liked my jacket, so I ordered her one. 🙂"
5.0,These are really cute but they just didn't look good on me personally. The frames are nice and I had planned on using them for my prescription eyeglasses.
5.0,perfect for wearing backwards under a hard hat
5.0,I got these for my father he loves them he says they fit good and cut out the brightness.
5.0,"I'm 5'6'', 116Lbs and 34 A. S size was tight on the chest and hugged like a second skin. Exchanged with M and perfect fit. Not as tight and neck sits well. I love it. Fabric is not thick neither thin. Measurement chart reflect the true size. Please measure yourself and buy accordingly. I recommend it!"
5.0,Wasn't expecting this to be as cute as it was. It's a dress that's not too revealing but hugs the body in all the right places to leave a statement.
5.0,i ordered a large due to the stretchy material i wear a size 6/8 8/10 depending on the stretch and zipper or if it a pull over your head very happy will order again
5.0,"Great glasses, bought two pairs and have no regrets."
5.0,"I bought this for a Halloween costume (as the ""grown up and out of shape"" representation from the movie in the 70s).<br />Fit was good.<br />Lettering, piping, etc aren't sewn on, but are pressed on.  Still, I expected it to be printed on lettering and was pleasantly surprised to have the fell of sewn on lettering and logo."
5.0,Very comfortable nightgown.  Fits as expected.  Would buy again.
5.0,"My daughter loves it!  She will be able to wear it to sleep, or as an outfit to play in.  She was delighted by the cute cat designs."
5.0,"I am a woman and I bought these as well as another pair from a different maker. I bought two styles because I was worried these would be the wrong shape for my face, or that they were going to be too “masculine” looking. I was wrong! These are great! I have a small head and these are perfect for my face. They are reminiscent of the old 80s raybans. Stylish. These are so obviously made with love, and the price point is amazing given all the great additional accessories you get with your order. They come with a case, little postcard, lens cleaning cloth... and a cloth “case” as well. How in the world are they able to pull this off? You get so much more than just the glasses. Lastly, and most importantly... the bifocal is LOW ENOUGH down the lens that it’s not distracting! The other pair I got (different maker) is really pretty and stylish but it seems I won’t be able to wear them...because the bifocal is WAAAY too high up in my vision.<br /><br />Thanks Woodies!"
5.0,This watch was a Christmas gift fr om my husband. He knows I love watches and cats.
5.0,"The mask are very pretty and comfortable. Purchased for a wedding, the mask are very dressy. Loved them !"
5.0,Fits great. True to size. I wear a little belt around the waist for a little more definition.
5.0,"This wonderful coat is no longer offered by Filson even though it was one of their flagship designs and highly functional as well as good looking. As with all the original men’s  outfitters, from LL Bean, to Eddie Bauer, to Abercrombie, it is turning  into mainly a High end woman’s clothes catalog, with Men’s styles of interest mainly to those who ride about in Range Rivers or parade down 5th Avenue."
5.0,These were a big hit as a night time fundraiser for our local Relay for Life. Kids and adults loved them! Very bright!<br />The only downside is that the finger bands do come out easily. They are simple to put back in though.
5.0,This were for my granddaughter and they are adorable. Very good quality.
5.0,Great fit. Easy to get on.
5.0,nice thing
5.0,Quick and easy install despite some delivery issues with the common carriers and USPS. Great product. Thanks
5.0,"Finally, colored stopper beads that actually work!  The rubber ring inserts fit into the beads correctly, stay in place and keep the beads in place.  I've tried several other kinds of colored stopper beads, and these are the first ones that work."
5.0,My daughter told me I needed something to wear over my bathing suit.  She sent me this site so i ordered a navy blue in size medium.  I usually wear a a size 8 and a medium was a perfect fit.  It's something different than a cover up.  I have had a lot of compliments.  I would recommend this.  We live in Texas and we swim a lot.  It will be perfect when we go to Mexico.
5.0,"Very nice looking sport shirt, fits well"
5.0,I love the patterns and textures.
5.0,Big fan of merino wool. Super soft.
5.0,"I was a bit nervous on this product! Wasn’t sure it would be safe or would work, I’ve been using this for a month now it works well and has a good shock, my only complaint is that the wrist band is smaller, I have a big wrist so I can only latch on with one space to go, all in all I would suggest this to a friend"
5.0,"These have become my Husbands favorite socks. Number one is that he prefers Navy  blue socks, but he is really tickled with the &#34;Yellow Duckys&#34;<br />The Older we get, the sillier..."
5.0,This dress fit me like it was made for me. Im 5ft 1 and bought a small. I was excited that this dress fit so well. The quality met my expectation. Im about to buy 5 more of these dresses no joking. Because of my petite body size I can never find the perfect fitting dress until now... nice job Homeyee. Oh and the enclosed card was a nice touch
5.0,This skirt is amazing. It's very soft and looks great! Mine was a little big so I'm returning :( I am 5'3&#34; 100 lbs and the small was just a tiny bit big on me.
5.0,This dress fits perfectly
5.0,"The size is exactly what I wanted. Not too big,<br />not too small. The top has a vented strip around it, and there is a cord with a slide lock for under your chin that will help keep it from blowing off your head. The vail in back is more protection from sun and wind and the drape in front will help you stay incognito. A great boat hat. I like the lighter color style. I wiped mine down in a sink filled with water and laid it out in the form I wanted it to stay in. Spot on. The brim is wide enough to shade out over some of the top of your shoulders too. It's a nice light weight hat. Recommend."
5.0,Nylon Road Runner ID Bracelet.  I do a lot hiking and road walking alone so in case there was ever an issue or accident I wanted my basic information to be known to anyone.  This serves that purpose wonderfully.  The first Road Runner Bracelet I purchased lasted for seven years and the only reason I bought another one is because the information on the bracelet had changed.  Very well made and quick shipping.
5.0,Great quality!! Not cheap and thin feeling. Super cute!
5.0,"Such a unique setting, and it looks so beautiful on my finger! It’s well crafted, and I will most definitely be ordering more jewelry from them! Buy it, u won’t regret it!"

5.0,Ohhh Just like the Original game..And I can play anywhere!! So Adorable!!
5.0,"I really love these tees.<br />I bought 3 sizes—large, xl, and xxl—since size charts always seem wonky.<br />-For reference, I’m a curvy hourglass shape, 38C or 36D, weigh around 185 and usually wear sizes L or XL or even a xxl because I like my clothes loose and wear with leggings<br />-jeans I range from 12-16<br />-The large size was like a baby tee, a fitted look. Not long enough for leggings though<br />-the xl was the PERFECT fit, hugs you in ever right curve, and very flattering.<br />-the xxl was too big and I sent it back . It’s not one of those shirts that look good baggy, so do not size up.<br />These tops are suuuuper soft, they are really comfy to wear, hold up in the wash, and totally versatile. I’m buying them in like every color and print they have, I just love them!"

5.0,"super contento con sus cinturones nuevos le encanto esta super feliz, excelente producto y calidad se los recomiendo"
5.0,"This costume is great! It is very easy to set up, you just need 4 AA batteries to put in the battery pack, screw the fan into the costume and turn on the switch. It doesn't inflate very fast and the fan isn't the quietest in the world but it does work. Once it is inflated it actually looks great and if it is on someone shorter, it looks like the cup is on the ground and make it look even funnier. This is a great and easy to use costume!"
5.0,"I bought this as a gift, and it is pretty cool. She loves it and it's kind of a neat and unique piece."
5.0,"was very pleased with this. Great fit, good quality fabric. Will purchase again"
5.0,very cute and comfy for work!!
5.0,"He's almost 8 so I got the largest size. It fits very well. He will get some use out of it instead of it being skin tight and wanting to bust out of every seam. The only drawback I would say is the mask doesn't breathe well, so it gets hot with it on pretty quick."
5.0,"A fun, whimsical way to personalize your luggage.  It makes it easy to find your luggage in the sea of black bags in the baggage claim.  I gave this luggage tag to a friend as a gift and she was happy with it.  My only hesitation is that the shipping is costly."
5.0,"Loved this dress! Beautiful, elegant and high quality material!"
5.0,It’s exactly what I was hoping for. We’ve only had the shirts for a few days so I can’t speak to how well they will wear but they seem well made and heavy duty.
5.0,The comfort and fit..I have very wide feet. It’s difficult to find shoes that fit.
5.0,Love this bag. Very roomy with two small pockets on the inside. Durable material..badass design you really cant go wrong.
5.0,"Nice cap, worth the price."
5.0,"These are nice ! Had no problems opening or closing.  They have a pretty luster, and sturdy."
5.0,"I took it as a good sign that when I took this out of the package and put it on my wife's neck that she almost burst into tears because of how cute it was.  Elephants are our thing for our 1-year-old daughter and she LOVES that there is a mommy and baby elephant so adorably on one necklace.  It is a very delicate necklace so she hasn't really worn it that much because our daughter could break it, but she is excited to!  I like that it is such a high-quality finish I don't have to worry about it giving her marks on her neck when she wears it.  We are both so happy with this necklace!"
5.0,"I was looking for something to help with chafing and this works perfectly, wicks moisture well and generally well made. I would recommend this product."

5.0,Fun product. Wore and got alot of likes
5.0,"Has pads so no nipple imprint. I am 36DD and ordered medium, and it was tight enough for the girls to stay secure during yoga, but not uncomfortably so.  It's not going to be a running/cardio sports bra. I haven't washed yet, so can't speak to stretch. Color and material are very nice."
5.0,They are consonant the same<br />AN breathe well<br />LB
5.0,"These caps are awesome. For $3.33, this is a no nonsense buy. I' a new WM and I wanted to give these out to my members. It is a high quality cap, looks great and feels even better. Best of all, it didn't break my pocket. I'm considering ordering more to give to my new members. Got the caps in the mail in 3 days."
5.0,Love it! I got a lot of compliments.

5.0,"I work with junior high Deaf students. These were our 4th attempt at finding a comfortable mask that would work with the kids. They preferred a  mask in which they could see our mouths and expressions. The only issue I have had was condensation forming from being outside in the cold air. LOL, when I got back inside I actually had drops of water in the mask!"
5.0,It's exactly what you expect it to be!
5.0,"For the price, the best reading classes I've got."
5.0,good woks good
5.0,These gloves fit nice and there comfortable when I cycle
5.0,My girls love them! I think they are gorgeous! A perfect gift for your daughter. My 1 year hold has played with it and she yanks and threw it and it did not break (thank goodness) so it is pretty sturdy but it is a little to big for my 5 and 6 year olds wrists but they will grow into them I still love it!
5.0,"Good price,arrived early,beautiful piece! Thankyou"

5.0,I love everything about these pj set. Yes.
5.0,"Very nice, great color"
5.0,The wallet was perfect for my needs. Slots for cards are not so tight you have to wrestle them out.  Slots for bills are long enough. I can even carry mu Samsung 8 in it.  Great look and feel.
5.0,Best I've had the pleasure to wear.
5.0,"It fits and it would make Wu proud. I bought it as a halloween costume, but I plan to wear it a lot. Wu Tang Hoodie Ain't Nuttin to &#34;Mess&#34; Wit!!"
5.0,This is a great grip working glove. You just have to wash the inside once in a while since it will stink like feet after weeks of use.
5.0,I bought these to replace a pair that I wore often.  They are attractive and very comfortable. I'm pleased!
5.0,"Had one before and loved it, lost it, so I bought two more."
5.0,"My eight year old granddaughter is totally envious of these socks.  :-)  When I first got them, I thought there was no way they were going to fit me - the toes were so small.  However, once I put them on, they fit me perfectly.  I love them and wear them a lot - especially with my &#34;flip-flops&#34;."
5.0,Looks really cool and is working great. Love pocket watches
5.0,Love this dress. I was happy about the length too. They were kind enough to mention that a person needed to wear a slip with this dress as it is white and a little bit thin but not too thin wear. So I went back on Amazon and purchased a slip. Plan on buying the black and white one next.
5.0,The fit is perfect!  The three colors work great for me.
5.0,"I'm a female, 5'3"", ~127lbs. I bought a size S and the fit is perfect. Comfy to wear. Didn't need it but the pockets were bonus."

5.0,Great product for a great price! Size and color is exactly how it looks in the picture. Will purchase again!
5.0,This robe is very plush and warm. I see me using this during colder months and enjoying the warmth. The color is a nice neutral grey. The length is long enough to keep you warm. I give it a 5 out of 5 because it is well made and exactly what I had hoped for.
5.0,These tree shaped ear studs are so beautiful. The quality is way better than I expected.<br />Everybody asked where I got them from when I wore them in a party.
5.0,"And he loves them! I honestly didn't think he would wear them. Low key purchased them for him, but for me, because I really expected him to not wear them at all. Joke was on me. He loves them, and wears them everyday, all day, unless he's working."
5.0,Very good quality! Love and comfortable and light weight.
5.0,Perfect. Just as described. Fast shipping

5.0,Very comfortable for all day wear.

5.0,The Los Ojos yoga pants are great and I would definitely buy them again.  They look great and are very comfortable.  The fit is perfect and I love the pockets.  Absolutely everything I was looking for.  Love the selection of colors too.
5.0,"Can confirm that these are the right lengths, as advertised, saw some saying they were short, but mine weren't. They are made of rather cheap material, so it adds to the bulk of your knot. If you're low on funds but need a wardrobe on the double, these are your ties."
5.0,so pretty.  looks so good .  looks so real for the price.  I don't know when it starts to look bad.  mine still look great after 4 years.

5.0,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS NECKLACE!!!!!!  The necklace looks just like the picture.  I received tons of compliments!!!!!
5.0,LOVE this leather hobo tote bag.  You have option to wear as a shoulder bag or as a satchel bag.  I was looking for a silver leather bag but didn't<br />want a &#34;shiney&#34; silver and this bag is between a flat silver and a shiney silver. The leather is very soft and love that the bag has a constructed<br />bottom that makes the bag sit flat
5.0,"Great. Exactly as advertised.<br />Slick, compact, feels great in my pocket."
5.0,Love these glasses would order again!
5.0,My daughter and  I wore these to dinner on a cruise Christmas night.  So cute and comfortable.
5.0,"These are fantastic! When I need to wear shoe liners, inevitably they'd show. With these, you may get a touch of lace peeking out - it's cute AND you have comfort. Bonus the toe area is non-slip designed!"
5.0,Dressed fits beautifully!
5.0,"Love this basic cardigan.  It makes a perfect, extra, light layer on cooler days.  I plan to buy more in other colors."
5.0,Actually not bad for cheap leather
5.0,"What you see is what you get...and at a great price, too!  This medium weight sweatshirt looks exactly like the photo.<br />Wear it alone or as a second layer. I am so pleased with my first one that I have ordered 2 other colors. You won't be disappointed!"
5.0,Very inexpensive good quality
5.0,"Awesome bag. It is giant, I was worried it wasn't big enough to pack everything for my international trip but I'm happy to see I was wrong. Great product for a great price."
5.0,"I bought this dress for the summer, mostly to go to church, gatherings or meetings where you have to be a little more dressed than the regular jeans and t-shirt outfit !  The cut of the dress is simple, the colors are pretty, the wear is so easy and flowing. I received a lot of compliments wearing it ! Even my daughter ,who would never wear what I wear, had asked me where I bought it ! That was my best compliment ever !!! The price is really reasonable too, and to care is a breathe!  I will probably buy another one pretty soon !"
5.0,Great quality and specs….add great value and that’s a winning formula
5.0,"I really liked this necklace for the price. You so get what you pay for, but the design is nice and the gold a nice color."
5.0,"One lady said..., “I’ve never seen a reindeer headband like that! It’s very cute, dainty, and short just like I’d like it. Are you selling those?” LOL!!! no ma’am! There’s a picture on my IG nataliavalentine214 if you want to see! Happy Shopping!🎄♥️"
5.0,Really good looking high tops. Seem to run half size large.  No arch support so not good for long walks.
5.0,These were great Christmas gifts
5.0,"I bought this bathing suit a year ago and I just searched my order history to buy another one.  The one I own is still in great shape, I just want a second one.  Yes, the fabric that cross crosses the chest isn’t hemmed but after I put the top on I adjust them so the ends are tucked and it’s never frayed.  It did fade a little but I swim often and machine wash it (air dry). The fading isn’t any worse than any other swimsuit I’ve had. I will buy a size smaller this time though because the 3x was actually a bit loose on the bottoms for me.  I usually wear a 3x in clothing."
5.0,Used for a jasmine costume. Perfect. Didn’t hurt my daughters ears.
5.0,Love it! And I've gotten lots of compliments on it!
5.0,Waste is a little tight.

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:70ed464874300a9e75de3d625785f448]] I got the mask for Halloween and they are very neat, the light really give a great effect. Good size for adult fits comfortably. Just missing a battery cover on one of the masks when received. Over all good quality"
5.0,"these pj are super comfy and soft. As I read on previous review, yes the shorts are very small and the shirt runs big around the shoulders. I ordered a medium (usually wear small) and the shorts are still tight but no one sees me except my husband, lol. They don't move on me when I turn in bed which I love and the fabric is high quality, soft and stretchy."
5.0,Its preety wish the set came in more colors<br />Since I have double piercings I wear two colors at a time.
5.0,Absolutely love this. Great find!
5.0,Great fabric. Nice comfortable fit<br /> Can be worn anywhere. Wrinkle free!
5.0,Beautiful blue color and it's thick and warm.  I really like the extra long length. It's perfect for cold winter nights and mornings. I recommend it.
5.0,"Great dress! Thicker fabric than I expected from the price.  Base on the reviews I ordered a size larger than I normally would. The fit is a comfortable snug. If you don't like tight, body con dresses, I would advise to go up two sizes."
5.0,She loved it and i felt it was well made.
5.0,Fit really good and is cute. I would buy this brand again.
5.0,The item was as expected and kept me warm during my whole overbite work shift.Great product
5.0,I liked everything about this jewelry.  I also purchased necklace and earrings.  Many compliments.  Looks very expensive.  Looks more like glass than acrylic.  Light weight is wonderful.  Fun wearing.
5.0,Such an elegant dress for so cheap! Comfortable and looks dressy despite the not so fancy material!
5.0,Perfect for over leggings. It's VERY flowy you may want to go down a size. Great stretch and soft t shirt like fabric.
5.0,Arrived sooner than expected. Quality is as expected with UA.
5.0,It is so comfortable and cool. I love this dress and have a few more like it. I wish I could find more in this style.
5.0,I ordered a xxl because I have big arms. That was my main concern. I normally wear a size 12 top. This top has plenty of room for my arms. The sleeves are very long they cover my hands. But I just scrunched them up. The colors are very vibrant.
5.0,Looks like picture..very pleased.
5.0,Dew rags skull cap nice to wear all year around
5.0,Adorable -- my daughter loved it!  Nice quality.
5.0,Perfect... my daughter loves it!!

5.0,"My daughter loves these socks! The size was dead on, the colors and characters are brilliant and cute. They don't come up over here knees like I expected but she's a little bigger than most toddlers her age, but it's fine. They were delivered  fast and on time with no damage. They martial of the socks are soft and comfy so she's happy. Mom's happy too. Id highly recommend these socks for Baby."

5.0,Clean classic look.
5.0,They work as expected. I would buy again!
5.0,beautiful necklace great quality
5.0,My wife owns a ton of patty products and I think this one is her favorite. Pattyboutik continues to make quality products!
5.0,It works.  It is great for necklaces also.
5.0,Great Quality Product.
5.0,For the cost I would say this is a very good product. Because I read other reviews first I ordered a large 4 to 9-year-olds and it fit perfectly on them. I ordered two different hats thinking I would get two different patterns because they said it's random but I got two of the same pattern. The pattern is very pretty so I'm not really upset about it. It is so long well and it fits well and comfortably without any issues.
5.0,Super cute & light for those summer hot days (:<br />Also a very nice quality.
5.0,Fit nice look good on feet
5.0,Like the zipper pocket. Don't like the feel of the material.
5.0,"This by far the best lab coat we have ever purchased. My daughter loves it! It fits perfectly. You can tell care was put into designing it. Very nice quality. Solid material. Had nice stitch lines. We are super happy we bought this one. We will be buying another one here shortly for my other daughter. The one she has is new, but is ragged and not proportioned correctly. I highly recommend anyone needing a children's lab coat to get this one!"
5.0,Very Elegant and chic!
5.0,Very pleased with this product.  Very soft for a newborn'so head.  Great value.
5.0,Great bag! I use it for work. Looks really nice and sturdy.
5.0,They are attractive and I feel less tired after a full day of computer work.  thank you!
5.0,"Very pretty, looks delicate and well made."
5.0,Over all great fit no complaints all items was very satisfactory
5.0,These things are rad. They came in a nice pouch and look like actual screws. I made a video of myself &#34;screwing&#34; it into my ear and I got a few people to freak out. The fit my 16 gauge piercings just fine and they are very good quality. Highly recommended.
5.0,This is perfect.  I was so pleased when this item of jewelry arrived.  It is an award for a most improved golfer in my club and I can't wait to see how she likes it.
5.0,This dress is so comfortable and has the softest material.
5.0,These are the best masks! I added a filter and was definitely pleased that they were not heavy or interfering with my breathing. I have also received many comments about how nice these masks look and fit. I would definitely recommend them!
5.0,not too bulky and was not expensive
5.0,Nice shirt with good fabric. A little tight on the chest but manageable.
5.0,"Fits as expected and really cute.  Nice pretty pink color and comfortable, seems to be made pretty good."
5.0,It's a gift to my daughter who has an orange cat just like the earrings. She loved it.
5.0,Love it... I usually like big bags but this one is great as my weekend bag... Fits a lot in it..
5.0,"Loose-fitting, casual and cute. Order your size for loose-fit and a size smaller for close-fit."
5.0,"Once I figured out the quick release, bands were changed in seconds. Total time from opening package to replacing was 4 minutes, but would be less than 30 seconds in the future. Awesome system on Fenix5x. Love this watch. So happy to have working band now for $10. Will probably order black & red, too! Silicon material and fit are very similar to OEM. Quality seems equal or better."
5.0,"I do not have images yet as I wrapped this one up as a gift. However, before I did so, I did check it out for its quality first (failed to get pictures beforehand).<br /><br />The bracelet's elastic band is great to help fit if the wrist is a bit more larger than the bracelet's factory size. It also looks great and the gemstones look pretty! The gold styling looks like it would be gold as well so this bracelet would make for a great gift or a gift for yourself at a good price!"
5.0,"My first time ordering from Grace Karin and I was so pleasantly impressed. The color (wine) is rich and the material is luscious. It has stretch, but holds its shape. It is made like a quality olden days dress with darting at the bust, so if you don’t like the way darts hold a shape you may want a different style, but If you place the darting in the correct spot it is nice I think. Love the pockets and amazed that after being stuffed in a bag and shipped to me, the fabric holds no wrinkles and I could have put it right on and gone out . The zipper is not the best, but hopefully will be less fickle in time. I am busty so the fit around the arm hole is a little wide, but I was planning to wear a little jacket with it, so not a big deal for me. The length is great for me, but I am 5’3 , curvy and got the xl. Definitely will be trying more by this designer."
5.0,"Good bags! Overall they are a little smaller than I expected, but they're nice enough quality for me. I really love that you can put the strap on the crossbody bag or the tote, however the one thing I would change is that it would be nice to be able to attach the long strap to the handbag because the straps on that bag are pretty uncomfortable. The inside of the bags seems kind of noisy and plasticy, but it doesn't bother me. All the bags have an adequate number of pockets. Mine even came with a Christmas card! Haha. I tried to include plenty of pictures in case someone was on the fence like I was, but I really like the bags and you get all you need for a relatively low price!"
5.0,"Most hats I find that are the correct size are very wide. And it wouldn’t cover the entire head, ears would be sticking out. These are perfect, true to size and fits head nice and snug and covers ears as well."
5.0,"This is a nicely appointed watch for those looking for large numerals, excellent lume, atomic timekeeping (accurate to 1 sec/mo), solar charging and additional features including temperature, compass headings, altitude (elevation) and barometric pressure.  You must remove the watch from your wrist to get air temp or it will measure your wrist temp.  I don’t use the altitude, temp  or barometric pressure features but they would be useful for a hiker/camper.<br />The solar charging feature means battery changes only happen once every ten years or so.  Then you’ll need to replace the solar charged battery  (rechargeable Panasonic CTL 1616 currently costing $13.69 on Amazon).  I wear the watch almost continuously (except when showering) and it usually charges enough to keep it running.  It has not slowed down on me so far and you have a battery charge status readout if you need it.  Atomic time updates nightly if you live in a location that receives the satellite signal.<br />The crystal is mineral based so I added a 37mm screen protector (also available from Amazon) so I’d avoid scratching the face.  Now I can replace the screen protector if it scratches as they only cost a few bucks.<br />The lume makes it easy to read the time at night and if if necessary, you it provides illumination at the touch of a button.  The lume stays illuminated thru the night and the additional illumination light can be set for a 1.5 or 3 second duration.  I’ve only needed to use this feature a few times so far as I’m able to read the hands at night.<br />It’s a great watch that should stand up to daily use quite well. The band is silicone and sturdy and should last many years.<br />Be sure and print out the pdf file which is available on the Amazon watch page as it has the complete programming and function access instructions (16 pages) as the brief instructions that come with the watch are not adequate to fully explain all the features and benefits of the watch.<br />Very pleased with this purchase so far!"
5.0,"LOVE these. I'm just getting used to leggings. They're warm and lined and very comfortable. Love that they came in a set of three with different colors. I got the grey, burgundy and black trio. I think they had 3 black in a package and one other set of 3 colors to chose from. The price was right."
5.0,This is a very beautiful bracelet. Fits well and looks so nice on the wrist. Well made and I recommend highly.
5.0,Love this. Get so many compliments. T-shirt fabric. So comfortable.
5.0,Perfect for the price point
5.0,"I wanted a basic solid leotard for my daughter's gymnastics class. This fits her great and is very a soft thicker material. Great quality, I wish I would have sized up one though."
5.0,Gave as a Christmas gift. She loved it.
5.0,"This is a very nice hat, sturdy not falling apart, received many compliments"
5.0,Awesome sunglasses comes neatly packaged and fits my face perfectly.
5.0,"These are amazing! So soft, so comfortable. Medium support; wouldn’t use for running. Great quality for the price. I will definitely be buying more."
5.0,Great basics for my son! Very good quality!
5.0,They are a little larger then expected but they are so beautiful I don’t care I will just double up on socks
5.0,Higher quality than I expected and loved it!!
5.0,Love. Love. Love. Flattering.
5.0,"5' 6"" 148lbs 38C with a big belly - like a few months pregnant (waist 41 inches fully at ease - gross) I ordered a medium and it fit well but def. could stretch it even more as it was quite loose (I like that it's loose as it doesn't show back-fat)  My four pics show the gorgeous color! Material does NOT shrink with washing/drying. What I really love is that it totally camouflages my pregnant-like belly. My legs are slender so they are a size 8 pants but my belly is a size 12 - it's so hard to find jeans to fit properly. With the exception of the super close photo, my belly is out in all it's glory and you really can't tell at all. Material is thin but not bad - actually makes it quite comfortable. If you have a nice body, GET THIS! Especially in this color/design (called Round Flower Orange). It's so gorgeous and would look great on a good butt. Pockets are a nice plus but with the stretchy material, nothing too heavy could be placed in them."
5.0,Fit just as I thought it would. I'm 5'8 just about so it was a little above my ankles but it got the job done for our family photos. Very soft and coloring was deep and not faded.
5.0,I am very satisfied with this purchase. Good quality and effective!
5.0,Beautiful and fits well ty
5.0,"I love this keepsake urn, it allows me to carry my husband with me everywhere and it's not heavy and doesn't tarnish.  I love it"
5.0,These are one of my faves
5.0,Beautiful dress... Got so many compliments.... And it's great quality.
5.0,GREAT FOR MY SAMSUNG S10
5.0,"I think this is going to be one of my new favorite shape wear bodysuits, and that says a lot, because I wear bodysuits like this one everyday, and have tried almost every brand. This suit fits me just about perfectly, I would say the compression is moderate to firm, which is a good thing since firm compression can be a bit too uncomfortable for everyday use, and very firm control bodysuits also sometimes tend to bunch or ride up in a way that actually make your curves look less smooth. It's very comfortable, and the bra part fits me surprisingly well, since I often find that the bodysuits with built in bras seem to be made for women with bigger busts. This one is also great because it is a pushup too, so it's very flattering, but the amount of padding isn't too extreme as to look unnatural or fake. I'm also very pleased with the way they handled the fabric in the back. It's a great alternative to a thong bodysuit if you don't want to show panty lines while wearing a bodycon dress, pencil skirt or leggings.The quality of the fabric and the way everything together is also great, so this really is a terrific deal. I should note that while I found that the size small I got fit me perfectly, I am technically a size XS or even XXS, so it may be that a true size S woman would find this a little on the small side."
5.0,My daughter has sensory issues when it comes to clothes and she says this is very soft. The seam where the tutu is sewn to the leo is a tad bothersome when she first puts it on but she’s able to get use to it. This isn’t the case with a lot of leos with attached tutus. This is our 3rd one of theses and they’ve all held up extremely well.
5.0,El reloj clásico de Casio. Que más se puede pedir por su valor.
5.0,Hold up well. This my 2 pair. I alternate between these and flip flops in warmer weather so they survived 3 years!
5.0,"I LOVE this tote bag, received it on Jan.7,'22. IT'S HUGE and accommodates everything. I originally saw this bag on a flash ad by an unknown company in Japan that would of course take 20-30 days to arrive and there was no info on the company...wasn't risking my money. I'd been Hot for this bag since then (Nov '21) so when saw these beauties I was ECSTATIC 🤣😃!! I had to contain myself from ordering more than one in the first order.  I ordered the Green....it looks exactly like the photograph...it's well made, has strong stitching, it is PU leather as indicated in the description, good quality, very deep outer and inside pocket which I didn't expect. There are two inside pockets and one is zippered. When I received the bag I agreed with another reviewer that the snap closure was in the wrong place But, after having items inside and carrying it the current position makes sense and works perfectly. This bag should last a long, long time if you take care of it. Don't OVER stuff it or it will get heavy. It was perfect for my movie blanket and water for going to the movies. One more thing, this bag stands up on its own as you can see by the pics I've attached...there are no metal feet on the bottom, it just does it..at least this one does. If you buy this bag you won't be disappointed...I'm definitely purchasing one or two more. Thank you for a great product.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! Excellent quality and perfect size!!!!
5.0,Quality is good. I bought it for a gift and it will make a nice one.
5.0,"These mask ARE THE BEST! I ordered large, they cover my nose to under my chin. The band that holds the ear piece in place really WORKS... I’m on oxygen so the tubing has to go over my ears as well as my glasses along with the mask ear piece it’s a lot to hold in place.  This really works to hold everything in place at once.  The  masks are roomy i’m comfortable and get a close fit on my face"

5.0,So comfortable without any wires! Great push up bra. It came with an extension piece for the hooks which I've been using because I don't like bras too snug around my underarms and back. Great purchase for the price.
5.0,Great black staple piece for your wardrobe
5.0,Purchased for my grand daughter. She hasn't taken them out since she got them. No irritation to her ears.
5.0,I'm on oxygen and the tubing would kink and reduce the air flow.  I wrapped the tubing with one of these key chains and the tubing does not kink!
5.0,This necklace is so nice!  I think it's definitely worth the purchase price.  The box it comes in is perfect for a gift.  My daughter loves it and it really made her day!

5.0,Hat is very well insulated and keeps your head warm.
5.0,Also a second purchase. Lovely
5.0,It's a terrific little bag. I mostly use it to carry my cosmetic products. The size is perfect and reasonably priced.
5.0,These were very stylish for my son...not the expensive kind but he looked goodt!!!
5.0,I am a 34 waist and ordered large. Fits comfortably. A medium would have  been too tight to be comfortable when exercising.  These are  for warm weather or indoor wear only. Too thin for outdoors during winter.<br />Would buy again.
5.0,"Love it, fits and feels great"
5.0,"They were great I have always wore uggs, but lately they have been uncomfortable. The bear 🐻 paws are awesome the fit and feel are great"
5.0,This sweater is gorgeous. It has a snug stretchy fit. I usually wear a medium and sized up to a large- it was perfect! Love it!
5.0,"Like this purse, price was right and just so cute."
5.0,Each bell has a different bell tone!  Love them!!!
5.0,"I absolutely love this hat. I have very thick hair and this hat does not have any problems with all of my hair. I can go fishing, be at the beach and this hat stays in place. I am very fair skinned and need extra coverage from the sun. This by far is the best hat I have ever had that totally covers my face and protects me from the sun."
5.0,Lovely dress. I feel the fabric is a little heavy & it runs a bit big but I love it. I love the length goes just below the knees & it has an off the shoulder look while still having straps.
5.0,Love the blue bling. Perfect charm for a cyclist.
5.0,"I work at Target as a Guest Advocate and I have received well over 50 compliments from guests since I've been wearing it! Babies are memerized at the sprakles bouncing from the store lighting, little girls just stare as if they want one just like it, and even men are amazed by it."
5.0,"So many Compliments on this , Love it"
5.0,"I love the design, my top is xl so that is what I ordered. Fits slightly tight which is what I wanted. Keeps my 65 year old flabby arms and belly hidden. It's a little whimsical so adds some fun with stripes and flowers. I'm 5'5"" and 180 lbs and happy with the size. I have not tried on the bottom. Will wear long board shorts under it."
5.0,Very nice looking. Not heavy duty.
5.0,Nice looking shirt but I had to return it because it did not fit well.
5.0,"My grandson is starting a collection and I am extremely pleased with my entire order process. It was quick, easy and his mask arrived expediently in perfect condition. I will order his next one from you too. Thanks!!"
5.0,"I am petite (short waisted) yet I have trouble with tank tops riding up. These fit well...I'm curvy, but I'm glad I ordered up a size. They are super-soft and tight enough that I can sleep comfortably without a bra, but I will lounge in them at home while I'm working on homework. Material is great! I haven't washed them yet- but they will probably travel with me- they don't get hot."
5.0,super cheep and looks like a $20 one.
5.0,I love love love them
5.0,These masks are cute and my kindergartener loves them.  The box was crushed beyond repair when they arrived but the masks themselves were fine.
5.0,I do not usually wear golden jewellery but prefer the rose gold and dull gold type. But surprisingly I really liked this bracelet a lot. It looks very feminine and fragile and the design is really intricate. If you want some thing classy and less flashy then this is just perfect.<br /><br />The bracelet is yellow plated with small sized Cubic Zirconia nicely set in it. The circular design of the bracelet has lines engraved on it giving it a very nice look. The bracelet is easy to wear and remove and looks good with any outfit. It is a perfect gifting option for any occasion. It comes in a nice gift box.<br /><br />Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.
5.0,Wear it everyday works great
5.0,My grandson loves it and wears it all the time.
5.0,Love this shirt!!! Highly recommended!!!
5.0,For my card embellishments
5.0,"Love the material, so comfy and stylish"
5.0,I've become a packing cube convert (previous ones were not compression) and bought a couple sets of these for our recent trip to Europe and was completely satisfied with how they worked.<br /><br />The key thing with these (that most people don't understand) is to have enough and not over pack them. Doing so severely impacts how well they compress. I just use a couple extra to sort out my different clothing items.
5.0,They are very comfortable. I highly recommend this product highly.
5.0,"For a  coffee lover, they are wonderful"
5.0,Great fit and very comfortable!! True to size!
5.0,These work like a charm we absolutely love them!
5.0,My daughter loves these earrings so much! They are bigger then I expected them to be but we don't mind. They are super cute!
5.0,Love this cardigan. I would say it runs a tad big. I would recommend sizing down 1 size.
5.0,"Quick delivery, just as pictured, great price for the quality!  Eight little girls loved their necklaces at my daughter's 8th birthday party!  There were lots of ohhs and ahhs."
5.0,We got this for our dog and it was perfect. Great quality!
5.0,"Love this hat! Fit is perfect! Comfy, not hot."
5.0,Works just fine !

5.0,The owl wand is gorgeous !  My son loves it. Surprisingly beautifully made and a neat looking object.
5.0,I love love love it!!! It fits so well and the sizes are accurate. It tightens my body and works well!! Highly recommended!!
5.0,I love them some have a few color string but very minimum. It’s a thin canvas as described. Thank you!
5.0,Must HAVE! It’s absolutely gorgeous in every color! I promise! Just make sure your measurements match up to the size chart! The dress even has some stretch!
5.0,Very nice wallet. Great quality! Great price! I recommend buying!
5.0,"Although red is not my favorite color to wear, this is the most comfortable apron I've owned. The &#34;halter&#34; type aprons pull on my neck making me uncomfortable. This one doesn't pull at all. It is a very strong, durable fabric. washes well, and fits well for my 5'6&#34;, 170 lb frame. Would like a bit more length to it, but it is ok. Would like to get one in white and/or black. I recommend it to regular apron wearers."
5.0,"Really love the Kate Spade scarves, this is another sweet one. Simple but really classy."
5.0,"These don't look quite as cool as I imagined but they make you feel like you are tripping, a lot of fun. The also turn green street lights solid blue, very cool."
5.0,Perfect little huggy earrings that look high quality for the price
5.0,I got these for my mom and she loves them and they look great on her. They make her feel good about herself and she says they are very comfortable. I am considering buying some for myself.
5.0,Ordered this for my niece she loves it
5.0,Great product. love this product. excellent quality
5.0,"Ok so this shoes are very comfortable and my little boy likes them his words. Quality is excellent and so is craftsmanship. So far no issues. My 5 year old drags them through just about any pile of dirt, puddle of water and seems he can’t steer clear from mud. I had machine wash and hand wash then at least four times since i purchased then and no rips or signs of wear yet. So far been very durable and would definitely buy again."
5.0,"Was very happy with this dress. Comfortable material with some stretch no zippers. The top underneath chest part does not have straps so I was a little worried it would slip down, but no problems at all. Lovely dress something I'm sure I can ware for many more occasions. I ordered navy, small I'm 5'7 smaller frame, fell at knee."
5.0,I haven'the worn a watch in years andI love it! The face is the perfect size. The weight is easy to get used too. I would definitely buy another one.
5.0,"My daughter asked for a tail and ears, I looked through a number of options and I am so glad I took the time to search. The tail is so soft and the perfect length, it's easy to strap on through your belt loops and looks so life like. The ears are also really cute and the head band is slim making it easy to hide in you hair.. I'm extremely satisfied with this product and my daughter couldn't be happier."
5.0,I have been looking for this type of button tool for years!  It's very easy to operate and the zipped carrying pouch is very handy. It's easy as 1-2-3 to use. Very economical- good value for the price. I'm using it now with crafting.
5.0,Great price! Works perfect!
5.0,"I ordered theses to wear after I had surgery and they are perfect. Soft and comfortable, fits great. I am 5'7"", 130lbs, 36B and I ordered a Medium as I like my PJs loose. A small would have fit if you like to have your clothing more snug."
5.0,"I love joggers and I love my joggers fitted but not tight. These do not offer any compression or tummy control but that’s why I love them. They are  super soft and stretchy. Perfect for my yoga or running workouts. Easy to dress up or down with different shoes and shirts. And they have pockets, real and deep pockets! Make sure to size up compares to yoga pants your normally wear."
5.0,Fine replacement frame
5.0,I don’t typically write reviews but I think this really needs it!  This shirt is perfect!!!!  Sizing is true to real size and so soft!  Ordered the large (for chest and arm length).  Typically a large would be big around the torso and look maternity but this was perfect!!!!  I will be getting this in another pattern.
5.0,These have become my favorite earrings!!! I wear them a lot. They may be small for someone who like really huge earrings but for me at 66 they are perfect! Wish they made them with additional colored stones. That would be lovely!
5.0,-price
5.0,"Although the skirt is shorter than expected on my 5'6"" daughter, the fabric is holding up well. It is not denim fabric but a denim colored fabric. A nice basic skirt to wear with a variety of tops."
5.0,"like the belt a lot!  would be helpful to have more instructions -- like to unhook the belt, use the button, push the belt in to release then out to remove.  shipping was very fast."
5.0,"Beautiful color, easy to carry.  It comes with a secure carrying handle on the outside as well as a hanging hook on the inside when opened. All the zippers are strong and well sewn as is the rest of the bag. Is  compact, strong  and good looking.<br />Very happy with this toiletry bag, highly recommend"
5.0,This is a great deal for camping. It's so warm and it actually is waterproof. I highly recommend this product
5.0,Look great dressed up or with jeans!<br />I would recommend
5.0,"This items looks way better in person, I was so turned off but the image but it is sparkly, large and quite the statement piece.  Please note this is a clip on I did not know that I am ok with it but the clip ons have a little cushions on them so they don't hurt"
5.0,Love this set! Especially for the price. Definitely true to size- I thought I might need to size up but the small worked out perfectly. the top is a relaxed fit and both pieces are super cozy- like pajamas that you can wear all day!
5.0,Wonderful backpack
5.0,This charm is well made and the perfect addition to my &#34;beach themed&#34; bracelet. Much less expense than pandora and every bit as nice.
5.0,"I bought this to wear as a shawl with a navy cocktail dress. It's big enough to be perfect for that. It does have a shimmery band on the edge which is fine for more formal dress, but I will probably wear it just as a long scarf with jeans, too."
5.0,Fits fabulous and I continue to get compliments every single time I wear this!  I love it... very comfortable and has so far washed and worn nicely.
5.0,"The material feels great - was not expecting such quality online and for $10. Front is fully lined with padded top. Straps and lacing in front are adjustable. I'm 5'9"", 140 lb and ordered a Medium (my usual size). An extra 1/2 inch in the torso would be ideal for my height but still fits great, no need to return. Flattering cut, perfect amount of butt coverage. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Very nice top well made
5.0,Just what I needed and wanted works great
5.0,Cleans very well
5.0,"I LOVE this bag, it looks just like the picture and it comes with an arm strap, the inside is spacious and had strips."
5.0,These are great Christmas gifts
5.0,"The 14k Gold plated  nugget ring from the bling factor his fake. It's &#34;gold tone&#34; instead of &#34;gold plated&#34; I ordered 10 rings, 3 chains, 2 pairs of earrings & 1 bracelet all gold plated none faded but this one. I highly recommend you stay away from this one its worthless"
5.0,I love Haviaina's and these are the real deal. True to size and such a cute print.
5.0,very soft and nice fitting socks.  They fit as expected and the moisture wicking is great.  I wear a size 13 shoe and ordered extra large socks and they fit perfectly.
5.0,"Fits perfectly. Like others have said, if you are wearing it as pictured your cheeks will be out. Suit is really simple and cute."
5.0,I had no issues changing the straps on my smart watch. It looks good. Will definitely order more colors.

5.0,I ordered this to wear at my son's wedding. Got lots of comments on how pretty it is. Very easy to take the links out for a good fit
5.0,I bought this dress for my mother as she had been looking for a MAXI dress with sleeves for a while.  I know my mother - she loves pockets in her slacks and as a MAXI dress this dress also has pockets!  It looks so good on my mother.  She is thrilled with the colors and the pockets!  She is looking forward to wearing it with dinner with her girlfriends next month.  The price was also awesome!
5.0,Hats dope straight cold limping
5.0,"Pleasantly surprised by this. It fits my average-sized 5-year-old like a glove, and has a zipper rather than the annoying Velcro closure most costumes like this have. Gloves are attached to the rest of the suit, so NO MORE ANNOYING COSTUME GLOVES STREWN AROUND THE HOUSE! Bless it."
5.0,"Lovely colour, well made and looks really nice, i hope it fits my friend, i know it will be nice and warm."
5.0,"Kept my head warm snowboarding in Alaska, ended up buying two more. Super warm."

5.0,Cute and pithy sayings to wear for most occasions. Two or more can be grouped together for extra effects.
5.0,I read the other reviews and ordered up a size. Yes it’s long but will serve the purpose as an Ariel costume for church. Very cute and stretchy.
5.0,These leggings are so comfy and soft. I was worried they would be too tight but they fit perfectly true to size. I ordered the blue steal and the purple camo love both so worth the money.
5.0,Love the make and quality only thing is little long but hem it and perfect

He can wear it as is or on top of a turtle neck or collared shirt. He is pretty picky when it comes to material and he is more than happy to wear this, so I can say it is ""itch free!"""
5.0,Perfect fit. I can't tell the difference between the factory lenses and the Seek replacements.
5.0,"Nice earrings, they go with most anything, casual to dressy."
5.0,"These are somewhat sheer.  I like to wear these as a modesty layer under shorter dresses.  Nice and soft, and warm."

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:2a9f33a80f9a4d90a3331f0ba58e6671]] Ladies, are you sick and tired of getting your heels stuck on the ground when you attend an event? Well, it's time to rejoice because Heels Above just  created something every high heels lovers needed a heel protector. This high heel protector came in 2 pairs and a small bag for storing inside the purse. I bought the clear heel protector which is made of a plastic like silicon that can get  a little stretch when you insert your heel. You need to do a little elbow greasing to put the heel of your should but it was really not a problem. The plastic fit like a glove on the heel of your shoes. I was able to get this product on a discount provided that I give my honest and unbiased review. I'd say it is something every high heels lovers like me should own.<br /><br />I will be ordering more and giving this as a gift for my girlfriends."
5.0,"This is exactly what I wanted.  Easy to assemble and easy to adjust the cantilever spread.  In addition, there is a pedal which, when pressed by foot, allows you to rotate the the umbrella when the sun moves."
5.0,"Very nice sheer chiffon scarf to wear for those special occasions. Bought for a wedding I was going to, but ended up forgetting it at the last minute. It is a nice length."
5.0,good deal! fast shipping. would buy again
5.0,"Very warm and cozy , just wish the inner lining was white like the fleece lined sweats , instead of the tan..this is not a bad review please stop emailing me .. feels like you are “phishing and harassing”"
5.0,"These are very pretty, only thing is your baby needs to have a big head. These do not fit my 2 month old at all, shes got at least 3 months to go before she can possibly wear them. Definitely for older babies, but I will be excited to use them, as the material seems gentle and the band is forgiving, so i anticipate it will be comfortable to wear for her!"

5.0,Just what I needed on my island trip
5.0,Soft and comfortable.<br />Runs true to size.<br />Fair price.

5.0,Pretty creepy ... which was perfect for my 10 yr old son
5.0,Great! Very bright colors as expected.
5.0,"They are absolutely beautiful,thank you."
5.0,"I absolutely love, love, love this dress.  It is stunningly beautiful and elegant.  I'm 4'10&#34;, 135 lbs, and, with curves like that, I usually choose dresses that are a bit form fitting so they don't overwhelm my body.  I ordered a large in this dress and initially felt out of my comfort zone, as the dress doesn't hug my curves, although it does give a little swing to my hips.  I maybe/possibly could have gotten away with ordering a medium, but I decided I liked the couple extra inches of room that the dress provided. The hem was about knee level for me, which worked well. I QUICKLY fell in love with this dress.  The fabric and lace appear to be high quality.  It is soft and silky.  I paired it with a pair of black boots and a black choker.  I can't remember the last time I received so many compliments during the evening; I felt so beautiful.  I highly recommend this dress.!!!"
5.0,"I really love these Mio Eyewear glasses.  They are lightweight and fit nicely on my face.  They are super stylish and classy looking.  It's just the right amount of darkness in the lenses.  No more squinting out in the sun!  I love the case they come with.  Again, super classy.  If you're looking for a great pair of sunglasses, these are a great fit!"
5.0,"fit right ,look good and are very rugged boots."
5.0,Easy solution to having the Fitbit fall off and get lost. Great idea until they redesign the wrist strap.
5.0,Awesome! More than my expectations! Big! Heavy totally worth the money! I would recommend it to anybody! You will not be disappointed!
5.0,Stylish & holds everything!
5.0,Subtle cat statement so delicate and well crafted. Very pretty. A touching way to represent love for cats in minimalistic way. Love it so much bought a second one so my sister and I have matching necklaces.
5.0,"The shorts fit well and look nice.  My only problem is that I ordered a two pack of black, paid for two, but only received one.  I received them yesterday and wrote to the Seller and reached out to  Amazon and I’ve not heard back from anyone.  This is the first time this has happened. So I’m upset and disappointed about this. 🥴.  So check your packages closely.<br /><br />UPDATE ON 7/11/2021 - I still never heard back from the seller; no email and no call.  But I did contact Amazon and they sent me another pair, so all is good.  The shorts fit very well.  They’re not too thin and have a nice comfortable weight to them.  They are high enough on the waist that they do not roll down. And they the leg comes barely above the knee, which is what I wanted.  As I do my daily walk, the pockets hold my cell phone, so I can walk hands free, and the other pocket can hold a package of tissue or whatever your needs are.  So, a bad start, ended well.  Thank you Amazon!"
5.0,They've become my everyday look. I forget to take them out.
5.0,I liked the style and size. It would look good on many young people without being overly sentimental.  It is a fine piece of jewelry and would make a nice gift/
5.0,"This one is a winner. It has proven to be one of the most durable bras I own. The material is soft, similar to Victoria's Secret but less pricey, and it was a very attractive bra for the size."
5.0,Love them look and fit great.
5.0,"Kind of loose for me, I'm 98 pounds ,5'6. But i fixed and I love it,  I used it for a weeding (as a guest) I received lot of compliments ."
5.0,Bought two for my keys. Was nervous they would come loose in my pocket but they have been rock solid! One carries a leatherman PS4 and another a Olight IR2 EOS. Excellent quality!
5.0,Nice pants ... not too heavy or warm for summer weather in Iowa
5.0,Actually very good quality.
5.0,"I believe this pair looks best with bright blue kicks but don’t trust me, see for yourself!"
5.0,These shirts look great and are perfect for wearing to the gym. They are also incredibly comfortable.
5.0,Loved it-- as described Barefoot Dreams!
5.0,"I was really skeptical about this product, but I was so surprised! It worked great and stayed in place! I’ve worn it 3 additional times and it’s still sticky. Highly recommend this product!"
5.0,My father loved receiving this as a gift and wears it proudly!! Quality material...fits as expected...has not shrunk!
5.0,"I love this bag. It's not big or small, perfect size. It has a lot of room. The only thing I don't like is that all of the inside mini pockets are the same size other than that this bag is perfect."
5.0,"Don't be in a hurry when you order these. When they finally arrived, they looked just like the advert. The additional insert makes them kinda stiff until it get broken in."
5.0,"These phone charms are really trendy right now, so I ordered some as a Christmas gift for my sisters. Great quality for the price and the fact that it comes with 6 makes it perfect to split it up as a gift for different people or they have the option to continually change it out! Overall a great length and good purchase! They’re study too and they’ve even caught their phone multiple times from falling by utilizing it! Love!"
5.0,"Ok honestly, I bought this just as a gamble. I had a baby a few months ago so I have a little extra weight just right in the middle and so I need ed d all new summer clothes and I'm learning to shop for my new body type. I went with a large, I'm 5'3"" 160lbs and all my weight in the middle. I wanted something cute for summer that wasnt just shorts and a tank. This is amazing. It fits just right! Its isnt super tight around the middle and the time covers my post baby bump perfectly! It's flowy but also fits just right around the bum area and perfectly centered V neck so I can still feel sexy and feminine while not accentuating the area I'm still working on. Perfect length on the thighs. I just cant say enough good about this. This week exceeded my expectations. It's perfect for hot days because it covers just enough and its loose and flowy. I love sweatyrocks stuff, but I have been bummed out not being able to really rock midriff cuts anymore. But I'm so grateful because I havent felt like I've been able to dress sexy and sit my body type and honestly this has made me feel that way 1000x over. And it's so cheap! I've paid 4x as much for stuff that I haven't loved nearly as much. I do wish it had pockets but really. That is just me being nit picky! For as happy as I am, I wouldve paid much more.  Will add pics later but if you are on the fence about this... I would say just go with it."
5.0,"This dress is perfect. So,so comfortable.<br />I am 5’7 and usually have trouble finding dresses that fit below the knee. The dress flows nicely and also came with a belt."
5.0,Great item! I found someone to do add graphics to it for our Christmas cookie baking day.
5.0,"The fit was just right ( I'm on average a size 10, 158lbs, 36d) It fit perfect and is so classic!"
5.0,"Holy Batman, what a great Xmas party dress!!  5 star. Remember the quality is what you pay for, but regardless it is very well made and not see through.  I read the reviews and ordered up 1-2 sizes, however I should have stayed with my true size because it actually ran a little big for true sizing and my normal size would have been perfect.<br /><br /> For reference: I am 5’7” 170 34DDD and should have gotten a M. (The XL prob fits a 12-14, L fits a 10-12, and M fits an 8-10).  That would be my guess for comfortable sizing!<br /><br />Happy shopping!!"
5.0,Beautiful dress. Actually bousht 1 with sleeves as well. Great fabric. not itchy and well made.
5.0,I actually had to return the pair I bought. His mother bought the same one. But grandson loves these shoes. He’s a big sand lot fan
5.0,"I love this dress , true to size , and it exactly as described. The fabric is soft and stretchy and the length is just perfect."
5.0,If you're a Stranger Things fan you'll like this hat. It's well made and fits like it should.
5.0,"These things are rugged. Thanks to YouTube videos, you can replace the batteries yourself and still have a water proof watch. I bought this new, thinking my previous Casio of this type had bought the farm. Once I had this one, I worked on the other one - replaced the strap and battery and it is now running fine. Thinking of strapping it to my ankle so I can check the time when doing squats. Best buy for the money, hands down."
5.0,"I ordered this exact same dress last spring and wore it so much it wore out. It's like a t-shirt material and got kind of pilled up after a while. The cut is awesome, the neckline is flattering and fitted, and the sides flare out right at the hip which I personally love, it makes me look more curvy where I want to. I just reordered it for this spring and this time it is the same dress but inexplicably like a foot too long. I am 5'6 and seriously it's for someone who is 7 feet tall. But it's cheap and I love the rest of it so I'll have it hemmed."
5.0,"Awesome fit, comfortable, fashionable and durable. My son loves the elastic band without a zipper. He was 8years old when I bought the first pair and month after I ordered next pair. I was scared they will disappear from Amazon.  The pants are loose on top, great for movement,  his scooter and hip hop dance class, school and anything! They are baggy not tight except for the ankle part which makes it great for everything including biking. My only disappointment was that there was not enough colors in his size so I bough 2 extra a size bigger and they are “in a waiting mode”. They look great with just a T-shirt and a button up shirt. We have 3 colors and the one that is a size bigger doesn’t bother  him bc the elastic band around the ankle keeps it in place. These are pants of the year for him and we love the look, the pockets, fabric and all design. I highly recommend them!"
5.0,Works good with a beard comfortable
5.0,"I am new to the Apple watch, but DAMN it looks good now!!!!"
5.0,Dos with my ring. pretty tiny
5.0,"Ordered a medium , I’m usually a large and it fits perfect and super soft. Love it"
5.0,Well-made masks with attention to detail: ear loops are adjustable and the masks are well made. I like the variety of colors and 5 for $25 is a good price.
5.0,So cute. Fit my birthday boy perfectly! Nothing cuter than stitch and a chubby baby.
5.0,Just right fit
5.0,I wore this dress to two weddings this year. Apparently navy blue was popular this season! I’m 5’6” & 140 lbs bought the medium which fit perfectly.
5.0,"Love the dark lens to help me see when it's sunny out, the clasp in the back eases their removal without pulling my hair out and they look sharp! Be sure to keep the case to prevent scratching the lens when transporting them."
5.0,Great product worked great
5.0,Love love all the pictures
5.0,Everything was great but Inhad to return it because it wasn’t the color I was looking for%

5.0,I like it.  It's very cute and easy to wear.  Very reasonable price.
5.0,This is a good sign
5.0,My daughter loves this wand! It’s really cute and lights up with different colors. The only thing that would’ve made this better was if it had music to it. Super cute though and perfect for any mermaid fans!
5.0,We ordered these for our 4 year old son. He hasn't tried them out yet. I like the color of them.  They feel a little snug so will have to see how they fit.

5.0,seems to be good quality and the price was perfect...
5.0,I love the look & size of this bag. I am able to carry everything I need in this one bag.
5.0,The strap is heavy and well made. I’ve not owned a mesh strap before and really love the feel on the wrist. It suits the Seiko SKX looks handsome. The first strap was lost by the mail (or stolen from our stoop) but the seller was fantastic and shipped another so this was a great experience all the way around.
5.0,Obey cured all my obedience problems.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful ♡
5.0,"This band is so much better than the buckle band I had.<br />Easy to install, comfortable and stylish.  Wish I found this when I first got my Fitbit.  Worth the money"
5.0,very good quality and fits well. it's very stretchy so buy a size smaller.
5.0,These are right on size. I ordered a size smaller from the reviews and theyre too small. Thats my bad though.
5.0,"This bracelet was a gift, and the recipient really loved it."
5.0,"Value for money , you get so many"
5.0,I love these earrings! So glamorous and classy. Perfect for dressing up a simple work outfit but I can see these pairing well with a dress and heels for a date night. Just beautiful!
5.0,fits great! order your normal size.
5.0,Bought this as a Halloween costume. The sizing is correct and the quality of the fabric is better than expected.
5.0,"These pants are the perfect lounge pants.  Thin enough for summer, soft and feel good on the skin.  Shipping was faster than anticipated, and they fit perfectly according to the size chart.  Will probably buy again if the company is still in business when these wear out."
5.0,"I own several Columbia shirt jackets, and this is my go to. Great for OR/Western climates where fall/winters are 30-60 most months."
5.0,"I love it. It Just looks like a fitness tracker! I think this fits the Go-tcha better than the wrist band. I decided to go with the ball and chain necklace after seeing the poor reviews on the other type. So far, so good."
5.0,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! the engraving is beautifully enscribed on the inside and it is a quality piece of jewlery for such a very agreeable price. Thank you so so much. It's absolutely wonderful.
5.0,"Love this,bought it for my daughter she looked so cute."
5.0,"I usually go up a size on Jammie’s but I went with the medium and both bottom and top fit comfortably. Fabric is soft, but I could live without the annoying tag on the side of the tank.<br />The cut is perfect for sleeping, didn’t seem to shift around and end up exposing one boob in the middle of the night like other tanks do!"
5.0,"These earrings are so beautiful, comfortable, and elegant! Bought for my teen niece and put them inside a clam shell trinket box I also bought so when she opens the box she will find these beautiful light weight earrings."
5.0,"Nice product for the price will buy again. They arrived in packages of 4 fingerlights containing red, white, blue and green. There was no damage at all and they worked good."
5.0,son Loves
5.0,I go one size up for this brand. This shirt is warm. Really warm. I work outside in the cold. This shirt is my secret weapon for battling the chills. Would love a matching pants underwear.<br /><br />I wear this on top of fleece long johns and winter coveralls. I am toasty all day.

5.0,Very well made. Looks quite expensive. Highly recommend.
5.0,Love the color and fit.  Great value.

5.0,Very nice quality. Perfect for the amphibia. Makes the watch much nicer!
5.0,"Love, love, love! I get so many compliments every time I wear this dress and it makes me feel girly and confident. Being a voluptuous woman, size 18, 40DD,  I was worried it would be tight about the arm pits and across the bust but it fit me wonderfully. The fabric is very light, so you may want to add dress weights as the skirt is very voluminous (in such a great way!). Just wish it had pockets. Buy it, you love it!"
5.0,"Daughter used for band concert. Very cute earrings, stayed in well."
5.0,Feels high quality. Butter smooth. Absolutely love the bands. So happy with my purchace!!

5.0,Love them and the slippers
5.0,"Super beautiful design. I wore it for about a year before I got a new one, but I still keep this one with me."
5.0,Awesome for a gift
5.0,"I bought both these flip-flops and Hoka’s sliders. Both are surprisingly comfortable but the flip-flops get the win. For some reason, my feet get uncomfortably hot in the sliders - it baffles me to be honest but I have to wear them in short stints whereas the flip-flops I can wear all day everyday. And yes, no discomfort between the toes. Good job, Hoka!"
5.0,Exactly as pictured. A pretty pink. A great value!
5.0,"Loved these, beautiful and holding up well."

5.0,They’re are perfect

Also very slimming. I’ll be buying a third this spring! I would highly recommend the sleeveless dress as well, that one is my favorite."
5.0,Great wallet.  Quality is good.  Also love that it has RFID blocking.
5.0,This too completes all sexy looks. It is sheer enough that it is not hot to go partying in but you can’t see your bra through the fabric.
5.0,"We purchased the Newborn size and thought they were definitely on the larger end of the NB spectrum, but they provided the perfect transition between NB and 3mo size for the majority of our clothes. This is thinner weight, but perfect for playing around the house."
5.0,They look great and price was great!!!
5.0,Great slipper.  Fits like a glove and is very comfortable

5.0,beautiful chain and great value
5.0,I love this bathing suit.  It fits amazing and the quality of the fabric is super nice.  I love that it has an extra layer of covering in the breast area which is perfect for those young girls that are in between.  This bathing suit will last for sure.
5.0,I just love walking my dog early morning knowing I can stay warm.  Can’t even tell I have an electric warmer built in.  Looks great and very comfortable to wear.

5.0,This is a great product. It is enough warmth especially when in a car driving if you don't like the bulk of a coat.
5.0,I purchased a medium. For reference I'm 5'4 & 125 lbs. very soft and comfortable fabric. the dress is loose fitting and flowy. I could of probably fit into a small but I like loose fitting clothes. I would recommend wearing this with a strapless bra or a cami underneath.
5.0,Kids love these.
5.0,I bought these for my daughter who plays college softball. She says they fit great-true to size. Soft fabric that breathes.
5.0,Love this lightweight jacket

5.0,Great inexpensive shoe for boys that are hard on shoes.  My child has wide feet and they fit great.
5.0,"I love Locs.  They look good on my big head, and they're more durable than most other sunglasses I've purchased.  I bought these to replace a pair I bought for 5 bucks at a gas station in 2009 and recently lost.<br />Combine that with the fact that they're some of the cheapest sunglasses on the market and you can't go wrong."
5.0,"love them, keeps my feet warm in this polar air we are receiving in Minnesota at this time. I will purchase again if needed."
5.0,"Love these pants!! They are a bit more sheer than expected, but nothing that would prevent me from wearing them.  They are airy, light, and so cute!"
5.0,I bought the black and I love it. It's soft and feminine.
5.0,My child is 8 and I was torn between ordering the child or adult size. A friend recommended these in the child size. It's a perfect fit for my 8yo and I would consider him to have a large head.
5.0,This looks great and is really well made! I strapped it to the crash bars of my Vulcan S 650 (a motorcycle) and it has been holding up wonderfully to freeway speeds and weather wear.
5.0,Nice material. Good size. Came in a timely manner.
5.0,best bifocal sunglasses ever!

5.0,"Excellent headband! Keeps my head dry and fits perfectly. Great price, solid product. Highly recommend as this is a no frills, spot on keep the sweat out if your eyes type of material."
5.0,I’m really impressed with the mask and its many features. Loads of static and animated masks on the app to upload to the face plate plus the ability to upload your own pics to be displayed. Add on to that graphic equaliser effects that react to music or your own voice. Also can scroll letters n symbols across the mask. My only problem with the mask was the inability to see well enough to walk around safely. I would like to see the shining app make more designs available in the future.
5.0,My wife loved these and they stand out !
5.0,"I can't say anything as to how durable this dress is, but if my wife only gets to wear it once, it will have been worth it. This dress looks absolutely amazing on my wife. It fit exactly as described, and I really couldn't be happier. Thank you."

5.0,"I love these,they fit great and make a world of difference in how I feel at the end of a 12 hour shift."
5.0,These shorts run a little small so I went a size larger and they fit just fine. They are well padded where they need to be and streamlined where they do not need to be padded.  Good value for the price.
5.0,It is very nice and quality is good. Little bigger on than expected holds almost 10-12 cards
5.0,"Love the hat, it was a gift for me and the fit is very good!"
5.0,I love it! I got so many compliments on it as well!
5.0,"Looks much better in person, would recommend"
5.0,Got this for my boyfriend’s mom also for next year
5.0,Great Watchband!!! I have had this for a few months now and I still love it! The quality is great for the price!
5.0,"I like these kinds of hats, but they are to hot in the summer. This one is very cool, looks nice and was a perfect fit, a great hat for the price."
5.0,You get five face covers in different colors. The colors are bright and pretty. The fabric is soft and breathable. They look well-made and like they will last for a while.
5.0,"Seriously an amazing product for the price! The gold plating is on the lighter side, certainly lighter than the picture but I love the shade of the metal personally!<br /><br />The highlight of the bracelet is the CZ stones for sure! The cut and shine of the stones stands up to other bracelets of higher retail price!<br /><br />The clasp is also quite solid at this price point, feels secure at all times and with a bit of practice clasping it becomes pretty easy!<br /><br />As for how long the plating and bracelet will last, I am unsure because I have only had it a week or so, I’ll update the review at some point. So far so good!<br /><br />Update: After a month of near daily use the gold plating and stones look just as nice as they did when I first got them! All I have to do is occasionally clean the bracelet with a dry soft cloth"
5.0,I've been looking for a dark pair of sunglasses for the beach for a very long time. These glasses are perfect and sooo affordable I bought a second pair to leave in my wife's car.<br /><br />Highly recommend for anyone looking for a really dark pair of inexpensive sunglasses.
5.0,Finally found a way to display my pocket watches.  Looks very nice.
5.0,Super cute! Daughter loves these!
5.0,My son loves this good material
5.0,"To be honest, ever since this necklace came... I've barely worn anything else. It's the perfect size and he adjustable cord makes it so you can wear any length! I love it."
5.0,Love this dress!! I’m 5’0 so it definitely hits the floor. But I do tie it up in the front. This dress is comfy. You can dress it up or down. Love it!!
5.0,"Worked perfectly, fit well, made well, and they stay lit the entire night and everyone loved them."
5.0,Works great! Exactly what I needed.
5.0,It's good color and size and leather softy.
5.0,Pros:<br />This is a gorgeous watch.  And the automatic time adjustment feature works well after a few days.  The watch can remain accurate as long as you follow the instructions given.<br /><br />The seller reached out to me and said that the outer ring is not supposed to turn.  I've gotten used to not using the ring since it is not a defect.
5.0,granddaughter loved
5.0,Great on the lake.
5.0,I'm obsessed with Star Wars and these earrings seem pretty top notch! I love that there is rose gold in these and I'll probably wear these for the rest of my life.
5.0,"These pants work great. I bought them for my fiance a little over a month ago as a surprise and she loves them. She has told me that they are one of her favorite pair of workout pants that she owns. I would recommend these to anyone. Although, be cautious when choosing a size because they fit just a little bit smaller than expected!"
5.0,"I have purchased many different compression socks from a number of brands and sellers, but by far these from HOFAM are the best fitting and finest workmanship. From now on these are the only I will purchase and wear!"
5.0,they stay up; some compression soaks do not. these are the best.
5.0,"Love these necklaces! Even though they're not real silver they've a very attractive finish to them. I like using these for my jewelry making. The beads slide on easily, they're cheaper than chains they sell for jewelry making and they're a lot prettier too!! Seller makes sure items are shipped out quickly for early delivery. Ordering was simple and the low price is phenomenal!!"
5.0,"Very nice, will be a great gift for my granddaughter."
5.0,Fun shirt...we were looking for something a little different and this was it!
5.0,Super comfortable!  Best mask I have purchased so far.  It’s cute and I can breathe through it. Thumbs up!
5.0,"Perfect for the introverts in my household. While that may not be the intent of the bands, being able to silently signal &quot;leave me alone&quot; is sometimes priceless. Glad to have contributed to charity, and will be able to talk about double-meaning (nope to hunger .... and interaction) to those who still (dammit) talk to us."
5.0,"It's small, and it looks really great, but you have to understand that it's small. Either you'll want it to be 7% larger (in linear dimension), or you'll get used to it, or you're a woman and it's sized appropriately.<br /><br />The shroud seems really properly made (for a piece of plastic).  The strap, also, is an excellent material.  Puts aftermarket strap sellers to shame.<br /><br />Small chapter ring misalignments. C'mon, Seiko.<br /><br />The black/white/steel coloring is absolutely dashing.  Doesn't look too tactical, to my taste.<br /><br />It's the best looking solar diver. The aesthetic is like that of the SKX007/SBCM023/SBBN015 in that every part of the design has a purpose. If you're a woman, it's a great option (the other colors are surely good too). If you're a man, you'll have to decide whether or not it's too small for you.  There are two problems for most men. One is, the bezel diameter is small, and it just feels like the whole watch could stand to be a bit larger.  The other is, the small lug to lug causes a floating watch head effect, but that has resolved itself as the strap broke in (or I just got used to it).  This wears a bit smaller than a square G-Shock like the GW-M5610.<br /><br />Update: Increased from 4 to 5 stars, after 9 months of ownership.  With a nylon strap, it's just great, and the drilled lugs made that change a breeze."
5.0,"So cute, so warm and comfy.  I get compliments on them all the time.  wash well too (fleece=no problem)"
5.0,The pendant is beautiful. I bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas. The only drawback is that it doesn't come with a gift box. I would have paid a little more if a gift box was offered.
5.0,Love it. Such soft leather.
5.0,This product worked great as a hat clip while I was on vacation. Attached to my backpack and clipped hat to it! Love it and was stopped by multiple people about it.
5.0,I sent this item to my daughter as a present. She loved it!
5.0,Looks like a nice collar.
5.0,The necklace (Music is Life) is beautiful - fine quality - and love the presentation with the vintage card and envelops - Thank You!  AJ
5.0,"Awesome, seriously the brand name dupes I have these from both sellers. Save your money and buy these instead."
5.0,"This jacket is Faux Suede but looks and feels like real suede. I love the satiny lining plus it has pockets! Always a win with me! The zipper is metal and zips up and down easily. I am 5'6"" and 130 lbs and I ordered a medium. I would say if you like your clothes on the looser side,  size up! I would recommend this jacket! 5 Stars!"
5.0,Awesome socks! You feel like there not on!
5.0,"Great item, as advertised, but smaller than expected."
5.0,Great glasses better than paying $20 at CVS
5.0,This sweater is soft. It's made of high quality materials. It fits to the body and has you looking your best.  Fits perfectly and gets all the compliments. A must have while it's colder out
5.0,I like the style of the sun glasses but they are a little to big for my face.
5.0,For a costume party.
5.0,I HAVE LOOKED FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOR THIS TYPE OF EYEGLASS CASE.
5.0,Loved them. Colors vibrant. Easy to work with
5.0,a little thin material but like flow of the fabric.
5.0,"One feels especially privileged while flaunting these bad boys. People may stare, yes, but feed on their jealousy and know that you are special... the Goose chose you for a reason."
5.0,Yo pedí XL y me quedó grande. La talla es correcta pero baje de peso y ahora soy M. Entonces las modificaré. Son tal cuál de hermosas.
5.0,"I got these to wear while 6 months pregnant haha (I'm petite, 139lbs 5""6' at this stage of pregnancy) and though they're not specifically for maternity, they work for me! They are SO much nicer than my Adidas pants of the same style--thicker and with a pocket that fits my phone. I'm going to buy more pairs!"
5.0,Goood quality jersey
5.0,Quality material and runs true to size. Great one piece swimsuit!
5.0,"Exactly what I've been looking for, flowy and not binding but yet sheer enough to see outfit I'll be wearing.  Lovely piece but IMO, price was a bit elevated for the product...but keeping it just the same."
5.0,"Really good quality, very comfortable and fit extremely well."
5.0,"Good product, just don't like the symbol on the side of the glasses.  Other than that, they are good."
5.0,Excellent product!!!!
5.0,I have this to a friend of mine who had to put her dog down and she loved it. Helps her keep her pup close to her heart.

5.0,7 year old daughter likes it.
5.0,Love everything about product
5.0,It's a really cute shirt! Fits as expected.
5.0,So far this bra has been amazing! The only thing is on me the bottom band rolls after a few hours it only does it in the front and only after several hours then I push it down and it’s fine
5.0,Great color and good fit. My feet and legs are very slim.
5.0,A little loose but really cute and stretches
5.0,Purchased for a friend. She says they fit well and are very comfortable. Quick delivery.
5.0,Bought this for my daughter in law she loves it and wears it all the time ! So cute!
5.0,We love how Reefs fit and they’re comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
5.0,My husband loved it! It was an anniversary gift. It fit perfectly and he wore it while it was raining and said the rain beaded off of the coat. He said he stayed warm all day also!!
5.0,Very impressed! Beautiful. Great quality. Holds up against my 9 month old constantly tugging at it! Would definitely purchase again.
5.0,Shipped quickly. The shirt is good quality and fits great. I get tons of comments and compliments when I wear it.
5.0,Omg this dress is gorgeous! So many compliments! Be careful though it brings out so many haters! Lol
5.0,I love them. They fit great and feel great and look great.
5.0,"I get so many complements on these leggings! They're a thick material, so they're nice and warm. I am short, so there's a little extra material, but I'm used to that by now. Very nice! I would buy again and again."
5.0,"I purchased this shirt for the summer schools 2019 aloha field day.  It fit a student perfectly who is a first grader, with very vibrant colors."
5.0,I like the fact that each belt has its own buckle.

5.0,So cut and dainty!
5.0,Bought the black and gray as gifts. Both were very well liked.
5.0,Kids loved it came with everything that you needed
5.0,I do love it....I wear a size 10pants and I bought this skirt in large ND it fits perfect...
5.0,"Its just a kick a hat, brand new, nothing was wrong with it, arrived earlier than expected"
5.0,"Comfy, fits well in all the right areas. Well made fabric. Hides my postpartum belly nicely."
5.0,I<br /> A 12 and this fit perfectly
5.0,It works like it should to make using leather laces go through the openings easily.
5.0,"Love these shirts, I purchased them to wear under my scrubs at work. I noticed that the blue looks so much like the purple, can't hardly tell them apart. It's ok though, because they are exactly what I was hoping for. I will defiantly be ordering more. Super fast shipping."
5.0,very good gloves jut what i needed
5.0,"Took the remotes out the package, hit the learn button on the garage opener, hit the button on the remote I wanted to be the one to open the garage door and Voila . . . piece of cake, the remote looks and feels like the OEM, comes with batteries and the price was right.  Very Pleased, another great Amazon purchase."
5.0,"I use these slippers for wandering around my porch, patio, and garden.  I ordered black slippers in 10.5 for men.  They're shiny and thick.  They're not plastic. They're not rubber.  It's somewhere in between.  For me, they're very comfortable to wear.  It's a loose fit which I personally like.  I have wide feet so if they're advertised that way, I would have agreed.  I would recommend these slippers if you just need something simple for walking around the house.<br /><br />That large fit isn't for everyone.<br />Pros :<br />-Comfortable<br />-Strong durable slippers<br />-Wide<br /><br />Cons :<br />-Large and loose fit are not for everyone"
5.0,"Beautiful dress. It is a wrap so plan ahead and wear shorts or something under it, but its a beautiful and comfortable fabric. I have gotten many compliments on this dress."
5.0,I was expecting cheap material. But it nice and thick
5.0,"Super cute, not the most durable but then again I knew that when I brought it. It’s such a great way to dress up my Apple Watch 💕"
5.0,Nice looking frame for the money.
5.0,Very cute and fun but lost a back the first time I put them on
5.0,"i got this for me n my boyfriend, we broke up before i gave it to him so i gave to my bsf n it’s super cute ☺️"
5.0,PattyBoutik Women's fashion is always on point.
5.0,"Very cool, I am happy that I bought this earring; I'm also happy that it doesn't require a piercing to use it :]"
5.0,I absolutely love this dress. I’m 5‘8“ and weigh 150 pounds and I got the large and it’s so comfortable and so well-made and I love it!
5.0,"I needed a new watchband in Grey, but I didn't want one that was wide. I love this band, I only wish it came in more than two colors!"
5.0,"Love these bags! Fold up small into a pouch, durable, and CUTE!"
5.0,He likes the light protection for his arms.
5.0,My son loves these shoes.  They fit perfectly and seem to be comfortable.
5.0,"I needed sth for after bath so I can quickly wrap around my wiggly 2 & 4yo which would stay in place. The fabric is very absorbent, not very thick and super soft as some towels but instead is lightweight which is good for smaller kids. I got size 6 for my 4yo and have to fold up the sleeves for now and it hits right around his knees."
5.0,buy any of them....they'll satisfy.
5.0,product as described. no issues
5.0,Gorgeous sunglasses!!! Exactly what Inwxpected
5.0,"I thought at that price they'd be cheaply made. They're not. Really sturdy, they feel like more expensive glasses. My lost pair cost over $100 (a gift, I'd never pay that much for a pair of sunglasses) and these are just as well made."
5.0,Fits perfectly! Very flattering.
5.0,Great skirt!!! All my friends liked. Only the waist is a little tight.
5.0,"Excelletn material, fit as expected"
5.0,The pants are nice. I ordered slims and they had the adjustable straps. They fit perfect in length and weren't baggy (sometimes slims tend to be too baggy).
5.0,"So cute and great quality! I was on the edge of sizes so went larger, it's a little big in the waist but the tie helps with that."
5.0,The size is just as I wanted! Plus this dress is made with elastic materials so it can fit a better range but it fits me just fine. The design is really cute and it looks really great. The black color makes it seem really formal. Sample provided for unbiased review.
5.0,I love mines haven’t turn color as yt
5.0,"It’s exactly what I expected, considering to buy it in a different color."
5.0,"All in all, for the price you pay, it’s a great deal. A headband, kunias, 2 of them, and plenty of stickers, a little less if not more then 20 stickers. Great product"
5.0,"Loved it, my little one also loves it"
5.0,"These are great for flowy shirts, that are not skin tight. They work great. The only reason I say not with skin tight shirts is it left a big ring around my nipple region that you could see through the shirt. And not white either, haha! I put on a white tank top and couldn't stop laughing. BUT for something like a summer dress or maxi, these are amazing. Very comfortable, I actually woke up the next day and went to take a shower and realized i slept in them and didn't even realize it until I saw myself in the mirror. So VERY comfortable, feels so much like real skin, I didn't even notice they were still on. They adhere really well, and have kept their tackiness. I just kept the little plastic box it came in to make it easy to store in my dresser. I've worn them a few times now and so far no trouble out of them minus the white shirts and skin tight shirts. I included some pictures (in clothes) so that you could see what I'm talking about. Overall, I would recommend these to a friend. I wish you couldn't see them through a shirt, but I'm thinking that might be the case with any nipple cover.<br /><br />***I received this product for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and review.

5.0,I ordered this sweater because it is very different. I like that it is technically a halter but fits like an off shoulder sweater. The material is quite thick despite the way it looks. I live in Michigan so I can't wear it alone but it's definitely a good buy for layers.
5.0,"Product is as expected with full documentation,,,,,,,all is well."
5.0,"This shirt runs large, but because of that you can wear a shirt underneath without any problems.  It’s nice and warm and the fabric is soft to touch."
5.0,"I like this coat so much. It is very neat, very warm inside, windproof .  It's so cute.  I love it."
5.0,No stains its great
5.0,Not to big or bulky for smaller children hunting rocks to use at the beach.
5.0,"Fit great, slide on easily over leggings. Wish I'd gotten more colors!"
5.0,They are good for the price. Very nice item. Would recommend.
5.0,Just like the picture. 🤗
5.0,Love V-Neck shirts. This one fits perfectly.
5.0,"I love the coffee cup and mug print. Easy to put on, very soft and just feel great on."
5.0,It arrived in good shape but It is probably better suited for men. Way too big for me. Customer service was top notch. They immediately reached out regarding the size issue!
5.0,I took my first trip out of the country with new suitcase.<br />The suitcase held up well.<br />Very easy to identify in the baggage claim area.
5.0,They were handy during my recovery from surgery.
5.0,I like the look of the watch although the band is a bit too small. I am using the one to last adjustment and I do not have a big wrist
5.0,I like it because it snapped right onto my bracelet with no issues
5.0,I Love the way they fit and They are truly effective
5.0,The dress was a great fit!
5.0,"I am really pleased with this set.  The hat is darling.  The mittens are very nice too.  Lovely stitch-work really make it pretty.  Unfortunately, baby lost one of the mittens the first time we wore them as there is nothing to really keep them secured on her.  I didn't want to throw the lone mitten away because it's so pretty, so now I use it as a stick shift cozy in my car :)"
5.0,Great 👌 fit.
5.0,"Ok so I bought that organiser following a recommendation from one of those &#34;25 Brilliant Hacks For Travellers That Will Blow Your Mind&#34; (I know...)<br />When this arrived in the mail I immediately hated it - it seems overly complex to hold a few cables, I didn't like the stiffness of the product, the back pocket was flimsy, and it seems a bit over the top to hold a few electronic trinkets.<br /><br />Then I gave it a go, played a bit of Tetris to make it everything fit - OMG I can't live without it anymore!<br />It really holds all those bits and pieces which where swimming in my handheld luggage before (I fly a lot), I can even plug my portable hard drive without taking it out of the organiser.<br />Those sticky little threads weaved through the straps really hold everything together well, nothing has slipped out yet and I take it in and out of my bag on a daily basis. The back pocket still look flimsy, and I only use it for those pesky receipts to make my expense report later.<br /><br />Added bonus, it impresses my clients (look how organised I am! A good sign for our future collaboration!) more than the tangle of cables that was emerging from my bag before, and even if it makes me look like a nerd (nerd power!), at least I look like an organised and efficient nerd."
5.0,"I have to be honest...I hesitated buying this piece.  I was looking for a tassle necklace and this one looked nice, but maybe a bit too chuncky/heavy for my taste.  I just received it today and I LOVE IT!  It is very pretty on, has a nice weight to it (lays nicely without flouncing about but doesn't feel too heavy), and is a great length.  Looking forward to wearing it to work tomorrow!"
5.0,Love it adorable and adjustable back strap !
5.0,"Bought as gift, it was well received, and came plenty of time for gift giving.... It was for a teenager and she loved it...."
5.0,A mask mandate was made at my sons school. He asked for these so he wouldn’t have to wear paper masks. They serve the purpose they were intended for.
5.0,"I love this watch. Simple, classic, dependable, comfortable, AFFORDABLE. If you just need a watch you won't worry about (and prefer digital timekeeping to avoid cheap analog watch ticking), this is it!"
5.0,Love the way it feels and fit
5.0,I got so many compliments on this bag.
5.0,The wallet came just as pictured. The leather and stitching is beautiful and well made.

5.0,It's beautiful but the chains too short. Just going to buy another chain
5.0,"I've had the ring about a week now and I still really like it. I wear it as a thumb ring on my left hand. My thumb is a size 7 and it came already fitting it pretty well (a little on the loose side), so I didn't need to adjust it. It has not turned my thumb green, like I was afraid it would, and it's held up well through all my hand washing. Edges are a bit rough, not smooth like a typical ring, but it hasn't bothered me.  It feels really well made,  very durable.  Overall, I am really pleased with it."
5.0,"it was a long wait, but finely came today.. the neck line isn't the same as the picture & i have long arms so it's not really a long sleave on me, unless i put it down, but of cause it rises up.. but never the less i love this top, the bunny is made up of roses, which is great since i love all things nature.. it's so cute.."
5.0,"I used these flowers on my cat collars. As you can see from the photo, they really look cute."

5.0,"I love this pant/ skirt. It fits well, is very comfortable and just fun to wear!"
5.0,"I love rose gold, and this is perfect for me."
5.0,"All the newer lashes pretty much use the same silicone and wire attachments. Where this stands out is its small gauge, meaning less obtrusive and its flexibility meaning comfort."
5.0,"I absolutely love the fit! I purchased a large, I'm 174lbs with a heavier chest. I still have plenty of room. I love the brown color and think I'll order more!"
5.0,"I love this Cudi shirt. It has been one of my favorites for years, and has held up great even with frequent washings. The material is so soft and is a perfect fit. The image is printed so well and is super crisp and detailed. I am super please with this shirt!"

5.0,They look really nice. The only worry I have with them is the chain. It doesn't feel very strong but that's only a minor issue and can be easily fixed.
5.0,I wore this out to a new years eve party last night and got so many compliments! The crystals are really pretty and the beadwork is nice. Would definitely recommend the 5 wraps. The quality is good and i've seen similar ones on Etsy for twice as much.
5.0,"Fits true to size, and it’s so cute! My daughter loves the unicorn."
5.0,"I went back and forth about buying this bracelet and finally decided to. When it arrived quite quickly, I was delighted with the size and fit of it--not petite but rather substantial and heavier than you would think, which I like. It is beautiful. But I wanted to let other prospective buyers know that, though it could vary from screen to screen, I would say the pictured bracelet leaves the impression of being pretty close to white, though the description says silver, whereas the bracelet itself is actually closer to a silvery ivory and definitely closer to silver than pure white. So, just a heads up if your heart's set on white. Nevertheless, this bracelet is indeed gorgeous."
5.0,"love it. i am ordering it in different colors, price is good and the product is great., just the right size, not too heavy but can carry a lot, my kindle, phone, can of pop or bottle of water."
5.0,Comfortable pretty dress
5.0,"This kimono is beautiful! I ordered it for a Halloween costume, but will definitely wear it on a regular basis. I got a lot of compliments...very classy and good quality."
5.0,This tracksuit is great for the value.  Be sure to dry clean or allow it to air dry when cleaning.
5.0,Fit my existing glasses nicely.
5.0,This is so soft and so flattering! The color is rich and vibrant. Apologies for the photo in a room with active construction but that’s life 🤷‍♀️
5.0,"These fit well and seem flexible for a variety of heights and weights. Though only 5'2&#34; tall, I usually purchase a size L because I do not want to have tight, uncomfortable clothes on all day. I also appreciated the selection of prints-- the one chosen is a little different, yet it is not distractingly so."
5.0,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this top. I get so many compliments on it! (I got the ""multicolor2""). Very bright and bold, soft, and it fits perfectly. I'm a size 14 and I ordered the XL. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: I also ordered this in the ""blue"" in XL and it was a totally different material and fit. It was way too small, so I had to return it."
5.0,I love it! It's exactly what I wanted and I can fit everything I need in it plus more!!!
5.0,So soft! And fits so well! I absolutely love it!
5.0,Gorgeous kimono! Great quality and just a beautiful piece! Can't beat the price!

5.0,Love❤ Fits perfect!
5.0,I wear a size 9.5 normally and love low rise socks but can ONLY wear the Skechers brand because all the others slip down into my shoe which is beyond irritating. These socks were just as good as the Skechers socks I buy in the shoe store.
5.0,These look and feel similar to other sunglasses I've purchased for way more money!
5.0,The jeans are very beautiful o love them
5.0,Very nice sad though there is already a tear on the seam of the arm do not know if it came that way im going to contact seller Ill keep you posted.....great Kimono otherwise.......great price!
5.0,I love this ring!! Such a great buy. I bought it to symbolize my 100lb weight loss and tie into Princess Merida from the movie Brave! The rope design on the side and intertwining metal represents being strong and brave throughout my journey. Amazing product!!
5.0,"Cufflinks arrived well before expected time frame, my groomsmen loved them all, just the right touch of nerdiness to go with my wedding day.  They looked great and I'd buy from this company again for sure."
5.0,"Really fun to wear. Bought one for myself and Daughter to wear while cooking before and on Thanksgiving. Nice and sturdy and, has nice pockets."
5.0,"We've had great luck with these slippers. So much so, that I've purchased 3 pair. I purchased one pair for school for my son (they wear indoor shoes), one pair for home and an additional pair for next year. They are soft, durable and have made it through a wash in the washer (we have a front loader and I put them in a pillow case.<br />My son loves them. Great price and highly recommend!"
5.0,Sizing is only the flow. Go AT LEAST one size up.

5.0,It’s was very good quality I will recommend to anyone
5.0,Really pretty on and not heavy.
5.0,Love my ladybug dress!!!
5.0,Love this little blazer. Paired it with a white t shirt some blue jeans and loafers. My little man looked so handsome for his school pictures. Fit him perfectly. He said it was comfy to the point it was a fight to take it off cause he just loved all the little compliments he was getting!
5.0,Zipper and case still in good shape after over a year's worth of daily use.  bright pink color easy to find in my huge purse!
5.0,"This is perfect. It’s pretty small, but can still hold your phone, a checkbook wallet, keys and a bottle of water. For under $10 it’s a very good deal."
5.0,"The case is nice and as described. Love the bright blue color as it makes for an easier find in my purse. The fabric is nice and the hinges close securely to keep even your most expensive glasses protected. The item arrived in a very timely fashion, a day before it was even expected. Very satisfied-thank you."
5.0,I love the soft feel and flow of this beautiful top. I will search for more of this brand as they are made in the United States.
5.0,I love the way they fit. No need to pierce your ear and they stay on.
5.0,These little earrings are exactly what I expected!! They are the perfect size and they are beautiful!! They sparkle quite a bit!!

5.0,Very comfortable and has nice storage for small items.
5.0,Very good quality. Love them
5.0,tough to put on the first time but it works
5.0,I do love this top. It's one of my favorites. ONLY issue is the pockets push out sometimes. But that's not a huge deal at all.
5.0,"Night these because my sons regular socks would rub the top of his foot red and raw no matter how many different types of shoes, straps, and leaves I bought. He could not wear his AFO more than 4 hours. Yesterday he wore them for 6 without complaining. Slight pink instead of bright red in top of his foot. I think I finally found the answer. I will change this review if it worsens."
5.0,Nice and light. Easier to breathe in when you have to wear all day
5.0,Great thick quality fabric. My 3 year old doesn’t want to take it off! Loves it and will order another!

5.0,Fantastic idea that works!!

5.0,Love the colors and fit. Very cozy
5.0,"This ring is  beautiful, it is a substantial size ring for the beautiful silver that it is.<br />I think because of the wideness of the ring I would size up..a 9,I ordered fit more like an 8 however I love it as a middle finger ring as well.<br />SMOOTH profile,can comfortably be worn everyday.<br />And of course,adore the triquestras on both sides of my birthstone!!<br />Thrilled..fast delivery,beautiful gift quality packaging, and a ring I will enjoy for a long time,for it is timeless☺"
5.0,Great glasses wish they were a little wider cause my eyelashes hit the goam
5.0,I love this belt.  The elastic makes it adjustable but the material doesn't make it look cheap.  Clasp is really cute and flattering. A+
5.0,Love these maxies. Will be purchasing more colors.
5.0,"This is a beautiful gold plated necklace. It is of two attached chains, a paperclip and a tiny beaded chain. I think that this would be great for everyday wear. It has a lobster style clasp and seems secure."
5.0,These are Korean sizes. I got a large.. anything bigger take the chance on the colors.
5.0,I got this for my friend. She really liked and every LAX practice she wears it. Also its the colors of our team. Perfect.<br /><br />Happy Friend:)
5.0,Love it. I'm pleased with everything I've bought from amazon! Thank you
5.0,"This facemask is exactly what my husband wanted! It is lightweight and the fabric stretches so it can be adjusted exactly where you want it to be. Have ordered more for gifts and one for myself. Plus, with needing to wear masks, this doubles as a mask and a warm face covering!"
5.0,works well in mild pain
5.0,I loved the way this dress fit my body. I didn't even have to wear my girdle.
5.0,Beautiful fit! Just what I wanted!
5.0,So happy with purchase
5.0,"Very, very elegant necklace. The earrings were beautiful, too. Very happy with my purchase. Thinking of buying another for my daughter."
5.0,Es muy bueno pero la tela no sede así toma eso en cuenta antes de comprarlo
5.0,"Bought sweatshirt for my daughter birthday in July, I thought it would be perfect for her,  she have a sixteen year old, and winter will be here before you know it."
5.0,"Super cute, I get lots of compliments on the"
5.0,I found these underware to be my best buddies  for sleeping ( next to my dogs and they love the softness and warmth)...for me the fit is perfect!
5.0,They are cute and dainty.  I love them!!
5.0,"The socks are great and very unique. The only problem I have (completely my fault for not paying attention) is that they are way too big, I didn't notice it said SIZE L. Great socks though, I'm gonna give them to one of my guy friends."
5.0,I really love this necklace.  I think it is beautiful and comfortable and healing.  I would highly recommend it.
5.0,"I""m 5'5 and 140 lbs I ordered Medium and the fit great. Most mediums are a little shorter but with elastic on the bottom it doesn't matter. Has 2 front pockets bit enough for my phone. They""re not to thick or thin perfect for spring or fall. They didn't shrink or fade after washing."
5.0,"I finally wore this today and I love it! It does have a retro look, but that suites my retro body perfectly! The skirt flares just like in the photos. Obviously, I haven't cleaned it but I hope the pleats stand up. I am 34B-30-36, for reference"
5.0,"It's a great robe, would recommend to anyone. My XXL husband didn't fit in it, one size fit doesn't go that high."
5.0,They look amazing! And fit perfectly
5.0,[[VIDEOID:ee9d5f3242476201cb24072212987826]] These are a cool pair of shorts for summer.  Very lightweight and breathable.  They have zippered pockets and a draw string.  They fit as expected.  And the come as a 2 pack!<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
5.0,"These are great, exactly what I was looking for. Such a reasonable price, plus polarized - cant beat that. The gray is more of a black, which is exactly what I wanted. I ordered them intentionally knowing they would appear black based off of other reviews."
5.0,"Happy with this purchase. I am usually a size S for American clothing, but bought a size L and the fit was perfect. I am 5’3” and 120 pounds."
5.0,Very pretty and arrived quickly!
5.0,Beautiful and you can't beat that price! Love it :)
5.0,Sexy and cute dress love it fit as expected.
5.0,Great quality. Just as described. Love the size.
5.0,Grandson loves. it!!:
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet!! Full of gorgeous Chakra stones, this bracelet is stunning, full of color, and fits to your wrist with an easily adjustable tug. The natural stones are shiny and *vibrant*. And unlike another Chakra bracelet I tried, this one DOESN'T pinch your arm or arm hair (praise jesus). It seems extremely well made, weighty, and, as I said, just stunning. It's very quality and totally worth the price. Would buy again, and I totally recommend! Also very giftable."
5.0,My Dad loved it for his 88th birthday!
5.0,Love this dress great for golf fits perfectly! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
5.0,"Fits well, it’s made of stretchy fabric too! Not see through. I’m a 32B and it’s pretty cute, but I’ll probably wear it with a push up when I do get a chance to wear it! Super comfortable!"
5.0,Love this bracelet! It is exactly what I wanted. Wish I could give extra stars for the two additional freebies that were given to me ( two stones that will be a great addition for me!) I look forward to purchasing more from this vendor.
5.0,I ordered these to match our boys' Christmas Shirts and they will fit both boys 6 & 8 wonderfully (and match the black/white/grey dress shirts).
5.0,"This purse is so nice.  Great quality, holds up well, it has traveled around the country with me and I get so many complements on it.  No complaints here.  My 4th Jessica Simpson purse!!"
5.0,"I got these for my friend who is obsessed with Studio Ghibli (as am I) and she loves them. She wears the grey ones the most because they match her shoes which she wears every day, but she wears all of them, and she has told me that they are very nice to sleep in during the winter. I might get them for myself someday."
5.0,The ring has decent weight from the tungsten and the quality of the ring is great for the price range.  It seems quite durable and comfortable to wear.  Most of my current rings are carbon fiber and titanium but I got used to the weight pretty fast.  It looks even better in person.
5.0,"Love the color dark green, and it’s a perfect match for my watch. The quick band made it simple to put on the watch, even for me.<br />Excellent quality and very pleased."
5.0,great product and came as promised
5.0,"Comfortable, nice color and good pockets. Strong zipper."
5.0,"This patio sun umbrella is perfect for our outside dining area. The material is enough to keep the bright sun from bearing down and the navy blue color matches our furniture cushions. Easy to put up and sown, swivel and tilt for whichever way the sun is shining. We also order the additional base for sturdiness and the unit is extremely stable. Highly recommend; can’t beat the price!"
5.0,Extremely light and comfortable. Seems to fit any body shape
5.0,beautiful my aunt loved this piece. i will order from the designer in the future.
5.0,"The lace is a perfect match to the ribbed, silky top.  It's really lovely in person."
5.0,Super soft and cushy very comfy so pretty love these sleepers great as gift as well
5.0,Love this organizer! I bought two of them. Really helps when I'm using a big purse.
5.0,"Nice vented mesh and big brim.  Floppier than described, so it's kind of hard to shape it how you'd want.  However, it's a nice sun hat.  Only other thing I'd say is that it took too long to get to me.  Almost a month.  OK if you're not in a rush, though."
5.0,I love theses tote bags for groceries or home storage
5.0,casio is casio anyway
5.0,"Inlove this dress so much! From what the reviews said, I ordered one size up. Normally a small, 5'3&#34; 116 lbs. very flattering!"
5.0,Very impressed with these charms ! We’re getting ready to go to our Disney trip and we are so happy with these charms ! Had a couple that came a little dirty and some that the characters eyes were not right looking but overall happy . I think if they were to do a bundle of all Disney characters they would be a big hit !! Love love them as well did my daughter .
5.0,It’s so nice not to have to take off my sunglasses to put on my readers
5.0,"NinaQueen offered this as a gift to me because UPS sent back a package that was damaged. Amazon added three items in a same box and one was glass, it broke so all items were sent back. I ordered a charm that is no longer available so NinaQueen offered this when they had no fault in charm not being received. The Nutcracker charms fits perfectly on a Pandora bracelet. The charm is as nice as any we could have bought from anywhere else. It is detailed and has a decent weight to it. Looks great. It will be a great gift for my wife. Thanks NinaQueen"
5.0,"I love these as I am warm AND comfortable.  Nothing is too long, too short, too tight or miserable in any way.  They wash and dry in my machines with no problem or necessary  ""special"" treatment.  Colors do NOT run & there is no shrinkage.  I've told my friends how pleased I am with them, so more customers might be taking advantage of these easy-going duds next winter."
5.0,Perfect and beautiful jacket
5.0,These sunglasses are great for the mysterious and beautiful look but also good for hiding bags under your eyes on those worn out tired kind of days. They are comfortable and classy. I'm glad I have them.
5.0,"I am a 9-9.5, so I got 8-9... Fit perfectly!!!!!😏😏😏"
5.0,Love these shorts! I bought Two colors. Recommend sizing up!! They’re slightly tighter fitting around the waist. I’m usuallg a medium in bottoms but had to get a large here. Such good material and great tummy control
5.0,"The other reviews were all true. These pants are fantastic. Amazing price point and the quality is better than I expected. They're very flattering ankle pants and provide a slight slimming effect. The color is also a true navy, looks exactly as the picture."
5.0,"I ordered these leggings for our family Halloween costumes as the Incredibles. They fit perfectly and have plenty of stretch. No funny lumps or bumps. They were warm and not at ALL see thru. The red color was vibrant. Unfortunately they are long for capris. I'm 5'2 and knew they would for me as regular length leggings but even then, there was extra length at the end.<br /><br />These were such good leggings that I kept them for normal wear after Halloween. I'm super glad I  ordered these because ask the ones I found at the stores were more expensive and the quality was not par with these."
5.0,I get a lot of compliments on these socks. I ordered a second pair as a gift.
5.0,"good fit, easy to use, and sturdy"
5.0,Great skirt! Nice soft material holds up well after washing several times. Runs very small. My daughter wears a small or size 6 in skirts and the XL fit her.
5.0,Chain looks good.... Worth buying
5.0,"Like the watch, but... it is big. I know big wrist watches are fashionable these days, but having a small wrist & a big watch?. The knobs also rub against my wrist base. The site gave a 4.5 mm measurement for the face plate, but add the tab base for the watch band & you end up with a length of 5.5 mm. What I've been looking... for ever, is an affordable women size chronograph with the features of this one (24 hour dial, day date, etc.); to no avail. Black, black silicon band... , well; that would be ideal. In '08 I was at Shenzhen's huge mall by the train/bus terminal & they have a floor just for watches. No luck finding a women's ""old style"" chronograph with 2 or 3 extra dials. Did got a ""Bolex"", but no women Citizen or Seiko counterpart (much less a women's ""Bolex"", ""Rulova' or an ""Omiga""). Still, I'm keeping this Lige. It is a great brand & hopefully one day hey will make a watch that is totally what I'm looking for."
5.0,Works great with my Fitbit and came in my favorite color
5.0,I've been using this bag for a few weeks and so far I love it. It's my &#34;work bag&#34; that I use to take all my stuff to work and it is very handy for me because I take public transportation. It looks classy and professional and it is very sturdy
5.0,"This watch band is really pretty. It’s dainty and delicate. It’s not really an every day band, but it’s perfect for special occasions to dress up my watch. The color is a pretty good match."
5.0,Great bags. Very sturdy and have held together well.
5.0,"Not bad at all. It holds your hair back exactly like it is supposed to. I just got it and it seems like if you use it how it should be used, you should have no problems with it in the future. Fair price also because you get two!"
5.0,"Good quality, exactly as described!"
5.0,These are too cute. I water fast and whenever I do I wear my water bottle earrings.
5.0,"Like most people, I have a car key that stays in my purse.  But, when I valet park or take my car to the car wash, I want to quickly remove my key fob to leave with the valet.  You can easily remove and add keys without ruining your manicure.  Love the color too."
5.0,"Worked well for my five year-old twins. They used them for skiing. They are full sized. Not high end, but they got the job done"
5.0,Sooooo soft and comfy
5.0,This dress was amazing! I'm 5'7 190 pounds I purchased an extra large .I wore it for New Year's Eve I recieved so many compliments.
5.0,"NOTHING IS MORE COMFORTABLE! LOVE THESE! ideally a shorter inseam would be great for me personally at 29 to 30&#34; in the large, but everything else about these jeans is the reason why they are my go to pants for allday everyday whenever possible . i wear the extreme comfort pants from Lee and they are the most comfortable actual jeans ever when i need durability as a carpenter, but these are the most comfortable of everything i have ever tried hands down, even though they are a little long for me. i am normally 36 to 38&#34; waist and a little loose when i am 36&#34; and still perfect when i go to 38&#34;. Fantastic when you dont like the tight feeling around your waist sitting or squating, etc i have purchased my second pair in black because they look like real jeans, i will try the lighter color asap but feel they may not look as real as jeans, but i will see."
5.0,"Second pair I've owned, love these sunglasses, kinda upset spy does not make them anymore"
5.0,"Okay, instantly taking this shirt out of the packaging, it feels like amazingly luxurious soft cotton. I wanted to immediately put it on my body and wear it forever... it’s far more comfortable than any other performance mesh golf shirts, which up to this point I always preferred over cotton t shirts, however, this cotton shirt is soft, breathable, flexible, and the fabric keeps you snuggly warm in the crisp mornings, but nice and cool after a afternoon hike... out performing the performance mesh golf shirts I used to wear, which fabric seems to either be super cold against my skin in the mornings or super hot under the mid-day sun. This fabric doesn’t do that. It keeps u warm when ur cold, and keeps the heat off ur skin when ur standing in the blistering sun. This shirt is my new favorite thing."
5.0,Just amazing love it. Great job guys
5.0,Bought this as a last minute piece of my daughter’s costume. It served its purpose. No issues. Clip is sturdy.
5.0,I really like this somewhat vintage dress. The top is a little see through but a cami underneath will fix it. I’m 5’5’’ so the hem hits slightly below mid calf.
5.0,Great ties for little ones.  They are small and thin so good for super young and fine hair.
5.0,This is by far my favorite outfit and looks amazing
5.0,These are awesome! It's great that they are polarized and the softness helps them stay on. I have a 25 month old and they fit well and seem like they would for some time.
5.0,"This is a great shower flip flop. It is great when I go to the gym and need a quick drying sandal. No foam / faux leather that soaks in water. I also use it for light activities like getting my mail in the summer. However, I wouldn't use this as a walking flip flop. It isn't sturdy enough. I wear a size 12 normally but had to return and buy a size 13. I recommend buying 1 size up."
5.0,"Great bag. Very fashionable, nice canvas fabric."
5.0,My son loves these and we have ordered additional colors. Very sturdy and well made!
5.0,These small hoop earring are perfect for a second piercing. I sleep in them and they have yet to fall out of my ears. They pair well with other silver jewelry and I've gotten lots of compliments. These are my new favorite pair of earrings!
5.0,great deal it is hard to tell them apart from my maui jims
5.0,Love thispurse. I have received many compliments.
5.0,"Nice....good ring for the money. Would like it if the stones were bigger and brighter. But for the money, it works. Happy."
5.0,Solid overall shorts. Zip pocket are great to keep you phone or wallet in. Good length. Bought 3 pairs.
5.0,"Great fit, true to size and very flattering. Looks even better with a belt, I bought in black too."
5.0,Love this brand of socks!  I started using them when I was doing yoga.  Helped me not to slip on the mats (or studio floor).  I had tried other brands but the socks were either too thick or the grippers stopped working after a couple of laundry cycles.  The socks wear great.  I now also use them around the house when it is too cold to walk barefoot.  I highly recommend these socks.
5.0,"I should have purchased these years ago - and I will never do an long/medium distance flight again without them!  Perfectly comfortable on a nine hour flight with absolutely no lower leg puffiness or discomfort.  Left the plane feeling wonderful. If you fly, do yourself a favour and get a pair of these.  I cannot believe you will regret it!  Thank you Wanderlust!!!!"
5.0,The hat comes with this awesome plastic inside liner that protects the hat's shape I use it with all my hats now... IF anything this hat is worth buying just for the plastic thing lol.
5.0,She wears it all the time &lt;3
5.0,"Everything I expected.  Little big for 37 waist, but works like champ."
5.0,"The Coach Sunglasses are awesome!  Great quality, Nice dark gradient tint.  The gkasses were packed in their case and in a box inside the padded envelope, so had good protection and arrived quickly.<br />Unfortunately I will be returning these glasses as another pair I ordered looked better on me."
5.0,"I like that this is a wool top that is not itchy and that when I get a hot flash, it will dry my skin."
5.0,"Because I travel at least once a month, this is nice because I just leave all my travel items in here, including an extra phone charger so I never need to worry about forgetting anything."
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful! A very fine thin chain. If you want something large, this is not it, but this one is stunning."
5.0,"Got soooo many compliments from complete strangers at Northern Virginias biggest horse race, Gold Cup! Great purchase, and arrived quickly, within days of order. Thanks!"
5.0,The item was as advertised. My wife absolutely loved it. Customer service is top notch. I will order from here again.
5.0,This blouse fits great! It's very comfortable I will be getting other colors!
5.0,I bought those for my son as a xmas gift. he loves them.
5.0,I was worried about the one size fits most but it worked out great.<br />Absolutely great purchase. And I felt amazing in it.
5.0,"These glasses are light weight, comfortable and attractive. Excellent value. Work great!"
5.0,"Chicken saddle are made with good material and quality, they look fancy and cute 😍👌<br />Saddle came right on time!<br />Fits perfectly on 2 of my hens the other hen just keep removing it."
5.0,Great addition to my dooney and Burke bag
5.0,"I’m slender build with long arms, the Large is an excellent fit, very nice  garment"
5.0,"I can not tell you how much I love this dress. I was a little concerned about the fit. Since the largest they come is a xxl, and I’m a 2x. Also, amazon clothes tend to run small. However, the fit is perfect. I’m actually ordering another one in a different pattern.<br />These are PERFECT for Summer. I’ve worn it twice, and gotten so many complements."
5.0,Several cute items good quality for a great price. So much less expensive than shopping at a Sanrio store! Also Kuromi items are hard to find. My daughter loved everything!
5.0,My 11 year old daughter loves these masks. She wears them daily to school and said they fit her perfect.
5.0,"I love this ring! It is very well made for such an amazing price, I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Well its cute tho. Her shoes didn’t arrive on time so even without the shoes it still looks good ne ause or the lace. :)
5.0,"I honestly LOVE these. They’re softer and far better quality than I expected for the price. The material does stretch, so I would suggest sizing down one size. Otherwise they do experience some stretch and sag after you wear them once or twice. I ordered a size up to be safe and somewhat regret it. The drawstrings do help a lot."
5.0,"I liked the size and quality of the pendant. I would like earrings of matching design that would be slightly smaller, but with the same lovely design and quality."
5.0,"This is a durable, lightweight windbreaker that is easy to jog in while keeping the rain off you. It's got a double-zipper, mesh inner lining for some airflow, and a secret hood compartment.<br /><br />I recommend this white color if you like to jog at night; it's pretty easy to see in the dark."
5.0,"I spent two weeks this January in Vermont and Massachesttes during a very cold period even for these states.  The Polar Extreme Thermal Fleece Stocking cap saved the day.  It is one of the warmest caps I have ever owned.  To stay the least, I was very impressed with this purchase."
5.0,This is a beautiful dress! It is true to photos and there were no surprises. Perfect fit!
5.0,Exactly what I needed. Fun colors and great quality.
5.0,"This is such a beautiful set of matching necklaces for a couple. I was so impressed with the elegance of this set because the price they are listed for is so reasonable.<br /><br />Not only are the necklaces themselves beautiful but they arrive beautifully gift boxed so that you are proud to give them as a gift. These are every bit as pretty, if not prettier, than the images that are shown in the listing. The gift box is champagne colored with the look of a quilted pillow top, and Startista and their logo are embossed in gold. Inside, the necklaces lay side by side on black velvet.<br /><br />&quot;His&quot; necklace chain is 20 inches long and 3 mm wide. The ring pendants are 24 mm. &quot;Hers&quot; is 17.8 inches long and 2.2 mm wide. Her ring pendants are just slightly smaller at 22 mm. Both necklaces are made from 316L Titanium Steel and contain CZ crystals. They are hypoallergenic and nickel free.<br /><br />&quot;Real Love&quot; and &quot;My Only Love&quot; are engraved in the ring pendants. This would be such a beautiful, meaningful gift for a couple getting married or having an anniversary, It would also be a wonderful gift for your spouse for any occasion or no occasion at all.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this wonderful set of necklaces with ring pendants, so very nice.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in a special promotion. My review, my opinion, and experience is honest and 100% genuine. Photos to follow."
5.0,"Love this dress. Ordered in 3 colors. It's professional but casual. I did order a size larger based on the other reviews, and I'm glad I did. My usual size probably would have fit but it would have been uncomfortably tight and not flattering."
5.0,The School Mascot is Tigers ... They are Perfect for Earrings... and two sided...
5.0,This umbrella is amazing.  The umbrella is made from a very durable fabric and very sturdy.  The umbrella is easy to open and close and I compact that it can be carried in your purse.  When the water hit the top the lips turn to a pretty pink color. This is the perfect umbrella for a girly girl.
5.0,"These are very giftable. They come with a gift bag and hinged box, plus a little pouch. They are very pretty and catch the light really well. They could easily be worn with a casual outfit, to the office, or with a more dressy outfit. I'm very happy with them. The size is really good for me. They are not really big but are also not tiny."
5.0,"Not disappointed, looks exactly as pictured. Great quality leather."
5.0,"This dress is light, nice and hugs you beautifully. The only problem it's a little bit see through."
5.0,This beautiful blue Stetson and Dobbs Hat is a game changer. This hat will enhance a dapper gentleman's appearance.
5.0,"I've had this wallet for about a month now and I love it! I don't like carrying wallets and for the longest times I was carrying my cards in my pocket.  The problem with that is that they got destroyed over time with keys and change; or I would simply lose them.  This wallet is so thin that I don't notice it in my pocket.  If you're simple like me and only want to carry an ID, a credit card or two, a medical card, and a transit card, this is perfect!"
5.0,I LOVE this dress - it fits beautifully. Make sure you go by the seller's sizing and not your normal sizing. I typically we're a 10-12 but ordered the dress in a 2xl and it was perfect. Will probably order this in more colors
5.0,I really like them. I'm definitely going to order them again.
5.0,Would definitely purchase again! Wore this to a Halloween party I was so happy with the outcome

5.0,Very nice quality shoes. Comfortable. Love them.
5.0,Cute and looks like the photo
5.0,"Item as pictured. The gem inside can be taken out and you can purchase aromatherapy inserts to put inside - we did not do that but could be a nice option. Shipped on time. Nice weight to gem and necklace. I purchased 2 of them. I gave one to a boy who wears size youth size husky 14 and another boy who wears youth size 8 regular- the necklace length was appropriate length for both of them and something they could wear as they grow too. If needed, I would purchase again. Appropriately priced for quality. We've had them for a couple months and they have not tarnished."
5.0,These looks just like the real thing!
5.0,"One of the best looking Dodger hats! Bought this for my husband.  He gets compliments all the time. If you’re looking for a new Dodger hat, I highly recommend this one!"

5.0,"Got these dresses on sale $9 each! Amazing buy...beautiful. Wear size 12/14 36dd  31.5 waist 44 hip. Ordered 2xl and it fits comfortably like I wanted! Got classic black & the yellow flower ones. Material not too thick and I found it did have some give, not restricting."
5.0,This dress is so much prettier in person! I love this dress. It fits great and is a fantastic summer dress.
5.0,"Love the yellow and turquoise accents.  Nice bead, but small."
5.0,"This is gorgeous! I'm 5'9&#34; 180lbs waist size 35in and 34DD bra size, 14-16 pants size. I ordered a Large and it fits like a glove. It's very flattering for an hour glass, curvy body type. I'm definitely going to buy more dresses from this brand!"
5.0,Live on a farm work great  when fixing cattle water tank
5.0,Use this when ice skating on the pond. Keeps your head and ears warm. Sound is descent and the adjustment Velcro helps you line the speakers to your ears.
5.0,its so pretty and its a nice size i got this a year ago and it still looks great!! i will purchase soon again love the price too!!!
5.0,"Its a awesome turtle neck shirt , only thing is that i.ordered a medium and got a large.<br />But when i wore the large. Its barely fit , it was a bit tight . But when.

5.0,Great fit. Very soft fabric. Love it.
5.0,Some of my favorite earrings! I love them!
5.0,I bought these for my up coming wedding. First bought the Lt grey as my colors are charcoal silver and white. Great product but the Lt grey clashed with the silver ties I had bought. So I switched it up and went with a blast of color and ordered the Red. They come beautifully boxes with the buttons you need. Cant wait to add pictures to this review. Great customer service very fast shipping. Thank you
5.0,My husband loves this wallet! The outer pockets on this wallet are amazing. Would definitely buy again!
5.0,they are super cute and comfy!! love the way they look
5.0,"Perfect!!<br />I had purchased a beautiful black leather handbag on a resale site that was missing the strap. It had gold hardware.<br />This strap is perfect. It’s adjustable, the leather matches my purse and looks like it was made for it. Couldn’t be happier!"
5.0,wife figures she is size 8 says they fit perfect. Fair price.
5.0,All shirts came in correct color and size. Actually american size
5.0,Items arrived in timely fashion and were as described. They fitted our purpose exactly as needed.
5.0,"Love this tank , perfect fit"
5.0,"Great quality.  The only thing difference was that the buckle on the original was black, while this has a silver color.  None the less, I am satisfied."
5.0,I love the colors of my dog paw earrings. Not too heavy and real quality!!!!
5.0,My anime-loving daughter was ecstatic to get this wallet for Christmas.  It seems to be of excellent quality and I'm expecting it to last her a very long time.
5.0,"Got these to use for adding a belt clip to an EDC, everyday carry light and knife, carrier and they have been exactly what I needed."
5.0,"I ordered this in a size up so it’s extra-oversized… but I definitely think it would still be pretty oversized if I ordered my regular size. I’ve always been skeptical of ordering clothes from Amazon, but I’m actually amazed at the quality of this. It’s just as soft and heavy as my expensive sweaters.. if I saw someone else wearing it, I would easily think it was from Free People or something. I’m not the biggest fan of the ring on the zipper pull, but to be fair, it does look exactly like it does in the picture. It looks like I can easily replace it with a smaller zipper pull"
5.0,"Excellent quality, classic vintage feel, adorable romper for my little boy’s first birthday party cake smash! Love the linen material, inconspicuous matching closure snaps, and dark blue grey color! Can’t wait for him to wear this over the summer. Wish it came in more colors I’d buy them all!"
5.0,These socks are very comfortable and warm.  Bought them as a gift for my husband who loves them!
5.0,Outstanding wonderful fashion look..<br />Recommendation to friends and family for a purchase of silver double hooks earings
5.0,Nice heavy material. This dress is cexactly how it looks in the photos.  Fits well and is really cute. My daughter loved it.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:7752fadeee2b39ed8eff1c7cce7bf07]] I love the mixed materials on this blouse! I'm not a super girly-girl, so floral lace is a no-go for me. The details on this top really make it pop. The buttons up the back are well aligned, and since its a faux button back, you don't need to worry about them popping open unexpectedly. The top looks and feels quality, and I plan to machine wash but hang dry to keep the details looking right.<br /><br />The red is aggressively red, I was hoping for something a bit darker or muted, but I don't hate it. Happy with this top, can't wait to wear it on an upcoming trip."
5.0,Great fit. Non wrinkle material
5.0,Very happy with this wallet. The quick access lever is super useful and a time saver.
5.0,It's so cute but difficult to put on yourself with the clasp. I wish it was a tie bracelet but I still like it.
5.0,"It is super adorable. I love that it is simple, but pretty. I would buy again"
5.0,Nice jewelry item
5.0,I picked this out for him and wasn't sure if he would like it....Happy to report he does and says it is perfect for keeping his neck warm in the winter wind. The material is high quality and lays very nicely to compliment the outer look
5.0,My wife looks great in this dress! and she loves it!
5.0,"I really love this shirt. I know everyone says that Nike runs small most of the time.  I'm 5'6, 34B and weigh 125.  I ordered a small but really should of ordered an extra small.  It's not too big and is extremely comfortable.  I decided to keep both shirts I ordered because of that fact.  Washes great.  No shrinking, no fading.  Fast shipping."
5.0,Great pair! I wear them all the time and look so much more expensive then what their prices for.
5.0,"I am using the D rings to put together ribbon tiebacks.  They are easy to use, a little heavier than I imagined, but overall perfect for my project."
5.0,I use them on the walls of my office cubicle and get compliments on them all the time.
5.0,"Great turtleneck, more like cowl neck but is terrific. Very comfy on and warmer than regular cotton turtlenecks"
5.0,i like the cap it is just what i ordered
5.0,[[VIDEOID:51b7fa786005df03e0b089c96982cf9e]] This Umbrella really impressed me. I literally had it open and was sitting under it within 5 minutes of getting it. The umbrella is light weight and easy to handle. It weights about 20 lbs. It fit—without a problem—in the preexisting hole that was already in my patio table. The umbrellas' pole slid right into the base I had for my previous umbrella. The umbrella is very nice quality. The canopy opens very easily with the quality hand crank on it's frame. The frame of the umbrella in great quality aluminum. It actuated very smoothly when raising and lowering. It's very sturdy and does fine in the wind. Just make sure its secured well in the base. I think for the money this umbrella is a great deal. I recommend it. I will be having dinner with my family under it this evening as we watch the sunset.
5.0,"Bought on a whim before going on vacation in Mexico and I wasn't sure if I would love it or hate it. Happy to say, I love it! Floppy hats are cute but they would always fly off my head when the wind came along and I had to either wear my hair down or braided. I was able to wear this hat with my hair in space buns and high ponytails to keep my long thick hair off my neck/back PLUS I could wear in in the pool/ocean without fear of losing it!"
5.0,They're fun and funky! Just what I need for my 70's themed party!
5.0,fits two strands of paracord
5.0,so cool watch and i bought it as a graduation gift for my friend and everyone including myself admires it on him. I am given to this watch 5 stars
5.0,"It's s smooth silk, not heavy as another I have, but IT IS SILK!! I bought two. The size and patterns are perfect! The only regret I have is that they don't offer them in solid colors."
5.0,👍😉
5.0,Very high quality material! Loved the color and style.
5.0,These goggles look so good. My head is big but these fit me comfortably.

5.0,For phone perfect size
5.0,Great seller great product.  Lovely cover up
5.0,Ship on time was exactly what it was supposed to be
5.0,My grandchildren love them! They finally have a gaiter that fits and doesn’t slide down. The only thing I found was the stitching was loose on one of them. More available colors would be fun for children.
5.0,My daughter loved them and wore them all day to Disney
5.0,My Son love it
5.0,"These socks hold up well. They are softer and more attractive than socks without cotton, yet don't lose their stretch like most cotton socks."
5.0,Very impressed.  They were so well made I shared/gave some out to my coworkers because we wear ties for our uniforms.
5.0,"These work great for all of my flats because you can't see them, but after I wash them they're super small so they're always slipping off of my heels"
5.0,Lightweight and colorful. Goes with almost anything.
5.0,Loved this nite!
5.0,Had a little trouble figuring out how many links to take out so we had to do it twice.  Liked that the tools to do it were included.  Otherwise the band is great.
5.0,I like everything about this lil. # & the fact that u cn do whateva u like ! Just need it 2 come in xtra small...
5.0,Bought as a gift set.  Looks very warm!

5.0,"Don't hesitate to buy this dress, it is beautiful!"
5.0,"I love this,  it remind me of the bible days."
5.0,"This earring goes ABOVE and BEYOND value for your money! It comes APART!! Soo you have a hoop alone, hoop w stick, hoop w half, AND hoop w stick/half!! That's 4 DIFFERENT EARRINGS for the Price of One!! I'm all  about a bargain and THAT'S a good one!!! 👍"
5.0,Just like the ones I used to wear back in the US Army!  Perfect.
5.0,My co-worker loved it
5.0,Very nice just a little bit heavy.
5.0,Looks great and is long enough for my 5'7&#34; frame.  The large fit perfect.
5.0,"Good quality, fast shipping.  Light and comfortable. Not as round-topped as low-profile, unstructured ball caps—if that’s what you’re looking for. But it isn’t peaky or blocky like a trucker’s cap, but still has the breathable mesh backing that you’ll appreciate in the summer. Keep in mind that you need SOME structure to display Tyrion’s slogan.  Rest assured, though, you won’t have to get after it with the hot water and seam ripper like the hat you got at your company picnic.  And unlike your company logo, you can wear this hat to work on casual Friday and not look like a total kiss-@ss tool."
5.0,"I love these ties. They're not too skinny, they're not too fat. They're just right for what I need them for. The solid colors of blue, red and gray is exactly what I was looking for in an everyday necktie for work."
5.0,Bought this for my boyfriend and he’s loving this shirt. Fits perfect.
5.0,Perfect for my best friend and her now husband
5.0,I love everything about this jacket. It serves it's purpose well. I purchased just to have to throw on over a sports bra after my workout while I'm doing things around the house. I love the way it fits and it's very soft and comfortable I will be buying more
5.0,"Bonito acabado, se ve de buena calidad y se puede arreglar el tamaño al gusto de uno eso me gustó más aún no la eh usado mucho tiempo espero que no pierda el color pronto pero,  vale la pena"
5.0,It is really comfy and cute!
5.0,Kids loved these in their treat bags took long time to ship. Order ahead.
5.0,So cute! Bought them for my daughter and she loved them. Super cozy!!
5.0,"I received these boots Saturday morning immediately went out for a 6 mile ruck with a 30 pound pack. The fit is great, I usually wear 7.5 running shoes and based on some info from other reviewers I bought size 7.5 in these boots and they are perfect. There's just enough room to wear some good cushion socks without feeling cramped.<br /><br />I did notice some blistering around where the achilles meets the heel bone, so you might want to start out with moleskin in that area until the boots are properly exercised.<br /><br />There's not much arch support in these boots, so if that's a problem you could replace the inner sole with something more supportive.<br /><br />I highly recommend these boots for active people who prefer boots to shoes!<br /><br />Update: I wore these boot during a GoRuck Tough Challenge and I'm pleased to say they held up very well with no issues. I did however, lay some duct tape along the inside back seam to help reduce rubbing."
5.0,The universal bungee kits are great. They work perfect for our outdoor privacy blinds ( the blinds we bought from another store entirely didn’t provide all the bungee kits like they were supposed to). These bungee kits were the exact same that we needed for our blinds. have around our pool deck. They were easy to install and are very easy to use. I will definitely buy more if/when needed
5.0,I’m giving it a five star because they work for me. I’m a women I wear an 8.5 shoe.... there’s no way these could be comfortable for a 10-13 . But they are SOOOOOO soft and fit me perfect! They got even softer with each wash. I’m in love. But beware if you have a size 10 or larger I think they would be very tight.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter for a camp bag. Nice quality bag. I especially like the thickness of the straps that other bags do not have. Great price too!
5.0,I love this skirt! Fits nice and has a feminine flow to it.
5.0,"I love leather bracelet jewelry like these, they were never reviewed but i would recommend this if someone was looking for a nice bracelet, specially if they were specific in a leather bracelet. this is not too flashy or plain, some bracelets i've seen had too much buckles or shine. But I LOVE my bracelet. I recently lost my first one when i took it off to go swimming, was very sad when i forgot about it. So this one is my second one."
5.0,I love these sunglasses so much. Calming my eyes during my work in front of computer in the office. My eyes are very relaxed. Recommend these glasses especially for those from IT. My eyes didn't hurt after 5-6 hours in front of computer. Very good quality
5.0,I love the color and the style is very flattering.
5.0,Awesome earrings.  Great quality for a great price.  Very stylish!
5.0,Georgeous!
5.0,This is a very fun piece...  Love it!  It arrived 12 to 20 days sooner than expected. It is very well made and not cheap looking.
5.0,"This is a great product. TheRe aren't that many cuff links that work well for women, but these are cute and I often get compliments when people see them peeking out from under my suit sleeve."
5.0,Sturdy & Comfy

5.0,Super cute and fits perfectly! I had to clean it first but was still amazing after.
5.0,Wear them all the timeeee!!!
5.0,Light but warm. This is a comfy jacket with easy moving zippers. The size is true and workmanship quality is perfect. I really like the adjustment at wrists
5.0,"Absolutely love them.  The GSD pictured resembles my sweet Sam, who I lost to cancer on 6-2-15--he wasn't even 6 years old yet.  I've already worn them."
5.0,"I have bought a few Chinese brand watches, and like this one the best. I do supplement the automatic winding system by manually winding it. It keeps excellent time. The others are hard to wind, which is why I guess they made a large stem on this one, although this one is quite easy to wind. Also on the others the stem is hard to pull out in order to set the watch, but this one is easy. The band on another is fraying, but this one won't.<br />I like the brass look and the interesting and beautiful skeleton mechanism. I bought one for my grandson-in-law, and another for myself to put away."
5.0,I love these sunglasses! I get so many compliments on them! Can't wait to buy more styles from this company!
5.0,Super cute shirt that's really soft. Fits as expected.
5.0,"I love these masks, they are so pretty! I'm fully vaxxed but still wear masks when shopping and at work...these are perfect! I was looking for something different and light for my summer masks...these masks did not disappoint! I do wish they had metal for the bridge to flush around the nose."
5.0,Very good product and good accuracy at a good price $.
5.0,"I was given and ST350 from a Longview TX promotional. Really liked how it felt dry, damp, or wringing wet. I'm not sure what makes it this effective but the least amount of breeze has a really good cooling effect. I had one. Bought two just to see how they would be with out the screen printing. Now I'm up to ten All different colors. You want to stand out in a crowd or blend in. They have the colors to do it with.  Great shirts great price.<br /><br />I've bought one of the polos. It's good too!"
5.0,"Very solid, handsome and practical. Fairly priced and shipped securely and quickly."
5.0,"Fits about right, daughter looked great in it."

5.0,"Love this dress! I’m 5’4” and this is the first maxi dress that fits length without alteration. Beautiful rich colors and gorgeous fit. I’ve received many, many compliments on this dress."
5.0,"I love this sweater. I’ve had it for a few weeks and have already worn it multiple times. I’m 5’10” so I often have difficulty finding sweaters with long enough sleeves, but the sleeve length on this sweater is perfect for me (I bought a small). I have other PattyBoutik items and the sleeves are always long enough for me. This sweater is not too thin and not super thick either. It’s been perfect for fall weather."
5.0,"Just what I needed. Light weight, crinkly, solid color scarf. It's so versatile. I can't wear wool or acrylic around my neck."
5.0,Loved that they fit just right my kid is always looking to see if they've been washed so he can put them on every night.
5.0,Great shorts worth the price every time
5.0,"Well made, fits as expected and GREAT quality."
5.0,"I absolutely love this bag! I admittedly have too many laptop bags.  I get bored with the same  bag, so I'm always looking for new ones.  This bag looks much more expensive than it is.  It's well made and lightweight.  Very sharp bag especially when using the cross body strap.  And it comes with detachable shoulder handles  too, if that's more your style.  I've had  more compliments on this bag than on most."
5.0,This dress is amazing!! It fits perfect! So pleased! A little see through in the bra area but not too bad! The material feels wonderful too!! You won't be disappointed.
5.0,"It’s soft, slim and fits the same as the other Harley slim tees."
5.0,Dollar for dollar the finest watch money can buy.

5.0,"pretty, inexpensive but look lovely"
5.0,"I need several pair to have at the office, home, etc. I did purchase some that the vision was not correct, these are correct. I love them."
5.0,"Pretty earring, have used them for a week and surprisingly no horrible skin reaction to them as I usually get from nickel based products. I supposed these earring truly are gold plated hence the change. Happy customer, thanks so much!"
5.0,I love these compression sleeves... I normally can't find a pair that fit without being painful or too hot... These are amazing 😍. Definitely recommend and will buy again... Already did actually.
5.0,LOOKS GREAT AND FITS CORRECT
5.0,These are beautiful. Wore them &#34;Fess-ing&#34; all day and out to dinner at night. They don't need the pesky backstop to stay in even for dancing.. Jewelry is one thing I never order online but I'd order from this seller again. Actually bounced my go to hoops out of 1st place.
5.0,Hermoso me encantó
5.0,"This bracelet exceeded my expectations!  It's well made, easy to put on my wrist and looks fantastic.  I wear a 7.35-7.5 bracelet typically and this fits perfectly.  It's a bright white, the coloring on the leather is really good.  I've had other white leather bracelets that cracked and faded, but this one is holding up well so far."
5.0,Very  nice. Perfect size for shopping
5.0,"Great sunglasses for the price. They were packaged well, and came with soft and hard carrying case and lense wipe. Very lightweight, which I love. Would recommend and buy again. Wish they came in other colors too."

5.0,People ask me all the time &#34;where did you find the hat ?
5.0,Great value! Perfect accessory for a girl who loves softball! Bag is simple cinch bag. Great for holding lightwight items. Bracelet was what she liked the most! Headband is pretty awesome too!
5.0,"Comfortable, true to size, and I love the look.  Easy to wear with no breakin period."
5.0,"What's not to love about this product? As advertised, durable shoe sole for DIY repair. I used Barge glue (blue), and the sole are sticking beautifully."
5.0,"Purchased this for my Dad and he absolutely loves it! It's his 1st Ratchet Belt and he always wanted one since seeing it advertised. We threw the old  belts (with those holes) away in the trash immediately after he fell in love with these Marino/Ratchet belts. It was quick and easy  to  cut to size. Genius design and the customer service is impeccable from this company. They make you feel comfortable so if there are any questions or concerns I know I can easily contact them anytime. So far, dad have been wearing this belt daily and there are no complaints so I'll buy him some more belts for a father's day present. Much Thanks!"
5.0,"This Pashmina is absolutely gorgeous! I love the print and colors, I will be buying more soon. I can't wait for the weather to get chilly so I can add this to my wardrobe."
5.0,Love the shirt fits well.
5.0,Nice soft material.  Good fit. Very flattering.
5.0,"I bought these as party giveaways. I was so impressed that I kept one for myself. The three little 'dials' on the watch face serve no function. They are decorative anf for novelty value only  but for the price, who cares?"
5.0,"These were perfect for my mom and mother-in-law for my wedding day, they were given so many compliments and they were nice and modern!"
5.0,It was beautiful but it was to small. It didn't have much stretch.  I recommend you order but go a size up.

5.0,"These masks are a little bit on the pricier side than others I’ve purchased but they’re worth every penny! They’re well-made, soft, comfortable, breathable, and I love the colors (my employer requires that we wear only black, blue, or gray masks to go with the uniform, and these are perfect). I can comfortably wear it all day long (8+hours) without my ears getting sore or the mask digging into my face (unlike the N95s I was wearing previously). It also seems to seal around my face; I don’t feel any air escaping as I breathe, and the adjustable nose wire prevents my glasses from fogging up. I use a piece of polypropylene cloth instead of a premade filter (polypropylene is what N95s are made of and has been proven effective at filtering out the virus), and have no trouble breathing. COVID-19 isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so invest in these masks...you won’t regret it!"
5.0,This is the cutest little dress. It is a great summer run around dress.<br />Super comfy and very flattering.
5.0,Love shirt. Fits great and very soft fabric
5.0,"Oh my goodness I'm so in love! It's big, has a small zipper pocket inside with 2 smaller pockets for phones. The zipper could be better but it's not bad! It's a little stiff but it's breaking down and softening up a bit. Took about a week and a half to arrive. I'd order again."
5.0,Great glasses! They are so clear to see through. Care for them properly by leaving them in a glasess case when you're not wearing them. Not a single smudge or break.
5.0,I ordered this sweater thinking that I'd be able to wear it as a sweater dress with leggings.  I read th reviews ad ordered up a size.  It honestly should say two sizes if you want it to fit as shown.  That being said - I fell in love with this sweater immediately after opening it.  It is soooooo soft.  It is super stretchy so I pulled on it for a bit and now just wear it as a turtleneck with jeans.  Not what I expected but I love it anyways.
5.0,"Very nice sweatshirt,"
5.0,"I debated between four and five stars, but settle on five because my issues may be inherent to all nato straps.<br />The strap appears to be solidly built and is comfortable to wear.  I don't get sweaty under it like I occasionally did with my silicone strap.  Even more important, this strap has sturdy metal retaining loops for the excess strap.  I doubt they ever break or come loose.  The retaining loops were the undoing of my silicone strap.  They cracked and broke, making the strap stick out all of the time.  I like the fact that with my nato strap if one of the watch pins breaks, the strap will stay on.  Frequently when playing sports, my watch would catch on something and fly off.  That is no longer a worry.  Ritchie included new pins, which look just fine, so I am covered if a pin bends.<br /><br />There are two things I do not like.  First, the way this strap works, there are two layers of band under the watch.  It makes the watch sit up slightly higher.  Not a big deal, but I would prefer it were not the case.  Secondly, the retaining loops are sturdy, but they don't pin down the strap very well, so the end of the strap can come loose and stick out.  Like I said before, I think these are facts of life for all nato straps."
5.0,"Yes, it's expensive, but it's one of the best regarding function and fashion. I have the short style of this boot and wanted the tall and buzz of its discontinuation caused a search. Glad to find it! And, I'm plus size with 16&#34; calf & it closes and looks fine and is confortable-not heavy nor clunky. Yes, laces are an issue but minor, to me.  After last winter in NYC, happily looking forward to snow."
5.0,My son wears these all around. When he first put them on they were a little slippery but he walked around outside on concrete for a few minutes and it took care of that problem- they just needed to be walked in outside first. They are really cute looking and he loves having shoes on!
5.0,It’s alil big from the arms but love it
5.0,"Awesome shirt.  Just make sure you order about 2 sizes larger than normal. I wear a medium normally, ordered a large,  but wish I had gotten an xl."
5.0,"I have many pairs of Colorful Koala leggings.  I do love how they look, and feel.  I just wish the waist bands wew as tight as the legs. I like the level of compression but think the waists are a little loose, and I have a little mom tummy so not as if I am skinnier in the waist.  Overall I am very happy with my purchases."
5.0,Got this for a gift and the little girl loved it! Hopefully we get to use it this year.
5.0,Love this band. It’s fun stylish and functional.
5.0,"Oh my gosh, my daughter loved it!"
5.0,"I received my Oflamn bag today and fell completely in love;<br />Material is durable, water resistant<br />Wet compartment is the perfect size and has it's own zipper allowing your clothes in the main compartment to stay dry.<br />Shoe compartment is perfect I put in my husbands size 12 shoes in and they fit perfectly, although you're losing space in the main compartment. I am a size 7 and I can fit a pair of shoes and flip flops and still have space for gym clothes or accessories.<br />Main compartment like I explained, has a great size you can pack up a weekends worth of clothes or extra stuff for the gym.<br />This bag is not too big nor too small. I completely love this bag!"
5.0,Delivered very quick & is great quality. I bought 3 for nephews who loves The Sandlot. Will be giving them to them this weekend! I’m sure they won’t want to take them off.
5.0,The backpack version of those reusable grocery totes.
5.0,We attached one of these pins to each of our  gift cards (packaging) of our ugly sweater contest awards.  Very cute and colorful!
5.0,"GREAT LITTLE PHONE CASE. It is thin and polished which is how I like my phone cases, but because the rubber completely covers the corners and sides it is surprisingly sturdy. I am not easy on phones, but this along with a glass screen protector has kept my iPhone in pristine condition. I have has this case for about 7 months now and it has not broken, or even showed wear-and-tear. It still looks as good as the day I purchased it! Highly, highly recommend."
5.0,So comfortable! 4months pregnant and wore to the zoo for hours.
5.0,Fits well...very comfy
5.0,"Perfect I love them and wear them all the time! Don't spend a ton of money on expensive glasses, just buy blue blockers!"
5.0,"This is a basic, no frills watch. It holds up well."
5.0,"This suit fits true to size.  I’m a bigger girl, but I still want to be cute on my cruise in a month... this suit will let me cover the problem areas and still look like Youthful and cute instead of matronly.  Would definitely recommend, although I haven’t worn it in the water yet so I will update my review after that"
5.0,The nightgown is perfect and since i love it so much I bought it in red and black as well.
5.0,"Nice pair of house slippers. Easy to slip on, very comfortable and soft soles."
5.0,"I went back and forth with myself regarding if i should get a $25 pair of socks. However, i, in the end decided to purchase them. Lets just say that i am very happy with my purchase! These we're as expected. When i wear these i notice that my feet aren't as achy. Which is great! I really like wearing these while doing my work out, i do agree that they do help get the blood flow back to your heart. Over all a great product. If you're going back and forth i would suggest getting one paid to try. They will change everything!!!"
5.0,This is perfect. The band that came with the watch was too bulky and this being a flat clasp is perfect and very easy to change out and adjust the links.
5.0,"I go to a lot of cons, and I like to show off my pins but I was always paranoid about them getting stolen (they're not that hard to pull off my backpack without me noticing). But these are a really cheap and effective way to keep your pins on display without being paranoid that you'll lose them."
5.0,Super cute! I love lace and this held up to my expectations!!
5.0,Simply beautiful !
5.0,"So far it's been great. Well made, Nice material I love the credit card pull up tab and it's just perfect to put in your front pocket."
5.0,Good socks. Bought as gift. My niece loves them.
5.0,"Love it, super cute hat. Fits perfect, great for bad hair days."
5.0,I recieved a product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review. I like the design of the product and how they fit. I would buy more of these in the future. I like how they block the sun. I like the way they feel as they rest on my ears. My hsband wans a pair also and my sister. This is a great gift and the price for this product is low because of the high quality these are. I am excited they came fast. Thanks!
5.0,"This swim cover up is very nice and fits good over my bathing suit.  It is very pretty and could be used as a tunic top over yoga pants, etc.  The length on me is just at my knee and I am 5 ft 4 in.<br />I would recommend this cover up."
5.0,Sharp and good quality!
5.0,Bright and vibrant! Looks wonderful! My husband thought it was very nice.
5.0,"good quality, fun hoodie, would (probably will) buy again"
5.0,"Very cute, comfortable"

5.0,Love this bra! It keeps the girls right where they should be.
5.0,I like the charm. The bracelet broke and I lost 2 charms I had just purchased!
5.0,Bought these for my son who swims competitively.  He has been very happy with them.
5.0,"Bought this dress for a wedding in a couple months, love it and love the prices.  Looks for stylish"
5.0,Love these! I am 5'10&#34; and they are long enough if not a little too long. I will definitely be getting another pair in the future.
5.0,"The reason I really liked this product because it is really strong. I purchased few keystarters whose grip was too weak. This is a really good one. I have a huge set of keys for my business, car keys, and house keys etc. This keystarter is really great to hold them as it is really strong. I like the string size as well, it's perfect for me. Will be buying more for my dad."
5.0,Its really good. Cleaned my hat really well.
5.0,The product is well worth the purchase. The material is thick and it’s a real pretty shirt dress. I usually wear a large or xlrg in dresses. I purchased this in a 2x for a loose fit. Great buy!
5.0,This is really very pretty and my Mom loved it!
5.0,"Being an after-market replacement, I was really skeptical on the quality and the fit of the lenses, but after getting them and using them, I'm completely sold and I would definitely buy them again!<br />They come in a protected hard casing and and with its own high-grade cleaning cloth. Like any pair of glasses, the replacing of the lenses is a little tough, but they wouldn't good if they went in easy. I use my glasses everyday and I feel these lenses are less prone to scratches unlike the original lenses."
5.0,Absolutely adorable earrings; perfect size for me as I don’t like large hoops. I wear these with a leopard print necklace and leopard print leggings.  So cute together!
5.0,My girlfriends and I all bought a pair of these pants. They are so flattering and comfortable. Perfect casual wear. I wouldn’t wear to workout.
5.0,Our fourteen year old granddaughter was thrilled with the selection.
5.0,"Great wallet. I kind of wish I would have gotten the blue instead, but I'm still very happy with my purchase. Took a little bit longer than I expected to get to me, but I would recommend."
5.0,My wife loved this and she will always be MY mama bear
5.0,This is just what I wanted.
5.0,The only problem I found. Was that I needed more colors for my medical uniforms..
5.0,"I absolutely love this shirt, I can wear it as business casual or just casual to any event. The material is nice and it fits as expected."
5.0,Love these glasses. Super light and comfortable. Using them with just a reading prescription but I can definitely see wearing them all day.
5.0,love the look!!
5.0,Love the color and the pockets!!
5.0,Cute I like it.
5.0,Really pretty necklace.
5.0,"Just like the ones I had in the navy, fast service."
5.0,"Soooo nice & cute. I love these on my daughter. Quality is very good. I was worried if the elastic would irritate her, but it doesn't - it's  nice and soft. These fit her well, she is 2 months old."
5.0,"I really love these shorts, they are just the right length, the pockets are deep enough for an iPhone 6+ and so far they have laundered well.  I wish they offered other colors."
5.0,I purchased this product for a great nieces first communion. Very pretty. Great for First Communion size hands. She holds them as very precious to her.
5.0,My wife loves the look and feel.
5.0,I bought for my husband and he loves it.  He said it was so comfortable and forgot I wear sunglasses. I ordered the second pair for in case he loses.
5.0,I would buy again !!
5.0,I bought this for my husband & he loves it ! Great quality leather at a good price. I look forward to purchasing more products from this company
5.0,Brought this two piece set for my play on a sexy violet for halloween and i can say i will buy it again in more colors i love it !
5.0,It's really nice and totally elegant but was too long. I need help getting into the dress since the back is a lace-up but that's expected.<br /><br />I am editing this as the company contacted me and is compensating me for the tailoring I got done! WOW that was so sweet and totally unexpected!
5.0,They fit as I hoped they would. I like wearing them around the house and for workouts. I got a small and I'm 5'2 and weigh 110lbs for reference. I will definitely buy more in the future.
5.0,"No matter what size you are.  I'm very very curvy ... half black and asian (big butt), and I'm always trying to buy things to ""tone it down"". Love this"
5.0,Nothing disliked
5.0,Perfect! Just what I wanted. Nice and soft too.
5.0,This bra is super comfortable. Like you forget your even wearing it. It gives great support for not having a wire. I did find it to run a bit small so I would definitely size up.
5.0,"This was actually really suportive! The material seems pretty solid. I wish it had a tiny bit more boob coverage, but altogether, I'm super pleased with it!"
5.0,Tag inside the bottom tells you how to orient the shirt:  have the tag to the left and the back will be at the back.
5.0,"I got these for the infrequent California cold weather/early morning motorcycle ride, and for that purpose they are great.  I've got medium sized hands so I ordered size large and the fit is fine.  Due to their thickness, I wouldn't use them to count change or dig into a tight pocket, but they are plenty soft and flexible for bike riding.  They are well put together and stylish.  I hate gloves with too-long finger pockets, and my fingers go all the way to the end in these."
5.0,Great product. Great company customer service. Win-win
5.0,"Small, but I love them"
5.0,I love this dress! Nice fabric and fit.
5.0,I love this mask. I bought this mask so I wouldn’t have to keep removing my mask to sip my water and coffee.
5.0,Very comforatable!
5.0,Beautiful and have received complements.
5.0,Bought this for my daughter. She loved it. Fits nicely.
5.0,"These pants are super cute. They fit perfectly, my daughter used them as a costume for a dance recital."
5.0,Nice soft socks. Great to wear with tennis shoes your feet stay warm but don't sweat. Very comfortable. Will buy again.
5.0,The coat fit great.  Seems warm. Haven’t had a chance to wear since skiing is over. Material has noise to it.
5.0,Ok so I absolutely love this skirt.  But I will add that the green is not the same as the picture but still very pretty and perfect for my vacation! It fits perfect and very comfortable and flowy just what I wanted so much so I may order another one in a different color!
5.0,Was for a friend and they loved it
5.0,Loved these laceez for my son's stan smiths. Makes mornings easier!
5.0,They are great my 8 yr old son loves them
5.0,"Beautiful watch, looks and feels like it should cost ten times the actual price!!"
5.0,Love this sweater. It is soft and wears nicely.  A great value!
5.0,I get an allergic reaction to most metals and these were perfect no pain. They're also very petite but still stand out
5.0,i'd bought it for my wife.the quality was there it was too small for my wife but my daughter was able to wear it.
5.0,"Fits great, looks great. I like the color. I’d say nice mid-weight, not bulky but keeps me warm enough. Washes up great."
5.0,"Adorable addition to my hat addiction...I mean collection. I love it. The color is a beautiful mix of blue, purple, and brown."
5.0,GREAT STUFF!
5.0,love love love! bought these for the price and because of a buzzfeed article. Got them super quick and took them to Disneyland for a vacation. They were wonderful and comfortable.
5.0,"You can’t beat the ETA 2824 ticking inside this watch for the price. The watch is well made and has drilled lug holes which I didn’t expect because I’ve heard after Invicta bought Glycine they stopped drilling the holes. Obviously I don’t know if they all come with drilled holes, but mine did.<br /><br />Additional insights after a few months:<br />Some things I don’t like about this watch are the bezel which is super hard to turn and the crown action which is difficult to thread back in and the different positions when trying to hack the time and date are clunky. It’s sometimes hard to get to the time change position (third) as the crown doesn’t come out easily. Still keeping great time though."
5.0,"cute, my grandma loves them"
5.0,"I purchased this as bff necklaces for myself and my bff. Originally, the necklace didn’t come when it was supposed to be delivered. The seller reached out and apologized and said it was probably lost in the mail. They issued a refund asap, and surprisingly almost a month later it did end up showing up! I know it was totally not the sellers fault, but I do appreciate them reaching out and refunding.<br /><br />The necklace is cute, isn’t too clunky, and hasn’t tarnished."
5.0,This is an absolutely beautiful pin which can be worn all winter.  Seller delivered fast and would recommend both.
5.0,looks super cute might get one at some point but is it customable to my sizes need ?? leave feed back if it is  k thanks :)
5.0,"Super soft and comfortable, warm but lightweight .<br />Comfort fit with great wasteband on pants."
5.0,Well made.  Looks like it is more expensive than it is.
5.0,"Me encanto.  Luce muy elegante, y la calidad es Buena,vale lo que cuesta."
5.0,Fantastic!  I am very happy with the length of the necklaces and where it falls on my chest.  Was packaged nicely so it did not get tangled in transit!  Will be a go-to for work and social occasions!
5.0,Good tee shirt.
5.0,These compression sleeves are amazing. I have terrible shin splints when running and from the first time I put these own I have not had any problems with them. I was concerned running in 100+ degree weather these would make my legs too hot but I have had no issues with this. I highly recommend these and will be purchasing more.
5.0,You get a lot of bang for your buck. Much bigger bag of gears than I expected. Really nice colors and quality gears. Must buy
5.0,Fits well I’m usually a medium but I bought a small fits very well.
5.0,"OMG, so cute!!<br /><br />Love it!!!<br /><br />Bought a medium, fits perfectly."
5.0,"This shirt fits like a juniors size large, and not a misses large. It's a little slimmer through the waist. If you want a looser fit, I would suggest sizing up. The sleeve length is perfect. I have long arms, and the sleeves cover all of my wrists. I love the style - the lacing up the arms is a great touch. The material is like a thin sweatshirt and very soft. The design looks great as well. There is nothing I don't like about this shirt!"
5.0,I like this face coverings and it’s cute. It’s thick and fits for all sizes.
5.0,Gorgeous. Looks like red carpet jewelry
5.0,Perfect for my 2 and half year old..I bought 3T.. I have washed it and still it looks new..good material...can't say same for carter's pajamas that looks dull in one wash.. price wise got a good deal too..only negative was it's not that stretchy when u try to put their arms and legs through..
5.0,"This ring looks just like the picture. Its absolutely beautiful in person, I've gotten so many compliments."
5.0,No complaints nice tanks well made the sizing in right on so I bought smaller on purpose to get a tight fit.Size medium in grey.God Bless.
5.0,"Okay, so this bra is probably the most comfortable bra I've owned. Most of the time I can't even feel it at all. Love the wide straps and seemless back. Pulls over so you don't have to worry about clasps. Im about to go buy more! I wanted a comfy bra for all my long workdays and something that would be comfortable to lounge around in- and still give me some shape!<br />I typically wear a 38 B (and I don't always fill out the cup if you know what I mean). It's cute, it's comfortable, it gives shape and support.<br /><br />I'd say if you are more well endowed, this might not the the bra for you, but all my shallow chested ladies, buy it, buy it now, dang, buy two!"
5.0,I have always liked Russel products and this is no exception. The one thing I would say is buy a size down from what you wear in other brands. For example I wear a large Nike hoodie but had to return the large Russel hoodie and get a medium. I am 5'9&#34; 185 lbs.
5.0,Very good Husband feels very comfortable with them the pain in his legs have left the swelling has left he’s very happy<br /><br />Thank you🙌👍🦵🏼👍
5.0,Will definately order more shirts from you in the spring because my husband is a golf fanatic and loved it!
5.0,"Fits great and fast shipping.. true to size, love this"
5.0,"Super soft shirt. Odd that the top color is not red, but love the shirt anyway."
5.0,"True to size, very comfortable and the shorts underneath are long enough to prevent your thighs from rubbing. Very supportive on your pot baby bellies."
5.0,It’s sturdy enough to hold my ring while I’m at work and it’s really light. It’s not the most expensive but it’s nice.
5.0,I did a lot of research before buying these.  I have very long wavy hair and I wear glasses so I have had a lot of trouble finding head bands that stay on my head.  These STAY!  I have no problem running with out having to fix or adjust the band.  It keeps ALL the sweat from dripping into my eyes.  I was even tricking myself and thinking I was not working out hard enough so I checked the band when I took it off and sure enough it was drenched.  This was a great buy! Could not be happier.  SIDE NOTE - If you are one of those girls that wants to be the hot chick at the gym these are not for you.  You look absolutely ridiculous in these bands because they are so wide they come off the top of your head.  I don't give AF what I look like at the gym so this was a non issue.  Happy Exercising!
5.0,I just love them..
5.0,they are just beautiful everybody loves it
5.0,"The best front pocket wallet I have eber had. I have had Columbia and Dockers before, neither were as functional as I would have liked. The card slots were to small and the magnets weak. So far so good my new NapaWalli"
5.0,Will make a fun gift bag stuffer for the kids.
5.0,Girlfriend loved them.  Very detailed and came looking just like the picture.  They seem durable and will not fall apart with normal wear.  Not to heavy and she gets a lot on compliments on them
5.0,Love it. Well made product.
5.0,So far clips on strong and doesn’t come loose and holds my shirt well!
5.0,Great deal . Needed a fake ring for the end of my pregnancy
5.0,Nicely crafted watch that’s fun to wear. Seller was responsive to inquiry. I’m pleased with this purchase.
5.0,Daughter loves it. Very sturdy.
5.0,Good fit for all our gear
5.0,My daughter cheer Competition uniform including these shorts. They worked out perfectly
5.0,"Beautiful!!! Love it, I have it to my friend as a gift. She loves it."
5.0,Pregnant and fingers are swelling. These do the trick!
5.0,Bought for my daughters wedding. It was perfect

5.0,"very soft, nice colors...great for winter and spring."
5.0,So Comfy!
5.0,Great fit. They help keep my ankles from swelling and my legs feel better.
5.0,"Great product! The fabic is nice and study. I am about 5'4 and I cannot wait to wear this with leggings during the fall. It will perfectly cover what needs to be covered. This top can perfectly be dressed up or down, depending on the occassion. I have to say, I am really impressed with this shirt and cannot wait to wear it again.<br /><br />- I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review-"
5.0,"I love the dress, its made very well.  I usually wear a USA size 14 and this was an XL, it is snug and if the other dress doesn't arrive in time I will wear it!  The bow is really nice - not gaudy!  There is red piping around the bow and I was planning on wearing a red petticoat!.  The neckline is quite flattering - not too low just great for show casing a necklace."
5.0,"This is a really nice, flattering dress. Perfect fit and lovely to wear. Have got many compliments on wearing it which would make any lady feel good about herself when she wears it.  Brilliant value for money and so far has washed really well, no shrinking or losing it's shape."
5.0,"Very good and very soft. A person walked in with tiny tears, but the item was quickly and politely replaced<br />Recommended"
5.0,"More beautiful in person! I really love it. and for the price, its awesome. The fit was perfect. I have a 28inch waist and this skirt has some stretch to it."
5.0,"I’ve bought many different packs and keep coming back for more. They’re my favorite cut and fit. They do run a bit large so size down one size, and that’s coming from a person blessed with booty!"
5.0,"My Grandma and I have been loyal to these for years, these last longer than other brands."
5.0,"First of all THANKS Chicwe for understanding plus size does not equal gigunda armholes! Thanks Chicwe for knowing plus size needs a fuller cut but not an extra ten yards of fabric so that we look like we’re in a circus tent! The print itself is beautiful with vibrant and deep tones in many diff. patterns with some large medallions-  not a problem unless you’re me, who is averse to large prints. A lot of women of all shapes/sizes look fantastic in large prints, I’m just not one of them. Chicwe was true to their sizing and all the info. If anyone navigates the plus sizes on here, Chicwe is really worth exploring and trying."
5.0,Pretty easy to use. I used them for a costume last year 😊
5.0,I receive compliments on this hat every single time I wear it!  I love it!!
5.0,"Yes, excelent"
5.0,My girl is a mechanic and she loves this necklace
5.0,"Perhaps my best tool for sizing watch bracelets! Although I wish the slit accommodated a tad thicker bracelets, the punch guide makes this far superior for removing the more problematic/tight friction pins than other tools and I've yet to find a bracelet to wide (as is the case with the typical &#34;pressing&#34; tools) that this simple device can't handle easily"
5.0,Got the green aventurine as a gift for my friend. It's so pretty and she loves it. I love that it's gold instead of silver like the other ones i'e seen. The chain it comes with isn't the one in the picture which i'm glad about.
5.0,Love it. Nothing better than getting A.) people who know about Bray telling me nice shirt or shouting yowie wowie/let him in at me. Or B.) people saying how dope the shirt looks then asking what it is an getting to explain it. This was a great purchase and I'm glad to get to support arguably the greatest gimmick in wrestling today and many years to come.
5.0,"Fits great, looks great. Perfect summer dress that You can wear with vans slip ons or heels. I am 5’4 112 and XS fits PERFECT!"
5.0,Fits great and long how I like it
5.0,Can dress up or down and still looks great!!
5.0,Great gift for my friend. She absolutely adored it and the colors are vibrant and her favorite colors.
5.0,Sweater is the perfect blank for my HTV.
5.0,Exceeded my expectations for $3.00 + change! This is so unique and my piece was assembled perfectly! This package also arrived way sooner than anticipated! I am thrilled with this! Thanks so much!
5.0,This is nice will wear soon
5.0,"My son says they stay up over his face well throughout the day. He’s very small for his age, so it’s tough to find things that fit him well. He really likes the camo designs."
5.0,"Very good , my daughter loves it ❤"
5.0,"I am a size 14-16 , 165 lbs and was looking for underwear that fits well and doesn't cut into my legs/groin or ride up. I'm a little older, but not in the market for ""granny panties"" just yet! These underwear are perfect! They don't cut into me and I've been able to wear them with jeans, shorts, dress pants and workout clothes! They fit across the rear-end and are just high enough to come up over a little bit of belly. I've bought four packs of them!"
5.0,"Since my four year old daughter constantly reiterates that she is going to be a super hero when she grows up, I had buy these when I saw them. I was informed that I am the best mom in the universe when I presented them to her. I am doing the best I can to help her achieve her goals in life. I'm sure these slippers will help her grow up to become a super hero."
5.0,Feels and looks like a $40 belt . Buying again in different color.Worth the money
5.0,Muy buenas y duraderas ya lo tengo 11 meses en mi trabajo y todavía esta muy buena Gracias
5.0,A large pair of dangling ear-rings! Beautiful! Light enough for me but I could see where most women might think the ear-rings are a little heavy. Love them!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:7bedea52c44ecc660b96e20fa77c91ac]] El precio, el corazon esta bordado y la tela de la gorra el tamaño fue excelente. La Rapidez de la entrega de Amazon."
5.0,"I'm 5'8"" but I ordered the Petite because I want to cook and clean in this. It comes mid calf on me. The full length zipper runs smoothly and is strong. This washes up nicely and is softer the more times I wash it. The cotton Terry is tight weave and the raglan sleeves are finished on the inside and sewn down. I was impressed with the quality of this garment. I use it every morning and sometimes in the evening!"
5.0,Bought this to fit a two and half dollar gold piece.  It works very well.
5.0,"Loved the style of the dress and the quality of the material. The emerald green color was stunning. However, I ordered a medium and found it to be too large to the point where the straps would fall down and it wasn't as flattering on my body because it looked oversized so I'd size down if you want to be on the safe side. Didn't get to wear it as a result so will be returning but would reorder again if I had another holiday party or special occasion to attend."
5.0,"If you’re looking for a eye-catching, fun, and super soft shirt here’s your winner! Love it!!"
5.0,I didn’t know it buying it but you can see through it I really liked it my daughter was the one that bought it but I think it’s cute
5.0,"These socks are nice and thick, but not too thick that you'll have problems with your shoes (but your fit WILL feel very snug).<br />The texture is soft and the tension is comfortable.<br />These are great to wear around the house (as slippers), too.<br />I've washed these over a dozen times and there has been no beading, no fraying, and most importantly, no reduction in the tension/compression.<br />HIGHLY recommend these socks!"
5.0,Better than it looked
5.0,"I don't even have the words to describe how beautiful and well constructed this dress is. The material is thick, and it just hugs all the right places. For reference, I am 5'4"" 215 lbs. I am usually an XL up top and XXL at the bottom. I ordered the XXL in blue plaid. The top of the dress isn't too big for me. Everything just lays beautifully. I highly recommend this dress."
5.0,Se mira muy bien .
5.0,Super cute!! Great quality print and satin finish. I would definitely buy note in other prints.
5.0,"Since working on a install with a buddy. He pulled this out and I was in complete nerd heaven. I bought it right away. I carry a back pack with all my Electronics and computer stuff in it. From city to city, state to state, airport to airport, and client to client. This has been a awesome. All my cables, passport, USE 1TB Hard drive and thumb drives  hubs, are all neat and organized. No more dragging out a rats nest of cables in front of clients. Just a simple board with all my components and wires  right at my  finger tips.  This board is awesome. a must have Installers and on-site trouble shooters."
5.0,They actually fit! Ive used tapers and plugs with o rings but like not having to worry about losing my o rings. I bought another set of plugs and i couldnt get them in my ears at all. These popped in and feel secure and look great.
5.0,I bought these for my granddaughters 13th Birthday.  She loved them.
5.0,Excellent pair of gloves. Keeps the hands warm and very flexible and comfortable!
5.0,I'm very happy with the fit and style. Quality fabric.
5.0,Glasses were great! Given as a gift and received it in a timely manner. I gave this as a gift to my mother and she loved it!
5.0,I bought it too big. I wear a size medium to a large.
5.0,"I love these glasses.  It immediately helps with eye strain in the bright outdoors, and my friend who spent over $200 on his glasses keeps mistaking them for his.  I've gotten my sister hooked on them as well.  There is no reason to ever spend more for sunglasses."
5.0,Perfect I love the martial and it's fits perfectly
5.0,"Super cute and comfortable, Perfect for traveling long distances."
5.0,"This is a staple in my fall wardrobe. And I'm loving this super soft sweatshirt. The color is a true deep burgundy and the quality of this shirt is superb. I'd highly recommend this product for anyone wanting to add a super comfortable ,well made easy to wear shirt to their closet"
5.0,"This knitted tank is very comfortable and fit as expected. You can dress it up or down, it’s a great basic to bring a trip."
5.0,I absolutely love love love this ring.  It was sent to me in my daily amazon deals and I'm so happy I saw it.  This ring is very pretty in person.  I wear it on my finger and get so many compliments on it.  It looks like a very expensive ring and a very cheap price.  I have purchased costume rings at many department stores and none of them has look as nice as this ring.  I will be purchasing additional rings to give as Christmas presents to my girlfriends.  Please consider purchasing this ring.
5.0,I got this for my daughter's birthday.  She absolutely loves it!! Definitely recommend if you have a teenager.  She never wants to take it off! Works really well with her phone also.
5.0,looks very good like a African Culture outfit
5.0,Well made and should last
5.0,"I am very impressed with this dress. When I requested it, I didn’t expect much but I was surprised. The dress is actually an excellent quality, especially for this price point. The sequins are done nicely and not over the top.<br /><br />The dress fits true to size and looks quite nice on. I am a little curvy and it hugs where it needs to but doesn’t look sleezy. Would be nice for a fancy cocktail occasion."
5.0,"These pants are amazing! So comfortable, belt loops on the pants as well but with the elastic bands you may not need one. Serisouly, the only thing more these pants could do for me is pay my taxes. I bought a WF black sixe XL inseam 30"", I am 5'1"" and usually wear a size 12/14. They were a bit long but after a wash they shank a bit, which helped with the length but I will probably get them adjusted another inch or so just so they don't go under my feet while I'm getting ready in the morning. Even though they tightened a bit, they still are comfortable. If you want to go for a more lose-fit, you might want to go a size larger, to account for shrinkage. The kind of pants you can wear to work and still be comfortable when you get home! The elastic band around the waist is about 1.5-2"" thick, so it doesn'y cut into you. The pants themselves sit on your natural waist, about the belly button. The WF pants don't hold wrinkles AT ALL. It's overall an amazing product! Soon after purchasing these and wearing them to work a few times, I bought another pair in pinstripe and I will for sure be back for more!"
5.0,I’ve lost so many inches from my waist and back. I would definitely recommend it to anyone
5.0,So good! I was super surprised because honestly I did not expect a major difference between these and other brands. But they're amazing.
5.0,"Really nice ring, very sparkly."
5.0,"I love wearing this dress in the summer because I always get compliments and nobody accepts that I found it on Amazon, haha. It's not a bodycon dress, but it is a little form fitting on your tummy so just be mindful if you're self conscious of a belly (but seriously it's so cute so who cares). I wear it with a cardigan to the office, and before it got too cold for bare legs with a sweater."
5.0,GV jeans fit me perfectly. I always order one sz smaller than with other brands.<br />definitely my go to brand for pants
5.0,"This is a great belt. It's an outstanding item, 5-stars for sure. It's the perfect length and fits very well."
5.0,"My daughter likes them, they fit her well."
5.0,These frames I found at my local eye glass place and found on line for almost $100 cheaper. Was concerned they would be knock offs but they are the real thing and are really nice. I actually bought 2 pairs for I seem to wear out the frame before I need to change the lenses. Plus the lenses are so much more expensive then the frames these days and it was cheaper for me to buy 2 pairs than buy any type of extended warranty. At least if I bought them thru amazon. ALSO the customer service was great. The 1st order the frames did have a small chip and the 1 arm was a bit loose. They replaced and all was good.
5.0,Quick and easy to install and has held up very well in wind speeds over 10mph with my shade connected
5.0,These arrived on time and are gorgeous!  I think I have worn them every day since that arrived. They go with everything and anything!

5.0,This was a present but she said she loves them and they fit perfectly.
5.0,"Yes, they are on the thick side, but they are super comfortable. The adhesive isn't the strongest, so it is easy to switch between different pairs of shoes. But, they do not move or fall out since your foot holds them in place. I'll be buying more!"
5.0,"Very nice material, stretchy fits like spandex. Love it ❤️."
5.0,These were actually thigh highs i love them
5.0,Bought it as a gift for my mother and she loved it.
5.0,Very cute for work. & when you're out and about. Not tight at all but not billowy it fits just right.
5.0,"I wear these pants all the time. They're great for doing work through my trails and on my property. They have nice enforced knees. They're stretchy so they have some give. They're lightweight. All the pockets have zippers. They're nice for a hot day when you're working/hiking because if you get sweaty, they dry out fast so you don't feel gross all day. I bought a 2nd pair. I would say they run just a little on the small side so if you're between sizes, I would go up a size."
5.0,Bought for an awesome travel nurse that went on for another adventure. Great quality. She loved it and actually turned it in to a necklace
5.0,"The leather belt strap is great, just as described"

5.0,Good fit and the price was great!
5.0,I absolutely love these sunglasses!! They fit my face perfectly!! The box and packaging is great as well. Happy customer!!

5.0,My 13 year old daughter needed practice shorts for basketball and she LOVES these. They fit true to size. She tells me that they are comfortable and allow great movement. She has asked for more pairs and some classmates have asked where we got them. Affordable and useful.
5.0,Daughter loved the country feel of this shirt- Plaid is in!!
5.0,"Son muy cómodos, fue una compra excelente y más ahora que viene el frío. Los recomiendo 100 %"
5.0,"I can sometimes be a creature of comfort with my comfy pajamas, and have had most for many years as they are super comfortable, and have been withstanding the test of time.  It can get a bit boring though when there is nothing new to wear after a good bath or shower, and I had 2 that needed replacing, so my hunt for a new nightgown began.  I ended up stumbling across this adorable fun nightgown, and was thrilled for the opportunity to give it a try at a reduced price for my sincere opinion.  I couldn't wait to get it home, and as soon as I did, I quickly opened up the package, and instantly fell in love.  On sight, the colors are so vibrant and eye catching, and on feel, it is so very soft and inviting.  I couldn't resist, and even before giving it a wash, I wore it right then.  As soon as I walked out my room, I was getting &quot;o wow, that's so nice&quot; and &quot;its feels so cozy&quot;.  It was just the right thickness, looked great, and when sleeping, it keep me feeling nice and comfortable all night through.  I went ahead and gave it a wash, and had no issues with it coming apart or losing its brilliant color at all.  I am hooked on this nightgown as a whole, and I hope to get more just like it in other styles if or when available.  A very comfy cozy and fun good buy."
5.0,Beautiful colors!! Good choice!<br />Would love to have matching chair cushions!
5.0,A little bit larger than I expected but otherwise a very good deal for the price.
5.0,"I wear ties on an almost daily basis and this has got to be my favorite tie I’ve owned in a long time. I receive compliments almost every time I put it on!<br /><br />The quality is top-notch, and has held up through much use. It looks good and feels good, too!"
5.0,"Hard to find a belt that I like, but the sizing was pretty spot on and it is very comfortable."
5.0,Beautiful! Just as pictured.
5.0,"Nice dress, great quality material. Better than I expected"
5.0,Love these compression stockings.  Not loose and not too tight.<br />Would buy again.
5.0,Also love it
5.0,"I love these Spikerking no show socks because they do not slip and cause you blister when walking or running. I got these no show socks because I wanted an athletic and clean look when wearing my sneakers, loafers, or dress shoes. My main concern was wondering if they were comfortable and I have worn these for over two weeks and they are fantastic. The quality is great as well, I have put them through a total of three washes and none of them have ripped or shrank. The colors are great I have no complaints because they are no shows, no one is going to see it unless you take off your shoes. For sizing reference, I am a size 9 in all flyknit Nike shoes and size 8.5 in Vans authentic classics and size 10-12 in these socks fit perfectly no too tight nor loose. All and all, I would highly recommend these socks over the more expensive Vans no show socks which can run double the price. Note that I have received a discount for this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"Soft and comfortable fitting outfit, nice"
5.0,These pants are the best fits to size and great material. I have several pairs.
5.0,"OMG THEY ARE AWESOME. TO SORRY I DIDN'T INVENTED IT. I NEED LIKE A DOZEN, ALSO FOR MY SELF. CAN I GET THE TOP?"
5.0,I love the way this dress fits.  I thing the material the dress it made off has a lot to do with how a dress fits and this one is perfect for me.
5.0,"My daughter takes swimming classes and usually hates wearing goggles. These are easy for her to take on/off without pulling her hair. They don’t leak, fog, or leave big rings on her face. We love them!"
5.0,"I love the quality and texture. The straps are adjustable and don't feel too heavy over your shoulders. I haven't had the chance to tie up the corset. Overall I love this dress and will be wearing it to my friends wedding. I'm 5'4"" and 146 lbs if that helps with anything and a 34 D cup and got the dress in a medium"
5.0,Great looking watch that is different from any of my other watches.  Really unique looking.
5.0,Given as a gift. Looks bigger than actual size but recipient is happy with it.
5.0,I have rather heavy camera and  this neck  strap is just what it takes to be easy on the neck. Good strap.
5.0,It fit perfectly and was beautiful!
5.0,Got these for the hubby for Christmas and he loves them. They are sturdy and more of a matted black color. He has a wider face and they fit him perfectly.

5.0,These look SO much more expensive than they are!!! If only they came with a case... GREAT buy!
5.0,"I love love love this cap. My little one has a bigger head, after I washed it. It shrunk but a few tugs fit my baby. She was 2 months it kept her head and ears so warm and didn't bother her. We got so many compliments."
5.0,NOT BAD QUALITY  THAT GREAT DEAL!
5.0,"These are soft, well-made socks. Really cute. Make great gifts, too. And the top doesn't have a band, so they don't squeeze or constrict your ankle. Very comfortable overall."
5.0,"it arrived a day late, however the quality is great, the construction is sturdy and the adjustable buckle strap is a great detail. I can wear this hat with my ponytail or bun high up on my head and it's great."
5.0,It looks like so much more than the price.  I am so impressed !  I wear it without concern for breaking while working . It’s beautiful and it works . What more does a woman need from a piece of jewelry .

5.0,Beautiful and adjustable length!
5.0,"Beautiful, delicate earrings!"
5.0,These are nice comfortable flip flops with thicker soles. The soles are not as soft as yoga mat material but a bit firmer. The braided faux suede upper is comfortable as is the part that goes between your toes. The bottoms are textured and are nonslip. My feet are slightly wide and the width on these is ok. The length is also fine.<br />These are great for summer and going to the beach or just hanging around. The price is good.
5.0,I ordered the black color previously.  Want the brown color.  Fast shipping. comfortable.  Thank you
5.0,I absolutely love this product for my 5 yr old who still doesn’t know how to tie his shoelaces. I never have to worry about him tripping over his shoelaces at school. I also use them for my 9 yr old shoes as well.<br /><br />The seller was ever so gracious enough to send a replacement pair for an order I did not receive. Thank you again for being so understanding. I will definitively be buying more in the future for my children’s shoes.
5.0,"For those of us who do not have shoulders these shoulder pads are perfect!  It is important to square off your shoulders a little bit in order to balance your body type!  They are the perfect size, not at all like the 80s.  If you are in need of shoulders this is the shoulder pad for you"
5.0,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so bad-ass looking and the clock part is really nice too ^^!<br />I highly recommend this if buying a watch! ^^
5.0,High quality product send from within the United States. No problems with anything.
5.0,Great quality! We use these for Mary Poppins Halloween costume and they work very well.
5.0,The material was generous & soft. It arrived ahead of the date given & it was packaged well. The color didn't disappoint.
5.0,Great grip on case and for sure protected my phone through the many times I dropped it!

5.0,Good size eye glass
5.0,"The wallet is very good, I liked."
5.0,Perfect dress if: a. you don't have a belly or b. you don't care that your belly outline shows. The dress is super comfy and stretchy and makes me want to tone my belly up so I can wear this everywhere.
5.0,Don't even care it is a little too big; I wear it with a bandeau. The material is not soft at all but I am hoping with a few washes I can change that.
5.0,Me encanto mi vestido es muy suave . El color igual a la foto.
5.0,"i like them, and i really like the polarized lenses and frame. they could have made the lenses a bit longer"
5.0,I bought it for a surprise gift for my wife … secretly measuring her lol. In the end it was Beautiful and she looked perfect. Thank you.
5.0,These are so perfect. Lightweight and super stylish. Love them. Great quality.
5.0,This is very comfortable and the inner pocket is absolutely favorite.
5.0,These stocking are perfect
5.0,"I love, love, love this dress.  It was so cute, the fabric on top is soft and the fabric on bottom a little stiffer but still flowed nicely.  I was so excited to see it.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake of sizing up as I went off of the size chart and was in between sizes.  I wish I'd sized down instead of sizing up because it was like a potato sack on me.  I had to return it and by the time that got sorted out it was basically out of season for where I live (we're pretty much getting into winter now).<br /><br />So, I no longer have it, but that's completely my fault.  Do not size up!  If you're in between sizes, try sizing down instead.  It's supposed to fit a bit more snug up top and around the waist, loose fitting just doesn't look right."
5.0,"My fiancé is always cold, so when I saw these pants I knew he had to have them. It was a gamble because he’s pretty particular about his clothes, but he loves these pants! The inside fleece is so soft and warm and cozy, and the outer athletic style material is stylish and sleek. The pants have side pockets and cargo pockets and the style we selected has the jogger style cuffs. These are great for lounging or running errands. The medium fits him great and the length is perfect. For reference he’s 5’10, approx 170lbs.  May even get these in a second color. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Great watch. Very lightweight and attractive. I have had so many compliments on this watch and people are amazed when they hear the cost.
5.0,My daughter loves these!!  Need I say more??  I bought two pair.  Recommend!!
5.0,I purchased these for  nagging plantar fascittis.  They were the only insoles that worked.<br />I still use them to this day.  They don't smell and don't wear out like other insoles I've tried.<br />I'm about to place an additional order for a 2nd pair.  For my boots.
5.0,I ordered this a size larger because I wanted it to fit a little bigger. It is beautiful! I wore it with my bathing suit and with jean shorts.
5.0,great fit fun to wear lots of compliments at work
5.0,Wife loved this as a present once she got her new car and new purse.  Made of good quality and the crystals really look sharp and hold up well.
5.0,"I  go out dancing all night and don't lose anything or worry about where to leave my purse.  My iPhone SE can fit in the pocket, but usually I prefer to put my money and ID in the pocket and tuck my phone between the leg wallet and my leg, because then I can get to my phone faster.<br /><br />I wear women's pant size 10-12 US. It is a snug but comfortable fit. I forget it's even there."
5.0,Just what I needed thanks!!!

5.0,"I gave each of my coworkers one of these lovely little anchors, knotted on a small leather loop to thank them for bolstering my Faith during a very difficult Covid-19 year. Everyone was thrilled, they each got to choose which color they wanted... And ps, the Red White & Blue anchors were snatched up instantly... I wouldn't mind buying a big batch of those patriotic colors! Truly though, all of the colors were appreciated by all. The painted enamel looked wonderful, would recommend!"
5.0,"Nice feeling not to stiff, great size."
5.0,"these are legit waterproof! My daughter played and went sledding and didn't come back with soaked and soggy snow pants. Buying another pair for my other kids, who did come back soaked and soggy in a different brand. Land's End ftw!"
5.0,Hours and hours of fun for next to nothing in price. You are only limited by your imagination. Great buy.
5.0,My husband loves this shirt.  I bought three different novelty shirts and he said they fit well and he wears a 2X.
5.0,I bought it for summer wear...but I slipped it on after my shower...love it.
5.0,"Great item, great seller!"
5.0,I've always disliked what happens to my collars where the front where the top botton is leans outwards. I found these and they really work to keep the collars in line.
5.0,Quality slipper
5.0,My mother cried. She loves it
5.0,"The picture is clear and the mask is well made! It is super comfy and doesn't cling to my face when I breathe. It has a pocket that you can put a filter in if you prefer.<br /><br />One of the straps is longer than the other, but with the adjusts that doesn't matter. (Just maybe don't get this mask if you are like Monk.)  ;)<br /><br />Seriously, this mask is great! 5/5 recommend!"
5.0,"My 7 year old has practically lived in this rash guard for 3 solid months. My husband washes our swim suits every time we swim, which is several times a week since we have a pool. It’s withstood chlorine, salt water, and frequent washings and still looks bra and new. We are very happy.<br /><br />It does run a little large. I anticipate my daughter will be able to wear it again next year. But a medium was not so large that it wasn’t perfectly acceptable this year on her."
5.0,"Perfect!! Great quality, fit exactly as expected, and I got a TON of compliments!! I'm most excited about knowing this will still fit great even after baby is born. Bought in two colors, would absolutely buy again!"
5.0,"BUT...that's my fourth pair over the last 15 years or so!  I have issues with heal spurs and a friend recommended that I get a pair of Birkies way back when.  Seemed so expensive at the time--but it worked!  All the pain went away within the first month of wearing them!  So, I just cough up the money every 4 years or so and enjoy them."
5.0,"This is perfect when you just want to carry your phones, keys, lipstick and a little bit of funds. You won't be able to carry much more than that but it's perfect for a night out. Everything is protected and secure. It looks very nice and is a great style. It doesn't feel cheap or like it will fall apart. It actually surprised me at that price point. It definitely exceeds expectation. As I said, this will go with anything so is a good choice. This would be great to carry to class too, because your pen will fit right in there too, if you need it."
5.0,"Super great fit, neutral makes it easy to add any color on top!"
5.0,"I love them, the look and feel."
5.0,"Cute & Cuddly - it's large enough that I no longer lose my keys. It is large - thankfully I use a large purse. However, when I change to a clutch, I have to remove my keys from it as it takes up the whole thing."
5.0,: ))
5.0,Beautiful hat. Packaging was perfect protecting the hat well.
5.0,"Really like it, it's so thin, elegant looking a fine timepiece for its value"
5.0,Very warm love them
5.0,"These earrings are just what I needed to complete a special outfit.  They are different, snazzy and could be worn with a lot from jeans to out-on-the-town.  Love them!"
5.0,My grand daughter loved getting these for her birthday! She wears them everywhere! They are really cute! They are perfect!
5.0,"My husband likes the fit, the black color matched a lot of the sweat pants he already had."
5.0,Love this necklace and wear it all the time! Totally worth the wait to get it here!!!
5.0,"Love!!!! Got two rings, for the first initial of each my daughter and son! Love! So In style and dainty!"
5.0,"Great gift for a retired Marine, my husband."
5.0,Fits perfectly! I’m 5’3/126lbs I got it in a  medium.
5.0,"I love these shoes. Constantly get compliments and for dress shoes, they're pretty comfortable. Not &#34;lazy day&#34; or &#34;all day walking&#34; kind of comfy, but they get the job done.  My problem with most shoes is that my feet are wide and short, yet these worked out really well.<br /><br />I wear them most days out of the week. and unless i'm walking far distances (say, 30 minutes or so), I barely notice them on my feet. Haven't tested them in &#34;standing all day mode&#34; but I suspect they'll hold up well. Great quality. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Great find. Color lightened a little after the first wash, but holding up great otherwise."
5.0,My gd recently broke her big toe and needed something the was comfortable and provided stability.  She loved these and mom is also happy. -a win.
5.0,I love this dress!!! It’s pretty long but after washing it shrank in length so fits now. Might be a problem for women with that are taller. I’m 5’4
5.0,"I loved the crowns, they were so cute and actually high quality. I wish the beads were just a bit smaller, but other than that it was just what I wanted!"
5.0,My grandson is a huge Fortnite fan and was thrilled with these pjs.  They are very soft and cozy and fit well.
5.0,"I love it!  This is one of the more emotional purchases I have ever made in Amazon, I've never thought that I was going to find it, been out of my country for 2 decades and proud that my daughter wants to wear it in her graduation. Well made, good quality and super fast shipping."
5.0,Runs a little big. But I love the fabric and design. It's good quality.
5.0,Somewhat large but I love it! Ordered more in different colors &amp; will be ordering more in the future!
5.0,"My wife loves these. Are they really polarized? They don't seem like it, but she still loves them."
5.0,"Pretty decent quality sunglasses that come with two different cases, cleaning cloth, and a small tool for tightening the screws on the glasses. Great deal for the price."
5.0,"Absolutely loving these tank tops so far. Only have had them for a couple weeks now, but they fit extremely snug and stay breathable. These are super helpful for weight loss leaving loose skin around your stomach. I ordered a size down, so I opted for a small, and I’m glad I did. Fits well underneath all my shirts. Adds a good extra layer for the colder weather too."
5.0,"The recipient loves this shirt.  An avid fisherman, this keeps him cool and comfortable."
5.0,"Fit great, warm and a great value. Shipped as promised"
5.0,It's comfortable and I like the colors

5.0,I absolutely love this watch band. Its very classy and elegant.
5.0,The glasses are very big which is exactly what I wanted after eye surgery.
5.0,"Very nice fitted waist.  Looks awesome on my 22 year old grandson.  Easy to launder with little or no ironing.  When he travels, it goes along easily without wrinkling while he wears it or while it's hanging.  Quality made.  I would buy again."
5.0,"Comfortable, sounds pretty great!"
5.0,For the price these glasses are awesome. They truly look like they were from a Y2K time capsule. I feel like I look a lot better with these on. Please do yourself a favor and just get them. It seems like they’d flatter any face! :)
5.0,Love this blouse the sleeves are beautiful ture size if you want it a little bit longer and lose size up am a 5'5 and 175lbs.
5.0,"Im glad to receive my 53cm wedding gloves, they are perfect. Thanks, great price and quality. 23&#34;."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:a61dc3fb66ccaaf73dc5435558eac6a2]] I loooove this mask, i have a larger face. It dosnt hurt my ears it stay in relative place when i talk, its pretty easy yo breath in(minimal fogging for glasses wearers)  i recomend this highly. I will not this it is onoy 1 layer or rather 2 layers that qre VERY thin fused together."
5.0,Fit as expected not for shorter than 5-5 or 5-6
5.0,"UPDATE: After wearing these for quite some time, my wife absolutely loves them. They do not smell and are very light and comfortable. She will definitely get more.<br /><br />This is the second set she's purchased. She loved the first ones so much because they were cool, very lightweight and never seemed to show or smell of wear. Many times she would forget how long she wore them.<br /><br />My wife and I have tried bamboo socks before and really liked the fit and feel so I thought I’d try a different brand.<br /><br />These socks are very soft with thick fabric on the soles. The top of the foot is much thinner and more open material which helps them breath and stay cool.<br /><br />My wife was out all day on her feet, which normally get hot and sweaty. She noticed her feet were cool and dry. She also said the socks felt much lighter and more comfortable than her regular socks.<br /><br />She has now been wearing them all day, she turned to me and said, ""wow, my feet aren't even sweaty"". Now that's saying something. Looks like we'll be getting more.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Very soft.<br />- Snug but not too tight.<br />- Cool to wear.<br />- Fabric seems to allow the feet to breath.<br />- Light and comfortable.<br />- Keeps feet from sweating.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- None"
5.0,Super cute. Look just as advertised. I can't speak for how long the color on them will last but will update my review when I've given them a chance to be worn a few times.
5.0,"Love everything about this dress.  Comfortable, lightweight, figure flattering AND long enough for me at 5'8&#34;.  And who doesn't love a dress with pockets?! Currently contemplating which additional colors to purchase."
5.0,This is my 6th ordered pair. My new favorite compression sock brand!
5.0,The shirts are a great fit and the product of the material is great the fast delivery was fantastic and at a great Price
5.0,"Llegaron super rapido, y me gustaron mucho."
5.0,Love this! Fits great and looks great on! Can’t wait to wear this on Valentines Day
5.0,"I love the pockets! It is not quite as soft as I would like it to be, & the color is not quite like the picture. However, it was a good buy!"
5.0,...nice quality of felt...not paper thin...holds its shape very well...only issue is the &#34;description&#34;...no where does it say the &#34;&#34;color&#34;&#34;...I actually thought it was a charcoal (and the main reason I ordered it)...but its 'black'...and I already have 2 black ones...so this is going to find a new home...<br />...just wish the description would have said BLACK !....did anyone else think it was not black? hmmm
5.0,Gave to my daughters for xmas. They both loved! Very comfy.
5.0,"This dress is amazingly beautiful. I bought a lot of dresses lately, liking most of them,but this one is perfection. So well constructed,great quality, good packaging and fantastic material. I bought burgundy in L. Fits perfect. I am 5'7&#34;,225pounds, 36DDD with some wt in the middle section. You can't see any of this imperfections wearing this dress. It's so flattering. Simple and elegant.Looks luxurious.  RECCOMENED.<br />UPDATE. I bought 2 more dresses in 2 different colors. Navy fit great. Full satisfaction like the burgundy. The light blue/denim is beautiful, but I was disappointed because even same size L fit and fill like XL OR 1X. I decided to keep it and put a belt,but still inconsistency in sizing bother me."
5.0,"As a truck driver, I always have this with me in my bag. It is like part of the “tools” I need for the job. In CA I used to know when it was going to rain. In TX, it’s like it usually takes me by surprise especially when it rains in the summer times.<br /><br />This comes in very handy because it’s small and very light to be in my bag everyday, and it dries very fast. I still keep it in the plastic bag it came in and it’s still in like new condition."
5.0,"You can sleep in this if you want, but you may just want to wear it around the house. It feels good and it is nice looking. It will make you feel nicer looking."
5.0,Love these! They got great are fun and get lots of compliments!
5.0,"Nice band, comfortable on my Casio Mudmen GShock Solar watch!  Love the camo pattern, would like to see more colors for camo bands."
5.0,Very good goggles
5.0,Love it! I'll be ordering the red one as well!!
5.0,"****REVISED REVIEW****<br />Customer service contacted me and asked to send me a size S because I wasn't satisfied with the size M I initially ordered. And after receiving the clothes the fit is so much better! The collar on the size small is nice and snug on my collar the way it should be and the shorts and nice and tight. They even sent me a different style then the one I already which is the rugrats one and I LOVE it . Very satisfied with the customer service and the clothes. I would recommend others to buy jist make sure you know your size!! Im 5'2.... 140lbs and the S fits perfect.<br /><br />I got a medium and its just a little too big.... im 5'2 145lbs, the shorts literally go all the way up almost to the bottom of my breasts.... the top fits okay just the collar fits like its been stretched and is on backwards. Material isn't bad but it's not that comfy. I'll try another one in a small. But if it still doesn't fit good I wouldn't recommend or buy again."
5.0,"This is a beautiful classy bracelet.  I love pearls.  It was inexpensive, but looks much more expensive that it actually is."
5.0,"These are amazing. No rubbing, chafing etc... Unfortunately my tire went out my first ride and now I have a hole in the knee, but i'll def look to these if I need another pair or two. I went with a size bigger than the chart recommended (XXL)... I was concerned about length based off the size table but the overall fit was perfect. I'm 6'2 250 and wear a 38-40W / 32L."
5.0,"My husband totally loves this shorts, great for hiking in hot weather, water resistance, light weight, big pockets & nice look. Fits great"
5.0,comfy to work in.
5.0,"Light weight, great fit and very good job with glare control"
5.0,Fast shipping and product is excellent
5.0,Makes packing a breeze
5.0,"Grandson loves dinasors , he keeps looking at his feet."
5.0,"I love it, so stylish and cute and it is exactly as pictured."
5.0,These were a gift and she loved them. Thanks
5.0,"These shorts are what you would expect. They aren’t super thick, they are cotton, but they fit great and I would recommend getting them. Especially for the price. If you prefer a looser fit make sure to order a couple sizes up. I don’t mind the way they fit me but they are a little tight."
5.0,Love the dress. Fit perfectly.
5.0,My hubby said WOW. I love them! Makes you feel absolutely special :)
5.0,"Super cute blouse, can wear for almost anything."
5.0,My daughter got this for my son who had this item on his Christmas list and he loved it. It's very colorful and made of quality materials.
5.0,Looks great! Very good quality
5.0,Very Comfortable light weight feels like a second layer of skin.
5.0,"Before purchasing any merchandise, I must check the reviews of it. This product is prefect! I ordered a large and the size was as expected. I do believe the ratings are a little low. I say go for it! Although many have their own opinion about the size however, since it's a woman's jacket regardless of weight and size, women are porportioned differently. As for me, the jacket is true to size."
5.0,Serious nickel allergy and wore these for a week straight without itching and swelling. The backs could be more secure.
5.0,Great bag! I would appreciate more inside pockets but I am happy!
5.0,"my husband likes this a lot, he said its just like his other flannels he owns some are old mill brand and some from sam's club. this one fits as should."
5.0,Wonderful stitch pram! We get compliments everywhere we go! Super warm and cozy fits true to size and easy to get on and off!
5.0,Very comfortable hat and was easy to shape. I’ve received several compliments and many of my Veteran friends want to order hats as well.
5.0,A great size for a quick trip
5.0,"Very cute. Made a great dress for my Minnie Mouse Halloween costume and to wear on the regular. It was a little large for me up top but if I sized down it may have been too small on the bottom half....tends to be how it goes with my body type, though. It has a zipper on the side but I didn't need to use it since the fabric is stretchy. Not a big deal, but I had to steam iron it to get the wrinkles out even after washing it. Got a lot of compliments on it!"
5.0,"This crown is incredibly gorgeous: not only is it well made (with a welded metal back), the rhinestones and overall design look amazing.<br /><br />The packaging itself is also well thought out: mine came in a black box with a magnetized flap. Inside they included black paper ribbons that the crown was on top of, as well as a couple of heavy-duty bobby pins. Immediately out of the box, I noticed that the crown’s topmost section was bent, but it was easy to bend back into place. One other flaw I saw was that the two main gemstones on the front are misaligned, but other than that, especially from a distance, these defects aren’t noticeable at all.<br /><br />Like I said before, the crown’s back and base all look welded together, although the gemstones are glued into place. The crown is easy to wear, as it fits like a headband and the ends have loops where you can secure it with the included bobby pins. The color is accurate to the pictures, though in the sunlight it looks a lot lighter (and the smaller stones are a lot more visible)."
5.0,Product looks like the picture and fit my friend who is 7' tall.
5.0,I absolutely love this shirt. It is very comfortable. It is a thicker material but it doesn’t make you roast in it. It is well made and a very nice quality. There were no loose threads. The color is almost gold.  I am 5’7” and 195lbs. I wear a size 14 in pants. I wear a large in shirts and 40DD in bras. I ordered a large and it fit perfectly. I would definitely recommend this shirt.
5.0,"Very nice, very warm."
5.0,"I wanted something different and this product was just that. I love the blending of the different colors. It fits a little big, but that is fine."
5.0,i purchased these glasses thinking that they would help me with halo effect that happens at night when i drive.  they didn't work for me but would make a really nice pair of glasses for someone who needed them.
5.0,"I love this tote!  It is just the right size for travel, can easily fit my laptop and/or my tablet, with room for a couple books and personal items I would typically need another purse for.  Nice size zip pockets inside as well as pockets for sunglasses and phone."
5.0,My godson loves these shoes and we ordered a second pair in blue.  He says they are very comfortable and &#34;cool&#34; so that is good.
5.0,"Fits well, fabric is soft and comfortable for baby. Plus, he looks adorable in it!"

5.0,I thought about going for her birthday she loved them  Is it very good got to go back to small
5.0,If you are thinking of getting it do it! After having my first baby it’s been so hard finding one that fits. This fits like a glove with extra room and it’s also very flattering.
5.0,Very nice bag! It’s stiff (which I like) and we’ll put together!
5.0,They were as advertised to be!
5.0,"SUPER cute! love it, the strings are a little long, but thats easy to cut"
5.0,I'm very happy  to have a nice  collar  in my  drawall
5.0,Use to subside EMF frequency attacks around the feet.
5.0,I was skeptical of these based on the reviews. But they are so cute and I could actually find them in my size so I took a chance. When you first take them out the package they pretty stiff and cheap. But once you have them on your feet they are comfy and warm. I love that the bottoms are thick so you can’t feel the cold floor and it feels like a pillow. Love these I want more!!!
5.0,Ferrets like it.
5.0,Gave to my son for Christmas and he is always wearing it this winter due to all this CA rain we've been getting. Happy it's being used all the time.

5.0,"Received many complements.  Comfortable, smooth, soft"
5.0,Se ve bien.
5.0,My son LOVES these shoes!  They are super classy looking and seem like good quality.  I had to exchange them for a bigger size so I would order slightly larger than usual.  They look and work like regular shoes without the wheels in them which is perfect for school.

5.0,"Very pretty piece, hangs well!"
5.0,Great fit for my 7.75 inch wrist on a Casio Mdv301....really looks good on this dive watch!  Good value...
5.0,"Great Flip Flop. I needed a good pair and it's hard to find some with the comfort of these that last! Get a size bigger than your foot, and it hugs your foot shape."
5.0,Great fit and love to wear everyday
5.0,"I bought these as an anniversary present for my boyfriend and I. We are not long distance, but we like to wear them to display our affection. Anyway, we've had them for roughly 2 years now and they are still perfectly intact. Very pleased with the quality of these bracelets."
5.0,Loved this outfit it is adorable can't wait until my goddaughter can wear it!
5.0,Cute & comfortable.  Wish I had also ordered one in a larger size since I've gained some weight.  May still do that!
5.0,used as a costume piece and it looked better than I expected.
5.0,I chose to wear this piece on my thumb.  I love it. Perfect fit!
5.0,Amazing is all I have to say!
5.0,"Well, first - this is a quality product: well-made of good material, and together with it being sssooo good- looking that I get compliments on it just about every time I wear it, even from strangers!<br />  And it’s WARM!<br />  I couldn’t be more pleased with it, and I’m about sure you will feel the same."

5.0,Cute NYC skyline necklace.  Love it.
5.0,Excellent for the price.  works well.  Legs do NOT roll up... that's a miracle!
5.0,I'm hard on sunglasses. I usually buy cheap and expendable. I have a tendency to jam them in a pocket with keys or put them down and walk away. I lose a lot. I bought these with 3 other brands and I'm back on Amazon to buy a second pair of Bevis so I have an immediate backup when I lose these. They feel and look so well I find myself treating them far better than most I've paid 10 times more for.  Quality seems fine but they are definitely not Spys or Maui Jims. No idea how long they will last but I my sunglasses never die a natural death anyway. These won't last long because they are my go-to pair now.  I really really like them. The best parts are the soft rubber on the bridge so the feel good and soft rubber on the earpiece so they hang on tight.  I may have just talked myself into a third pair :).
5.0,My jaw dropped when I saw this on my 5’6” 140lbs daughter today! Absolutely gorgeous and the quality is just as great!
5.0,"Nice lens, OEM quality, easy to install, polarization is really good.  I'd buy this again in a heartbeat."

5.0,I like these so much I bought three other ones. Very comfortable and plenty of space for my cell phone in one of the two pockets.  I'll probably buy a few more...
5.0,"Simple, light and does what it is intended for."
5.0,This pants are great on quality and very wearable for any summer activity. Better get two on first shipment ….. will regret not getting them !

5.0,"Great quality, great look, great everything about it. The color is a touch darker than in the picture, I was going for more of a cognac color but it's so well made that it's totally worth keeping it."
5.0,"These socks are adorable, they look exactly like the reference photos on the site. Love wearing them and looking at Gojou on my feet, haha. 🥹 Only advice when washing these socks: don’t wash them in hot/warm water—it will make the socks, overall, become deformed."

5.0,This is Amazing!  Better than I could have expected!

I wish I could find these dipped in real<br />Gold. Otherwise they are perfect for making jewelry!"
5.0,Very nice belt made with high quality materials. I was looking to replace a &#34;well worn&#34; Tommy Bahama belt of similar design and this was a fine replacement. I spent more than I had hoped but I expect this high quality belt will last a long time. I would definitely buy again.
5.0,"My kid loves these. They are a hair large, but that's what we wanted as his feet will continue to grow ha!<br />These fit around his ankle well and allow you to tighten them enough so that they don't fall off. Not all shoes have enough of that!"
5.0,Great! I used these as shower shoes for my most recent deployment.
5.0,"Husband loves them, light, durable, and comfortable. He wants more like this whenever they wear out."
5.0,"Great watch band, great value, Amazing customer service! I bought this a few months ago and it still looks brand new with daily wear.

5.0,"Great product, super good quality"
5.0,This coat I brought is warm and cozy to wear.

5.0,"I don’t usually give any review so it’s gonna be my first time ever. I am just super amazed how this inexpensive hat made me look great per my opinion, I am usually into designer brands especially LV & Gucci, but this Gossifan brand from Amazon caught my eye and being the last item in-stock I tried, BOOM ‘tis perfect for what I need."
5.0,This shirt is perfect for our hot and humid summers here in the South.
5.0,I Love this top. I got the red and white...
5.0,It’s the best belt ever had. Always the right fit.
5.0,"Gave this as a gift. I loved it and the receiver loved it. Very shiny (slightly shimmery not glossy) rose-gold color, and it was easy to apply bands to the apple watch. Not sure how long the product will last/product's durability as it has only been owned for one week. Will buy in different colors."
5.0,"Well, I bought them for my daughter, who I have on weekends, Friday afternoon, till Sunday Evenings, She's had them on since dinner Friday, after noon, we even went to see Star Wars last night, She put on her slip on boot, a T-shirt, and wore her footed PJ's to the theater ! So, I'm gonna guess that she really likes them !"

5.0,"My nephew loves it!  I went up a size, since it will likely shrink when washed and so he can grow into it."
5.0,"I love the graduation because it does not cut circulation at the knee, which is often an issue with compression socks. These also feel like you have arch support due to the engineering of the compression areas. Legs and feet aren't tired and that helps for you not to be!  Quality product and good price."
5.0,"Shipping to USA was a bit lengthy, this was expected. Hat is great quality, warm, and just as described on listing. Tightly knit fibers on outside and soft and warm fleece on the inside. Absolutely love it!!!"

5.0,"This piece has a good weight to it and is very sparkly. I ordered 2, and both came in perfect condition."
5.0,Absolutely wonderful dress!
5.0,"perfect size, arrived quickly and very beautiful especially for the price."
5.0,My son loved it. He got it as an early Christmas gift . Excellent quality.
5.0,Honestly my favorite tank top for summer and working out! I honestly love this product and just want to buy every color! They are so comfortable and light weight I love them. It’s my go to for warm sunny days and the hood for me is a plus as well! I know it’s a mens tank top but I’m a woman and it fits very well! Not too low cut in the armpit it fits just right and fits true to size! I can’t say enough about these tank tops! This is my third order and I plan to order more
5.0,"This just came in yesterday. I had bought it for my best friend for her birthday.  We both love stuff from James Harvey Danger.  She also super loves sugar skulls.  The bag is so cute.  I like that it zips!  Anyways, the gift was a big hit and she loves it!"
5.0,"I have Five pairs of these shorts, all different. That said, they all fit perfectly the same. I've learned to love my size 20W butt. These make me feel better about that."
5.0,"For the low price of approximately $6 each, these tank tops are amazing. I bought a size small, and they are not compression on me, but fit nicely--perfect for running or just wearing. To get a compression fit, I would size down. The quality is good--still amazed at the low cost--and the colors are bright. I'm used to playing rediculous Nike prices for the same thing, so I'm very pleased with my purchase. I'm 5 '2&#34; and weigh just under 110 for comparison."
5.0,This product is perfect for the biker in your life. It keeps them very warm and it’s nice that it sleeveless. It helps that they don’t get overheated.

5.0,"Item was as described, fast  delivery, Great seller. Thank You!"
5.0,Love them very warm and fit as expected.

5.0,Daughter loves the glasses.
5.0,It’s warm and cozy. I like it.
5.0,Always good... No complaints here!!
5.0,This is a very comfortable sports bra with great support. My husbands thinks the zipper is fantastic since it makes the bra absolutely pop off if the other straps aren’t secured. I machine washed and line dried without any issues. There is a little flap of fabric at the bottom of the zipper than kind of sticks out but it’s not a deal breaker. The back straps are super cute.
5.0,"Divinos,  hermosos y bellos"
5.0,"Exactly what I expected, great design!"
5.0,I love these underwear’s. They are boxers but do not stretch below the upper thighs. Very comfortable and really love the breathable fabric between the crouch. Made of good quality fabric. The elastic waist band have a firm fit. Plus you get 4 pair in the pack. I would purchase these underwear boxers because of the quality material and they represent good value.
5.0,Extremely comfortable to wear & dresses up any basic top rather nicely.  Quite fun stuff and looks awesome on!
5.0,Pretty much same size as the picture. Just under 2 inches. Heavy weight. Cord is rubber and cannot easily be replaced. That is the only downside but the cord itself is fine and well made
5.0,Very soft material. It was great quality and large enough to be able to do a wide variety of styles. Will be purchasing a few more in the very near future.
5.0,"Material is fitted almost like an elastic feel.. polyester.. real thin good for looks, fashion jacket. No other purpose Zipper was a bit stiff when I first tried zipping it up. but I love it"
5.0,Looks pretty great!
5.0,Just what I expected. I don't have to carry & dig for tissues in my purse any more & can wash them with my laundry each week!
5.0,Good jersey just a bit pricey
5.0,"I have been getting these minimalist wallets for gifts. I am keeping a number of different ones for myself. I find they work great for carrying in my front pocket and I can put in identification, money and credit or debit cards. I don't need to load it up with lots of items, especially when I am in a different country. With the RFID, I also don't have to worry about someone skimming my credit card chips."
5.0,Needed for camping supplies. Works great
5.0,As a light completed person of color these were perfect. And the stubs were such an added beauty.
5.0,Really impressed with these socks so far. They're incredibly soft and fit really well on my size 11 feet. I'll definitely be buying more of these.
5.0,"Okay, yes, the twist tie front is confusing to figure out at first, but once I did I could not be happier! This dress is soft, comfortable and gorgeous. I recently put on some weight and I feel so slim and pretty in this 🥰 I am 5’3 and about 160 currently. I ordered a MEDIUM and it is perfect and will still work if I gain or lose some weight"
5.0,Ordered an L (10) and it fits my daughter PERFECTLY! I did measure her to ensure I was getting the right size! It's perfect and the color (light blue) is EXACTLY what she wanted!  I will definitely buy more colors in this leotard!
5.0,Daughter loves them. Super warm and comfy
5.0,I love the transition quality!

5.0,Quality is Amazing but I’m a small size and S didn’t fit me too small. definitely if you a regular L need to get a XL. had to reorder for my sister

5.0,"Love it.  I am a man with an average head, and it fits just right.  Love the quality of the item."

5.0,"I am pleasantly surprised by this sweater.  I bought this sweater to go over some of my work dresses that I wear to the office. Normally, when I order from Asian sellers, the size is always off.  I have so many pairs of shoes and I can't tell you how many tops I've had to return because they are all so small.  In fact, I told myself I wouldn't order anything more from Asian sellers but this was the only sweater I found from countless internet sites that I loved.  So I ordered one size up and it fits perfectly.  The pearl clasp gives it just the right touch of elegance! I am 5 9&#34; and normally wear a large. I ordered the X Large and it fits great.  And actually, I could have ordered my normal large and it would have fit.  However, since I am wearing it with a summer dress, the size is perfect.  I have long arms and this sweater arm length fits me to a tee.  The sweater is soft and very feminine.  I am so pleased with it. I couldn't be happier!"
5.0,PLEASED WITH PURCHASED!!!
5.0,I Absolutely Love Them!
5.0,"They seriously look like Ray Bans. Awesome, cheap sunglasses that look fashionable and definitely wearable. I live in SoCal and I believe that any poor college student should definitely own a pair."
5.0,super swell.
5.0,"Good value, good quality, great fit.. ticks all the rigt boxes... love them."
5.0,Bought for my 14 year old to wear on her birthday. She loves it
5.0,"Love this hat!<br />Looks - a bit more stylish than a typical baseball cap - the shape is more rectangular than usual bowling ball shape.<br />Functionality - it really does fold up and fit in a pocket! Or a purse or carry-on bag. Takes up minimal space.<br />Fit - Good fit for me. Did not see any way to make adjustments, so check sizing before ordering.<br />Misc. - Depending on how thick and high your ponytail is, you may have issues wearing this hat. Ellewin makes a similar hat that has an opening for a ponytail and an interior drawstring for adjustments. The bill is longer, and it folds in thirds. I have both and like them both but for different occasions - yard work vs hiking vs casual wear."
5.0,Love the color of the band and flexibility. Hopefully will have no issues with it being magnetic and that it will wear nice.
5.0,This is a very nice looking watch . The picture here does not do it justice .<br /><br />This is a very nice looking watch . The picture here does not do it justice . You can find better pics elsewhere . The face has a 2 layer look and the center has light vertical stripes .<br />It is a large watch with a large pretty face .<br />I found a video on how to remove band links on youtube .
5.0,Good quality. Low price. Washed well.
5.0,They alright for making rods ties prolly do better with larger mm line but then limited to beads to be used
5.0,"Really like this bag.  This is my fourth one.  Swiss Gear please put a rubber pad on this side pocket.  My last one tore and I glued the material back together so it wouldn’t rip more, it just looks really bad.  Other than that it’s a great bag."
5.0,Got these for my granddaughter she likes them and wears them a lot.  Perfect that she can just slip them on.  Colors are great and fit is good she said they are comfortable I would buy them again
5.0,"Thank you thank you. These are fantastic for people with dry/sensitive eyes that cause sensitivity to light.  Very dark.  Previously I've only found glasses dark enough through Locs, which are wonderful too but I like to have a different style option.  These are a classic and flattering design and I plan to get more!"
5.0,Love this wallet! Compact design; surprising fits everything I need...and more.
5.0,So cute and easy to throw on! Can dress up or keep it casual. I’m actually wearing it right now :)
5.0,Arrived very quickly and product was just as expected.
5.0,"This is the best face covering I have purchased since the beginning of the pandemic. My husband drives a truck all day and has to get in and put a lot. Instead of putting on a mask over and over, he just pulls this up or down."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:873f36d2d613c2874811d720eebd7a97]] The Modern ŌM First Root Chakra Men’s Bracelet is the very best precious stones Chakra beaded bracelet. The video shows the box contents on table including bracelet and information cards about the materials used: Sterling Silver, Black Sardonyx, Striped DZI Beads and Shungite. Notice the Chakra shape of the talisman, hand craftsmanship and beauty of the natural stones. Wow! As you can see, Modern ŌM’s amazing First Root Chakra Men’s Bracelet is a cut above the ordinary for its authenticity, artistry and mystical powers.

5.0,I got these earrings for my friend birthday and he really enjoy wearing  these earrings.<br />and these our his first pairs of black set of earrings.
5.0,"The hood is just right, as is the fit. She is 10 months and there is not much growing room but she will make it through the rest of winter and early spring."
5.0,"This was perfect for my Halloween costume (with a little paint). The light gray was a little sheer, so pasties were required. But this was super comfortable for wearing all night. Would recommend!"
5.0,"These are the most comfortable shoes I've had in a long time.  I love that they are slip-ons, I get tired of tying double knots on shoes with laces."
5.0,"Got it for a wedding but I don’t think it’s dressy enough, still super cute, I wrapped the bottoms too for a different look. Although this color is somewhat see through. I wear a small or xs and definitely could have used an xs instead it is a little big"
5.0,"I have never had a better pair of sunglasses !!  They are not heavy sitting on your glasses, which is a plus !  I use these to drive at night and the lens that are on the side of the glasses help really well with side glare !!"
5.0,Got my rhinestone brooch they are perfect beautiful plus's better then picture very happy I'm going to order some more.
5.0,Absolutely am in love with this graphic T! The material is wonderful the printing is in line and perfect. I love sunflowers I love the message the shirt brings. It’s super comfy and cozy. It is looser but not so loose that it still doesn’t show your form. I highly suggest a shirt
5.0,Best driving glasses ever...I'm never without a pair of these and a backup pair....can wear them right until dusk glare never a problem no headaches and they darken with sunlight to always give the right amount of tint.
5.0,Easy to purchase and my husband loves it.  Can't ask for more!
5.0,Very good underwear.
5.0,Well I bought this mask not because I was on drugs or I gave some sort of weird infatuation with pigeons.  I just simply bought it because I think it’s hilarious. Girls find it creepy while guys think it’s funny. Maybe it’s just a guy thing I don’t know... But I do have to say it fits very well and the plastic smell from the inside can be breeze off or wipe off from. Overall cool item and nice quality.
5.0,"We had an issue with the shipping. The seller was very nice and replied quickly. I bought these as a gift for my husband, he loves them."
5.0,"Love this, super soft, satin lined inside. I wore it today with a pair of jeans. Thank you"
5.0,"This outfit is really cute and perfect for the cooler weather! My son normally hates hats, but he doesn’t pull this one off and will actually take a nap in it. It fits as expected, and didn’t shrink much after washing and drying it. I love the little tag on the hat. The “I love you this much” on the wrong is so cute and makes me really happy when I see it. The snaps make diaper changes quick and easy, so that’s awesome for us parents!"
5.0,LOVE!!!! STRONG & STURDY!!!!!
5.0,It super cute!!
5.0,Es una hermosura de disfraz. Impecable!

5.0,I love my Esmeralda ring
5.0,Really cute lanyard with ID holder. Well constructed. Nice for cruising! Thanks.
5.0,"I bought the size of shirt I normally wear. This shirt is designed to fit loosely. Fits just like it should - loosely. I like that I can move my arms and shoulders without a shirt tug. It also breaths too and that is refreshing.<br /><br />If I were to have one “con,” I suppose it would be that the shirt is fairly square and tight around the hips. If you have wide hips, the shirt tends to hug. I notice the model in the photo is thin-framed so it appears that the shirt hangs. Still fits and looks great though.<br /><br />I plan on buying another color when it is back in stock."
5.0,These are adorable and a good price. My daughter loves them!
5.0,awsome ring I love It&#60;3

5.0,Perfect for our cruise. Good quality. Fast delivery.
5.0,"(I have been using it about a month or so) at first i thought it would be too big, but i eventually got used to the size...not a big deal lol first world problems. Also, the material is good quality and i can see myself using this wallet for a solid number of years. My only gripe or constructive criticism would be to put the keychain at the bottom so the keys hang below the wallet rather than over. when i open my wallet, i find myself having to open it upside down or flipping the keys over it and it’s just annoying, but other than that i am happy with my purchase and will likely buy this product or from this company again."
5.0,"Beautiful gift for my bro- nice quality, beautiful colors. FF"
5.0,"So Lovely, ONE OF MY FAVORITE PAIRS !!!"

5.0,"This cape has been a godsend. My grandson would cry when I would cut his hair because he was itching so bad. I purchased this and it snaps snugly around his neck and no hair shavings get on his skin anymore. The fabric is soft and flowy (comfortable). It's a much more pleasant experience for both of us. Why would you put your little one through the itching, purchase this cape. It's a must!"

5.0,"I ordered these gloves in December and they arrived sooner than promised. I am THRILLED with them!! They cover all the way to the first knuckle from my fingertips. They fit perfectly and are very comfortable.  They make a huge difference in how cold I feel overall. My hands get so cold, but I can wear these when typing on the computer and they are very comfortable.  I did have a small problem with threads pulling out at the fingertip openings but I used the suggestion a reviewer left about using a lighter to singe the threads and it completely stopped the problem! I LOVE these gloves and would highly recommend them to anyone who has a problem with cold hands!!  I have not washed them yet so I can't speak to that."
5.0,"Very cute, comfy top! The fabric is soft and it fits true to size. I do think I might tack the edges of the appliqués down with a few quick stitches, though."

5.0,Love these pants have purchased several pairs.
5.0,"These come in so handy for trips with the hard suitcases that don't always have zipper enclosures inside! I also like them to sort and use as drawers while vacationing. We took a long trip and went on an overnight trip during the long trip, so I made an overnight bag out of these. It worked great as I didn't have anything smaller than my luggage to use for an over night trip and I didn't want to buy a small duffel bag."

5.0,"I wish it weren't laser.  But how could you otherwise get the message across?  I've made six bracelets out of Italian charms, trying to cover different interests, periods of my life, talents, people, successes, associations, and it wasn't until the last bracelet that I added the Ph.D.  Humility held out until then, but I began to feel . . . . if you've got it, flaunt it?"
5.0,They are beautiful and worth the price
5.0,"Beyond lovely, it took my breath away, it's a perfect fit around my neck... this one's a keeper. I feel tall and thin in this when in truth I'm short and puffy. Worth every penny, so unexpected, it's now become my showcase neckless."
5.0,Boyfriends’ favorite wallet

5.0,Soft fabric. Very flattering
5.0,"Worse this dress to a all white event . Dress came just as described, was expecting it to be a different material but I LOVED the material it wasn’t cheap. I would recommend to order a down size I ordered a 16 and still had a lot of room"

5.0,"I bought 3 belts histock 1.5"" camel,hanks everyday no break 100 year and hide & drink handmade bourbon.<br />all 3 are great belts and should last, they seem to be built well and the sizing matches up. The main different<br />histock is more of a dress belt and feels solid. the Hanks belt is a thick strong belt, it's nice looking and feels good<br />but you could also use this as a leather belt drive. The Hide & Drink was the most unique belt, you can tell it is handmade<br />in a good way and the leather feels awesome. A good casual dress belt. Out of the 3 the Hanks belt get used daily."
5.0,I am 5'5 150 lbs and got an L and it fits absolutely beautifully! It accentuated my curves and the sheerness of the sleeves also made it so much more pretty! One of the prettiest dresses I have ever purchased.

It was made in Falmouth and trying to keep it there.  We bought these to go with our t-shirts that are also neon pink. We need to be seenand this cor is perfect!

5.0,The nightgown is just perfect for me. Amazing quality and it has pockets on both the sides too which helps to hold my phone or other things.<br />The price is also reasonable and I ordered the medium sized one which suites me very well I am around 5ft tall.<br />This one is very soft and without feeling rough and heavy. It's very well designed and extremely comfortable wearing it and this suites any age group.
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted.  Fast shipping, good packaging.<br />This was a gift, and so far we have had no issues.<br /><br />Great shine to them, she loves them!"
5.0,I sent this to one of my granddaughters to wear in court against the man that abused her. It helped keep her calm and protected. Thank you
5.0,Perfect...shipping took absolutely forever
5.0,"I’ve not seen anything like this, it’s unique and super cute and funny on my little one. It’s cute with red jeans or darker denim that matches the gingham sleeves. Or even black pants"
5.0,"my friends want to know where I got it , my sister sent it to me from Amazon"
5.0,Good looking and feeling shirt.
5.0,"Okay so far these seem amazing. Amazon was recommending a medium, which seemed off (115 5'6""). I got a small and am very glad I did. My waist is 25/26 inches and they are JUST right, and larger and they would be too loose. I do wish they were a little longer, but I'm fine with it as I only wear flats. Might update if they shrink much. If you are any taller than me, 32 inch inseam, these are going to be too short. The material is super thin, but seems durable, which is why I wanted them to begin with. Mosquitos love me and I live in the southern US. This print is also better than I expected, more muted. I chose it because it was a little cheaper than the others, but I'm actually quite fond of it. I was worried it might look tacky."
5.0,Best sunglasses I ever owned
5.0,It was very nice the quality is okay for the price....very pretty....I can't wait to wear this!
5.0,The tissu is good I like it

5.0,"Love these leggings! Very comfortable and squat proof. They are more of a stretchy material rather than a shaping material, but I think that makes then perfect for lounging or workouts. They are also more of a purple/blue color than a grey. For reference I am 5'4 and normally a 4/6 pants. I bought a medium but could have gotten a small for a more snug fit! Overall great purchase!"
5.0,Was very pleased and felt good on
5.0,"I absolutely love it! It glistens on my wrist! The instructions and even the thumbtack! Thank you, will purchase another one."
5.0,RINGS ARE GREAT
5.0,I wore this dress for Mother's day and absolutely loved it.
5.0,These glasses are as described..bought them for minor detail use in surgery and they have helped..didn’t realize the piece around the ear can be manipulated to fit my ear so that was a nice surprise. Overall happy with them for the price.
5.0,"Clip could be a bit bigger, but all around solid. Not unhappy."
5.0,Doesn't lift the rear end as much as I thought it would but the wide band around the stomach holds you in comfortably all day.

5.0,Well made ...like it!
5.0,"Very cute, comfortable, and always get a ton of compliments when it's worn!"
5.0,My Girlfriend was in her best friends wedding as the maid of honor in Texas. The entire wedding was country themed and we needed boots that would work well with her dress. We found these at a local boot shop here in town but they didn't have her size. They looked wonderful in the wedding and everybody complimented her on her cute boots. There is a decorative chain that runs under the boots arch that was somewhat concerning when we first saw it but it sits very high and doesn't ever drag or move at all.<br /><br />Great product and was a few dollars cheaper here on Amazon.
5.0,"This dress is so, so flattering and the color is absolutely gorgeous in person. I get so many compliments. It definitely has a vintage look and feel to it.  I've actually worn it to work without it looking too costumey.  But it would be absolutely perfect for WWII or 1940s themed event, swing dancing, etc."
5.0,My daughter was jealous of my son's &#34;man shorts&#34; so we got her her own boxers. She loves them!!
5.0,Love these shorts the fit great and size is on point.
5.0,"When Zaclatore screwed us over by selling dresses they don’t have in stock and promising them by certain dates and left us without a pageant costume, I ordered the pink/gold one from WM dot com instead of AZ, who keeps dropping the ball on shipment delays and customer support, and had this dress for no additional shipping within 48 hours.  It is stunning in person and we will keep it.  That said, she needed red and her size wasn’t available so it won’t be the one we wear to the performance this weekend."
5.0,I bought it for my Nephew.  He likes the colors.
5.0,Pretty.  It adds a punch to a basic pink cashmere sweater
5.0,"Very solid, A lot of storage space.<br /><br /> Love it"
5.0,"I read all the reviews about it coming small, so I ordered a size too big.... and that's exactly what it is, too big. So I should have just ordered my size."
5.0,Really nice....surprised by the price
5.0,"Very happy with this product (though I had my fingers crossed for a turtle), they're durable, well made, and very helpful. They arrived very quickly as well. My only problem was with the shipping costing more than the actual product."
5.0,Beautiful and well made. Perfect skull earrings for summer dresses.
5.0,"I bought this neclace for a Woodstock-themed party and it looked great.  It's just like the picture and the levels are pretty and seemed like the quality I was expecting for the price.  It does tangle like crazy, but I've never had a layered necklace that didn't."
5.0,Awsome ....
5.0,In love with this dress.  The top is my favorite part. Relaxed t shirt type of fit in a comfy material.  Skirt drapes nicely and is a sort of slinky material. My only wish is that the tie around the waist was a wide band. I’m 5’6”  36D and wear an XL.
5.0,This is great quality and comfortable! Warm and cozy
5.0,Works if right size of being snug small is for a 5 year old that’s what I discovered after trying several sizes
5.0,"Suits my needs and taste in a wallet perfectly.  Exterior leather is not brushed or buffed smooth, but has a texture to it.  That means it doesn't slide out of my pocket easily so that it gets left behind accidentally.  Fits into rear hip pocket perfectly.  Interior compartments are properly sized for credit cards and such.  Cash area is divided into two areas, which is fine for me.  Having RFID built in means I don't need those extra wallet sleeves for protection, so the wallet is thinner."
5.0,Excelente precio y excelente calidad
5.0,"I have Nike Air Force 1 High LV8. These look sick as they side reflective material just makes this pop in certain lighting. Also, there's a satisfying noise every time I tie my shoes. Also, first time using non-flat laces. Love it."

5.0,Amazing love them so comfortable and easy to put on and take off no more buckles I have arthritis in hands and this is so much easier for me teenager even loves them.... ❤ & NO MORE SWEATING under watch band! Yay!!!!!

This is not cheaply made or cheaply packaged. This will last for years!! Thanks!! I would highly recommend this seller and this product to anyone who is looking to invest or purchase anything similar to this. Even though I received this item at a discounted rate, this is truly my honest opinion of the product, after trying it for myself. Thanks so much for the quality and customer service!"

5.0,Extremely comfortable socks!
5.0,"So far so good, my son even tested to make sure it was water proof while washing his hands. The instructions were okay and we were able to turn off the hourly chime. It fits him well."
5.0,"My husband loves these socks, very stylish!"
5.0,"Frankly, I have no idea who Rick and Morty are but my son sure seems to like them. He has used the lanyard to hold his keys and it is very well made, considering he just tosses them anywhere.."
5.0,"Everyone loved my blouse, got lots of complements."
5.0,"Fit is perfect, material hangs really well and is very slimming. does not cling to your skin. Really love it."

5.0,Great boot have had them for years!
5.0,Used it on a New Balance RunIQ watch.  Works great.  The band is a bit long for my small wrist - but looks and works great.
5.0,LOVE THESE.  ORDERING ANOTHER PAIR!
5.0,I generally like my Amazon items to have 4 stars and up with positive reviews but I gave this item a chance.  So glad I did!!  The dresses are just a tad bigger than I thought they would be and they are nice and stretchy.  I like the feel of the fabric as well.  And they are cute!!  3 of these for less than $15 was a great buy for me and if my teen likes them I will buy her some too.
5.0,Even more gorgeous in person! It is so beautiful! And was such a good price. It's heavy and nicely made and a decadent size. I love it! And it arrived early!

5.0,"Good one, recommended"
5.0,The earrings were exactly what I expected. I find them to be very pretty and a very good value. As with most earrings in this style the first time or so that you try to close it can be a bit difficult (or maybe I'm a bit weak!) but it works perfectly and doesn't fall out.
5.0,"This watch strap is shockingly nice, I don't know what strap some other reviews got sent but the one I received is easily as nice as some $50 straps on the market. The leather on the top looks and feels like bridle leather and the leather on the bottom is nice and soft. So far I have zero complaints."
5.0,Super comfortable and soft feeling. Great as a base layer for cold weather. It’s stretchy and fits as expected.
5.0,Perfect for my Elton John costume! 😎
5.0,This is made well. Fits great and has adjustable straps.
5.0,Super cute and love the front screw on style
5.0,"I purchased a size smaller than guided to in the description as I have small hands in length (short fingers) - thinking they might work better, which they DO...I am very pleased with the quality and the touch screen ability although they still are a bit long for my fingers but I expected that to be true. They fit snug and work well to keep moisture away when handling damp items such as my dog's leash or snow shovel, etc."
5.0,Excellent buy looks great.
5.0,"Very pretty and looks so much more expensive than it was, the  lace cardigan cover-up is very pretty and the fabric is very very nice"

5.0,Fun tie for the season.
5.0,Super cute!..I love the style. I will buy again soon. Thank you
5.0,I've been looking for fold over shorts for sooooo long. It's rare to find some in bigger sizes. These are super comfy and hold my fat in in all the right places. I need like 5 more pairs.
5.0,"These pj’s are the most comfortable set I think I have ever own. The size I’d right on. The shorts are a good length, so they do not show too much. They are cool for hot nights and they wash and dry great. Will be ordering again."
5.0,I love crocs.  I have another pair like these in a pink color.  Super comfortable and<br />I wear them a lot.
5.0,Both pairs were given as gifts.

5.0,Very comfortable from new. Very nice and even dyeing and great quality embroidery. Feels great even for someone with no forehead hair (embroidery is not too abrasive on bare skin).

5.0,I bought it for my husband's birthday.  He loves it.
5.0,"Really cute scarf! Very nice addition to my collection.  Very light and smooth and the colors are perfect! It is very light and I think it would have been better if it was like an infinity scarf.  Because it is so silky and light it always slides and unwinds, so you always need to keep it in place and correct it.  But either way, its a really cute scarf!"
5.0,"My wife liked the print design.  It was a thinner fabric than expected, however, it was not see through. The thin fabric may be just what is needed in the summer months.  It has a more polyester feel than cotton and is a typical straight boxy T-shirt design, as per the photo."
5.0,"Giving 5 stars because I recieved before estimated delivery and great customer service. Recieved an email from seller explaining to contact for any problems.<br />The cover feels nice and good quality! Havent tested it out yet but i will update as soon as i put in good use! Overall, good product!"
5.0,"These are excellent and now I have 3 pairs.  They fit well - I am 5'7"" and 160 lbs and large size is right length.  The fabric is soft and comfy to wear for a good price."
5.0,High quality tighly knit! A great sweater.  Made in China to perfection!
5.0,"This is the perfect size for a cruise, reading glasses, sun glasses, credit cards all safely protected in their own zippered compartment. Plus the leather is really good quality. Great product."

5.0,works for the money cute
5.0,"I am absolutely in love with this dress. The color is absolutely beautiful and the fit is fabulous. I am not a skinny girl, but this was very flattering. I am always concerned about length, but this dress was not terrible. I wore it for a wedding and received many compliments. I would recommend to anyone!!"
5.0,It sturdy and has pockets for everything. Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,"Not an actual sweater vest and I’m not mad about that. The material is very soft and stretchy. The sleeves are capped, flirty ruffles. Great for fall when it is cooler in the mornings and warmer in the afternoons. I love the diamond detailing on the front. Sweater is dressy enough for work or date night. Fairly priced at $22.89 and true to size. For reference, I ordered a small and I am usually a small."
5.0,I used this for my cartilage piercing and I absolutely love it. I haven’t had to worry about it falling out once. Looks super cute and you can’t even feel it
5.0,This leg bag is so convenient! Love it !! I think it’s more convenient then a backpack.
5.0,The top is dressy looking and comfortable.  The lace detail is a plus  Fit as expected
5.0,Fit my 2 year old boy awesome.
5.0,very very pretty! mi likey

5.0,Great price on a good pair of jean shorts.  Fit is perfect.
5.0,"Nicely done, love it"
5.0,"I picked up on a beautiful, well made CCW belt that I like very much!  I will be purchasing another one of a different<br />color soon.  Keep up the great work."
5.0,Son works on his car and loves being able to listen to music and have the light to see what he's doing. Great product
5.0,I received this today and it's absolutely adorable. As far as the quality I will have to wait and see how long it lasts. However it looks fairly solid for just little leather straps.
5.0,I love love these bras. They are colorful and sharp looking. They are very comfortable to. I would totally buy again. I was nervous about buying bras online but I’m so happy I did.
5.0,I always wish the sleeves are longer everything I buy.
5.0,I wish it was longer but it's comfortable.
5.0,Watch arrived ahead of promised delivery date and was everything I expected. It came packaged securely with new watch box and warranty card. I would definitely recommend the seller. The watch looks beautiful but I with hold off on a review until I have worn it for a few months.
5.0,The quality is better than I was expecting. The sturdiness of the ears and tell are great.
5.0,Bought for my granddaughter. Quality is good and they are so cute.
5.0,Fit was perfect and pleasedsi with overall product
5.0,It reminds me of the watches made in the 1970s like carbureted engines a lost treasure took it to a jeweler to have the band adjusted he also recommended to replace the battery for just a little more $  all through it was working fine ! !
5.0,I bought this to use as a decoration for a sun catcher that I made as a gift for Christmas and it turned out really nice. I'll definitely be ordering from this company again.
5.0,"my son goes bowling all the time. handicap league. he would wear this shirt every time if I let him. great colors, great fit."
5.0,"This product works, looks, and fits great. Took a long time for delivery, but worth it."
5.0,"I have bought many of these bags due to working in a prison and clear bags are mandatory. This is the first bag and brand that is heavy duty plastic, has not cracked or torn. Ive been using it for 4 months already and it doesn't even show any scratches. The crossbody attachment comes off if needed. I love this bag the best !!"
5.0,"Awesome. Wife loved them, fit perfect."
5.0,"Very nice pair of gloves, well made.  Glad I found them on here..."
5.0,"Good option for your Garmin Watch, almost the same as the original band."
5.0,"Perfect for summer (driving, gardening), Sun protection!!"
5.0,its tick and has that little tool that helps put it in ny watch 😁
5.0,"Love my new band - the color, the fit, the look!"
5.0,"This dress is amazing. I ordered a large and sized up since everything on Amazon seems to run small. I'm glad I did. It still has a little room.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'7, 140 pounds, long legged and 36b-31-44. I'm hippy and long but this dress still fit perfectly with room to breathe. So don't worry about your butt hanging out of it, it's long enough! But for the shorter, more petite ladies, you may need to take it up a bit depending on the size you order.<br /><br />It is sort of see through in daylight so I wore a slip under just in case but it's not completely sheer."
5.0,"These are not junior sized, these are truer to size! I usually ignore all 5 star ratings because they usually feel paid for lol. I am shocked, happy, and excited. I'm in the habit of ordering SIZES up because most are sized for juniors and not women (or plus sized and won't fit right anyway-armholes five sizes too large exposing bra and hanging off ridiculously with excess material around middle and not flattering at all!). I made that mistake and did order a size up for a couple just to be safe- and those are a little big on me, so order what you would really wear! I'm not bothering to exchange those because unlike typically when too big, the arm holes aren't hanging below bra and exposing me, it's literally the next size up and not a jump into waaaaay too big). It is more extra flowy and still flattering (imo) which is nice for movement will still fit throughout a pregnancy for me so bonus for that! Love the color options as well, Finn too!<br />Like I said have two other shirts from them, those I got the size larger, this one I ordered true size and that it is- it fits perfect. Order size you are and you will be happy! Good quality and a lot of fun! Excited to have FUN shirts that I can wear without feeling like I'm trying to hard to make it fit!!! Thank-you!"
5.0,"Cute earrings, lightweight, and didn’t make my ears itch - win! I don’t like the skull earrings because they look like they belong on a pirate. It doesn’t look like a Halloween earring. Other than that, I am pleased"
5.0,Love the ripstop material. Very lightweight but solidly built. Certainly not &#34;skinny jean&#34; as they are roomy but knew that ahead of time. I did not get these for &#34;tactical&#34; but every day wear and well pleased!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful! And can be warm as an accessory when not wearing a mask. Very soft and breathable not like the heavy cotton ones.
5.0,Wore to a wedding rehearsal dinner. Tons of compliments and very flattering.
5.0,I received a 50mm CZ round gem stone for a design project. It looks perfect. Very high fire sparkle in sunlight and with point light sources. It weighs 155 grams or 775 carats so don't plan using it for common jewelry. The clarity looks perfect and the facets are uniform. Very impressive.
5.0,Really happy with this order! Needed some cute gifts and these are pretty much just like the expensive ones! I got a great color selection also. Will be ordering more! Fit well.
5.0,I wear glasses and live in upstate NY... this hat helps shields my glasses and is warm and comfortable
5.0,Just a little short but super cute
5.0,I like this hat because of the MAC emblem. I just ordered another because I misplaced the first one I ordered. I am sure I’ll find it as soon as I placed this order.<br />I like the selection of caps they have for this era
5.0,Love these! Packaging is nice also! Came with Amazon gift card to share to get a little off i believe.
5.0,"These are super adorable, especially as a gift!! My daughter and I both can wear these & we both love them! They are shiny and catch the eye! The packaging was on point! These came sealed and I am happy I can put them right back in the box when I am done wearing them. I wish I could get every letter. Thank you!"
5.0,"These were much nicer than I even expected.  They are part of a gift package so I haven't used them, but they are well made."
5.0,They are good and long like basketball shorts should be.
5.0,We love the turtles!
5.0,"So cute, soft and perfect! She wants one for Grandmas and one for home!"
5.0,Even if you don’t think you have curves this dress will fit to make you have curves! It honestly fit like a glove which makes it a great dress to party in. I’m 5’5 and 290 pounds and it fit a little snug but I don’t mind.
5.0,"Personally, I wear sports bras all day everyday as I find regular bras annoying and uncomfortable.  I was in need of ""refreshing"" my sports bra collection and went with this style and another style that Rough River has.  I've worn and washed this bra a couple of times.  Comfortable to wear, fits true to size (I'm about 5'4"", 120lbs with a 34-36 B/C chest) and the pads on the front help give me some shape versus ""smashing"" them as the typical sports bra does.  The pads are removable but unlike other sports bras I have they don't fold over or wrinkle in the wash.  I liked the narrow back.<br /><br />I feel these would work best for light to moderate activity.  I wouldn't be wearing this bra on a jog as I would be ""bouncing"" a bit too much to be comfortable.  Other than that, great bra that I'm pleased to have bought and will continue to wear."
5.0,Very pleased with this bag so far.  Great bag for the price if u have a Surface Pro 3.
5.0,just a reminder... the Vettes are on the BACK of the shirt.<br />there is a nice C7 wing logo with the lettering in White saying Corvette underneath the wing logo.<br />it is located on your left upper chest area.
5.0,Bought it for church Sundays. Got the black one with polka dots. It's one of my favorite dresses. 💃
5.0,Bought this as a Christmas gift so I don't have any pics of it together but have bought several of these in the past and love them. They are challenging and require patience but they are not TOO challenging.
5.0,These glasses are great for my job and the price is right!
5.0,Very cute what you expect from Oshkosh
5.0,Really cute top. Love it and would recommend it.
5.0,"Cute pin, a little larger than expected"
5.0,"If you are looking for a pair of inexpensive goggles, these are very nice and comfortable and a good deal for the price."
5.0,Watch band was a little dirty
5.0,Girlfiend initially did not like to round logo but now is in love with it. She is glad she didnt have me return it.
5.0,After extensive research I decided on this hiking pack.  I like the zippered water bottle pouch on the side that makes it more sleek.  I read other reviews that stated the water bottle pouch did not fit a water bottle so I gave it a try and found that it does fit a 16.9 fl oz plastic bottle no problem. I also like all of the pockets inside and out. It stores all of the items I need when I am out and about.
5.0,Excellent buy.  Very beautiful and a comfortable fit.  You just have to be very careful with the zirconia in the middle as my bracelet fell and I lost a stone.
5.0,"This was a gift. They are very large ,so that men's show will fit nicely inside. They are a nice silky material and you can keep anything inside. They are good for packing his shoes,in the luggage ,also."
5.0,"Adorable and super fun to wear for the summer. It is a bit heavy on the top frame. Still, love wearing these and the price is right!"
5.0,Good product no riding down
5.0,"I love these socks.  They stay up and never get eaten by the shoes.  Comfortable, cool, and look great too!"
5.0,These turned out perfect much better than expected will order again.
5.0,"Perfect for costume.  Easy to fit on different sized heads, excellently constructed, quality fabric.  Although I am happy with color that was randomly sent, would prefer to select it myself."
5.0,"I love this band.  I bought the black lace design and it looks great!  The silicone is nice and soft..  I want to buy a couple more now.  Highly recommend this,  adds a nice feminine touch to the watch."
5.0,I bought this for my 8 year old grandson and very very large on him and he’s a tall big boy.<br />No complaints about the product!
5.0,I highly recommend these clip-on sunglasses.  They are perfect!  They fit great!  They are just what I needed.  I believe this is my second pair having purchased another pair of these a year or two ago.  You always misplace your sunglasses so I wanted to make sure I had a pair for my car and one for my purse.  I love these.
5.0,"Dainty and sweet, for every girl who ever wished on one."
5.0,"This dress is awesome. I got it for my wife and she looks incredible. The material is pretty thin, but she says it's very comfortable."
5.0,[[ASIN:B006OHTHZC Stainless Steel Eternity Simulated Cz Wedding Band Ring 3mm Sz 3-10; Comes With FREE Gift Box (6)]] Very pretty -wore for 6-8months before it became discolored
5.0,Bought this for my mom for mothers day and she loved it. Super cute and looks great
5.0,I have worn through many pairs.  I don't love shoes.  I wear slipper socks all winter except when I'm outdoors.
5.0,Great product. Exactly what I wanted and needed. Couldn’t have gotten anything better for the price.
5.0,Good blouse with jeans. Made pretty well.
5.0,Very flattering dress. The material is very silky and soft. Absolutely love this dress
5.0,I wore this to my bachelorette party and I loved it! Fit my body perfectly.
5.0,"I love these pj’s! And I’m lucky I get to wear them to work (from home)! Long enough, loose enough and super soft. They aren’t the warmest pj’s but in TX, they will work just fine. I’m between a M & a L and went with the L (5’7”, 155-160) because I prefer loose over fitted."
5.0,Fits perfect size 31/32 and medium fits great.
5.0,"I purchased these earrings in rose gold tone. They arrived very nicely boxed and protected in the box as well. There are two types of earring backs included: 1 pair of barrel backs and 1 pair of standard butterfly backs. Both back types fit on the earring posts snugly so no chance of a back sliding off and losing an earring. The earrings themselves are quite lightweight. I have a lot of trouble with ear soreness from earrings with much weight and my ears are very sensitive to cheap metals and plated colors, but I can wear these all day and don’t even feel them! (Thanks to the stainless steel) They are very pretty and dressy with the cubic zirconia stones, but they also look nice with a nice top and a pair of your favorite jeans too. I would love to see them come in silver stainless steel too!"
5.0,I'm glad I was able to give it to someone
5.0,"I enjoy riding my bike but my back side gets mighty sore from sitting on the bike seat. I have padded bike shorts but in the summer they get hot and it limits me to what I can wear. This gel seat cover fits and has helped ease the pain of riding my bike. The gel part is about ¾ inches thick, soft and bounces back after sitting on it. The seams are well sewn and has a tie closure. [[ASIN:B01LXZV4ZS HuwaiH Bike Seat Cushion Cover [10.6&#34;x7.5&#34;] Comfortable Gel Bicycle Seat - Memory Foam Pad Bicycle Saddle Cover For Bikes]]"
5.0,"This is a thin cotton feeling scarf but the colors are very vibrant.  I wore it the other day tied as a vest over a deep blue shirt and skinny khaki's with boots.  It was beautiful!!  Accidently ordered 2 but no worries -- I will gift the 2nd one.  Great seller, fast shipping."
5.0,I bought it for my husband<br />To hold his huge iPhone and wallet and stuff<br />I think its great.
5.0,Super warm super stylish
5.0,"I have double d's so the fit in my chest area is a little tight. However this isn't an issue really, given that the fabric is good quality and it stretches. I'm 5'5"" and the length was perfect for me, a little lower than my ankle but just above the soles of my feet, it doesn't touch the floor. I ordered a Large."
5.0,My niece is obsessed with Pete the Cat and flipped out when she saw these to go with her red converse (I love my red shoes!!). She wears them all the time! They are soft and fit great! Great buy!!
5.0,"These are wire frames which I prefer as they are not likely to break. Mine have not broken. I also like that if they do not fit quite right the frames can be bent to adjust. Plastic frames can not and often break at the hinge, These do not. Great price also!"
5.0,Great quality. Exactly what I was looking for. Now my fiancé sits at my heart always.
5.0,"The case is so pretty, and it was here in two days!"
5.0,"I bought this as a beach cover-up and I’m thrilled with it. All seams are sewed nicely and the navy floral fabric is soft very flowy. It will work perfectly for an upcoming vacation. I’m also packing a white tank (it is see through) and khaki shorts to wear under this on a day out. I oacklight and am always looking for items that can be used mulyways. Overall, I’m very pleased with this purchase and shared the item link with friends."
5.0,"I've been trying really hard to get my find a new ring  for his wedding ring finger, and it's been so hard to find him the right ring because my husband manages to destroy them with his heavy hands lol. He has managed to have lost and broken 4 rings in 5 years lol yes you heard me right 5 years. So I heard that tungsten ring are the best rings and that they are very durable, well I here is the thing I saw this one on AMZ Review Trader and I had to get it, hey why now give this ring a show. So I ordered it and I didn't think of my husband's weight loss in consideration so I ordered his old size, the ring came in perfect time and I opened it and surprised my husband with this gorgeous ring. Omg it's absolutely gorgeous. So here is the problem lol I got a huge size lol yeah it didn't fit his ring finger but it fits in his pointing finger, he loves it so much, he doesn't care if it's to big, so that means I'm gonna have to buy another one but a couple size smaller. The ring is very sturdy and very well made, I love how smooth this ring is, this has no flaws. He is so happy with his surprise. I really highly recommend this ring to any one and I already recommended this ring to my sister and sister in law. I am crossing my fingers that this ring will last and that he won't lose it or break it. I am very happy with this ring. Plus I love that it came with a very cute protective drawstring baggie.<br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"This product runs small,  normally wear a medium but sized up to an xl. I’m glad that I read the reviews before ordering."
5.0,"These are awesome joggers. Moderately thick material, and fits true to size. I bought one pair originally and have since gone back and bought 2 other colors. So comfortable and I'm honestly really impressed with the quality."
5.0,I love this shirt. I've gotten so many compliments on it. It is soft and comfy.
5.0,It’s perfect! Exactly what I was looking for in a lacey cardigan!!!
5.0,These aviator wings are as real as the ones I received in flight school.  A+++ rating.
5.0,The run a little big but very light weight Soft texture and very comfortable Flowy as well They will go good for dressy or casual wear
5.0,"This jacket sweatshirt not only looks JUST like the one in the anime, My Hero Academia, but you can wear it at not just convention, you can wear it anywhere."
5.0,"I was looking for a replacement of my actual wedding ring and I came across this one... at first I bought ot because of the picture... then I decided to buy based on the reviews... I am a very pivky person and by far, this is the best man made ring work ever..... all I have gotten is compliments on this ring and nobody believe they are not diamonds.....<br />Perfect for what I was looking... I havr to say ring is kinda thick, so might take you a day to get use to it in your hands.... but very lightweight.. wich is great..."
5.0,"I am 5'6"" 165lbs and ordered a large. Definitely could have sized down to a medium and they would still be the loose, comfy fit."

5.0,Cute and offers compression.
5.0,Love love love tres chic
5.0,Nice!  I love this material.
5.0,"These were a HIT! For grownups they are slightly small but wearable. The kids loved them, none of the pieces fell off, and only one ended up breaking."
5.0,These are BOMB!! I love that they came with a case and cleaning cloth for the price. I cannot wait to rock these this wknd!!
5.0,"I brought this for my daughter and this is her review. The band is very attractive, it also is very smooth which feels nice around the skin, and it is very cheap for good quality mot bands are 5-6 dollars where this is only 2 dollars. It is a big band but I'm 11 and my wrist is very skinny so it still fits. Over All I loved this product recommend buying it 5 stars."
5.0,"Perfect size for the essentials....phone, lipstick and glasses"
5.0,For a gift to a person who's hooked on &#34;DIA DE LOS MUERTOS&#34; stuff! Looks to fit the bill.
5.0,It's a key ring. They all work the same.
5.0,Sizing is nice my little one looked so cute! He’s 1 1/2 but fits 3T in nearly everything as he is a big baby
5.0,Purchased for my Office Manager's 10 year work anniversary.  She loves it.
5.0,"Bought these to wear at the gym.  I don't keep things in my pocket there, but the side pockets are great to keep a phone that doesn't get in the way.  Functional enough that I wear them out and around (thats how i know about the phone, as well as wallet and keys)"
5.0,These earrings are light weight and looks beautiful
5.0,Love these headbands! Not too tight
5.0,Perfect size wallet with identity safe accordion center section for credit cards.  Great size that can be used with a purse or on its own.  Love that my phone fits securely in the outside snap compartment. Zip section for money.  Purple metallic is fun color without being gaudy.  All round zip holds everything securely.  Appears to be well made and durable.  Love it!
5.0,Vacation good
5.0,"Love this! Shipping was a little long, but I assumed so as it is not Prime eligible. It is super cute on. Only bad thing is it smells a little musty, as other comments state, but if you air it out and spray it with perfume it is fine!"
5.0,It’s adorable and the chain is so nice
5.0,Fits great. Looks great! Not see through. Some of their other pants are see through. These weren't. Guessing it is the extra material for &#34;tummy control&#34;?
5.0,Wearing it for my western outfit for our Hospice Fashion Show.  Really cute.
5.0,works great on my deck just ouside my patio door.
5.0,"Good quality, fit as advertised. I'm a size 16 and it was perfect - lots of stretch."
5.0,"I love this wallet. It fits all credit cards, plus I still have room and it closes easily."
5.0,Very comfortable fit and look beautiful on my face
5.0,"First of all, this is not an ""unstructured""style cap with the squishy deflated looking front crown. The unstructured style sits very flat against the head, and for guys with round shaped faces like me, they seem to add ten pounds to the face. I was very glad to find that this hat has a nice structured crown, and a nice medium height to that crown as well.<br />*I've included pictures of a grey unstructured hat next to this one for comparison, along with close up pictures of the hat in general.<br /> Overall, it's a very nice quality hat, with the embroidered C5 Corvette logo well proportioned and centered on the front of the crown. The red accent ""sandwiched"" in the bill is a nice touch!<br /> The adjustment buckle is a muted bronze-like color, and holds fast.<br />Another nice feature is the naturally curved bill!  It arrived from the manufacturer in a nice symmetrical curve (the flat brim look is just not my style), so no rubber bands and baseballs were needed to coax a flat bill into curved submission.<br />Not made in America, BUT- it's not made in China, either! Bangladesh is the base of operations for the manufacturer, and I think they have done a fine job creating a hat worth wearing!  I appreciate the quality and the price point, and look forward to making this a regular part of my casual wardrobe"
5.0,"This has to be the best buy that I ever purchased on Amazon. The quality of the fabric is light and airy, and the slit going down the top is deep and revealing (just how I wanted it!). It was very comfortable and fit like a dream. I did wear it out to a dinner that I did not want the twins hanging out quite so much so I pinned it about an inch. It was perfect! I got many complements and cannot wait to order it in more colors.<br /><br />The only note I would like to make is if you are in between sizes to order the smaller size. I had been burned so many times on Amazon when ordering my size and having the item show up waaaaaay to small. I ordered a Large instead of a medium and plan to order the dress again in the medium. You can't beat the price for this quality. I am 180 pounds (but athletic) with a 36DD chest."
5.0,"I bought this skort for golf and it fits great,moves with you and flares on the upswing. It’s really cute and my husband adores it on me. I like it so well I’m wearing it everywhere now!"
5.0,ITS GORGEOUS AND FITS PERFECT! I AM 5'11 245lb and got a XXL (16).. super comfortable I have 3 now...
5.0,This is the second one I purchased I love this watch and and the price
5.0,People have commented on how beautiful this cap is. I picked this cap because this lion looks more gentle. I'll wear the more aggressive lion cap when i'm in a bad mood. This cap is perfect for a lion fan. I highly recommend.
5.0,"I really like this band, took out a few lengths, easy to do.  It have some wiggle room so my Apple Watch moves a bit but at least my hand doesn’t fall asleep!  Goes well with any occasion. Seems more feminine than masculine"
5.0,Can't beat this dwal.
5.0,"Fit,well, stayed on.  Well made for the price"
5.0,I really love this necklace and when I wear it I get complimented on how pretty it is.
5.0,"So much fun, I was scared I might get a hole in the bottom because it’s long, but definitely worth it"
5.0,"I liked them!!!<br />They are working on the road and sidewalk by our place, and I walk to work... it was muddy outside dur to the heavy rain full we just had that day...<br />I put them on tucked my pantlegs in them and off I went... they did not slip at all while I was walking through the mud, easy to get off and clean too!"
5.0,I ordered the wrong size but it was easy to return for the right size. You have to leave a message but when they return your call there very nice. Nicest belt I have ever bought.
5.0,Had a minor issue with my original order but the seller was good at fixing that I love this product it's works great with my kids shoes and mine as well.
5.0,"I purchased this set to wear with my homecoming dress and cannot believe the steal I got! The rhinestones sparkled miraculously no matter the angle, which caused me to receive compliments all night. The only cons I can see with this product is that the actual black &#34;stones&#34; in the set are obviously plastic pieces (though no one but me seemed to notice) and the clasp in the back is not directly behind the main teardrop, which places it at a weird angle. Overall, I would completely recommend, you are not going to find another jewelry set with this amount of glam for this price!"
5.0,So shiny. So so pretty. Came quickly!
5.0,"In a world where skinny jeans are popular again and postpartum bodies struggle, these Spanx are my new favorite and I ended up buying a second pair in black! They are SUPER comfortable, cover that middle section that hasn't been worked away, and they have back pockets! Don't get confused with the sizing - I looked on the Spanx website to make sure the sizing was right. I wear size 12 pants and got the 'L27' and they fit fine. They look cute with booties, flats, sneakers, you name it. Definitely worth the money."
5.0,"Love the detailed buttons, material is super soft & color was just as pictured. The fit is expected bought a medium which I usually wear , nice and flowy to hide left over baby belly. All around a great shirt, will purchase more colors."

5.0,Purchased to use as a stadium purse and I actually get a lot of compliments on this bag!
5.0,Great little table. Good workmanship for price and I would buy again
5.0,"We obtained these glasses for my daughters sweet 16 party. She used them as favors for a night of dancing at her party. The teens and adults loved them, they were a hit. Affordable and great product."
5.0,Also beautiful earrings !!! Great job Amazon!
5.0,"After reading some reviews I was a bit apprehensive about how these would fit, but they fit fine on my earlobes, including upside down.<br />I was cautious about pulling out the backing so that it wouldn't break. I probably wouldn't put the backing on. I could see how they can break with pulling on them repeated because of the angle of them.<br /><br />Really pretty and happy with the different ways I can wear them."
5.0,"I've been looking for light weight driving glasses for awhile.  Because I'm always losing my sunglasses I was looking for something that was reasonably priced with good protection.<br /><br />The fitfirst polarized glasses were exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />They are super light weight,  aviator style which is flattering on most face shapes even my small face.<br /><br />What i really like is the glare protection.  I experience a lot of glare when driving.  These glasses have made this no longer a problem for me.  I wish I could wear them at night to stop headlight glare.<br /><br />Another important attribute of the glasses is the scratch protection. These are my driving glasses and although they come with a case I'm often in a hurry and just toss the glasses in the glove box. Unlike other pairs I've owed, these glasses are holding up well.<br /><br />The glasses are polarized what,  I wanted for its sharp clarity and excellent protection.  The lenses are a medium tint,  not too light and not so dark that that i can't use them while driving when it's overcast.<br /><br />Overall,  I'm pleased with glasses and because they were so reasonable,  I purchased a second pair to put in my husband's car so I always have shades when needed."
5.0,"When I recieved it, one of the stones were displaced but it was in the packaging so I just crazy glued it back on. It looks nice but i havent worn it out yet."
5.0,Very comfortable and great for my tai chi class.
5.0,"I got a green size 8 of this AVOD to replace a pink Apple band that has sustained some damage. This one fit perfectly, replacing the same size."
5.0,Recipient wears this daily. Again...Great value for the money.
5.0,The hoodie is very thick and comfortable. Couldn't beat the price. We bought these to be part of a costume for Halloween but they ended up being a very nice quality for the price. Definitely a great hoodie to Lounge in or working.

5.0,PLEASE BRING IT BACK.... GREAT FIND!!!! NEED MORE!!!!
5.0,Me gusto es como lo queria
5.0,"What a lovely, silky feel without the care that must go into silk!  This will go beautifully with light blue skirts and tees.  It's just beautiful and drapes perfectly.  It fit exactly as expected, and feels great for a hot day when you still want that layered look, but not the heat that goes with it.  It's a royal blue that is a gorgeous color.  I'm looking forward to wearing it - I just got it yesterday - so I haven't had a chance to wear it yet, but when I tried it on, it fit and draped beautifully!  This vest would also make a lovely gift for someone special, that's how nice it is."
5.0,I was hoping the fit of the trousers would be like the fit of the jeans. It is!
5.0,I wish the big handbag wasn't quite as long but other than that I really love it and as for the little one I really really love it
5.0,Very Comfortable & Soft!
5.0,Sparkly and somewhat see thru. Nice for costume!
5.0,Beautiful gift for wife
5.0,I like that Colors are really bright.<br />Cloth material is really great.<br />Washed couple of times and print doesn't fade.<br />True to the size.<br />Baby feels comfortable.
5.0,"Gorgeous earrings! Nice quality, good size, shiny finish. The wires are much thicker than expected, but are not uncomfortable. My one complaint was that one earring had a sharp spur on the end of the post. I had to use a metal file to remove it before I could wear them; had I not, it would have hurt or injured my ear. Other than that... definitely recommend."
5.0,"I'm a bigger guy (6ft, 270lbs), and the XXL fit just fine."
5.0,"This is like T-shirt material in a hoodie. So it’s not a hoodie that’s going to keep you warm, but I really like it! It fits nicely. The black strings are thick & nice quality."
5.0,I love the way it feels on my arm without that wet feel behind it
5.0,Fast Shipping After using a few times I  Wish it stayed on by having tighter material. Maybe after I wash it and dry it it will retain its first two times on.<br />I will try that and if it works I will order more.<br />Thank you<br />Dee
5.0,I got this for my son as he likes long sleeve shirts but he isn't a fan of being hot.<br /><br />This shirt is great for that. It's breathable and light weight. It seems to be well made and my son likes it which is all that counts with me.<br /><br />I received a discount for my honest review.
5.0,Nice Happy 😊 & Satisfied
5.0,It's exactly what you see in the photos.
5.0,Nice and thin for comfort. I use it for work at the hospital. The strap eventually breaks. This is my 3rd one in 4 1/2 years.
5.0,"At first I thought that they'd shipped the wrong thermals - the ones I received were superior to others I've bought for more than twice the price.  Nice heavy dark gray heather cotton.  Sleeves are perfect in length and work well for my husband who must be part gibbon monkey on his mother's side of the family.  Having a hard time getting him  to take them off long enough for them to be laundered (yes, it's starting to get punky!) since he doesn't want to switch back to his old thermals and we've had a cold snap where thermals make the difference between hating your existence and loving the life you live.  Already bought a second set to solve the laundry issue.  Once my son sees these I'm sure I'll be buying a third set, and maybe even a fourth if he is as reluctant as his Dad to take them off."
5.0,"Ladies, it took three tries but I got it right And it was well worth the wait in the end. It seems that manufacturers assume that if you are a larger size naturally you'll have larger boobs. This is not true for me (I'm a 36b). It can make shopping for things like corsets and bathing suits a bit difficult sometimes. (On a completely unrelated side note, manufacturers also seem to think that if you're a larger size somehow your legs are extra long as well, also not true.) I followed the size chart and ordered a 4XL. When it arrived it was too big. But not by very much. I went back to order a smaller size, but they were out of the 3XL. So I chose to order what I thought was the same corset from a different seller. When it arrived it was ill-fitting, and even though it looked the same, the cut was a little bit different and the cups were definitely different. So, disappointed, I went back to the original seller to check and see if they had my size. They did. So I immediately ordered one. It arrived two days early, and it fits beautifully. It is comfortable, believe it or not, and I had to do zero adjusting to make it work. I really have nowhere to wear this at the moment I just thought it was beautiful so I bought it. I wanted to have it in my wardrobe just in case. Because I will find a place to wear it. In the meantime, I'm going to wear it to the grocery store today. So if you are shopping at Whole Foods in downtown Houston and you see a gal with a big grin on her face, wearing a corset, and doing her shopping, you will know why. I am seriously in love with this piece. The colors, the cut, everything. Well, everything except that odd triangle that they're trying to pass off as a g-string. That went immediately into the trash."
5.0,Beautiful graphics
5.0,Nice Quality - Love it.
5.0,Love this!  Soft and perfect to keep at work for those cold office days!

5.0,It was an out of state gift. Says its great
5.0,I love my “African Earrings” ! I get loads of compliments every time I wear them!
5.0,"These socks are nice and colorful, though maybe a little smaller than I expected. They are not particularly thick, but it’s not super thin either. I’d say that spring and fall would be ideal times to wear these, like around 50 to 75 degrees F. I haven’t had them long enough to be able to tell how well they will wear, but they look and feel as though they will be somewhat durable."
5.0,Loved this product! This bodysuit is very comfortable and gives a nice compression on the tummy. I would definitely order again.
5.0,"Great fit, true to size, very nice. Will purchase again."
5.0,"Great price for quality. Cut at crotch is however very generous, made me think of somewhat baggy trousers from the 80s :)<br />But then again it's not as ... crushing as somebody of those &#34;well fitting&#34; pants. Would however nonetheless preferred a slightly more tailored look. Still 5 Star worthy."
5.0,The material is quality and fits well.
5.0,"Very pretty colored purple. Fits so nice and flattering. I'm 5'2"" and it's a tad bit long but is lovely. Glad I bought it. I'm 160lbs and ordered extra large. Could have gone down a size. Very pretty shirt"
5.0,"I like the pockets, size and room.  It hangs nicely and allows access to all my toiletries!"
5.0,very nice and elegant.
5.0,"My son loves it, unfortunately his idol is now a Laker."
5.0,I am very satisfied with these shades!
5.0,I wore these in the snow for 2 hours and stayed warm and dry the whole time.  I see what people mean about the stiff back along the leg.  It has already started to break in but it rubbed me raw through athletic socks.  Hindsight shows that I should have worn them around the garden a few times before wearing them snow tubing.<br />Overall I loved them and they are super cute!
5.0,Worth the price 👍
5.0,"Got this for a 9 yr. old boy,. He loved it."
5.0,These are  great earrings.  They ate the same front as the ones my daughter got her ears pierced with but a different back.
5.0,It is a perfect fit. Very beautiful. A little bigger than I expected. But over all very nice.
5.0,"I actually bought a pair from my chiropractor years ago and he no longer sells them.  Have had them for about 4 years now, and looking to replace them.  Happy to see them  hear.  Hope they work the same.  :)"
5.0,Love them. Work great. Really helped on this last trip
5.0,"This top is awesome! I ordered it s little too large, but will definitely order more!"
5.0,Durable tags-good purchase
5.0,I thought it would help me after I had one of my great toes fused. I still can’t wear them it’s too soon but I love them and can not wait to wear them. Down her a most Thanksgiving is short sleeves shot or capris so I have plenty of time to wear them.  They have a great soul to support your foot.
5.0,It is lovely. It has a nice drape and is a bit longer than some other brands. I would buy more colors. I hand wash it and air dry.
5.0,"i got 2 packages of these to wear for my daily yoga classes to avoid catching foot fungus or other related bacterium from performing my yoga barefoot and i am very happy with them because of the price especially.  i paid around $12 but now i see them on sale for $8.99 so i'm a little bummed, however, even at $12 that's only $3 per pair, so still pretty good.  at the sale price of $8.99 i would've bought 4 packs!!<br /><br />now, a few things you should know:  it is best to do yoga barefoot on your own mat, but if you need to step off to the floor for balancing poses then i slip the socks on.  they hold firm for me.  i've only been doing yoga for 5 months and for a few months i was doing it barefoot using the gym's mat and then stepping out on the floor for the few balancing poses.  soon i noticed the bottom of my feet were becoming filthy and a little ""peely"" like perhaps a mild athelete's foot fungus.  so i knew i needed yoga socks.  i see others walking on the filthy gym floor in bare feet and i cringe to know what film of filth, bacteria, parasites are in the film on the floor UNSEEN but nevertheless THERE!!<br /><br />i would not get the yoga socks with the individual toes because i like to be able to slip my socks off in a jiff for the balancing poses and put them back on when the class if over and when it is cold.  to slip them off is ultra easy, just brush your foot backwards against your mat an inch and they pull off by themselves and push them to the side with your foot.  i chose these socks because they were fully closed, the socks with the individual toes seemed to have a lot of bad reviews about the toes coming out.  for me, just putting them on and taking them off in a jiff would be an impossibility.<br /><br />however, i would NOT wear these socks to perform the entire class in (downward dog, plank and other mat poses) because the socks move around a bit and i found myself having to adjust them straight to get the rubberized portion tracking.  so barefoot on your OWN MAT, then just wear the socks for the portion you must step to the floor for.  now my feet are sparkling clean when i arrive to yoga AND when i leave too!  i really don't like to have to scrub my feet in the middle of the day.  i am not a person who goes barefoot and i don't like any dirt on my feet, so for me the yoga socks were a must.  another reason NOT TO WEAR THESE SOCKS ON YOUR MAT IS THE RUBBERIZED PADS RUB OFF QUICKLY from the multiple continual poses and rubbing against the mat. but for just the few balancing poses on the floor, they are ideal!<br /><br />i also bought these shoes here on Amazon to wear over my yoga socks to arrive and leave the gym in: Skechers Women's Go Walk 2 Super Breathe Walking Shoe  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HSHH2FO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />they run 1/2 size big, so whatever size you normally wear, GET THE 1/2 size down of what you normally wear.<br />the 4 different colors of socks make it nice and with these mesh skecher shoes the color of the socks shoe through, really nice.<br /><br />slip on shoes make it easy to arrive to the gym and get ready on your mat quickly, especially those days when you arrive a little late to class.<br /><br />SIZE:  i am a TRUE 6.5"" size shoe, these socks fit me well with lots of wiggle room.  they will fit a person with a size 7 shoe and an 8.  i am not sure of a size 9.  they might feel a little big for those who wear a size 5 or smaller.  i would say they are PERFECT for a person who is a size 7 or 7.5.  but definitely good for a 6.5"" size shoe person.<br /><br />WASHING:  wash in warm water, but dry in the sun inside out. or hang dry.  i have never put them in a dryer but would imagine the life of the rubberized pads would be cut short if i did.<br /><br />and for $8.99 for 4 pairs of socks (around $2 each) this is a fantastic deal.  even the $3 per pair that i paid at $12 for a pack i think is ok, but for $8.99 i would buy 4 or 5 packs.<br /><br />Very Happy, Good Price, Great for floor poses, not recommend using them for mat work, but not needed if you have your own mat!"
5.0,Great fit and color. I had previously purchased the white version of this top. It is comfortable with a good stretch and is not thin at all. I am already thinking about buying a third shirt for the warm months.

5.0,I love this dress. It is so comfortable and very cute on. I am 5'9 and 180 and the xlarge fits perfect.
5.0,"I recently had cataract surgery and all I had need for was a pair of bifocals.  My surgeon recommended this type of glasses.  I received them yesterday and they are perfect for me.  I have a smaller face and head, so these might not work if you have a larger head.  They are very stylish too."

The necklace came in just two days and is absolutely beautiful. I did take off the little &#34;wish&#34; charm because I liked the necklace better without it. It is easy to wear and beautiful in construction."
5.0,Used to fix Carheat Bib Overhauls.  Exact fit and already used several times due to cold weather

5.0,Love it. Fits well and looks great

5.0,"Material is very soft and comfortable. The belt adds a lot to the robe, really cute.  I have it for a while now and I am very satisfied with it."
5.0,"Received my leather keychain today and I am fairly impressed with it. The HK style hook is solid and fairly sturdy. The leather itself looks like it's top grain leather in a coffee brown color. The cuts in the leather are a little crooked but to be honest it doesn't bother me at all. I think it adds to its charm. The stitching is fairly decent and it looks like they glued the ends to close the stitching. Time will tell how long the glue lasts.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased with the item. It's imperfections, in my opinion, give it character. If you're looking for a leather keychain with an HK style hook, which for some reason is impossible to find on Amazon, then this is the one for you."
5.0,"This polishing cloth worked great on a vintage show horse halter that has mixed metal accents of Silver bands with copper and brass accents.  I could not find any polish that was safe to use on all three metals, so this product saved the day."

5.0,I can think of few better ways to publicly laud your Satanism than flashing an inverted pentagram every time you go to pay. |m|
5.0,I was looking for something very light that I could wear under my short sleeves and living in Texas in the summer this was perfect. The only problem/flaw was how it fit but once I got use to it it was no problem.

5.0,"Fashion, breathable, and good price for the value!"
5.0,"I am so impressed with the chain that this Pendant came with, it's very sturdy and the clasp is a larger one that is easy to handle. The Pendant is a brilliant beautiful red. The heart Crystal is the perfect size.  The stones around the heart are nice and tightly set, no worries of losing them or getting them caught in anything. Definitely a great gift for the love of your life. I received this sample product for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Looks rich feels rich but at a very very good price!!!

5.0,"90 Degree has the best fitting yoga pants I've ever worn. I bought these capri style patterned ones for yoga class. They fit well and look great and are very comfortable as I go through the yoga moves.. I pair them with a Champion shirt I bought here on Amazon. I've tried other yoga pants but so far these are the best fitting. They wash well (they recommend no fabric softener), and dry fast. I love the thick waistband.I highly recommend them."
5.0,"These are great.  Durable and if you break them, easily replaced.  This is my second one in 10 years."
5.0,"My 11 year old son loves these shoes! He likes the look and he enjoys the lightweight. He thinks he is performing better in gym class, lol!"

5.0,"We love the Netfix show Bloodline and when we went to the Florida Keys this summer, we visited many of the locations in the show. When we stopped by the Caribbean Club in Key Largo, we saw a man wearing a Rayburn for Sheriff shirt. We went online and found this shirt and without hesitation bought two of them. They are made of comfortable cotton and after washing retained its original size. I would recommend this shirt to any Bloodline fan."
5.0,Cool hat good quality
5.0,"They took awhile to get to me, but omg they are so worth it!! I absolutely love each and every one of them. I get compliments all of the time! :)"

5.0,"This style runs bigger than the other styles form Colorfulkoala. If you are between sizes DEFINITELY size down. I have other colorfulkoala leggings that are a small, normally I am between an extra small and a small, so for these, I ordered a small. They are a tad too big, but I’m making them work."

5.0,Wonderful! Cute as can be.

5.0,Comfortable and sometimes it just feels good to go to a non-grippy (is that a word?) footbed sometimes.
5.0,"Good quality, soft material, bright colors, very cute!"
5.0,pretty handy belt. my left hand has nerve damage from too much fun on a motorcycle so I am down to slip on and zip up shoes/boots and this type of belt.

5.0,"I liked it very much,so beautiful earrings."

5.0,fast shipping looks great fits great thanks again!!
5.0,Love the coloring on this shirt and the material looks good. If your looking for a thick sweat shirt this isn’t for you. But if you want a light but comfortable material to just keep the chill off while Trick or Treating with the kids which I will be doing with this on it will be great.<br />I am 5”4 175<br />And bought a large fits perfect with some room. If you want more room I suggest going up a size. I would suggest washing in cool water and hang drying if you don’t want to shrink it.<br />I really like the product and am very happy with it.
5.0,Loved this💕💕greatfor costume jewelry or gift
5.0,"I love these earrings, I saw on tik tok and had to purchase them, great quality I highly recommend"
5.0,Absolutely love it! Wish I had got like a half size bigger.
5.0,"This is the most comfortable thing I own and sad it's summer because now I have to tuck it away until Fall, I get many complements on it as well."
5.0,Very nice and comfortable 5the quality is soo good :)
5.0,Comfortable and looks good too.
5.0,Very well made and work exactly as advertised. I'm excited to give them a workout.
5.0,I love this brand.  Everything is adorable and great quality.  Must get!!
5.0,Liked this way more than I thought I would honestly. Material is really soft and has some stretch to it (5’4 about 150 and a medium is PERFECT) had adjustable straps too. Not too thin but not the thickest material either. I’m smaller on top and def don’t need a bra with it (not see through)
5.0,"OMG!! It’s so beautiful and well made. Looks expensive, I can’t believe that’s the price for this beautiful piece of jewelry."
5.0,This calculator watch is exactly what I wanted.
5.0,I absolutely love the quality of this bra!!! I would suggest to order a size up though.
5.0,I want to order more! These are some comfortable and fit amazing!
5.0,I absolutely love this black dress. I coupled it with a pink cardigan and got so many compliments. The dress is very comfortable and stylish.
5.0,I am beyond happy for this dress! I was a little skeptical at first and thought the dress would fit too short on me but I was pleasantly surprised! I'm 5'11ft tall and the dress was longer than arms length. The material is a little thin but that's nothing to worry about. The busy area was a little big on me but it wasn't very noticeable due to the halter tie in the back and the off shoulder feature. I'm very happy about the purchase and can't wait to wear it in Cancun in a few weeks!
5.0,My husband absolutely loved it. Pretty small did come in the box.
5.0,"Great fitting pair of running shorts. I bought these and immediately ran a race in them the next day, fit great with no chafing or rubbing issues."
5.0,Love this style of bracelet
5.0,"Wore these on a hike with vertical inclines/ rocky terrain for the first time and was kind of shocked how much I slipped around in the shoe. Would definitely recommend half sizing down (I regularly wear 9s, should've purchased 8.5s) or pairing these with chunky socks or supports otherwise. Really cute looking boots though, even after the hike and tick repellant spray they look brand new. Would recommend!"
5.0,Must have at this price awesome fit and material
5.0,"I love these earrings! Enough pinch to hold the earrings onto my ears without making my ears hurt. I have pressure sensitive ears, to the point where I can't wear clip-on earrings for more than a few minutes (my ears turn bright red and start throbbing). These have already become my new go-to daily earrings!"
5.0,Size 14 fits per measurements! I am postpartum with twins measuring a 5’5; 38 33.4 48 195lbs and flows at just the right spot!
5.0,"Awesome quality shirt. Looks good on, well made and fits true to size."
5.0,More than enough for a watch band.
5.0,"I ordered this for my mother and she likes it very much. The length is good, long enough to keep her legs warm but not so long it hits the floor, and she says it feels good, nice and warm and soft. I am very pleased."
5.0,"Loved it!! Looked great and was comfy! The only problem was the bra pads folded easily....which was annoying but, because of the print...it wasn’t really noticeable:)"
5.0,I bought this for my wife. She has been miserable for 20 years because nothing she slept in was cool enough. This product was the answer to her prayers. I can't thank you enough!

5.0,My favorite earrings right now. I have the feather set and I just ordered the triangle. I get so many complements. They don't fall out
5.0,"[[ASIN:B01GPGSI8I JOVIVI Vintage Antique Bronze Tree of Life 7 Chakra Stones Round Charm Healing Power Pendant Necklace]] This is a very pretty, eye-catching piece. It is well put together and the colors of the stone groups are well matched. It is larger than I anticipated, about 2 inches across. I wear it with little other jewelry - it demands to be the focal point! The necklace comes in a velveteen drawstring bag suitable for gifting. You will need to put the pendant on the enclosed cord (which is choker length, but the loop is large enough that you can use a longer chain if you want). I notice other reviewers also received a chain with the pendant, but some only received a cord like me. Someone needs to take a second look before shipping, I think. Still, I love the look of this pendant and am glad I bought it.<br /><br />I disclose that I received a discout on this item for review. I am not affiliated with the seller."
5.0,I loved it it looks cute

5.0,This is a beautiful scarf that is soft and warm without being bulky. The colors are rich and it looks great. I may purchase another color.
5.0,"This was a bit too big on me. I planned to use it as a thumb ring, but wasn't aware that men sizes and women sizes are slightly different, oops! It shines nicely and is comfortable to wear. I haven't had any issues with scratching or anything so that's a plus in my book!<br /><br />I wouldn't use this as a wedding ring unless you're into that kind of style and simplicity, but it's great otherwise."
5.0,"I absolutely adore my new knitted beanie with the eye lenses! It's such a genius idea, and makes it so convenient to wear while driving my electric scooter in the cold. The beanie is extremely comfortable and warm, and the eye lenses are a game changer. I can't believe I ever braved the cold without them. The beanie is also very stylish and looks great with any outfit. Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase and would give it a solid 5 stars."
5.0,Grea[ pair of sunglasses at and incredible price and #1 customer service. Extreme Uv I will be recommending you to every one who asks me about my new frames & will return myself forore in the future. Thanks for a terrific product and a comfortable and stress free customer experience.

5.0,"Not to happy with them, sorry"
5.0,Loved everything about this sweater except it’s Hand Wash only.
5.0,"Great quality (nice and thick), but you may want to wash with a color-catcher. The white parts are looking a little dingy after I washed it, but it's just as soft and plush as when I first got it!"
5.0,"I didn't notice this was a crop top when I bought it, but it is super cute and fits like it is supposed to."
5.0,Recently had shoulder surgery and had to purchase several of these because my Doctor would not let me take my brace off for six weeks.  These shirts are easy to use and comfortable.  Many commented that I looked like a mix of Michael Jackson and a Ninja.
5.0,"Purchased to use with my at home IPL device. Was worried it would hinder my vision, but it did not and was still easy to see. Thank you!"

5.0,"Love this dress. Great price, Cozy and well made."
5.0,"Comfy, plush robe. I am very short, 4'10"" robe falls well below my knees, sleeves are long enough to roll up to make cuffs. Ribbon closure on inside of robe is provided to insure robe remains closed even if the belt comes undone. Surprisingly excellent value 4 a modest price. Purchased one for my husband who was hospitalized, was so impressed I HAD to get one for myself."
5.0,runs small however it matched my dress color perfect
5.0,Kids loved them. IDK where they are now.
5.0,"These shorts are amazing and fit as expected! I'm 108 lbs. with a 24 in. waist and I ordered the small. They fit perfectly. I don't know if these other girls didn't measure themselves correctly or what but the measurements seem to be correct, in my opinion. Just measure yourself first."
5.0,Love comfortable lots.of.compliments
5.0,Nice design and comfortable snd flattering

5.0,Beautiful just like the picture and very soft. Fits great.
5.0,These are great quality and hold up very well! Great readers and very tough! I've dropped them multiple time and haven't broken yet!
5.0,First one broke. Sent a new one. Works well
5.0,"I expected these to run small due to other reviews. I wear a 7 1/2 baseball cap and these fit just snug. I'm use to skull caps and needed something if worse, a throw away hat for work. These have held up and stretch after use as well as shrinks due to your washing habits. Let them air dry and they don't shrink that much BTW. I would buy more, but in set now for years."
5.0,"This is for a gift. It is heavy, and it can be worn with gold or silver accessories!"
5.0,"Love this item, exactly as described and fits beautifully. I am a size 18 (UK) and wanted this to be loose fitting so I ordered XXL and it is a very comfortable fit. The blue color is brighter than the images on line, and actually nicer than i expected. Length of pants is also good. I havent washed it yet so dont know how it will behave after being laundered, but so far, I am delighted. It's fairly thin material, which i prefer, not too heave, but it you are looking for a heavyweight winter tracksuit, this might be on the light side."
5.0,Pretty good but the hood it’s self is small but good.
5.0,This was exactly what my grandson wanted.  You should have seen his smile.
5.0,My 8-year old daughter said she would give this &#34;a thousand stars&#34;. Seems like a great costume wig especially for the price. We've only used it once but so far so good.
5.0,"Bought these for my daughter's Winter Guard costume. Great fit, and very comfortable."
5.0,"Really comfortable, and cooler than expected."
5.0,I do love it tho I do wish the mask had a bit better fit
5.0,"Purchased this for my daughter's summer ballet intensive class. The size, AM, fits her perfectly. The built in bra shelf provides plenty of coverage and support. The leotard is very comfortable allowing her to move freely with nothing pinching or riding."
5.0,Nice color assortment and fit as expected.
5.0,It glows in the dark nicely.  Very small. but cute.
5.0,"Looks great and fit the buckle (purchased separately) perfectly. Easy to trim to length with good scissors. Only question is durability, time will tell."
5.0,The size is great for both my 1st and 3rd graders (6 and 8 years old)!  It’s medium sized so not too big where they need a chest clip and not too small so it fits standard folders easily. Great pockets and really like that it has two bottle holders on the side (sometimes boys get juice at school and they get lost at the bottle of backpack). The material feels very durable. Very happy with this purchase and wish I got it last year.
5.0,I wish it was an inch or two longer otherwise it comes in very handy after back surgery.
5.0,"Nice and thick, shiny, and sturdy , would buy again"
5.0,"Nice shirt, perfect fit. Unisex."
5.0,"I am a size 16. I ordered size XXXL. I am 5'4, the sleeves are a tad too long. but the overall fit is classy and versatile. I can wear around the house, to work, or out with friends, It is thin but not see through and flattering to full figure women."
5.0,"Very pretty, fit well, great quality for the price. She looked perfect in this dress. My daughter wore it on her 3rd birthday (image attached)"
5.0,Look great Christmas present
5.0,It was a present for my niece’s 16th birthday and she absolutely loved it!
5.0,Restores softness to leather
5.0,"Love this top! Sheer, soft and light and flowy. The material is good quality 👌  and fits well/loosely I'm a 36 DDD and ordered a medium. I think the large would have been too big"
5.0,Wowwwww... got so many compliments .. urban cool and clasyyy... don’t miss this. Thank you amazon.
5.0,"Soft, bought for my grandson, soft"
5.0,Cats love
5.0,"These are good quality, especially for the price. They are truly hypoallergenic. I am allergic to most earrings and have not had any sort of reaction with these! I typically wear small stud earrings and rarely wear anything else. So, these were perfect for me."
5.0,The material is great and it is flattering to your body
5.0,Things easily pull the threads in this dress; very thick material but lovely nonetheless

5.0,"I love this dress because it is comfortable, good quality, and cute. I am 135 lbs and 5'4"" and the small is a good fit. I like that it is ""flowy"" due to the pleats below the bust line. It is very cute with boots...can't wait to wear with my long boots. Also, looks good with tights and a long necklace. Very satisfied with my purchase.  Wouldn't mind having in more than one color!"
5.0,Super sexy....
5.0,Harness is a little to big
5.0,These are light and comfortable! Love to use them for an extra little surprise to a teacher gift or Mother’s Day gift. So many different designs to wear to so many different occasions!
5.0,"Great quality hat that folds up and fits in a pocket. I’m a bald dude and I’m forever battling the sun in the summer time. This hat is super easy to keep with me all the time.  Camping, ball games, picnics, outdoor weddings, graduations, etc.  I can whip this thing out, throw it on my head and my friends are like, where did you get a hat?  Bald dudes unite! Also, I have a few other OR products and they just seem to make good quality stuff."
5.0,I get a ton of compliments on this cover up.  We are on the Mississippi River every weekend and it doesn't get stained w/the muddy water color if it gets wet.
5.0,Fit perfectly. Came fast!
5.0,I work under strict OSHA guidelines so I have to be decked out in reflectives all the time. This sweater feels like it is worth a lot more than I paid for it. I will be buying more for sure it is super warm and very very comfortable it also zips up like a neck collar similar to a turtleneck underneath the hood. This is a good product. I'm a large XL with a barrel chest and your typical 43 year old dad bod and it fits me like a glove. Good Pockets also. I highly recommend this product
5.0,I’m a gardener and extremely pale in complexion. I burn and blister often. I found these light weight sleeves and they saved my arms all summer! I didn’t experience any sunburns to my arms. They are not heavy so you do not have to worry about being to hot.
5.0,"I am impressed with the quality of the Ergalogik toiletry bag!  I very rarely provide reviews, but this deserves one.  The quality of the fabric is very high.  I wish there were many other options for this material and standard of construction."
5.0,It is such a pretty chain.  Nice weight and lock. It is packaged in a lovely black trim velvet box.
5.0,Everything I received is good ! I'm satisfied with Amazon so far !
5.0,Yes...Especially when it’s hot!  I love this hat...
5.0,Great dress for a nice occasion. Great quality for the price.
5.0,"cheap, soft, light. Great for working out!"
5.0,My friend is a quilter. I bought these as a fun gift.
5.0,Nice and thin. Seems to be well made. A much thinner replacement for my old tri-fold wallet. I got rid of a lot of needless crap and went to thid bi-fold and my back thanks me every night. I not longer feel like George on Seinfeld in the &#34;one with George's Wallet!&#34;
5.0,Small and durable! Doesn’t bother you to sleep on
5.0,It's so pretty. I wear it every day.

5.0,Item arrived faster than expected. Great quality and color.

5.0,"product as described, received promptly"
5.0,"Beautiful earrings. I usually purchase earrings from QVC, but decided to try this pair as QVC did not have a malachite pair I liked. I feel the quality of this product is just as good as the ones I've recieved from QVC. Great detail and very light on the ears. I would recommend these to others!"
5.0,I love this dress! It's the perfect length.
5.0,"These bad boys run short, if you’re a 34 inseam, size up."

5.0,"I was Skeptical. These Glasses Were my First Time Ordering Something From Offline. I like to Look Unique. & these Glasses caught my Eye. The Shipping Was Fast I received them 4 Days Pryer to my Order & They Not Only Fit perfectly but looked AMAZING . Great Buy, I Highly Recommend"
5.0,I don't need the Snapchat filter anymore! I have my own pair of shades now lol<br /><br />Love it!
5.0,"Love it! I was sketchy to buy a one size fits all product because I just had a baby and I'm not quite sure exactly what my size is. However, it fits perfectly! They are soft and stretchy. Great for women with thick thighs and wide butts like me. I love the way the material feels."
5.0,"These guys were a little smaller than I expected, but they were very pretty. I got the hang of putting the tails thru my ear lobe fairly quickly - very cute!!"

5.0,Soft with a cute nerdy message. I love it! Fits fine as expected.
5.0,This bag is carried by a four year old fashionnesta and it puts a smile on her face each time she carries it.
5.0,These are the most useful bag ever!  The rugged construction stays open for easy loading or sorting in the bag.<br />No longer do I dread getting home from the grocery store.  Everything is easily moved from the car to the kitchen.<br />These are the same bag that utility companies use for work crews.  I have one from the 1960's and it still works great.  They make a great gift also.
5.0,"My rating is really more of a 4.5 but I love them so much I'll round up rather than down.  The earrings are high-quality and sturdy.  The pictures are slightly smaller than I expected but you can still see the picture clearly.  As others have mentioned, the posts are a little thick and took some coaxing to go into my normal gauge piercing but it really wasn't an issue. They're comfortable and they look great! Overall happy with the product."
5.0,"Very attractive and well made. Also, a good fit even over prescription glasses."
5.0,Great quality and selection!
5.0,I work in a skilled nursing facility and this costume had everyone laughing! Much needed during these difficult times.
5.0,My granddaughters LOVE them and
5.0,"I bought this cape for a skit at a retirement party. The cape was perfect. Great quality,  good material, perfect fit! I love it!"
5.0,This item was a Christmas gift for my wife and loved it.
5.0,Good quality. Just a bit too big for my 8 year old but she’s growing like a weed so it won’t be long...
5.0,This is put up for grand daughter for Christmas. She is going to LOVE it! Very pretty.
5.0,The softness of the fabric. Cute print.
5.0,Love these.  Got for a friend who’s  into coffee more than anyone I know
5.0,So beautiful. Look real.
5.0,I ordered the olive green dress in a large and it fit good but it could've been tighter. I'm 5'8 195 lbs so I decided to order this dress in a medium and it fits like a gloveeeeeeeeee!!! I love it!!!!
5.0,Just like gymshark! I weigh 138 and 5’5’ ordered at small and fits great!
5.0,"Needed a cute dress for a cruise.  This dress did not disappoint, and looks just like the picture.  I am 5'6 & 140 lbs and ordered a medium.  The fit was perfect.  The dress length is to the floor, so you definitely need to wear a sandal with a heel."
5.0,Cute & funny gag gift
5.0,Excellent!  A fashionable scarf
5.0,"I am a man but apparently my girlfriend ordered this. From what I can gander through shirts, I believe this fits toooooooooo small. Some would therefore call me lucky.<br /><br />The jury is still out on this one. Stay tuned..."
5.0,"I've purchased several of these at different locations,  and this is the best ones and my favorite ones out of all I have ordered.  Will definitely keep ordering these from now on!!!"
5.0,They work great I bought them for my girlfriend and she is in love with them and likes the feel of them on her ankles
5.0,Very comfy but if you have breathing issues such as asthma not the best option. Would buy again for my kids
5.0,Cute and functional as shape wear. I can wear it under a cardigan or under a shirt to help keep my shape smooth.
5.0,I’ve been wanting this design on a necklace for a long time. I just didn’t want to pay the insane prices on some of the necklaces. This one is very basic and not jeweler’s quality… but it’s a nice necklace for a few dollars that is well worth it at the price point. I bought it for myself so I didn’t need the gift box but the box is really nice if you were gifting it. Highly recommend.
5.0,"I am old enough to be picky about my jewelery.  These are not too big, not too small, good quality and great price.  I actuallly bought the set for a friend because she had been admiring the same set I had been wearing.  I can only wear real silver in my ears, and these were a steal at such a good price.  They look great as earrings alone, or worn in second holes with a larger pair as I usually do.  You cannot go wrong with these."
5.0,"I love the price for such nice, looking workout tanks! I like feeling like I look good when I work out because it boosts my self confidence and fires me up for the workout. Well, these tanks do just that! They look just as great as any Underarmour tanks and costs a ton less!!! This is my second set (they come in packs of 3) as they have become my favs!"
5.0,My daughter got this ring for her boyfriend since he is a mechanic. He loves it
5.0,Nice clipboards. The clip is sturdy and strong and feels stable. love the low profile clips over the traditional.
5.0,Got here super fast and nice packaging kept it from any damage from shipping. Arrived perfectly! Love it!
5.0,"This is the 6th time purchasing socks from Wander... Best socks I have ever purchased, fit is on point, style is great and the comfort is excellent !!!"
5.0,They are exactly as shown. I didn't pay attention to the sizing of it so I was a bit surprised by their tiny size but I find that it works and I love them! These are perfect for Gasparilla.
5.0,"Not recv'd yet, i am sure will be perfect just like all the dress i order !!"
5.0,Cool bag for whatever !!!
5.0,"So soft, cute and comfortable!"
5.0,"I have invested in several amber pieces from this company and am delighted with each and every pieces.  The craftsmanship of the jewerly is amazing and the amber itself, is beautiful.  Each amber piece is unique and fits the design of the jewelry.  Anyone wishing to include amber into their jewelry ensemble should not overlook pieces from Ian & Valeri Co."
5.0,Received these today and have been wearing them for the past 2 hours. Very comfortable and seem to have great optics. I looked these over very carefully and am impressed with both the design and build quality.<br />I'll definitely buy these again whenever I happen to need more reading glasses.
5.0,"I love this bag. I was looking for something that could be a backpack for when I’m riding the streetcar and need to be hands free but that also looks cute as a purse if I wanted to grab drinks after work or something. The best part is that the backpack straps come completely off, so it converts totally to purse style. This is a feature I found hard to find in a convertible bag. The quality is pretty good with strong metal zippers. It’s roomy without being obtrusive. It even fits my work laptop for the occasions when I have to bring it home. The compliments just keep rolling in for this bag. Very happy with the purchase!"
5.0,"For the price, these are awesome! I use them for driving in the rain to reduce glare of other cars' headlights."
5.0,"At first I hated these because they fit different than others. Now I love them they fit very different than traditional underwear they pull your butt up,  but once you get used to them they are great,  the material is awsome. I would try a pair and use them for a few days and then you will love them!"
5.0,De muy buena calidad y muy linda.
5.0,"These earrings are gorgeous.  Perfect length, width, and sparkle.  Glamorous,  but understated enough to wear every day.  The simulated morganite is soft and demure.  Could not be more pleased."
5.0,Cute and fit as expected! I’ve washed them and they didn’t fade.
5.0,"The perfect sweatpant. I'm not a little person so finding comfortable sweats that aren't skin tight or ""fitted"" without looking like a bag is near impossible.....but these are perfect. Super comfy, super soft...just the perfect blend of loose and yet fit. And pockets! Just perfection."
5.0,Super cute!!  True to size!!  Hits just above the knee.  Very satisfied.<br />Great deal!!
5.0,Perfect. Top quality. Highly recommend
5.0,For good and works great!
5.0,"I was dubious of amazon clothes. But the allegra k line does fit, a bit on the large side, which is a good thing. My shirts have gotten compliments."
5.0,Great product used it as soon as I got it looks great. Received item in a timely manner
5.0,"Very easy on and off. Great boots for a child with Autism or other learning disabilities, gross and motor skills."
5.0,"Bought two packs, will buy more. Great tanks for working out, crazy weather in Mexico, etc..."
5.0,"Love 'em!  As mentioned by most other reviewers this ""accoutrement"" is just a tad shy of covering my (rectangular) lenses on either side. I just center center it atop the frame--and to the unsuspecting *other* eyes--it's not an issue or noticeable.  My range of vision is protected when the Texas-Sun is its brightest.  And when I'm at work they remove easily and quickly to store in the clear plastic case they arrived in.  5 stars!"
5.0,"I honestly love everything about these leggings! I’m normally an 8 in jeans and tend to get a M in all my workout leggings. I was scared the S/M would be too small for me -according to the reviews, so I decided to size up. They fit REALLY well! Not as much compression as I would like but since the L/XL is meant to fit a size 10-14 (I think.. sizing chart is included on the web page) I knew they would be a little bit loose. 100% squat proof. Haven’t had the chance to work out with them.. so I think I’ll have to come back and update this review.. but so far so good!"
5.0,Didn't regret buying this for my daughter 3rd birthday.
5.0,These frames have a very unusual shape; I got a lot of compliments for them. The lenses are excellent and provide good protection while not being overly dark. I find them perfect for driving.<br />Recommended.
5.0,"I like the design and comfort of these masks better than any other disposable mask, the cut does not leave gaps on the sides, the nose wire is well positioned and flexible. It has a good amount of space inside so its not pressed on my mouth leaving it easier to talk and breath. The way it folds flat with the interior covered is great too. The earloops are soft and not uncomfortable at all. Its a well thought out design."
5.0,Got this for a guy and he loved it
5.0,I use them for work when working out almost everywhere.  I liked them a lot
5.0,"These leggings are super stretchy  comfy  and non see through,  I'm glad I bought them!"
5.0,"PROS:<br />-nice thick material, stretchy too<br />-super easy to identify luggage at the carousel<br />-nice thick zipper on the bottom<br />-feels super secure and prevents scuffing of luggage<br />CON:<br />-should've gotten this ages ago<br />*pro tip*: get one size up, according to their measurements, my luggage was a medium but i got a large size cover and it fit perfectly"
5.0,a gift for my mother.  she lit up as brightly as this bracelet did!  the packaging was very nice too!
5.0,Looks as nice in person.  My mom will love this.  Great value.
5.0,"The dress is beautiful, and well made."
5.0,This is a great band for the money. I think I actually prefer it to the one that came with my Fitbit. Fits great and is comfortable.
5.0,Great fit and material. Will definitely buy again!
5.0,"I chose the rose gold for my necklace and have my two kids names and birthstones on my necklace. I love it and have worn it several times and I have had it less than two weeks. I was skeptical when I ordered this necklace, but was pleasantly surprised with the great quality of this necklace. This would be a great gift to the Moms and Grandmas in your life. I didn't get a good picture of the names, but you get the idea."
5.0,"Bought for my grand daughter she loves it. Fits perfect, quality is good."
5.0,Love them. Not quite like the picture. But I still like them. I got them to be buddha for Halloween!
5.0,Own over 20 watches and I always go to grab this one
5.0,"These capris by Due East are great quality, made with a medium weight fabric with firm stretch. Fit is true to size. I could probably wear a small, I'm 5'8"" 135lbs. 28"" waist, 35"" hips. These yoga capris aren't super tight and are easy to pull on. The stitching is very nice, I've included photos or the cool logo found at the back waist band, and some photos showing quality tags and cuff stitching. Very nice, and the color/pattern is vibrant and energizing. Great value for a yoga pants that feel high end."
5.0,Good Tayloring  and size as standard. Fixed good.
5.0,Cool sweater. Keeps me warm when bench pressing in the early am hours. Classic brand. Looks like a quality sweat shirt. Will last
5.0,my boyfriend and i love the show and these are beautiful. some wear is starting to be noticeable but still pretty
5.0,Very decent for the price. I would suggest purchasing this if you're looking. I know my girl will love these as roses are her favorite flower.
5.0,Their legs are just not as big as Amercan womens.
5.0,"Exactly as described , but I will say they were heavier built than I expected."
5.0,Prefer purchasing US products.
5.0,This was a perfect item for a first time home owner. It was beautifully and carefully packaged. Great size and gleaming! Keys went on easily. Above pleased!
5.0,"ordered for my sister, no comments"
5.0,Lightweight.  Did actually provide a semblance of nice cooling-especially when a breeze hit the headband and it was damp.  Definitely worth the money
5.0,"These were just what I was looking for, especially the tarnish free. They are a nice size and look good, very shiny. I did have a little trouble with the hooks being tight at first."
5.0,"This watch is very pretty and the quality is great. The only wish is that it was made a little bigger, or had a way to extend it."
5.0,My cousins loved this as a gift!
5.0,Laundry bag
5.0,"Nice pants. Good material, not too thin, looks like jeans."
5.0,These are comfortable for my elderly father

5.0,I LOVE IT SO MUCH.  Thanks!💕
5.0,"Wifey here on husbands account..purchased the Flower Mix Blue long sleeved dress and love it! 5'4"" 130pds 36D. Falls just to my knees. Super cute with my knee high boots. It doesn't make me look pregnant with large breasts as a lot of these type dresses do. Ordering another color!"
5.0,"Overall experience was great, quality product!"
5.0,What a great deal! Love the fabric and ordered 3 more skirts in different colors/patterns. This is my new favorite skirt.

5.0,I love this shirt--light weight--as described
5.0,"These were purchased for my grandsons (twins).  They fit well, and the bottom texture helps them keep from slipping.  We also love the bright colors."
5.0,This was perfect for my occasion.  Love it!!!
5.0,"What you see is what you get!  Nice, thick, and cozy!  My daughter loves it!"
5.0,great style choice
5.0,Love them. Get compliments often.
5.0,Love the fit its just perfect
5.0,This swimsuit is basic but adorable! I have a hard time buying swimsuits since I had my baby. This one covers what it should but still makes me feel comfortable. Stays in place too!
5.0,Love this shirt! I like having unusual tshirts.
5.0,Great warm slippers
5.0,"This is super soft and fits true to size, love this sweater it is so warm"
5.0,The installing was nerve racking and hard work. But it payed off!!! I love the results and feel like i added value into my gbo. Thankyou!!
5.0,Just hot these today on time and big and Fabulous!!! NO chemical smell which is GREAT! Plastic jersey type material I got them so I could keep one in my car for eating out so I don't ruin my shirt! LoL silly as it sounds but you won't be thinking that when you get taco sauce all over your nice shirt! They are also long enough to protect your pants. So do yourself a favor and invest in these you'll be glad you did!
5.0,Love love them never go out without it have been promoting in my communizy
5.0,"Purchased for daughter who is very happy with the set. The socks are kind of nubby and may not be the most comfortable, but we did not buy it for the socks."
5.0,"excelente producto, desde vzla 100% recomendado... la talla, el color, el modelo, y la oportunidad de la entrega no es cuestionable, muchas gracias..."
5.0,"I bought these pants for postpartum just to lounge around the house but they have become the perfect pant for a recovery from a csection.  They are soft, wash well, comfortable, don't rub on incision or stitches, comfy fpr sleeping or awake and with the right top they can look like you actually dressed youself.  I have them in 4 colors and I live them."
5.0,I love this!  So comfortable!
5.0,"Can’t say enough about these awesome glasses. They are so cute, comfortable, well made, clear glass, and you get 3 pairs ! I’m going to order more for backup."
5.0,Reminds me of Killstar products
5.0,I ordered these and received them today. I love how they look and they're not heavy.
5.0,"I bought this dress in Medium and it fits.  I am 5'7&#34; tall, weigh 132 pounds, and am an apple shape.  The dress is very flattering."
5.0,My baby girl got her visitor… she’s so young and I had to teach her how to wear a pad. She hated wearing a pad so I bought these. She was so happy to be free from pads and she literally just started using them.  I will buy more in a bigger size because she has a round bum.
5.0,Such soft material and perfect size!!!
5.0,Perfect Replacement!! Love the Teal color!
5.0,Love the design. I didn't think they would fit since I'm a size 6 shoe. Great quality for the price.
5.0,I love this dress! So soft and flattering. Can't beat it for the price.
5.0,"I love it, I bought for my grandson since he's going to be a big brother in a few months.  it's not a thick material."
5.0,Pretty.  Big though.
5.0,I love the low profile design of this watch I bought it because I thought I lost a different watch. The moment I place my order I found my original watch. So when the package finally showed up I decided to give it a shot and I absolutely fell in love with the low profile design. My original watch would constantly catch on all of my sweatshirts at the cuff this one is so thin that the sweatshirt just glide's right over it and doesn't catch it.
5.0,came in great packaging and very quickly. The sizes work great for myself and my husband. we use them to lift weights and with our military jobs.<br /><br />i received this product in exhange for my opinion.
5.0,Le encanto muchísimo esta súper
5.0,Love it - This made packing so easy and organized for me! I went for a week-long trip to Napa and was able to bring only one carry on.
5.0,This tunic is better than I expected.  Lovely and bright colours.  Fitted very well.  Shipped on time.
5.0,My husband loved it! It kept his head warm on our cruise to Alaska.
5.0,"I thought they would be flimsy and cheap, just wanted to try them and I love the Quality!"
5.0,Correr mi Harley
5.0,Just what I want. Size is good. Legs are a bit long but that is good for cold feet nights😄
5.0,"Great fabric, love this gloves"
5.0,Daughter loved it as did everyone else. They thought it was really cool
5.0,Good quality. My daughter loves it.
5.0,this is the coolest ring i own.  I intend to get more of them.  the band is thicker then a regular ring so wearing rings on finger right next to this band can be uncomfortable. other wise this is the bomb.com  I have gotten numerous compliments.
5.0,Works well on kids
5.0,Provides good coverage and will be useful for wedding dress.
5.0,"I really loved this tail it worked out great for what I used it for. Good quality and really long! I'm 5'2"" and this tail went to mid/lower calf. Looking forward to having this tail for many years to come!"
5.0,"Mehr makes quality products. I love that they aren’t real expensive and yet look like it. I have the valet key chain in red, and ordered this one (Classic, multi-ring) in black.  I thought it would be a nice token gift for my husband. I like that it is neutral (unisex) and anyone can use it. It is black leather and chrome. The only difference that I will note, between the two keyrings, is that unlike the valet one, you can’t really remove the keys as easily. However, this keyring comes with three individual rings, that you can attach to the larger ring. This is perfect if you don’t carry a lot of keys, or if your car key is not bulky. **Note, some of the new cars have those big fobs which might not fit. However, because these keychains are so inexpensive (under $10), they make the  perfect gifts. For example, brides and grooms can purchase these for the bridal/bachelor party.  They would be perfect stocking stuffers, or gifts for co-workers. I’d highly recommend the Mehr brand and their products."
5.0,Soft but it legs gather when you sleep and bunch at your knees. Makes it uncomfortable.
5.0,Very light weight  frameless  Awesome
5.0,The fit is perfect. I’m a 34DD so I was worried the medium was going to be too tight around the chest area but it wasn’t.  Very flattering. I’m going to order the white flower print.
5.0,I like it.it was the way I picture it.
5.0,"I absolutely love this handbag Light. I will be getting more of these. this light is bright and does as it says. it stays on about 15 seconds or so, and as soon as my hand goes in my bag my light comes on. this light is perfect for so many uses."
5.0,"Nice underwear and good quality. But the US L size is too small for me, so I buy it again XD"
5.0,"This dress is so much fun. Staying consistent with my other reviews of Bella clothing, buy your right size. Not the size you want to be. Trust me! I am a normal size 10, but buy all XL in Bella because XL lays nicely and is not too tight. This style of dress is meant to be conservative sexy, not Pretty Woman sexy.<br />The navy color is so pretty with the red embroidery and the red buttons. Great quality!"
5.0,I purchased to wear with a pink shirt but there are lots of colors so will probably wear with other things. Sometimes multi colored scarves look sort of 'muddy' but this particular color combination blends really well. It is also lightweight but I was surprised to note that it has a lot of 'body' and retains shape when arranging it. Super price - its a winner!
5.0,Loved how dainty they were.  Gave them to a sisterhood of 8.  Some kept  them as keychains some used it as a pendant on their chain or bracelet.
5.0,Works beautifully and stores neatly in a fitted zip-loc.
5.0,Love it. Made a great and unique Father's Day gift
5.0,Gift that eas loved
5.0,"i absolutely love this coat. I get complements everywhere I go with it and people ask &#34;we're did you get it&#34;, &#34;that's a beautiful coat&#34;. It's  definitely an eye catcher to all, truly an excellent product!!!"
5.0,Good product.  Would purchase again.
5.0,Nice looking watch and very pleased.  Price was great.  Would buy from this company again.
5.0,"Like the pockets to use 2,5 filter pads"
5.0,These shoes are spectacular quality
5.0,"This ring is awesome, not bulky but still big enough! Love it!"
5.0,"Was just what I was looking for, will work perfectly!"
5.0,"I love these light weight house shifts, they are cute, light weight , with a zip up and big pockets.perfect ,cute and comfortable. They do run small so order up a size.  They are strictly for the house, but since most of us are stuck inside bc of the pandemic, their perfect!"
5.0,Husband really loved it… it’s his favorite muppet
5.0,Beautiful! Bought a few for my friends...they love them
5.0,fast shipping great product
5.0,"This dress was great! I needed it for a white party and it was a choice out of three other dresses. I selected this dress because it was comfortable, breathable and elegant. Very happy with this style and design. Thank you!"
5.0,This is exactly as advertised. I unfortunately don't know my gauge and this is way too small. I will lose it in no time but that's my fault.
5.0,I love this dress. I ended up buying 7 of them in different patterns and get so many compliments!  Also true to size
5.0,"love the array of colors, wear them with everything"
5.0,"This dress is very pretty. I always used size XL for dress and i ordered size XL and it fit perfectly to me.  I can wear sneakers, sandals or heels with it. The dress is stretchable and i so love how the dress flows. This is definitely recommended."
5.0,gorgeous but I wish they came with extra pins
5.0,"By following the seller's size chart, I received a comfortable size that looks very polished and professional on me. I purchased it for a client presentation and it didn't disappoint.  Fabric is better than expected and had a stretch to move with you. Will purchase from this seller again."
5.0,Easy way to identify luggage among the sea of grey and black cases.  Also helps keep luggage clean.
5.0,"def not the fabric i expected but that's my bad. super cute though, true to size. will be wearing these a lot this summer."
5.0,Perfect for work I’m impressed with the quality of the shirts
5.0,It was for a friend  going into the hospital. He loved it.
5.0,My son loved them. Said they are very comfortable and don't make his feet hot on the field. They are a little on the long side but dont bother him at all.
5.0,Great deal for the brand name and the price.  My 6 year old loves this shirt!
5.0,Very comfortable and nice fit!!<br />Great quality fabric too!!
5.0,"Got these for a sailing trip in Grenada.  The frames have a solid feel and I wore them daily with no eye strain from the glare of the sun off the water.  I wore them pretty much all day long, except when snorkeling and they held up fine.  Also sat nicely on my head, holding back my long hair, when I pushed them back.  The only thing I would note is that the lens is not completely opaque, meaning that others can faintly see your eyes, sun or shade."
5.0,IT WAS HUGE.and quite sturdy(I had my dought from reviews)the straps are cushony and solid and did I mention it was huge?! And I love the fact it has a big sleeping bag slot at the bottom.but who is gonna have that big a sleeping bag? My only complaint was there are only 5 adjustment slots and with it being a huge bag I want it higher up on my shoulders.
5.0,Great blanket for the price
5.0,I got a lot of great comments
5.0,I love my rose gold watch. The band looks more like a bracelet and the scallop face makes it unique. Each time I wear it I always receive compliments. I will definitely be purchasing more Wristology products.
5.0,Grandson loves to play in water and mud.  These are holding up well for him.
5.0,"I initially got a large but the medium fit much better- I am 5’5” size 10. Vest is so soft. Better suited to wear inside, or on a early fall or late spring day outside."
5.0,"It runs small, if it was not for small wrists, it would not have fit me.  If you hold it up it looks like a child's watch."
5.0,"Perfect earrings! Look real, well made, symmetrical and sparkly!"
5.0,"I love this purse!  It is a great value for the price and not as heavy as it would be if it were all leather.  Contrary to other reviews, all of my zippers work and I get a lot of compliments on this bag. The two main compartments is nice too.  I hate a lot of pockets in a purse."
5.0,"Finally a nice ring for guys! It's perfect! It's a good size, not too small. or big and gaudy. It's nothing flashy, just a nice black ring. It has a smooth finish to it, so it won't &#34;catch&#34; on anything and makes it perfect for everyday wear. My 25 year old son loves it.<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,I like this case alot. I would recommend it. It is sturdy and fits a Moto 5 with plenty of space. also includes a back pocket.
5.0,So cute! A v neck that is not revealing at all. Nice and long. The sleeves are hilariously long but they can be scrunched or rolled up because this shirt is perfection! I’m a size 18 and the XXL fits comfortably. I love this shirt!
5.0,They are the same as my old pair in size and fit and looks
5.0,"Please bring these packing cubes with both sides back.  No where to find these. Glad I purchased in 2016; however, need to purchase more and now are not available."
5.0,"super cute, just as vibrant as in the pictures"
5.0,Both sisters loved the bracelets.  Purchased one for myself as well.  Only negative is the bracelet is very hard to bend so Sliding it on and off can be a little difficult.  Other than that I like it!
5.0,A good investment.
5.0,"Love this garment.  Have purchased 4 of them; 2 black and 2 grey<br />Nice beefy material, cozy, fashion forward look."
5.0,My dad uses this chain ALL the time!!
5.0,My son says they r the most comfortable shoes he has had.
5.0,"Maybe I just have small hands, but I’m a grown woman and my hands fit great in the gloves! There is a little room, even. I’m very happy with them!"
5.0,I am my friend's maid of honor and got it for one of her Bridal Showers and she loves it!
5.0,"This is not the first time I have bought this brand.My husband is very slim. He's perfect.This shirt is well made and hasn't shrunk yet.He loves design, and it's normal to wear a place to work.Recommend this shirt to everyone."
5.0,It fit me perfectly until I washed and dried it then it shrunk a lot. Going to reorder in a size larger!
5.0,"Fits great, long waisted, as a woman, plenty of room in the chest!"
5.0,This is a well made shirt. My father loved it!
5.0,Absolutely love this tank!!
5.0,I purchased a few pairs of sunglasses at the same time and these are by far the best. they look great; work well; and they do not have any metal parts that get stuck in your hair when you put them on the top of your head. Great buy!
5.0,"I really liked these socks.  I thought it was a bit expensive, but they are comfortable.  I really like the extra padding on toes and heel which works great when I wear my steel toed boots for work.  They keeps my legs circulating too."
5.0,Very sparkly.  They are beautiful.
5.0,"My daughter loves everything about these boots, the only negative would be that one of the buttons fell off after  just two days of wearing the boots. thankfully, we didn't lose the button and easily  sew it back on."
5.0,Love them. I have 3 long WF black and striped ones. So very comfortable and look great. Awesome and thank you. Great price too.
5.0,"Good support, but soft, comfortable and airy. Fit is perfect."
5.0,"Very light, very comfy, really helps with computer. Have it for a weeks. Does what it has to do. Highly recommend.<br />Bought 4 pair of different sizes for me and my friend. Very happy."
5.0,I took a chance with ale hung without many reviews because this was a unique set. It is great! The stickers and tattoos are an added bonus.
5.0,"Best beanie hat i have bought in years<br />Great fit,soft and warm really like the soft inner lining"
5.0,It's like I am not wearing anything and I live it!
5.0,"I love this piece as well, i purchased along with the matching earrings.  I posted how I loved the clarity of the stones, they are so brilliant."
5.0,It's cute and the people are nice.
5.0,makes packing for longer trips much easier & I get to take more items.
5.0,I loved it but my wife hated it so she threw it away. Run it by your wife first.
5.0,My son Loves it !!
5.0,Looks great on my daughter.  She wears a small in clothing and it fits perfect.
5.0,"This is a nice rain poncho. It has rip stop fabric with an inner waterproof coating. The large size is nice to cover my pack. It is lightweight and the small size is easy to store. I'm 6 feet tall and it reaches below my knees. I always get a little sweaty in waterproof garments. That's why I choose a poncho, it has the best air circulation. It should also make a good wind breaker, but it will flap a bit. I haven't tried it as a tarp yet, but the grommets are there and appear to be sturdy. I'm happy with the purchase."
5.0,I bought these for my daith piercing because I was having surgery. They are great!
5.0,My husband loves it. He looks very handsome in this nice jacket.
5.0,"I’m extremely happy with the results considering the price.  $100 for a good cosplay.  Fabric was comfortable not too heavy or itchy. Hubby is 5’10”, 210 lbs, size 38 pants, but pants have an elastic waistband & tunic string is adjustable as well as stomach band velcro so I think it could fit a slightly heftier build if need be.<br />Easy to assemble.  Tie string on the side for the tunic, then throw on 2 shoulder fabrics, then the stomach strap was easy Velcro.  We used this for Tirion Lannister costume.  I think the sender was actually fairly quick with the shipment too.  A+ experience overall.  Would save this seller."
5.0,"This is a great quality, thick material sweatshirt.  Highly recommended."
5.0,"Super comfortable, and juuuust long enough for me, as I'm 5'10&#34;, 160lb, with wedges. Wore for a 70s party and they worked great. Will fit most, as they are super stretchy and really light and comfortable."
5.0,Came just as pictured. It fit my 7 year old perfect and he has a larger head so I was worried the youth size wouldn’t fit well. Good material.
5.0,Everything about these sandals is perfect...
5.0,Perfect! love the color and arrived before expected! :)
5.0,beautiful and great fit. a little difficult to close but once done are staying in place.  nice addition to my collection
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9efc551ce3d15ed9709eea4d9a2be40b]]This is truly a beautiful bag that is the right size for an iPad Mini or other small electronic device.  It has the two tone color that makes the bag look 'rich' and fashionable.  The zippers are of high quality and durable.  I filled the bag completely with items I need when going to work (and in fact over-stuffed it to see if it would hold up) and the zipper remained easy to open and close and did not struggle to keep the things in the bag securely.  This is important to me as I have had other bags in the past where the zipper could not handle an overstuffed bag and failed after just a very short amount of time.<br /><br />The bags measurements are as follows: 11.7x3.9x7'8&quot;.  The shoulder strap can be adjusted to various lengths, but I could not get it to go long enough to where I could comfortably wear it as a cross body bag.  I am 5'10&quot; though and like my bag to hang fairly low when I wear it cross-body style.  I suggest you consider the length of the strap if your preferred method of carrying this bag is cross-body (especially if you are tall like me).<br /><br />The product description mentions a possible strong leather odor when you first receive the bag.  While I did notice a faint odor, it was not strong enough to bother me.  I let the bag sit out overnight and it was great the next day.<br /><br />POCKETS<br />The bag has a pocket on the back that is closed with a magnetic snap button.  It is big enough for an iPhone 6S+ or similar device if you so choose.  It has another slider pocket under the flap that is also large enough for a cell phone, wallet or other similar sized items.  The inside of the bag is lined with a nylon liner and has a small zippered pocket and two slider pockets (see video and pictures).<br /><br />I will probably use this bag mostly as a casual shopping bag for when I go to the mall, etc.  It is large enough to hold my phone, wallet, keys, brush, make-up and other daily essentials.  It looks great with my leather boots and completes my outfit in a way that I love.<br /><br />I received a free sample of this bag in exchange for my review. I use all products before I rate them and strive to be unbiased and truthful. I rate this leather bag 5 stars based on my personal experience with this product.  After making the video I took this bag with me on a trip to the museum, and loved how comfortable this bag was to carry.  I had easy access to all items I needed access to, and yet my wallet and phone were securely stored in a pocket hard to reach by pickpockets. Love this bag!"
5.0,fits perfectly and came on time
5.0,"Delgado, delicado, se ve muy bonito."
5.0,"This necklace is so cute. It makes the perfect gift for any Swiftie in your life, or wvwn a treat for yourself. As a riff on TS' signature necklace, it adds that special touch and extra sparkle to any outfit, and is perfect for anyone who was lucky enough to see her live show. Excellent choice!"
5.0,"I am shocked that I loved this dress so much.  It arrived the next day and is super cute and fits great.  I am usually an 8, but after reading reviews, I ordered the small and it fit perfectly."
5.0,I wear them with my tunics and love the texture!
5.0,"These hats are very cute and stylish for the price and the material they are made of is very soft, light and breathable.  My girls don't usually like hats but they don't mind wearing these. They are noy necessarily warm enough for the winter months but perfect for warm summer days. We bought them for our 4 month old preemie twins and they still fit just fine, 3 months later.<br />I definitely recommend these hats for chic babies!"
5.0,I wear them all the time outside when it rains
5.0,Love everything about them! The material is cool and comfortable. Thr color Stoneleigh gray is a nice greige. The legs don't dig in when you sit either. Then again I normally size up for shorts. Im 5'5&#34; and 133lbs with some muscle in my legs. I usually wear a 4 and sometimes a 6. I order a 6 in under armour shorts. I love them so much that I replaced them after I shrunk out of my size 14s! My favorite part about these is that you can dress them up a bit or dress them down.
5.0,Looks great for the price. The color is bright great ring
5.0,Unique Ravens shirt; long sleeve is nice in the winter.  Men's size fit perfectly.  Comfy
5.0,I have another one and ordered a second one because I like it so much
5.0,LOVE IT 😍.
5.0,Cute--nice
5.0,"As always Lanz is awesome quality, fit and comfortable."
5.0,Perfect fit!!! Easy to replace
5.0,"Extremely comfortable! It's flowy, airy, and long. The pockets might hold chapstick or something small like that but not big enough for most cellphones out today. I like that the dress hides my big feet and is stylish. I'd recommend this dress to everyone."
5.0,"Love these slip on sneakers!!  This is my second pair, they are so comfortable!!!<br />Wish they had more colors!!"
5.0,absolutely looks real - -- love AVON - their chains NEVER turn.  I have a necklace over 20 years old and the chain and charm look like brand new still today.
5.0,Fits my 10&#34; Lenovo yoga perfectly and looks awesome! Good quality as well!
5.0,Super comfortable in any season airy in the spring and summer comfy with leggings in colder times
5.0,Bought a 7 for 7 yr old.  Just right
5.0,Beautiful vibrant colors!!!
5.0,I just love them so much !! They are super cute & the quality it’s great!!
5.0,"I bought this for traveling because I have been making a serious effort to lighten my travel gear.  This folds up to nearly pocket-size and unfolds into the perfect size travel bag - great for necessities and a few purchases.  By itself, it weighs seriously practically nothing!  It also has several pockets and zippers.  It's just a perfect travel bag!"
5.0,Much easier than having a wallet in your back pocket. I brought one for myself and a second one for a good friend of mine.
5.0,"This bag! It's amazing to find a combination of such great design and attractive materials at this price. It looks REALLY good.<br /><br />I love that it's vegan leather, both for the animal/welfare & planet-saving aspects and because it's not as heavy to carry as leather, but sometimes vegan leather looks too fake. Not in this case; they did a really good job with the materials. The hardware is good-looking and substantial too. The bag looks MUCH more expensive than it is. I've only had it a month but so far it's holding up well -- I guess if it falls apart prematurely I'll update this, but so far so great.<br /><br />I also love that there are interior and exterior pockets. I put my sunglasses in the vertical exterior pocket. There's another outside pocket and inside, there's a phone-size zipper pocket on one side and two little open pockets on the other. I have to sadly agree that the big zipper pocket and divider in the middle aren't working for me.  I so appreciate that the designer understands we need pockets, and it's kind of awesome because it's not only a separate big zipper compartment but it's attached to one side so it creates another open compartment, which is cool -- but when I reach into my bag, I can't tell where I am in there unless I set down my bag and look in it. It's confusing. I'll probably remove that interior zipper bag by taking out the stitches with a nail scissors but leave it in there loose -- I can put little things in it that otherwise tend to get lost in a big bag and then just take the whole thing out when I need one of those things. Which is actually a good end result.<br /><br />Anyway, this bag is gorgeous and such an irresistible good deal. I love carrying it! Way to go, Dasein!"
5.0,"Very cute, fits my key perfectly, arrived quickly. The chain it comes with seems sturdy enough."
5.0,"Cute and warm! Love the non-slick bottoms of the feet. It’s always nerve wracking to have a toddler running around with socks on their feet but these have the grippy bottoms. A little big for size but my daughter is in between a 2t and 3t. 2 t is a little too small, but 3t is a little too big."
5.0,"I love this dress.  It is very flattering.  I ordered pink, but I received a peach color dress.  It is okay because I like the fit of the dress."
5.0,Gift for daughter for Christmas.She loves them
5.0,"I have only had them a few days, but I have noticed reduced eye strain-meaning my eyes have not felt tired after working on the computer or after using my phone for a period of time. I am hopeful I will continue to enjoy them & the benefits they offer."
5.0,"It's a nice lightweight cover up! I went up a size for comfort, but my regular size would've fit well too. It washed nicely, did not experience any shrinking."
5.0,"The materials of this bracelet feels and looks much better than one I previously owned. Note: while the description said it was 3 inches, the inside diameter measured is only 2.5&#34; like many others sold online."
5.0,"This dress is modest, comfortable, and very pretty. The picture shows it very well."
5.0,gift for my mother-in-law.  she loves it.
5.0,Love it - nice distressed look but the hat is quality made.
5.0,Love these earrings. Very lightweight and pretty
5.0,Item as stated and fit was as expected.
5.0,Inexpensive and very functional. I love it.
5.0,Super cute- can't believe this set was $10.
5.0,I’m going on 4 years and I decided it was time to pat myself on the back with a nice little reminder to carry around. Fits my chip perfectly!
5.0,Simply outstanding.  I ordered a half size smaller than normal and the fit was perfect.  The quality of the materials and construction were excellent.  Great arch support and heel cushioning.  Big help for my plantar fasciitis.  Highly recommended.
5.0,Looked just like the pic
5.0,I love these earrings! I'm wearing on my Caribbean cruise. They are bigger than I imagine but not huge. So you will be able to see them if my hair is down.
5.0,This vest is 100% as advertised!! Great bang for the buck.
5.0,Really good for my water aerobics.
5.0,"absolute beautiful!<br />comes in gift box in a very well made pouch, great for gift as it felt like a $80 belt for around $20.<br /><br />belt itself had very strong leather smell (that a plus), very well made, and the metal buckle mechanism requires no holes and is so much easier to put on and release.  the belt is very long i have a waist of 36&#34; and i have alot left over, i'd assume it would be fine for a waist size of around 42&#34;"
5.0,"These were perfect for a pirate themed race. I have fairly large calves (17 in around) and there was no issue with wearing these. They were snug at the top but didn't hurt and didn't fall down. I would highly recommend these. I will note that they did not go above my knees, but I was very satisfied with this purchase. Also, they aren't super thick but they aren't see thru either and I honestly didn't want something too thick as I was running"
5.0,I love the pendant it is even more beautiful in person thank you so much.
5.0,"I have DD chest / 34 waist . I ordered a small . One time wear , but it was so freaking pretty . My fault I washed it with other clothes and not on  gentle cycle . The side came undone . But I can however Needle and thread it back together. Only came apart a few inches"
5.0,Very pretty.  It looks and feels like leather.  There is nothing written on any tag in English that says it is leather.  I like the design and the feel of the wallet.
5.0,Greeat fit I'm a xl but I bought a 2x beautiful dress I purchased to wear for my birthday in a few weeks
5.0,"I ordered the cap for my grandson, a great Angels fan.  It is just what he wanted.  He loves it."
5.0,"nice fit, very pretty detail"
5.0,"Works great. I use them at work. I needed something I could wear all day every day, these are it."
5.0,"beautiful well made, shoes.  well worth the money"
5.0,Very pleased with this top. A bit loose but definitely in a great way!
5.0,"Great bag. Easy to get through security checks since it only has three compartments. Perfect size, love how it looks. Seems very durable, has survived many long days being lugged around full of stuff."
5.0,Love love love. Really cute
5.0,great product!!! very comfortable to wear!!!
5.0,Love them. They are comfortable and hold up throughout my 12 hour shift. They are fun!!
5.0,I really love this bracelet. It came very fast and I am very happy with the quality of it. Beautiful.
5.0,I purchased these for my daughter for softball. She loves them and said they  are comfortable.  Will buy again....
5.0,"Works great as a maternity bathing suit. I'm 5'3&#34;, 110 pounds and am trying to hide my 5 1/2 month prego belly. Does great."
5.0,I  love  it  very  beautiful  thanks
5.0,5'4&#34; 135lbs and they fit great. I like to wear them for soccer games on turf. The design is cool too.
5.0,"Purchased these for my daughter and she absolutely loved them! They are super thick, plush, warm and comfortable. They are well-made and absolutely adorable!"
5.0,Strong keychain
5.0,The glasses work very nicely over my prescription glasses
5.0,"I had read that mittens keep your hands warmer than gloves, so I bought these and I must say they really do keep my hands warmer than any pair of gloves I have ever had.  I love them!"
5.0,My husband uses it as a carrying case for his laptop.  It looks good (weathered) and is durable.
5.0,"This is a very beautiful necklace, wish I could get it in white"
5.0,"These are amazing shoes. I will say that they run a little small. The 8 was more like a 6, I am an 8 or 8 1/2  and I couldnt even get my foot in the 8. The 10 fits well though. I also have large calves and manage to lace them up just fine. I have gotten TONS of compliments on them everywhere I go, restaurants, the furniture store, parties. Everyone wants to know where I got them."
5.0,Very sturdy pair of glasses and polarized. 10 out of 10 for the price.
5.0,You met my expectations ' Love the dress '' fits just right!! And pretty fast shipping.... Would definally order again.
5.0,I ordered this for my birthday! Reviewed a lot of different outfits and settled on this and another one because I wasn’t too sure if it was too revealing.. It was not. I never even put the other dress on lol The way it covers only shows a little skin on the sides and in the chest area. Would recommend this to anyone!
5.0,"Love the material! Long scarf, warm highly recommended it."
5.0,"Best, most comfortable boots I've owned to date. They run big, but not enough to go down a size or even half size. If you have wide feet, definitely get the EW (extra wide)."
5.0,"I have two pairs of these now they're great for the price, comfy stretchy & mine don't look see through they're thicker than leggings."
5.0,They are awesome and very flattering. Also very comfortable to wear...
5.0,"If you're looking for a truly slouchy, lightweight beanie - eureka! This is not built for freezing temps, but is perfect for my SoCal climate and other temperate seasons/climates.  Many beanies call themselves ""slouchy"" but this really lives up to the title; lots of extra room to double the beanie for extra warmth or wear slouchy.  It feels soft to the touch as well.  Love it!"
5.0,I love these cute little disco ball earrings! I've worn them several times with no allergic reaction to the posts and they seem to be really good quality; I wouldn't sleep or shower in them though. I want more in different colors.
5.0,My daughter wanted these bands for Christmas but the set she wanted sold out. We ordered them when they came back into stock and she really likes them for her new watch.
5.0,"ordered to use on my swim goggles and so far, it has worked to keep the fog off them as I swim."
5.0,Super soft material fits perfectly my daughter totally loved it
5.0,Gifted my friend and it looks very elegant!
5.0,Good quality fabric my daughter lovea the shirt.
5.0,I lost my first pair and had to get another.  I have had so many compliments on this pair.  Thinking of getting another just in case they stop making them!
5.0,"You get what you pay for. I do not intend that as a criticism. It is inexpensive and feels that way, but you can store a remarkable amount of stuff in it. I try to not be rough on it, so I anticipate it lasting years."
5.0,These Phasfun Evo glasses work fine and are comfortable. Would be nice if YY included a tether.
5.0,"very well made and super adorable, definitely recommend!"
5.0,Very orange in person but otherwise great!
5.0,EVERYBODY loved it! BUT It runs at least one size small.
5.0,Very forgiving
5.0,Did what I wanted.  Make hubby happy
5.0,"Nice, heavy, cotton tee. Washed nice. No shrinkage"
5.0,Bought it for my wife. Fits very well. Exactly what I expected.
5.0,"Love it and priced very well. The only thing I really did not care for is there is like a protected sleeve on inside of ring and twice while removing the ring, the sleeve stayed on my finger. Other than that, there is no way you can go wrong by purchasing this ring."
5.0,Very good  and pretty  too.
5.0,Good quality dress and sizes are accurate
5.0,"Beautiful crafted purse. Not to big but not to small, it fits my wallet and my phone, it also has a zippered pocket for smaller items."
5.0,sweater is so pretty. very comfy!
5.0,"The cut is too open, if you're comfortable with that it's a beautiful sweater."
5.0,Perfect shoes for baby girl. She was taking off every pair of shoes I got her until these. great buy!
5.0,"These are some of the softest yet still sturdy socks I've ever worn. They have just enough thickness to wear w/ my size 10W athletic shoes. The top band is snug w/o being tight and I have a little bit of ankle swelling. The height above the shoe is just right, too. Hope they wash well. Another nice thing: came folded in a plastic bag with NO irritating plastic tabs to keep pairs together. I'll never buy another brand now."
5.0,"Great variety, quality material"
5.0,The fit is what I like most.  I bought a size larger base on other comments.  Because of that it has a lovely drape instead of clingy fit.  The lace on the sleeves is a nice feminine touch.
5.0,My husband said they did what were suppose to do.
5.0,Amazing quality. It has held up on my keys for months
5.0,Nice and sturdy umbrella and so pretty on a rainy drab day! Would recommend this product.
5.0,"What I love about this pendant is that I have been wearing for quite a long time and it's still in beautiful silver color although I have been putting drops of EO on tiny pieces of cotton. All the other pendants I bought for this purpose were looking terrible after just a few weeks of use. My silver pendant has more than a couple of months now and it's still glamorous.<br /><br />Highly recommend it, for EO use also. Just use tiny pieces of cotton. Easy to dispose and exchange oils. No need to keep buying pad replacements."
5.0,This is the same one you find in the mall but at half the price. We took it to the mall and compared.
5.0,My best friend's mom bought me this dress for my baby shower & it is perfect! I was able to stay with my pre-baby size. I got the wine red & it is perfect! So Happy with this dress
5.0,love this shoe. I always get compliment whenever I wear this shoe. i recommend this shoe.
5.0,Great set of earrings. Love them
5.0,For the price of these gloves you can't go wrong. I have spent big dollars on name brand gloves that are no better than these. Throw away gloves at a good price IMHO...
5.0,This is a perfect necklace
5.0,I have a small head and it adjusted to my head without  leaving a long strap.
5.0,"These are beautifully made, the price was amazing, and they were quickly delivered!"
5.0,"great, nice material, and fit as expected"
5.0,Buen producto pero corre un poco grande
5.0,My daughter is happy with the earrings
5.0,"bought this for my husband, he loves it. good quality made product."
5.0,I love the style and very strong glasses
5.0,"Love the design of this pocket watch, so glad that I added it to my collection."
5.0,Polarizadas y cómodas.
5.0,Love the fit love the color and it arrived quickly. Very flattering WordPerfect for Alaskan fall.I was worried about the sizing but was so happily surprised at well it fits.
5.0,"I was replacing the same amulet that I  had worn for a number of years that was literally wearing down. But BEWARE these amulets are struck. Some brands have nice, clear and clean strikes. The particular one I got from Creative Ventures had a shallow strike on one side. Poor quality control. I should have returned it for exchange.<br /><br />Issues aside, this is one of the best medieval, or mystical style, amulets. Its symbols and notations are purposeful, simple and not hokey.<br /><br />I am not a New Ager and just like it for its mystery and ancient character. People often ask about it."
5.0,"Materials felt good, quality for price point exceeded expectation.  I felt so sophisticated when I wore it to work!  Thank you."
5.0,Love this lanyard! I get compliments on it daily and it works perfectly for keys and badge!
5.0,"Seems well made for the price.  Cute dress, fits great"
5.0,"Looks great, comfortable and just like the picture-good quality, it’s not thin or see through, I’ve had it at least a month and a half now and it hasn’t shrunk or bled any colors in the wash and dryer"
5.0,Great quality and very soft. My girls love them!
5.0,"Excellent fabric and very strong...this pencil case has the perfect size, fits perfect in any backpack!! I Definitely recommend this item!!! It is super washable"
5.0,It really wasn't a jean material but brushed denim......that's ok but should have mentioned it in the ad.
5.0,Wife likes them. Fits hot!
5.0,"So glad to have this Yoga pants for my yoga class in the college.I have used it for several times in the class and it feels flexible,comfortable and breathable.and definitely I would like to recommend it to whoever loves Yoga."
5.0,Prompt shipping.  Good fit (I have a large head) and does the job.
5.0,"I have snake bites and a job interview for guest services, the two don't mix...so I tired the retainers with rubber stoppers and they just popped right out. So far these are staying in and staying secure. The ends are small and very discrete. They are hardly noticeable. I'm very happy with these. The retainers with rubber stoppers just don't stay in on me."
5.0,"awesome shirt, came in on time and the right size. glad i got this for a steal of a price."
5.0,"I am pregnant and bought this as a maternity dress, it fit perfectly! I got one size larger than my usual size before pregnancy. Loved that it had a bit of stretch too, very comfortable."
5.0,"I have two of these and I love them! I normally wear a l/xl and I bought xl because I don’t like tight clothing! It actually has somewhat of a flow on me but I like to tie a little knot in the front anyway, so it’s perfect! That way it’s not baggy but also not snug. They are super comfy!"
5.0,Love this dress. So easy to dress up or down. Very thick fabric so more of a winter dress. Love the pockets! I want one in every color!
5.0,Very soft. Well made. Will be buying more.
5.0,Super soft and fit perfect! Love it!
5.0,"Loved it! Looked great with my outfit. Quality material, didn't look cheap, I would buy other colors!"
5.0,Looks great but I wouldnt call this teal.  More of a light mist green.  Fits very well and my wife loves the front pockets!
5.0,"Beautiful belt.<br /><br />Rhinestones Accent Butterfly Hook Buckle Black Elastic Cinch Waist Belt<br /><br />I ordered this Rhinestones Accent Butterfly Hook Buckle Black Elastic Cinch Waist Belt to  go with a dress for my daughters graduation. This is a very beautify rhinestone butterfly belt. I like the that belt part is made form elastic that allows it to stretch to fit many sized waists. The belt hooks together at the middle of the butterfly, you don't even notice it, it looks like the entire butterfly is one piece. the stitching that secures the 2 half's of the butterfly to the belt is perfect.

5.0,got lots of compliments the fabric is soft
5.0,Great looking socks that go with any outfit.
5.0,Got this a week ago and so far loving the product! Can’t wait to enjoy the summers in the cool shade. The size is pretty big and easily fits my 2 love seat plus 2 individual seats. Thumbs up!👍🏼
5.0,I love this dress!!!! Fit is amazing! It’s comfortable and it’s easy to breastfeed in.
5.0,I really like this product. I have carpal tunnel and it has helped with it. I am so surprised by that benefit even though it doesn’t list it as one. I would buy this product again
5.0,These are super cute and fashionable. Seem sturdy. Comfortable on the face.
5.0,"We bought 2 for our twin 9 year olds and I can't say how much we love these! Our girls are very tall and a large with room for growth. These are modest and classy, they love these, I need to order more."
5.0,"Love the color. I have other Roman Glass pieces and the earrings complement them very well. These are larger than another pair I have and show better. They were a bit tricky to put on at first with three-prong backing, but it is getting easier with practice."
5.0,"Love these sunglasses! I really love that it comes with a solid case to store them! I use them when wearing my contacts as well, the only issue with that is they can sometimes leave a mark on my face... but that is true of most of these kind of sunglasses meant to be worn over your prescription glasses."
5.0,"Love this hat.  Light weight, good fit, packable."
5.0,my daughter loved her tail. I would highly recommend it!
5.0,Awesome price.Many compliments! Love the Navy color.
5.0,"Perfect fit and length. I'm 5'5&#34;, 150 lbs, 38DD and it's perfect. My go to dress when I don't know what to wear or just want to be comfy. It isn't see through at all but not heavy that it hangs on you. Buy it, I already ordered the red, too!"
5.0,these were a gift.  Very cute
5.0,LOVE this and packaging was very pretty.
5.0,"Love the feminine cut and style of this dress! The red/burgundy color was festive and perfect for the winter holidays and felt fairly warm. It hugged my curves nicely and the v-neck style was wide enough for me to also pull down the neckline and make it into an off-shoulder dress whenever I wanted too! I also bought one in black. Sizing is normal and there is some stretch to this, which is a pullover dress (no zippers or pockets)."
5.0,"The length is perfect for my husband who wears a medium.  He is 5'11"" and a large would be too big.<br />I washed it first and used bounce in the dryer and that made it softer to sleep in."
5.0,"Adorable, dainty, and unique."
5.0,A hit with my grandson!  FIts true to size and is of beautiful quality!  Highly recommend for a Mickey Mouse fan!!
5.0,Sexy yet covering.
5.0,So soft and lovely
5.0,"Fit is a little large, room for thick socks. No arch support, but considering they are loose fitting, there is room for inserts. After walking for a bit, there is quite a bit of discomfort in the front of ankle where the boot should give for the foot to bend but it is too stiff. There is a zipper on inside and outside of boot, but I think outside zipper is mainly for decoration, I didn’t want to force it. Otherwise, very happy with the look and feel."
5.0,I love this necklace! I have worn it several times and always get compliments on it. I feel it is very well made and a good purchase.
5.0,Got for Halloween and so glad I did because my new Xmas everyday cover all.
5.0,Came before expected and packaged well. It's so cute and looks perfect on the bracelet.  Happy with the purchase.
5.0,Perfect for spare or passenger use on motorcycle. I Bought more than one pair as they're well worth the price.
5.0,This &#34;Night Vision Infantry Special Force Mens' Wristwatch&#34; looks and feels like a pricey watch. The facia is easy to read and the watch has weight/solid mass for the money. The leather wrist band is very comfortable and it closes for a snug fit. The watch is easy to set and calibrate.<br /><br />The back of the watch states that it is a stainless steel back case.There are 4 screws in the front so that the jeweler can access the inner workings of the watch in order to change the battery or perform an adjustment. The watch comes with a 1 year guarantee from the original purchase date for all manufacturing defects. The website is { www dot infantryco dot com }<br /><br />This reviewer asked for and received a free sample for evaluative purposes and to make an honest appraisal. The watch works well based upon my continued use.
5.0,"These are just a smidgeon tight, but they work wonderfully. I think the price might be a little high, but I understand it is a sellers market and profit needs to be made. Thank you."
5.0,"Good size, fits right."
5.0,They're the best glasses ever and I have several of them that I've actually put prescriptions in. Awesome company
5.0,They were great for halloween
5.0,"I've been running for the past 5 years, sticking to the Brooks line.  The Pureflow is my favorite shoe as it is light but gives you enough cushion for protection.  Good for fast runs and tend to just wear this shoe for track practice.  For heavier impact and wear/tear when doing trail runs or running on the pavement, I switch out to other shoes.  However, this has been sufficient for me even for marathons.  Will continue to buy Pureflows and glad they made changes to the style such as changing the lacing pattern where the tongue stays in place."
5.0,Beautiful earrings. I recommend them 100 percent.
5.0,Perfect! Bottoms fit a little smaller than size chart says so I’d go up a size. Didn’t get burnt at the beach while wearing this all day with no sunblock on my top half! (Which is a miracle with my complexion! 🤣)
5.0,Great product! Stiching is great.
5.0,"Wearing it right now! Love, love it!"
5.0,Soft and light weight and my favorite sheet shirt so far
5.0,"Sleek style, light weight and stylish"
5.0,"Since my husband doesn't cook he does the dishes! Needed extra large gloves for him, & these work great. Thick material & dishes don't slip when washing by hand."
5.0,"This kit is pretty good for the price. The glasses don’t have lenses which would be great for kids who don’t usually wear glasses. The suspenders have these little snap buttons to adjust them, I’m not a huge fan of that because they look cheap compared to the regular ones with the metal clips. The bow and hat are pretty decent. I only wish the hat was sewn with the different colors to make it look better (it’s just one solid piece of fabric with the orange and blue printed on it) this kit would be great for play but if you want to get really serious into an exact Blippi costume I would buy each piece individually and get a better quality. Otherwise this is perfect for kids to play dress up on their own!"
5.0,I like this mask because I can breathe in it. It is far more comfortable then one that hooks behind the ears. A plus is my glasses do not steam up!
5.0,Cute socks! Fit good and granddaughter loved them!
5.0,"Great shoes. Usually wear a size 11, ordered 11, fits great. Comfortable and semi-stylish."
5.0,My favorite mask. It’s adjustable and gives you room to breathe.
5.0,"While I can't say the ladies are lining up to my door, I can still sit on my couch with a nice mosaic-hopped IPA and play some Activision games on my original heavy sixer in proper style.  If you question if these socks are for you, they are not for you. They are for people like me."
5.0,"These earrings came packaged so sweetly I couldn't resist. My daughter asked for Tea for Christmas this year, and jewelry. Thought the earrings were a good choice with 6 different color Swarovski crystal pairs, but the packaging actually sold me on this set. The Tea gift will be accompanied by the sweetest French Macaroons and when she sees them she will smile from ear to ear. She is a big fan of them in the bakery, so I might have to pick up some edible ones to complete the gift. The earrings look good, colors of the stones are all very clear and pretty. The only complaint might be the color choices of the macaroon packaging when getting the 6 pair set, two macaroons were the same light green color (earrings inside were different), would have loved the bright colored options that came when purchasing individual pairs, but that is a small complaint, still super cute."
5.0,Very good I love it
5.0,So Chic and beautiful!!
5.0,Love the color! Very confortable!

5.0,"I got this to wear while walking my dog in the dark. I had a headlamp, but needed something to light up the back of me. This is perfect and has worked for over a month plus it charges quickly!"
5.0,"As a swim coach, I spend hours on concrete--these are the best by far for comfort.  They are pricey but worth it."
5.0,"I got this ring 2 days ago.  I've paid much much more for other rings and would've lost a stone within 48 hours.  This ring has already out lasted many other rings.  I feel I got my moneys worth as it is.  Very good price, very beautiful ring.  I've ordered at least 6 rings off of amazon, and I would purchase here before I go to a jewelry store.  I bought a wedding set for $10,000 at a jewelry store,  after I bought it they sent if off to be sized and have all the stones checked to make sure everything was tight.  We picked it up a week later and within 48 hours we had already lost a stone.  I've never had a problem from any ring purchased through amazon."
5.0,Look so cute on my little toddler.
5.0,"Absolutely love this dress. Every single time I wear it, I get so many compliments on it from everyone! 🥰 A great fit also! Material could be a little better as I'm getting some little cotton ball things on it from wear but a fabric shaver should help with that. Other than that ZERO complaints."
5.0,I bought this as a gift to a lifelong German shepherd owner and devotee of the Godfather movies. It was very well received.

I paired it with a photo keychain I ordered from another website. It is high quality and just beautiful. The charms are well secured and of high quality. This item was worth every penny. He treasures this wonderful gift.

5.0,I love this jumpsuit! I ordered a small and fits so well even for my 20 week bump. I love the color and the material is nice as well. I received many compliments wearing this. The price is very affordable as well.<br /><br />I will say the front snap button thread was very loose. I ended up stitching it to make sure the button wouldn’t fall off. I highly recommend this jumpsuit. Which is why I’m still giving it 5 stars. I’m very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />Ps. The sparkly silver sandals I’m wearing were also an amazon purchase and they are my favorite!!
5.0,Oh I love this shirt. Good quality. breaths well. Not to heavy. Not to light.

5.0,small.. but good for day parties when you want to carry one-five cards dont expect this to take the place of your everyday wallet...
5.0,I ordered a couple different styles of this band and was not disappointed.  The beads are very colorful and it seems like it will hold up well. It is a little big on my wrist so I did twist it to make it fit a little better.

5.0,"This dress is perfect! A little long but perfect, love it has pockets.."

5.0,"Wanted something that was cute as well as warm and this was perfect. Color is as shown. The hood is big enough to actually put it up and have it cover your head, I have longer arms and the length is perfect, length of the sweatshirt is good as well, not too short. Very soft. Only downfall id say is the inside leaves a lot of lint on your shirt underneath but hoping after the first or second wash that should stop."
5.0,It is light weight but not see through at all. A perfect little dress for southern summer days
5.0,It's way more beautiful than the picture.
5.0,"This is as attractive in person as it is in the photo, and as you can see, there are numerous multi-sized compartments. It's big enough for a laptop or use it as an overnight or carry on bag (if you pack really light). Looks professional enough to use to commute to a city office. The price is reasonable for the quality---it looks and feels expensive. I never know what to buy my nephews as gifts, and this is not only practical but it also acknowledges that they are moving into a new phase of independence as young professionals. Highly recommend."
5.0,This is a cute suit and fits as you would expect the size to fit.
5.0,I love them I will be ordering more
5.0,my husband loves this band and is very easy to size to yourself.

5.0,I love this pants.
5.0,"I recently was hired as a school crossing guard and found that it was time to order some warm socks.  These are a very good buy.  They are big ( I thought I was ordering a woman's size).

5.0,Beautiful warm and like mittens.  Have always worn gloves.
5.0,"Loved the ring. However it was too big. I tried going with a ring sizing guide and because it is a wider ring I went up a half size, to a 10.  Now unfortunately I need to return it. Still not sure what my size is."

5.0,Nice brilliant color makes it easy to spot your luggage on the carousel in baggage claim. Easy to put on with the strong wire clasp.

5.0,"These are completely identical to the ones at the hospital. They're thick, soft, and very comfortable. I will repurchase."
5.0,"Perfect! Super cheap but same stainless, clean quality as a shop. Worn it for few weeks now, hasn't bent which was common with my previous ones (when i accidently bite them), very clean, doesn't loosen. And I'm still only on my first one! So I have plenty of spares!<br /><br />Can't say enough good things. Affordable SAFE piercing jewelry is hard to find, but these really hit the mark."
5.0,Got very nicely. Wish they were a little tighter around the shen area but it’s all good. No complaints.
5.0,Love this dress! Super comfy for summer. Well made!
5.0,This dress fits great.  I purchased a small and wear a size 4 petite.  I would say it may fit a size 6 but is comfortable.  The dress is nice enough to wear to work or church.<br /><br />Prompt delivery and fulfillment.

5.0,Fits just like my Harbor Bay - but a better price
5.0,Unicorn robe with matching robe for granddaughter.  I am sure its going to one of her favorite Christmas gifts.  Its soooooo soft and colorful.
5.0,"4 months later then they would have lasted for a year and I use them almost daily. While I do take care of them, these are definitely good quality. Do note that they don't absolutely block the sun (like pitch black indoor) on super sunny days but my eyes hurt less frequently thanks to them."
5.0,These boots are amazing! I wore them to a concert and had several compliments.
5.0,"I am very pleased with the quality, fit and look of this dress.  It is constructed well with nicely finished lining.  The color is beautiful and easy care is a plus.  We bought it for a high school dance for our daughter and she loves it.  She is 5'8&#34; and needs 3&#34; heels to keep it off the ground, so it is long enough for tall girls."
5.0,"They run small, so I wear them under another shirt at work to keep me warm"
5.0,"I bought this as a gift, they loved it. It’s very vibrant and feels soft."
5.0,"I ordered a 2-pk for my 5 and 2.5 year olds. Within 48 hours of receiving them, my son, 5, dropped his on the floor and stomped on them (accidentally, but not gently.) They were completely unharmed. On top of that, both of my kids seem comfortable and happy wearing them. Very happy with my purchase.<br />Update: My kids have used and abused these consistently all summer, and they have still not broken. My son's make a squeaking noise when you open and close them, which is annoying when he plays with them, but they still seem sturdy. They have paid for themselves several times over with their complete unwillingness to break, despite the best efforts of my very rough kids."
5.0,A great addition for my 9yr son's mask. It helps when he takes it off like when eating out. He doesn't put the mask down and forget it or it drops on the floor. Great idea.
5.0,"The same earrings are selling for $30 in a local boutique. They are pretty heavy, but they are a large earring so that is expected. Love a good statement earring!!"
5.0,Fast and Perfect
5.0,These are perfect! Great to size up to.
5.0,"This was a great winter party dress!<br />I wore a t shirt bra and Spanx underneath since it's body hugging above the hips, and it splays out beneath.<br />The attached sash was a little too long and over the top though."
5.0,These have been perfect for my children.  We attach them to a new mask each day for school and I love that they are adjustable!  We are able to adjust the length so they fit each of my children perfectly.  I like that I don’t need to worry about them losing their mask or setting it down on a potentially dirty surface.
5.0,I received many compliments when wearing this dress.
5.0,fits great and i like it
5.0,"This has held up much better than the more expensive one we’ve purchased. The lunch bag doesn’t seal. It folds and secures with velcro, but hasn’t been an issue. Zippers, straps, handle, and mess are showing no wear."
5.0,These are very well made and were worn by kids from 2 to 10!
5.0,I love this necklace so much. Always get a ton of compliments on it when I wear it. Great product and worth the money.

5.0,"Comfortable!! A tiny bit snug around chest, but stretch without pattern distortion makes it very wearable. Feels like this runs one size smaller than the same brand’s tee shirts. I love this tunic/dress!!"
5.0,"These are great bathing suits for the price. They fit my daughter perfectly, size was very accurate. They are cute, light weight, and durable. I would highly recommend. We like to have extras laying around the house for summer fun! I would re order next year as well."

5.0,They are super cute on my 2 year old.
5.0,Love these measuring cups. They are a nice weight and easy to clean. Love how they look too!
5.0,"They are a little big but they are made well enough that they fit, and he will be able to use them as his feet get bigger. Only complaint is that he keeps losing one of them and I can't ever find a matching pair lol!"
5.0,Absolutely stunning! Wore this on my wedding day along with the earringsand necklace and got so many compliments!
5.0,"Size 10-12 fits my 8 year old son great, a tish large but that's how we wanted it. Light weight but warm. Fuzzy and soft inside as well."
5.0,The perfect size.......
5.0,I use them to exercise and they have a good amount of support. Very good for the price
5.0,For the last two months I've continuously broke lanyards accidently slamming them in my car door. Antidotal at best I know but its still kicking 10/10 would get again.
5.0,Great for the price! I don't think it will last long but then again it was only $9!
5.0,"This is a wonderful, stylish, loose-fitting coat/sweater for fall and other in between seasons. I really love this, wasn't sure how the One-size fits all&#34; thing was going to work. I usually take a L and this fit just fine. Wear it over knit top with great jewelry and snug leggings below."
5.0,My son likes the spectacles.
5.0,Great little stick on earrings and the girls love them!
5.0,I bought this as a gift for my sister! It took a while to get here but it did arrive around their estimated time! She absolutely LOVES it! She plans all her outfits around it now and gets tons of compliments on it! It says gothic but it doesn't really look gothic! It is beautiful! It looks even better in person and is much better quality than I was expecting for such a low price!
5.0,Perfect for display
5.0,this is such a simple bracelet you can mix and match with ease and it is very strong

5.0,No issues with them on.
5.0,"I've only worn the lavender one so far, but they all three look just as pictured, and at least the one I wore fits great. The material is kind of thin, but it's comfortable."
5.0,The color matches what my screen showed. Impressed with the quality for mail order. Wonderful fit and nice price!  Very pretty.
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet!  I don't know if i missed it in the description or not but it is one long bracelet you wrap around your wrist.  Fits my wrist well,  colors compliment each other!"
5.0,They aren't the most comfortable shoes if you are going to be on your feet all day but they are super cute.

5.0,"There's nothing about this set of cartilage earrings that I don't like! This has become my New favorite.  It doesn't irritate my ears or discolor like some supposed steel jewelry.  I changed it out to a cuff.  That crap was not a good thing and 24hrs later, the papering was  put right back in.  I would recommend this product and seller to anyone and wouldn't hesitate to shop this seller again!"

5.0,Just what I wanted and at a good price
5.0,"I haven’t worn this out in the snow yet, but I am stoked about the quality and fit of this jacket.  So many pockets in thoughtful places and it fits well with room, but doesn’t look bulky.  I love the top Velcro flap so you can zip it to the base of your neck or all the way up for those super cold days.<br /><br />The pants are great too, a little short for my super tall frame, but they hit all the way to my heels,  just ride up a bit when my legs are bent.<br /><br />Overall really happy with my purchase ans excited to wear it out on my snowmobile!"
5.0,Bought this for my little buddy. He loved it!
5.0,Makes me look good...very wearable with most anything except swim suit.

5.0,Haven’t turned green or any color. I wear them all the time. Recommended
5.0,Really pretty shirt. Design on the back of the flowers is really elegant. My daughter loves it!
5.0,Smaller than I thought it was but it's really adorable
5.0,The material is stretchy and super comfortable. For a size XS I wish it was a little tighter but not a big deal. I got so many compliments on how nice the dress was. I also love that the chest part isn’t revealing and at the shoulders it covers perfectly that I was able to wear undergarments without the straps showing.
5.0,"Great color, not to light, not to dark of a yellow"
5.0,Great dress and very flattering!
5.0,"Arrived quickly, lots of compliments when I wear this."

5.0,So cute and get slot of compliments on it
5.0,Love the design a great look
5.0,"These boots are super sexy. I love them. My only complaint is that the lacing comes off of the front clasps a lot of the time when I try to put them on, but that's kind of hard to prevent from a manufacturing perspective, so I can't knock a star off for that."
5.0,"Pros: very comfortable, soft. Fits great. Well made. Great value<br />Cons: none"
5.0,"I ride a recumbent bike, so don't need padded shorts any more. I really like these shorts. The only negative thing is the legs tend to catch on my handlebars if I'm not careful. I wish they had Velcro closures on the legs. But otherwise, they are very comfortable, made of good fabric and seem sell made. Lots of roomy pockets all with zippers, so none of my stuff gets lost."
5.0,"Bought the floral gray...so pretty. The small was a bit too large on me so I washed it in hot water and dried on high, now it’s perfect!"
5.0,I bought these as a gift and my wife loves them!
5.0,Great quality glasses! Dark lenses and think frame. Fear case too
5.0,Very nice<br />Fits well
5.0,I liked the comfortable feel
5.0,"I ordered the handmade stainless steel cross pendant for my husband and was not really sure if the color would be to over-stated. It arrived before the expected date of delivery but it still did take a couple of weeks to get. It was packaged carefully so it would not get damaged.  I tend to like things understated and I did not want my husband to look like Mr T.  The necklace measures about two inches in height and about one and a quarter inches in with. The blue and sliver are bright but when my husband wears it with a black shirt, it looks very nice and not to flashy. The necklace has good weight and you can tell that it is solid and good quality. I really like the layering of stainless and blue. I think that it is really unique. My husband wears the cross often and get comments of how much people like it from both Christians and non.  It comes with a simple stainless steel chain that is plenty long enough for the way most men would wear it.  The chain can be easily shortened if needed to any length. Overall I was very happy with the purchase and think it would be a great purchase or a gift. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Nice quality velcro. Should hold up over time. I ordered it a little large...just in case. Wastelines aren't forever you know. Super easy to adjust and not bulky if you over lap a little.
5.0,"Absolutely love this dress. I was able to put a fitted white blazer over it for a more formal work environment, and then just took the jacket off to be dressed up for a nice dinner date.<br /><br />The material is comfortable and let me move easily without being so thin as to show lines from things underneath. And I love the detail on the skirt and sleeves. Makes it interesting, unique, and very feminine.  Definitely a win"
5.0,"Very cute and good quality. They have a nice weight to them, and look amazing in person."
5.0,Exactly like it looks .  Very nice!!!
5.0,So pretty on. My daughter is 95lbs & ordered a regular small. It fit her perfectly. The outfit was perfect for beach photos.
5.0,As expected no issues.
5.0,This is a gorgeous watch!  It is well made and has a quality leather band.  The face is attractive with readable numbers.  The color of this watch is favorably different.  A great purchase.
5.0,"Great colors, soft, but runs on the small side. It came in a bag with all the air sucked out and it looked like it had been like that for quite a while.  I'll need to wash it to fluff it up... oh and by the way it's a dry clean only item!  Wish I had known ... I don't do dry clean items and we don't have a dry cleaners in town =(  Will have to see if they still sell Dryell to get ""dry cleaned"" in my dryer.  The material is soft and a wonderful color, the design is exactly like the picture, but like I said it runs on the small side."
5.0,"This necklace is so pretty! I bought it for my daughter for her birthday. It actually is her birthstone, so that is a plus! It was not presented nicely in the box and was actually a bit tangled. I attribute that to the shipping process, though. After I untangled it, I was pretty impressed. I know my little girl is going to love it. I would wear it myself. It is very pretty. I recommend this necklace.<br />I received this pretty necklace at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion. This is a cute necklace and the discount did not affect my review."
5.0,Very beautiful. Fits loosely but is perfect. Light weight but perfect for summer! Covers you nicely.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion.
5.0,Easy to hold works great.
5.0,I honestly like these especially for the price they are super comfortable and perfect to wear for my workouts and i even wear them to bed or to my radiation appointments because they are so comfortable and the radiation makes me sweat really bad so it helps keep the moisture away and my shirt from sticking to me. I think the size medium is a bit big for me but im a hard fit since i gain and lose so much weight.  they are really made well  and i definitely would order them again. I haven't washed them very much yet since i just got them but i hand washed them and i laid them flat to dry so they wouldn't get ruined so quickly
5.0,"Beautiful scarf.  Beautiful colors. I had purchased another ""silk"" scarf from another vendor on Amazon at a higher price and now regret it (I suspect the other one may have been polyester).  I should have gotten another one of these.  Pretty satisfied with my purchase.  Also, the tag suggests hand washing is fine, which will save the trouble of dry-cleaning."
5.0,Comfortable.  Works in my boots and tennis shoes.  Using this to level up my legs while recovering from a broken leg.  Exactly what I needed.
5.0,Can't beat them for the price.  Exactly as described and expected.
5.0,I really like the feel my key to the G37x looks awesome now
5.0,Beautiful and perfect darkness
5.0,"I am new to compression socks and I was surprised to get 6 pairs for such a good price, and delighted to find that they fit me perfectly. I just liked how they hugged my legs without being too tight."
5.0,My daughter absolutely love it!!!!!
5.0,Want more in all colors. Nice quality
5.0,The pens write beautifully!
5.0,I always get compliments on this bag. Love it so much.
5.0,"I love getting things in twos! Why you ask? Because when I get something my hubby usually wants one too haha and then I have to go order another or I find an awesome deal with two of something then we’re both set! That’s just one of the perks of the EyeSnug Contoured Sleep Masks!<br /><br />The EyeSnug is super light weight and the band fits nicely on your head, it’s not heavy or uncomfortable in the slightest bit. I thought the shape of these looked interesting, it turns out the design had some thought behind it. The contoured 3D design allows for uninterrupted rapid eye movement (REM) for the deepest sleep possible. I never even thought about my eyes having to move around during sleep till now! These sleep masks also come with two sets of ear plugs. The combination puts you in an awesome uninterrupted sleep! They also both come with a little pouch to carry each set in or in our case to put them in so that our kids do not get a hold of them in the morning.<br /><br />Hubby and I have both used these for naps, sleep or in my case sometimes during a migraine headache. It blocks out all light and I haven’t had any issues with it coming off during the night! I’ve also not had any issues with these messing with my under eye cream I use at night, there’s enough of a little space between my eyes and the mask that it is not an issue!<br /><br />**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**"
5.0,Fits great and the material looks fine.
5.0,Liviano. Se ajusta muy bien. Fácil de limpiar.
5.0,"I’m so in love with this bag. I’m a big girl so I wish the straps were longer. I wanted it to reach my hip when I wear it as a cross body bag but maybe when I lose the stomach. Lol The straps are long tho. The quality is beautiful, it looks excellent. I got about 20 complement in a hour. Love it!!"
5.0,"I originally saw packing cubes just like this at The Container Store, just 3x the price. I literally stood there for about 15 minutes debating whether or not I wanted to spend the money. I travel monthly so it was worth a try...I checked Amazon while standing in the aisle and found these, much cheaper. They feel just as lightweight and the best I can tell, it’s ripstop material.  The sizes look small, kind of, but if you’re ranger rolling your shirts and pants, they will have no problem fitting."
5.0,Having fun with this item! SO many great projects you can use these for. Definitely will buy again for my next wine tasting party!
5.0,Nice product. Good quality! 👍🏾
5.0,Adorable scarf and great for the money!  I bought one for my mom too.  I get so many compliments when I wear it.  It’s a thinner material so I can wear it spring and summer when I need a wrap on chillier days.  Colors and style is exactly like the picture.
5.0,"It is unique, and just the perfect size for a guy. It weighs around 6g. I think its perfect on a 3mm silk or fake silk cord."
5.0,"this is a great bathing suite, still wearing after 2 seasons! Great value"
5.0,great  hat love it
5.0,Very good quality runs a little big.
5.0,It’s as described. Just make sure when washing you have it on delicate and you hang dry. Love my shirt.
5.0,Very comfortable and washes well!
5.0,Great addition to my daughter's Halloween costume.  Loved the color and added &#34;rhinestones&#34;.
5.0,"Bought as a birthday gift for my oldest daughter and she loves the set!! She has even been asking to get her ears pierced so she can wear the softball earrings. The headband and hair ties stays in her hair, even when she's sweating and running around during softball practice. The necklace is a heavy braided rope, just like what all the boys wear when they are supporting a baseball team. Great set and absolutely adored by a 12 year old!"
5.0,I just got this and so far so good. The material is a little bit thin. I do like the buttons on the sides because my ears hurt wearing those masks. It has an elastic on the back of it to tighten and a sweatband in the front. I like the design also
5.0,Been amazing for my small business so far! Shipping was fast too.
5.0,Litte too big for my wrist. But nice and heavy watch. Very beautiful.
5.0,Great dress.  Bought it for a wedding.
5.0,"My husband decided, one day recently, that he would like to start wearing rings on his right ring-finger.  I bought several of these, all in different sizes so that we could determine what sized ring would feel best on him.  I wasn’t looking for a permanent ring for him to wear, especially with the writing that comes on them.<br /><br />I also ordered one of the ones for women, a size 7, but it was too snug for my finger.  A size 8 fit me better.  I would not wear the ring, however, because of it saying, “His Crazy.”  It’s one thing for a man to wear a ring that identifies him as “Her Weirdo,” but it doesn’t hit me well that women are to wear ones which describe them as crazy.  I would be fine with being my husband’s Weirdo, but never his Crazy wife.  Women’s realities are too often viewed as abnormal because men’s realities are given more credibility already by society, with women’s realities seen more as irrational.  Weirdneses are more eccentricities; crazy is definable by categories in psychiatrists’ diagnostic manuals.  So, for women, I nix the ring.<br /><br />Yesterday, my replacement ring for my husband arrived, also from Amazon, and it was from trying to find his correct size and comfort level through these inexpensive rugs that he received the correct size of a ring that was more expensive and was intended to be a ring that he could wear all the time, as he sees it — not being aware that I intend to buy him several more rings so that he has a variety to choose from.<br /><br />My husband loves this little ring, however, and wore it on his right hand 24/7 before yesterday’s ring arrived.  At 78, he remains a man of great vitality and is in his 50th year of teaching.  What was so interesting, however, was the great number of compliments he received on it.  This ring being the first ring he had ever worn on his right hand drew attention to itself simply by that fact.  It went farther than that, though.  Several of his male students outright admired it for the beauty of its color —the richness of the blue, and others had somehow noticed from their seats that there was writing on it and came up to him after class to ask him what it said.  When they would learn its words, both the students and my husband would join in with hearty laughs!  I would say, overall, that this probably would appeal most to men much younger than my husband or to other older men kept young at heart by daily close contacts with young people.  (By the way, it does look more expensive than what it costs.)<br /><br />I know there are cheaper ways to determine ring size than the way we went about it, but we had great fun and I have no doubt that I will see this ring on my husband’s finger again."
5.0,"Comfortable, breathable, and stay up well, with no irritating bunching or bothersome seams. These socks are not overly thick, but they fit just right for most uses and so far, have laundered well. I would recommend them to friends."
5.0,"Hits a lot of boxes; cheap, durable, simple, and useful. Helps me keep track of the time/day/month at work or when I can't be bothered to pull out my phone. So far it's lasted a few nights when I have to wash dishes with hot water and hasn't started acting up yet, but I'd still be careful with how long you expose it to water. The color options are so nice I've actually ended up with 3 of these watches, out of appreciation as opposed to replacement."
5.0,"I am really impressed.  The frames are actually metal.  They look great, they're comfy.  The only thing I have to note just as an FYI is that they aren't a solid mirror (see picture).  But they're great!"
5.0,These are amazing! Perfect for hiding my stretched ears for work.
5.0,Excellent quality and very soft and comfortable.
5.0,"This pendant is absolutely amazing. It is beautiful and the perfect size. It’s actually bigger then I expected so it was a great surprise. If you are considering buying this, all I can say is DO IT! You will be so happy."
5.0,Great fit and style. Eases eye strain on the computer but can also make a fashion statement!
5.0,"Very lovely, I received a lot of compliments on them."
5.0,I bought this for my brother in law and he absolutely loves it! It's not like other Luffy hats where it's a bright yellow straw hat. This one is just great and fits perfectly for an adult.
5.0,My wife loves them. They haven't discolored at all and she's bathed with them many times
5.0,Definition of classy!
5.0,These are fantastic! The fit on them is great. The pockets are amazing and fit my s5 perfectly. These pants are very well crafted and have held up great so far! Definitely a great purchase!
5.0,Very pretty lightweight cardigan
5.0,Everybody loves a solid piece of pipe! Highly recommended for all the Clue cosplayers out there.
5.0,"Great swimsuit!  I ordered a size 18, I am generally a size 18/20, 5'8&#34;, 40I and I love how this suit fits. I'm more apple shaped so I don't have lots of hip, but this compliments my figure tremendously! Also got it in red and love it! !"
5.0,Love this little purse. Is very comfortable under my arm.
5.0,Very nice fit well love the bright colors
5.0,"Ordered 2y to 3y size 85 for my 3 year old cause she's petite but its a little loose in the top and bottom. I pulled it down a bit against her shoulders so the top fit better and this made it more loose in the bottom. Not bad though cause the skirt it comes with covers the bottom and maybe will fit next year. It's durable material, not thin at all. The strap started to unravel after the first use/wash and the seller replaced the leotard right off and I had it before the weekend. Very pleased with customer service. UPDATE: the replacement leotard strap after a few gentle washes in a sweater bag and hung to dry unraveled as well. Quality material but the stitching on the straps doesn't seem strong."
5.0,"This charm is ADORABLE.  It is quite small, so don't let the pic fool you.  I love the color too!"
5.0,Cute and comfortable. Stretch waist. Fit as expected.
5.0,Very very good.  I like it!!!
5.0,"Wore this to a Women’s Day event and received a lot of compliments. Loved the cute little bag it came in, it made me feel like had purchased myself a real gift."
5.0,Received as a gift and love the detail of the plumeria on the shell. Very pretty!
5.0,Great product. Beautiful and durable!
5.0,Very happy with my order&#34;
5.0,"I liked the adjustable straps. I'm 5'4"" 180 Lbs. I bought the XL. I could have gone a size smaller. It's a bit long even after adjusting the straps. It's very flowing and loose. I did not wear a bra with it and it felt fine. 38D The material is soft. I purchased the black and white polka dot. I will purchase again in the smaller size."
5.0,"A beautiful, go-to belt. I wear it every day, and have for months.<br /><br />Somewhat darker than the picture, but definitely real leather, with a nice feel and nice buckle."
5.0,Very cute design and great workmanship. Got lots of compliments from people.
5.0,feels great and fits as expected. I am 6'6'' tall and it is still long enough at arms and waist.<br />No smelling on this trip!^^
5.0,I was supposed to give these to my niece but I got covid and couldn’t travel... They are strangely therapeutic for a holiday ALONE
5.0,"The Newborn Baby Infant Girls Bow Tie Crochet Knit Socks Crib Shoes Prewalker 3-12 Months in Pink are just adorable. Very fancy looking and matchs up with any outfit to take the outfit from plain to very sophisticated. Any little baby girl would look so sweet in these awesome shoes.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount to allow me to test it, and then write a review based on the results of my experience using this product.

5.0,Loved the way it fit so much!
5.0,Description of product is on point. True to color. True to size. Very happy with product would recommend to others and or order more of the product from this seller
5.0,"Love this bag!!  The color is a great purple and the embellishments add such a nice touch!  It's a big bag though, so I think it'd be best for teen dancers.  My 10 year old is in 4 dance classes and it still looked too big for her."
5.0,"I wore these for my wedding and they are beautiful. I had no issue with them arriving broken since they were well packaged in their own beautiful Tiffany color box and velvet pouch. The earrings themselves were sparkling and heavy weighted, they don't feel cheap at all!"
5.0,quality workmanship==very sharp---fast shipping----100% satisfaction.
5.0,It's tight at the neck but so darn cute I live with it. Didn't choke me. Got lots of compliments at the beach very happy with it. Hides the stuff we older ladies wish to hide. ;0)
5.0,these glitter head bands are cute and perfect for any sport. they fit just right and they aren't cheap like i thought they would be with glitter falling off everywhere and stuff. they are great and i highly recommend them to you girls out there playing sports or just wanting them to accessorise and look cute!
5.0,Great Costume!!
5.0,It was a gift but the mama bear I gave it to love it so very much
5.0,"Got these for my wife. She had nothing but good to say about them. Said they did their job 100%, so great product!"
5.0,I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He loves it!  I like to have the windows open and he says he is always cold so this was perfect for us both.  It is super soft and has plenty of room.  It hangs over your feet so it covers everything.  It is open in the back so it is easy to take off and put on.
5.0,Love this wallet! It's perfect!
5.0,The stripe colors on this bathing suit really pop out. The straps are super secure. The bathing suit has nice give with stretching but still stays snug like a suit should.
5.0,"Like the other women on here, short and curvy.  I feel so sexy in it and it was a big hit. Would reccomend for the curvy gal"
5.0,Super cute I just wish it came in a box or package to give as a gift. It was just in a cheap clear bag
5.0,"So cute!! After years of wearing one pieces to hide my body, I wanted a cute and sexy bikini that would still be flattering. I wanted something that would show off my boobs and butt and hide my stomach and it does that pretty well. I'm size 12, 36-32-37, and the XXL fit perfectly. I was worried the horizontal stripes would make me look bigger but I think the suit is actually very flattering, maybe because the red waistband draws the attention to the thinnest part of the waist. The bottom is well fitted and not too tight on the waist and covers well in the back while still showing off my butt a little bit ;). I'm a 36c and the top is a TINY bit big even with the inserts but not so much that it will fall off, just that there's a bit of space. Still, it gives a good lift and the cut of the top shows some cleavage. And the pattern is so cute!"
5.0,"Silky soft, stay up over top of calf, unlike some of their competitors. Cowboy boot wearing husband loves them. Delivered as described and on time. WILL def order again."
5.0,Got medium. 5'3 130. Fits perfect. Very pleased especially for price.
5.0,"I was shopping around for a bag not for myself but for a thank you gift for a friend , and came across this beauty so I purchased it for myself.  It is just as pictured and more.  The leather is firm, which I like, and it's spacious enough to carry all my stuff.  The fixtures are strong and the color is perfect.  I get compliments all the time (still Looking for a bag for my friend)."
5.0,"I'm 5'6"", about 220lbs, 38DDD, curvy build with a small waist. I ordered an XL and it fit like a damn dream.<br /><br />I had been searching for a velvet dress forEVER!! for a nice event I was attending. I was apprehensive about this one because I don't even hang around the house without a bra on. I figured I'd order it and if the bra stuff ended up sketchy, I'd just return it.<br /><br />WELL.<br /><br />By some feat of modern engineering, some company made a bra that, coupled with some skin-tone gaff tape, made it so that my decolletage not only looked amazing, but stayed UP, IN the dang dress, AND I was able to show off my back.<br /><br />I haven't felt this gorgeous since maybe my high school prom. And I'm 33. So that's a long time.<br /><br />This dress is nicely made, the material is a medium weight, not too heavy and not too thin. I have washed and dried it twice and it is fine. It covers up bumps and lumps VERY well. I didn't even feel like I needed a slip or spanx. The slit goes all the way up, but it covers well.<br /><br />The sizing is perfection. The cut and fit of the dress are probably my favorite thing ever. It fits like a damn dream come true.<br /><br />Now, I just need some more events to attend so I can wear this puppy out some more!"
5.0,"Hermosa, se puede usar a cualquier reunión, formal e informal"
5.0,Compression socks suck especially with big calves. These really do solve that problem. I was skeptical because I don’t have a measuring tool for my calf. They were great and I’ll buy it again.
5.0,Just what needed for college showers
5.0,These are amazing! Perhaps cheap material and maybe won’t last a lifetime lol but c’mon there 7 bucks free shipping! I Ordered the black and they fit my face so well.
5.0,"Soft, durable, comfy"
5.0,"These are beautiful! Sturdy ,perfect size"
5.0,Ordered for a gift.... they loved them
5.0,These boots look great!
5.0,"Really strong contour type of fit, really well designed to form and hold the shape of the foot. If your foot is bigger than 11.5 I'd recommend skipping these."
5.0,"Got the rose gold. Super cute. Wish it sat higher up/closer to my nose, but I don’t blame the jewelry. I think that’s just something to with where I got pierced."
5.0,Love it. Bought it for my daughter and she loved it also
5.0,Variety and great price
5.0,Very soft material. Above expectations!
5.0,I ordered an XL thinking I'd need more room but I wish I would've ordered a L or M to get a more fitted look on the top since the bottom is very lose. Looks exactly like the pictures and has stretch to it. LOVE IT!
5.0,I like that it came with a  phone pocket
5.0,My girlfriend loved this beanie.
5.0,"I have been looking for adorable headbands forever! I have thick, curly hair and thin headbands just don't cut it. These stay in place, are comfy and they aren't too tight on my head!"
5.0,"Wasn't sure about this item when I bought it, but now I want one in all the colors. The fleece washes well, and this is the most warm and comfortable pullover I own."
5.0,Loved the shades the fit was perfect 🔥🔥🔥
5.0,"Bought to replace laces 6&#34; longer on running shoes.  These cinch up and tie well, and were not too short.  Good blue color; feels like good quality. Color did not run in the rain (i.e. did not stain white shoe), when I did run in the rain.  Couldn't tell you about the lasting power of the tips, but if you do re-lace/go through holes a lot, I'd find a reviewer who checked that."
5.0,I got this for my boyfriend. He loves it. It is so soft and warm on the inside. It looks great. We both like the style of it. It is a little too big. But still worth what it costs. It is great quality. I would recommend this to friends and family. I will buy again in the future especially if they have female outerwear. I took a pic of him wearing it and of the inside of the hat. I did receive this product at a discounted price just for leaving my honest review.
5.0,These fit well for large-sized individuals.  They hold up well and look good.
5.0,"Silver Forest .. Has the nicest earrings.. They never brake I have some that are over 15 years old.. No Backs , But i stock up on them.. ."
5.0,These are soft and comfortable.
5.0,"Surprisingly clear, good protection from sides and front, not easily fogged up. I wear it with mask on and feel quite comfortable shopping at home stores."
5.0,"Beautiful stone , loved it and looks perfect to snap in the infinity necklace ❤️"
5.0,I bought these necklaces for me and my cousin. Also in remembrance of her dog! 🐕 Dolly. Great gift!!!!!! ❤❤❤
5.0,"Lots of compliments, fit perfect"
5.0,Absolutely stunning.  Looks like real diamonds and it’s exactly what I expected it to be. Highly recommend!
5.0,"After Hours of searching, this was truly the only watchband that came remotely close to the Nixon Re-Run watch face so I took a gamble and the results came out great!<br /><br />The rubber band feels good and I have no question that it won't hold up over time! And the clasp is of good quality as well! I ended up replacing it for one that completely the color scheme of the watch!<br /><br />All in all, this was a great find (technically only find) that would work for what I needed it for!<br /><br />Extremely happy and may purchase more down the road!<br /><br />*P.S. if you do end up following my route and getting this to replace the original band for the Nixon Re-Ren watch, you WILL have to cut it down to size to make it work! So do at own risk! Once you cut it, there was no way I was returning this band as it would void any type of return BUT I was fully committed with the purchase!*"
5.0,I love it...I can wear it high waist and just above my hips and it still looks nice ❤️👍
5.0,These earrings are prettier in person than the pictures show. The price is a steal and they arrived in cute gift boxes much earlier than anticipated. I will be a repeat customer for sure!
5.0,Love these!! They are made well and look great!!
5.0,"The necklace is beautiful, just smaller than I hoped"
5.0,"Nicely made. Metal is plated with real stuff and does not tarnish. I is a long necklace, so for those with short torsos as myself, know it will hang near your navel. I love it. Would definitely buy again."
5.0,"After months of reoccurring UTI's, the doctor said my daughter seemed to be potty trained but was holding her urine too much. On top of that she was constipated.<br /><br />They handed me a piece of paper with expensive watches they recommended.  I did so much reading and just needed a watch i could set to go off ever hour or hour and a half that also vibrated since she is in school.<br /><br />Parents listen up. This watch is SIMPLE. Its fine when it gets wet from hand washing. The vibrate will alert ANY kid but not disturb others, even in class. You can set the alarm to go off whenever you want, say you set it to vibrate after 30 mins, after 30 mins it will vibrate, when the vibrate is complete the watch will AUTOMATICALLY reset the 30 minute timer and AUTOMATICALLY countdown to 30 mins AGAIN! Our doctor has us having her go ever hour and a half so we set it 1 time when we got the watch, and stop the timer at night when she goes to bed, starting it again when she wakes up.<br /><br />The only thing I would change about the watch is at bedtime the watch might have 30 minutes left of the hour and a half right? Well you cant just hit a button to reset it back to the hour and half, you have to manually re-enter the hour and a half. we don't do that though, we just go with it. great watch."
5.0,Soft and comfy. Hunny loves them.
5.0,its hard to see the eyes but still I like it and give it to my granddaughter
5.0,Most comfortable bra I've ever worn. Cups are smooth and don't pucker at all. Good support without being too tight.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. They look better than the pictures.
5.0,I like it a lot and it fits really well and the fabric is soft.
5.0,My nine-year-old is a HUGE I Love Lucy fan so I bought these for her for Easter.  I got the extra small knowing these were going to be big but also knowing she would grow into them and have them for a while.  She just rolls the shorts over a couple times and they fit her perfectly.  These are super soft too.  She wore them to school for pajama day and her teacher loved them so much she ordered herself a pair that day.
5.0,This cardigan is amazing!! It fits me perfectly and is so nice and flows beautifully. I was worried about sizing. Sometimes cardigans will be an awkward length and/or tight around the arms. This fits nicely on the arms with room to layer & the sides are long and the back is a good length. This is my go-to black cardi.
5.0,She loves them/they don’t stay charged for the whole day -she comes from school and plugs them up so she can light up everything
5.0,Somehow I got this bracelet for free.  I gave it away as a gift.  It is her well made.
5.0,Worked fine for where I mounted it.
5.0,"Super comfortable and don’t make your feet too warm, but size up! They run small"
5.0,This headband is very well made and out of the softest material that actually holds really well on the head. Holds my girls hair back perfectly and is very cute.
5.0,"i will order more from this company, great place for big n tall"
5.0,I love how it is very light and perfect for Hot days. Very stylish. Long so you can tuck it in for the perfect look on the gold course. I wear a size medium and it was a little snug but I could still wear now if I wanted to. I purchased this size as I'm trying to lose weight. I am 5'2 153 lbs.
5.0,It's adorable..
5.0,Gift to Grand daughter..she loves it.
5.0,"I used this dress for my baby shower. No matter what size your belly is, this dress will be perfect! I absolutely love this dress. Very comfortable and airy, which is a must for being outside on a warm summer day!"
5.0,Just what I needed to battle 29 degree weather. Kept myegs nice and warm.
5.0,"Love it, got nice compliments"
5.0,Gave to coworkers
5.0,"I have never felt so comfortable with earring backs as I have with these.  There has been no problem with keeping the earring secure. Now I just always need to Keep them in the same place when I take them off, or buy a second pair.  These are great and you will not be disappointed."
5.0,Great quality for the price. These look great with everything.
5.0,I absolutely love this top and so does everyone else when I wear it! Lol it is comfortable and perfect length.. not to short not too long.
5.0,They looked a lot cuter then I thought they would be. My two girls wear them and everyone had nothing but good things to say about it. I would buy them again.

5.0,Just to put on
5.0,I love this dress FYI it fits a 50 inch chest.
5.0,I want yordet again
5.0,"I’ve played for a very long time, almost 20 years. And managed a music shop for a number of them. For the price buy this strap. It’s the only at home/practice strap I’ll buy from now on, and I’ll likely order more now. Most “cheap straps” meaning under 30-40 dollars are of similar quality, thin nylon fabric. This strap is a good, thick, expensive feeling and looking fabric. I would argue that it’s good enough to gig with if you add some strap locks."
5.0,"The shoes ran just a slight bit large but the spacers included to offset that did the trick pretty well.  They shoes themselves are like waking on clouds.  As a type 1 diabetic with a bit of neuropathy, I can say these are the most comfortable in the home slipper I’ve ever put on."
5.0,My little tin man loved his oil can and had a great halloween
5.0,"Good glasses over all. Given the quality and price a WAY better investment than overprice, garbage ray-bans. Still stylish, still look fancy, still have the same function without being a sheep and paying 5 times the amount for a fancy logo."
5.0,I love this blouse. Fit's perfectly @
5.0,I love this! I’ll be wearing it all Fall/Winter! It’s lightweight and stylish and fit as expected.
5.0,Love these colors.<br />They fit perfectly and are hidden on the foot<br />inside of all of my booties.  I would buy these again.
5.0,Great quality. Purchased for xsmall for granddaughter who wears 14/16. Fits great.
5.0,I gave my mother one of the two because she has a hard time looking for words like &#34;sterling&#34; or the carat of the metals on jewelry she looks at. I use mine to look at the edges of knives I sharpen. Great deal for two.
5.0,"A very cute dress! Simple, yet feminine! Got compliments all day long. Fit perfectly and made me feel confident. So happy with my purchase especially for the price!"
5.0,"As soon as I saw it, I knew it was the perfect gift for my friend.  She loves it, wears it often and is planning to get it put onto a gold chain."
5.0,Very comfortable and keeps my hands warm!
5.0,"These little gems are surprisingly beautiful... actually the beads are sparkly like little crystals, doesn't show in the picture that way but they're lovely."
5.0,"Absolutely darling!  Very well made with a zipper along the edge to add for a tad of extra room!  This is able to hold a small 7-8&#34; tablet.  :)<br />Love this grey color which adds a bit of preppiness to this bag!  Thank you, Berchirly!  Love your design!"
5.0,Gorgeous an very warm looks exactly like the picture.
5.0,"Great readers at such an awesome price! Lenses are clear and offer great clarity. The color choices included are really fantastic! Just another accessory - as we all know, for different outfits. Would definitely buy again!"

5.0,"Clipped it to my purse and find it to be strong, well made and cute!"
5.0,Looks good feels good to wear.
5.0,"I was Air Operations Officer of Naval Support Activity Da Nang 1967-68, and dearly wanted a Ballcap to honor that time. When I spotted this hat I knew my search was over. This hat is actually more striking than pictured. The front, above the bill is stiffened and slightly raised to allow room for the Naval Aviator wings and Da Nang in big block letters. This stiffened front allows a slight dip behind, which gives it a kind of “cocky” look. I wear it proudly."
5.0,I LOVE THIS BEAUTIFUL BLOUSE BUT THE COLOUR SEEMS TO FADE.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. Fit my 5 year old perfectly!
5.0,This product works well. I'm so glad I bought it.
5.0,Very nicely made. Works well and looks awesome
5.0,"I just received this, and was so pleased at the material and the way it fit me perfectly!!!!<br />I got a size small.  I am 5'2"", 118lbs.  I hope this helps others trying to decide what size to order.<br />I also got a headband and the face tattoos to complete the outfit.  Now I can't wait to wear it😊"
5.0,Bought these for my 10 year old Granddaughter and she loves them.  Great price for these boots!!  Highly recommend.
5.0,Beautiful color and style. Dress was a bit small but I am keeping it in hopes of losing some weight by Christmas time.
5.0,Very good I like the value
5.0,So far so good. Definitely something for your EDC.
5.0,Perfect for my picky husband! He loved it!!!
5.0,This is an excellent quality and sized bag. The straps make a heavy bag feel light on your shoulders. You can fit a surprising amount of things into it- despite how small and compact it is. Highly recommend.
5.0,Fit as expected. Would order again.
5.0,These are so pretty & do not scrape  anywhere in my mouth. And the price was so cheap!! Would buy again
5.0,Sizing just right - My daughter participated in a parade and she worn it under her dress. She was comfy and warm.
5.0,"These did run just a tiny bit big, but the comfort is spot on. The extra padding is in all the right places. The socks stay put on vigorous hikes. They really help keep my feet dry. I am super picky about caring for my feet. These do the trick!"
5.0,So cute! Fit my 12 month old just right and everyone comments when she wears it.
5.0,True to size . Good quality.
5.0,This top is very flattering and the quality of material is exceptional for the price. I love that this top isn't see through but it's not thick at all so you don't get overly hot. It can be paired with jeans or leggings. I wore it out fishing in 100 degrees and it held up really nicely except the zipper part can get hot and burn but aside from that I love the look and feel of this top. I ordered the blue patterned one and plan to order them all.
5.0,very comfortable not slipping and sliding so far. great for thigh thighs and plussize girls. lots of stretch. beautiful pattern. took a while to get here but totally worth the money.
5.0,It’s suitable
5.0,"By far the best ever item I have purchased on Amazon, just as described.  Gr8. For eyeglass wearer . If u know an . Get these and surorise them with a thoughtful but, inexpensive gift....cheap enough to spread the love around....dont delay get ur 2 pair today!!!!!!!!"

5.0,It’s very easy to read and light weight so it won’t weight your keys down. Very nice!
5.0,"Bought this for my father, he loves the hat, very durable. He likes the fact that he can put his insignia in and the hat holds up.  He had his name ebroidered in the back and its held up nicely."
5.0,"Super soft! The OS fits very nice. I am 5'8"" and a US size 10 - these have length to spare and fit very nicely. Will be buying again!"
5.0,"I have gotten so many compliments when wearing this shirt! The material isn't great, but it is soft and I guess it looks good on!"
5.0,"I am very happy with them, since my son put them on he wanted to wear only them. Very comfortable, recommened."
5.0,"Great gift for that loves to be noticed female in your life. It definitely gets the attention you seek, great quality and service."
5.0,Super soft and cute. My teenager loves these pajamas!

The packaging is lovely comes with a bow and a gift. I will be ordering more from this store very soon ! Thank you Amorstore !
5.0,2 games in and it's holding up great... My daughter loves it ( colors and designs ) it's a good idea to buy a size up as it fits her a little big and I meant just little big........but perfect! No complaints from me.... Just wish they had matching bottoms
5.0,Exactly as pictured. Fit perfectly.
5.0,I purchased this item as a gift. The recipient loved it.
5.0,"SCREEEEEEEAM!!!!!!  Soooooo Niiiiiiiiiiice!  I am very pleasantly surprised!  The picture does not do these earrings justice! OMGOODNESS!! I figured they were decent or I would have not ordered them but I did expect that the lil balls at the end would be a little disappointing...thought they would be glitter overkill - NOT at all.  Yes, they have glitter on them but the glitter is matted down, not shinning from miles away as the glitter sticks to your fingers and gets all over your clothing!!  Yaaaay!These earrings are Beautiful!  They are dainty but are a very nice size dainty. I absolutely LOVE the size! I did not expect them to be so beautiful!!!  As the majority of Amazon's jewelry...once again, price for the quality  - - - - -Amaaaaazing!  Sooooo pleased!  Can't wait to wear them!"
5.0,"The brushed fabric is the softest I've ever felt, and thicker and warmer than I expected. Perfect for cold winter nights. The gown is excellent  quality; photos  in the listing don't do justice to the embroidery detail on the yoke or the attractive colors. I highly recommend this gown!"
5.0,"Cute! Fits perfectly. I'm 5 feet tall, 107 pounds, and I bought a small."
5.0,"Love these earrings, not studs but not dangly. Very nice and classy look for an office environment buying several in different colors."

5.0,Stylish gloves with a neat extra...little pads on the fingertips which enable the wearer to use their cell phone while wearing the gloves.  I bought these as a gift for my sister and she loves them.
5.0,"I got these for my hubby because he kept scratching up his wedding band on the weight bar at Crossfit.  These are perfect because you get a range of sizes, not just 1."
5.0,Super soft super cute!
5.0,The material is very good. Nice price.
5.0,Really great quality lapel pin. Fastener fits tight so it doesn't fall off.
5.0,So far so good.  Lenses seem good and overall quality is good for $$ spent.
5.0,Works as well as any other polishing cloth I have had over the years. One still needs elbow grease but a lovely shine one will get. I do like the large size.
5.0,"True to size, exactly what I expected"
5.0,Gave as a gift recipient liked it
5.0,Great hat. High quality.
5.0,"Hard to dind a good liquid shoe stretch anymore, but this did the job."
5.0,This has become my daughter’s favorite blouse! So lovely and classy.
5.0,"Exactly as pictured. Very pretty. I am obsessed with them! Not too heavy either, they’re honestly perfect to me!"
5.0,I absolutely love this purse but unfortunately I did not order the correct size. This one is a bit too small for me. Returning and reordering the next size.
5.0,I love this band! It’s very comfortable and I really like that it’s thinner than the bands from Apple. The size really dresses up the watch. Such a good value for the price!
5.0,"Practice putting it on! This is great for someone who wants a little more squeeze during their workout and wants it looser while around the house! It’s completely adjustable and easy to get on. It’s all on you comfort level. I recommended to several coworkers because it’s easy enough to wear at work and just pull off, roll up, and throw in your purse."
5.0,Love the look of this
5.0,Comfortable and great fit!!
5.0,"These socks are perfect!  Hard to find socks these days that are cotton, not too thin, and that don't squeeze  your<br />ankles, but don't fall down.  The color is just right for jeans.  Also very soft."

5.0,"they are wonderfull, and extremly sexy, thank you"
5.0,My son love them very happy
5.0,"Fit was snug, but I didn't mind it because it stayed tight to the head when running, etc. and didn't slip off.  Would recommend."
5.0,does the job and looks really great!
5.0,"As a person with 30+ years experience of living with skin cancer, spending time outdoors during the summer months can be difficult.  Whether I'm riding a motorcycle or walking the boards on the beach, this top is exactly what I need. The sleeves are long and have thumb holes to cover the back of your hands and the neck when zippered protects your neck from the sun. It's vented to allow the breeze to flow through, allowing you to stay cool.<br />It's stylist and stylish. Definitely highly recommend!<br />Runs true to size."
5.0,Love that these have pockets for my phone.
5.0,"Beautiful shirt! One of my favorites now! I love the design, looks supe cute and vintage! JUST LOVE IT!!! The cream color of the shirt itself makes it look more cool."

5.0,So cute and flattering. The top is a tiny bit see through. OveralI love this dress!
5.0,Coolest looking belt I've ever owned - period. Very high quality.
5.0,got a few in multiple colors for work
5.0,Exactly as pictured and good price for quality product.
5.0,Very happy with purchase. stretches. 5’5 160 - ordered size 10. Needed belt but nice fit - great length with 4” wedges. Good material.
5.0,Not just for men.  Got this for my husband but ended up yet it for myself.  The cut and color is great.  The drawstring works well.  The fabric is soft.
5.0,"I have been wearing Calida nightgowns for years. This is my favorite style because it is roomy and has a very nice, natural cloth feel to it. It also holds up well after many washings. I also like it because it is one of the few nightgowns that come in extra small and it fits me perfectly."
5.0,Excelente artículo. Fué entregado en el lapso prometido y las expectativas fueron cumplidas. Gracias y estaré pendiente por futuras ofertas.
5.0,"Loved it so much I ordered in 2 more colors.  Got for my 3 year old, much easier then 2 piece ballet outfits."
5.0,This watch is insane.  I just took a trip straight back to 1984.  Way cooler than some crappy modern watch.
5.0,"Everything was as said. It arrived on time. This is very large and heavy and the size of the pole is very large so that is why I made sure to order this one for it comes with base. Others without base would be very hard to find and more expense. It provides excellent shade coverage. Easy to assemble and easy to open and close.  There is no closure to secure topper when in down position to prevent topper from opening or flapping in high wind. The pole itself does hold the weight of the topper, but in high winds even with the topper in closed position I feel it could break off in middle. I have secured it with another metal pole inside the original pole and this has prevented any bending during high winds. There is no cover to protect when not in use. Not been able to find one to fit this size because it is very large. Overall very pleased with this umbrella and would buy again."
5.0,"Don't fall for the fakes! Unless it's certified it's even more dangerous for your kid's eyes - because the eyes open under the shade of the sunglasses and now all those harmful rays go right in. Stick with a real brand like Real Shades, made with quality, certified and polarized! We have these in a few styles for the kids. They love them! So far no scratches or problems but hey, these are expensive glasses because polarized is worth it! We take them from the kids when they are not on to make them last."
5.0,Great quality arrived on time
5.0,Beautiful earings. i love them
5.0,Looks good. Everywhere I go people thank me for my service.
5.0,"Sturdily made, great color combos, enjoy the whimsy!"
5.0,"LO COMPRE EN NOV 2020 YA VOY A TENER UN ANO CON EL Y REALMENTE ESTOY CONTENTO, PRECISO EN LAS DISTANCIAS EN LOS TIEMPOS COMPARANDO CON OTROS RELOJES DE COMPANERO, REF AL AGUA NO HE TENIDO CHANCE DE PROBARLO EN PISCINA, A TENIDO MOJADAS LAVANDO CARRO LAVANDO EQUIPOS PERO NO EN UN CONTACTO DE PROFUNDIDAD, PERO SI CREO QUE LO SUPERA EN PISCINA. REALMENTE ESTOY CONTENTO CON ESTE RELOJ."

5.0,Great buy for the money. Soft and quality is nice. Compliments a lot of clothes. Color is matching what you see in the picture.
5.0,"This was a great buy for me and was exactly what I was looking for. I love the color, a perfect shade of baby blue, sweater has a good thickness and the quality is pretty good even though I found some random colored yarn through some of the stitching but I easily pulled them out. Another great thing about this sweater is that it doesn't irritate my skin. I would of purchased other colors if they had them available but sadly it's just this color. I'm looking forward to wearing this when winter comes."
5.0,Makes your hair really soft and shiny. Love it and will definetly buy again
5.0,"I was looking for some plastic post earring for my nine year old daugher who has sensitive skin. We have purchased earrings from Blomdahl in the past, but they are pretty expensive. These are really cute and she has had zero issues reacting to them. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,"Get lots of complements, I love them"
5.0,"I’ve owned many vests through the years and this is definitely my favorite. It’s incredibly warm for what it is. The pockets are definitely an added bonus.<br />The only design flaw I can see is how snug the fit is around the armpit areas (which is why it’s so warm).<br />Nonetheless, I really like this vest. It’s the second soft shell I have purchased from this company.<br />The quality has been great and I’ve had numerous compliments on both."
5.0,Great Linda pin! As described and fast shipping!
5.0,I have about 6 colors of this scarf.  I typically run hot so a coat is uncomfortable but this is do versatile and can be worn many different ways.  Its great for indoors or in the car .  I always get compliments and asked where I got it.  I have also bought for gifts.
5.0,"Love these for working out and arm protection from sun when hiking. They fit, wash and wear like expensive designer item for a fraction of the price."

5.0,AWESOME TOOL
5.0,My mom really likes it.
5.0,My husband LOVES this watch.  It is a beautiful watch and I am very happy with the quality.
5.0,I have an astigmatism in both eyes so drcing st night has become difficult for me due to bright lights. After buying these glasses I can now drive at night without the bright lights and glares from lights bothering my eyes. I have even worn them during the daytime some as well. Everything is clear and crisp with these on. Love them!
5.0,"these are just what I wanted so thanks, I've been looking or something like this to fix my Christmas watch and couldn't find any,"
5.0,"If you’re super indecisive about choosing between buying similar products on Amazon then just stop. I promise you this is the item you’re looking for. I bought mine and just got it today; the shirts fit perfectly and show off the back enough that it looks good but so that it also is comfortable. The material is breathable and not see through, I’m not sure why some shoppers said it was? Bottom line this is like less than $8 per shirt that would normally cost like $20-15 for just one individual shirt in the physical store suck as Dicks.<br /><br />I bought size small and I am 5’9’’ and weigh around 160 pounds. It fits well and isn’t too long. Be careful with the XS though, it might construct you in the armpits unless you actually need xs.<br /><br />I don’t give out very many five star reviews or ever feel compelled to write these PERIOD. However, I knew I had to when these literally blew my mind after I got them in the mail!<br /><br />Good job Neleus!"
5.0,"Used these for my 18th party, really cuteee !!"
5.0,"What a great sweater for work or travel as it folds into the pocket (collar) for packing in a suitcase, carrying on the plane or putting it in your desk at work.<br />After some sprays of a wrinkle release product, the sweater looked even nicer.<br />Great idea, good product, and ideal for travel.<br />I do wish that it came in a variety of colors as only the color black was offered."
5.0,My husband loves loves loves this shirt. Very breathable soft. And of course loves the team
5.0,"Been using it for years for golf and tennis and it has been reliable and easy to read even in daylight. I only ordered this one because after 5 years, the wrist band is coming apart. The rest of the watch still works."
5.0,Its beautiful and stones are visible.
5.0,"great shirt<br />no cracked letters,just like in pictures<br />made for winter not summer"
5.0,Good quality and extremely warm. Super soft as well.
5.0,The pattern in the sweater is unique.  I love it!
5.0,"I wanted a pair of aviators that were plastic frames and did not have the rubbery nose pieces that get stuck in your hair when you put them on your head. These fit the ticket. Light weight, comfortable and truly block the sun. I wasn’t hesitant to order because of how they would fit but they’re amazing for $13. I can’t say how long they will last but they seem sturdy and the lenses do not give you any rainbow hues when looking through glass so win, win for me. I will be buying another pair soon."
5.0,"Way, way better than it should be."
5.0,"Beautiful, my wife loves it."
5.0,My daughter loves her new shoes. We especially like the shoe charms it came with.
5.0,"Really cute and flattering , I sized up to medium based on reviews and it fits great. I'm 5'6&#34; and a size 6 ladies.<br />This could be worn sexy with slingbacks and nude legs or to church with a brooch and a church hat. Versatile and flattering, arrived fast! On a holiday!"
5.0,"Nice patterns, fabric, and sewing. Very comfortable fit. Loose, flowing cut makes it easy to switch from plus size to xl or even large."
5.0,Cute shades!! Purchased in the color purple to wear at a Prince Birthday Tribute in Brooklyn. Received lots of compliments.
5.0,Sons favorite P.J. botttoms
5.0,I like being able to strap it on and not snap on the balls.
5.0,Nice quality and color!!
5.0,"Cool, comfy top!"
5.0,"Very beautiful fascinator! It looks like something Princess Kate would wear. It has a lovely shape, fits well, and the headband doesn't pinch."
5.0,"great product, works and feels great."
5.0,My niece picked these and a couple of other things out for her birthday presents. She loved them!
5.0,"I've been using this wallet for over 7 months now, and it still looks like it's brand new. I needed a wallet like this that would fit all my cards, cash, coins, spare key, chapstick, and earphones. I love the feeling of the material, it doesn’t feel cheap at all. In fact, it feels much more expensive than some of the brand name wallets such as Michael Kors or Coach that I’ve held in my hand. Definitely worth the purchase."
5.0,"Really good quality for the price! Iv been looking for a while and was willing to pay more, lucked out by finding this one! Definitely worth the money!"
5.0,"Is beautiful, thanks."
5.0,Young and slimming
5.0,"Very durable and strong. Like the fact that it covers all info and others can't read it unless you unsrew the metal wire. It only shows name (I just chose to put our last name). I actually purchased two packs for our recent trip out of country to place on luggage, backpacks for plane, guitar case, my baby carriers and placed one on my stroller as well ."
5.0,Son loves the ring. Decent quality for the price.
5.0,Hubby is very picky and was pleased to get this in his stocking!
5.0,The glasses are exactly as pictured. The quality is great for the value.
5.0,Simply adorable. Fit well and good fabric.
5.0,"I am from the 80 era.<br />And regardless if in style or not.<br />I wear them.<br />I really like these. Not too bulky,<br />Just right to wear with leggings and Booties.<br />I ordered black.<br />I’m thinking on ordering green also"
5.0,I bought 5 of these to give out as Christmas gifts; they were exacly the perfic gift to give to a few friends.
5.0,Love it! I have bought so many of these Nd can never find the right fit. This one fit perfect but the balls are on the big size but easy to switch out for smaller size.
5.0,My little girl twirls around the house in her favorite Jxstar Girls Size 8 dress! She is the happiest little princess in the world when she wears this little flowy piece and the strawberry print is so bright and beautiful. We are in love with this purchase.
5.0,Fit great nice material but rolls down at the waist thats bothering me a lot.
5.0,"Interesting view of the London focusing only on d4, d5 Bf4 lines.  Therefore some interesting and different observations on this one branch"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:e6701514a6e64aa03bafd28cab7bd72c]]
5.0,Good quality; sturdy -- not flimsy like other brands.
5.0,Awesome product. Worked so well on my Chick Fil A inspired keychain
5.0,"I am very surprised by these glasses.  They are inexpensive, I believe the lens are plastic and the frames are clean and simple.  BUT, given that they are polarized, the vision is really good.  I didn't think plastic could capture a crisp image like glass, but these do.  They filter light, they make the outlines of objects very clear and they are light weight and don't hurt the bridge of my nose.  I was afraid they would over power my petite face and they don't.  Still, I think men and women can wear them.  Sure beats $100 on designer!"
5.0,Great! lots of options for layering. MANY pieces to choose from
5.0,I love this suit. And I am most likely the most pickiest when it comes to swim suits. I almost did t try it on after I order package. The bottoms looks to big and the top too wide. But I am glad I did! It fits perfect. Length on top is not to short or to long. It’s not to tight not to loose. And the bottoms cover your rear end and are flattering and the rouched front on the bottoms hides imperfections without being bulky or noticeable. Great lift and support!
5.0,I love the feel of the material. Nice stretch and I was able to do a HIIT workout with it.
5.0,My granddaughters love these shoes!  They are so cute.  I cannot speak to durability as the girls are out growing everything before it can wear out.
5.0,"Wow!!! These yoga pants are the best. The waist is high and comfortable and doesn't cause muffin top if you are a little thick around the waist. These pants hold very well,  but are not too tight. Additionally these pants have pockets which will hold a cellphone or keys. The colors are bright as well. I would definitely purchase them again. These are the best."
5.0,Amazing!  Help for my old eyes and night driving.
5.0,Great necklace!  I wear it almost everyday!
5.0,"So far, no complaints with the earrings, just the ring. They are dainty and look real. I love them."
5.0,Best $40 bucks I spent in a long time

5.0,"I like my black hooded sweatshirt, it keeps me warm. On a long bus trip when i needed a nap i rolled it up like a pillow on that spanish lady's lap."
5.0,So comfortable and adjustable! The best I’ve found.
5.0,I had to return the parka. It was 2 sizes too small. It was well made; and a great value. I had to pay about $10.00 more for a comparable coat. Amazon got the replacement parka to me very quickly!
5.0,Very nice goggles!
5.0,This bracelet / or necklace because it can be worn either way is well done. It meets and exceeds expectations.  It is elegant and charming made from real stones. I bought it for my wife for Mothers Day and she wears it every day!
5.0,"The product arrived earlier than expected.  I love the color although it stated hunter green, but it is really like a seafoam green.  I am able to place my credit cards and driver's license inside.  Can't add too much change to the tiny coin purse section. I spent only $2.97 including free shipping; not a bad deal!"
5.0,"This review is for the t-shirt dress from Charmyi.  I ordered the army green color, which looks exactly like the picture.  This dress would be cute with a pair of flip flops or dressed up with sandals.  The material is super soft and flowy just like t shirt material.  Overall, a great little summer dress for a great price!"
5.0,I was able to wear lipstick without the mask sticking to my lips.
5.0,Exactly how it was advertised. Great hat for Mickey lovers
5.0,So happy to have found this set!!!  Great price as well!!
5.0,"I like the fit.  The way the description of the garment  was illustrated by showing 3 women wearing the same suit then breaking it down to show the individual models  whose figures are different and  told the height and weight of each model and which size suit they were wearing definitely made it easier  to decide what size I needed to order,  and the fit is correct.<br />  I find this suit to be comfortable to wear and the way the material in the front crosses and drapes is flattering ."
5.0,"I wanted a simple, straightforward tie clip and some backups in case I misplaced it.  The clips are well made and the designs are simple and elegant.  You get ten for less than you would expect to pay for one."
5.0,"I bought these for my 8 year old. She just got her ears pierced and was excited for some cute earrings. They seem high quality. She has worn them every day for about a month now and they look as good as new. She loves them! The only slight issue is that they sometimes spin and the kitty ends upside down which looks a little silly, but it doesn't bother her! Very happy!"
5.0,Made really well. No complaints.
5.0,I bought this key ring for my Chrysler TC by Maserati special edition car. The leather and stainless is very nice.
5.0,"They're warm, comfortable.  A little snug at first but they stretch out and are perfect now.  Other than being made in China, I love them."
5.0,"He loved it. Was perfect size with numerous slots for cards, ID’s etc. Thank you"
5.0,"i’d say its on the top among all the leggings i’ve purchased from amazon, it fit really good to me and very comfortable! i love the fabric used in it, no cameltoe issue, i got done with my workout without any destruction of pulling it up, hugs my curves and its really non see through, im 5’4 and 124lbs. got small and fit perfectly! Thank you Aoxjox"

5.0,Great buy for the price! Definitely recommend. Glasses are super soft material. Super comfy!
5.0,I have a large wrist and have a difficult time finding bracelets that fit. This one is the perfect fit. Love the wine color as well. I am definitely going to order a couple more.
5.0,"I bought some Pleaser heels, but part of the strap was elastic. This turned out to be a problem because my heel would shift and result in me being unsteady. These sucker stabilized me. I'm very happy with them saving me from having to give up on my beautiful heels."
5.0,Such a great dress. You can dress it up or down. Great for work or evening event.
5.0,Wore this to work on my Birthday. Got many compliments.
5.0,I broke the crap outta my PS4 controller by wedging it in my recliner when I passed out drunk one night.  Bent the bejesus out of one of the sticks.  This was a great replacement.

5.0,Absolute beautiful...classy. Perfect for my occasion.
5.0,Love it but runs big
5.0,"Wow, I’m really impressed at the quality of these. Super affordable and right on trend. My 2 pair order arrived packaged individually, each in a higher end earring jacket and placed inside one box. Totally suitable for gift giving - keep one, give one! The earrings themselves are beautiful with a durable yet flexible wire that is attached well to the acrylic design. Each pair included plastic backs. The size is adequate without being too much. I highly recommend these for excellent quality, fair price and nice packaging. I will be ordering more for myself and as gifts.<br /><br />If you’ve found my review helpful, I hope you’ll click below to let me know.

5.0,"Let me start by stating I'm 191 lbs, 5'3&#34;, 17 weeks pregnant and bought a large which fit perfectly. The dress is so cute, flattering and comfortable. The length on me is ro just below the knee which is what I want. Even as much belly grows, the dress will still fit since the top tighter fit comes right to the perfect spot at the top of the belly. You can dress this up or down. Oh and did I mention it has pockets?! So cute!"
5.0,"The fleece leggings are amazing and very soft and perfect for cold weather. As someone that isn't used to wearing leggings and unfortunately had to wear some very uncomfortable ones in the past, these completely changed my experience. Will definitely buy again!"

5.0,This is perfect for nights out to the club or a fun party! It's a bit too snug for the small size and could feel some parts rip a bit. My waist and hips are 28 and 36 respectively. This pairs well with a cute sexy top when you're out having fun! It really makes your behind looks nice!!
5.0,"Honestly life changing product. I always sleep through alarms, but not anymore. Never be late for work (or anything) again. And it gets rid of the morning grogginess."
5.0,Soft material....my new favorite
5.0,Love it! I followed all the reviews and ordered a size smaller than my normal size and it fits n perfect. Still lose/flowy but I'm not swimming in it. I'm normally a size 16 & I ordered a 12-14.
5.0,I saw this a lot over the holidays.  My grandson didn't want to take it off.  He is a big Patriot fan.  It is put away now waiting for next year.

5.0,Really like the purse - it's exactly as described.  I would have preferred a purse with a wiser opening than the drawstring so I just loosen up the draw and it was fine. Nice purse and live the colors.
5.0,"I love this shirt!! I bought the small and I'm approx 100 pounds and 5'4, 31 bust 26 waist. It's only a little loose but that's too be expected with this type of shirt. Someone a little larger than me could fit the small size also. There was no reveiws yet when I bought it so I went by the sellers size chart. It says laying the shirt down flat it measures 14 from armpit to armpit and to double size for full around bust measurements. So that's 28 and I'm a 31 and I like my clothes tight so I figured even if it was a little bigger than they said, it at least wouldn't be huge and I was right:) I might try and shrink it a bit. The color is heathered black and the writing is in orange as the picture and description. The material is 50%polyester 25%cotton and 25% rayon  :) overall very happy:) :)"
5.0,Hard to find that color
5.0,Perfect for working is durability
5.0,"Exact Quote-- ""Mom, these underwear are really good! They feel great, it feels like I don't have any on!"" ( He's 10) Happy kid, Happy Mom!!!"
5.0,I get tons of compliments on this every day at work. The pink is my favorite button.
5.0,Pant legs are a little to high on the sides makes it a little uncomfortable
5.0,"This dress looks so good on, receiver many compliments. It’s high quality. I ordered an xs, I’m 5’4, 110 lbs, 32 D chest and the dress hits right at the knee, it’s exactly what I was hoping it would be. Highly recommend. Will be purchasing more dresses from this brand."

Highly recommend and am sure I will be back for more."
5.0,"I bought the Emotional Twin Heart .925 Sterling Silver Love Ring from Gem Avenue. I was very pleased with their courtious, fast and honest service. The price was also very reasonable. I would and probably will do business with them again in the future. I am very please and recommend them for anyone to use. The ring was absolutely beautiful. I brought two different rings one for each of my neices, both heart rings because they like hearts. I know that they will love them. The rings came in these little cute boxes with a cute little bow on top of each one. Thanks so much for the wonderful service."

5.0,"This was for my daughter and she is absolutely delighted!! It is the first time we have tried an online clothing purchase for her and she is convinced that all of her clothing shopping MUST happen on Amazon now. It truly is really pretty on her - perfect fit, perfect colors. The only downside is that she now wants the shirt in the other color and is ready to shop!!"
5.0,Very happy with these shoes. My child outgrew Robeez and I wanted to continue with a soft sole. Great fit and quality.
5.0,"I purchased this pair specifically because it is made of Acetate, Polycarbonate material (most pairs on Amazon) leaks cancer-causing chemical dermally, and TR/TR90 messes with hormones, so I was looking for Acetate as its one of the safest materials. Was pleased that these fit exactly like my old polycarbonate pair. They look identical to Gentle Monster pairs in terms of fit on the face. The front is nice and flat like the original design. The shades are very dark, too dark to wear indoors but absolutely perfect for my light-sensitive eyes when outdoors. Sturdy material, very happy with the purchase."
5.0,GREAT GOGGLES.  THEY ARE MY SECOND PAIR.
5.0,"This nightgown is very soft, warm and comfortable."

5.0,"Great polo, high quality, a bit big."
5.0,"Bought this as agift for myself. Soft, cozy and warm!"
5.0,I love everything about them. My only suggestion would be to make the carrying bag a bit longer and wider so that it is easier to load/unload.
5.0,These are SO CUTE and you can't beat the price! Took almost a month to ship but was worth the wait. These were a great fall/winter shoe for my infant. The band around the ankle is stretchy and would fit a wide foot or can be worn with a thick sock for warmth.
5.0,I bought this ring and a matching pair of earrings as inexpensive &#34;bling&#34; to wear at my son's wedding. I wanted to wear costume jewelry in case I left it behind since the wedding was out of state. The ring is quite large and looks real. Definitely would buy from this company again.
5.0,Works on a trigger finger to keep it from bending/locking.
5.0,"Stunning Dress, adored it and will for many years~!"
5.0,"Worked perfectly! Keeps the sweat out of my eyes, yet thin enough I can wear a hat. Easy to wash and affordable! Thank you! I only wish they came in more colors! 👍👍"
5.0,"I love the shell. I love when people say, “Hey where’d you get that?” and I say, “Oh, this whole thing?!” It is amusing. They shall itself is a light weight, but very warm. It is like wearing a blanket in public, only it is completely acceptable. Like a Snuggie that you can wear out of your house without people staring at you like you’re in Walmart."
5.0,Dress was great quality. Definitely with the money
5.0,These were a Christmas present for my neice and she absolutely loves them. Fits perfectly. So they’re true to size. She says they feel great.
5.0,Most earrings come with the French wires.  I prefer the lever backs because it is safer for me.  Earrings with French wires tend to fall out of my ear even with the plastic stops.
5.0,I have psoriasis on palm of my right hand and I'm a ballroom dancer there's no way that the Band-Aid will stay on so I bought these gloves to keep the Band-Aid in place while I was dancing they are so attractive so much fun and they work so well
5.0,"I love the look of this watch.  This is a birthday gift to my son, who I know will love it.  With it having a cloth band, it will be a good watch for him to wear to work."
5.0,Beautiful! The chain is good quality and i get lots of compliments!
5.0,"Lovely. Crucifix is larger than appeared in picture, but that's a good thing. Thanks Amazon for working arduously to assure this momentum's delivery."
5.0,These clips worked great for my daughter who had shoulder surgery and couldn't move her arm and didn't want to wear a strapless bra but needed the strap off her shoulder. They worked perfect and didn't make her shoulder hurt at all!
5.0,"Runs a little big if buying for a girl—seems to be more of boys size, but not bad at all!"
5.0,Love the shirts. Amazon is the only place I can find the shirts in the size needed.
5.0,Got these for my wife for our RZR and she loves them so much I bought a pair of the green ones
5.0,I purchased the XS for my daughter and it fits her perfectly (she is a size girls 10/12 for reference). It’s such a cute shirt and the little heart detailing in the back is adorable.
5.0,Just what I was looking for its perfect I love them
5.0,Great look in a watch but I am really partial for bangle watches as they don't grasp one's wrist and are easily removable.
5.0,The only thing I would have changed would have been the amount of slots I got. I should have purchased a 12
5.0,I just ordered this bag two days ago and it came earlier then I expected. It look exactly how it looks online. I love it even though its bigger then what I expected. It doesn't have a funny smell to it either . its just right.
5.0,love the cotton and it fits perfectly
5.0,I am very pleased with these pantyhose. They are super comfortable and feel silky soft against my legs. I have not experienced any negative issues with these pantyhose.
5.0,Simple cute
5.0,Great look and perfect fit!
5.0,Hearts Valentines Day nightgown<br />Soft supina cotton
5.0,"These earrings look just like the picture. Nice, dainty, and the rose color is fantastic."
5.0,"Wow!  I have never tried one of these sticky type bras, so I was looking forward to it. When I go shopping, there are many items of clothing that I pass over just because I know they would show bra straps.  I normally wear a size 34c, so I ordered the D size.  I have read other reviews of women of similar size saying they had problems, but this worked for me very well.  They came in a zippered pouch with a strap, so they can easily be stored without getting any dust or other stuff on them.  I have tried strapless bras in the past and have given up on them because they are too snug and they always feel like they are going to fall down.  I didn't experience that with this invisible bra at all- they stayed on well, were comfortable,  and did not feel like they would come off.  I did have to find the right position to put this on so that they were not noticeable under my shirt.  I love this invisible bra - I don't think I have ever had a bra give me cleavage like this!<br /><br />I received this item for free in exchange for wearing it and providing my honest, unbiased feedback.  The price I paid had no bearing on my review as I have no relationship with the seller and I never guarantee a good review."
5.0,These were extremely reasonably priced. And nice quality. Not thin at all. Great for our Minnesota weather!! Recommend these to anyone!!! Delivered quickly!!! Very happy with these sweatshirts.
5.0,My most favorite go to romper!! Dress it up or wear it casual. Comfortable and so cute. Always get complements when I wear it!
5.0,My husband says these are the best socks he has ever had!!!!
5.0,Very soft boho coverup. Love it.
5.0,It’s true the head hole size runs on the smaller side but I bought my 8 yr old the large size so it’s longer in length for her tall height and she says the head hole is not cumbersome for her. She’s finally happy with these vests!
5.0,"For some reason I expected the package to have 2 gloves? But that aside I loved the glove, full fingered gloves the fingers are always too short, this was a great product, helped my wrist tremendously"
5.0,Not sure how well it works still winter know more this summer. But I did lise in my waste.<br />Got delivered ahead if time.
5.0,Perfect size for my septum ring! Love the quality and the price of course! I buy these every time I lose my septum jewelry!
5.0,"The shoe is beautiful, but runs very small and not true to US sizes."
5.0,They fit perfect when I thought they might run a little tighter/smaller. I am really happy with how comfortable they feel and how perfect of a fit they are!
5.0,"It's always hard to order a new item of clothing, not knowing how it will fit. Lately I've been between a medium and a large, so buying clothes has sometimes been challenging. I went with a large, and this fits perfectly! It's flattering and I will wear this a lot! I plan on ordering more in different colors!"
5.0,Love this so much! Super soft and comfy!
5.0,A well made bag with lots of compartments. No need to carry a wallet in it. I love it!

5.0,I love this shirt! If you order your correct size it still isn't too short. Not see though at all. Definitely recommend
5.0,Great evil eye pendant!
5.0,Perfect for summer wear
5.0,Excellent quality and looks great. Perfect way to look dressed up with the comfort of a t-shirt or light sweater. This is a light sweater tee but could work in almost any weather.
5.0,"I love these earrings. They are beautiful, lightweight, and a conversation starter. I wear them with pride!"
5.0,Arrived perfectly
5.0,Love them....excellent quality. I ordered xl and they are too big.I should have ordered large but the xl will do. I normally wear a 12-14 pants. Hope this helps.
5.0,its very nice but I ordered the wrong size
5.0,Fit great on the new Charge 3.
5.0,At first I thought I was spending too much money for slippers but these are comfortable and sturdy and worth the price ... Glad I made the purchase.
5.0,"Impressed by the package presentation, for the price I was expecting something simple but gladly I was wrong. Looks as picture."
5.0,"Nicely made, fits like seen in the picture. I'm 5'3 117 pounds measurements are 34-20-45."
5.0,My wife said is really handy !!
5.0,I had it on all day today and did not feel anything uncomfortable. Is really light and barely notice when you have it on. I’ll definitely rebuy it in the future
5.0,Took forever but they are cute
5.0,"I had purchased this rosary for my great niece, as a gift on her very special day and she loved it. Thank you for selling such a treasured gift for a treasured niece."
5.0,I ordered large based on reviews that It runs small. I am size small normally 32D but large was too baggy for me and I returned it and ordered size small that fit me just normal. size smal was not snug at all and still has light and roomy fit.
5.0,I love my new watch; very sleek. People are asking me about it.
5.0,The socks are everything they say they are.
5.0,Love this tee shirt !  Great quality at great oricec
5.0,Super super cuteeeee!!!! I loved it on my baby the fabric is so soft and comfy! My daughter is petite 20 lbs at 12 month I got her a size large and it’s a tad loose on the bag but no biggie I probably should’ve got a medium for the perfect fit but still great!
5.0,Its a oversized dresses it fits good if your a small it will fit like Med.  But it looks nice
5.0,Great man bag
5.0,These have been amazing!  Developed metal allergy after having kids but these little protectors allow me to wear earrings again!  They are thicker of course so took a bit to stretch out ear holes to accommodate them. Work best with stud type earrings. Hoop earrings tend to tear the protectors.
5.0,Light and breezy summer dress. Love the soft material. Fits as expected. Perfect for a casual day or can be dresses up at night.
5.0,"I was really hesitant to purchase a swimsuit online without being able to try it on first. After some thought & reading the other reviews, I decided to give it a try. I'm really happy that I went with it and ordered this suit. I love the colors black and white together, so I already loved the color combination. The fabric is soft, no annoying itchy material sewn into the breast area or any where else. The length of the skirt came mid-upper leg on me, which I liked a lot. The skirt was not too tight nor too much fabric flowing. The shorts underneath are another great bonus in my opinion. There will be no worries if the skirt flows up and me baring my Bikini Buns to the WHOLE pool. The top has two long ties to make it tight or as loose as I like it. The padding inside the breast area isn't super bulky, which I like. I am quite big breasted though and there isn't enough support there for me personally, but I can deal with it. Anyone with large breasts would probably understand when it comes to bathing suits. Overall, I am really happy with the bathing suit and it is the first one I've really liked in a long time. [[ASIN:B01GO0G864 Angerella Retro Vintage Sailor Pinup Swimsuit One Piece Skirtini (SST043-B1-3XL)]]"
5.0,"I love these boots. I read a lot of reviews before I bought them. I have pretty narrow feet and found them easy to slide on and off unlike many other people. I am a teacher and I’m on my feet all day. I wore them the first day without any trouble. They are a little bit heavy, so probably not the best work shoes~ but they’re pretty great."
5.0,Wonderful easy to put on and pull off without pulling hair
5.0,The purse was a graduation gift for my daughter - she loved it. The purse is well made and just the right size.It was delivered on time and the packaging was on point
5.0,It is a quality hat.
5.0,"Good quartz watch field watch for the money.  Standard field watch appearance with black face and no date.  Simple and practical for time of day.  Lightweight and pretty sturdy.  Came with black NATO strap through non-pin/non-replaceable type bars.  Easily replaced with any color 18mm NATO type strap, but will not take pin type watch bands.  Easy to read dial with12 and 24 hour markings. Acrylic crystal, not a screw down crown, but it is water resistant.  I think it will last a few of years."
5.0,"Good size, good quality and received quickly.  Vey happy with my purchase!"
5.0,Very nice shoes for formal events.
5.0,Very good quality for the price.  I am able to put all my essentials in the several compartments inside.  Inside a little snug but it still works very well and is a very attractive daytime purse.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a very attractive and stylish blue purse.
5.0,I luv them. Bought for my granddaughter nd she loves them. They r soft and fit perfectly.
5.0,Just what my son was looking for and for oercectly
5.0,Loved this wrap dress!
5.0,the product is better than I expected
5.0,Adorable. Doesn't look cheap.
5.0,So far I really like it. It shipped quickly & the product was exactly as I expected.
5.0,"Great price and fit, im 5’2 110 lbs 32 c and 26 in waist. Got a size Small. Fit as a crop top with a little bit of room so not skin tight. Will be buying in other colors!"
5.0,Excellent craftsmanship and fit! I'd buy it again.
5.0,"Excelente producto igual a lo ilustrado, se ve muy bien, con muy buena calidad"
5.0,I love this hat for my son! He is a bigger boy... 6 months head is in the 99th percentile.
5.0,Love this shirt fits perfectly 😊

5.0,Great shirt. Great material. Bought one size bigger and it fits great.
5.0,Loved my mug!
5.0,"Very good compression socks. Nice and tall, right up to the knee. They have good compression, and have a very comfortable sock/toe area. Great for exercise if you need. I’m impressed with the vibrant colors!"
5.0,My favorite thing about this shirt is the straps are adjustable! Also it is true to size.
5.0,"At first I thought these were intricately woven with string, but they're filigree metal. Very cool. The 3D shaping of the stud portion lends a higher-end look, while the whole thing is very lightweight. If I didn't feel them moving around when I turn my head, I would completely forget I'm wearing them. They'd stay in just fine with a standard metal earring back, but the fact that they have the wide plastic disc version is an extra comfort bonus."
5.0,Prefect size. True to size. Came the same day I ordered.
5.0,I bought this for our Bunco Kentucky Derby Party and got lots of compliments on it
5.0,Bought a pair to wear after Leg day. My son tried them out to help with Soccer games and practice because he was dealing with shin splints. He loves them and says they help out a lot. I've bought 5 pair so far.

5.0,Love love these piercings. I was skeptical at first thinking the gauge size was too big..but they fit great. I've always wanted an anchor now I have it. Plus the other 4 are really cute too.
5.0,bought this for a 17 year old brother. hes about 5'9 and 175 and the medium worked perfect. color is vibrant and very soft material.
5.0,Liked the fit & material.<br />Returned for a larger size

5.0,"I typically wear an XL size 12, and this dress in XL fits perfectly."
5.0,Lots of glitz without being over done. Nice price.
5.0,"Watch looks amazing. It really stands out. I took out a few links to adjust to my smaller wrist size. Wasn't too hard but pro will be for some. The links I took out I used them to test the quality of the plating. Left in water, left in alcohol n still no issues so its a really good watch for the price"
5.0,"This is very strong. Love the fact that it has a whole to hand it on the wall with a nail. I highly recommend this to anyone. Sturdy, strong, heavy, very nice. Thank you 😻❤❤🥰😍❤❤👍👍"
5.0,Nice looking well made belt that seems like it should be durable.
5.0,Product is as described and as pictured
5.0,This dress was a perfect fit!
5.0,"I have gotten too many compliments on this dress! You gotta wear it with a peplum skirt for that extra cuteness! Its cloth and breathable, also stretchable. It can be tightened in the back so no worries on looseness."
5.0,"Well made bag, large enough for my son to carry around books and toys. The dinosaurs are nice and denfined on the front of the bag. Would buy again!"
5.0,These bike shorts are super comfy and not too bulky.  Can be worn alone or under leggings.  I’ve done both.  Fit perfectly!
5.0,"A really cute ring for a good price. I wanted a comfortable belly button ring for every day wear, as the fancier ones hurt and catch on stuff. This one is very comfortable and tons cuter than a basic barbell. Cheap too!"
5.0,"In love with this dress! It fits perfectly, the back is very flattering and so is the color/pattern. I got so many compliments too.<br />I wish there were more colors of this exact style. I like it so much that I ordered the only other color available :)"
5.0,good quality and looks nice.
5.0,Love it! It's beautiful and a good size.
5.0,"Perfect headband for keeping hair away from your face during a workout. Inexpensive enough, and works great. What more could you ask for?"
5.0,I have tried many different brands. This is the best I tried
5.0,"I just started working at a local grocery store in the meat department and did not want to damage my wedding ring; however I did not want to go without a ring. these silicone rings have saved the day. they are comfortable, easy to clean and with five colors I can switch around. I am glad I found these rings"
5.0,"I love this and wear it as an oversize shirt over leggings. This shirt gets more compliments than any other outfit I wear. I purchased a 'Large' and it fits me well, it is fairly loose and I normally wear a size 10-12 pant and L-XL top if that helps anyone."
5.0,High quality coat. Does it’s job.
5.0,"These are good aftermarket replacement lens, I got the ""Fire Red Mirror"" lens -- and they are comparable to Oakley's Ruby Iridium, both on the lens coating (looking at)  and the lens tint (when looking through). They are polarized, no distortion and have a beautiful reflective medium red-orange color. The lens tint (when looking through for the wearer) has a cool grey/blue base and is a pleasure to look through. It's a great all around lens for sunny to overcast days and everything in between.<br /><br />Are they as good as the OEM?? No, but they are about 85% there at at a fraction of the cost. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again from this brand should I need replacements when these gets scratched beyond usability. They are polycarbonate lenses (fancy plastic) just like the OEMs and plastic lenses WILL get scratched.. it's inevitable, just a matter of how quickly you go through a pair of lenses, so good to know I have an affordable option to go to when I need.<br /><br />Replacement is easy, snap the old lenses out and these pop right in. They are a bit thinner than the OEM lens, but it fits and is secure without significant movement."
5.0,"Very soft, great colors and graphics hat look just like the picture. Love it!"
5.0,I bought these for the High School team and they love them.
5.0,I am very satisfied ! Beautiful pendant.. I will buy more. The seller is very serious ! Thank you ☺️!
5.0,I have wide feet abd these shoes fit snug but are just the right snug fit.
5.0,better than pictured.  I'll add pics when I'm done
5.0,"Works as expected, bungee is a little ridge for my taste.  Holds well against moderate wind."
5.0,Loved them.  Bright colors
5.0,"I first ordered the navy blue in XL. I liked it but it felt a tiny bit too big, so I ordered the black in L. I love it! Quite flattering and cute. It’s lined, but because it’s a wrap dress, I recommend wearing something underneath it. I wore a thin black slip dress underneath.<br /><br />Since you wrap it and tie it, you can tie it as tight or loose as you want. So it’s really comfortable. The fabric is light and breezy for summer. You can go casual with it or dress it up with nice shoes & jewelry for a night out.<br /><br />I wish they had more dark colors, like a dark red. I would order more if they did."
5.0,Looked Lovely and helped dress up a drab outfit
5.0,"Bought this belt for a costume. The belt is gorgeous, fits well and went great with my costume.<br /><br />Husband:  The belt isn't as gorgeous as the wife that wears it.  :)"
5.0,good quality hat - very pleased with fit and look and comfort!
5.0,Exactly what I expected! Very happy with them!
5.0,"These pants are amazingly comfortable and fit perfectly! Perfect for sleeping in or wearing around the house. The only thing I'm slightly disappointed in is the color. I ordered brick red thinking it would be a darker red like other brick red things I've bought. I assumed the color shown was just my screen being inaccurate. Nope. It's exactly as pictured and alot closer to pink than red imo. I'm not going to return it for that, just wanted others to know."
5.0,Comfortable and useful in the garden
5.0,Excellent fit thanks
5.0,"So handy to have a light right on your comfortable hat!!!  No more flashlights,  you get hands free light!!!"
5.0,colors are good and fit is right
5.0,"Style , for work"
5.0,Great quality socks that fit right and keep your toes nice and cozy
5.0,Awesome necklace! Arrived quickly and it's just how it shows in the image. Great job
5.0,These are fairly easy to slip on. They look great! Will order more.
5.0,So soft and durable. I love that her feet don't sweat in these.
5.0,Convenient-<br /> No ironing. Easy to use
5.0,👍Beautiful❤
5.0,Both pairs are about the same size. They are both much smaller than I was looking for (about 2 inches long and 1 inch across) but I actually like them as-is. Both pairs are very lightweight and I forget that I’m wearing them. They come with rubber stoppers not metal ones.
5.0,"Bought it, use it, no color change, wear it constantly and  have NO problems. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes elephants and needs a new belly ring. Never gets caught either"
5.0,LOVE this shirt! Fits perfect! Going to buy it in another color now too!
5.0,Nicely made.  Excellent specimen Mercury dime.  Nice little watch in heart shaped pendant.  Got this as b'day present for daughter- think she'll like it.
5.0,Looks just like the photo! Size I got was the Mens Medium and it fits true to size! The shirt turned out great and I am super excited to give it to my son as part of his Easter Basket!
5.0,My 2.9 year old daughter loved it.
5.0,Fit perfectly! Boyfriend loves them. Perfect padding in all the necessary areas including the tailbone. Great flexibility. These will be great for snowboarding.
5.0,Great little band that doesn’t make your wrist sweat like the one your watch came with. You can pull it up your arm a little bit when your husband makes you get the dishes done. Perfect for all my nights at the sink.
5.0,"I purchased this because I was going to be attending a football game during record cold weather. Being plus size, it’s not always easy to find this kind of thing, so I was pleasantly surprised when I came across this set. Both items were soft and very comfortable, and they definitely made the cold a little more bearable."
5.0,"This was just what I wanted. A nylon, webbing belt with a simple buckle. It's not some heavy duty webbing designed to be loaded with tons of stuff. The webbing is strong enough to do the job of a belt, but still be flexible and comfortable. The webbing adjust easily through the buckle, but doesn't slip once set. I started wearing it so much I bought a second one.<br />The graphite can have a bluish tint to it, but how it looks really depends on what it's next to. In the pic, its next to the black one that I bought shortly after receiving the graphite one."
5.0,"I wore this dress to a casual wedding in the summer. It's very cute but has more of a cotton texture to it which is fine but made it a little more casual than I was hoping for. Fit great. i'm 5'6"" 130lbs and wore a small."
5.0,"Ok so I didn’t ever think I’d fit into an x small again, especially after having back to back pregnancies (3 under 3), but I took a chance based on the fabulous lady that posted a pic of herself wearing the apricot dress. I was determined to buy this shade of dress! I am so happy that I ordered it and in x-small! All the other reviews on this dress scared me, but they are somewhat true. The fit is different and it’s somewhat larger at the waist and then tighter at your feet, but it works for my body type. I have curves so the loose waist is perfect for my hips and behind and makes them look great! Plus my mommy kangaroo pouch isn’t noticeable. It’s comfy right at the bust. I’m 5’1” 138lbs and 36DD. The length is right at my ankles. It is somewhat see through, but not as bad to where it’s super thin. I wore it with neutral color undergarments and had no issues with it. Love it!"
5.0,"I love this bear sweatshirt! I got the 3T size for my almost 3yr old so I would be sure it fits for awhile, my son is on the smaller side so I'm glad I went with the 3T as he is in 2T now, he should be able to fit it this winter (little big) and next winter, should fit perfectly then. When you first pull this out of the package you can feel it's great quality. Plus the bear design is adorable!<br />I do recommend this sweatshirt, it is true to size."
5.0,"These sneakers were purchased as an extra for school. They fit as expected and are comfortable, per the nine year old."
5.0,Comfortable and stylish shorts
5.0,"I wore this dress to work and it was so comfortable and flowy, I'm taking it on my trip to italy and I can't wait. It can be a great dress for a long flight too. I'm 38ddd, 5'1 and 140 pounds and I ordered an xxl and it was a perfect fit absolutely love this dress, I'm about to order it in navy blue."
5.0,"Nice thick flannel, comfortable fit."
5.0,"These pants are everything!! I'm 5'3&#34; about 135. They fold a little at the ankle;I'm short so most pants do. They look super cute with my tunic tops. Okay, my husband was just checking me out. He says,&#34; you're dressing better.&#34; I've worn these pants to death so annoyed he just noticed but I guess I'll take the compliment.<br /><br />They are super cute!<br /><br />Just ordered another pair. Will look super cute with boots if it ever gets cool where I live."
5.0,Perfect keychains for gifts!!
5.0,I wore this dress for a Christmas party. I am 5’6 140-145 lbs. I bought the medium. The only thing is that you may have to wear a certain type of bra.
5.0,Liked figure on background.
5.0,Absolutely love it! This is what I was looking for! 👍
5.0,"This is a very beautiful bracelet, the stones are well made and very sparkly. The band is pretty flexible but strong enough to give me confidence that it will not snap when I put it on. It is nice enough to wear when dressing up to go out on date night but also not so fancy that you can't wear it with casual clothing. The 3 bracelets come in a very nice red velvet box lined with black velvet inside and tied together with a ribbon. My wrist measured about 6 1/2 inches and it is still loose enough to slide about 2 inches down but not so loose as to come off no matter what activity I am doing. I also like the fact that I can wear all 3 or even just 1 or 2 at a time depending on how I feel.

5.0,i love the fact that my daughter cannot pull these off unlike her first set
5.0,I love this TB clutch so much I bought 2.  This bag is so classy.  You can dress it up or down. It goes great with everything.  I also have it in black.  There is just enough space for the essentials and a night on the town!
5.0,Very impressed with item. Delivery was prompt.
5.0,Fit perfectly under my daughters figure skating outfit
5.0,"Absolutely love this ring.  The quality is very good and the look is gorgeous!! The color absolutely pops and has a classy look.  The color is soft, but yet present. I couldn't stop waving my hand around because it was so pretty. I would highly recommend."
5.0,I fell in love with this dress when I saw it online but I was complete with it after wearing it for my 10 years anniversary. The beautiful details on the dress the draping shoulders with small string of pearls and lace give me that look of seduction as well elegance.
5.0,Great transaction. I love the glasses
5.0,THESE ARE VERY PRETTY.  MY DAUGHTER WANTS A PAIR*😄 THANKS AND HAPOY SAFE HOLIDAYS* *
5.0,This dress fits nicely! I ordered an XL in the red wine color. I usually wear a size 14. It is a fitted dress as pictured so wear some type of control garment if needed. The material is very comfortable. The fabric is a good quality and thick enough to wear with no slip with no see through. I loved it so much that I placed a second order for the black one!
5.0,Heavy duty shirt kinda reminds me of a Carhartt t-shirt well made and fits as a expected. Would definitely be purchasing more products from this company in the future.
5.0,A great summer dress for any occasion. I wore this for a bridal shower on a hot day. Personally I did not get overly hot as the dress is flowy. True to size.
5.0,Perfect and warm!
5.0,My niece loves them.  She can hardly wait to take a trip.  I think they were a little pricey.
5.0,Good tactical belt
5.0,The dress is flattering and fits nicely.
5.0,Love that these are high quality shirts!  The colors are vibrant!
5.0,Feels great in your hand.
5.0,This was a gift for a friend and she loved it. Very nice.
5.0,Seller is amazing! Not inky was the item exactly what I wanted but they added in an extra gift for me!!
5.0,"The &#34;V&#34; neck gives a slimming effect.  The fit is comfortable, but not slouchy.  You can dress it up or down."
5.0,These are the only socks that won’t fall off of my 8 month olds feet!
5.0,Great item - works just as it should!
5.0,My daughter loves this dress. It looks cute and is very flattering. It's lightweight material makes it a nice transition dress for Fall.
5.0,Perfect fit.  Will order again. Great price and value.  Wish there were other color options however. Favorite tank top ever.
5.0,"Ok, I really didn't expect this jacket to be as nice as it is based on its $ tag, so am pleasantly surprised.  The fit is pretty true to size (at 5'6"" / 122 lbs I chose size M in black); I usually wear a small but decided to go M and it fits fine with enough room should I wear a heavy/bulky sweater.  It's incredibly soft, has elastic at the cuffs and waist band and has a small mandarin (stand up) collar. It has a medium size zipper, the type generally found in higher priced clothing, that should hold up well to continued use. There are two large inside pockets which I find convenient for keeping strangers hands away from valuable items such as keys, cell phone, etc.<br /><br />The only CON I found is that it sheds! Like crazy! I think it will eventually get over this phase, at least I hope so! Be forewarned, give it a good shake, brushing, going over with sticky roller or as last resort a light vacuuming prior to 1st wearing or you will be wearing fuzzballs! A lining would have been nice!, I know I'm being picky here.<br /><br />Cleaning tag states that its washable but Professional Dry Cleaning is recommended.  A previous reviewer mentioned that it made it through her washing machine with flying colors [pardon the pun]. With DIY dry cleaning kits now available there is always that option vs professional dry cleaning.<br /><br />With its sophisticated styling this jacket could easily go from jeans/casual to dressy/date night outfits.  I do recommend it."
5.0,great shirt!! bought this for my daughter that started to officiate games and it fit perfectly.  good quality fabric and patch area is the right size.
5.0,"This dress is amazing! I bought it because I am still nursing my 1.5 year old, and I like to look nice every so often. It is so comfortable and can be dressed up or down. I may have to order another on in a different color! I pair mine with yoga shorts underneath so I can wrangle my toddler as necessary."
5.0,My favorite hat purchase on Amazon. Fits great and looks great. I get tons of compliments. Just wish they offered even more colors! (I have one in white as well). Highly recommend!
5.0,Stunning skirt and great little belt. You will need a good slip. I cut out the attached slip as it didn't hide anything and had no give in material.
5.0,"Very cute, fun soft socks."
5.0,Love my glasses. First day I wore them I got compliments. Love how thin they are and that it came with its own bag for protection and repair kit. Nice quality pair of glasses.
5.0,"These are really fun, and looked great on my friend's ears (gift). The dangle length is perfect, and the quality of the faces was very nice. Cool and inexpensive gift, would definitely recommend getting for yourself or someone else."
5.0,Great quality for the price! May order in another color!
5.0,I love this Necklace. Very Elegant Statement Necklace.
5.0,I like the product very much but it is too tight on me.  I was looking forward to enjoying it but unfortunately cannot wear it being so small.
5.0,"I have a large head. I made my husband wear this for a couple of hours prior to our event as his head is larger than mine. Other than that, love this hat."
5.0,"Very awesome! Comes with a great selection and really good price,no quality issues"
5.0,My husband uses this to sleep in. He loves it so much.
5.0,I get so many compliments on these! A great buy at a great deal. Love the slight cat eye and tortoise color together. They honestly aren't ultra strong in protecting the sun because they're not very dark but I don't have a problem with it.
5.0,"Fits differently than other Fair Indigo t-shirts... more snug, so consider sizing up. Otherwise, a comfy tee in soft fabric."
5.0,"Love love love! Fit as expected, nice length, and very soft."
5.0,"Got this for my niece, she is absolutely obsessed. It creeps me out, but she loves it. Lol. She will FaceTime me to show me how it glows at night."
5.0,Got them for my son and he loves them.
5.0,Light on the face and fun to wear!
5.0,Nice. Good quality. Made a good gift
5.0,So cute and soft. Such a great buy.
5.0,It Looks exactly how it should. Even Showed up sooner than expected. Overall happy with purchase :) just not with my own ear size :/
5.0,Always a good deal. They do shrink so don't order too small.
5.0,"Baby girl loved it, months later- still wears it!"
5.0,"Such a great idea, holding up well, keeping family organized when sharing suitcases!!"
5.0,"I love this and frequently use it as a stylish scarf when I go out. When I stay in, I wrap it around me as a shawl. It's so soft and luxurious, I'm considering buying more in different colors. I can't tell the difference between it and my very expensive cashmere scarf from a small Scottish boutique."
5.0,Perfection. Looks like moonstone
5.0,Great for groomsmen gifts!
5.0,Arrived fast; perfict size and is absolutely adorable. Just like the photos.
5.0,"Comfortable and cozy on these warm summer night, I think the top can be used as an outside during the day without it looking like pajamas. Does not shrink. 100% satisfied."
5.0,Quality blouse! I came back hoping to order another color even. Washed and worn multiple times and it's become my favorite for work. Please stock more!
5.0,Excellent and well-made. Would order again.
5.0,Love the shirt! Great price too!
5.0,"Some people complain that this is too thin-- it says &#34;lightweight&#34; in the description, so I'd say it was as expected. It's actually perfect for my uses-- I am always cold, so I always have some sort of shawl or sweater with me. I wanted a cardigan for summer-- one thin enough that it will breathe, and that I can bring along with in a purse-- so that I could cover up my arms from the sun if it was getting too intense.<br /><br />This cardigan is absolutely great for that purposes. It's super thin material (not see-through, but probably would show a little bit if you stretched it), silky soft, folds down really small, and hits me mid-thigh. I'll be bringing it to Europe with me, I can see it coming in handy as an all-around cover-up if we decide to visit some churches!"
5.0,"Ok so far so good. I have worn this bracelet for the past 1 month and 3 days , nonstop even with showers and hand washing as well as dish washing, and I am allergic to everything. I have never been able to wear fake jewelry. But so far not even an itch! The bracelet is extremely beautiful. And really looks expensive. So I would have to say this is a great bracelet. I will continue to wear it and I will update if anything changes. But for now . I really do like this bracelet! Actually this a follow up from 4 weeks ago . I most definitely give the bracelet a 5 star ⭐️"
5.0,"Love the R-hand leg picket for my phone. Ease of movement, colorfast, don’t retain smell like some wicking fabrics tend to do."
5.0,I wear this ring all the time and get so many compliments on it!
5.0,We bought this as a gift for my sister in law she love it perfect for nice value
5.0,Cool wearing shorts for walking
5.0,This key chain is a! Good build and it looks awesome! I saw some people say they had trouble with the little spring clip compared to the normal carabiner. Well I haven't had any issue
5.0,Head chain fits perfectly. As other reviewers stated the studs are much smaller than in the picture. However tey are still noticeable. Which is a plus because if they were bigger it could of made the head chain look tacky. The chain feels and look like good quality. Feels sturdy. Looks like it cost 15 or 20. The item comes on a cardboard type tag so I put it I on a hanger so it wouldn't get tangled. Will buy from seller again.
5.0,I have a small head and it fit perfectly
5.0,"This dress is everything I hoped it would be! It got here so quickly and was just as beautiful out of the package as the pictures online. I ordered a size up because of some of the reviews I read but when I tired it on, it was a frumpy-not flattering fit on me so I decided to order a medium and try it. It fit me perfectly. I am 5'4, 133 pounds, a 34 B bra size, with a 29 inch waist and the medium fit me very well! I think the way this dress fits you depends on your bust size because the arms and waist are forgiving so I think if you measure your bust and follow the chart they provide you should be spot on. As a shorter girl I was worried about the length but it doesn't touch the ground even in my bare feet, which is perfect! It is so delicate, the material is soft, and the embroidering is detailed and whimsical. I'm so excited to get dolled up and wear this for my special birthday outing this weekend!"
5.0,"Received item exactly as listed! The weight of these sunglasses are perfect, they don't feel super heavy at all!"
5.0,"After much disappointment shopping in stores, I found this item on Amazon.  It was everything I was looking for at a considerable savings.  My wife really likes the item."
5.0,This dress is made well fits well and is darling!
5.0,Item as described. Satisfied with the purchase.
5.0,"The best protection I’ve found for the Super Mario Bros Game & Watch. I’ve tried others that weren’t built for the device specifically (and this one may not have been either) but it fits the device snugly and I have no issue throwing my G&W in my bag to take it on the go. I do wish the color of the trim matched a little closer (I prefer the black on the outside as the red side is a brighter shade of red than the device is), but it’s by no means a deal-breaker. If you’re looking to take a SMB G&W on the go, you need one of these."
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, just love this necklace and love to wear it!"
5.0,"These leggings are a great value. The material is relatively smooth, doesn't feel cheap. These are quite compressive, which I like. They stay up when running and lifting weights, and they're reasonably squat proof. The customer service is great - my first pair were fine, but not fantastic (they were using a different manufacturer at the time), and they made sure to follow up and send me another pair to try. The new pair is great, I would definitely consider purchasing these again."
5.0,Cute non cheap feeling earrings for St Paddys Day!
5.0,Perfect size and fit!!! Love this shirt!
5.0,"I couldn't believe how well made this suit was for the price! I'm 5'3, just had a baby and it fit great!"
5.0,"This dress fits perfectly.  It is snug fitting on top and the bottom flares out beautifully.  The fabric is soft and the dress isn't of cheap quality or poorly made at all!  It also has pockets which is an awesome feature!  I definitely recommend this dress to anyone looking for a nice, simple dress to wear any time!"
5.0,Well made and slim but still holds all the cards I need. Much more comfortable to keep in a back pocket than a traditional bifold wallet.
5.0,"This is really nice!  Very soft material, really comfortable."
5.0,Nice quality for great price
5.0,Fits great but it looks more like a slip or nightgown than a dress. Not just my opinion either. So...ugh. lol
5.0,Was for my mother - good quality and she loved it.
5.0,"Not too thick, not too thin. Love these socks !"
5.0,They are the most comfortable pants I own.  I would buy these again.
5.0,"Very happy with my purchase!!! I bought size 13. I'm 5'5ish and 170 pounds and these fit great ;] nice and stretchy/comfortable in the waste with no muffin top or love handles sticking out, and they look flattering on my butt which is fantastic!"
5.0,"Just like the picture, true to size."
5.0,"These are cute little earrings. They are very lightweight and smaller; but, not too much so. I'm quite pleased with them. I may buy more."
5.0,Got this for a co worker she loved it
5.0,"I received this shirt as a gift in the beautiful purple,  I would have never bought this shirt for myself, and was a little upset with the XL size as a gift, but I have to say it was the best gift I got...I love it and I really feel very pretty in this shirt.  It is very comfortable and the back is stretchy and you have room to move. I just placed another order on my own, because if I find something I like...I will take one in every color and in XL :)"
5.0,This came on time and packaged well. The quality is very nice and i got compliments literally very 10 min. all night when I went out! I wear an extra large and this dress compliments all the right places!
5.0,I searched for a while to find a replacement band for my Apple Watch since the silicone ones it came with irritated my skin and this band is so cool! All of the look of a stack of bracelets but is a watch band! Stretches to fit any size wrist!
5.0,These gloves really keep your hands warm
5.0,"This was it Gift, she Loves It"
5.0,These bra's are so comfortable!  I highly recommend
5.0,"Was important to find a merino wool bra, and this one certainly fits the bill. Very comfortable, although I probably could go down a size to small. Would probably need a bit more support if I were to do some hard impact jumping exercises, but for my application, does a great job and would recommend to others."
5.0,These are amazing! I have a round face and these still look oversized. I have been asked multiple times where I purchased these.
5.0,I love these sunglasses!! They fit nicely over my regular glasses and although they add a little weight it's not uncomfortable. The teal color is a little darker than pictured but is a very nice rich color. I wear a lot of teal and turquoise so this color is perfect for me. They are very fashionable to wear and made of good quality plastic. I also like the fact that the lens color isn't too dark but definitely blocks the sun so I am not squinting. This is the 3rd pair I've bought - all different colors. Highly recommend these glasses.
5.0,Works great! My husband farms and uses it daily to listen to music and take phone calls while working outside.
5.0,This set looks even better in person. Each piece catches the light beautifully. Looks way more expensive than what it costs.
5.0,Love these shoes. They go with anything. Really comfortable if you're on your feet a lot during your day.
5.0,"Cute, unique and sturdy. Much larger than I thought they would be, which was a nice surprise."
5.0,My niece loved this !
5.0,"There should be smaller sizes, maybe.."
5.0,Love the ring it looks great! Fits great! Stays true to size chart
5.0,"First of all, I’m 5”2’, 133 lb and battling nonstop weight gain and widening waist brought by menopause and breast cancer hormonal medication. I always like these wide linen pants cause they can cover my full figure and they’re comfortable. But it’s hard to find them in shorter inseams that also has a “shape” that can make us shorter girls’ legs not too short. So I wasn’t expecting too much when I ordered these pants…. But surprisingly the inseams are just right for me & the length actually look like the product pic. Plus it has shape. With the weight of the linen the pants drape well and look smooth and comfortable. I add a few inches of elastic band to mine cause I prefer very loose waist band and this was easily done because the pants’ design. I’ll probably get another color if the can survive nicely after machine wash."
5.0,I love the bracelet. It looks great and the fastener is fantastic. It helps remind me of &#34;WHO&#34; I can really count on.
5.0,Mom always wanted a mothers ring she loved it
5.0,Loved the shades but they were not great for what I had intended them for which was for boating. They are very light weight and don't stay on face very well. Also for the price I wish they were polarized.
5.0,Great garden gloves!
5.0,"Great hat, hard to find"
5.0,This hat is great! Would definitely purchase again!!
5.0,Gave as a gift for a fellow golden girls lover. Fits as expected and is good quality.
5.0,"I'm not a fan of gold, preferring silver BUT, the color of the thick, well made leather band and the off-white color of the watch face helps the gold to NOT be so 'showy', as I prefer an understated looking watch. It looks good and goes with any color. Constant compliments. Feels good. Keeps great time. Does not have date on it but that's easy enough to overcome with all the electronics we have around us daily and a simple question as to what date it is isn't a big deal. Yes, five stars is on purpose."
5.0,"The scarf is just as promised. It’s silk like. It arrived on time. It was neatly folded and sealed in a plastic bag.<br />I’ve not worn it yet, However, I’m sure it’s able to keep my hair in place."
5.0,I love these earrings! I wear them almost everyday and they are just perfect for my ears.
5.0,nice variety of sizes to mix & match...great for multiple piercings
5.0,"Nice purse, disappointed it did not have  a separated zip compartment."
5.0,"This is a beautiful, functional eyeglass holder.  It's working out well for me and I'm glad I got it.  I definitely recommend it."
5.0,"This is a beautiful accessory, goes with so many items and brights up the black I typically wear."
5.0,"Great Timex watch. New Waterbury series. Excellent design similar to the classic Rolex Explorer model.<br />Nice size. Works well, and the Indiglo is a nice feature. Good value in a classic design."
5.0,"Love them. I think i have 7+ Bands for different looks!!!<br /><br />Bought a ton for my daughter who is a chemist with shoulder length frizzy hair and she loves them too.<br /><br />They stay where you put them, even motorcycle oratv riding"
5.0,"The second I saw this piece of jewelry I knew I had to get it for my daughter. She is the biggest Nightmare Before Christmas fan and collects everything and anything with them on it. I was searching for Nightmare Before Christmas items when I came across this necklace and knew I had to get it for her. There were several designs to pick from, but I really liked this one for the romantic quality shown between Jack and Sally. I was lucky enough to get this necklace at a discount thanks to the seller in exchange for giving an honest review. I must say I would have gladly paid full price though, because when the necklace arrived it was way better than I expected for the price! The chain was thick and made well with no defects, the crescent moon pendant was really pretty and had a nice design on it, and the Nightmare Before Christmas pendant was gorgeous! When I gave it to her,  she was so excited she put it on right away and then got on to order another! * I've received this product for free or at a discounted price for my review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own **<br />This is a beautiful necklace. The metal moon is very light weight. It feels delicate but it is beautifully detailed. The photo of Jack and Sally is amazing and very clear. It's also a good size. About the size of a quarter."
5.0,"They do wear off so dont expect to have them for a long period of time, but i  mean still a good product and stlyish for the price! still love them."
5.0,These are the same quality as much more expensive brands.  Perfect for my girl.  She loves them.  Waterproof.  Soft foot bed!  CUTE TOO!  THANKS AMAZON AND STREET MODA.  Can't beat the price!
5.0,Keeps great time and looks cool.
5.0,Very nic3 lots of comments on it.
5.0,"Fit as expected - Euro Large is a US Medium. Great construction and fabric, highly recommended."
5.0,Niceeeeeeeeeeer❤❤❤🎁
5.0,I'd recommend this. I'm in between size bands and this is perfect cuz its adjustable.
5.0,I absolutely LOVE this apple watch band. It really elevates the style of my watch. I get complimented on this band CONSTANTLY- it definitely stands out in the best way possible. I wasn't sure what the quality would be like but it is VERY sturdy and great quality - reminds me of the acrylic used to make sturdy eyeglasses. The band stays cleaner than any other apple watch band I've tried. I also am very allergic to certain metals which doesn't allow me to use many different types of fashion watch bands. This product is perfect and causes no skin irritation whatsoever. Probably one of my favorite purchases on Amazon!
5.0,"My wife loves these shoes, good material, design and softness for high arch heel."
5.0,Excellent lenses.
5.0,"I am 5'9&#34; and in heels, I'm easily 6 foot tall. I purchased a 2xl b/c I wasn't sure if it would actually fit. I'm typically an 18. This skirt was amazing and I received so many compliments including from my husband who absolutely loved I. I wore it to a church convention and it was so fitting. I also paired it with an Old Navy dark denim button up shirt. The pockets, I totally forgot that I had. Most times on a skirt like this, the pockets are bulky but these were unnoticeable. I will definitely purchase this form of clothing from this seller again."
5.0,Love this bag!  I use it to carry all my work stuff.  Big enough for it all.
5.0,One of my favorite bangles ever!!!!!!
5.0,Can't complain for the money.
5.0,"Bought this for my wife as a small token.  The weight of the keychain is nice as it is not the heaviest thing on there, but certainly has enough weight to help keep the keyring balanced.  It also looks real sharp and is well engraved."
5.0,Beautiful set of 4 necklaces great quality for the price
5.0,I got this from my husband and he really love them! And they’re really affordable I definitely would buy again!
5.0,"Awesome t-shirt!!! My buddy loved it, fits great and feels great"
5.0,I like the socks. Size in correct I’m an extra large and they fit well!
5.0,These boots are well made and have lasted longer than a lot of other rain boots that he has had.
5.0,The quick dry material and fit around the chest meant that I felt no chafe and no pull during any standing or floor exercises. Would buy again if they release more colors
5.0,This piece was blessed during my ordination ceremony and I wear it when doing public ministry.  I've received several compliments and have been told that it is an appropriate visual reference to me as a ministry since my denomination does not wear &#34;the collar&#34;.
5.0,Yoga- wood floors at home
5.0,Awesome for my daughter to wear to entire night during vow renewal ceremony of my husband and I

5.0,Great product! Like not having to use chemicals! Made my sterling silver jewelry shine again!

5.0,"My 15 year old lovec them, worked  great for his 1st time skiing"
5.0,Excellent product and arrival
5.0,I have a very small head and I love these earrings. They are very tiny but so comfortable. I normally don't sleep in earrings but happened to fall asleep one night with them and they didn't irritate me. Worth the purchase.
5.0,Very nice assortment. Even gave some away.Keeps my extra car key on my wrist.

5.0,"I absolutely love this dress! It's soft, it's a vibrant red color, it, fits and drapes perfectly, it's suitable for any occasion, and it has POCKETS!<br /><br />This a great price and quality for this lovely dress. I have worn it with a chunky necklace, with a scarf, or just plain. It washed up easily and it is so much cooler than shorts in our Hot Humid Houston summer. Plus it's nice enough for work, church, dinner out. But also light and breezy enough for a casual outing."
5.0,"A beautiful night gown, very soft and comfortable, the material is lite and very stretchy, just what I wanted, recommended, great amazon service from it's employees, great job !!@, thank you for the fast shipping 👍⚘❤"
5.0,He liked it very much!

5.0,Perfect patch great 👍🏼
5.0,"I have not worn it, although I did try it on. I purchased the green and I bought a size small.It is a little long but I like that. It fits perfectly. I had already ordered the black one and I cant wait to get it!"

5.0,These are so soft and a beautiful the dye pink and purple! I ordered a 2x cuz I thought they might run small and they are perfect and roomy!!
5.0,"I ordered them to replace a pair I bought previously. The glasses arrived 2 days after I ordered them. Unfortunately, I found my missing glasses 3 days after ordering, so I returned them. That being said, the service and delivery time were great. I'd recommend this product to anyone, they look really good and are very durable."
5.0,Love them...super cute fit perfect on my 3 m.o
5.0,"It was bit to small, I should have definitely gone up a size on this item but aside from that it's great"
5.0,"This jacket is beautiful, but at least a size too small."
5.0,Got it for my 20yo and she looks great in them.  They fit great.
5.0,Love the look! Super flattering!! Wasn't expecting too much but it was perfect! Only down side was you can see the lining shorts under the pants in certain lighting. Not a huge pet peeve of mine and definitly not a deal breaker for this comfy and flattering jumpsuit
5.0,so comfortable and soft ..love it
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE these!! Sooo cute and not thin, see thru! They are very long, even for me, I’m 5’10” But that’s OK, normally these pants are way too short. So worth every penny I spent and actually more. Very pleased with everything about them. I do wish however there a little bit wider at the bottom like a true Palazzo."
5.0,Purchased this bracelet as a gift.  Stones were beautiful and I like the infinity links.  Well worth the cost.
5.0,I wear a 2x I brought a 3x and it fit like a loose dress. It was nice for Halloween. It looks just like the picture.
5.0,"Love it. Doesn't flare out like I thought it might, but it's warm and looks great."
5.0,"This was absolutely adorable. It was a little large length wise for our two year old, but the waist fit just fine. The headband kept slipping due to the weight of the donuts on top, but for older kids I don't think it would be a problem"
5.0,They are just what I needed to block the sin rays from my eyes. Truly recommend them.
5.0,"I really like how these are made. You have to put it through the back of your piercing hole and screw the front on. I normally wear 14g but I don't mind these being 16g, a little lighter than my usual stuff. They seem pretty well made, all pairs thread properly."
5.0,"My daughter is tall and skinny,  we have a hard time finding underwear to fit. These fit great!!! She loves them!!!🤗"
5.0,Fits nice very much cute I wore a medium
5.0,These gloves are great . They don’t stretch much but that works for me to get a snug fit.
5.0,"Nice fit, comfortable, looks nice too."
5.0,Catches the eye..dress up with jeans..or great night out ....for dinner..love it...
5.0,Purchased as a gift and receiver was extremely satisfied.
5.0,"Love these. I’m usually a 7.5/8 and I ordered the 8 and they fit but definitely glad I ordered up. Haven’t had long so not sure about the durability for price, but seem to be good quality"
5.0,"It looks great until you lose it or are robbed overseas. Your passport, cards, cash, pictures of your girlfriend, pictures of your wife, pictures of your dog, all gone in one shot. Cool looking but a bad idea."
5.0,"Thick fleece, very warm."
5.0,Beautiful dress. You may need one size iPad especially if you're busty
5.0,This dress was perfect for my daughter's dance!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:50932b7cec8c92612b76e5c6b07260ac]] Great buy. I am in love with this item.
5.0,"I got these pants wanting a lightweight, solid cargo style that would look better than a pair of leggings yet be as comfortable. These hit every mark! I am not someone who is comfortable wearing a pair of leggings with a tshirt going out to run errands and such, but I have done that with these and have felt comfortable, and confident. These pants are flattering, and they have pockets which is a huge plus. They’re joggers that are as comfortable for lounging as a pair of sweatpants, but so much lighter and versatile.<br /><br />I love the elastic at the ankles, it keeps them from moving up the leg when walking. I wouldn’t consider these warm, but I’ve worn them in Chicago in November during a pretty heavy rain and I wasn’t freezing, and they dried so fast! I was really impressed. The rain stopped on my way walking back home and they were nearly dry when I got in the door.<br /><br />They do run a little small. I typically get a size Large but I got an XL hoping they’d be extra baggy, but they fit more like a size Large in my opinion. If you’re looking for more of a baggy fit then I’d recommend sizing up. They are stretchy, though, so if you want a more fitted look then go for your regular size.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these, and would buy again 100%. The quality is great and they’ve held up perfectly after several washes already, no fading or messed up seams! Five stars!"
5.0,"Love these! You can see through the material a little bit, but that's leggings for ya!"
5.0,I like it because I can actually see the color of the phone unlike other cases.
5.0,Love these! Really warm.
5.0,"fits as expected, doesn’t turn skin green, super happy with it :)"
5.0,Nice and thick heavy socks. Good quality. Would order again.
5.0,super cute dress. fit great and got tons of compliments
5.0,Love it. Light weight. Feels good on the wrist.
5.0,"I bought this as an all-purpose purse to use while traveling, and I absolutely love it. So many useful pockets! &#60;Smile and lightly clap hands for glee!&#62; It may not be the prettiest, most feminine item out there, but it certainly didn't embarrass me. Not one bit.<br /><br />The side pockets are great for sunglasses or keys, which I usually lose in the biggest pocket of my bags, where they end up either getting scratched or scratching other things. Inside, you have places for makeup, pens, phone, etc, and plenty of ways to arrange them. This is now my go-to purse. Wish it came in gray or even &#34;denim&#34;."
5.0,Amazing purse! There is absolutely nothing I dislike about this beautiful bag. The colors are bright and vibrant<br />And the quality is top shelf!
5.0,Very disappointed that women's sz 12 is the largest you make. Why is that? I would have preferred a 14.
5.0,"I. AM. IN. LOVE! Fits great! Flowy, Has pockets."
5.0,"I wear these everywhere!!!!! Even bought another set so I don't have to stress about fitting into my clothes postpartum. They're flattering, sit above my C-section scar (if that applies to you), and work for doing yoga in. Fancy night out? These leggings! Going to the store? These leggings! Seriously, you need these"
5.0,I read the reviews and ordered a size it. It was to big for me. I think i should have ordered my normal size and it may have still been a little big. The dress is really nice overall.
5.0,I wear this to the office and running around. Good quality with a lot of style.
5.0,These are not as sensitive as I would like. but they will pick up most stations within 50 miles.
5.0,"Absolutely adorable on!! The length is perfect, and exactly as pictured! My husband immediately commented on how good it looked!"
5.0,Good. Super
5.0,"I love this top! It is a super cute material, so comfy, and well worth it"
5.0,Been wearing these earrings sense 2014 and haven't had  any problem with them at all they don't change colors and I only take them out once a week to clean them these are the BEST out there jus ordered more just to have...
5.0,My daughter loved the black ones I bought her
5.0,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!!  LOVE The vendor...very nicely the vendor reached me to make sure I was satisfied with purchase.  The earrings are just gorgeous and very fast delivery!!!!  Definitely recommend this vendor as well as the products they sell and will most definitely use them again!  THANK YOU!!!
5.0,"Somewhat smaller than expected. Having said that I love it. I am smaller in the chest and essentially a potato chip. I would not suggest this if you are bigger in the chest or curvy as I am not sure it would fit the way that you would want it to. It is not nearly as loose as the picture implies. Again, having said that I love it and am excited to wear it on the beach all the time."
5.0,"Love this dress for my daughter to go to the Father-Daughter dance.  Had originally bought the size I thought she would wear  a size 10 but had to return for a smaller size.  It is gorgeous and made very well!<br /><br />Update:  Received the size 8 and it is gorgeous!  I am so please with the quality of this dress, my daughter is now so excited to wear this to the dance.  She normally wears a 10 top and 8-10 pants so I thought she would wear a 10 but the 8 fits perfectly.  So very worth the money!"
5.0,Outfit was so cute! She wore it to her kindergarten pumpkin patch trip & everyone loved the look!
5.0,"Absolutely satisfied!! I'm very, very happy with my purchase. These arrived for my girlfriend and fit her comfortably as well as look super cute! These are perfect and are so adorable. She has had no itching with them and she said it feels light and like nothing is even there. These don't just fall out of nowhere they are very secure and sturdy. They are indeed flexible and all arrived safe and sound, individually packaged."
5.0,"Vivid colors, good quality of all products in the package, I reviewed sooo many tutu fairy sets before buying this one and very happy with the product for the price. 2 year old loves it!"
5.0,Great fit but the chrome lense is challenging to look through. The other pair were easier to see through.
5.0,I like these socks so much I bought them twice.
5.0,I love this dress! I get so many compliments on this dress! Need them in all colors now
5.0,"These sunglasses are cute! I was looking for sunglasses for a music festival that I could afford to break/lose, so I decided to try these. Even though they’re a bit flimsy, the quality is great for the price. I usually wear narrow/medium width glasses and these fit just fine. They’re exactly the same as in the stock photos. It comes with a nice pouch and cleaning cloth. Would definitely buy again!"
5.0,WONDERFUL!!!!!!!WONDERFUL!!!!!!<br />I love  this bag .
5.0,"Omg I love it! I usually have a hard time finding a bra that fits with my immediate projection but overall shallowness. This beauty pushes the ladies up wonderfully and the added straps neither squeeze nor hang off (something I struggle with in vs bras!) the band is true to size but I would say the cups are slightly on the narrow and short side- both work for me! For the price, I wouldn’t pass it up. Now, can I get one in every color?!"
5.0,For valentine gift to my wife.  She will love it.
5.0,"Such a nice watch, same as description!"
5.0,Good for the beach or golf or.. change the picture you have so that it doesn't look stained on the left breast.
5.0,"The necklace is very cute with heart and key shape. The little fake Dimond in the key is shining. The only cons is if you purchase this as a gift, you may need to prepare a separate gift box since the package is very simple. Overall, the necklace fits the product description and I'm happy with this experience."
5.0,"These are one of my favorite palazzo style pants. Yes I have bought more types than anyone should do, so I know that this brand is great. Stays up- some with wide waist bands slowly fall down. Good color and washes fine. I use cold water reg machine wash then slump them on a chair or towel to dry."
5.0,These dress was perfect! I wore it to a baby shower. It’s was super confortable & stylish.<br />I think I could have ordered one size down & the fit would have her perfect. My bust size is smaller so I felt there was plenty of room in that area of the dress which why I suggest one size down if your smaller on top.
5.0,This fit my wife perfect
5.0,Pretty and so worth it for the price!<br /><br />Amanda Jean
5.0,"Soft, comfortable and adorable. . Matched the picture  perfectly. It arrived quick!"
5.0,This dress is cute and comfy while still being stylish. I like the adjustable straps for the shoulders
5.0,Great Belt!  Wide width to keep pants from rolling.  My Husband will be buying several more.  Thank you!
5.0,Love this shirt. Its great material. I would suggest maybe going a size higher up of your normal size if you are big chested.
5.0,This was a high school graduation gift for a young woman with an amazing future ahead of her. I will be buying more bracelets and more charms!!
5.0,This skirt is so fun! It's edgy and elegant. I wore it over a black body suit and it almost looked like it could have been a dress! Very light weight and comfortable!
5.0,"Very nice quality, rich looking, fits perfectly, many compliments and next best thing...it arrived about 2 weeks earlier than expected!"
5.0,Grandson like them really well.
5.0,The quality was very good.  It fits great. Only wore once so not sure how well it will hold up.  Will update my post if it changes.
5.0,I liked that it was very cute. It would have been nice if it had a strap so I could wear it like a backpack.
5.0,Love it. Fits my wife perfectly. I bought her more sweaters from this designer and they all fit her great
5.0,"The three-pack is excellent for having available in different locations. Keep one in the car, keep one in a backpack, and the third one at home.<br /><br />Suggestion for the home use:<br /><br />Since you'll not likely need to fold it, I suggest using a thin zip tie if you find yourself using your controller while lying horizontally on a recliner, couch, bed, etc. This way, it'll prevent the holder from tilting forward if your phone has a bulky case. Extend the metal kickstand, then wrap the zip tie where the phone sits on the holder and around the metal bracket, so it forms a square shape."
5.0,Love these jeans  - Super comfortable and as described.  Already ordered a another pair
5.0,Well be reordering. Love how long they are!
5.0,My daughter looked beautiful in these at prom! They were very classy looking.
5.0,I like it a lot it just needed to be a little more stretchy
5.0,It is so beautiful I like the whole package.
5.0,This outfit fits perfectly to my body it's comfortable
5.0,"Love them!!!<br />Saved my eyes in a fight with 7"" scotch-brute pad spinning over 800rpm!"
5.0,Its XL but fit like a large
5.0,"Great value for a cute, easy top. I wore with shell toe sneakers and black jeans and my hubs thought it was a very cute, sporty-rocker look on me. The material is not super high quality so I suspect it will fade and get shabby after many washes but I expect it will last one or two seasons at least."
5.0,Love these boots! They run exact size.
5.0,Nice suit and quality.
5.0,I love this great addition to my woredrobe. Very flattering.
5.0,I got this as a gift and it was nice. It's just a regular t-shirt. Colors are vibrant and it has held up in the wash.
5.0,I love the softness of this fabric. It drapes lovely and is not see-through. Such a beautiful green color! I also purchased the yellow color and it's so vibrant!
5.0,"Love the color and all the pockets. Plenty big enough for all your electronics, water bottle, make up etc. light weight , durable and wipes off clean if it gets dirty. Lovin it!"
5.0,perfect fit. great color.  impressive brand.  A little pricey
5.0,"I was surprised at the quality of this jacket.  It is lined with super soft material and it looks nice enough that I wore it to work.  Runs loose, which I also liked.  I am 5'3"", 160lb, I ordered a large and it has plenty of space for layering"
5.0,These are excellent sunglasses with a very far price. I have no complaints. Just as good as those high end expensive glasses. Good glare reduction also.
5.0,"I bought three of these.  I replaced my aging three-year-old leather watch band with this.  The quality is excellent, so I bought a fourth one!"
5.0,Comfortable. Does not stretch out. ( yet)<br />Not hard to get on but keeps the swelling down.<br />Would buy again if needed or a friend needed one I would recommend
5.0,It's very light and durable. Smooth gloss finish. Can see my reflection in it.
5.0,Perfect match to the face of my watch.
5.0,Perfect! Cute head piece for unicorn Halloween costume. This can be used for child or adult costumes.  (Probably 3 years+) came exactly as pictured. Love it
5.0,Fits amazing!! Fabric feels more expensive then what you pay. Definitely recommend! Feels nice and fits awesome. Worth the buy 👍🏼
5.0,"Great visor, stays in place"
5.0,"I loved the dress! It fits very true to size. I especially like that I am not very tall and it fits above my knee. I also love that the elastic on the shoulders doesn't ride up. It's stays put so you're not constantly adjusting yourself, So many designs to choose from I would order more since I know the size is perfect for me in medium. I'm only 5 feet and weigh right under 150 lbs and it made me feel happy because it fit. I used another print for my birthday and felt really pretty and sexy."
5.0,very nice bracelet. not to large and dainty looking.
5.0,Pleasantly surprised at the quality if this for the price! Very sparkly!
5.0,Great product. Wish the band could be a bit longer. Easy to install. Feels great on the wrist.
5.0,I got this as a gift and she loved them especially the pockets
5.0,So perfect & no one can see through them! Exactly what I needed
5.0,I bought these for my 1 year old when he became 100% potty trained. They’re so soft. They fit perfect around his legs and waist ! I have bought all of them! I think this is a great price for what you get. They don’t shrink when you wash them and they stay soft. I highly highly recommend these!!!! I’ve told so many friends about them and now they have their little guys in them too!! I also love how they’re solid colors. I’m not a character person on clothes. So these are great.
5.0,Such a cute gift for a dog lover
5.0,Wonderful boots and at a great price! I would definitely purchase more in different colors!
5.0,Adjusted size based on comments and am very happy.
5.0,I get tons of compliments when I wear this !!
5.0,My friend recommended me  to buy them. I didn’t think highly of them but I have them a try. I really saw a huge difference upon wearing them after exercising!!!!<br />Great product!!!!<br />Highly recommendable!!!
5.0,"The top looks very much like the photo with the exception of it being sheer. I expected as much from the reviews. This top is also on the small side. If you want it to be a bit loose, order 2 sizes up. I typically wear a medium. For it to fit like a &#34;standard&#34; tunic, I ordered an XL. It is also long enough to cover the butt."
5.0,Its has a nice feel. Great for out of town outfit.
5.0,I like it very good
5.0,"Very light, but full and the faux fur is quite lustrous for this price. Very impressed! I'm ordering a second one to go with my other coat."
5.0,"I love this dress.  I chose a size that was a little bigger because I didn't know if it would fit well but its ok.  My sister bought one as well and it fits her perfectly she is bigger in body than I am, but I am really happy with the purchase and I would buy something from this store again in the future."
5.0,"Beautiful frame, great lens. Just used last night on my motorcycle and worked perfectly.<br /><br />It stands out from the other models due to it’s beautiful design and I could use on a party as well."
5.0,A bit loose but beautiful
5.0,I can’t say enough about this Sandle so comfortable and I don’t slip
5.0,Perfectly color and holds everything I need it to.
5.0,This dress is really nice and the fabric is soft and comfortable!  It gives me curves... Yahooooo
5.0,Very happy with the material and way the shirts fit although the size ran slightly large. Very comfortable and looks great!
5.0,My kid loves it very much. It was very fun to play with
5.0,Comes a little larger in size.
5.0,'47 Brand is my favorite brand of ball caps . . . love the adjustable strap on the back
5.0,He looked so good!! Since they are real leather he said they were a little stiff but this was also the first time he wore them. Usually he wears a 32 in jeans but we got him a 38 in this measurement and it fit perfectly!
5.0,Bought for my 14yr old because he hates wearing masks. He says he lives it. Super comfy and he barely notices he's wearing it. He even wears it while playing basketball so he can be around his friends. I will be buying one for each member for our family for sure!
5.0,"I would like to note that I wouldn't classify this as a sweatshirt.  When I think of a sweatshirt, I think of something heavyweight and thick, maybe with some fleece lining too.  This is more like a long sleeve t-shirt.  The material is a little silky on the outside, but soft on the inside - not really sure how to describe it accurately.  The shirt has an oversized neck hole, which it something to consider.  I got a size M and it fits like an American size M, it matches the size/fit of most of my other M shirts.  I got the blue tie-dye color and it seems to match pretty closely with the picture.  Overall, the shirt is very soft and comfortable - already one of my favorites."
5.0,I love the thickness and the lining on the inside.  Not a normal mitten
5.0,The best jeans EVER!!!!
5.0,awesome for the price. beautiful.
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised with the fit and quality. As everyone knows you can never be sure when ordering on line. I got it for my boyfriend and he seems to like it. I washed it first to see how it would do in the laundry before giving it to him. Such as shrinking and loosing it's shape. It did well and still is. I always think that is a good idea with any new clothing. It has held up well. Much better than some.
5.0,"Really pretty, great length, love that it’s reversible."
5.0,This has been a really fun addition for our little one's wardrobe. The quality and fit of the shirt are both great and it has washed and worn well!!
5.0,"Great quality, much bigger than I expected but I didn’t really look at the dimensions of the item before I made the purchase. Great for any Star Wars fans young or old!"
5.0,Cute and comfy. Arrived quickly.
5.0,Nice leopard print item. Seems durable. Chain long enough to hang comfortably. The tag itself appears to be metal with a clean crisp decal on each side.
5.0,"Very soft, comfortable, well made, and fit beautifully! Love them!"
5.0,"This dress fits perfectly. I'm 5'3"" 145lbs, 36d, size 8-10 and the M fits perfectly. This dress is lined so it's appropriate for many occasions. The detail is nice especially for the price.bi bought a red and white with the intention of sending one back but I love them both! I would buy the other color if it had pockets."
5.0,Made well for price.  It’s a great basic crop top. Bought it for daughter she loves it. Fits great.
5.0,"Excellent Mido/retro watch.  As a retro watch - does not ""bells and whistles"", but has great design, excellent color combination (dark blue mostly).  Surprisingly, very good size ( I was initially concerned before ordering the watch about ""small size"" - I was wrong!).  Fits well on an average+ size wrist.  I liked the watch from a get go and was wearing it ever since.  Highly recommended!  Price is right and the seller is great!"
5.0,My son says they don’t make his feet sweat (like his other socks did) comfy and tall enough!
5.0,Love it!!!  Perfect size too
5.0,I wore this with a plumbob headband at a con and got so many compliments!
5.0,"I like the rose at the top of the charm holder and it’s daintiness. Just wish it had been a little thinker to hold my charms. Otherwise, it’s pretty and I will only place two lightweight charms on the holder."
5.0,Work ID
5.0,"I actually LOVE this bag.  Putting the little credit card holder in the secure front pocket is brilliant  And the quality of workmanship is excellent.  Haven't tried the little charger yet, but I think it is a good idea...so overall, this is one of my favorite purses...and I literally am ALWAYS on the hunt for a good purse to fit all of my things in a small but accessible space.  This does the trick."
5.0,"Purchased these for my 8 year old granddaughter. Unfortunately although she loved the way they looked, they were a bit too big and heavy for her. The good news, Mimi now has a new pair of earrings! :)  They are so cute! :)"
5.0,These packing cubes make packing easy. I got this one free for a welcome gift from Bago and ended up ordering the whole set.m
5.0,This bracelet is pretty and made for a small wrist-perfect for me.  The stones are as they appear in the photo and are polished and well set.  It was also nicely packaged in a pouch and sealed box.
5.0,The necklace I bought looks so beautiful!! I can't wait to wear it on my wedding day!
5.0,Smaller than expected but dainty and very pretty. The rose gold is exactly what my 12 year old girl wanted! She wears it a lot but knows not to wear it in the shower or swimming.
5.0,Very cute... just don’t expect to put much in.
5.0,.Like the .design
5.0,Husband loves the shirt and it is soft and has a great rocker feel
5.0,"Second pair of these that I ordered for my son, he loves them and it was a great price."
5.0,Super cute and fits perfectly. I double checked measurements with my previous barbell and cloth ruler. Worked perfectly.
5.0,This dress is fun an flirty!!
5.0,thanks fast delivery good service i recommend it
5.0,Good quality. Thick plastic. Promptly answered my emails.
5.0,I've used these socks for about 1 week now and will recommend them to every nurse I see.
5.0,Was smaller than expected.  Fit snug.  I ordered a large because that is what I normally wear and it fits more like a medium.  Other than that the dress is beautiful!
5.0,Got these mainly to wear under other shirts. Fits nicely. Works perfectly. Received them in a timely manner.
5.0,My wife loves it. Which says a lot....
5.0,Love this dress. Got it in two sizes and two colors. Love them both! Plan to buy more. It's a very flattering fit and didnt show me sweating.
5.0,"Love these, they're not too big, perfect.  I bought 3 pair in several colors."
5.0,"These Sketchers are of very high quality and are extremely comfortable.  If you love cats, you will love these shoes.  In addition, Sketchers will donate funds to help the dogs and cats who need homes."
5.0,I bought this t-shirt for my nephew...who loves the Cheers series.  It came well wrapped...like new.  My nephew wears it proudly.  I recommend this t-shirt...for all who enjoy the series on TV.
5.0,"Very well made, comfy, stylish.<br />I am very satisfied with this swimsuit."
5.0,"This thing is too complicated.  I just finished setting it... took me 10 minutes.  I can do it blindfolded  now but will have forgotten by the time I need to set it again.  I don't need stop watch, alarm clock,  time value of money, horoscope.  I just want Casio's real classic....  the F 28W.  Nothing but time, date.  The impossible dream.  They have to add features to give it the Wow Factor.  And  it ships with a display holder that just adds to the price...  probably at least a nickel.<br />  But.... it's still a great deal."
5.0,So cute. Lighter weight than I expected and snagged pretty easy.. but so soft and comfortable
5.0,My cats adore these feathers!  I do have the stick which the feather attached to but my cats prefer just to play with the bunch of feather alone!
5.0,"Love it, it matches a pair of earrings I have.  Thought it would be bigger though."
5.0,"These joggers are great! They fit like a medium. They aren't snug as a medium. So if you like the tighter look, go for a small. But I also loved these because of the drawstring. Ensures that I don't have to constantly worry about hiking up my pants when I'm working out. For reference, I'm 5'6, 150lbs. These fit great!"
5.0,"I really loved this sexy lingerie and so did my husband. I think this one is now his favorite. I like how it's open for the breasts, it's a different kinkier look than they typical lingerie. It's also open crotch so for those really active people, it makes for easy access amd fun foreplay. I like the material, it feels nice ilon my skin, not to rough, the design itself is pretty sexy also.  U can order in many different colors, I choose the red one as red seems to be more of an alluring color. Definitely try this one out, I'm sure u won't be disappointed. DISCLAIMER I got this free or discounted and this is my honest and 100% unbiased opinion"
5.0,My fav pair
5.0,Bought this to replace a lost nose bone....have Sleepers in all my other various piercings and absolutely love them.  Leave them in 24/7.  Love the various gauge ranges and sizes available.  Can't go wrong with this product!!!!!
5.0,Mama loves them
5.0,I bought it one size bigger and it fit perfectly.  Mind you the sequence bralette is a little small but it still works.  Really cool top!
5.0,Bought this for my daughter.
5.0,As advertised. It’s exactly what I wanted!
5.0,Weekend purse
5.0,These panties are wonderful.  Difficult to find cotton seamless high rise panties that dont show under athletic clothes and tee shirt dresses.  Really well made and no shrinkage during machine washing.  Liked so much i ordered more.  Arrived quickly.  Vendor very kind and appreciative.
5.0,Super pleased. Super cute with my bump. All my friend love this dress.
5.0,It was a gift. Looked great!
5.0,"The neckalces are nice, especially for the price. Bought as a gift for my fiancee, love that the black half is more manly than some other &#34;couples&#34; necklaces I've seen.  The chain is a small ballchain necklace, strong but not fancy. The charms looks exactly like they do in the picture and their size is nice. Big enough to see but small enough to slipped under a shirt and not be in the way."
5.0,Absolutely love these pants and I have multiple patterns. Just be careful tie the string otherwise the sting falls out first wash. Unfortunately my first 3 pair went in for their first was together. 😪😪 but if you are careful you should be good.
5.0,"My 7 year old son needs noise canceling in his classroom at times to concentrate. We tried 3m Peltor, and BabyBanz as well before he declared the HearTek ones worked the best for muffling sounds & were most comfortable on his head!!"
5.0,Hermosísimo tal como lo esperaba 😍
5.0,Juast as described love it.
5.0,Love these tank tops !
5.0,"Super soft, warm, and I wear them instead of sweats all the time. They’re great!"
5.0,"While I don't usually purchase stainless steel rings, this one has a design that's probably best carried out in steel, since anything else might not hold up.<br />So far, it's held up quite well.  Looks a bit like a computer wire-frame of a ring, which is what I was looking for.<br />Recommend."
5.0,I love how stylish this band is.  I can wear it to work and socially as well and most people don't even realize its actually my fitbit.  Products by Kartice has never failed and this one is no different.
5.0,I’m really surprised by how nice this T-shirt is. Very comfy and stretchy and not cheap/thin and all. I am 5’6” and 190 and I got a large.
5.0,Absolutely loooove this dress. Wore it as a maid of honor dress but I will definitely wear it again. It’s stretchy too. I’m 5’5” and 135lbs. I ordered a size 2 and a size 4 after reading the reviews that it runs a little big. They both actually fit but I ended up wearing the size 2. The sleeves do run tight though in the armpit area. I’m pretty muscular and I was just able to get away with it. I recommend if you have bigger arms to size up.
5.0,"I order a large because I have a bigger waist n butt. The waist was nice but the v part at the chest does sag for me. Idk if it’s the material, very stretchy so maybe you could size down if you wanted or if you’re  not that big in the chest like me"
5.0,I like it.  It looks nice and it has done wonders for relieving the pain in my elbows.
5.0,will buy more different color l love everything about this dress
5.0,Amazing Japan product
5.0,Cute. Great for a baggy tee shirt dress to help show off my figure and dressed it up.
5.0,Love this!! fits my phone and love the look
5.0,"I love that it’s reversible, cute, and goes with almost anything my baby wears. It’s a beige so it tends to get dirty and somewhat hard to wash, but other than that it’s great."
5.0,MEH
5.0,I have ordered this twice. I love the softness of the mask. It fits my whole face and my face is round.
5.0,I love my new glasses. I have ordered another pair from this company.
5.0,"this is by far my favorite earring, will be purchasing all colors"
5.0,"Overall material is slightly shiny, not matte. Fits well and true to size."
5.0,Just arrived....and I gotta tell ya- I thought Calvin Johnson wuz da baddest Lion out dere...but dis here is way mo' gooder
5.0,Super comfy! I wear nothing but these now. I use them more for lounging then exercise since they’re pretty low impact.
5.0,"My girl has had these shoes for some time. I don't usually review kid items until I see how they hold up. Most of the time the products for kids fall apart before getting much use from them.<br /> Overall, these are a good product. They are stylish and durable."
5.0,"Fits great looks better, but I'm not a particularly big guy so the slim fit that these have is perfect, 10 years and 50lbs later probably not."
5.0,works just like it should i have not had any issues with this band.
5.0,"Love the dress, very comfy."
5.0,"Very nice, everything I expected."
5.0,"These were so stinking cute! They're made from a very light weight wood so they can hang virtually anywhere and are pretty weather proof.  The detail on the masks make them extra special. They're perfect for outdoor décor on a patio, porch, or pool side! We are very Pleased!"
5.0,Great piece. Lovely
5.0,"Yet another adorable pin from Pinsanity. I want all the things!!! Great quality, super-cute, perfect!"
5.0,Love the style elegant yet punk
5.0,Very light weight and breathable. Fit perfectly. Good show for a good price.
5.0,"Great quality! Color is more on the bronze/gold side vs the rose gold side, but overall very pretty."
5.0,This is a very flattering top if you're full busted.  I'd say up to a 38DDD could wear it.  The bottoms are low in the front however. They fit though.
5.0,"Material is nice not chincy. Sizing chart is accurate. Purchased a large after reading some of the reviews but I am returning because my 16 y/o son wants it to fit tighter/more like a muscle shirt so will be getting a medium.  A small on him would probably fit like a second skin, but then may be too short lenth wise. His chest size is 39 inches and waist is 32 inches if the pics help with determining what size you should buy."
5.0,Better then I thought they are and worth every penny.
5.0,KEEPS HANDS WORM FOR MY WIFE WHILE WE WINTER PADDLE
5.0,These are perfect for storing my onions and garlic.
5.0,Gorgeous. My little girl loves the dress
5.0,So Thanks much
5.0,"This band is great.  I know this “sport” style band with the holes is geared toward fitness, and I do use it for that, but I also prefer this type of band for normal daily wear, as the ventilation holes help make it feel less sweaty underneath compare to the regular silicone band.  The problem I had was with finding a suitable color… most of the colors in this style across the various sellers are “loud”, and I prefer something more subtle (but also not just black).  So, I was happy that this seller offered a midnight blue / black option.<br /><br />One thing you’ll notice with this band is that it has an extra slot for the band to pass through before the metal stud that goes into the hole (in addition to the normal slot after the stud, for the excess band to tuck into).  Took a little getting used to, but I appreciate this change, as I do think it will make the band less likely to come loose.  Just be mindful of this, as years of muscle memory might lead you to break this extra slot if you just try to quick remove the band at the end of the day in the exact same manner as you did with the original design (this description will make more sense once you have the band in-hand.<br /><br />Will likely order another to have as an extra, as well as one for my smaller watch when it’s back in stock."
5.0,Great work out bra.
5.0,Bought this for a Halloween costume and one of my kids wears is everyday. We didn’t have any issues with the horns falling or being crooked
5.0,Love them perfect fit and size so far so good
5.0,It's fit perfectly my daughter loves it
5.0,Well wort the money
5.0,"Love them!!! Perfect, as advertised!!!! My little hockey player is a “Bulldog,” so I enjoy wearing these to his games! 😊"
5.0,"Happy with my purchase, great price."
5.0,Love it!! Perfect for my son!!
5.0,"In this blue-light glasses,uh, these is a very good advantage, that is, it is very light and has no weight at all, so there is no burden on it. Since I put it on, I feel that my eyes are not so tired when I look at the computer all day. I also wear them out for they looked good on me. Come with a nice case."
5.0,Pretty and durable. It felt like these arrived moments after I submitted my order!! Highly recommended...would order again.
5.0,I love this keychain! It is priced just right! Great buy!
5.0,This bracelet was beautiful.  Matched my wedding colors teal and bling! Bridesmaid loved them.
5.0,This hat is adorable!  It fits my 2 year old perfectly and looks so cute backwards or forwards!  I will definitely buy more hats from this company.  I couldn’t be happier.
5.0,"Beautiful color! Soft, cozy and cute. I love finding cute T-shirt’s without big logos across the front. We will definitely buy Playroom again."
5.0,"Okay before you say “wait that’s a girl wearing a men’s shirt” just hear me out.<br /><br />Yes, I originally bought this for a man. It was a Christmas gift for brother, but...it came and I felt how soft it was and looked at the cute pattern and just had to try it on.<br /><br />I didn’t intend to keep it for myself. I actually had every intention of wrapping it up and giving it to my brother<br /><br />But it was so soft...and I put it on and it was so cute as a women’s shirt. I couldn’t believe it, i stumbled upon the best kept secret-men’s shirts can be women’s!<br /><br />I wore it to work and had so many girls asking me where I got it. They were shocked when I said it was a men’s shirt. So moral of the story is, yes it’s amazing for a man but if you’re ordering for someone else and you’re female you might end up keeping it."
5.0,"Very flattering! I am a very busty and curvy girl. I love the shape it gives with the ruching under the bust. It can be dressed up or down, good quality- wish it had pockets but just a small complaint. Other than that, it is a little heavier material but gives it that quality feel. BUY IT!"
5.0,I watched the show as a kid and now my kid enjoys it too!<br /><br />The pin is awesome and made my kid super happy. Good quality and a nice addition to the collection.
5.0,So cute bought it for my grand daughter. She loved it😊
5.0,"I picked this chain because it doesn't look serpentine, the kind that tangles in one's hair.<br />It came early and in good packaging. When I took it out of the box, I thought it was going to be thicker. I put it on and have had it on ever since: shower, sleep, etc. doesn't get tangled by itself or in my hair.<br />Thanks!"
5.0,Sorry fit and feel
5.0,so cute and soft!!!
5.0,pleasant bamboo that accentuate the whole sungglasses
5.0,"Nice fit and comfy.  The lace is cheap, but it has a cute look. I haven't washed yet, but I will most likely hang dry as to not ruin the cheap lace."
5.0,"Perfect , pretty, and well made.  I am pleased with my purchase."
5.0,"This polishing cloth has worked wonders on sterling and gold. I used it on a couple of heavily tarnished sterling rings ( I made the mistake of making my own cleaning solution using hydrogen peroxide and it turned the sterling rings nearly black.)<br />After about five minutes of polishing with the center light-colored fabric then buffing with the outer blue fabric, both rings were back to their original, shiny luster!<br />My gold bracelet also came out very clean and shiny after using this cloth.<br />You can't go wrong with this polishing cloth."
5.0,very nice dress. elegant and fit perfect
5.0,"This is a weighty, high-quality and absolutely gorgeous watch–I love it!"
5.0,This is an absolutely gorgeous watch.  Will be giving it as a gift for an avid hunter. A very pleasantly surprised.  The box looks very nice as is for a gift.  Easily can be shipped to someone as a gift without wrapping.  Very stylish and the deer head as you know is a trending thing.  Lightweight and the leather is spectacular .. It looks very expensive and definitely will receive compliments on it.  Not just an every day ordinary watch but extraordinary.. You can't go wrong.  I have bought several of these for gifts.  Wonbee offers many different designs.  I love this and recommend it to anyone looking for an expensive watch at a very inexpensive price.  a zillion stars!
5.0,This lace collar was so easy to put on and blended with my dresses beautifully. I am very happy that I bought it and I'm more than happy to be ordering more.
5.0,Fits awesome as with all Homeyee dresses.
5.0,The perfect bag that met all of the guidelines to enter a secure facility.
5.0,"Deals on jewelry, period. I buy lots of jewelry on amazon, and yes this piece comes with a nice hardy chain, way better than the norm, it makes the piece more masculine which works great for me. I had previously bought and returned this item from another seller, because this is such a better deal. This is the 6th piece of Chuvora jewelry I've purchased on amazon, and it does not disappoint, like all of their jewelry, priced fair, generous chain, prompt shipment, haven't had any problems with my other jewelry so cannot speak to their long term customer service. The pendant is worth every penny, make someone smile."
5.0,this is my dressy purse.  still I am one who loves to have space to organize the things that I feel I just have to have when traveling.  great bargain.
5.0,Used these for a mini cheer camp for my mini cheer leaders ... they where perfect for the event
5.0,"I absolutely love love love this tunic!!  I pair it with a pair of black leggings. You do have to wear a cami under it, but it's such a flattering top.  I always receive compliments whenever I wear it."
5.0,"These are good to sleep in. I kept the pads in and put in disposable nursing pads too. The disposable pads make them look frumpy, so I only wear them with loose clothes going out. For the price though they’re great. I’m a 36dd and got large."
5.0,I love this keychain! My favorite one ever. Its super stylish  and durable and I would buy again.
5.0,Super cute headband that fits my six year old daughters head. Good for a little girl. We did take the bow off which was just glued on.
5.0,Really nice and warm and fits me perfectly
5.0,"It seems unbelievable that there were 500 in this pack because it is so small, but then I found how thin these gloves are.  I tested them with my phone which I cannot use with other gloves as it cannot recognize my fingerprint.  It works with these gloves.  I can easily carry these gloves in my purse also because they group them in smaller packs and have a small hole I can pull the gloves out of so they stay clean in my purse.  This is the kind of glove that does not fit very tightly so they are more comfortable for me and my hands don't sweat like crazy in them.  They are very thin, but don't seem to break as I have been testing them."
5.0,Love this bag. Zipper function is a but cheaply made but still works.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful  looks like it cost $$$. I wear it everyday.
5.0,I adore this jewelry. I have received so many compliments.
5.0,Quick delivery and exactly what I wanted in rose color. Very nice for an understated look. I wear them often.
5.0,"I made bracelets that I sell on my Etsy store PetrichorTrunk. I love how elegant the bracelets came out! I get compliments everywhere I go. Great price, awesome value!"
5.0,My husband love it !
5.0,Exactly the same as the picture! My mistake was that I order accidentally large. Even though that happen I actually like that it’s loose and how it looks on me. It will definitely keep me warm and comfy!
5.0,I have a small chest and sometimes it’s hard to purchase clothes that fit right but this fit perfectly and is so beautiful. Lots of compliments and it’s good quality material.
5.0,"I LOVE THIS BIKINI! It fits perfectly! It is sexy without being inappropriate, and is not bad quality for the price. I will probably buy more colors!!!"
5.0,"I'm an avid gym go-er and weight lifter. I LOVE the quality of 90 degree's leggings. The colors are always so pretty. They have always passed the infamous squat test and are not see through. If they are for you, then you ordered them to small. I have quite a few pair that are over 2 years old and there are no signs of fraying or unraveling or anything. They have outlasted most of the Nike leggings that I have. These are my go to workout legging brand for sure!!"
5.0,"Adorable golf shirt, bright colors and very well made. A bit tighter fit than my other Nike golf shirts, but extremely slenderizing  as well. Very cool for those hot and humid days on the course."
5.0,Divine!
5.0,MANY COMPLIMENTS ON IT. LOVE IT
5.0,My sons friend loved her birthday gift !!
5.0,"These are great. There was an issue with my order at first, but Benevolence LA went out of their way to make things right. Would do business with them again."
5.0,Product is satisfactory. Thanks
5.0,"I am a hot box when it comes to things like socks, enclosed slippers. With these my feet don’t sweat, toes are out. Just love, will purchase again"
5.0,It is sometimes hard to convince a 5 year old that her current shoe is too small.  But she was willing to put these on and wear them as soon as she saw them..................but she won't let mom throw the old ones away yet.
5.0,We purchased this ring as a substitute until we could get a nicer ring. I wore it for a little over a year and had no problems from it. It actually inspired the look of the ring we bought. I’m not into the big bulkier rings so this was perfect! Size fit perfectly as well.
5.0,"I never take these out, only really wear the black ones and they have survived and look the same through many showers and such."
5.0,Love love love the dress will order more!!!
5.0,"Provides a solid, lightweight ""cage"" that protects the fob. Like this so much that I bought a second one in dark grey."
5.0,looks chic and wonderful!
5.0,"Purchased this for my daughter and me, she loved it! She loves sunflowers so this was perfect."
5.0,Love it. Exactly as described. Fit as expected
5.0,"Its very pretty, and fits very well.  I have only worn it twice so I am not sure about tarnishing.  But for the price you can't go wrong"
5.0,Received it today and I love it!  Very comfortable to wear and easy to put on!!!
5.0,I want to buy more colors!! Love the fit and the shirred sides to keep it from riding up.
5.0,Quality product and complimenting color great addition to my collection. Price was good as well.
5.0,"Love these, fit great, good quality I get a lot of compliments and they're definitely conversation starters at the studio"
5.0,"I need a sun hat for Rosacea (no sun), but also uncovers my hair because I also have Psoriasis (needs sun). This hat does both. The only draw back is that the head band only comes in black and it gets hot"
5.0,This is a nice quality pin for the money!
5.0,Fabric is soft-touch. The T-shirt is cotton and comfortable<br /><br />Very nice. It is better than what I saw online pics
5.0,"These are so perfect! You can dress up any shoe, even an old flip-flop! So easy to clip on, and you don’t feel the clip at all. Will definitely buy more!"
5.0,Granddaughter loved it for the tooth fairy. Pretty and just right for a tooth.
5.0,Excellent quality! Love the variety
5.0,Have been trying to find a pair of oversize sunglasses that also suit my round face shape.  This pair suited me perfectly.  Very happy to have found them on Amazon with a much reasonable price.  Got lots of complements so far from wearing them.
5.0,"This is functional and super cute at the same time!  It's the perfect size, will fit 6+ iphone, small wallet, makeup...passport.  Great for travel and fashionable too."
5.0,Great bands for watch. Flexible strong holes for secure fit. Good colors
5.0,ᒪOᐯE IT
5.0,Perfect for running in the spring or fall. Helps keep your air pods in your ears while you run and it’s just not cold enough for a regular winter hat.
5.0,"Is very nice just like the picture I'm 5'3 and 125 to 130<br />I'm size smal and I order a smal and it fits just right<br />Color is just like the picture on meodel, matirerial is great .  I think is just fine .👌🏼"
5.0,Awesome masks
5.0,I purchased this shirt for my son-in-law for Father’s Day.  He is a big Disney fan.  Fits really well and the material is really very nice.
5.0,"They are the cutest little earrings.  My granddaughter can't take them off now,  they got the screw.  Good size , good quality, great shine to it."
5.0,"These are wonderful little gloves.  I am allergic to too much sun and these help protect my hands and wrists.  I cut the tips off so i can feel with my fingers, and they didn't fray."
5.0,This dress fits perfect. I'm 5&#34;3 and 150 lbs. Normally wear a size 10 or 12 and the large fit perfectly. Did not fit like a tent like so many of these do. Skims over your curves without making you look like you're wearing a MooMoo. Could dress it up or down. I just love it.
5.0,amazing fit so comfortable fits all my under gear even the shirt tht goes with it
5.0,I like the belt fit its description.
5.0,"I got this as a little gift for my wife. It came in a little pouch, which was a nice added surprise. It has some weight to it for it being a little bracelet. Overall it is a nice bracelet. Based on the weight I would like to think that this will last. I only gave it to her 2 weeks ago so it is a little early to tell if I am correct. However  she does love it."
5.0,"I purchased these reusable bags to use for my grocery trips. I used to come home with at least 12 plastic bags after every trip from the grocery store, usually ripping as I lugged them into the house or cut by any sharp edges. I love these. They are very large and hold as much as 2 plastic bags would, at least. Now the only truck is to remember to take them into the store with me, which I'm getting better about. But I would definitely purchase again when these wear out."
5.0,Very pleased with the band. The color is exactly as it shows in picture. Will purchase more in different colors
5.0,I LOVE THESE!
5.0,Obsessed with these! I was worried they'd be too heavy but they are perfect.
5.0,"perfect for what I need.  Fit just right, colors are as advertised and it fits.  Nice."
5.0,"These are very comfortable padded cycling gloves. On the outside of the glove there is a pattern of skeleton fingers, it really looks cool when wearing. There is quite some padding both on the palm of hand and on the outside of hand. There is also touch screen ability on several fingers. This is very convenient in case the phone rings while I am wearing these gloves and I can still answer the phone because of that. There is a velcro enclosure and can be tightened as much as want. The material is breathable and keeps my hand comfortable and not too warm on a hot day. I like the extra padding available and that is a nice comfort in case I would need while wearing. The color of my gloves are black and white and red.<br />I purchased these gloves discounted and in exchange I am giving my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,The pajama pants are very comfortable. I like them a lot . Size is true to fit. When first washed experienced no dye bleeding off onto other clothing articles.
5.0,Loved everything 5’5”. 205 lbs.
5.0,"Very pretty, well made bracelet"
5.0,Love the color and Work great
5.0,Price was great and the quality is just as good as expensive ones.

5.0,Great quality but i was more looking for lounging around casual fit sweats but these are great workout sweats
5.0,Brings ever cat lover a smile!
5.0,As part of his birthday gifts!
5.0,"My Lady of Mount CarmEl it's one of the most beautiful rosaries I've ever seen in my life, and it's so wonderful knowing that it was handmade With Love by Mexican Artisans who are obviously really talented. If I hadn't shopped on Amazon I would have never found that item like this and that's why I love Amazon."
5.0,"This watch band is a great product.  Feels soft, and looks great."
5.0,This was a gift for my wife .she loved it .and it was a great price
5.0,"Wings are very soft, cute and had a very speedy delivery with prime! They have lots in stock, I bought a bulk and everyone liked them very much. Sparkles shed just a bit, but not a big issue."
5.0,"It is comfortable, cool,and smooth"
5.0,"I have worn this watch for at least the last five years. I have tried others but always come back to this one. This is my favorite watch and I wear it everyday. It's super thin, very comfortable and tells me the time and date. It's nothing fancy but it's all I need and the only watch I wear.  I need a watch that I don't have to worry about damaging or getting wet and for under ten bucks, it's perfect."
5.0,It’s perfect for my daughter’s dance class. Great quality.
5.0,"Pretty boots, will purchase again"
5.0,Everywhere I go I am complimented on them and ask where did you get your glasses.  They are comfortable and look great!  This is my second set since I had to increase the strength.  They looked so nice and I work on the computer and write all day at work and the work well!  Buy them you will love them!  And you can match your outfits!
5.0,Fits perfect with the exception that the sleeves were a little too tight. Nice material though.
5.0,"Love it, it's color and fit are perfect and if it had been just a tad bit thinner, it would have matched my original wedding band, but it is perfect."
5.0,I wear it all the time with a necklace I got for Christmas. It fits my necklace very well and is very comfortable.
5.0,My kids love these. They are super awesme.
5.0,I need a new bag and had a hard time trying to find one like this. My bag was falling apart and when I found this bag I was so happy to fined this one. Having the 3 pocket really help. I'm able put everything I had in my bag before with out it causing a problem of taking everything out. I now have a spot for my phone. '
5.0,My husband loved these socks. He wears them all the time.
5.0,I bought this for my husband because he is a big Ohio State fan. He loves it! Nice leather and nice design.
5.0,Looks great and holds my clock perfectly. A great way to protect my chess clock
5.0,This was a gift & it was perfect! He loved
5.0,Great quality and beautiful design. Love it. Fits great. Highly recommend.
5.0,Beautiful 😎
5.0,Love these flipflops! Just did 10 days in Disney and wore them everyday in the parks!
5.0,"I have balked at purchasing one of these for a while because although I would like a more streamlined appearance, the heat here in Texas is rather brutal and wearing a waist trainer after March/April is likely to cause a bout of clothes claustrophobia and a frantic search for a restroom where you can remove said garment and wonder how in the world you are going to carry this around for the rest of your day if you are out and about.<br /><br />This waist trainer, however, has the perforated material, which I had always poo-pooed as potentially disastrous, as there's NO WAY this could work as intended, it's has to be flimsy, right?<br /><br />WRONG.<br /><br />Good lord, this is an honest to goodness, works as intended, wow, this dress looks really nice now waist trainer.  The material is sturdy.  The perforated material allows for air flow.  And I can stand it in the Texas heat.  It's one of those 'I-can't-believe-I-waited-so-long-to-try-this' purchases.  Add to that the unbelievably reasonable price for the quality of this product, and this purchase is a no-brainer.  I followed the size recommendations and it was spot on.  Great deal of stretch, so in addition to excellent support, it will grow, or rather UNgrow with you as you streamline your physique.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend. Great product, great price, timely delivery."
5.0,"My husband is a very large man with diabetes and bad hips, since he started wearing these socks his hips don’t hurt as much and the burning in his feet due to diabetes isn’t nearly as severe."
5.0,Can't wait to wear this dress......as soon as it stops raining.....whenever that is!
5.0,Looked great. Exactly as described.
5.0,Gorgeous shoes and fits perfectly. My princess love them so much we get to play dress up every day.<br />I will definitely order another pair in future.
5.0,Awesome knee pads! Seem to be comfortable on her!
5.0,These are super comfortable. I do wear them all day on stay-home days.
5.0,Very comfortable says hubby. Very good looking says me.
5.0,"So I bought this hat for two reasons. I love bleach and I needed a hat lol! The first one had the pattern a little off but I still loved it and use it as a everyday hat for work and general use. The other one is perfect for cosplaying! The hats fit very well. A bit snug around the head but other than that they are awesome. Some other reviewers said people love this hat (bleach fan or not) they all ask me where I got the hat. Sadly at the time of writing this, the vendor/ seller has them out of stock. DEFINITELY keep an eye on this item, if it returns and buy asap!"
5.0,My daughter love these shoes.
5.0,"Very pretty green dress.  It has stretch & the fabric is comfortable.  The buttons are just decorations (not functional).  This does have a zipper in back, but the dress is easy enough to slip on without it."
5.0,"Love the pants and the color. Pant is very flattering, as well. This is my second pair and I am sure I will be buying more!"
5.0,My son wanted glow lights for his bike and these were perfect!
5.0,"I get so many compliments on these. The screws stay in place, are comfortable to wear and the pack is cheap. I will be buying more as I size up. Came right on time. No complaints!"
5.0,Omg this has saved my life and many fashionable mishaps! it has toned my body and feels great.
5.0,The tights are great for either working out or simply day to day activity. They are made of strong material and keep everything in place.
5.0,Adorable. I bought the pink catface version and have gotten lots of comments on them. They do get dirty/scuffed pretty easily because of the fabric but so far I've been able to clean it easily with a slightly damp paper towel.
5.0,Excellent OEM replacement for my Giro cycling shoes.  Very easy to install.  Works perfectly.  Shipping took a little longer than expected but it wasn't a hassle for me.
5.0,"Like it! it’s perfect for the gym, the only thing that I would’ve liked better is if it had a bigger hoodie"
5.0,It looks just like the picture!  Very soft and cute.  I am very happy
5.0,Great lanyard that holds keys very well.
5.0,I thought I had to buy a brand new pair because mine were so scratched. I came across this product and said why not?I could not get my original glass lenses out and took them to Lens Crafters and they were kind enough to change them out.Hint:they used heat.Very pleased.
5.0,These were soft and looked so cute
5.0,Very good seller and product
5.0,I used this item for a hat pin in my collection.
5.0,Great quality. I thought it was a bit smaller than I was expecting. My son usually swims in 12 month shirts so I bought this in 12 months hoping to layer underneath however I feel it's a little snug even with just a light tshirt under. Good thing is it is really warm so heavy layering probably isnt really necessary.
5.0,My kid love the caracteres he got
5.0,Cute enough to just throw on and go
5.0,Love it! Bought 2 sizes up like the comments suggested and it's great! Very flattering! Will buy again in other colors.

5.0,Very nice.  I usually wear a small- medium ...  got a large fits great.... like the model....it you want it a bit looser...get 2 sizes up. I like this vest because it's not heavy....  will be ordering a diff color :)

5.0,"I ordered a size up for a more comfortable fit, and they were perfect!"
5.0,"This is very good product, recommend to everyone"
5.0,The sleeves are a little funky but I found this shirt to be very flattering on me. The colors are nice. The fabric is breathable. I did notice when I wear a dark bra under the white shirt the color shows through a little.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:76aebaca356b313a2f6344d5602f237c]] Epic gamer
5.0,Such a pretty set. It is dainty and delicate.
5.0,Adorable. Love it
5.0,I use this baselayer for hiking/camping during late fall and winter. The 250 weight is adequate for outdoor activities at temps lower than 50 degrees. I layer with a down vest and/or light jacket for temperatures into the teens and it works well. Even when I sweat the smell doesn't linger. The fabric is comfortable and the fit is what I expect from the brand. I'm 5'8 and usually wear a 2-4 in street clothes; I wear a size S in Smartwool. I also love that it is tumble dry low :-)
5.0,Gave this as a gift to a friend and she absolutely loved it and wears it every day.

5.0,work great in my frequent travel bag! and I gave them as a gift!
5.0,This was what I really needed and wanted to have.  The embroidery is of a menorah and underneath it is the fish representing Christianity which is interesting.
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous and perfect for Summer! I am going to wear some shorts underneath just in case since it’s a wrap dress. I love that the straps are adjustable, and the front has a button/snap if you are bigger busted or just want to show a little more cleavage. I’m a big girl and the 2X fit me perfectly!"
5.0,They are perfect for the cold weather
5.0,"Ordered this visor for my wife who likes to have her eyes shaded in the summer, but does not want the full covering of a baseball cap.  Very nice looking visor."
5.0,"I got 2 hoodies from this company and they both look exactly like the pictures and the sizes are accurate and the dinosaurs on the nana hoodie are cute and have beautiful coloring, I can't wait to give them to my parents for Christmas."
5.0,Absolute love this just like the picture very comfortable a little small but It turned out to be a good size. The only thing is that if u are gonna buy this sunglass check the size.

5.0,I love it. It fits very well... I'm 5'5&#34; 150lbs. It also goes well with pretty much anything... Very stylish. I would say it is a very good value!
5.0,This dress has pockets need I say more ladies?!
5.0,"Perfect length and fit. Lining is much shorter than the skirt, but it's awesome!!"
5.0,My son loves them he changes out the decorations often.
5.0,"Brought for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loaded it up with her little valuables right after she opened the box. I guess ""Sweetie"" (my Grandma name) did alright!!"
5.0,I love this wallet. It is small but has a lot of carry space for cards and cash. The passport holding slot is perfect. Ideal for when I am traveling
5.0,For reference I’m 5.2 with 118 pounds and 34C bra.<br />I liked it and the quality is good. I got size S for loose look but Xs could have been ok too.<br /> Very  classy and nice vest.<br /><br />It does look nice with a button  down  white shirt.  Thanks.
5.0,My friend wears this a lot!
5.0,Very cute! Got it for my daughter.. loved it.
5.0,Nice boits
5.0,Better than I hoped for! So worth it.
5.0,This is a very nice necklace and an extreme bargain for the price it was sold to me for.  This would make a lovely gift or I will just keep it.  Not sure yet.
5.0,This is a great product for kids. I would not use for high school aged or adults.  We used these in our flag football games and they were great. I wish they came in a bag to keep them in & possibly other color flags rather than just yellow & red. But that’s not a big deal. I’d purchase again.
5.0,"Bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas. The concept is amazing, but the shirts run on the smaller side. The led light is the perfect touch but when it’s turned on it buzzes. Overall a very cool novelty."
5.0,great we bought them for our 4 year old. he doesn't like loud noises. he loved seeing the blue angels and then we were able to stay out and watch fireworks this 4th with these.
5.0,I am 5’9 225 and normally wear a 14/16. I purchased the 16 they fit great! With wiggle room and the waist. I will order a few more pair for work in a 14  Great buy!
5.0,Cover my head!  Stupid question!
5.0,"Very good quality, however the sizing chart is very misleading and the first pair were HUGE. Ended up ordering two sizes down the second time."
5.0,I love it!! The key necklace is so cute and I love the chain! Great quality!
5.0,It was a gift for a special lady and she loved it.
5.0,"I love my dress, it's beautiful."
5.0,She really loved this one the most.
5.0,So far so good I bought it as a gift. I did open up the package and hold the watch it feels heavy and well-made. Actually much nicer looking and feeling that I was imagining it would be. So far I think it is a great watch especially for the price.
5.0,Super cute t shirt. Much softer then I expected.  Great fit. Great quality
5.0,Very loose did not stay tight on my wrist
5.0,My wife loved these! &#34;You can tighten them to your ear so they stay put!&#34;
5.0,"Maui Jim are the best sunglasses.  Great polorized lenses - this specific model is very light, polycarbonate (shatter proof) lenses and light arm pieces.  Lenses are great, very comfortable overall.  Would buy again."
5.0,Cool looking lots of compliments
5.0,"I'm a nurse and was in desperate need of the &#34;perfect&#34; work bag. I looked all over the internet and stumbled upon this one. It is made for dancers but wow.....is it the PERFECT bag for my job. It is the perfect size. Not to big, not too small. Fits my lunch bag and all my work stuff. It has a very handy outside zipper for my stethoscope. The other side has an outside zipper that has a vented compartment that I think is meant for ballet shoes. I haven't found a use for this yet, but I'm SO excited that after so much time looking I found the one!!! My only complaint is that it only comes in black. It would have been fun to have a color/print. 5 stars nonetheless."
5.0,Absolutely adore these. Had to get the medium since the smalls were sold out but I'm glad I did! My boyfriend is 5'7&#34; 135 lbs and they fit him great. I'm 5'10&#34; and they're long enough for me as well!
5.0,Quick and easy slip on shoes I have a four-year-old daughter in these are the perfect shoes for when we need to run to the store or go to the pool very cute and versatile would definitely buy again by the way very true to size💕
5.0,"I love the lense size and frame.  You can usually find the larger sized ones, but I had to search hard to find this PERFECT size for us!❤️I’d order again!!!"
5.0,"I fit her just like the picture and she's small like me, she put it on right out the bag and wore it for the rest of the night! I wish I would of ordered one loll but ill just borrow hers!! ;)"
5.0,For my 12 yr old girl...now doesn't come off. Bought a large fits her perfect.
5.0,This was a gift for my nephew since he has a Frenchie. He loved it. 🥰
5.0,"Bought for wife, she says: Very well made and comfy, but it was a little too tight on the arms and chest for me. I am 5'8&#34;, 15&#34; biceps and 42&#34; bust. I ordered a size 12. I returned it, will buy later when I go down in size tho. I really liked it. It's a great buy at that price.&#34;"
5.0,"Recently I became obsessed with cow print. Since giving birth to my second baby I've been producing more than enough milk and these cute little pijamas are perfect! So soft and fits great! Some offers the styles are crop tops. I choose the one that says ""mooochin"" on the top and it came perfectly. Fits exactly as expected and super comfortable! Will recommend."
5.0,Strap is perfect for anyone who plays guitar. Came in exactly how it stated
5.0,"The size small fit great!  I am 5'5, 115 lbs, 34 A bust.  Nice flattering shape, highly recommend!"

5.0,Love this product perfectly fit.<br />Quality material thank you Amazon
5.0,I bought these for my grandson who is 2 and loves Bubble Guppies. They are super soft and I love that they come with both shorts and long pants. The colors are so bright and vivid. I am happy with this purchase and would definitely purchase again.
5.0,"Hi everybody!!! ***For reference, I’m 5’3, 135-140 lbs, and a 34ddd.*** So I previously purchased the Neleus compression tanks. I got them in a size small - they are perfect. I read reviews to get these long sleeve tops in a bigger size than normal... but if you want your top to be FITTED/TIGHT, then get your normal size. If you want your top to be A LITTLE LOOSE OR OVERSIZED, THEN you can size up in that case.<br /><br />Like I stated I’m 5’3, 135-140 lbs, and a 34ddd. A size SMALL in these long sleeve tops fit me AMAZING. They are thick and a good material, and are good at compression. You can’t go wrong with these for layering in the colder months!!! Love them and now i’d Like to purchase the t-shirts since I already have the tanks and now the long sleeve ones.<br /><br />Thank you NELEUS!!!! You have acquired a loyal customer!"
5.0,Good product for the price. Bought for my son and he loves it.
5.0,"True to size, love it."
5.0,"As described, wish the star fish was bigger but love it. Thank you. Many more sea items wanted, keep them coming."
5.0,Cute dress! The fabric is pretty sturdy yet comfortable.
5.0,"OH MY GOODNESS!! FINALLY - My 12 year old son wears a 15 wide shoe and we literally have been searching for socks for the last year. I am no longer able to buy in a retail store setting locally and my sister told me about the company that makes these and we gave a pack a try and YES-YES-YES!! FINALLY socks that fit. He is not diabetic, he just has very large feet and giant tree trunks for legs. While socks from retail stores for large shoe size fit the foot - it was getting it around the ankle that was the chore. NO MORE! (I promise you, his ankles and legs are enormous :) he had to WORK to get socks around the ankles."
5.0,This is a great dress! I got it in multiple colors.
5.0,Bought this for a friend for her birthday. It’s beautiful and comes with cleaners and gift box. She has gotten lots of compliments since receiving it. Must buy
5.0,It’s very nice and the quality it super nice.<br />Used it for my daughters baby shower and I’m sure my granddaughter will look beautiful in it once she wears it.
5.0,"With a heat wave that hit Florida while on the beach this was the best purchase we could have made. decided to try this one since it had the back cabana cover that could be raise or left down for extra shade. setup was a breeze, one person could actually do it. I would recommend 100%!"
5.0,Love these leggings!! Fit is as expected and the side pockets are super convenient!
5.0,Loved very nice fit and soft
5.0,Really cool top to wear at gym since it’s winter and a little bit cold to wear a tank top.

5.0,Very nice toy my daughter is very pleased with it
5.0,Just got google stadia and this works perfectly to put my control and a few cords inside with no problem.

5.0,Super cute jacket!  Fits as expected.
5.0,"This is a sexy outfit on me. I actually ordered a small, but the company sent me a medium. I really should be thanking them. This outfit runs small. The medium fits me. It was just a bit big around the bra area. But I rock it anyway and it looks great on me."
5.0,Another great looking Olevs minimalist watch. I already have the Black/Black and the Blue/Black. A great watch for the price. For casual or formal wear. Thanks!
5.0,very nice summer top
5.0,Hubby has worn this shirt several times and he’s only had it for a week. Great fit...normal sizing.
5.0,Very nice Quality very satisfied with my purchase
5.0,This was perfect and just as described. Very nice quality. :)<br /><br />I really enjoy the lace detail! The chains add a nice touch. Everything came attached as normal. Well packaged.<br />This will be more on multiple occasions!<br />I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,The sleeves where a bit long but everything else was just perfect! Loved this outfit!
5.0,"The fabric is light, soft and stretchy. Fits great and looks good"
5.0,My husband wears these while he does yard work and also when we travel.  He says they are so comfortable that he can barely tell he's wearing a ring.  We didn't really like the color selections.  He only wears the gray one.  So far it's lasted a few weeks.
5.0,"Perfect for wedding reception change, If you're taller the dress may run a little short on you but still a great buy. I'm a size 18 and ordered a XL."
5.0,Just runs a little baggy and long
5.0,I ordered a size up since I am pregnant. It’s a great and elegant buy
5.0,Lo recomiendo!?
5.0,Reviewed before
5.0,"I love this purchase! Its my favorite dress in my closet! The fit is perfect. Its great quality, soft and figure flattering! will buy this again!"
5.0,Love it was just right
5.0,"Fashionable & functional. I used this during a month long trip to europe and never worried once about pickpockets.<br /><br />I liked having the option of using the coin purse separately, as it is just big enough to fit a passport, cash, cards, and my iPhone 6. There were nights out when I wanted to carry less and used the coin purse on its own or inside a smaller clutch-sized purse. Great to have the peace of mind to know my passport and credit card info would stay safe against scanners.<br /><br />I highly recommend this!"
5.0,Good quality. Holds up with washing.  Looks sharp.
5.0,"Got this as a gift for my long distance friend. It's uper cute however the ""leaf"" looks more like a maple leaf. I am not to bothered by it as I know she will love it."
5.0,Beautiful !!!!!!!!!
5.0,Really nice dress for the price
5.0,"Product exactly as described! If I needed them again in the future, I’d purchase them again."
5.0,Super cute. Good material. Foot part looks kind of small but hopefully will stretch to fit a man
5.0,"This is a great deal, it looks exactly the same in person. I had no issues with skin discoloration from the metal. It's very ornamental and pretty and it has little hooks on the back of it linking the scales together that you could use to add on other things if you have a crafty nature. It looks beautiful even with just a plain white longsleeve."
5.0,Omg! I get so many compliments on my sunglasses. Very expensive looking and great quality.
5.0,Just what I expected! Very nice!
5.0,Good for wear anytime as glasses cut glare in all levels of light.
5.0,My pup loves to jump in and go for a night out on the town.
5.0,"I ordered these because of the way they flatten the belly area and fit so nicely.  I have another pair (can't remember where I bought them, probably TJ Maxx).  That pair, which I haven't worn all that much have developed a tear along a seam.  I had to sew it; looks like careless workmanship.  Hopefully this new pair will not do that.  My major complaint is the price.  I think they are way overpriced."
5.0,"If you ever owned the HK Army Hardline pants and noticed how stiff and uncomfortable they are, I recommend you order a pair of the HK Freeline Pants instead!!!  Not only do the Freeline pants let me bend down and crouch with ease, these pants are a lot lighter, and has vents in the right places.  I also am able to wear my knee pads with these unlike the Hardline pants.  Finally, a pants that delivers comfort, breathability and function."
5.0,"This is seriously the best Xmas sweatshirt I have ever owned.  She-Ra was my idol as a child and this sweatshirt was a no-brainer as soon as I saw it.  I purchased a Medium and it fit true to size, and quick shipping!  Would definitely purchase again!"
5.0,Darling item
5.0,My husband loves this shirt!  He has the same style in Firebird.
5.0,I really like the colors/variety. Have gifted to friends with Young Living Oils and they’ve loved them!!  I have small wrists so some were too loose- wish there was a size option.
5.0,"I saw these at a show store but they didn't have the size I needed.  The fit was perfect or as I expected it to be based on the other sandles I had tried on.  Wore them the whole day, no issues, no soar spots.  I love them so far."
5.0,These gloves are really nice quality and super sleek. Not too think but very warm. They run true to<br />Size. I love that you can text & use your phone while out in the cold with them on!
5.0,Houseoflux is awesome! I purchased this clutch and it was shipped the same day!<br />Came in nicely wrapped! Super satisfied!
5.0,"Very nice and elegant ear rings, good quality."
5.0,This looks just as advertised. Nice color. The tools included make it easy to switch out old band. Would buy again.
5.0,"I love this necklace it looks great on. I wish there were earrings to match, but I love it."
5.0,Love it and hope to grab one in another color. Looks great alone and with a pair of tights!
5.0,Purchased as a gift for my nonbinary teen. They LOVED it. They said it was very comfortable and not too tight or loose. The material is a little different than others but very soft and thick so your not able to see through it. They loved that it can be worn as a regular tank under an open flannel. Will be purchasing another.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for..Very pretty.
5.0,This shirt is the perfect design and fit.
5.0,It’s a pretty skirt. True color.
5.0,Such a sweet necklace. My daughter is going to love it. I love the quality of the item and super happy with it overall! Would totally recommend.
5.0,arrives i great condition.
5.0,"This suit fits fantastic. I love it high quality fabric and so well put together. I wear a small and bought a small...buy with confidence, you won't be disappointed. It's beautiful"
5.0,Love that I finally have a great clip on hoop earrings at a great price!!! Bought in gold too. Very comfortable.
5.0,"My son loves these.  Although some reviews say the lights stop working, we've had them 3 months now and still going strone."
5.0,"This is my go-to dress for church.  It fits me so well and flatters my hourglass shape.  I'm a professional singer, and I've worn it to perform in, twice, once for a Christmas church function and once for a funeral.  Lovely and tasteful."
5.0,I love wearing it
5.0,"Gorgeous. I received so many compliments when I wore it. It is lovely, good quality stitching (no loose threads hanging everywhere) , washes easily, dries swiftly, color doesn’t run, light weight, doesn’t crease too much, packable, etc. I highly recommend it."
5.0,I purchased these to make a hook and toss game and used the few leftovers I had for party favors. They come in two separate pieces that you have to attach but was no big deal. The quality was good for the purpose I bought them for.
5.0,"These are so cute and are the perfect size.  They are not too small, not too big and are not heavy.  I love the print."
5.0,Can't say they are a Lulu dupe because I do not have this style of a jogger but they are the comfiest pants I own. They are not too tight but are still a jogger feel.
5.0,A real cute top that fits just right
5.0,Purchased this watch for my nephew and he couldn’t be happier. Accurate and reliable great first watch.
5.0,Pretty awesome set. Love the vibrant color and the high quality silk. This is my 5th bowtie and pocket square set from SetSense and I plan on getting more in the future.
5.0,I like all the pockets so you dont need to use another pack while walking and the protection of expensive binoculars.
5.0,Really like the pambra liners. Have use them several times and I'm please with my purchase. Thanks!
5.0,"I was pleased to find some bike shorts offered in bright colors that also had side pockets.  The fit seems to be slightly on the slim side—-I am tall and usually wear a 6 in stretchy pants or maximum an 8 in non-stretchy pants.  I wanted a snug but not tight fit—-which is what I got by ordering a LARGE.  I only have one pair of these so I can’t comment on the “size inconsistency” issue raised by some.<br /><br />Now as for the sensitive issue of how revealing these are…..I would say that the fabric is thick enough as long as you choose to wear underwear.  If you don’t, then the chips will fall where they may.  I found the crotch (yes I said it) to be a tiny bit revealing which is no problem if you wear a long shirt. As for me, I might go up a size for the next color  in order to alleviate this issue….although that will mean that the waist will likely be too loose for me.<br /><br />All in all, bike shorts aren’t for anyone who is shy about showing their curves—so I think these are pretty much as advertised. Again, I appreciate the bright colors + TWO side pockets, so all good here.<br /><br />P.S.  The side pockets are large enough for a mid-sized phone, IMO.  A large phone would likely fit, but might have a tendency to want to pop out.  There is a small waist pocket for a key or similar, like most of these type of shorts."
5.0,Great value. Love the reading glasses. Very convenient. They come with a case and cleaning cloth.
5.0,"Love this shirt, very stylish!!"
5.0,"As usual, Stance sock lived up to their reputation.<br />Good enduring colors woven in to socks, not printed on them.<br />The patented toe box oven weave kept my toes warm all day even though my feet got a little wet.<br />The colors and designs on these sock cheer me up a bit...  not the most important thing, but fun,<br />and they are easy to launder .<br />I thought $20+ for socks was too high a price until I tried these. Having comfy feet all day is really nice."
5.0,"This bracelet has unique beading, is not too chunky and can be matched up and layered with a variety of other bracelets. I loved it so much I ordered the jade bracelet exactly like it!"
5.0,Love it..easy to adjust .
5.0,This shirt is well-made and the colours are nice and bright. My Lego geek son-in-law will love it! (Unless my daughter steals it!)
5.0,"When I wear this, people can't help but laugh and/or smile!  Some say it's creepy and they make me take it off lol.  Overall, people love it, and if you have to wear a face covering, it might as well be fun!"
5.0,I bought to wear with my dress that I also purchased from amazon to wear to my daughters wedding 10/19/19
5.0,We are excited to have them for our guests in the spa.
5.0,Well made. Looks cute and functional
5.0,"This top is very comfortable to wear. I also received several compliments when I wore it. I got the purple one. I would like to purchase another one. I have a 42” chest, 36” waist, weigh about 197# and am 5’5”. I ordered the XL and it fit perfectly."
5.0,This necklace is so cute and beautiful. My granddaughter is going to love it!
5.0,"Love love love!! This skirt!! This company is wonderful! I got the skirt days before expected and the quality is fantastic! Although, I ordered a small and it is way to big on me! I'm 5'4 and about 115 lbs and it sits on my hips. I wanted it to be at the smallest part of my waist. However it's such a beautiful skirt I will be getting it altered:) the material is sturdy and stretchy and it goes just past my knees. This is the first time I have ever ordered clothes off Amazon and I have to say I'm not disappointed!!"
5.0,The price and the quality of the material.

5.0,There's a lot to be said about a crop top that just fits and flatters - and this shirt does just that. I can wear it with jeans for a casual look or I can layer it with a cardigan and leggings for a relaxed lounge look. Really the possibilities are endless. I'm so glad I found this brand.
5.0,What a big hit everybody wants to only us. Well worth the price great material. I should’ve bought more
5.0,Very nice shirt. You can dress up or dress down
5.0,Nice . Love it
5.0,"An absolutely great product.  Have some issues right now that keep me from shopping in town conveniently, so I turn to Amazon.  The problem arises when I go to my post office box to pick up my orders.  Awkward to carry boxes to the car so must rely on the post master or some kind stranger in the post office.  Now I whip this little gadget out and open it faster than I can type this sentence.  Lightweight, balanced, relatively easy to wheel across the gravel parking lot.  This is not a heavy duty product; don't overdo it."
5.0,My girl is in love with this tutu dress.  I like that it has a sheath under the tutu part
5.0,I like the adjustment strap under arms to hold the collar in place.
5.0,Excellent quality fit and fabric
5.0,"Wore this to my niece's wedding and got LOTS of compliments on it.  It is thin, so be prepared to wear a slip with it.  Looked great with my navy blue sweater that had this same color trim on it."
5.0,Love this necklace! So trendy and cute. Goes with everything. Not too chunky but dainty either.
5.0,Good quality and look great!
5.0,"Nice and soft fabric. My husband is usually a 2x but ordered a 3x, glad we did."
5.0,Son love these.
5.0,"Great fitting belt, tightens and loosens super easily with the clasp. Easily my new favorite belt, honestly will use this over traditional belts from now on"
5.0,It was exactly what I wanted. The hoddie is soft and comfortable
5.0,Not great but worth the money.
5.0,"I purchased this because I have very thin skin and a new puppy who grabs onto my arms when we play. She was constantly tearing my skin. These covers are perfect. They are thick enough that her claws don’t go through. However, in hindsight, I wish I had ordered gloves too. I gave a low rating in warmth because I didn’t notice any difference and didn’t purchase them for warmth."
5.0,"Super cute, comfy. My 2y/o  son loves Elmo and we have to wash these frequently so that he has the option available to wear them since enjoys picking out his own clothes."
5.0,"Great fitting and looking cap, love the embroidered logo."
5.0,As described. Would buy from seller again.
5.0,Love these! Fit my heels nicely and really helped from sinking into the grass.
5.0,Love the pattern and the fit. I own three of your dresses.
5.0,I got these for my daughters Paris themed birthday party and the mini Eifeltowers were an absolute hit
5.0,I ordered this for my four-year-old to wear to her school program. Then chose a different dress for the program. And save this dress for one for family Christmas. We got so many compliments from people out in public and from our family. I added red leggings with sparkles that made it look extra Christmasy. I would buy it again in a heartbeat is such a cute dress. I’m going to try to find another excuse for her to wear it again before winter is over!
5.0,Thank you!  This owl charm is perfect for my niece and it arrived in plenty of time to be sent in a package for the family before Christmas.  Its high quality and color will be cute added to her bracelet collection.
5.0,Perfect for travel and errands
5.0,I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my aunt and its a hit.
5.0,Got as a gift for someone and they loved it!
5.0,"This product stretched my new harness boots. I have a high instep and the boot is comfortable now.  put stretcher in with a cloth on bottom for extra height, then inserted stretcher and put heat on it with hair dryer and tightened a little more. Works great"
5.0,Fits as is sized. Very fun costume!
5.0,"Well built, feels good. Edges are nice. Smaller then I expected even though I have a small wrist. Watch I bought it for comes in two weeks, i'll update my review when I put it on it. So far so good. Got it the day after i ordered it."
5.0,They are nothing like they said.  They are not warm socks.  They are nylon and junk!
5.0,The shirt is comfortable and stretchy! It’s definitely thicker than I expected which I’m okay with. Sizing is pretty accurate.
5.0,I got these for my sister for Christmas and she says they fit perfectly and feel really comfortable.
5.0,"This really was one of the few things that my stepmom really loved and even asked for more of.  When I tried to reorder it a few months ago, I was really disappointed that the seller had doubled the price from $14.95, to $29.95, which was a bit out of the budget for this.  Worth buying!"
5.0,It’s an awesome dress for the low price . I plan on buying several more in different colors
5.0,Eye glass frames were fantastic.  Just how i thought they would be. Great price too.  Saved over a 100.00 on the exact frames in one of the vision stores.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:b87a034c35a70531287600c859c153a4]] I love these ears. They add such character to my everyday wear. I wouldn't suggest wearing them to bed as they are hard to sleep in. Also keep them away from dirty places because the fur does pick that up and will change color. They are easy to clean. Not sure how long the metal will last in the band area.
5.0,"I like this shirt very much. They do run a bit small, which means they are NOT true to size. I bought a size larger and it fits me perfectly."
5.0,Great quality product!  Definitely worth the price!
5.0,Comfy material.  Well made. Have received numerous compliments when I wear it.
5.0,The perfect addition for my business Photoshoot… the quality was great for the price and it gave us an additional pop making the photos stand out.
5.0,Very comfortable! Very cute! Worth the money and it makes you look a little classy/vintage Look
5.0,I like how it fits me. Very soft fabric and doesn’t get wrinkled
5.0,"This is my second purchase from honey cat.  Not only does the jewelry arrive quickly, it always surpasses my expectations.  I love this necklace--it is small and feminine, exactly as advertised.  My one suggestion for honeycat would be to have the chain be an adjustable length which would entail including a few more loops at the end.  Otherwise, these are ideal pieces."
5.0,Fits great my niece is 18 and 5ft even 98-100 pounds comes to her belly button. Fast delivery and item was as described.
5.0,Warm and cuddly material.  Love this jacket.
5.0,Soft flows fabric that is good quality. The pattern is a beautiful pink that is very complimentary on my skin tone (medium/golden). Got many compliments!

5.0,Se ve muy bonito y buena calidad.
5.0,"Perfect fit, length, color, everything!"

5.0,Very much satisfied
5.0,They perform as expected. They're a pair of pants.

5.0,Fit great and is comfortable.  Have used it in the pool for water exercise and have used it while walking on the treadmill.  Fit and length are perfect and as expected.
5.0,"I love winter but hate being cold! This hat is superb! In teh coldest weather, my head, ears, cheeks and chin are very warm on cold winter days when I walk the dogs. I am a US size 7 and 3/8. I ordered the medium and it fit perfect. I like the leather shell as opposed to the all over fur hats because fur hats get wet when it is snowing. The leather shell wipes dry easily."
5.0,"This is just like the picture, very pleased!"
5.0,I bought this expecting a mediocre galaxy hat. I was completely impressed by the appearance and then I felt it. I didn't know it was 100% polyester when I bought it. It's ridiculously silky. New favorite hat.
5.0,We received our item very quickly and it is very well made. I don't have to worry about my son chewing through it or something coming off of it.The silicone is very thick (not too thick just the perfect thickness actually) and my son loves to chew on it. This is great for children with sensory issues (my son has Sensory Processing Disorder) so its nice to have something fashionable to wear around that is not only super cute but also very functional when he has an the sensory need episode whither at home or out shopping. Highly recommend!

5.0,Buen material y bonita forma
5.0,"Great skirt with great material. I don’t like wearing skirts, so having the shorts built in was nice to have. Came with creases because of how it was folded in the package, but they came out easily with a hair straightener (maintains the pleats easier)"
5.0,"Love this necklace, I have the bracelet and wanted the matching necklace.  The price was alot higher at the store. Was a little nervous thinking it would not be as nice. It was the same exact necklace for alot cheaper price"
5.0,My grandson loves these sneakers.
5.0,Perfect Panty for open bottom girdle sexy
5.0,"I’m impressed, I wasn’t expecting the quality this garment delivers, I’m pleasantly surprised. Great fit, very nice look with a pair of boots and jeans. Would buy again..."

5.0,Got this for my daughter who has to wear an ID at school and she loves elephants.
5.0,"My husband is in the wine and spirit industry.  He is tall, so the long handle is a benefit to him, so he can walk straight.  This bag is made very well, gives him extra zipper/pockets for paperwork, pens, etc.  The cooler packs are a nice addition to the bag and make everything look very clean, neat and put together - all very professional when you are in the industry.<br />You must be able to lift several pounds, as the case gets very heavy when filled with 12 bottles to put in the back of a vehicle or walk up stairs.<br />The bag overall is amazing!<br />Now I'm looking for a 6 bottle carrier on wheels that is tall enough to handle bottles that have been re-corked and you are able to go all day visiting customers to taste wine without the wine spilling in between car rides and up and down stairs.  :-)"
5.0,Very flattering for women with hips. It's not see through it's nice and comfy.
5.0,"Omg! This is now my favorite top. It’s juat as pictured, summer friendly and super cute!!"

5.0,Bought for an elder friend that likes Old Bay. He saw someone with same shirt on and ask me to look for it. Shirt is very well made and he is very happy. I did size up and he said he was glad due to the cotton.
5.0,"These stainless steel mesh bands provide a nice upgrade from the silicone strap for a Samsung Galaxy 42mm watch.<br /><br />Having a clasp, rather than just a magnetic closure, provides additional security from accidently knocking the watch off your arm.<br /><br />All three colors are pleasing, materials and construction are good, and the inclusion of the tool to help remove / install the bands is a nice extra.<br /><br />Review of LESVIEO 3 Pack Bands Compatible with Samsung Galaxy Watch 42mm/Watch 3 41mm/Active 40mm/Active 2 40mm 44mm, 20mm Adjustable Stainless Steel Mesh Wristband Sport Loop Women Men"

5.0,"finally glasses that truly fit a child!  these fit my 4yo perfectly with only a slight slippage and they fit me nicely without causing a headache due to the tightness.  of course, I didn't wear them long. :)  these were a must for the poodle skirt outfit.  they certainly completed the look and really set my daughter's outfit apart from the rest of the class."
5.0,"I’m really happy with my purchase. I was hesitant.<br /><br />I am about 150 lbs, 5’6 and it fits me perfectly<br />I wish it matched the tutu that I bought for my daughters first birthday, but it doesn’t."
5.0,"The seller needs to correct the product description. The scarf is 100% polyester, not viscose. Otherwise, it's a lovely scarf. Nice colors; easy to match up with many outfits in solid colors and brighten them up a bit."
5.0,Nice material. Good quality
5.0,"Fit is Perfect..I ordered size L, 135lbs,5'4&#34;,38D.."

5.0,"I am absolutely in love with these sports bras and now own 12. They are extremely comfortable, great support for daily use and moderate exercising, size was spot-on, and they hold up well in the wash.

5.0,Cute.  My child loved it.
5.0,"These are great socks! I honestly haven’t “worked out” in them other than walking, but they’ve been helpful during pregnancy because I have swollen feet! I plan on using them post partnum as well for working out and for work because I’m on my feet often."
5.0,Happy with purchase and service
5.0,Nice quality. Soft and comfortable
5.0,"This watch is simple it is practical it is what it is, and that is a good solid watch. It has a date window a second hand an hour hand and a minute hand.  In my opinion good quality solid. If you buy this you wont regret it."

5.0,Great fit and color - looks exactly like the picture!
5.0,Christmas gift for son. Exactly what he wanted!
5.0,"I purchased this necklace because it spoke to me on a deeply personal level. The instant I saw it I knew I had to get it. The stones are what I would expected from the picture. The actual pendant itself is larger than I expected. Also, the chain that comes with this is longer than I prefer. Luckily I expected this from previous reviews and had an alternate chain available."
5.0,"Fits perfect, super soft and comfortable. Husband likes the feel as well."
5.0,"Very impressed with the quality of this watch band at such a good price.  It arrived on the day promised, exactly as ordered.<br /><br />My band is 18mm black leather.  It looks and feels like a band costing more and nicely spruced up my old Fossil watch.<br /><br />What also impressed me was the care which went into the packaging.  It arrived wrapped in a good quality box which included the band, at least three pins and the tool to remove them.  I already had one of those tools but this one was better and easier to use because the handle was twice as long, providing better leverage.  It almost looked like a gift someone had sent me, that's how nice it looked upon receipt.<br /><br />The band was ever so slightly narrower than my existing band but that is not a problem for me.  It has decent grained leather and plenty of holes for almost any sized wrist.<br /><br />All in all, I am quite pleased with this purchase and would have no reservations ordering more bands from Wocci in the future."
5.0,"Love them! The mirror effect has faded in some spots after the few months I've had them, but I think that's mostly my fault when I throw them into my purse instead of their case. Pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price - and I loved that hey included the case and wipe :)."
5.0,"This is one of the most comfortable dresses I have purchased. Material is very soft, and dress looks just like the photo."

5.0,Very  Nice
5.0,These are great and are so comfortable as well as soft. Love it.
5.0,"These are the greatest socks ever...a little expensive, but then they are totally individual, which is one thing I like...each sock is different, just in the same color range.  They also have mittens, scarves, hats, etc to match I found.  You have to check them out...Soclady.com.... I'm going to get more!"
5.0,I've had these boots for a month and so far I love them.<br />Super Comfortable. True to the size.<br />Worth the money!<br />I regret nothing!

5.0,This is a good quality tutu.  Nice underlining and worked great at my glow party.  Sizing is just right.
5.0,It’s hard to find watches for a small wrist. This fills the bill and has a very easy to read face. As I recall it shipped fast.
5.0,"I truly love these slippers! Super comfy, super warm, absolutely adorable. They have held up very well over time, I think I've only lost 1 sequin from them and you can't even tell. The cats love it when the sunlight hits the slipper and they reflect on the walls. I haven't tried washing them yet though, not sure how well they'd stand up to that."
5.0,Nice quality for the price and fits well!
5.0,Wore these at Great Wolf water park and they held up great for the entire time and still look great! I'm so glad I went with these instead of the &#34;sock type&#34; which seemed to rip apart in no time. Love that these have a thicker sole with enough holes for water to go through. Nice product.
5.0,These are cute! I have a few colors and I always get compliments on them!
5.0,Nice bow tie my son loves it
5.0,Love these! Perfect size to wear with multiples or just as a lovely little stud. Great quality and look expensive.
5.0,"This necklace is absolutely stunning!  I love everything about it.  The quality is really nice and it doesn't look cheaply made.  I wanted to buy a necklace similar to this in a boutique close to home but I couldn't justify paying that much for it, so I settled for this necklace instead and I am glad that I did.  I see potential gifts in the near future."
5.0,"Great product. Well made, fits, well, so much to choose from. It was so nice not to have to leave home to go shopping; the number of choices is unbelievable; it's worth the price. I am a Pajama Gram fan now."
5.0,Good quality for the price. Bright colors and soft straps that do not dig and leave imprints. The sleek carrying case is a great addition to protect the lens. Will buy again.
5.0,My niece grabbed it & ran to put it on . So cute !!
5.0,"Your head will sweat over 28 degrees F. What a hat though, keep it around fie EXTREMELY cold weather. When I have some disposable income, I'll be picking up the less fur version too."

5.0,bought this as a gift for somebody. so far they love it.
5.0,"My husband will be using this for airsoft, and he really likes it! It's well made and very sturdy. He uses a lot of actual combat gear when he plays, because he goes to airsoft fields, so he needs a sturdy belt to play."
5.0,"well I've had mine for about a week now... with no issues at all. it is a very nice looking watch and worth every penny. my compass,altimeter,and barometric pressure / temperature readings were so close right out of the box I never adjusted them. it was a very good purchase... read the directions to get the most out of your watch!!"
5.0,"Very comfortable and good quality. S/M is an excellent fit for men 8.5 wide feet. Pretty good fit but a bit too loose for women 8.5 skinny feet. Overall is a great buy. Love them. Both, my husband and I enjoy wearing them for our yoga class."

5.0,Amaaaaaaaaaaazing sunglasses the lenses size is medium I thought it will be big but that's my mistake

5.0,"Perfect, great price, fast shipping!"
5.0,"First I believe this will be my second ever review. I love this top ! I normally wear a large ,I dont like tight tops ,ordered the Medium fit GREAT with right amount of room ,the bottom of the top is slightly fitted and sits around my lower waist / bottom ,great color ,I ordered the Ombre teal ,just ordered the grey and the pink cant wait for them to arrive in just two days!! Great with a pair of Jeans or capris."
5.0,"These are fantastic pants. I got them for a steal and they are comparable to other $30 pants I’ve ordered. They are well-made; fabric soft and not too thin nor too thick, waistband not too tight. I got the 12-18 month size for our 12 month old and there’s room to grow."
5.0,Got this set for exercise and general use. The blue with black strip is my favorite of this set! Friends like them as well!
5.0,Made a perfect gift for a &#34;Scottie mom&#34;
5.0,My husband likes his rolling backpack. Lots of compartments to stash your stuff. We haven't traveled yet so can't say how it holds up but it looks very sturdy. Backpack arrived on day promised and packaged securely.

5.0,"I love those keychain, I've order this for me and my older brothers and it's just cute"
5.0,"The bag smelled of rich leather. Well crafted. Vibrant colors. I wanted a purse, but this is a bag for carrying stuff. Reviews said it was large and I ordered it anyway. They were right but I got an expensive beautiful bag. Can't return it! I will buy another smaller one."
5.0,Very warm & functional gloves. There's a zipper on the top of them to put a hand warmer inside on very cold days. This truly sets this glove aperture f/all other gloves on the market. You'll love them!

5.0,I love the uniqueness of this band. Have received many compliments as well

5.0,"Perfect!!!!!  I love these!! I have a small coat that fits me like a glove with the exception of the sleeves -- too short!  These soft wrist bands are perfect for extending my coat arms AND livening up the otherwise dull coat.  It was a hand-me-down, but in perfect condition and WARM!! So, I don't want to just give it away.  Anyhow, these fur cuffs are the PERFECT addition to sprucing the old coat up!!!!"
5.0,Gift for my husband. He loves it!

5.0,great mother's day
5.0,"Great tunic, could wear as short dress but not at my age"
5.0,"This bra is really nice and comfortable. I love the fit but I mostly like the style. Summer is in and I will definitely be showing some skin! This means a lot of racer back tanks etc. So, naturally my new bra will come in handy for me.<br /><br />The material is nice and sturdy. The bra does not look or feel cheap. That is a major issue I have with clothing. I don't like things that look nor feel cheap. So, even though this bra wasn't costly it still didn't look or feel like it came from the nearest  junk store.<br /><br />The fit was good as well. I recommend you purchase a size up as I did to properly accommodate your bust size.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Very sturdy! And came sooner than expected.
5.0,Good product takes a while to get to wearing them.

5.0,"Awesom long sleeve t shirt, grandson loved it bright and soft material a good quality."
5.0,"These gloves are extremely comfortable and soft. I love that they keep my hands warm while leaning my fingers free to use my phone. I've tried gloves with touchscreen fingers, but they rarely work. These also serve as arm warmers, so I can wear them around the house when I'm cold. Sort of like a comfy sweater with thumb holes."
5.0,"If you are the type who gives things away when someone compliments it, buy a dozen of these right now.  :-)  It is the most complimented item in our family and have given them away to strangers met in gas stations, and I'm quite serious.  Also, just that perfect item to throw on when you want to look Christmasy and feel festive.  Very warm and soft, and gets fluffier and softer with washing.  Love it.  Also, at this great price, makes a very fun Christmas gift.  Gifted them to most of the women in our family."
5.0,Elastic all around

5.0,I bought this mug as a Christmas gift for my mom last year. She loves it and uses it often. Happy customer!
5.0,Excelente producto. Lo volvería a comprar
5.0,I love dinos so I was very happy I found this skirt. Also I always buy for everyday pieces that I can wash home since dry cleaner are now too expensive.<br />I am going to enjoy it a lot.<br />Miriam
5.0,"I wear MEDIUM, ordered LARGE and it fits perfect, feels great, looks great"
5.0,"Hard to find color sun glasses, very nice looking and good strong quality frames, i've gotten lots of compliments, will definately buy again from this provider."
5.0,"These are lightweight enough to wear them for fall/winter in Southern California. I just had a baby, and wanted something a bit more high waisted for comfort, and these did the job! I ordered an XL. I'm 5'9"" and a size 10. The length on these were also perfect for me (most pj pants fit a bit short, but not these)."
5.0,"This is a really nice wrap. The fit was perfect (I am 5'7&#34;, 127 lbs and bought a small), the color was gorgeous and the price was very reasonable. I can't attest to how well it will wear as I have one washed/worn it once, but I am very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,I give it 5 stars due to the price and look. I was looking for a turban with a satin lining but they were expensive so I bought three for the pice of one and put my satin cap under it. Love it!
5.0,"I used this on some of my diamond earrings and they came out like new, couldn't believe how dirty they were.. Even the posts and earring backings came out brighter!"
5.0,I was nervous to buy a gold hoop but I think it looks great! You get what you pay for and they don't irritate my nose.
5.0,These earrings are so adorable!  I bought these for my sister who loves elephants and she loved them!
5.0,Love these. I've only had them a few days but they work great. The hair tie stays on just fine. I feel so fancy now
5.0,"Excellent quality. Fair price. Easy to install, remove, and replace when necessary. . Pleased these American made heel plates are available to the public thru Amazon for quick delivery. Will order more when needed. Thank you."
5.0,"Hat came as expected. Fit was snug and lasted the entire night without stretching out. I received several comments about the tightness of the fit from unsuspecting members of the public, including one from a fine young lady who proceeded to follow me home and inspect the fit and finish of my other hats. After much discussion she was so impressed with my large hat collection that she proceeded to let me have sexual intercourse with her. I'm a dad now!"
5.0,It added a nice touch to my dress.
5.0,I am a returning customer and obviously very please with the quality of the PowerLix products. This has worked wonders for my Shi splints!
5.0,Very nice hand bag.  Returned it as it was a bit smaller that what I expected.
5.0,Love it highly recommended
5.0,great quality and perfect as pictured
5.0,"For the price, these can't be beat! The inner straps that touch your neck are soft and comfortable, and look really good. The bottom tips on the hearts are not sharp, so you don't have to worry about stabbing yourself. Now, I have a relatively wide neck, and the second setting fits me perfectly. I feel like if you have a super thin neck that these might be a bit big for you, but for the price, I'd say they're worth trying out if you're looking to add a few cute heart collars to your collection!"
5.0,I love this dress!  The fit was great and accurate. I received so many compliments that I ordered another one.  :-)
5.0,"True to size, usually sizes run small I ordered extra large now have to return and order a large, other wise it beautiful on, ordered it for my up coming trip to Cancun"

5.0,These are extremely comfortable. I want to touch them all the time I’m wearing them. Love em.
5.0,Very fast delivery and great quality..will look to buy more<br /><br />Thanks
5.0,Bought as a stocking stuffer.  So cute
5.0,"Good leggings, true to size. Very comfortable"
5.0,I love these collars.  They are perfect to wear under sweaters or long sleeve tops without the bulk!!!
5.0,Si fue lo que yo esperaba
5.0,No more words should be required.  I had more than 1 in my hands every time I climbed into my aircraft. Can equipment and lunch with security
5.0,"Beautiful, little small in sleeves"
5.0,"I love it, came fast and it's exactly what I expected."
5.0,"I have spina bifida, so waist trainers, girdles, or corsets with boning KILLS MY BACK in a very short amount of time. I can wear this for 8 hours comfortably! It’s easy to wear, works good, price point was great!"
5.0,"The chest area  and the length fit perfect,  but the cut of the vest below the under arm area was cut to short and was rubbing against my underarms. Gave the vest to my daughter and she loves it. Will consider getting a larger size."
5.0,The aprons are what I expected except that the ties are short.  Not able to tie in front and I am not a big person.  The length is excellent.
5.0,"super fast service, great summer garment...I will get more!  thanks"
5.0,"If you order a size up you’ll be fine. I’m 5’5, 145lbs 36D got a Large and I love it."
5.0,Its beautiful well crafted.
5.0,"Great price, great fit and fast delivery. What more could I ask? Very happy with my order."
5.0,Beautiful look nice for casual ocasion
5.0,Actually I received a Black Bandana. Therefore I have ordered recently two more with white color.
5.0,"I’ve tried these on with my mid-ankle hiking boots (Merrell Moab) and they fit perfectly, with the socks coming about an inch over the top of the boot.  They feel great on, but I’ve not had a chance to hike in them yet."
5.0,"This is really cute and well made. It looks small though, I think it will only fit up to 6 months old."
5.0,"I'm absolutely in love with this bag. I have a monster sized gaming computer - the HP Omen with the 17.3 inch screen and couldn't be happier with the way this bag holds onto my computer. It holds my laptop securely and there's enough space for the cooling fan in the zipper pocket. Seriously, this bag handles like a dream and has enough space for my needs in the front pocket. I'm very happier with my purchase and would recommend for anyone who has also bought a 17.3 inch screen gaming computer."
5.0,Cute - warm; everything that I wanted it be.
5.0,Great belt comfortable to wear
5.0,Order this sport sunglass during prime deals and really liked it. Very comfortable light weight and good while running. It comes with a beautiful case to store and protect the glasses. The package came with a small card to check the difference between polarized and non polarized glasses.<br />Very happy with the purchase and will recommend this to my friends and family as well. Worth every dime. See the attached picture.
5.0,"These are so much more comfortable and easy to wear compared to the awful stock plastic Charge bands. I had them for my Charge 2, but they don't fit the 4. They are easy to resize for upper or lower wrist wearing. When they get sweaty from working out, just toss them in the washer. This set of 2 bands is a great color combination."
5.0,We bought these to replace 40 year old hard side samsonite luggage that finally succumbed to the rigors of airline man handling. This luggage combination is well worth the money. We packed 5 people in the large bag with spill over to the carry on bag for a week. They are heavy and because of this stood up to the airline demolition derby of checked bags with minor scuffs. They are real easy to roll. The Tsa locks are I bit difficult to open and close but if you ensure that nothing is sticking out or in the outer track where the two halfs meet this issue is minimized. The handles are secure enough to maneuver whether you are rolling or lifting the bags.
5.0,Great buy washes well they hold their shape
5.0,"I like this sunglasses a lot, they look much expensier than they are, the material is very much like plastic, very lightweight, I like the size also, it covers all around your eyes area without being too oversized, I wish the blue was a little lighter, but for the price, they are great.!"
5.0,"I set this umbrella up on Sunday and it was easy to set up and is currently $25 cheaper than at Walmart. I was disappointed when the lights did not come on when I flipped the switch so I did some more research as my package did not come with any instructions.  You have to unscrew the top solar light and connect the battery together, it is not done automatically - once I did that it lights up perfectly. Hope this helps!"
5.0,Looks very nice and does not feel cheap! Also not very heave either
5.0,It’s a little bit large but that’s OK I use it for weightlifting to keep me sweating and that works great.
5.0,Wow. This was so much more than excepted. It looks fantastic and I can't wait to give this gift to him. Thank you!!!<br /><br />I cut a split in the padding so the key ring wouldn't slide around in the box and look more presentable
5.0,"Comfortable, fits well, breathable"
5.0,"Cute, casual top. Its loose and flowy, which I like. Soft material."
5.0,"Bought this for my Instinct.  Band is LARGE, at 6'3"" and 250lbs this band has holes for me to grow into.  Love it"
5.0,Such a cute flattering tennis or golf skirt!
5.0,"The glasses do the job, block the glare without making things too dark.  Clear vision."
5.0,I love the style and durability
5.0,Graceful and quirky.  Looks wonderful with the dolphin earrings.
5.0,Its great the medalians are pretty sturdy and detailed and the packaging is great.
5.0,"I just opened this and WOW I am so happy it is absolutely perfect I really wasn’t getting my hopes. I’m trying to spend 28$ on something that looks like a YSL silver flower that cost almost 3,000$. Guess what I’m not joking this is a great very close look alike. I’m putting it on a much longer chain and I’m so happy"
5.0,Quay is the best for high end fashion at a reasonable price!
5.0,I really like this! I ordered a L and I'm 5'5'' and 130 pounds. I wear it with a white pattern top.
5.0,I luv my cap I can wear at work and help keep my hair out of my face and keeps my hair safe.
5.0,They work amazing.
5.0,Fit my 5’3” 90 lb daughter a little big but she loved it. Ordered small
5.0,Material was soft and better quality than I expected.  Fit as expected
5.0,This was a great necklace for any Firefly fan.
5.0,Great sunglasses and cool look. They tend to break easy so you just gotta be gentle with them. Great for the price and better than spending 20 bucks or more anywhere else.
5.0,I purchased this as a gift for a friend who has been through a lot. It came in a nice little velvet pouch and the words part of the keychain was covered with a plastic protector. She loved it!
5.0,Love this style of ring it fits great and doesn't loose it's tightness it's always snug color doesn't fade easy to clean me and my wife own several would highly recommend to anyone and everyone
5.0,Excellent boho style bracelet that is looks great with most summer outfits. Very beachy and stylish and IMO not something limited to just girls and such as any beach lover would enjoy this style and burst of color.<br /><br />Shells are sturdy and strong and don't chip easily. Handles a little bit of water well and the elastic band doesn't break easily or from normal everyday wear.<br /><br />Excellent bracelet
5.0,Love the colors and length. Quick delivery.
5.0,Bought these for my son but they are a girls cut and fit so my daughter is wearing them. Soft and durable.
5.0,I really like these. I’ll be buying again. The material is thin and perfect for working out in.
5.0,These are really nice.  The night ones are very effective at making things crisp and sharp.  The day ones really keep the sunlight out around and above my eyes.  Super Choice!  Super Value!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:e83b1f9ae2a5dccab778516673ba7bc3]] I got this for a child born with Epidermolysis bullosa. His mom loved it
5.0,I like it the material was so nice but I bought it a size to big Xxl
5.0,I PLAY VIOLIN AND FELT CLOSE TO THE NATIVITY.  THIS IS WELL MADE AND BEAUTIFUL FOR ALL AGES<br />HAVE GIVEN MANY FOR GIFTS<br />WELL MADE STURDY CHAIN  JENNIFER
5.0,"I ordered this lovely dress in size small, the yellow, white, and blue version.  I am 136pds, 5'4 inches with a bit of a belly pudge that completely disappears when I suck in, lol.  I love this dress! The material is durable and not cheap.  It has a nice stretch but is not a cheap,thin, clingy material, the dress is completely work appropriate! It reaches a bit lower than my knees and is full length in the sleeves.  The dress can be paired with the right accessories to make a nice date dress, I would not wear this to a club, however, I am sure that for some ladies the fit is flattering enough to party in.  I like my party clothes less structured than this dress!! Lol... However, the dress hugs my curves beautifully, it probably would have been more appropriate for me to order a medium sized dress, however the small that I purchased is not obnoxious.  Just incredibly , extremely, form fitting... The color band through the waist effectively camouflages my belly fat and the hidden zipper in the back is an incredibly classy touch.  Purchase this dress today, it is on par with the work quality dresses you would find at the mall, the beauty in this is not only the affordable price but also the free shipping, and how quickly I received it after placing the order.  I would absolutely purchase this dress from this seller again, and I without doubt will be purchasing another of the quality dresses from the brand."
5.0,GREAT DEAL / LARGER THAN I EXPECTED /
5.0,"This is IT! Better than the smaller, more expensive competitor's version!<br />This will not only make you look like a smart Kingsman's Secret Service Agent, it will also make you an astute Amazon Shopper.<br />The more expensive, competitor's version appears thicker and definitely smaller. I had to heat the middle of the frame and the arms to bend & expand them to fit my face.<br />This one, fit's perfectly and appear to be less thick than and better looking... Makes you look more like a Kingsman and less like a nerdy underclassman.<br />Thanks Amazon & Eyeglow!"
5.0,Love the quality of this product for the price paid. Will definitely order it in other colors!!
5.0,"Directly from Arena, all suits of this type from different manufacturers fit differently.  This is by far the 'BEST FIT SUIT', this will be his sixth ARENA Carbon, we've tried them all....and ARENA's No.1!"
5.0,Easy to look up and purchase
5.0,"Got this for my best friend who's a teacher, she said it was great to use as a &#34;teacher bag&#34; because of the fact that it zips up. Good quality fabric and is lined nicely as well. Color is vibrant as the photo shows."
5.0,I love these socks. My feet no longer ache when I wear these and I love how lightweight they are.
5.0,"I really love these earrings. They look very expensive. They are just the right size, not too small or too large. They are comfortable to wear.  I just happened to have a necklace that matched them exactly."
5.0,Great item for cosplay or dress up for costume
5.0,It's so adorable Thank you
5.0,I’ve never had a blue leather bag to match my denim pants. I love the unique design and the gold tone hardware on the front of the bag.
5.0,"LOVE this tank top. Very comfortable. Has quickly become one of my go-to tanks. Will definitely be ordering more, especially with the wide range of patterns available."
5.0,Just delivered today. I dig this watch very much. Will be replacing the band because it seems like it will crack and peel very quickly.
5.0,These were great!  Good thick material and made well.
5.0,Quality products

5.0,Perfect  fit. Great color and thickness
5.0,"Nice looking, quality"
5.0,"I bought this bra in hopes to find a comfortable, flattering nursing bra, and that is exactly what this is!!<br />I am very particular when it comes to my bras, small band and large cup are hard to please.<br />My cup is plus size but my band is only a 33 so it is always hard finding a bra but when I do I commit and buy different colors.<br />This bra is reasonably priced, supportive and flattering!<br />I have the black and nude colors and started wearing it before baby was born. Now my daughter is 4 months old and I've worn this bra everyday!!<br />The only slight complaint are the hooks but I am a first time mom so I didn't have many expectations for what to expect in a nursing bra besides getting the job done!<br />Discovering this bra has made going back to work easier, nursing in public a breeze and this bra boosts my confidence bc it's so great!!"
5.0,Great watch! Very inexpensive for work and play. I have expensive watches and always find myself with this one on.
5.0,This is not a traditional cotton hoodie. My son got this for his gf and she loves it.
5.0,This is a great watch. Looks better than my $650 watch! I wear it for big business events and receive compliments on it all the time. Thinking of buying another one in a different color. I had to take a link out as it was a little big but it was very simple. Took me about 2 minutes. This is a must buy!!
5.0,My first Kate Spade was the same type of purse but I wanted something for Spring. It is beautiful.
5.0,Please make them in silver  LOVE THEM!
5.0,The product is great. Just a little too small for my husband's face. But I'm using it and it's very comfortable
5.0,"If these aren’t authentic kaos softwear, they’re incredibly good imitations. (I’m pretty dang sure they’re real though- they have a little mark on them that I believe is the kaos logo?)<br />So I just compared these to my genuine kaos that I got straight from the website (green depicted in photos), and they’re identical in thickness-quality-size, texture/material feel.<br />Very, very, nice. If you’ve got prime and can get the free shipping, the discount here is totally worth it for what it seems is the same product.<br />Thank you, I love them!"
5.0,Unique and beautiful.  Arrived to me quicker than expected....very happy with my purchase!
5.0,Absolutely great size and color. not too big not too small. very spacious.
5.0,This band just kicked my active 2 watch up a notch. So light and comfortable! Totally stylish and all the accessories came with the package to have the band adjusted! A must buy if you don't like boring bands
5.0,Great quality and great item! Good for all Ancient Aliens theorists.
5.0,"These don’t work great for larger women, but it worked great for my daughter.  She likes to wear these with strapless dresses or certain tank tops.  I do like that you can rewear them multiple times, just keep the film that comes with them and use that.  Great quality as well."
5.0,Worked as should
5.0,"The future doctor in the family, my granddaughter, loved this in hot pink!!"
5.0,Got as a gift and he really liked it

5.0,good~~
5.0,"Amazing dress. The body of the dress is a stretchy comfortable material. Definitely comfortable and no issues riding up or having to tug at it all night. If you are a close fit to the sizes given in the size chart, order a size up. You will not be disappointed. Also does not look cheaply made at all!"
5.0,Great earrings for little girls my 5yo loves how the dangle and don’t poke her and they are very secure

5.0,"I love these so much, and I have them in every color. They benefit from screw tightening now and then but they hold up great for years. The price here is usually between $10-20."
5.0,I happen to love hearts and dangling silver earrings. This pair fits the bill.
5.0,I can't wait to wear this hot girl outfit.
5.0,Pretty necklace necklace- I like the contrast of the circular hearts with my name

5.0,Beautiful gift for my DIL.
5.0,This case looks nice and the slots for the sunglasses are large so you can fit two pairs of regular glasses in one spot. My husband and I used it for both my glasses and our sunglasses. I would recommend it
5.0,"The item is soft, thin and comfortable. It is slightly see through, just wear a long shirt. It fits the curves of your body great, can't even feel that your wearing them.Very happy going to buy more😆😆😊🤗"
5.0,"Only hoodie I could find with more than 4 members of Fairy Tail featured clearly and Erza near the middle! My daughter loves Natsu too, but didn't want a hoodie with only him and Happy. Colors are slightly different but not enough to matter. My daughter wears a small so I ordered her a large. It's big and loose the way she likes her hoodies. This hoodie is her new Favorite! Great gift!<br />Also, came more quickly than estimated delivery."
5.0,I'm 5'6 167 pounds and a large fit me perfectly.
5.0,"For it for my wife,  she likes it. There's plenty of compartments.  Only thing she said she wished it had longer straps,  but that is on us cause we didn't look at the straps that well."
5.0,THis is my 2nd pair of Flojos.  Real durable and stones do not stick in the bottom of these like other flip flops/sandals I have which is why I bought a 2nd pair.
5.0,Not as Slouchy as most but it is well made and fit as expected.  Just not as Slouchy but I still like the hat.
5.0,"These pants sparkle more than I thought they would! I bought these as an inexpensive option for a holiday work party. I received so many compliments! They were really comfortable to wear but fair warning, I did lose a few sequins throughout the night but considering what I paid for the pants I wasn't too upset. I will definitely be keeping these for future events and would love a pair in black."
5.0,"perfect, very comfortable just like the photo, the materials are very good, I'm using it as a wallet for my baby's things, and it's very comfortable"
5.0,"Yes, I like the this play<br />It's not for me, so I don't know it's for or what it was for"
5.0,"Great fit , and better price"
5.0,"My 2 1/2 year LOVES his George Pig outfit! He wears 3T clothes, so we went with 3T in this outfit and it fits perfectly. The hooded jacket is super soft and cozy. Highly recommend!"

5.0,Beautiful top. Love it.

5.0,"By far my favorite bikini I own! If you order you will not be unhappy! Super cute, fits amazing, love all the colors! This bikini is a must! I got so many compliments on it! I just love it!"
5.0,Very cute. Fit perfect!
5.0,"This is super comfortable, warm, and great for all sorts of outdoor activities. In particular I’ve put some serious winter hiking miles on this year, often below 10F with blasting winds and snow, and the one thing that saves your face in those situations is a nice winter Buff. For how well they work in the bitter cold… they also just seem to adapt to mild weather too- not overly hot when it’s warmer out. A solid buy."
5.0,"Perfect for a little princess. Great material and great fit. I got the 4/5 for my 5 year old granddaughter. She was soooo excited. It twirls, which if you have a five year old princess, you would understand the importance of a twirly dress!"
5.0,Very cute button up top!
5.0,Attractive. Comfortable. Great fit and finish.
5.0,Dress is super comfortable
5.0,best ever jacket !!!

5.0,"Price is great for this adjustable sax neck strap.<br />You can use it on Alto, Tenor and Baritone horns.<br />Pretty comfortable."
5.0,Not fancy but super gorgeous and amazing quality that is nice to the touch
5.0,"I found this a really efficient water backpack. I hardly write reviews, but this deserved one.<br />What I really like about it is that it has a LOT OF SPACE- and yep, it looks really nice. Besides the pocket for the water bladder, it has two zipper pockets. Between them there is a compartment with hook and loop fastener.<br />There are also two mesh pockets on sides of the backpack. On top if it, there is a detachable extra pocket, to carry things like your keys, card, ID, money and phone. It has a waist strap and chest strap, both adjustable, to help support the pack and keep it in place.<br />The water bladder holds 2L of water (!!). I was concerned it will leak, or will be difficult to refill--- but nope, super easy to refill, and no leakage whatsoever. The hose and mouthpiece have quick release buttons on them so you can take everything apart and clean it. The mouthpiece also has a cover on it to keep it clean.<br />If you hike, run, go to the park with kids or spend time outdoors, this is an awesome Hydration Backpack."
5.0,Nice big heavy ring. Very wide and manly.
5.0,"I am so happy with this purchase. The top is well made, beautiful and comfortable. The fabric is light and stretchy but looks like a knit sweater. Good for layering."
5.0,It fits my grandson perfectly n he's the actually reviewer with 2 thumbs up.
5.0,"Needed these for work and was extremely pleased to find the fit, fabric and style were exactly what I wanted... even ordered another set of four!"
5.0,"Love the Dragon,  looks great and fits the way it should.  Can't ask for more than that."
5.0,Good value.  Cute simple
5.0,"The color is true to the photo, a lovely rich Pink! The Visor is very well made and durable. I’ve got several in different colors now and they are very useful."
5.0,"Nice color (I got red), seems durable, holds all my cards and checkbook easily in a sleek and narrow fold, which is what I wanted!"
5.0,Very cute keychain. I recommend buying it! 🫶🏼
5.0,Very lovely bag
5.0,"Beautiful earrings, good quality, great price"
5.0,"Perfect size, easy to wear, don't slip and look natural and great under every garment. I've got sloping shoulders and these really balance out my figure without looking like a football player."
5.0,"Hello everyone.. I'm not big on writing reviews, but I had to do this one.  I looked at this dress several times and read all the reviews before I decided to just go ahead and order.  I ordered 2 the black and royal blue, I usually order an extra large just to be on the safe side, but I went with the reviews and ordered a size down.  I was already prepared to have to send them back.  The royal blue came sooner than expected.  Ok, so I open the package and the first thing I do is feel the material, wow was I surprised, soft, not thin, so you don't have to worry about see thru.  Next came the try on.  OMG did I fall in love with this dress.  It is the perfect summer dress, it's light weight, flows nicely, I'm 5'6 and it hits me a little below my knees and the big plus for me hides all your flaws, if you have any.  I cannot wait for the black one to come (due today).  I'm going to have a hard time deciding which one to wear first. I really wish it came in more summer colors, because I think I would have every color.  THANK YOU VERABENDI FOR MAKING MY PERFECT SUMMER DRESS!!!!!!  P.S.  consider adding some more summer colors.  I'm a truly satisfied customer!!!!!  I received the black dress definitely thinking about getting another color.  If only it came in brighter colors.  Love this dress."
5.0,Great and comfy leggings. Now have 3 pair for working out.
5.0,pretties the boots up
5.0,"I love them, I even ordered 2 more so comfy and so much side coverage which I loved"
5.0,I like the concept of a metal case.  The dividers make locating cards easy like a Rolodex; you just flip through your cards.  But it really doesn't hold all the plastic that some people have. Maybe 12?
5.0,"Love these hats! Purchased two! One for my girlfriend, one for me. They give ambient sound without being too loud or too soft."
5.0,Love this company
5.0,"These masks have several layers of cotton following CDC guidelines, a nose wire to shape around your nose and under eye glasses, easy elastic over the ears with little gadgets that you can adjust the ear elastics for a better fit. They are also designed to cover down under the chin for a snug fit. I ordered 11 of them the second time and got them in less than 4 days and that was over the weekend. They each come individually wrapped and they threw in a couple of plastic guards to keep the mask on without needing to put the elastic around your ears especially if your the back of your ears get sore. I'll need to order more in the future, just because I have a lot of family to cover since COVID isn't going away. These would make great stocking stuffers for Christmas. They have sold colors and pretty prints as well."
5.0,These socks are warm & comfortable. They fit perfectly & not too thick. The designs are very cool@@
5.0,This dress far exceeded my expectations considering the price! It fits me so perfectly and even has a little zipper on the side to make getting in and out of it a little easier. The material bottom part of the dress is a little stiff at first. But after washing it with some fabric softener for just one wash it's already much softer and moves better.
5.0,Used them for my son for the 4th of July and he loved them he got mad if they came off so definitely a good purchase
5.0,"I am very happy, good material (nylon) and it has a backpack from Tommy that match the style."
5.0,I couldn't wait to try on my costume! It fit perfect! I usually wear a medium but the large was the right size. A little long but I am only 5ft 3 in. so it was fine. I am a Xena fan so I am  thrilled with the costume!
5.0,Love the key chain.  Nice size and study.  Looks great too
5.0,Great large mask........it is beautiful but stiff and not comfortable to wear for a long period of time.....but it looks great in our photographs.
5.0,Awesome looking hat. Love it.
5.0,It fits perfectly and my son just loved it...
5.0,Great price and they fit perfectly. I have washed multiple times and they hold up nicely and regain tight shape after drying!
5.0,they work pretty well . I use for walking outside in the winter when I don't need sunglasses
5.0,Ahhhh this swimsuit! I love it!  Swimsuit shopping already gives all of us huge anxiety.  This one is amazing AND the cups are lined so no dreaded anatomy lessons in the pool once you get wet.<br /><br />It covers everything nicely that I didnt feel like showing and is so feminine.
5.0,"Fantastic customer service, highly recommend and will be a repeat customer!"
5.0,This is one of my favorite bras! I don't have a large chest but it gives me some push-up and lets me wear low-cut dresses without showing the cups.
5.0,Love this color on dark skin
5.0,"I love these, what I don't care for are the hinges aren't bendable"
5.0,My husband loves this shirt on me.
5.0,"I received this pair of Active Sculpt High Rise Full Length Leggings in good condition. I ordered the ""Navy"" color and it is exactly as pictured, a dark navy blue. I would better classify this piece as a 'jogger' legging because of its side pockets and drawstring waistband. The fabric is smooth and very soft on the skin. It has a medium thickness to it, and feels very breathable. I've worn them on a warm summer night and didn't feel hot or sweaty. They are not sheer. They were high waisted on me, a few inches above my belly button. The waistband has plenty of give and doesn't dig in at my sides. Although I'm short, the length wasn't ridiculously long and didn't bunch up too much at my ankles. I followed Amazon's recommendation to order my usual size and that was accurate for me. The leggings have tons of stretch all throughout the legs and waist, but be aware there isn't any compression. Nonetheless, they look really nice and flattering on my body type. These are my new favorite leisurewear pants at the moment."
5.0,"Well, not so much saved my life as it was just in the right place at the right time when my saw slipped while cutting down a Christmas tree.  It took the saw damage very well in what would have otherwise been a bad place to saw into my wrist.  Thanks Topwell.  Aside from saving my life, it's also a nice looking, comfortable band that has worked well with my G Watch."
5.0,So loved this!

5.0,Great product. Perfect for smaller wrists.
5.0,"Been using this band a temp wedding band to my ring gets resized, I Love it."
5.0,"I just got it so can't comment on durability but it is exactly how it describes it. I really like that it conceals the coin completely so that it has no way of falling out. Also, that you can see your coin and read it on either side of the keychain, very important."
5.0,I purchased as a favor for my daughters party! Each pair was individually wrapped and so many colors! Theses were right on schedule too! I would highly recommend!
5.0,"very nice, great quality and is very useful"
5.0,"The story on the perfect mock turtleneck top.<br />1. Took it out and assumed it was not fitted (looked boxie to me) yes I judged a book by its cover - my mistake.<br />2. These tops are perfect for layering and if you wear a leather jacket with it..Perfection!<br />3. Yes, I'm one that purchases same items n the colors I like to wear. Hubby thinks I'm crazy, yeah right.<br />4. Sizing is great n I'm 53 young. I'm 5'4 135lbs on a good day. My headlights matches my bumper, ladies n gents you know what I speak of.

Yes, we shop Amazon alot as a family.<br />Happy Holiday's and Amazon Rocks!"
5.0,I absolutely adore this hat and plan to buy all the colors.
5.0,"Very nice NATO straps. I've used many NATO straps and these are top notch. Their color, quality, and construction are what I expect. The fabric doesn't end in sharp pieces either. You can't go wrong. I received this item for a discount in exchange for my honest opinion."
5.0,"Great quality, definitely worth every penny"
5.0,Look just like the picture!  My grandma's a Badgers fan so she'll love them.
5.0,Great Glasses-received the wrong color-but overall I am happy with the purchase.  Great customer service-contacted them right away-they credited me the difference in the glasses and I will be purchasing the clear  glasses.  The glasses are large framed but good look!

5.0,"My big sister's granddaughter just became a big sister her self. So instead of a silly t-shirt that says it, i wanted to give her aomething different to commerate the occasion. She wears it to school everyday, and anywhere else she may go. She doesn't sleep in it or nathe in it for fear.it might turn. SO far so good. Its a very nice necklace and worth the price to make a lil girl happy."
5.0,Wow this is my favorite jacket.  I’m just astonished with how perfect it is for me. So freaking happy and I’m a dude so I was worried it would look too feminine but I nah it just looks badass. The hood is wicked and it fits just right I’m 155lb and 5”10 and the large fits just right for me goes perfect with my outfit comfy warm but not too warm. Buy this guys. Don’t get the polyester one it’s worth the extra for cotton! Plus it got here just when it said it would :)
5.0,My son loves them! Fit great!
5.0,Perfect for yoga.

5.0,"These socks are great! They are thin and comfortable, can be worn with even tight boots and shoes and they really don't slip at all! With these 3 colors I can wear with anything. Love them with my lightweight cross-trainers. Can't see them but feels much better than going sockless."

5.0,Absolutely worth the price. love it.
5.0,They were comfortable for the entire day. Just what I needed and wanted for my work day.
5.0,Was purchased as part of a school uniform.
5.0,Love the color and not heavy at all. I wore them all day and no need to remove them. Don’t come with the backs though.
5.0,Just what I needed to walk around the house. Close to being barefoot. And big enough for my feet.
5.0,"Not crazy about the tie belt, but overall it’s cute and flattering"
5.0,"Great product, good quality."
5.0,Great company to work with! Swimmsuit true to size!  Great experience!!!

5.0,"Didn't expect it to be such great quality, def recommend if you wear a skull cap and don't want rocks thrown at your face on the highway!"
5.0,I’m always losing my nose ring. This product comes in handy especially when I’m on the go. I put a few in a jewelry bag to keep extra in my purse. I loved the price for the product. They last so long and the quality is superb. I use them all of the time.
5.0,Beautiful fit. The material is very comfortable. You can wear it with a pair of booties or dress it up with heeled sandals.<br />Good affordable buy. Cant wait to order again in white and blue.
5.0,"The band felt more snug against my wrist,  was easier to adjust, and matched my suit(s) perfectly."
5.0,Great no show socks! Good design and they are truly no-show!
5.0,"These socks fit great. They have a snug fit around the middle which helps them to stay in place and not slide off your foot down into your shoe/sneaker. That's a huge plus! I've purchased other socks that say they don't slide down but within 2-4 minutes they're under my foot! These stay in place and feel great. They are slightly thicker but not so much that they make your shoes feel too tight. They aren't completely hidden inside my shoes, they show a little but it doesn't bother me. I love these socks and feel they are a quality item."
5.0,"I love this shoe which I own in 5 colors. Super comfy, easy on/off, great arch support. You need adjust the stretchy laces only once: thereafter, just slip the shoes on & off: no need to tinker with the laces. Highly recommended."
5.0,"Nice plug, came quick,  a lil think but they're my favorite."
5.0,These are very comfortable and make for perfect summertime underwear.
5.0,"A very classy, casual, elegant look. Prefect summer dress to wear for casual to semi-formal events. I got so many compliments on this dress.  I bought 2 in different colors and ordered a 3rd one."
5.0,"Perfect fit, and my kid loves it!!"
5.0,"My husband loves this present. He thinks it's hilarious. The fit is great and the material is good quality, not super thin."
5.0,Got these for hubby and he loves them! He drives for a living so comfortable and effective sunglasses are a must. And the case is nice- keeps them from getting damaged.
5.0,Love it and it’s it’s stylish & durable. Fits great!
5.0,"These are very comfortable,  thick enough to not worry about being see-through, and can be worn all day without creeping up my inner thighs. Like them so much I ordered a 2nd pair after 2 weeks of wearing them almost daily."
5.0,This wrap is BEAUTIFUL and incredibly soft. It is moderately warm. The clip that came with it is beautiful as well as convenient.
5.0,"I love these! I ordered some more. Simple looking, love the pockets; perfect for working out and for casual attire.  Washes and drys well...very few wrinkles."
5.0,Better Than I Imagined.  Loving It...Fast Delivery!
5.0,"Good quality and fits perfectly for 7 year old boy. It’s expensive because for the same price you can order four masks instead of just one granted this has fortnite design, but other masks have good designs too."
5.0,"Perfect for all my credit cards, money and ID cards. Would order again if need ever arises. Husband replaced his wallet with this item and loves it also."
5.0,"These pajamas are fantastic! Nice and thick, very good quality. I bought these for my son’s Halloween pajama day at school, and they are thick enough that I wasn’t worried about him being cold as some kids’ pajamas are thin.<br /><br />Highly recommend!"
5.0,Over all great product for the price and fun shirt to have for your kids if they like anime.
5.0,Looks great. Just like the original.
5.0,"This is another of those products that has a very strong disgusting smell straight out of the bag.  That is a problem for me as I have pretty severe migraines and scents are on of the only things I know that triggers them.  So this one is definitely a wash before using it kind of item — probably twice.<br /><br />That said, once the odor dissipates, this is a pretty nice scarf.  I have several of these loop scarves / next gaiters /  buffs / whatever you call them.  The one that feels most comparable is probably my Mission cooling towel version.  This one is almost as long as that one.  Only unlike my others, this one is two layers.  And because it is long enough you can double it up when you use it as a mask, giving you 4 layers.<br /><br />There is no finishing beyond the two loops being sewn together, but that is more finished than this style of scarf often is.  Cute print.  Looks just like the picture.<br /><br />I debated between 4-5 stars.  I think 4.5 is fair for this one, but since the only negative is the odor and that fades, I rounded up rather than down."
5.0,Amazingly has plenty more belly room to grow baby bump. Love the soft lining feel and the snugness with stretch.
5.0,I bought this as a gift for a friend after overhearing her tell someone that she doesn't wear all of her earrings because it's too hard to find the pairs. The next time I visited she wanted to show me the stand with her earrings in it.  I was amazed at how many pairs it held and thought it looked very pretty sitting on her dresser.  I got the black one.  It's sturdy and looks really nice. She's really thrilled with this item... I'm thinking that I want to buy one for myself!
5.0,"Bought this to cover in patches for the husband. It had the best reviews for the price and I really value when people leave them, helps so much. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It's a good quality vest. The color was perfect, we needed a dark denim. As others have said, the buttons are a bit loose but that won't be a problem for us."
5.0,I bought this for a Halloween costume! I wore the headband ears all day with no headache!
5.0,Excellent craftsmanship and has so far held up to daily wear with and without shoes. I’ve loved everything from Novica so far and these toe rings were no exception.
5.0,"Comfortable, pretty fabric. Flattering cut."
5.0,Really soft velour like material
5.0,Once I got it..... it caught my eye and it's pretty bigger than what I expected to be. Overall I'm satisfied
5.0,Love these jeans and will be buying as many as I can because they fit so well. I can not imagine paying what I did before for jeans that do not fit my body as well as these do. The Quality is great and they wash up well with no fade that I can see. I have had no problems with the fit even after washing several times.
5.0,"I bought the navy and white striped dress in a size Large. I'm 5'7"" and 170lbs of melanin curves. This dress fits delicately to every curve of my body. The ruched part at the bum makes the dress flattering and elevates it from a typical overtly sexy contour dress. The The length is a bit long hanging well beyond the ankle, but is perfect with 3"" wedges or an espadrille. It's still going to grace the floor a bit. The material doesn't feel thin, but is a bit see-through in the white (with blue stripes), but not to the point where I feel self-conscious. Just wear a skin tone thong and you will be fine. I wore the MITALOO Adhesive Bra Invisible Backless Bra from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097BDQL67?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details<br /><br />This dress is subtly sexy, but as soon as you put it on, it brings out your inner sexy. I feel beautiful in this dress. Loved it so much that I bought a second one in red a few weeks later."
5.0,"My daugher (1 year old) wears these, and they seem to fit ok and work well. Daddy did have to wear them a bit to loosen them up and normalize them for her though, but now she can watch me shoot trap safely."
5.0,I got this necklace for my sister. She loves it. The value is really good because the product is gorgeous. Definitely worth the money. It’s also readable from a distance so there is no guessing game.
5.0,It looks pretty but as someone mentioned the star feels like plastic. I was not sure how I feel this necklace at first. However the more I wear it the more I love it.
5.0,Gorgeous.  I love Tiger's Eye and I love this bracelet.  It is beautiful and comfortable.  I even bought one as a gift.  I bought one for myself and it came yesterday and it is gorgeous.
5.0,"After trying several masks, i always found that they pressed my nose and made my breathing difficult, and i tried this one, it is VERY comfortable amd the most important think I CAN BREATHE  i use it everyday for the gym, get it you will not be sorry"
5.0,So cute and comfortable!  I was looking for a casual dress I could travel in.  This is perfect!
5.0,"Best ski jacket I've ever owned worth the money. You will need to layer up underneath, but it will keep you nice and dry on the outside. 👍🏾👍🏾"
5.0,I’m petite (4’11” / 97 lbs) and this XS dress is a perfect fit! Length is more of a maxi on me but it’s great. It is super comfy and I get tons of compliments on it!
5.0,"This watch is very nice, it looks great, I like it<br />All its complication works well."
5.0,My daughter LOVES this dress!  It is so cute!  The only problem is that is is hand wash only.
5.0,I enjoy the stylishness of this split skirt!
5.0,My fiancé love them
5.0,"This band is a good quality replacement for my Samsung gear S3 Frontier. I wear my watch pretty much all day unless it's charging and this band is comfortable and breathes, so does not build up underneath the watch band. If I had to pick one thing to be picky about, it would be the length of the band. I have pretty average risk for a man and I am down to the second to last notch on the band. Fortunately the secondary band strap stays in place so the slack does not look out of place on the band. Overall, after using for about 72 hours of straight use,  I am confident in the build quality and durability."
5.0,"Product arrived on time, bracelet is stunning !"
5.0,Great..........Love them
5.0,For the price it’s great.
5.0,"Very comfortable, fits as expected"
5.0,My son LOVES this shirt. We will be ordering more characters for his birthday next month! Definitely go a size or two up though because it fits pretty snugly through the arms and chest. He’s generally a 2-3T and I got him a 3T. Next ones will be a 4T.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:e8b10719c006ab3a74f268dce6467b34]] Only dislike was the shirt is long. I could’ve ordered a smaller size too. But loved it I received many compliments
5.0,This is a very pretty bracelet.
5.0,Every time I wear this skirt/cover up someone stops me to tell me how cute it is.  It is the best cover up ever. It is so easy to put on and off.
5.0,"WINNER!  We won this beautiful leo from Lizatards! With a fun design of vibrant colors, fabric is soft and washes great.  It is well made with no irritating seams.  I especially liked that Leo is true to size and shaped like a gymnast with broader shoulders and chest and not binding under the arms.  My granddaughter is a muscular but petite size 7.  The M gives her some room to grow.  (S would have been too small).  I highly recommend this very nice product that is reasonably priced and made in USA!"
5.0,Love the shirt! I can't wait to wear it this 4th of July!!!🙏👨‍👩‍👦‍👦🇺🇸📃❤🕊
5.0,This is a very nice dress especially good value for the price.  It is a light weight fabric but that is fine for the summer. It has a nice shape and fits well.  I am 5ft 1 inch and 117 pounds and I bought a medium.  It helps me when people write their height and weight when looking to buy clothes online.  On me the dress is calf length.  I like it a lot.
5.0,These are so in style and so cute I love them
5.0,Super cute bag. Big enough for my toddler's lunch and a spare change of clothes for pre k.
5.0,Arrived exactly the same as shown in picture.
5.0,This is so pretty and it fits great! Perfect 2020 shirt. I'm hoping it will be a little less relevant during 2021.
5.0,"It's very comfortable, pretty, and has pockets, what more could one want for this? Sometimes the fabric does feel thin though"
5.0,"I loveee this shirt!! Perfect material, color,  price point,  non cheap zipper, and so comfortable!"
5.0,Cute shirt. Fits as expected. Light blouse.
5.0,Love this hat!  And the seller got it to me quickly so I'd have it for a party. Thanks so much!!
5.0,"I bought a very nice jacket, but it came without a hood. This scarf solved the problem of rain.  I fold the collar up and wrap the scarf around it with the hood up to keep me dry.  When turned inside-out, it is just a cloth scarf, but with a hidden hood and two hidden zippered pockets. It is little crinkle sounding, but I think that will diminish with use.  It can be folded up and can be tucked into the other end, but it is bulky."
5.0,Used them for the first time last night with my wife.  She loved them.  They hold great!
5.0,"Super vibrant color, lots of pockets and perfect size for an everyday bag!"
5.0,Me encanto la tela es linda muy comodo
5.0,Love how light weight and thin these glasses are. The lens is the perfect shade and they fit just right! Happy with my purchase:)
5.0,The size is great and they are sturdy. Unlike other brands where the lense pops out because of the thin frames.<br />These frames are thick plastic and durable enough to handle my toddler pulling them off the top of my head and dropping them to the ground... Repeatedly.
5.0,I needed bags to carry some random things for my wedding. They looked better than walmart sacks in pictures and are still holding up about a month later
5.0,"But while I did have them intact, they were my favorites"
5.0,Love this bag.  going on vacation with me
5.0,"This is a super soft and super roomy wristlet- it comfortably held my keys, wallet, and iPhone 6 with room to spare."
5.0,Good quality and helps keep the sun from eyes.
5.0,Love this pin.  Get so many compliments.
5.0,It covers all the needs while hiking in the desert.
5.0,Bought this for my wife because I thought she’d love it. She did! Wears it as a bathing suit coverup and she looks fantastic. It’s flattering and she looks great!
5.0,"This is a heavy, well-made chain which looks more expensive than it was. It combines well with other anklets I often wear. I plan to wear it a great deal. The item came quickly and is packaged beautifully."
5.0,Gave both to my nieces. They said it was soft and they wear them all the time. Very happy with the onesie.

5.0,Cool watch ... great price ... great buy.
5.0,Love this watch band. Feels great on my wrist and looks great!
5.0,I previously bought the tan one and I loved it!!! It was perfect! The white one runs a tad bit bigger (just a little)!! But I still love it too!!
5.0,My daughter loved her gift! Strong durable and perfect socks !
5.0,Product is as advertised and has met expectations.
5.0,"I'm 230, 5'7"" and have larger arms. Fit perfectly. Very comfortable. The green is gorgeous! Flattering on all body types!"

5.0,Excellent quality and good value.
5.0,Cute tint and shape.
5.0,Great quality and festive!
5.0,I am in love with my Cardigan chains.
5.0,Great size and look wonderful on me and the bordeaux frame color makes me look smart with flair. I have trifocals so there is a lot of room for my eyes to the adjustment and my eyes don't need to search for the sweet spot.  I paired the frames with new technology for my prescriptions lens called ClearVu Digital™. I haven not seen this well for years.
5.0,Absolutely love the fit of this garment.  It's slightly sheer and really pretty...perfect for the beach!
5.0,Great headbands
5.0,Love the pockets and fit. Buying it again in a medium bc i lost weight!
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous, trendy and classic at the same time, and a great purchase! I constantly receive compliments when I wear it."
5.0,"My granddaughter lives this nightgown. It is made from a warm material,  and it is nice and long to keep her legs warm."
5.0,"Great little tops. I had originally purchased two black ones, then bought another in purple and finally placing a third order for blue and cream. They fit nice and are very long, (they cover my butt,) great if you're a tall gal like me. I'm 5'9, 185, size 14, 36DDD. Nice thick fabric that drapes well and washes well. I wear the crap out of these tops and wash them often and no pilling, shrinking or stretching, (cold water, gentle cycle, tumble dry medium.) FYI they look a lot shorter in the pic, these are pretty long tops, I wear them to bed sometimes, makes a great soft, comfy night shirt."
5.0,This dress is very flattering and hits all the curves nicely! Will definitely order in other colors!
5.0,I like how they fit me
5.0,I don't normally write reviews but I had to say that this is the best wallet I have ever owned. The size is PERFECT (big enough for a passport but small enough that it doesn't stick out when in a back pocket). The leather is also excellent quality and exactly as shown in the pictures. Last thing I love about this wallet is the layout design that allows for a lot of credit cards without making the wallet too thick and cumbersome. I Highly Recommend
5.0,Love this! It is the perfect length. Will probably need to be somewhat careful with the way the crochet is but it’s just what I was wanting.
5.0,Great idea here but was just too loose for me
5.0,"Obviously the quality is not exact compared to the Oakley but for 1/7th of the price or less, they are amazing.<br /><br />I daily commute on my motorcycle and the polarization helps cut down on the &#34;mirages&#34; that are seen sometimes in the street."
5.0,"For the price and function, it works great. Feels good under your shirt while working out, good size and fit. Bought several of them, might buy more."
5.0,Christmas present for my boyfriend.
5.0,I am so so very pleased with the UNIQUE shirt(s) i secured from ZERO. THey treated me with dignity kindness & offered complete fast/full service. i perhaps needed a little tiny bit bigger shirt aha it is a welcome challenge to get into better health shape for this killer shirt. They have so many great ideas/graphics forr their tees You just cannot go wrong. THANNKS!!
5.0,Very colourful and vibrant. Fits and matches my glasses perfectly.
5.0,Great bag for travel or everyday. Very spacious with convenient pockets and zipper pouch. The zipper pouch on the outside is perfect for cell phone.  The large inside neatly holds all your things.
5.0,This band looks great and works perfectly with my Apple Watch Series 6. It is a quslity product at a great price!
5.0,"I was concerned about the length of the chain being too short, but the pendant hits mid chest- long enough not to get stuck in a lower cut top! Really pretty design, great buy!"
5.0,I got it as a stocking stuffer for a friend and I think it was nicely made and well worth what I paid for it.
5.0,I got this outfit for my wife for Christmas she absolutely loves it very comfortable she says. The only downside is the strings on the pants they shred
5.0,The eyeglass cases are nice and bright.<br />My 97 yr old Aunt loved the glass cases!<br />She said they were the prettiest cases ever.<br />A real find!
5.0,Soft and warm in lovely colors
5.0,These are great bags for packing and really help me maximize how much I'm able to bring.

5.0,Bought 5 of these! Love love love!
5.0,Nice hat Clean lines good price....
5.0,Grey colors! Something different
5.0,Fits perfect.  Love the material but I have not washed it yet so I don't know if it washes well.  Looks nice on.  Doesn't cling. I ordered the green and it's much darker than the picture but I'm keeping it anyway because I like the top so much!
5.0,Liked it so much ordered on for my friend
5.0,My son loves how warm and soft this robe is.  Very nice gift and price.  Would purchase again.
5.0,Love these earrings. I wear them nearly every day. I have several packs in several sizes. There are so many colors that I always have something to coordinate with my outfit.
5.0,GOOD FOR PRICE!!!
5.0,"Nice material, detailing.  Comfortable fit.  Very pleased."
5.0,Laus Deo :-)
5.0,"Good feel of the fabric, love the cat design. It was my fault for thinking it'd be an infinity-type scarf based on the picture, but I still love the scarf."
5.0,hold up well in the washer. stays put during class. all around good top. has not faded at all through about 20+ washes
5.0,"Nice graphics, quick shipping, satisfactory quality.  Corvette lovers and enthusiasts will enjoy wearing this T shirt.  Fit is as expected."
5.0,"It's purrfect! I  haven't had a chance to wear it yet, but I can already tell that is it right length and thickness for me! I can't wait to wear it for Halloween since my coworkers and I are allowed to dress up this year!"
5.0,If your kid is into Roblox they will appreciate these. The shirt is long enough for a nightshirt alone ( if your kid is not that tall) and the material is very soft. Size is true for a comfortable fit.
5.0,"These are amazing! Well made!! I used them for decoration for my Hindu wedding and they were perfect! I got the idea and was searching everywhere for these at an affordable price.  Every where else they were 5 times the price! These are priced right and look incredible in person, so much so my guests took them home! I bought two set but will be buying more for my own personal home!"
5.0,Perfect fit to size and comfy fun and fabulous!!!
5.0,"I took my granddaughter and her friend with me to an event at a local stadium and they did not have a clear bag so I hade to put their belonging in mine.  I vowed this would not happen again.  They have not used them yet, but they arrived in promised time, they appear sturdy and they both love it"
5.0,"Absolutely love this coat - super warm and comfortable in single-digit temps, but unzipped a bit still ok in 40 degrees and raining.  Lots of small touches, such as armpit vents that vent inside the liner, not to the outside, so you get breathability without the cost of cold air coming in, and the little ridge across the base of your neck that very effectively keeps drafts out.  Expensive, but well worth it"
5.0,Perfect fit and texture. I will spend a lot of time wearing these.
5.0,"Bought this for my 11yo daughter who is 5'2&#34;, approx 110lbs, and it fits her perfectly! She's extremely picky about bathing suits, so I knew I was taking a risk ordering this without first seeing it or trying it on. Once she did, she loved it immediately and now wears it all the time over her other suits!"
5.0,Easy to change. Comfy and smaller than Apple bands. Love versatility and style.
5.0,"I got this for my best friend. She loved it. Now I do not know how it felt or how long it took to get there. I do know she got it before it was expected, it ended up being an early Christmas gift! It is beautiful, a nice size, and appeared to be very lovely on her as it would on any horse loving girl."
5.0,It's excellent keychain from my country El Salvador!
5.0,This bag is roomy & durable
5.0,Very good quality wrap. It is the perfect compliment to an outfit.
5.0,Sturdy and exactly as I expected
5.0,Decent glasses for price.
5.0,"Wear it all the time, but the silver comes off after about a month. I have bought it twice happened both times."
5.0,Just love this I bought 2.
5.0,This dress is so cute the fabric is pretty stretchy will look amazing with a petticoat and Just as amazing without true to size
5.0,The inky jeans my son will wear. Super comfy for him.
5.0,"I am 5'2, 117 lb and 32D. I got the medium due to others saying it ran small and it fit perfect."
5.0,Very easy to install in the frames
5.0,Nice blouse and color vibrant  I took a chance on the fabric  Strange blend of poly  It is uncomfota when temps start to soar  The fabric doesn’t allow your body to breathe and makes it hot  colors are nice against the white backgrounx
5.0,wonderfully soft and even though one size fits all--it's true.  soft warmth all in one.  color fantastic
5.0,"These sunglasses are by far the best I've purchased for this price. They fit nicely, they're stylish, and they do the job. I'm sure I will be purchasing more from this company..."
5.0,My daughter loves these pajamas. She has asked numerous times for more. They fit her well and very comfortable.
5.0,What’s not to like
5.0,I bought this dress for my daughters homecoming dance and it looked beautiful. I even borrowed it from her to wear to a wine tasting fundraiser because I needed something blue. Quality was excellent and the price was just right.
5.0,Bought this for my daughter to wear for her schools team jersey day. Fit her perfectly.
5.0,"Got here on time, this not first order, still great quality and fits perfectly"
5.0,Nice bands looks good on my watch very pleased with my purchase wood order again love them
5.0,"I ordered this dress after reading the reviews. I am 5'8 240lbs size 14/16 and curvy. Based on the reviews and the measurements on the indicated sizes I decided to purchase an xl. The dress comfortable and accentuated my curves. The length is also very good. The dress covers the top half of my feet. I'm. More than satisfied.  Oh, the dress is stretchy with a side sipper"
5.0,"I've bought this same set in four different colors. I absolutely love how it fits and makes me feel about my body.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5'6"", around 155 to 160 lbs. I gain most weight in my belly, bottom, and thighs, so I am a medium up top and an XL on the bottom. I purchased a large, hoping I could compromise between the two.<br /><br />The drawstring waist EASILY and very comfortably accommodates me. If you boat, it won't be a problem. No muffin top, no weird lumps. The jacket is just a touch loose, but still form fitting enough to be flattering. The material is quite soft -- not as soft as name brands, but softer than you'd expect for the price.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'm super happy with these. If you're pear shaped, I think you'll be particularly happy with these. It's always hard to find sets that will fit me in both the top and the bottom unless I buy separates in two different sizes. This set is a rare exception."
5.0,Loved the design! Item shipped fast and was a great Christmas gift for my husband
5.0,"Se ve igual que en la foto,fue una de mis mejores compras me encantó."
5.0,"Good for the price, just smaller than the pictures showed."
5.0,"I like these color Tags,  I can easily spot my luggage at the airport.  These tag holders are lightweight,  easy to write inside and of course  easy to spot!  They hold perfectly.  Nice addition for your luggage,  laptop cases,  etc.  Great product!"
5.0,Cute shoes. Bought them for my daughter's hip hop dance recital.
5.0,Tal como el anuncio
5.0,The purse is the right size that I prefer. Super cute design.
5.0,It is heavier than I imagined which is a good thing. It's also prettier than the picture.
5.0,I was scared it wouldn't fit but it did! Plus size & big boon approved lol I wear it with a black tank underneath
5.0,Crazy socks week for fitness class.
5.0,"Greatest design in travel and bonus, it's anti theft"
5.0,"I love love the way the wear of this skirt. It is very sexy, comforable, and fitting! Highly recommend buying this skirt."
5.0,I have also paid around 10$ for a pair just like these the material is a little cheap but still great for the price and the glasses are cute!
5.0,I love the oversized clear shades. The shades are very fashionable.
5.0,"My daughters and nieces were so thrilled when I took these out and gave them each one of these necklaces! It was at the Japan Pavilion at Epcot where they have a pond full of oysters. They each got to pick one and the hostess opened it for them. Three white  pearls and one got a grey one. They all wore their carriage out of the pavilion, with it holding their new keepsake. A memory i will cherish forever. A pretty and magical piece for any girl, any age!!"
5.0,"My daughter loves it, the necklace is very delicate, and I'm afraid it my break easy, but it hasn't yet"
5.0,This shirt does not fit as expected. A large fit me more like an XL. I returned the large and purchased a smaller size.
5.0,"I just got my necklace,  and I love it, , it's  very pretty and ,  doesn't look cheap,"
5.0,"Work very well, easy to change"
5.0,"I have a large GG belt purchased directly from the Gucci store and this one is identical only slightly smaller. I actually like the smaller buckle better and I like the spacing of the holes better on this one than the original.  The color, finish and texture of the buckle is identical to the original.  The texture of the leather looks and feels the same too.  I just wish they had more colors"
5.0,"Unlike many rash guards that can be difficult to get on or then take off when they’re wet, this one was well fitting, easy to get on, easy to get off and the light blue was a beautiful color. The color on the advertisement was accurate. The quarter zip was perfect. It was a much needed item for a Caribbean trip and I was in the water for seven days without a burn"
5.0,"The color is amazing, the bright, the shape, the size... everything is perfect. Perfect present for any ocassion, I put it in a big bowl with others I have. Now I have all the rainbow colors. They look pretty!"
5.0,"This dress is really beautiful.  I received it yesterday and am wearing it today to see if there are any problems.  It is more of a wine color than red, but still pretty.  The material is strange, stretchy and super comfortable. It is kind of funky, with the one big pocket, but I like funky.  I've received compliments from everyone who has seen me today.  It is a sheath-like dress, I am walking in high heel boots and feeling very 60s stylish. The pic looks a bit blocky, but I feel quite slim from the side.  I'm 5'3&#34;, 150 lbs."
5.0,"These are delicate and so beautiful! I gave them as a Secret Santa gift at work and she seems to love them. The chain link part is fine, thin, so it would fit through your pierced ear easily. So pleased with them!"
5.0,Got them for my wife and she really liked them. They looked good and were easy to replace
5.0,"So glad I ordered this dress. After trying it on, loved the length, fit, but most of all the flattering design. Excited to wear this dress to work or going out."
5.0,work quite well. I am satisfied.
5.0,"Very flattering cut for my small frame and lovely pastel color for my pale pink skin tone.  I would buy it in other pastel shades, like dusty pink, muted aqua, beige/coral."
5.0,"Hanger perfectly fits with the Kore Essentials ratchet belts, takes up very little space and is made of durable plastic."
5.0,Recibido satisfactoriamente.
5.0,Awesome hat !!!!
5.0,"My husband is really working on his weight using the Keto diet, and I got him this so he would always have a belt that fit. Looks nice, infinitely adjustable."
5.0,"Arrived as indicated, and was original band quality.  Very happy with quality of product."
5.0,I love it! Fits perfectly for a tragus piercing.  And its solid 14k gold at a great price!
5.0,First I love Joules clothing.  My daughter had this coat when it first came out.  She wore it out and wanted me to try to fix it.  I found this one on Amazon and was super happy to buy her a new one at such a great price.  Now she can enjoy the coat for several more years.
5.0,Nice quality.  Nice fit.  The fabric is soft and in a true white color.
5.0,I love this products! I'm usually a 2-3XL so I ordered a 5XL so I could have a nice oversized hoodie and it's so comfortable and the perfect thickness
5.0,Perfect. Thanks! :D
5.0,Crystal clear glasses.
5.0,"I LIKE THESE MASKS.  GOOD MATERIAL AND THEY FIT MY FACE WLL, AND THERE ARE MANY CHOICES WITH PREFERENCE OF COLOR.<br /><br />I RECOMMEND.<br /><br />***ONLY RETURNING BECAUSE THE PACKAGE SENT DID NOT HAVE THE COLOR RED."
5.0,Good looking and quality tie. Very reasonable pricing.
5.0,I received so many compliments on this! The colors are bright and vivid. Looked great with white leggings and ballet flats. I ordered a size larger and it fit perfectly.
5.0,Looks good. Will see how it does on the slopes. Too bad no loop/hook for the ski pass.
5.0,Bought this for my girlfriend she's extremely happy
5.0,These have become my go-to to keep at the office when the AC is just a little too much or when the seasons are just starting to change.  They are silky soft and are holding up beautifully after being washed several times-no fading or pilling.  I machine wash them on gentle and hang to dry.  The weight is comparable to a good quality t-shirt so if you're looking for a thicker or warm layer this isn't the right choice for you.  I'm picking up more styles because I'm so pleased with them!
5.0,What a bargain. These are fantastic gloves. They afford the dexterity I need as well as break in quickly. They are very warm too. Highly recommend.
5.0,"didn't realize this was a extra long band.  Let me tell you it's beautiful band,  but you better be skilled when shortening it.  Jeweler wouldn't touch it, but I managed to get it done, and quite satisfactorily.  My wife thinks it's beautiful. and I do as well.."
5.0,What an amazing product for this price. Now when I travel I only have to take 1 belt. The shade of brown is light enough to go with tan and bone colored shoes.
5.0,"Bought these for my son, who wears plastic frames. Since his frames are thicker than a wire frame, we had problems finding some sunglass covers. These fit and worked great for him!!"
5.0,"Beautiful fun dress! This is a do it all kind of dress. From casual, comfortable to dressy and elegant. It can be used for any occasion. I love the pattern and can style it with any shoe.  Fit is perfect! I am 5'8 and weigh about 160 and have a medium frame. I ordered a medium and it is an awesome fit. I will order again!"
5.0,I love this! What a cool headband!!! It is one size fits all and it is moisture wicking. Those two features alone make this an incredible value. It can also be worn several different ways. This is an amazing seamless headband.
5.0,Loved it. Got it quick.
5.0,Great fit and support. Beautiful bra. I have purchased several of this style over the past few years and have been very happy with this bra.
5.0,Bag was great. Inside pockets great for cell phone and wallet. Very sturdy and perfect size for adults and kids.
5.0,They for great I was a little worried my foot got wider after I had my son but these fit perfectly. And love the fun red color!
5.0,Fits great - has held up well.
5.0,The heavy duty version of Clipa 2
5.0,"Got the 2XL for my nephew who is a tall stringbean. After washing, it shrank as expected, and fit him just fine.  Luckily his wife knows how to shop for him so I got lucky there.  Would buy again."
5.0,Beautiful! I am 170lbs and got size XXL. Love the fit. Looks exactly as pictured. Arrived much quicker than expected.
5.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this necklace! Very delicate and pretty. I forget that I have it on, so nice to layer with other pieces. Would recommend!"
5.0,Looks great! Exactly what I wanted
5.0,I wanted it to be loose fit. It is a loose fit and very comfortable top.
5.0,"After trying home remedies (toothpaste, baking soda and salt...), I decided to try a polishing cloth, which is what jewelers use. This cloth polished my tarnished jewelry back to looking brand new. I prefer it to not use creams or harsh chemicals and this was a good compromise."
5.0,Made nice gifts for graduates in our childcare program.
5.0,"Love them! I live in Florida, and don’t always want layers of clothing, but like a layered look. They are very comfortable and stay in place because of the underarm straps, which I can’t feel at all. They draw the eye up toward my face and make my pullovers look nicer. I haven’t washed them yet, hope that goes well and I don’t have to spend a lot of time ironing. I wear an XL in women’s tops so I bought the XL and they fit me perfectly. Very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,verry comfterble would higly recomend !!
5.0,Product was excellent.  Met expectations.
5.0,Love! Great quality. Comfy. Good stretch!
5.0,"Great dress. I thought would be more t shirt material, instead a little thicker. I still like it. I’m 5”4 so it got me at an odd length so I cut a slit in by the knee and tied it."
5.0,I really like these packaging cubes though I should have looked closer at the dimensions.  Originally I bought them with the intent of using them with a diaper bag but the majority of them are really quite large.  They ended up being perfect for dividing the family stuff up on a recent trip.  Each of our toddlers got one cube full of their stuff and it kept us very organized and was really convenient.  So not able to use for what I intended but still a great product and very glad to have them.  No complaints at all.
5.0,"This product was just what I was looking for.  It is lightweight, affordable (love the color) and perfect for protection from the sun.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a UV protection."
5.0,Bought for groomsmen in wedding and they loved them. They looked great
5.0,Nice! Its very slimming
5.0,"Best compression socks On the market that I’ve tried...if you’re debating between Tommy Copper or Miracle Copper make no buts Copper Fit are in a league of their own, may be a touch more expensive but the comfort, usefulness and ease of taking on and off are worth the couple extra bucks!!!"
5.0,"This bracelet has pale gray beads but they seem to go with everything. Looks great with diamonds as well as jeans. It's a good fit for a small wrist - most 7"" regular bracelets are too big on me. It's not too tight and because it's wire it will stretch to accommodate any size wrist. But I would imagine it might be a little tight-feeling on a large wrist. It's very pretty and people comment on it a lot. Love the charms hanging off the ends."
5.0,"So adorable on my baby cousins little feet. She's about 4 months and I ordered the 3-6 months. She fits them just fine with a little room so she'll have them for a few more months. The leather is so soft and the color is very pretty! I was nervous about the metallic pink being too bright but it's a soft, almost mute pink. They're perfect for this baby girl!"
5.0,"I bought this costume for a fashion show my daughter styles for. I can honestly say it was a hit. The only issue I had, and this was on me not the seller or designer, was the leggings and belt was wayyy too big. Again, that was on me because I was scared to order my normal size for the fear of it running small. I just added an arm band around the top of the leggings and it worked out great. I had to substitute the belt because I couldn’t think of a way to adjust it easily."
5.0,Used it for a new purse - didn't like the skinny leather one that came with purse.
5.0,"Don’t hesitate, add your your wardrobe"
5.0,Bought for my husband’s friend and he wears it everywhere! Pretty cool and a conversation piece.
5.0,My daughter loved it I want one now!
5.0,"Good quality, works very well."
5.0,Great Quality! My Mother In Law loved it.
5.0,"High quality.  My third, different colors!!"
5.0,"Daughter shopped hard and couldn't find exactly what she wanted in stores, found it here and absolutely loves it!<br />She looks so stylish!<br />Can't believe how fast it arrived!"
5.0,I bought these shirts for wearing with cardigans to work. I have also been using them as maternity shirts and they still fit great! I’m 5’3 120lbs (not pregnant) and got a small which fits great.
5.0,Love them.  They are stylish and the lens is clear to read in the sun.  I keep getting compliments on them.
5.0,Much cuter than photographed! Love them!
5.0,I dont normally  give 5 stars but this far exceeded  my expectations it is sturdy and elegant  and you can tell they paid attention  to detail  when they made  it. The mask fits  comfortably  on my face  and when tide up I dont even feel like its there..
5.0,Just had my old worn case replaced! Good quality :)
5.0,my stepmom loved this item for mothers day
5.0,My daughter loves these and wears them around the house all the time.

5.0,The Witcher Wolf Medallion is absolutely amazing!!  The detail and quality of the medallion is just beautiful.  The package was secure with the medallion even being sent in its own box with the medallion sealed in a plastic bag for protection.  The trans was very smooth with a quick shipping turnaround.  It was a pleasure doing business!!
5.0,so cute. the leather is beautiful. this bag is a perfect little clutch that can be worn over the shoulder. great organization for such a small bag.
5.0,"I bought these pajamas for my grandmother and she loves them!  They are very soft and comfy!  And the best thing about them is they offer them in petite length, which was perfect for my grandmother!"
5.0,"These are cool, they all fit together perfectly when you flip the back on the right side, and when I need to open one back up I use a thumb tac. I sized my pics using Microsoft word. Good product and amount for the price"
5.0,"I was looking for comfortable slippers for the evening and morning, that fit my size 12.5 foot. I bought these from the Amazon site, without prior experience with this brand, and was pleasantly surprised when I received and tried them on. The length is fine, and they are a little bit wide, but that is what I expected, since they are size 13. The slippers seem to be well constructed, the soles are excellent and support my feet well. I am happy with this brand and model of slipper, and will order them again in the future. The future is here, and I ordered these slippers for the second time, since I was happy with my prior purchase. The new slippers seem to be a bit narrower than the old ones, and they fit my foot just right. The are very comfortable and I am happy with them!"
5.0,Bought this for my husband he absolutely loves it
5.0,Fits great and it looks amazing on curvy women like myself. Im 175 lbs 5'8 and i ordered a medium. Wil definitely buy ahain from this seller

5.0,"I love the purse. A bit smaller than I originally thought, but it really cute and sturdy."
5.0,"I love this linen/cotton dress (I wore with jeans and flats).  It is comfortable and original.  The package arrived earlier than expected.  Mordenmiss customer service is exceptional in several ways.  For example, they checked on sizing for another order and gave me the opportunity to change my order in case I had made a  mistake.  I always check on the page and almost always find new inspiration for clothes I never thought I would wear but that I love!"
5.0,Esta igual a la foto me encanta el vestido
5.0,Great for the ones who know what's going on and like to breath. You just put this on so everyone one else can leave you alone.<br />Definitely not for sheeps.
5.0,"This legging is thin and light, even in summer! It's comfortable and I like it very much."
5.0,"Good quality, color didn’t bleed when washed and didn’t shrink when dried!"
5.0,Looks great. But not good for extra grip.
5.0,Bought it in two colors.  I get nervous buying clothes online but with the sale picked up black and burgundy.  Really happy with them.
5.0,LOVED SERIES SURE I WILL LIKE DVDS.
5.0,My granddaughter received this bracelet as her high school graduation present. I did good!
5.0,Wrinkles easily but still very cute.
5.0,"Received shipment very soon, socks are exactly as posted . Granddaughter is very pleased with the fit and look."
5.0,This dress is bodycon. The color blocking makes it very flattering. True to size.
5.0,Fit as expected. Very nice. Good quality. Very pleased!
5.0,"I have to say that these are my favorite underwear by far. They are extremely comfortable, the waistband stays in place and it gives you great support. I’ve tried a variety of different brands and for me, this is the best on the market and worth the cost. Im sold !"
5.0,Lots of functionality good soumd quality<br />Came im perfect condition
5.0,"I don't normally write reviews for my purchases, but I just had to for this dress! It's exactly as pictured- super cute, fits like a glove and I LOVE the material! It's so comfortable, and I love that the fabric has a little stretch to it. Very happy with this purchase! I highly recommend!"

5.0,I like it. Very beautiful！
5.0,Favorite dress of the summer. So much fabric that I love to twirl and dress in! About to purchase in another color as white is too see through to wear bare. Hoping a darker color will let me do just that!!
5.0,A graduation gift for my granddaughter.
5.0,"bought these for something flexible and comfortable while working out. love them! very soft, stretchy and comfy!"
5.0,"I wore this for our NYE celebration in San Francisco. It fits perfectly and hugs the curves in all the right places.  I wore it with a petticoat underneath and added the belt (as I personally didn't care for the red/green stripes).  My BF was OVER the moon with the look.  The lace was not itchy at all and the dress is very comfortable. The skirt may be heavier than some may expect (but that's somewhat normal for these type of dresses). I liked it so much, I came back to see if they have other colors/prints!"
5.0,It was a gift for my wife and she loved it
5.0,great quality and you can adjust it to a variety of lengths
5.0,I have a flat feet and I have a bone spurt because of of my flat feet but the doctor told me to get good support and see if it helps with the pain. and I order it for my work shoes and for a while I forgot that I had pain. it is comfortable for my steel toe shoes and I am very pleased with this product and it has a wonderful support that is not too hard or too soft.
5.0,Great for my wife who is legally blind.  It has definitely improved her quality of life.
5.0,Very authentic well made totally happy.
5.0,"This mask is ideal to be legal if masks are a priority.  It is a little difficult  to breath so I removed the inside glued on cloth covers; then they were fine to breathe in after that.  One of the straps slipped free, but sticking it back where it slipped out of and tying an overhand knot to keep the strap from slipping out again was a real easy fix."
5.0,Love it super cute with jeans or leggins. As someone else reviewed it is a little clingy so nothing a light shape wear can't fix
5.0,I really like this long sleeve hensley. I love the color pink this long sleeve came in.
5.0,Good quality....not too heavy...vibrant color
5.0,Great quality especially for the price!! I would order again in multiple colors if I have the need! I received many compliments.

5.0,Came as expected. Christmas gift for my boyfriend I’m sure he will love them
5.0,"I love this dress!  I am very particular about the way my clothes fit, so I was a little nervous about ordering a dress online. Much to my surprise and relief, this fit perfectly. It is a nice light, yet soft material. I'm 5'6&#34; & it hits just about an inch above the knee. It's loose fitting in the mid section, and hangs beautifully. I'll be buying more!"
5.0,"this dress is wonderfully comfy and looks beautiful. I ordered two of these from this listing and one was much shorter than the other. I also purchased the off-white version of this one elsewhere and had to return it because it was extremely see-through, but this dark blue is not. The v-neck can be tacked closed if I really need to, but so far so good. I may need to buy a few more of these in different colors."
5.0,"ITs perfect, the pendulum is more especial than others. Its easy to use and I can feel the energy. I bougth this product becouse it is importan by detecting the energetic field of the things. I love it."
5.0,I bought for my 10 yr old granddaughter for sleeping shorts. They run slightly smaller and shorter than many other brands. But for around $1 a pair they are awesome. She loves them because there is no &#34;pee hole&#34;. She wears them under her shirts as well.
5.0,Very cute. Loved the size and several pockets
5.0,My boyfriend gets compliments on them every time he wears them.
5.0,Beautiful scarf...used it for a gift
5.0,Great material. Thick and flattering.  The bottom is very flowy and the top is fitted.  I usually wear a size 8-10 dress and I got and XL based on the size chart and other reviews.  The dress quality is great.  You will need a steamer to get the wrinkles out from packaging but once they are out it is beautiful.
5.0,Super soft and just right for my pre-teen.
5.0,"Excellent quality, holds firearm securely.<br />Description was right on."
5.0,"Lots of compliments! A size up from normal, per reviews/ size chart, is perfect."
5.0,"Hermosa pulsera con material de cuero de calidad y una buena terminación, digna para un regalo por el día del padre"

5.0,"The best thing for my night driving! I no longer have to be nervous when driving after dark, they work great!"
5.0,"The entire experience was great. Nice packaging, the unbox was good, it had a magnetic box. Nice materials throughout the wallet. If you are trying to carry just your essentials, this is the way to go."
5.0,"Love it! The knit is a nice weight. Arrives as it looks online, as expected"
5.0,This product is warm and soft inside. Very comfortable fit
5.0,Fast shipping and the product is great.
5.0,"Perfect fit! The dress is Exactly what I hoped it would be. The fit was perfect. I'm 5'5"", 105lbs and ordered a small. The dress is beautiful velvet, very comfortable. Love that it had a side zipper, so easy to get on.  I got it in green. The color is a deep jewel tone, perfect for the holiday. Paired it with black patterned tights and received lots of complements at my party. This dress will be a repeat for me."
5.0,This necklace is beautiful. Exactly what I wanted for the price I paid.
5.0,I love this shirt. It works well as a layering piece as well as a shirt. For jeans & skirts.<br />So incredibly comfy!
5.0,Comfortable. Good protection for your eyes.  Fast service.
5.0,Very nice quality. I like all the different charms. The box was cute!
5.0,They work well for me at night also.
5.0,Good fit bad smell
5.0,"My wife love it, i said they are not sexy at all but she said they are the most comfortable she has use."
5.0,My daughter loves it and easy to wash washing machine or hand wash comes out great
5.0,Sleeves not as long as I usually prefer but still long enough to be doable.  V neck is the right depth to show an appropriate amount of cleavage there for being office worthy.  Other than length of sleeves I thought the fit was great.
5.0,"These fit well and wear great. The size is 12mm as specified and the color is as described.  If I needed another pair, I'd 100% buy these again."
5.0,"They are beautiful and look expensive.  The fit is perfect, they are everything and more that the seller sais they would be."
5.0,Being forced to wear face covering these days I find these are the only breathable ways to go.
5.0,These are great for when you have a cold. I use these instead of using tissue. Great to have in your bag.
5.0,"These are really great pants. Worked perfectly to replace the ones my instructor bought (they were a size too big). The ones she bought were a &#34;high quality name brand&#34;, i guess, but these look exactly the same!"
5.0,VERY sturdy! The zipper to make more room is a life saver. I carry this everywhere with me.
5.0,Fits great great quality
5.0,The great style a one of a kind classic I love it
5.0,This bag is really great - the outside wallet is very spacious - the color is a deep purple - goes with a lot of things - easy to handle - stress free
5.0,It's beautiful.  My husband really likes it a lot.
5.0,"Great glasses for the price. They don't seem like they'll break too quickly. I can wear them while driving or cycling, with no danger of falling off. LASHION Sports Polarized Sunglasses aren't a well-known brand, but names don't mean much. These work fine. The polarization is good and isn't too dark. I could see fine. For $20 currently, I'd be happy to recommend these."
5.0,"Very nice quality. Beautiful bib! Bought to put on diaper cake, fell in love with it!"
5.0,"Wonderful and very striking when worn. Unfortunately, they are too big (too wide) for my face and head, so I will be giving them away. Polarized (for eye protection) and dark, like I like shades, they make it easy to see when the sunshine is fierce. Mine came with a polishing cloth and a felt holder. Very nice!"
5.0,"These ombre leggings are super cute.  I ordered a S/M.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 114 lbs.  They were a tad bit loose around the lower stomach area & groin area but not enough to be feel uncomfortable or look odd.  The legging material it self is very soft, breatheable, & holds sweat well. They are not see through & pass the squat test.  I ran on the arc trainer for 1 hour & did 1 hour of weight machines at the gym with them on.  They held up great & stayed in place during my whole run.  I would order another pair of these leggings in a different color.  They are a good value for their price of $16."
5.0,Earings show up nicely with longer hair.
5.0,The fit is awesome!
5.0,Love this and the color:) I’ll be buying more:)
5.0,Super cute midi length dress! Ended up buying more colors... breathable cotton accentuates all the right places while being comfortable! Wish they have more colors in my size!
5.0,This dress is super flowy and cute. It does a great job of hiding the midsection.
5.0,"I love this shirt, It is extremely comfortable, lightweight and the color is very pretty. It fits a little on the loose side which I like as I am not wanting anything to constricting. I have a long torso and this shirt covers my stomach completely even with it tied at the bottom. I will say the color is maroon rather than the brown/red in the description but I’m ok with that."
5.0,"Ive been using this wallet as a checkbook cover for about a year now and its held up great,  and its stylish."
5.0,Very cute. It made a nice gift.

5.0,"My granddaughter was very thrilled with her Spider-Girl Pantyhose - the color, texture, and fit were perfect and matches a costume she already owns."
5.0,"These are the softest p.js. ever. So comfortable. Fit is good, XL, I wear 16, and these are loose like they should be. Ordered others too."
5.0,Very cute lunch box with a good amount of space. Would recommend.
5.0,My child LOVES it! And it got here faster than expected
5.0,"Dress arrived with fit, quality, and condition as hoped.  Very flattering, true to size, thick/ forgiving material. Length was perfect for regular heels (I’m 5ft 5in). When I contacted the seller about a shipping issue, they responded very well and ensured I got the dress in time for my event."

5.0,Soft and pretty. Nice neutral color. Runs a little short.
5.0,I ordered a pair of these last week and they were AMAZING. So amazing I ordered another pair a few days later. I just got those in and they fit completely different and the material felt different. I was very disappointed. Especially because I had recommended them to a lot of people and it seems they are inconsistent.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW: after I wrote this review I was contacted directly by the seller apologizing for the inconsistency. She had told me that the second pair I got was in fact a different material that the first pair. She offered to send me a free pair of leggings that were the material of my first pair. I was shocked with the customer service I received. she was very prompt to replying and definitely wanted me to be satisfied. I am very happy!
5.0,Price and quality fit and finish just what I was looking for looks great on my watch
5.0,"Got this because I absolutely adore Medic from TF2, and I love this! You can adjust the straps that go around your ear, theres a things for your nose so hot air doesn’t go to your eyes, its washable and it looks great! I was pleasantly surprised to find the print on the mask wasn’t super pixelated :3 this is definitely for those who love Medic and wanna show it off during this pandemic 😷"
5.0,Perfect!! Ordered it for my daughter's 18th birthday shoot and she loved it! She's a tiny lil thing and the small was just right for her! Good stretch to it!
5.0,Very smart and look awesome. I like too much.
5.0,I purchased four different strappy sports bras at the same time and this is one of my favorites. It is comfortable and supportive.
5.0,To large  didn't like material
5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous charms! Well made and even prettier in person. A good weight, unlike some I've purchased that were too lightweight. These are PERFECT!"
5.0,Gorgeous!!!! Have to rebuy every 4 months cuz the gems be falling out but it's a eye grabber. I'm sure if I put super glue around it it would solve that issue
5.0,Just what we wanted. Fast delivery
5.0,Super cute top probably my favorite and really affordable
5.0,"My daughter loves them.. shipped fast, exactly as expected."

5.0,Love the look and design.
5.0,"Very cute and infantile, I bought these in their largest size for a 150lb person and they still fit, granted very tightly. Stretchable and the material seems pretty tough as they haven’t ripped or fallen apart after lots of usage and washes."
5.0,This band looks and feels great! My husband needed something that looked a little more professional in order to wear his Fitbit to nice functions. This band is perfect. It was very easy to adjust and remove links. It looks exactly like the pictures. Does not disappoint.
5.0,Very comfy. One of my favorite things to wear on the weekends.
5.0,It is so cute. we love it.
5.0,Too large for me but so warm and comfortable I kept them and wear them anyway
5.0,"I love this dress, received so many compliments. I Ordered the purple in a 2xl and it fit great.  The material is pretty thin and see through, but I just wore a whole slip."
5.0,Light weight and hangs nicely. Fits as described.
5.0,These glass are great for style at a great price. Semi sturdy but good for a day out at kids games or by the pool.
5.0,Love this. It has a deep crown so shades my eyes and face well.
5.0,"I love this passport holder!  It holds all of my cards, ID and passport easily and the bright color helps me to quickly locate it in my purse/backpack."
5.0,"Love it! Nice casual dress for a stroll at the beach, waterfront, or to a BBQ!"
5.0,Works great just what I was looking for 🙏awesome just what I was looking for
5.0,"Nice product, comfortable, overpriced, it looked very beady after one delicate hand wash."
5.0,"Ordered one and regretted instantly that I didn't order another...so I ordered a 2nd one.  Today, I received the first one and ordered thre more.  I plan on giving one of these with an Essential oil to several ladies I love for Christmas.  I will pop back with a further review on the function after Christmas and feedback from the ladies.  The look is nice, chain seems sturdy, and many options of felt colors and uses for other oils. I chose this one over other necklaces because the reviews were better and stated that these don't leak.  I am hoping this is true and will find out after Christmas. GREAT LOOKING PRODUCT.  It would also be nice if the felt pads weren't so vibrant in color for &#34;softer&#34; spirited temperaments."
5.0,This is the most detailed Tree of Life pendant that I have seen. Lovely detail on the tree as well as the background. I have also given this as a gift as well as have purchased for myself. I would consider this item for a gift in the future.
5.0,"Esto me ha ayudado mucho a quitarme los lentes de contactos, gracias a esto es q los puedo usar . Tengo uñas largas así que esto es mi mejor aliado"
5.0,Cutest lunch box ever! Lots of space for my big bowls!
5.0,very comfortable..serves its purpose
5.0,"These socks are everything a girl could want- fit great, soft even after a few washes, and cute cats. The socks arrived on time and packaged well. The fit was great (size 8.5) If you have a bit of a smaller foot though, they might be a little big. The design is exactly as pictured, and very cute. I've washed them about 7 times now with no fading or stretching. I'm glad I ordered all six."
5.0,I get so many compliments on this little thing. Everyone loves it. It IS chunky though- so dont expect a compact size.
5.0,"Me encanto, súper elegante y cómodo"
5.0,"I go on many fishing trips with my family. We generally share one huge tackle box and then spread out a ways when we are fishing. This vest has so many pockets that I can store every necessity. When I wear the vest, I don’t need to make multiple trips to the tackle box and can spend all of my time fishing. The material is very light-weight and still, durability is not a factor. The mesh inner lining breathes well and fits comfortably. This is a great vest for the seasoned fisherman and matches the quality found in sporting good stores.<br />I purchased this product at a discount for a fair and unbiased review. I reserve the right to change my review based on any change in product quality in order to provide a fair and accurate review to consumers."
5.0,I love them because I can relax in them.
5.0,"Couldn’t have picked a better jacket for this freezing weather. Not ideal for hotter climates If your looking for a light jack. Made very well, as advertised, perfect fit, love the fur, and the metal zipper as extremely sturdy!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
5.0,These are cute glasses…I’ve gotten compliments on the purple and red. It’s nice to have multiple pairs to keep in different places & these are less expensive than the drugstore

5.0,"Great necklace,very stylish!"
5.0,"LOVE so warm, cute, and well made for price!"
5.0,Good quality. Mom likes it.
5.0,Great price. Washed many times and all is well.
5.0,Los colores vivos y Regio Camuflaje
5.0,Soft material. Just a little looser than I normally like but not boxy. Standard length. Love the magenta-ish color. I had at least five compliments the first day I wore it. Super cute to wear to work at school on fridays.
5.0,Works very well.  Excellent quality.
5.0,REALLY NICE-GREAT QUALITY-FITS WELL
5.0,Beautiful color.  Matches the pictures. Fine silk.
5.0,I love the ones I got for myself. So I purchased the male version for gift. I kept receiving the incorrect size. I was frustrated and returned them. Have not tried again.
5.0,Using everyday but needed for travel on airlines.  Little stiff at first but I think will soften with wear.
5.0,"I ordered several pairs of these from different sellers and I think these are my favorite. They are seamless, very comfortable, and shorter than most which I like. Some of the other ones I have bought are too long for me, I don’t need them to go all the way up to my armpits."
5.0,These will be perfect for me bridal party!
5.0,"They were originally for my daughter, but she didn't want them so I put those myself and I love them."
5.0,"This item is what I expected. It does seem to run a bit small, but I assumed that much before I ordered it. A medium fits my teenager perfectly who is normally a small."
5.0,Super flattering and hides all the trouble areas. I would definitely order again in another color!
5.0,Nice and not cheap looking at all!
5.0,Very pretty ! Ideal for hot weather.
5.0,"These masks look, feel great and keep you safe!"
5.0,"Good looking watch and keeps perfect time. If you look at these watches closely or check the insides, there are no gears whatsoever. It's a circuit board with a pin coming out of it to attach the arms of the watch to. Then I started to understand how these watches are so inexpensive. This is a nice looking watch that keeps perfect time @ a very,very low price. How long it will last, only TIME WILL TELL."
5.0,Nice quality. Very elegant looking.
5.0,The fabric doesn't exactly look the same but still a nice dress.
5.0,Exactly what it looks like in the picture
5.0,Espectacular I beber imagino how wonderful is it.
5.0,"Adorable dress, was a gift from my husband! Not only is it cute on its own, but excellent for an Alice in Wonderland costume too! I'm 5'4"" and weigh about 195lbs and the XL fits like a glove"
5.0,Excellent addition to your pens collection durable and heavy
5.0,Very nice kids watch
5.0,"Love love love the fir, feel, color and they stay in place!!"
5.0,Gave this to my 9 year old grandson for his birthday....he dresses up like a rapper and has a great time with the necklace.
5.0,"Esta bien hermoso 🥰 y esta muy suavecito, me encanto!!! ❤️🙏🏻"
5.0,Worked great walking through the snow.  I doubled up for extra protection not knowing how a single boot would work.
5.0,"Gift for niece, she will love it."
5.0,"Really excellent bathing suit for the high wasted gal.<br />Purchased this for my daughter, totally classy bikini that doesnt show too much.<br /><br />Definetly runs small, daughter is typically a medium but ordered xl and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />Would order from this company again."
5.0,"Super cute. I could lose 5 pounds and make it look even more dope. But... it's an internal judgement. It really looks good. Feels good.  I have been roller coastering 160-170 @ 5'8.5"" and after 4 kids. Its beautiful.  Less self judgment. More self love. I will look bomb af in this in a month. Js."
5.0,"I really like this scarf.I wanted that tassled look with the scarf.This look has been in for men for the past four years(2009). This scarf is really cool.I love the houndstooth design and the material is very lightweight.Beware,it does have a very strong gasoline like odor.I washed this scarf twice and I sprayed Febreeze on it about 4 times.The smell has been replaced with a very fresh odor.I would recommend this scarf to any fashionable man or woman.The fabric is very delicate.I would be very careful handling this.I wouldn't tie this scarf very tightly(It's loosely woven)."
5.0,It is original
5.0,"Really, it's perfect. No down leakage, super cosy. Hood is awesome, washes well."
5.0,I bought this for three of my friends. They loved it. It's a great message for anyone going through hard times. I would definitely purchase again.
5.0,LOVE THEM :)
5.0,This beautiful link transforms a basic watch to a stylist night out. It's easy to put on as well as adjustable.
5.0,Really cute love the durability of these gloves and the fact that the baby pink color really is true to the picture
5.0,These socks are great and last forever. I work 12 hour shifts and they really hold up and make my legs feel supported.
5.0,I can't say I had any idea what a ruana was as I ordered this...I would have called it a decorative shawl.  When this arrived - I was amazed at hour beautiful and soft it was.  I probably won't wear it too often - but it is just perfect for a couple of fancy occasions I have coming up!<br /><br />It's a bit longer than I thought it would be - which is great.  Since these are winter events - the extra length added to the soft warmth will be perfect!
5.0,"I don't usually buy clothes online for fear of a bad fit, but this dress was too cute to pass up and I am not disappointed! I love how it flairs out. It is flirty, vintage bliss! To get a proper fit, be sure to consult the Yacun sizing chart, provided in the photo section of the product listing.<br /><br />The fabric has an elastic stretch for a flattering fit. I am small up top and some dresses are too baggy in the chest but this one fits beautifully on account of the elasticy fabric. The skirt goes below the knee and I am looking into buying a petticoat to complete the look. This dress, even without the addition of a petticoat, make me feel so feminine and pretty! It is just adorable!<br /><br />The seams are well sewn, the zipper glides without issue, and Imfound no issues with the fabric anywhere. My daughter loves this dress so much she is begging me to buy her a matching one. I love that is dress is flattering on a 40 something woman but appeals to a teenager!<br /><br />Although this was a prime item, the dress was shipped from China and took nearly 2 weeks to arrive. That wasn't a problem for me, but don't expect 2 day service. It was worth the wait!!<br /><br />I love this dress and can't wait to hit the dance floor in it! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and unbiased opinion. Like you, I consider buyer reviews before making online purchases. I hope my review has provided some helpful insight. If so, please vote below. Happy shopping"
5.0,"These leggings are super soft and comfy! I ordered the white ones and they are a little see through, but It's fine for me as I usually pair with long shirts."
5.0,Perfect my husband love them
5.0,"When I saw these shoes on Amazon, I thought how cute.  For the price, I figured it was worth a shot at purchasing and wearing with my spring/summer clothes.  The shoes arrived today, and I couldn't be happier!  The shoes are as pictured, and the quality is higher than I expected.  The shoes fit very well.  I wear a 7.5 regular width and the 38 is perfect.  I am so happy I bought these shoes, and I am looking forward to my next purchase with AvaCostume.  There is no way I could have found anything like this in Western Pennsylvania and if I did, the cost would probably be at boutique prices.  The shoes are that cute."
5.0,Super soft and great quality screen printing. Washes beautifully.
5.0,"I love this! The design is super cute. I like how it's comfy. No compression, but also flattering. The nylon/spandex fabric combination is great - the fabric glides together nicely when you're walking, and isn't clingy and weird like other anti-chaffing shorts."
5.0,I liked the look of it and fit perfect!!
5.0,"These shorts are very comfortable and hold up well to frequent washing & keep their color & shape. I’m 62 years old, so like the length of them, a couple of inches above my knee.  I like the deep side pockets as well.  They pair well with any kind of top. They are a little more expensive on Amazon vs Walmart, but the fit is so great I didn’t mind paying a little more to get some colors I couldn’t find."
5.0,Thank you for the belly bar!!
5.0,"I’ve had this necklace since 2019, it is currently 2023 and it’s still going strong. The chain is very durable. I’ve showered in it and everything. Not tarnished at all. Love it!"
5.0,"I like to use the cd's in the car while on longer journeys, and pray along with it. also the scriptural passeges are inspiring and memorable"
5.0,This was exactly what we were looking for to finish my son’s ensemble. Couldn’t find anything else like this and in this color.(excuse the Durag)
5.0,They’re incredibly comfortable I plan on wearing them on Christmas. Thanks
5.0,"These have the right amount of stretch and fit great. Very flattering and I love that I paid $40 (I usually buy these from Bohme and pay $70ish). I'm also 5'4"" and find ankle length jeans a challenge. These were great. I normally wear an 8/10 and bought a 27 and 28 and both fit perfectly fine."
5.0,"No problems at all. All pairs great, comfortable, no slipping, good quality."
5.0,Comfortable and perfectly sized.

5.0,"Very nice material true to size and color very comfortable looks nice in casual events and just casual or for exercising. I loved it. I got a large so it can fit loose, my top body is not so big im a Bcup 28waist so it did the job."

5.0,Comfortable and dries quickly making it convenient to use and keep fresh and clean.
5.0,I wear this one when I want to make a statement.
5.0,"These holders are very easy to use and very comfortable - unlike some of those where you have to shove the whole end of your glasses into the sleeve, making it bulky over your ear.  These have a small but secure rubber clip that allows you to move it wherever on the ear piece you want.  The colors are fun and the price can't be beat!"
5.0,Nice sound quality
5.0,Very good tank wicks away moisture and comfortable washes up great
5.0,"LOVEEEE THIS DRESS! I got the orange and white print. Its super soft, flattering and the adjustable tie in the front is great. Definitely recommend it."
5.0,"Love the color! As someone who usually goes with dark colored frames, I was happy with how these brightened my face. They are sturdy and of good quality."
5.0,"I bought size M, Pattern 10, to use as a bathing suit cover-up. Very happy with the colors and design.  Before wearing it for the first time I washed it and burned holes on the sleeve when I attempted to iron it. I sent a message to the seller telling what happened and they sent me a new dress that just arrived today. I'm very impressed with the excellent customer service! I like both this dress and the yellow bathing suit I bought from them.  (Jeff's wife)."
5.0,"I bought it for my grandson, he loves it!"
5.0,So soft and comfortable. Caveat that I only washed them once but they didn’t come out wrinkled and we’re still soft. Bought them for my stepdaughter and can’t wait to get them myself. They come in cute packaging. Great gift for someone too
5.0,"I love this hat. It has a mesh lining which will be wonderful for the pool or when it is hot, love the drawstring option for the chin, and love the cinching option for the middle of the hat as well. Completely satisfied with this purchase and I will be buying more in different colors/patterns."

5.0,"Love this dress and the color. Can be dressed up or down. I am 5ft4in, 127 lbs and the small fit me perfect."
5.0,Thank you for a beautiful band! The finish looks like it's a well loved favorite band and I'm pretty sure it will be just that for me...If you could just tweak it one little bit and add just one more hole for women with smaller wrist. I'll take it to the jeweler and she'll do it for me with no problem so just something to keep in mind. I love the tool which will save my fingernail. Good value for the money.
5.0,Love this ring! Will definitely be ordering another one for my husband!
5.0,Cute Steelers gift!
5.0,Very nice bathing suit.  Very happy with it.
5.0,"In US shirt sizes I typically wear a medium, sometimes a small. I ordered a small in this since a number of reviews mentioned it ran a bit big in size. It came in early and fit perfect. It looks awesome. The black material is soft. LOVE THIS SHIRT. So happy with my purchase."
5.0,"Fit as described, we bought too large but made it work.  My husband got compliments all day on this “Derby” suit."
5.0,Adorable piece!  I love this item!
5.0,"These bows are flippin' adorable! I ordered them for my 6mo. old and they're still fitting great at 12 mo. with no signs of being too small soon. I love the stretch so they accommodate months of growth, and the exaggerated bow size is SO CUTE! One thing - if you have an active baby, you may want to sew (or hot glue) the bow into the loop. They built it so you can remove and go for the turban look, but my baby always seems to want to pull the bow out ! So cute, buy them immediately!"
5.0,Great Shirt Grandson loved it!
5.0,I absolutely love this but I'm glad I ordered a size bigger. A large fits me perfectly and I wear mediums in everything. Olive color is perfect to throw on with jeans and brown boots. I'll grab some more soon.
5.0,"Good quality. I am a CDL driver and needed a laundry bag to store my dirty clothes on overnight runs, the 15""x22"" bag fits my need perfectly!"
5.0,It was a gift and my grandson loves it!
5.0,"Better than the photo, I love these earrings!"
5.0,"Like this, pattern obscures fact that underwear pattern can be seen against white parts of pattern. Will have to get some neutral underwear. Will keep me cool in hot Texas summers while still covering my legs so it achieves the ultimate goal and is ridiculously low cost."
5.0,"very nice glasses, great visibility."
5.0,Got these for work. Much nicer looking than regular safety glasses and the bifocal is at the right place so you're not straining your eyes.
5.0,I get so many compliments on these glasses. The pink color pops and the lens are wonderfully reflective.
5.0,Use this wallet everyday.  Great wallet.  Keeps everything I need compact and in my front pocket.
5.0,"Aesthetically appealing and very soft, which is what I wanted. :)"
5.0,Perfect for my vacation to look a little nicer than my flip flops but still have the arch support I need in all my shoes.
5.0,These arrived promptly and in efficient packaging. I didn't need 12 fangs but it was a better value than buying a single set. Well done.
5.0,"Super cute,  love the lace detailing, hard to find anything this luxe in this price range"
5.0,Very nice item love the feel of the material. It fits wonderfully and I love it.
5.0,"For my ears, looked good kind of large..."

5.0,works great and well made...  Well worth the money!!!
5.0,"Exactly as described, material is good, brand new, size fits perfectly , brand new with a cute box recommend it to others."
5.0,Easy to figure out but very tiny
5.0,Color needed
5.0,I normally wear a size small or medium but wanted this to be loose so I ordered the large. The fit I was going for was perfect. I received multiple compliments on this cover up while on vacation. When I got back I ordered another one in a different color. It washed well which is another plus.
5.0,"This thing made it on a two-week vacation.  Held up to airline baggage handling, trains, and trunks."
5.0,"I wore these so much just after  I bought them... so many people complimented them, said they look expensive- I have a long neck ( you can't tell in my photo but they are long so great)"
5.0,got my bagged packed and ready to go
5.0,Socks fit great and are not tight.  I was a little worried they would be uncomfortable to wear.  They give you good support without feeling too tight to the point where you want to take them off.  I would recommend for long flights!
5.0,I’m wearing this as a kilt pin. Looks great. Has decent weight.
5.0,"I am impressed by these socks.  They are just the weight I want in sandals, and are surprisingly comfortable.  I also like the symmetry of the design--it makes me want to show them off."
5.0,I purchased these same glasses from CalmOptics for $45 with a $10 warranty. I tested these glasses against the blue light I got from CalmOptics and they work just as good. They tested great against the blue light. Check out my YouTube channel for the review at LongHairAyeBee.
5.0,Love my sweater. Want more of them
5.0,Exactly what I needed!!!
5.0,These insoles work great for my very high inner arches.
5.0,"These shoes are really comfortable. They do run a half size large. I am usually a 7 1/2, ordered a size 7."
5.0,"I think this is a fine wallet if you are looking for something slim, but it only has four pockets for credit cards, plus a display slot for a driver's license. If you need to carry more cards, you can probably slip a couple into each pocket, but each card will add bulk to the wallet, which kind of defeats the whole thing about being slim. After carrying a bulky wallet for years, I really like how slim this one is, but I have had to reduce the number of cards that I carry. There's a tradeoff in everything, right? Some reviewers complained that the money clip was loose and did not hold bills in place. I have not found that to be the case with my wallet. The removable clip in my wallet seems to hold the bills just fine."
5.0,Bought these as a gift for someone and they really loved the jewelry!
5.0,So beautiful!!!! Thank you!!!!
5.0,Really like having 3 different sized but unfortunately not of those sizes worked for me. I do not believeit is a bag that will stand up to the test of time but it is good for it's price.
5.0,As described.  Nice product. Great price.
5.0,Usually I wear a size s or xs in skirts. I ordered a size s. It fits perfect and I can even wear some winter leggings. The fabric is very soft and warm. The zipper on the side takes a little getting used to but after wearing it two or three times it is easy. The quality is good - I did not expect less from Jack Wolfskin.
5.0,Great really protects my arms
5.0,Nice  flat belt
5.0,Perfect for my men who hate when their gaiters slip down.  These adjustable gaiters are very comfortable and soft and don’t suck into your mouth when you breathe or talk.  The colors are rich and vibrant!  Will definitely purchase more!
5.0,"These are super handy for all sorts of things! I use them for all my hobbies, namely fly fishing and disc golf. A great tool for connecting gear and keeping things together. Can’t beat the price!"
5.0,"This was amazing! I love red and have been trying to find a really nice high waist one. This was perfect. It comes a little bit below the belly button me. I got an xs based on other people's review. It is snug, but it fits my curves perfectly. haha. I ended up using this in a photo-op. It was amazing! I loved it and would highly suggest getting more Tesla brands."
5.0,"Maybe I’m a freak but the cut, construction and color of the blazer was great for me. I wear 18w in most CK dresses but chose a 16w for this blazer. I am 44-39-42 and flabby.  The lining of this jacket is sectional, not a true full satin lining. I feel like I can really move and work in this garment; feels cooler than my regular CK Lux blazers. . I absolutely love it.  Love it so much, I bought two so I’ll have a spare when I wear out the first one."
5.0,Had a lot of  complements on my necklace the only thing I have a problem with I couldn’t hardly get it fasten
5.0,I think these are super cute charms. They appear sturdy and of a medium size. Perfect for my project.
5.0,Great material and exactly as described!
5.0,"I purchased this product as a give away for our ""Adult"" Shark Week lunch and everyone love them. Some were still wearing them the next day or even hanging them in their cubicle at work. It was sturdy, not cheaply made. I say adult lunch because the item is described as a product almost for a child birthday party. Well I can tell you, adults can wear them too . Great product, thank you."
5.0,"Ok, I just got this today but I already love it. It’s longer than I expected, I’m 5’7” and it goes just above my knee. It looks like I can wear it over tights or leggings (which is what I bought it for), or actually I can wear it easily on its own."
5.0,Excellent buy!! This is what I needed during recovery from shoulder surgery
5.0,Great durable and affordable waterproof watch great for days you’re working or out in water and don’t have to worry about messing up an expensive watch. I use this watch for when I go to beach and water/land metal detecting because it’s durable and waterproof. My father always had this same model watch growing up since I was kid and now he got me same one for when I get out metal detecting and I love this watch . Great affordable and durable this thing is like a tank! Reason this same model has been out for so many years . My only is when you press the light button it doesn’t do great job lighting up whole screen but only top corner to about halfway across which is just enough to be able to read in dark. Other than that great piece budget durable watch! Highly recommend!!
5.0,It is quite big - beware if you have smaller hands. Really really beautiful to look at.
5.0,Love it so many compliments
5.0,"I love these sunglasses! Although they arent very &#34;sturdy&#34;, they look great and for the price im not worried about them breaking. They came super fast too"

5.0,These pants fit great and I feel like a 70s queen in them
5.0,Well made very adjustable. Washes well.
5.0,"They stay on amazingly well and are easily adjustable. Beautiful yet simple. Only downer is, like clip-on earrings, they hurt kinda bad for the first few days till you and your ears get used to them. Still 5/5 stars."
5.0,My 2 year old loves these boots! They are very durable and water proof. I would purchase again!
5.0,"I got these at a discount price and they are worth the price! They’re comfortable, keep your feet warm, and cute."
5.0,"These are the perfect earrings, so many colors and they're all beautiful.  I love hoops and Leetie Lovendale has the best, one sure to match anything in your wardrobe!"
5.0,I had not seen Moon Boots for awhile.  They are easy to pack and don't take up much room in a suitcase.  The four pairs I ordered arrived promptly and fit great.
5.0,I love this sweater. The quality is great. It’s a nice weight and not itchy. It fits perfectly and true to size. I have several pieces from grace Karin and I love them all. They wash up very well and last a long time. I would buy again in heart beat.
5.0,Makes my legs feel good even when I'm on my feet all day
5.0,"AWESOME. Had an issue with the first one, and they sent another without me asking them too! WOW! Thant was gracious! Ill be back for more goods! THANK YOU THANK YOU!"
5.0,Love it! It's very well made with a bit of a stretch.
5.0,"Had to adjust the shoulder straps, otherwise fit perfectly. Loved the color."
5.0,Worked great for my watch just had to take it to a jeweler to have it put on.  Defiantly worth the money so I can keep my watch I love.
5.0,Received compliments all the time.  It is great for both dress up and casual.  Plus it makes me smile whenever I wear it.
5.0,"This is highly recommended product for hiker and biker as well.<br /><br />One of the most comfortable pairs of commuter bike shorts in my cycle wardrobe. Soft, comfortable, quality material, and great color.<br /><br /> At first I wasn't sure if I would like to removable padded shorts but that was definitely a plus as I can wear with other shorts. Lots of zipper pockets to secure items.<br /><br />Definitely one of my favorite shorts to wear when riding."
5.0,Pretty but big.
5.0,Best one to buy
5.0,I could use a little smaller.
5.0,So much more beautiful than I expected
5.0,"Very cute skirt, exactly what I was looking for just too small. Ordered a Large (I'm 140lbs and 5'7) and typically wear an 8."
5.0,"I have new cartilage piercings and lost my studs, these are great replacements. I have very sensitive skin and the studs didn’t react negatively to my piercings. My piercings are healing up nice without any trouble."
5.0,"Love the look of these shoes!  be aware they have buckles that will need fastening, no velcro."
5.0,"It was a gift for a person's retirement. She was happy to receive it, she loves to camp"
5.0,I'm 5'7...190lbs. I purchased a size medium and the fit was spot on. This coat is so beautiful! The only thing I had to do was steam the wrinkles out. I read some of the reviews and they had a issue with the belt...the belt didn't look cheap to me. I received tons of compliments!
5.0,Good Quality and the tactile function is 100% Helpful...<br />Thanks
5.0,The material and fit of these sweatshirts is awesome!!
5.0,"like everyone else I have bought several masks in an effort to find something that's safe and comfortable and I am happy to say these mask are all that and more.  These are affordable and adjustable and I can actually breathe in these.  I don't usually write reviews, but I had to share this with anyone who is still looking.  I highly reccommend this product."
5.0,Beautiful! I kept one for me and gave the other to my sister.
5.0,"These baseball caps are beautiful and lovely.  They are adjustable so they can fit everyone. In addition, I like their color！"
5.0,"This shirt fits great! I’ve got that mom belly pouch, so the style on the bottom is perfect for that. It’s form fitting on top so it accentuates the best part of my body. I got the medium in red and I’m 5’2” 145 lbs 32DD"
5.0,Is it the best compression socks I've ever had! They stay up they don't slow down and they're not too tight
5.0,Fit just right. I got a medium and I loved the way it looked on me. It does show off all the curves so if you’re not comfortable with that then I would size up.
5.0,good rain boots
5.0,More brasey looking than I'd hoped- but worth the price- light weight- easy to put on- pleased-
5.0,The hinges are pretty cool and make them fit nicely
5.0,"Nice hat,fires perfectly."
5.0,"It is gorgeous watch , Love it ! I am always like to have a big width watch one but this watch little big smaller than I though.<br />But It so beautiful that  I don’t even want to return it ."
5.0,Great shoes for kids with afos! I’ll never buy another brand after finding these!
5.0,Simply Beautiful.
5.0,This was a nice fit dress. I wore it to a KY derby themed bridal shower . A little stretch
5.0,"I don't get cold easily, but when I do, it's usually because the temperature is below 19°F. I also like to make sure I am extra bundled. I bought this jacket in the summer because I was scared of losing power and dealing with the cold once winter hit.<br /><br />Recently, it's been a combination of cold and windy making it feel like it's 10°F. I figured it was the perfect time to break this jacket. This jacket is huge. I ordered an XL and I'm pretty sure I could have gotten a large or even a medium and it would have fit. It does leave room for extra layers underneath, so the oversized fit is good for me. I love that the zipper is set up that I can unzip it at the bottom. It makes it easier when I have to sit down/drive. Once I actually had to go outside, the jacket did a great job at keeping me warm. The fabric feels lightweight but with the down feather lining, it insulates well. The hood is as oversized as the rest of the jacket, but it protected my face from the wind, kept my ears warm, and didn't mess up my hair (lol).<br /><br />Aesthetically, I love the blush pink color with the black zippers and lining. There are pullies inside the jacket that'll help cinch the waistline if that's how you want it to fit. I think it's pretty.<br /><br />All-in-all, I think this jacket will serve me well in the winter. It also helps alleviate some of my fear of freezing should I have to go without power and am limited to walking."
5.0,Love them perfect for daith piercing!
5.0,Very comfortable! Great socks for flying. Will definitely buy again
5.0,These socks are very comfortable and arrived very promptly!
5.0,A little more money but they are nice quality
5.0,"These are amazing. Bought them for a friend and she was obsessed. They are so cute, and they fit her well."
5.0,These are so cute!! I have big calves and they fit! I normally wear a 10 and I got the 11. They feel super comfy!
5.0,Quality is exceptional and they are very comfortable. They do run a little large. They are not as snug as I would like them to be but I still love them.
5.0,"I took this to a celebrity tournament. Perfect size, love the pop of color, and I was asked many times where I bought it."
5.0,The bracelet looks and feels great. It tightens and loosens nicely and won't fall off too easily. The only minor detail is the font is just bit smaller than what I expected but it's still beautiful and readable
5.0,"Great design ,material , and shading."
5.0,The perfect addition to any winter closet. So soft and stylish! Perfect!
5.0,"My tween wanted oversized sweaters that also made her feel pretty and this was perfect. She loves the colors, she’s tiny so we bought her a large and it was a fit very much like the model in the photo. She feels pretty and also comfortable and safe in this. As a mom. I couldn’t ask for more in an item of clothing for my daughter. Very happy with it."
5.0,fun bunny
5.0,"This is my favorite dress! I love Jayli clothes, and I wore it to a lot of festivals and Dead and Company summer tour. I got so many comments! The Stealie will never come off because it’s woven into the fabric."
5.0,I should've ordered a L and not XL. These are awesome though. I don't like that they don't have any pockets though
5.0,Nothing special but exactly what ud expect. I'm a smoker and wearing these in the winter makes the cold nj weather way more tolerable!
5.0,"i did not like the length so i ended up bringing it up a bit. it was PERFECT for my Sabrina Spellman halloween costume! i should have ordered a smaller size, but was worried about this being smaller as many online clothes are. but the size worked out it was just all a little loose!"
5.0,beautiful!!! very delicate...the pearly white background really sets off the 4 leaf clover...stainless chain is sparkly and nice because it won't tarnish.
5.0,Seems like good quality. Washed and did not shrink much. Size seems to be right on.
5.0,Fits expected. I’m 180lbs with a 43 inch bust.
5.0,"Fun watch!  Easy to read, lots of compliments, love how you can order straps in different colors and replace with the quick pin feature.  Great value for a whimsical watch!!"
5.0,My husband loves his father's day gift!!!!! He wears them out on special ocassions and gets compliments all the time!! Thank you for such a great product and I will be ordering more soon for other family members 😊
5.0,it worked! awesome!
5.0,Really like this hat! Great sound and comfy hat. My co-workers also liked it and asked if I would order some for them to give as gifts. So far I've ordered 23! I think that speaks for itself.
5.0,"This shirt jacket is great! It's warm but not too much and the fit is great, the quality is even nicer than the A&E ones and the pockets in the front are an added perk. It's definitely loose fitting as is the style. I purchased an XS for my 4'10, 87lb tween daughter and she loves it! It fits loser than it should but not where it looks frumpy."
5.0,I like it so far. I no longer have to drill an extra hole in the other standard belts due to not fitting correctly.
5.0,"Saw the Cocoon GRID IT featured in a tech blog and while it looked sort of strange, the concept seemed good.  TSA at DTW told me I had too much electronic crap in my backpack one evening, made me empty it all out and that was enough to convince me to give it a try.  Ordered the 12X8, since I carry way too many tech attachments (chargers, cables, a Mi Fi, etc.)  I am really pleased with it; the GRID IT is an extremely simple thing and the way it's ""woven"" with elastic straps makes it infinitely configurable.  No ""stretch outs"" noted on the straps.  I'll probably buy a smaller one at some point for the car."
5.0,My kid is in ballet currently wearing 3t clothes. These tights fit perfect and have plenty of stretch to allow room to grow.
5.0,"I bought this for my 12 y/o daughter as both a PJ and costume for Halloween!! She LOVES it! Its soft, no cooties, and looks great! Thank you!!"

5.0,"My wife's favorite watch, not sure when I bought this, but I was still in college<br />For years it has worked flawlessly and still going strong"
5.0,"I actually bought these at walmart... i have never wore briefs other than say 10 years ago i tried to wear them for my wife at the time, but i must have bought a crappy pair back then. These are superb! super soft and comfortable, not restrictive in manland at all, and contours the buttox very well also. 10/10! I ordered 3 more pairs from amazon since walmart didnt have my size.<br /><br />I will add amazon recommended large for me but i went medium, and even after washing and drying them (they shrunk a tiny bit) they are still super comfortable, so i would advise to only order 1 pack till you lock in the size you are comfortable with before you replace the entire underwear drawer."
5.0,Nice job! Ready for the industry golf tournament.
5.0,"Rain - the manufacturer - does wonderful ""Nature"" themed jewelry! I started buying this brand for a friend and try to find a new pair every year.  She loves them! Is so delighted to add to her collection."
5.0,Comfortable soft i like it alot
5.0,nice dress and nice stretchy material if you want it a little looser than skin tight order up a size.  I ordered a 12 and was just a little on the tight side but would work with shape wear.  I was going to return and realized a 12 is the largest it runs<br />hard to determine sizing on these dresses i am 5' 4 and 160'

5.0,"Love these, they are Sterling for starters. Look beautiful, delicate, sparkle is nice. I receive compliments all the time. Tip: to keep them in place without a worry, buy a pack of soft earring backs at craft store. Slide one on the pin on back. They stay in place without a back with just  a gentle squeeze, but the rubber back adds  extra security."

5.0,Very cozy and comfortable.  Well made.
5.0,"Great hat, even though its a man's hat and I am a female.  I have a large head and the &#34;one size fits all or most&#34; doesn't work with me.  I recently took a trip and this hat worked so well as far as the sun, rain and comfort."
5.0,"Awesome, awesome, awesome! I have several shapers, I'm not heavy, I'm 5'2 120lbs but I do have love handles I can't get rid of and a belly pooch from my c-section. I haven't been able to find a shaper that flattens my stomach and gives me the perfect hourglass shape! It really doesn't do anything to shape or lift the butt which I'm totally fine with because my waist looks tiny!!"
5.0,"This is what I wanted in a watch winder in the first place. My last one was purchased on Amazon and it was decent and worked well until 4-1/2 months later when it just died. It cost only $34.95 and was plastic and it reviewed well but I wasn't one of the lucky ones.<br />Looking around locally in the last 5 years, I've never seen a watch winder that cost less than $130.  That being said, Amazon is the only place where there are a multitude of choices to be made. I selected this one based mostly on the reviews and the styling of this winder at a fantastic price point. I only have 1 watch that needs a winder. It's an Omega Seamaster purchased in 1965. This winder is super quiet and there are no annoying bright blue lights like my last purchase. This one is solid at 3-1/2 lbs. with an almost 6&#34; square cube in size. It has a nice leather wrapped finish with white stitching and a soft felt bottom.  The inside is large and should accommodate any size watch easily.  The removable power adapter is long enough to sit atop a tall dresser and still reach the wall outlet near the baseboard.  The 4 cycle settings are adequate for any watch with instructions included.  One thing should be noted and that is when carefully unwrapped from its package, I was, at first, disappointed that the 'plexiglass' cover seemed somewhat blemished with scratches. Then I remembered that many items manufactured nowadays have a thin film of plastic attached to the surface to protect the glass finish but I couldn't see any point where I can start lifting the film off if there was a film attached. Being extremely careful, I used a sewing needle starting in the front left corner and and began to lift the film away from the plexiglas enough to grab the rest with my thumb and forefinger and slowly peel the film off in one solid piece which I managed to do successfully.  It now looked better but still not completely free of blemishes. I then discovered that the inside of the glass was also protected with a film. This was was more difficult to remove but I finally got it off and now the winder cube looks absolutely stunning. Consider this carefully before purchasing because I can see where trying to remove the film without care and patience will render the winder with a few unsightly scratches caused by you which could look worse than had you just left the original film in place.  Other than that small project, I am extremely delighted with my purchase. I reserve the right to adjust the star rating should this winder mechanically fail within the next two years. At $59.95, this winder is an excellent buy!"
5.0,Lots of Compliments

5.0,"This is a great pool tote - we packed it with pool shoes, an extra outfit, a large book, toiletries, and a bag of candy.  The small mesh pocket snide worked well for the lip balm, and the outer held the game room card.  Perfect for our use.<br /><br />Please note - there are no zippers, so no really secure pouches or parts to the bag.  I keep my valuables in a zipped toiletry pouch inside this open topped bag."
5.0,Bought these for a costume and they're great!
5.0,I really like the look of this Bible cover.

5.0,"The &#34;leather&#34; looks good and durable.  The clip is a bit strong, though, making it necessary to be very careful to not tear the bills.  Handy with the credit card pockets."
5.0,Just as described.  I've had it in for over a month straight and no tarnishing or discoloration of the jewelry or my skin.
5.0,Fits my daughter really well. Average 6 year old - she is 43 lbs. Not too loose or too tight. She picked the suit herself and loves the colors. She wears it to swim practice and it doesn’t rub or cause any discomfort. Might get another!

5.0,Beautiful and fit perfectly!!
5.0,"The sweater is so comfortable. It is over sized. It came vacuum sealed in a baggie, I put the sweater on immediately and felt that it became more over sized with wear. I want this sweater in every color now!"
5.0,"Very comfortable.  Fits well.  Can easily be dressed, up with nice sweater"
5.0,I bought them to wear under my scrubs. It’s great at moisture wicking and I don’t feel like I’m going to suffocate when I get too hot.

5.0,I got these for my daughter and she says that they are comparable to her Lululemons.

5.0,They were absolutely what I expected! I’m giving them away as gifts for by business and they are perfect! Would definitely recommend!
5.0,"I love this bag. Obviously it’s small, but you can fit a lot more stuff in it that I thought I’d be able to when I ordered it. It is pretty stiff but that’s kinda what I was looking for. The only annoying thing was that the strap came folded up and it’s a little creased. I feel like after I’ve used it a little more the folded parts with straighten out. Overall, I really like it and I’m happy with it."
5.0,"It did not slide down or anything uncomfortable a strapless top would do.  it's easy to put on and wear!  I'm 5'3"", 125 lbs.. I got a Small.  True to size!  The colors and patterns are neat, the fabric is soft and wearable.  I'm happy with this purchase."
5.0,"Love my gym bag!  This thing is pretty big --holds my iPad in (yes I read on my iPad on the elliptical) while still leaving room for a water bottle, towel, hair stuff, etc.  My personal favorite part of this bag is the cushioned straps --saves my shoulders every single gym trip.  I definitely recommend this product."

5.0,"Brilliantly yellow!  I felt like a ray of sunshine. The details on the sleeves are even more beautiful in person. The material is thin, so I would advise wearing a camisole so your bra does not show."
5.0,My Husband love it very much.  He thought it was more suited for going out than to wear to work.  He was very pleased with the quality and it fits quite comfortable.
5.0,Loveeeeeeee

5.0,I gave these out as gifts and kept one for myself. Might buy more in the future. Beautiful bracelets (or anklets).
5.0,I use these tops in addition to others under my scrubs for work and I find them very comfortable and flattering. What you see is what you get! And the sizing is accurate! I’ve washed them multiple times and the quality remains the same. I would say they’re not really going to keep you warm like a thermal but they’ll get the job done.
5.0,Unique charm. I love it. Great seller. Arrived much earlier than expected.
5.0,"The spacing/placement of the colors in relation to each other is artfully done, and makes this pin an elegant little accessory.<br />Everything is beautiful about this piece."

5.0,Its thick sweat shirt and well knit. I really like that I can wear indoors which doesn’t make me feel hot at all and outdoors. During windy California weather it still kept me warm . I highly recommend good and I bought two colors. Also it doesn’t stain other clothes so good product overall.
5.0,I've gotten many compliments on this hat. It does well for my original intended purpose of keeping the rain off my glasses as well as looking nice. It is the only hat I wear willingly. It fits my head just fine
5.0,Wonderful<br />-Cara

5.0,Bought for my mom. Also bought the Aurora and she prefered this one. It was super flattering and the skirt covered what she wanted covered. The color was nice. She said it really sucks you in. If you have a hard time getting in and out of clothes then this isnt it
5.0,"1-12 inch belt is stiff, but will break in and last decades!"
5.0,"Wonderful material and excellent made. The jacket is think good for those colder nights. But not a heavy or bulky jacket at all.  The buttons are well sew in, and the snaps. a great jacket overall. And the color such a rich dark navy color. such a great deal for the price. Fits true to it's size."
5.0,Looks good around the waist or as bracelets
5.0,"Overall good product, comes with a cute clear bag, easy to storage."

5.0,beautiful  perfect gift for preteen w/ broken arm  she loved it
5.0,It was beautiful and sparkly. Looked amazing on my baby for her first birthday.
5.0,I was replacing a set.  These are perfect!
5.0,It does what it says it does and if you turn it around you could defend yourself with it :)
5.0,I was looking for a light handbag that could fit my laptop and also looked nice. The color is great and it has the perfect size. It has an adjustable strap for over the shoulder carrying which is convenient. Good value of the price.
5.0,Super comfortable and fits really nice!
5.0,"I accidentally ordered the wrong size but OH MY GOSH I freaking love this jacket! It’s not thin or flimsy, it’s thick but still lightweight. It’s such good quality and I’m super impressed. I can’t wait I’ll the right sized one comes!!!"
5.0,"I purchased two of these bow ties for the ring bearers in my wedding. It was way cheaper to buy these than to rent some. These ties are a nice, quality satin, and look much more expensive than they are. I was very pleased when these arrived. I think that they look even nicer than pictured, and I did not expect such a quality product. YAY for happy surprises."
5.0,This is seriously the cutest ring holder ever!!! It's also well-made and quite heavy.
5.0,"My son absolutely loves this bracelet. He's 13, and very much into dragons. He has a few silver dragon necklace pendants, and wears them all the time, so this bracelet matches the pendant he wears and he has already gotten a lot of compliments on it. It's very &#34;manly&#34; and doesn't look out of place at all on his arm. I'm sure women could wear it too, but to me it looks much more of a masculine piece of jewelry. That is why my son likes it so much, because it makes him feel stronger and more confident as a young man. He is, of course, searching for his identity at his age, so whenever we find stuff that makes him feel confident and handsome, we have a winner. I am very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />I received a nice discount on this bracelet in exchange for my unbiased review, and am very happy with both the price and the quality. It stays on his arm very well, despite my misgivings about the clasp. It's just a T-bone clasp but it remains on his wrist very well, even when he is playing basketball! I couldn't be happier with this piece, the face is very well-rendered and the dragon looks regal and pleasantly menacing. We both love it, and I would totally recommend it to others!"
5.0,I absolutely love the comfort and style. Easy to exchange out and great value for the money.
5.0,"Exceptionally cool, exceptionally good quality. If you order your usual size, you will receive a slightly oversize sweater, which is what I wanted. If you want a sweater-dress size, order several sizes up. It is double-woven, which makes it very thick, very warm, and less likely to loose its shape over time. It is my new favorite sweater when the weather gets cold enough. This is a very good value for such a good quality sweater."
5.0,Super cute and comfy. My hubby hates them but I love them.
5.0,Beautiful earrings and received them quickly.

5.0,Work great fit good
5.0,It’s lightweight and very comfortable.

5.0,My 5 year old Granddaughter loves her boots.
5.0,"I bought this hoodie because it's Fall and I needed something quick to throw on for lazy days. The material is soft and the inside is softer,  it's something you just wanna curl up in and take a nap while drinking some Chai tea and watching netflix, really try it some time. I'm 5' exactly and the sleeves go over my hands but that's exactly the way I wanted them. Also the Maroon color is darker than pictured (thank goodness) it's a true Maroon color and not pinkish like pictured. Love it!"
5.0,"Let me just say this, there’s nothing to dislike about it. Very chique (elegant in French)."
5.0,"Very pleased with the fact that I can make a pin into a pendant. My only negative comment concerning this is that the pin tends to flip because it’s loose, hanging from the converter. Maybe a thin rubber tube inside the converter tube (similar to earring post backs) to snug up the pin would help. I hope the manufacturer reads this and designs it a little better. Then it will be perfect!!"
5.0,Order this a couple years back and wore it all the time became one of my favorites. Unfortunately my puppy chewed it up and I was so upset. I kept wishing I still had it so I ordered it again and I’m so happy I did! Definitely a must have !!
5.0,Great quality. My husband loves it.<br /><br />Update!<br />I'm now here trying to purchase a new one because it's such great quality. I hope you restock soon.
5.0,Comfortable and airy. I enjoyed this shirt and can’t wait to purchase more.
5.0,Beautiful bag! Love it!
5.0,This is a practical dress that you can wear as is or add a jacket and belt or scarf to dress it up. I bought this in 3 colors. Its a great staple for any closet. The material is substantial and the colors are vibrant
5.0,"Super cute! I’m usually a 36 DD and a 6 in pants, and a medium fit fine. It could’ve been a little bit bigger in the chest area but I think the bottoms would’ve been too big. Overall it fits comfortably, and it even held up at a Water park!"
5.0,"so far I love the styles, I will update with more pics once I try then on.<br />***** UPDATE *****<br />First pair I tried on today, feels great and warm for my cold office, matches perfect with my scrubs outfit, I can't wait to try the others."
5.0,These worked very well for our stretching and I loved the color! The material made it very easy to stretch without pain and I really enjoyed the rubbers and little etch keeping them in place! I did have them come loose once or twice but I honestly wasn't too careful so I can't blame the product.
5.0,The dress was great the zipper malfunctioned but got a replacement sent to me super fast. It is absolutely beautiful. Can not wait to wear it.
5.0,Comfortable and there no extreme tightness
5.0,It fits great. I love it. Keeps me warm. I get lots of compliments.

5.0,", I have plantar fasciitis in the sandals are great"
5.0,Look stylish.  My headaches from constant computer use are gone.
5.0,It was good. It did fix my husband nightmare. He dont have to worry about my long hair touching his face while we are cuddling or sleeping.
5.0,Bought two pairs as gifts. The earrings are so adorable and we’re well received.
5.0,Love my new off set umbrella.  I chose red as black would draw the sun and white would get dirty with all the trees outlining  my yard. It does have to be weighted  down or screwed into your deck. I use sand bags as I constantly move things around. I have a 16x12 pool deck and shades most of it.
5.0,Perfect! Love ~ love ~ love!
5.0,This cloth makes it easy to clean your silver jewelry.  Great value.
5.0,"Slim and sleek!!! This wallet removes the bulkiness of a bi or tri fold wallet and provides a modern sleek feel to the wallet. With enough space to add cards and the best part is the see thru space where you can put you ID or license, no flipping or opening a bulky wallet to show your ID. It also has a middle pouch for cash or receipts. Recommend to the one who uses cards all the time."
5.0,What a beautiful necklace...looks great and is well made.
5.0,"Love these! Size, lenses shade, fit - all great."
5.0,Happy Customer! 🤘
5.0,"Great quality. Great material! I am 5'2"" and 146lbs and bought a medium and it fits great. Perfect for summer wear and religious meetings too as it is modest, pretty and summery."
5.0,cool fascinating! I will buy it forever lol.... also super cheap
5.0,I wore this unit with shorts because I was at a work event. It is also fitting me differently because I had my other arm in the shoulder key hole :). Worth the buy.
5.0,"Works great, needed a product like this for a long time!"
5.0,"My son has been wearing hockey pants like these for at least the past 8-9 years.  His favorites used to be the Shock Doctor ones but they recently changed the design and he doesn't like it as much.  We tried Bauer, Under Armour and the Perani's brand before finding these.  These are by FAR my son's favorites.  They fit more like the old Shock Doctor's did.<br /><br />The Under Armour ones, he says are too loose and not as strong of a material (they are super light, if you are looking for that.)  The Bauer ones, have the leg hole straps for the jock and my son finds these uncomfortable.  (Bauer's are also the most expensive by far, so I wasn't sad he didn't like these.)  And the Perani's brand isn't as high of quality.  We didn't try the Warrior ones because the reviews say the Velcro pokes and catches on everything, so wasn't worth trying."
5.0,"Nice light weight material for the summer. I should have gotten a 30"" inseam instead of 32."
5.0,"As a 32DDD, buying bras in general is incredibly difficult. Sports bras are impossible because the band and cups never both fit. I put on this bra and felt like I lost 20lbs instantly. For the first time in 10 years, the band lay flat against my ribcage, and the girls were properly positioned. My clothes fit properly over this bra, and I can actually see my figure again. The adjustable band is life-changing. The large easily cinched small enough for my 32"" ribcage, with tons of room to make it tighter if needed. I may have been able to size up to xl for more coverage, but the large cups fit pretty well, and the adjustable straps ensure proper positioning.<br />My only con is the price of this bra. Even at half price, I had a hard time justifying this purchase. There's just no way I can pay $75 for a bra, so I will continue to keep an eye out for another deal. I would love to be able to afford one of these for every day of the week. It's a shame that it costs so much for a bra that actually works. It would be so incredibly nice if there were a $25-$30ish version of this bra so that everyone could feel this comfortable and confident every day, especially those of us who need a small band and large cup and have no other well-fitting options."
5.0,Is my baby color it fit perfect I just love the soup
5.0,Super soft and comfortable! I wish I would’ve gotten more!
5.0,Es tan practico que es mi 5to regalo

5.0,"Love these quality gloves, feels so silky on. Warm and well made"
5.0,"Make sure you check the sizing on these, my husband is a size 34 and we ordered him an XL.  The sizing is not true American sizing so normally he would wear a medium, so my advice is to go 2 sizes up to get the proper fit.  The color and quality of the material is great.  He loved the pattern too."
5.0,I feel like a movie star in this thing.
5.0,The fabric is so soft and I didn’t get overheated wearing it
5.0,"Love these shoes, my baby likes it too. No smelly feet and he reaches for it whenever he wants to go out which I interpret as it being very comfortable. I have owned many momo baby shoes and really like this brand."
5.0,"Really love this flowing top and it has a standard back, which I wanted. I plan to order more of these tops as I like the fit and the material.<br />Update, I ordered the blue and it's awesome and I may order more. Love the soft drape of the material"
5.0,"Bought this for my mom who is a huge Elvis fan!  And she absolutely loves it! It also was delivered earlier than 7days parcel mail arrives, especially to Guam! Thanks!"
5.0,Fun For Kids
5.0,It's a nice wallet but I needed one that would hold my phone as well.  I returned because I ordered the wrong one
5.0,"So I was worried these wouldn't fit me, I'm slighty over weight at 160 pounds and being 5'3.&#34; I bought the grey pants. But they fit perfectly. I'm going to be ordering these again. You can wear these pants as high on the waist or as low on the hips as you want. Can't wait to wear these to yoga!"
5.0,"Was a present for a Harry Potter fan,she loved it.It needs to be tied,it isn't one of those children's ties that are already tied and you just put it on.fyi."

5.0,"Loved it, fits very well. I’m 180 pre pregnancy abs I have plenty of room for my belly to expand as well as extra length on the bottom for the same thing."
5.0,"A near-perfect Align dupe for like 70% off retail. I’d say the softness is the same, but these are just a slight bit more compressive. Like a mix between the Align and Wunder Under. Don’t hesitate...jump on these!! I wear a 6-8 at Lulu, and chose a medium in these. They’re awesome!"
5.0,"It’s a comfortable fit. The size is small. It hugs my body so it makes me warm on cold snow 30 degree days in The Pacific Northwest. I can wear a turtleneck cotton shirt under  neath , so I am comfortable all day long."
5.0,Beautiful dress. I will be wearing it to church. It fits perfectly. Worth buying especially when white dresses with a full length slip are hard to find.
5.0,"I was looking for a cotton top for a while, and was happy to find this shirt, which is 95% cotton.  The fabric is very comfy, breathable, and soft.  This looks great with jeans, or with a cute skirt tucked in.  Great choice for everyday wear.  It runs a bit small.  I often wear an XS, however the Dorose top in size small fits just right.  I guess, if you like wearing tight clothing, then go with your regular size, if you prefer a slightly loose fit, go up a size"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:70e2e83156778d0a55fa438e3e64b68b]] Me encanto
5.0,Love that these are longer and don't end up exposing your belly. Nice weight fabric. Works great under layers or just as is.
5.0,These are so fun. I've given these away as party favors as well as just having them for my daughter and her cousins when they come over and it starts to get dark. They love running around either in the house or outside. So worth it and I will continue to buy them. Plus they're so inexpensive
5.0,"I definitely needed this tool as have some charms here that were very difficult for me to put together, but once the product arrived and I found out how to use it, the charms are all assembled in the right order in the bracelet.  Will definitely come back and either get another charm tool if needed.  I had gone for several months of frustration trying to get the charms assembled with no luck, so it was a wonderful find for me!"
5.0,very sturdy and secure.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:24723d4aab5aa6ea45d3a3a93b76114b]] Super cute 😍 I ordered 3. Not stamped but great value for the price!
5.0,My Grandson loves them!!!!
5.0,AWESOME Rock-a-Billy bowling shirt and for a Very reasonable price
5.0,"Great beanie.<br /><br />I wear glasses so the soft bill is a plus.<br /><br />I've got a MASSIVE head and most beanies fit tight, and I typically can't wear one size fits all hats. the large size of the winter jeep beanies is truly massive and is pretty loose even on my giant dome."
5.0,I love this dress. Can't wait to wear it to a wedding in June.
5.0,Beautiful earrings. So dainty and perfect turquoise shade to match my bracelet.

5.0,There is no glare I can see clearly.
5.0,The products looks great
5.0,Best EVER. Super soft and look so nice
5.0,I ordered 3 of these skirts as I love the firs one! It's perfect for summer and spring. I especially like how flattening they look on me. The green one is the cutest as I can wear it to office and also parties. The only complain is that the band at the waist got twisted. You know what I meant? I wish the waist band would be better. But it sill is worth the money despite the poor quality waist band. I wouldn't mind paying a bit more if the improved the quality.
5.0,"I wanted warm pants for my owl and a nice appearance for me. These pants deliver. Not sure that the word ""fleece"" in the product description is accurate, but these pants are thick and warm. They cling to my owl and look nice too."
5.0,Going to be part of a Christmas gift.
5.0,"Love it! So adorable for the beach. The material is a little thin, but it’s a swimsuit cover up so I would expect it to be thin. Nice fabric true to size, and so pretty.  Lightweight, and gives you a great shape. Got lots of compliments."
5.0,Great quality for the price...there are higher end brands priced way more that are inferior to this 3 pack. You get 3 for less than the price of one with the other brands.
5.0,"I love the fit of this shirt.  I am 5 ' 8"" and 143 lbs. I ordered a M and it fits great!  I love the cap sleeves and the body is a good length.  The fabric is soft and the patterns is cute."
5.0,Works well on men's pants with smaller belt loops.
5.0,Very light. Matches space gray very well
5.0,"I ordered the black and gold glasses. The picture of the product looked like the sides were yellow, but in fact were a more metallic gold. Not good or bad to me - just different than I expected. I still love them and happy to have another pair of Goodr sunglassess! I run with one pair. This pair will be for golf. Great value for the money. You won't be disappointed."
5.0,Perfect for all occasions!
5.0,"It ran a little small for me, but lucky it fits my daughter perfect. She’s been wearing every day.<br />The quality is thin and the hood is thick. Not a winter jacket but perfect for the fall. So cute!!"
5.0,Birthday gift for my mother-in-law to match her bracelet that she bought herself for mother's day.
5.0,These are so soft and fluffy!  They fit well with some room to spare!  I really like these for my kiddos!  With all that’s going on in the world today we have taken a huge financial loss and are struggling like many in this country. We can’t keep the heat up like we used to and these bathrobes are making life a little better.  They are not super thick but still I think they are just right.  We have washed and dried them once already and there were no issues found so far.  I do like these and I am glad I purchased one for each of my boys!
5.0,Love this shirt! It’s soft and fits just right.
5.0,"Perfectos, se ven muy lindos puestos"
5.0,It was a gift for my cousin and he likes it

5.0,Good necklace my daughter got it for her and her bff. Got here fairly faster than expected.
5.0,Love it fits great but the bottoms I feel aren't that stretchy and I do got a big bottom but they still fit good ! As for the top I love it I wear a 36DD so I can never find a top that fits me but this fit really well I like this bikini a lot and I would buy this again !
5.0,"This dress is the FIRST dress I have felt comfortable in in a long time. I am so excited about this, and ordered more! I sized normally and it was super flattering."
5.0,Fits my little walker perfectly
5.0,Absolutely love the Secrid wallets. Perfect for a minimalist.
5.0,Beautiful neckpiece! Pretty and simple - looks more expensive than what it cost. Love it!
5.0,The fabric feels amazing. I love the coverage it provided my stomach as that is far from my favorite part of myself. Order a size up; I couldn't wear the underwear comfortably because they were a little smaller. I'd definitely recommend this lingerie because it's such a great value!
5.0,"my God ,I was about to give up on buying clothes on Amazon ,for the china sizes being too small.and I don't have time to return items at all the time ,but thank God I found this piece of cloth the fit me perfectly . I love it'"
5.0,This dress is so beautiful! Lots of compliments.
5.0,They are truly polarized and I have received many compliments while wearing them! They do not hurt while wearing and I've worn them 13 hours straight.
5.0,Hubby is a mail carrier and is out in the elements all day. I ordered this because of the SPF factor. He likes it a lot and it had held up very well in the wash. Will be ordering more for him to use along with his uniform.

5.0,"Very stylish, plenty of room."
5.0,I LOVE it!  It flows beautifully and the fit was just right!

5.0,Gorj and not too long or too short.
5.0,Fits well. Good material. Let's see how long it's last.
5.0,These are a good quality classes at a good price.  I can tell the lenses are tinted amber when I look at my computer screen.  It is comforting and not distracting.  I purchased the same strength as my readers and the are just right.
5.0,Love these. Light and pretty. Have become a wardrobe staple.
5.0,Exelent for me
5.0,Soft leather upper.  Excellent!
5.0,"I know what you're thinking: why pay $40 for a bag to put inside your bag. All I can say is that it's well worth it if you travel light and frequently. My daughter didn't want TSA rifling through her unmentionables so she used these for packing. Her boarding bag is [[ASIN:B01MCV8OLR Aimee Kestenberg Florence Collection 4-Wheel Under-Seat / Carry-On (Plum)]] and it fit 1 slim & 3 small (or 2 slim & 1 small). Her carry on is [[ASIN:B01AAFMZ98 Mia Toro Hardside Spinner Carry-On, Hamasa]] and fit this set *plus* [[ASIN:B01BEEQ7TS eBags Ultralight Packing Cubes - Ultimate Packer 7pc Set (OrangeYellow)]] with room for her toiletries and makeup bags. If you know how to throw together a modular wardrobe and can do laundry, this combination can carry a month's worth of clothes and you'll never be photographed wearing the same thing twice, all while never having to check a bag!<br /><br />When her bags got inspected, the mesh top showed what was in there, so no further inspection needed. These packing cubes are super light and seem flimsy but the wired frame can really hold your items into a shape to make modular packing easier. If you've ever been tent camping with a hardcore backpacker, the tiny tents are made out of the same Condura nylon, so these cubes are durable."
5.0,"Very thin material, I wear a pair of tights underneath."
5.0,"My daughter hates wearing hats at the pool, but this design without a string is fantastic. It snugly fits her head and she loves it. It blocks sun from her neck and face!"
5.0,Have used them about 4 times on full day rides on my snow bike. So far they have worked well at keeping my feet warm and keeping my feet dry. Very well made.

5.0,Great bag for a day at the lake or beach!
5.0,Super soft and fits exactly as it’s sized. I love it!

5.0,It was bigger than I expected but not too heavy! It's beautiful and decorative. I received many complements when I wore it.

5.0,I got this as a gift for my sister and she loves it!
5.0,I made some big mistakes when installing new can lights in my family room.  These rings covered the blemishes around the Halo cans I installed.  They also allowed me to use 2 existing cans that were 7&#34; and the old rings did not match.  Now you can't tell the difference between the old installations and the new.
5.0,"Super soft, very stretchy. A little long but I'm short so it's always expected. Love these and would definitely order again!"

5.0,"Fit great, super comfy"
5.0,"I purchased this watch for my 10 year old to help with virtual learning due to the pandemic. She needed a watch with 5 alarms to help remind her when she needs to log into her classroom Zoom calls. I've read multiple reviews about this watch being hard to set up, which had me a little hesitant to purchase. The instructions are VERY clear and I had no issues at all setting the time, date and alarms. I even like that it has a lock function so she doesn't accidentally change anything. So far so good and I would definitely recommend purchasing for however this watch fits your lifestyle."

5.0,These were perfect for my 60's flower child costume. Arrived just in time for the party with no scratches and in terrific shape.
5.0,Used these for our wedding - yes you hear me our wedding.  I was completely against it but my wife loved Gold and these Gold Ties were good.  Even though they were very different color than what was actually shipped.  But it served its purpose.
5.0,"I bought these for my daughter for Homecoming, it’s her birthstone color. They are STUNNING!"
5.0,Always unsure of how soft shirts are but these were super soft. They wash very well and the images don’t fade and aren’t cheaply made at all. They are also longer which is a plus with a taller little one.
5.0,"Great pants!  Feel great, look great!  Not a fan of the front pockets."

5.0,This is beautiful. I purchased and direct shipped it as a present for my mom. She loves it. Very stylish and way to expensive she said &#34; especially since everything that was in my old purse didn't fit. I even had extra room in my old purse.&#34; So I reminded her it was a luxury purse not a backpack !!  Lol. I am still glad I got it but will look for a larger one  as well. We can never have to many bags! Plus the bigger the bag the more we cram in it !
5.0,It will make a wonderful Christmas gift
5.0,Nice and toasty!
5.0,"The product is as I expected from the specs & reviews. It can be used in several ways, with or without the shoulder strap."
5.0,"These camis are soft, stretchy, and very comfortable.  They also have a high enough neckline that you don't have to worry about your bra sticking out.  Beautiful lace details as well.  If you buy the red one, wash it separately the first time as it will bleed and stain other clothing."
5.0,Purchased as a Christmas gift.  Should have bought a pair for myself as well. Soft leather
5.0,Arrived earlier than expected. Fits perfectly and looks just like the picture. So many clothing items don't. Very pleased

5.0,I’ve tried it on one pair of shoes and it does appear to help stretch the leather.
5.0,This dress is amazing! Super cute and made as depicted by the photos. Great thicker material that flatters. Plus that it has pockets as well. So glad I didn’t pass this one up as it’s definitely going in regular rotation for my wardrobe.
5.0,"Great quality, warm and stylish"
5.0,Im 77 so I appreciate pants that keep me warm.  I wear these all summer.  My trips outside are short and of minimal duration and these do just fine even into the 80s.  Lighter and more flexible than my pairs of lined jeans.  Immediately bought a 2nd pair.
5.0,Well made. Looks like the one the TV character wears

5.0,This rabbit charm is perfect.  My daughter loves it on her classic charm bracelet.  It is a solid 3D charm.
5.0,"Right off, I liked the case that the goggles came packaged in, which protects them from being banged around, scratched, etc. It speaks to quality and care taken by the seller.  The goggles are very light weight, but well-constructed.  The head-band is easy to adjust and stays right where you put it.  The view and fit of the goggles are very nice, forming a good, yet comfortable seal to keep out the water.<br />I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend these goggles to anyone looking."
5.0,I bought this keychain for my daughters bus driver as an end of the year gift. It is very cute and her bus driver loved it! It is a simple way to show your appreciation for getting your child to school all year long.

5.0,I have a collection of Patricia Nash handbags and this is definitely my favorite!
5.0,"The ""official"" Zappa mustache logo always bothered me, the imperial is so wide it seems like a lower lip. I like this design a lot better, more like early Zappa. The hat's good quality, too, I like the fact that there's a buckle rather than velcro."
5.0,"I love lounging in these pants! I have the gray ones, which I noticed are the ones with a cotton blend. I've seen other reviews complaining that the pants are slick & not as soft as they had imagined. If you are looking for soft, try the gray ones. Plus, pockets!"

5.0,Right amount of detail without going over the top. Bought other colors. Recommended.
5.0,"This was listed as wine red and I was afraid it would be too wine-y but it's a gorgeous deep red as opposed to an orang-y red. I consider wine red to be more burgundy which is not what I wanted--I wanted RED. This is for my DH for a Christmas formal occasion and it is perfect. Lovely brocade, seems well made."
5.0,"I am very pleased with these socks.  They are jazzy and are comfortable, and I am  especially happy with being able to pull them on easily.<br /><br />They provide soothing comfort to my legs."
5.0,"This shirt fits well on my 8 year old son. He LOVES this shirt, but most importantly, he loves the game Among Us! True story."

5.0,"Very well made,  heavy gauge material and close stitching.  Love the size."
5.0,This is my all time favorite hat. I own 3 in different colors. I love that it is warm but also light weight. It fits my small head without slipping off. I plan to buy more colors because I am afraid they will stop making this style some day and then what will I do? It is my emotional support hat. It is part of me. When summertime rolls around and I have to put it away for the season I am sad.
5.0,The diaper bag was a gift to expected parents. They loved it has a charger and so many pockets.

5.0,I love it. Can’t wait to wear it to Disney
5.0,These earring are beautiful! The hook goes through the ear smoothly and the snaps into the hook securely. There big enough to enhance your face but not overwhelming. There is a lot of detail work in the earring. The earrings also sparkle so they're will be notice. I happy with this product and would definitely recommend buying them again.
5.0,It's hard to find arm and head bands for little kids.  They are well made and in fun colors.  My 3 and 5 year old grandsons who enjoy sports were really excited to get these so they can be like the big guy athletes.

5.0,"Please measure your child and read the size guides to get the exact fit.  Buy yourself a tape measure and you won't get it wrong.  The material is soft and thick so that it is modest, which I appreciate for my daughter."
5.0,"This is a good camping and hiking shirt that dries quickly and is very lightweight. I am 5'4"" and a size 10. Large was fine. I ordered another one in XL just because I happen to like room in my shirts when walking and working out."
5.0,It looks and feels great. With the original band I always had sweat under it while out here in the Florida sun but not with thos band. Ot let's your wrist breathe. Perfect!

The glasses come with carrying case/glass cleaner, which is handy.<br /><br />I also ordered the same style in black, not knowing that they would be shipped from two different companies. These are way better than the other ones"
5.0,"These tights are good. If you are looking for quality tights for a quality price, look no further."
5.0,"I love my coat and it fits perfectly. While I had a wool coat, southern NV just didn't require a coat that often nor did it have to be very heavy. Upon moving to NE, I knew right away I'd need a warmer one. The difference was like night and day. It is so comfortably warm."
5.0,Nice and simple came in quick love it
5.0,Most hardside luggage with zippers can be opened with out belts than lock. Checkout youtube videos on luggage.
5.0,I got this dress to go under a wrap dress that is too short when I sit down. This fit perfectly and the length is very modest. I am 5'3 and 142 lbs I got this in a medium and it covers my knees.

5.0,Love it<br />Great for all outfits<br />Thank you
5.0,Cute shirt - fun motivation for my workouts!
5.0,Love this necklace. Very sturdy and very pretty
5.0,"I have several pairs of leggings, but these easily became my favorite after wearing them. The fit is perfect. The fabric is breathable and comfortable. The netted/mesh area just makes these leggings. These are cute and functional. The added colorful pattern makes it even cuter. These are great because they aren’t see through while stretching or squatting. The only see through areas are the meshy areas. These leggings are great for working out or just going about your day."
5.0,Bought this for a co worker and it's quality is vary good . the product is as described. these would sell at macy's for $60.00
5.0,I like the style but you have to iron the ruffled  hem which was ok but this dress fit me like a glove showing all my curves I felt gorgeous in this dress going to order it in another color that's just how much I liked this dress
5.0,So much detail
5.0,These are the absolute bomb.  I started with a large and went to a medium.  The compression works beautifully so no bra is needed.  Very flattering and easy to wear.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:e27f64615302e4401b53ff6a961086cc]] Material is a little strange and stiff but it’s absolutely beautiful and if you have the rose gold case it’s matches perfectly
5.0,"Beautiful watch.. I get lots of compliments . The watch is big and the band is of great quality.  For the price, it's a great deal on an excellent timepiece"
5.0,"I normally am a Large or Extra Large. I am 5'11&#34; and 190. I ordered a 3XXX and it fit fine. Very cool design, and of course the price cannot be beat."

5.0,"So nice for the $, think I should order more."
5.0,"Ran a tiny bit smaller than I'm used to for an XL, but still fit and pretty nice shirt.  Arrived earlier that I thought it would."
5.0,"Perfect size, super slim, minimalistic but highly effective. It holds 9 cards for me. The elastic is secure; though as a career firefighter myself I am so broke that I doubt I'll ever be able to test its true capacity. Will continue to dream of purchasing more items from Recycled Firefighter. Thank you for your product brother."
5.0,They fit my daughter perfect and don’t fall off. She is a crazy sleeper but they are still on her feet in the morning.
5.0,Product is great quality and great customer service.
5.0,I got these for my teenager and she loves them! She states they are soft and very comfortable. She loved the 3 festive colors. The grips on the bottoms help as well for slip resistance especially since she love to run in the house without shoes on.

5.0,Great item!  Fast shipping!  A+++
5.0,Socks are very good quality. Yes I would recommend to a friend. Just might order another set.

5.0,does wonders for my jewelry.
5.0,"I was hesitant to order this because online it's difficult to know what the fabric is like.<br />For the price, awesome, really soft, and fits great. If you are looking for something that you plan on using, this is a great deal."
5.0,"Great bag add on for covers, extra jacket. It is very sturdy and fits well on cart"
5.0,Looks exactly like picture husband loved it for Xmas
5.0,"Soft, ribbed-sweater material. I’m 5’7 140 lbs and the small fits perfect."
5.0,"I work in healthcare and I'm on my feet all day. Finally decided to start wearing some compression hose . This works very well , they are lightly to moderately compressive so very comfortable while still giving support."
5.0,Perfect size for my 13lb dog
5.0,It was great I wasn't sure about it when I ordered it due to shirts at 5xlt normally costing me like 30+ dollars but I fit great
5.0,"My sister-in-law had this on her Christmas gift list. I purchased it and had it sent to her. On the Christmas morning zoom, she opened it and put it right on. She loves it! Thanks!"
5.0,"Super cute throw on dress , can even throw leggings under and a sweater over for winter."
5.0,Helped with my pregnancy swelling in the ankles.  They were very stiff at first but I could get them on by myself my whole 3rd trimester after a few washes got rid of the stiffness.
5.0,I LOVE these bras...I am very large chested and these fit and work amazing (just like the $70 sports bras). I wear these while training for and running half marathons (though sometimes I do wear two just for good measure) and they are amazing. No chaffing or moving whatsoever.
5.0,"I actually received these boots earlier than what Amazon indicated. Ladies, these boots are REALLY nice... You won't be disappointed."
5.0,Very nice earrings!  Not too big or small. I will enjoy wearing them.
5.0,Bought this for a gift and it's a very nice necklace. I like that the chain is adjustable in length. My only complaint would be that the box chain maybe too thick for the heart (it's really hard to slide around and adjust). But the pro is that the necklace is thick so you don't really have to worry about it breaking. Nice and shiny charm too!
5.0,I bought is three sizes up and it fit snug. It does look good on me though. I recommend measuring yourself and ordering bigger size.
5.0,"Great for work, dressy enough for the evening"
5.0,"Beautiful colors, hand to take it in on the top, im much smaller on the top than i am on the bottom, but it looks great."
5.0,It fit my daughter perfect fit a costume.
5.0,Love the kiss. This is just another way to enjoy the art work

5.0,Love it! Fits perfect and love that it  it’s a little longer in the back. Looks great with tall boots !
5.0,"What a great bag. Great value. Quality construction. Great customer service and shipping. The woven pattern is beyond basic, utilizing different sized “leather” threads and had a solid woven handle. *Note the picture - the handle is woven shut for strength and durability. The bag has a removable sturdy bottom board that’s wrapped in same material, and comes with a separate zipper pouch for the smaller items you want to keep organized.  Great size.  Great color.  Can’t say enough about how pleased I am with it."
5.0,What a beautiful ad fun item to wear!  I love the pattern and the colors. My friends love it as well
5.0,Love this shirt!!! Cute and simple
5.0,"My first review was completely inaccurate and as such I apologize to everyone who I might have accidentally misled. When I got it I truly believed the center piece was plastic. I was wrong! It is metal and quite frankly this is of the utmost quality. Because of the way I saw it I really believed it was plastic but after additional testing I realized how wrong I was. This product gets amazing compliments everywhere I go. It looks fabulous and adds quite a presentation of style to any outfit. Its made of the utmost quality and meets every standard I had. Again I apologize if my initial description was wrong. It was not my intent to mislead, but rather simply relay what I thought of truth at the time.<br /><br />Actually the weight of the metal and quality of it stands to testament just how great it is. Its not heavy at all and mine has gone through many nights of all night partying on Beale Street in Memphis. Dancing, sweating, drinking, straight out debauchery and its come through absolutely without a scratch."
5.0,One of my favorite skirts by far..and the suspenders add that pop of style
5.0,Perfect fit!!!!!!
5.0,Fun hats with a great variety. We used the hats for a year-end party. They were well received and made the meeting fun and festive. So much fun!
5.0,A perfect fit! Thanks
5.0,Really nice luv lsu greaux tigers
5.0,"These are very nice socks. However, I wear a size 12 shoe and these are way too small. I would guess that they won't fit the foot of anyone where their shoe size  is over 8-10."
5.0,Sexy and worked percectly
5.0,Purchased as a gift for my husband.  He loves them and sayst hey are so comfortable!
5.0,These are great!! So comfortable and don’t roll down! The little design is super cute :)
5.0,"Way better quality than i expected. The wife is a huge Totoro fan and i buy he a few items every holiday. I thought this was cute but didnt expect it to be used. Shine, the old was emptied (kate Spade) and totoro is toting the credit cards."
5.0,Very beautiful necklace I ordered for my sister she loved it
5.0,I like the device. For it to really work you got to follow what the direction says:<br /><br />LEAVE THE KEY TO UNLOCK AT HOME!
5.0,I'm happy with my ability to change into Hammer whenever I please!  But the pants and vest came wrinkled.  Still looked and felt great!
5.0,Fits my gf perfectly.. looks good on her. Smikes
5.0,They arrived on time. They work. I wanted metal frames because I need to adjust for my unequal ears. They were easy to adjust. I am satisfied.
5.0,These shorts feels soft and comfortable on me. I wear them to walk/jog in
5.0,I ordered a small and it fits very well. It is long on me as I am petite but I just fold it in at the bottom.
5.0,Nephew 18... approved!_
5.0,"I am so picky about watches.  I shopped almost every retail store, and found nothing.  I searched this watch on Amazon, since I like Coach, and found this to be a perfect watch.  I wear it to work, and have gotten many compliments.  It looks very classy and stylish.  Love it."
5.0,"Nice and light, well constructed."
5.0,"Fit was great, especially around my bust. Would definitely buy the other version of the dress since this one fit so well. Straps are adjustable incase you need it bigger or smaller around the top. I’m usually a size 14 and bought the xl."
5.0,Super fashionable and easy to wear.
5.0,Love it!  Looks really charming and it is easy to combine with any clothes
5.0,These got here almost immediately. I am planning on using them as napkin rings for Halloween. Can't wait!
5.0,My husband loves these.  He says they fit the best and are very comfortable.  As a semi truck driver - he is always looking for a brand that doesn't bunch up or pinch and this one fits the bill.  Purchased him a medium - he wears a 31&#34; waist normally.
5.0,Pros: Nice thick material. Kept me warm all winter. Good draw sting on the waist.
5.0,"This top is gorgeous! And on top of that it was the perfect fit. I bought a size small but I usually fit in petites or junior clothing because of how small I am, so I wasn't expecting it to fit so well. Also the top looked so stunning. Aside from the item being a little pricey at $23.99, this top definitely exceeded my expectations!"
5.0,"This belt is well built.  My waste size is a little over 31 and I ordered a belt size small.  There are still 2 more sets of holes that can be utilized.  I will be buying another color.  Other people have said that some of the rivets fell off, but you can get rivets to replace with a little of knowledge.  Hasn't happened to me but will fix very easily if it does."
5.0,"Inspiring, playful, and cozy! A gift with pizzazz :) Highly recommended!"
5.0,"I'm salty about having to wear menswear at work, but luckily there are neon ties to give a bright light to my all black work costume. I get tons of compliments on it. Yaaaaaaaas"
5.0,"My favorite pair of now show socks! I've search long and hard for the perfect no show sock. I've tried dozens, these are by far the best!"
5.0,My fiance loves it. The shorts just fit a little funny.
5.0,Good fit and a perfect birthday gift! Clicked onto the watch and no problem falling off the watch either!
5.0,"Bright colors. Have not used dryer, but only hang dried. Bought for boyfriend's bday. Usually use a 3XLT but 4X fits well."
5.0,I love this shirt! Long enough to cover the bum. I wear it with leggings. It also has pockets which is a plus for me. The material is good
5.0,Super cute and comfortable. Was surprise the quality was so good for such a low price. Good buy!
5.0,"Could have bought medium, but it is so comforting!  Excellent quality, workmanship, finishing and feel like velvet!"
5.0,"I got this dress because it reminded me of the one I almost bought when I was in Hawaii. I checked out the size chart and went 2 sizes up from what I normally wear in a dress like this. Overall, I'm really happy with it. It looks exactly like the picture and is very well made - Solid stitching, no loose threads, and it fits nicely. I appreciate that the zipper on the side is practically invisible. The only thing is that I wish the fabric had some stretch, because I'm very busty, and some stretch would definitely help getting it on and off easier. Once it's on, it's really cute. Just takes a little effort to get there. I also noted that the arm holes are a bit tight. It's fine for me, but  if that's usually a concern area for you, you might want to skip this dress."
5.0,For my granddaughter. She had one just like it and it was very well worn and loved. I repaired that one and went looking for a replacement. She was over the moon I found one!
5.0,Good value.  Nice product
5.0,Super comfortable.  Fits well.  Lightweight with ko bunching where it counts.
5.0,Absolutely adore this.  It is VERY sheer and soft.......and feminine......and beautiful.  Even prettier than I expected.  Would order again if it came in colors. And the price?  Awesome!  I could hardly believe my eyes when it came.  At that price I was expecting something of lesser quality.  Happy customer here. :)
5.0,I love they way these snuggle my bottom!
5.0,"These Scarfs are basically being used for masks during this Virus caution time.  They are very easy to wear, they can be doubled and the stretch of the material makes it easy to stay in place.  The fabric is breathable, and also the fabric printed designs are great.  They are also very easy to wash & dry.  Since there were 9 masks, I shared with my sons, for which they also appreciated them.<br />After they are no longer required for masks, they can easily be worn as headbands.<br />Very glad I purchased them.<br />Cheers"
5.0,Thinker than I expected
5.0,very nice t-shirt
5.0,I love this necklace! I wear as an everyday necklace!!

5.0,My son loved this jersey and he wore it proudly to see Big Papi for one last time. Go Red Sox!<br /><br />Fits true to size and the material is a dream for warm weather.
5.0,"These came in a well packaged box. They do come in a clear plastic case which is good.<br /><br />These actually fit my glasses perfectly and the color is blue which is what I ordered.<br /><br />Came out of the case in perfect condition, no scratches, planning to take these when I go out. Great!<br /><br />Also have gotten many compliments on these. &#34;They look snazzy&#34; -Rachel"
5.0,"I love this dress! The yellow is perfect for summer and it seems well made. It does seem to run a bit big, I ordered a small and it’s pretty loose on me."
5.0,"Great wallet. Holds WAY more than 15 cards. I got 32 cards and the elastic band is still holding strong. One recommendation. DO NOT SIT DOWN WITH THE WALLET IN THE BACK POCKET. The carbon fiber plates WILL TEAR THRU YOUR PANTS. Other than that, the wallet skeleton is great."
5.0,Excellent product.  Fits perfectly and arrived on time at a very good price.
5.0,Looks beautiful! Seems like a high quality product.
5.0,I love these little cosmic charms. I've already made some earrings from a pair of the charms. I love the enameling. All of the charms are so pretty. Each one has a matching charm. Very happy with these charms.
5.0,"Bag is perfect size to store in hospital wardrobe for clothes that need to be laundered, not too small, but not huge and unwieldy."

5.0,"Muy bonita, buena calidad"
5.0,Easy to read large hands.Terrific price!
5.0,"Bought these polarized sunglasses and based on the reviews it seemed like people had negative experiences with it. However, when I bought it, it fit me perfectly and I feel like a K-Pop star.<br />When I drive, they protect my eyes, however when I'm using my phone I have to adjust my brightness level because the lenses protect my eyes from the glare so much that in order for me to see the screen, the brightness has to be pushed to the 75% level on an iPhone 6s. It's not a big deal but just a fair warning for those who are looking to buy these.<br />If mine break I would probably buy these again!"
5.0,Great fit and awesome price
5.0,Did you know goldfish were good luck?  So beautiful that pictures don't do it justice. Bought one for a gift and had to buy another for myself because I loved it so much.
5.0,Very classy pretty pink sunglasses comfortable fit study comes on a nice hard case really beautiful worth the value metal frame with protection around the ear the nose area fits so comfortable
5.0,Great item and a very good price. I will buy it again
5.0,I could not be happier!
5.0,Got it to go with a costume. The hat fits and looks of good quality. Will work nicely for our needs. I got it on time and in time for the first needed use. Thank you.
5.0,"I love this hat for my daughter. It stays on. It's machine washable/hang dry. Even though DH has put it through the dryer, it's still holding up after months of heavy use. I live on the equator and at a high altitude so sun protection is not optional, however slathering on sunscreen everyday, even for a short jaunt outside is not ideal. This hat is light weight and is easy to keep in my purse/diaper bag. And to top it all off, it's adorable and the white color complements any outfit my daughter is wearing. Furthermore, because it is white and plain, I am looking forward to getting g even more use out of this hat for my next child, regardless of gender. Bottomline: in conjunction  with other protective clothing, this hat is just perfect!"
5.0,It is beautiful and everyone notices when I wear it.  Wow it is so much fun to wear something that gets noticed by everyone.
5.0,"Very good service, early delivery, this was a replacement and works flawlessly, and is a stunning watch and very comfortable, I’ve gotten many compliments, excellent brand of watches"
5.0,My daughter loves this choker! It's pretty and well made...
5.0,My son fits in it perfectly. Good material
5.0,"Very nice, unique, modern.  Good quality so far (I just got it yesterday) it has not been washed yet.  I like the style.  I wear 12-14 and it fits me well with some room, not too tight.  I like it and will look into ordering different colors."
5.0,"Got to match my dress for some engagement pictures. Fit perfect, arrived just in time, and looks very classy. Something that will go with many outfits"
5.0,"Just as shown in the images.  The belt slides nicely into the buckle, and the trigger under the buckle is easy to work to release, just use one finger to pull the tab forward and the belt slides loose.  The best part is that unlike normal belts, this buckle does not damage the belt at all.  The &#34;steps&#34; on the center back side of the belt allow for fit adjustments of about 0.25&#34; so you can wear it just about any way you want.  I ordered it large and unclipped the belt from the buckle and cut off about 5&#34;.  It clips back into the buckle and has lots of room for adjustment.  If you do this make sure you still have plenty of &#34;steps&#34; on the belt before you cut."
5.0,Very wearable
5.0,These are soo cute on my baby girl!! I was surprised that I can actually match them to most outfits.
5.0,I brought this tie for my nephew for Christmas and he loved it.
5.0,Unique tank that is stylish and comfortable.
5.0,"One of my favorite dresses!! Fits as expected, absolutely beautifully made."
5.0,Bought this for the woman. I thought it was a good price. She really liked it. Started using it the day it arrived. Seems like it is good quality and made it through the first week of daily use! Will update if there are any issues.<br /><br />Comes with nice fabric bag to store it in too.
5.0,This dress is absolutely beautiful it is true to size and exactly as pictured I wasn't supposed to expect my dress until May 25th and I got it April 19th I will definitely do business with this seller again in the future
5.0,I always wear compressive socks in flight. Will keep your feet from freezing on intercontinental hauls.<br /><br />These are plenty comfortable. Sizing is important so make sure of your size. Fits as advertised.
5.0,Fit in my recycled k cups perfectly. Little to no mess for clean up. Definitely should have gotten the larger count order.
5.0,The fit was great it is so comfy and cushony.. Too bad they don't make work shoes with this material I hate to take them off when I go to work and have to put on my work shoes.
5.0,Very pretty... and nice fit
5.0,Stylish with good quality
5.0,Loved the fit and material although the material is a bit warm for summer evenings. It's perfect for fall or spring. Good quality material and I was happy with how it looked. 7
5.0,Pretty knit dress. Soft material. Hugs your curves. Looks great on.  Very comfortable.
5.0,I love this sweater. I have it in multiple colors!
5.0,I normally wear a M but ordered a L & fits great (I love just a tad big but not falling off big so this fits perfect!). SUPER soft & nice material! Shorts are not short shorts & have enough length so feel comfotable to wear around family when lounging around! Looks like normal day wear so feel comfy even to go outside in the yard in. Love this set!
5.0,Love the color and style. Can be worn with or without the belt. Ordering more colors - Love it!
5.0,"THESE ARE AMAZING!<br /><br />My 3yo boy was using a nighttime diaper as well as 1-2 soaker pads and was STILL waking up with a wet bed. I even tried putting a pull-up over the nighttime diaper but that didn't work either. I was doing SO MUCH LAUNDRY!<br /><br />A friend of mine suggested Peepeepants and I was honestly skeptical. I couldn't believe that they would actually work. The first night we tried them with just the overnight diaper (no extra pad and no pull up on top). The bed was dry in the morning! I wasn't convinced yet though. So we tried them again, and again, and again...WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY WET BED! It is awesome.<br /><br />Another thing to know about this product is the construction quality - these are REALLY well made. The price may be a little more than one would ideally want to pay, BUT, it is easy to see just by looking at the pants that you are getting what you pay for. For me the investment has been totally worth it in what I am saving in laundry soap and water and dryer time of washing pee-soaked sheets and blankets!<br /><br />In terms of comfort, the fabric is soft and smooth (no rough edges) and my son doesn't complain about wearing them at all. They fit just like shorts and he wears them comfortably under his pajamas. The waist closure has high-quality, well-sewn Velcro that is completely adjustable. My son is quite thin and small in the waist but these pants could easily fit a much larger 3YO as well.<br /><br />If you are considering this product I would highly recommend it. I was completely, pleasantly surprised! I even bought a second pair!"
5.0,"They arrived 13 days early than the expected delivery time. They're absolutely beautiful, much more colorful in person. They're true to size and stay in just fine throughout the day."

5.0,I love these hanky's so pretty
5.0,Excellent lunch bag.
5.0,I have been on the hunt for years for a no show sock that didn't slide down. I walk a lot in my job and had given up until I got a pair of these. 9 hour shift. Not one single readjustment needed. I need 10 more pairs!
5.0,It looks very nice on my son. The material feels very sturdy and the color is exactly as the picture.
5.0,This hat fits well. I even put it on my daughter somettimes because it fits her too

5.0,good glasses!~ using while biking; doesn't keep[ slipping down when I a working up a sweat.
5.0,"It's really shiny and gorgeous, and keeps time commensurate with what you'd expect of a Japanese time piece. I'd say Burei is a strong competitor with Orient."
5.0,Queda perfecto y pegado al cuerpo
5.0,Perfect fit and very soft/comfy without being bulky.  Love the variety of colors too!
5.0,Perfect dress for any summer event - wore it to a beach wedding and got tons of compliments! Can't beat the price for quality. It's wrinkle free too which is great.

5.0,Sexual af
5.0,I purchased this sock for my white tie and tails.  It was the perfect weight and texture.  Product was as advertised.  Fast delivery.  Fair price.  I would purchase again.
5.0,"I had originally ordered a size large in a green style that is similar to this style. When I got them they fit right but had too much extra room in the front crotch and was almost saggy. Seller was very helpful in giving me a better idea of what sizes run large or small etc. I did not see any reviews where anyone was my size, I am 195 and 5’2. And fluctuate between 180 and 195.  I usually need a large or xl but the medium in this style fits me perfectly. Not see through at all and very comfortable. I can’t wait to workout in these! Thank you!!"
5.0,"If you are a wearer of undershirts, but looking for a little bit more compression to make you look smother....this pack of 3 shirts is for you.  I ordered shirts in my usual size and they fit nicely; not too much compression, just holding &#34;things&#34; in a little nicer.  I have been very happy with these shirts - I hope any buyer will be happy too."
5.0,already ordered another pair :-)
5.0,"I gave this necklace as a gift. It was so cute and nice, I was proud to give it. I loved the little saying that came with it."
5.0,"Beautiful cross, very delicate but just what I was looking for."
5.0,"A great watch, looks nice and sleek and comes with most basic functions (time, date,day of the week, although this specific model is missing a stopwatch.) Included was a display box, the tool needed to adjust the strap length, and a gift bag."
5.0,Felt the effects immediately.<br /><br />Great fit 👌
5.0,"I waited a few months before reviewing to see how sturdy this bracelet is, I have to say I love it! I do have small wrists so it fits perfect. Until I got used to it, I'd bang my wrist and pop the lock open, but I got used to it pretty quickly. I think it's so pretty with any dress up or down outfit. Thank you so much!"
5.0,FLY
5.0,"These boots are so cute!  They look good with or without the accessories. My first pair of cowboy boots ever and I know I will wear them for years! They fit true to size, although maybe just a tiny bit narrow."
5.0,"This paracord bracelet is legit! Survival kit to catch fish, start a fire and try down a shelter you would make to stay alive. Very impressed with quality, design with all of the things hidden conveniently inside and price was exceptional, LOVE my friendly Swede!"
5.0,great light robe!
5.0,"What I Like About The Ring Is It's An Eye Catcher And It Goes Great With Whatever You're Wearing,"

5.0,Got them today and they fit perfect.
5.0,Great for my sons man cave.
5.0,I mean the garmet is great as described. What I want to know is how do I remove the security tag if I ordered it online.
5.0,"Arrived on time - good quality - fit great, face mask kinda tight (which is why not five star) over all great buy!<br /><br />Wore for first time today. Saved me from the heat. Am buying a second soon."

5.0,So stylish! Love them!
5.0,"I have a round head and struggle to find headbands that would stay on during a workout. While these are amazing and did a good job, I would have to fix them maybe twice a workout vs ten-fifteen times. Much improved!"
5.0,Nice for fancy occasions
5.0,Great gift for a girl.<br />My gf loved it n it wasnt bad of a price for a design like that.
5.0,"I didn't even know they made these things until I went on a guided kayak trip with some out of town guests.  The outfitters had these pogies on all their paddles.  I went right home from that trip and ordered these things for me and my husband.  When they came we went out and paddled as close as we dared to the face of a glacier.  Cold, cold wind and cold, cold water, but dry and warm hands.  Happiness!"
5.0,These socks were a gift for my grandson who loves monster trucks.  They were pricey but much nicer quality than most novelty socks.  Worth the extra money.
5.0,"Very forgiving shirt without being too boxy. Especially when you pair it with a tighter piece of clothing on the bottom. My most comfortable off shoulder shirt or dress. I don’t always like them because I find them to be confining, but not this one!"
5.0,Great price. Great colors and fit.
5.0,"Very pretty earrings, stylish. Also, got a gift from the seller :)"
5.0,"Coolest Wallet I own, and bought another for a friend, long lasting, well made, receive many compliments on it."
5.0,"I have finally got my lanai done, bought some furniture and put up the umbrella.  So I took apicture for you.  It works perfect in my space.  The lights work great with the solar power.  I couldn't be happier.  Thank You so much!"
5.0,Great design and a unique look. The only thing I would be careful about it make sure you wash it inside out due the the fading of the design on front of the shirt.
5.0,"Great. Very light weight & slim. I think the description said it’s made of alloy. I love it. And it was only $10, at boot barn these are wayyy more!"
5.0,These were so beautiful and perfect for her first birthday pictures
5.0,"I have a cream colored pair of these slippers that I like a lot, so much so that when I saw that they also come in grey, I knew that I ""needed"" a second pair.  Although the color is ""grey,"" it has a blue/purple tone to it that I think is quite lovely.  Just like my original pair, these are soft, plush and feel amazing on my feet!  It does not seem to specify in the listing, but they are made of faux suede and what I assume to be fake fur as well, so they are likely a good option for vegans or people who prioritize not using animal products.  The ""suede"" does not look bad, but it is obviously not real.  I love that the fur, on the other hand, actually looks and feels like it could be the real thing - it is just as soft and cozy as the inner lining of my Ugg boots, but does not make my feet overly warm or cause them to sweat, like some faux materials often can.  I also really like that they have a rubber sole, which does not make the slippers any less comfortable, but does add some structure, allows them to be used outside and makes them more durable!  Compared to my soft soled slippers, I think these will last significantly longer.<br /><br />I normally wear size 7.5-8 in most shoes, and these in a 7 fit perfectly.  They fit snug at first, but stretch to fit quickly, within a few minutes of the first time wearing them, so they do have some leeway in sizing.  A size 8 would probably be okay too, just slightly roomier.  My other pair did arrive with some loose threads (which were not a problem at all after I simply cut them off), but this pair had no issues at all with its construction.<br /><br />At the time of this review, no price has been added, so I cannot comment on their value, but I can say that recently, one of my favorite things to do when I got home was to take off my shoes and slip on my cream colored slippers, so now I am glad to have been able to add this pretty grey pair to the rotation!  So yes, I think these ""shoeslocker women's slippers"" are quite wonderful [in any color!] and I would recommend them.<br /><br />shoeslocker Women's Slippers Cozy Memory Foam Fuzzy Plush Lined House Shoes"
5.0,My wife is very happy with this product she’s thinking to get some more thank you
5.0,Fits great. Helps keep the cold away from the mouth. However strange smell that came with it. Went away after a good wash.
5.0,This charm looks very nice. I can't wait to add it to my bracelet.
5.0,I love this.  I treated myself with this for Christmas as I have always wanted one.  I love that it actually goes to the floor
5.0,Product is of high quality but I was  disappointed that this is so stiff that I couldn't have it sewn on my jersey.
5.0,Loved it! very flattering. hides and accentuates at the same time.
5.0,These are perfect for our 3 year old twins. The drawstrings are great for a snug fit!
5.0,Decent shirt...not much to say. Order up.
5.0,Super comfy and figure flattering
5.0,"This jacket is perfect for protecting from blowing rain in all climates.  All of the pockets are very handy.  The fit is spot on.  Per my wife, It looks very nice on.  The price is great.  Overall, this is a can’t miss purchase!"
5.0,Why have I waited so long. Love it. Comfy. Stylish. Would buy again
5.0,"I've been using reading glasses for a few years now but hadn't seen ""blue blockers"" before.  The glasses have a blueish coating on them just as pictured on the Amazon page.  When you're looking at something like a piece of white paper, instead of seeing the paper as white there is a slight yellow tint.<br /><br />They're light and comfortable to wear and come with a great travel case."
5.0,"I buy a lot of hair scarves, as I've been wrapping my hair to sleep for years. It's not necessary to have pure silk--a silky smooth feeling is what's important, so that your hair doesn't get tangled or abraded while you sleep. This scarf is thicker than most (but not all) scarves I've bought, so I expect it to last nearly a year of nightly use--and I'm not that gentle when I tie them. I have been using it for over a month and it's only slipped off once at night. (Thicker scarves last longer, but can be trickier to tie firmly without tying your hair in.)"
5.0,"These capris are awesome! They totally pass the squat test (butt is still fully covered when you do squats haha), and the material is comfortable and sturdy. Will definitely buy more in the future."
5.0,Belloooo me encanto muy lindo grasias
5.0,This is the second time my daughter bought this backpack. It’s really cute and the perfect size for a teen to travel with. Lots of pockets and it’s well made. We have the yellow and mint color. Great vibrant colors!
5.0,Fits great. Thummies are perfect.
5.0,Beautiful and useful
5.0,"shiny stones, fits very well, looks very handsome !!!"
5.0,"I love the product very much!! It is a good quality and well made. I am going to use it a lot in my pool this summer.<br />I also love the very professional and elegant packing, the elegant pink note that made me feel very special as a customer, thank you! It is very rare in these days to be receiving a good quality product, and to have a great customer service. I will order again another one, the multi colors one.<br /><br />Thank you!"
5.0,Grand daughter loves them! Everything we wanted!
5.0,This is a great hat
5.0,These pants are awesome.  Fit like top designer brand at a fraction of the price.  Will be ordering again.
5.0,Me gustaron mucho a muy buen precio Los recomiendo mucho
5.0,"I wish there were more of these available! Good, comfortable fit, cleavage coverage for a work base (for those with it), and the lace discretely covers nipples when used as a pajama top.  If I had known these Camisoles would disappear, I would have snarfed them up at Costco. :-)"
5.0,"I don't wear these but my hubby does.  So glad I got these for him.  He was so against switchin from what he always had gone to.  Now he gets to be comfortable and I get to see his sexy bum. No joke.  For gentlemen trying to show off features that undies cover these help.  Not that they are thin they are see through, they are not. Just they are sewn or shaped or whatever it is. It holds and shows off body well."
5.0,"I'm in love with this dress. It has pockets! It's super cute and really comfortable. I'm 5'5 and it reaches the top of my foot. I washed and dried, and the material did not shrink. I will buy more patterns"
5.0,Very stylish and works perfect!!! I'm ordering another pair.
5.0,Fir
5.0,Comfy and great lines for easy fitting wear for plane travel especially! Love the neckline and inclusion of pockets. Fabric weight is also nice. Very happy. Probably order another!
5.0,"Great Shirt.I love the color , fit and the moisture-wicking feature."
5.0,"I love this shoe. So casual, yet dressy with the right colors (red, black, white, navy). A perfect show for July 4th."
5.0,I bought this watch band for my Charge 3..it fits perfectly and is very feminine!
5.0,These are absolutely gorgeous! I had them customized with inelastic string and i am overjoyed with the outcome. 5 stars for assistance as well. No complaints! Flawless service
5.0,"Well constructed, fits great, perfect for my spooky daughter."
5.0,"I absolutely love this jacket. It is tight as I except. I wore a long sleeve shirt underneath it to golf, the trump hole design holds the sleeve in the same place just perfect. I will wear a coat outside of it if the weather gets colder, I think it will be a perfect mid-layer since it fits tight."
5.0,Excellent quality! Much bigger than anticipated!
5.0,very light and stylish
5.0,"This is an exceptional bag for everyday use.  The overall size is quite compact and yet it has so much storage.  The assortment of compartments allows everything to have its place without being mingled. I've used this bag as a purse but also as a camera storage bag while traveling.<br /><br />The construction on this bag is impressive with substantial zippers, a thick nylon strap, and heavy canvas. It easily holds everyday essentials like one's smart phone, wallet, pencils, pens, a notebook, and kindle/iPad.  The bag's capacity would make it a great bag for a college student.<br /><br />I'm a gal and I have no qualms about using this bag, as the design and coloring is unisex.  Despite working equally well for ladies and gents, I would love to see this bag in some fun colors like kelly green or a spring yellow.  The brown works with many outfits but sometimes a punch of color is desired and I would seek to gift this bag to others if there were more color options available.<br /><br />I think this bag would make a great gift for folks of all ages and backgrounds.  The construction is admirable and I think my bag will last through many outings and likely many years.<br /><br />I received a complimentary bag for evaluation purposes"
5.0,"Just beautiful . A little big, but was easy to fix"
5.0,Wife loves it.  A little bolder than the others and she loves it.  She wears it like a hotwife and she looks that way also.
5.0,Loving this bag.  Just the right size to hold everything I need.
5.0,The perfect gift for a fan!
5.0,Un poquito flojo pero esta bien.
5.0,This band is amazing and looks and feels just like the apple loop band. Amazing and perfect. Would buy again!
5.0,"I was very worried about the fit of this skirt, as I always am when buying clothes online, but it fit great! I am 5' 2&#34; and about 190lbs and purchased the XL in blue, and it was everything I hoped for. The material was stretchy and forgiving, and on my short legs looked very cute. On longer legs I would suggest leggings for sure, otherwise one bend might expose a little more than the wearer was hoping for (unless the wearer is banking on that sort of attention.) All in all I am very happy with the skirt, especially for the price. The quality is very good and the color is rich. I purchased it for a play on the Sailor Moon skirt, and it will work great for that."
5.0,"Great quality, Wife loves them"
5.0,Very pleased. Beautiful color and made solid. Going back and seeing what else Turquoise Network has that I want.<br /><br />My co-worker is going to love this gift.
5.0,"Bought this robe as a gift for my grandson - and he loves it!  It is soft, easy to wear and the colors are bright/vivid.  He will probably outgrow it before he wears it out - so I'm pleased with the price too.  Overall - great purchase!"
5.0,This a beautiful and well-made ojuzu. Highly recommended.
5.0,Good workout tank that is awesome for sweating.
5.0,"AMAZING!!! We bought these for my Father for Father's Day this year, and it was very emotional. He is 60+ years old, and was able to see the color of the sky, trees and grass for the first time in his life! He has a blue/green color-blindness, so these were the only glasses that offered correction to his specific birth defect. Not only were they a HUGE hit, but he kept texting me all day about how everything is so bright, and how he was going to have to learn his colors! It was such a pleasurable experience for my sister and I to give him the gift of color. I would reccomend this product to anyone that knows what kind of color blindness they have, so they find the right lenses."
5.0,"Purchased large shirt as a gift which the fit and make were very nice. Material is soft, print is neat, and fit is as expected. Would make more purchases again."

5.0,OMG this are soooo comfortable. When I first got them I instantly thought to myself &#34;These are just not going to work&#34; but as soon as I put them on I changed my tune immediately! I highly recommend these and I plan on getting way more of them!
5.0,"It is very flattering and hides tummy fat. The fabric is just right - wore it in 90 degree weather and was not too hot, also is not see through! I received complements from multiple people while wearing this dress. I would recommend :)"
5.0,Paddle boarding - no fear of losing my shades. Don't bounce around or distract you. Fished them out of the water with the paddle (I was trying something real fancy when I fell in).
5.0,"I purchased 2 of these in the past but my son FOUND one so now it's his. He hates wearing belts to school although it's required. He tried this and loved it. Of course, that means I never have a belt when I need it. This belt snaps to your side loops and eliminates the buckle pressing into your stomach. These belts aren't the same quality as my original purchase, but they will still be useful since I don't wear often. Great purchase price for multiple of these."
5.0,love these glasses- very well made and CUTE!
5.0,Great product. I work 10 hours a day on cement. No more cramping. I waited to review this product to give time for it to make the difference I was looking for.
5.0,"Got this dress in black. It is a very nice flattering fit. I was not sure if I was going to like the embroidered flowers or not, but they are really nice quality. Before I got my order I was in Macy's and noticed several embroidered items which looked like the exact same flowers LOL. For a lot more money!  The fabric is somewhat soon but a decent quality and you cannot see through it.  Wearing this to an event where people are wearing black or pink and I think it will be outstanding once I get my spanx on and get all dolled up LOL!"
5.0,Got this for SAAM and totally love how it looks. good quality.
5.0,This costume was super cute and my daughter absolutely loved it!
5.0,THANK YOU VERY WELL
5.0,I am super pleased with this skirt. Quality is better than I expected and the fit was great.
5.0,"I love these so much! I get compliments all the time. They are study and have survived a summer of being in and out of my bag and being thrown around by my toddler when I forget to put a toy or book in the diaper bag. They were so worth it, and if they ever break I would definitely buy them again."
5.0,"Fits well, their underwear!"
5.0,The bees are a great size for any age
5.0,Loving it!!! Fits perfect. I normally wear a Medium but after reading the comments on previous buyers they all recommended to go a size bigger which I did.
5.0,LOVE how these look on my granddaughter.
5.0,I love these g unit tank tops. They are amazing. Fit is perfect. Love the feel it’s like I’m not even wearing one. Order came quick and packaged very nicely.
5.0,"This dress is so beautiful. One of my favorite dresses. It fits me perfectly at where my waist is, which is very tough to find."
5.0,I purchased these for a gift for girlfriends and they loved them!
5.0,Got for my grandson and he goes to gym all the time and he Love it.
5.0,"Wonderful cotton fabric and true to size. I'm 5'5&#34; 150 pounds (36-30-40) and the Large fit perfectly with a little room to spare in the body. I kept it because it was perfect for my 36C chest. Perfect length for work, just above the knee. Comfortable and professional."
5.0,"Love these glasses for regular sunglasses, and they have a bifocal in them.  After eye surgery I was sensitive to bright sunlight. These wrap around and work great, plus they let you read things as well."
5.0,"They are so pretty. Have ordered several things from Gem Stone, and I’m never disappointed. They are a sweet sixteen birthday present."
5.0,My granddaughter likes very much thanks
5.0,Great band! Fit is perfect. It has held up very well. No fraying along stitching. Fits the watch perfectly and easily changed.
5.0,I ordered a bunch of these and they are exactly what I wanted and cheaper than the ones at the PX. This is the true military one and is rated for the same test strength. I am able to use mine to hang from (I weigh usually around 175-185 pounds) and it supports me with ease and no frayed webbing. I have also used 3 of these hooked together as an emergency tow line (it was a bad day don't ask lol) and it held up with minimal frayed edges from the strain. Very good work on these!!
5.0,Wife loved it as a add on piece to a costume
5.0,"My friend's son is having a kid and he is a musician.  So, I wanted something musicy for the baby.  When this came up, it was a must have.  I received it the other day; it's 100% cotton and well-made - it is adorable.  It is SO cute and the absolute perfect gift for someone who loves music."
5.0,"Very soft. Comfortable. Unlike some other nightgowns, it doesn't get knotted up if I move around a lot at night."
5.0,the product came in on time. i am actually surprised the item seems to be sturdy and its also very slim. it is perfect for key belt ring.  i highly recommend
5.0,Beautiful and bold
5.0,very comfy shoe for working around the house.  I ended up purchasing a different pair for work. Same brand of course.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:130d1887a4099667173c88456262d464]] I have tried several cycling shorts, and this cycling short is up there, especially considering that the price is just short of $20.  This cycling short is the diamond in the rough, there is nothing else on amazon that can compare at this price range. Simply put, you are getting top notch chamois, decent fabric, and non-chafing seams for $22.50. This isn't even mentioning the stylish design.<br /><br />FIRST IMPRESSIONS:<br /><br />The shorts came in a shipping bag with padded insides. The shorts were folded, inside a ziplock bag with two tags attached. I unfolded them and tried them on. I ordered Red-line, and the logos were non-obstrusive. There was a single reflective logo on the left pant leg, and the leg bands were reflective with nothing but the word &#34;Paladin&#34; written on them.<br /><br />FUNCTION:<br /><br />Let's start with the chamois. The main differentiating factor between this chamois and other cycling shorts is that it is firm. With other cycling shorts, the chamois is so soft that it basically disappears when 150 lbs of weight is put down on it, providing almost no padding. This is similar to pillows: most pillows are the same thickness, yet the higher end ones are much firmer. The fabric also has adequate ventilation.<br /><br />The fabric is decent. It isn't as spectacular as the chamois but it is decent nonetheless. The waistband is standard elastic, while the leg<br />band is a silicone/rubber pad that grips well, and doesn't cause excess sweat. The fabric is standard nylon/spandex mixture, and is stitched tightly enough so that it is not see through. The inner fabric is thicker than the outer fabric at the edges of the shorts, for design purposes most likely. In addition, the seams are completely flat stitched, meaning that as you move around on the bike, there is no chafing or discomfort at all.<br /><br />FIT:<br /><br />I am 5'10, 146lbs and following the sizing chart provided, I ordered an American Medium, which is a Chinese XL. The size fits well. The short legs are long enough, and the chamois is in all the right locations. Following the sizing chart is fine, the fit would be &#34;as expected&#34;.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />On Amazon, there is not much better that I can see. The main differentiating factor between this and other similarly priced pairs (such as SANTIC) is the firm and stiff chamois. This provides superior padding, especially for longer rides. I went on a 3 hour ride with this, and it had zero discomfort at all.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. I am in no way obligated to provide a positive review."
5.0,"I love this necklace. It's cute, great quality and the chain is sturdy but dainty. I've received lots of compliments on it."
5.0,I just love this set.<br />I wear it all the time .<br />need more sets<br />great gift to give to someone you love.
5.0,"We love these socks with Keds. They seem a little big when we put them on our toddler, but fit just fine under shoes and don't seem to bother her at all!"
5.0,"Size as described, feels nice, fits nice. They never disappoint"
5.0,I have ordered many of these and are great for the product I make with them.  will continue buying I'm sure.
5.0,Very beautiful colors nice fit as well
5.0,"Me gustó mucjo el diseño, me permite tener ordenadas mis tarjetas."
5.0,"A unique and extremely comfortable watch band replacement. Design and installation are not conventional, and no instructions were included -- a big mistake on the part of the manufacturer, as how to use it was not intuitively obvious to me and I almost sent it back, feeling foolish that I couldn't figure it out.As a last resort, I put the watch band on my wrist without the watch on it, and then it became clear how it works! I'm so delighted with it, I wanted to write this to recommend this band (actually there was a second band of a different color included) and encourage others that don't immediately understand how to use it; it''s very cleaver and really simple once you get the concept. I've used it for about a month, and I wouldn't trade it for a conventional band like I've worn for more decades than I want to mention!"
5.0,Very pretty ...one slight imperfection barely can notice
5.0,"Love these socks. Fits a size 15 foot well. Solidly constructed, seems like they will be fairly durable.<br /><br />Update - 1 year later: I have not put any holes in these socks after one year.  I purchased 6 pair, along with 6 of another brand, and the Dickies Dri-Tech socks have been going strong.  I wear a pair at least three times a week in Merrel Jungle mocks and feel they breath well."
5.0,"i  like the style, fits great provides shading around whole head, so will be ideal for walking around the neighborhood, doing yard work as well, keeping the sun out of eyes and off the head."
5.0,As good as you can expect for some split rings
5.0,I like the fit.  Not too tight and not too loose. Soft material. Easily slips over the head and out the door kind of dress.
5.0,"This unit gets filled w/ ice & H2O for almost daily trips around the golf course. Keeps water COLD and is large enough to provide for adequate hydration even on hot, humid days. It fits neatly in pouch that is slung under the clubs on my wheeled cart. PERFECT!"
5.0,"You wouldn't know they're party favors, they are light, sturdy, fit well and stay put for a one-hour walk.  This batch of 12 came in four pastel colors: Orange, violet, lime green and blue."
5.0,Makes tying those fly fishing knots easier and faster by magnifying the line. I don’t have to put my reading cheaters on now.
5.0,All tofu st are excellent.
5.0,"So this product has had mixed reviews. I got mine today and I was surprised that it actually did come with the three armor rings. Now, the tip of the ring does come off easily but this was an easy fix. Also, if you want to keep it from popping off, it's easy to fix with pliers (See pix below) The rings are also easy to adjust with pliers, but you can also adjust them with your own fingers. The tip ring is a tad bit difficult to adjust so it's easier if you just pop it off first, adjust it, fix to joint so it will not pop off, and then putting it back on. The rings are aesthetically pleasing and mobility is good, with the tip of your finger being a bit stiff, but not enough to be uncomfortable. The rings are also light weight.<br />All in all this was a great product"
5.0,This dress is so much fun. It’s not too loose and it’s not tight at all. It compliments every body type. I ordered the aqua and the color is so pretty. Very satisfied with my purchase.
5.0,Loved the look & feel of this dress.  The color was a Beautiful soft rose pink.
5.0,Purchased for a stocking stuffer this bracelet was nice quality for the price.
5.0,Great light weight bracelet. Easy on and off. Glad it's helping women in Guatemala.
5.0,"great fit, great look.............A+ vendor.........."
5.0,These shorts are nothing but great.. they are thin and airy.. yes !! They are lightweight and stylish... yes !! They are cotton.. yes !! No zippers and heavy add ons.. yay !! They are super comfy.. Not only my hubby..even I can wear them whole day.. they seems unisex design to me as they don't have anything in the middle zone.. lol 😂 And have two side pockets and drawstring to adjust waist...  I like the little polka dot design.. for summers they are so so cool and comfortable!!! They're worth the price
5.0,I love the bowed fabric so I don't suck the mask as I speak.  It fits more snugly than other masks for a feeling of extra protection.
5.0,"SO cute! My daughter loved it! Got a 3T for her 3rd bday, she is around 34lbs."
5.0,Very cute. The colors on the suit is as vibrant as the picture!
5.0,I love it! Keeps me warm when I workout outside. price was reasonable!
5.0,Great fit for a teen who wears size 10.5 in shoes. Colors are bright and vibrant.
5.0,My daughter loves it! it's delicate and very pretty
5.0,Really pretty necklace and earring set.  It looks more expensive than the price and that appeals to everyone - right?  This will match many items in my wardrobe and I can't wait to wear it out so others can see it.  I expect a lot of compliments on this purchase.
5.0,The dress is elegant and it fits very well. The material feels great! There is no polyester! I really like it and can't wait to wear it formally.
5.0,"excelent item, fast shopping , thanks"
5.0,"Sometimes you want a hat that while spreading a message of love and acceptance is not ""in your face.""  This is the hat.  Everybody knows that the rainbow is a sign for the LGBTQI+ community, but this much less than waving a rainbow flag.  It is a very subtle ""you have my support.""<br /><br />The hat is excellent quality, crisp, new, but also has the rounded bill for comfort.  The stitching for embroidery is very well done, well laid out and no loose threads.<br /><br />Certainly if you want to show your support for the LGBTQI+ community, or just want a nice looking hat with a subtle message, this is perfect.  5 stars!"
5.0,"Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. Small, classic and perfect for everyday/any day wear."
5.0,Got these for my husband for Father's day and he loves em. No complaints
5.0,Bought this for my husband who has LARGE biceps from working out. The shirt fit great . Love the different colors and buttons — fit in well in the Florida theme— would buy again
5.0,"I ordered the “Keep Calm and Dance on Shirt” from Ann Arbor T Shirt company. I love the shirt! The saying is cute and also the little ballerina. I saw the order online and knew I wanted it. The color of the shirt is red and matches the picture online exactly. The decal also matches exactly, so no surprises! I don’t know how to describe the decal material, but it is secure on the shirt. Sometimes printed shirt can have cheap decals- like the ones you get on the boardwalk at the beach that peel off; but this decal does not look like it is going to come off in the wash. The tee shirt is made out of 100 % cotton, so it is soft and durable but still very comfortable. The size of the shirt is what I expected as well. I ordered it larger than my usual size because I plan on wearing it as a pajama top or to lounge around in, but I was not disappointed by the size whatsoever. The shipping on the package was exceptional as well. The shirt arrived two days after I placed the order. I love the shirt and believe it is better than compared items that are similar. I will be looking to order from this company again in the future.<br /><br />Disclaimer - I did receive this product at a discounted price or free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. I take my reviews serious and will only provide accurate and honest feedback. I am not connected to this company or any of the companies of products that I review."
5.0,Overall happy with product only complaint is I wish head phones were better quality. For the price its great.
5.0,"I ordered these for post birth. They are well-made, comfortable and not unattractive. I like that they come up higher on the belly for a little extra support after birth but stay low on the thighs."
5.0,Good Quality material.  I would say that I'm a true medium and ordered a small based off of other reviews and it fit perfectly
5.0,"I was looking for an inexpensive bag with zippers and multiple pockets that my 14-year old daughter could comfortably carry on a 1-week school field trip through NY and DC. While it turned out to be slightly smaller than what I wanted, it was perfect for her. Kept her from carrying unnecessary items and making it heavy. The zippered pockets kept items separate and safe from accidentally falling out or from prying hands - Cell phone in bigger front exterior pocket for quick access. Back exterior pocket was used for portable cell phone charger and disposable rain jacket. The two smaller front exterior pockets were used for chapstick and $20 cash so she wouldn't be pulling out all her money at a time. In the interior zipped pocket, we placed additional cash in small denominations.  And her school ID was placed in one of the open interior drop pockets normally used for cell phone. The interior compartment was big enough for knit gloves and hat and left a little room for other small items if needed. Upon her return, it is being used as a great, beautiful, everyday crossbody just the right size for school."
5.0,"Compression fit. Material was pretty good for it being under $30. Don’t understand the negative reviews, my zipper was normal and not a smiley face. Will probably buy another one in a different color."
5.0,"This dress is flowy and fun.  My husband and I go dancing every week and this dress got lots of compliments at the Friday night party at the dance studio! It took me a few minutes to determine the best way to lace up the bodice to all my curves, but once I figured it out the dress is extremely flattering. Everything about the bodice is adjustable, with the lace up front ribbon and the back adjustable straps it fits perfectly. It's very flowy and light weight but not see through at all.  I ordered my usual medium and it fits as expected.  Really love this dress."
5.0,Love the colors of this bracelet.  It fits my small to average wrist nicely.  It appears well-made.  Plan to get a lot of use out of this bracelet.
5.0,It fit perfectly to my daughter. I love it and she love it as well. 😍
5.0,"Easy to pack without any damage.  When I wanted to cover my entire head, I tied a scarf and added the brim hat on top.  The brim kept the sun out of my face.  Was wonderful for my Mexican vacation on Cabos."
5.0,I am usually a medium but ordered a large .. just in case..  I have some room super comfortable
5.0,"I ordered these gloves for use while whittling.  I have longer fingers, but not super big hands and these fit very comfortable.  They are lightweight and work really well.  I used a leather thumb guard over them.  I still have very good mobility and usability of my hands.  I would recommend and purchase again for moderate cut resistance."
5.0,"I liked the quality of the fabric and the high low silhouette. I also liked the pockets and the fact that my chest didnt bulge out, I usually have trouble with button downs. Can’t think of a dislike on this one!"
5.0,My girlfriend loved these!
5.0,"Great pocket readers. When folded, they make their own case and take a lot of abuse."
5.0,"Gift for a friend. It fits her great, but it’s snug and she’s a relatively small person so it might be a little tight for not so small people. She loves it though. It’s comfy, and the scarf is great."
5.0,Love these new shower sandals they really fit the bill for when I shower in the gyms shower!
5.0,The color is better than I was expecting and the material makes it nice for washing.
5.0,"These leggings are great if you like leggings, they are cotton mostly and fit a little bit smaller than I expected I would definitely order a size up."
5.0,"I like this dress and it's really comfortable for me. I did purchase my size based on the size chart and....the fact that I'm curvier than the women in the pictures. I know that based on experience I need to go a size up when it's not a Black owned company (honesty). I will be purchasing more this year, since last year I was really just testing it out by purchasing one. When I wash this dress, I dry it on delicate because I didn't want to ruin it in any way so, the dress still looks new."
5.0,This is a cute and soft sweater that celebrate Valentine’s Day without being over the top
5.0,I like the colors and prints<br />I received many compliments
5.0,Great Buy and fast shipment
5.0,Been looking for a robe that I can use all throughout my pregnancy journey and glad I found a perfect one! It’s comfortable and I like that I can use it even during the summer time. Good buy!
5.0,"Great quality for the price,  they look really cute!"
5.0,"I love the T-shirt, never had a t-shirt fit so perfectly. I choose the thickest fabric option but it’s very soft and comfortable. Will be buying more."
5.0,This works great in my purse. It velcro to a strap and I just hooked my keys on it an now I don't lose them. I have a lg purse and keep losing my keys.
5.0,Look so cute and perfect size 😍
5.0,Awesome for boating and not too expensive.
5.0,"Love it, perfect size setting."
5.0,"Bought this for my lovely neice, it made her look even lovelier"
5.0,We like the product but more3 importantly support their cause. Win Win
5.0,My little one doesn’t like the mask. This product helps him keep it on!!<br /><br />It took a long time to receive though. That was the only down fall. Great product though!
5.0,Comfy and nice. Great band.
5.0,"Ordered this dress for an event and I'm 6wk postpartum. It literally has the perfect amount of stretch to it while still remaining flattering to my figure. Even better, I was able to pump while wearing it and it isn't a frumpy maternity/ Nursing dress with obvious flaps for the chest. The dress is a mock wrap and the tie is more for decoration. The length hit just above the knee. Washed well too. I would definitely recommend this dress!!"
5.0,"I got these headphones for my son with special needs, who has sound sensitivities. I had avoided getting earmuffs before because he also has sensory issues with his head. I can't get him to wear hats, glasses, anything on his head.<br /><br />What I love about these earmuffs:<br />1. They fit really tiny heads. My son is small and other &#34;kid-size&#34; headphones I have tried have been way too large. These fit him perfectly and could easily fit an infant and quite possibly a cat.<br />2. They work. They fit snuggly on the head and block out all of the background noise. I could still hear and understand someone talking to me from a few feet away, but it is very quiet. Almost as if I was underwater listening to them.<br />3. Surprisingly, my son likes them despite his head sensory issues. He seems to like the gentle pressure. And these do not move, no matter how much my son runs around.<br />4. They come with a bag. This is just really handy. And it's a wide mouth bag, so I don't have to struggle to get the headphones in or out. I can hang it up in a certain spot and my son knows where to go get them.<br /><br />There is one trick to adjusting these. The adjustment is not done in black band, like I was expecting. That doesn't move at all. The resizing is done by the silver wire pieces that attach the earmuffs to the black band. So every time you take the earmuffs off, they slide back to the smallest size, which makes storing them in the bag easy. However, it does mean that my son cannot put these on himself because it takes some complex motor planning to pull the earmuffs out against the resistance that keeps them in place on the head, which he cannot manage independently. So a way to lock a size in place would be icing on the cake, but that is a tiny note. The most important part is that they work for my son, which enables him to stay more enagged with his family, classmates, and friends."
5.0,"So comfortable and still wearing them years later.  I don’t sleep in them, I wear them for around the house pants, instead of jeans, to do every day housework and such.  So soft."
5.0,"This ring is fantastic!!! I was so happy to get it! My husband broke his ring and we were looking for a new one - and he wanted it to be black. I was a little hesitant to buy it because I wasn't sure if it would actually be a strong tungsten ring, but it is! It's perfect! He is so happy with it and it looks great on his finger. The brushed matte look is super chic and its a comfortable fit as the inside is a little rounded. I purchased this at a discounted price. It was completely worth it!!"
5.0,"it was a gift, and seems like his favorite one. Wears it a lot"
5.0,Loved this patriotic shirt so much that I purchased a red one too!
5.0,I can not tell you how amazing this bra is. I am just beginning my second trimester and my breasts have been so swollen and uncomfortable and then I got this in the mail after trying other brands and I feel like a human being again. Just ordered another set because I never want to take it off. I am a 36D and ordered the medium and could not be happier. Wish I had this for my other 3 pregnancies.
5.0,Love how these hang. They are showy enough but not over the top. Good quality!
5.0,My wife love's it thanks
5.0,Love these!!!!!!!
5.0,"It is incredible how well made the polarized filter in these lenses work, it completely erases my reflection from glass and water.  You cannot beat the price and the style, I am completely impressed.  I fish a lot and getting rid of the reflections is a big deal when fishing the flats.  These lenses do their job well."
5.0,"Works great! Used it under my other mask at the hayride I work at. Got so many people with it, and so many compliments. The sound sensitive mic may be to sensitive, it picks up the voices of literally everyone around me. Haven't had to change the batteries yet!"
5.0,"Me gustó la calidad de la tela, el estampado, el producto en general es fascinante."
5.0,These are my FAVORITE MASKS EVER!!! they are super comfortable and easy to breathe!  Unlike any other mask I tried these do not make my skin breakout!
5.0,"This is my first pair of Eye Love sunglasses. I have to say I am impressed with the quality. They are very well made and the glasses are comfortable and lightweight. They fit well on the nose and the backs of my ears. I like the tortoise shell frame with the brown lenses. The lenses are not real dark and you van easily see your eyes through them. These Premium Polarized Wayfarers from Eye Love, 100% UV Blocking, Durable, Lightweight come well equipped with a hard case, Soft cloth case and a repair key chain/screwdriver. I love the  the polarized lenses. They very clear and  blocks the glare  well. The fact that this company gives back is also awesome.

5.0,I am infatuated with the evil eye since my trip to Turkey.  Product reached me in very good condition.  Thanks.
5.0,It's not see through it's well made and looks nice.
5.0,Very pretty white opal earrings exactly as described; I get lots of compliments on them because of their shape (hearts) and color which is quite fiery while still being light. Wear them all the time!
5.0,I love this Jean's. I always struggle finding good fitting Jean's. These Jean's fit perfectly and they are stylish.
5.0,"Very cute and comfortable little dress! I bought this to wear to a funeral and the long sleeves are great for fall with some tights. Based on the reviews it seemed like it ran a little bigger than your normal size, so I decided to order an x small. For reference I’m 5’2” about 127 and usually wear a small or medium. The length hit on my knees."
5.0,Fits perfect! WELL MADE !
5.0,"I really like these shirts. They look nice, wash well, and are comfortable.  They do run a bit small, but most tech type fitted shirts do. I order a size bigger and it fits great."
5.0,"I absolutely ADORE this bag. It’s very comparable to all my other KS bags, so well made and I love their pebble leather. Carries all the essentials: I can fit my wallet, a mask, a pillbox, my keys and a few other things on one side, and my hand sanitizer and iPhone 12 Pro in the other pockets, along with my sunglasses. Super light, compact, and the strap is on the shorter side, which is perfect for me cause I’m super short. Love it."
5.0,Love the fit and everything about the dress!!  Color was as I expected.  Would buy again from this maker.
5.0,Casual but go well with any style of clothing.
5.0,I love this dress it fits amazingly and hugs all of my curves😍
5.0,My grandson absolutely loves these! And they came so quick.
5.0,"I'm 5'7&#34;, 150 lbs, 34B.  I ordered the medium and the fit and length are good.  I appreciate that the straps are adjustable.  I ordered it to wear for sleeping but this dress could easily be worn in any social situation.  I'll order it in another color or pattern for the summer."
5.0,What a great gift for the wife. Made her day.
5.0,"There perfect ,better than I thought they would be."
5.0,This is a perfect crop top. I by no means have a 6 pack and this shows just enough.
5.0,"Love the silver work, so dainty.  The color of the lapis is nice and bright & both earrings are a perfect match."
5.0,"Really like these pajamas.  They are extremely soft and comfortable.  They maintain their shape well.  Have worn them for four straight days and they still fit the same - did not stretch our of shape.  Have not washed them yet, so I don't know if they shrink when washed."
5.0,I loved the boots.  They fit perfect and went with my Halloween costume.  I would recommend this company to anyone.  all my friends want to borrow them.
5.0,It will shrink
5.0,Arrived quickly and work as expected
5.0,"Great leggings for the price, pretty, fit well too. Only small/slight complaint, they slide down a lot, I'm always pulling them up.  Happy enough that I ordered another pair."
5.0,"I LOVE these earrings, I use them in my conch piercing since they have the flat back.<br />ONLY issue, which really isn't even an issue, the back plate is slightly thicker than expected, however if you're wearing these on your lobes, not a problem.<br /><br />It varies from pair to pair if the front screws on or the back, which isn't a big deal at all.<br /><br />BUY THEM."
5.0,"I lost my first pair on the Metra, and, of course, they were never turned in (Ha)."
5.0,My wife says she really likes them.  i talked with her and she gave them the evaluations I listed.
5.0,Perfect match for me it's a tiny bit big on the lower torso but that just makes it cuter. Awesome purchase I'm very happy with it :3
5.0,It’s beautiful and serves as a great face covering during this pandemic. It even has a filter if needed.
5.0,Jacket fit perfectly. Very well made and the faux fur was nice and fluffy not cheap !
5.0,"Great tights. Not sure what the purpose of the hole on the bottom of the soles is for though. Otherwise, these are thick and sturdy for my 6 year old to wear."
5.0,Definitely worth buying! Sturdy! The bf loves to wear it out all the time
5.0,"This shirt is beautiful, silky and so comfortable. The colors are vivid, just like the picture. So glad to own this shirt!!!!!!"

5.0,"Bought it as a present to my wife...the first one (medium) was too large on her, but the seller was very quick to issue a refund and I bought a size smaller.  This is now her favorite sweatshirt.  Thank you very much!!!! 5 STARS!"
5.0,"This dress is absolutely beautiful and quite flattering.  At 4'10"" and 135 lbs (38DD), I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.  It flattered my curves and I received numerous stares and compliments all night.  The bust area was more than adequate for large breasts and I did have to safety pin the shoulder area to my bra, just to pull a little of the excess bust fabric up to be more form fitting.  Despite a couple small safety pins, the dress was absolutely perfect and I'll be ordering it again in another color."
5.0,Nice.gift for.xmas

5.0,"I love these mesh watch bands and bought several colors. The magnet is really strong, so be careful around metal things. LOL. My fork was stuck to my watch band at breakfast- good opportunity to laugh. The bands are really cute, though."
5.0,"With COVID causing many students to transition towards an online education, I purchased these glasses for my daughter to see if they would prevent her eyes from straining too much while completing her assignments. When I received these in the mail, I was pleasantly surprised by the nice packaging and overall quality of the glasses! It comes with the frames, glasses case, microfiber cloth to wipe the glasses, as well a blue ray generator card that can act as a form of measurement to see how much blue light is being emitted. Very satisfied with my purchased, and so is my daughter!!<br />I will definitely be recommending this product to my friends and family."
5.0,"Great quality, launders well"
5.0,"5'1 and 130 lbs I ordered a medium. It's thin and see through, kinda like a windbreaker. Fits cute like booty shorts. I'd probably wear it only to the pool. Maybe should have sized up for a slight bigger fit bit I like it!!!"

5.0,I love the gloves they keep my hands warm. Well insulated.
5.0,Great shorts but there’s nothing MENS about them at all. I can’t even get one leg in and I’m not a big at all. Sucks I have to return them because they’re such nice shorts but they’re not mens
5.0,"Great shorts! Comfy, soft! Love the pockets!<br />The band for the tummy is good too.  I have strong thick thighs. Really fit nice"
5.0,Perfect fit. Love!!
5.0,"I'm 29, 6ft and 245lbs, wide in the chest and back area. I went with the XL and its perfect,  a little snug in the chest area and just right in the stomach and waist area.  I'm definitely gonna order more. Comfortable,  light weight, very breathable."

5.0,"This mask is just like it looks in the picture! Super adorable, with adjustable straps. It is also very thick. Love it!"
5.0,It fit a little small but not tight. I still like it a lot. After having this hat throughout the winter it did me good on those cold days.  So I update my rating
5.0,I bought this for my niece. She is a size 10/12 and fits in the dress perfectly.
5.0,"Fits as expected, nice hat"
5.0,A unique looking watch that my son was thrilled to receive Christmas morning.
5.0,This is a unique gift for the person who loves dolphins and is of Irish descent. Beautiful workmanship and design.
5.0,"This came in as expected.  I suffer from nickle allergies and love that there was not a lot of metal in this.  The big gem came loose, but a little bit of gorilla glue has fixed the problem right up.<br /><br />I received this at a discount or free in exchange for an honest review, this does not change my opinion of the product in any way."
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter, she loved it"
5.0,"Ordered a size small, fits good. 5’2 & 122-125lbs"
5.0,Love the fit but because I'm 5'2 I have to get it hemmed but it worth it!
5.0,Adorable for my almost 3 year old.
5.0,"It's adequate.  Not exactly stunning, but does the job."
5.0,Fits perfectly I love it so much I ordered two more of this brand<br />You can’t find anything on line that’s true to size
5.0,Just as described. Dress was made of quality material.
5.0,This is not a heavy sweat pants.  Just what I was looking for.
5.0,So so so cute
5.0,"Got for my teenage son.. got 2 pack for under $7.. and they’re worth it.. not too mention, they look pretty cool in pe class in high school- Does it get better then that? I don’t think so!! Made/wash well so far.. and used about 2 months.. definitely would buy again! Can’t go wrong for the price I got..."
5.0,So easy to slide this to fit round top T-shirt or lovely collared blouse.
5.0,"With scenes of popular Demon Slayer characters these mask are great for children or small adults who love DS! Got these for my daughter to wear to school, she loves she can mix it up. Good quality, straps stay on fairly well. Hold up to usual wear and tear."
5.0,"Beautiful, versatile. Nice construction, doesn’t look cheap. Fun!"
5.0,I just wish they had more colors to buy the shirt in. I love this shirt. Great quality and I would recommend everyone to buy them
5.0,Great product thank you so much
5.0,Amazing necklace I honestly love it..thank you very much 👍🏻👍🏻 I will put an order for another one 👍🏻👍🏻
5.0,Very cute and she loves them!
5.0,As the picture shows love it.
5.0,"I've bought lots of different cheap watches and I keep coming back to this one. Reliable, durable, comfortable, low-profile, good timekeeping, has features just above the bare minimum like day & date display. It's an excellent daily wear watch for a working-class individual."
5.0,"A little big, but they do the trick."
5.0,I gave this to my daughter for her birthday she loved it
5.0,"These are the only socks I own that I can trust to stay on my feet and not bunch up in my shoes. As I stay on my feet constantly at work, that is a gift beyond measure. I wish only that the makers had a lighter-weight, hot-weather version."
5.0,"love it, would buy again"
5.0,"This shirt runs a bit big, but I’m happy with it! I love the rich color, design, and softness. Great to wear with my new earrings too. This HP fan is happy :)"
5.0,Bought it for my daughter she loves it!
5.0,This is my second purchase of this cap. Very good quality.
5.0,The watch is a little bigger than I would prefer but it is very good looking. I wound it the afternoon I got it and it is still running fine and keeping good time five days later with no further winding. I do wear it every day so I don't know how close it may be getting to running down. Hopefully wearing it every day will keep it wound up.
5.0,"I'm still pretty new to cycling, so trying to figure out what works in terms of clothing.  I certainly prefer NOT to spend retail store prices for similar style jerseys.  I mean, $60+...no way can't do it.  This is a very pretty and nice cycling shirt.  It definitely would work very well on a longer torso, which I don't have, but it still is a nice fit.  I just all it up slightly and it works great.  I can securely tuck a few things in the back pockets - spf lip balm, eye drops, small tube sunscreen, a little cash or a credit card, all of  which I always take on longer rides. Nice long pockets and I never have had anything fall out or or any worry of that happening.<br />In terms of quality, I do launder my gear with care, 'eco cold' setting, low spin, hang dry, so no complaints on anything not washing or wearing well.  I think like anything else, if you want it to last, do what's needed to make it so."
5.0,Ideal big 70's glasses! Exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,Great value and really good length for work.
5.0,"They were as described, came very fast. Also came with an unexpected gift which were another set of earrings. I ended up p,easing my girlfriend with those as a surprise. For the cost, you really can't beat it!"
5.0,They're easy to put in and they're cute
5.0,Loved the variety
5.0,"Great robe, soft and absorbent. I bought the large size which fits, with room to grow, on my above average size 4 year old who is 47 inches tall."
5.0,"I have problems with burcitis and since ive been wearing it, it has helped. Also has helped my knee. Really didn't believe in these things but it's working for me."
5.0,My son loved this hoodie!! It’s vibrant and looks just like the picture!
5.0,I love owls and these were just perfect love them
5.0,Mask was exactly the way it was pictured. And very nice quality.
5.0,Great wallet. Quality of leather much better than expected after reading some of the reviews. Currently holding 6 cards and cash without it being bulky. RFID security an added bonus.
5.0,Excellent product for the price  Very good quality.
5.0,I went one size up and I'm glad I did. It fits perfectly and I love it. Really happy about the adjustable straps and I'm glad there are no pockets. I always remove them because they add bulk. Pretty colors too.
5.0,These PJ's are super soft! The color is vibrant and is the perfect shade of pink even though it's called rose red! These PJ's remind me of my soft VS PJ's and they lasted for 14 years! I'm sure these will last just as long
5.0,"Nice material, fit well, had to alter the hole for top a little but my frame is old.  Saved a lot of money this way.  Like having a new umbrella."
5.0,"I liked these ear loop face masks. It doesn’t loosen down the masks. I have the SA brand too, they loosen down and I have to keep pulling them up. I gave three of them gifts my friends liked them. Two friends asked for the brand name to order some."
5.0,"It's great because it is stretchy, which is so awesome when you're wearing a mermaid style gown.  The lace is alittle brighter in color than the lining, which also gives it a great look.  The back has a small train, which ups it elegant look.  It's easy to move in, and demure as well.<br /><br />This is a great dress!"
5.0,"The stockings for a bit too big to size Even according to the size chart. Otherwise it’s a solid quality, good grip and feel fabric."
5.0,Nice product.  Fits very well.  Easy to breathe and looks good.  I love the Velcro.
5.0,I don't know what else to say about them. They are just fantastic.
5.0,"This pendant is WAY More beautiful in person. There are granules at the bottom that adds interest- I didn't notice them in the photo. They look like gold dust. Love the size, the metal tree on the pendant is lovely. I got the gold and the green- love hem both. Cannot wait to put them on a necklace of chakra beads- for the gold tiger eye beads  and for the green chakra beads and adventurine.  They will be stunning. Highly recommended. (Seller also included a disc of meditation and a lovely painting to look at while meditating- both free)"
5.0,"Lovely, well made, cotton pajamas! It seems harder to find with all the fleece and terry cloth. But these are perfect and came in a variety of sizes so I bought several for as my daughter grows. Speedy shipping too!"
5.0,"Bought this for a two week trip to Ireland and Scotland and it was perfect! Lightweight, but keeps the wind and rain out. My only complaint would be there is no tie around the hood. Otherwise loved it."
5.0,Almost
5.0,Will give as a birthday gift.
5.0,"was a gift for my husband, since he travels around a lot, he loves it!"
5.0,"This is such cute room decor for us baseball lovers! The hooks are large and hold several items. So handy for kids rooms to help keep things neat and tidy. Handle covers come in a wide assortment of colors. Hanging hooks keep it sturdy for heavy coats, etc. I highly recommend this quality item."
5.0,"Love the color, material, and fit of this dress! It’s perfect!"
5.0,Love these but buy one size up
5.0,"I ordered a size 9 ,which is my size true to fit they fit perfect! Look exactly like the picture. Got alot of compliments on them."
5.0,"my wife realy liked slippers, she is fan of Nightmare Before Chistmas"
5.0,Fit very well good material and my brother really lived out for Christmas!
5.0,Unbelievable comfort and support from a sandal.
5.0,A really nice (and nicely priced) shirt. It is soft and looks professional. Can be worn anywhere.
5.0,Note shirt material is breathable mesh. Very comfortable!😊
5.0,"These are very well made, perfect amount of sparkle, and great value for the price! I got the 4mm, but I think the 5mm would be a nice size too!"
5.0,I use this granola in a morning smoothy I make. It provides the best taste I have found.
5.0,One of the best shirts I've ever owned.
5.0,Look great and warm. Good quality.
5.0,"Great product, I wear a size 8.5-9 in womens and these fit fine, I could see them fitting someone with feet larger than mine or smaller!"
5.0,"These were perfect for a Halloween photoshoot I did with my younger sister. They were much heavier then I expected because I thought they'd be made of foam, but they were made of plastic which was nice"
5.0,This hat is stylish and warm.  My mom loved it too and I had to order one for her right away.
5.0,"I love this sweater. It's VERY comfortable and not itchy at all.<br /><br />Main concerns are that it's a bit long for my taste, but I roll the hem under and it works out. It can also leave my chest a little chilly depending on what else I'm wearing. Last, you can't really layer with it due to the low cut.<br /><br />It's very flattering and very comfortable."
5.0,"The material felt very nice and comfortable. Loved the color. Love it so much I order another one. In a different color with long sleeves. Can’t wait to get it,"
5.0,"Estos lentes se ven súper nice y son hermosos parecen caros, yo quedé enamorada y voy a comprar de más colores, y del tamaño ni se diga son perfectos y van con cualquier cara 😍😍"
5.0,These run a bit smaller than the average size for me. Thats the only flaw. They are perfect in every way. The padding stays put and they are very breathable. Very comfortable
5.0,thanks so much very nice
5.0,Moon is a little bigger than I thought but not in a bad way. That makes the little ouija board bigger and it's so cute. The necklace length is long which is good.
5.0,"Great for quickly stepping up your style level when wearing suits.  This variety pack gives you more then enough options to match/contrast any shirt & tie combo. Quality is surprisingly good. I was afraid they would be the shiny, obviously cheap looking finish, but was pleasantly surprised they don't look that way.  Definitely worth the price."
5.0,I was surprised by how comfortable this lanyard is around my neck.  Well made.  Worth the money.
5.0,"Love how large and colorful they are, and don't way a thing. Highly recommended 👌"
5.0,It fits perfectly and it looks just like the picture. Better quality than I expected for this price.
5.0,"I was very impressed by the fit and finish of this wallet. A bit larger than I am used to but absolutely no issue inserting or removing from a back pocket. It is relatively roomy and folds very flat (I have 4 cards, 2 IDs and usually 5 to 10 bills in it usually). I would recommend this wallet to anyone looking for a new one and the RFID protection is icing on the cake."
5.0,Very good product and a fast delivery arrived days before original delivery date
5.0,"Not a fan of the fabric but from the pics I knew it was that not so soft, nubby kind of fabric. The upside is it’s a very easy to care for fabric. Great fit and flattering to us curvy ladies. I’m 5’5, 180lbs,  DD cup and the Xlarge was perfect. Received a ton of compliments and felt confident wearing. Fast shipping and very pleased with the purchase"
5.0,"While there are 18 ways in which you can wear the product, I wear them as headbands and for fun put them around my dogs neck which actually ended up being pretty cute. Here are some features that make these a great product:<br />1) Stretchy and versatile - They are stretchy to where you can wear them in many different ways and they stay on well in those different positions.<br />2) Beautiful- I love the color and the variety of colors. They look beautiful whatever way you wear them. And each has different parts to them so you can wear each of them differently<br />3) Fun- The patterns and colors are fun and fun to wear. Enjoy trying new things with them.<br />The only downside is that that some of the pieces have full pictures on them and it is hard to find a way to wear them that the whole pictures shows. Other than that this is a great product!"
5.0,Got these for a holiday sock exchanges they went over really well
5.0,I love the shirt. Getting compliments on it!  The material is an interesting blend. I might buy a few more
5.0,Looks great and quality material
5.0,"I was glad to get these since my piercing had finally healed and I could change the rings out. When I got them I was happy to see there were no duplicates; however, I received a few less than what was promised. This wasn't a big deal to me though. I'm still happy with the product and service."
5.0,"GREAT material, not cheap at all."
5.0,Bought the shoes for my husband. We are camp host and he spends his time outside doing maintenance and yardwork.  The FIRST day he wore the boots...he kept commenting how comfortable the shoes were and his feet didn't hurt.  He loves them.  Great traction and ankle support.
5.0,I loved it. It was a very convenient little purse.
5.0,"I’d bought the visor product ... but it didn’t work for me. These clip ons, however, work beautifully at helping me see better during night driving!  Blocks oncoming headlight glare perfectly!!  Love this!  I have my night driving back!  Thank you!"
5.0,Just perfect summer PJ's! And 100% cotton!
5.0,sorry now Ill know where to look
5.0,I bought these for my husband who complains of headaches all the time from being in front of his computer all day. These glasses have taken that away!! Which leaves a much happier husband which leaves a much happier wife! :) plus he looks really cute in them!
5.0,Very nice fabric and soft and comfortable on the face
5.0,The dark red and black print design go well together. Consider ordering a size larger than usual...I got a medium and it fit like a small.
5.0,Loved the color and style fitted just right
5.0,Fits great and is comfortable.  I like the pockets.
5.0,These leggings are very well made and I recommend them.
5.0,"Great product, better than expected!!!"
5.0,It is so perfect. The kids will be giving this to grandma on her birthday in a week. I think she will love it. It came earlier then expected. Yay for that.
5.0,Love this bag. So many pockets I have room for everything including my wallet and phone. Love the leather strap and the crossbody length of the strap. Very well constructed. Absolutely no complaints. And I had no problem with the price either. Very well worth it. I am sure I will be using this bag for a very long time.
5.0,Link was as pictured - very satisfied with quality and price.
5.0,Perfect purple leotard for my daughter's dance class. Purple leotards can be hard to find-- so I'm glad I found this one. It fits true to her usual size.
5.0,really dark-very
5.0,Not usually a hat person but did like the color and styling of this. Found it very comfortable to wear and got several positive comments by others on it style and how well I look wearing a cap.
5.0,"This is a beautiful necklace, the pictures do not give it justice !"
5.0,"Hot Styles offers an adorable&affordable mini back back that I think is a perfect purse alternative. At least, that's what I use it for on a day by day basis! I originally got it for a rave and that zipper in the back I could hide my debit card/license in took away absolutely all of my anxiety of someone stealing it. (in fact security didn't even check that pocket...) And lemme tell you it was great. The bag has a lot of structure and and 3 compartments. Including a divider in the main section that I accidentally put my phone into and freak out when I don't see it. But other than tricking a fool like myself, that's pretty cool.<br />I also find it trendy, a good size, and I get compliments on it a lot. And some people who say &#34;That's a really tiny back pack&#34;. But don't believe them because it isn't a mini back pack. Its more like a pretty small backpack. Like a large purse.<br /><br />The only thing I had an issue with is some lose threading on the hot styles tag in the front but considering it was more of a aesthetic blip rather quality one I can't find myself taking away a whole star for something like that.<br /><br />(PS my little sister has a mini fjallraven that's about the same size. I wanted one for a long time but I genuinely like hot styles more. I believe the quality/aesthetic is very on par with each other and with Hot styles you're supporting a supporting kitten huggers for a fraction of the price. I really want to get a second one to be honest. Next time I have spending money!)<br /><br />**Wasn't paid for this! Iunno if you can tell but I almost never do reviews so they would have no reason to compensate me for it. :)"
5.0,Great product quality frames adjustable feature rarely found in sunglasses. Clarity in lenses and I live that my purchase helps others.!  Great product price and company!
5.0,My husband likes them! Usually we have to return shoes for him! The width is usually to tight! But these fit good 😊
5.0,"I bought these as a gift for my niece. They are  really the perfect size, big enough to see what they are but small enough to look great on the ears of child or an adult. When I first ordered for my niece I didn’t think they would be good for an adult but after getting them and seeing them, they would work very well."
5.0,Love the shirt and is a great price!
5.0,great to use and good gift for others
5.0,"Perfect for wearing my crucifix. Nice heavy chain and beautiful to boot. Slight problem with the small half of the clasp. Somehow, it gets locked into a  sideways position. Just a bit of pressure on it frees it up again. No big deal but thought I should mention it."
5.0,Arrived quickly & the quality &fit are great! I love that it glows in the dark!
5.0,Super cute hoodie and quality material.
5.0,I am 4 11 225 and the 3x is wayyyy too big. I could have gotten the xl. But the fabric is heavy and nice!
5.0,I Love the dress. I am 5'3 130 lbs and I wanted a look like the picture- very boho- I ordered a bed and it was too tight but it fit my 5'8 130 lbs daughter perfectly. I ordered my a larger one and it's perfect as I am a bit bigger breasted than my daughter
5.0,I like my new watch.  Got a lot of complements when I wore it!
5.0,"Silky smooth, long enough, very slimming, fits beautifully."
5.0,Beautiful as usual. Wonderful company.
5.0,Got them for my daughter who wears sneakers to work and she loves them! Thanks.
5.0,A little lighter grey than what is pictured but its a great maternity dress.
5.0,"love them,  extremely good quality.  have 3 pairs and wear evey day"
5.0,I purchased this for a work badge and it looks great! I really like the material because it is softer than a lot of other lanyards but not a cheap material that some other lanyards have.
5.0,"Excellent and durable sunglasses! I have 2 pairs. Don't waste your money on brands such as Oakley, As I have . YOU WON'T REGRET IT!<br />MADE TO LAST!  WITH UV protection. TRY THEM OUT FOR YOURSELF!"
5.0,"Beautiful- just as expected with size, length and color!"
5.0,"It is Tennessee VOLS, what can I say..."
5.0,"Love these glasses! They are obviously a great deal, and the value is very high for what you pay. I still think everyone who buys these should have a recent eye exam and current prescription, and that may help choose the right glasses.<br /><br />I am using the glasses to try to improve my vision, actually. My current prescription is around -3.00, so I've been wearing the -2.50 glasses around the house (not driving!!). After a few months, my eyes seem to have gotten a bit better, and I'm ordering the -2.00 glasses now.<br /><br />Also, I've seen comments of people getting pretty strong prescriptions and saying they don't work. Anecdotally, I had bad vision compared to most of my peers, and the worst it ever got was about -4.00. So if they didn't already know their prescription, they could have over-estimated and ordered a very high prescription.<br /><br />Pros: Price. With a toddler, I am very hard on my glasses, and I don't mind replacing these if I have to.<br />Ease of ordering. You don't have to go back to the eye doctor and order specially-made glasses.<br /><br />Cons: more cheaply-made than glasses from the eye doctor. But they're way, way less expensive. The lenses are shaded a bit yellowish and they have a shiny quality to them, but, for the price, I think they have a lot of value."
5.0,"They are somewhat see through, but it’s my daughters favorite shorts! Super stretchy and comfortable for her."
5.0,"I have a dog named Lucy, so these PJ’s were a must.  They are comfortable and fun."
5.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; 115 lbs and  34-28-36, I ordered an XS...and this dress fits me PERFECTLY.  I wear it bra-less and the slits make it easy to walk around. No gaps in the chest or underarm area. LOVE. I get so many compliments and I have full range of motion. It is a tad long if you wear flat sandals but I have no problem walking in this dress."
5.0,Love them! Very light and cute! Compliments any outfit. 😉
5.0,These were a good value.
5.0,My husband loves it!! He is very picky on what durable and strong.. highly recommended!! Wife happy!! 😁
5.0,A little bigger than expected but with a growing boy it was fine. Bought these for 11 year old boy that comfortably wears size 10/12 in walmart jogger pants. Great quality. A bit more sweatpants than joggers but overall we are satisfied.
5.0,I love the shirt and it fit perfectly so I have no complaints.
5.0,Love it! Perfect fit and material is nice.
5.0,It fits loose and comfortable.
5.0,Works great with my Samsung gear!
5.0,"So cute.  I love my dog and now that I am at college I do not see her as much as I would like, this ring reminds me of her every day.  Lovely. And perfect for those dauchshund owners out there."
5.0,Granddaughter loved them...well made...cute color...fit great.
5.0,"Very nice-looking sun hat.  It does NOT fold up so it's not packable; I either wore it or carried it on our way.  I wore the elastic band behind my head, under my hair so that helped hold the hat on in very little breezes and then under my chin when the wind picked up a bit.  I got a lot of compliments on this hat."
5.0,Soft material.. Well fitted. I will must purchase another one of same brand
5.0,"These were part of my 10-year-old granddaughter's birthday gift and she loved them!  Of the 3 earring purchases I gave her, she immediately chose to wear one of these earrings!  And they aren't too dangly, so her mom OKd her wearing them!  My granddaughter said they were comfortable and lightweight and she loved they way they looked on her...and I did, too!<br /><br />You get 3 sets of earrings, but if you want to have some fun, you could wear a different emoji in each ear."
5.0,"Got a 3X to work out in. It's been serving me well so far. It's cheap, so as it gets baggier I may cut it up in a cutoff or something. Good stuff. Russell is  pretty  reliable."
5.0,"Well made, just a tad larger than I need. Makes it a bit bulky. Cpartments, zipper, snap all work fine. Nice feel and material."
5.0,"This is all I need to keep my Rolex watch running when I'm not wearing it every day.  I never even knew watch winders existed until I found them by accident.  Guess I'm behind the times..  This winder already had good reviews, and I liked the style, so I decided to buy it.  I'm very glad that I did.  I would recommend this watch winder to anyone needing a reliable basic tool."
5.0,Love this purse.  Quality and convenience.
5.0,"Not only did I LOVE the ring, but it came in the prettiest box ever. The ring is adjustable, made very well. The box, yes I am reviewing that too, is covered in glitter. Now I have another pretty box to hold all my trinkets. 🧝🏻‍♀️ I would recommend 100/10. The ring is now part of my daily jewelry."
5.0,Bought for my Niece that got her ears pierced in October for her birthday she loves them and they seem to be very well made!
5.0,When I got at I thought about sending it back because it didn't look good but when I tried it on omg it was great! I love it
5.0,PEEFECT skirt. I have three different colors! I’m 5’11 and it’s a great fit
5.0,"Fits tight, and looks good"
5.0,"A few months ago I got a multi pack of Jessica Simpson briefs similar to these that I loved at TJMaxx, but couldn't find them anywhere after that! I took a chance on these hoping them would be similar, and I absolutely love them. So comfortable and soft. I've reached an age where I will not put up with uncomfortable panties any longer. I will buy more of these!!!"
5.0,The copper is thick and well crafted. Love it!
5.0,"I have bought 6 and I will buy more. It washes beautifully and you just hang dry. It goes with most everything, so it is my go to top. The material needs to flow not cling, so it being oversized is perfect."
5.0,My kids Love these gloves! Fit perfectly both my 3 & 5 yr old. I recommend hand washing these and air dry so they don’t shrink.
5.0,remembering a time when the world was my play ground..
5.0,Grabbed this for our summer vacation to the National Parks in the Northwest. The hat is breathable but provided tons of sun coverage. Loved the fact that it is also waterproof. We got rained on at Mt. Rushmore and this was the perfect way to keep the rain out of our face while still enjoying the hike.
5.0,"Very comfortable, especially when you're just so tired of underwires..."
5.0,Love it! Just what I needed to make me feel like I wasn't  wearing a tracker.
5.0,"these are just too good for the price, highly recommended."
5.0,"I changed the band to a waterproof WHITE band with red trim.  Aside from that, this is a perfect watch in my opinion.  I HATE battery driven watches.  This is an automatic.  A rare breed in these days of WORTHLESS Battery watches.  Worth every penny.  It is swim and shower proof, and well designed.  It also has all 12 places with ARABIC numerals - not that insane stupid ROMAN numeral stuff that watch makers insist on continuing in the 21st century."
5.0,Had good fun with it. Thank you.
5.0,"This necklace is gorgeous, and works for work, a night out, or a more formal event. It's surprisingly sturdy, too."

5.0,I have bought from this company before their works are gorgeous this was a gift for my daughter and she couldn't have been happier if it had been Christmas morning
5.0,Excellent quality for a good price. Very nice for a young couple.
5.0,It's a really pretty dress with swing to it the only down size to is is that I can stand to lose a few lbs.  Other than that it's great
5.0,I like them because they are stretchy and comfortable. Buttons are securely put on. Also the head band does not pop off the back of my head when I take my mask off.
5.0,These are amazing. Super thin. Light weight. Dries fast. Really soft feeling. Great buy.
5.0,Shirt was exactly as described. My son wears a 6/7 and this shirt fit like a 7/8 so it was perfect. He can get to wear it a little longer.
5.0,it looks amazing
5.0,Very nicely presented in its packaging and very functional for what my husband needed.
5.0,"I love this cobblers apron. The material is great, not too thick or thin, it washes well, colors remain vibrant, snaps are tight and apron is true to size. Wish they had more in my size. I bought two."
5.0,I have this dress in two different colors and I love it. I originally purchased it in a M and the fit is okay. I got it again in a small and it’s perfect. Super cute and hugs all of my curves

5.0,Love this top. Very comfortable. Great length and fit. Very stylish.
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted. Cool and comfortable! Lovely makes me feel pretty. True sizing, Wear 16 ordered XL 5&#34;5 thought might be to loose or snug. Would not size up! Promise you won't regret buying. Recommend hand washing gentle in cool, Keep the integrity of the garment."
5.0,I can barely see the hinge. Very pleased with this purchase!
5.0,"This ring is beautiful!  Fits just right, not too big or small.  :)"
5.0,This is the best
5.0,"It was a present for my niece, fit great"
5.0,"Absolutely loved this dress. Fits perfect I got a size large and usually I wear anywhere between a large and a Xl and I am currently pregnant and it looks super cute on my baby bump. The material is nice, thick and stretchy and does not look cheaply made at all. The slit is right in the middle and doesn't go too high which still makes the dress comfortable. I would love to order the rest of the colors just to have for any other occasion. I did receive this item at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,"This dress is perfect for my square body type. It's my favorite dress! I love it! Unfortunately,  the belt was too big. I ordered a large size, I measure 34inch waist (I have zero curves) and the dress fit perfectly. Top is a little loose,  but I don't have much up top,I'm a 36A. With the help of a padded bra, it fit perfect there too. If I could,  I would buy one to wear everyday of the week."
5.0,They are so cute very happy with them I do hope they hold up we will see. The price is high so I am hoping they clean up well and last.
5.0,"This is a great bracelet!<br /><br />My husband and daughter bought me a very pretty pandora-ish charm bracelet for mother's day. It had several charms on it and was very pretty. However, it didn't take me but a few days to break it. So, I purchased THIS bracelet to replace that one.<br /><br />This bracelet is made with what my mother calls, &#34;Quality&#34; products. It's gorgeous, but strong and well built. I love the fact that the ends of the bracelet twist off for easy access when I want to add or take away charms. I have added all the charms from the last bracelet, plus a few more.<br /><br />I am very happy with this product!"
5.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these!! I work at Amazon and saw them one night while i was picking. DEFINITELY a good buy."
5.0,Fits very well and I love the color on me.
5.0,If you have a small head these masks may not be the best for you. Other than that these are very comfortable and breathable
5.0,If you’re looking for skinny jeans these are the perfect skinny jeans trust me! Im a size 38/40 on waist and length 30 but I have skinny legs and these fit perfectly
5.0,"I was hoping for the best as never having bought this brand before. And this mesh thong exceeded my expectations. Totally comfortable, feels great and gives the equipment a nice lift and look. Not to mention that they are completely sexy. I am ordering another and one for a friend."
5.0,Really good quality material and fits just like expected.
5.0,The dress is as described and is quiet pretty.  Slightly smaller fit than expected.  Fits just below the knee and is a little loose fitting - which I like.
5.0,"Awesome, thank~you I luv them !"
5.0,Finally found a pair of boots I really like. Great boots.
5.0,Cutes slippers! Good quality.
5.0,Fabric was not quite what I expected it to be. It is knit but rather a slick material (kind of like a thin spandex) however it fits very well and looks flattering. I am very happy with this product and can't wait to wear it out.
5.0,"I love the material and how soft they are.  They truly look like dress pants suitable for work, but feel like yoga pants."
5.0,My first vegan shearling and  I love how warm it is in the winter.  Impressive!!!
5.0,Very comfy ordered the next size up if you have wide feet
5.0,Perfect as always 😊
5.0,"I love the material of this waist trainer because it is so stretchy and breathable. I am trying to waist train all day long for faster results, and this waist trainer is so comfortable that I could sleep in it. This would also be a great option for someone who sweats a lot and would like something that won't make their body too hot. I also love the color of this garment because it can go under light-colored clothing."
5.0,Really nice gloves and very comfortable
5.0,My aunt loved this.
5.0,"Great fit, great look, great feel, great purchase!"
5.0,Love love this  earring
5.0,we ordered the next size up and it fit perfect
5.0,Very nice design and product. Very soft.
5.0,"Have you ever covered up with one of those soft, gray, fuzzy sherpa like blankets?  If so, this is that blanket in a sweatshirt!  It's much warmer than I expected!  The fit is not at all flattering for my round shape, but I'll definitely wear it when venturing outside in these cold Ohio winters.  I think it may be a little too warm to wear around my house and I keep it on the chilly side.  I washed and dried this sweatshirt with my normal laundry and there were no issues with shrinkage or it coming apart.  It was just as soft after laundering as before.  It is a little bulky but would be great for layering clothes on a freezing cold day."
5.0,It will be perfect for the next concert!
5.0,I am so pleased with the comfort for wear and the clarity through the visor.  Fantastic product and highly recommend. Will be purchasing more in the future.
5.0,"Perfect for the beach or pool. Ties around waist for an adjustable fit. Nice length. The long, flows skirt also gives that glamorous feel while providing coverage."
5.0,"Does exactly what was promised. Iv used them for snowboarding, hiking, fishing, and even motocross racing. Very versatile, just be aware that they do keep you warm."
5.0,"Orderd this chain to replace one that had broken that was much thinner.  Good quality, easily opens and closes; pretty chain!  I wear it daily - has held up well."
5.0,I love the prints and the masks fit nicely on my face.
5.0,Perfect for giving a 4 year old a haircut with the buzzer.
5.0,After looking all over for cotton socks these are perfect.
5.0,Perfect for the table favors we needed and for the price!
5.0,It looks a little like an ammo belt in the back--kind of partisan. Very cute and sexy--I love it.
5.0,Fit perfect for my 9year old.. she loves them
5.0,Nice pendant but the chain has turned color.
5.0,Couldn't have loved it more
5.0,"Nice fabric, already washed , no need to iron which it's perfect"
5.0,so beautiful for the price. Puts the perfect touch on a plain dress or shirt. LOVE IT!

5.0,Dress fit perfect and was so cute!
5.0,"Super cute dress, very flattering. I will be buying more in more designs."
5.0,I'm 5'0 tall so its atleast 4/5 inches to long for me. Its slightly see threw but with a slip okay. I really think these dresses they are my favorite.

5.0,Love love love this dress and it hides my mommy tummy!!!
5.0,"Looks nice. Pretty much just like the picture. It’s probsnly an inch or so tall. Chain seems pretty fragile, but so far so good. I bought it for a 3 yr old that loves giraffes. She loves it and wears it a fair amount. Well worth the price."
5.0,My other belt buckle broke so I had to get a replacement
5.0,"Nice lil umbrella at a great price.  Perfect for a suitcase &#34;just in case&#34; while traveling, or under the back car seat when needed."

5.0,They go on easily and feel great!
5.0,"Fits the Galaxy Watch 4 perfectly. It's nice and light with plenty of holes for breathability. How will hold up daily is the question. It is substantially thinner than any other watch band I've used in the past, so I'm not sure about the longevity, but it's very comfortable."
5.0,"Have used this for 4 years for boatong and beach trips. Still intact, looks like new."
5.0,Perfect fit. Comfort is ideal.
5.0,Allegra K is my new way to shop! It fits perfectly! Another win!

5.0,Fantastic detail worth it
5.0,I been through many of cargo pants only because i dont like them baggy. I try these and they are perfect i love them. Slim fit is my fit. Im planning to rack up on them b4 they disappear. Hopefully the company dont go out of business and can keep the (NAVY BLUE) in stock.  I brought these for work cause i dont like the fit of the company pants. Everyone ask where i got these. I hate jeans so these are perfect these are the only pants I wear. Thank you.
5.0,I love these earrings. I got them in silver and they look lovely. Plus they are lightweight.
5.0,This cross body/wristlet bag is so cute. It is just the right size for a brunch date or evening out with friends. I purchased the color pink to match a top.
5.0,beautifil product color as in the picture.
5.0,"Great product, works exactly as stated. As someone who loses his earring backs far too often, these were a lifesaver. I appreciate the mini carrying container as well"
5.0,Super soft and warm. Love it!
5.0,Tait was a gift and he loved it
5.0,It is very comfortable ! I
5.0,"We have two small children and these are lifesavers for kids with face masks.  I can't begin to tell you how many times we would go out and then find out that a mask was lost or left behind in a restaurant.  With these lanyards, the masks hang around their necks when not in use and we haven't left any masks behind any longer.  Problem solved!  Love them!"
5.0,Another great dress from HOMEYEE!  This is my third dress from this brand. All have been gorgeous and high quality. So pleased with this brand!
5.0,These are perfect for kids!
5.0,"Headline says it all!  Constructed of nicely made fabric, strong elastic waistband, and good stitching, BHPoloClub Underwear holds up well wash after wash.  Great price, too!"

5.0,Just as described great lightweight robe just what I wanted.
5.0,I love it! It's a great size & fits really comfortably on my shoulder. Mine came packaged really well as in other review but metal parts & pulls not covered.. that did not matter to me. It is the nicest purse I've ever owned I just love it..I got the black with gun metal silver & gold - ish detail (not shiney gold..subtle) I like that you can zip & lock middle compartment great for your wallet :) definitely recommend. Arrived very quickly!
5.0,"As a busy salon we go through a massive amount of gloves. These are nicely priced but more importantly hold up don't ripe, as long as your wearing the right size. We aren't stuffing sausages and prefer to have blood circulating in our hands. So size matters when ordering these."
5.0,Great Hat<br />Good Quality<br />Excellent Value
5.0,I got these for running.  So far they seem to work as expected - no pain in my legs while running.  I'm very pleased with this product.
5.0,"this was the item i was looking for and it have the perfect price among other i saw, fully recommend to all"
5.0,"The quality is very good, even better then I anticipated"
5.0,"Loved the book and gnome...so cute.<br />But, the box was damaged and I really would have liked to store it in its original box..."
5.0,"Very Nice bag, really roomy . Color is very pretty, and the wallet is very nice too"
5.0,Like beautiful
5.0,These work great as expected. I use them to keep my long hair out of my face when washing or sleeping. They stretch well and are comfortable. I would not use this as a mask for Covid.
5.0,"great  love then,  i read reviews and took advise to order one or twoi sizes larger,  ordered one size larger or would have not fit.  SO REMEMER ORDER ONE TO TWO SIZES LARGER FOR PERFECT FIT.  DONT WANT BINDING ETC.  BUT RECOMMEND PRODUCT..  be patient as delivery is little slower than most amazon orders. but b patient.  worth the wait"
5.0,Great medium weight sweatshirts.
5.0,Great shirt.  My nephew loves it. It is unique and a big hit.  I highly recommend.
5.0,"This was a gift sent directly to my niece, so I did not see it in person.  However, they sent a picture & this jacket is just adorable.  Looked like good quality too.  Would buy again."
5.0,"I've purchased about 10 Pinky Star shirts and they're all super cute and comfortable, great customer service!"
5.0,"I love these shorts! They definitely run large, but if you get the right fit they're extremely cute and comfortable. I went off the size chart in the description and my shorts fit correctly. They're a medium and I'm around a size 12. They're a hair loose, but a belt fixes that issue."
5.0,"This shirt is so cute and soft! It is well made and the color is vibrant and stunning!! I love how it came with fabric you can burn to prove it’s cotton, that is new for me. Very clever! Fit as expected. Order usual size."
5.0,"I liked it so much, I bought it in maroon also. I’m 5’9” and 130 lbs. I typically wear a small, but purchased this in medium."
5.0,"Love this dress, I wore this in Bangkok Thailand. I needed to be covered up in this city to respectful to culture. This was 5 stars"
5.0,"Everyone loves a bargain, right?<br /><br />These slippers are very well made, super comfortable (albeit a bit snug if wearing socks), and keep my feet nice and warm without sweating. I always wear socks with these because I don't want to have to wash them any more times than absolutely necessary. The suede material and understated styling are modern and cool looking, and you might even be able to pull these off as some kind of shoe (I can't, according to my kids LOL).<br /><br />For the price, these things are awesome so far. The were really snug when I first received them, but the inner fluffy material has &#34;calmed down&#34; a bit and the suede has probably loosened some, so they fit very well now, even when wearing socks with them as I do.<br /><br />The comfort is superb, but I wouldn't plan on going running or hiking or pretending they're work boots, obviously.<br /><br />I'm very happy with these and I don't think that for the price you can touch these. I'll be picking up the gray pair, and will update this if I come across any issues."
5.0,Another great product.
5.0,"I got these slippers for my niece, and she said they fit perfectly and keep her feet toasty warm. They have hard soles, so she can walk around outside with them without worrying about ruining them. Overall, I'm very happy with these and would absolutely recommend them as a gift or for yourself."
5.0,"Great product, fits my costume wonderfully, and you can't beat the price!"
5.0,This is so cute and flattering! It has the percfect flow but not too baggy-the beads add a fun touch and I want to get these in every color!!
5.0,Precisamente lo que esperaba es perfecto
5.0,I loved how fast they arrived. I loved how they fit. I would get them again.
5.0,"Love this top to wear over gym/yoga, and even &#34;out&#34;"
5.0,This swimsuit fit well.  It covers my butt and chest which is a plus.
5.0,"Love,love these sunglasses!I think I see better with these then my glasses!!"
5.0,"These are perfect for low-cut canvas shoes for when I don't want to go sockless in them, as they don't show up at all, adding a lot of comfort to sometimes uncomfortable canvas shoes and still giving me that no-sock look and ability to show off my beautiful ankles that I'm looking for. I've never had any trouble with them slipping off my heel or anything despite how small they look, as they seem to stretch and stay on my foot perfectly. I wear a size 1 shoes and these fit perfectly, and stay on even when I'm not wearing shoes and walking around the house. They seem to do a great job of cutting down on odor and sweat as well!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. If you see I gave something 5 stars after buying it at a discount it's because I did my research into the product before buying it and hoped to find it worthy of a five-star rating, but I will still give a poor rating to something I find disappointing. For me even if I received something at a discount I review it as though I bought it at full price, and my star rating reflects that as well."
5.0,Loved these for my grand daughter and very comfy
5.0,"Bought these for my husband. He loves the variety of styles and colors. These are soft l, flexible and stylish. We will be ordering more!"
5.0,Would buy if again.

5.0,Kinda favor the designer glasses 😏
5.0,I love the size. I bought for a friend and every time I see her wear it it brings a smile to my face!  Hardy pen well made.
5.0,I was apprehensive but loved the print with pockets.  Much better than expected.  LOVE THEM.
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my niece and finally got to see her in it today, it draped beautifully and she absolutely loved it.  The nice piecing around the torso just under the bust was very flattering, and even at 6' tall, the dress came to her ankles.  Lovely color, too!  Sort of a cross between cranberry and purple.  Overall, very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,Took way long to arrive but looks just like the picture. I don't find that it looks so cheap as other reviews have said but it is quite delicate. I thought it was really cute. I got at it as a gift for someone and she loved it.
5.0,Absolutely perfect fit and color and fabric. Loved it so much I bought it in red as well
5.0,Shipped nicely - not flattened out.
5.0,"Great item and excellent customer service.  I am constantly given compliments on these earrings whenever I wear them! Also, I can wear them often because they go with everything from casual to dressy."
5.0,"So nice & stretchy, warm & soft"
5.0,Quite adorable
5.0,"This is a beautiful blouse. It hangs nicely, and I love the sleeves.<br />You can let the sleeves down or use the attachment on it to gave them slid up.<br />The back is a bit longer, and looks great against jeans.<br /><br />It's a beautiful design, the v neck isn't a super open top, which I love. It just looks great on.<br />I'd recommend it.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided to review."
5.0,These are so great!
5.0,Suffer from diabetes and this shoes are very comfortable to my feet
5.0,But have to return item
5.0,good product fast shipping thank you . AAA+++
5.0,"This is the little woman here. This robe was bought for me as a surprise gifty. It arrived yesterday evening(Sunday). This robe is AMAZEBALLS. It is soft and snuggly and cushy and the hood .... omigosh! the hood! LOVE IT! It's like I'm a warm and brightly colored Jedi . The hood is awesome! The pockets are big and square and deep..half of my cat fits in there! The tie is not too long,which is great. It's long enough to tie,but not so long afterwards that the cat has a field day with it. I'm 5 ft. tall,138-ish lbs and this robe falls to my ankles,if that helps any. The color is bright and fun and exactly as pictured. Omigosh the color is perfect! Can I say again how absolutely soft and squishy and fuzzy warm awesome this robe is? Doubly awesome because it was a very thoughtful surprise! I want to live in it,and I probably will this winter."
5.0,Excellent product. Very spacious and solidly built. You can a LOT of stuff in the bag!
5.0,"Buy it,you'll not regret"
5.0,Design is so cool and doesnt stretch out or break or  leak
5.0,"LOVED The product. This top<br />fits perfectly.  Many friends have asked where I got it. They, as I, were amazed at the reasonable price. Buy it."
5.0,"It was so nice to find dangly earrings for us women who dont have pierced ears. these were quickly my favorite earrings. I have scar tissue on my ears from getting my ears pierced years ago and cannot normally wear any clip ons very long. I wear these for several hours without them bothering me.my only suggestion is to make the chains slightly longer maybe 3/4 inch longer. but they are just beautiful. well made, dont hesitate to order them!"
5.0,Purchased as a gift for my husband. He loved it. BEST gift and great price
5.0,Beautiful dress! Looked lovely for a not too formal homecoming dance.
5.0,"It does run a little small, order a size up like I did and it will be perfect. Its awesome!"
5.0,So comfortable & flattering.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:a8d6dc02136c30682184c9a9a452655d]] These are cute and lightweight sunglasses in the classic aviator style. They were packaged carefully to prevent any scratches during transport and delivery. Includes a cleaning swatch and cloth storage case, too!"
5.0,"I wear full orthotics, and these are perfect walking shoes for me.  I've tried half-a-dozen other similar shoes, but none were as comfortable."
5.0,Love my new watch.  Works great and looks very stylish.<br />I am pleased with my purchase.
5.0,My 12 year old loves these. He says they are super comfortable and aren’t too tight through center seams. Provide a little longer coverage on the legs than typical boxer briefs which is great for under sports uniforms.
5.0,Identical to the original.
5.0,"My adult grand was looking for a new wallet. She saw this one. Since it was a ""novelty"" design, I figured it would be cute, but low quality.  Against my judgement, I ordered it as for a gift for her.  The wallet is perfect.  It is not only beautiful and well-designed, it is also well-made.  In fact, it is better than Coach she had been carrying... and at a third of the cost. I am going to order an extra one and put it away for the next time she needs a new wallet."
5.0,"Great sweater, true to size."
5.0,Great value what I wanred
5.0,Package arrived on time and was in good condition. I wore this hunting in 19 degree weather as a inner layer with a camo jacket. Helped me keep nice and warm and is very comfortable. Probably going to order another as this one was so nice.
5.0,Nice for the price. My blog theme is &#34;Anchored in Hope&#34; so I love everything with anchors and hope.<br />BarbaraAnnRepan.com
5.0,This is definitely a fancy glasses. I bought it for my mom and she loves it. Easy to wear.
5.0,Love the idea; I can get the same purse I have been using for 3 years but different color.
5.0,I have been wearing the same pair for a few months now and they are still in good shape.
5.0,One of the best wallets I've ever owned.
5.0,I love this hat! The color is great and is easily adjustable to fit just right.
5.0,I love my sunglasses! Can't so wrong with the price!
5.0,I just received my order  on yesterday and they are lovely and look exactly like the picture!!! they even came with a beautiful gift box!!! I was so impressed that I ordered 3 more to give out as gifts!!! they even came really fast way before the actual date that is said!!!!
5.0,My son LOVES this so much he asked to order one for his bff.  JoJo items aren’t easy to find...  this was a huge hit and he’s worn it multiple times. It’s held up to multiple washings (he’s 13 so it gets worn!).  I was concerned about the white but it really does clean well.
5.0,I love this hat is went well with what I was wearing and it was very comfortable
5.0,"in love with these bands, very good product, they look wonderful, I would buy them again, you can combine them for every occasion they are very comfortable"
5.0,"The length of the wrist strap was not long like the other products.  It could have been a little better for my wrist as it was slightly longer than what I wanted, but it definitely works compared to the other brands I ordered.  The color has quality.  It does not seem dull.  It is a strap that I would wear with casual clothing as well as business attire.  I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,Just awesome pants. Fire safe too.
5.0,"Fits perfectly, feel smoother than expected, greater than what it looks"
5.0,"My daughter loves these little shorts for wearing to bed.<br />They pair well with a tank or t-shirt of any kind and are both comfortable and cute.  The lace around the edges, drawstring to tighten, and cute print make these shorts winners in a teens eyes!"
5.0,Gave one to my mother! We both love them! Lots of compliments!!
5.0,I love this shirt doesn't cling and comfortable
5.0,"I love it. I was looking for a simple, inexpensive gift for an after school teacher. It's perfect and is clearly durable."
5.0,Very very beautiful! Shines and the color is really nice!
5.0,I was very happy with the quick delivery. I'm very happy with the way the glasses fit over my prescription glasses.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter in law. She has two sons and is very protective of them. It suits her perfectly. She loves it and wears it proudly. It is a very pretty necklace.
5.0,Nice material at a nice price!<br />Well worth the money!
5.0,"Perfect, perfect, perfect. Love these. Need more!"
5.0,Had this sent to my bestie for her birthday.  She absolutely loves it. So glad to brighten her day because she deserves the best on her bday!! Definitely recommend.  10/10
5.0,"Super cute, I was anticipating it to fit smaller but it is pretty standard American sizing. Super cute, though if you are larger chested the material does get a bit thinned with any stretching. Love it!"
5.0,Can’t believe they were so affordable; they look expensive!
5.0,"I didn't know what to expect but there quality of the denim is great and the for us just right, as pictured. I have a 28 inch waist and ordered a medium."
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my die hard Ravens fan. He LOVES it!! And gets lots of compliments on it. Dont think it really &#34;does&#34; anything to help him to be less stiff, but as a &#34;jewelry&#34; piece its perfect. Suggest it for a male, too thick for a woman in my opinion,"
5.0,"Such a Good quality , super soft and comfortable. ❤️😊"
5.0,"Loved the shawl, was well made, wore it to a wedding."
5.0,Love it!  Very pretty ring
5.0,Can wear for casual or dress it up with accessories.
5.0,Great for the last months of pregnancy
5.0,"I ordered the light flowered blouse. It has nice silky material and doesn't cling to your bottom ! I'm short 5'2 and hanging around 210 lbs.  Seriously, how the heck does that weight gain happen?? Anyway, I've gone up to size 3X and that is what I ordered. It was a little small. Next time I'll order the bigger size. Unless I lose 10 - 15 lbs.  :) LOL.... I hope this is helpful.  Go ahead and buy it, you really will be glad you did!!"
5.0,"Worked great in the dark for my son on Halloween night. And, delivery time was perfect!"
5.0,"Amazing product, Brand and mission!!! - need to highlight the RECYCLED fabrics and MADE IN THE USA in the description ."
5.0,"As expected, these shorts are terrific"
5.0,This is a beautiful rosary for the price.  I'm giving one to my daughter and keeping one for myself as gifts for our RCIA graduation this Easter.
5.0,"Because of the great prices, I had to get this to match the earrings. Love it so much. Nice sturdy chain, I am impressed. I have purchased several items from them and am very pleased with all of them."
5.0,This top is beautiful. It was a tiny bit big for me but I'm not sure the next size down would have fit.
5.0,My daughter-in-law loved the dress. It fit her perfectly.
5.0,"Got this to put over my hair when I have it in rollers or other type of hair curling accessories, it’s very soft, stretchy & comfortable to wear all day, it’s very long too. Definitely recommend this, especially if you have longer or thicker hair, this should cover it fully."
5.0,The fit was perfect for me. The lace up back is also really helpful. It allows you to adjust the fit to your body. It's also very slimming in the waist.
5.0,Adorable got my daughter and niece
5.0,Love it nice and smooth
5.0,my dad had one for 70 years It was time for a new onefor his son.
5.0,These are so cute inexpensive shoes for my 8 month old- they’re good quality looking cheap shoes if that makes sense. Not made for supporting but for sporting. My son isn’t walking yet so he wears these to complete outfit and cover feet. We have more support type shoes for him that we also put on him when he’s more active on floor.
5.0,Very well made.  He loved the personal touch.
5.0,I’m super happy with the material and how it fits. Deep pockets. I will most likely buy another pair.
5.0,Didn't like when you sit material was easy to wrinkles but it fit well
5.0,"I love it, I've gotten so many compliments on it."
5.0,You get a decent amount of sturdy keys in various shades of gold. There’s multiple different designs of keys in the set. Very vintage and some are shinier/more tarnished. Great variety and extremely cute!
5.0,[] []
5.0,"Feels very comfortable, I followed the recommendation to size up, so, I went two sizes up - perfect fit.  The zipper is ok,  I thought it was very lightweight, i'll have to be gentle with using the zipper.  I have other brands they are all similar.  Could not pass up on the price!."
5.0,A GIFT... NICE SHIRTS
5.0,Comfortable material. Fit as expected
5.0,This bra is so unbelievably comfortable! I have no issues wearing it all night or all day while lounging around the house. It has some light padding that can be removed and I find that it provides enough support and coverage that I feel totally comfortable wearing it out. It has beautiful lace which makes me feel sexy. I normally wear a 36 B and I ordered a medium in this bra. It fits perfectly and is just how I would expect. Little tip... if you are like me and you tend to leak through breast pads in the early stages of breastfeeding you can double up on the pads worth this bra. Remove the light padding and replace with a washable pair of breast pads. Once you put the bra on you can place another pair of pads against your breasts. I feel like this makes me feel more confident that I won't leak through. *I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. All views and opinions expressed in this review are my own.
5.0,I frankly had no idea what to expect. Allegra dresses have had reviews ranging the full spectrum. I mainly bought this dress to try Allegra out for myself & the super cute print. It turned out to be surprisingly good buy! The print is super cute in person as well. The neckline is different than the the usual rounds or Vs which is great for WFH scenarios. The dress would actually hold up pretty well to being dressed up for any occasions & worn to office itself when things get back to normal. So this buy has been chalked up to money well-spent!
5.0,Great material and it looks exactly how is was described.  Love it!!!
5.0,"My son's grandma loved this. Super pretty. Was a little big, but she has really smalls wrists"
5.0,Wish it was a little longer but am very happy with it!
5.0,There so comfortable
5.0,Great skirt !! Fast ship!!
5.0,I loved this suit for my oldest daughter! The colors are beautiful and the tank goes all the way to the pant line. I would recommend this.
5.0,Love this bracelet. Its beautiful. Clasp is really hard to close by yourself but that's because it's not magnetic any longer. Great value!!
5.0,Love this ring thank you so much
5.0,They work great.  They're are comfortable and block out a lot of sound while my son plays drums.  Love that they have their own case.
5.0,Love Stance socks and these!!
5.0,Color and quality. Gift boxed!!<br />Bigger than expected.
5.0,"At first I found these clamps too painful! In fairness that's what they were designed for, so I can't complain. They do what they're designed to do. I had a thought to apply the clamps and then employ a vibrator to the genitals. I almost couldn't feel the clamps! One sensation can cancel out another. So I am pleased that this item won't end up in the dark in a drawer."
5.0,Very cute! will hand from my car mirror.
5.0,I would recommend people to buy this item.
5.0,"Loved these glasses. Didn’t want to spend a lot but needed for a trip to Disney. They were light so didn’t slide off my nose in the heat. They had just the right amount of dark for the sun and didn’t have to remove when reading. Great case , great glasses and I didnt lose them which always happens to me on a trip. So glad I purchased!"
5.0,"Measure your nose! These aren't for people with big or small noses! These are for people whose nose measures about 8mm (or 5/16&#34;) from piercing to edge of nostril. That's what that measurement is there for... Use it.<br /><br />On to my review... These are great! The measurements are accurate (I used a cm tape measure) and they only took 10 days to get to me! That's really fast for China to the US. Projected arrival was supposed to be another 2-4 weeks so I'm really impressed with the shipping.<br /><br />Another thing I'm impressed with is the color of the gold mix/aurora hoops. Usually these end up being just an ombre of two colors or some kind of gold fade, but these are a good mix of colors! And with a set, I'm surprised both actually match!"
5.0,"I really love ear pcs. They work very well on my work safety glasses! I would be interested in seeing what else is out there to help make my glasses stay put, but these work very well! Very good price too!"
5.0,"I love the fabric, the feel, the color."
5.0,"Super cute, and just a nice, light summer scarf!"
5.0,This is the second set I’ve bought. The first one lasted about 2 years and I was REALLY hard on mine. This time I bought a set for me and my husband. I will probably never buy any other kind of keychain.
5.0,"When this bag first came I was a bit disappointed because it didn't look like it would hold much.  I was wrong!  It held a lot more that I thought it possibly could.  I flew three different airlines and four different types of planes.  In one plane, it was a very tight fit under the seat but fit easily under that seats of the other three planes.  It was easy to roll but also easy to carry.  I am glad I purchased it."
5.0,I like this well enough. Would have been nice to have a picture or instructions on how they should work.
5.0,"Great quality, fair price, can’t wait to put this on my jacket!"
5.0,My fiance got this for himself and it matches so many of his shoes. Looks great with his blue tuxedo and is true to size.
5.0,"I really like small earrings and this pair is ideal!! This is my second order of these because I have more than one piercing, which is another reason why I prefer small earrings.  This seller has the pair priced reasonably and they ship very quickly. I am very pleased. Thanks!"
5.0,This wig was absolutely perfect!!!! It styled wonderfully and for the price there is alot of hair in this product.
5.0,"Love this shirt! Nice fabric, it's not heavy, and the cut, and colors are flattering with a skinny jean."
5.0,I loved the shirt.
5.0,Loved this look.  Too cute
5.0,"Excellent bag, nice leather, well made, good price, perfect for what I was looking for which was not too big, can be used as a daily bag but fit everything."
5.0,"I have a 2ft circumference head. I wear about a size 8, or 8 1/4 fitted hat. These glasses are very comfortable and look good on my face."
5.0,"True to size ,tuff.<br />I bought it for my boyfriend who is a tow truck driver, who is caught in all kinds of weather and situations  that can be very dangerous  and challenging.  He needed  something that could keep him dry. Keep him visible  to drivers in the dark in and in bad  weather, this did that and stood up to the challenges of moving vehicles  that were in serious accidents  with lots of damage that you get snagged on moving them around hooking up to and clearing them from road ways."
5.0,GREAT FIT!  I really like the texture and feel of this product. Perfect fit and style.
5.0,Love it just what I needed goes with just about Everything!!!!!!
5.0,Soft and super cute! Fits my daughter well at 7 months.
5.0,"My 5 year old does not have the best coordination.  These sandals are a game changer for us! The material is very durable,  and holds up quite well. We did a day at the zoo,  and with all his jumping around, kneeling and walking,  the sandals stayed in place. He said they were comfortable and he liked them alot better than his other sandals he has. They were also easy for him to get on and off,  and the straps stayed nicely in place. These are well worth the buy!"
5.0,I wear them around the house all day long and love them.
5.0,"Really nice, thick, soft, warm sweatshirts. They are very nicely made, nice material and true to size. The colors being so neutral are great too because they go with everything 5 stars"
5.0,Bogs are awesome!
5.0,Super soft love this brand my boyfriend loves it
5.0,"AWESOME BUY FOR AN ACTIVE LITTLE MAN. I have been through 3 sets of lenses due to chewing, rough play, and other shenanigans, and the frames stayed intact. If you got an active little one these frames are invaluably tough."
5.0,Love the body chains. Takes any outfit and adds another level of beauty and interest. Easy to put on and comfortable to wear. Good price.
5.0,It was cute but to small I gave it to her mother
5.0,"The cover up fit as expected. It was a bit more flowing than it looked, which is good because wearing a swimsuit underneath you don't want it to be tight. My daughter actually thought it was a dress."
5.0,This was sent to my daughter in Europe.  She loves it.
5.0,Good fit. It looks good & he loves it.
5.0,This shirt is so cute and the fit is perfect!! I'm almost 200lbs and this shirt is super flattery.
5.0,"Very high quality looking leather, easy to install and fits perfectly."
5.0,I received this watch in the mail today and OMG! It is gorgeous the diamonds sparkle like a million dollars!
5.0,W ex are very pleased with this product. We also bought it in black to give away as a birthday present. Product did not disappoint!
5.0,"I actually purchase this to sleep in, it was tee shirt fabric and sleeveless for summer.  However, when I got it I liked how it fit and will where it for very casual functions.  Pockets tend to add bulk at the hips, but there's a lot of ""sway"" in that area."
5.0,Perfect!! We bought the diamond border from amazon and perfect Bling touch! Class 2018!
5.0,"I love this bracelet.  Unfortunately it is very hard to get on and off by myself so I often left it on through showers and workouts and it wore out quickly.  I would've taken it off more often but didn't cause it was so hard to get back on.  Regardless, super cute and I will probably buy another one soon since mine is toast.  Just like any jewelry, you have to take care of it for it to last."
5.0,"Great quality,pricing"
5.0,Its stylish and very warm. Recommend.
5.0,100% love them!! I didn't have the highest hope for these but they really delivered on quality and fast shipping. The picture is clear and they have some substantial weight to them.
5.0,"Great socks, perfect fit."
5.0,"A little pricey at $25, but an extremely cute sweater and fits my girl elf on the shelf perfectly. Easy to put on, and probably the cutest sweater on the market (I looked at several!). She will wear it for years to come so overall I’m very happy with my purchase."
5.0,Love this pants. Perfect for doing yoga.
5.0,"A very nice casual top. I wore it over a Patty Boutiqu “high Low” turtle neck, which was cut high-low in the same way as this shirt and it looked great under it. I had bought the London Fly Perz914FLY bootines in the color ‘Petrol Ranch’ which is a very odd dark bluey-green color, and is bery hard to match. I got this shirt to go with them and the color matched perfectly. It is a nice dark blue/green, and in the ‘waffles of the design are little black squares. It is soft and comfortable. I will say the material is thin. You can see in one photo the way the ‘fold’ of one side of the short under the other shows as a li e diagonally by my breast. But I like the shirt anyway. Also, simce it is fairly thin material. I live in upstate NY and it is very cold in the winter here. So I definitely had to wear the Patty Boutique turtle neck under this one to be warm enough. But if you live in a warmer state it might be just eight for winter as is. For reference: I am 5’7” and 150 pounds, and wear a size 8 or 10 depending in the brand. I got the size small because I hate super baggy clothes. If you want more baggy at my body size then I’d say go with the medium. I will report back after I have washed and worn it a few times to share how the after care goes."
5.0,Love this! I am a bigger guy and it still fits me on the last two notches. The case for the watch fits perfect. The material seems sturdy.
5.0,Rating given by my 7 year old son...<br /><br />I love the wallet so much!  I have a lot of money inside it.
5.0,"Beautiful packaging and amazing quality necklace. The message was very meaningful and added sentimental value to the necklace, I love it!"
5.0,"Excellent little things... purchased for our son so he'd have something to fidget with quietly at a friend's wedding. His buddy got the compass links, so they had a great time. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase these for a grown man, they are very well made and lovely."
5.0,Loved them!! Wish I could have know how many of each.
5.0,"I'm 6'4 almost 300 athletic build, usually wear xxl but I was smart and paid attention to other reviews and ordered one size up.  The 3x fits well and is long enough. Nice all-around sweatshirt."
5.0,I like material and design
5.0,Just what I wanted!  Love the quality of the bag plus the art work!!  It's really awesome!!
5.0,I have had Amazon prime for 2 years and never wrote any reviews but I just had to for this. I have had a really bad back since 2003. And yes I don't  want to admit it but my age has a lot to do with it too. I still work as hard as I possibly can but one of the hardest things I do everyday is put my ems work boots on. I bought one to see if it will help and it's so amazing how much easier it was. I am buying a second one to keep at work. The reason I bought such a heave gauge one was because I worried I would bend or break. I read some reviews on this because I wanted to make sure it was worth the money and its worth more. My foot just slides right into it. Ome reviews complain buy I think it's more of the ones that will never be happy with anything. I wish I would have thought of this sooner. It's late December and I think this is the best thing. I buy about 10 to 20 things a month on Amazon. I buy everything on here and like I said I have never wrote a review. I am going to think about who I know that might need one and show them. I am almost never this impressed with something. This could be the best thing you could buy for someone. It's so thick it could be used for protection or to keep your kids in line. Ok just kidding I would use a bat for protection.  Lol.
5.0,Great dress and fits accurate to description. Waste is a little larger then expected but adding a belt will make it all come together. Material is think enough not to show lines and lay nicely.
5.0,"Great colors and pattern, soft material, and the best fit I could’ve asked for. Perfect loose long pants. Yeah, they’re a little boho, and looks beautiful on me. They are comfortable and loose enough for lounge wear or yoga, and stylish enough to wear anywhere!"
5.0,Really pretty light purple stones.
5.0,the dress is gorgeous on. You won't think so when you see it in the package but on it's a killer. The cut is very narrow and if you have hips your movements will be very limited even with the long split. I reordered a large and will take in any place that may be loose. I'd rather be able to walk and sit.
5.0,Absolutely no regrets it’s really great quality and I know it will last me for a very long time. I’m happy with my purchase.
5.0,This is such a cute dress ! The print is perfectly matched to the characters on the show and my 2yo who wears 4T fits her 5T size well with room to grow
5.0,Love this top. Got a lot of compliments!
5.0,Fit a little loosely but I love these!
5.0,This company makes great glasses. These glasses are high quality readers with a very comfortable frame. I only buy from this company and was glad to see Amazon carried them
5.0,How did I ever pack for a vacation without these things? Perfect sizes and they hold so much more than you can imagine! Keeps things neat and tidy and pretty wrinkle free! No more rummaging through my luggage! Nice quality too!
5.0,I bought it for a Halloween Egyptian costume. It fits but I’d have preferred an adjustable length between the ring and wrist. Nevertheless it looks good.
5.0,i loved how easy it was  for me after my shoulder surgery two weeks ago. I have two of these and one different style.
5.0,"Beautiful dress, runs small"
5.0,Great will buy again they fit perfectly will not ride up washes very good will not loose their shape super
5.0,Good price. Seems to be great quality. Fit perfectly. Good seller communication.
5.0,Beautifull key
5.0,"This dress feels  heavy and well made...I love that!  I would advise, like many reviews, to size up one. I normally wear a medium in dresses (5'7&#34;, 160lbs) and the large fits me perfect.  The BONUS: It looks great for those with a &#34;mom belly&#34;!!  I totally covers it and the 3 decorative trim lines hits at the waist making you look slim. There are 2 small pleats below that cover the &#34;mom belly&#34; perfectly!  I would also add that in my opinion, it's more of a navy blue than a purple. IT's VERY flattering!"
5.0,It turned out to be prettier than I thought it would. Also came in a gift box with a small matching bag.
5.0,So cute! Great quality for price.
5.0,I love love these pants. I was kind of skeptical about buying jeans online because they aren't always whats advertised. That's the only risk about buying online but I read the reviews and I went for it. I'm Happy​ I did these jeans are high waisted and stretchy.
5.0,"I love the color, the size and material of this watch. I haven't proved the water resistance, but it is a nice casual watch."
5.0,These are the first low cut socks that I have found that remain comfortable all day. They stay in place without having to readjust numerous times throughout the day. They must be line dried as there is a small insert in the heel which could melt under high heat.
5.0,Bought for my wife she liked fit so it  must be good happy wife happy life
5.0,"Love these glasses, they came with a bag for the glasses and are exactly as described"
5.0,This shirt was better than expected! It’s stretchy otherwise it might have been too small. It even smelled good! The quality was very good!
5.0,Love it!  I thought it was going to be smaller but it was perfect. Id say closer to a med size handbag. I read a couple reviews where their purse smelled like cow hide. Mine did not. It was fine.  Its a keeper!  I would recommend to anyone.
5.0,I absolutely love pathfinder watches. I bought this one for my son. It was amazing. I think I might get one for myself
5.0,"So cute, but a little small.  Was sad to send back!"
5.0,It was a birthday gift
5.0,The royal blue color is so striking. I love being able to carry all of my essentials without lugging around a big bag. The gold hardware looks beautiful against the bright blue. You can carry this as a clutch or add the strap for a wristlet. The vegan leather feels so smooth too. *I was gifted this item for my honest opinion
5.0,My daughter loved opening these on Christmas Eve and teenagers are so hard to please!! This was a huge win!! Soft and comfy she still lounges around the house in them they are her favorite pjs!
5.0,"Perfect size, perfect weight. Good quality. I wear it on a black satin choker and have received many compliments."
5.0,Beautiful!! The clip keeps falling off and I gotta put it back on but aside from that it’s lovely!!
5.0,It was exactly what l wanted for my niece!  Vibrant colors!!!!
5.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, THIS DRESS SOFT STRETCHY MATERIAL, ORDERED A MEDIUM I'm 54 148lbs fits perfect I would say true to size."
5.0,"These are more durable than the $20 ones I got at REI (had toe holes after 4 months). I still use them and they are still intact even to this day (12 hours shifts, thrice per week for the past however many years).<br /><br />It’s 2020... still using them, still intact."
5.0,"Cute and as described. Cheaper material, but looks good and worth the price"
5.0,excellent and practical
5.0,great for my anime costume and the bell is so cute!
5.0,replaced the picture folder in my old wallet.  this worked perfect.
5.0,Bought as a gift - and she loved it!
5.0,"I'm a big fan of these glasses. They are super light weight; to the point where i forget that I'm even wearing them. The lens is very yellow at first but after a few seconds it just makes things look more vibrant, especially nature. They also have a gradient to them so the top of the lens is darker which is where most of the sunshine is coming from. They are much more affordable than most glasses, I suggest you give them a try"
5.0,"It's so beautiful! I love it so much!<br />It looks very minimal, great quality.<br />You can wear it on it's own or layer it with other neclaces.<br />It doesn't look cheap!"
5.0,"Super comfy, came quickly with Prime. Wearable for everyday or church."
5.0,"The color is as pictured and the fabric is soft. Fits loosely around the tummy; not quite flowy but roomy. The V-neck is not really cleavage-y, but it is low. I can see this shirt getting worn constantly because it is really comfortable.<br />Size: Medium<br />Height: 5'1<br />Weight: ~120 pounds with a mum tum"

5.0,Great shoes!! Did my kid well for his football season.
5.0,Very nice! I gave this as a gift and the recipient loved it.  Sturdy and well made.
5.0,"I love these bands. My biggest qualm with Apple Watch bands is the discomfort after hand washing - especially because of how often I wash my hands. I love being able to push the band up my wrist a bit to keep the band from getting wet. The adjustment buckle remains secure and never needs readjusting. I also really love that the buckles are rose gold and match my watch face! These are soft, work well with a casual wear or with active wear and the are so many color options. I’ve purchased 2 sets of these and my spouse has purchased a large pack too! Get them!"

5.0,"Very nice, she will know I love her"
5.0,"I had an older version of this Archade belt and used it primarily for my snowboard pants.  It flexes, stays comfortably snug, and lightweight.  This belt can be kept on while going through TSA check point because its non metallic.  So great for travelling.  That older version was 1-1/2"" wide.  It has difficulty sliding through the loops in some of my trousers.<br />Now since I'm trimming down from 32 waist to 29, I acquired the youth version.  With the belt near its end there is no cutting of excess length.  This belt is now 1-1/4"" wide so it slides through all of my trousers smoothly.  There is a light weight band that holds the tag end.  Efficient, lightweight.  I'm considering acquiring another.  For me this is the best belt for my everyday use and travelling."
5.0,item is great fit and good price quality is good would recommend
5.0,"Beyond awesome, the hubby is gonna love it"

5.0,"Bought this after buying a bathrobe from the same company and when I saw this was made of the same material and priced reasonably I thought can't go wrong here. I was thrilled. Got the 1X-2X because I thought the length would be better. I am 5'9"", 135 lbs. And it is perfect the way I wanted. Almost to the floor, super sized and my go to comfy cozy for watching TV in the evening.  Bought another right away, so got the Peruvian and Aztec. Well worth the money, though I wouldn't wear it to Walmart like the description, but that's me."
5.0,Replaced a much-loved duplicate in another color. Everything a fleece jacket should be!
5.0,I wanted sun readers that I could take on a very active vacation and I wanted them to be inexpensive and flexible. These worked well and came with a nice case. Only drawback was that I thought I ordered polarized and these were not but that was probably my mistake.
5.0,"These little curly silicone bands are exactly what I wanted. They come in various thicknesses and twist on. It took me a little fingagalling, but once I got the hang of it the size I picked fit great.  Once on they do move a bit, but it's not annoying. They don't get in the way when I'm washing or drying my hands so I don't have to take my rings off before or after. I ordered two packages and am very pleased."
5.0,"Cute Comfortable and stretchy!! Fit nicely when i was 25 weeks, im 30 weeks now my belly is 2ce as big & the dress still fits well."
5.0,1. Size - The size of the necklace itself was good for my girlfriend and the size of the turtle in relation to the whole necklace was also good. Not too big where is looks awkward and not too small where you can't notice it.<br /><br />2. Value - Decent value considering the luster is good and the build quality seems good enough that the necklace will last years as long as it isn't exposed to extreme conditions.<br /><br />Overall - I would recommend this necklace if the person really likes sea turtles or you have a shared memory of sea turtles with the person you are giving it to.
5.0,These reading glasses are everything I was hoping for. I love the large frames. They are well made and sturdy. I personally didn’t find them to be too heavy. The fit was just right for me. I’m very pleased with this purchase!

5.0,"I have a number of mask, but I've fallen in love with this one.  I have a hard time with the regular mask because I feel like I'm suffocating.  This mask has a two speed fan which is awesome.  It uses a charger which comes with the mask.  It has three filters included,  but you can purchase more.  The product is made of a hard material on the outside which can be sanitized.  Great item.  I will buy again."

5.0,These are very nice. Very comfortable and they work well!<br /><br />I have transition glasses.  Anyone that’s had transitions knows that in a vehicle they hardly work at all. I have extreme sensitivity to glare and too much sun light. These actually relieve some much tension in my eyes. Love them so much I got another pair to keep in my wife’s car.

5.0,"I absolutely love this watch! I do everything with it and it's held up for the last couple years. I first got this watch during my engineering courses and needed one to time myself during exams because the clock on the classroom was small and at the back of the room. Having this watch made things so much more efficient! I also chose a digital watch versus analog for efficiency when timing reaction rates during labs. I can't tell you how much I've loved having this watch and since it's inexpensive, I haven't been too worried about scuffing it when working with my hands or leaving it on while doing day-to-day activities. It's seriously one of my greatest tools that have helped me through school and at work!"

5.0,"These are a really nice quality strap for use as replacement or, if you're like me and make your own bags, an easy change out strap.  I will buy again.  I'm even thinking that they may make nice gifts.  I never knew how handy having swappable straps would be."
5.0,Jacket fits great - we went with the 3/4T for a little guy that’s in mostly 3T and it fits well but he has room to grow with it. The material and stitching are great - very nice lining on the inside and buttons are good quality. He is able to run and move in it also so he doesn’t mind having it on!
5.0,"Super cute & comfy cover up.  I’m 5’5 & about 130 lbs and this was long enough on me.  I wore it into a casual beach restaurant for lunch and felt very comfortably covered.  Washes well, just hang to dry.  The black was a bit hot on 95 degree beach days, but it’s a great piece."
5.0,Good quality cute hat
5.0,"It’s a beautiful bracelet, but unfortunately it’s a wee too tight. I prob would be better with a 7.5 or 8. No worries though gave it to my daughter and she loved it. The earrings are lovely and I will enjoy wearing them."
5.0,Great for husband's collection.
5.0,We got this for both our 7 and 5 yr old although the 7 yr old is quickly outgrowing it. It did help us size her correctly and we were able to order her shoes online correctly. Will look into getting the adult version when she outgrows it but should last a while longer for our 5 yr old.
5.0,"I couldn't be more happier with the case. It is big enough for any size glasses, the cleaning cloth is of great quality,  it arrived in a timely matter, and yes I would purchase other items from your cite in the future."

5.0,"I’m ALWAYS cold, and I needed a new jacket. I was perusing other reviews and saw that someone had taken this thing to Iceland in October and was more than comfortable.<br /><br />Naturally I was sold. This thing lives up to the hype.

I borrowed my mother-in-law's brooch for s sparkly accent, but the dress is stunning by itself (this photo doesn't do it justice). Fabric is silk-like, Spanx may be needed. Wink wink. Nobody believed this came from Amazon!"

The waist hits at just the right spot to give you a figure while hiding your tummy. Third, it's also comfortable. The dress is more formal than I expected.

Since I wear rx lenses, I took them to my optometrist to have my rx filled and fitted to the frame. Will keep the wiley x lenses, should I decide to get contacts in the future.  I wore the glasses to mow a five acre parcel which about half is more dirt and weeds, the well form fitting frames hugged my face perfectly keeping all the dirt and debris out of my eyes. Would recommend to anyone."
5.0,"Thin material, love the style because it is different."
5.0,"I'm 5'7"" 140lbs and I have a problem with tight dresses because I have an extra hump on my hips. This dress is phenomenal. Its incredibly professional.  Great quality.

5.0,"Absolutely LOVE these! They are so lightweight, comfortable and I even sleep in them! Very great quality! Will definitely be ordering more!"
5.0,This gown has a very elegant color. I washed it with soapy water for couple of times until the creases are removed. My niece uses the gown a lot except the accessories. It has a perfect length for her but the mid part or the width is too big for her. My niece is tall and thin.  She loves the gown still. I highly recommend. I think the price is really reasonable

5.0,Perfect for my altra shoes. Ran a half marathon in full on sand and had no problem with sand in my shoe. Threw them in the wash after and they look as good as new with Velcro still intact.

Perfect for spring and summer!"
5.0,Very nice quality!  Pretty colors
5.0,"these have been my go-to masks for school and work for the past month now!<br />- not bulky, but enough space for my mouth to open wide without tugging the mask down off of my nose (common problem I’ve encountered)<br />- metal nose-pinch piece hasn’t gotten worn out at all from bending and re-bending<br />- very breathable<br />- very comfortable<br />- machine washable (I recommend air-drying, and they dry pretty quick!)<br />- wrinkle resistant<br />- really normal size! some adjustable masks that I’ve gotten are very big, in hopes of being “one size fits all”. these are quite normally sized, but still adjustable.<br />- ear straps aren’t bulky, and are comfortable"
5.0,"I usually wear a 2 or 4 in button-down shirts from places like J. Crew and Brooks Brothers, and the size large fit perfectly. Sleeves are the right length, and the shirt is tailored-looking but not at all tight. The fabric is fine, better than what I'd expect at that price. It's a really cute casual shirt."
5.0,"Pretty and a very wearable size, even for a younger teen."
5.0,These no show socks stayed in place with 2 different styles of shoes! When I first looked at  them I thought they would be too small. But they fit just fine. The stickiness accepts the heal held the sock in place quite comfortably and the small amount on the ball of the foot kept me from sliding in the shoe itself. Great Find! Must try!
5.0,I use these boots for work. I work as a service plumber. They provide the protection I need. I no longer work construction so I'm not sure how they would hold up for heavy duty work but are great for everyday light work. It does have a steel toe. They are super comfortable!
5.0,"Love this shirt. Fits as expected, is soft and the color is really nice. I had quit a few people comment on it."
5.0,"Shipped fast. Shirt is soft material, feels good to wear. Good quality"
5.0,"I love these sunglasses! They are affordable and so, so cute. They complete my summer look."
5.0,great for renne faire!
5.0,Colors are great!  Only complaint is that it's instructions are to hand wash and hang to dry
5.0,Worked just perfect for my sister-in-laws wedding. I even get to wear it after the wedding as an every day dress. Light weight and very soft.
5.0,I got these for my husband for Fathers day and he loves them! They shipped much faster than the estimated ship date!
5.0,I absolutely love these slippers I bought another pair because they’re so comfortable and cute and I love how fluffy and soft they are the bottom of them is rubber and hard

5.0,Fits great.  I bought XS after reading reviews on size. .  I’m 5’5” and 117 pounds.  Good length for me.  May hem about an inch so I can wear with flats.  Nice floral print.  Want something casual to slip on for patio reading or hanging out.

5.0,Adorable.  My granddaughter loves it.
5.0,"Loved the series, wear this with jeans or shorts. Fits perfectly"
5.0,"I really love wearing this Red Chemise Lace up Lingerie. It comes with the nightie and also the matching thong. It is comfortable to wear,even to sleep in.My favorite thing about this set is the garters are connected to the nightie.They do not detach. I have such a hard time keeping up with those little things that it was almost refreshing to see a piece that had them built in.  I love the black lace around the breast and the open lace up back.These accents make this nightie so sexy and emphasize the perfect places.The black lace hem around the bottom also adds a nice touch.Overall, this is a well made and sexy lingerie set.I love wearing this."
5.0,"I love this, I'll be buying a lot more in different colors."
5.0,Beautiful piece.  Very classy.  Can wear with casual wear or more dressy attire.
5.0,This suit is AMAZING. I’m very picky with bathing suits but I can tell you this one is good quality and the fit is absolutely perfect. I’m 5’4” 115lbs 34B. And it’s cheeky but not too cheeky
5.0,Nice style and very comfortable
5.0,Literally perfect! I was ready for it to be difficult to put in. But it slid right in and closed easily. My piercing is still healing but this jewelry really doesn't get in the way of my stethoscope!

5.0,I love them that is what my husband and I say to each other at 4 times a day thank you
5.0,I like it so much. Special it looks like unlimited universe. Mind unlimited!
5.0,This is a strip of black cloth that has been folded over and stitched. Its long enough to wrap around my head and have some dangley parts left over. This is perfect for keeping hair out of my eyes.
5.0,"Cool design, especially when the light shines through them, great product, great price!"
5.0,Nice fit. just right. lightweight and quick dry.
5.0,A fair deal and fast shipping
5.0,These cute little sneakers got a lot of compliments. However they fit a little big. I am not complaining about that. We just waited to grow into them.
5.0,They are cuter in person and fit as expected. They are sturdy as well.
5.0,I scratched them early on. I’m very hard on things. Can’t see the effects from the scratch.
5.0,"Nice color and fits well.  Check for stains, mine arrived with what appeared to be a shoe print on it.  I was able to take a wet rag and clean it up."
5.0,"Absolutely precious, my Grandbaby looked adorable...best photo shoot ever"
5.0,Beautiful.  Look just like pics.  I loooooove the red gemmed ones.  I wear them often.

5.0,Stylish and classy. I don't usually like rubber wristbands but I do love this watch.
5.0,Excellent! A+.
5.0,"I have fleece tights, and I was looking for something warmer than panty hose, but not as warm as the fleece lined.  These tights are slightly ribbed, and fit very well, with plenty of stretch.  They look great, and are warm enough for 40 degree weather, but not warm enough for 20 degrees."
5.0,I bought a size larger and it fits well. I’m 5’9” and I can wear this with flats. It has many layer of fabric  so it’s not see-through nor does it look cheap. Comes with  A detachable black belt as shown in photos
5.0,"This vest is beautiful,  fits great and material stretches, will order different colors"
5.0,"very nice, is exactly as it looks."
5.0,They are great. Could have a little more color to them... but they will work.
5.0,"I really like the snowman onesie and is made very well, however when I received it I noticed the tag reflected the price to be $5 less than what I purchased it for. If I can buy these items in store it would be more cost effective."
5.0,"I replaced my previous wallet, because credit cards could easily fall out.  This is a trifold, which helps that problem.  There are also plenty of pockets, two bill holders, and it is RFID-protected as well.  A good choice for someone with a lot of cards to carry in his wallet."
5.0,Perfect when walking the dogs in the dark
5.0,"Thick enough to go out to the store in...very comfy....I am 5""6"", 138lbs. I like my pants loose so I bought large. And they are even  long enough...I bought a second pair."
5.0,super comodas
5.0,I simply love it. Nice sunglasses at an affordable price.  Thumbs up! 👍
5.0,Genuine high quality slim wallet.
5.0,Perfect mother's day gift.  My wife loved a pair of earrings she had with a leverback.  They were old and not as comfortable as when new.  These new earrings from LaRegis are amazing.  She loves the simple design and forgets she has them on - they are so lite and comfortable.  The leverback is perfect design and well made.  And made in USA.<br /><br />We will be buying more from LaRegis.  Great and beautiful product!!
5.0,"I love this company rings. This is my second ring from them, and it absolutely worth every single penny. The first one I bought I wear it almost every day and it still is beautiful and gold and shiny."
5.0,Best mask to wear to allow fresh air flow. Pretty and can be used for costumes as well.
5.0,I loved it theyre so comfortable and cute and stylish
5.0,Great product.  Very lightweight and very attractive.. people are always complementing me.. looks modern but it is not aggressive looking..love it. nicely made-good quality and is more comfortable than my wire frames.
5.0,Very cute ear rings and light weight!  Love them
5.0,Fits perfectly with just enough flow without being too clingy to your frame. The pink color is a bit off though . I bought the pink thinking it was more of a mauve but is a hot neon pink.  Still a great dress and I’m going back for it in black.
5.0,Its a dreamy gown. Perfect for my daughters wedding. I love it!
5.0,I was happy that this hat fitted so well. It is well made & I would recommend it.
5.0,Me encantó mi mandil de snoopy¡¡
5.0,"They are great, especially for the price! Love them."
5.0,"The purse is super beautiful and has a conservative display, however, it makes a fashion statement.  I am a purse connosseiur and love to mix and match my clothes with a variety of items.  Initially I wanted a red purse, after ordering multiple items, I was not satisfied with them, thus, this purse fit the bill as it represented all the colors I wear.  For the fashionista at heart, you will not be disappointed with this purse."
5.0,Great fit. Zero issues during my most recent ironman event.
5.0,Came in early and exactly like the pictures
5.0,"I bought this watch for my mom, a senior lady and she loves it. It is comfortable for her (the plastic does not pinch her), it is easy for her to see, and attractive. She says it is far better than the everyday watch it replaced.  And the price was great. Highly recommended."
5.0,"really good quality, fits well, stays put! really happy I bought this"

5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my brother, he loved it!"
5.0,"This beautiful necklace is outlined in tiny crystal diamonds.  I purchased all my jewlry from QIYUNZ; please don't let the price fool you, this is good jewelry from China.  I highly recommend this &#34;chunky&#34; beautifully twisted (and long in length) necklace.  Join PRIME and get your order super face; this was due to arrive late April/middle May, but with PRIME, I ordered two weeks ago and got my orders yesterday (4/7/16)."
5.0,showstopper! love my hat.
5.0,Works beautifully with little effort.
5.0,This hat was all the rave at a throwback party.
5.0,"Love the blue hue, but the date! You need X-ray vision to see it! Even my children, with far better eyes than mine, can barely see it (or not see it at all). Otherwise, it works well and looks lovely!"
5.0,"I got my husband these because he has lost probably 20 readers in the last 2 years and I usually don’t know to order more until he has only a broken pair from the 6 pack I ordered only 6 months ago. He’s blue collar and jack of all trades so he’ll wear the readers to see small writing or tiny acres or intricate wiring assemblies which means his hands are busy and need to be free quickly when he needs his regular eyesight again under a sink or car or in a poorly lit closet and tends to set them down in places where heavy equipment or feet tend to land. It’s it’s not broken it’s forgotten in a home, business or parking lot who knows schist to name a few and to busy to hunt down so he grabs a new pair. The SECOND he slid these on this first pair from a fresh pack of six, he couldn’t believe what a game changer these would be to his ability to see all things big and small. He said 3 times in the following hour he took them off and just let them drop without fully appreciating their easily accessible new location until he pulled himself out from under the car and realized they were still on his chest. So comfortable and lightweight he didn’t notice them. Game changer and money saver all rolled into one! Not to mention this mama and wife’s sanity and stress reducer."
5.0,"These are great bands.  They feel nice on the wrist and although the connections are plastic, they do the job nicely.  The Velcro is great.  100% would buy again."
5.0,Fun-design on a soccer ball. Our team name is Fire and this is the perfect ball for our team!
5.0,Love this cute dress. Perfect for spring/summer. The only downside is that it is tight across the chest. Order a size up for larger breasted gals.
5.0,"Purchased these for my wife.  I got them for when we go to the beach, so she can read and not have to look goofy wearing readers with her sunglasses.  She actually wears them while driving as well.  With a tilt of her head she can now read the GPS with no problem."
5.0,It’s adorable! Is there more options of different prints is my only question?
5.0,"Pleased with product. I bought xl. I'm 5'4 and it is slightly pass my ankles. Doesn't wrinkle much, not seethrough, has pockets and side zipper. I will be ordering more."
5.0,They are extremely comfortable and they do not cut into my feet like other new sandals do
5.0,I love the way this tank feels. I do wish I wouldve gotten a size smaller but this will work still
5.0,Loved it fits perfect and it’s very nice great color
5.0,"Great feel, look., and cost."
5.0,"It’s not the same color as the picture, much darker. But I almost like it more that way, it’s more of a gray and brown than a brown and white. Very neutral and soft and will match with a lot. Love it"
5.0,"I saw these (similar) glasses in Saks Fifth Avenue and had to have them but the only ones in Saks had a scratch on them.  My brief bio when it comes to sunglasses...I can't find any and when I do, I buy them and when I get home they look horrible on my face.<br /><br />I found these on Amazon and ordered them thinking they were the exact ones from Saks.  The ear part is actually sturdier than those at Saks.  I absolutely love them.  I wear them all of the time which is not good because I may lose them or scratch them but I don't care... A bit pricey but they are Valentinos and I am worth it and so are YOU!"
5.0,Nice color pink.  Well made.  Bought it because it was made in America.s
5.0,"Loose and super comfy. Holds up well. Lighter colors are a bit too see-through, though."
5.0,It's a sturdy case for my perscription sunglasses
5.0,I wore this for easter and it was perfect!! I am 5'0 and it was the perfect length for church and being around family. Might be too short for someone taller. The amazing quality for the price. Got a million compliments on it. Highly recommend
5.0,"I was really excited to order this purse. Have been wanting to get a new one for awhile but could never find one I loved. I love this one. Great quality and design. It's compact but can hold a lot. I love the otter design, it's very unique and have received complaints on it every where I go. I'm really happy with the purchase."
5.0,"This dress is absolutely adorable! It s so flattering on me and the material is very light weight! The yellow color is always very beautiful! I have always wanted to try a more retro look to spice up my style but all the other dresses like this were too expensive! This was an amazing product, an amazing fit, and an amazing price! I purchased the medium and it fits great! I received a discount in exchange for my honest review!"
5.0,Good readers!
5.0,You won't lose your luggage with these! Nice and big  and wroth the price!
5.0,"Great hat with a great price! Wore this in Prague, Belgium, and Amsterdam in December, my ears and head stayed warm the whole time. I loved that I had some slack with the hat versus having one suction onto your head...fashionable and practical!"
5.0,Nice to new glasses for reading and very affordable
5.0,"Great length and comfortable. It’s a super nice tshirt type hoodie, very durable."
5.0,I love this tank top! It's a great color and fits perfectly. The straps are silky and the built-in shelf bra is snug but not too tight. A perfect top for layering!
5.0,It fit like a glove got it for my babyshower the slit is beautiful it’s has an extra layer for the boobs so no bra was excellent. It was perfect way better then I expected the material is not see through that was what I wanted the most
5.0,Really like this hat.  Fits great.  I even bought a second one.
5.0,Cute baby shoes and the sole is nice and sturdy.price was a steal
5.0,"I saw this on a Facebook boutique and found it less expensive on Amazon.<br />So happy I did!<br />I'm 5'10, 145. The medium fits perfectly. Not form fitting, looks adorable with jeans or leggings.<br />I'll be getting more colors. 😁"
5.0,"This review is for the product titled ""Mortal Kombat Sub-Zero Adult Size Union Suit Costume Polyester Pajamas"". The item arrived in good condition and as described. For 13$ or so it was a fine purchase for a pajama party I attended."
5.0,"I forgot to include in my review how much I love the color! I got the burgundy Chelsea style and they color, style and detailing are wonderful! Excellent boots!"
5.0,"Purchased some new sunglasses on a trip out East this last summer and wanted to protect them from getting scratched up.  Yes, 2 pairs! Keeping them nice.... and I purchased a cover, the black one for my husband, who is notorious for scratching up his lenses.  It's working he's keeping them in the case when not in use!"
5.0,I ABSOLUTELY love this wallet. It was everything i was looking for. It's the perfect  size for me to carry everything I need without the big ole purse all the time.
5.0,Great sun hat surviving in any hot and cool climate. Also good for light rain. Easy to pack and fold.
5.0,Super cute and comfy. Husband loved the colors. Got it for a trip  so will report later how it does.
5.0,"These earrings are exactly as pictured and came with two different backing options.  They did however come from China so they took forever to arrive, but the site made that clear."
5.0,Comfort wear and vivid colors on the jumper
5.0,Great Jersey especially for the price. It is perfect for my son.
5.0,"ten headbands for $15.98 ($16.00) including tax (in my area) & free shipping was well worth the cost, - - even though 2 or 3 colors (such as the orange and the pink) were too bright for my preference, - - (I simply passed along to Goodwill) -- all the others worked out great for me. .. I'm an adult female with average head-size, but some headbands from other sources were too tight fitting, - - but these fit comfortable, just right."
5.0,Beautiful! Comfortable! I love it. I have the one size version and love the beads. Nice conversation piece.
5.0,"These glasses are comfortable, seem to be well-made, and come with a very nice case and cleaning cloth. I've worn them for a few weeks and find them preferable over other sunglasses I own."
5.0,I love all of them. Super happy with this earrings. Totally worth the price.

5.0,Just as described. Fast shipping
5.0,Extremely easy to care for very comfortable
5.0,My black studs showed up a few days earlier than expected. Awesome. They looked amazing...like the real thing. The metal is great and the stone is flawless. I ordered the black stones on black metal and received the black stones on silver metal but they still look so amazing for the low price. This is well worth the price! If you're looking for some reasonably priced earrings that look as amazing as the real thing then you need to order now!
5.0,I am an adult female and these are perfect for me love love love them
5.0,very good price. and the quality is great.

5.0,"look great, good quality, comfortable to wear. Thanks!"
5.0,"I had to exchange size 8 for 10. I am 5'3"" 140lbs, size 8 fit me but was too tight didn't like how it looked like. Hope size 10 will look classier.<br />Update - now that I got the right size I upgraded my review. The skirt is what I was looking for, I am wearing it often, including work dressed up with an appropriate top. Recommend it."
5.0,Good deal. Very handy for shirt pockets.
5.0,"Perfect sweatsuit! Fits perfectly, I bought 3! Need more colors"
5.0,"I usually wear a 7 or 9 in womens jeans… I ordered these in a large in hopes they wouldn’t be too baggy and still not squeeze my waist. I don’t like when shorts squeeze out my muffin top lol…These shorts fit perfect, they’re form fitting around the legs and do not squeeze my waist, yet I won’t need a belt to keep them up. A medium def would’ve fit but I would’ve had the muffin spillage, these are very flattering. I’m 5’4 and about 145lbs. I already ordered another pair in another color!"
5.0,Product arrived a day early and for as expected. We used the shirts during an all day hike in southern Utah; the shirt performed very well for blocking the sun and drying quickly after drops into the Virgin River that runs through the Narrows. Will be a great shirt for future sun blocking use.
5.0,Works as intended so far.
5.0,These gloves were perfect for what I needed them for. Great fit and comfortable
5.0,Just beautiful large an nice pockets
5.0,"Hat looks great, I was concerned with another review stating it was small, but this fits an adult's head just as it should. Arrived quickly & in perfect condition."
5.0,Fits as expected and goes slightly below the knee.<br />Quality cost for the money
5.0,I love this so much. It’s definitely warmer then I thought but it’s so soft and cozy.
5.0,Cotton lining is comfortable
5.0,Outfit was more than I expected
5.0,"Have only been using for a few weeks...<br /><br />My original sticks were worn down and torn a bit.  **These work great**.  Recommend watching a few videos on how to disassemble PS4 controller as there are a few steps that are tricky (initial case disassembly and springs on L/R 2 buttons mostly) to get these in.  It should take about 10-30 minutes if you don't lose a spring or not properly put it back together (some internal connections are very thin and tiny pull/push ribbon connectors)<br /><br />I can't compare to a &#34;new&#34; PS4 controller but due to long term wear and tear on my old sticks these do not appear to be 100% exact replacements for the original/OEM PS4 dual shock controller thumb sticks.  My originals were more &#34;rubbery&#34; and soft which *may* have been from long time use, sweat, etc.  IMHO: All the small differences are improvements. The only noticeable differences I saw were:<br /><br />1. The tops are coated in slightly harder rubber  (the size, color, fit, etc. looked identical.  Not sure about the texture on top as my old ones had worn smooth). The harder rubber is actually a bonus for me as previously I was having issues with my clip-on KontrolFreek Ultra thumb stick extenders popping off.  With the slightly stiffer rubber of these replacement sticks (and with new texture/no wear as a bonus), my extenders stay in place.  The harder rubber (or just the newness?) is not an issue for me when playing (no thumb slippage, etc).<br /><br />2. The &#34;rounded edge&#34; of the top of the stick is stiffer than my worn originals.  This is a bonus when using the KontrolFreek extenders as it grips better.  They feel less &#34;mushy&#34; than my originals. They feel sturdier so they are probably less likely to tear on the edges like my originals eventually did because they were soft. Just to be clear: the rubber is slightly stiffer, not hard.<br /><br />3. It's possible the texturing on these is a little different than the originals.  I actually like it better as these feel like they will hold up longer before going smooth."
5.0,Shirt worked great for after surgery. Easy to put on while in an arm sling.
5.0,love the style and the fit - plus the polarized lens - perfect - great buy -
5.0,simply darling and what a great gift
5.0,I love the quality of Allegra K Shirts! This fits me so nicely and is very comfortable. So far I have purchased four shirts from this brand and cannot wait to purchase more. The sizes are true and I wear a plus size 16 in the shirts so all my plus size beauties check out this brand. I recommend it to everyone.!
5.0,great hat might buy another one
5.0,"I am pregnant and these yoga pants still fit great! They truly are full coverage, so no worries about awkward stretch making the butt see through. I'd say they are true to size too! I wish these came in more colors, as they truly fit great!"
5.0,These are very good quality and they came fast.
5.0,"Love this dress! Super soft and light material. Possibly see through in the right light, though"
5.0,I really like them they are very soft and comfy

5.0,Best shirt ever! Looks better in person.  Keep in mind it runs SMALL.  I usually wear a small/medium.  I ordered a large and it's snug.  Order at least one size bigger than you usually do.
5.0,"Es bueno por el contenido de bolsillos para herramienta. Cómo lápices, metro de medir, navaja o cuchilla, artículos personales.<br />Me gusta el pantalón gracias"

5.0,Comfy and colorful... perfect for my princess
5.0,Dead accurate sizing and made increasing size so easy very comfortable
5.0,"I thought these would be useful in helping me keep organized, and they have exceeded my expectations.  While you do lose a very little space, the ability to keep things organized is well worth the space they take.  This pack is especially useful as the variety of sizes make it so flexible to fit everything  I need while I am gone for home. I will not travel with out them."
5.0,"Its very important to protect ourselves and other people around us wearing masks correctly. But I'm such kind a person that I dont want just to wear it correctly, I want them to look really cute and nice. Thats why I buy this set of chains for masks made of colorful beads. So beautiful. I love how these looks like on my face masks. Affordable price. Great nice quality of beads"
5.0,I absolutely love the way this lightweight little jacket fits! Got an XL. I have quite a few sleeveless tops but I don't like my arms out and it provides just the right amount of coverage I like!<br />I get hot very easily so Hopefully it will provide the comfort I need once I get a chance to actually wear it. I will post a picture when I do. I love that it comes in so many colors! I already plan on buying it in other colors.
5.0,Fantastic buy. I love that it dresses up my Fitbit. Also it is very secure.
5.0,Good quality goggle. They fit both adult and young child with ease. Easy to loosen or tighten. Hold a good seal.

5.0,This wallet is exactly what I need very good
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my mother and she says she’ll never use another purse again unless it’s another one of these. It’s big enough to carry everything she needs while also keeping everything organized.
5.0,well got them for myself and I like them a lot and work with my style. great product just would of liked to replace the gold ones lol not my color.
5.0,I got a 3x but I could have done an 1x but it still looks cute. I wore it with a white button down shirt under it .

5.0,This is a very flattering dress.
5.0,It is what it is. Not heavy duty but you can get a few uses out of it.
5.0,"Such a classic looking bag. More than classic looking, it's classic-built. So many bags today are cutting corners, getting thinner, and using zippers that don't hold up. This bag is the real deal and I feel confident I'll be enjoying it for decades. Thanks Carhartt."
5.0,"Fast delivery, item as described."
5.0,My daughter LOVES these shirts! So cute! They got her perfectly and they came in MUCH earlier than expected! My daughter says these Vampirina shirts are very comfy! I’m extremely happy with the purchase! The price was very nice too!

5.0,Awesome product.  Thanks.
5.0,"Star Labs Hoodie - Star Laboratories Hooded Sweatshirt was a very good buy, my daughter love it"
5.0,"The shoe is to die for. Love it! If could of came in a box to be protected. Otherwise, it's a gorgeous shoe my 5yr old daughter loves them too. I got them a hole size up just to be safe with a sock on they fit without a sock they are just a bit big. Not wearing until a special occasion occurs so hopefully we go without a problem. Great shoe, very good material used and well put together."
5.0,The socks were perfect! I was so happy to be able to find the same socks as before but they had worn out! These aare perfect!
5.0,Loved the dress! It was a bit thin and showed every curve you may have. Although I didn’t mind for the price!
5.0,Beautiful I wear it all the time
5.0,Valves fall out on first day its great but valves get lost
5.0,"Third AILang that I've owned, they've all worked perfectly right out of the box, attention to detail and quality is difficult to match at this price point."
5.0,Ive had them on for 4 weeks with no issues. Excellent quality would highly recommend! They keep me on track as i work to lose weight and I prefer to use them as a weight loss gauge over the scale.
5.0,Perfect hat for South Fl sun
5.0,Super super cute! And perfect for little ones.
5.0,"Nice clutch, looks exactly like on the picture, good quality"
5.0,Good and well made sock hat. Material is thick and keeps your head really warm.
5.0,Well made and attractive Tie good quality workmanship and materials!!
5.0,I bought a few of these brooches and attached to fabric gift bags.  The gift bags are so pretty they present as a gift holding a gift.  I  wish I could buy several brooches placed in one shipping package instead of a separate shipping charge for each single brooch purchased.  The extra cost is significant.
5.0,I bought three handbags from the seller and I love all of them.
5.0,Just so you know. It's a fake pearl not real.
5.0,Great for the days when you need a little extra or a little less.
5.0,"I purchased these glasses to prevent the glare and halos around headlights when driving at night. They have worked wonderfully well for that. However, I got some added benefits. They also seem to lighten the darkness and make it easier to see. I started to drive my car one sunny day, put on my usual sunglasses and decided to see what the yellow lense would do in the sunshune. I loved them! I got the sunny bright appearance, but the glare was gone.  I would recommend them highly!"
5.0,These are great for the price. The stud is the exact size I was looking or. I just wish the pin was a little longer or curved since mnie fall out easily. Good thing I have plenty to replace
5.0,Very nice nightgown with cute pattern. Good material.
5.0,"I love these boots. I thought I had wide feet so I bought a half size up and they fit great. The color was a little bit not what I expected, but they were so cute I just wanted to wear them. They look exceptionally cute with my maroon skinny jeans. Comfortable enough to look cute walking all day to classes, dressy enough to wear to Church. I did spray them with a suede protector in case they got in a puddle or snow. Haven't had any problems in the last few months I've been wearing them!"
5.0,If you wear large you better order the XL . Be it will be to small. I ordered a 2 XL and it is really tight on me. But very good quality. It will keep you warm. Thanks seller.
5.0,They fit and good quality. And good price
5.0,"Good quality t-shirt. It took me a while to dig through all the other sellers of the mama bear shirts before I found this one and decided to take a chance on the quality. Pleased that the shirt came exactly as the picture shows.<br />Only precaution - definitely do not go by the size chart though. I normally wear a small/medium, but based on the chart it showed I should order a large. Shirt was way too big. I am returning and getting a smaller size."
5.0,I like the smoothness of the material and fit.  These have been running small but once I figured this out I was able to get the correct size.
5.0,Totally love it. I made a perfect choice for my metallic blue ford explorer. It really fits my personality to a tee
5.0,Exactly what I wanted. Fits great!
5.0,"This came very quickly and was packaged in a envelope style attractive pouch.  Nice for a gift, but it was for me and I'm glad.  It is prettier in person, as the khaki is somewhat gold. Only wish it wasn't so slick since I'm having a hard time getting it to hold a knot on my purse.  Maybe if I hand wash and iron that may reduce some of the slick-ness.  Probably wouldn't be an issue if you were going to put it around your neck."
5.0,"I am so glad that I ordered them 😁😍  usually I am not able to wear earrings of this size because usuualy they are made of a heavy material which make the earring hole on my ear droop way to much.  I stopped using them some years ago because I was concern with that issue.  These are not at all.  Not only are they not heavy, but, the color are just like the pictures.  Very happy with them!"
5.0,perfect fit and is cute.  Looks exactly like the picture.
5.0,Classic powerhouse. You’ll see.
5.0,"Bought these to wear with my homemade Dino costume. I was not doing well making gloves so saw these and was like yep, I’m buying these bad boys.  They were warm and durable."
5.0,These gloves were above my expectations! They are GREAT!<br />They are so soft and the lining is also soft and warm.<br />I only wear leather gloves and I must say these are the best!<br />I LOVE love these!!
5.0,I actually bought two for my daughter’s they absolutely loved them. Nicely made and very warm.
5.0,Like butter
5.0,I got this 6 days after I ordered it! It was due in 06/03-06/18 and it came 05/14 I'm so happy. Very cute and I love it!! &#60;3 would recommend!!!
5.0,Very useful. Helps so much with the glare. Thank you.
5.0,Every time I use this bag- I feel so vintage.
5.0,"Comfortable, and fit nicely on my 8year old"
5.0,"This is the perfect tee!  True to size, fairly thick (not see-thru at all), styled with extra length.  The split v-neck &#34;corners&#34; stay put, and don't flop over like most do that are this style.  Worth the cost for a $25 tee, and I plan to get a few more colors."
5.0,Perfect for a butterfly party
5.0,"These bands are exactly as depicted!  Great size, comfort, durability and colors!  You also can’t beat the price!"
5.0,"If you have to wear a mask, it may as well be a fun one that shows school pride. The colors, pattern, and fit are perfect! My daughter loved this!"
5.0,"This dress is really beautiful and flattering design. It fits really well and has a slight stretch. The fabric is soft jersey knit.<br />I love how flattering it fits - you can pull the dress slightly off the shoulders to make it look sexier or keep it up near the neck line for more modest look. There is a belt included - however I like to use my own belts and you can really dress this one up with a nice belt. There are 2 slits on the bottom on the sides of the dress that show a little leg, but not too much.<br />The length of this dress is just below the knee (I am 5’8” 135 lbs, and got size medium)<br />It looks really cute with pumps or ankle booties.<br />New favorite dress - I want more colors now."
5.0,Great sunglasses - cute and comfortable!
5.0,"Great colors! The material is heavy, might not be something you wear in the summertime, but great for fall!"
5.0,"very nice fabric, well made, my son very pleased with it (even if Mom wasn't happy with the message!)"
5.0,Got a chance to use it right away during tropical storm Olivia here in Hawaii...a week ago ...worked and kept me dry.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:cad5279b766f676a330ba9a039996ceb]] Set Include 8 Belly Rings<br />High Quality Stainless Steel<br />8 Multi Colored Stones<br />14g 3/8&#34;<br />Hypoallergenic<br /><br />This is a video review of the Set of 7 Stainless Steel Belly Double UV Coated Glitter Covered Navel Rings from Regetta Jewelers that I received at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

If you have any questions about my experience/opinion with this product, don't hesitate to ask :)"
5.0,"The material is great quality and very well made.  The apron is just the right size for my six year old, but it also works for my four year olds!  I highly recommend!"
5.0,"I was a bit nervous ordering bc of size chart, but they fit as expected and my son LOVES them."
5.0,"Cute little hats but recommended for little girls, or women with smaller heads."
5.0,No complaints.  The lenses seem clear and the spring hinges are a must.  The glasses are nice colors and I am happy
5.0,"A little tricky to situate since I have sort of a skinny nose but super cute! The big decorative ones can be a bit too heavy to sit well for me, but again that’s probably just me. Seem sturdy and fun variety."
5.0,My daughter loves this shoe.
5.0,I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review. I wear long chain necklaces like this on a daily basis... It looks fresh and young and adds a little something extra to any outfit. So I was very excited to give this one a go. It's fun and really completes an outfit and I've gotten so many compliments on it. The chain is sturdy and it doesn't look &#34;cheap&#34; or too juvenile to wear to the office and its muted enough to go with everything! I would highly recommend this to long necklace lovers!
5.0,"All really cute, all a perfect fit, and they have stayed in great condition, none tarnish or broken."
5.0,"Even though it’s not real leather, it looks and feels real, but without that weird leather smell! Durability for this purse is definitely 10/10. I really beat up my purses and it still looks brand new. I even spilled a coffee on it over this past weekend and it cleaned up perfectly. I love the studded detail on either side; it adds a flashy accent to what is already a very nice looking purse. The size of it is actually my favorite thing about it. I have two kids under 3 so I prefer to use large purses that can double as a diaper bag. The large pouch on the inside is perfect for holding a few diapers and a small package of wipes for when we’re out on the go. There’s also enough room to toss a few toys and snacks in too. The decorative strap on the front with the large gold letters is actually removable, if you so choose. The letters have been catching just a bit on my clothes when I’m holding the purse close to my body so I may remove the letters just for convenience sake. All in all, I’m a big fan of the bag. The outer stitching and material are both very strong and have held up to my abuse, and the inner fabric is a beautiful red. There is a nice variety of sizes for the pockets, three of which have zipper closures, and there is a zipper at the top to close the entire purse. I would recommend this purse to anyone who carries a lot of items with them on a daily basis. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,"I wear an 8 or 8.5 and these fit great! Very stretchy and soft (mostly cotton!) and a super variety of colors. Doesn’t fall down in my shoe in the back by the heel, which is annoying. These stay up! I like to wear thicker socks for Zumba, but these will be my go to socks for all other times. I also like that they have ""grippers"" on the bottom which are a bonus for wearing around the house without shoes. Comfy, stretchy, and stay put. Love them!"
5.0,It so warm and cozy. I love the color. Everything fits perfectly. Glad i order this.
5.0,Is great dress
5.0,The fit is perfect. The front pouch adds for some fun too.
5.0,"I wasn't expecting much from a swimsuit at thie price point but I was proven wrong. The dress part under the bust line WILL float up so if that's a concern, another suit might work best for you. I take swimming lessons, intermediate, and it does not get in my way. I am a more modest person in dress and this is a good length. Does not look matronly but yet hides your rear fully. Also, underneath is more like a boy short instead of a breif cut. I'm not complaining at all b/c again, more coverage for me, is a good thing. True to color. Got compliments the first time I wore it, a fellow student asked where I got it. Will be ordering the black with pink next as I really like this cut and the modesty."
5.0,"This shirt was for my husband, and he absolutely loves it. The quality is great, and the material is very soft but durable feeling.<br />Disclosure: I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted rate in order to test and give an unbiased review. As a longtime customer of Amazon, I depend on honest reviews for purchases.  I will always update my reviews if anything regarding my impression of an item changes.

5.0,I got this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. I opened and set it for him to be able to have it ready to wear upon opening. It is a gorgeous watch and would recommend this for any man who likes to wear gold. Classy and sexy.
5.0,"This dress has a spongy cheap feel to it. It's stretchy and it fits very well and is the perfect length on me, just above my knees. I'm 5'3&#34; and I weigh 170lbs. hips 38&#34; bust 34C. I usually wear Medium (size 6 -8-10) depending on the type of clothing/ Misses or Juniors."
5.0,"REALLY NICE QUALITY, BUT RUNS SMALL....JUST ORDER UP A SIZE."
5.0,They feel amazing. Very soft. I wear over 12 hours a day. My feet do not hurt and it keeps my swelling down. Also they so not make my feet sweat or smell
5.0,"I like how this product fits doesn’t roll,or sag and it’s breathable. I already ordered another 2 pair."
5.0,"This jacket is really warm. Great with athleisure wear, with jeans or over a dress. I ordered the green for my daughter & she loved it so much, I ordered this one."
5.0,"A co-worker introduced these to me and I love them.  I have fairly thick hair and I have to double twist my bun when I run otherwise my hair flops loose.  With these, all I have to do is the one twist around and it holds tight.  The other thing I like is that I can sport a somewhat loose ponytail with no twist and it still holds....so much better than having to pull back my hair tight which usually makes my scalp hurt halfway through the day. I bought the 1.6 diameter size."
5.0,always a joy to buy this brand
5.0,I love this tshirt!!  It's nice and soft.
5.0,I was actually quite surprised when I got these boots. They seemed quite solid and very pretty in person.  The leopard design is well done and I’ll highly recommend.
5.0,"I've been wearing this ring for about two weeks now. It still looks just as nice as the first day I got it.<br /><br />I personally love the fact that it's adjustable. I have skinny fingers and large knuckles, so rings that fit perfectly at the base of my fingers won't fit over my knuckle when I try to take them off. Rings that can fit over my knuckle are entirely too big at the base of my finger. Having an adjustable ring solves all of that.<br /><br />To be honest, I'm not a jewelry expert. I'm not able to inspect it under a microscope and tell if you if it's real moissanite or whatever. I can't go into detail about the cut of the stones or how they're seated. But what I can tell you is that it doesn't turn my finger colors, and it hasn't lost its luster. My sister thought it was a real diamond, and she's a total jewelry snob.<br /><br />I am quite happy with this ring, but I'll update my review in the future if anything changes."
5.0,This is the best quality and the same quality cost a lot on eBay.
5.0,This belt super exceeded my expectations!!! Its perfect!!!  It looks just like the real high end belt.
5.0,"Love love. Perfect for my Cali trip. 2 for the price of 1 and the packaging is amazing. Individual bags for both, protects them from scratches."
5.0,"I wear suits everyday and also have kids. Tie clips tend to go missing more than. I would like. This price was very inexpensive, so I had concerns. These clips look very nice, each with a variated design. They clip firmly and have smooth teeth as not to damage your tie. I'm a clothing snob and I've bought 10 dollar clips that didn't work or look as nice as these do. I'd highly recommend as a fellow suit snob or for you or someone you love that can't always keep his clips in order. ."
5.0,"This is a great bag.  The colors are beautiful, and it is roomy enough to put my tennis shoes in yet not so big as to be bulky to carry."
5.0,Very comfortable and the material is breathable. I'd purchase again.
5.0,"I bought a XL & was sent a L. I put them on & they still fit. A little snug, but they do the job and so far i've had no issue. I'm glad i was actually sent a L. They feel amazing and are so comfortable."
5.0,Super cute. No I don’t have to wear the whole shirt. Now it’s just a collar shirt.
5.0,Comfortable and casual dress
5.0,I love the material. Very classy. Can be ironed. Can be washed in the washer. Haven't lost any buttons yet. I've had this dress for months.
5.0,I didn’t buy them as computer glasses but as it turns out you’re my go to pair for work excellent fit just the right strength
5.0,Great necklace came in a cute little bag and is exactly what I ordered. The coloring is great and has an adjustable length chain.
5.0,Loved these gloves

5.0,beautiful bracelet for the price
5.0,Super cute. Got lots of compliments. Material isn't cotton- it's stretchier and light weight.
5.0,"Better than messenger bags I’ve purchased at 3x the cost on eBags.com. Sturdier, better expandability, perfect for casual office use (for men)."
5.0,I loved the shipment came really fast.
5.0,Remarkable quality.  Looks and feels like $30 ties that you would get from a dept store or other brand name stores.  Have received lots of compliment for the bold Spring look that these ties gives you.

5.0,Just as the item was described. Very pretty and reasonably priced.

5.0,"This is a beautiful skirt, light weight but not sheer fabric, and it has pockets. I'm 5'8"" and size 14 jeans, and the XXL fits me comfortably. But please note that the color is definitely EMERALD green, in  ase that matters to you."
5.0,Finally a headband that is comfortable and doesn’t slip off. I plan to order more of these.
5.0,"NOthing fancy, just a plain black stretchy endless scarf that has a nice sized pocket for phone keys money etc. for traveling, walking or for when you don't want to carry a purse."

5.0,"of all the reusable grocery bags I own, these are my favorite.  Like to option of two sets of straps.  I have already recommended them to friends"
5.0,"After striking out on many shirt/sweater purchases, I was happy to receive this sweater.  I'm 5'4&#34;, weigh 140, 37&#34; bust.  I have a somewhat long torso.  This sweater covers my crotch.  The back is longer, so it just covers my butt.  If you pull down the sleeves they cover most of my fingers, but sleeves don't look bunched up if I keep the sleeves at my wrist.  This is a straight cut sweater, not form-fitting.  Cowl is generous.  Sweater knit is fairly dense, so it is warm."
5.0,"Pefect. I will buy more. I'm tall, 5'8&#34; and on the muscular side (calves). These go right over my knee no problem. They're soft and well made."
5.0,Love love this dress !!

5.0,"In Love with the product, I enjoy the extras"
5.0,"Not too slim fit or too baggy, they did a great job on printing and the shirt is on the thicker side."
5.0,this shirt is AWESOME!!!!  i bought it because i work at a library plus i LOVE Star Trek Voyager  big fan i plan on wearing this to work.<br />it does smell pretty strong once it comes out of the bag but once washed it is fine no worries.
5.0,these wallets are whimsical and still extremely functional.
5.0,Pretty and looks good on black dress. It's
5.0,"The package came on time in the mail.  The size and weight were correct, and this rounded ""donut"" edge is great.  Definitely going to be purchasing more from The Chain Gang."
5.0,"Perfect for my little girl, with the continuous loop she doesn't complain about getting poked with the stud or loose them."
5.0,Muy bonito y muy fresco
5.0,Bought for my granddaughter.  She loves it.  Uses it for dance shoes and clothing.  Works great!
5.0,Just what she wanted. Cheaper price than Etsy too.

5.0,"I love it, Thanks"
5.0,Fits my face perfectly and the look is California cool

5.0,Nice especially for price !!
5.0,"I needed a longer-than-normal strap for a guitar I'd just bought. Took a chance on this one, and it was the right move.<br /><br />This strap is not only long enough, but it's very soft and comfortable. And the workmanship looks to be top notch."
5.0,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loved it!  It's very easy to adjust the size quickly the jewlery gasn't tarnished or faded. This is a great buy for the price.
5.0,"I bought a size bigger then I would usually get to be safe, and I could have gone with a smaller size but I love how cozy it is! It's soft on the inside and I literally wear it all the time!"
5.0,"The perfect size. I've seen the ones a little larger than this one and they take too much room in the suitcase. This is a good size, forces you to packmore of what you need and is very sturdy. I love all the netted compartments and the hook to hang it on the robe hook. When I'm not using it to travel, I will be using it for my makeup.  Overall, a fantastic bag!"
5.0,Beautiful and perfect. Recommended 100%
5.0,My son loves these and the fact that they have little wheels on the side. They fit him perfectly!
5.0,"Was really surprised at the quality of the glasses and the packaging was super quality as though these were $200 glasses. I just wish I could find yellow glasses that truly cut the brightness of headlights without taking way some of the visibility of the darker roadways.  But, these yellow ones are average with what I've tried elsewhere. Over all. Very impressed."
5.0,I absolutely live this dress. Was looking for some new church gear and I've found it. Going to order other colors
5.0,"5' 7"" and 215. Bought a 1x.<br />Love the fit, the material, the design, EVERYTHING! Would definitely recommend this cute Boho style dress!"
5.0,I wore these around the house about 45 minutes the day I received just cleaning and when I took them off literally drenched in sweat. I feel like wearing them makes any activity burn more calories and would definitely recommend! I wouldn’t wear in public though- they are king of weird scuba looking pants that are thicker than normal workout pants.
5.0,"Bought this for my aging mom, she liked it so much when it got really dirty after about 2 years, she had me get her another one. No real easy way of cleaning it that she found"
5.0,These are fantastic for big headed dudes. I see no issue with the bill that others have mention. This is my second one and definitely won't be my last.
5.0,Mi nieta está encantada con ella.
5.0,"I read the reviews and was tepid about the decal and how long it would last and the size difference. I bought it for a child, knowing it would be a bit large on them, and I was told two months later, still how much they wear it and love it. I'd say that's a win. I had a chance to look at it, and considering how much it is worn, it still looked mint. No fading and the decal still looked pristine. It seemed the right amount of thickness, not too thin and not too thick when I packed and wrapped it up. If I had any complaint, it would be the price."
5.0,"I. Love. These.<br />I got them a half-size up so I can easily commit the sin of wearing socks with them if I need to throw on some slides to run outside.  But they also fit great bare-footed, and are so comfortable. Two thumbs up!"
5.0,Very pretty earrings.  Nice size.
5.0,"Hard to think of much to say about shoelaces. Measure the ones you're replacing, to make sure you order the right length (I did).<br />These laces tie my shoes, which means they work as they're supposed to..."
5.0,The kids love these things. No more propping the phone up on their lap while using the controllers.
5.0,"Muy buen producto, llego en las fechas estipuladas."
5.0,Perfect Color!
5.0,They are soft and comfortable. The size was perfect.
5.0,"For the price, this purchase was a steal. The strap is so comfy and convenient and exactly what I was looking for."
5.0,"Very good quality, good value, and shipping was very fast!"
5.0,I LOVE this hat. And it came sooner than I expected.  Thank You.
5.0,"These are the ones you want to buy , very well made. I ordered 2 more pair..... very impressed ‘"
5.0,"This work out bra is great, so comfortable, and very supportive without creating a uni boob.  I'm a runner and it is difficult to find an exercise bra with adequate support that isn't a binding for my chest.  I am going to buy another in a different color."
5.0,"Nice lanyard, good quality.  Better price than in sporting good store.  I would recommend."
5.0,Love it! The fit was great and it covered the mommy tummy.
5.0,"I have dry eyes, and these glasses have really helped my eyes while working on my computer. My eyes do not get as tired, and I don't feel the need to use eye drops quite as often."
5.0,I have went through my fair share of reader sunglasses due to them being cheaply made. These are by far the best quality I’ve come across. Bifocals are well placed making it easy to read. Great fit for people with larger heads :) I would definitely recommend these and looking forward to buying a second pair in a different color.
5.0,Awesome little compact wallet/coin/card holder that's all in one. It was time to retire my old navy one which was all beat up. It had one main opening and an outer coin holder with a button. This one fit everything perfect. Glad I bought this!!!
5.0,Feels much brighter and clearler in cloudy day. In nights headlights are less glarely so easier to drive.
5.0,"Nice watch, i loved my new Luminox Watch"
5.0,Just fun! Love the double meaning and a Christmas/holiday theme. What more could you ask for!
5.0,Great quality product and nice looking watch. My uncle wanted a Railroad approved watch and he is very happy with this one.
5.0,"I have had a few people come up to me and ask me where I got my glasses (especially my friends that also use readers). They certainly look better then some of the other ones I have used.  I wear a 3.0, and sometimes it is difficult to find that strength in something cute.  These are perfect."
5.0,Cute. Fit well.
5.0,"I love, love,love this set.  It is just exactly what I have been looking for !!!"
5.0,"The colors are great. Material seems a high, durable quality.  I have to pull them tight to keep my pants up, since i have no a$$, and the buckle seems to hold just fine."
5.0,my husband determined to find me a ring we both like and he did a good job
5.0,Nice hat can not wait to use it.
5.0,"This jelly bag from Zicac has more detailing than most of the fabric totes I've seen lately. Back in the original day of the jelly (yes, I am that old), it was cool enough to be shiny and transparent.<br /><br />The &quot;bag&quot; actually comes with two bags -- the transparent tote and the opaque black bag. I'll talk about the opaque black bag first.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect from the black bag because there wasn't a good photo of it, so I took a photo for you. A very young person could probably get away with carrying the black bag and its clip on shoulder/cross-body strap as an actual purse; the rest of us not so much. Why? The bag itself is constructed out of PVC and has no defined shape. It's just odd. Plus, the hardware is inexpensive, and you notice that where the handle clips onto the bag.<br /><br />As a companion to the tote, the black bag is a stroke of genius. The problem with transparent totes is that they are, well, transparent. They inevitably look messy. And even if you don't care about that, most women don't want to go to the beach or the club and broadcast their tampon brand. Put those and anything else that makes the trip to the bathroom with you in the black bag and boom: the transparent tote has order and dignity.<br /><br />The tote itself is well-made for a value-priced bag. It's clear that some effort has been made to differentiate this bag from a basic:<br /><br />  * Handles are long enough to be a shoulder bag<br />  * Metal &quot;faux bow&quot; detail on one side<br />  * Real lace (fabric, not PVC) on one side<br />  * Metal feet on the base of the bag<br /><br />All of those details are done with thrift as this bag is reasonably priced and the PVC is just as thick as any other jelly bag I have owned. The sacrifice you make is that the manufacturer knows that the metal details will probably not stay looking great forever. I give them credit for recommending that the gold-tone detailing be &quot;coated with clear nail varnish&quot; to maintain its finish. They also have recommendations on the tag for keeping the zippers working and looking good.<br /><br />For a trendy item that I'm not going to own for years, I'll happily trade the lower price for the higher quality metals and zippers. (Now, if the zippers don't survive summer, I'll be back to let you know. But they seem totes fine so far. And I sat and opened and closed them through like three episodes of Quantico, driving my family insane. I just didn't want them to fail on me in a month. Zealot? Yes, I am.)<br /><br />The only other thing to keep in mind with this bag is the size. I originally had the beach in mind because it is called &quot;beach bag.&quot; It turns out that I do not pack light and 14&quot; wide isn't nearly enough. Also, with the fabric lace on the outside of the bag, it didn't strike me as the most practical for a beach goer. I did check with the maker, and the lace can be rinsed with warm water to clean, so you can treat it just like you would usually treat a jelly bag.<br /><br />This item was provided to me at no charge in return for writing this honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"Honestly I was worried a bit because you can't find much of exactly what this product is, exactly. It's a full 'mesh' type material. I always preferred the half-mesh around the chest and the rest to be a cotton tank, but honestly even as a bigger guy this works fine. I thought the beer belly would make the full mesh unbearable, but it just doesn't. It does it's job, it flattens, but everyone should be aware unless you practice conscious proper posture that it'll make wearing any binder that covers the entirety of your back much less comfortable quite quicker."
5.0,"loads of compliments, got a size up because I wear a brace (scoliosis) and needed a shirt to cover the brace.  excellent choice, fits perfect considering the size and why I got it."
5.0,"I would say this runs a little on the snug side. If you're wanting an oversized fit, definitely size up. It isn't body-con in any way, but it is on the snug side when you order true to size. It is pretty long. On someone under 5'4"" it would be more of a maxi dress than a midi dress. 5'5"" and above, it'll be a midi dress. It does have pockets! It isn't super thick, but it isn't see through at all."
5.0,I like this sweater. It comes in handy to add to your wardrobe and I liked the fit.
5.0,Adorable and she cant kick them off! 5 stars

5.0,"Fits like a glove in all the right places. Material is great and spandexy! Love this dress for date night, girls night whatever!"
5.0,Never liked hoodies because they seem too baggy. I love how their T shirts fit so gave this a shot. Fits really well and comfortable.
5.0,I love it it is such a unique design. Very pretty too. Keep making more like this!
5.0,Just what my daughter needed.  We wore on a hike and it worked great for her.
5.0,My son bought these as shower shoes for his college dorm bathrooms. He says they are perfect for that purpose.
5.0,"Take in mind my son loves dinosaurs so this was for his restroom, but overall very satisfied thick material and doesn’t get dirty at all, great product."
5.0,"I love this top, in fact, I now own three of them. Well made and I love that these are breathable too. I work in construction in the south and this is comfortable, breathable and quick drying. I would love to purchase another in orange but I can't find them!"
5.0,"Purchased this dress for a NYE party. I’m 5’2. I got it hem. Absolutely love it. Honestly, I think you can wear the dress backwards and it still looks amazing, but than wearing it the correct way.<br /><br />Next time I wear. I’ll get a full length picture."
5.0,Great hat and customer service!
5.0,"really love it. i'm female but it would go either way. great quality, super long and warm. classy."
5.0,"Decorated it for grandkids , white worked out great ,kids liked having unique aprons made just for them ."
5.0,I purchased this for my niece she loves Panda and its so cute I thought about getting one for myself.
5.0,It fits true to size. A little snug around the tummy bc it is basically a tube type dress. The pockets are a good size & actually functional!
5.0,"I love the pattern , great fit."

5.0,Amazing product food quality beautiful Identicle to picture

5.0,Great quality product! Exactly what I was looking for. I’ve had several compliments on it and have encouraged them to buy one!
5.0,"Got this and it was exactly what I expected and very beautiful.  I had already read reviews saying that it is light weight and not metal/stone, so I was prepared.  That said it is very beautiful in person, and I doubt most people will know that it is not metal/stone.  The 'stones' have a multifaced cut so as to brilliantly reflect light.  Exactly the beauty I was looking for with my budget bargain online shopping for clothes and jewelry (I don't like cheap things to look cheap!)"
5.0,compact and they are comfortable to wear
5.0,"This seems to be a very nice band. Coordinates well with other tan/British tan leathers.  It's stiff at first but is softening nicely with use. It fits me well, but I'm tall and lean with smaller wrists. A bigger guy would end up using one of the end straps and not have much strap left over to tuck in. Quickly shipped from seller."
5.0,Loveeeed it!
5.0,I wanted to wait to send this review. I have had many items such as<br />this one but none of them lasted....this keeps on going and as of yet..<br />which has been quite a while...no noise. It's a fine item and I&#34;m very<br />happy with it

5.0,Bought as a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves it!
5.0,"WOW I just ordered these shades last week and it came today 05/28/2013, I thought that I would have received these shades by June. Anyway I am a FAN of the Yankees, for this deal and these shades are better than my last pair of shades that I accidentally broken, more sturdier and more relax fit i truly love these shades now I feel happy when the sun comes out and my shades also have the Yankee emblem on both sides as well. A Fan indeed! ;-)"

5.0,"I love this dress! It is super cute and flattering and the material is very soft and comfortable. I got a lot of compliments when I wore it to church. It does show a little bit of cleavage, but would still look cute with a tank top on underneath. I ordered a large and that's what size I usually wear. The waist is elastic so definitely gives you some room if you need it."
5.0,Fits as expected. True to size. Would definitely purchase another one.
5.0,Great quality of fabric. Fits as expected. Cute.  I wear this for my work.

5.0,This is a gift for a friend that is taking flying lesson an is color blind. This will help him see all the colors From the air as I have over the years.
5.0,Love this! The pink is so pretty and it’s so soft.
5.0,I've tried seemingly every band on Amazon & most are trash. Got 2 pk & been wearing 1 of the 2 since that day
5.0,"Everything about this dress is perfect! The material is soft. I read a review about the dress being see through, it's not. The length is great. I'm 5'8 and it comes to my ankles."

5.0,My grand daughter loved this!
5.0,I mean they’re costume horns. They get the job done :)
5.0,My son wears this under his jersey
5.0,"I absolutely loved this dressed. The material was amazing, stretchy but still thick and not that thin see through style stuff. The dress was long I am 5’7 and the night I wore it I had on 3 and a half inch heels and it still hit the floor. The back is completely open and has a scrunched in style that sits over your butt to accent you curves even if you don’t have much. It definitely shows every curve and needs to be worn with the backless bra cups. Super cute and fun dress I would order again!"
5.0,I like the simplicity of it. It's very pretty and just has the key words of the Serenity Prayer on the outer ring. Also like the shorter style chain length.
5.0,The rings are great!<br />Their customer service is fantastic!<br />I would Highly recommend this Groove Life  and the rings!

5.0,"great product, will continue to use, since my kids scream like I'm ripping their skin off whenever they need a hair cut. I'd rather not subject any more stylists to their insanity."

5.0,I love them for the price and they're sensitive ear friendly to!
5.0,We order three socks every baseball and football season. My son likes them and they are so good for the price.

5.0,"I love this handbag. Perfect size, not too big and not too small. Beautiful color and design."
5.0,"Well crafted, and well received by the person I gave it to. I would recommend it to anyone looking for quality leather goods."
5.0,"Quality was excellent, Beautiful top, and well packaged."
5.0,The silver finish will eventually wear away on the back. I still love this ring purchased for myself as a single mother but took forever to arrive.  Finally a mother's ring for the single mom that is recognized as a mother's ring. It was my Mother's Day gift to myself. ☺😇
5.0,Adorable mask! I returned it because I returned the costume but I would definitely purchase from here again.
5.0,"Never will I ever, unless it is a gift, go back to a regular buckle belt. This thing is amazing and the ease of adjusting is 2nd to none. I think they run a touch big though."
5.0,Great stocking stuffer for my granddaughter’s first trip to Europe!
5.0,Love this shirt it was everything I expected .
5.0,Adorable and dainty! My only complaint is that it's very yellow. I wish it wasn't so much so. But I think it'll be fine. I'm buying a  few more for layering.
5.0,I cannot wait for my future grandson to wear this!
5.0,"Very nice, I have gotten a lot of compliments on Earth and the Moon.<br /><br />It was a bit of a push to get them in with my current pericing being not wide enough.  The shaft if thinker then a normal earing.  And the screw is not a comfortable push but once in they are amazing and normal from then on out.<br /><br />Thanks"
5.0,"Best surgical hat I ever had! Very comfortable, light weight, and well made. Fabric is breathable, soft, have variety of designs and colors. The two buttons for mask hanging also work well protecting my ears. Highly recommend this product."
5.0,Excellent and it is the second one we have ordered.
5.0,Best way to buy L'eggs hosiery.
5.0,Fit nicely and looks very nice.
5.0,My daughter's favorite verse.  Better than I expected! Quality is good!
5.0,These leggings fit well although the waistband itself was a little snug. Can't have too many black leggings lol.
5.0,Price is so great I had to buy another set. I purchased another one from a reputable brand for 40$$!?. This is the better option
5.0,Even prettier in person. Wish the clasp was easier but the chain has a nice sparkle. If gifting they will love it. Nicely presented
5.0,"I ordered this because it was so insanely affordable, and very unique. It's great quality, and fit true to size. I ordered a size 10 for my middle finger, and it's quite the statement piece. I'm very happy."
5.0,Impressed. Looks like a high-end Casio or Armitron watch. Came from China wrapped in foam. The time and date was already set and accurate to my location. I did have to set the digital time which I was able to do with the help of the simple instruction sheet that came with the watch. But now that I know where the appropriate buttons are this will be easy to adjust. Obviously it keeps fairly good time as it arrived from China with the exact time I have. It does have Japanese movement so that alone makes it worth giving it a try. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I have been in the water with it and appears to be water tight. The warn not to push any buttons while in the water and it is limited to 50 m. More than worth the $4 they are asking. I've seen almost identical watches in departments stores selling for 50 and 60 dollars.
5.0,"The dress is comfortable, stretchy, light and flowy. I purchased 3 and have got a lot of compliments on them. I'm top-heavy 42 DDD which could be an issue with some dresses, BUT NOT THIS ONE."
5.0,I love the product but it took over a month to receive i.
5.0,Great for preschool ballet
5.0,"Got these for my husband for Christmas. Overall good slipper, the shearling is not as dense as I would like, but it was very affordable and it works and is warm. Shearling slippers just aren't as good as they used to be. Hope to get two seasons out of them."
5.0,"These cut the glare when I'm cycling. I can see oncoming cars when the sun is behind them, which is good because sometimes the drivers pretend they don't see me."
5.0,"Got this for my hubby, for a Fathers Day gift, and he loves it! No problems so far! Keeps his watch on perfect time!!"
5.0,"Perfect dress!  Color is true to the picture.  I am 5'5, 143 lbs, and the large was a perfect fit.  Make sure you wear seamless panties with it and you can't go wrong!"
5.0,I get complements all day everyday...I put my prescription n so i wear them frequently.
5.0,Go Blue
5.0,Came quickly and was just as described. They fit great! And they help keep the dirt off my arms at work
5.0,Love love love this dress! Comfortable and a perfect fit.
5.0,Excellent product arrived on time!!
5.0,Robe is nice and the colors are really good👍 Sizing is also pretty good 😁
5.0,Good quality. This is better than expected.
5.0,"This is nice and solid, not flimsy at all.  No issues with missing or loose stones.  I would recommend."
5.0,"This is great! It’s really nice quality, especially for the price. I ordered a size up since a lot of shirts on Amazon are a little snug and I don’t think it was necessary. Definitely worth the money!"
5.0,"If one must wear a face covering, one should be able to at least wear an interesting one.  This dragon design fills that requirement.  It is comfortable...not too hot.  The filter helps keep the mask from clinging to the face.  Very happy with it."
5.0,Love that this is a soft for babies and looks adorable.
5.0,exactly what i wanted to give my grandkids since I am from Danish family and have one of these in gold from years ago
5.0,Saves your arms and shoulders. Super cute on. Quality material.
5.0,I bought these on November 7th and received them on the 10th without paying for shipping. I'm 30 minutes into my first wear and they got great. I have big calves so I was worried about them being tight or slipping down but they provide the right support and have not so much as shifted yet.
5.0,It's just as advertised!  Love my purse!
5.0,"I ordered this garment bag for an upcoming trip and am thrilled with the product. It is super light weight and easy on the shoulders which is awesome when you're running around chasing your {insert transport vehicle here}. It's also refreshing that the bag is exactly as puctured/described. I'm also impressed at the surprising amount of storage compartments strategically placed throughout the garment bag. This bag is premium quality, durable and functional, I highly recommend!"
5.0,Love these things & much easier to keep up with my phone.  Hubby likes his too.
5.0,"For what this dress is, and for the price, I think it deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />Comfort:<br />-Excellent- light, flowy, cool, and soft<br /><br />Quality:<br />-Pretty good! Not see-though, and this particular garment was sewn well (some sellers on Amazon aren't sewn properly/ hit and miss)<br /><br />Look:<br />-SO cute- wore it to a wedding and felt kinda bad because usually people SHOULD be complementing the bride (not that they didn't), and I paired it with coral colored Mary Janes, lace gloves, and a white fascinator. People be telling me left and right how beautiful I looked. If you're not looking to steal the show or stand out, then rethink this dress.<br />-Petticoat optional: if you're going for '50s era you need a petticoat (black or white looks great), and go without if you're just going for casual MAYBE slightly '40s<br /><br />Fit: THIS is where you really need to pay attention to their sizing chart and have ACCURATE measurements of yourself<br />-I'm 5'2&#34;, 125 lbs, 34b and SHOULD have gotten a SMALL, but got a medium.<br />-Before you read the rest, you need to know that overall the dress still looked really good, the following is just gripes from a perfectionist.<br />-Skirt too long (barely). It goes just a little too far past my knees to be flattering to my skinny calves and have that '50s look. (petticoat helps, but doesn't fix it)<br />-torso was too long: (But I have a short torso) with the shoulders of the bodice resting on my shoulders, the waist dropped below my natural waistline making me look a little frumpy and bigger-waisted than I am. Plus I had to wear a cami underneath because the bodice around the shoulders was too large by just enough where you might see inside the dress through the armholes. (hard to word this clearly)<br />** (Side note: I bought a Medium because I'm not an hourglass body type but rectangular. I kinda sized up because of the Asian sizing, and also because rectangles have bigger waists than the hourglass shape this dress in made for)**<br /><br />I doubt I'll remember to, but I wish to add photos at some point."
5.0,So cute and a great value for the money!
5.0,"Product is perfect.  Color is true, as shown.  Fabric is good quality."
5.0,"Super cute, covers my butt when I'm wearing leggings, which was the point of the purchase. Runs small - I ordered the XL, and I normally take a large or medium."
5.0,"I ordered this eye glass case to protect my new glasses, It came to my house very quickly and was packaged real well and the case is wonderful! Its hard, easy to open and has a lovely cloth to clean your glasses with. The whole transaction from beginning to end was painless, I would recommend shopping with this company, they have been making sure I am happy with my product which I certainly am."
5.0,"Awesome hat, what more is there to say?"
5.0,In an environment when almost everyone is overcharging for mens accessories Hi-Tie has vests and ties has great ties and vests of great style and value. They’re one of two great sources for mens accessories on the internet.<br /><br />I’ll add a caveat for this item. Their sizes on this vest are off. I finally got what I wanted that fit properly. My properly sized item was marked much higher than my real size e.g. this vest runs small…
5.0,This is so perfect! Didn't get too many ashes in it but I didn't need a lot either..the necklace chain is average length I suppose I personally prefer a smaller length but the charm will easily fit on any necklace. It is pretty spacious.
5.0,Love the colors of these bands. Matches the rose gold watch beautifully. Have been using for over 6 months and color has not faded or chipped.
5.0,I liked the size and glitter
5.0,These glasses were perfect for my daughter.
5.0,Nice fit & love the color.
5.0,Used these to make headbands for my sons tennis team. They fit awesome and worked perfectly. Was able to print vinyl on them with no problem. They wash well too.
5.0,Fits great. Lovely for craft time.
5.0,Nice  top and material.
5.0,I bought them for Xmas.The wife loved them
5.0,"I bought these for my son. He usually rides his bike while we run. As the runs got longer, he complained more about his sitting bones hurting. He didn't like them at first use, because he said they &#34;felt funny&#34;. He certainly changed his tune later when he wasn't as sore. Good quality."
5.0,Lo utilice para Día festivo en Navidad
5.0,"This Swimsuit looks great. The material is of good value. It does run very small, I ordered an X-L and it looks like maybe a C cup. I would definetly advise ordering at least 2 sizes larger than normal. I still give it a 5 star rating based on the swim suit itself, not on the sizing,  This is a very stylish and flattering suit. The colors are bold and pop.<br />I received this swimsuit at a reduced price for my fair and honest review. This is my opinion alone on sizing information,"
5.0,"It is very beautiful, I really like！"
5.0,Brooks is absolutely top-notch quality shoe with exceptional customer service!
5.0,"much prettier in person. nice size stones. set nicely in a very pretty setting, sparkles ,and looks great on,"
5.0,Great color exactly like shown in picture.<br />My daughter loved this hoodie.
5.0,Great for teenage girls. fits well on their wrists and looks so cute.
5.0,"Like the fact that the size is right,  fabric feels soft and they have the right amount of compression."
5.0,I love it! It is a toe ring but since I bought it in winter I can't really wear it. So instead I wear it as a mid ring and it's perfect there too!
5.0,This is pretty funny. Many compliments on it
5.0,Very durable bag. Hold both her ice skates and roller skates.
5.0,Use this on my harness.
5.0,"I really like this watch. It has all the features I was looking for and IMO looks great. I wear it every day and still have no scratches (I have had it for about a month now). I will note that I work in an office all day so it is not like I am very abusive, but I have accidentally knocked it into a few things and the face still has no scratches.<br /><br />As far as keeping time, I'm no expert, but as far as I can tell it keeps time perfectly.<br /><br />One thing to note is that the large second hand is for the stopwatch feature and not for keeping time. There is a small dial at the 9'oclock position that marks seconds. I think this is cool, but others may not like it."
5.0,"Love the cap, is low profile so no trucker look. Flag and skull is sewn in very good. I looked a long time to find a cap with flag that was flex fit and low profile. Is easy to find a flag cap, but tough to find low profile. Cap is 98% cotton and 2% polyester, great cap. I have had mine for about 10 months with wearing it all the time the cap still looks great except sun fade, but all caps do that over time."
5.0,Love the size and the charms. Best price ever. Great souvenir to commemorate 60th Anniversary of Disneyland and wedding of godson.
5.0,"Bought this to go with a Thor Halloween costume for my son, exactly what he wanted, he is six and it was a little big, but he lived it, felt like he was really holding Thor’s hammer lol. Let him play with it afterwards as it’s a soft foam, has held up for several months now."
5.0,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old sister. It's perfect for her, and she loves it, but it's not for a grown woman in my opinion. It's also smaller than I thought it would be, but again it's perfect for young girls. Good quality for the price, thumbs up from me."
5.0,Quality product and a fair price.
5.0,"These are one size fits most, but are a little on the small side. They fit perfectly for me, but I usually wear a 26/27 pant and am 5'4&#34; 125. I love the way they look and have gotten lots of compliments. If you are any larger than an 8 though, it may be a little tight on the top waist band."
5.0,Very nice and arrived as described and pictured. Will enjoy wearing
5.0,I am sure these are great earrings however they were stolen off of my porch before i got home from work.  No fault of the seller.  They look great in the picture though and arrived on schedule.
5.0,They r very cute. Comfortable and fast delivery
5.0,Great quality and So cute!
5.0,My daughter had good time with this at the beach
5.0,"Love this dress.  It's stretchy, comfy, has pockets & it looks good!  It's a rare find.  The stripes are strategically placed to give your body a visual leg up.<br />I got this in navy & olive green...can't wait to buy more."
5.0,Loved this wig for my Daphne costume. If it weren't so orangey looking I would wear it for more than just a costume.
5.0,This dress is perfect. Very comfortable. Loose fit without being too baggy. Will be buying in several colors! Love this dress. The cotton blend is super soft.
5.0,My wife kept losing her Samsung Gear when it would fall off without her knowing.We were lucky to find it each time. This band is much more secure.  Hasn't fallen off since.
5.0,I've been wearing these for a couple of weeks with a pair of black diamond earrings.  The backs prevent the posts from poking me and stay put even while sleeping.  These will keeps your favorite earrings safe.
5.0,They are nice!! Good quality for the price!!
5.0,"Fits loosely, fabric a bit lighter than I expected but comfortable.  You definitely need a shirt under for a cool day."
5.0,Nice product for dad and a perfect size. He He is a size 9-10 shoes and the slipper were size 12. Slippers run small.
5.0,Fit true to size and great quality
5.0,lovely top material is great
5.0,Soft and fits good they are good for around the house I am 5'2 135lbs
5.0,I got these as a gift for my sister and she loves them. They have a simple elegance that can go with any outfit which is what I wanted. She is a singer so I wanted her to feel like she could wear them wether preforming or just out with friends. Couldn't be happier.
5.0,They fit my husband perfectly and they're sexy to boot!
5.0,I love these moccasins....the fit is perfect and with the memory foam make these a comfortable moccasin. Well worth the money........
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter, who is a teacher, to wear at school.  She loves it and it looks darling on her.  For the price, we were very pleased."
5.0,I LOVE these earrings.. they are more beautiful than the photos and I'm very happy with this purchase.
5.0,"I like these aviator sunglasses. I wear the same style in an expensive brand and I have to say - I plan to use these just as much. These are comfortable to wear and polarized glasses really do make a difference. To prove this, the seller includes a little card with your glasses to show you the difference - it's amazing what you can't see without them! The frames on these are much sturdier than my everyday pair which I like as I'm not the most gentle with my sunglasses. Lastly the gray shade is very effective against the sun when I'm driving. I think these are great!"
5.0,Thank you!  Looks great!  Going to be a fun gift for my One Direction lovers!
5.0,"I am in love with these. They are the perfect length. Dress them up or wear them casual. I have bought mid sleeve, short sleeve and now working on long sleeve."

5.0,this one was in perfect condition and shape. quality of image was perfect!
5.0,"This pin is a wonderful add for any collection. It is well made, and made me giggle."
5.0,I liked that its a full suit and mask can be taken off. Size runs a little tight maybe.
5.0,These socks fit perfect. I love the feel of them. I am overweight and am trying to get back into shape. I walk every morning.
5.0,Socks were exactly what we were looking for.  My son wears a size 12.5 sneaker and they are not too small.
5.0,Love the fitting for a great price
5.0,I love this necklace & it looks even better in person. I wear it a few times a week and it dresses up any outfit.!
5.0,"I really like the simple shape and fit of this blouse.  Really nice quality for the price.  I often wear it with jeans, as a very nice version of a t-shirt, but it also looks dressy enough to wear with a skirt.  I often buy an x-small in t-shirts, or wear a size 2P in tops, and the small in this fits well."
5.0,true Lola quality ... true to size ...true high waist style
5.0,"Beautiful dress. I probably could have went down a size. 3x is what I  ordered based on reviews. I normally wear a 16/18 and I'm curvy. It had plenty of give so if you want a tighter fit, 2x. I'm also about 5 ft 2 so I tried it on with 4inch heels and the toes stuck out just a bit. Its fully lined from the cleavage down to about an inch or two from the bottom."
5.0,great quality and authentic !
5.0,"This is gorgeous!  I am a fan of &#34;heart&#34; jewelry and this is done beautifully.  It is simple and elegant.  It is not too small, but large enough to be noticed by admirers.  The silver is beautiful.  This was a wonderful purchase."
5.0,Lovely little earrings.  Recommended seller
5.0,Love them! Very cute and have a great lux look. Recommend and would purchase again. (They look more golden than what the picture shows.)
5.0,Cute! Had it for a couple years and still hasn't tarnished or lost any gems.
5.0,LOVE this sweater<br />Came on time & as expected<br />Perfect fit<br />Perfect Navy color<br />Love the sleeves<br />Great buy<br />Great price
5.0,Your true size fits like the model's does
5.0,"I love it.. Its a bit large, I love it..."
5.0,"Quality material. A little shorter than expected, but still good."
5.0,"This is a solid, spacious bag. The strap and lined material is sturdy, and the clear material is soft and flexible, and can be cleaned easily with a wipe or towel. I like the two shoulder strap option, or a longer, adjustable cross body strap. No issues with either zipper. I’d recommend."
5.0,"Beautiful, quality earrings . Daughter was thrilled . She has sensitive ears and these are quality, she wears them every day now."
5.0,Product arrived quickly. Item was as described. Pleased with this product.

5.0,"Good quality for the price- Very soft and good looking faux fur.  Wish the the &#34;hidden&#34; zipper pocket was hidden a little better and not so near the head. But, definitely a great product overall."
5.0,Reversed zip lock gives slick look and durable function
5.0,Great hat band but I'm going to use it on a new olive green fedora.
5.0,cannot get a better item for the money.
5.0,"I ordered these Merino wool jogger/sweat pants to wear on a trip to Iceland next spring. Amazon accidently sent Small, instead of the Medium I ordered. I am sending back the Small pair because the waist is a bit tight (and I'll reorder the Medium), but just trying them on I could see how cozy and comfortable they will be. I live in Minnesota and look forward to wearing them this winter - before we even go to Iceland!"
5.0,Fits with my controllers and works perefectly
5.0,Great masks. Run a bit small. Fun design.
5.0,Great sweater and great quality!! The Logo is great in the middle with the stitched logo!
5.0,SB socks are not very stuffy and provide good support for varicose veins.  They do reduce swelling on my calves.
5.0,"These are adorable!!! I love cacti, so these were perfect! Because it’s a one-size-fits-all product, it’ll sit differently on people’s faces. They were too big for my face, but I’ll still wear them! They do have a small wire over the nose so it can fit better! Hope this helps anyone!"
5.0,"Product was what’s to be expected a tie around the neck, face mask and headband"
5.0,Love these key chains! I have purchased 4 of them. They make a classy inexpensive gift🥰
5.0,Nice bow tie. Avoid pre tied ties as they stand no where in dressing.
5.0,"The release can be a bit sticky at times, so a slight improvement there would be nice - but the design, quality and fit are all top-notch!"
5.0,"The case looks exactly like it does in the picture,and the shell is really hard which is a good thing ! So far the case has survived being crushed under heavy school books in my backpack and also being dropped a few times,without getting damaged."
5.0,Great quality....
5.0,"Look good and very soft, very good buy"
5.0,i just love this jewelry. these earrings are the greatest. i've bought 2 other pairs...silver and silver twisted. they are my favorites and they stay put on my ears and don't bother me when i sleep.
5.0,I love this dress!  It fits somewhat larger than expected (it just had a hard time staying in place without moving around too much).
5.0,Original brand and everything on order.
5.0,Solid and not likely to break. Purchased it go a friend and she loves it!!
5.0,This shirt was perfect for my son and the fabric is so soft! Loved it so much hubby bought other colors for the little man as well!
5.0,Great looking and light weight. Love them
5.0,"Amazing mask, very cute and true to the image. It fits just a tiny bit loose, but it's a one size fits all and I'm a small female."
5.0,"Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion.<br /><br />That said, I am in love with this suit. I normally wear a medium, but ordered a large based on other reviews. I'm glad I did, because it fit perfectly. I'm 5'5&#34;, 140 lbs, and wear a 34B. The color and retro print are gorgeous, and it covers my &#34;mommy tummy&#34; nicely. I'm seriously considering buying it in black as well because I love it that much."
5.0,"This is super cute, makes your boobs look awesome too! The top fits great, the bottom is slightly too small but not too bad, the only thing I would like to improve is making the skirt stretched a little. There is absolutely no give"
5.0,Really very comfortable.
5.0,Awesome fit and delivered on time.Excellent Product quality
5.0,These cute and well made. One of my favorites!
5.0,"These handles are easy to attach, and they look nice.  They are nice quality, and the clasp rings on the ends are secure."
5.0,"Love Love Love this maxi dress. Although the material is on the thin side, it still looks amazing. You will definitely need to wear a tank top underneath to offset some of the sheerness. It fits properly and is appropriate to size and the length is great. Its long but not too long when it drags if you decide to wear sandals. Its a great spring and summer look. And definitely could be worn in the fall as well with a sweater or jacket. Will absolutely purchase more in different colors"
5.0,I love these! Arrived and look just like picture. I generally wear an extra large I ordered an extra large and they fit as expected
5.0,I love my over the shoulder clear purse that I will be using for my NFL game.  This meets all of the qualifications for NFL and my qualifications as well. Nice sturdy material yet bendable.
5.0,It’s hard to believe how uncomfortable a face mask can be in the heat. These are a notable exception. They are made for moisture wicking fabric similar to athletic dry fit. They pull moisture from your skin and breathe. I barely feel like I have anything on my face amazingly!
5.0,Love.  So soft.
5.0,"I had originally purchased one just to wear around the house, but liked it do well I ordered another one—to wear “out and about”! Well made and looks really pretty with sandals and a little jewelry. Hope they keep making these. I can’t wear polyester, so the rayon is great! Love the bright colors. I hand washed my dress, and let it dry flat. Looked wonderful."
5.0,Great fit and comfortable. Exactly what I expected!!
5.0,VERY COMFORTABLE.  I'm a shoe size 9.5 US.  I bought a large.  They still compress. They are very comfortable.  No issues. Would definitely buy again if the price was right.
5.0,"What a great retro piece to pay homage to the Black Mamba.<br /><br />I was expecting a cheaply made jersey, but really quality with each piece embroidered rather than printed.  These do run on the smaller side, so refer to the fitting chart to get the correct size.  I just wanted this to have it framed and hang it next to my Kobe Bryant print, which looks great."
5.0,It fixed perfectly
5.0,"Im 5'5&#34; 165 36DDD. Ordered a large.  Its not skin tight, but fitting to your body. I feel like its a little short, but that might be bc of my boobies. Very cute shirt!! Got the blue one."
5.0,"its a pretty color, very sturdy and the price is right. i would recommend to any one. i have all the colors"
5.0,My daughter used this jacket for her Amelia Earhart class presentation. The jacket is really good quality. If it my daughter who is 8 1/2 years old and pretty thin.  However it wasn’t too small on her or even too big . She could probably wear this jacket for another year or more
5.0,"Really confortable socks, like they are thick and at the same time they are comfortable with my shoes!"
5.0,These pins are the perfect length to keep sweaters in place!! I love them!
5.0,It fits. Most of headbands/earwarmers are too tight on me because my hair is pretty thick. This one fits and keeps my head and ears warm. I'll try not to lose it. I like the wider width. Quite satisfied.
5.0,"Liked the color and snowflake design. Used to purchase only dangling charms but soon realized needed to interspace dangling with ""separation"" charms."
5.0,My husband looks adorable. Thank you!!
5.0,"I love the sticky grips, and they work really well. Not for playing in the snow or subzero temperatures, but they were plenty warm slightly below freezing temps."

5.0,Grandkids loved them. Used as prides in piñata and went over great.
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this JNCVXN Samsung Galaxy Watch Compatible Replacement Watch Strap turned out to be. The Brown color option I received with the exposed stitching looks so attractive. The leather band also feels sturdy, but is comfortable on the wrist. I like that this band comes with quick-release spring bars which make watch strap changing without tools very easy. I also appreciate that this band comes with a black buckle which matches the color of my watch. Overall, I'm pleased with how well this JNCVXN Samsung Galaxy Watch Compatible Replacement Watch Strap turned out and would consider ordering the Black color option as well."

5.0,Amazing for the money
5.0,Love it!Great buy!
5.0,"This is such a cute dress.  Great material, not stretchy but I was amazed that it actually fit me.  I am curvy (small waist, big hips, thick thighs and a butt) and I was actually able to button it around my bottom half.  It wouldn’t button up all the way which is fine with me because I wasn’t planning to wear it buttoned all the way up anyway. I am a 36D and it stopped right at the bottom under my chest.  Love the 3/4 sleeve, I’m not a fan of long sleeves so this made me happy.  Love the tie around the waist too! I got it in black and now I want it in red too! I can wear this to work or out! It’s so versatile! As long as you know how to style it you can dress it up or down!"
5.0,I love these and not to high.

5.0,"This ring is BEAUTIFUL, it is elegant and boho but still sexy! The quality as far as I can see is great and the design is breath taking. I do want to pit out there that the ring it self is a bit short and the ball and flower are a bit Viber than in the picture BUT that was exactly how I like mine. Great buy do recommend"
5.0,"Great purchase, I use to have the Tiffany’s one however my keys were stolen and I lost it. I’m happy this one can replace it temporarily ❤️❤️"

5.0,I'm a men's XL and this shirt fits me very nicely. The material is wrinkle resistant and looks great right out of the dryer.
5.0,"Thicker, stretchy material that hides unflattering lines, but is a breathable material. Excellent dress that gives any body shape an hour glass illusion."

5.0,"The pants are great with the exception of the length.  I am not very tall.  It would be wonderful if these pants came in Short, Average or Long lengths.  The pants needed to be hemmed."
5.0,Normal belts with a set number of holes don't work for me and I always have to make another hole. This is perfect because the hole that you need is wherever you want.

5.0,My little girl loves this!
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for.  Delivered on time.

5.0,Love them and they are not see through
5.0,Absolutely love these! My only issue is I got all mediums and I definitely need smalls I’ll only wear these from now on
5.0,I have about a 24 inch circumference head so I chose the XL. The sizing guide was right. It fits tight enough to stay on but not so tight that it causes a headache after extended use.
5.0,I like it. Looks good on me
5.0,Great for the fall and winter ..
5.0,I like it! It fits perfect and it’s comfortable
5.0,Fit extremely well. Highly recommend
5.0,"Pretty, well made lanyard for my multiple keys for work. The break away helps me get the keys off my neck quicly and easily for use opening classroom doors or cabinets."
5.0,"This goggles were amazing, no fog, and crystal clear.. Carrying case was very nice with the inclu. accessories. The reason I am giving it one star is that unfortunately the bridge between the lenses was hurting my nose and I had a sensation that it was going to cut through my skin. I cannot blame the product for it, it is just my nose that is narrow at the base. Works better for people who have a wide and shallow nose base. I tried cutting it to reduce size of the bridge but that didn't work."
5.0,My husband loves these 💟 they were exactly what we expected.
5.0,"I was surprised on the quality of this product when I received it. It's great quality, even the chain. More than that it is authorized, so I wear it in uniform. Great product."
5.0,"Length is perfect, description was spot on, as well as the photo. For the price, I'm pleased with the purchase. 👍"
5.0,"I wanted something the same weight as a sweatshirt, but dressier. This jacket is exactly that. It's warm enough for a chilly spring evening and looks dressy enough to go to dinner.  It seems well made and looks great on.<br />The black is more of a heather black."
5.0,Thinner style light weight jacket looks amazing on my guy! Fast shipping-
5.0,Great knit sweater for the price (although it was $10.99 when I bought it). The neck hole is large so if you have small shoulders like me it won't stay up. But I don't mind the off-one-shoulder look.
5.0,"Arrived early, looks just as pictured and quality of tee was very nice, not thin and shapeless. Very pleased."
5.0,The pieces are very pretty. Have been wearing the diamond horseshoe for 2 days now. No sign of turning green. Gonna keep my eye on it but so far so good.
5.0,Lost count on how many times this has been played with.
5.0,I love the color and pattern and material. It’s gorgeous!!!
5.0,"Love them. Finding sunglasses is a challenge for my small head, but these look and feel great."
5.0,"Ok, this is a solid piece. Nothing flimsy about it.<br />As for pain relief, I had tendinitis in both my left and right elbow. I wore this on my right hand for about three weeks and it relieved a lot of the pain. I have now switched to my left and it is working as well."
5.0,"I ordered this item with 3 other items and I received this item first. Quick delivery, good product. I was very satisfied with this scarf and I'm planning to order more for Christmas presents. I was very pleased with how quick I got it."
5.0,They are beautiful and seem to go with just about everything. The photo doesn't do justice to the stone which looks blue and pink depending on the light. They remind me of an opal- very beautiful
5.0,"These work really well for hanging bags from flat-edged tables, desks, or counter tops."
5.0,"Great little set!  Super comfy, great material and beautiful tie die colors!  Totally worth the purchase!"
5.0,Perfect for my patio!!!
5.0,"These shoes are used in tne house as there is new carpeting. It is well  fitting shoe, also nice appearance as a house shoe.  I plan to order another pair"
5.0,"Love the colors. As described, Definitely worth the price. Scratch pretty easily though"
5.0,"I have worn these shoes to work everyday for almost a year now, and if I clean them up goes well with a t-shirt and jeans on the weekend. I cannot stress how great these are for the money, obviously they are skateboaring shoes so they are made pretty damn duriable."
5.0,Ordered this funky belt for my daughter. She is going to wear it with a tie-dyed maxi dress.  It was a little twisted but it is fine.
5.0,"Does great job for night driving, reduces headlight glare, seeing signs.  Great for an over-the-road truck driver, reduces eye fatigue."
5.0,"Robe is very comfortable, like a t shirt. Classic stripes. Very satisfied with purchase."
5.0,Great sunglasses-very lightweight and stylish!
5.0,I really appreciated all of the reviews about buying a size up.  My son love Minecraft and was very excited to get his Hoodie.
5.0,"I love the Pajama Gram nightgowns.  They are of high quality and very comfortable.  However, it has been trial and error for me to find the perfect style that fits me since I am only 5'3"".  I ordered one of their full length flannels with cute dogs on it, but it came all the way to the floor.  Was too long to be practical and I had to return.  I ordered this nightgown in blue, which is called a mid-length, and since I am short it comes a few inches above my ankle.  But that is perfect.  These do run large, so I ordered another one in red in the smaller size, knowing the body of the gown would be large enough.  Unfortunately, the upper arms were too tight to make for comfortable sleeping, so I had to return the medium and re-order the red in size large.  Since I found out this style and size is perfect for my weight and height, I decided to also order the green one.  Now I will have all three colors in the perfect style for my body shape.  I am 150 lbs in case that helps anyone pick the best size for them.  Even though these are expensive nightgowns, they are well worth it!"
5.0,omg I live for this bag ! The leather was amazing not cheap but luxurious. It came packaged in this box which is perfect for gifts or just to put it back in. The scarf is amazing quality! Run don’t walk and get this bag boo !
5.0,Authentic As described. Quick shipping. And I love the fit.
5.0,"Bought due to leg injuries and love these pants! Wore to doctor visits for ease of examination of my knees and legs. Super cute, comfortable, and practical. Great for summer heat if you're like me and not comfortable in shorts, too!"
5.0,I got these as a gift for someone and they really like the jewelry.
5.0,The brim of this hat is wide enough and stiff enough to shade baby's face. We sent for a second one and don't use the others we had that weren't as wide.
5.0,Love this patch and is perfect on my hiking bag.  Good quality and the lettering glows in the dark!
5.0,"quality Italian charm, was exactly what I expected"
5.0,I didn’t expect it but it was so good and convenient and I like the material so much And the size it was perfectly fit for me
5.0,"I'm super impressed with this watch -- looks very similar to a Skagen watch. To be completely honest, some of my coworkers have mistaken it for a several hundred dollar watch and were shocked when I told them the actual price. Highly recommend it."
5.0,cute and classic black color.
5.0,Worth the money. Cute colors
5.0,Nice quality very durable.
5.0,I ordered the white shorts in a size large. I have a 29” waist and I went by the size chart. They are so stretchy and they fit great!! I love them so much!! They are not too short and go right below my belly button. Perfect shorts
5.0,Most comfortable shoes ever!
5.0,"Personally I like the black one without the extra seams all over.  But if you are looking for compression tight for sports, all these color ones are excellent"
5.0,"Bought them for my daughter who is in the Ocean all the time paddle-boarding, swimming, kayaking and she loves the blue pattern and how light weight they are"
5.0,love it just to big
5.0,So soft and warm for my little guy!
5.0,"The strap is great. It's lightweight, durable and comfortable. I dropped my glasses in the lake and the strap saved them since it floats. Overall an excellent purchase."
5.0,"This is not something that will keep you warm. However if you are looking for a cool long sleeve that will keep out wind and keep you cool, this would be it. I like subtle grey on white pattern a lot."
5.0,Very pretty. Nice finish.
5.0,My daughter loves her sandals. They are easy to put on her and are made with solid materials.
5.0,I thought delivery was slow.
5.0,They were just as I imagined.  I have sensitive ears and these did not cause a reaction.  Just the right size.
5.0,It looks and fits perfectly! No problem at all!
5.0,Worked perfectly for what I was wanting. People were commenting on my cute necklace and didn’t even realize it was my Fitbit.

5.0,Fits my D-30 perfectly.
5.0,I love it and I love material
5.0,Who ever thought of buying shoelaces on Amazon? I didn't until I was desperate. You can get almost any size laces and they are really good quality. They measure exactly as advertised. Great job orthostep and amazon marketplace.
5.0,Arrived on time and as described. Happy with them and have held up very well so far.
5.0,They are very useful. I like the colors too. I will purchase these again when needed.

5.0,The body and arms are a bit longer than most. The boys like that.
5.0,Super soft and stylish!! Loved it!!
5.0,LOVE MY MINNIE SHIRT!!!  THE COLOR IS GREAT. Just what I wanted 💕

5.0,they’re exactly as described!
5.0,Can sometimes ride
5.0,Loved it but didn’t fit me
5.0,"Connects to my phone very easy. Tells me when to start heading to bed. Tracks sleep and breaks your bad habits. You have 3 alarm functions vibrate,beep, and shock you can use them independently or ask at once to guarantee that you wake up."
5.0,"This cardigan is beautiful! It's true to size, and fit me perfectly. It's so soft and comfortable, I love how long it is. You can wear it with dress clothes, or just a simple t shirt or tank top"
5.0,Perfect fit and comfortable with my leather dress shoes
5.0,"I wish the names were bigger, but cmon, you don't want anyone looking at your chest like that. I love mine!! And the cute ass box it comes in. Come on??"
5.0,"My son runs in these in the hot and humid St. Louis summers.  So many athletic shorts are double layered and down to the knees, which is horrible for running in the heat.  The built-in panty does not provide any support or compression, so my son cuts it out and wears a pair of mesh, athletic boxer briefs underneath.  It's the perfect combo of support and comfort.  He is 5' 11"", about 165 pounds, and we ordered off the size chart for waist and hips and they fit perfectly."
5.0,Mother in law love it
5.0,"This product is outstanding, My great granddaughter at 12 months wore this outfit all winter, her mother has been extremely happy and would buy this outfit again. I highly recommend this seller."

5.0,"This dress is AMAZING!!! Wow! I don’t like my tops to fit tight. I wear L for tops and size 8 or 10 in jeans. I got the XXL and it fit perfectly for me. Not too tight, but not too big either. The quality of the dress is top notch. This is no costume! It can be worn again and again. Fully lined. Stunningly beautiful. Accessories are really great, as well. The only change I had to make was that the headband medallion is gold and my dress is silver, so I made mine silver with clear nail polish, rhinestone large glitter pieces and hairspray (see photo). Everything else is perfect! BUY THIS SET NOW!"
5.0,"I didn't know i could fall in love with a pair of pants until now. I am in a romantic relationship with these pants and you are too.<br /><br /> You can wear these to any occasion. prom? slay 💅. Your dad's funeral? you might be bawling but even your dad's ghost agrees that you're killing it in those pants. we ball, slay 💅💅🫳<br /><br /> It's taking all of my self control to not buy immense amounts of these pants just so i can wear them constantly. if i were a main character, my main outfit would have these pants. Buy these pants immediately, you want to, you will not regret it.<br />(my child wrote this review, as i bought it for them. overall a 10/10)"
5.0,Fit true to size. Really pretty color.
5.0,Amazing product lasts long and i'm in love with it. It takes a little time to get used to wearing it for a loong period of time but overall its a would buy

5.0,Never owned 1 of these before. Work so well!
5.0,"Perfect!  exactly what I needed, fit is great, material comfortable with a bit of stretch. Contacted seller with a problem and they were wonderful, quick response and resolution. Excellent seller, would purchase from them again."

5.0,Beautiful & exactly as expected.
5.0,LIKE IT.
5.0,"Nice yoga pants. I love the length- not too short, but not down to the ankle. They have some tummy support, which I like. I have three pairs."
5.0,"Original silicone band that came with Fit Bit 2 Pro was not comfortable and hard to buckle. This band was easy to install on my Gear Fit 2 Pro and the tool sent to make band adjustments was great and worked perfect.<br />I would recommend this seller, and will buy from them in the future."
5.0,I love it I ordered a size up cus of reviews and glad I did only problem it is not long enough!
5.0,I love the quality of the material. It is very comfortable and soft and warm.
5.0,"I wear a lot of wrap skirts. I've gained & lost 70lbs while wearing wrap skirts. At any size, they wrap the same. You bring one side around and over the other side of the fabric & thread it through a loop, then pull the string from the other side around the other side of you & put that through the other loop. Tie where ever they meet on your body.<br /><br />Every single listing for a wrap skirt has confused people convinced the loops are in the wrong place or that it is somehow sized wrong.<br /><br />I wish I could go to each of your homes & show you how easy it is.<br /><br />I can't, so know, it's easy & this is a lovely skirt."
5.0,Nice stretchy fabric with a nice feel and look
5.0,Great pair of workout pants.
5.0,"I love it. thank you, and .....the price is great!!!"
5.0,Great! Usually I wear an xl in shirts and I ordered this in the Large since everyone said it runs big and its still very loose on me but its what I wanted! Beautiful colors and very soft shirt. Love it.
5.0,"Beautiful, modest and I love it! It's very well made and covers up nicely. Thank You."
5.0,Adorable and extremely well made.  I'll have to report fit whenever my pup will let try it on  her.
5.0,Provides great coverage from the sun and is adjustable to fit a growing baby.  It seems breathable and I'd recommend it.
5.0,I didn’t like the rubber bands that came with the fit bit because they were sweaty. This band is perfect and easy to wear. I love it
5.0,I love my newest pair of leggings from Leggings Depot.  I always receive compliments on the leggings when I wear them or any of my other pairs.
5.0,This purse has held up really well over several months. It doesn't scuff up when bumped against rough surfaces like some really cheap materials will. I've had the purse for almost 6 months and I'm just starting to see some fraying on the strap. I've crammed this bag full of everything from textbooks to water bottles and it's still held up.
5.0,It’s a good value for the price. It not very absorbent but that ok with me. I like that it’s light weight.
5.0,Love the color. The style. Very comfortable.<br />Thank you
5.0,It is great as long as you know what your buying. It's only plastic and will break if abused. It's perfect for toddlers I would say 5 year Olds and under.
5.0,"Well worth it. I bought these for my hair when I took my girls to Disney on ice. We dressed everything Minnie and they loved it!!! And they actually fit my ponytail and are very durable, I was surprised. I just knew with all of my hair and how thick it is they would snap & break and wouldn't work but not at all. I still have them for the next show!! And they came when promised"
5.0,"Mine is 95% Poly and I normally prefer cotton, but it is a very soft, comfortable polyester. I am 5 foot 2 inches tall and weight 188.  I ordered an Xxl and it hangs perfectly.  Loose enough to be very comfortable ( I have Fibro. and can't wear clingy things) but it is not so loose that it looks like a tent. It comes down just to the tops of my feet. The colors are very vibrant.  I washed it right away (my kitten peed on it !) , put it in the dryer and it still looks and fits the same.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  Just one note to the manufacturers---you need to put the pockets down a little lower.  I have bought other dresses with pockets and they all fall at the widest upper part of the hips."
5.0,Very good quality product... extremely easy to swap out. I'm planning on buying more.
5.0,"LOVE IT!!! I just pinned together the bottom edges of the side-seam pockets to pull in the sides of the garment and make it less billowy. On me, it looks better that way, and it's still very comfortable. I'm 5'2.5&#34; and 140 in my old age, so I got Large.  To my surprise, my  22-year-old very with-it granddaughter approved--she says, over-sized denim garments are very trendy just now!  Who knew being comfortable put one on the cutting-edge of fashion!<br /><br />So the system copied my review for the short-sleeve! That's fine, except that the long-sleeved item was more roomy.  So I tossed it into the washer on the &#34;casual&#34; (gentle) setting with cold water and put it into the dryer on low. Let it dry completely,  and it shrank just a bit so the neckline isn't as wide. I pinned the pockets of this one also to cut the billow effect, and it's very comfortable. Looks good, too!"
5.0,The earrings look wonderful! It arrived on time with no damage with good packaging.
5.0,Large size is comfortable for large heads/ wide face. Gaskets snap off for cleaning. The swastikas are easily removed with a direct pull from pliers.
5.0,Very comfy! This is the only headband I've worn that doesn't give me a headache after a couple of hours.
5.0,"Really happy w/ it.  Easy to install, came immediately and most importantly, the band is supple so it will be comfortable. Got it on my Huawei Watch 2 Sport."

5.0,Only needed the bow tie and that was worth the price so the pocket square and cufflinks were a sweet bonus.  Bought this for my husband to wear at our son's &#34;bow tie birthday bash&#34; and it worked out perfectly.
5.0,This seals your face well. The way it lays let’s you feel the coverage. Light weight and durable. Well made. Feels comfy.
5.0,Cute & colorful
5.0,"Kitties RULE!!!!!  This little scarf is adorable and very classy.  I love to put scarves on over a black, white or any other mono color to get a POP<br />of color and sophistication.  You will love this if you are a kitty lover.  It isn't loud or overly colorful and garish.  It is very delicate and soft.  Have<br />fun with your wardrobe.  :-)"

5.0,"Great little black dress! I’m 5’1, 139 36 B and the medium fit great! I was comfortable with the length in front and there was some stretch that wasn’t used. Wore with support hose and no shape wear and the shape of the dress and ruching were flattering."

5.0,"This hat exceeded my expectations of it.  It's a higher quality than I expected from the price.  The color is very nice, it fits well and is very light.  Very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,I was so pleasantly surprised when I received this top. I thought it was worth taking a chance because of the price.  I think it’s flattering and very pretty.  I got the XL - I normally wear a size 12.  The cotton is quite thin and it’s a little bit see-through so I will wear a camisole under it.
5.0,"Super cute, super soft and nicely made. Doesn’t fade or peel after multiple washes and drying in the dryer. I bought a similar “ghost” shirt along with this. True to size and very comfortable!"
5.0,Good quality dress for the price.. My daughter really likes it.. She is going to wear it for school picture day..Looks same as pictured..

5.0,Great support specially when having flat feet and they are very soft and comfortable
5.0,Will  be ordering more!

5.0,Gave as a gift and well recieved. Looks great.
5.0,"I have good things to say about this product. it was a long wait but worth the extra time.I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd  and David Gilmore  now. I miss Roger, Rick, and the greatest drummer in rock music."

5.0,"I got this as a gift for a Browns fans, he thought it was really nice, the quality was good and washed well."
5.0,"I'm very happy with these handkerchiefs. They're just the right size, large enough to last a day of allergic rhinitis and small enough to use discreetly. With my old larger handkerchiefs, sometimes it felt as if I was pulling out a bedsheet for my runny nose. On top of that, the decorative corner gives them a pretty touch."
5.0,"I love them and they fit perfect! If they come in different colors, I will buy more! Thanks!"
5.0,"I bought these as a gift for my best friend and she adores them! She gets a lot of compliments on them and they're really cute. A lot of reviews complain about cracks etc. in the stone, but anyone who knows genuine stones knows that it's just a part of nature. One of them did have a little line inside but no one is complaining, it adds to the authenticity and cuteness!"
5.0,Comfortable for running
5.0,This dress hugs in allllllllll of the right areas.<br />So you better have the motts to wear it 😂🤣😂🤣
5.0,WOW! I ordered JJ Perfection and ViViiKay brand. This fit perfectly and felt smooth against my skin. I returned the other brand and ordered a whole bunch more colors. Totally worth the cost!
5.0,Ordered XL in the black at 5'4 180lbs. Fits beautifully. I absolutely love it!
5.0,Great with my summer wardrobe
5.0,"This hat was perfect for my daughter this summer. I thought it would not fit, but it is a perfect fit. I love how she can wear the hat 2 ways and that the bow is removable. The packaging was standard, it did not have any funny smells. package arrived quickly. The hat does not feel or look cheap at all. I would purchase again in a different color.

5.0,"I've bought so many of these dresses for myself and as gifts.  The colors and prints are terrific.  I think they run true to size. I notice some people who are about 5' tall complaining about length. I'm that height and find a new one I am wearing right now is knee length, but dresses I've worn and washed are shorter.  These are super comfy for hot humid summer days and go well with capri leggings if you don't want the mini skirt look."
5.0,Fits as expected and love the color and style.
5.0,"Great fabric, wasn't cheapy costume fabric, well made and has boning. We altered it and she wore a corset underneath for a better fit. Was pleasantly surprised by the good quality. She wore a hoop petticoat for proper fullness and we hemmed it so she wouldn't trip."
5.0,"This review is written by a 7 year old. My dad got these for me and I love them!!! They are worth it. They delivered on time,and are a great alternative to Ray-Ban’s!"
5.0,Great wave product!<br />My kid wears it every night!<br />It works!
5.0,"I am a huge fan of Supernatural - Dean Winchester in particular - and I wear this pendant almost every day. I ordered mine in the Antique Gold finish, and it looks just like the one in the show. It's very well-designed, and both sides are the same. The finish has faded a little over time, so now it looks more like brass than gold, but somehow that has only made it look older and more authentic. It's also pretty heavy, so it hangs exactly where it should and doesn't flop around.<br /><br />The only thing to be careful of is the cheap quality of the rubber/plastic cord. It is not very sturdy, and broke into two pieces soon after I bought it. I replaced it with some black cord from the craft store, though, and it's held up much better. The charm is what I really care about anyway, and it's very nice. Highly recommended for any SPN fan!"
5.0,I bought this for my dance instructor to use in a show performance. It fit her perfectly and was exactly what we needed.
5.0,Gave as a gift and my sister loved them.
5.0,worth it. really cute
5.0,"For my advanced speech class, I needed a U.S. flag lapel pin for my presidential inauguration speech. The 1&#34; length is the perfect size when pinned on a suit lapel. When pinned, it feels secure and does not move much at all. Regarding the quality, the shiny gold tone looks great with a deep blue or black suit. Great quality overall, and a great value for a low price!"
5.0,Material is soft and thick.  Very warm.
5.0,This hat is cute. Keeps her head warm and very soft.  It is a bit big for a 3 year old but works.
5.0,Love it a lot. It's great. Just wish the strap went a little bit shorter.
5.0,"After rotator cuff surgery I could not move my arm. This shirt saved me!  I could actually put a shirt on with a sleeve!  It was a life saver in helping me feel ""normal"" during recovery."
5.0,"Beautiful, flattering dress. Hugs your body in all the right places. I am 5 ft 4 in and weigh about 125 and purchased a medium. I was impressed with the quality. I bought this for a work gala and received a lot of compliments."
5.0,"First off, I got this for $5.99! The day after I ordered it, it went up to $17.99 and now it’s $10.99. So weird. The outfit fits my baby girl so well! The shorts are so soft! So cute and comfortable. My little one is very sensitive with fabric and anything too tight, too baggy, too itchy, etc. She loves these! I pair them with other shirts too! Isn’t animal print a neutral?!! The white shirt is super cute. A little more stiff, but not a deal breaker. It doesn’t bother my girl, and it matches other shorts and skirts. I really love the outfit! My girl is a 3t, but has long legs. She is skinny. So she could wear a 2t if her legs were shorter! But the fit worked well for her! I will buy other patterns once I see another sale lol! Though I’d definitely pay $11 for the outfit."
5.0,Loved this skirt. Fit perfectly true to size
5.0,My husband loves them. Good quality
5.0,very high quality leather
5.0,"Great quality,  easy to use and love the color"
5.0,"I live in a location that gets a nice long winter period. Since I do outdoor activities every day I often am out when it is cold. This jacket adds the ability to provide a bit of extra warmth when needed. I found the jacket to be warm and comfortable, even without having the heating system on all of the time. It has been a good solution for the long period of cold days."
5.0,"Had surgery before vacation to Jamaica and couldn't get sun on the wounds, these were perfect plus my wife loved they way they looked on my shoulders"
5.0,The boots fit perfectly.  The boots did not come up as high on the calf as we thought the would.  But they are ok.
5.0,"Very cute dress!! I love the vintage style. Only issue is that the picture makes it appear as a full circle skirt. The dress is more A-Line. However, still adorable!"
5.0,Got it for my mom. And she loves it b/c it doesn’t look cheap
5.0,Love this beanie!! It's super warm and comfortable! Love the colors and the beanie is thick and cozy!!
5.0,"We ordered my daughters standard clothing size and it fits perfect.  The color was off a little.  We ordered what looked like a blue, but it is more purple.  But, it will still work"
5.0,My 4 year old really liked this tee shirt.  Children do not appreciate sarcasm.  Which is good sometimes.  I enjoyed the holiday theme.
5.0,Fun girls night out dress didn’t fit me perfectly but it got the job done
5.0,"Very neon, which is what I wanted! very cute summer dress"
5.0,I was looking for a nice band to wear to work and found this nice leather one. It fits comfortably on my wrist and looks very professional. It also came with a protector case for the watch face which is a matching rose gold color. Would definitely recommend Shia product! Good quality and not too expensive.
5.0,I purchased the camouflage. Super comfy and slimming. Cannot see through and holds everything in. Totally worth the money.
5.0,"Small and cute, gave one to my best friend before she moved to another state!"
5.0,Works great in this heat. Thanks.
5.0,"Just received the items. Have not used them very long, therefore decline to rate durability."
5.0,Love this shirt!  Looks great on!
5.0,Perfect for party favors. Came in individually sealed babes.
5.0,Fits the Mira flex good. The strap even at its tightest isn’t really snug around my three year olds head. Easy to put on. I thought the price was a little steep for only one pair. I did order two pairs. It does the job.
5.0,"Very nice. Great quality. Strong zipper. Plenty of room for the basics. Large cell phone, credit cards, cash, coins, pen, key fob, business cards, lip gloss and office key. It fits inside my whopping big purse and it’s easy to grab for my quick trips. Love it."
5.0,Just as described.  Fit is accurate to sizes.  Overall great product.
5.0,"The Cuff is substantial and rugged, a very pleasant surprise.  It feels good and looks even better when wearing it.  I would highly recommend it."
5.0,The right size and convenient to carry and to wear
5.0,"This outfit is super cute. I'm 38DD and I ordered XL, it fits perfect. The pants also fit  great, but I wish they would suck in my belly a little more. Pants are a little loose around the belly because they are not tummy control.  My 8 year old asked me if I could get a set for her because she loves it on me  :)"
5.0,"This is the best waist trainer I have tried so far. It's comfortable, and you forget that you are wearing it."
5.0,My dad tried these socks on and compared it to other running and compression socks he had. These appear to be higher and cover the knee slightly on his 5'7 frame. They have a nice soft feel and the top cuff is smooth and not too tight on top.
5.0,This dress is nice and I followed the reviewers on the buying guide. Fits nicely
5.0,Nice hat.  Arrived promptly.  Good subtle gift at a 60th birthday.
5.0,"I have used the glasses for about one week while on the computer at night.  I notice a difference with the blue light blocker and will not be without computer glasses anymore!  Spring hinge, not a tiny screw for the ear piece which is nice, they fit better.  Good value for the set and nice that you can purchase with reading strength or none at all."
5.0,"Perfect for baby with eczema, especially if they have really bad eczema."
5.0,Look awesome! I usually wear size 3-5 in junior size jeans and a medium fits great!
5.0,Overall my daughter loved it quality was good a little smaller wrist size than expected but very pleased.
5.0,"Se ven más resistentes que la original, solo tiene un orificio."
5.0,"This little pin makes me smile every time I wear it. My students love it, too. Piggy looks great grouped with other small enamel pins on a cardigan."
5.0,Just what I expected. Looking good in shadow box. 101st all the way.
5.0,"Wore this to Disneyland and it was great. Durable, comfortable and I got lots of compliments on how cute it was."
5.0,"This is a great bag, wonderful quality."
5.0,"All gems were securely in place, item was exactly as expected."
5.0,My husband loves it! Its different and cool
5.0,"Excellent watch for the price.  Although, smart watches is the future and this things will be obselete.  All they do after all is tell time."
5.0,sister likes them
5.0,Very nice 👍🏽
5.0,"For the price, these are great sunglasses."
5.0,I ordered these for our groomsmen to wear with their tuxedos in my wedding.  They looked great on everyone for the day and still do.
5.0,Bought 11 of these for a group of friends at a Country music festival. They're awesome! Everyone loved them despite it being a little hard to see with them on
5.0,My niece loved this hoodie! It fits kind of snug but the color and style were as pictured.
5.0,Very comfortable and stretchy.
5.0,I love the pink tint these sunglasses have
5.0,This quickly became one of our favorite hoodies. I bought another one in a different color.
5.0,As a gift for my son-in-law who just bought a new boat
5.0,Love this dress so much. Great fit.
5.0,It’s actually really good quality! I was hesitant to buy it since it didn’t have reviews and I’m the type to not buy things without reviews. My friend convinced me to get it so we could wear it for our holiday party and we LOVE IT! The dress is breathable and the hat fit my head perfectly. I will say the shoes are a little small for me lol or they’re just kind of weird and won’t stay put. I’m 110 pounds 5’2 and the small was a good fit with a lot of breathing room!
5.0,Very beautiful rose.  My sister loved it
5.0,Just what I was looking for - well made and a great price
5.0,We received the orange one and it's so cute. Very happy.
5.0,These earrings are so cute! Really good quality I am completely satisfied

5.0,These are adorable and I love the small pearl on the side. Highly reccomend!
5.0,"Soft, cotton, fit like knee highs and my swollen legs love them!"
5.0,I bought these for my jewelry business--they are good size and good quality.  I would highly recommend.
5.0,Muy bonita prenda
5.0,I enjoy the lace around the top because it also covers up my arm in lose shirts. They’re long enough and don’t ride up!
5.0,This works really well. It not only cleans your eyeglasses but it keeps them from fogging up while wearing a mask. Will purchase again.
5.0,"Mint color was as pictured, and the tie feels solidly constructed. Matched girlfriend's dress for a wedding perfectly. No complaints, would definitely buy again."
5.0,"I have several of these in different colors. This is my favorite for travel. It's lightweight, but perfect for those over-air conditioned buildings and cold planes. I get compliments all the time. Very good product."
5.0,"I bought this for my 18 year old, and she loves it. Really pretty, durable, who doesn’t love a Swatch!?!<br /><br />My only issue is that my daughter is a small frame, so the watch is big on her wrist but we’ve yet to find one that isn’t. That’s not the maker’s fault for sure. Just be aware if you’re purchasing for a smaller person."
5.0,"I wear some Reef Spinikers, [[ASIN:B00JQNOJI6 Reef Men's Spiniker Mid Nb Fashion Sneaker, Chocolate, 10 M US]]that I love, regularly, and need socks that don't stick up above the shoe, so I can wear them with shorts. These work perfectly for that purpose. They still stick up a bit above low top shoes, however."
5.0,"Love the shape! Just dark enough! The size for me is perfect, i like glam shades! A bit heavy but they don't leave much of a mark on the nose."
5.0,Wife loved them. Came with a soft case and cleaning cloth. Can’t beat the price.
5.0,"Really nice shades, clearly not the real deal but they do what they are meant to and are very fashionable and sturdy."
5.0,Using as a maternity outfit and easily able to breastfeed
5.0,I purchased these for my daughter who plays softball outside.  Perfect for sun protection but even better for warmth!
5.0,I purchased this swimsuit hoping it would be kind to my post-pregnant body and it is! Very flattering swimsuit.  True to size. If you are looking for a swimsuit that is comfortable and feminine but you can still get down and play with your kids and feel confident your covered - this suit does that.
5.0,I have bad anexity and pick at my fingers when I'm out and about. Ingot this ring to help with that. And it works amazing. The sunflower spins so I'm able to spin that instead of pick at my fingers. It's a one size fits all kinda of ring. It's really beautiful as well. And I love the saying inside also as that's something I always say to the kids. The sun flower is a bit off your skin I'm assuming to make it easier to spin but it's not high enough your getting it caught on stuff thruout the day.
5.0,"This is the 2nd Mini Focus watch I have purchased and just like the first, this one is awesome. Looks great, feels great. Really like the silicone band and the watch itself looks very cool. I own 15 different watches and though not the most expensive by any means, the Mini Focus watches really stand out. I will be looking for more. Great buy!"
5.0,So frilly and feminine.  Perfect addition to my long dress.
5.0,Beautiful and awesome quality
5.0,"A little flimsy, but they are slim, unlike normal A watch bands, but great for the price."

5.0,"These are so cute, great wintertime earring."
5.0,Really nice and soft scarf and the colors are nice as well
5.0,Bought as a gift and it was well liked
5.0,So pretty. Great price. Lots of shine
5.0,Love them. We are members of the Walmart + club and do self check out so we pack our groceries as we go. They are sturdy and easy to unpack and pack back up.
5.0,Very sturdy hat for the price.
5.0,They are really pretty. When I wear them I hat complements or at least the earrings do
5.0,"I love these. Two for the price of one, and white! I use these on my cell phone for as cross body security.  They are strong and work well."
5.0,Fashionable and so awesome to have the little readers. No one sees that little secret unless I point it out and then they want a pair too! Great price.
5.0,"Just as expected , fits my wife nicely and she is comfy"
5.0,"THE COTTON VERY SOFT. LOVE, LOVE THE COLOR."
5.0,Nice shipping and really good quality
5.0,Looks cute and kinda Christmasie
5.0,Fits well and super cute. Nice velcro closure makes putting them on and off a breeze. Looks to be made from quality materials and will probably last longer than they will fit my fast-growing grandson.
5.0,I love it! Detail wonderful!
5.0,Cute. Perfect length and size.
5.0,"The mask is beautiful, comfortable, and very protective with its removable filter.  Excellent purchase."
5.0,What a beautiful dress! Loved the color and style<br />Arrived on time
5.0,I love these sunglasses!<br />They fit my face perfect and I haven't seen anyone else with anything like them!<br />Very sturdy too!  Might end up purchasing another pair in  a different color in the future.<br />Great price too!
5.0,"a little on the expensive side, but i also really love it."
5.0,"This outfit fit perfect, it's really good quality, and my daughter loved it and didn't want to take it off. The wast band is very stretchy so it wasn't tight."
5.0,I love this outfit. I got an XL and it fit just how I like. It was so soft & comfortable. It was actually nice & warm when I went to LA for the BTS concert. I also got so many compliments on my outfit from other ARMY as well. I even sent the info to my husband so he can get me the black one for my bday/Christmas 💜💜💜
5.0,"Got this wallet four months ago and have been carrying it daily. I typically go through wallets quickly, I am a big guy and I keep my wallet in my back pocket so it takes a lot of abuse.  This one is very durable and looks really good, still looks brand new. The compartments are the right size for cash and cards, does not cause cards to bend like other wallets I have had in the past.  If it ever wears out, I am definitely getting this one again."
5.0,It fit product was exactly as advertised.
5.0,"I love this dress! I am 4'10"" and this fits me perfectly. I think I want to purchase this in black and white."
5.0,Great coin as the meetings I attend give out keychains. Durable and a very nice coin.
5.0,great band for the price. Tool was handy. It came with 4 extra pins. I used my old ones as they seemed a little more robust. good buy. I am happy.
5.0,"These being 100% pure cotton, are very comfortable. The stitches are durable. Because there is no nosepin, they can be machine washed. The prints, colors and designs and cute and pleasant on the eyes. My kid wears it to school and keeps it on for 8 hours straight without feeling suffocated. Therefore excellent breathability.<br />The adjusters for the ear loops are good quality and don't slip off easily. I push them all the way inside away from the open end before I toss them for a wash to keep them from falling out. Overall great product. Super satisfied."
5.0,The beads are well strung and I like the strong elastic so I can wrap them around my wrist or wear them around my neck. The sandalwood smell is nice and one of the reasons I bought them. The removable charm is good quality and has a lobster clasp. Very nice.
5.0,"I wear a 6-8 and the medium fit, with some extra room. The added length was good for my height of 5’6”, compared to the small. The yellow is a great golden color. Dress is fully lined! Great dress for the $!"
5.0,"I've been looking for size SMALL gloves to use with Compression stockings that need this kind of grip.  I took me quite awhile. to find the.  was happy to buy them in quantity since I use them daily and will need them for a long long time.  They ca work for other things as well, so are versatile, but my main purpose was for application of compression stockings."
5.0,"This pattern is amazing, the shirt is well constructed, and it looks great with a pencil skirt. It looks like an expensive brand. I would size down a bit, as it was slightly bigger than I would want, but I am still extremely impressed and pleased."
5.0,"I bought this for my son . He travels a lot and this will be more convenient then the typical toiletry bag.The colors are nice. The zippers work well, which is always key. The bag is the perfect size foe all your needs. I'm happy that I bought this.

5.0,"I had high hopes for this item and it did not disappoint! We have a battle this time of year in our house because I get cold super easy but my husband runs warm and likes to have the windows open as often as possible. That's where this little gem comes in! I put it on and it warmed me up in a couple of minutes. It's well-constructed and even though it's thick, it doesn't feel bulky at all. I wore it for hours and was perfectly warm the whole time. I love the huge pocket in the front. Not only does it keep my hands warm but I can carry my phone in it. It's really roomy as well. I'm a larger size 5' tall and there a lot of room when I put it on so I moved very freely without it twisting or bunching up. The hood keeps my head warm...and let's face it, it's just adorable! I would highly recommend for anyone who gets cold easily this time of year."
5.0,Very cute outfit and my daughter loved it.

5.0,"Best strapless dress EVER!! Thick enough that I can go without draws. So cute, got so many compliments when I wore it."
5.0,"I absolutely love this, you do have to put a thin coat of clear nail polish to prevent the plating from wearing off but thats easy.<br />I also bought some matching chain to switch out, the chain it comes with is too delicate for my destructive self lol."
5.0,Purse not shoes
5.0,"This dress is fun and flirty! Being lager busted, I usually don’t buy these types of dresses as I don’t like for it to “all hang out” but this little number fit just right without my entire chest showing. I love the fun flow of the dress and the belt!!"

5.0,"This is a very cute turkey keychain. It's well made, does not feel flimsy, and the colors shown here are true to the actual keychain.<br /><br />It's about 1 1/4 inches at its widest point and about 1 1/2 inches long. The turkey decoration is one-sided, with the back of the ornament a plain silver finish.<br /><br />This would make a nice gift if you have any turkey-loving friends or family. It comes in a nice pouch."
5.0,This set is comfy and stylish and fit is on point!
5.0,"fun, fun, fun"
5.0,"I ordered two of these, one of each design. One has a higher Hem In the front and the other has a satin trim on the top of the nightgown. The one with the higher hem in the front was very large, I like it because it’s comfortable and flattering.  The one with the satin trim is also very nice and has an even hem, and fits all the way to my anckes, is very comfortable but fits much tighter. I am pleased with both of them and will wear them frequently and they are exactly what I had hoped for them to be. Although I would probably order the one with the higher hem in the front a size smaller since that one ran quite large. I recommend both styles and will probably order these again."
5.0,Beautiful dress. Cotton material. It really is exactly like the picture and as described<br />I am extremely happy with my purchase.<br />I am a 6/8 and I purchased a medium. Fits perfectly!
5.0,"Love them!  I was worried that I should have ordered size small, but when they came, the medium size was absolutely perfect for me.  (I am 5'5&#34;, 115 lbs.)  And you can't beat the price!"
5.0,Came way earlier than expected
5.0,Love this boot!  Comfortable
5.0,What more do you need to know?
5.0,Great quality for the price and my 3 year old Grandson thinks they are &#34;comfy&#34;.
5.0,"Very beautiful watch, no brushed areas on the case or band, it’s completely polished.<br />Unique and intricate steel bracelet with great divers extension.<br />Super accurate movement with an 80 hour power reserve.<br />The included leather strap is a nice touch.<br />Day and date complications are color matched to the dial."
5.0,Best padded socks ever!  I'll be buying more of these.
5.0,Super cute ring. Perfect fit and very comfortable on ur finger
5.0,"I loved the dress, it was a thick enough material to hold your shape nicely. Good quality!"
5.0,"I bought this dress to wear for my college graduation, and I think it will get the job done. I'm graduating from University of Houston so I needed a true vibrant red. I ordered the &#34;dark red&#34; color and it is a hair bit orangey, but I still love it. I'm 5'10 and 193 lbs, and it is quite short especially with the heels I'm planning to wear for the ceremony. I'm not worried though because my robes will cover it. If you're a tall girl, definitely plan to wear flats only with this!"
5.0,Applied to an old pair of Mephisto Marlons & they sprung back to life! Good product & from all appearances a good company. I'll continue to support them.
5.0,"LOVING!! The stone is very nice and shiny! It is adjustable for length with a slider, so you can choose any length you want. I highly recommend buying it!"
5.0,"I’ve been trying to explore small stores on amazon lately instead of my usual big ticket stores. Across this dress and decided to go for it, and I’m happy that I did. Very appealing colors, bright but not overpowering. I’m 5’10 and 198lbs (most weight in tummy after baby) I purchased a medium, it passes my knees, causing a fit very much like the model. Very good stretch, nice weight to the material and not see through at all. It came with the belt, but I believe I will use a wide-width belt when the time comes. Overall, worth the price."
5.0,Great fit and well made...fabric is very comfortable...
5.0,I love this shirt! Sass just like me!
5.0,Very stylish nightcap keep your hair from breaking and they look good I wear mine to the store school and everywhere else they are so pretty and stylish

5.0,"I'm in love with this product. Fast shipping, and GREAT quality. No pain/discomfort, I can't even feel it. Easy to slip on and it surprisingly stays on! (Although I wouldn't advise sleeping with it on.) Received so many compliments on this little guy :) Would def purchase again!!!"
5.0,"Comfortable, warm, easy to use"
5.0,Wonderful pajamas...worth the wait though the arrival took nearly a month and I was afraid they were lost enroute.

5.0,"What you see, is what you get. My packaged arrive as the same charms as in the original photo! Great detail of the image, compared to other sellers that I have bought from. Definitely a great value!"
5.0,"Originally bought this as a Halloween costume accessory, but it also works great year-round! It is excellent for keeping my toddler's head warm in the cold weather."
5.0,"This Mask Support really works, stay in the mask all the time, allow me to breath perfect without compromising the safety of the mask. Really  useful."
5.0,"Beautiful pashmina for work, light, and comfortable."
5.0,My son loved them true to size and they don’t look cheap. They survived machine wash
5.0,"Awesome shirt I love it, it's not transparent at all. Cloth feels great and makes you look slimmer."
5.0,I love this shirt. I have it packed away for next summer
5.0,My birth stone and  not heavy.
5.0,My son loves wearing this while playing! It's very good quality. We have had it 3 months and still in great shape!
5.0,"Though these were larger than I expected, very comfy and will keep wearing them"
5.0,Very good material and well designed/build for just a fraction of the price for same items with same product.
5.0,So Elegant!
5.0,"Gorgeous and delicate. Bought this as a christening gift for my goddaughter, everybody loved it."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful earrings! These are a gift for my daughter. She will love these! Beautiful crafting and very exceptional gift boxing. It even includes a soft little sterling silver cleaning cloth!
5.0,great flip flop
5.0,Adorable outfit!!! Will be perfect for a Halloween party. Looks like it’s made well!
5.0,They work well for my project but I wish there were some that were larger which would work even better for me!
5.0,"Such a pretty dress! I just got it a few minutes ago and I tried it on. I got size large and it fits great across the chest, the buttons are not pulling or bulging. The length is good to me. It looks a bit sheer but I will be wearing the appropriate underpinnings. The price was great, I couldn’t pass it up."
5.0,Very cute looking and very comfortable.
5.0,"My daughter asked me to make her a tulle skirt. This was cheaper than buying the tulle and the quality is excellent. She is 5'3 and she says the skirt is just a little long, but it meets her needs."
5.0,"I really like better the trail series than the one cushion running shoes normal type. This are softer and have more built to it. The toe off is nice, I would definetively recommend this to any one that looks for a nice trail shoe with cushion and comfort"
5.0,"The sizing chart provided is EXACTLY CORRECT. This dress looks great on, the material has a little give so it is very comfortable. Very flattering cut. There is no petticoat to make it flare as much as I would like but it does flare nicely at the bottom. For the price it is well-made.<br />I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE."
5.0,I've ordered these before so I know they will loosen up. I like these shoes that is why they are my 2nd pair
5.0,"These socks we’re the perfect gift for my husband and sons. Being huge Penguin’s fans, they proudly wear them for all occasions!"
5.0,Only one pair of earrings in the package.
5.0,"I completely did not expect this to work for me (32DDD/34DD over here) but I believed all the positive reviews and thank god I did! I tried this on for my first wedding dress fitting and it is perfect. Not the most comfortable thing in the world, but a lot better than what I expected and it gives the perfect amount of cleavage. It does not nip in the waist/stomach though- so if that is what you're looking for as well as backless support- this isn't the tree you want to be barking at."
5.0,Exactly like the picture.  I really love it!  Haven't worn it yet. But very very cute!
5.0,Love this bra! The Stickiness lasts
5.0,"As depicted, and arrived prior to stated delivery date."
5.0,"Es una joya hermosa, elegante y bella Puedo sugerirle que la compren y el resultado será una auténtica felicidad"
5.0,"I recieved these badges for Valentines day, and I could not contain my excitement. I wear a different one on my sweater each day. I am in love with these adorable little badges! And they are incredibly secure! I was afraid that they wouldn't stay, but they have lasted the whole school day rubbing against my backpack strap and all the movement I do during my out of school activities. I have absolutely no fear that these will fall off! One of the pins has a slight flaw, but its still wonderful. These beautiful badges are fit for any Pokémon fan!"
5.0,"These socks are perfect for the Giant fan.  My husband wore then during the end of season, didn't help the giants will but my husband's feet were nice and warm."
5.0,"I'm 5' 3&#34;, around 125-130 lbs, and I purchased a medium. It fits as expected -  a little flowy and comfy. Even if I had gotten a small I doubt this product would have been tight. (I wear a 34B, and I am only wearing a thin padded bralette in the pictures, and I have a 27&#34; waist for reference). I should probably gone for a small, but am not unhappy with a medium. It is a thin and very soft fabric, but not see-through. It isn't a true crop top, but stops right about where non-high-waisted jeans would start. I haven't washed it yet, but based on the fabric, I could see it shrinking some. Will probably dry right away it in hopes that it shrinks up a tiny bit."
5.0,my granddaughter loves this leotard.  she didn't want to take it off except to sleep for about 5 days!
5.0,"This costume was exactly what I was looking for, especially with the longer length."
5.0,Very nice.  Got it for my son.  He loves it
5.0,Pretty and cool for hot months.  It is modest enough without being heavy or voluminous.
5.0,"I love the colorful pattern and design, just the right size to tuck a water bottle in the bag too."
5.0,My son loves this alarm clock.  Thanks for making it available for purchase!
5.0,I ordered a size up
5.0,The bright colors are great for identifying your luggage. Well made.
5.0,Good fit ! On time. Good quality
5.0,Terrific compression. No swelling of my legs and they didn't feel fatigued
5.0,Handle moisture well and fit great. Can wash multiple times a week because of the synthetic material; no fading or peeling so far from the writing on the back.
5.0,"Very pretty dress, well made, and very flattering.  Fits beautifully."
5.0,Wore this mask to the doctor and received several comments!! I love it!! Comfy and uniquely stylish.
5.0,Good quality and fast-and-prompt delivery.
5.0,"Beautiful scarf !! So soft ,my daughter is 13 n she will love this!! I was afraid I wouldn't get by Christmas but I sure did a week before when it said I'd get Jan.19th.. very happy with this purchase , I'll probably purchase more for my daughter and as gifts amazing price for a beautiful product !"
5.0,"Some customers complained about the box and quite frankly they were right,  the box is garbage.  However,  what I was most interested in is what came inside the box and that is great and well finished.  It does the job and it does not damage your shirts.  The price and delivery were great.  So far so good,  I can't complain."
5.0,Adorable.. Fits as expected
5.0,"I love these sunglasses...they're lightweight, yet sturdy.  I get compliments on them all of the time!  Great purchase for only $10!"
5.0,"I was very surprised by how much I love this wig! The price is unbelievable for how pretty this wig is. Its absolutely beautiful, soft and full. Definitely would recommend."

5.0,They are my favorite socks

5.0,Can’t wait to use it
5.0,My husband loves it! Would definitely recommend!
5.0,Beautiful bag and color
5.0,I was skeptical at first but after receiving my first one I checked and ordered it in a different color!
5.0,I carry my man bag every day.  I've gotten to be an old man and love not having anything bulky in my pockers.  My wife eve likes it
5.0,Perfect gift for my niece. Loved it.
5.0,"Awesome hat, and great for Halloween!"
5.0,"It works, I've had it for 3 months and never take it off, I even go swimming with it. All functions work well, I especially like how easy it is to switch between standard and military time. The night light is good for telling the time but sucks for setting or doing anything else at night."
5.0,Very comfortable. I like my blouses loose. I could easily wear a Med for a snugger fit
5.0,This bathing suit is great! The fit was as expected. I love the ruched bottoms and the extra bra support. Everyone loves it! I would definitely order again!
5.0,"These unique earrings came as described and looked great, they are heavy but they are also super fun to wear and make a very fashionable statement for any outfit."
5.0,I have a petite face and these fit. They look super cute. I love the cream color.
5.0,Very comfortable and nice looking slipper. I wear a size 6 1/2 tennis shoe but ordered the slipper in size 6. It fit perfectly. The recommendation was to order next larger whole size if you wear a half size. I was concerned that size 7 would be too large.  Glad I took the chance of ordering the smaller whole size instead.
5.0,"So beautiful, the color is very pretty"
5.0,They are just beautiful.  Perfectly made. Very delicate. Definitely I will buy another items from this seller.
5.0,"Fit as expected, correct pattern (Scorpion OCP). Cheaper than other options and highly recommended. Feels more like a actual raincoat compared to the APECS Parka."
5.0,My 30 year old son LOVE IT!
5.0,very pretty and look just like as picture.
5.0,"Healing crystals are one of my favorite things to collect.  I was extremely impressed with the quality of the crystals which are genuine.  The price is more than right, and you won't find this less-expensive anywhere else!  I enjoyed this so much, I bought another set for my daughter because she fell in love with my set, and kept trying to take it."
5.0,"I absolutely love this and get tons of completements on it too! When I don't want to carry around lots of stuff and just want my ID, money, and cards I use it alone. Has some extra space for lip gloss, eyeliner, or whatever small things you wanna bring. When I need more stuff for somewhere I'm going I simply remove the chain and throw it in my bigger bag to use as my wallet!"
5.0,I got these for my husband for his birthday. I am not sure of glove sizes but since he does not have very big hands and one of the other reviews suggested getting a size bigger I went with it.  i got these in large and he tried them and they fit perfectly! Very nie and just what he wanted.
5.0,"The shirt looks very cute, however I cannot comment about the fit as it is a gift."
5.0,"They are comfortable, thick enough to protect especially if you insert a filter but don't feel stifling. They adjust well and fit four out of five of our family members teen through adult. I just ordered 12 more in different colors."
5.0,"The fit is perfect and it's actually pretty comfortable. Normally, shorts ride up on me but these don't at all. They're stretchy and it's easy to exercise in them.<br /><br />I like the bits of reflective strips on them - it means you could actually go jogging during hot summer nights and not worry about visibility."
5.0,For the price I expected a cheap plastic thing. It’s actually got some weight to it! Way better quality than I expected.
5.0,For the price they were perfect. No complaints at all. Very strong made and more beautiful in person. Definitely happy with this purchase.
5.0,"got this for a themed party.  it was a little tight for my fat head, but it seems to be of good quality and not just a throw away novelty."
5.0,"It looks cute and gets tons of compliments. More rain repellant than I expected, too!"
5.0,"I'm very happy with my Dovoda watch, it's everything I hoped it would be and more. From sport to formal blending in. Great job ! !"
5.0,"When I first opened these my reaction was that they felt a bit cheap.<br />Having worn them for a few days, I'm about to order another pair or two.<br /><br />The top fabric is very stretchy. If you have fat feet the top fabric will have some give in it so you won't feel the shoe is too too tight. The top fabric almost looks like sock fabric. The bottom is thick but it has these hollow diamonds in it so it's not heavy.<br /><br />There are no laces. While they are not exactly slip on-slip off shoes, they are very comfortable. I can not slip these on and off. I have to bend over and help pull the fabric up and over my foot.<br /><br />Be warned- they are not water proof though.<br /><br />These are comfortable.<br />I think they are a great quality and I'm about to order another pair."
5.0,"I have 4 of these leggings and I believe everyone needs a pair of these. For me, the inner fleece lining, the stretch of the leggings and the overall warmth make these a MUST in everyone's wardrobe."
5.0,I don’t like to wear fitted tops and was looking for a loose tank top and saw this one. I read the reviews that recommend sizing down so I ordered a small instead of medium. Soooo glad I did! The tank fits really well and is loose but not voluminous. Looking forward to wearing it for the remainder of summer :)
5.0,"These masks are far superior to any I have bought before! I suffer from chronic Migraines, which requires as much darkness as possible, and these masks ROCK at shutting out the light! (Inevitably, there are leaks around the edges, but these are the CLOSEST I've ever had eye masks get!!)<br /><br />And the fit is very flexible...Velcro closure on head strap is generous, fitting both from small to large easily, and there is very little covering the nose, which is a HUGE plus for me, as I'm extremely sensitive to things touching my nose!<br />And the cost for both masks was incredible...the only point against them is they are shipped from somewhere in Asia, so they take a little longer to get here, but SO worth the wait!!<br />If you're looking for good blackout masks, these are among the best for the price!  😁"
5.0,Value for money. Fits as expected. Great quality
5.0,"Very classy and stylish watch. Clear easy to read face.<br />This is a Pilot watch and looks better on the wrist than any of the many other Aviation models. The black leather strap, is also very comfortable it is easy to both adjust and fasten, adds to the strong sleek and military appearance, thus combining pilots graphics with a casual feel.<br />I just recived two positive comments about this watch, which is always a nice situation to be in. People asking me about it, assuming it costs more than the affordable under $100 price it has now.<br />Personally, its great to be different to the millions of people wearing Invicta or Timex or Casio at this price point! I like a watch which stands out and this is a nice accurate timepiece, it keeps good time and is well made."
5.0,Super cute! I managed to wrangle my 36H cup titties into this top (112cm). Honestly I own 2 of these now in case one dies some day.
5.0,Not at this time.
5.0,These are unusually small. So size up 2 full sizes. I don't love wearing size XL but they fit great and the price is right.
5.0,"Wonderful dress, fully lined with beautiful navy and white checked 3/4 length sleeves."
5.0,I purchased this product before and the style is very nice and appealing. One of the arms gassed broken so I found this same frame but just a different color on Amazon and they're really nice.
5.0,I bought matching pair for me and my mom. We got lots of compliments
5.0,They fit as stated and have such a nice material. Looks like work but feels so casual &lt;3
5.0,Fit perfect didnt get burnt
5.0,Ordering the black one now!
5.0,"My son loves this, very beautiful ❤️"
5.0,More Comfortable than the plastic bands and I love that it is fully adjustable too.
5.0,Was nice but returned. Too if for my fat head.
5.0,Item runs small but the next size up worked perfectly
5.0,Love ittttttttt
5.0,These are very comfortable. I used the hand measuring chart and was surprised it said I should order a pair of Medium but they fit great. I especially like the warm cuffs but just wish the strap to tighten them was velcro instead of two buttons so it could be a little bit tighter.<br />The touchscreen feature feels a little clunky but not bad considering you are wearing a pair of gloves after-all.
5.0,I ordered this for my wife for her birthday. She loved it! I put on a charm that meant something to both of us. Simple but elegant. We haven’t had it cleaned yet. Will buy again.<br />It doesn’t tangle easily like other necklaces. You can add whatever you want to it easily. Great replacement for other chains as well. Doesn’t break as easily as other necklaces either.<br />It grabs hold of hair if you have it down.
5.0,"It classy, has nice texture, and a head turner."
5.0,the pants are a great fit.
5.0,Do not bleach will turn shirt yellow
5.0,"Nice fit, nice material and keep your hands warm."
5.0,I bought these to share with my daughter. She is a size 2 and I am a size 14 and these fit us both! They are comfortable and warm with the soft lining and even on me they aren't see thorugh. We are both happy!
5.0,Great anklet  it  arrived early.
5.0,Gift for my son who serves in the U.S. Navy. He loves it.
5.0,It was a well received gift.  Very Nice and delivered quickly.
5.0,"Have tried numerous designs and brands. Hands down these are the most comfortable, well-designed briefs out there. A plus accesos the board, you will not be disappointed. In fact, you will most likely replace your entire stick with these!"
5.0,Love this! Just as expected.
5.0,Very cute and comfortable boots. Love them.
5.0,"Beautiful, comfortable, casual, perfect with leggings, a tunic and some boots for a casual winter outfit! The fabric is more like a heavy t-shirt than a cardigan."

5.0,My son love this amulet
5.0,as espected
5.0,"Beautiful bag, very happy!"
5.0,Perfect for my fridge!
5.0,"These have become my favorite leggings! I wear them working out, and they don't fall down, not see through, and don't stretch out as I work out."
5.0,"Shows all your curves and I didn't know that this, I'm sure, is a replica of the dress Princess Kate wore somewhere.  I screamed when I saw footage of this dress EXACT PATTERN on television.  It shows ALL my curves and is just sexy.  I have to wear it on date night but certainly not to work."
5.0,Beautiful.  Received So many compliments. Amazing Quality for such a reasonable price.
5.0,"Worked great as a little hair accessory for my tea party. Everyone loved having a little hat for themselves, they were super cute."
5.0,"Very comfortable, I have a fossil hybrid watch that came with a leather band. Immediately replaced with this one, it's very easy to adjust and came with the tool needed to remove links."
5.0,"I needed a new belt and decided to give this a try. I had never owned a ratchet style belt like this before, but liked the idea of being able to make small adjustments vs the next hole. I'm glad I did! Quality of the belt and buckle are fantastic. I love the ratchet adjustment. With two fingers I can discreetly loosen or tighten my belt. Why haven't I done this sooner? I'd give this 6 stars if I could!"
5.0,"Nice material, I almost didn't want to give it to my daughter and toyed with the idea of keeping it for myself. However seeing that she practically lives in the hoodie I'm glad I gave it to her. I would definitely recommend this hoodie and may buy myself one later."
5.0,Works great to carry your cash and passport during fishy pick pocketing cities
5.0,Love love love this band💖 im not very handy to use tools for anything but its breeze even for me to adjust it for my wrist. Everything included in box. I receive lots of compliments that its gorgeous band. Its very sturdy. I always take them off when go in pool or shower so no real experience how it can survive that. But it survives very well light water work like playing w/ kids and have water all over on arms at least once a day😀😀 highly recommended.
5.0,These glasses are amazing they are a perfect fit the blue light fiter works so well my sleep has improved my headaches have reduced cannot recommend this enough
5.0,"I am 5’6” and a size 4. I bought a size small. Don’t size up on this like other Amazon purchases. In fact, I think I need a size XS since I am so small on top. It is very comfy and cute!"
5.0,My 4 year old daughter love them and so does everyone else
5.0,Love Love Love!!!!!  Soft but great support. I have narrow ankles so the straps are lose but that with every sandal I own. Want to purchase more for next year but sold out. Great purchase.
5.0,"This necklace isnt what I expected. It was so tiny and dainty* it looks beautiful and I love wearing it. I almost wanted to order a second one, in case something happens to this one."
5.0,Super retro and cute! Received today and tried it on.  It hits my knee.  I'm 5'8 and ordered a M and it's a great fit.  Looking forward to wearing it to work.
5.0,"We love our Livie & Luca collection.  This weekend we were getting ready for a birthday party and my almost 3yo insisted on her Livie & Luca Unicorn sandals.  She said, ""Unicorns make me strong!""  How can you argue with that?  The quality is great and they last.  Used, they will bring top dollar when the consignment sales come around.  Win, win, win."
5.0,This shirt turned out great!!! I will order more!
5.0,"Finally, a winter hat I love! I have a collection of knit hats that I don't quite like - not warm enough, color not exactly right, sort of slouchy but not really. I bought this YUTRO grey one and a white one - they are warm, fit well, and look good, and enough room to wear my hair up without crushing or without being too big and droopy. Very pleased!"
5.0,"This is so soft!  It is easy to wear and comfortable to sleep in.  The quality/material is great.  The ruffle shorts is a nice little detail.  Customer service is excellent.  I had a question about sizing and they were responsive and super helpful.  I am 5'4"" and 120 lbs and the small fit perfectly.  I am planning on buying some of their other styles as well."
5.0,Love the design and the handles are great for carrying. Great product!!
5.0,It’s a soft material dress. I really liked it and glad I bought the dress.I got a large burgundy size.  I wear size 14 dresses I am 5”2 and weight 175 lbs and I think I would have gone with an XL. I prefer a looser fit.Other than that I really like the dress. Great Buy!
5.0,Nice shirt.  Love the elephant.
5.0,Just got it today. Big fan of the movie.  Totally worth it. Very happy with purchase 😀
5.0,fits and came quickly!
5.0,"Its the perfect length and size for me to wear. Its very shiny, detailed and amazing for tree and owl lovers"
5.0,This ring is so feminine and delicate. I wear it almost everyday now.
5.0,Just the right amount of color.
5.0,Love this skirt! I am excited to wear it as it is very f lowly and fits just right on my waist.
5.0,Exactly like the pic and description. Very pretty to wear at work with name badge... Edit.. unfortunately over time it kept falling apart. I would fix and it woukd come apart at another section. Bummed. Was my favorite. Loved while lasted!!
5.0,"I bought this for my ""Biker"" brother.  He said it was really cool and had a good feel to it.  He really, really liked it."
5.0,Love it!  It is different from most t-shirts and really has a unique style.
5.0,"I was looking for a black one piece, read the reviews on this particular item. A lot of the reviews said to order it bigger then what is normally used. Which was very helpful to me because I did as the reviews stayed and the fit is perfect."
5.0,Love the earrings came on time didn't cost a lot will buy more
5.0,Love this sweater. Fits great and very comfortable. Will be buying more for sure
5.0,This shirt was an offical playstation shirt which is awesome and the design is very well done. Very comfortable and survives washes.
5.0,Fast shipping and all rings are sizeable!
5.0,These are my husbands. He loves them.
5.0,Love these so much! The designs are simple yet cute and they fit perfectly considering I do have a larger neck. Plus it's a great deal for as many as you're getting INCLUDING a pouch! Definitely recommend these. :) 👌🏻
5.0,These are very easily the best socks that I own
5.0,Using for pirate day on disney cruise. Soft and ailky abd nice fit.
5.0,"I liked that they were thin, which meant that I had no trouble using them with my shoes. They are comfortable and stay in place. I’ve washed them once without any issues"
5.0,"I bought this Hayabusa gi as a follow-up to the heavier Goorudo 3.0 gi. This is significantly lighter, but very well made. Earlier in the year I had ordered the Goorudo gi in an A3 and had incorrectly assumed the sizing would be similar for this gi. It ended up being too small in both the sleeves and pant length by quite a bit. I ended up returning it and ordering an A4 which, of course, was too large but I was able to throw it in the dryer and now it fits perfectly (I'm 6'0"" and 195 lbs). All my other gis are A3, but I have to hang dry all of them, so it's actually nice that I can throw this one in the dryer after washing.<br />I'm going to have a hard time trying out new brands of gis because Hayabusa made me so darn happy with the two that I own. My other 4 gis from different brands simply aren't as nice (and two of them were more expensive than the Goorudo). I honestly don't think you can go wrong making this purchase."
5.0,Adorable!! Looks handmade and is great quality! I'm so so glad I picked this one!
5.0,Bought for a party and it’s a great variety with different ways to wear.  Most are very comfortable and adjustable.
5.0,Soft and comfortable. They fit me perfectly just like joggers should fit. The material and stitching is really nice and feels great.  I used these for yoga and they were super stretchable
5.0,Seems to be holding up as well.  A real improvement to having an un-forgiving belt that won't stretch.
5.0,"I love this hat! My 5 year old wears it, allows for great sun coverage."
5.0,The style is great and they are comfortable
5.0,Jack love this cap he is world war 2 vet. He in a retiredment home  but love wear at cap every place he go .
5.0,Son loved it. The print was nice & the quality of the shirt was good. Fit perfect.
5.0,"Ordered in black when my old RFID wallet started falling apart. It was Prime item and about $15. Like that it's a clutch with room for all my cards, cash, and change. Comes with detachable loop/wrist strap.<br /><br />Photos are accurate representation of style and quality. If your smartphone isn't particularly slim, it probably won't fit. (I've got a Samsung G3. It's too thick for me to zip.)<br /><br />Overall - very happy with my purchase. Customer service emailed me just to check up. Would buy from this seller again."
5.0,These friendship bracelets are so cool! And I even like the pouches that came with the purchase. They make it easier & nicer for gifting. These are some of the BEST bracelets I’ve ever seen!!
5.0,"So comfy,  LOVE the pocket , as I constantly use my pockets.  With the elastic around the bottom There was no hemming to do.<br />These pants are the best........Would love in different material as rayon in hard to launder & keep from wrinkle. For the most I gave the 5 star<br />because they are great.  Love the support of the elephants to."
5.0,"Holds a lot more than you’d think considering its size. My daughter, who is obsessed with pigs, absolutely adores this bag"
5.0,Liked it enough to buy a second as a gift!
5.0,"Product is made well, sizing was accurate, color and leather trim are complimentary"

5.0,My Wife Loves them. Very comfortable !
5.0,Awesome summer skirt. Thanks for the new length! I have the longer one too. Casual or dressy. Will buy more.
5.0,"Collect magnets on my refrigerator so this was a perfect addition, one of my favorite add one to the collection"
5.0,I have owned RB for the last 20 yrs these are real quick delivery and to boot they shipped in a crush proof box I picked up a new pair to replace the ones I had at least 7 yrs Empire has my business just bought my 2nd pair cuz I will beat em up..... And a new pair to sport on Sunday  :)
5.0,"I love this shirt! I love the colors and the feel of the material. The medium fit me perfectly, I'm 5'10&#34; and about 165lbs medium build, dad body, haha! I have long arms and the arms on this shirt were just right, sometimes medium sized shirts have sleeves that are too short for me, not this shirt, just right!"
5.0,"The phrase that ""family is not an important thing, it is everything"" makes a lot of sense. It isn't just important, good supportive families make everything better. It becomes very important to support and love your family as they support and love you. This is obviously a gift for a favorite cousin, and they can add more charms if they want as well!"
5.0,"First of all the color and pattern is outstanding! When I took them out of package they seemed like theyd be see through, but once on there is only a slight hint of leg shape shown when light shines through..very sublte.<br />Ive never had a pant in this material..more like a blouse material, but it works! They are so light and airy and comfy, but still feel very well made and not delicate.<br />I have already received several compliments. I am thin and tall and they fit very nicely in both waist and heighth but at 5'8"" I feel like they are right at the edge of being too short in the ankles ( the elastic), but the flowy material hangs below the elastic cuff, allowing for a bit more length.<br />I like these A LOT more than I thought..can be dressed up or down!"
5.0,Super soft and a good thickness. Won't buy leggins without pockets again
5.0,Great! Fits me right and it makes me look good ;)
5.0,I just used it for a grocery run and it was very useful having a decent size bag to carry groceries from my car in the parking garage to my apartment across the street. Folds up nice so it doesn't take up too much room in the car. So far so good!
5.0,IT WAS JUST LITTLE SMALLER THAN I WOULD EXPECT FROM PICTURE BUT KNOW ONE WANT A HUGH NECKLACE..IT WAS WELL MADE VERY REASONABLE............PRICED AND NICE ENOUGH I ORDERED TWO MORE ...............FOR GIFTS ............................GOOD PRODUCT
5.0,It's a comfortable shirt
5.0,"I love this necklace ! it looks like real gold!! unbelievable!!! it looks so expensive!! incredible!!! I am going to buy lots more, the price is incredible for the good exceptional quality!!! I am so happy!!!!"
5.0,Very comfortable hooded zippered sweatshirt.  This gives you room for layers.
5.0,I bought this exact replacement for the hat I have been wearing for over ten years.
5.0,"The Belt is very well made.  The colors are very bright and the buckle looks great.  The ratchet system was a little awkward at first, as the release is on the bottom of the buckle, but it works fairly simply enough.  I may have to get another color in the same belt!<br /><br />Go Gators!"
5.0,"I love this dress - I bought it for a formal wedding.  I did have to go up 2 dress sizes (and it was still a bit snug but if I went bigger it would have been to big in the shoulders)  I talked to the company and they admitted that their product does run quite small.  Definitely use the size chart they provide (I didn't and wish I had).  Even with all the sizing issues I really do love the dress.  I'm 5'1"" 140 lbs and although I'm normally an 8/10 the size 12 is what I ended up with."
5.0,"What a great dress! I bought the blue/red color first and then ordered the other color. Nice, thick fabric on both the top and the skirt and fits beautifully. The skirt is more of a flannel material. These will be great for colder weather! I will say that the purple color is actually more red/burgundy in person."
5.0,Really liked the dress.
5.0,Beautiful and full of sparkle...
5.0,Had a blast with this. That look of the people there was priceless. Weren’t sure how it was possible for me to be riding of Santa’s shoulders.
5.0,Love it! Went beautifuly with my birthday dress!
5.0,I ordered the yellow/gold scarf. The quality is excellent for the price. No problems with fabric or stitching. No issues with odor or chemical scent. I immediately ordered a second scarf in Wine Red.
5.0,"These are really beautiful! I read the positive reviews, but still, for the price, I did not expect such high quality. I didn't think they would be real abalone, but they definitely appear to be. They have some slight imperfections, but that's what makes me think they're real. Either way, I'm very happy with them. I would definitely purchase again for myself or as a gift. As other reviewers have said, I would add a rubber back to keep them in place."
5.0,"Easy to slip over your head, nice long chain. My 12-yr old loves this necklace - wears it with everything!"
5.0,It is beautiful.  The man's bracelet is too small for bigger men.  I would have paid extra for 8 to 81/2 inch bracelet.  The necklace is mone of the prettiest I have seen.  I love stainless steel because I can wear it all the time..
5.0,"Extremely comfortable.  I got these because they looked very similar to a much more expensive insole that’s making waves.  I own a pair of those and they are very good.  These looked extremely similar, cost a fraction, and a no-brainer with Prime’s free returns.  As it turns out, they are maybe more comfortable - though thicker with padding.  Well-worth the cost."
5.0,Bought these for my husband & he is satisfied with them.
5.0,"I really like this, it's adjustable, multi features good for any Hippie type Peace Freak.  Lots of compliments. Comfortable, too."
5.0,The size worked and it’s beautiful
5.0,My daughter loved it and it looks so good on her.
5.0,"Wear your masks, and be comfortable and stylish while doing so! These are rad, so soft, and the price is right!!!"
5.0,Beautiful and lots of sparkle! Just as pictured. Arrival time took forever and then I realized they came from Singapore. Packaging was good and shoes were well protected. They were just a little stinky and had to off gas in the garage for a week. Beautiful shoes for an upcoming wedding.
5.0,It is perfect. Beautiful read and had a stretchy fabric. Has a zipper in the back in case if you can't see it in the pictures. The &#34;bow&#34; isn't attach to the dress. It's separated from the dress and is just a string that you have to the.
5.0,This is my 5th pair. I can wear 4 or 6. I love the high rise cut.
5.0,La Boudoir Invisible Stretch underwear sits on the skin smooth and taut. It fits well yet does not constrict. The stretchy material feels soft and flatters at the same time. I certainly would have them more.
5.0,Clear fits well<br />Nice product
5.0,Fits nice and feels wonderful
5.0,It’s beautiful and good price
5.0,I had to return the medium for a large cause it fit tight.  Super cute shirt!
5.0,"This little bracelet is so pretty.<br />I ordered it for my daughter, she is 7.<br />I was a little worried it would not fit because it is advertised for baby or toddler.<br />It fit her perfect. She can maybe get another year out of it, I am hoping a little longer.<br />It would make a lovely gift for a baby girl or toddler so they can get longer use out of it.<br />Wonderful baptism gift!<br />It is very lovely. The rose clasp is so pretty and works really well.<br />It was very easy to put on and take off.<br />I just adore it, It is so precious.<br />It looks and feels like great quality.<br />You get a little gift box and the bracelet comes in a pretty little pouch.<br />This is going to make a lovey special gift.<br />I highly recommend!!<br /><br />I received this item for a discounted price in return for my honest review"
5.0,"It’s a great light layer but with other clothing gives perfect warms. I got them to protect my arms from the sun, when I’m practicing archery. They fit tight enough not to interfere with my shot by bunching up. They wash like a dream and keep their color. I bought a set that was too big and kept them to sleep in. The pajama top of life! Hope this is helpful."
5.0,Great fit & very good quality
5.0,Got these for my wife.  She loves them and says that they're &#34;groovey&#34;!
5.0,Fun shoes; very comfortable.
5.0,shipped fast - as expected - was looking to something to hook on my purse that didn't let the keys fall off - this is it
5.0,Lovely dress to dress up or dress down
5.0,Super stylish!!
5.0,"I'm wearing this top as I type. It fits exactly the way I like, is soft, comfortable and feels lovely in this heat, wicks perspiration away from my skin and I feel cooler while wearing it.<br />The styling is lovely and I like the smaller arm holes than on most tank tops.<br />The length is to the top of my thighs, covers my bottom, which is also desirable. Nicely finished inside and out with no raw edges on seams or hems.<br />Launders beautifully, machine wash cold, tumble dry low temp, hang immediately for zero wrinkles."
5.0,"I am so pleased with the bucket hats with my custom designed embroidery.  The hat itself is excellent quality, fits well and is well made.  The embroidery work is perfect.  I would 100% recommend INK STITCH for your custom design work.  Oh, and I ordered on Monday and they were delivered on Friday!!"
5.0,"Bought this and it was shipped from China.  Luckily it didn't take too long to get here (11 days), but I'm torn on how to feel about it.<br /><br />Pros:  Looks just like the real Apple one.  Feels good, and looks legit for a decent price.  Texture looks and feels just like the original one. The clip that slides into the watch looks like titanium, not dark orange plastic like others on Amazon.  Additionally, the G strap holder looks good, and looks like the original.  It also looks like it'll last a while.<br /><br />Cons:  The size.  That's a BIG issue.  As you can see in the first photo, you can see what you get in the box that it comes in (orange band).  The band is significantly smaller than the one that came with the Apple watch (white one), which is a size large, and is easy to slide on in the morning.  When I ordered it (orange band), it only comes in one size, and didn't even state the size (length of the band like small/medium/large).  When I try to put on the watch in the morning, it's hard to get on, and I have to really shrink and squeeze my hand to get it on.  And I have small hands!  Luckily the band stretches just a tiny bit, and that kinda helps, but if you have large hands, good luck, you're not getting it on.  Another con is also the ability to attach the band to the watch.  For some reason, it doesn't fit exactly right, and it doesn't just slide into the clip holder like the original Apple (white) band, but you have to jiggle it around, play with it, and finally after lots of time playing with it, it'll slide into the watch clip holders.  This also compounds to the problems with this band.  Also, this is shipped from China, so you'll likely need to wait about 2 weeks for it to arrive.  Lastly, as you can see from one of the pics I uploaded, you can see that it's not titanium, it's made from stainless steal, so be mindful of this.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Would I recommend it?  Not sure, but if it came in a size large like the original, I'd give it 5 stars.  If you're a woman and have tiny hands, it would probably slide on easily.  Would I buy this product again?  No, I wouldn't because it's not easy to get on since a large works best for me, this one is more like a size small to medium.  I would return it if possible, but since it came from China, the shipping and time needed to send it back would be more of a hassle than it's worth.  I can also see now that it's available on Amazon Prime, which is good - but wasn't available when I first ordered it.  I'm just going to have to swallow the cost of this and use it every once in a while, instead of as my daily driver; as I originally intended for it to be.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone out there who was considering to buy this band.<br /><br />UPDATE 1:  The seller has contacted me numerous times to make it right in offering a replacement band, and as grateful as I am for the wonderful customer service, I politely declined it as I can continue to use the existing band, although a bit tight to get on in the morning.  This amazing customer service has thus made me change my review rating from 3 stars, to 4.  Thank you again to the seller for 5 star service, it does not go overlooked.<br /><br />UPDATE 2 (Final):  The seller contacted me again to inform me that there were new sizes in the bands, and after a bit of thought, I accepted the new band.  The shipper sent it again from china, and can be seen in the new pictures I've uploaded.  The new photos show 3 bands, and my Apple Watch Ultra for scale.  The first version (V1) of the band I received from my order is in the top box (yellow), the new version (V2) I received -- which is considered a large -- is in the middle box (green), and the original band (OB) that came with my Apple watch ultra is the white one on the bottom (blue box).  The new V2 band slides on much easier, and gives me enough room to slide on the watch on in the morning without having to squeeze my hand into it.  It also feels comfortable on the skin for all day use.  One note of difference you can see on V2, is much more visible in the purple boxes.  It's not really a deal breaker, but you can see that V1 looks much, much closer to the real deal, than the new V2 (middle band).  Also, V2 also slides much more easily into the watch's clip holder, which is a great improvement over V1.  The only thing I would recommend to the seller is to have the new V2 (which is considered a large), to have more length so that it comes closer to the OB, and to have the stitching on the ends fixed, so that it's more in line with the OB version.  I've changed my rating again from 4, to 5 stars for the outstanding customer support, and the new and improved band length.  I'm very happy and pleased with it, and I hope it holds up to a long and lasting lifetime of the watch.  Thank you again to the seller, I'm very happy with your customer service and your product."
5.0,This is a very warm leather glove that blocks the winter wind and works well with touch screens. The only drawback is that some of the fingers are a bit longer than needed for me (the middle finger is just right but the thumb index finger is a bit long) but I think this is needed to fit a variety of hand sizes (or maybe I have short fingers). Five stars and would buy again.
5.0,I bought this hat for my mom. She loves it! Plus she looks really cute in it! She has thinning hair and for some reason this makes her hair look fuller and just looks great sitting on her head. It is made extremely well!

5.0,"Inlove these pants. I’m a curvy girl and have issues with pants not being high enough (or they are high enough and end up being huge everywhere else!) or slipping down while working out. These feel great and I never have to fuss with them! And they almost feel like control top, but still bevy comfy."
5.0,T-shirt & printing was good quality.  Purchased as a Christmas gift and seller was accommodating when I asked to change the shipping address to make sure I received it before Christmas.  Thank you!!

5.0,"I guarantee you have never had more comfortable leggings than these!! They fit exactly the way you hope they will, they don't ride down, they don't ride up and give you a wedgy, they just stay where they belong and hold you in the whole day. I want to get 10 more of these leggings and live my best life lol!"

5.0,This dress is well priced and has stretchy material- the cut is pretty flattering and the length is perfect!  It’s definitely worth the price and I was not disappointed- I ordered large( I’m a 44DD) and a size 8 waist. it fit great!

5.0,Nice color and warm
5.0,Very comfortable and absorbent strap; nice coloring and fits perfectly with my Apple Watch
5.0,Listening to other reviews I ordered a larger size which turned out to be the wrong idea. It seems to run true to size based on how big the size is that I ended up ordering. Submitting for return even though overall it seems like a nice product heavy denim material was looking for a lighter denim

5.0,Love these readers. So difficult to find featherweight glasses. They stay in place for me & I have a small head. I wear a strong strength and they help me so much to see clearly on computer or walking around the house.
5.0,"she order one a few weeks ago and her best friend loved it also.She gave it to her and order her another.Just the right size,not to big or to small.Very Beautiful!!!!"
5.0,All of these chokers are so cute!! Obviously for the price and quantity they are a little disfigured but it's definitely fixable. They look just like the picture though and I love that they have adjustable clasps. :)
5.0,This leather wallet case is great. I love the color I picked and it fits perfectly in my phone I also like that it protects my phone can of nice and classy.

5.0,My daughter like it’s
5.0,This is an absolute beautiful and fashionable necklace.  It’s not heavy or dull looking.  I paired the necklace with the RechicGu Ethnic Bali Jhumka Jhumki Gold Brocade Lotus Mexico Gypsy Dangle Earrings and it was perfect.  I got so many compliments on the pairing.

5.0,"I just recently started  wearing toe socks, and I love the flip flop socks more."
5.0,"I bought this for my Mom who has advanced stage dementia. I needed something that she couldn't take off on her own. I purposely bought a large (she normally wears a medium) but she likes loose fitting, baggy clothes.<br /><br />It fits her very comfortably. She sleeps in it at night. I bought it so she won't take her clothing off at night (which has been an ongoing problem with dementia/Alzheimer's). It's made with good quality, thick material. The one button in the back could be tricky to manuever into the small loop but I'm getting the hang of it.<br /><br />Typical clothing for elderly is very ""old"" looking and not stylish. I opted for this tie-dye romper because my mom has always been very fashionable and it's so cute and stylish.<br /><br />I ordered something similar from another manufacturer but it was super thin material and ran extremely small. I just returned it. I wish this company offered more elastic ankles rompers. I'd buy them all."
5.0,Love it love it.....drop dead gorgeous.
5.0,"Excellent value, perfect new condition [never worn], amazingly quick delivery.  BAM!!!!"
5.0,I really liked the tee shirt and I used to be sponsored by Team Santa Cruz for skateboarding and Surfing 🏄‍♂️ and Snowboarding 🏂 too back in the 80’s so I really am totally stoked about this tee shirt love representing Team Santa Cruz forever Yo !! I highly recommend this tee shirt to everyone especially skateboarders and Surfers 🏄‍♂️ and snowboarders who like Team Santa Cruz ok peace out y’all and thanks 🙏 for the Bitchen Santa Cruz tee shirt I’m stoked Yo Alfie
5.0,"I got it to carry my checkbook, some wet one wipes, mints, etc. it’s a bit small but holds everything I need. I’m a man by the way, but the style can be for men or women. Quality is top notch!"
5.0,"Love it. It wraps around but is sewn shut so you don't have to worry about the skirt flying open.<br />Fits, did not order larger size."
5.0,excellent quality and service
5.0,"So happy with my keen boots, so comfortable right out of the box"
5.0,They are prettier in person than in the photo. They're delicate with colors that stand out. They come in a nice package also.
5.0,Love it can't wait to wear it!
5.0,"Really cute and not see thru, unfortunately fit a little big"
5.0,"These are nice, chunky pieces of rubber. I used mine for cosplay jewelry, and they are heavy-duty enough to be worn, but also comfortable. They're about 1/2 inch thick, and the dots stand up off of that. They are much bigger than your standard Lego brick, though."
5.0,I liked the fit and style!
5.0,this was a cute t-shirt love it smmm .
5.0,"all good, except too short for me; I am returning..."
5.0,Spouse totally loves it. Good material
5.0,Very warm and comfortable. Smaller than your average slouchy so it fit really well and kept my head warm for a fall hiking trip. Good buy.
5.0,"I'm always on the lookout for pj's that I can walk my dog in. First thing in the morning, I don't want to change out of my sleepwear since I live in an apt. and there are always other people out and about. This outfit was very comfortable for sleeping and when paired with my sneakers, I felt very appropriately clothed to not only walk the dog, but I'd also run errands in this. The outfit isn't overly heavy so I'm not sure how warm it would be when the temperatures drop below freezing. But it's just right for nights when the outdoor temperature dips down to the 40's. The fit is true to size. I wore it with the entire top out, but if you don't have a tummy like me, you could easily get away with the popular look where the front is tucked in and the back is loose. I strongly recommend these pj's for their versatility and their comfort. Pictures to follow, once I get a mirror long enough to show the outfit on me. (Right now, I only have one over the sink and it just isn't large enough."
5.0,The best band I had bought.
5.0,"Bonito, de buena calidad, no decolora ni se estira."
5.0,"I’m happy with these - wish I had gotten a half size larger than my regular size though. I’ve been wearing them to the gym for a couple months and I’m happy - lightweight, cushy and cute :)"
5.0,Would recommend to others
5.0,Great for packing.
5.0,Perfect for Galaxy Note 4
5.0,no issue here. very pretty shirt
5.0,"Very good finish, is light and looks elegant."
5.0,Granddaughter was in LOVE with this garment when I gave it to her. She loved the true pink color. Fabric was soft and easy for her to put on herself. Tutu sticks out while the body portion is form fitting. The glimmers on the skirt make it extra special. The material will allow room to grow. I would recommend this to a friend.
5.0,I was skeptical about this tank when I ordered it however it exceed my expectations! A size medium fit me for a loose fit. I would recommend this!
5.0,Loved it. Very cute. My granddaughter looks good in it.
5.0,What I really expect. 10/10
5.0,I have had this band for a few months now. I wear it every day to the hospital cleaning frequently and shows no signs of wear and tear. Would buy again
5.0,This lantern is really great. It is super bright. It requires 3 AA batteries. It turns on and off by opening and closing it. It is small than I thought it would be but I didn't read the description so that is my own thought. This is great for camping or even keeping in the house in case of an emergency or power outage. I might get another for the house since I got this one for camping.<br />Please note I received a discount on this product in order to test it out.
5.0,"I love the extra room at the toes. I love the energy in my legs. I have 6 herniated discs. It affects my hands and my fingers become like ""The claw"" game that looks like it's going to pick up a stuffed animal, but slides right off. Pulling on these socks takes me at least 30 minutes, so it should take you a lot less time."
5.0,Fits our 2 yr old great
5.0,Great - super fast shipping I am impressed
5.0,Great sentiment. I have another set of keys I will probably get another of these for. I've seen much smaller sterling silver versions of this go for $40 so I prefer stainless steel :).
5.0,My daughter was dazzling in these glasses for her 100 year old dress up costume.  She is six and she looked amazing.
5.0,"We use it in gardening. They protect my hands from being scratched. Although they are a bit big, they are very comfortable to wear. Don't expect these gloves to be soft enough to pick up small things for meticulous work. I believe that most gloves can't be used, and it is also very good for insulation."
5.0,She loved these earrings.. Bought them for my girlfriend as a gift.. She is delighted. Great value for the money spent. Well worth buying..
5.0,I like everything about this robe.  It is very comfortable and warm.  I love the pink color that I ordered and the texture and built in belt are perfect for me.  This is a very luxurious robe and it fits perfectly.
5.0,Came in original Fossil packaging and works perfect!!! I have not noticed my watch becoming hot while charging. I would not hesitate to buy again. Recommend!
5.0,"Really high quality Shades, Impressed at the cost<br /><br />Easily could be mistaken for a pair 3-4 times this price<br /><br />10/10 would recommend again"
5.0,Great hat. Fits well with little adjustment of the strap on each side.
5.0,I loved the dress the colors were perfect
5.0,I am 72 years young and wear this adorable necklace with a black and white striped sweater.  Very fun and always receive compliments whenever I wear it!
5.0,"Overall for my size head I think the glasses fit very well! The lens size of the glasses are not too big nor small. It adjusts with my eye-to-head ratio. However if you are considering this as a purchase, please read the glasses measurements and your measurements before you make a decision!"
5.0,My grandkids absolutely love this toy!!<br />The three of them were together for the first time in 18 months and had a blast just trying to master the flip sticks. By the end of the week they all were doing great. Even their parents were getting in on the action! The stick’s patterns are really nice and they held up to some really rough play. The mesh bag is a nice extra touch. I highly recommend this toy.
5.0,"I purchased this necklace as a birthday gift for a friend. I have not given it to her yet, but I think she will love it! I think the quality of the item and the packaging is excellent. I think it's cute that the little card with the message is included, it gives it a more personal touch. Although I personally did not have any issues with my order, the seller is attentive and followed up with e-mails making sure I was satisfied with my purchase. Great buy and great service!"
5.0,Love my daughter is obsessed with Sesame Street. Would buy again. Wash up nice and has great color to them
5.0,Love the Elephant chain it fit perfect.
5.0,"It's exactly what I expected, it's beautiful, but I thought that I ordered the ""Matching Jeans"" for the holidays!! I'm looking forward to hearing from you again. Thank you Melody Marcotte marcottmelody@gmail.com 😢"
5.0,I bought these glasses to go with a police Halloween costume.  They were perfect. Great glasses for a cheap price. They even came in a cute American flag soft case.
5.0,😁👍
5.0,The top fit as expected and is very comfortable.
5.0,Very nice watch . It is very accurate in time.
5.0,Work great and helped to easily spot out our bag at the baggage carousel.
5.0,"Ultra soft, pleasantly surprised at that. I'm 5ft 4 and it brushes my ankles but high enough not to trip over. Very comfortable, I could even wear as a nightgown for sleeping comfortably if I wanted to, but too nice looking to relegate to bed-wear.  I ordered Red and color is as shown. It has no tummy control panels or anything like that, but doesn't make my pear shape body look pregnant like many one piece dresses do. May order a second color."
5.0,The design is really nice and it was so cute I bought one as a gift and kept one for myself!
5.0,"Have purchased several of these tops in various styles and colors. They are nicely made, comfy , stylish and great for travel because they don’t wrinkle.  Also wash well"
5.0,I was surprised how rich in color and expensive they look. Good purchase
5.0,These have been the most wonderful people to deal with! They went way above and beyond anything they had to do for us! The product was absolutely BEAUTIFUL and we will definitely be ordering from them again.
5.0,"""If not we then who"""
5.0,"Its very beautiful, my daughter loves it"
5.0,"Very happy with the shirt, per love the color, it matches great with my outfit. Nice quality of material and very soft. It was a little long on me but that’s not really a problem."
5.0,Dress is nice and better in person than in picture. Nice fabric.
5.0,So roomy and goes just above the knee so comfortable walking around the house without a robe. So soft this is the second one I bought and the first one I’ve washed several time already and still just as soft and comfortable especially for a long sleeve night shirt ❤️
5.0,I thought these would be geeky and wouldn't work. But neither was true. They don't look that bad and they work like nothing I'd ever experienced before.
5.0,Excellent and Elegant. I simply love it.
5.0,Cute suit! Better quality than I was expecting for the price.  Fit correctly and I've gotten compliments on it.
5.0,Very happy with this wallet ... Quality and design quite good.
5.0,"I ordered a size up xl,  because, I’m bottom heavy and I don’t like when the waist is tight. These are comfy and roomy, however they are really long. I thought these were supposed to be boot cut but no big deal I will just hem the bottoms. I will most likely buy another pair.<br /> I bought the dark blue."
5.0,great pants. My little girl loves them.
5.0,I love the quality of the watchband
5.0,"I wanted a cute post partum dress that would be flowy, so I got this in my pre-pregnancy size. I can't wait to wear it after I have this baby, but I wanted to try it on now to see how it looked. I'm a little bit of a can of biscuits in it rn but I think it will be PERFECT after pregnancy! The sizing is perfect since right now I'm a size up from my pre-pregnancy due to the belly & 👀. The quality is great! It's definitely a great buy!"
5.0,Love it! So soft and comfortable
5.0,I love this shirt! Has amazing B00b coverage!😍

5.0,"Absolutely love it! I'm 5'3"" 185 lbs wear sz 14 in pants. Ordered xl fits perfect, cover stomach pouch & comfortable. I want to order all colors!!"
5.0,I'm pleased with the wallet and it holds what i need to carry.  It's small and light weight compared to anything I have used before now.<br />It's much easier to carry in different locations and is practically invisible.
5.0,I love this dress. I got compliments all day. The fabric is great not what i expected and it fit perfectly. I was very pleased with my purchase.
5.0,"This is a very beautiful necklace, and something I'm proud to wear. It is heavy, well made, and clearly a quality piece."
5.0,Very nice! Bought as a gift and she loved it!
5.0,I like the wallet it's good to have you in my pocket
5.0,"This is a well made karate uniform. My son said it was comfortable and did not feel ""rough or scratchy."" He felt like he could move around in it well. Unfortunately, it ended up being too small for my child and a larger size was not available, thus I had to return it. Too bad, as it was cheaper than the option we ended up having to buy and just as good."
5.0,Purchased for costume purposes. Good value.
5.0,Perfect material and very fast delivered. A piece that combine classic and modern in a fantastic style. All people asks me where I found it...
5.0,This outfit was Everything I expected it to be this will definitely be my new style of clothing for a nice outing/date night.
5.0,My daughter likes the bag very much.😉
5.0,I love the look of this band. It is extremely adjustable and the fit is better than any metal band i have had for the watch. The comfort and price makes this a must have.
5.0,love this dress! Stretchy material but looks great on. Even has a zipper!
5.0,"Flattering, elegant, soft fabric."
5.0,Perfect!!! Fits & feels wonderful!!! One of my favorite purchases!!!
5.0,Superb quality jewelry. Looks the the real diamond and even better. Arrived with all the certificates and inside a surprisingly beautiful quality box with light in it 😀. Amazing.
5.0,It looks great on and my husband wore it on his birthday dinner. It is narrow and thin material so will need special care cleaning. We love it and he is very happy to have a unique Deadpool tie! Great price too!
5.0,I love this night going it’s so cool and comfortable
5.0,Soft and flows but not clingy!! Love this dress!!!!

5.0,This are super soft. I want to wear them all the time
5.0,The fits great.  It's not bulky at all.
5.0,My boyfriend is gonna love it
5.0,Suave y comodo
5.0,You can't go wrong with these. They are classy and can be worn dressed up or with jeans. I love wearing them.
5.0,Great deal for the price and works well with pretty much any derby outfit since it is neutral in color! Glad I purchased!
5.0,"Fantastic bag! Very stylish unlike most other laptop bag. Can pass for a nice formal big bag and not just a laptop bag. It even fits a bogus (not like the slim ones) 15.6 inch laptop but is a little hard to zip especially with other things in d bag. So might do with just an inch or two extra height and maybe length. Otherwise just great.<br />Update: As sturdy as the bag’s leather is, the inner cloth lining is not very durable. The black of this bag is lined with a nice shade of dark red like burgundy or maroon and looks like good quality. However, the cloth has started opening up at the seams and the fibers are teasing apart after only about a couple of months of using the bag. Also, do not over load the bag because if items are too heavy the anchor for the long strap might tear off.<br />If the inner cloth lining is changed to something stronger and more durable, the bag would be great."
5.0,it didn't stay on that long lol my gf loved it! fit a little small but made my cheeks and boobs pop lol
5.0,I really love these bands. Better feel than that rubber that came with my Versa 3. Need to look for additional  color- if more colors will definitely  buy again
5.0,Love Fila. This is my third pair. Fit very well and give good support. Will buy more shortly.
5.0,This product is exactly as advertised.  A comfortable pair of earrings that are appropriate for casual or work outfits.
5.0,"Love this.  I have trouble with traditional bra straps slipping on my shoulders.  And I'm at the age where I am 100% DONE with underwires.  This is the perfect solution to keep ""the girls"" where they belong, no bulging in the front or back, no slipping straps, and it does not feel like a sports bra.  I'm considering replacing all of my ""everyday"" bras with this."
5.0,"It fits like a charm. I'm usually a 32 B but gained a bit of weight and I get spillage now in my 32b bras.So I decided to go with a 34 B and It fit's perfectly. I'm so used to my nips falling out now in my normal ones. But since I'm wearing it under a translucent shirt for Coachella, I need it to cover in all the right places. So I'm very happy with this product. It is comfortable and just as it was described"
5.0,Nice material. Like the pattern. Great deal! Delivered within 2 days! Since it is mandatory in my state to wear a mask. This feels so much better. Bonus my glasses don't fog up!
5.0,"It's a Good Reusable Shopping Bags That Are Foldable Grocery Bags with Hard Bottom Storage Bins with Handles, X-Large Collapsible bags (4 Pack). It's a very good grocery bag with a hard study bottom that didn't bend at all while I had some groceries in it with a gallon of milk. These grocery bags are very good that one would get four bags that is also good in keeping one's groceries separate in each bag like one bag for meats and another for vegetables and etcetera. They are also good for storage bins in keeping potatoes in one bag and other groceries in another bag. It's good to keep these bags in one's trunk to also organize one's items in one's trunk. These bags can be used for a storage bin, a toy box, a storage organizer for one's trunk, grocery shopping and etcetera. The handles to this bag are very strong. It's a good bag for grocery shopping. These grocery bags fit in a market grocery cart that then one put's ones groceries in the bags."
5.0,"Great fabrics, looks very high end, lots compliments."
5.0,"5'3"", 140lbs, 36B. Everything you could want in a summer dress: light weight but NOT cheap fabric!! comfortable stretch, cute fit, LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS!!"
5.0,I am 5’6 and around 160-170 and I ordered a Large. I absolutely love these. I was so hesitant but one of my friends bought it so I had to too. IM IN LOVE. The material is so soft and they fit so well.
5.0,"I Love that, beautiful!!!!"
5.0,GREAT LITTLE TOP FOR A REALLY REASONABLE PRICE. LOVE IT.
5.0,"Bought these pants for my ninth grade son and absolutely loved them. He actually said, “now ma, these the kind of jeans you need to buy me all the time.You know this generation is obsessed with skinny jeans, but I must say, though they were sort of fitted, they still had good room still in them and looked appropriate for any age group. They were NOT the skinny jeans in which women wear-Which is a good thing.I even went back and purchased 3 other styles of the pants and will be buying more in the future!Thanks, because this combined both affordability and style all for only around $10 and that’s hard to find.My son has plenty more growing to do so this was an excellent choice to purchase them, especially with the variety of designs and colors.I think there is around 10-15 different styles and colors and I will be buying all of them."
5.0,Wife seems to really like this.
5.0,Love love love these dresses!! I have the olive and black!!! Thin material so I have to wear a slip but they are simple but classy!! I wear a sexy 3/4 boot with the black and a sexy 5&#34; heel with the olive...they are really classy!!! Love love love these dresses!!!
5.0,Love this suite! I am pretty flat chested but I have a &#34;nice&#34; butt (if I do say so myself). I'm 5'4&#34; and weight about 125 or so.  I got a medium and it fits me great on top and on the bottom. A small would have been waaay too tight. The bottoms are the type that are pretty relieving but I don't mind them.
5.0,"Great product, love that it can be steady or flashing, very bright. Only drawback is that the light doesn’t go all the way around, only either front or back."
5.0,For the price of this dress the quality is nice. The colors are very close to the picture. Cute on my kid.
5.0,Love the size and color. If you want something to hold a lot of stuff this isn't for you but it is the perfect size for my needs.
5.0,"I'm normally a size medium (5' 9&#34;, 145 lbs.), but I bought this shirt to wear with leggings, so I bought a large and it is perfect!"
5.0,This a nice gift for my friends boy. he loves them. he can see colors and is amazed the clarefaction
5.0,"Want these all for myself....fit great, feel good for long sleeve shirt. I have bought 3 sets for the summer!"
5.0,I purchased for my 80 year old mother who wears a nightgown all day. She loves this! It washed great and seems to be good quality.  I plan on purchasing another one.
5.0,"It fit as expected and was a hit at our Christmas party. It’s made of felt and I haven’t washed it yet, a little concerned how well it will wash up."
5.0,You MUST see the size chart! I'm a size 18 or 2X but I followed the chart so I bought a 4X and  it fitted great! The material is awesome! I have a large breast so being able to remove the chest padding was excellent.
5.0,Perfect fit and it looks great on. The lining is a great addition and keeps the wearer warm not letting any wind through. Given as a gift. He put it on right away. :-)
5.0,Very pretty color and fashionable. I wore it today without even washing it and it still felt nice against my skin. Just keep in mind this is a hand wash only item and it should last a long time..
5.0,The quality of the slippers exceeded my expectations.
5.0,These are light and arie. Great for playing net sports.
5.0,"Its durable, has good construction and is easy to operate. A little large than I though it would be, but its a good fit overall."
5.0,Love the way they fit and look. The pockets are the best tho...so much room! I own 5 pairs love them so much.
5.0,"Great quality, look more expensive than they are!"
5.0,So stinking cute and the quality is much better than I expected.
5.0,Love this dress.  The zipper in the back allows it to be snug in all the right places comfortably.  Lots of compliments with this dress.
5.0,Beautiful bracelet- great for smaller wrists
5.0,i love it nice quality
5.0,My husband loved these.  Great for him.  He could separate them  or wear them all together.
5.0,I love this product and when my friends are they all wanted one as well… Some have even said that it makes them lucky!
5.0,My son is 6. he loved it. The quality was actually better than I thought. Came with filters too. It has adjustable drawstring like earloops. There a wired nose bridge to adjust to the face without these two features the mask would not fit correctly and protect anything. Fortunate it does have the drawstring and adjustable nose bridge. So the mask sits nicely against his face. No huge gaps on the side like surgical masks. It's a little.long in length but acceptable  my son is 6.
5.0,Great kid's shirt and well worth the price
5.0,This beanie is quality product at reasonable price. Shipping was fast. Absolutely thrilled with this Christmas gift for my son. He was delighted.
5.0,super soft material
5.0,"Nice quality lenses, perfect fitment in my Spy Dirk Glasses."
5.0,"High quality product with impeccable craftsmanship. My work requires daily business attire, and this belt fits perfectly with a business sue, or casual dressing.  Great product at great price. The MaiKun  company proved  to be very genuine on what they promise to deliver."
5.0,"I brought first pair of shoes, loved them, & bought two more.<br />I suffer from heal pain & plantar fascia.<br />I would recommend these shoes"
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my sister and am now buying one for myself.  Aside from helping a great cause, you are purchasing a very durable bag that carries everything you need and more.  The burlap is also carbon neutral.  My sister takes it everywhere... weekend stays, plane trips, grocery shopping... everywhere!  You will not be disappointed!"
5.0,These are nice and they are soft as long as you are not looking for support they are great.
5.0,Exactly what I needed for the stadium. No issues
5.0,Went perfect with Christmas pajamas! Very soft and warm.
5.0,There is a gold stitching around the emblems..  very pretty.  They did mail this in a flimsy bag but the hat didn’t get crushed. Lastly.. founf the same hat on MLB.com for $20 less
5.0,LOVE THIS DRESS! super sexy yet simple and comfortable
5.0,"I purchased a medium suit. I’m 5’3, 150 and this fits great. I do feel like I could go one size down but overall the material, look and feel is AWESOME! Plus I have wide hips so it may have been hard to pull a small up. I thought that ordering offline AND without trying it on would be a problem but honestly I look slimmer and just amazing!"
5.0,"We haven't owned these shirts that long, but so far, they seem like good quality shirts. The colors are bold, it fits my 5 year old pretty well, and he likes them. I'm really happy with the colors; they aren't vividly bright, but they do stand out. And I love that they are plain shirts - no characters or writing on them. It's nice to have clothes that my son can play in and look a little spiffy too."
5.0,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE SHOES!! AM BUYING THEM IN MORE COLORS!! LOOK GREAT DRESSED UP OR DOWN!!
5.0,"These arrived on time. Which was quick. They are very nice. They are lightweight, I barely know its there. My husband who does not wear jewelry really likes his and is wearing it. I hope they hold up to long wearing."
5.0,This is my most favorite of all gifts!!! It turned out exactly how it looks wonderful. It took a bit longer than expected but well worth it!!!!!
5.0,Exactly as represented
5.0,It was exactly what I needed. It fits and flatters the wrist. It does make a loud ticking noise but I find it soothing. Also the black hands maybe hard to read as some comments said but I do not find it cumbersome.
5.0,"Perfect replica of Hiccups in 3rd movie of sturdy rubber.  I added some support, felt inside and changed the hinges for the face plates for wearing at Comic Con.  Really comfortable.  Lots of compliments and pictures!  Worth the money."
5.0,I've gotten so many compliments on this bikini!! the bottoms are very cheeky
5.0,"great scarf, great price, not sure what more to say.<br />wear this on a nice fall or spring day.<br />not too short and not too long,<br />and with cats on it? can't go wrong."
5.0,Just received mine today. Looks like the perfect size for a carry-on airline bag. Like that it's so lightweight yet looks very durable. I'll put it to use on my trip next month!
5.0,my daugter has a very hard time finding yoga pants that fit her tiny size and these fit perfectly
5.0,I make jewelry. So I selected these charms to make earrings to sell.
5.0,"Kid wears it without making a fuss or taking them off. I checked the block on all the “spec” review questions, because I wouldn’t trust my kid’s answers anyway. If you’re comparing shoes, these will do great"
5.0,"These are great athletic shirts for my daughter. Fit is perfect- a little bit longer, which I like. Great price too!"
5.0,"Very effective. Somewhat small cloth, you might want to buy a larger one."
5.0,"Really like the feel of the soft leather. The deep purple is a beautiful color. This wallet holds everything I had hoped.. credit cards, phone, medicine, money and lip balm!"
5.0,Husband just loved this hat!
5.0,Fit great and easy to see through.  I dare to even call them cute looking! Having both tinted and hot is really nice!
5.0,This sweater is the perfect fall sweater! It is very nice and light weight but yet still keeps me warm. The colors are beautiful and also perfect for fall. It’s fit is true to size. It has washed very nicely and did not shrink.
5.0,This dress was gorgeous for a photoshoot!!
5.0,"So cute and soft and LONG LEGGED. Fits my 35"" inseam with a little extra. Very soft and we'll nade. Gor so many compliments from people of all ages. Love these leggings."
5.0,Fantastic socks.  Look and fit like they are supposed to.  Highly recommend.
5.0,"Amazing !! It hides my problem areas ( stomach , butt, and even thighs) Keeps my BIG girls secure & trendy too!! Love love love ! I actually paired the top with black Barton's from target ( way cheaper ) so yourself a favor & BUY this one !"
5.0,"I bought the black/black and cream/black shemagh. Being they were my first online purchase of a shemagh, I was very happy with the quality of the material; they have the appropriate thickness, sheerness and provide the appropriate warmth."
5.0,I wear this most days and I started seeing a difference after the first week. It is comfortable to wear and adjustable. The price is phenomenal. Helps with working out and training the abdomen area. Will definitely last a few months
5.0,"I LOVE the freedom (no straps, no tight fitting) this wonderful product gives you!  It's comfortable -- don't even know you have it on -- and covers perfectly and even brought my 70 year old girls up to where they used to be!  I wear a ""C"" cup and ordered a ""D"" and it gives the perfect coverage.  I'm throwing away all my regular bras and ordering more...."
5.0,This is the perfect size for everyday use instead of a purse. I removed the front tag and added a couple of pretty patches I ordered. Two spots for water bottles is a double plus for me.
5.0,ease of using.  other bands were difficult to use  this one was great
5.0,"Got this dress for a themed dinner and i didnt want to spend alot of money.  Its way better than i expected, fit great, looked great and i would actually wear it again!"
5.0,"La tela es cómoda, suave y se ven súper bien"
5.0,Super cute earrings and I have really sensitive skin and these haven’t made me break out or be super sore. I love them
5.0,Nice little everyday ring. Dainty yet strong.
5.0,"Very cool, nostalgic looking medallion pin. The patina makes it look like it came off an old Indian. You could grind the actual fastening pin/clasp on the backside and use a fix it to an old Indian."
5.0,Nice glasses..
5.0,Love the look. Top Notch.
5.0,I love the no show for my daughter!! I especially like the no slip grip on the bottom of the socks.
5.0,Ordered a small fits like a medium boys.<br />Will down size next time.
5.0,"Well made strap that looks good, supports my guitars (I have one on my hollow body and one on my strat) and was perfectly priced."
5.0,Fast shipping. Can be adjusted in size easily. Colors are solid. Great price! Will order for them again.
5.0,Not too bad- not the sturdiet BUT will work for what we need which is an emergency pair of perscription sun glasses… aka we use these to make his regular glasses into sunglasses and it works in a pinch! Highly recommend if you are someone who break or looses sun glasses a lot
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for.  Room for personal items, credit cards and my Kindle.  I would be lost without it."
5.0,So far love this new canopy for my umbrella frame. Always have an issue with fading as it stands in direct sun for hours to protect my plants during summer heat but so far the color is beautiful and still bright.
5.0,I LOVE these cable knit tights. Super cute and thick and especially live the grips on the bottom.
5.0,Couldn't be happier. Exactly what I was looking for. Arrived in perfect condition and on time. Would highly recommend.
5.0,"I've been wearing it every day for 3 months, even when I workout and it still looks like day 1"
5.0,"My new favorite sock! Extremely comfortable great cushioning, well made, fun to wear"
5.0,Beautiful and its just like the picture.. Great quality
5.0,"If you like simple black wallets that go with everything this is perfect. It's just the right size to put your phone in if you need to. Matte finish, durable strap. Would buy again."
5.0,A very good looking sporran for the price.
5.0,Very pretty sparkling ring I wear it everyday the gold plating is still shiny. I recommend it highly .
5.0,It does the job for me while I surf the Flow Rider in the cold. It’s 2 -mm thick so you’ll still feel chilly if the temp is in the 50s (F) so you may consider a little thicker jacket if you’re cold blooded or wimpy. I plan to get a thicker shortie when i go to Norway
5.0,Love My New Mopar Hat.<br />I highly recommend it.<br />It's now my Favorite of all.
5.0,"I loved how no matter how much I sweat and danced in this bra, it did not move. I slept in it on accident and the bra was still in place. Plus it looked great on me."
5.0,"These thermals are wonderful!! They do run a little small so I’d order up a size. We just spent a week in Whistler/Vancouver Canada and they kept me nice and toasty. I loved the turtle neck on the top. That really helped to keep my neck warm. They’re lined with fleece so they’re nice and warm and make for good under layers because they’re not too thick. Overall, great set."
5.0,"I adore these earings, the teal ones are my favorite. Very pretty"
5.0,Perfect for what I need! Awesome product !!
5.0,Love these...anything by YogaReflex is awesome...<br />Have two pair of shorts and 5 pair of capris...<br />My everyday go to clothes! xo
5.0,"Soft light material, has POCKETS, and fit perfectly."
5.0,At the price I did not expect the quality of the jersey. My husband was very surprised.
5.0,"These are a great way to spruce up your glasses.  I bought this because I lost one of my nose guards and needed a replacement.  Happily it arrived with two sets (small and large), both of which would fit anyone - so now I have a backup.  The only thing I wish was easier is putting the bands on the sides - that  took some persistence!  Now if only the replacement lenses didn't cost as much as the glasses..."
5.0,I absolutely adore them! They are beautiful!
5.0,"Ok, so I am super impressed I usually wear a size 14-16, and this fit me perfectly by the sizing chart. It gave me extra room in the bust, but has a perfectly fitted waist to show off my curves. It's not cut straight, but instead has a very feminine cut. The length also incorporates a little extra length in the back so my substantial rear-end doesn't end up making the dress shorter in the back, which is a problem I often have with swing dresses. I originally intended to wear it with leggings, but the length I feel comfortable wearing without, which made me soo happy! I got so many compliments wearing it! Also, the fabric is slimming and very comfortable and cool. It feels like it will keep its shape."
5.0,Fits perfectly everywhere but a little large in the cups.  Came faster than expected!
5.0,These were a wonderful addition to the ceremony to have a picture of a special loved one that had passed away.
5.0,Sooooo cute. High quality. Vivid colors. Great gift idea!
5.0,"I bought for my 16 years old daughter, she love it, the material is really strong"

5.0,Totally great and trendy product. Good quality for the price! Love them.
5.0,The whole watch was pretty much all I was hoping for.  It's attractive and easy to keep on without pinching etc.  The price was right and delivered right to my door by Amazon !
5.0,"I am 5’7” 195lbs. I usually wear 1x and I bought 1x.  I bought to wear under my scrubs. I wanted a second skin fit and that’s what this is. Although it is snug, I can move in it easily! Super soft. Sleeves come down just past my wrists and length down over my hips. Doesn’t ride up when you raise your arms. Colors are vibrant. Haven’t washed them yet, but hopeful they will not lose shape or color. Worth the money honey!"
5.0,Comfy and cute fits regular ordered size
5.0,I love this brand.  Everything is very good quality.  Is till have this hat

5.0,My dad had these when I was a kid and every time I got a sore throat I'd wear one to bed and the next day would feel great.  I didn't buy this for looks I bought this for the same effect of my dad's. It looks great but it keeps my neck nice and cozy on cold mornings or when I have a sore throat
5.0,Love these caps! Always get compliments on this. Will be purchasing more!
5.0,Love these shoes So cute the price is right! I would love them in all the colors

Featuring 925 Sterling Silver plated with 18K Gold shaped into an attractive Paperclip Link Chain design, every woman of distinction should wear Milacolato’s gorgeous Paperclip Link Chain Necklace.<br /><br />The photo is intended to showcase the Milacolato Paperclip Link Chain Necklace.

The Milacolato Paperclip Link Chain Necklace is simply a beautiful, eye-catching accessory that’s affordably priced. I like that.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Milacolato Paperclip Link Chain Necklace to everyone."
5.0,"Very nice.  Arrived in a very cute package with a polish cloth.  Earrings are lightweight and pretty.  I love sterling silver (only wear it and white gold as I am not a fan of yellow gold) and these are just up my alley.  If they have them in a 3 inch, I will get them as well as you can never go wrong with a classic hoop earring."
5.0,"Disagree with reviewer who said handles fell off—highly doubtful. Nice idea this bag, but rather smaller than expected. Even so, it’s perfect for toiletries and versatile. I’ve taken it overseas with no problems. I don’t understand the negative reviews. If they were available, I’d buy another one."
5.0,"Great socks, true to picture with colors"
5.0,Gave it to my best friend for her birthday she loved it.

5.0,The post broke off of one within two weeks.
5.0,I was realistic that I wouldn’t look as good as the model but omg do I look cute!!! This is such a cute top. I’m a 36C and bought a large. It’s perfect.
5.0,lightweight and very pretty!
5.0,"It fit my husband very well. He loved the style and comfort of It! He wants more colors, so I will be ordering more! Great purchase"
5.0,"These are a little burst of gold and turquoise at the earlobe. They're tiny hoops with a ton of class! These are made of Sterling Silver plated with 18K gold. They are stamped inside 925. These pretty earrings are inlaid with 4mm turquoise. They're perfect for small earlobes and they're great for a second hole. I found these easy to open, easy to put on and take off. They click shut on the post once they're in the earlobe hole. They come in a lovely fawn colored velveteen gift bag with a little piece of chamois to keep them polished. An exquisite little hoop earing, perfect as a gift for someone who loves gold and turquoise."
5.0,I love them..looks really good..
5.0,Has button to help hold hood on and the strings are attached which is nice so you don’t lose it  Very soft
5.0,"My favorite purchase. Very comfortable, blocks all of the light, ear plugs are regular but a good bonus"
5.0,"Really pleased with this purchase! I bought this to spice up a couple of dresses for wedding season. The hard metal goes until my hip, where the light tan fabric comes in."
5.0,"I’m a hair dresser. Wear daily, hair does not stick. Color and bleach does not show at all . Wash and hang dry . Bought several from this designer, wear with leggings covers lower portions nicely!"
5.0,I love these watch  it looks better in person than the picture it's my favorite : )
5.0,These sleeves fit my arms just fine. I’ve had no issues of it being too tight or loose. Definitely recommend these and they’re cheap!

5.0,"Decent suit for what you pay, size ran a little small otherwise good."
5.0,Nice and soft; great buy for the money. J
5.0,"Even though it was a little lose but it is nice, I believe a little alteration will make it perfect ."
5.0,Nice clean lines and not too tight.  Definately go by the CINCH APPAREL size chart.  I usually buy Medium because I don't like a tight fit across the chest.  The small fits just fine and gives me room to breathe.  5ft 2 and 120lbs if that helps!
5.0,I wear Merrill's and for Winter they r perfect.
5.0,Loved them. Super comfy.
5.0,My son wanted to put these pj's on as soon as he saw them. They fit true to size. They are soft & didnt shrink in the was. Great buy!
5.0,"I love these socks, I wear a mens size 11.5 shoe 4E wide and the extra large fit me perfectly. I was worried about them claiming womens socks but trust me they are exactly what I wanted. If you have a wide foot and larger than size 12 these may be too small for you, I feel like if my foot was any bigger they would be too tight."
5.0,Very Happy!!
5.0,I love the thin keychain time piece.  Easy to read
5.0,Just like the ad - amazing!  Lightweight and gorgeous on!!!  Going to buy more colors.
5.0,"Watches are great for the price and work like a charm! Had a little difficulty shortening the band with the tool provided. I had to use some pliers and a hammer to really get the pins out, but once they're out, it's fairly simple to shorten! Reached out to their customer support and they responded relatively quickly and even provided a video on how to shorten. Overall, really happy with the purchase and would buy them again."
5.0,absolutely love it.  i can wear bracelets that I haven't been able to put on in years.
5.0,Great item. Fits as expected
5.0,Excellent !!! Perfect for everything don’t know what else to say ! 100% suggest getting it !!

5.0,"This is a super cute set. It is velour and a tiny bit sparkly. My daughter is on the smaller<br />Side, and the top was a bit too small, but the pants were quite large. It’s a really great quality outfit that is just adorable!"
5.0,my son loves them for boxing
5.0,I'm really pleased with the quality and comfort of this shirt.

5.0,Easy to cut and assemble. Fits and looks great.
5.0,"Bought this for my boyfriend who just bought a BEAUTIFUL brand-new Harley.  He is a MAJOR prepster, so he needed a biker jacket.  This jacket is an incredible buy -- truly amazing, excellent quality.  I grew up around motorcycles, attended dozens of Bike Weeks, and I've had my own Brooks biker jacket (purchased in 1984) for 30 years.  I have a feeling this jacket will last my &#34;Rolex Rider&#34; 100 years."
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous! I am 5'3&#34; and the length was just long enough that it touches the floor. It probably wouldn't fit, lengthwise, on someone who is much taller, though. There is a little bit of a train. My heel got caught in it a couple times, so you'll want to be careful of that. The material is very &#34;slinky&#34; and clings to my body. I also did not put this on a hanger because I was nervous that the weight of the dress would stretch the top since there is significantly less material. The dress is beautiful though and I am very excited to wear it!"
5.0,Nice bra!!  Does not show up under sheer clothing!
5.0,I have not even one complaint this purse is so beautiful I couldn’t even believe the quality I had gotten I was expecting something way different. It will sure last me a long time. I am very pleased with this purchase I will be buying some more in the future. I can’t wait to show it off.
5.0,"Heavy duty material.  Seams finished nicely.  Excellent coverage.  Love the foot metal to rotate<br /><br />Must use with add-on base.  The recommended base doesn’t fit well and in a strong wind, the umbrella wobbles when open."
5.0,Fly AF
5.0,The watch works good. Satisfied with purchased.
5.0,Good so far. I bought these because I get migraines while driving home due to the head on bright headlights. These glasses change the hue to a yellow color which isn't as strong.
5.0,"Bought this for my 12 yo daughter. Great quality print. Fits right. She won't take it off. Has worn it for 5 days straight. Honestly, it's getting a bit funky, but she doesn't care."
5.0,Beautiful and stylish frames!  Vision worked excellently going from the computer to the written page and then looking up and speaking to people.  Excellent value!!  Fast shipping also!
5.0,lightweight and very cute.  I am very pleased with my purchase.

5.0,Love. Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"The perfect dust mask, no more fogged glasses"
5.0,"Folds up tiny, yet big enough for an overnight bag. I love it"
5.0,"Cute shirt, nice material weight...just be aware that it does run small.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 113 lbs and typically wear a size Small...the size Medium in this shirt fit, but was more of a slim fit. I ended up exchanging it for the size Large as it looked better on and gave me the ability to tie the shirt in the front if I want to."
5.0,My daughter it’s a HUGE fan and loves then we use them everyday
5.0,Great quality and super cute! Fits true to size!
5.0,"My husband really liked his watch. It's not fancy or nothing, just right to wear outside to work with."
5.0,"The material is soft, the zipper worked great and extremely comfortable to  walk around in."
5.0,like the color and holds full size ID.  Metal ring to secure is strong.
5.0,I like the shirt but either I’ve gained weight or one should buy a size up. This shirt I wish it was two sizes up.
5.0,"While I am giving the real watch a solid 5 star rating because I own it, the watch pictured in this particular listing looks like a fake or has been tampered with. The date on the real watch is white on a blackish background and not black on white as shown here."
5.0,These sterling silver rhinestone long earrings are very nice and fashionable and great quality. I recommend this item.
5.0,Very sturdy and easy to use.

5.0,Great quality of this product. Excellent customer service.
5.0,"Nice!<br />After losing my glasses in the house repeatedly, I decided to try these.<br />So glad the retainer doesn’t hurt my ears.<br />That would have been a deal breaker.<br />They adjust well, after just a little practice.<br />They also fit snugly onto the glasses , even if removed.<br />I asked hubby to try the second retainer, because I was so happy.<br />He likes wearing it too. His glasses are no longer sliding down his nose, which had been an issue for years<br />Very, very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Arrived quickly!  Washes well. Fits as expected.
5.0,They arrived sooner than expected which was awesome!  Love my new rainboots
5.0,Thank you for an excellent product and super fast shipping and wonderful packing.
5.0,"I love these for my french cuff shirts - I bought several pair and end up coming back to these the majority of the time.  Not too large to be gaudy for women / women's shirts, they fit mine perfectly."
5.0,"Love these glasses! Great for riding, inexpensive and super dark tint. Will definitely buy again!"
5.0,"Its lightweight and comfortable for the warmer weather. I'd  say, true to size. Abd a really cute and fun pj set!"
5.0,"This is a great fit! Quality material, and stitching is nice. The front hemline hangs perfectly. Not too long in the front, and long enough in the back. One thing I would do differently- the straps need to be adjustable. Otherwise- perfect design! Overall- Still giving five stars! Great gift idea, too!"
5.0,This is a cute little custom dress. My daughter loved it.
5.0,"This is one of those accessories that I tore into the moment the mail man was off the front porch!  As a big kid trying to get into shape (a less round shape, that is!) I have been putting a LOT of time into my shoes and the laces were...well, let's say they have been a bike chain casualty more than once.  I tore those raggedy old laces out and slid this thin bungee-cord type string right in, evened them up, slid on the cinch slider and snapped on the plastic end, pulled my shoes on and was SOOOOO happy with this choice!  Right off the bat I knew I wanted to shorten the cord and it was easy to pop the plastic end off, snip about an inch off the laces and then put the plastic end back on.  They look great in my runners and even have a reflective ribbon on them to help improve your night safety.  My 3 big kids are begging for sets of these too!<br />I did receive this product at no cost in return for my absolutely honest review."
5.0,I love these pajamas for my granddaughter.  She look so beautiful Christmas morning.  The fit is nice and no defects.  Thank you.
5.0,My favorite bag so glad I found this !
5.0,Product is very breathable and my little loves using it because it doesn’t hurt her ears like when wearing a mask. Very cute too

5.0,Love this bathing suit. Very flattering!
5.0,Emxcellebt product!  Stylish and practical water shoe!
5.0,It fits good on my curvy body and the quality feels good too. I got a size small  since I like fitted clothes.  It fits good.
5.0,The hat I got was black and I wanted a black hat. Love it.
5.0,"I love these under my tight fitting dress pants, to make me feel firm and sleek.  The perforated version of their mid-thigh shorts is so much more comfy and feels so good on my skin, compared to the ones without the perforations.  I have both, and these are the bomb!!  Highly, highly recommended."
5.0,"This dress fits amazing! I feel slimming and very comfortable. Fabric feels like soft poly/nylon blend but also a bit silky. Highly breathable. Do reccomend wearing pantyhose or spanx so you dont have a panty line. All in all very good. Hard to find stuff that fits when you are 5 feet, 190 and rapidly loosing weight. And also have a short torso. So very happy"
5.0,Bought these for our grandchildren who love the Bluey cartoons. These masks make wearing a mask more appealing for children who may be reluctant to wear one. They are cute and comfortable!
5.0,"Love this! Fits perfect, super soft and easy to button, and is an awesome and easy one piece outfit for summer."
5.0,They work great for mowing

5.0,"My husband is an athlete and buys these routinely. They provide comfort and are moisture wicking. He loves these socks! They wash up beautifully. They arrived in just a few days, which is always good thing."
5.0,cool color good fit  nice hat
5.0,"If you must wear a compression sock, I recommend you try this one, Dr. Scholl's sock. I've tried 4-5 different brands this year and this is the best so far."
5.0,Colors did not fade.
5.0,Love this shirt . Fits like a T-shirt. Looks dressy with black pants l
5.0,LOVE these headbands!
5.0,Fast shipment.. true size
5.0,Love this dress!  Fits perfectly!
5.0,"Fantastic Polo socks. I bought these in hopes that they were similar or the same as Polo's 3 pack which is much more expensive. They definitely are and fit just as well if not better than the grey, black, and white pack. I wear a size 13 4E wide shoe and these fit me very well and hold up to me wearing them around the house with no loose thread issues.<br /><br />They do become a tad softer and looser after washing once or twice so if you buy these and they appear a tad too tight, wear them for a little while or wash them a few time, they should be much more comfortable afterwards."
5.0,"My 8 yr old son likes it, warm"
5.0,"Makes breathing much easier, you just have to be sure it is secure inside the mask"
5.0,"The bag arrived quickly and was exactly as shown in the picture. Excellent quality!  There was no odor in the bag as I had seen on other reviews of other purses I had looked at. Three large pockets.  The 2 outside sections snap shut and the center section zips closed with a small cosmetic pocket inside.  Small outside pocket, which zips, is perfect access for my keys. I would definitely recommend this purse to a friend."
5.0,Great sunglass strap!!  Very pretty colors.
5.0,Super cute! Looks just like picture and is a good size.
5.0,What a sweet hat. Fits just perfect. I hate those super slouchy Beanies. This one fits just perfect !!!. I thought it would be alittle lighter in color but not a problem.
5.0,great necklace for kids they loved them... i wanted to wear it myself
5.0,"Gift, roomy and makes a statement!"
5.0,Beautiful shirt.. a little on the itchy side. Boutique style at its best.
5.0,I LIKED IT
5.0,It's a lil thicker than I thought but it's what was needed great material good butI would highly recommend
5.0,"This is another excellent product from this company. I have four or five shirts from them, and they've all been great. We had a recent long cool spell, so I got to try out all my long-sleeved shirts.<br /><br />The shirt is very well made, and the black is flattering, a nice shade of black, and very, very soft and comfortable.<br /><br />I like that it's a Henley shirt, and I love the buttons on it. It fits exactly as expected, just like everything else I've ever ordered from this company, and fit is true to size.<br /><br />Excellent product by a reliable company that has sent me nothing but top quality, beautiful, true to size, comfortable shirts that are just as the listing describes them. I look for this company and order from them as often as I can."
5.0,"I really, really like this ring. It is exactly what I was looking for. Got it as a Christmas present and have worn it non stop! Very durable, no stones to worry about. Pretty engraved design. Gotten a lot of compliments on it too. I know it has even inspired other people I know to go out and get new bands or update what they have, and I know they're spending a lot more than the cost of this one at local jewelry stores. Can't say enough good things about it!"
5.0,"I think these things are hilarious. Everyone loves them. I feel like I'm a celebrity when I have them on because men want to be me and women want to be with me. I was a virgin when I got these and I still am, but I've almost changed that twice already! The only drawback is that these are a bit hard to see through, but they're only glasses so no big deal."
5.0,This item looks so cool. Best costume  accessory! Fits well. Moves smoothly. Looks great!
5.0,Quality material and construction. Perfect size for lunch and beverages.
5.0,Looks amazing! So funny!  Arrived sooner than expected!!!
5.0,"My granddaughter loves these slides. She's 9 and i got her size 3, she wears them everywhere."
5.0,"I am 5' 3&#34; tall, 145 lbs, 36C. I ordered the blue in large, and it was not a snug fit, nor was it too big. It does have a little 'wiggle room' for any extra pounds I may gain before within 3 months of the event I am wearing it to. The best part of this dress is my beer belly looks flat in this dress, it hides the rolls pretty well!! This dress is the perfect length, it barely touches the floor without shoes. My dress is well made. The material is a little different than what I am used to in a dress. The slip goes to just below my knees, and you can see the legs from the knee down, which is the style these days. It is low cut, depending on your posture. The dress arrived within 2 days, in a small plastic bag, which was inside a bubble wrapped large envelope. When I tried it on, it had lots of wrinkles, but still looked beautiful, wrinkles and all! The description the company gives is accurate. Because the dress is $30, I may order another dress in another color, depending on how well it holds up! Try this dress, you can always return it if it does not live up to your expectations."
5.0,Amazing Good Quality and Value for money
5.0,Great fit !!! My husband Loves it he usually has trouble with the sleeves being too short this Jacket fits perfectly!!!
5.0,Use it every day. Love it!
5.0,Love the material.  Stretchy and soft.  Gives comfortable support.  Look great
5.0,Perfect comfy yoga pants. True to size. Exactly what I was looking for. I’m 5’1 135lbs and typically wear a medium. I ordered a medium and they fit perfectly.
5.0,"I really like these! I’m glad I read the review because I ordered a size down (like everyone suggested) and they fit perfectly! I am 5’9”, 130 lbs and an XS fits perfect! They passed the squat test :)"
5.0,"So far, so good. No issues and has held up to the wind."
5.0,I would consider this red heart link my most beautiful link of all.  I made my mom a link bracelet with all four of her children's names and I used this red heart with the names.  It adds a beautiful touch to the names.  Can not wait to give to my mom.
5.0,"Purchased this dress to wear for Easter. Got many compliments on it, and it's such a reasonable price! It was too long for me to wear with flats but in heels it was a great length."
5.0,"Beautiful color, washes up nicely and fits true to size."
5.0,"These fit over thin wired glasses as well as bulky frames. Several family members laughed at my husband's glasses, but after trying them, they ordered their own. Comfy, stay on, and can flip up if you need to see something without polarized lenses."
5.0,Beautiful and cute. Perfect size.
5.0,"Super cute, and comes in different colors"
5.0,Gorgeous colors
5.0,"I bought these to wear on vacation with skirts and over-sized shirt. I am 5' 6&#34;, 125 lbs, I got a small and they fit snug/comfy. They are a bit more athletic (slight sheen) than I expected, but they are super comfortable and have a tiny change pocket hidden in front. Also, a long t-shirt or cotton dress slides nicely over them when I walk, which is nice."
5.0,"I love these! I bought the amethyst, jade and opalite pack. They're beautiful, genuine stone and look really nice too! Very happy and will buy again from this seller. :)"
5.0,It is so cute!! I haven't taken this necklace off since I received it and set up my little family stones:) I have zero complaints.
5.0,Totally blown away with how wonderful this purse is! Mine was well made and cuter than expected great price!
5.0,Great look and good fit. Very stylish yet comfortable and easy to care for. Excellent for exercise or casual wear.
5.0,"I love it. I'm in the process of losing weight so I wasn't sure what size is should get so I purchased for the size I want to be which is a medium. I'm fitting that better than I could have thought. I'm just over 5 ft 4 in and 179 pounds most of the weight is thighs, hips, and butt. If I weren't trying to lose weight the large would have been a perfect fit."
5.0,Came in and looked as advertised fit perfectly for my girlfriend would purchase from the seller again
5.0,"I almost never buy clothes online because I'm afraid if the quality is poor; however, this hoodie feels amazing! I love the soft cotton material inside and the outside is slightly silky and overall is super cute! The details of the bottom of the hoodie look amazing and super detailed and I love the laced upsides. I am a giant fan of Nier:Automata, but I was never into cosplaying so finding something so casual yet cute was an amazing find. The Hoodie is super big too which I like and can cover my eyes and there are pockets! Overall very good quality. My only complaint is that it's a little too small around my waist. I'm 5'5, 120lbs and ordered a size small, so I'm thinking of ordering another in medium because I like my clothes being a little baggy.<br /><br />So for anyone else who plans on buying this, I recommend ordering a size up so you can properly lace up the sides."
5.0,Super warm and extremely comfortable. Would recommend to anyone.
5.0,Excellent good condition. Highly recommend. It met my expectations. I will buy again.
5.0,"Love these! I just moved to the Midwest from az and wear a pair of these every day under my clothes, also to the gym. i especially like that they are long enough to wear over the back of my foot if I want to..They are fantastic..Thin enough to layer, high quality enough to be worn alone ...Love love love them"
5.0,although it is cheap.. but it doesn't look like it. I have had it for several months now and I have not lost any coins from it.. I keep it in its bag
5.0,"Loose flowing dress,  comfortable to pull on whenever or dress up and wear out.  Great come combination."
5.0,Very comfortable.  I am glad I chose these. Delivery was on time.
5.0,it is very hard if you are a large person to find the proper clothes to begin to work out in so that you can become a smaller person... These fit me great and I will definitely be ordering more as I begin to drop the pounds.. but it is great to know that they have a large size that can help me reach my goal!
5.0,Good item. Fast shipment.
5.0,I purchased this for my daughter. She is a dancer and athletes. These are some of her favorites to wear around the house and to her events.
5.0,"Simply fabulous. This came much quicker than expected and through regular mail. I opened it in the car as I was heading out the house when I got the mail, put it on and BOOM!!! PERFECT!!! I'm 5'8&#34; 175lbs and it fits my wrist just fine."
5.0,"Nice and stretchy!  I wear long, light weight tanks under just about everything because I am paranoid about butt cleavage showing.  This item fits the bill.  Fits as expected, covers the entire bottom area without compromising boob coverage.  Keep in mind, since its thin and tight it will show every imperfection.  That's not an issue for me since I wear layers all year round, but I thought I'd share!"
5.0,"No sure how this is going to fit as it was given as a gift, so difficult to rate for warmth, comfort!! I’m hoping they will like however"
5.0,Perfect fit great cleats durable n love all the extra laces
5.0,"Since I’ve gotten this purse the residents in my city now call me the “eco conscious queen”. Just kidding. In all honesty it’s nice and a very good environmental choice, I eventually want to take the brand name off it just looks to out there since the bag is so minimalist. It’s also water resistant and comes with a strap, yippie!"
5.0,"I love this headband! I’ve gotten tons of compliments while out in public and it makes me feel so good about myself when I have it on! My only complaint is that the rhinestone part separated from the actual headband. I’m not sure what caused this to happen, but my headband is in two parts, but still connected, if that makes sense? My boss said I could borrow her hot glue gun to recombine the two parts, but I still feel that this shouldn’t have happened, especially so soon after buying it. But another positive, this headband is beyond comfortable and you can’t even feel it on your head while it’s on! And it doesn’t slip! It stays in place, and I am a nanny to 2.5 year old triplets and I can wear it the entire day without having to readjust it or anything! I highly recommend this product, just recommend a stronger adhesive or something to allow the rhinestones and headband to stay together longer!"
5.0,Surprising quality for the price.
5.0,"I love these scrubs. It fit me, a curvy girl, very well."
5.0,It has the support a needed to look good at the pool! Fit better than expected and bought it in my normal bra size. Love it!!
5.0,The shirts were exactly as described and arrived quickly. They were well worth the price
5.0,Beautiful and sturdy. Fast arrival!
5.0,"I purchased it as a gift my my friend.  It is quite lovely.  The &#34;metal&#34; emblem is beautiful and the leather is soft and of quality.  I am very pleased with the bracelet.  It &#34;stands out&#34; in a crowd.And, the receiver is too.  He wears it everyday since I've given it to him!"
5.0,Great value! cute packaging!
5.0,Beautiful dress but did not fit my body nice
5.0,Perfect travel size. I only took one item on an economy flight and it was so easy to use for all my purse needs.
5.0,Nice and simple.  Excellent!!!
5.0,sure the baby will love due in april
5.0,I like this bra.  I finally have a bra I can wear with my low-cut things which won't show.  Side benefit--it keeps things smoother on the sides; the girls stay in front where they belong.
5.0,exactly as agreed
5.0,Love these pants! Fit like a glove.  Very flattering.  I wear a size 16 and I ordered xlarge.  Dried and pants are wrinkle free.  I'm going to order more
5.0,"Ordered these for a friend who's using them on a craft project.  She loved them. Made well, bright colors, came next day. Packaged well."
5.0,"LIVEBEAR may be my new favorite socks. I received two free pair of these grey and off-white w/specks after reviewing other different ones I bought and liked them so much I had to get more. They are soft, comfortable, and stretchy. Much easier to put on than the white socks I bought from a store. I will probably buy other prints because they are so fun and comfy."
5.0,This keychain is so pretty and well made! Great quality!
5.0,These masks are really cute and the adjustable straps are a plus. My 7 year old loves them.
5.0,Sandals are my go to summer footwear. These are well made and last. I got 2-1/2 years from my first pair. Plus you have two bottle openers with you at all times.  What else do you need ?
5.0,I officiated my niece's wedding in a beautiful field and these were a lifesaver...and a hit...everyone was impressed and the women wanted them.
5.0,After reading the reviews I ordered a size larger than the sizing charts. They fit excellent and are super comfy. For everyday activity and light workout the support is great. I've not tried it for a vigorous workout yet. Thus far they are the best sports bras I've ever owned.
5.0,Beautiful ring! Comfortable and true to size. Will be ordering from this vendor again...luv this ring💖
5.0,"Great strap for twice the price.  Comfortable, great leather smell and a good length."
5.0,"Love the look of these bangles I had to order another pair! I ordered a 9 to make sure my hand would go through and they look cute with my other stainless steel accessories. They are not heavy at all, they are shiny  and I love hearing the clinking sound. Lol. Now that I am incorporating more silver accessories to my daily fashion, these bangles are a great fit to add to my collection. I’ve wanted Sterling silver bagels for sometime now but didn’t want to pay the price. Seeing these stainless steel bangles for a fraction of the cost was even better!"
5.0,Just as the picture shows!  Great looking
5.0,I love big brim hats and I love the color of this hat. It is a nice rich navy blue. I used my hand steamer to get the creases out.
5.0,My boyfriend LOVED IT! A small token of love for our first month anniversary! 😍
5.0,"Nice weight, comfortable and very attractive."
5.0,Like the print and the durability.
5.0,"I got this gym back a few weeks ago, and I have not been disappointed. It is very lightweight, which is very convenient. It is also very durable despite being light. It’s small but surprisingly can fit a lot of clothes/towels/shoes with no problem. I’m definitely satisfied with the order overall"
5.0,"Whoever invented fleece lined pants is a genius. As someone who is chronically freezing, these are a must have in the winter and I honestly don’t know how I lived without them for so long. The sizing was a little difficult to figure out, especially if you’re used to referring to a number that means nothing. I am 5’2” ~115 pounds and I ordered the 30l x 30w. The length is great, but the waist is a little big and I probably would have been better off with a 29w but I wear a belt and they’re fine.  On top of being super warm and comfy, the slim fit looks cute too. I will be purchasing many more pairs."
5.0,Beautiful and stylish.  Great price too. I love them.
5.0,Must have for Bears fans!
5.0,OMG! Beautiful color! Better than I expected. Quality is good also. Good fit.
5.0,I loe the way it hugged the body
5.0,Love the lace
5.0,Great hat! Nice way to show support for our troops and looks cool too! :)
5.0,Great glasses for the money ! Someone stole my $300.00 Maui Jim's so I thought I would give these a try ... Not a lot of differnce from the MJ's.
5.0,Thi coat fit as expected and keeps our grabdaughter warm!
5.0,"Great, inexpensive glasses."
5.0,Super comfy. Don't ride. Great with my high wasted pants and skirts. And beautiful colors
5.0,"I bought this for my male friend. He likes a leather bracelet but they kept breaking. He found this one and because it has a braided look (like his leather ones), we decided it would be worth a try. It is beautiful but manly and he will never have to worry about losing it due to breakage. I am so impressed by this bracelet's look and sturdyness that I am thinking of buying one for my son-in-law."
5.0,Perfect fit for my 21 month old!
5.0,Nice belts. Love the sound when adjusting the fit.
5.0,Gift for my son. He said he likes it.
5.0,"Great quality, used for wedding"
5.0,Soft and flowing
5.0,There are no dislikes. Love everything about it. Great colors and love the old AF Insignia.
5.0,Husband absolutely loved it!
5.0,Son loves the Halloween costume.
5.0,Love the colors and material. They stretch with your head and are tight enough to put your helmet on and take it off without losing its place. Worth the price.
5.0,"It’s a great, thick sweatshirt. It’s just what I wanted, and I received it super fast. It fits fine because I know to size up in women’s Harley clothes. Their women’s clothes tend to run snug."
5.0,It commemorates the first album that changed rap forever!
5.0,"Just as expected. It has a nice strong clip and the design is bright, sharp, and looks good just as advertised"
5.0,"From my wife - “This fleece is so cute and super soft but I wish I ordered true to size instead of sizing down like some reviews said. I ordered a small and while it did fit, it was a bit short in the length and more form fitting than I wanted. For reference I’m 5’-4” and 145 lbs and reordered in a size medium.”"
5.0,Bright colors. Super cute and comfortable.
5.0,Love it. Best watch ever
5.0,The necklace came quickly. My daughter wanted it to give out for Christmas presents. All 3 necklaces look very nice.
5.0,Bought it to swap out the mud color straps. The black straps look and feel exactly like the straps that came with the watch. Love that the wrench was included to do it myself.
5.0,"Cute, thick material. Too small (I wear a large to to 1x in bottoms usually, a 1x to 2x in tops) I ordered 2xx and it would only zip half way. So sad :("
5.0,"These earrings are exactly as described.  I received the earrings within 72 hours of ordering and the size is exactly as described.  They appear to be well made.  I have worn them several times, and given the current time in our history, a good comment to make is that they hang nicely outside of a face mask when worn.  They don't get stuck behind the ear loops.  Sounds strange that even had to say that, but yeah, they look great with a face mask."
5.0,These are so comfortable. They're the perfect thickness so you don't see through them or your underwear outline. I love wearing them to yoga and around the house.
5.0,"I purchased another one of these in the size recommended and it was very loose on me. I loved the product though, so decided to size down. The recommended size for me is 3 x. 1X fits me perfectly though. This is gorgeous. I get so many compliments on this style."
5.0,Wanted a mask for my son that wasn't girlie and that he didn't mind wearing all day at college. Mask was a hit but should have bought more because I'm washing it every day.
5.0,I love this material an this coverup
5.0,I love this. It fits perfectly and I have gotten many comments.
5.0,Good material and comfortable. I ordered one size up for room.
5.0,"I was not sure but when they arrived I like them because they look even better in live, pretty nice."
5.0,"For $25 you can’t go wrong.  Every expensive pair of sunglasses I’ve owned have been stolen.  These are now my regular SG for running.  They are light, do the job, and look cool (I think)."
5.0,Dress is everything but u will need tape for boobs if they are a size D like mine. And the green fitted differently than the black one. Black fit was a little more snug
5.0,I ordered this to match an outfit and it was exactly what I had hoped it would be. It’s really pretty.
5.0,sturdy and look great!!!!!
5.0,Really love it.  Just what I wanted!
5.0,I bought these for my granddaughter to wear as she began preschool. She wears them every day and loves them!
5.0,My son loves it he wears it on his twitch channel As he helps other on smash brothers
5.0,"Contrary to what some of the other reviews say, this is not a toddler or child sized band! Band is accurately described and fits my 7050 series watch perfectly (I do have the smaller “ladies” 39mm model). From what I can see, it appears to be the exact same as the original rubber watch band. Looks and feels great, so happy to find a replacement since the Luminox website doesn’t currently have it. Came quickly and was a great price, very happy with my purchase And would definitely recommend to anyone that has the same watch/size."
5.0,"great size, very comfortable ! worth the money ! highly recommend"
5.0,"I was wanting something simple to carry without all of the bulkiness of a huge purse. This is absolutley perfect for me and I love the compactness of this item. The clutch wallet can double as a wristlist. The wrist attachment can be removed so that you can pair it up with a little black dress which is what I did this past weekend. I had a graduation to attend and I chose a black dress that had flowers on it. This clutch was perfect for me and complimented my attire on point. I received several compliments on my clutch and I believe it is due to the gold that adorns each corner on the front. The intricate designs really add character as well as the pebbled stone design on the clutch itself. It shimmers in the light and will definitely catch your eye. I was able to fit my Galaxy 6 phone, money,  coins, credit cards, driver's license, and my keys in the clutch. I also made a quick trip to a store the next day. Instead of changing purses again, I just attached the wristlet extension. I love the fact that I could just grab and go and have every resource I needed in a hurry. I will definitely be utilizing this item at every opportunity as I am in love with it! I do want to add that as though it may seem small, it does have some room on the inside of it. The clutch also zips, so all of your items are secure and you do not have to worry about anything falling out!<br /><br />**Received this item at a discount price. I am leaving my own personal feedback after using the item."
5.0,"All I can say is WOW!!! I received this drop dead gorgeous maxi dress in the mail today and could not possibly be any more satisfied or happy with my purchase! I have a four month old son so I still have alot of baby fat.... But this dress looks AMAZING on me. It has a beautiful soft material and also has a nice stretch to it. It hugs my curves in all the right places! Even though I still have a tummy from being pregnant, the dress looks great without a girdle.... I'll have to try it with one and hopefully can post some pictures! I really do love this dress. I'm 5'2&#34; and I got the x large because I followed the size chart from the company. Also, it doesn't drag so I can wear it with flat sandals if I wish. There size x large was true to the measurements they provided. I think the cups would accommodate a very busty woman as well. The dress is very well made and the quality is very good as well. I did receive this product at a discount, but it is absolutely gorgeous and definitely worth the price. I can't wait to wear it out!!!!<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />I received at a discounted rate for product testing and review.

5.0,"Nice colors, made nice, good material, could have been a little shorter."
5.0,Fantastic quality for being a costume piece. Matches perfectly for a Gryffindor costume or can even be work with a suit. Would for sure purchase again. Great quality at such an amazing price.
5.0,"It says its men's when you search for it but when you click on it, then it will say Women's, however it is men's sizes don't worry. Just order your normal size for men and you will be fine, that's what I did. Condition was amazing too."
5.0,super nice and just as pictured
5.0,Everything was great just waiting on one other  thing
5.0,Glad I finally located this item at Amazon.  It is so hard to find 100% cotton undershirts since national department stores stopped selling them.  This was exactly what I needed to replace worn out too short shirts from Nordstrom years ago.  I wish they came in black as well at this price. Fabric seems comfortably soft to me.
5.0,"Love these shoulder pads, fit perfect.  They make my clothes look so much better"
5.0,I won a pin up contest wearing these so I'd say they are spot on if that's the look your going for. They are form fitting without bulge or looking like they were painted on. Great material if you're doing a lot of movement because they don't loose their stretch. The material also feels nice on my skin. My only con is that I didn't buy more!!
5.0,Pants are great. They are super comfy and cute on. They run a little large.  I got a medium and they fit more like a large but I wanted them baggy.  They are pretty long.  I’m 5’5 and 160 pounds and I ordered a medium.
5.0,"Stretchy, comfy and forgiving. Wore them to an interview and they were super cute."
5.0,"Great shirt, nice thick cotton. I was recommended a M according to my past orders, glad I got a Large cuz Its little tight."
5.0,This is fun gift and it works. The only problem is no instructions so I have no idea how it works or the type of battery it takes or how to pops open. Luckily my family has a watch maker and jewelry stores.
5.0,"These are absolutely beautiful, warm, soft and look elegant.  Great fit with working touch screen finger. Definitely recommend these gloves."
5.0,I got a pair for myself and a pair for my 4 year old niece and we love them.
5.0,Exactly what my nephew wanted. Nice quality
5.0,"Looks classy. For this price doesnt look cheap at all. Can be used on dresses in a party.<br />I have no idea how long this watch would work, but no complains since I know I will get what I paid for."
5.0,Somewhat big but perfect quality very pretty
5.0,"Care and feeding of your soft and cozy sweater is important, be sure to wash gently and dry naturally or the coziness might become a bit too snug. This sweater's color appears consistent with the advertisement and the coziness provided is perfect for mostly still air conditions. The softness will entice you to wear it often as will the flattering drape that accentuates curves where you want them and hides them where you don't, which is why the care and feeding is so important."

5.0,"I needed a hat for a dance audition (All That Jazz). Not knowing if I'd be in the show, the inexpensive price was what I wanted. When the hat arrived the quality exceeded my expectations. I thought it would only be good for rehearsals, but it could easily work for the show."
5.0,Great coverage looking forward to purchasing another pair in a different color

5.0,"I've always wanted a corset so when I had the chance to review one I couldn't jump fast enough.<br />I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised at just how beautiful this really was.<br />The only problem and it was more on my end was the fact that it was too small for me. I normally fit anywhere between an XL and an XXL so I figured this would fit me and it didn't even when I adjusted the ribbon like you can. So if you are a bigger girl like me, just be careful.<br />Definitely worth the money!<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest review."
5.0,Great for the money. I wear one of them at least three times a week
5.0,"Really cool wallet.  I'm using it with an external money clip and cash.  The wallet is a great holder for 4-6 credit cards and a license.  It has a nice pull tab to help get the cards out of the middle slot.  Also, the leather is nicely distressed and looks great!"

5.0,The heart is pretty and the chain is sturdy---if you like a dainty chain this would not be for you as it is on the thicker side.  The nice thing is that you can move the clasp to any part of the chain for a perfect fit.

5.0,Very comfy. Wore it to a friend's Winter wedding and it was perfect

5.0,Nice suit for the price. I am a mom of twins and it hides my mommy tummy very well.
5.0,"This cover-up is meant to be a bigger fit (so keep that in mind) and I think it's adorable. If I wear nude panties and bra, I can even use it as a dress on vacation, because it is ever-so-slightly see-through. I am 5'5&#34;, 135 pounds, 32 DD bust, size 4-6 dress, and the size SMALL fit exactly the way I wanted. It is not form-fitting, it is a little flowy and I can't wait to wear it by the pool and on vacation!"

5.0,Amazing quality!! Best lululemon dile
5.0,I have never seen my son so happy to wear shoes! No kidding he LOVES them. He is seven and usually pretty picky about his shoes not just how they look but also how they feel. As soon as we got these in the mail he had to put them on. He raved about how good they feel. I literally had to make him take them off when it came time for bed. Like I said he is super picky and usually complains about any shoes besides his Skechers. As a mom I love them too. They have great tread for doing what ever the day brings when we go out whether that be hiking or the playground or even going to the lake to play. The inside support is very soft and comfortable for him. I think these shoes will hold up well to as they seem to be very well made. I do want to say I ordered a 1/2 size to big and they fit perfect I should have went up another size. But that is ok I am sure we will buy another pair as these are such a hit. I am also expecting to be asked by all the other moms where I got them. I am including a couple of pictures as you may can tell he is laying in his bed with them on (I usually do not allow but since this was straight out of the box I allowed it this time).<br /><br />**I did receive this item at a discount

5.0,"This is my 2nd purchase! After all, a girl needs a set in both cars! Not only do they fit over my glasses perfectly, but they look good too! I may need a 3rd pair in the near distant future.[[ASIN:B010RJU3B4 Womens Polarized Fit Over Glasses Rhinestone Sunglasses Oval Rectangular Pink]]"

5.0,"Case was 8 dollars, i really needed somethinf to protect my oakley glasses. I have 2 pairs of gas cans, a pair of wisker xl, and hollbrook. This case checked all my boxes. Its sturdy and stiff, it will withstand everything short of you stepping on it. Zipper effectively kept out blowinf sand at the beach.<br /><br />  There are three ways to attach this case, all work well! If the plastic carabiner breaks, at this price you can just buy a metal one to replace it.<br />  My only recommendation is nyou should keep your glasses in a soft microfiber baggie. Helps with rattle!"

5.0,"This is an amazing dress! Comfortable AND classy!!!! I am 5’5” 145ish lbs,  I usually wear medium/size 6, but after reading reviews I ordered small and fits like a glove. Lace is stretchy and could stretch to fit many shapes, so sizing is forgiving! I have this in blue and needed a red dress and instantly thought of this dress! Receiving red dress tomorrow can’t wait! The blue did not have the lace on bottom, but red will be all lace! You will NOT regret this dress it’s a such bargain too!!!!"

5.0,"I was so excited when this wallet got delivered as my old one had finally fallen apart. My old wallet lasted my entire life (I'm 23 years old), and I had a tough time coping with the fact that I had to find a new one.<br /><br />Here comes this thin wallet on Amazon, and my initial thoughts was that I was very impressed. I was looking for a practical slim thin good looking wallet and so far, this one has fit the bill. Currently, I put about 7 cards in the wallet and it feels so much thinner than my old one! The exterior is made of a nice quality leather and the interior is made of some unique nylon hybrid.<br /><br />It's a bifold wallet with an ID card holder. It also has two spots for cash in case you need to separate bills or receipts. I love the way it fits in my pocket, and also how it has no gaudy logos. It does have an &#34;A&#34; logo on the outside but it's barely noticeable<br /><br />Overall, I've been very very satisfied with my purchase especially considering the price I paid (initially I was looking at the $80 bellroy wallets). Only thing I hope is that it lasts another 23 years like my old wallet!"

5.0,"I loved it and for the  price you can't beat it, the color was accurate which i wasn't expecting so that was a plus!"
5.0,"I love these leggings! So soft and buttery, plus the print is bright and vibrant. I am 5'6&#34;, 155 pounds, size 10 pants. I ordered the large and probably should have ordered medium...the large is a bit loose at the ankles, but otherwise still fits well!"
5.0,"Very thin but I planned on wearing a tank top under it anyway. hangs good, slinky like. covers my chubby tummy. very flattering."

5.0,Love love love this dress! It does stretch so be prepared and don’t go a size bigger.
5.0,"Fit and quality are spectacular.  If someone twisted my arm to make a complaint, it would be that the back pocket has limited usefulness - but then, I can understand why it's the size it is (just big enough to fit an ID and key)."

5.0,Such an awesome scrub cap!!! It fits perfect and the color matches my scrubs perfectly. I would absolutely buy another one from this company!!
5.0,"I've been wearing merino wool socks for a while now and have actually done a decent amount of research into them. Originally, I was only buying Smartwool brand, but after they started using a merino blend (versus 100% merino wool), the performance went way down, so I started looking for alternatives. I came across Darn Tough and have been so happy with every pair I've bought. They're also an American company and offer a lifetime guarantee, which is huge! If your socks ever get a hole or anything else ever goes wrong with them, you can exchange them for a new pair. Long story short, I tossed all of my cotton socks and bought 4 pairs of these (because you can wear each pair for a few days before they start to smell). They're also great for traveling because you can get by for more than a week with just three pairs, which take up significantly less space in luggage than 9 would. I have purchased two pairs for my son and recommend them highly to everyone I know."
5.0,A little large and hard to grip things at times.
5.0,"I love these!! The fit well, they stay put, they are sturdy and comfy on my feet!!"

5.0,My fave pj with dogs
5.0,Second time ordering one of these dresses. I love them!!
5.0,"I am surprised for buying underwear online how much I like these. They are 95% cotton and 5% spandex. The back is full coverage and they come up to about 2 inches below my belly button. They are comfortable and stay put throughout the day. They are TTS based on their sizing chart. Since they are full coverage, I feel like you'd be able to see lines under leggings but for under jeans these are great basic underwear."
5.0,Nice pullover. Great color. Grandson will love it.
5.0,Can spot your bags with these tags. Very large in size. Room to write all pertinent information.
5.0,they were a gift for someone who does a lot of computer work. They liked them no problems
5.0,"Got this dress for a valentines banquet! I was a bit nervous about buying it, but it was cute and worked for the occasion. Fit a bit large at the waist but I think if I would’ve sized down it would’ve been too tight at my hips. I’m 5’5” and 125lbs"

5.0,Twelve year old granddaughter loves them!
5.0,"I loved this dress that I got to wear as a wedding guest. I'm 5'9 185 with 36B bra size and got a size 10 and it fit well. It made my boobs look perky and full. This dress does lace up in the back so you do have to have help getting into it bc you have to pull the strings/ribbon out of some of the loops to slip it over your head, then have someone else restring it through the loops."
5.0,"I grabbed this for my swim-team daughter (dresses make for quicker locker room after trainings). She just loves it! Soft, flowy and loose fit, great color and design. Certainly recommend it, and might even need to get it in another color for my water bug!"

5.0,"Packaging was as expected, Looks Perfect and White! Toe is a tad bit tight, but otherwise, a great shoe! Exactly what I wanted :)"
5.0,"I ordered the bad because I wanted something for everyday and something that looks professional. This bad is amazing!!! It's big enough for me to put in my mini make-up bag, phone, wallet, charger, and other things. I love that there is a pocket on the back side for me to place my car keys. The bag did have a funky smell when I received it, but after a week or so the smell went away. I also put some fabric softeners in the bag to get rid of the smell. The bag looks exactly as it's being advertised. I have been using this bag for 2 weeks now, and it seems very sturdy."
5.0,This watch is slimline and stylish. Great quality. Awesome price.
5.0,"didn't look like much in the packaging but when I took it out and tried it on, it's very nice.  I wear it all of the time."

5.0,"Serves the purpose on the golf course and I received many compliments for the look.  That has never happened before.  Great hat, great look!"
5.0,The item was as advertised - a very lovely Ginger Snap snap.  I was particularly impressed by the communication and service provided by the Vendor. The item was shipped very quickly - even earlier than promised.  I would be very comfortable dealing with this Vendor again in the future.

5.0,"Lavender love is the perfect gift!<br />Relaxing, beautifully soft, a true love gift for Valentine's Day for any woman who needs to relax❤️"
5.0,"The fit is great.  I don't like the pads that came with them will likely be taking all of those out.  For the price and the actual comfort and reasonable support, I would recommend you buy these.  It is worth it and you get 5 great colors."
5.0,True to size. Husband likes them.
5.0,"very cute top! can wear with anything! shorts, skirt, pants, jeans"

This one fits perfectly and the stones are really pretty.  I have been wearing it for about 6 months now and both stones are still looking good!"

5.0,I bought this to use on my newborn in the hospital.  Fits well and looks cute.
5.0,I bought these when there was a sale on them to try them out. I wasn't expecting too much but I really like them. They are on the thinner side which is great for summer and they are pretty soft too. The thing about these that I wasn't sure about (and didn't see any comments on) was the back seam - which is a single seam in the middle verses 2 up the back of your legs.
5.0,"My friend love it, she can pull, carry or use as a backpack. Matter of matter she will be using it for a weekend flight she is taking."
5.0,excellent quality vivid colors very nice

5.0,"I bought this pendant as a cupid's arrow reference for my daughter to wear as a good luck charm in the hopes of finding true love.  It's a Christmas present so I haven't given it to her yet but I know she'll love it as a piece of jewelry if nothing else.  The design and workmanship make it look like a piece of fine jewelry in white gold and diamonds.  It's a perfect size, not too small, not too big. You can't beat the price and it even comes with a nice chain.  This is a good value. I'm very happy with my purchase."
5.0,I got a ton of compliments when I wore it; love it. The sleeves are extra long but look good with a thick roll.
5.0,"Nice quality, at a great price."
5.0,It was bought for my daughter and it’s wonderful!
5.0,Love them for holiday gifts
5.0,"These gloves are warm and look great. They are thick and cushiony, which keeps my hands warm on the steering wheel."
5.0,"These earrings are lightweight, added just the right amount of festivity to my outfit on Christmas Day and best of all, it didn’t irritate my sensitive ears."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:c8317feb8c4e186579e7b31975feb920]] I just bought this pair of earrings of EleQueen and it came timely in a nice box and well packaged and exactly as described.<br /><br />I like it as it features 925 sterling silver and rhodium. It has smooth and high polished finished rhodium plated earrings. It's very lightweight and small.<br /><br />I like the blue sapphire stone as it looks so real, it also has small white crystals that enhances the blue sapphire, it dazzles and shines incredibly! It has prongs setting, secure and placed well. The blue sapphire has excellent cut! This is a good earrings for girls.<br /><br />This would have been perfect if it's bigger in size for women! Overall, it's a good set of earrings and ideal for evening dress. So far, I did not experience itchiness on my ears as I have very sensitive ears. I have worn this set a few times.<br /><br />I like that it came with a nice hard box, a polishing cloth and a small pink pouch for storage.<br /><br />I was blessed to receive this product at a discounted price during its promotional period in exchange for an honest/unbiased opinion. This is my personal experience and I wasn’t obliged to give positive reviews. I will update my review if I encounter some problems with the product.<br />Thank you!"
5.0,"a fun skirt to wear. color was right on, too."
5.0,"Well made, easy wash and wear."
5.0,Great service and nice quality.
5.0,Have tired them yet.
5.0,I would buys again
5.0,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE AND IT FIT AWESOME AND LOOKS GREAT SHE LOVED IT
5.0,the person I bought it for say &#34;It’s nice and it makes me feel pretty with the flower.&#34;
5.0,Beautiful. Like it very much
5.0,They were absolutely beautiful!  She loved them and so did her Mom!  They were even nicer in person!!!  WOW!
5.0,Nice light weight material with good stretch and so far pretty durable by consideration of material. Very breathable and comfortable too. Only downside i came across is that the skull prints (more so the white skull on black) are larger than expected so it kinda looks goofy as the skull wraps all the way around your head rather then centered on you face.
5.0,"I use these bandanas as sweat bands when working in hot spaces and weather. I can carry one in my pocket and have it on hand when the need arises. You never know what will pop up and cause profuse sweating trying to get a job done. I wear eyeglasses and sweat profusely when hot which can burn my eyes and obscure my vision trying to fix something in an awkward position. This bandana has adequate size to roll and build a solid, well-fitted sweatband. You can also use as a dew rag if painting or working is heavy dust etc. These are great bandanas if you like something with adequate size and substance."
5.0,Issues are the perfect size and fit as expected .  Kids love them
5.0,Got it for a Christmas present for my grandson
5.0,"This is a great skirt.  It was a little long for me (5'5&#34;), I will definitely have to wear it with some heels.  So it would be a great skirt if you were tall.<br />Love how it fits and looks and feels."
5.0,I should've ordered a smaller size in order to do it justice. I wanted it to fit like the guys on the advertisement picture but....no. I have 20 inch arms and a barrel chest so I thought getting an XL would givee the fit I was looking for. It didnt. The shirt is AWESOME though. I got it on a Saturday and I take Saturday and Sunday off from the gym so I couldn't wait for Monday to wear it to the gym.
5.0,I bought this for my granddaughter who does cosplay and see is in love with this. It is made out of wonderful material and fits great. It's well worth the money.
5.0,Work ad advertised.
5.0,"It great, easy where for any soldier or former military persons used to wearing dog tags for casual wear."
5.0,Cute shoes and high quality. Love it.
5.0,Perfect! Our adult daughter put them on right away!
5.0,"Lightweight, simple design. Perfect for any occasion"
5.0,"great set, bout a 10 and fits like a ten should. Shorts r a little light weight and thin, but I like that for a hot summer they are perfect."
5.0,A durable leather winter work glove at an affordable price.
5.0,Can’t complain about it for the price is good
5.0,"Great belt and love the fact that not only is it &#34;infinitely&#34; adjustable, but, if you lose weight, you can trim the belt and reattach buckle. The belt has simple, clean lines and is good with jeans or dress slacks. The only thing negative I can say about it is that the metal buckle is pretty heavy, 1.3 oz to be accurate (yeah, I actually weighed it...ha!)--I got the “Black40” version.<br /><br />Belt seems well constructed--the buckle being solid and the ratcheting mechanism firmly engages. The belt sides are double-stitched as well, so I have to imagine this belt well last, as long as the plastic ratchet points on underside of belt holdup well.<br /><br />Measurements (I bought the 36&#34; - 42&#34; size):<br /><br />Total Length, with Buckle: 4' 3&#34; (51&#34;)<br />Length sans Buckle: 4' (48&#34;)<br />Belt Width: 1 3/8&#34;<br />Belt Circumference: Max 46&#34;; Min 38 7/8&#34;<br /><br />Note: the circumference measurements were taken with full, untrimmed belt length and from the widest to the narrowest adjustments and from inside the belt. There are 32 &#34;ratchet&#34; adjustments, so the increments are quite small (.223&#34;), allowing for excellent fitment.<br /><br />The belt is labeled 50”. I have to guess that this pertains to total belt length. Also, it’s odd that the given size, the size I bought, 36” – 42” doesn’t match up at all with the actual fitment range of belt. So be forewarned. Hardly matters, though, since belt can be trimmed to fit. But I would have given this a 4.5 stars if I could have."
5.0,"Great product and even better customer service. I ordered a pair and shortly after receiving and wearing them one alligator clip stopped locking properly (I work in law enforcement). The company emailed me before I even had a chance to make contact, inquiring on how I liked their product so I explained the situation. At my surprise and no cost to me they sent me a free heavy duty pair to replace the pair I had just purchased. Unfortunately I lost them in my recent move and to my luck, couldn't find this brand and had to order another brand (which I am not satisfied with). I recommend these to all of my Law enforcement family!"
5.0,Cute belly button ring
5.0,I love this band! It fits great and the band itself is thinner then the original Fitbit band which makes it more comfortable! I wear mine every and workout almost everyday and the color is still vibrant. I have the tie-dye color. I get many compliments on it. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,Very nice. Closure is a little tricky till you get used to it. Have worn often and get lots of compliments.
5.0,"Have been consistently buying these pants from XS now arriving at Youth Large.  Fit great, release grass and dirt stains easily.  Never ruined or torn.  Top notch.  Large are just a bit too big right now.  2-3 months and they will be perfect."
5.0,Like the real thing minus the price!
5.0,Perfect size. So cute. I love my 2 minpins and i just had to have these. Sterling silver and stainless steel are the only metals i can wear.
5.0,Shirt doesn’t hang as low under the arms as the picture shows and I am fine with that.
5.0,I paired this with a simple black top for a day trip - it was a great combination to look nice but still be very comfortable. It does run a bit on the big side (I don't mind that but some might).
5.0,Great product for young ones and fit well
5.0,Perfect fit and warm
5.0,Love the color combo and print. The top and bottom are not a heavy material which makes this outfit nice for the upcoming spring weather
5.0,My daughter loves her set of two pandora lock set

5.0,my daughter loved this and it arrived within the timeframe specified.
5.0,My daughters and I have been fighting over all these pairs of earrings! They are all so pretty. I can seriously wear a different pair everyday. You can find one to match anything you have with this set. There are so many different options to choose from.
5.0,I love this coin purse it is super roomy! I can actually sift through my change and find what I need quickly because it opens up so wide that I can see everything inside of it. I am going to order a few more.
5.0,Very nice quality.  I really like it.
5.0,They are perfect!  Small and flat so they don’t stick out. I love them!!!! Would make a cute gift for a cat lover for yourself or someone else!
5.0,"First off great quality, simple, yet beautiful. I got this for my wedding dress which was going to be a court house wedding. Thing changed and we did it outside in November. Added leggings and a shawl and it was perfect.<br /><br />My measurements are 39-30-40 I got a medium and it fit perfectly. Just make sure the zipper on the side it all the way unzipped before trying to put it on. (I didn't realize it had one and about died when I thought it didn't fit...)"
5.0,"I love that these come with a bag to carry them in, but I feel like I need to be careful not to burst the zippered bag at the seam.  But the shopping bags themselves are great, wash well, and fold up easily.  Love them!"
5.0,"Haven’t worn, just received it but the fabric is so soft, light, and flattering.  And I love the style so much, it looks very cute!"
5.0,"These masks keep their shape well over time, and they can be folded up to fit in a pocket.  They also can be worn without fogging up glasses"
5.0,What an awesome compression sock. The sock is easy to put on and take off. It’s soothing on my feet and legs; especially due to me being on my feet throughout the day.<br />What a great comfortable compression sock.
5.0,"Purchased for the beach, nice top for the money."
5.0,"Cardigan is true to size, i went off reviews and was sent completely off. Order your regular size.. Im 190 5'4 a usually a Xl and i ordered a 2x and its a bit big and long on me.. Just go off ur usual size.. But good material.."
5.0,I didn't really look at the measurements very well so these were larger than I expected but that was a good surprise. I turned them into clip-ons and they looked great with some of the other green-stone jewelry I bought on amazon at the same time. Especially excellent if you have Slytherin pride.
5.0,Great hat!! Warm and good looking!
5.0,I ordered these glasses for my wife and the moment she put them on she was amazed as to how they worked. They automatically adjusted to her eye sight. Amazing product. Highly recommend!
5.0,LOVE this for my 2 year old. She wears it if it’s rainy or windy and it keeps my daughter dry.
5.0,My teenager thinks they are cute and they don't hurt her wars.

5.0,Super cute and flattering. wear a medium and that's what I ordered. Fit perfectly.
5.0,Thank you very much love the hat
5.0,"Really great! Super cutex, sturdy, while also being comfortably thin. I always wear huge headphones and all the other sun glasses would hurt. These are thin enough"

5.0,Flip flops met my needs
5.0,Nice quality for a very good price.
5.0,My husband wears suits multiple times per week and is always losing the little plastic collar  things. These seemed very special since they are metal and have the inscriptions. I gave them to him as a gift and he loves them! He actually keeps up with them. Knowing they have little love notes inscribed in them makes them that much more special. They have a great presentation as well.
5.0,made very  well was surprised happy with it
5.0,"Its a lovely purse but takes a little getting used to, set up wise. Im used to different type purses. Its i love lucy though so no complaints"

5.0,I looked the size and quality of the shirt!
5.0,I LOVE THIS SPORTS BRA!  it fits perfectly. The straps stay in place perfectly and it holds me exactly as I need it to. The quality is amazing and as I said... the support is perfect. I want this in every color.
5.0,These are awesome to wear for sun protection and cooling. I wear them while riding my motorcycle in the summer heat. I soak them in ice cold water prior to putting them on; they feel soooo good!
5.0,I love it  it fits perfectly and is so light and soft.  Comfortable and goodlooking
5.0,"Its got guts, which are silky and shiny on the inside. As you might know about We Love Fine merch, this is a top quality made item; the stitching is not sub par and the fabric is soft and durable. The ears & horns are soft and do not sag down or lean to the back; They balance perfectly on your head. You will have a lot of fun unzipping the rubber light saber tab to reveal the intestines to all your friends. This is a Women's fit hoodie & the zipper is on the traditional women's side of the jacket. The XL will fit a Mens Medium/ & a man who might be comfy wearing a slim fit Large."
5.0,Stretchy material extremely comfortable.  These are very well made and fit great.
5.0,Strong and have not failed yet and my son is hard on the watch that these are fitted to
5.0,"I love these pieces, everything fit perfectly and the tail band was big enough for me to take off and put back on without any problems."
5.0,slim and warm
5.0,"Great bracelet!  Wished it would have shipped flat, though, for shaping."
5.0,Great versatile sweater. Looks fantastic.
5.0,"Hi!  I received my sunglasses today.  They are awesome.  Very unique design.  So well made and sturdy, yet so light.  This is my third pair of Nectar glasses.  I got My first pair in a surf shop on Amelia Island. I still have them!!!  I have had several people ask to buy them right off my face!  Soon after i got some black aviators and I love them too.<br /><br />Another bonus was a handwritten note from David M.  Your picture of sun is so artistic ;).<br /><br />I definitely will keep shopping with you here and on your website.<br /><br />#Stay Stoked"
5.0,affordable jersey and very durable.  My son loves it!
5.0,True to size! Nice shirt for any mustang enthusiast!
5.0,Got this for my daughter she was very happy with it.
5.0,They fit good. Husband and brother-in-law love them.
5.0,"Ordered a large and fits perfectly - not too tight, just right. Material is surpassingly soft and not thin/see through. Bought a second pair."
5.0,Perfect size and love the color
5.0,"I loved the way it fit, perfect"
5.0,"I got this as part of my daughter’s Valentine’s Day gift and she LOVED it. I washed it right when I received it because I knew she’d want to put it on right away (cold, delicate cycle and hung dry - washed well). I was right, she put it on immediately after opening it and wore it all day for two days straight! It’s so soft and great to put on after her bath so she doesn’t get cold while getting lotion and clothes on. She’s in mainly 4t, sometimes 5t (for height), so I went with 4-5t and there’s room for her to grow. It’s the perfect gift for someone who loves rainbows and unicorns."
5.0,Excellent quality. Round riveted 9mm rings. There were no flaws or defects. The chain came lightly oiled and with no tarnish.<br /><br />The sizing is almost a custom fit. I suggest measuring with whatever you consider to wear under it for the best fit.<br /><br />Ordered on Tuesday. Arrived Thursday. You cant do better than that.
5.0,"It is wide and thin so it doesn't feel like there's something always wedged between my fingers. It is virtually indestructible and fairly low key, not too flashy. Gold is pretty and platinum is ...well ...gray, but tungsten is (in my humble opinion) the perfect ring for a man's man. The thousand dollars I saved by buying it online? Spent on our awesome honeymoon!"
5.0,"Liked:  Definitely price, quality, size, detail.<br />Used Product for:  Added as embellishment to my phone.<br />♡A Mama..."
5.0,great gift for a friend.
5.0,"Bought this as my carry-on for a trip to the Dominican Republic. Couldn't be happier with how well it held up, and how much space there was. It is mainly just a one compartment bag, with a couple of pockets, but it was exactly what I needed. Survived carry-on travel, a week of my daily carry while in the DR, and then even family vacation a week later. Could not recommend this more!"
5.0,"Perfect for mom.  Many compartments to organize IDs, cards and such.  Match perfectly with my diaper & duffle bags."
5.0,Sizing is accurate 👌🏻 love the look and feel.  Actually matches description 😊<br />Would buy again in different colors.
5.0,"There are very comfy, fits well, flattens tummy and does not roll down like some do. They are not see through. My favorite part is the pockets! Great for the price, too."
5.0,Unbeatable at this price. Looks much nicer than $22.
5.0,Goes with everything. Great everyday ring! Love it!
5.0,"I have ordered these in all colors! I’m 5’1 and 108 pounds. These bunch a little around the ankles but not excessively so. Soft, durable and to me, they are form fitting without being overkill."
5.0,"Very beautiful, Good quality, Doesn’t change in color"
5.0,"When I saw these glasses online I immediately liked them. They are so unique.  I'm little (4'-10&#34;) and they are kind of big on my face but then, anyone who would wear such glasses obviously doesn't mind being a bit over the top... and that would be me!  They feel sturdy and well made but one has to handle them carefully.  The are beautiful and sooooo unique.  I haven't worn them yet because I need the right outfit and event for them. These are so ornate that I would not wear them as my &#34;everyday&#34; sunglasses... special occasions for these.  They come in a nice soft pouch too. I'm very pleased!"
5.0,I put this on my Omega and it worked awesome
5.0,Love my JoStar dress.  Super comfortable!
5.0,A mi papá le encantó tiene muy buena calidad y es hermoso

5.0,Love the size and color of the glasses. Great classic look for a great price
5.0,Solid socks
5.0,Great quality. Gets a lot of nods!
5.0,"Kind of difficult to walk in due to the extremely soft texture, but they dry quickly and are very mooooooshiiieee!!!"
5.0,"Heathered purple fabric is soft, comfortable, and doesn't wrinkle. Perfect gym shirt. Print seems to withstand basic wash & dry without wear (so far)."
5.0,"Fabulously cute dress. Ordered a Medium, 5'3 150 Pounds. Fits just at/below knee. Looks great with heels. Good quality."
5.0,"I bought it Medium thinking that it could be too small for me, but I changed it to Small and it fit really well.  The very good quality fabric is not transparent, I bought several of different colors.  i love it"
5.0,"Adorable, great quality!"
5.0,"i have two pairs of these now and i will definitely be getting more as well! i do have to say i hate how long they have taken to get delivered but id say they're worth it. i have the black pairs, which still have the little dots but they aren't as noticeable as the colored ones. but they definitely stay up, i feel like i'm hardly pulling them up."
5.0,"Awesome hat, fits well, and goes great with the Newt Scamander scarf"
5.0,Arrived sooner. The dress is exactly what I expected.  Fits perfect on me. You can’t ask more for the prices and looks beautiful
5.0,Fit great! My son loves them!
5.0,"Just had my first trip with the bag, it's an awesome bag for short business trips. Big enough to pack 2-3 days worth of clothes, yet small enough to go on any flight, even those old small planes with tiny overhead compartment. Pretty happy with the purchase so far."
5.0,"Wore it for a cosplay, it looked awesome"
5.0,"I was hesitant as they didn't seem to have soft lining she (the wife) usually likes.  However, she says ""they do, kinda"" (have the soft lining) and she really likes them, and gave them 5 stars."
5.0,"These are medium to large size, wheat chain earrings, very simple and elegant, sturdy and strong. Exceeded my expectations."
5.0,We’ll made & comfy fit.
5.0,Very comfortable. Gets the message across.
5.0,"Super adorable!! They look really nice and were packaged really well. I haven’t worn them out yet, but I don’t think there will be any problem. I recommend!"
5.0,"The watch works well!  I haven’t had to charge it since receiving it about a month ago, and haven’t had any issues.  Construction seems very solid, too.  Overall, it’s comfortable to wear and nice that I don’t have to worry about a battery running out.  The app is pretty simple at this point, but hopefully that’s something that can be improved with time."
5.0,"I ordered these in size 6.  I normally wear a 5.5 on one hand & a 6 on the other, so I'd say they are true to size.  I don't wear my actual wedding ring every day because, as a vet tech, it's just not practical to wear a fancy diamond ring.  Washing hands & wearing exam gloves all the time is not great for my ring.  So, I normally wear a plain band but every once in a while, it's nice to wear something pretty.  I like to get inexpensive costume jewelry to wear in place of my real wedding ring & this set is perfect for that.  These rings are attractive & I can stack them or wear each one by itself.  They give me lots of choices & if I lose it or damage one, it's not the end of the world."
5.0,Yes its the best
5.0,"This is just the tan leather belt I wanted, and the cost made it even more likeable!"
5.0,This dress is banging! I can wear it to work or out on the town and it's comfortable and brings compliments everywhere I go. The size was right on and it's quality material. I love it!
5.0,"I don't usually have a huge problem with headlights at night and these do help a little, so they are nice for long drives at night. As for driving in the day, they are pretty much useless and not really worth wearing at all"
5.0,The umbrella was beautiful and my niece loved it. The colors and design was just like the picture. Only thing I wish it had was a button to open it instead of manually opening it.
5.0,"Gift for my father... I little bigger diameter than I thought he would like, but wanted the thin profile. He's getting used to the size. It looks pretty sharp."
5.0,Fun alarm clock.
5.0,Bought these for my daughter for her birthday!! She absolutely loves them. Details are great. They actually look so good.
5.0,"My son absolutely loved this on Halloween! The gloves were a little tricky after taking them off and then trying to put them back on but other than that, he had fun with it and looked super cool in the dark."
5.0,"Absolutely love this dress! It was perfect for the occasion and comfortable! Fit was great! I am so happy with this purchase, and price was great as well!!"
5.0,I used them every day without ears irritation
5.0,"I ordered two pairs of these shorts but requested one size up for comfort.  They feel wonderful, yet still gently hug your hips and legs.  They are ideal in hot weather and maintain their shape after exercising.  I would not hesitate to buy additional products.  Washed in cold water and they still maintained their shape and comfort."
5.0,"Not as thick as my true Mexican blanket but nice, soft."
5.0,Just like advertised. Fast shipping
5.0,The pants fit perfect. Will definitely buy again.
5.0,Just like my boonie from SEA.  Its ripstop and dries fast.  It shapes/forms easy and is very well made.  They did this one right.
5.0,Beautiful gloves and very warm on those cold days
5.0,This was a good value for the money. I had a hard time finding bands for my 45mm galaxy watch 3 that were not masculine or just not durable. This set gave me a variety of colors that are very sturdy and fit my wrist well.
5.0,It was perfect for my golden rose Michael Kors sophie watch. I had a little trouble adjusting the length at the beginning but after that it was easy and it fits perfectly. I will probably buy the silver one too.
5.0,"Looked great, sewing on pockets a little unlined."
5.0,"Very nice quality, slow, slow shipping! True to color & size too. Seems to be well made & durable. I really like it. Got lots of compliments."
5.0,"As a Cosplayer, I’m very picky about my costumes and I was extremely surprised on the high quality this one was. It fits perfectly and I can’t wait to debut it at the next comic convention. - Capuchino Cosplay"
5.0,The band is white to me. Not even a silver white. Just plain white. It's cool though. Fits really well
5.0,Strong and well made and yes bold. Took picture to show on hat. Stands out perfectly.
5.0,"The hoodie fits perfectly. A little long on the sleeves (in a good way). A very settled plain hoodie that can be layered or worn on its own. The Khaki color is light, almost kind of creamish. The material is strong. Overall. A good buy in my opinion."
5.0,they are worth the money
5.0,Simple.. thin summer dress.  Very comfortable.
5.0,"I bought this for my son - 17 - and he loves it!  The magnetic clasp works well, it's smart-looking - nice buy."
5.0,Cant believe how well this worked out for the price. Probably my favorite bathing suit now. Very happy.
5.0,This is super cute and makes it easy for my daughter to tell time!
5.0,"These pajamas are well made, with great piping details on the cuffs. They are ward and soft. They do shed, so I would suggest washing before wearing as that did help."
5.0,"this jacket went beyond my expectations. Perfect fit, lovely fabric.....the perfect double breasted blazer. Long enough but not overwhelming.<br />I highly recommend both colors!!! The beige is very neutral, not too gold for my light skin. There is a slight herringbone pattern. Buttons are sewn on perfectly and it is machine wash!<br />It hangs beautifully too. Looks great on, so many possibilities."
5.0,Love these sandals! Amazing quality and fits as expected.
5.0,My sister loved it! It was beautiful and came in a nice long bracket box - perfect to just add a bow on it!
5.0,Loved it! My recent  nursing graduate just loved the pin! It was beautiful! And we'll made!
5.0,I really like these shirts.  The fit is comfortable and they keep you cool
5.0,"I ordered 3 different pairs of socks and these had the best snug fit so they would not slip off your heels when wearing sneakers.  Whether you run, do Zumba or hip hop, these socks were great!"
5.0,"More than cute, so many uses...Love"
5.0,Love Them❤️
5.0,Very nice. Soft.
5.0,I bought two of these hats for my two grandsons. They are cute and keep the boys heads and ears warm. They are knit with fur lining the entire inside including the ear flaps. Overall good deal for the price.
5.0,Well made. Good fit. Timely delivery.
5.0,I have multiple colors and i love it! 180 lbs 5’9” athletic build and size large
5.0,"Very happy with the product. Although a tiny bit bigger than I like, the quality is great. Color is very pretty and vibrant. Has not faded after 6 washes. Have received many compliments."
5.0,I used these socks on a recent long car trip to Utah. I wanted something to make my travels more comfortable and they worked great.
5.0,Just what i expected. Decent.

5.0,I love this cloth!  And it's big enough to get the job done!
5.0,"I'm a Beatles freak, I had to get this -- so I did. This awesome hobo bag as only $15. It was *so* worth it!! This bag holds my ipod, phone, perfume, lotion, hand sanitizer, 3 of my books and a spiderman ball (A bit childish, but I love Spiderman). This bag is the best out of small purses that can't hold anything for $30, and this is half the price. I fully recommend this, it came fast, and it was the best bag I've had. Buy this."
5.0,"Great fit, soft material. Highly recommend."
5.0,"The shoulder does not go as far down as the picture shows, but everything else is great, Its not to thin its not to thick, Its almost like a waffle thermal type material. I got compliments on it the first day I wore it. I love it might by another, its not super short either."
5.0,"I got these at $85 from Amazon, they are great! The build quality is good, as expected with Ray Bans and they look awesome."
5.0,Bought it for a new driver who promptly put it on her visor.  It's a constant reminder that someone cares for and to be extra careful.
5.0,they fit & feel nice.
5.0,a beautiful piece that really holds small scarves well
5.0,It' SO warm and soft.
5.0,"I bought IT for my wife, the fabric os very good, confortable and looks very stylish"
5.0,"These socks fit as expected, no surprises here. They strike a good balance in terms of thickness- not too thin or too thick. Thick enough to feel comfortable and plush, but thin enough for use during athletics, when things get sweaty. Indeed, you can see it in their design that some regard is given to ventilation with the top areas of the socks being slightly thinner. As for looks, they look good and sit at a favorable height below the ankle, matching most running shoes."
5.0,Got for my daughters birthday. The kids loved them
5.0,Perfect for my Letterkenny costume!
5.0,"Band is pretty light, fits just about right. My hand does not feel heavy at all like when am wearing my other rubbber band and for the first time I can actually wear my vivo active 4 watch without taking it off at nights—-that’s how comfortable the band is. The only minor issue I had which is probably a manufacture problem is that one of the pin for the one of the band (only one end of the band not both ends) does not stay as the hole was not sealed off enough so the pin dropped out a few times while I was trying to put the band on….. but it’s a good buy and I recommend this to anyone"
5.0,"Nice, soft feel and made with quality."
5.0,"It is great experience when weared on this glasses. Actually, items which have been manufacted in China, are really excellent!"
5.0,These leggings are smooth and silky on the outside and fleecy on the inside.  They seem plenty stretchy and should be perfect to wear this winter.
5.0,I use this bag frequently because you can expand it or make it smaller and having wheels is easier for me to handle.
5.0,"This actually attaches by pulling apart the rubbery plastic &#34;ring&#34; and clipping it to your septum. It's a little weird and uncomfortable at first, but I was able to wear it comfortably throughout the night without any problems. You can kind of fluff out the individual whiskers to give them a more realistic look. I actually plan to order another set or two so I have them on hand &#34;just in case&#34;. LOVE them!<br />Peace, Love, Purr!!!"
5.0,"These socks are so cute, and they arrived very quickly.."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:495137f5bcdea978a47867b4e4733915]] The material was so soft and the color was on point. Well worth the money and came in two days right before my trip
5.0,Purchased for my 5 year old grandson and my 12 year old granddaughter. They both love them. Easy to wash and wears well.
5.0,"Cute, comfy and good quality!"
5.0,"I get so many complements. When I wear people always comment that orange is my color. Super comfy, demure, cute summer dress."
5.0,Very comfortable and true to size. Love the coloring.
5.0,Perfect! I love the quality and fit.
5.0,Little small but I'm returning and just getting a larger size. I love the suit. Very slimming
5.0,Gave to my boss as a parting gift and his daughter loved it so much he had to give it to her 😂
5.0,I was not sure about this dress honestly but I'm am so happy I gave it a chance. This dress fits perfect and i had so many people staring at me. My confidence was definitely boosted when I wore it. My only complaint was I was constantly pulling the dress down it wanted to show the world my goodies.
5.0,These are Women’s Sports Socks that have moisture wicking to help keep your feet dry.  They are soft and cushy and give you a good base to start your day.  You need to take care of your feet and keep them dry. You start with the right socks.
5.0,"I really like this dress. I ordered one in chocolate, but it never arrived and I had to get a refund. At least this one came. The material is much better than many items I order from Amazon."
5.0,"Comfortable, light, perfect for hiking in the late summer-earlly fall weather. They dry out very fast too."
5.0,works great! Very stretchy and comfortable
5.0,It is absolutely gorgeous in person.
5.0,"I'm so glad I got this CBR ring, it's my favorite one and not to mention it adds a bit of sparkle to you, love it!!!!!"
5.0,Great product! Pretty durable.<br />They don't get very dark but still helpful if your eyes are sensitive to the sun.
5.0,Walking in wet weather...
5.0,"Love this dress. It's very well made, looks adorable on. Throw it with a sweater a belt and some leggings and get a while fall look. Only thing to remember order 1 size larger, it runs small."
5.0,"It is handy to have five strings that can be used by the whole family, and I use them to hold glasses and prevent them from falling while exercising. Used by my family to hold reading glasses, no more looking around for forgotten glasses. Fixed keys are also a good option. It is worth noting that when fixing the glasses, try to fix the rope as close to the lens as possible. If it is fixed at the end of the glasses like in the product photo, the ears will be very uncomfortable when wearing it."
5.0,Look great and came with tools to adjust size.
5.0,"Excellent bag, exactly what I wanted"
5.0,"I the love Skirt Sports company and their products.  I have worn their skirts for over two years, and I have never had any issues with any of the skirts I have purchased. On this skirt there are built in shorties underneath with grippers, so the shorties do not ride up or cause chafing.  There are three pockets to carry your stuff, the two on the shorties are big enough for almost any phone, I have a Galaxy 7, and it fits perfectly and doesn't bounce around.  I am 5' 0&#34; tall, weigh 115lbs, and the small fits me perfectly, with the continuous draw string, it fits a wide range.  I love this skirt because it is so cute and fun to wear."
5.0,Comfortable clothing for shoulder surgery. Washes well. Large size perfect with sling apparatus.
5.0,I used this as a day bag on my recent trip to Bangkok. Very functional and love all the compartments for storage. Inside compartment to store important items like passport/cash in case anything falls out as you open the bag. The inside compartment and the phone storage were most important to me. Loved having my phone readily available and not have to dig in the bag. I would definitely recommend this product.
5.0,"Great kit for the price.  Sizing is spot on.  Im about 6' and 170 ish and the large fits perfectly.  This is more a race fit so expect it to be on the tighter side, but if its sized correctly, its literally a perfect fit.  Keep in mind, arms are a bit tight but I like them that way and that's how these jerseys are cut.  Very nice.  This was my first kit of MYNEKO brand and I am a BIG fan of MYNEKO stuff now.  Really cant beat it for the $.  And what's great is that they offer kits for under $40!  So after I got this one and tried it on, I went right back and ordered another kit in a different pattern (the wolf one).  Of note, the pad in the bibs are above average.  I'm in the saddle for 2-4 hours regularly and these  are fine.  Not the kind that you'd expect to see in a Louis Ganreau, or Castelli bib, but pretty darn close and for a fraction of the price, you cant beat it.  As long as the patterns and styles fit my taste, I'll always look for MYNEKO brand first for future purchases."
5.0,Just what I was looking for . Great addition to my collection!
5.0,Hermoso y suave para las niñas lo recomiendo la talla quedó como lo esperaba
5.0,"Perfect support for D cup active sports, Taekwondo, jogging and the gym.  I could not be happier."
5.0,"I love this cuff, I have already received so many compliments"
5.0,So cute and such a great deal! :)
5.0,"It fit below the belt , it fit perfectly I bought a medium and it fits great"
5.0,They are soft and very comfortable. Love these boxers!
5.0,So delicate and pretty. Super light too
5.0,I bought this for my boyfriend and we both love it . It’s very well made and comfy .
5.0,"My husband can see reds and greens now! It makes such a difference when we hike, especially in the fall. Also, he can see that some shirts are brown and not dark green, purple instead of rust red, etc. He loves these glasses."
5.0,"I am 5’7”, 170, and I ordered an XL.  It’s a nice loose, flowy fit and drapes really nicely.  It is sheer and needs a cami or at least a dark bra for a younger woman.  It was super cheap shut doesn’t look cheap.  I think it’s a steal and can’t wait to wear it!"
5.0,"super cute, great value"
5.0,"This dress is beautiful, even more in person. I went by a review that said it fits small and it didn't for me. I ordered big and it was too big. I returned it with no problem and ordered another one a size smaller. Fast shipping and would order again."
5.0,I wear it myself and other people love it also.
5.0,Love this dress I order a x large and it fits me very well. I am 5ft with a lot of booty size 38B 36 waist.  Love  the way it looks on me. Going to get the other two colors
5.0,It’s actually kind of nice but it’s low quality which is fair for the price you’re paying!
5.0,"Love it! Fits perfectly. I'm 5'6, 160lbs and big busted, this provides good coverage. Highly recommend."
5.0,Ordered for longer haired people at work..work great. But if you have fine hair they will slip off easily
5.0,My niece loves these earings. Very good quality
5.0,Really really cute and easy to wear.
5.0,super warm and cozy. The top button doesn't always stay buttoned though. Overall a very warm purchase. Kept me cozy in 40 degree weather in NYC in January. I had to break out the ski jacket for temps any lower though. It's good for cool temps but not COLD and wind.
5.0,Great soccer cleats
5.0,"I'm 6'2, 175lbs, 38 DD bra, usually wear large in dresses, narrow waist, bigger booty. I ordered a large, it fits well. Maybe just a touch tight but not over stretched or see through by any means. Fabric is great, nice mix of spandex so it doesn't look like it will fade or get covered in my dog's hair. Light weight and sooooo long. It just grazes the top of my feet and the ground. Looks very elegant with my summer time wedges. I might try a XL with my next order, just to compare and have a looser & more relaxed option."
5.0,"My baby loves it!<br />Soft, light and comfortable. 5 stars.<br />I have had it for months so far and washed it several times, fabric hasn’t washed out nor destroyed (I also use the best fabric detergent for baby and adults (Amway) and delicate mode in the washer, so far still looks like new.<br /><br />Es un suetercito bellísimo! Mi bebe hasta aprendió una frase nueva porque trae bolsitas, y cada vez que lo ve ella dice “tiene bolsas” y se pone muy contenta.<br />La tela es delgada y suave; ideal como para una tarde fresca... no fría, porque la tela no es gruesa.<br />La tela es de buena calidad. Ya lo he lavado muchas veces (usando el mejor detergente para mantener la ropa en las mejores condiciones (Detergente de Amway) y en modo delicado en mi lavadora, y ya han pasado varios meses desde que lo compre y aún sigue como nuevo.<br />Si lo recomiendo."
5.0,"Great Thrasher classic tee. Both my son and daughter got one, they love it!"
5.0,"I love these shorts so much I bought 2 extra pair and recommended them to my grandmother. They are a bit tight at first but now that I've broken them in they're very comfortable and practical for working out, lounging or even running quick errands."
5.0,"Loved it! True to size, color. Did not shrink or fade and has been washed numerous times."
5.0,Cute necklace. .
5.0,I bought a pair of these unisex ear muffs for my girlfriend and I was so impressed by them I bought a pair for myself!
5.0,Wear it everyday for past couple weeks has held up well so far recommend this brand!
5.0,"- Good fit as expected size<br />- Soft material<br />only one thing is may be shorts are little bit long, it will be more comfortable at home :))"
5.0,Great!!!! I love it!!! Super quality for this price!!!
5.0,Ordered a size up after reading reviews and I love it!
5.0,"I love these sunglasses.  The fade is super cool, they're very comfortable, and I don't have to worry that they're going to get caught in my hair because they don't have the protruding nose pieces.  I really wish I could wear them again, but unfortunately, my husband loves them even more than I do so he wears them most of the time :)<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback."
5.0,"So well made. Light and beautiful to the touch and to look at, a wonderful buy."
5.0,loved it and gave to my daughter
5.0,This cap fits well and is soft and washes well.  I have purchased 3 of them now.
5.0,"Got my granddaughter this for Christmas and she loves it! She had to put it on as soon as she opened it and wore it for almost 3 days. She wouldn't let us take it off her. It fit great and she is 2, 3 ft 2 inches and 42 lbs it is so cute."
5.0,Love. Perfect for keeping your feet warm. I would buy them again.
5.0,Bought for Halloween but have used for multiple events. Consistently the life of the party. Won a couple costume contests. People love watching them dance. Literally have had professional buskers turn into traveling minstrels following us around chanting dance dinosaur dance.
5.0,I purchased four more for my family
5.0,"I don't believe in spending lots of money on sunglasses. For me they get scratched, dropped, sat on and lost, so why spend so much money on something so fleeting. Cheap sunglasses are just that, cheap and poorly made. But not these. I got these sunglasses on sale for $12.00, but they are made like $30 or $40 sunglasses. They arrive with impressive packaging, a bag and a cleaning cloth with a mini  screwdriver. I'm so impressed. I can't wait to buy more styles from this manufacturer."
5.0,Perfect fit for my 16 months old fitness day at daycare. She looked like Jane Fonda and won the contest for best outfit. Super cute. Not too tight and she kept it on for 5 hrs so it must be comfy.
5.0,"Bought this as a gift so cannot comment on how much the receiver liked it, but it seems to be well made and has a nice retro vibe, which was why I bought it.  Also bought the sci-fi astronaut as it reminded me of the movie 2001.  Both seem well made."
5.0,Buena calidad a mi esposo le encanto bella
5.0,These came out perfect...for those giving bad reviews...check your settings. 374° for 70secs. Awesome!!
5.0,"It ran a little large, but I really like the fabric.  Others I have ordered from other companies have picked and ""pilled"", but I don't think this fabric will do that."
5.0,I really love these hair ties as a better option than an elastic.  I also love the fact that my one year old can where them in her hair as well.  These hair ties hold her hair in a pony tail better than anything I have used to date.  Thank you!
5.0,Great deal for those who like standard no frills aviator glasses.
5.0,"I love treadbands! This is one of my favorites. All of them are truly non-slip & so comfortable to wear. The designs are also super cute, but I love this simple one! It’s really soft & holds up fine in the washing machine."
5.0,Loved my earrings. The perfect shade of yellow and plan to buy other colors. I do not like heavy earrings and these did not pull. So I give them a 5 star rating!
5.0,"Fits well I’m 6’2 220, gives me a sense of comfort when I’m cutting wood."
5.0,"Son is a Ju Jitsu student, he mentioned wanting a rash guard. Stumbled into this selection and it did not disappoint. The available designs are awesome, challenged to pick just one. The quality, fit & value were top notch. Ordered a Medium."
5.0,Got this to replace the one that I've had for about 20 years and it is as beautiful as hoped
5.0,Loved my HP shirt
5.0,I love how well they fit. They are perfect under my scrubs.
5.0,Stored alot of information on it with easy access.
5.0,"I can’t wear fake jewelry, it hurts my ears and turns green fast….BUT this is real stainless steel and I love them!!! I have few pairs in my ears (2weeks) and NO issues at all. Very happy and will be buying more! Got 10 holes in each ear lol. Oh and I don’t take them out to shower either and they still look awesome, easy to clean and dry off. And they don’t pull on my long hair lol. These would be great for kids cuz back don’t fall off."
5.0,Nothing more nothing less
5.0,Awesome! Kept warm!
5.0,This is a beautiful dress! I wore it at 4 months pregnant and it flattered my expanding waist without hugging my curves and lumps. It hides any flaws. It's about knee length on me I'm 5'3&#34;. Im about 155lbs right now & I ordered an XL and it was slighltly big but I wanted to get more than one wear out of it. I got many compliments on this dress and expect to wear it after the baby as well.
5.0,My granddaughter love the bracelet
5.0,I am on my second pair and pants fit well with my uniform top. I would recommend.
5.0,These are much nicer than the straps I used in my youth.  They are much more comfortable due to the design of lightweight material and easy to adjust so the tension is just right.  They are easy to attach to eyeglasses.  I had intended to use them just with activities but they are so comfortable I will be using them lots more.  Simple but very nice.
5.0,Great soft material
5.0,"Great item with good price, i got it with a great condition and on time as i expected, i will order again from the same brand."
5.0,"Very soft, perfect fit, nice length and good quality. Very happy with this purchase. I have a very large chest, 44 F and am 5'9 the shirt fits me perfectly"
5.0,"I’ve worn it once. And on my sweat!! I’m 5’8”. About 180lbs. Got a medium, prolly could have sized up one, but it’ll work out."
5.0,Beautiful item.  Heirloom quality !
5.0,This was a gift for someone and they said they fit perfectly and were high quality.
5.0,"I've purchased ponchos on Amazon before for festivals and camping, but they were the kind that are basically a trash bag with a hood, leaving your arms and legs to get soaked (unless you always keep them tucked in).  These are nice and long (down to the knee) and the sleeves actually allow you to do stuff without getting wet.  They're thin and lightweight but I haven't had one tear yet.  The girls in my group liked them because they're a little transparent so everyone could see what they're wearing underneath.  I've already used four and I still have one left for an emergency. Normally I don't buy anything that hasn't been reviewed, but at this price for 5 of them, I'd give it a shot.  I'll definitely be buying these again the next time I'm going to need some rain gear."
5.0,My daughter  loves it!
5.0,"These are the best swim goggles we've ever owned, and trust me, we've tried them all. Very comfortable. Very easy to adjust. And most imprtatny, NO WATER GETS IN! A++++."
5.0,Love the light weight frame of these glasses and the purple lens works great in bright light or overcast!
5.0,Very thin and breathable. Fit my 8 & 10 year olds well
5.0,"Love these, would wear them everyday if I could!!!"
5.0,I was elated when I realized this dress feels and fits exactly how it looks. The cotton is so light and comfortable. I've been wearing it nonstop and plan to order a few more colors of the same dress. I ordered a size up because I want to put it in the dryer. The color is really pretty as well and you can dress it up or down!
5.0,like..very light and thin for the summer
5.0,They were beautiful my granddaughter will grow into them.
5.0,These sparkly gemstone earrings will be perfect for valentine's day.
5.0,love them! feel like Jackie O when I wear them
5.0,These earrings are absolutely superlative!  I love them!  It's hard for me to find really well-made large clip-on earrings so I was so excited when I got these.
5.0,"So gorgeous...so many compliments!  The lenses has the perfect amount of tint, you can still see when you enter inside it's not dark at all.  My new favorite pair of sunshades!!"
5.0,"Since my wife spent a few years in South America and still misses it, I thought it might be a good idea to get some accessories what reminds her of the good old time. She absolutely loves the way it looks and wears the ever day."
5.0,"Robe is free size, but fits my medium frame well.  It is soft, long and comfortable.  The belt, pockets and extra long sleeves made this a winner for cold winter nights when I wanted to cuddle up with a warm cup of cocoa.  I definitely recommend the product!"
5.0,best purchase ever..love the way it looks..simifies my life.
5.0,"I like my Believe bracelet this far..  I just received it 3 days ago, & put it on 2 days ago.... it looks nice... I believe it will take a few days, if not a couple weeks before I will be able to feel if the magnets are helping with my arthritis.  I do believe it will help.. just haven't noticed a change yet."
5.0,Love the colors of course and for my trip to Jamaica 🇯🇲
5.0,"Great design, great fit, lightweight and super cute!"
5.0,I love this costume. Bought for my 7-month-old for Halloween. It is very soft and very nice quality. Even after multiple washes is still very soft and holding up well. would defiantly recommend
5.0,My son is a size 12 shoe and I bought a 13 and it fits great!
5.0,"These were perfect for a sci-fi theme party I went too, got tons of compliments on them."
5.0,"This linen garment is beautiful as the colors are not flashy, just warm and vibrant. I get compliments every time I wear it and usually wear it as a long blouse with a long skirt or even jeans. I thought it had pockets and was disappointed I was wrong but it really is a beautiful addition to ones wardrobe. After reading the reviews I'd ordered a size up. It is as I had wanted, baggy. The material does not allow for stretching as it is linen. Heavy chested women I urge you to go a size or two up as even after I did, it's a tad snug."
5.0,Pretty in pink.....looks just as pictured. Get lots of compliments on it and very functional as well. Like the long strap that comes with it. It looks like a much more expensive handbag.
5.0,"Beautiful, well made and comfortable. I can easily wear these and I typically have a larger wrist (8 inch). I will order more for gifts!"
5.0,definitely get this pendulum its great for the price and it's literally so cute.
5.0,Loved the necklace! good length very stylish:) goldish bronze color has looked good in all my outfits :) would recommend to a friend
5.0,My dad had swelling and this worked great!!!
5.0,"I bought this because it was one of the few watches I could find that were entirely mechanical and thus EMP proof, and didn't cost a ton."
5.0,"I recommend getting those wide backs to keep the earring facing front properly. Quality, no sensitivity issues (and I’m pretty sensitive to metals), great price and style!"
5.0,The bag is well made. I wish it was a little bigger but it's big enough to hold my valuables and keep them safe. The customer service was also great. I had a slight problem and they took care of it quickly and professionally. This bag is a great value compared to similar products.
5.0,My daughter wore this the next day after the wedding. Very cute.
5.0,"Give good wrap around protection, comfortable to wear."
5.0,Very nice. Comfortable. Warm.
5.0,Just what my daughters wanted to make earrings. Apparently these things are all the rage.
5.0,I’m always getting complemented mostly on the blue or the turquoise love it
5.0,"Got these for my 16 year old son, He wears size 12--13 in shoes and I got him a 12.5 in these slippers and they fit him perfectly. He said they're very comfy and he can even drive in them lol."
5.0,These are so flipping great. They fit on the heels I needed them for and we put them out at my wedding. It was an outdoor wedding and indoor (with a nice wood floor) reception so these were a massive hit. They came in their separate baggies so I just put them out in a basket with a sign requesting they wear them on the floor. There were none left so I take that as a hit. I had on stilettos and didn't sink into the grass once. That's kind of miraculous since the ground was marshy.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:c3c5444013aedac0052ec34eb402a1ca]] I wear this everyday.  It is has a big look, but is lightweight.  I forget that I’m wearing it.  It is very comfortable. I love the rhodium coating.  I believe a lot of people don’t understand the benefits of this process.  Rhodium plating is a top coat over the sterling silver.  It increases shine, protection, and resistant to scratching.  This is how I prefer my silver.  Keeps it from tarnishing.  Very nice looking chain with a good strong clasp.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)"
5.0,"If I could have all of my clothes made of this material I totally would. I wasn’t expecting this dress to be super soft because you can’t really tell just by looking at the pictures. I already knew the dress was going to be cute however whenever I opened up the bag I was highly impressed with how it felt. It made me love the dress that much more. I didn’t realize I ordered an extra large, a large with a fit me better but that’s my fault. It is definitely A comfortable dress but also a very warm dress in case I need to wear it in the winter for an event or special occasion."
5.0,I bought this for my nephew and he liked it very much. My mom and a lady from her church liked it and wanted to get one for themselves. It was a birthday gift and I was not happy about the wait time for it to arrive but my nephew liked it and I gues that’s all that matters..
5.0,"I didn’t know what to expect after reading mixed reviews.  However, after receiving the product, I am very pleased.<br />It fits tight, as I wanted it to, holding in and flattening lower tummy.  Also, lifts and holds backside in place as described.  Durable, breathable material.  There is boning up sides and back, but it’s not visible through tight dresses.  Very pleased."
5.0,The skull caps fit well. I plan on wearing them under my cap during the Summer. I like that they are made of breathable material and can be washed easily.
5.0,very very clear great quality. love that i can wear these in uniform and be within regs. i would recommend these to anyone and everyone
5.0,Don't know what to say other than my mom loved it; it was a gift and is perfect for any Catholic on your list.
5.0,Looks really nice on... But only thing i didnt like is that the band pulled the threads off some of my clothes. So i only use it on special occasions.
5.0,Lg even after washing it
5.0,"I'm writing this review as someone who loves to sew and normally makes my own leggings. But I don't have the equipment to make the nice flatlocked seams used in these pants, and I also can't always find sufficiently stretchy and opaque fabric for such a close-fitting garment. I could not purchase the fabric for the cost of these pants, and I couldn't duplicate their construction methods.<br /><br />I am 5'2&#34; and the inseam is a little bit longer than I would prefer, but other than that the small is a good fit (I usually wear a 6 or 8 petite in pants).<br /><br />Overall very satisfied with these pants AND I've ordered another pair."
5.0,Nice and thick and heavy.  Beautiful
5.0,Fits great & love the way it looks!
5.0,I wear this on my lanyard at work. I didnt notice the weight difference until I use my keys for something and it pulls away from the retractable cord. Love the military time referance.  Comes is very handy bc I wear a fit bit instead of a watch.
5.0,Nice tie for a Yayoi Kusama polka dot party.
5.0,For the price this is an awesome product.  Pretty much purchase ratchet belts exclusively now because of the way they fit.  One of the best I’ve bought and at the best price. Double bonus.  Will look for more from this supplier in the future.
5.0,I love that it for both my boys perfect it wasn’t to tight and didn’t leave lines!!
5.0,Cheap work watch !
5.0,My son shopped for watches for 2 years! HE finally decided on this one based on reviews and much research. So far he is delighted with this watch!
5.0,"My son loves them, very bright, lots of fun. He says that they are a comfortable fit for him. Thank you."
5.0,"This is a super cute dress for summer. I originally purchased a M, fit was slightly loose at the cut outs (side/flank). I thought about taking to have it altered but instead ordered the small… Perfect fit! As another buyer mentioned, there are no tags per say, but there was a slight different in the dress- not really noticeable in the chest, really only more fitted in those cut out areas! For Reference, 5’4 32 DD and 130lbs."
5.0,Just what mom wanted.
5.0,"I love these sweatshirts with leggings. Lightweight (sweatshirt, but very lightweight.... NOT t-shirt weight like someone said), and long.  Very cute."
5.0,"Soft, smooth, perfect!<br />Absolutely beautiful and soft, the wash nicely.  Great gift and a treasure to own.<br />I will purchase again!"
5.0,GAVE OUT AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR XMAS
5.0,"Fits comfortably. Lasts in shower, ocean and pool"
5.0,I love it I got wear it to tekko it was awesome
5.0,"Easy to change out, very comfortable"
5.0,I love these socks! I'll be ordering more.
5.0,Great quality. Great pattern.
5.0,"I rarely write a review, but I was amazed at how well these earring backs work. I have had a pair of real diamond earrings for over three years and was afraid to wear them because I didn’t want to lose them so I tried these earring backs, and I feel confident that I am not going to lose my earrings!"
5.0,"This backpack is lightweight, yet has loads of room, pockets and straps. Compact enough for a small person, but big enough for a sleeping bag and a tent."
5.0,Good stretch and fit!
5.0,Elegant gift for my mother. She loves it
5.0,Comfy and great fit although I’m tall and they do not go down to the ankle they still look good!
5.0,My children on the school bus loved them.  More comfortable and easier to keep up with than mask
5.0,This top is so warm! I use this when walking in the cool mornings in Colorado. The fabric is very soft and not itchy like wool normally is. Love this top! This was the best price found as well! These tops are also sold at the ski resorts and go for a lot more!
5.0,Great price for quality.
5.0,"I love it, it fits good and i am always getting compliments on how sparly it is!!!"
5.0,"Bought for my wife following her abdominal surgery, and performed marvelously.  Highly recommended!"
5.0,Good leather brown band. Fits great
5.0,The best pressure socks I've ever bought.  They work very well!!
5.0,"Absolutely adorable, sexy, and feminine! I love how open and lacy the neckline is. Robes tend to cover more of my neck and chest area than I like.<br />The pink is a sweet and delicate cherry blossom color.<br />Suuuper soft and comfy.<br />Not a whole lot of coverage, not completely opaque. Can't speak for the black one, but the pink one is not something to use to cover up around people you don't want seeing you scantily clad (ex. parents or the mailman), but great for quickly covering up to go from your bathroom to your dresser so your neighbors don't see you butt naked thru the window, or obvs for looking sexy for your partner."
5.0,"Beautiful and made very well, will buy from them again."
5.0,"Great Shirt and good quality for the price. I just wish the sleeves would of been a little longer, then I would of given it five stars across the board."
5.0,"love,  quality  is better than I expected I’m super picky and I love this it!"
5.0,Love the Disney design but they are big
5.0,Nice and elegant .....gives you a sassy look
5.0,"Super cute, warm comfy. I love it so much, I just bought another."
5.0,Nice and sturdy. Seemed high quality.
5.0,Such a lovely deep purple.  Hinges appear to be well made.
5.0,Cute shirt for my son. Arms were short for the size but otherwise good.
5.0,"Very nice, have been using for over a month with no irritation"
5.0,Very cute. The material is thin but with a chunky cardigan it is perfect!
5.0,Very comfortable! My husband loves them.
5.0,These are awesome. Thank you
5.0,"These were unexpectedly slippery, resulting in many laughs as I watched him slide on the furniture. The fabric is warmer than expected, so even though they're light, they hold heat. The sleeves were a little shorter than expected, but it doesn't bother my husband any. Instead of a full length sleeve, it fits like a 3-quarter sleeve instead, ending at the middle of his forearms. The pant size fit as expected and are true to full length, ending at his ankles. So far they wash well, and haven't bled any color. I'd buy them again."
5.0,"The earrings are beautiful. I received lot's of compliments, when I wear them. Perfect size for me, not to small, and not to big. Price is good too. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Very comfortable. Easy to put on. Love them!
5.0,Looks great. Hangs great. Washes great.
5.0,"Since the reviews said the sizes were small, I ordered the 6.5 size. It was way too big. I exchanged it for the 5.5 which is perfect. I was very pleased with the turnaround time. It is the most functional piece of jewelry that I own."
5.0,"This hangbag is lovely and strong. I love it,  I bring it to school which it suitable for me and it holds my books plus other things. But be aware that it is not a big bag it just a right size bag. I had it for three months and still in good condition."
5.0,"Very nice watch I bought two, one for myself and one for my son."
5.0,The color has more of a reddish tone to it but I love it!! It fits perfectly. I purchased an xsmall. I’m 5 feet tall and 110 pounds. The sleeves are a tad bit long but I just folded them under and it looks great. I’m going to have someone sew them for me. I’m used to having to do that with nearly all jackets I get because I’m so petite.
5.0,I ordered and received this silicone replacement band by V-Moro in two days due to being an Amazon Prime member. It arrived nicely packaged and received no damage during shipment. The band fits my Fitbit Alta perfectly and is easy to put on and take off. The band is very comfortable and stays buckled on. I would not hesitate to recommend this to my family and friends!!!
5.0,"Very nice aprons with adjustable neck strap. I bought these aprons to look professional while serving. The aprons came well packaged and on time. They are very stiff but, I ran them through a short gentle cycle and added a small amount of fabric softener and dried on light heat  They came out very nice. We only use them once, for right now. But will be using them again soon. They seem as though that they will hold up to your task. Also; the ties are long enough that you might have to wrap around a second time. If you're short and adjusting the neck strap isn't enough then you may have to pull it up and tie around your waist again."
5.0,"Fast shipping, amazing quality product! The dogtag is heavy and the colors are bright! I've been wearing this daily since it arrived in my mailbox."
5.0,great to workout in
5.0,"Beautiful color, plenty of room for all my stuff.  Love the shoulder strap also when I've got one of those days with my hands full."
5.0,"The pendant is very well-made, its color is heavier and looks more beautiful than it appears in the picture. Got it for a very reasonable prize. Totally satisfied."
5.0,"Despite an ecchi cover, the comic is diverse and pretty funny."
5.0,"I work in a plant nursery that operates year round. The most horrid thing is having wet, cold gloves. Been using these for six weeks and they are outstanding!! Based on reviews I ordered an XL. Should have gotten the Large. Usually wear a medium which work fine (re ordered) but they are hard to get off. Loved them so much I ordered more for co-workers and myself!"
5.0,"Seriously my first review ever on Amazon, but this dress is worth the 5-star review and then some! Just got home from a wedding and I received ALL the compliments! Comfortable, great fit, and just stunning. Buy. The. Dress."
5.0,Loved the shorts and 2piece linen short set. They were perfect. Everything was great we will be purchasing again soon
5.0,"Really cute, I need a silver one next...Lol"
5.0,Love these!  I have sensitive ears and they don't make me break out!  Super pretty and sparkly!
5.0,When my grandma passed away I needed a dress fast! Look no more Amazon always has my back! I found this dress for a great price and it was classy and a great length. It has a nice stretch to it and is very flattering and not itchy at all.
5.0,"Not sheer at all, fits the exact way that I like. Sleeves are long enough to be comfortable and looks great with a cardigan."
5.0,"These glasses are delicate, but they are AWESOME.  They make people smile and make you feel really cute.  For this price...so worth it.  I would definitely purchase again!"
5.0,I like the style and comfort of this dress

5.0,Nice selection. For the price couldn't go wrong.
5.0,These are so cute on my little one. Cheap great for her aviator halloween costume. light weight.
5.0,"Exactly what I needed. I have several piercings that use this size ball, and I'm constantly losing them. This is nice if you want to just buy them in bulk"
5.0,Needed a slim glasses case and this was perfect. Exactly as described and excellent material and workmanship.
5.0,What a great bargain as my husband's weight recently has been fluctuating. They look good no matter what he wears. I highly recommend these to those whose belts are not comfortable.
5.0,"Very nice item, arrived quite fast and is of good looking high quality, recomended!"
5.0,Fits as expected. Nice fabric. Washed without shrinking.
5.0,Love my hat. Great vivid colors (Green) Let you stay in the sun longer because you don’t over heat so quick. A must have for off shore or but the pool.
5.0,Love the earrings. Look like the real thing and cost very little
5.0,"I bought the size I always get.  Further I bought 2 in the color line, one fit perfectly...the other one I couldn't get on.  Both same size by tag."
5.0,this wallet is so neat!! i love it
5.0,my mom loved this
5.0,Fits perfect great material quality
5.0,Best bag ever made.
5.0,"I got so many compliments on this dress! For those of you (like myself) who are heavy chested, this dress gives you full coverage. I wore this dress for a beach wedding, but I’m sure it would be great for any occasion. I was pleasantly surprised about the material and how it fit."
5.0,It has a very retro feel. I’m pretty sure it’s pure polyester which makes it durable. Can’t really wear any type of bra with it but it’s cute that way. Good dress.
5.0,I got these for my toddler for Christmas. He loves them! & they're surprisingly durable as he has a special niche for destroying things. Definitely worth the buy! He has so much fun playing in them & it's hysterical watching the capes as they run away.
5.0,Nice masks. Fit well. Great thickness with space to put extra padding.
5.0,"I love this sports bra....no wires, no plastic pieces from straps that cut into your skin...simply smooth, soft fabric...great for exercise or every day! It fits true to size...I wear a 38 C bra and purchased a pack of XL. I will be ordering MORE !!! Best Bra EVER!! Thank YOU!!!"
5.0,5⭐
5.0,Great product and great service will buy again
5.0,"This was second time I bought these robes and I still love them. They are soft, comfortable, have nice length and colors."
5.0,"I am using this watch band on a Garmin watch.  I had to modify it slightly to allow for the bottom sensor to be used.  I bought this band because it helps to improve the security of the watch.  If one of the pins fails on the watch, the time piece can still be maintained without dropping to the ground.  I'm happy with the product."
5.0,I have had this purse for almost a year and it's still in good condition the only thing that I noticed was a minor stitching error but besides that everything looks great
5.0,"Nice bright glass colors on a metal background.  Cheaply made, but looks good from the front.  My only concern is about the quality of the pin clasp.  It seems as if it would break or come loose easily.  Will have to try it for a while to know."
5.0,ordered these for xmas..but just got them on Jan 16....but the people loved them that they were xmas gifts for...just need to get shipped in time for xmas....

5.0,I have had my ring for only a week but so far I love it!!!! Very dainty...just like I wanted it. I am a new grandmother and I love the way it looks on my middle finger with my 2 daughter's birthstones and my some- in-laws  birthstone next to it. So far hasn't turned...thats just a lighting issue in pic. I really hope it want.<br />Oh...came packaged wonderfully. Great job.<br />Love it!
5.0,My daughter used it in school for a Boo costume from Monsters Inc. now I wear it. Big and comfy.

5.0,Love my body jewelry
5.0,Great Xmas gift
5.0,Wear it every day. Looks great  on my wrist. People ask me about it and I tell them to go on amazon
5.0,"It is big but makes it different and stylish in a weird but chic way. so warm!!! Also, I am 5 9&#34;. Not sure how it would be on a small person."
5.0,"Very comfortable shoes. I have neuropathy and my feet swell sometimes. Im not sure if the straps that goes around your ankle is supposed to glued to the cross strap, i seen a little glue where it could have been connected but wasnt when i got them. It worked for me though because it makes it easier to get on and off. Very soft cushion on my feet, i was out all day this past weekend and my feet didnt hurt at all. The pics i took when i tried them on,im sitting, they look as if they may not fit my wide fat feet lol, but i didnt have overhang of toes or anything when i stand up. Will buy again in other colors! They dont offer wide width, but i got these in my regular size which is 11."
5.0,This dress is beautiful and the quality is really good! I’m 5’1” and weight 150 lbs pretty big chested and a medium fit just right ;)
5.0,Super fast delivery and high quality tie bars.
5.0,I love it. Came very quickly and I would buy from seller again. The picture looks exactly like what the case looks like . I recommend this case to anyone that is a big pot head and has a ZTE Warp 7
5.0,This is my second Hobo wallet and I love it.  Only reason I gave up the first one was because I wore it out.
5.0,The item is beautiful and bigger than I expected
5.0,The glasses look amazing and feel very comfortable the only issue I had was because they’re a little too dark for indoor workplace. I would love to check more of your products with a lighter one.
5.0,"Beautiful spring/summer look, but most importantly, they are extremely comfortable."
5.0,La tela es super sueve me encanta la recomiendo 100%
5.0,Nice umbrella
5.0,I have to wear these for running or biking otherwise my feet get cramped up
5.0,"I don't mind having to wear this all day because it's thin, and breathable. So It's not ""protective"" but neither are face mask."
5.0,Beautiful shirts but 2T fit kind of snug on my daughter who is average size isn’t quite two yet. I’d advise people to go a size bigger.
5.0,"Very good quality belt. My husband loved it, the only problem was that I bought it so big but we give to a friend and he liked it."
5.0,"Comfortable fit,I wear them to Church for a dressy look."
5.0,"I purchased the mustard, cream, and burgundy leggings in the 6-9 month size for my 2.5 month old girl. They seem like they have good stretch to them, fairly thick, and hopefully room to grow! The only baggy part on her are the feet at the moment so we will test the streach over the next few months. I love how this pack is vercitile for fall/winter colors."
5.0,I got bigger because I heard they run small. The slightly larger size is perfect for me.
5.0,I just bought this fun &#34;statement&#34; necklace and I love it.  I would highly recommend this piece for a great accent piece.<br /><br />I have also purchased a number of MeMe London bracelets.  They are such a fun accessory to own!  I have loved pairing lots of different combinations to get just the right color punch for any occasion.  I don't do &#34;complicated&#34; and this is why these bracelets are perfect for me.  They make a simple outfit pop and I barely have to think about it.  These bracelets are an affordable way to accessorize and I love wearing them and the charms on each one are adorable.
5.0,"My Dr had me fitted for some $80 a pair compression socks that were worn one time and it hurt so bad taking them off, I refused to put them on again. Another Dr recommended socks like theses since it would be better then nothing. That being said I have tried a few brands and the copper fit 2.0 seems to be easier to get on then some of the others I've tried. They feel good when I am wearing them, I think they look good, and they seem to help keep the swelling down in my lower legs. They are not hard to take off, and best of all it's not painful removing them. I feel like these are more comfortable than some of the other brands I've had."
5.0,Love love love this set of earrings. A color to match any outfit and very lightweight. Excellent deal for the price. I only wish they were offered with a silver hook option as well.
5.0,"The slippers are wonderful, fit great and wash in the machine very well, No shrinkage. I think they are so cosy."
5.0,"I am 5’4 125 lbs and the small fit well. Odd material, but it is very cute for my job as a speech therapist"
5.0,"I have several other G-Shocks ... overall I like this one the best.  The blue color, and the translucent quality of the band is gorgeous.  I really like the balance of analogue and digital time display features.  I didn't think I would care much about the tide and moon phase displays, but actually they are really fun and I find myself referring to them often.  Great watch!"
5.0,Fit and comfort couldn’t be better
5.0,These don't fit necessarily as their advertised. They're slightly tighter but not to small to warrant a return
5.0,love these - they work perfectly with my blue outfit -  the links of the chain is beautiful and makes an outstanding statement on my skin color!...thanks again amazon.
5.0,"is a gift for my husband , it looks sturdy ,it was shipped on time, got it earlier then expected"
5.0,"Super cute! If you like a little more oversized I recommend sizing up. I like how mine fits, but some people like more oversized."
5.0,"Very, very cute and comfortable slipper that can be worn as a sandal outside. It looks like a cushy sandal."
5.0,Came on time works great
5.0,Most comfortable sweatpants I've owned
5.0,These were really cute for a 1940s themed party and everyone loved them.  There were none left behind when the guests left!
5.0,"I wore them here and there, but the first time I wore them all day was on New Years Eve. I manage a bar, and it was great to have such a comfortable shoe on."
5.0,Really love these robes I got three different colors very silky and soft and  light excellent for the price 👍
5.0,[[VIDEOID:4cf1d6a02b2388f39749ff39029e52cb]] It’s been a week since I bought it. They’re amazing. I wear them everyday & everywhere
5.0,Very comfortable! Perfect for office!
5.0,"I have size 9.5 feet and the straps are comfortable. Honestly, I wanted some sort of toe sock to protect my pedicured nails because wearing flats will sometimes rub the polish off the tip of my big toes. These seem perfect and I have been wearing them all day and don't notice them because they are comfortable.  They also just cover to the base of my toes so I think I'll be able to wear these with most all of my flats."
5.0,"Bands fit the watch perfectly, I have been wearing the single band since May 16 and it is now Nov 16 I get quite a few complements on the band, however I couldn't make the double band to keep the watch against my wrist so it kept loosing contact requiring me to re enter my password every few minutes so needless to say I took it off."
5.0,Perfect gift for teacher!
5.0,gifts for family members
5.0,Crisp professional look. Slight give for comfort in shoulders. Order one size up which maintains a tailored look (not oversized).  Order 2 sizes up for oversized look. Does cover butt.
5.0,Very cute.  I bought for my 6 year old.  Her school was celebrating the fiftieth day of school with 50s day.  The glasses really complimented her 50s costume!  They fit a child well.
5.0,Love this tank it's so comfortable and great for all occasions!

5.0,I ordered this hat for my husband and he loved it. He said it fits great! He's satisfied and so am I.
5.0,OMG This dress is so beautiful on. Id get it one size smaller than your usual size because It runs a smidge big.
5.0,Very cute sweatshirt! Soft and fits well (I'm 5'1 and got the small). Doesn't feel cheap either.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful!!!  :)
5.0,I like the design of these suits. They are well-made and hold up really well. I am glad that I found this website.
5.0,I really love this band. I get so many compliments on it. Doesn’t feel like leather but not plastic feel either. So far has kept great shape .
5.0,So cute! Got a size small and fits great. Nice oversized sweater
5.0,I like the stretch but I can't get it to go really small.  It won't record my sleep either too good because it moves around.  But otherwise I do like it very comfortable!!
5.0,Great quality. Great customer  service.  Buy with confidence.
5.0,Better than I expected... great style! Love the fabric! Size is true!
5.0,Very pretty dress and true to size for my daughter!!
5.0,"Joe's is awesome and so is this t-shirt.  it's a much nicer fit than a man's shirt and the style is awesome.  It's a lot brighter blue than the picture, not navy at all.  I would order again."
5.0,wonderful fits wonderful once old band was removed
5.0,"Their very cute and don't stick way out like most Lebrets do when I smile. Perfect size, pretty and the cost is great too. I bought too sets, and they come with and awesome velvet black pouch. Great for ear studs too if you wanted."
5.0,"My new favorite things. I did remove the Hitler 'stache though, didn't care for that. Fit is perfect! I usually wear a 7.5 and the 7.5 is just right."
5.0,It was just like it says! Loved it 💞💞
5.0,I’ve gotten so many compliments on this hoodie. I love it! It’s perfect for cooler summer nights and roomie enough to layer under it for colder weather.<br />The color is so pretty.
5.0,"Great product, very comfortable, the sole is great for walking.I was surprised the sole felt so soft.  I ordered a size up to allow for extra room if needed for feet swelling. Very cozy, love the length around the legs. Well packaged, fast delivery. Glad they are machine washable. I would order this again."
5.0,Fit my 3yr old perfectly for crazy sock day at school
5.0,Super cute on I usually  wear a small or med but after I read the reviews I  purchased  a Large.
5.0,Gorgeous knit ....high end luxury.  I'm so glad I purchased 3 colors before they sold out.  Go up a size...it runs a bit small on top.  I wear an 8 which is normally a medium but after reading reviews I purchased the large and glad I did.
5.0,This was a hit with my 24 year old daughter who's into that steampunk styled jewelry.  It made a great socking stuffer for her!  The chain is long and fairly thin and should hold up as long as the granddaughter doesn't grab ahold of it and yank it off her neck.
5.0,They are awesomely perfect
5.0,I got these last minute for a sunny regatta and wanted to be protected from water and the sun. I really liked that they came with 5 different shades and even a little manual with suggestions on when to use each. There was some confusion on how to change the shades despite instruction but I later had that resolved.
5.0,Excellent construction and very comfortable. This product exceeded my expectations.
5.0,I use this as a face cover for the Covid. Working outside in the public with 90+ degrees and high humidity. This face covering Functions fine when it’s saturated with sweat and just a few snaps pulling the cloth off my face sets off the cooling evaporation! This is indeed nicely cool and it is comfortable for 10+ hours
5.0,Fits my husband perfect
5.0,"fit great, super cute!"
5.0,Hubby loved it and it arrived a little earlier than I was originally told.
5.0,This was a simple concept yet very functional.
5.0,This is a very nice and comfy dress it just runs small. I ordered x large and it's more like a medium
5.0,It was as good as I expected
5.0,"Copper definitely helps , and the 15-20 strength is great. Helps keep my leg swelling under control, and they are comfortable. Wash on cold  gentle cycle & hang to dry!"
5.0,"I got two of these, one for my keys and one for my girlfriend. They're so cute, we love them! The paracord won't scratch the matte paint on either bike. They're so fun to carry around and easy to squish in a pocket when you aren't on your bike. They're just as excited to go our riding as we are!"
5.0,"These ankle boots are stylish, classic and very comfortable! The scalloping at the top of the boot is a nice detail that sets it apart from other booties on the market. The black color looks great with anything from jeans to dresses. The rubber sole is good quality and absorbs walking impact well. It fits amazingly and is true to size. You will receive so many compliments when wearing these!"
5.0,Fit perfectly! A bit long for my taste (I’m 5’2) but for the wedding it was perfect!
5.0,My particular 3 year old wears them. So I have no complaints
5.0,Just arrived. Just tried it on and I LOVE IT!!!!!<br />So slimming. And I can dress it up or down.
5.0,"Soft, stretchy very comfortable, no wrinkles!!!"
5.0,I Started to jog
5.0,I bought two of these dresses to wear in Thailand and they were absolutely perfect!  The fabric is light enough that it isn't too hot but thick enough that it holds its shape and doesn't blow around too much. It can be worn on or off the shoulders depending on how sultry one wants to be. Great for casual days or going to a nice bar at night.
5.0,"This wallet was a nice match for my wife's Coach purse she purchased seperately.  Had everything she was looking for.  Well made and stylish.  She's still using it, and it still looks great years later!"
5.0,The earrings are so beautiful and vibrant. Also the perfect size. These earrings are great for a pop of color without being unprofessional.
5.0,"So I got these for my husband and immediately he liked the colors that came. The material seems to be made of a good rubber material. The rubber is flexible and soft, not stiff. He likes the comfort on his finger. He has been wearing it for a while and has no complaints. I had purchased a QALO ring before and it did it's job by ripping away when needed. My husband has not been in the situation for this to happen, yet, but the ring itself seems similar to the QALO and I am hoping it will just rip away as needed as well. He said the ring was very light and almost feels like it is not even on his finger which he likes very much. We are both very happy with these new silicone rings. I would get again for sure."
5.0,My three year old loves his orange sunglasses. Bought them for the beach and they stayed on the entire time.
5.0,This was perfect for our Fairly Oddparents Halloween costume.  We stuck a wire on it and they floated perfectly over our heads!
5.0,"Great variety, great value for money!"
5.0,Love the necklace. I loves the ones I bought in Venice. To my surprise I can buy the same quality on Amazon.
5.0,"The real deal.  Follow a one-time simple set-up and you'll always know what time it is, which way is north, how high you are, and the current barometric pressure."
5.0,I was little hesitant of this but they are surprisingly comfortable and help with the painful saddle. The pad is thick but not too bulky and is true to size.
5.0,This crown was absolutely gorgeous! I bought it for my daughter to wear at her surprise Sweet 16 and this was the perfect accessory for her special day. It was a good weight and just gorgeous!! It came beautifully packaged in a drawstring pouch and included bobby pins to secure the crown in her hair.
5.0,"Very Happy with this. Wear it often. Not had any problems with it.  It is a little bit larger than I prefer but I do have small wrists and arms. It matches earings I have. Took a little longer to receive, but it's okay as long it doesn't fall apart and I like it."
5.0,Sooooo soft.  A twitch long but I’ll make it work.  Love the feel.
5.0,Very comfortable and they stay in place better than my flat cloth pads.
5.0,I love it!!  Very nice
5.0,"Love this top!  I normally wear a large, but with this brand, I wear a medium. It is definitely loose and flowy!  I could have probably wore the small, but I like it loose."
5.0,Nice everyday top or casual dress
5.0,Nice quality and excellent value.  I'm very happy with these glasses.
5.0,Love this shirt with my llr
5.0,Love that the graphic on the front is super thick! Very durable and should last so much longer than regular graphic tees...runs small though. I ordered a men’s small I’m 4’10  95pounds and it’s tighter than I prefer my shirts to be but still 5 stars!!! ⭐️
5.0,My girlfriend loved this necklace and has received many compliments<br />Quality is excellent and very happy with the purchase
5.0,"nice colors, vibrant"
5.0,I have a large noggin and hats don't usually fit but this one does.  Looks like the photo
5.0,My son loves these. They are warm and easy for him to put on.
5.0,"My little dog is a free spirit.  Many times I resolved to never let her off leash in the park again because she regards commands as suggestions.  I resisted putting a bell on her for a variety of reasons but my peace of mind won out. This is my third set.  The first set was really cute for crafting but useless for GPSing my dog.  The second set was decent but I had to really strain to hear the sound past fifteen or twenty feet.  The third time was the charm.  I put the largest bell on her last night.  She's a bitty little thing but she doesn't seem to mind.  What a difference!  I don't know the exact range of audibility it has but I suppose it's a good fifty feet or so.  The sound is loud but not clanging like those annoying Salvation Army Santa bells on street corners at Christmastime that my city finally banned.  The sound is duller, mellower.  And now walking my dog in the park will be much mellower too!  UPDATE:  I can hear this bell from WAY more than fifty feet.  Probably more like 200 feet.  It depends on variables like ambient noise and weather conditions.  I just know that if I can’t hear her she has gone too far!  I do wish the large bell was sold separately."
5.0,"This is my second one of this style and I love them. I'm a size 8-10 in dresses and they fit perfect on me! They are wide enough to cross over my 34-36C bust line and my 41&#34; hips reaching just about mid calf and 5'4&#34;. The colors are vibrant and the material is soft. My first one in the light pink has been worn more days than not in the last 5 months and has held up well with multiple washes, I even throw it in the dryer."
5.0,This bag is exactly as described. The quality and durability is outstanding. It was a gift for my college daughter and she loves it. Worth the price.
5.0,"Correct fit and quality, great timming for delivery<br />100% recommended"
5.0,My son uses us med ordered large was to small reordered 2x xl and fits him great this is just info for those wondering us fit
5.0,Love these.<br /><br />I am hesitant on buying tall socks online because I don't have the thinnest leg. Other socks I have tried are quite difficult to get over my calf and also pinch below my knee cap.<br /><br />These are much more comfortable and do not pinch. They are a little snug over my calf but then ease after the top is pulled up all the way.<br />I would definitely buy another pair.
5.0,I really like this mask nice fit awesome detail
5.0,"I bought as a gift and she loved it! The quality of the shirt was so much better than the average see through, thin type."
5.0,"Easy to put on and take off, perfect for toddlers learning to dress themselves.<br />Also very cute with a flexible sole. My toddler often removes his crocs when walking on the stairs but these stay on- very comfortable.<br />I am looking for these in other colors!"
5.0,"I must say that I am skeptical when it comes to buying leggings, especially the &#34;soft&#34; ones. I have bought some that literally fall apart however, with these from leggings depot I am so far pleasantly surprised. I wore them for the first time today. They are pretty, comfortable, and durable. I did notice that they appear to be double stitched, which is nice. If anything changes I will update, but for now I fully recommend them!"
5.0,"I love these gloves for fishing, makes it easy for handling the bigger fish! Plus it keeps the slime off my hands and they also keep my hands from smelling like fish! Great buy!"
5.0,"Not gonna lie - I didn't read the description..<br /><br />This is the second pair of 365 Sleepers I've ordered. Originally I bought the 5mm/20g pair but they were too small diameter wise so I ordered these, 6mm. What I didn't see is that the gauge also went up to 16g (I believe that's standard for cartilage piercings). I've been wearing normal earrings lately (20g) so it's safe to say the holes closed a little. When I went to put these in there was a little resistance and I had to force them in but it wasn't terribly painful. I had trouble closing the bottom one but probably just user error.<br /><br />They fit perfectly and are just what I was looking for. Look great and will probably order more colors in the future."
5.0,"I love wearing unique jewelry pieces &amp; I love this Beaded Tassel Pendant by D Exceed. The white, light blue &amp; ivory colors are perfect for wearing with Spring pastels but it will look great all year long.<br />The necklace comes in a soft drawstring pouch that is great for giving this as a gift. The necklace is made of two different sizes of white beads &amp; is accented with white &amp; gold chains, transparent blue beads &amp; white fringe tassels. It is lightweight &amp; comfortable to wear. It closes with a gold lobster clasp but it is large enough to slip on over my head so I don’t use the clasp.<br />The colors of this necklace remind me of the beach so I’ll be wearing it a lot during warm weather but it will also look good with a little black dress or your favorite Winter White blouse or sweater.<br />As a product review blogger, I often receive products free or at a deep discount in exchange for my honest review. The opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my personal use of the product."
5.0,"These are gorgeous little boot socks. I think the are perfect for the rain and snowy weather. Your little tike will be over the moon excited about these darlings. The fabric is thick enough to be warm, but not thick enough to be uncomfortable for the child. I would suggest these be for kids under the age of 7. I got these for the little girl I watch, and they were too small for her. Be cautious about that.<br />These were complementary based on my review"
5.0,"I bought this item for my 6th grader's, ""Wear your favorite college's shirt day,"" and since her school is protestant and we're Catholic, it stands to reason that we got this shirt."
5.0,"I love the pattern, fit, and weight of this shirt! Exactly what I was looking for!"
5.0,Fits perfectly and the front pouch holds my range finder perfectly. I can even store my spare mags on the side pouches. Highly recommend. Also has a lifetime warranty.
5.0,Love the 80's look and this is the same watch i wore when i was back in high school.  Casio is a great watch and reliable and you can not beat the price.  Love it!
5.0,Dress pattern is nothing like illustration
5.0,Super cute shirt! Colors are vibrant and shirt is soft. I’m usually a medium in Bella canvas but sized up to a large for length and it fits perfect! Excellent for the price!
5.0,"I ordered this for my husband as an Eid gift. He LOVES it. He doesn't normally wear watches, but he will not take this off. He wears it every day! This is a great gift idea. It fits his wrist too and he's a big and tall man. So I'm very happy with this warch."
5.0,"Beautiful dress! My measurements are 34b, 28&#34; waist, 11&#34; upper arm and 120 Ibs, 5ft 3. This dress fits perfect! Comfortable and not too tight. However, I am having it taken up though as i like my dresses 2&#34; above the knee, and this dress falls about 3&#34; below my knees."
5.0,You can read it very cute
5.0,This medical I.D. bracelet is beautiful ! it feels nice and solid and is very comfortable! The color is a beautiful rose gold. The engraving is very well done and legible. The bracelet comes with a medical alert wallet card and a cute little storage bag. I am extremely pleased!
5.0,"This is the original band for the sgw-100 for sure. However, only the bands were included no pins or the metal clip needed to secure the band to the watch. Luckily, I hadn't thrown out the old bands and was able to salvage the metal clip and pins from it. Otherwise the product is durable and comfortable. With the price, I was expecting at least for the metal clips to be included, thats my only disappointment. If you already have the metal clip, this band will do you well, if not you might be returning it or searching for those clips to purchase online."
5.0,"Such a nice necklace, a great price, and great as a gift item!"
5.0,"It is a comfy dress, color as pictured. it is a see thru dress, so I used a liner. Value goes with it."
5.0,"Nice, comfy & fits as expected."
5.0,I wore this to my work's Christmas party and everyone liked it.
5.0,Fit and looked good
5.0,I'm very pleased with the quality of this strap. I bought it for a new watch I ordered it had the design i was looking for that would suit it. I've been looking for days and found another strap similar to this one but about 3xs the cost.<br /><br />Will update photos once my watch is in.<br /><br />Looks perfect on my moded Seiko!!
5.0,Love that this mask fits my baby he’s 1 and half all the masks I’ve bought are too big and these are perfect size for him I definitely recommend this if you have a 1 year old!
5.0,Beautiful details - great metal details - interior pockets.
5.0,One cord I had broke. The magnetic one just fell off while I was wearing it. This one has worked fine. I like the latch that you can actually squeeze.
5.0,I love the glass holders however they break easily . Did not know they have a guarantee and will replace them. Thank you Kate! Excellent customer service and nice to see you stand behind your product.<br />Bill<br />Retired United States Air Force (29yrs)
5.0,This shoes are well made and durable. The color is nice and the fit is true to size.
5.0,"These earrings were just what I was looking for. They are the right size without being too flashy. Nice detail, you can tell that it is a dolphin, not a fish."
5.0,2 1/2 weeks delivery.  Beautiful!
5.0,love these beads will order again.
5.0,"Nice set of matching scarf and hat. Both are two toned attractive shades of red and navy blue. The set has bigger stitches than I anticipated, but still very attractive. Both items are machine washable and dry flat."
5.0,"I had really low expectations for these, but my lord they are so SOFT and comfortable. I have a large head, but these fit nicely, keep my crazy curls at bay and I would expect fit a wide variety of head sizes. Wish they had more colors! The designs are great, and they're well made!"
5.0,"I bought this to wear on a 13 hour overnight flight. Instead of wearing my usual satin bonnet to protect my hair while I sleep, I wanted something a bit more stylish to wear in public. This was perfect. It looked great and fit great. And when it was time to land, my hair looked flawless. Highly recommend. I am considering getting a few additional colors."
5.0,This is a classy looking ring. Well finished and very comfortable. True to size ordered. Looks exactly like the ring on a national chain jewelry store's site for $275! Love it.
5.0,"I bought this outfit for a 15&#34; American Girl Bitty Baby doll. The t-shirt, pants and hat fit the doll perfectly. The sleeper was too long. I'm hoping it will shrink some in the wash."
5.0,Very nice comfortable and true to size!
5.0,"I was pretty uncertain about the quality I would get on this watchband, but I was really surprised at how good it is.  I have a Galaxy Gear S3 and have several other bands for it in leather and silicone rubber, but wanted a metal band.  I have purchased other bands the indicated they were stainless with solid links and been disappointed, but not this time.  The band is pretty heavy, so you would want to be prepared for that.  It looks great.  One note if your wrist is particularly large, the band may not work for you.  I usually need an extra long band as my wrist is about 7 3/4 inches, you might squeeze it on if you wrist is 8 inches, but any larger and you would not be able to use it.  I didn't remove any links and it is comfortable.  It comes with two sets of quick release pins, which is nice because the pins are not captured by the band and could easily fall out if you change out the band.  It also comes with a link removal tool and a pin tool that I did not use, but looks like it would probably work.  As a &#34;watch guy&#34; I would prefer to use the tools I have, but if you have no tools you can probably avoid buying any or going to a watch repair/jewelry store to have the band adjusted.  It looks like this one is a keeper."
5.0,My friend is 5'3 100lbs using the xs size and she loves it. She uses it to go outside in 20° and lower temperatures and has never complained.
5.0,"I bought this in 5 colors to have to wear during winter time travels up north. Cost effective, pretty, and launder well."
5.0,Great prize for our school festival.
5.0,I wore this to my husband’s Christmas party! I got so many compliments!!!
5.0,Very nice. Doesn't shrink after washing either. :)
5.0,"This bag works great. Very comfortable. Mine is packed to the brim with a four person tent two twin blow up mattresses and pump camp stove first aid kit small fire kit map and more small necessities.  It's comfortable to carry hours at a time and hold up to the abuse well.<br /><br />Update Sept 7 2018: still going strong being used for archery elk hunt. No tears<br /> My tent has been replaced with a 5lb sleeping bag, tarp,  game bags, 3 days canned food, small cook stove and fuel can, accessories, 3 liter water bladder, and a bit more. Oh and off the belt hangs a heavy ruger super Blackhawk 8&#34; barrel. All in all about 60lbs or a bit more. Heavy to pack for days but unbeatable performance for great price."
5.0,I love these and so does everyone else I have made jewelry for out of them!
5.0,"Good quality, can’t beat the price, fits well although does cling a bit."
5.0,"What's NOT to love? The pants worked miracles.  They are soft, well made, and fits like a glove. If you need some pants that holds it all in, purchase them!"
5.0,Really liked the colors!
5.0,It's just what I expected.  The tail is long enough to sit without showing..  The fabric is nice and substantial enough not to show through.<br />I had been looking for tops for a while.  This one worked.
5.0,"My wife said order it.  I did. When she got it, she put it on and said, “ just what I wanted”.  She’s happy with it, so got 5 stars from me."
5.0,"Absolute perfection! I am a big guy with with huge athletic calves. I wear a size 12 shoe. These socks fit PERFECTLY. I have tried several other brands that were all too small and too tight. However, these 2xl - 3xl are just right. They cover my entire calf and provide just the right amount of compression. Easy on and easy off. Just try them. You will not be disappointed."
5.0,This hat fit as expected and it is adorable on my daughter.
5.0,Great material used to make shirt. Doesn’t shrink
5.0,I was super skeptical about buying this because you know how it goes when it comes down to plus size clothing from brands you’ve never heard of.<br /><br />when i opened the package i was super hesitant because of how small it looked. But the elastic holds true and it fit great! I wear a 2x and i’m a 42DD.
5.0,Fits a little big from the top but im very skinny so it makes sense.
5.0,This was my very first time ordering clothing off of Amazon. I was very impressed about the quality and fit. I wore this dress to an all white party and it was so comfortable and fit perfectly. It does has a deep v cut in the chest area so I would reccomend using clothing tape so your bra is not exposed and also some black spanx/shaper like shorts or tights underneath to prevent your underwear or underwear lining to show. With this type of material (bodycon style) thong like underwear may still show.
5.0,"Light weight yet serves the purpose. It is cute and durable as well, use it after showers and when not wanting to be dressed"
5.0,Love them they hold up very nice and look nice on my daughter's feet. I'm very pleased
5.0,"Was pleased to read the reviews on it, they were great so I ordered this item. My experience with it was the same if not better. BIG thumbs up! Definitely plan to order more."
5.0,"She loves them.  Wear well.  This is her 3rd pair,  She outgrows them before they wear out,"
5.0,Nice cap...odd pre wear spots on the bill but still a nice well made cap!
5.0,My mom loved it it was just as advertised
5.0,A little bigger than I expected. Bought for my 6 yr old granddaughter so I think she will have to save them until she is older.
5.0,"Love it!  Colors pretty, fits my watch well. Seems sturdy enough.  Quite long, but I have a small wrist, so I just fold it back."
5.0,Perfect. I adore!!!
5.0,I have two real and two fake...wear them all together all the time...looks great
5.0,"This is a gorgeous scarf. Even nicer than the picture, it is perfect for every day or dressing up.  Goes with so many things. Feels heavenly! Love it!"
5.0,I make my cleaning supplies as well as cosmetics. These bottles work well and the dark blue glass while pretty also protect the Essential Oils from light. So much better than plastic.
5.0,These fit my 8 year old perfectly and she looks adorable. They have help up for months so I'm impressed with their durability. They come with an adorable case and cleaning cloth as well.
5.0,"Fits great, super soft & comfortable."
5.0,As described. Good Transaction.
5.0,"Haven't worn them yet, but I like the way they look. Perfect size...not too small and not too big."
5.0,"Great product, my daughter loved it"
5.0,"I am 5'7"", 130lbs and the small fit perfectly. It's a beautiful dress and I love it. I got wine red but I am considering purchasing more colors. I bought for a company holiday party but would wear to a wedding or even just for a night out. It's perfect!"
5.0,Very pretty and light and easy!
5.0,"Beautiful and substantial, looks great, intricate design"
5.0,Love This Skirt but sizing appears to be inconsistent with my other FIVE school skirts. It appears to run a bit large for a small.  I own several Skhoop skirts and have had no issues with sizing.  This particular one runs large.
5.0,"The auto tilt feature is the best thing about this umbrella! Overall it feels like good quality but the poke is fairly lightweight so time will tell how well it holds up. It’s on a very windy SW corner of the house. I just lost my previous umbrella in a wind storm when it fell on a planter and snapped in half due to a broken plastic lever cover. This umbrella doesn’t appear to have plastic parts, but it is a foot larger and dwarfs my patio set however I’ve been planning to get a larger set anyway due to the pandemic since we do a lot more outdoors. I have ordered a larger square base for it and am excited to see how it holds up to wind. It does have a vent in the top which should help. Because my stone patio already is half shaded by the large maple tree in summer, this will be most useful mornings and noon and less useful during the late afternoon and evening due to friction with the tree branches but as you can see here because of the tilt action I was still able to shade one spot during the late evening with a bit of maneuvering around the tree. My previous umbrella was black and white striped so I do wish this came in that color combo. This was a slightly bold color choice yet it’s a sophisticated red and more muted not rust but more brick red. It goes well with some lumbar pillows I have and I’ll update my post if and when I add the new dining set for scale. The canvas on this umbrella appears very sturdy. I have a cover for it to prevent fading and hope it will last for years to come although this time I’ll probably lay it down or put it in the shed during wind storms."
5.0,Super comfy and cute.  I only wish they had more colors.
5.0,"I love that I have the option to mix match these socks, they don’t fit like cotton but more like spandex, they are stretchy but are really comfortable, and I love that they are just above the ankle!!"
5.0,"Always happy with a Procella umbrella purchase! When I get a discount, I jump on it. Buy these for family members and have at least one inside the car and by the front door."
5.0,These shorts fit great! They worked really well for the triathlon I purchased them for.
5.0,"The necklace arrived in tip-top shape and was everything I expected!  Next time I need a mathematical necklace, I will know where to shop.  Keep up the good work!"
5.0,I've had this watchband on my Samsung smartwatch for over a year now absolutely love it it has gotten a little stretched out because I wear it constantly in the shower swimming sleeping sleeping so it's about time to replace but I cannot complain it's quite dirty after wearing it for a year though
5.0,Es hermoso tal como se describe
5.0,"Would buy again! Very very happy with this purchase!! They have great tummy control...<br />i am 5'8"" 150 lbs and the s/m fit great! Very high quality for the price!"
5.0,Very durable. Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,This was the perfect gift. It is of really good quality and holds more than it looks.
5.0,Pretty and perfect.... I love the colors size and shape....
5.0,"I bought the small size, it fits exactly how I want. Snug around my waist and behind and just a little loose around my thighs.  If you like a looser fit and you’re taller, get a medium.<br />I’m 5’3” and about 140 lbs.<br />Very stretchy, comfortable and with tummy control."
5.0,Both my girls love this jacket.
5.0,I ordered one for me and my mom. Super pretty and looks exactly like it does in the picture. Great quality.
5.0,Works perfect for the snow. I put a jacket underneath as well and used this more for water proof. But it is a great jacket! My son loves it.
5.0,"Light weight, beautiful, elegant"

5.0,Great bargain. Looks expensive and husband just loves them.
5.0,i bought this product for someone else and she loved it. And she said i fit perfect
5.0,Glasses are awesome! Took to the ocean and could see the sea life so clear beneath the surface others couldn't! Great product
5.0,Got these glasses a few days ago and they’re amazing. The style is great and go with many different outfits. I like how I can wear something simple yet when I put these on it makes me look really edgy and cool.
5.0,My son loves this shirt..Thanks
5.0,Love these running shoes
5.0,Cami fits true to size. Layers well.
5.0,A very warm and well made hat that can be pulled down to cover your ears or worn as a slouchie beanie. The fur lining held up in the wash great. I have curly short hair and always get compliments when I wear this. I would recommend it you want a sturdy thick hat rather than the super thin style.
5.0,Love the tunic. Very well made and can be worn with so many different bottoms. So glad I purchased  it.
5.0,"love the look, good quality and great price point."
5.0,When it arrived it looked exactly as it was described and pictured here.  It's very pretty and a great quality.  Would purchase again for a gift.  :)

5.0,Very stylish & durable.
5.0,Very comfortable and like being able to walk outside in them because the sole isn’t cloth.
5.0,"I bought these for my husband because he has been looking at some, and I did not want him to spend $50 on something he would lose within a couple hours. These gloves were inexpensive and they are so durable! I tried them on and they are wonderful. Heavy duty, and inexpensive. This is your best option! And the quality was really comparable to a similar pair we seen for $50. I am overall VERY pleased with them and my husband wore them around the house just to look cool. He loves them too!<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,I love the length and they fit perfect. Very comfy.
5.0,Love them!  Great quality and very durable!
5.0,"Beautiful! I LOVE the floral print on this suit! The colors are vibrant and beautiful. The quality if the material us nice. It came in a pretty reusable bag, Im goibg to use it for makeup. The fit us true to description. I purchased the 4xl and am a US size 16/18."
5.0,Looks just like the picture! Love them!
5.0,"These glasses, especially the yellow tinted clip-on for night driving, work very well.<br />I'm glad I bought them."
5.0,"Really comfy! Sometimes I forget this mask is around my neck sometimes, and it's very useful when your going out in cold weather, especially when you have to walk from the bus from school in the freezing cold.<br /><br />This mask can fit any head shape so don't worry about the size trust me don't. If you do you might miss a good product because I was worried this wouldn't fit but it did to my suprise I would recommend to anyone getting annoyed by the weather and needs something to cover your face"
5.0,"It's got room for way more cards than I carry, and a separate side area for cash which is totally useful when shopping, The front windows show your license, ID, family photos, totally worth the money, I love it!"
5.0,Perfect timing and fit
5.0,"I bought the personalized onesie for my grandson and the quality was better than I had hoped for. The material was thick, the color bright and the name and number were not cheaply added on. Overall it is a great item at a great price."
5.0,"Ordered this for my grandma. She needed a bag clear bag for work that was sturdy, and this definitely surpassed expectations. Good quality material."
5.0,I stopped buying pocket squares at dept started a year or so ago (for $20-$25 each)<br /><br />These packs are great values for a fraction of the cost. 10 for the price of 1 and they are good quality
5.0,"look nice, bought as gift"
5.0,It’s nice umbrella with this price. It’s easy to manage and handle.
5.0,These literally feel like they were made for my breasts. They fit so snug but not tight. The straps stay in place and the loosest hook is comfy. The navy grey color is my favorite!
5.0,Great Sunglasses! Great fit!
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like these sunglasses. I have a very wide head and so I have a hard time finding sunglasses that are not tight. These fit perfectly. I was also very concerned about purchasing sunglasses online without trying them on first but they are so cute!
5.0,"Loved this dress! I wanted a casual wedding dress and this was perfect! I received several compliments and was extremely comfortable! I would recommend this dress :) purchased size S, I weigh 128lbs size A32 in bust and I am 5’3”"
5.0,I bought two of these for my 8 & 10 yr old boys. They fit perfect and don't even use a towel anymore! Less laundry and my kids aren't running naked through the hallways for undies anymore.... win win!!!
5.0,the material is a bit thin but overall it is a great shirt.
5.0,"This set is so cute!  I love unicorns and the color purple, so I could not pass this up.  My daughter is 9 months old, today, and this is the first time I dressed her in it.  I purchased the 18 Months size.<br />Both onesies are a tad long in the body, as I expected, but not overly so.  The sleeves on the long sleeved gray one need to be rolled up a couple times, which I also expected.  The pants actually fit her pretty well.  They are only slightly long and I don't need to roll them up.<br /><br />I'm so glad I could get this and that it's something she can grow into, so she can wear it for a while.  I posted pictures of her in the gray bodysuit and pants."
5.0,"Good quality, solid"
5.0,"Honolulu Jewlrey are awesome, finally crafted with exquisite detail. A must to give your Girlfriend and/or Wife. You can’t loose and only receive praise of love!❤️"
5.0,Great shirt for the price! Wish there were more colors. Very soft flowing fabric easy to move in or relax. Color is as specified.
5.0,Very pretty ! Nice option for dressing up !
5.0,"Perfect fit of all my stuff: large wallet, large phone, keys, and all the other little stuff like lipstick, pocketknife, etc that ladies like to have on hand. I don't like my bags huge, but I want it big enough to fit my stuff and not be stuff ed to the rim. Extremely happy with my purchase."
5.0,Variety. The stone plugs were not verry close in color
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet! I've looked for something like this for years, and it just popped up on my Facebook feed one day. I love it!"
5.0,"Skeptical about what these would look like but my 12 yr old loves these.  Nice earrings overall, would purchase again."
5.0,Very beautiful! Fits well and isn't heavy.
5.0,"Two pairs in a package! This is a very specific color of mint and it matches my tennies perfectly. As long as they keep making them, I will probably be buying them. I have a chihuahua that has a fetish for shoe laces...."
5.0,"Bought it as a gift for my husband and he loved it. Looks expensive, would confuse it with a high quality watch. The leather band feels good and it did come with battery. Once he put it on xmas day he has not taken it off."
5.0,Great cap. I get compliments like thank you for your service.
5.0,These were perfect for what I needed and look good - fit my thin wrists well and the magnetic clasp makes it easy to get on and off.  Received them quickly.
5.0,"This just came in the mail today really fast shipping! For reference, I got a Large. I am 5'7 and it's right below the knee which is perfect, The Chest fits great (34D) but the waist is a little big which isn't uncommon for me, but it looks amazing on. There also was a free gift!!"
5.0,The fabric is stretchy and very comfortable
5.0,"This was bought as a gift, and it was absolutely perfect.  The cuff is a lovely blue with accented braiding.  The clasp is magnetic and the cuff stays on very nicely.  Would definitely recommend this to others."
5.0,"I bought these boots for myself in brownbut this pair I bought as a gift and she absolutely loves them!! She cried a little. She wears a 7 and these were a 6.5 and fit like a dream so they run a little big. Also, I wear a 9 normally but purchased the 8.5 and again they fit like a dream! Definitely worth it. They keep my feet warm"
5.0,Awesome! Nice quality leather. Adds class to my watch for a great price! Fits nicely and secure.
5.0,"This was a perfect, well-made item for a Halloween costume. However, it will be cute to get some attention by wearing it out to the supermarket this winter!"
5.0,"These help both with sleep issues if worn in the artificial light of night time inside, and evening computer use. They help a lot if I get a headache, relieving some of the pain of light sensitivity."
5.0,Simple splendid 🥰
5.0,"From the moment I opened it you could tell it was it was well built. You want to be OCD in your organization you can, you want to keep water from getting hot after hiking all day you can, it has so many attachment points I don't think I have enough gear to attach to them all. The stitching is heavy, the zippers are tough with molded zipper handles, this bag is adjustable to almost any size it's my new BoB"
5.0,Arrived promptly in good condition.  Looks just like advertised.
5.0,"I’ve had these sandals for a few years and I love them. I wish they were still available. It’s so hard finding sandals that are comfortable, so when I do, I want them in various colors. I take them with me to the Caribbean every year when I plan on doing a lot of walking. I don’t have a backup so I hope these sandals will continue to last. Please bring these back!!!"
5.0,I thought it would be too tight after washing.  It was still in good shape.  I absolutely love this item and will order more.  The comfort level is off the charts.  I highly recommend this.
5.0,This dress is comfortable and lightweight. It fits exactly like I expected. The bow looks good in the front and the back! The best part? You can wear a sports bra and nothing shows!
5.0,Bought to put phone in while walking.  Use like a fanny pack that is not bulky and ugly.
5.0,"This watch looked great out of the box, was easy to set, and is very easy to read.  The face is larger than other watches, but it isn't bulky and appears to have a similar height above the wrist to most other watches.  I liked the band that it came with as it seems tough enough for every day use as dose the stainless steel watch itself although I have a new band to use with this one.  I prefer analog watches and this watch is a very good deal for the price."
5.0,"I get compliments whenever I wear this dress.  It's easy to wear, comfortable, and can be dressed up or down with accessories."
5.0,My son uses these for his grocery store job. He really likes them. I’ve already purchased 4 boxes. I also appreciate that you will deliver to an Amazon locker.

5.0,I bought this bracelet for my wife's birthday and she absolutely loves it. A stylish quality item at an affordable price.
5.0,"I love this apple band. It's stretchy, almost like a spandex material, and super comfortable. I would say that it's for a smaller wrist. I'm an adult female & it fits me fine."
5.0,I got this for a Halloween costume and actually like it as a dress! But this amazing blue dress will get its first outing with a set of devil horns! :)
5.0,LOVE this leather bag!!👍❤️
5.0,Gave to my wife to match a ring we had custom made looks great like they were both custom made. Small chain though. Dainty length is fine.

5.0,"The shirt arrived on time and packaged appropriately! The quality of ""The Good Life"" shirts are great!  It fit my grandson perfectly."

5.0,I have gotten so many compliments on this necklace and I love it!
5.0,Husband ordered for me
5.0,Nice quality and beautiful design... But the size is kinda small...
5.0,"I have a bigger key fob (2015 jeep cherokee) and it fits perfectly. I took apart my keys (grocery cards, keys, and key fob) and put my key fob in one side and cards and keys on the other side. It takes up more room in my pocket but it's nice to clip it on my belt loop and not have anything jingling."
5.0,BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT FOR SUMMER ATTIRE!!!
5.0,Loved it true to size
5.0,"My husband bought me these for Valentine's Day this year, they are very cute, nice and lightweight, and just geeky enough to make me smile!<br />I love these earrings and plan on wearing them often."
5.0,". I love that the straps are adjustable, and because of the “kerchief” like hemline, I feel this dress would look great on women of many different heights. It is also super flattering around the bust area, without showing too much. I bought the red polka dot one and it is pretty spot on to Minnie Mouse colors."
5.0,Great light sunglasses
5.0,"Daughter is 8 and got a size 8... and this fits exactly to the floor on her. She’s between 42-43” tall. So pretty! Looks just like in the picture. Great quality fabric, especially the sleeves. Was expecting it to be cheaper made because of the price but it’s perfect."
5.0,It is quite cute.
5.0,"I only received it today. Although it doesnt have the contrast white stitching for me personally, Im glad it didn't. Its a great size."
5.0,They are a nice looking pair of glasses. I'm not too sure about them being polarized though.
5.0,It's just like the photo. Very cute on my grandbaby!
5.0,Love it. Looks great. Wear it all the time.
5.0,Put a few together & they look really nice
5.0,"I loved these, but I dropped them and one of the eye pieces fell out :("
5.0,Very pretty and nicely packed. I love
5.0,Great jacket for rainy days or a light warm. I like the way you can tuck the hat part under the collar with the Velcro & pockets on the sides & inside too. The draw strings for the hood & sides are a plus too. The only negative thing was the arms were a bit long.
5.0,"this is my 3rd over the years.<br /><br />I like the thin clip and the art motif based on NW Coastal Peoples<br /><br />Durable, never had a clip break, the cloth wears through ( I am rough on stuff).<br /><br />If it gets stinky, drop it in a glass with denture cleaner overnight"
5.0,"Best boots ever had on my life, very good quality and 100% leather. Safety toe is perfect and lighter. I highly recommend this oil resistant work boots.! Thank you!"
5.0,Love these shirts! Soft durable and cute
5.0,"Bought these for a British friend of mine as kind of a gag gift. NSE likes them and for the price, they're actually not that bad!"
5.0,"very light weight, a somewhat trim fit, not baggy, large enough for layers underneath, apparent high quality construction, sleeves have elastic at cuffs without velcro.  have not tested in rain."
5.0,I bought this for my daughter for a Christmas gift.<br />It was very well made and very cute.<br />She loves it!
5.0,"Love these, I get so many compliments"
5.0,Valued jewelry. Perfect design.
5.0,"Colors are wonderful. Bought this pretty blouse with a code for a substantial savings ( $20/$12). I ordered 2 colors. Sadly, I was sent 2 of the same size & color. I sent 1 back & the other is now out of stock. So because of a boo boo on someone’s part, I can’t get the other blouse. ☹️"
5.0,"Received yesterday, fits nicely and looks good. I will see in a few days how it works on the nagging neck pains."
5.0,There's nothing I didn't like about the shirt.
5.0,These earrings are beautiful.  I would definitely get another gift like this.  My daughter loves them.  Nicer than they look on the screen.
5.0,"The cup size is perfect for me and the fitting is very nice. The measurements they have on your site are very accurate. Make sure to measure before purchasing. The colors are very nice. It's very comfortable to wear and be in for a while. The padding in the suit is very nice as well. There are not real negatives with this suit other than it does have a lot cut on the back where you have quite a bit of your cheeks showing. I'm one to want more coverage, but if you prefer less coverage, this is great for you then. I did receive this product at a discount or for free for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"I am 5' 4&quot; and 131 pounds with a 36&quot; bust and hip and 31&quot; waist.  I looked at the sizes and ordered the large.  This seemed to fit a little larger than the page indicates.  I found the top neckline and black material to be a little too dominating.  However, the dress pattern is beautiful.  I love the pink and cream flowers with the black material.  I think if I had a bit more of a bust, this would have been super flattering.  Perhaps I need to get a new bra or something to help this dress shape up a little better.  I have a petticoat that I will definitely try with this dress.  I love the vintage 50s look and it is a super sweet and classic look.  Unfortunately, my bust makes it a little bit of a bust.  I don't fault the dress though.  The dress is well made and it's very lovely, just as it's pictured.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. When reviewing, I consider the full price and evaluate the product's usefulness and/or quality. When I find that something breaks or malfunctions after further testing, I do update my reviews accordingly."

5.0,"What a great dress.  It came quickly (which is why I picked it as I needed it within two days.)  I wore it for a 50's party and received many compliments.  It was well made and I could easily wear it again for a wedding or party.  I did order the tutu slip which added to the &#34;fun.&#34;  However, I would not use the slip if I was wearing it for a regular event."
5.0,Grandson loves the books!!!  So got the sweatshirt. He loves it !!!!!
5.0,I'm always happy with Jeanne Pierre sweaters.  And this one is no different. Good heavy sweater of good quality and it's very pretty.  I just wish Amazon carry more of them!

5.0,"I love these hats. (I purchased three) because they are wool, they keep my head very warm and I have had no problem with it blowing off my head. I walk my dogs every day and the weather is getting very cold. I never leave the house without my Biddy hat."
5.0,The picture does not show how beautiful it is. I love it.

5.0,Super fast free shipping. I ordered them Thursday morning and they were in my mail box when I got home on Friday afternoon. They do take a little work to position just right but I love the way they look. I wore them over the weekend and received several compliments.

5.0,I use it as a purse. It carries everything I need and it's cute and convenient.

5.0,"These are amazing leggings. I am 5’2 and 123lbs, I bought a small but could have gone with an extra small because they length is longer than expected and also loose at the ends, but this product fits well in all other areas. I plan to buy in other colors!"

5.0,I like how you can  tighten it up and the material is super breathable way better than N95 Masks
5.0,Buena medida.

5.0,Very tight but comfortable and reduces swelling
5.0,Very comfortable true to size.  I love how soft they’re.
5.0,This is my third time buying these.  Other compression socks were so tight I had trouble getting them on.  These are tight but not that tight.  They did last a long time but eventually the heels wore through.  That was after an acceptably long time with heavy use.
5.0,Fit perfect and the art work on it was bigger than I expected but I love the shirt.
5.0,"About the pink top, black skirt option: Great business outfit! Looks amazing with tall heels and stockings. Because it's all one piece, you never get the shirt pulling up and showing stuff it shouldn't. The overhang of the pink top completely hides the fact that it's all one piece. Bombproof outfit looks great all day because it is Sewn Together, and impossible to dishevel. Thick cottony fabric. I am completely satisfied."
5.0,It is of great quality. The size is average. Love the colors but best of all the quality of the material is great. Very good finish on the edge. I bought more!!! I would highly recommend it!

5.0,"Nicely made swimsuit. I typically buy a small, but ordered a medium and it fits perfectly."
5.0,"The original band was giving me dermatitis, so I switched to this. It's cute and durable. I haven't worked out with this band, so I can't speak to odor retention, but I've worn it 24/7 for the past few months and it doesn't smell like anything."
5.0,I'm very pleased with the craftsmanship and was surprised by the gift which was very nice.
5.0,Keeps the air flow out of my eyes and there’s room for my glasses! Great googles.

5.0,my niece loved this
5.0,Nice one !
5.0,"I’m really liking these shoes... it’s winter in NE Ohio, so I’m wearing them inside the house & have no fit or comfort issues.<br />I’m usually size 9.5 or 10 & got these in size 10 & they’re just right. So I’d say size up if you’re between sizes.<br />Both straps are adjustable, not just faux buckles & that helps a lot with getting the right fit.<br /><br />The memory foam padding under my feet feels good & I’m getting the custom indentations each time I wear them.<br />At a little over $25, these are a good value for how sturdy they feel & how cute they look!<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this & hope that it’s Helpful!)"
5.0,I really like the quality of this product.  Got a lot of compliments.

Really comfortable and soft material but mostly my son wants to wear it constantly because it is basically a firefighter costume that works as pjs and thus gets him to go to sleep (mommy and child both happy = success)!  The reasonable price is also appreciated.  I will note that my son is on the small side.  But the fit is perfect for him"
5.0,I have this same dress in black so I knew I was getting a perfect fit. This dress is great!
5.0,"This dress is GORGEOUS!  I am a choir director and I wore it for our Easter production.  Everyone had a fit over it.

I'm 5'4&#34; and about 150.  I got a Medium.  Perfect!!!"
5.0,Great mask just as discribed
5.0,"Love them! Wanted strap on vans for the longest time, but couldn’t find them anywhere. They are comfortable even for wide feet. I ordered a size 5 in kids for me because I have small fit and fit just fine."
5.0,Using this for a photo booth. Fits perfectly
5.0,I love that this looks like a more expensive watch and it’s bargain priced.
5.0,Awesome quality. Recently purchased a car that doesnt require a key I need to pull out of my purse so this is perfect to keep the key protected in my purse. My key is fairly large and still fits great. All of my other keys also got perfectly in the second side. Highly recommend!
5.0,Bought this for a birthday gift .. she absolutely loves it and so did everyone else
5.0,"This watch band, even though I do not currently use it as it does not go with the color scheme of the watch I bought it for, it is of fantastic quality and I would reccommend it to anyone with a Swatch that uses this model of band."

5.0,It's magical to deal with the stain on your sneakers.
5.0,Girlfriend loved how it flowed and the color is right on point.
5.0,My baby girl loved
5.0,The quality is better then I thought considering the price and I get two.  Would totally buy again.

5.0,Good quality shoulder bag thank you
5.0,"CUTE, good quality"
5.0,"These are so cute!  Although I was expecting something a little smaller, these aren't exactly giant earrings.  I've had so many compliments on them.  Very comfortable and light to wear."
5.0,Striking! Very versatile. Can be worn with a sweater or against the skin.
5.0,"I have bought two other types of the scarf  from other companies and found this one the best as the pocket is much larger and therefore more room for a passport. The fabric is also very soft. I highly recommend this product above all the other scarves of this type Amazon sells. It is such a clever idea to be able to put your phone ,passport ,drivers license ,keys etc. whatever and going for walks or traveling on planes etc.  Great for sightseeing to."
5.0,Loved the look.
5.0,Love the sticky feet! My daughter no longer slides around when trying to walk and wear tights
5.0,"Very unique watch band. Fit perfectly, lots of compliments!"
5.0,She loved it! Perfect birthday gift.
5.0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them.
5.0,"Huge hit gift. Super excited kids. Immediately put on the crocs! Seem to be the same quality as other charms we've purchased, so all good."
5.0,I love this style of dress. It is a loose flowy fit and so if you want a more fitted dress then you should go one size down. I weigh 170 and my height is 5'4. According to my measurements they recommended a size medium but I purchased a small because I wanted a more fitted dress and I still had a lot of space. The dress came a couple of inches above my knee. I will be wearing this dress with leggings and I can't wait!
5.0,Dress was beautiful but unfortunately it did not fit. They gave a full refund and let me keep the dress. I give them an A+++ for that.
5.0,These are great cover ups but the quality is super-thin.  They are beautiful but I wish the crochet yarn was just a bit thicker to provide more shape.  I am still happy with my purchase though.
5.0,Nice looking bands. Very good quality.
5.0,"The band fit my new Fitbit Charge 4 very well. The band is what I expected and is very comfortable. The band comes in one size, so check before purchasing."
5.0,Great lounge pants! just wish they had pockets.
5.0,These are as described.. they are the right size and they have a beautifully sparkle ..love them.. wearing on my wedding day..
5.0,I love the design and color of my ring however it is too large to fit any of my fingers including my thumb but luckily I have a ring guard to put around it.  Other than that it's a beautiful ring and I'm glad to have gotten it.
5.0,"great quality for the money. I have gotten tons of compliments on this dress. Its very lightweight and the length was perfect for me. im 5'7, 170 pounds and the Medium fit great!"
5.0,"I got this for my 8 year old granddaughter who loves dresses but is very active.  She was able to wear this dress and still do cartwheels without exposing herself.  She is smaller for her age so these leggings were kind of big on her but otherwise, really nice."
5.0,"great strap, looks expensive and solid! I straped it to my red Longchamp to give it a twist, and it looks GREAT! Colors true to picture too.<br />Would definetly recommend :)"
5.0,"These are so adorable. My daughter (2 years old) actually kept them on so, I’m assuming they were comfortable :)"
5.0,The hat is oaky.
5.0,I am crazy about these!! Fit perfect! Comfortable- They don't bulk up when I wear boots!!!!!
5.0,Got this for our granddaughter for part of her Halloween outfit.
5.0,These ear muffs are great!
5.0,The dress is very flattering.  The belt allows you to adjust to accentuate your waistline based on your body type.  The fabric is good for spring/summer.  I will definitely dry clean to make certain the color doesn't fade.
5.0,Finally a product that keeps my glasses clear when waring a mask.
5.0,Looks beautiful. Very durable. I highly recommend!
5.0,wear it all the time!
5.0,They are perfect for my wedding party!!
5.0,LOOOVE IT! Its a good size and fits everything I need and more. The side pockets fit my 27 oz bottle but snuggly. It’s not big deal because I’ve been carrying it in the inside. Definitely recommend the bag
5.0,Love it! Even more beautiful in person and for a great price! Sparkles nicely in the sunlight and fits better than expected.
5.0,Looks great in my truck
5.0,I like the warmth of the slipper. And they’re very comfortable.
5.0,"Thank you, looked as expected."
5.0,It’s worth the money and I would definitely pay again
5.0,I was so looking for a crossbody bag just like this one. The size is perfect and the colors. I don't have complaints about it.<br />This won't be the last time I buy one.
5.0,"It is bigger and heavier than I expected, but it is very good.<br />I really like the ""rope"" like style. It is about 3/8"" thick.<br />The only negative thing I found was the end of the links are not tight to each other and are sharp. Though the ends are inside of other links, when the chain bends certain ways they can catch and tear things, but not easily. The ends should be rounded off.<br />Overall I am very happy with the quality of the chain."
5.0,Fantastic Umbrella the biggest thing for me is how it works getting in and out of a car.  Can't go wrong
5.0,"I love flannel pajamas, and these are super soft. A little on the thin side, which is what I was looking for because I also have flannel sheets and I want to be able to move around and be comfortable in my sleep.<br /><br />I made a mistake the first time ordering (I forgot to pick a size), but the return was nearlyeffortless and very quick. Thinking of getting another pair or two in different colors."
5.0,This bracelet looks exactly like the picture.  Very beautiful and elegant. I really like it!
5.0,This purchase was a three for one! I  love that you can wear them individually or layer them up. My son wore one and i  wore the other &#60;3 no need to spend hundreds on something he’ll break or lose
5.0,Not clingy nice thickness looks great
5.0,My daughter has put these hats through the ringer and they’re holding up so well!

5.0,"These fit well and swem to be very well compared to less expensive brands. And heck, made in USA!"
5.0,Great purchase!  Bracelet was slightly longer than expected.
5.0,I love this top. It fits as expected and is soft. It is very comfortable and I am thinking of buying another in a different colour.
5.0,"I love my Terra tops; they fit wonderfully well and look terrific with leggings.  The colors are varied and can mix and match across my wardrobe.  Their high collars are especially flattering; plus with the loose fit, I can easily layer.  This one has a different neckline and is a nice addition to the wardrobe!"
5.0,Some arrived broken but it’s an easy fix. They’re so pretty !!!
5.0,"Not any carrying  chest back more happy than this one, well build, excellent design, light weight, perfect look, definitely will continue shopping  for this name brand product."
5.0,Nice fluffy slipper. Bottom is hard plastic type.
5.0,This was a few of the gifts for future sorority sisters.
5.0,"I ride in sunny california, and having a visor is a must. I left mine in my trunk that went back to WA, so I needed one for down here. I was pleased to see that this visor has a sticky rim that helps keep it steady while I'm jumping. This visor give me shade on my face and neck and not only protects against sunburning, but alway keeps me much cooler, as well as keeping the sun out of my eyes. I've even seen someone wearing one over their bicycle helmet. Great idea."
5.0,Super cute! Just what i wanted!
5.0,"I love walking outside in the winter.  This set is going to make it so much better than the average hat and scarf. I always struggle with a scarf to stay on place, but this type of scarf while it slips a little, it is so easy to put back in place. Nice thickness for warmth without sweating. So cute too!"
5.0,it was perfect  I really love  it

5.0,"Nice scarf, exactly like the picture. It’s soft and warm."

5.0,cutest socks ever true to size quick delivery great customer service
5.0,"I was having trouble with sunglasses and clear face shields fogging up and making it hard to see when wearing a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic. I thought I'd only wear Toasty Cat's sun visor for fun because it looks like a Daft Punk robot helmet, but the functionality turned out to be no joke! It provides as much sun protection as my sunglasses and doesn't fog up at all when paired with a face mask. I like the blue drawstring backpack it comes with. I use the protective black cover it comes with and have tried to be careful with it but it's surprisingly sturdy and has held up well against a few falls on the ground (no scratches) and being packed and smooshed into an overstuffed bag. The headband is comfy, although it isn't as smooth as I expected to pull the shield up and down. But it turns out that's useful because it locks in the desired position and holds up to wind well without flapping up and down. It makes me feel a little safer from the virus when paired with a CDC-recommended face mask and from sun damage (when paired with sunscreen). And I have to admit, I was skeptical of the concept of a privacy mask, but it does look pretty cool and mysterious."
5.0,Very quick shipping and great quality!
5.0,"Beautiful,comfortable, and well made!"
5.0,Amazing dress! Absolutely loved it!
5.0,"I love them. Too big for my 1 year old right now (I got size 1-3 years). So they definitely run towards the larger size. They have an unpleasant smell out of the package. But this goes away after the first wash. They are a durable material, soft, and comfortable."

I had been looking for the RIGHT mini bag for a long time that I went to a local boxed store and another online store and purchased a total of 3 which were returned. Another was kept and given away right after receiving this one. Hope they will last a little while."
5.0,"For the price, I’ve now purchased 5 of them in various patterns. I’m 5’2, 165 lbs and the large hits perfect. The solid color dresses are not the same material as the patterned ones. I get so many compliments on these at the office. Great for curvy figures"

5.0,"Nobody Cared who I was until I put on the mask...<br /><br />I've made Bane jokes since the beginning of Covid so when a co-worker dared me to get a bane mask and wear it work work I couldn't resist this. Its a bit overpriced for a singular washable mask, but its decent and the replaceable filter is a nice touch. Though let me say, the filter is NOT washable, I didnt know that and it fell apart in the wash. Luckily replacements are extremely cheap."
5.0,Good on you

5.0,Supreme set of dark gold jewelry. Made very well!

5.0,Nothing much to say other than I love them…
5.0,Bought as a gift. They love it!
5.0,Beautiful earrings just the same as in the picture
5.0,"When our friend asked if we wanted some of her spouse's ashes before they were spread, we said yes! We picked this urn as Deb loved turtles and the ocean. When we had our transfer party , our friend's spouse had the same turtle but in a necklace! Everything came with the urn to be able to make an easy transfer and it holds more than you would think. Deb is now on a hook by the door, we see her and smile every time we get in our RV and we all are enjoying the ride."

5.0,"I absolutely love this dress, I am 5' 5&#34;, 128lb, generally slightly smaller than a size 4. A small in this dress fits like a standard size 4, fits my waist well, I have a small chest, so it's a little loose on the shoulders, but nothing awkward. I got the mild red color/style. It's a very flattering A-line vintage inspired cut, beautiful for a wedding, evening out, or party."
5.0,didn't like the quality of the fabric.
5.0,Great shirt. No problems.
5.0,Stays while in motion

5.0,Ordered a size larger than normal for my brother. He loved it and it fit great

5.0,"Okay, so I just got these along with 2 other pair today.  I love them so friggin much! As far as sizing goes, I am a 5ft 3 woman weighing 125.  These fit slung low on my hips.  If I were to pull them onto my waist they would fall back down to my hips.  They have a nice weight to them and honestly look super cool.  Chances are these will be for at home use, but if I needed to make a quick run into town I would feel fine wearing these."

5.0,"This Men's Survival Gear Bracelet by Steven G is the perfect addition to your emergency bag whether it is for your car, camping, hunting, snowboarding, hiking. It comes in a professional looking pillow gift box that is about 11.75&#34; long. This bracelet would wrap up nicely as a gift for anyone who likes the outdoors or even as an addition to an emergency kit for earthquakes, etc.<br /><br />The bracelet is woven out of an appealing army green color paracord that can be unwound during an emergency. My husband has some black ones but the green is great for the outdoors for camouflage. The end of the bracelet is a strong stainless steel fire starter and cutter. The main bracelet section is about 7&#34; long. With the fire starter/cutter and strap, the whole thing comes out to be about 10.5&#34; long. You can wear this bracelet on your wrist or just keep it tucked in your pocket or bag. It is light weight and doesn't take up much space at all.<br /><br />I ordered this bracelet at a discounted rate for review and testing purposes."
5.0,"Really cute, soft tshirt!"
5.0,so great. definitely recommmend
5.0,Love it! Very flattering to my body type
5.0,"Flattering, good length."
5.0,I ordered this for a Halloween 5K that I will be running in October! I am 5'2 around 150lbs - short and stocky build.

I am very excited to wear it on Halloween!!
5.0,"Awesome LION T-shirt design and the color is very vibrant, also the cotton material is also comfortable to wear, i got this shirt for my husband and so far so good for him and he is loving it!!!"
5.0,"Well this product is simply wonderful.<br />Has lots of space and zippered pockets,fast shipping and very reasonable price.<br />Didn't get it anywhere else except on Amazon."
5.0,I was so pleasantly surprised that this necklace was just as beautiful (perhaps more) in person than in the pictures online.  It was in a lovely little box with a polishing cloth included.  Very pleased with this very reasonably priced necklace!
5.0,Love love this! The fit is cozy and comfortable and can be worn out to run quick errands.
5.0,This is such a fun necklace. I wear it with the matching earrings and have gotten so many compliments. Just wish it had a matching bracelet!!
5.0,"They are good quality and able to fit  a variety of sizes because the nose strap is so flexible. I bought them for a four year old child and we thought they would never fit on first sight because they looked large. They fit him snugly, the suction is good and he does not complain that water gets in under the eye pieces. The  total frame and head strap are soft silicone and comfortable."
5.0,One of my favorite sweaters this season! Love that it matched a ton of different outfit and fits perfect and comfortable.
5.0,"Beautiful fall color! Bag is very roomy and great quality, I've received a lot of complements on it. Would definitely but again!"
5.0,"Well made, I have gotten several compliments"
5.0,"I had very low expectations of these slippers, but my mind was blown when I got them. They're cute and comfortable, and the quality is amazing. They have little suction cups on the bottom to help make sure you don't slip on hard floors. Proof they're good? I rushed and bought 3 more before the sale price changed, but I would still happily buy another one at the $18.99 price.<br /><br />Note: They do run a bit long. I didn't notice an issue because it was still comfortable."
5.0,This is 2nd one I purchased. This one is for friend's birthday. We both love this ring. Size is nice and big.
5.0,Perfect for the sun
5.0,Product was as expected. Very pretty and low cost.
5.0,"Apparently, American extra large is not the same proportion as Asian extra large. Otherwise this is a very nice shirt, made well, great price, fast shipping"
5.0,Made good from original mistake
5.0,"If you're looking for an inexpensive gift that will make someone smile, this is it.  It's not perfect in that the neck may gape a bit if you're small and slim like me, but can't fault the overall value for a fun item."
5.0,Very good quality. Happy with the product. They are adjustable lenght wise but they do not stretch width.
5.0,"Super cute and fits very nicely. I'm 5'3, 157lbs with a 36D. Love how it hangs and a perfect compliment to long earrings. Fits great in my bust area and does a fit-flare higher than my waist, which I love! Thinking of getting more colors!"
5.0,"Great product, arrived fast"
5.0,"I got this for a friend and they LOVE it. It looks exactly as pictured, does not look or feel cheap, and is beyond adorable. BEEHAW."

5.0,"Very pretty, nice quality stones and sterling silver."
5.0,good looking a warm
5.0,"Son realmente hermosos vale la pena el precio,son muy ligeros!👍"
5.0,I have incredibly strict parents. So this was a nice middle ground we were able to meet at lol. My mother was okay with it since it was fake but I’ll get the real one soon hehe
5.0,It's fit great 👍. I bought this to wear it from the hospital after delivery  I still wearing it around the house. Even to go shopping the pants fit like legging but the shirt little bit loose that what I like on it.and it the same after few wash in the washing machine. I like the quality. It's worth the price 👌 2
5.0,"This bag is the perfect travel purse. It fits SO much stuff, like a ridiculous amount. I was able to use it as a purse/diaper bag for my toddler. It fit my wallet and phone of course, a few diapers and wipes, and a change of baby clothes and snacks without feeling too bulky. Highly recommend."
5.0,Very nice boots for the price. Love the fur
5.0,Absolutely love these shoes!!!
5.0,The best masks so far. Breathable and comfortable. The colors are exactly as shown. Size Small fits me and my kids. For a large face adults Medium should be better. I am getting a couple more.
5.0,"These are the most comfortable, great looking dress pants I have ever purchased. Ordering in red next"
5.0,Serves the purpose of not dropping the key fob
5.0,"I have the Scarlet...and I ordered more...like this top,comfortable true to size!"
5.0,My niece loves these shoes she won’t take them off . They are super beautiful
5.0,Price is right and I think this should fit most people.<br />I am 5 foot 9 inches tall with a 50 inch chest and a 37 inch waist.<br /><br />This fits me well with just a shirt underneath or a Gambeson underneath and I still have full mobility.<br /><br />It is kind of like a finger trap in that it just conforms to whatever you put into it.<br /><br />It's butted chainmail so you don't want to use it for actually protecting yourself. But it is perfect for larp and ren fair use.<br /><br />I reccomend this.
5.0,Great girlfriend loves it
5.0,"Love this!  Comfortable, soft but buttons are a little far apart."
5.0,Product is very well manufactured and customer service is definitely consumer oriented.
5.0,I love the Pendleton’s design<br />I like the width of the strap is it comfortable to wear 👏🏽
5.0,"LOVE these shorts!! They're super comfortable, soft, and fit perfectly! Great length and material to wear to the grocery store, to work out, and to lounge around the house. They also have pockets and a drawstring which is very convenient. Bought another pair for a friend who likes to box and squat and she absolutely loves them."
5.0,Looking for different colors as well.  Gets many compliments.
5.0,"Adorable top!  The fit was perfect.  The material is nice, not thin at all.  Great buy!"
5.0,This product is worth every penny; please follow the number rule and leave the keys at home.
5.0,"I LOVE THIS! I bought a large hoping it would be roomy at the top like the photo, and it was! The black isn't, and if the pink is like the black it isn't either. I also got the blue stripe pattern like this one, and it was just as lovely! Too bad the black isn't. Of course the slit is very high. You can wear a thin short skirt under it, or something else you want to wear under it."
5.0,This dress is GORGEOUS! Very please with the color(as some people reviewed that the red was more orange/coral). The red is a rich red. Fabric is great. I’m 230lbs 5’7 14/16 dress size. XL fit perfectly. Shipping was fast as well
5.0,"Awesome shirt, just as described! Already received compliments on it."
5.0,It won't stay on the watch. Not worth using if I risk breaking the watch every time it falls off my wrist.<br /><br />Update:  Seller contacted me and offered a free replacement.  Need one works great and looks awesome as well. Thanks for good customer service!
5.0,Love this dress and get lots of compliments!! Very modest too.
5.0,"The shirt is beautiful and I received tons of compliments. As result, I brought two other colors (red and green). The yellow is more of a mustard gold color and slightly see through. I wore a camisole underneath the yellow and red. The green is not see through. as well as, underneath the red.  I wear a small or a size 3/4 in tops. My bust cup and width size is a 34b cup and I purchased a medium in all three tops. The arms seem alittle snug at first but, by mid-day it was fine. I washed them in delicate cycle and air dried them. The tops looked actually the same after the wash cycle and fit even better. Love This Top..."
5.0,This fits exactly as the size I ordered should.  Very cute and cuddly outfit.
5.0,"this watch band is super cute, light weight, and i absolutely love it! definitely recommend to anyone!"
5.0,The quality of the material was better than expected. Love the way it feels!
5.0,"Perfect fit, excellent color, quality superb,"
5.0,They look really nice! I bought them for my lip because I wasn't sure if I wanted it pierced. They are a tiny bit bigger than what I thought but I can deal with it. I love how they look on my nose and lip but I can't wear them all day because they start to dig into my skin and it hurts a little. They are a great price and I received them much sooner than expected. Overall I am very pleased.
5.0,I was a little concerned with some of the reviews but the pattern we got is a good thick cotton material and it looks great on my daughter. Very pleased
5.0,Great gift and good product
5.0,My grandson loved these footed pajamas. They are soft and comfortable. I ordered the 10-12 size and they are a tad big since his size is 10. He is happy with them and that is what counts.
5.0,Decent quality for price!!
5.0,"Great comfy casual dress! Love the good size pockets to carry stuff around the house when taking care of my kids or go for walk. Lovely back cross decor, so the dress is not too simple."

5.0,Awesome necklace for an awesome price
5.0,Nice and cute and warm
5.0,"Just really like this jacket.  Nice weight that can easily be layered under.  Great pockets, detachable hood, comfortable and quiet.  Purchased quite a few First Lite items this year to give a try, and this is one of my favorites.  I have just about everything in the Sitka Whitetail line, so I'm pretty hard to impress.  Really like this so far after using for five hunts."
5.0,"Top and bottom are super comfortable and soft. Will be great for lounging around the house and as pajamas. Shorts were a little longer than I expected but still look great, can easily roll up if needed!"
5.0,Loving these so far. Color is vibrant and they seem really sturdy. Hope they hold up to the test of time! Stay tied well.

5.0,These cute pins are well-made and well finished… No sharp or rough edges. They are as pictured. The pin back is long enough to go through a strap or heavy fabric and the clip is nice and sturdy. I put them on a cute canvas bag for a friend who loves cats as part of her birthday present… very well received.
5.0,6 pair knee high compression socks :  They fit fine and seem very sturdy .  This is my first time with this brand but very promising.
5.0,This dress is great quality and the fit is perfect. I ended up ordering it in multiple colors. Dress can be worn casual or dressed up more for a night out. Would look great with a belt too.
5.0,Love it.  Exactly what I need for platform tennis in the cold.
5.0,"Love these charms, the quality on them is amazing, they’re the best on the market. Get compliments on them all the time, totally recommend them. 🇯🇵🗼"
5.0,"They are almost a PERFECT match to my necklace!  I'm sure they will be even better once they've &#34;aged&#34; a little more!!  I did change the &#34;shepherd's hook&#34; wires to lever-back, tho.  The open wires fall out of my ears too easily!  Other than that they are EXACTLY what I was looking for!  :-)"
5.0,Lovely.  Washed and no shrinking!  Comfy!
5.0,Love this and looking forward to cooler weather to use!
5.0,I will never order that product again

5.0,After wearing the bracelet for one day I feel a huge difference in the pain that I was having in my wrist the pain is gone away. I wish they made one  this terrible backs that I now suffering with.
5.0,"I don't like hats that are not flexible and is like a bill board...you know what i'm talking about. The mesh is soft and not crunchy. The other hat material forms to your head like you've worn it in the rain.  If you like a low profile hat, with the best emblem in the chainsaw world, it's time to get yourself one...or two!"
5.0,Bought it for my son who is a volunteer Firefighter.  He loves it!
5.0,"Love these. I haven't been a faithful sunglass wearer, which has led to early cataracts (live in Arizona)!. My doctor said I need to wear sunglasses everytime I leave the house to slow the progression. I wear glasses and can't afford prescription sunglasses, and these fit perfectly."
5.0,"This wristlet is perfect in every way! Lots of room while still remaining relatively thin; The perfect shade of matte gold (I hate super sparkly stuff!); and VEGAN! Just doesn't get better. The product arrived promptly and neatly packaged. The seller is very kind, too! I will definitely continue to make purchases from Humble Chic!"
5.0,"Looks great , feels great. Color is perfect."
5.0,Very good for gifting them.
5.0,Looks like a shirt with a jacket
5.0,They wash up nicely and are durable!
5.0,"Got a toy ring from else where and thought it was this so I'm changinging my review. The ring is lovely and the right size. IDK how it will wear over time but it is very pretty ad looks nicely made. Would buy again for 5.99+ prime free ship. Good job on the ring. Amazon delivery is horrid. They threw the paper package in the lawn. We have a mail box that could have fit it RIGHT there and my package was NOT hand delivered as noted, which is why I'm glad the packaged items were so well wrapped. The ring came in a plastic bag in a velvet pouch in a plastic bag which I appreciate. THANKS to the packager, not so much the delivery, but yes do buy this ring, it's nice. Stainless steel and CZ are going to act as a re-marriage stand in ring, so I hope mum likes it to go with Dads Real deal ring for her.She loses jewelry like crazy so this is great. Thank you."
5.0,"I primarily wear skirts and have bought several dozen from Amazon but this skirt is, by far, the best quality. My others have all faded, the elastic waist stretched out of shape and trims falling off. The waist on this is a tad small but I can wear it without my waist feeling cinched in. Overall I am very pleased with this skirt."
5.0,Purchased this tote for a specific use and have used it for everthing else since receiving.  Love the zippered top and the outside pocket.  I have several Thirty One items and have been extremely pleased with all of them.
5.0,"I keep these at my desk and use them when I am transcribing dictation.  The reason is that I can feel the pedal options easy with these on and if I have to get up and walk away from my desk - they don't stand out like it would if I walked sock footed or barefooted.  I wear them all day almost at work and then I put my ""dress shoes"" back on when it is time to go home - or if I have a meeting.  I like the rubber soles - they're protective but not so thick that I cannot ""feel"" my way on my foot pedal when doing transcription."
5.0,I LOVE these pants! I'm 5.9&#34; and have a 42&#34; butt. These pants reach alllll the way to the floor even in my platform flip flops. :-) They look GREAT on a round butt!
5.0,"I liked it, I brought it to go with a dress"
5.0,It's bigger than I expected but I love the style and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it!
5.0,What a beautiful dress! Thank you Imiy Bella ! Love it !
5.0,it super soft and fir great
5.0,I was looking for a black pair of cropped pants that I could wear to work in the spring and summertime. These are slightly cropped on me (I am 5 ft tall) but if I want to crop them more I can easily roll up the hems a little more. I usually wear an 8 or a 10 and I ordered a 9 I believe and they fit me really well
5.0,Super handy for attaching things to webbing belts or MOLLE.  I use it for holding my trekking poles to my backpack.  Easy to install &amp; use.
5.0,So nice and pretty! Love them!
5.0,Awesome vegan wallet! Very happy.
5.0,"I love these! Finally a bandana that fits all my head needs. I keep orange and green for hiking and they hold all my hair, great for wrapping around a water bottle, carrying small objects, or to keep sun off my head. Stylish!"

5.0,"The dress is absolutely beautiful! Well designed and constructed! I'm so excited to wear it! It looks exactly like the picture! The only thing with my dress is that it is a little big in the shoulders and chest area, but nothing to dramatic to fix the situation! Everything else fits like a glove!"
5.0,This is such a light and airy dress. Great for an upcoming vacation. I’m only 5ft tall and I can wear it with flats. Love it.
5.0,Very nicely made shirt. This shirt is very comfortable and can be worn just about anywhere or just around the house. The material is nice and soft. The best part is that it is machine washable with color loss or any shrinkage. Very nice and stylish!

5.0,Beautiful earring!!! Clear and not too big very clean packaging...love
5.0,These glasses are so amazing!  First time I put them on I had to take them off to make sure they really had lenses.  They are so clear and since they are polarized they are amazing. I bought a pair for my husband and he too took them off to validate he had sunglasses on. Buy them now!
5.0,England trip
5.0,Matt dad loved them
5.0,It’s Hard to find Gowns that Fit me Comfortable. This Gown is Light weight and fits my Great! I Love it. It’s Also a really Good Price
5.0,Love those. Best flops ever! I’ve owned three pairs and if I would stop losing them and leaving them places I’d probably still have the first pair because the Reef quality is unmatched!!!
5.0,love it.  super comfy.
5.0,I had to order a few sizes bigger than normal because they run small and 1x still was too small so keep it in your mind when you order them but they are amazing and I am so glad I have them and I will be getting some more soon
5.0,"Love these socks, I’m fussy about socks, I like them of great quality,  death well, look cool and feel great in all types of foot wear and weather conditions. These work so well on all those accounts I’ve bought 3 lots. Just love them so much ( never thought I’d say that about socks ) and when<br />People spot them when your sitting down, they always say’ love the cools sock’ enough said👍"
5.0,This was a gift and was better than expected
5.0,I got these for my son . These studs look beautiful!
5.0,"Great bag, good quality, fits a lot (but less than I thought). Happy with it."
5.0,"Love this purse! I was having a hard time trying to find a purse that wasn't luggage-sized because all I need is my wallet, phone, and a couple other things... Not the whole house lol. This is just the right size for both those things, it's made very well and seems very sturdy but isn't overly heavy. Love it! Shipped much sooner than Amazon said, sou that made it even better!"

5.0,"Love these pants!  They are soooo comfortable, feels like you're wearing yoga pants.  Love that they come in the 32"" length for us people with long legs.  They fit great, pretty much wrinkle free.  I haven't washed them yet, will have to be careful not to get them in the dryer as tag says.  Want to order more colors but currently out of stock, hope they refill soon!"
5.0,I gave these zebras to my granddaughter for jewelry making. The zebras are silver with black in the indentations for the stripes and facial features. There is a loop on the head for attaching to your jewelry item.
5.0,This hat is lovely but the customer service is lacking. They shipped a second hat and expected ME to pay for return shipping to China. I have never heard of that with an Amazon error.
5.0,Smaller than I thought but still cute. I would buy again.
5.0,"I’m on my feet at least 8-10 hours day.<br />I’ve only worn these socks for the past several months - and what a difference they’ve made already - markedly decreased foot swelling, decreased itchy dry wintry skin, and just an overall improvement in my ankles and feet. I highly recommend them."
5.0,Even cuter in person !!!!
5.0,Fun PJs for our grandson
5.0,"If you're like me, you misplace things while you're working in the shop, so I bought this pack of glasses and just keep a drawer full of them.  They do their job."
5.0,Looks great easy to install
5.0,Very nice and a good price.

5.0,Beautiful flattering dress.  Very high quality material and put together well!!  So much nicer than expected.  The size chart is very accurate.
5.0,Only a surfer knows the feelings!!
5.0,"Really happy with the quality of the socks thus far. Good length over the whole calf, unlike a lot of styles which only go halfway up the calf. Material seems to be thick enough to withstand some good wear without having to worry about the material thinning out. I would recommend this product for anyone on the fence."
5.0,My daughter never liked to wear an type of hats or cap but she loves this one
5.0,"This sweater top is so comfy, it is soft and fits perfectly. I'm usually a medium in tops, but based off previous recommendations I ordered a small and it is perfect!"

5.0,Very comfy. A staple piece for any wardrobe
5.0,"Bought it as a gift for my sister, who loves big face watches. She really loved the style - not too bulky nor too manly. She tries to show off the watch in any photo we take .. :p"
5.0,Received all 3 pieces quickly they are all the same size which is perfect was not sure as wording was not specific.
5.0,My new favorite work our pants and loungewear! So comfy. I’m 5’4” and 125 lbs and I got the medium-perfect!

5.0,I got this for a trip to Disneyland with my godson and it was his birthday special hat he loved it and it looked great!
5.0,"Exactly as advertised, and as described by the vendor. The belt will not slip and is totally adjustable.  True it's a bit long for me (36&#34; waist) but the extra tail is captured by my belt loops. I do not feel the need to cut it. I will be purchasing again in different colors. Very satisfied."
5.0,I wore them with a huge sun hat and never felt so cute! Worth it!
5.0,The grandkids love their new goggles. I like the snap in the back it makes it much easier for them to get them on and to adjust the sizing

5.0,Great Product!! Looks amazing

5.0,[[VIDEOID:7fa1a3a9cf156ef916961ad0908ba9df]] Posted a video to get a full look at the charms. They are so cute! Got these to put on my daughters’ crocs. Perfect for them :)
5.0,My baby girl looks dead so cute. Nice and comfy. Exactly as pictured
5.0,"Perfect replacement, fit is good and very easy to install"
5.0,It looked like the picture However was smaller that expected. Still like it

5.0,Mom of small waisted boys approved
5.0,Both My  Sons loved this.
5.0,Great dress washes up great too.Love the colors and it arrived promptly
5.0,These were better than expected. So cute. Expect large glasses
5.0,the dress fitted great!!! even though it was a little short because im 5'9 it worked out perfectly!!!
5.0,"Got this for my daughter, she really wanted tom holland but didn't have any in charms but she was happy with this."
5.0,Not usually much for Red but I could resist. Exactly what I expected and more.
5.0,Nice to have a mostly non-plastic option. Very durable. Doesn’t leak as long as sport spout is pushed down tightly.  Not sure the best way to clean the sport spout. My 3 y/o loves this bottle; she takes it to day care every day.  Doesn’t seem to affect the flavor.
5.0,Very nice cap. If you have a big head the band will be tight on your ears
5.0,Love the coat. Usually wear smalls so got a medium and had to return for a large. It is good now. The blue is really pretty. It is warm and comfortable.
5.0,Very cute for St. Patrick's Day.
5.0,Love this top!  Very comfortable & fits perfectly.
5.0,very sweet  it is on my holiday bracelet  and looks great
5.0,"I am a second time working mama who needs a 44DDD. This is so hard to find in a nursing bra, let alone a bra that is appropriate for wearing outside the house. All others that fit me are more jogging-bra style or give horrid shape. I've tried several that claim to be the righ size, but really really are not. I am so glad to find this bra - it is true to size and very supportive and the girls look great. I still wear the other ones more at home because they're a little more comfortable, but for going out or to work, this is it. Thanks for a great option!"
5.0,Very light and well made
5.0,"These are awesome for hiking, climbing, etc. Absurdly comfortable. 5'5"", 125, XS fit perfectly. Such a good price for the product, too."
5.0,Very happy with watch. Love the cuff style.
5.0,"Absolute beauty. The chain is rather delicate and I am worried about breaking it if handled roughly, but it looks better than a heavier chain would."
5.0,Love the shirt fast shipping
5.0,I love it its awesome. .
5.0,This will be a Christmas gift. Big time Mario fan.
5.0,"Bought these to wear around the pool, and they're non-slip & surprisingly comfy.  I typically have trouble finding enough arch support in a slip on, but these are really pretty good! I  didn't expect to, but I can wear them comfortably for several hours around the house as well. I couldn't wear them all day, but someone without arch issues is probably fine."
5.0,Picked these up because I needed a pair with pockets and I loved the color.  They are sooo soft!!  And they don’t move.  Stayed in place the whole workout!
5.0,"Based on comments I read, I ordered a size larger than I thought i needed.  Turns out it is perfect size.  The material is real thin, something like my &#34;chico bag&#34;.  However it fits into the pouch very well.  I like that it will take up so little space in a suitcase."
5.0,"Wow it is beautiful...just what I expected, the material is perfect for summer nights and even over a winter coat.  I wore this  with a black vintage dress and it was a perfect match.  I will be using this a lot with skirts, jeans ect.  Also received the shawl within 2 days of order...Thank you"
5.0,"nice dress, I got it for when I get married I am going to wear it, I love the color pink. Not a bad price either."
5.0,I just love the flowy feel of this item. I cannot help taking longer strides in it just to get that fabric billow!
5.0,"Great cap, fits good and not your ordinary cap."
5.0,Comes with fliters
5.0,They are so beautiful and elegant
5.0,Great gift for my beautiful granddaughter..so she can know what a great young girl she is.

5.0,"These are excellent. I was looking for Minnie Mouse ears for my daughter's party and these were perfect. I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for the perfect set of ears for a party, Halloween or Costume."
5.0,"This is my second time buying these shoes, as my kid grew out of the last pair. They last. They appear to be comfortable. And they are a price that works when your kids grow 2-3 sizes each year."
5.0,my granddaughter loved this
5.0,"Got this for my nana, Ans she was thrilled. Took forever to get here. but that's my only complaint"
5.0,"Love the dress,  super comfy and will definitely  recommend ordering."
5.0,The little shoe was really pretty and delighted my granddaughter.  It attached easily to the SilberDream bracelet and looked beautiful on her little wrist.  The cubic zirconium really sparkled.
5.0,"Works very well in cleaning to bring back the luster!  Gets rid of the gunk, but the gunkier the jewelry the more time spent to clean so make sure to seperate jewelry after cleaning so they stay cleaner longer (hang one necklace per hook & one set of earrings per container).  Clothe is the best to clean silver & this clothe knows its job!"
5.0,T-shirts fit like a glove that is exactly what I was looking for
5.0,This shirt is perfect for any Friends fan! The fit is true to size and the decal feels silklike and it holds up well through the washer and dryer. The cotton is extremely comfortable as well. Definitely recommend as it’s a very nice quality shirt!
5.0,"He will use this with his car and dorm keys!  It will be great to see him graduate from Waynesville, Ohio High School."
5.0,My son was very happy with the quality of it
5.0,The metallic finish is beautiful.  The quality is great.  It is smaller than I am used to.  I had to let go of all the stuff that I was carrying around with me.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a smaller hand bag.
5.0,Very well made and soft!  I absolutely love the color too!
5.0,"Great design, great tee."
5.0,"I bought the robe for myself, but i wanted to get it first before i started gifting the robe to my friends and family. I feel like Oprah, all my friends and family will get a this robe in their fav color :)"
5.0,Product is good however it did unfortunately fit to big.
5.0,"I had trouble getting this to fit correctly initially, but keep in mind that's only cause I'm fairly new to ear cuffs. Once on, this is really pretty! Looks lovely and reflects light quite well."
5.0,Love the color!  The material and design is solid.  I do wish it opened wider.
5.0,I needed a new wallet that fit into small purses. This fits perfectly and it holds everything that my large wallet held.
5.0,So cute & not to hot
5.0,"It's heavy, it's large, and fits my wrist proportionately.<br />This is the 4th Invicta I purchased in just 3 mos.<br />I love this watch."
5.0,Fits great! Love that it's adjustable! I volunteer at the local zoo here with the otters and I'm loving the compliments I'm getting
5.0,This dress is just as described. SUPER CUTE and comfy. Great style of dress. It is a tad short but that was expected.
5.0,I bought this blouse hoping it wouldn’t be see through and it’s not.. it is fully lined.. Perfect fit. I ordered a 2 x as I wasn’t sure and it’s perfect size.. I loved all the colors and decided to order another one in Green.. it’s just as nice and well made.. I still may order the pink one.. You can dress up or down it’s a lovely top..
5.0,Would buy another one. Very comfortable. You can dress it up or wear with tennie shoes. Super cute.
5.0,the new adjustable wrist band makes the fit perfect....feels and looks great....skol
5.0,Have to a friend and she loves it!  Bought one for myself also
5.0,"This 'fascinator&#34; is FABULOUS!  Shaped organza(?) and 3 tiny feathers on a teardrop base comes with a headband and hair clip is just about all you need on this very pretty, yet sophisticated fascinator! If you wish to add a veil, I purchased &#34;Our Warm 6 Inch x 100 Yards (300FT) Tulle Roll Spool  Tutu&#34; to make a small veil, or &#34;13cm Width Lace Mesh Trim Ribbon Gift Wrap&#34; (you get 5 yards) WIDE lace trim with fine tulle attached - how to do?  run a fast basting stitch around the inner edge of the lace/net, pull into a loose circle, wrap around under the fluffy flower and adjust to taste, and neatly sew together the edges.  You don't want to do too much to this or it will look overdone and cheap.  Depending on your hairdo, you can easily change out. the hairband or hair clip.  This is a soft &#34;flower&#34; and moves with you - you wouldn't want to spray hair spray on the fluffy flower or it won't move.  If  I could give MY idea of idea of stars - this would get 15!!  Grab this beauty while you can - it is GORGEOUS!!  Wear it on the side of your head for the 'sultry' look - I ABSOLUTELY love this little fluffy flower and HIGHLY recommend it!!  (My husband HATES HATS - they 'cover up your beautiful hair'!  In my late 40's, early 50's I finally developed a figure, only to have breast cancer pounce on me, and I had to temporarily give up my Boobalas!  Reconstruction, and I'm back to my perfect &#34;B&#34;!!"
5.0,I like this holder and everyone knows who it belongs to because I love Elvis
5.0,Nice little band. Stretchy and adjustable.
5.0,Got this as a present for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. It's his new favorite hoodie. The colors don't bleed in the wash. Fits as expected and is thicker than I thought it would be.
5.0,"Purchased two, one for me and one for daughter-in-law... we both love them.  Very soft and different ways to wear it."
5.0,"Big, thick girls; this skirt is AWESOME! It fits this 280lbs, 5'10 woman. I do look nice in it too. It is great for me since I am a covering Muslim woman. It reaches to the ground and I have length to put down more in case I want to wear heels."
5.0,Definitely it!.
5.0,"Bought this for my 7 year old son as a small surprise.  He wears it everywhere.  It's lightweight, breathable, and unique.  Wearing it allows him to peacock a bit compared to the other little boys wearing normal baseball caps.  In fact, adults will routinely compliment him on it when we're out in public."
5.0,Very. Good
5.0,Sexy and my husband loved it!! Comfortable and easy wear.
5.0,Looks great! Feels wonderful.
5.0,Exactly what I had in mind when I ordered it.
5.0,Wife is going to love it. She was looking at it and I seen she wanted it so bought it for Christmas. She will be surprised. Nice size.
5.0,They were a gift for the hubby so I got him the normal size lol if your hubby is a little larger on sizes size up one so I ordered a large and he could have probably used an XL
5.0,I guess I don't understand the problem with the review. It did not work out that that was what we were looking for and they were accommodating to what we needed and took care of us. I don't think there was a requirement for more detailed than that. We were in a transaction with them we came to a mutual agreement and that's excellent customer service.
5.0,Got a great deal on these and they are some kickass goggles.
5.0,The shirt fits very well.  The sleeves come to just above the elbow and the back of the shirt covers a well rounded bottom!  My bra is a 40D and I ordered a size 18.  The front of my shirt reached the waist.  No problem covering my problem midsection.  About to order more.
5.0,Fits just perfect!!!
5.0,It is exactly what I wanted.  Thank you
5.0,"I have 2 of the straps of this line from this vendor with a 3rd on the way. I have the Italian San Pueblo frosted leather band in chestnut brown and this review is of the horween leather version in 'natural'.<br />Curiously, this horween version is a little longer than the other, it won't bother the majority of people, but I have a wrist that varies between 6.25 and 6.5 inches, so it's a bit loose on the last hole, but not to a bothersome degree. Maybe it was a qc issue but honestly it makes sense as horween leather has a bit of stretch in there as a natural characteristic.<br />The band is extremely supple straight out of the box and needs no 'break-in time'. It's comfortable and extremely well made (even the thread seems premium). In both cases, the legitimacy of the quality of leather was obvious immediately, they both looked, acted and smelled how leather should. The horween version in particular will stretch a bit in the place where it's subjected to repeated bending (like at the clasp/hole connection) while not losing any strength that I can notice.<br />It's fair to say that I liked it from the start, but this is where things get interesting. The band absorbs the oils from your skin whenever it can. Resulting in overall darkening and character (especially at the sides/ cross-section). Within a matter of weeks, my band has developed a dark patina on the sides that I notice other bands try to faux during the manufacturing process. For full disclosure, I do use a single drop of Howard's leather conditioner on each pair of my leather bands once or twice a month for better long term durability (because skin is skin and the cow can't do it for me any more), so perhaps this has fast-tracked my strap's seasoning. I will allow you to view the pics and judge for yourselves.<br />The underside of the strap wasn't neglected either, it's made from the exact type of leather that I like to see there. I wish I could explore more colors (Bordeaux or merlot, whichever on the way) but it might be a bit impractical to buy every single color even though I like several more. I strongly recommend."
5.0,Impressed with quality and fit for low cost.
5.0,Perfect shirts for anyone who doesn't want to spend $20+ on a t-shirt.
5.0,I actually bought this and added it to a chain to make a necklace to wear on Halloween. I’m in outside sales and just wanted a little something for Halloween spirit.  I LOVE this keychain. Really well made and the size was larger so it would stand out for me as a necklace. Very happy with my purchase!
5.0,"Cute, just as in pictures"
5.0,Love it light weight I cnt feel it sometimes is a little smaller when they came to my house but it didn't matter to me because if it really was that big I would have sent it back
5.0,A gift for my mom to give one of her bosses. She likes the look of it so much that she said she'd definitely pick one up for herself eventually.
5.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; and weigh 150 pounds. I wear a size 36 D. I usually wear a size 8 to 10 in US size, which is the 42 in EU size. So, after reading all the reviews about how small this dress is, I ordered the 46 in EU size and it fits perfectly. The apron is too shiny, for my taste, so I turned it around and used the dull side of the apron. It looks much better that way. I also ordered the petticoat that goes underneath with the matching blue color.  It looks good with or without the petticoat. Very nice dress for the price."
5.0,"Bought these for my 10 year old's gamer birthday party. I worried 10 year olds might be too mature for party hats, but they had a blast with them while we were serving the food. They also worked great as table decor. I would buy a few extra, I ripped probably 5 out of the 40 I put together. Their stability is a little iffy, but a small piece of scotch tape took care of that."
5.0,"I love this robe. I wanted a robe that touched the floor before it was laundered so it would remain long, or at least to my ankles. It is warm and soft. I ordered the purple and it is a deep, rich shade. I have always bought robes that have a belt and tie around the waist. The zip up front is my new go to style!"
5.0,I love it! I am 5 5 and 150lbs. It fits perfectly. I can't wait to wear it.
5.0,Colors are great but the top could be a little longer.
5.0,"These are exactly what I was looking for - a hanging earring that wasn't too big or too small that I could wear everyday or for dressy occasions. They look so real, are super comfortable and for the price you can't beat it. Love these!!"
5.0,I have twin boys so I bought two. The second they put these on they said “much better!”  They also commented on how breathable they were.
5.0,Daughter in law loves it!
5.0,"Very comfortable, and did not shrink."
5.0,Great glasses.  Enjoy wearing them and benefit from the lenses that block and filter the sunlight.
5.0,Comfortable shoe perfect fit.
5.0,These are the cutest shoes. Grandson got lots of compliments!

5.0,Comfort and earn.  No complaints.
5.0,Fit well and the material was nice and smooth and the photo was a good representation of what came in the mail.
5.0,These shirts are really nice quality. I was actually surprised. I have 4 as I wanted various colors. Worth the $$.<br /><br />Note they are made in China.
5.0,"This outfit is too cute, I love it. There is elastic in the shorts that is great if you have a mom tummy like me.  I'm 5'7  200 lbs for reference."
5.0,It's a Mitchell & Ness Hat 🤷🏽‍♂️ Need I say anymore? 🇩🇴😉👍
5.0,"PEPPERS!  TV Commercial?  Anyone?  haha, great glasses....use them all the time.  A+ brand too"
5.0,Fit as described and nice design.<br />A higher poly% fabric would be better but is a noce vest and different than most out there with the double breasted appearance.<br />I would buy again.
5.0,Amazing leggings love them so much
5.0,love this purse.  my only problem I have is the handles get in the way when I'm using the shoulder strap.  Otherwise super cute and holds a lot for a small purse.
5.0,I loved.... it is perfect
5.0,I love these!! So cute!!
5.0,I absolutely loved this dress. I received so many compliments at our all Red Banquet.
5.0,great variety of colors and quality
5.0,My husband has large calves and ankles wearing size 9 wide shoe.  These socks are comfortable and do no crease at ankles like others we have purchased.
5.0,The sleeves were slightly long but over all a great dress!! I wore it to a wedding last weekend and it was so soft and comfy!! Got lots of compliments as well!! We own several of the short sleeve dresses as well and we can’t get enough how wonderful the fit and feel of these dresses are! The pockets are a nice added touch as well!!
5.0,Surprisingly well-made and great colors (ordered the blue-green)!
5.0,"This is a really gorgeous yellow gold and crystal rhinestone belly button ring! My 19 year old daughter got her belly button pierced last year and she only wears studs, which are pretty, but I thought she would really appreciate this fine piece of jewelry. Boy did she ever! It fit perfect on her and it has 5 crystal rhinestones that dangle. They are small and progressively get larger which looks really stunning on her tan, slender body. She loves it and told me she never thought she would like anything that dangles because she thought it might get caught on her clothes. Not a problem, since it's summer and she spends most of her time on the beach with friends. She's also going to Universal Studios and told me she can't wait to be seen wearing this lovely belly button ring. I like the fact that it's surgical steel since she has sensitive skin. This is a lovely piece of jewelry that I was fortunate enough to receive at special promotional price in exchange for my honest opinion. Very Beautiful Piece of Jewelry!"
5.0,Fits good doesn’t slip
5.0,Broke where the clip is. It is too small don't waste your money.<br />looked great for as long as they lasted.
5.0,Everyone loves it especially me
5.0,Amazing Product durable and comfortable

5.0,Adorable. 5 year old loves them.
5.0,It’s a basic T-shirt with a design that a like what more could I ask for. The shirt isn’t soft but it’s not super crunchy
5.0,I like how I can cut to my own lenth. AND it is super easy with the tool as well.
5.0,"The tunnel set took awhile to arrive but that was advertised, and the quality is good. The set came with a second free pair of black tunnels, so that was a nice surprise."
5.0,A little pricey I thought but my 5 yr old loves them!!!
5.0,Earrings arrived earlier than expected and are beautiful !!
5.0,Great piece great price! Perfect fit
5.0,Loved these pjs
5.0,i'm a 5'3 and 120 lbs. i usually wear smalls but the reviews say  these sweats run small so i ordered medium blue and just love it. sizing turns out to be true so it is a little too big for me. i recommend you order your size &#34;not one bigger&#34;. it is perfect for 12 dollars. couldn't beat the price. i was expecting some bad quality sweat but this sweat is fantastic. it is soft in and decent hood. the color is as picture. i will get a logo put on.
5.0,It is beautiful.  Can't wait to wear it to officiate at the wedding.
5.0,romantic. Great partner present
5.0,Nice material. Big enough for two head wraps.
5.0,perfecto vendedor
5.0,Best $3 ever spent
5.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; 150lbs postpartum, with a long to average length torso I got the small and it fits very well it holds in my lower abdomen well. And can be worn under a dress without showing or rolling off...  mind you my abdomen  has already been almost flat before wearing this. Do wear right after giving birth it won't work.  I got this two months after using the waist trainer or a good belly band to shrink my belly then after about a month I got this to wear just this under my dresses or outfits on a day-to-day basis for continued support."
5.0,My grand daughter loves it! Lot's of interacting functions
5.0,I’m in love with this top. I wear a small ( 32dd ) true to size. I’m not disappointed at all. I’ll be back : )
5.0,I love this dress! It’s super cute and true to size.
5.0,Bracelet to big. But fast shipping
5.0,Very pretty!My granddaughter loves it!
5.0,Just know your own measurements as the dress runs small. But it is a very nice dress with quality stitching.  It looks better on than in the package. It is figure flattering as well.
5.0,"I got this bracelet because I'm always looking for cute, inexpensive jewelry and this certainly fits the bill...and seriously, for $2??? I mean, if I get 2 uses out of it, it's a win! It was easy to put on and take off; you just pull on the strings on the back to tighten. Love it!"
5.0,These help steady my grandson as he runs & plays in our uneven yard.
5.0,"I couldn't wait for Halloween for my daughter to be this happy to be Dorothy.  This dress is very well made and fits her perfectly with room to grow (2 years old, 30 pounds, on the tall side).  I like that it's relatively long so she has another year or two use, assuming it stays clean ..."
5.0,This necklace is beautiful and is packaged so nicely.  I'm ordering another one for my boss. Highly recommended.
5.0,Great wallet. Fits everything you need.
5.0,My future wife loved it.
5.0,"cheap boots to take out the dog.  they fit nicely, warm, on/off pretty easy.  I would buy again!"
5.0,My mother was all smiles when she saw what I purchased and uber stylish at my Granny's funeral. This is now her go-to hat for church...lol
5.0,"I bought 3 ""identical"" dresses from 3 different sellers/manufacturers. Bibowa have the best quality and I absolutely love this dress. Hope you have some more stock soon as I now have 2 of these dresses and I'd love more. I returned one of the dresses from another seller as material and quality were poor. Buy Bibowa!"
5.0,As expected Welbilt constructed hat
5.0,This works great on Birkenstocks!
5.0,"I got these because they were cheap, however they are a steal! The material is thick and sturdy, the capris compliment my shape (nothing ever does!) And they have the perfect little pocket in front for keys, a fitbit, an iPod or a cell phone. I  definitely buying the two pack again!"
5.0,Perfection. It was exactly what I was hoping for. It was a present for my sister and she loves it!. Thank you!
5.0,this could be uses by a woman too. as a collar pin. it is nice piece of jewelry.
5.0,"I ordered this swimsuit for my teenage daughter, and it fit perfectly! She is tall and thin (with a bit of curves), and I was worried about the suit being too short in the torso, since some reviews found that to be the case. But it's not! My daughter is about 5' 7&#34; and 118lbs, and generally wears a size &#34;small&#34;. But we ordered a MEDIUM swimsuit, as suggested by many of the reviews - and we are GLAD we did! It fits just right! Very flattering and stylish; she's received LOTS of compliments! Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Definitely a bit larger than what I was expecting, but I also ended up loving it much more because of that! It's great for a casual day out or you can easily dress it up. I'm 5'2&#34; and 115 lbs and ordered a size S. I tie up one end for a beachy look and I'm really happy with it overall. The material is a little heavy and drape-y, but it's not too hot for sunny and humid FL and it doesn't turn see-through with light."
5.0,Bought a pair and I am very happy with how it looks on and how well and clear I see threw them
5.0,"It made my son happy plus it's exactly what he wanted, thanks"
5.0,"This is the only top I wear running trails. It is cool even in the summer, and is great for layering in the winter in non-bitter-cold days. The shoulders give enough coverage that a vest will not rub on bare skin. The cap sleeves are perfect for protecting shoulders from sunburns. It is pretty loose so if you are looking for a fitted top, this is not for you."
5.0,"What a novel idea.  The buckle is a bit bulkier than a normal buckle, but I love the fact that you can micro adjust the tension, for those days when your waist seems to grow ever so slightly.  I needed to trim it a bit, as it was a bit long.  But, it's a simple cut and you're done."
5.0,Great store.
5.0,Nice packaging.<br />The earring are great- exactly as I hoped.  I’m very pleased.
5.0,Really nice quality. I get compliments all the time. Sometimes people think it’s a watch and are surprised to learn it’s a Fitbit. Nice piece! 👍
5.0,"This was a birthday present for our daughter as she prepares meals for the Salvation Army, these are perfect."
5.0,So far so good! Cuts down the glare considerably! Definitely recommend them! And they don't have that silly clip that's a tell tail sign that you are wearing clip ons!
5.0,Muy buena experiencia con el producto y la marca
5.0,"I really like this top. Its soft, warm & great for the cold weather. I did find that it ran small & had to reorder. Seller was very accommodating & sent me a larger size with no problem."
5.0,I bought this for my wife to rep[lace her C5 pink hat. She loves the C6 leather slash on the brim and the fit of the hat as well. And as usual it shows her love for the Vette. The logo colors are vivid and crisp and jump out.
5.0,"This is a nice gift for anyone since everything is wrapped up nicely. Nice paper, plastic wrap, and box. They are a slightly too costume style for me,  but I enjoy them enough that I would wear with matching outfits."
5.0,The usual great carhartt quality
5.0,"Fit perfect, like the stretchy denim material, very comfortable"
5.0,"A very well made dress, beautiful. Shipping was longer than expected, and I paid for expedited."
5.0,"Great assortment, I have showered in them and worn them days/weeks at a time with no discoloration. I highly recommend!!"
5.0,"Excelente outfit, perfecto en el ajuste"
5.0,"Loved the design, comfort, affordability, versatility, and more. Friends think it a hat. Cool & comfy"
5.0,This dress is an absolute steal! I was very pleased with the quality for the price. After reading other reviews I ordered a small instead of my usual medium. I’m 5’6 and 138 lbs. The small was a perfect fit.
5.0,"i love these, they are very pretty and look exactly as pictured. i have very sensitive ears, can't even wear gold earrings, and these didn't irritate or itch my ears at all when leaving them in my ears for 3 days. they come exactly as the last picture shows, but with the backs packaged in a separate small baggie inside. the earrings themselves are secured with a foam backing that's placed behind the card. mine came with a few extra pairs of backs too, which is awesome since i'm always losing those things!! the backs are not the easiest to get on, but at least i know they are very secure and wont come off while wearing.<br /><br />i don't understand the reviews saying they are smaller than pictured; they are exactly as pictured. those people must have selected the smaller earrings since they were cheaper and thinking they were the same item. it tells you what size you are ordering above the pictures, they are offering the same style of earrings but in different sizes; the smaller ones are the cheaper ones. the mannequin in the photo does have tiny earlobes, but it still portrays the accurate size of the earrings. i got the 8mm ones and they are the perfect size for me, not small but not giant. i love them and now want the green ones!"
5.0,I really like this top.  The fabric in green is very striking and seems to garner a lot of complements.  I wash cold in a net bag and hand dry.
5.0,They fit great and the adjustable ear straps are amazing. Will be purchasing again.
5.0,Have it beside a lounge chair and it is the perfect height.
5.0,Love this dress.  Wearing it to a wedding in the fall.  Very flattering.  Soft and comfortable.
5.0,Love my watch. Very classy.
5.0,My husband looks like a rock star. Very hot.
5.0,"this is by far the best bag for my needs.  I ride a motorcycle and this lets me carry everything.  My pack includes 2018 iPad pro 12.9"", kindle paperwhite, bluetooth keyboard and mouse, assorted chargers,cables, ssd drives, thumb drives, wireless router, pens, pencils, Pixel 3XL cellphone, extra reading glasses, alcohol sprayer (better than sanitizer goop), assorted adapters, business cards, etc.  You get the idea.  I can sling it over either shoulder or wear as a fanny pack with it around my waist and it resting on the seat."
5.0,"Wore this for my wedding dress, as I am an older bride. Everyone raves about how beautiful it was! I loved it and made lasting memories in it."
5.0,I've been wearing this 24/7 since I received it in late December - almost 2 months (I don't wear it in water). I haven't had any problems. I would recommend it.
5.0,"These are perfect. I got two for my Ciri cosplay for The Witcher 3, and I couldn't be happier. Highly recommend if you're not looking to spend $40 on an official medallion."
5.0,Love this thanks so much.Blessings to all. Mitzi
5.0,"The material is thin, these are not in any way a heavy weight thermal.  But the wool works very well in layering and the construction seems good."
5.0,cute jewelry and functional way to do it
5.0,Beautiful! High quality shirt.
5.0,Nothing much to say. Its a folding wayfarer and the color looks snazzy.
5.0,Great quality! They all fit great.
5.0,I kept the same toe ring on for a few weeks (in and out of the shower and to bed) and the color did not fade from silver. Will absolutely buy again this summer!
5.0,This crown stands up on its own and is made with quality.  For the price it is economical and looks much more expensive than it is.  It is royal perfection!
5.0,This hooded shirt is lightweight so can be worn all day without being too warm. It has some stretch to it and is very comfortable.
5.0,"At first, I was frustrated with not being able to figure out how to adjust the band, but customer service was great.  They worked with me until I was able to figure it out.  I think anyone would enjoy this watch.  You do have to wind it every other day or so, depending on how long you wear it.  Thanks, customer service."
5.0,"Bought as a gift for my grandson. These fit his face better because it's"" teen fitted"" kids sizes are extremely too too small: even if he's 7yrs He loves these and again they fit great! Good price,( 3 fortnite big bonus) good quality, fast delivery"
5.0,Fits great did order up a size
5.0,"This dress, is awesome, I love it, fits perfect. I’m about X-large, and this dress looks great on me."
5.0,"I was a little bit skeptical when purchasing this item. I have never gotten clothes from Amazon. However, this was by far the most gorgeous two piece set I owned. Scrambling trying to find a outfit for my Honor Society induction, everyone was amazed of my outfit and the way it look so well.<br /><br />If I had a another event to go to, I would surely wear a different color of this."
5.0,"I bought these to work in my yard, it’s hot in Louisiana and I sweat working outside so I hate sleeves on me. Great fit, will buy again. Fast delivery! A+"
5.0,"Beautiful earrings, silver work and high quality. VERY PLEASED."
5.0,Very cute as a dress it came just above the knee super bummed I couldn’t wear it as a shirt but definitely does make a cute dress!

5.0,"When it comes to these gloves ,I just got them they are really good quality for the price 100%.. as for the sizes let's say you order a 16oz it's going to feel like a 16 oz professional size glove not a 16 oz... let's say twins or fairtex.. which are more of a bulky kind of  glove ,now this one specifically has more of a pro 16 oz or Pro 12 oz Etc and so on feel... I highly recommend these gloves"
5.0,"If you are looking for extremely safe solutions, I would advise the medical masks. But this one is much more comfortable and also looks nice. The fabric has a nice feel too."
5.0,No show! They work!

5.0,"5'0&#34;, 138 lbs, athletic build with broad shoulders. Got a medium, fits perfectly. Super soft material. Getting more in different colors."
5.0,"El vestido es de buena calidad hermosísimo puedo decir que es el mejor vestido del mundo. De lo largo hasta el tobillo, es como se ve en la foto. De esponjado no pues necesita una criolina paraque se vea esponjado pero bellísimo. Lastimosamente me quedo apretado de arriba yo soy talla 12 o M y pedí 14 o L. Pero aún así necesitaba un 16 quizá. Lo mande a areglar espero me quede bien. No lo regrese porque se tiene que dar muchas vueltas para eso en fin me encanto. Solo un consejo pidan 2 tallas más."
5.0,Great fit and appearance
5.0,I got to receive the product on time and when I received it I got very happy with the quality. The only problem is that it is a little heavy and might hurt the nose a little but still looks very cool on the face.
5.0,Soft and fits just like the home party ones out now!  Much more reasonably priced.
5.0,I love these May You Be Women's Casual Elastic Waist Linen Short Pants with Pockets! They are so comfortable yet still cute and add a little style to an everyday look! Fit was on point and they don't wrinkle as bad as I thought they would. Love the color as well! And the pockets!<br /><br />I highly recommend!
5.0,I want to buy one for all of my friends...it is soft and comfortable...perfect for Halloween!
5.0,"My nephew that passed away had this same hat and my husband loved it.Thanks to the accurate description of this hat, I was able to purchase an identical one for my husband. Now we have an irreplaceable memory."
5.0,So comfy and fit perfect!
5.0,"Fits just like I thought it would, though it's a little longer than I thought but it's okay."
5.0,"These are gorgeous! Fit is perfect, fabric is nice. Really a steal fit the price."
5.0,"Love these glasses! Very stylish yet traditional metal frame, very comfortable fit, great polarized lenses. The side bows can be easily adjusted."
5.0,Tried it on and it will work.  Going to Alaska and will use it then.
5.0,Better then I hoped for. Came in a timely manner.
5.0,Cute simple necklace!
5.0,"Pretty close to the factory OEM insert insoles found in variety of Sketcher shoes. I wasn't looking for pain relief or arch support, simply for a replacement insole to replace the old worn out raggedy insoles that came with some shoes. I wanted to get a bit more mileage out of my shoes. It seems the insoles wear out faster than the outer part of the shoes these days. These seem to be very well priced for that purpose."
5.0,This was absolutely beautiful and just the right length! The ivory color was elegant and I will surelly wear it again. At 5'4 I bought the XL because of baby bump but I'm positive I will like the fit even after!
5.0,I LOVE THIS DRESS.
5.0,"The burlwood adds an extra touch and is different from what you typically see on sunglasses.  The fit needs to be adjusted, but other than that I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,Great skirt.  Sequins are well sewn and looks like a much more expensive skirt.
5.0,Great item. Would definitely purchase again
5.0,This dress looks and feels like it was made for me. Just enough room to slide over my body...just from fitting enough to hug my curves. This is a winner!!!
5.0,Super soft and comfortable! I'm probably going to buy these again if Amazon gets more in stock!
5.0,"I ordered a medium and it fits like a medium.  It is snug and comfortable against my skin and I really like them.  I like them so much, I plan on buying more!"
5.0,"These are like fashion jewelry and gold plated.  They are quite pretty and elicit compliments.  They are easy to put on and take off.  They are nicely packaged in a presentation box and can make a great gift. These are beautiful and a great deal at this price point.  Highly recommend.  No irritation or issues with these.<br /><br />TIP:  To be sure you get your preferred size or weight, check the size you order - there are two sizes offered"
5.0,It’s perfect if you need to look pretty for a party & required to wear a mask. This is a mask for looks only - no protection. It was perfect for my formal event.
5.0,"Light and great fit for my son, will buy it again"
5.0,Lovely.  Like this piece.
5.0,I got the medium size trees and they fit my 9.5 euro 43 perfectly!  Great tree!
5.0,Excellent es very original
5.0,"I ordered this with the thought I would return it, if it looked cheap. It doesn't. It's well made and quite beautiful. The size easily adjusts by pulling on the waxed string. I really love it and look forward to wearing it for years to come."
5.0,These socks were a hit at Christmas. Gifted to family members in the northwest and they loved them.
5.0,This dress is beautiful. The colors are as the picture shows. I ordered the large but was too small at the chest area.  I bought it to wear  at a  wedding which would have been the perfect dress!
5.0,Sexiest bday dress ever!!
5.0,"Fit just a bit smaller than expected, but the adjustable straps are awesome. The arch support is just right for high arches."
5.0,I was surprised by the excellent quality for the price I paid. I bought these for my daughter and her friends but had to place a second order to have some for myself! They are adorable and can fit children and adults. I'm so happy with then I bought a second time. Love them!!
5.0,I wasn’t expecting like this as much as I do. I wear a 32ddd and this fits perfectly. The built in bra band sits under my ladies but never rides up or shifts around. This is super flattering to busts and figures. I wore it on two days where it hit a hundred degree and kept cool. Will be ordering more.
5.0,"Comfortable, cute, washes well, arm holes aren't oversized. Would purchase another color."
5.0,Good on sizing and packaging
5.0,"Perfect size, well made, really cute!"
5.0,The masks are cute! Especially my 5 year old who is obsessed with chess. The chess mask made his day and now he wants to wear it all the time. The fit is perfect for him. He messes with it less resultingly.
5.0,Very cute outfit. High quality!
5.0,"It arrived on time, they fit perfectly and are dark sunglasses. Love them, super cute!"
5.0,"So I needed a warm knit hat (four of them, actually) for my mother who is about to start her first round of chemo for pancreatic cancer.  I loved the price, but it made me nervous that the hats may be less quality because of it.  I was wrong.  Sometimes you just get good quality at a lower price.  I ordered four different colors and they were not only all true to the description of the color, but they're amazingly thick and exactly the right size.  She will want to fold it up at the bottom to be above her ears, but my son asked me to order another purple one for him to wear in solidarity with her treatments and he plans to wear it unfolded over his ears.  The fact you can do both is cool, and they're beautifully made, perfectly stitched, thick without being ridiculous, and comfortable enough to wear for long periods.  Thank you for selling these at exactly the right time when my family needed them.  They are very appreciated and I may end up coming back to order more in different colors if she starts to lose her hair."
5.0,Looks like leather and warm
5.0,This is an excellent dress fit perfect for a 5'1 and 142 pounds I ordered Large. It got like a glove even with my 34G size bra fit perfect.
5.0,Nice watch- Semper Fi!
5.0,Its a beautiful dress and well made. It’s a little big for me as I usually wear medium. Order a size smaller. I will purchase again in smaller size in different color!
5.0,Really is easy on easy off best compression socks I've ever had
5.0,Great fit. True in sizing. Love this color. Glad I bought it.
5.0,Very surprised how comfortable they are. And the fabric seems sturdy.
5.0,Definitely helps to make me more visible while running at night
5.0,Very soft and comfortable. Looks exactly like the picture.
5.0,"I really like the fit. I'm 5'9&#34;, waist 28, and hips 38 - I got a size 5 and it fits great. It's sexy! My only issue is that it fits slightly above my ankles. It'll be great with boots that covers it."
5.0,Purchased as a gift and she uses it all of the time. Very comfortable.
5.0,I love this. I'm ordering another in a different color.
5.0,First of all this is a fantastic conversation starter being able to tell people it is made directly from a recycled firehose. It is solid construction the elastic has not worn out in the last year and I am able to fit eight cards in there after stretching it for a month or two.
5.0,They fit really good and look great. Hide back and side fat perfectly. Love them. Bought 3.
5.0,True fit Beautiful dress and quality fabric. I’m ordering another. I love Allegra K dresses.
5.0,"I bought this shirt in a XL and when it arrived, it was snug....I returned it (free returns and credited to my carde) and I reached out to Treelance explaining that I loved the shirt but it was a Wee bit too tight.  Their customer service is GREAT!  I have been working out at the YMCA and lost a little weight and I simply loved this shirt....so I did what any girl that Loves something does....I bought it again as a reward for my weight loss.....Shirt fits great....tight as a glove...lots of compliments.  Love TreeLance...they sent me info on helping with my tree pose....Namaste!"
5.0,I love these blouses. I am a 2x and they all fit perfectly! You have to wear a cami under it though.
5.0,Love the swimsuit HOWEVER ORDERED 4 SIZES LARGER AND FIT PERFECTLY.  REVIEWS STATED SIZES RAN SMALL SO I ORDERED ACCORDINGLY AND WAS VERY PLEASED!  I ordered another one I liked it so much!
5.0,"Love it!! Wear it everyday and so does my boyfriend, we bought each other matching ones. Its not cheap  perfect heavy weight. My boyfriend put his on a nicer chain but i love the adjustable fabric one."
5.0,I really like them good size
5.0,Looks good with my ginger snaps.
5.0,"I was replacing a small cloth purse for a purse I could use with more than jeans.  Although I was looking for something aboul half as long, I was happy with my new purse.  I like the idea that it unzips to expand.  This came in handy on a recent trip"
5.0,I got these socks because my boyfriend is a succulent freak.  I expected the usual flimsy weight that you find with most cute design socks.  These are really substantial.  He loves them.
5.0,Like it but wearing it one at time
5.0,"This was a Christmas present for my husband and he loved it!! I was skeptical for the price but definitely worth it. Nice weight and size for a men’s watch. Great style, he’s gotten lots of compliments"
5.0,I really like the band and have recieved compliments on it .
5.0,"I really like them!! They’re SUPER warm & comfy & soft! I can even wear them without socks; they’re THAT comfortable! I can also wear them outside like it says! They DO have hard soles! (That’s the main reason I took a pic of the bottom of the slippers; they don’t have a pic of the bottom, for some reason.) And actually thought about going to work with them today for Casual/Comfy Friday! Lol 😂!  They’re THAT nice & comfortable to wear! I was a little nervous that they would be too big for me (I have really small feet 😅 & often have trouble finding shoes, especially online, that really fit me good & got the smallest size because of this), but, luckily, they fit me very snugly. 😊 One more thing I want to say about these is that they are not exactly pink like the color description says; they are kinda pinkish/lavender-y like in my pictures. I honestly don’t know why the color description says pink; they are NOT really pink—at least to me, which to me, is perfect because I really like the color lavender, but if you’re looking for some really pink house slippers, you really shouldn’t get these. 😉"
5.0,Loved this cute first Christmas. Was a little big but kept baby super comfy. Loved the colors and it was a big hit on Christmas. My baby was almost 7 months at Christmas so I order a size up then normal. Rather it be to big then to small
5.0,"Pretty shirt if you are thin, it runs small, hard to put on too"
5.0,Perfect for fall hiking. Fits perfect.
5.0,Good variety of animals and colors. Gave out individually as Christmas gifts.
5.0,Better quality than I thought it would have been.
5.0,"I ordered a size larger than I normally wear because I don't like to wear anything tight.  Though not tight, it isn't quite as roomy as I would ordinarily buy.  Nonetheless, it is a great top, at a great price."
5.0,Very happy with this purse. I bought one for me and one for my daughter. We both love them. Nice section for the computer with a snap instead of the most often used velcro.
5.0,"Great glasses, protects my eyes exactly how they should be, the design is sleek and modern and the construction is sturdy"
5.0,Decent quality shirt for a good price.
5.0,"Very pretty. I ordered it to wear for my engagement shoot, and it stayed in my hair the whole time! (Though I did secure it with a bobby pin.)"

5.0,This dress was absolutely stunning. I got so many compliments at a wedding Ive attended to back in april.
5.0,"Super cute swimsuit. I had originally seen it at Dillard's for maybe 4x the amount. Came home did a search to see if I could find a better deal online, and this one came up. I was so excited! I ordered it, I love how it looks, yes the bottoms are a little small, but the black part covers it up.  It's very good quality, fits and looks great!"
5.0,"&#34;It's either Mopar, or no car&#34;"
5.0,I LOVE MY HEAD PIECE ITS EXACTLY AS PICTURED I WORE IT TO A PARTY AND IT WAS SUPER CUTE! GOT LOVE IT! GOT ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS.

5.0,"These work really well with whatever you wear! Depending on the store, I am either a C or D. I ordered C cup and it fits perfectly! Love that it's strapless and that it still sticks on after multiple uses. I even wore them to the swimming pool and it didn't budge. Will definitely order this again!"
5.0,"I absolutely adore this ruana. It is so light-weight and soft, and the colors are beautiful  I would say it works a bit better for a short person, like myself, because I can sometimes be overwhelmed by the larger ruanas. Very warm and comforting. If you're on the fence, just get it! You won't be disappointed."
5.0,Very Cute and bigger than what I was expecting.
5.0,Originally ordered medium going by the size chart and they were not long enough in the fingers. Moved up to a large and got the fit I needed. Very comfortable.

5.0,I'm a 10.5 size and its great I bout these in another diffrent color also highly recommend

5.0,These glasses are great!! They fit like raybans and have a mirror across the front.
5.0,these are good quality...they are &#34;tear away&#34; so they have a lot of panels and velcro but work well and are highly visible
5.0,"They for sure come smaller, as I read in previous reviews. BUT I have tiny hands so it was perfect for me. Wearing them for the first day and getting home, my dog was excited to see me and snagged it a little. So forewarning if your dog is crazy like mine steer clear with these cute mittens on! lol Overall I’m happy and my hands are staying warm in the Minnesota weather. You also cant beat the price, highly recommend."
5.0,Excelente me agradó ya lo puse a mi reloj
5.0,"Love these earrings!  Very sturdy, very classy look!"
5.0,I got them for my wife and she love them.
5.0,"Pockets aren't the most efficient, but the look more than makes up for it"
5.0,"These are exactly what you need to keep your boots upright. I used these on my two regular (just below the knee) riding boots and my over the knee Sturt Weitzman boots, both fit perfectly. I was nervous that the over the knee boots would be too tall but they're not. The adjustable clip is amazing."
5.0,Good quality. Runs small had to exchange for a larger size. Otherwise great. Got a pair for my other daughter.
5.0,"I love this watch, it looks very expensive and is moderately priced.  I receive many compliments and it can be work with jeans or dress up.  I was not disappointed."
5.0,I usually wear a medium (8-10) but got the large and it is just a little big as I like it that way. Very comfortable. It’s my new favorite shirt!
5.0,Warm and fluffy!
5.0,I was a little leery at first about what the quality of this scarf would be for the price but it's very nice!
5.0,unbelievably I got these for only $12.99!! they are just a tiny bit larger but I can't complain!!
5.0,This dress is so cute. It’s a light airy material no stretch. Definitely order your true size. Well made. I ordered a large and it fits fine.
5.0,Love this robe! It fits beautifully. My roommate compliments it every time I put it on. Could almost be worn as a dress...it’s that cute.
5.0,I really liked them. Pants fit me and were flattering to my shape. A bit too many rips but that's just the style.
5.0,My husband has numerous shirts like this in different colors.  He loves them and we will purchase more in the future.
5.0,"The pearls themselves are beautiful, blemish free, larger than I expected and very evenly matched. For the price I paid, I was very surprised by the quality. They came with a small velvet bag for storage.<br /><br />My only complaint has nothing to do with the product itself so I am not detracting from the rating for it, as I believe I got much more than my money's worth. However, It would have been nice to have a gift box to present them in. Also, the envelope it was mailed in was torn in route and there was a real risk of the contents falling out during shipping. However, all is well and it arrived intact and in excellent condition."
5.0,Pretty all together
5.0,I was looking for 16&#34; neclace and this is the perfect one. I also like the thickness of this necklace . Oxidized pendant has beautiful look. Worth every penny.
5.0,Love. Love. Love. Super cute. I wear it to work and to work out in so it is versatile. I have received many compliments. It’s comfy and great quality. I would highly recommend!
5.0,Great gift for my daughter. She loves it.
5.0,"I am a size 6 and the Small fits great, washes well in cold water and hung to dry.  Love the pockets.  Purchased several others in different colors.  Get lots of compliments and feels so comfortable (like wearing pajamas).  Looks great with boots or flats.  My only wish is that they would make some with thicker fabric.  I would pay more for thicker material. This is thin, jersey fabric.  Now that it is getting colder in the bay area, I wear fleece lined leggings underneath and a long slip.  Can't beat the price though."
5.0,I did not wear the earrings to this set because they were too heavy.
5.0,"I really like this tank top. I got the ones with the neon trim, size medium. I have always worn t-shirts but this is so much more comfortable! I don't know how they will hold up over time though, and I would not say they are compression tops. I am 5' 3"" and 127 pounds and ordered a size medium."
5.0,I kept dropping my eyeglass case or it would not fit in my purse.  This case snaps on to the outside of my purse. Easy to access and it is secure at the same time.
5.0,"Buy This: I have two teenage daughter who like the midi-rings, so I took a chance and won. These look lovely and my girls love them. They don't ship quickly, but worth the wait ... just plan ahead."
5.0,"This little piece of jewelry is THE perfect size!! I thought that it would going to be too big, but it is perfect and is a very nice color. I really dig the decoration. I would buy again. Thanks!"
5.0,"This is great for lounging around the house, feeling like a boss, late night cigars and whiskey not included. Very soft, very comfortable, sleep like little Armenian baby guaranteed."
5.0,My daughter loves them and they are so well made!!! Great value!!!
5.0,"Great for decreasing an engine bay. Instead of using a spray bottle for a half hour, this does the job in a minute."
5.0,"I love that you can wear this at a natural waist, or more at hip level because of the elastic waist. I am tall and want the skirt to be close to the floor, so I wear it at my hips with a cute retro band shirt. This skirt is super comfy and good quality."
5.0,I've been shopping for a while for a dress to wear to my granddaughter's wedding in July.  Finally found this one.  Perfect!  I may order another in a different color later.  thank you Laksmi and Amazon!
5.0,The dress came fast and to my surprise fit perfectly. I felt like a princess .
5.0,"Was a present for the wife, and she loves it. Thank you!"
5.0,"Cool pants, comfy"
5.0,They fit very well and are very comfy.
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, excellent quality! My Granddaughter loved them, especially the moon!"
5.0,I really like this product it’s amazing.
5.0,So far the bag is holding up my daughter loves it..
5.0,Finally found a pair of slippers that fits my husband feet. Went through 3 different pairs from different pkaces to get this one. He needed WIDE size and not many have them. Thank you!
5.0,I love this hat!! Thank you!!
5.0,"After a long search for a good quality windbreaker, I finally found it. I normally wear XL, so I ordered 2XL. Arms length is perfect, but the torso length is a little too long (I actually look like the penguin from Batman)..... but heck, I’ll wear a sweatshirt underneath and done deal. I’ll recommend it."
5.0,They must have fixed the button problem because we had perfectly sewn buttons.  Perfect first day of school dress.
5.0,daughters favorite dress
5.0,My granddaughter loves this dress. Fits as expected. I didn’t realize that the bow in back is pinned on. The clasp on the pin is not very strong. She wears it without the bow. Could probably change out the clasp with a better one.
5.0,Beautiful and lots of room!
5.0,love it. Looks much pricier then what it is. Very soothing to the eyes and lightweight
5.0,"They made the flower girls dresses, look so much better!!"
5.0,"Love this purse. Impressed by seller, delivered before delivery date. Very happy and great price!"
5.0,These are my husband's go to shirts.  They are a little more expensive but worth every penny.<br /><br />Usually order directly from their website but was looking for a particular pattern and color and found it here.<br /><br />Colors are exactly as pictured. For reference my husband is 5'9 and weighs 155. Medium is perfect.
5.0,Wow!  I just got it and it fit perfectly on my 1.5 year old.  I think it will be smaller for any kids older than 2.  It is very thick and will definitely keep my daughter warm this winter in NY.  I'll be purchasing more colors.
5.0,Love it for 3cards will fit up to 8 looks and feels good in pocket
5.0,"I purchased these shorts with the expectation that I could wear these while hiking and also take an occasional dip into a river along the way. While I have yet to try these in water, I can report that they fit as expected, they are true to the posted image, and the material is more cloth-like than I imaged it to be (i.e. not a swimsuit plastic-y feel)...<br />And as the clothing material suggests (and the belt loops, pockets, and fly), these are more shorts than swim trucks. Another example: the lack of a lining.... And I am okay with this... but just remember, if you are wearing these and if you plan to get wet, I suppose you will have to go commando, as wearing underwear while swimming might not be the best of ideas."
5.0,Very cute. Comfortable fabric. Easy care. Great buy!
5.0,I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He LOVED it!  It made him so happy and me happy too.  I was worried about the fit and it turned out to be perfect.
5.0,"Looks like a watch that would cost hundreds.  Doesn't really need the second keeper on my big wrist, but great looking and solid watch."
5.0,"I needed this hat to march in January. Although it wasn't exactly pink, it worked perfectly and fit well. t was winter and it kept my head nice and warm. Nice hat!"
5.0,I really enjoy this watch so far. It looks really nice and yet it isn't too flashy and can still be worn casually. It is really durable so far and I haven't experienced any issues with it yet. It came packaged very nicely and even included a nice box as well. My Dad loves it!
5.0,Go by the size chart yes its definitely tight going up the legs but not impossible to put on it eventually loses up with time sorta like breaking it in so it will be easier to pull up by the legs this is very stretchy material so dont be scared to pull and tug but once it's on it fits great and dose the job in smoothing me out and gives me a smaller waist line and yes its tight enough for support and not as uncomfortable as other one that I own
5.0,"perfect fit for me, I normally buy XL"
5.0,"Fun socks, fit well. Came on time."
5.0,I like how they look on my son
5.0,"Looks great, my daughter loved it"
5.0,Love these sunglasses. This was a steal for everything that's included.
5.0,I love this swimsuit it compliments my body.
5.0,The girlfriend loved it!
5.0,"I wouldn't say that it's the most advanced, moisture wicking, or softest sports bra I've ever worn, but quality is very reasonable for the price. I wear it as an everyday bra. Shrinks slightly in the wash - next time I will size up."
5.0,"Cute, very light weight dress."
5.0,I love this hat! Comfortable and warm!
5.0,"Mask provided great air movement and fit snug on my face. I purchased so that I could work out at the gym without having hot air when I'm breathing heavily.  Works good, but be sure to purchase correct filters for the mask as this was a problem I ran into. The description on the type of filter wasn't clear in my case."
5.0,Thank you so much for providing this excellent product.  My husband is a new priesthood holder and just loves that he has such a handy supply of oil on his key ring at all times.

5.0,"Ponytail fits, and it's comfortable and warm"
5.0,I love this dress. I will be buying more dresses from this seller.  I bought this same item from another seller - no liner and made too small. I can take this in a little and it will be awesome or a belt.AGAIN ONLY THIS SELLER FOR MY DRESSES FROM NOW ON
5.0,True to size. I got the medium and it fit perfect. Such a pretty dress for any ocassion. Got so many compliments.

5.0,Comfortable with just the right amount of lift!

5.0,Great fit - product as described. It’s decently soft material and an appropriate length!
5.0,Very soft and warm and heavy.
5.0,"I have been looking for nice silver hoop earrings for a long time. These are just beautiful, light weight and I love the hammered look. Thank you!"
5.0,Bought these for my 26 year-old son.  He wears them all the time.
5.0,Great fit covers the whole ear.  Not super warm but great for temps into the 30 range.  Sometimes I use them under ear muffs for extra warmth.
5.0,"I'm 5'5 and about 220 and the 3x fits great! I'm traditionally apple shape but the sequence makes me look more hourglass, which I like. The material on the back of the dress could be thicker but not completely see thru. I am more than satisfied with my purchase!!!"
5.0,"My daughter loves spider man so I got her these socks and I was worried since they are for men but they fit her nicely! She’s a women’s size 7 and very thin. So if your a guy with really thick calves, the picture may get distorted but otherwise these are really good socks. She wear them to Marvel Movies and Super Hero days at school. They didn’t shrink too much either."
5.0,"For the money, this is a great pen."
5.0,I love this charm.
5.0,"I LOVE THIS. While it keeps my body warm, it is very light-weighted and the color and size are exactly what I expected. When I first opened the package the product did not smell like anything at all. I will be wearing this pretty often since I really do love it. I will definitely buy more when this comes up on the deal list again."
5.0,I love this dress! The material is soft and comfortable and it fits perfect! I ordered a medium which is the size I normally wear. The length us perfect and the price is right! I would definitely recommend this dress!
5.0,This item is wonderful. It's somewhere between true to size and just a hair larger. The fabric is nice and soft with a good amount of stretch. I love the detailing and it's nice enough to wear on a night out somewhere or even just for a nice dinner. Would definitely get this in other colors and buy more items from this company.
5.0,Love this mask.  Beautiful Keeshond
5.0,Shorter than expected otherwise perfect
5.0,"I like the look of this jacket and it's a nice light jacket. The size 10 fits my eight year old necely, the size 8 would have been too smal for her."

5.0,Got this as a gift and I love the look of it and how well and accurate it keeps time.
5.0,"Great price, great product, lovely pattern.  And a trolley sleeve that *just* fits my suitcase.  It'd be nice if it was a bit wider."
5.0,I absolutely love these plugs!!!! I couldn’t wait for my ears to completely heal after stretching from 2g-0g to finally be able to wear them. I am a fan of healing crystals so these are perfect. Not sure if the crystals are 100% natural but I don’t mind either way. I really appreciate that the flare is not too much bigger than the gauge like other plugs! I don’t feel like I’m ripping my ear apart every time I change them. I would definitely recommend!
5.0,"For reference, I am 5'11 and 200 pounds. I usually wear a US 14/16. I ordered a large in this dress (normally I wear an XL) because I am smaller up top and I wanted it to be a little bit shorter on me. I love the beautiful berry color of this dress, and I love the button details down the front. I found it to be very flattering, particularly to the chest region. The cinching detail there really draws the eye. Overall, I love this dress and wish they had it in more colors!"
5.0,Bought specifically for a Halloween costume (Weird Al) but I wear them anyway because they're funky and fun.
5.0,muy confortable

5.0,"I'm so happy with this sweater! It's nicely made, medium warmth, fits perfectly and the shape is flattering. As if all that isn't enough - the price is very reasonable for the handcrafted quality, and the company is sponsored by National  Geographic and helps support less privileged - yet very talented people. After I bought and wore the sweater and learning more about the company - I decided to buy other products from Novica as I think they far surpass Dept store quality and I appreciate the company's effort to support culture and art from around the world.."
5.0,Easy to add and remove coin as needed. Fits heavy metal or the cheaper plastic rings.
5.0,I use this to carry my prescription readers everywhere in my purse.

5.0,Love the dress especially with pockets. Nice for casual everyday use.
5.0,I ordered more than I needed because I just assumed some of them wouldn't work. I open them and tested every single one of them and they all worked. I was pleasantly surprised to realize the light color matches the flowers on the wreath so the red flowers have red lights and blue flowers have blue lights etc. I cannot wait till my event when we are all wearing them and lower light.

5.0,Perfect fit. Very cute and comfortable.
5.0,"This has become my favorite sports bra. It holds everything in place, doesn't dig into the back unflatteringly, and looks so cute. I have so many more expensive bras from Victoria's Secret/reebok/under armour and I like this one even better.<br />For reference sake, I have an athletic build and am a 32c and I ordered the small for high impact stuff and the medium for weight lifting/pilates days (the medium doesn't compress/support as well as the small but is even more comfortable)"

5.0,"These are, hands-down, the best no-show socks in the world."
5.0,"Love it! Big pockets, super comfy. I honestly wouldn't wear it to bed cause it's a bit warm for me. BUT if you want a nice easy cute outfit go hangout with girls, at home, running errands , or just getting some coffee highly recommend regardless."
5.0,I have been looking for one for quite some time and was really pleased with both how the print looked and how it fit.

5.0,Small enough to fit in my pocket with a fob attached. Looks like it will last.
5.0,"I was almost too scared to order this bra but I'm glad I got it. This bra is true-to-size and feels AMAZING! I love the material, it's extremely soft and comfortable even after a long day. The wires don't dig into your ribs either like other brands. I've never been disappointed with Warner's and I'm still not now."

5.0,Beautiful stones well made no downside great value

5.0,"My boyfriend had ordered this ring over the weekend for me and we received it today, on Wednesday. It was shipped out Monday so it was very quick shipping! The ring is petite and looks amazing. I'm not really into real big rings so it's perfect. It looks so much better in person and it sparkles in the sun. I would really really suggest purchasing this ring."
5.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for. I don’t have any trouble getting cards in or out of the slots, it’s really slim and good quality! 10/10 recommend"
5.0,Nice and sturdy. The pink stood out
5.0,Beautiful and exactly as shown

5.0,For may infant great
5.0,Love it. Looks really good.
5.0,"I like everything about it. Some people may not like how thin it is and it may be a bit see-through for lighter colors. I live in FL and do a lot of stuff outside, so I'm very happy about the thinness. It's likely to get a few holes and weak seams after several washings. I plan to put it in a laundry bag and hang dry it.<br />I love the slight racer back. I would be happier if it was thinner because I like to show off my tattoos. It works perfectly with a plain, racerback sports bra.<br />I've attached photos of the front and back with and without a belt to make it easier to see the higher waistline on the dress. I've also attached a photo of the side view and of the pretty deep pocket.<br />Measurements & body type for reference. Height: 5'1"". Weight: 128 lbs. Bust: 34D. Waist: 25.5"". Hips: 34"". Build: Athletic."

5.0,For our four year old great grandson so perfect!
5.0,"Great so far, I’m not into tie clip but this selection have work well for me. I am glad that I chose the one that had more than a few selections. A single color or style would made me purchase more. I was worried that the clip would ruin my ties but no worry. The design prevent that from happening. Great product! Yes if you don’t want your tie to be all over the place and you want it to stay in one place, than this is the product for you. One more thing, it gives you that vintage look!"
5.0,"The material on this dress is perfect for a progression series of photos. To start, not pregnant, we used me. The dress fits wonderfully and looks great. On a woman who is a little pregnant, the little bump shows well. On a friend who is very pregnant, the bump shows perfectly and the dress stretches, just as it should. This isn't just for one photograph. It can be used for multiple stages of pregnancy to show progression. I highly recommend this dress for photo shoots. Now, for a special occasion, don't. It is too long and you could trip over that mermaid type pool of fabric that follows you around everywhere. This is for photos, not for wearing to a special occasion. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
5.0,Very good quality and exactly the same as pictures
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet with just the right amount of weight to feel substantial. Also, clear stones that sparkle!"

5.0,Great fit and the fleece lining helps to keep me warm in cool weather.  Not thick enough for 32 degrees and below.  Would be nice if they had thicker fleece options

5.0,Amazing my daughter loved it
5.0,Love the leather look vs the silicone
5.0,I love them they are super thin but just right for my nose. They are easy to put in and they don't irritate my nose. I love them!! I would post a picture but dont no how to...
5.0,"I love these bibs.  The only negative was the smell out of the packaging.  It took 2 washings to remove the foul odor, but I absolutely LOVE these bibs.  They are perfect for my 95 yr old father who lives in a Memory Care Center.  He loves them too and that's the best part!!  Wish they had other color options other than blue and white but the blue is very nice."
5.0,Worked perfectly for a where’s Waldo costume
5.0,Great ring to have to leave as family heirloom for your grandkid someday.
5.0,Larger and heavier than expected BUT very pretty and affordable!
5.0,"I have a bad habit of wearing my earrings constantly, and due to this they get tarnished an incredible amount. I thought they were trash until I tried this cloth. It is two pieces, sewn together, one to remove tarnish and one to shine. My pictures here are after just a few minutes of polishing. This cloth works great!"
5.0,My son really liked this costume for Halloween as the Invisible Man. It seemed to be a quality costume. We didn't experience any problems with the seams or the zipper even though and an eleven-year-old was boisterous in it for two nights.<br /><br />I did hear that it ran just a little bit small so I ordered a size up and it was perfect for him.
5.0,Fit vey well.  As advertised
5.0,"loved it, great value for the price!"

5.0,"THIS NECKLACE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL. IT IS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, THE COLOR IS PRETTY AND IT IS DEFINITELY A NICE PIECE. SHIPPING TOOK A BIT SINCE IT WAS FROM CHINA, SO THAT WAS A BIT ANNOYING,SINCE I BOUGHT TWO DIFFERENT COLORS OF THE SAME NECKLACE AS A GIFT. THE CHAIN IS GOOD ENOUGH, BUT I WILL PROBABLY BE REPLACING IT.<br /><br />SHIPPING WAS SLOW BUT THEY HAVE EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST, UNBIASED REVIEW. I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE COMPANY AND THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED ARE MY OWN AND I HOPE IT HELPS. I AM THANKFUL TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS PRODUCT!.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, please click &#34;yes&#34; below where it says &#34;Was this review helpful to you?&#34;"
5.0,"I love it, True to size and flattering"
5.0,Nice weight materiel
5.0,"The belts are easy to put on, and the velcro is strong and holds well.  We also used them as a ""life meter"" in a nerf war.  Each time a kid was hit, they took a flag off.  3 hits and your out. Velcro flags made it easy to bring order to the chaos."
5.0,"Jus love it !!  This is so cute , u won’t regret it if u buy it"

5.0,Love them to death
5.0,Great watch! Use it in my rotation with my seiko and islander watches. Love the hacking feature and i’ve gotten many compliments on it :).
5.0,"I bought this dress is a cute option for the fall / winter season.  The dress is cute but it's sadly too small for me I normally have to order two sizes up considering I'm 6ft and 200 pounds but I fell in love with the dress and decided to give it a try anyway. Anyone 5'7"" or shorter the dress will fall about mid-thigh on you (give or take your butt), however if you are 5 7 or taller I do recommend a cute pair of dark colored shorts and or some stockings / thigh highs (I prefer a thigh highs cuz they made the outfit looks super cute). This dress is very easy to layer especially if you live in cooler climates so you don't have to worry about it looking bulky underneath. Overall I have to say it was a really cute buy and I like shopping at this particular store.<br /><br />PS my sister is about 5'6 and absolutely loves the dress with grey stocking and her black lether jacket."
5.0,Great glove
5.0,"I use these often, especially in my shorter boots.  They are warm and look cute."
5.0,Gave this to my mom as a gift for her trip to Canada and she was so happy to announce that it was comfortable and definitely kept her warm.
5.0,My twins love these slippers. They match a pair that their grandmother has. They have a hard sole so they are sturdy and keep up with the chaos.
5.0,I have bought quite a few of this style of hat before and this one is by far the best. The material is super thin light and breathable so your head is not going to sweat like crazy. Just looks good all around. Some hats the material is too thick and it looks kinda goofy you know. Not this one.
5.0,These are well made and not cumbersome.
5.0,Super Comfy!
5.0,"Comfortable and stylish, right fit aver the heel and don't creep down."
5.0,This swimsuit is just too cute on my 14 year old! She loves it! I thought it was nice cuz it covers while letting some skin show! Modest enough! It also came earlier than expected!!
5.0,Comfortable and eye catching.
5.0,I absolutely love all 3 shirts!!! After I received them I went back into my cart to order more in other colors but they were unavailable. I noticed a little bit of shrinkage on the first one I washed so I am hanging the others too dry. They are very soft and the neck does not stretch out after hours of wear and no little balls of lint come off either. I will be purchasing more of these when they are available
5.0,"Once I got the right size, great product! Originally measured as the large, but the small is what actually fit."
5.0,Great glasses at an affordable price.
5.0,The quality and workmanship of this hat is amazing . Fits perfect.
5.0,Ever since seeing the mermaids at weeki wachee springs in Brooksville fl my daughter had a mermaid obsession and wanted a tail.  Taxes came and i did my research and found mertailor. He was some what local so i knew our tails would come fast.  I had them in a week. Mine fit like a glove i didn't want to take it off. I was trying to save my daughters for her bday but it didn't work. She got hers and we had to go to the pool right away.  Hers fit perfectly.  She was in love and over the moon excited. They are so easy to swim in.  And yes the corners will tear scraping on the sides and bottom of a pool kind of common sense. Its just fabric. I mean its not meant to last forever but our tails are perfect.  Childhood dream come true.  Thanks mertailor
5.0,"Once I got the correct item I ordered, I love it!"
5.0,"I got this sunglasses not too long ago. I thought that they were priced pretty fairly. They're basically the same as let's say a Ray-ban but just with another brand name on them, They fit great and look great!"
5.0,I love this sports bra ! So comfortable and supportive. I ordered two sizes up as recommended and it fits perfect. I'm a 34DD and ordered a 36DD. The shipping was fast especially coming from china. I will deffidently be buying more:)
5.0,"Very comfortable, very warm..  Saving for winter!"
5.0,"I absolutely love this thing. These connect and work even better than my own personal headphones that I have had for years. The only downside of this product is the short duration of only 5 hours of music, but for standby and mic controls this is absolutely solid without the ridiculous look of a mic hanging down your ear. The beanie itself is also comfortable and warm being perfect for night jogs or general weather where it is expected to be cold out. I highly recommend this product."
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised by this necklace. It’s very dainty & pretty.
5.0,Purchased for me mother in law. They were just what she wanted.
5.0,I use this item specifically for work. I work around a bunch of fur. It definitely works to keep that stuff of my face. Plus it’s very comfortable.
5.0,"Hi love these socks.  They are really comfortable and don't slip or anything.  help absorb sweat during exercise, reduce the discomfort of friction"
5.0,I got these cause my Wife is always laying down her glasses and forgetting where they are or leaving them where they’ll get damaged. I chose this selection as they were classy with a variety of choices.
5.0,Great bag. Still too expensive in my opinion.
5.0,This is such a cute outfit I love it!
5.0,"As I reviewed this scarf at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion, I found it to be absolutely lovely. I get multiple compliments every time I wear it. It is incredibly soft and lays beautifully around the neck. With it being very long and wide, you can wear it many different ways.  I would recommend this scarf to anyone who wears scarves during fall and winter months. It is incredibly warm and comfortable.  The colors are cream, hunter green, and coral.<br />I absolutely LOVE this scarf."
5.0,Great looking shirt and it fits well!
5.0,Worker great
5.0,"Except for material and quality of seamstress, this seems identical to the Tonsee Women Casual Bohemian Short Sleeves Loose T Shirt Blouse  I also purchased.  The difference is like night and day.  If I remember correctly this  one was only about a quarter more. PAY IT!"

5.0,"Actually, I own all of James Harriot's books, and they are all wonderful.  If you are an animal lover, this author who was a Yorkshire vet tells the most heart warming stories.<br /><br />I was looking for a set of his books as mine are falling apart, and I feel that I will reread the series and would like a new one."
5.0,"I was really skeptical of any of these anti-fog products but was desperate and decided to give it a try. This product was so easy to use - clean your lenses, then spray each side and let it air dry for a few seconds.

5.0,It's great and also great customer service thank you so much
5.0,Based on the other reviews I ordered a size down. Which is the OPPOSITE of what I normally do with anything coming from China.<br /> It was a good idea.<br />I bought this as a Beach Cover Up - I am not planning on wearing it as a dress.<br />The material isn't great - it is thin and this is pretty short. the size 12 comes to the top of my ankles and I am 5'5&#34;.<br /><br />The color and print are very pretty though and it is very flowy and beachy. For my purposes it will be perfect!

5.0,Cute little outfit for my niece! I love it when she wears auntie clothing.
5.0,"Great fit, Greater price for a Wacoal.  Unbelievable.  Wish I could have gotten black and white in this model.  I love the 34F versus the 34DDD.  A tad more roomier.  Followed Wacoal's bra fit suggestions and it worked for me. Better fit."
5.0,This was a gift and he loved it exactly as shown in pic
5.0,"This was a repurchase for me. I own two of these &#34;card cases&#34; which I use as a wallet. I rarely carry a smaller purse but when I do this is my go to wallet. It does not have a place for coins but it has so many slots you can carry lots of cards and even some cash. If you need something small and compact for a smaller purse, this is the wallet for you."
5.0,"This is a great shirt for my husband, he is a Chevelle owner. It was a great fit and quality of shirt was better than expected. Made my husband happy."
5.0,"It's my first time using anything to spruce up leather, and I'm really impressed by this mink oil. It brought some little Coach booties back to life that I found on poshmark. I used saddle soap first to clean off and buff the initial surface scratches, dirt, and wrinkles, then applied this oil, and man, what a difference! It turned the leather a beautiful whiskey color that I never would have anticipated, and looks healthy and moisturized! I'm looking forward to seeing how it looks once the color fades a bit, but I'm already really impressed by how well this mink oil performs. I used it on another pair of booties--black ones--and the results weren't as obvious, but the deep creases and scrapes have pretty much disappeared, with just one coat of the mink oil! Definitely invest in this stuff, you won't regret it."
5.0,so cute & pretty!
5.0,"Perfect gift. My mom had her cat for 16 years and she passed this year. It was a very sad time, and I was with them through it all. One of my friends had bought me this necklace, and my mom seen it and said that she wanted one. So I got her one for Christmas. I can't wait to see her face when she sees it."
5.0,"Daughter loved this hoodie so much that we had to order one a second one in a different color so our younger one would stop stealing her sister’s hoodie! Durable, soft. Fits well, comfortable. Loved."
5.0,Excellent value and product which I would highly recommend.

5.0,I wear a 7X and this was slightly small but it will work.
5.0,Loved it<br />I got a medium

5.0,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE!! I'm always hesitant about my purchases through Amazon n these earrings I thought would be really cheap looking especially because of the price but, was I wrong! I love them! really thinking about purchasing another pair incase I loose them. Lol"

5.0,I am a registered nurse working in a busy ER. I wear these for every shift! I have 2 other pairs in different colors. I have tried other brands but these have the best compression! Will be purchasing more in the future.
5.0,I replaced the metal ring on my dogs collar. This worked perfect.
5.0,"I'm a tall girl so was worried about the length, but this jacket is long almost like in the photo(bottom of jacket reaches like mid butt) and the fit is true to size. The material is thick and I can tell the quality of this will last a long time. The left side sleeve from forearem to hand is black unlike the rest of jacket color which adds to the artsy black designs . I can't rave enough about how cool this jacket is. The finishing touch was that the company sent me a beer opener in the shape of a guitar as well extra and free. Awesome company with awesome clothing. Will be purchasing more items in future!"
5.0,Its a little short but in love with  the style and a cowgirl boots.
5.0,I threw this on under a blazer & and tee and it looked so cute. Great quality and fit.
5.0,"This bag is both light and sturdy and a great mid-size option for packing into your larger luggage just in case you carry home more stuff than you brought. I don't see any of the stitching errors on my unit that some other reviewers noted; mine seems to have perfect construction. I can tell by the durability of the nylon material that it won't develop holes or burst at the zipper when overstuffed, like some other bags I've used. I have yet to travel with it, but I think this expectation is reasonable given thorough examination."
5.0,Beautiful earrings and well made.
5.0,cute set

5.0,"I've been trying to find a flattering nicer every day top nd this one it amazing! From the draping of the sleeves to the rooshing of the tummy panel this is just a very flattering top. I'm at the very start of my second trimester and I've put on a few pounds but not enough for maternity clothes so this has been a life saver in these hot summer months.<br /><br />I received this product free or discounted in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, this does not impact the positive or negative nature of my review.

5.0,Fits my 7 year old perfectly! He said he likes these the best. Breathable and comfortable!
5.0,It looks and feels incredible. In love with this product.

5.0,"I sized up one to make sure it fit well, and it was perfect! It's a little heavy, but so cute on.  I love the overall shape of the dress, and I feel like it would add a nice silhouette to people who may not be super curvy.  It has washed well so far, with no pilling.  For the price, it really can't be beat!"
5.0,Very powerful... bought both colors white and nude.
5.0,My daughter wears a size small in juniors and is about 5ft. We bought her the smallest size; I think it's small. It fits her well for a swim cover and the color and fabric is very good and pretty. The length is just like it is in the picture. The look is very formal and great for pictures too.
5.0,"I LOVE these sunglasses.  The polarization is clearer than any other at this price, and they look very classy.  Am going back for another style."
5.0,Bought for my sister. Fits great. Looks great. Definitely would recommend.
5.0,"I’m 250lbs, 5’11 and wear a size 16 in jeans. I bought a 3x as reviews recommended sizing up and it fit perfectly. The top is not super tight, I’m very busty (38DDD) it fit well and the skirt is the perfect length for my height, it hardly touched the floor (I wore flat sandals). The material is light and dress was great for a July outdoor wedding. I was slightly concerned about belly space because that’s where I carry most of my weight but there was enough room."
5.0,The product was nice had to return it it was too big but I reordered it in a smaller size
5.0,Fit was great and the colors are vivid on the sweatshirt. It was exactly what my kiddo was looking for.

5.0,"These do not move when on your head, and help stop the sweat from running on your eyes!!!  The best one yet."
5.0,"I always buy a purse and then say ""if only I could find the perfect purse"". I think I found it. Very well made and has just the right amount of pocket for me. Not too big or too small. Built in wallet was a must for me. Never thought I would use the leash for your keys, but guess what, I use it and like it. Will probably end up buying a black one. I like the Indigo but black goes with everything."
5.0,The best hat I've ever had in food service headaches and sweat begone!
5.0,I thought it was wonderful to wear with my outfit. It compliments nicely.
5.0,"Please just buy them! I would recommend if you are a half size just go up. Because they are snug  and if you are wanting to wear a thick sock for a certain look... It will not work, honey. But overall this is well made boot! They are comfortable and very sturdy."

5.0,Great quality and my wife loved it.
5.0,"I wasn’t sure what to think when I ordered this cardigan. I was looking for a gold or mustard for my school colors. This cardigan is the most comfortable cardi, it’s the perfect length, it washes well so far (2 washes), hasn’t shrunk at all. Very comfortable. I’m planning on buying more in other colors. The mustard color is really pretty."
5.0,"I bought this for a friend who was having shoulder surgery and would be waking up in a sling that she wouldn't be able to take off. She had no idea what she was going to wear home from the hospital, so I gave her this as a gift and she said that she didn't know what she would have done without it. It's been almost three weeks since her surgery, and it's still the only shirt she can wear with ease.<br /><br />I bought her usual size and it fit without being tight at all, so I would say that it's a perfect loose-fitting top for after surgery. Also, it's a really soft shirt that washes and dries well. I definitely recommend it."
5.0,The cutest idea ever! Really makes any shoe look even better!
5.0,love these! especially the hidden pocket-works so good for my insulin pump!!

5.0,I love my dress. I love the material and the way it fits. I'm 5'8 230 sz 38DD sz 14 in the waist.
5.0,"I got this jacket for my grandson to wear to church.  He loves it!  He was so happy to have a nice jacket, when he got home he refused to take it off!  We are very happy with the quality of this jacket, too.  It is important that this be easy to maintain.  We are not going to dry clean a child's jacket, but fortunately it seems to wash in a washing machine well.  We then iron it with other shirts, pants, etc.  The only issue is that the size runs a little big.  It is advertised as for size 3/4, and it is definitely more on the 4 size."
5.0,Great items great quality!
5.0,"Super comfortable socks! these fit great and I love the grip on the bottom, they really help around the house since we have hardwood floors. They make it a lot easier keeping traction on the wood and while going down the stairs. Perfect for comfort and safety!"
5.0,I love the&#34;Poodle Queen&#34; She is one of my favorites and has so much bling.  She is a &#34;Must Have&#34; of the NinaQueen Collection.  Be sure and match here with the &#34;Puppy Foot&#34; charm too.

5.0,Love it! A short persons dream come true! Will recommend to others.
5.0,"Adorable and lightweight.  Love the two shades of blue; they will work well with jeans. With spring here, the dragonflies will look great."

5.0,It was a gift but she really liked it
5.0,"These people make the best leotards it has ever been my privilege to own. As a dancer & former gymnast, I have owned quite a few leotards by famous industry leaders such as Danskin. Look-it Activewear's leotards are clearly better in every way. I get the adult small (2-4), because I'm a small person, & it always fits perfectly. Their size chart makes it easy to figure out which size to order. They're very reasonably priced, and are significantly less than the Danskin, but much prettier and available in an astonishingly wide array of colors and patterns. In fact, there are so many truly delightful colors and beautiful patterns that I now have six of them, & they were surprisingly affordable, given the very reasonable price. They're also very high-quality leotards- I've had some of them for a few years now & they still look brand new. I always handwash mine in the sink & then hang them to dry, because that's just what one does with leotards. They hold up to intense performances remarkably well, & in fact, they work as hard as I do.  This leotard is my sixth purchase from this fine company."
5.0,Don't slip off your feet.
5.0,This is a cute inexpensive option for my Apple Watch. Very comfortable and the colors are perfect for the summertime.  Makes switching out my bands fun!

5.0,"I love the colors and the length for my two and a half year old! It was perfect for her. Not too tight at all,and perfect growing room. No fraying or anything. Very happy. Got them fairly quickly, as well!"
5.0,I give these bracelets to the men who order kits from me.
5.0,"The sunglasses on the left are the dupe, the sunglasses on the right are the real Celine Tilda’s. I was looking for a pair to wear around my baby who loves to grab my face. I also dropped my real ones on the ground, and had too many close calls. At $450 dollars a pair I needed a cheaper option for daily use. They are very close, the differences are subtle in my opinion. The shape of the lens is slightly off from the real ones but once you put them on it’s not noticeable. The 3 silver dots are slightly raised compared to the originals, and while they feel well made, you can tell they are cheaper when holding them compared to the Celine glasses, they are much lighter. The lenses on the dupe are darker as well.  If you are interested in the Celine’s I would highly recommend trying these first."
5.0,I like it. Two thumbs up.
5.0,These hats are warm and comfortable. Doesn’t itch at all. I have 3!
5.0,Loved it sized up fit perfectly
5.0,"I purchased this shoe for my daughter who has a long, narrow foot.  They are the best fitting sandals I’ve ever bought her.  They fit her foot like a glove, they were true to size, and they were supportive.  She loves the soft leather straps.  If you have a kid with a narrow foot, look no farther!  These are the best!"
5.0,"These tights are So comfortable, finally great tights for for a plus size woman. They are thick, stretchy and strong. The sizing is right on. They are thick and a mostly opaque on me. I have no fear of runs just by putting them on. My new favorite pair of tights. The package saves you money as it comes with two pair."
5.0,Really well made good quality for a good price
5.0,"This is one of, if not the best costume I've ever purchased.  My daughter and I love it.  It's soo WELL MADE and the material is VERY comfortable. She had an opportunity to wear it twice. I hope I can shrink enough by next Halloween that I can wear it!! Also, we added the veil, it does not come with costume."
5.0,Better than I had hoped
5.0,Love this bracelet. Ordered in black and red. Had to order more because my family loved them as well. Makes a wonderful gift.
5.0,"Hubby gives this jacket high rating for fit , look, construction, pocket placement ,warmth and weight .<br />Those are the things that he is always looking for. He is such a hard person to get used to new jackets.<br />I had to force him to put it on at first , now I have to pry it off him so I can wash it . He wears it , even if it is not really that cold out  , he says it’s perfect, not too hot. Go figure !<br />All I can say is that I am thrilled about how easy this is to wash and how nice it comes out of the dryer. I never use fabric softener on fleece . This fleece also doesn’t soak up rain like others. I hope that that quality doesn’t wash out . The fit is perfect !<br />Its a great quality upscale fleece jacket that is breathable, maybe that’s why he doesn’t overheat in it ."
5.0,"These socks were a gift, he absolutely loves them!!"
5.0,These raffia arm ties and legs were exactly as described and just what I needed. Shipping was also extremely quick and arrived before estimate date.
5.0,This is absolutely fabulous..worth every penny
5.0,This look Hot. If tou have read &#34;50 Shades of Gray&#34; you will like this. She has a bunch of<br />outfits she can mix and match with. Goes good with a leash.
5.0,"Love it, I am a tank top girl, nice to find one that is different and a little sexy too."
5.0,It is great so pretty.
5.0,Perfect dress! Light and airy and not too short.
5.0,Very impressed with the fabric and that they don’t ride down at all. Very comfortable but still cute and sexy.
5.0,"Granddaughter loves these. They are in style, as she said.. looked great on her also."
5.0,These swim pants are amazing. My son loves these. Love the color an has not faded one bit.
5.0,Lovely garment. Very feminine.
5.0,"This is one of the best keychains I've seen. The key clip is large and easy to open and close while also being very secure. It looks classy, contemporary and slick. I have my keys grouped by function using the included rings. It couldn't be easier to slide off the groups of keys I don't need. I liked this keychain so much that I bought two more."
5.0,"Foam lined keeps water from getting behind the goggles. They did not fog up either. They do get a little warm while you are wearing them, but they were exactly what I was looking for in ""jet-ski"" goggles"
5.0,Bought for a photo prop. Loved it!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:148c08b159ded2dd3973e4909cc817c4]] Great pair of gloves for cheap. work perfectly well on phone and in the cold. Worth it. No need to spend lots of money of gloves now.
5.0,"Works perfectly, downsized a buffalo skin cowboy hat down to fit perfectly. Plenty of material left over for future resizing as well."
5.0,It fits great its not to tight just right
5.0,5 stars gives this dress no credit. Wore this to an R.Kelly concert and boyyyy was I hott (in a good way of course). It hugged me in all the right places. The dress is made of thick stretchy material and looks and feels high quality. I am 5'3 160lbs bust is 36D and I brought a large although i normally wear a medium. A medium would have been too short seeing as though my butt lifted the back of the dress a bit. Love love loveeee this dress
5.0,"I like it.  Wish the bottom was a bit wider so it would stand up, other wise I like it. Lining is good, exterior (to me) looks like leather.  Color is represented well on screen."
5.0,"This is really an arm sling like another review said. Lol, but that is what I wanted. It's perfect for covering my arms in this summer heat. It's cool enough under the t-shirt. Just what I wanted."
5.0,"Great work gloves.  My husband loves these gloves for the warmer weather.  Lightweight, yet durable."
5.0,I love this sweater! It looks great for the Fall.
5.0,This is my second order. Product is well made.
5.0,The feel of the material & the colors are pretty.
5.0,"The ring arrived about a month sooner than I expected, and came in perfect conditions. Its a little bit painful to put on, but once you get it in , you can barely feel it. It fit my nose perfectly, but I was expecting a paler rose gold, but the rose turned out quite vibrant, but its still very pretty. overall great product. also takes quite a bit of effort to put on, but it is a great product."
5.0,"Fuzzy, warm, and durable. Bought these for the family Christmas party in 2018. Kids are still wearing them! The sizes do run large. I wear an XL in most clothes and found I originally could have used a large in these."
5.0,Fit perfect. Exactly as described. Flattering.
5.0,"I've had this backpack for over a year and have been wearing it almost every day, so far it has held out through the stress of an everyday student."
5.0,This worked great with my guitar. Was nice looking and well made.
5.0,"Absolutely stunning watch band!! I was worried it would look gaudy or tacky and while it is a little ""extra""....it's perfection. I thought I would only use it as a going out band but I've found I never want to take it off.<br /><br />Working the clasp is a bit tricky at first but you get the hang of it even if it is a bit awkward. Totally worth it.<br /><br />I bought this band ""used"" for $7.50 and it looks and acts new (new ones are $23). I ended up buying a second one because it's worth having a back up in case this one fails. I will continue to be a repeat buyer!!<br /><br />BUY IT!!"
5.0,It was perfect. My daughter has wide chubby feet and these were perfect and light weight. Foam texture and not rubber like crocs
5.0,"Got mine quick, fit good, exactly what I was expecting"
5.0,Great shirt will definitely buy more! Love the snaps
5.0,Cutest dress ever!! Love the cream then ombre colors!
5.0,Very regal.  I was surprised how good the quality was considering how inexpensive they were.  I am considering buying more for gifts later.
5.0,I liked the product it was a little wide but that’s good because My granddaughter has wide and flat feet. So that little bit of extra width was actually was blessing.
5.0,Great shirt. Wore it for the holidays. Almost like an authentic hockey shirt. Great price.
5.0,Exactly what my husband wanted. Fits perfectly.
5.0,"Bought this for travel but will use all the time. Attractive and compact, holds everything I need.  Love the navy color and the pretty lining also."
5.0,Inspiration for my daughter
5.0,I read reviews and ordered the size up and it fit perfectly. Long enough too and I'm 5'9&#34;.<br />Looks more expensive than it is for sure. Color and quality nice.
5.0,It is slimmer than my other wallets. Design is efficient.
5.0,"I now own about six pairs of these glasses. After about a year these are still my favorite for comfort, durability and yes-- style! I had to replace a pair that I damaged, so I couldn't pass up this two-for-one deal."
5.0,"Cute bracelets, cannot attest to the durability since they are given as gifts. Will say they appear to be a good value for the money and a very cute bracelet.makes a nice gift for caregivers whether a public or private facility."
5.0,"Great, chic earrings light weight and fashionable."
5.0,We needed this dress for my sister in law who is very petite.  Dress was perfect. Color was exactly the way it shows. Wash it the next day and hung up to dry. Stayed the same color and size. Very nice product.
5.0,My husband loves it! I continue to add to his collection every so often. I need this one for my collection as well
5.0,Love these Leggins will be ordering more
5.0,The product fits and works perfectly.
5.0,very comfortable fit
5.0,My husband bought me these as a surprise. I love it. Quality is awesome. You won't be disappointed.
5.0,I’ve been on the hunt for a new Apple Watch band the past few weeks after getting dermatitis for the typical Apple Watch silicone band. Another issue for me is that I have the smallest wrists so it’s already hard to find something that’ll fit me.<br />With this being adjustable by taking off links it is perfect! It’s very cute and it’s breathable so no more skin issues :) I’m very happy with it.
5.0,Very comfortable. Fits great and very cool on a hot day.
5.0,Durable and nice
5.0,Beautiful Coat Excellent in every way
5.0,Very Confy!
5.0,"The pajama set is soft, comfortable and fits well. I did not size up and it fit conformably! Washed on regular cycle and tumble dried and it did well! Very nice and good pajama set!"
5.0,Love this set! Beautiful set that was ordered to add color for the wedding date for a bride! Price was great and the shipping was cheap and quick! Thank you so much!
5.0,"I've never been one for buying MLM products and refused to support them. The leggings these resemble are soft, creamy feeling to the touch - and I wanted them but not at that price. I'm a bigger girl, just had a baby a month ago and still losing weight, and the plus size leggings from LuLaRoe (which can I just say that Queen size is kind of insulting to me?) did not seem to have as much give. I'm approximately a size 16-18 (the mid rise skinny in 16 from Old Navy fits me snugly and Levi's Jeggings fit perfectly in a size 16) for reference. I carried most of my weight from waist down pre pregnancy and am mostly back to normal after my csection.<br /><br />I pulled these out after they arrived after a long day at the clinic I work at, and it's cold as hell outside. WOW. So soft. Like better than LuLaRoe soft! They fit well and are cozy, comfortable, and the tribal pattern is fun and will be a great layering option with all my green flowy long tops.<br /><br />I need ten more pairs of these and will be ordering more. And telling my friends about them. And likely getting the fleece ones because my clinic is cold as hell."
5.0,I especially like the adjustable straps.
5.0,"Soft T-shirt feel and generous sizing. Haven't dried them yet to see if they will shrink, but I assume they will and ordered a little bigger to allow for that. Very comfortable and not too short."
5.0,I'm in love with this bra!! I wear a 36DDD so it's hard to find nursing bras! This offers a good amount of support for having no under wire! And my husband loves the soft fabric!
5.0,"I’m 4’11” tall, and finding an outfit that I do not need to alter. For my height this fits well. I am pleased"
5.0,Very comfortable and really keeps my head warm during cold days and cooler during warm days.
5.0,"Good product , sheilds you from wind."
5.0,Looks great and doors better
5.0,"What a beautiful dress! I have NEVER bought a dress from Amazon just for the fear of it not fitting well or looking cheap. I could not of been any happier with this purchase! I got so many compliments and the dress fit perfectly. I am 5’6”, about 150 lbs and a medium for me perfect! Definitely recommend and for the price you cannot go wrong!"
5.0,I love these earrings!  The colors that are included are nice and I love the shape.
5.0,My 11 yr old daughter loves it!  The headband stays in place and looks cute. The girls on her team all really liked it too.
5.0,"This set is so adorable!! The fit is great, the material is nice and soft. My daughter adores the kitties on the set."
5.0,"Just purchased these in black.  Love them!  I've worn them all day at work several times now and my feet don't hurt at all.  The leather is beautiful, the gold band at the top of the heel is beautiful and they look very classy and stylish. I can easily slide my foot in, thanks to the stretchy elastic.  The fit as expected and aren't to narrow or too short.  I have slightly wide feet (I'm related to ducks), so sometimes I have problems with shoes running too narrow.  Not these.  My only problem with these booties is the in-step.  I have a very high in-step and they're a little tight across the top of my foot.  This isn't a problem with the shoe, it's just my duck feet.  If you also have a high in-step, it's something to consider.  I'm hoping they'll stretch out soon (I've only had them one week) and this won't be a problem.  Will definitely buy more of these in different colors."
5.0,"I am allergic to nickel, and the metal in these earrings did not set off my reaction, which is severe. And they are just lovely. I lost one of mine somehow, and am returning to buy a second pair. I love them. Of course, Z means something to me that it might not mean to others. I have other Tini Lux earrings, and none of them set off my allergy."
5.0,Beautiful and easy to adjust.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter.  The pink sweater is beautiful!  The color is bright and very pretty.  It is super soft.  Hers fit great.
5.0,The material held everything in very well. Very comfortable. I ordered a size XL.
5.0,"Love this dress so much, and always get lots of compliments on it.  Would definitely order again!  Fits TTS - I'm 5'7&#34;, 160 and ordered a large.  Fabric is nice quality, goes all the way to the ground, as maxis should."
5.0,Nice pretty dress
5.0,Love it. Fits great and so soft
5.0,"Fit perfectly over my mouth, nose, and chin."
5.0,I freaking love this dress. A friend of mine wore it and I had to have it immediately!! The material is quality and it’s fun to scrunch it up or leave it long.
5.0,I got these earrings for my daughter. This is her favorite color. I now can't get her to take them off lol. She is 10 going on 19 and is all about looking right for school. They made her happy and now several of her friends would like a pair. Although I was asked to review this product it has been above expectations and justly rewarded with my daughters happiness.
5.0,Shrunk slightly but I needed it to so that was perfect
5.0,"These O rings are the perfect size for my crafting projects. They are strong, lay flat, and are  a great value when bought in bulk. I will be purchasing again for my spring line. An added bonus was they arrived in less than 24 hours! Amazon you rock!"
5.0,"I purchased the red grid pant in a size small. The material is that of slacks, thick but comfortable. They fit perfectly. I am 5'4"" and 110 pounds. I dig the punky look they give. Very cute and worth the price"
5.0,I Have had for 5 years as the first day.
5.0,Good thick material and made well
5.0,Just as described. I wear a ladies 7.5-8 and they fit well.
5.0,Love it real stones. Feel the greatness from the bracelet
5.0,Super cute! Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,This pair arrived on time and was exactly what we wanted.
5.0,Husband looked very nice for his daughter floral theme 1st birthday.
5.0,Only sunglasses i wear
5.0,"good material ,good fit"
5.0,I chose this for a friend and I could not be happier with this item! It is well made and is packaged with positive sayings and a cloth to polish it with jewelry maintenance instructions.  It is all so positive that it makes you smile!  I will definitely purchase from Ahaeth Jewelry again!!
5.0,"Great value for the cost. Bought as a cheap alternative for cloth diapers to wrap my daughter in to help with diaper rash, the material is breathable but absorbent to help air out her rash. I would recommend to anyone."
5.0,"Nice, soft, comfortable"
5.0,"This ring is nice. It's not too flashy which is great. You don't need to spend lots of money on a wedding band for it to be really nice, functional and practical. I recommend this to anyone looking for a alternative wedding band. I received this product for free in return for my honest review."
5.0,I love this dress cute and comfortable and I received so many compliments.
5.0,I bought these socks for my husband.  He needed longer socks suring the cold weather.  He said that these are very comfortable socks and says they fit great.  The design is great with any type of pants.  They can be worn with dress slacks or casual.  They work nicely with his attire.
5.0,"Beautiful colors, fit as expected, I love it!! So glad I purchased this one!"
5.0,Dress is a little loose. But very comfortable and Breastfeeding friendly. I love the pockets and will be ordering more in other patterns/colors.
5.0,The price was good and the item itself was great. I was afraid it might not look good but I love it. It was worth it.
5.0,"My husband decided his $300 band from the jeweler didn't fit (thanks, dude) and so I figured I'd test out another size before we re-ordered the real one.  This one looks exactly like his real one.  Jewelry store rings are a total racket."
5.0,i really like it; im glad its not plastic for this price
5.0,"Really cute shirt, it's a little see through so you might want to wear something underneath. Otherwise super soft and it washed up great"
5.0,Cute shirt. Runs small
5.0,Great slacks. A little long  Very comfortable
5.0,"These pants make my butt look perfect. They are little tight, im talking I popped the butt seam putting them on. but I restitched them and now they are great. The fabric is a decent quality. I haven't noticed and fraying aside from the one split seam. I would buy again."
5.0,Perfect midriff shirt for me. Shows a small amount of tummy but not too much. Goes cute with shorts or pants! And the decal is subtle but perfectly simple
5.0,I got both the v-neck crop length and the high neck full length styles in black. The v-neck has tons of reviews so I took the advice and sized up 2 sizes and the fit was good. The high neck style didn't seem to have any reviews so I sized up in that style too and it was much too big! It is a very loose fit so stay true to your size or size down for a more fitted look in that style. They're both so cute!
5.0,Really cute for our party guests! Very sturdy!!
5.0,"I love this sleevey wonder.  It is light and soft.  Does not bunch up or ride up on your body.  I hope it will last a long time because $50 is a little high for me, but so far I do not regret a dime.  So many sleeveless tops and dresses that looked so bad with my arms showing that I wouldn't wear them ... I am now wearing with confidence and  pleasure.  Thank you."
5.0,"This is s big box of big taps, but they’re perfect."
5.0,"Gorgeous dress, fit as expected. Will be perfect for my traditional german attire photoshoot and video."
5.0,"This was just what I was looking for, a stylish watch for everyday.<br />Really love it!  I would recommend."
5.0,"Very nice quality belt. Not a dress belt, but a great work belt."
5.0,Looks exactly pictured (I ordered black) and the decal is really clean. It was worth every penny and will definitely last a long time.
5.0,i ordered 7-8 and they sent 8-9 which is not even in the size chart..........it looks good ....the yellow is not exact yellow but with a little orange tint in it...but more on the yellow side.....its perfect my daughter is 4 ft n 6 yrs ...its perfect size on her 8-9 yrs one  if it was 7-8 the it would have shorter in length.......
5.0,Excellent Fit made of high quality material
5.0,Good I can fix it. I like it. Thanks
5.0,My daughter is a big Dr. Who fan. She loves this necklace. The Tardis will pop loose from the mount on occasion but it is very simple to put back in place. The fact that the Tardis spins is really cool. The necklace is a good solid piece but a bit on the heavy side. The option metal box is a very nice touch.
5.0,This shirt is great quality and is a perfect fit! I love the pattern and looks cute with jeans and booties!
5.0,Good cheap sunglasses for a school event
5.0,It's a great item
5.0,"Favorite Durga, wish there were more colors. Very durable as well...."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:13a533589ff85834d25b6d3bd123edf]] I'm not sure if these masks will stop the plauge any more than any other, but they'll definitely help you die of laughter."
5.0,"I received my socks today, right on time! They are just what I was looking for to wear with my Halloween costume this year! The quality is very good!!"
5.0,Got this for my mom. It is TTS. The color is as pictured and a great spring shirt. My mom likes it a lot because it’s 3/4 sleeves so she doesn’t have to wear a sweater with it. The sleeves were hold up with pearls (which was not very visible in the picture) which add an elegant element to it!
5.0,Well made caps that stand up to machine washing and several years of hard use...
5.0,So i live in Hawaii where shipping takes forever normally. My Gi arrived ahead of time and it is sturdy af... i wear it every evening to train in. I do weapon training and got hit a few times with a sword. It didnt bother it one bit. Im 5'11 206lbs. And i ordered a size 6. It was on the big side so i stuck it in the wash and dryer to get it just right.
5.0,I love the light weight material perfect for summer
5.0,"This coat is just what the wife needed. I have trusted Land's End clothing for decades. Quality materials in all their product lines. Shoes, shirts, jackets, coats, rain wear. you can certainly count on them to be a valued addition to your wardrobe.."
5.0,My toddler loves these AND they are so much more attractive than your normal kid sunglasses (plus they protect his eyes and all that good stuff). We love them and have them in two colors! Highly recommend.
5.0,"I wear a size large and xl. I ordered medium. Which looked and felt perfect. I read in some of the reviews that the arms and chest was too tight. Let me just say this, I have huge arms but it fit PERFECTLY! I got a bunch of compliments and I sure in heck ordered one more color lol ✌💙"
5.0,They are underwear and work fine
5.0,"I Love it. It fits great. I’m 5’6”, 34D, 170lbs and ordered a large. It’s sexy. It is a mini dress so keep that in mind but super cute. I have an hourglass body shape. Hope this helps."
5.0,Excellent affordable black tie. Not as cheap feeling as some have claimed...not sure what they were expecting? This thing looks great!
5.0,Very cute pajama set!! My daughter is 7 and a string bean so the adjustable straps on the top are great. It’s still a little big on her (sz 7-8) so I use a piece of ribbon to pull the straps together and tie a bow. Helps keep it in place. It’s a cotton set so it’s breathable on these hot summer days. It’s been washed several times and held up perfectly with no fading or shrinking or issues with the stretchy straps becoming loose or tighter. The bottoms could be worn as regular underwear under any outfit. She wears this at least once a week!
5.0,Can't find something better for the price
5.0,Everything you want in a coat! 100% recommend!!
5.0,Kids said these masks really comfortable and soft materials. What more can you ask for?
5.0,"I love this set.  The stones are very shiny and the settings are very nice.  The set was not expensive so I was not expecting much.  The quality was better than expected.  It matches a ring and bracelet that I also purchased on Amazon.  The earrings have clasp that holds the earring secure on the ear which should help to prevent them from falling off.  Despite the size, they are not overly heavy on the ear either which was a concern I had before purchasing.  They also come in a nice box in case you want to give as a gift."
5.0,Ordered as a gift. Recipient loves it. We were skeptical when buying this and expected it to be cheap quality. We were surprised to see how good the quality was. It was also bigger than expected and was really beautiful.
5.0,Love them. I gave trouble keeping glasses up without nose pads.  These fit perfect
5.0,"The belt tightening is a little tricky and you will get use to it.  They hold up and don’t slip.  The belt latch where you tighten has an extra snap type that makes the buckle seat further in and allows the buckle to be straight with the belt. The buckle can come loose if you drop it on a hard surface but is easy to put back on and locks.  Heat belt for shorts and someone who needs it to stay on without slipping.<br /><br />Make sure you snap the buckle or it will look and feel awkward, I didn’t know this for awhile and it felt odd."
5.0,"Bought it for CW reenacting more than a year ago as i recall, and so far it has been satisfactory, keeps good time."
5.0,Great quality product.. love it!
5.0,Love it just then right size perfect
5.0,"super comodo, no pesa nada, lo recomiendo."
5.0,THIS RING IS BEAUTIFUL.  IT IS AN ODD SHAPE ON MY FINGER BUT IT IS ATTRACTIVE AND I LOVE IT.
5.0,"I’m normally a large/extra large.  In this jacket the 2XL fits perfectly.  The quality is great for the price.  One oddity is these UK products have left side zippers.  I guess I shouldn’t be surprised since they drive on the wrong side of the road!<br /><br />Overall, it’s a good value, looks nice and has the features I was looking for at an amazing price."
5.0,Wonderful set
5.0,This outfit is THE WORST THAT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT.  I bought a small and I was still drowning in it. I looked like I was pregnant! HIGHLY UPSET AND VERY MAD. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE. ITS ASHAME BC THE PICS LOOK LIKE IT WOULD BE A CUTE OUTFIT. PICTURES ARE DECEIVING
5.0,Great for my number 11
5.0,It fits perfectly on my small wrist. Quality is very good and very easy to adjust.
5.0,These socks DO wick moisture!  These socks DO stay up all day!  These socks look and wear great wash after wash!  The price is excellent!  These socks ARE super comfortable even wearing all day!
5.0,"It took a while to get the dress after I ordered it.<br />I honestly expected it to be kind of billowy with a lighter material.<br />Once I tried it on I really loved it, but it was way too large for me.<br />I started a return but the seller contacted me to ask what they could do to make it right.<br />They are sending me a smaller size, and told me to keep the dress that I had already received.<br />Super fast to respond as well.<br />I would definitely buy it again, and I will update when I get my new dress."
5.0,"Absolutely love this rain coat, I use it all the time and it keeps me dry off or on my Harley."
5.0,Getting over shin splints and running with the compression socks takes the pain out of running. They compress but feel good and quite stylish.
5.0,"They look so pretty and stylish I’ve already gotten so many compliments and asked where I got it from, the one thing I have to say that was a bit of a struggle was actually putting them on for the first time but once you have a systematic way of putting them on it’s all good but over 10/10"
5.0,Good looking handbag!
5.0,This is a well made leather wallet with the RFID protection and you just can't beat it. I got in in the red and it's perfect for me. Highly recommend this wallet!!
5.0,My old purse was a Fossil purse.  Held up great but was way too heavy - 3+ lbs empty. This Coach purse is much lighter and holds all of my diabetic supplies without breaking my back.  I'm very glad I got it!
5.0,These fit actually like the rest of one 5 one capri's I have bought.  I love all the colors they came in.  Great price and washes great.
5.0,Very nice bought for my son for upcoming wedding
5.0,Warm and perfect for any Tots fan
5.0,"Haven’t had them for long but first impression they are pretty awesome, especially for the price. Sizing seems accurate, got a size 7 which is my real band size and the fit was perfect. I love that you can stack them and the color options as well, might have to add more into the collection over time."
5.0,"I am a framer.  My buddy told me about this product. This skate plat works unbelievably well on wet wood surfaces. It doesn't stick and drag. I have also used it a lot to cut CMU block, and I'm stoked with the way my saw sails across any surface. I highly recommend this product... It makes your job easier, and your lines clean."
5.0,My sixteen-year-old bought this for me for mother's day I love it it's so beautiful I have it in my room to look at everyday a must-have Rose that will never die that you can keep seeing the beauty of it over and over again. 😊
5.0,I love the way these tops fit. I have ordered two already. I would order more but they dont have in stock the other ones that I like. I will order more when they come in stock.
5.0,"My son was in desire need of a new robe. Picked it out, put it in the cart, and bam, at my door step. Fit perfectly. Easy peasy."
5.0,These are good glasses for the kids and it  fits and looks good..
5.0,Very cute but does not hold up well even in delicate wash.
5.0,"Ordered these for the Monster Ball and have used them for numerous costumes ever since. Great price, great look always."
5.0,I love that you make comfortable compression socks for fat women they do the job but not painful definitely ordered more keep making them pretty

5.0,The girls are loving it.. Thank you!
5.0,"From the woman of the house: my husband got this for me and I really love it! It’s my new favorite winter jacket. I usually wear a large in something like this, got it in that size, and it fits just right – reasonably form-fitting, without being too tight. I like that it has a detachable hood. I can use it when the wind is blowing, or zip it off before I go shopping. While it feels lightweight, it provides excellent warmth and comfort. The outer shell is nylon and the lining is polyester. There are lots of pockets! I enjoy the length – covers my butt, which keeps me warm. I also like that there’s an adjustable inner cinch around the waist, so I shaped it to my body. It’s well designed and sewn, with thoughtful touches like the reflective strip across the back shoulders.<br /><br />I am a little concerned about the quality of the main zipper. I'm not sure how long it will last. However, so far so good.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Very well made , great fit high quality shirt , i can't wait to order more ,<br />if your looking for a great fitting shirt this is the way to go !!!!!"
5.0,"fits well, easy to workout in"
5.0,Adorable gift to give ♡
5.0,Great product to protect your glasses.
5.0,The material is comfortable and they wear well I just wish they made larger sizes. I’d definitely buy more.
5.0,It is convenient and it works perfect for me!
5.0,"Honestly, I can't recommend this product enough. Gone are the days of worrying that you'll bleed through your underwear, gone are the days of stains, and gone are the days of asking your friends to check your behind every ten minutes.<br /><br />I tend to have a very heavy flow for a few days during my period, and I've NEVER been able to avoid staining my underwear without wearing the bulkiest pad imaginable - and even then, half the time it folds and sticks to itself and I'll bleed on the underwear anyway. Well, no more of that! These underwear are, as far as I know, one of the lighter options offered by this company, and they still didn't fail me a single time. I tested both with a menstrual cup and with nothing, and both times I was protected. The absorbancy of these is insane, and they remain very comfortable. The lining is slightly thicker than a standard pair of underwear, and I will say that the seam from the lining across the booty is a a bit thick, but neither of these things affected the comfort for me. They also don't suffer from the ""peed your pants"" feeling that makes me hate pads, and the odor control is better than most pads I've tried. I have no idea what these things are made out of, but they're magic and I implore every single person who has a period to try them or something similar."
5.0,I love this dress so much. When I first opened the bag I thought it would have been too big but when I tried it on I was instantly in love. I will most definitely update when I wear it out. I want more colors now! Im 5ft1 200lbs and bought a 2xl. Its loose but still fitting ans hides my tummy. My bust is a full 38H. I could have done an 1xl but sized up in case it was unpleasantly tight.
5.0,These are very nice. They look like very expensive glasses. Love them!
5.0,It was perfect. Just what I needed.
5.0,"Socks work great, they do run big. I am 6'2 and the socks go just over my knees. On-)N"
5.0,I purchased these for use playing pool. Many locations have florescent lighting that creates a glare or reflection on billiard balls. These lenses greatly reduce this and are very comfortable to wear.
5.0,These were perfect! Very warm!
5.0,Very nice product exactly as advertised.  Fits in pocket nicely although a bit thicker than I expected.  These are pricy for 'readers.'
5.0,My nephew loves this costume

5.0,Appreciated the price point on this one.  My daughter is thrilled it’s Vera Bradley.
5.0,"I love this black dress and want it in every color.  The sleeve length and pockets are perfect.  It was too long on my 5'4, 160 lb frame.  I bought a size large and hemmed it up 2 inches and it is still grazing my toes."
5.0,"This bag is not the normal super soft hobo leather.  It has a little more body to it.  The bag is awesome.  It isn't as big as I was expecting.  It is a little heavy, but it has so many great pockets and a beautiful interior.  It has a nice padded pocket for electronics.  Two front pockets are super roomy with an extra pocket in the top with a zipper and a slip pocket on the back.  I am a big hobo fan, and this bag did not disappoint!!"
5.0,I adore this charm! It's sparkly and sooo pretty! Larger than I expected but not inappropriately or obnoxiously large
5.0,Love these tank tops
5.0,"This a great looking, inexpensive watch. It looks to cost far more than it does. The shipping was fast. It looks so nice that I purchased the Ritche 4PC 20mm Nato Straps to go with it. The straps allow me to easily change the color of the band for different looks. Well worth the price."
5.0,Excellent jersey! Great fit.
5.0,Received the cowboy hat as promised by Amazon and it fits very comfortably.Now I can take walks with it to save me from the sun.Most importantly I will be singing with my guitar and thus will make me look good.

THE"" BIGGEST"" BOX STORES HAS CHEAP SWEATSHIRTS THAT PILE AND SHRINK..THIS SWEATSHIRT FIT BEAUTIFULLY AND HE REALLY ENJOYS IT.<br />IT DOES NOT PILE LIKE THE CHEAP ONES DO AND HOLDS ITS COLOR.

5.0,Fit as expected and really cute shorts.
5.0,Great shirt. My kids wear them to school and don’t have to worry about misplaced masks. It’s built in!!!  Pretty brilliant design.
5.0,"Thanks Grinder Punch for getting this to me the next day! First of all. They seem pretty sturday, I tugged on them a little and squeezed them. Looks they'll last. The lens are slightly darker than I was expecting and they of course make everything look yellow but I like them a lot. My head's not that huge so they fit nicely."
5.0,Slimming!!
5.0,It's ok. Well worth it
5.0,Hard to put on but do the job

5.0,"Cozy, soft and comfortable! Love the wide waistband and cuffs!"
5.0,Bought these for a dark blue blazer for my son.  They make the blazer look great.
5.0,Just got these today and threw them on! They were very very comfy! You will not regret buying ;)
5.0,Super cute! Definitely small but considering I've got 32DDs it's not unusual for shirts to be small around the bust. Normally I wear a medium in shirts but got a xl as per other reviews. Still fairly tight. The white is a little see-through but I personally don't mind.
5.0,What a great set of earrings for the holidays.
5.0,Super cool glasses! This is my second pair! These are my faves to wear when I am on a cruise - you can still see out of them easily while inside!

5.0,My favorite dress fit perfect
5.0,Amazing! I love it so much!

5.0,Nice product but hoops were extremely small.
5.0,Just what I wanted to look like the Hanson Brothers from the Slap Shot movie. Although a lot of people say I look like Bubbles from the Trailer Park Boys.
5.0,Purchased for my daughter.  No complaints
5.0,I have. Fitbit Versa 2 and needed a new strap for it. With my job I needed one that is easy to use and secure plus water resistant.  These ones give you multiple colors and could change it out quickly. I have found it stays on well and I like I can adjust the Velcro to be tight or lose on my wrist. Taking it off to recharge is simple as well. The price is also a bonus.
5.0,"I would easily give this product 10 stars.  Beautiful, excellent quality!"
5.0,"My dad is a truck driver so I had no clue what to get him. This was the perfect gift!!! It is not like I can get him something for his house becuse they live in a truck 11 months out of the year, yet I still got to show him my appreciation for being such an amazing dad. It arrived quickly and the quality was wonderful. It was also very true to size."
5.0,Love the color and works perfect
5.0,Jacket to leave at daycare for outdoor activities.
5.0,Le quedaron perfectas a mi princesa 😘😍
5.0,"I've tried many of these glasses stoppers and these are but far the best yet. I have large heavy frames that like to slide down my nose which is why I was on the hunt for them. They have the best shape, not too big, not too small. The only thing that bugged me was for first few days they put some pressure behind my ears but so worth it in the long run."
5.0,"This was a birthday gift for my brother-in-law, and he loved it. He wears two types of baseball caps, Dallas Cowboys and Army, so this meant a lot to him."
5.0,I love the little devils. It was bigger than I expected but I use it everyday. The strap adjuster broke on me but I just used safety pins and it gets the job done.

5.0,I just received my shirt it is so cute looks identical to the pic...my boyfriend ordered in his account..I didn't expect to receive it for another couple of weeks so I'm very happy...My breast are 40d waist 32' I wear 15 in jeans so very large bottom...I ordered xxlarge fits perfect💞
5.0,"I recently purchased a 2020 Porsche 911 Carrera S Cabriolet.  I picked the sweatshirt to ""Represent""."
5.0,"Great quality ! I however don't like them on my face frame , but the quality is amazing"
5.0,"This is the best, most classy, expensive looking inexpensive watch that I have ever owned. My watch did not come in a box, that doesn't bother me one bit. For the people stating that the watch can't be adjusted, it can be adjusted very easily just by prying up the lock mechanism and sliding it along the band to your desired length and then locking it back in place.<br />***** Then, and this is very important......PAY ATTENTION!!!!  The watch comes NOT working to protect the life of your battery......Remove the thin, clear plastic protective sheet from the watch frame making sure you remove the bit that's holding the stem also, then, set the watch and push in stem and that's it .....watch is working and youre off to the races.******..<br />To the manufacturers, this is a BEAUTIFUL watch and I love it and would recommend it to anyone and will definitely be making gifts to my friends and family members. THANKS YOU!!!"
5.0,"Amazing boots, for an amazing price. So much better quality and style than what you find in stores... and trust me, I shop a lot haha. My boyfriend agrees, he's the one who wears them. Says they are comfy and worked amazing for when he was working the winter season x games in aspen. Feet were dry and warm despite the snow coming down. Light weight and still feel tough. Worth it!"

Having a rather well endowed chest I have always steered clear of off the shoulder dresses but I'm so glad I took a chance on this one. I simply tightened my bra straps and let them rest lower down my shoulders than the cut of the dress and you couldn't tell at all. I didn't feel the fabric shifting around despite lots of dancing and the only thing I had to fidgit with was the sash about halfway through the evening, which is sort of expected.<br /><br />I LOVE this dress, and my boyfriend has requested that it make another appearance in the future."

I dont think it's a dress for a picnic. Very nice.tjis does run bigger then expected. This dress definately in a darker color hides the body bumps.  I ordered a size that I normally wear and needed a smaller size-1 size down

It really is a very cute bathing suit and it fits as expected. I am a size small and it fits like a small should fit. I love the colors of this as well. The backing of the top is super super cute but I'm not going to lie, I did tangle myself a little bit lol. Other than that, I really do love this! Love the bottom and how it's adjustable.<br />**I received this item at a promotional rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

5.0,"For starters, they shipped the belt in an awesome box with a gift bag and cloth (that's right cloth) carry bag, probably for when you travel, you can place the belt in the bag for safe keeping. See photos<br /><br />Second, the belt is quite innovative: it has a locking mechanism that gives you infinite sizing, which is perfect if your weight fluctuates at all.<br /><br />Did I mention, I love this belt?<br />I highly recommend."
5.0,okay... i took a chance getting this dress and i’m so in love with it!! i’m going to wear this to my high school graduation and it fits like a glove! i’m 5’5 ish and weight around 140 and  wear a medium. i got a large just in case it fits perfect! GET THIS DRESS!

5.0,I have really chunky ankle and it fits.
5.0,Perfect skirt for the fall. Fit is snug so be sure of your size.
5.0,"This is a beautiful bag. The dark gray with the tan contrast is very rich looking, and I love the thick canvas material. I also like the multiple strap options: crossbody, arm/shoulder handles and grips to pick it up with your hand. There are three or so zipped pockets inside and, a bonus to me, a snap pocket on each end (total of two) which is great for conveniently holding a phone, small camera, sunglasses, small water bottle, keys ... just about anything you want to keep conveniently by. It seems very well made -- the zippers are strong and work well. I do wish it were a little smaller for most of my uses, but I do admit it holds books and files, which comes in handy. And it's convenient to carry. I am not sorry I ordered it!"
5.0,My baby sister loves them !

5.0,I am 5’6 125lbs and the small fit great. Purchased for 70’s day at work and got many compliment. The material is very very soft and I will likely wear it as a regular tee.
5.0,Un grosor
5.0,"Raincoat rolls up to a very small size, easy to pack.  Took it on my trip to Belize.  Fortunately I didn't need it, but it was no problem to bring it along on a boat trip, catamaran cruise and while hiking."
5.0,Super cute summer dress.  As pictured.
5.0,"This dress is incredibly silky and lovely.  The fabric is a bit thin and see thru.  But, it's so soft and silky that I don't care.  The negative?  The ends of the lacing string are unfinished.  That's easy to fix, though.  And, I think this will wear quickly given the delicate fabric.  I think it will fray where you brush against rough surfaces."
5.0,"I purchased this dress for a pageant that my 9 year old daughter was in (for a high school event).  The dress was so great, it really went above my expectations for the price. The dress is super fluffy and so elegant.  Only downfall is where the tulle meets the top you can see where it was just tied on around the elastic waste band.  Also cannot wear dark underwear underneath as you would for sure be able to see it.  We purchased a pair of gelly shoes on amazon to go with the dress, they were like cinderella and were so beautiful!"
5.0,"Beautiful shades of my favorite color, orange.  The setting is a little larger scale than I expected but not statement ring."

5.0,"Beautiful dress ,great quality fabric,fits so nicenicely on me,ty"

5.0,Softer than I thought! Thin and perfect for summer. I wear L-XL and ordered as such and it fits perfect. The stretch is nice and it looks so cute on. 5/5

5.0,"These gloves are AWESOME!<br />Extremely satisfied, perfect fit...<br />LIKE A GLOVE 😁"
5.0,I had been searching for an anklet for awhile when I saw this one. I really had no idea what I was looking for until I saw this & it has lived up to my hopes & expectations. I love it! It has the laid back feel of the beach mixed with the charm & beauty of my gypsy soul. A perfect blend of materials & design...thank you!
5.0,Comment from my wife: I love these! The golden and silver ones are my favorite. They add so much to summer/spring look. My friends loved them! It does pinch a little too hard but as long as I am not wearing them for more than 5-6 hrs it’s okay. I remember wearing it a full day once and the area got a little red and painful. Won’t do that again. Great for pairing with a dark make up look for few hours.
5.0,I got these to decorate a wedding cake. Worked wonderfully.
5.0,Excellent Jackson Browne tee shirt. Looks like a concert tee shirt!
5.0,Perfect for dips and pull ups. It is so comfortable. I travel often and bring this with me.

5.0,Kind of see through so keep that in mind
5.0,"It's fits true to size, by the arm area it fits a tad bit snug bUT otherwise it's very comfortable. The material is soft and it's great material , it doesn't look cheap at all. Fast shipping. It only took like 4-5 days. I would definitely recommend. A fashion steal for sure 😊😊😊"
5.0,Soft comfy cozy warmth..exactly what I was looking for! Also retain their shape and do not fall apart in the washing machine. I did not dry them in the clothes drier.
5.0,Cool key chain!
5.0,"Absolutely DELICIOUS fabric!! Love this dress!! I am a size 6, and it fits beautifully. I cannot wait to wear it this fall/winter!"

5.0,So cute and realistic!!! Will not find anything better for the summer style!!

5.0,"[[ASIN:B073Y7VSXW Fairy Collection Ombre Dark Root 45CM Long Curly Women Lolita Anime Cosplay Wig +Cap (Pastel Purple F19)]] The link provided was the closest color to the actual wig I wore with my pirates costume for Halloween.  This wig really help finish off my costume, and I received a lot of compliments on it."
5.0,"My son loves it,"
5.0,Thank you! :-)
5.0,"I bought these to wear around the house. I have plantar fasciitis and my house has hardwood floors and tile which are really hard on my feet, knees, and back.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant about the price as this is more than I'd usually spend on house shoes. But after only a few days of wearing these, my pain is completely gone!!!<br /><br />And they are so cute that I may purchase a second pair for wearing out!!!<br /><br />They also came with a second pair of insoles which makes them a pretty good value overall.<br /><br />Highly recommend for style and comfort."
5.0,These are very comfortable and manage to fit into most business casual office setting standards. It is nice finding something so comfortable that still belongs in an office setting. Fits as expected and the color was the same as the picture listed.
5.0,I ended up with the XL and they are so comfortable. The pockets are amazing and the length goes almost to my knees. I can even fit these shorts comfortably over my muffin top.<br />I will update this review after I wash the shorts.
5.0,All of the earings were really good. There was one pair that was broken but the rest were good.
5.0,Looks a little dressy and still comfortable
5.0,"This unstructured frock drapes beautifully.  I can dress it up with pearls and heels or down with leggings, flats and a jeans jacket.  A friend who values modest clothing asked me where I found it because she wants something like it for exercise, but I prefer it for the office or out to dinner with a little sweater or blazer, or a draped scarf or shawl.<br />I love it."
5.0,This dress fits perfectly and is very flattering.
5.0,love the softness
5.0,"Love these shoes!  They do fit 1/2 size larger - I am an 8, 7.5 is perfect."
5.0,"Beautiful pattern! I got the yellow and blue flowered one and the yellow is a bit more marigold in person but I'm still in love (dress/pattern otherwise is exactly as pictured)! Its loose but flattering, there's a stitch gathering in the fabric under that bust that makes it come in a little closer and not be billowing about like a maternity dress. The fabric is stretchy but feels like super soft brushed cotton. Seems like great quality! I want it in every color!<br />Oh and I'm 38-33-38 and 5'3&#34; and got a medium. Perfect fit, perfect length for sandals."
5.0,Lo ed the pants
5.0,"These joggers are the best!! I'm really into joggers right now so I have quite a few pairs, and these are among the most comfortable. They are SUPER soft on the inside and outside. They're also really cute! I love the pattern (I decided on Red Flower). I usually wear them as pajamas, but when I'm having a lazy day I'll wear them to run errands or go to class. They fit pretty well and I really like that they're a little loose on my legs but they're a little tight on my waist. (I'm 5'5 and 111 lbs)"
5.0,"Muy bonito, mi hijo se ve elegante y le gusta mucho."
5.0,Great build quality and holding up with daily use so far. Works perfectly with my Moment Case on my iPhoneX... exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,"Looking for a comfortable skirt that’s nice for the summer? This is it, I bought 2 of them 🤗"
5.0,A nice light sweater.  Nothing fancy.
5.0,PERFECT & READY TO USE-THANK YOU
5.0,Comfortable and flattering.  I really like these pants.
5.0,"I now have owned four of these hats.  The only gripe is the fit:  I have a big head and the large fits snuggly, but there is just a bit too much play in the XL.  Despite that, these hats are great!  They are lightweight, dry fast, have a minimal brim to grant as much field of vision as possible while keeping the sun out of your eyes, fold down the middle of the brim, and can be stuffed into a pocket if you need it out of the way."
5.0,"My grandson loves the super heros and the villians..This was a great addition to his collection thank you, He was so excited when he checked the mail and it was there... Love to see he was so thrilled with the outfit..and he loved the mask.. EXCELLENT PRODUCT!! Thank you.. well worth the joy of this costume.."
5.0,"Beautiful and delicate. This is the 3rd pair (different stones each time) I have purchased, and definitely won't be the last!"
5.0,"Very pretty, but I received the wrong size :("
5.0,"Bought for my husband and we were both pleasantly surprised when we received them. They are very good quality, and much nicer than what I expected since they were fairly inexpensive. I would recommend these."
5.0,Rubs small.I returned the size small. Returned it vua UPS.Reordered medium.Fits perfect .Pretty and comfortable.
5.0,"Love, love this dress! It has become my new go-to dress. Dress is extremely flattering and comfortable. The color green is gorgeous. Love the lace detail. I've worn it to a couple events already and will definitely wear it again. Material is giving. Dress can be dressed up or down depending on the event. I wore it to a wedding with a petticoat which made the dress flare more dramatically. I've also worn it without the petticoat for a more casual event. Highly recommend this dress especially given the low price.<br /><br />Purchased XL, typically wear 14-16"
5.0,"It was a Christmas gift for my friend and neighbor, she loved it especially the logo on the front I’M COLD because she is always cold lol"
5.0,"I'm sure lots of ladies and gentlemen have bulging belt buckle issue for years like I did until my coworker introduced me to this buckle free belt.  Wow, what can I say? I like the concept before I even saw the product and love the product when they arrived.  Honestly, it is a great product at least I haven't found any real negatives yet except there is no ring provided like other sellers do to hook to the middle where the buckle should be. I don't think I can go back to the regular belts now.  I wish they would make different widths and more color selection would be great as well."
5.0,"This backpack is amazing. I really don't understand how you can have negative comments to say about it. It may be a bit much for smaller men and I wouldn't recommend this as an everyday bag. I think when it was designed they went back to some sound basics in the approach to a backpack. Not a bunch of compartmentalization, but is large main section with some unique features that really make this bag something special.<br /><br />First, you have a padded well designed compartment for your laptop. I use a surface book pro, which has a 13 inch screen and with the cover on it, I compare it to my wife's Mac book pro. Each can easily be secured in the pocket and it's snug so it remains where you put it. You also have a large zipper that allows access to the entire length of the inner main compartment. So if you have items in the lower parts of the bag you can still have access to them. There are then two &#34;surprise&#34; pockets. One on the outside that  is great for your documents, phone, keys, etc. to allow them to remain separate from the items in the main area. Also, there is another inside small zippered pocket, which Is great for allowing small items to be separated in the main compartment. I use this for my passport, extra batteries, charger, and items that I want to have easy access to but don't want to have to remember where they were packed.<br /><br />The other HUGE , and I use that word this way on purpose, is how scalable this bag is. On my first trip with it I need to take a lot of items to my work apartment in TX, including a full size wireless keyboard, an Alexa Show in the box, large DSLR camera and lens, extra pair of shoes, various clothing items, and a large amount of data devices (multiple external hard drives, cables, chargers). This bag allowed for the expansion to handle all this easily. On the return trip home, I had far less and I packed the items I was bringing home, about a third of what I had on the first trip, and I just rolled the top, adjusted the strap, and I was able to fit this bag in the small personal item measuring slot at the airline.<br /><br />I travel a lot, buisness, outdoor adventures, family trips, all of the various ways you go and need so many different packing options. This bag handles them all. It's classy, tough, and as with all my Orvis gear, backed by a great company. I am very happy with this bag and see it being on every trip I take in the future. Great job Orvis, this bag is a home run."
5.0,Soft fits amazing.  Great material glad to have snagged it. Quality material and great fit
5.0,good fit good pullover
5.0,He is a Vietnam Veteran and likes his toes to breathe. So he always wears sandals even in the Winter Snow! He is very particular so it is hard for him to adopt a particular pair of sandals. But these ones he has adopted and wears every day. I only wish they carried the darker shade in the larger size.

5.0,"Perfect, I love it, fits and feels like original."
5.0,"These are really soft and comfortable lounge shorts. The fabric is thick and the seams are all well-sewn. The pockets are well-sized and can hold a mobile phone easily. I love these for lounging around. I could probably wear them out and about, but I think they are just a bit too casual for that. But they are perfect for lounging around the house when you don't want to wear sweat pants and you want to look a little neater (and still be comfortable).<br /><br />I'd say they are just a tiny bit bigger and looser than your actual size. I usually wear a medium and I could maybe wear a small in this, but I don't think I'd want to."
5.0,I bought this sack to keep my sons extra change of clothes in for school. It's great so far .. I have no complaints

5.0,"Got these stocking for my 9 year old daughter to wear with her flower girl dress for my wedding, loved them, I could of got a bigger size"
5.0,"I origanlly purchased this ring in 2009 when my husband and I got married. This was what he saw in a local jewelry store, same brand and everything! But it was over $400 there! Which is crazy because most men end up loosing their rings, well my husband just lost his so back to amazon of course! And it is even cheaper now then in 2009! such an amazing deal to bad diamond wedding rings weren't such a bargain too! And by the way the ring holds up really well and my husband would use his ring to open bottle caps (such a guy) I would always tell him not to but it didn't matter anyways because this ring is indestructible! Never even got scratched! So if you're worried about buying it because it is so cheap, don't! It really is the quality of a $400 ring that they would sell for that in a nice jewelry store!"

5.0,love it but it stop working i dont see the other hand
5.0,Love the fit and the fabric!
5.0,"These scarves are small and slip over the head easily, like an infinity scarf, only smaller.  The fabric is soft and smooth--very comfortable around the neck.  They also drape very well, and look stylish while covering up your neck from the rays of the sun, which if not protected can age quickly.  The colors are beautiful.  One size fits all."
5.0,"Very cheap but great time piece. Totally UNstylish but for something that reliably tells time and which you needn't worry about if lost, this is the ticket. The band is a bit cheap and will rip after 2-3 years but since so cheap, just buy a totally new one."
5.0,My little man doesn’t mind wearing this hat at all. I love that he is protected from harmful sun rays.
5.0,Perfect  for travel. Zippers are tricky. Because the look like they break but you just need to use both zippers to meet.

5.0,They are the perfect size and exactly what I wanted
5.0,"Nice ring.  I have small hands.  I seem to gravitate the majority of the time to larger stone's.  However, they interfere withe flexion of my PIP joint.  This ring is mooth around the edges.  Only worn for 30 minutes.  Seems pretty comfortable.  Reminds me of the rings 40-50 years ago at the stomp dances we'd go to as a child.  Family friend would bring their collection/wares to show/sell."
5.0,"Great beanie!! Got colors in red, beige, brown, black and grey."
5.0,Nice little gift for my granddaughter.
5.0,"Product was delivered expediently, and in excellent condition.  They look just like pictured and described, and of good quality. This was for my son's senior prom. We had bought him a custom tux and shirt, and the bow tie and cummerbund were of good enough quality to match his tux. I highly recommend this product!"

5.0,"Gave this to my mom for Christmas last year 2020, she loves it and wears it all the time, has not falling apart, still soft and same color."
5.0,"After reading other reviews and finalizing on going with a Large, it fits perfectly! It fits as expected on the chest, shoulders back, and lats. As I am 5'10 205lbs and a slightly wider than normal build, I thought the large would fit too big but it was perfect now and will only fit better as I start putting on muscle. I definitely recommend it."
5.0,I ordered this because I'm a Jason Voorhees collector. This keychain is made strong in quality and the details are awesome. I like how the machette can be removed. Great gift for any Horror movie fan.

5.0,Perfect size and not too short (as typically happens when I purchase skirts)! &#60;3
5.0,Good dress color + style for wedding etc however go up a size if heavy arms or protruding belly or breast
5.0,"age range from 6 months to 36 months age is very large range! My estimate and thinking this thing should fit the 2 years and older very accurately. My kid is now 15 months old and fit him really fine. He has big head and good body growth.<br />Its very warm and super cute. At first its not supper soft but after couple wash it got softer.<br />I like it for the cute shape, nice materials and function well by keeping child head warm<br />don't like the age range i feel like its very broad although they mentioned the head circumference and Size width.<br />I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. If you have any question please leave it in comment section and I will try my best to answer it. Thanks"
5.0,"i’m a porsche newbie (macan), and i was up late night looking for crap i didn’t need and didn’t even know you could do this to fobs.  obsessed!  now...only if my car was pink lol :)"
5.0,Love the skirt and the way it fits
5.0,"Love this!  It is very soft and comfortable.  I did go a size up because I like to swim in my pajamas and it fits like it is my size.  Suggest if you want a perfect fit to go one size up, and if you want to swim go two sizes up."
5.0,I got this for my mother and she can't walk ten paces without someone stopping her to ask where she got it. She loves showing it off at the gym.
5.0,Absolutely love it. Great thumb ring. Butterflies are prone to scratch or catch on things. I can fix that w/ clear Elmer’s glue.
5.0,These a great. They're comfortable and a decent quality for the price.
5.0,"For those girls who want to be extremely comfortable and warm... This will do the trick, and it actually still shows off your booty while longer in the front ;-)"
5.0,So satisfied with these neckchains I ordered a second set ❤
5.0,"PERFECT BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR GRANDSON, AAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++, LOVED THEM ED"
5.0,Came on time.  There are two tops in the box ( Originally I thought only one top).  I am not a person who likes to spend more money on the belt.  This item equals approx. $9 for one belt ( I can switch the top if you like).  I am going to buy one more for my Dad.
5.0,I bought these to add beaded bands.  My friends loved them and thought I was pretty clever.  Christmas is coming. I will order them again.
5.0,Nice gift for my client. Very well made. Worth the purchase.
5.0,My daughter loved them. Fit perfect
5.0,It isn’t heavy and since you have to wear one make it pretty<br />A nice fit
5.0,Slick and high quality.  Arrived quickly.  Love it..
5.0,"I can't express how much I love these pants! They're so soft and comfortable that I ordered two more pairs in different patterns. And even though I typically wear them at home with a t-shirt, it would be easy to dress them up a little and wear them out and about. Highly recommended!"
5.0,Great shirt!  Very roomy fit.
5.0,So cute. I bought an eyemask that matches this almost perfectly and i love it
5.0,Ordered several different sets and this is the second order . Great summer and work out wear. Fit as your normal size and are quality shirts. Comfortable in the sun and active wear
5.0,"Surprisingly it fits as expected!  LOVE the design, it's thin so will need to wear dark colored under-garments.  Will purchase more styles in the future!"
5.0,This was a gift for my Grandson for Christmas. He told me what to get and he is very happy with his new cap.
5.0,Bands are excellent!
5.0,"I really love these , you can wear them anywhere"
5.0,"It's a perfect fit, great length, and I love the quality of the fabric. Will definitely order more!"
5.0,Adorbs as my daughter would say!
5.0,Perfect -unadorned cotton.  Does the thing.
5.0,Disney land
5.0,Cute and soft. As a 5 foot 3 130 pound female it fits well in a small (but I'd like to lose a little bit of weight before wearing it in public). It shows a little belly when you lift your arms and whatnot but I definitely like it.
5.0,I get alot of compliments on it.
5.0,"color coordinate, doesn't ruin hair style"
5.0,"Item received as shown, very pretty mask."
5.0,This is a very soft and well made scarf. Very cute and perfect for my little girl! I think it is more suited for a younger girl due to the stars. But overall we are very happy with this one.
5.0,Very soft and have great support. Beautiful.
5.0,"This is a beautiful medal, excellent quality. The color and likeness are perfect, and the oval shape very flattering."

5.0,"This pack is fantastic. Despite it's small size it holds a solid amount of supplies for a day of hiking and the small compartments are very handy. Love the tightening straps on the waterbottle holders, they were a must use and very helpful - allowing me to bend over and attend to my dogs on our hike without losing my waterbottles."
5.0,Wonderful case! Feel absolutely safe taking my phone everywhere I go now...☺😊😄😉
5.0,My girlfriend absolutely loves her necklace
5.0,"Very Happy! Fits perfectly, and looks great."
5.0,Suuuuuper cute :)
5.0,"Great quality, Great fit!"
5.0,"Rash to install, soft and comfy around the wrist. Great choice."
5.0,"Loved the dress. The sequins were a little itchy, but it was a minor setback. The dress hangs beautifully and is very flattering. I usually wear a size 6 dress and this fit great. It has good stretch to it so I imagine a larger figured girl could make it look good too. Its very long tho. I'm 5'7&#34; and I would have probably had to cut or hem this even with heels on. But for me, thats a plus because I hate when dresses are too short. Unfortunately, my event was cancelled, so I didn't get to wear it. Still loved it though."
5.0,great value the cases that come with the glasses always bend and break fast! this is so good I don'g worry about my glasses anymore!
5.0,Really cute! The shorts were tighter than expected but as a whole I love the way the outfit looked. (I am a size 12 in jeans and 38DD so I’m very curvy) I got many compliments on this outfit... I will order it in other colors.
5.0,"Lovely outfit, several compliments all day long."
5.0,"Love it, it Was like i expected, lot of space the material its really good, im thinking about buying the pink one!"
5.0,Very cool and unique love them
5.0,It’s a little tight around wrist and longer then depicted in picture but works for what I need
5.0,Love everything about this suit. Super comfy and made well.
5.0,Great but I got it and she has two she got one herself I didn't know till I gave it to her
5.0,Very comfy and cheap sandals! I wear them all day around the house.
5.0,Very cute I just disliked that the material was see through
5.0,"Ugh, I LOVE the colors in this scarf! It looks beautiful in my hair!"
5.0,Works perfectly in my MVMT watch. Time will tell how great it is. Will update this if it breaks.
5.0,"Used for bowling banquet favors.  Very well received, people loved them."
5.0,"These socks are nice, high quality materials.<br />Very thick and soft to the touch.<br />I purchased them for my Mom who does at home dialysis and my brother’s girlfriend who is giving birth to my niece this month.<br />They both LOVED them."
5.0,My husband really liked this top on me. I did too as it fit nice in all the right places
5.0,It is beautiful this is size
5.0,Exactly what I was wanting for our teambuilding event!
5.0,I wear size small. After reviewing product descriptions and reviews I purchased size Medium. Even size medium sits tight. I will highly recommend to by 1+ size. I love the color and light breathable material.
5.0,This is such a cute and funny Keychain. It's absolutely perfect! I bought it for my daughter's father for valentine's Day and can't wait to give it to him. It's the perfect gift to make someone laugh. The Keychain is light and thin but very sturdy. I love the color. It's exactly what is shown in the pictures
5.0,"These are so cute, I am sure I will be buying more in the future."
5.0,Fits so cute and it is fun to wear our for halloween or mardi gras. It is not flexible but I think that is a good thing.
5.0,Very pretty and chain complements pendant!
5.0,Ordered on a whim - much to my surprise I think these items are awesome. A teacher trying to change between tie or bow tie now I can add these Tie Collar's - plus my student thinks it cool.
5.0,Good quality and warm.
5.0,Muy suave. Y buen precio
5.0,"Seriously cute top, the light green color is soft, pairs wonderfully with a grey skirt. Classy look at a nice price. The ruffle is flowy without being bulky so this top can be worn in warmer weather comfortably. I especially like the upper arm coverage and the way the ruffle drapes the body is very flattering."
5.0,This was suuuuper cute! Its soft. Good for spring and summer. Lightweight. Can also wear it in the fall with maybe some leggings and a scarf... maybe a cute sweater or cardigan. I'm going to buy as many colors as I can! Sorry you can see the dress in the picture (was out and about) but you can see that its true to color.
5.0,It made my granddaughter the scarecrow look outstanding.
5.0,"Great quality, great design!"
5.0,"I just love my new shirt, color, material description are exceptional. When I saw it , i thought it wouldnt fit one me but was surprised when the size was perfect for me!!!"
5.0,These are adorable and lots of different carebears. My daughter loves them and has loaded up her crocs woth them.
5.0,Truly no show and did not slip
5.0,I love every single thing about this Satchel. Great size. And I have gotten many compliments on the plum color.
5.0,Nice looking pants and fit very well !
5.0,This product is so pretty and shiny. I love it on my bag. It makes the bag look designer. I ordered in many different colors.
5.0,Worked well for my 7 year old
5.0,A little pricy but good quality
5.0,"I did not receive the color shoe that was pictured in my order. But it turned out for the best because I went to a store to try on some shoes to find my size, but was told that the men's shoes do not come in size 39. But I could wear a women's shoe. The sizing is different and I am a 41 in women's sizes. When I saw these on Amazon I wasn't too keen on the color but they were the most masculine of the color options available. But to my surprise the pair I received was were grey and black. I couldn't have asked for anything better. So if you do decide to order a pair online, and you want a specific color I would double check with the seller first.<br /><br />I noticed improvements to my gait straight away, Absolutely love the shoes and don't really want to take them off, because they are so comfortable!!"
5.0,Probably the most comfy top I own.  Love it the colors and garment pattern allow for year around wear.
5.0,I loved that there were different patterns  in this pack.. I did not use them for wearing but used them cut up to cover vases for a wedding.  We had these glass pumpkin vases or candle holder we wanted to lace and my idea was to use the foot of these and it worked perfect.  I can say these held up to being cut up and stretched over the pumpkins.  So I can't give advice about fit but I can say they will hold up to being tugged on and cut on.
5.0,Fabulous!  Love it!  Wore all during the holiday weekend. Thank you.
5.0,"These are my new favorite masks! They cover my whole face comfortably, bright and colorful, and very easy to wash and hang dry. I get compliments on them!"
5.0,Fit well. Broke easily.
5.0,"I bought it for an ex who was a manipulator, user, and photographer. So I'm sure she's getting great use out of it with her new boo!"
5.0,"Dress arrived on time and the army green color is good.  I am 5'7&#34; and about 155 pounds with a pear-shaped body.  The medium is a little tight, but ok.  The dress is an inch or so off the ground.  RBwinner is a good seller."
5.0,These are great. Perfect size and easy to close.
5.0,"My wife is a fan of Thinx's line of period underwear. These Thinx Air line is designed for light flows, with slightly thinner, more flexible fabric and more ""normal"" cuts. A lot of times you don't need the full protection that Thinx's more heavier duty underwear are designed for. These are a good option for the beginning times, before you know exactly when it's going to start, or at the end after the flow is pretty light. It's also a great option if you wear a menstrual cup to catch any stray leaks.<br /><br />My wife likes how light and airy these feel. The ""superberry"" color is kind of a hot pink, which is a fun color. At 5' 4"", 140 lbs, medium fits well.<br /><br />This (and all of Thinx's underwear) requires that you hang dry and do not use a dryer. In my own experience, this is for a very good reason, so do not use a dryer on these. Luckily, being one of the lighter Thinx underwear, these dry relatively quickly in a few hours.<br /><br />We've tried other brands of period underwear, but Thinx seem to last the longest, so while they're expensive, they're worth it."
5.0,"I love these. I have to be careful to wear good arch support, all the time, or I get problems with plantar fasciitis. These are perfect for walking around my house which has a lot of tile floors. They are pricey, but you get what you are paying for with these. I will buy again."
5.0,This jacket was just what I was looking for. I went to a store here in town and they waned three times as much. This jacket looks and feels nice and I really like the way it is built
5.0,My 15 year old son uses these for cross country and track and field they work great and are comfortable for him
5.0,It's nice goes perfect with my swim suit.
5.0,"See through ,but fit and size is true. Love it"
5.0,very cute gift
5.0,I ordered this necklace seeing that it was really cool and when I saw the price I just knew I had to get it. It came to my house the next week and was perfect. 5* quality and came with extra stuff. It really is amazing and came all the way from China. Great Product! I will likely buy more products from the company. I love the necklace! :)
5.0,"Fits perfectly, I've had a Pulsar chronograph for over 17 years packed away. New life to my old timepiece."
5.0,This top is so fun for Fall.  I love the shoulder detail and the knotted hem.  I’m sure I’ll wear this often.
5.0,These are FANTASTIC pants! Not only do they have POCKETS!!! but they fit an average-waist man who is 6'4&#34; with enough length to cross his legs and still have them long enough to cover his ankles. He loves them and says they are very comfortable. Love them!
5.0,This is such a cute little ear cuff! I'm using this for an elf cosplay and it works great!! Doesn't look cheap at all and is really pretty! Overall a very good buy! Thanks!
5.0,"This is a great set, makes packing much easier, would definitely recommended."
5.0,I love these shirts. I took the advise of other reviews and ordered a size bigger. That worked out and the shirts fit exactly right. They are soft and comfy. I've already ordered more.
5.0,"I am 5'6&#34;, 145 lbs, 36C chest and I ordered a medium. I fits perfectly. I was able to lace the front of the corset all the way up so that it fit very tightly, I work at the Maryland Ren Fest and wearing a corset gives me the back support I need when I'm on my feet all day. I think I will have to replace the ribbons in the corset with some more sturdy material, the ribbons are cute but I don't think they will stand up to the wear and tear of lacing them up constantly. The rest of the ensemble is well made, the skirt puffs out nicely underneath the corset and the material is thick enough that you can't see through it but thick enough that it breaths. The shirt is plain but that's what you want underneath these kinds of outfits. The corset is the reason I bought the outfit, its a gorgeous royal blue and the silver fluer-de-lis pattern is beautiful. Not sure whats in the boning, probably just plastic, but the material of the corset itself is very sturdy and well made. All in all its a beautiful outfit that is very well made for a reasonable price, my only complaint is that the picture shown is of a blue corset with a blue skirt and I received a black skirt. I would love to have the blue skirt as well so I can mix and match with my other outfits."
5.0,Hope my girlfriend likes it
5.0,Perfect! Just like the pic.
5.0,I have used these straps for years to keep my shirts tucked giving me a clean look. My current uniform shirts are a little baggy around the waist and this helps them look tight and pressed.
5.0,"It's fits well and is supportive,"
5.0,Shipped on time and looks great. Affordable pricing. Love it
5.0,"Purchased for my daughter in law for Christmas. More beautiful than I expected. She loved it. Very dainty , lots of sparkle."
5.0,This shirt works for me.
5.0,I love my snogas!!! I have a bad obsession with these. If you sign up on their website you will get emailed coupon codes which are good but bad if you are trying to save money! I own 5 different styles and this black faux wrap is my favorite! A way to be modest and comfortable. I used to wear a skirt over my yoga pants but now I got rid of all my yoga pants and the little skirt I used to wear over them.
5.0,works great for biking.
5.0,VERT COMFORTABLE AND FIT GREAT!!  THESE ARE MY 3RD PR.
5.0,Girlfriend loved this got it as an anniversary present
5.0,"I bought this to replace a similar sweater in black. I really like the charcoal color & how it flows all around. I was surprised by the back collar which is scrunched, but I think it will be fine, just a little added detail. I'm 5'5&#34;, 154 & ordered a L which fits nicely. The material is very thin, more like a t-shirt than a sweater, but will still later & travel well."
5.0,"This has been very durable, the holes help with sweating, but that is what he will have to deal with to get a band that can withstand a 9 year old!!!"
5.0,These are adorable and will be great for costume accessories!
5.0,Due to a shipping error; Red Plume was kind enough to ship the shirt I asked for. I recommend them as they demonstrate preferred business practices.
5.0,Weight and quality of fabric is very good. Great design.
5.0,Love it nice saree.
5.0,Lovely casual dress and arrived early and as described. Roomy at the back but quite ok otherwise. Will buy again from this seller.
5.0,El material y el dibujo se siente de buena calidad
5.0,Muy diferente y a la moda
5.0,I really like this. It’s boho in a good way. I like that it has an adjustable slip knot. It falls nicely on my neck and it’s not scratchy which I was worried about. Nice necklace!
5.0,"Love it. Great quality, good price, perfect fit."
5.0,These look amazingly bad ass and are so on trend. I haven’t taken them off since they arrived!
5.0,This was one of many gifts that I gave my daughter for christmas.  She loved it and could not wait to wear it.
5.0,This is a very cute book and gnome. My kids loved the thought of the gnome watching over them during Christmas time and I LOVED that I didn't have to worry about moving or creating new situations every night. It is a new Christmas tradition in our house.
5.0,"The size was accurate, and it's a nice fabric for wearing in the sun."
5.0,Perfect for a concert. Got it for an Ariana Grande concert and it made check in a breeze. It’s comfortable and easy to wear and use.
5.0,"Great colors, great set."
5.0,"Excellent wallet to hold credit cards and money. I can’t believe that it takes up such a narrow space, yet holds all my cards and cash. I would totally recommend it to anyone that has several cards to carry. It keeps everything neat and organized. Looks expensive! Great price!"
5.0,"Perfect color, fabric, and length.  Great for my Mikasa cosplay."
5.0,Was a gift for my step son... he LOVES it! and he is 30 years old!
5.0,"Nice bracelet, looks great, good packaging for a gift."
5.0,"This watch band works perfectly for me. I like to wear fun and interesting accessories and this fit the bill for my ho-hum boring Apple Watch.  But fun doesn’t have to mean childish. This watch band is by no means juvenile. I didn’t want to wear the Ariel, Little Mermaid on my wrist. I’m a grown woman and this meets my needs perfectly.  I haven’t had any of the problems some people have had with this band. It’s very sturdy and well made. The design is very detailed and printed in muted shades that go with lots of outfits. As far as fit goes, I have a medium sized wrist and it fits fine with plenty of notches to fit a variety of wrist sizes.  I’m very happy with this watch band and it has become my favorite accessory."
5.0,Love the size and print.
5.0,"Nice quality, easy to install."
5.0,my client bought this and he loves it he shows off in front of the ladies hes the man sporting this
5.0,I loved it. It's good quality. Fits me perfectly
5.0,My kid loved this shirt. Fits good.
5.0,The set is very beautiful I bought it for my daughter as a birthday gift
5.0,"Pretty and unique haven't worn it yet so I don't know if it will stay in place. So for now it's a good purchase, when I wear it if something changes I'll let you know."
5.0,Love this dress!! Super comfortable
5.0,"I love this sweater, looks great off the shoulders and is very comfortable. It's a little see-thru in this coloir so you'll have to wear something under it if you don't want your bra to show"
5.0,I ordered a bigger size (XXL) because the person wearing it is top heavy. She said overall it fit really good but she wouldn’t have minded a size down. Only downside is that you have to be very careful to not snag the Velcro on the costume and it’s hard when you try to fasten waistnwrap tightly/
5.0,Great sweatshirt. I sized up a bit for my 6 ft tall son. Glad i did. Nice quality hoody.
5.0,"This dress is AWESOME!! It's really comfortable & great to dance in! I love the material. The back of the dress is black & lacey. Super slimming! I'm 5'6'' & 145lbs & I order a large, it fits perfectly! I probably could wear a medium too, but I wanted plenty wiggle room for dancing & I didn't want it to be too short & have to keep pulling it down. The material is stretchy & super comfortable! I love this dress!!!"
5.0,These glasses fit perfectly on my face and they are definitely high quality! I'm very happy with this purchase and the price I paid was unbeatable compare to other retailers.
5.0,"These are literally amazing. I have spent $100 on leggings that don't even compare to these. The fit is perfect. I'm 5'10 and the length is perfect! Fabric is awesome, I expect some pulling just because the fabric is brushed, but for the price I could care less. Will definitely be buying more. Just wish they had more colors available for this length!"
5.0,Great product. Very lite to wear and stylish. Looks more expensive then it real is.
5.0,Fit perfect and came in time
5.0,Looks and fit great
5.0,"I wear this everyday, literally never take it off. Lol so far no tarnishing or anything after a few weeks."
5.0,"I never had time go to shopping with my mom, so I bought this shoes on amazon,the quality was good, look nice. She mainly wears it very comfortable.."
5.0,"The shorts are comfortable,  flexible, and the knee lenght is just right. I really liked the inside pocket for your phone."
5.0,"Love them ,pretty shoes for toldders"
5.0,very good!!  They fit well and i love to wear colorful things when i can get away with it..
5.0,"Like most people, I am a HUGE Game of Thrones fan and I thought it would be great to have something showing it. This is a beautiful bracelet for anyone to wear. This has the dragon symbol, of course, and has two leather bindings that go along the sides. You can have both on the back, front, or one of each when it comes to the leather bindings. The clasp is very easy to get open and the bracelet is easy to get on and off your wrist.<br /><br />What I love the most about this is how elegant it actually looks. I did not think it was going to look as well as it does. This would be great as a gift to someone who is a Game of Thrones fan as well.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review."
5.0,"Very light weight, looks like great build quality. Would definitely buy again"
5.0,Amazing watches I gave them as christmas presents to all my guy cousins and they loved them!
5.0,Good quality and has some weight to it. I am excited about it. I was going to give it to my dad but now I have it I kind of just want to keep it...
5.0,"I am in love with these! I roll the clothes in the shape of the towels you get in a hotel. I used the small one for bras/panties/socks. Medium one for shirts and large for Jeans/pants. Easy to use, very useful in organizing suitcase. All of them are meant for a large suitcase so you might be using just the smaller ones for a carry one. I absolutely recommend these. Makes it easy to pack and repack (before covid I hope for you!!) I wish I bought these in different colors but since they are different sizes it is quite simple to know which one is for what."
5.0,"Perfect for my petite height but full  figure. Definitely mask my belly, feels very comfortable and lifts up my mood when wearing, because comfortability is at par with the look. Want to buy several more."
5.0,These are adorable and super nice quality and the price is so low! I wore the ghost and the headstone for the entire month of October but now the Ugh heart is my stand-by.
5.0,I love this watch band!  I was hesitating based on the picture nut bought it anyways and have worn it everyday since.  It’s well made not cheap looking.
5.0,"They keep my toes warm and cozy. Thanks for the great fit, and plush insides."
5.0,They fit well -XL - I usually wear size 12-14 pants.  I love the side pockets and comfortable for lounging.  Nice gray color and tummy control.
5.0,perfect as expected!!
5.0,Love this necklace. It’s the perfect size.
5.0,"Great and beautiful product I had to sent it back 3x because it runs big, so you may have to size it down."
5.0,"Such a cute gift for my panda-loving daughter! She is practically living in it since Christmas morning. The fabric is so cozy, but not too warm. And the design is so much cuter in person."
5.0,Very good quality glasses and came with useful accessories. Very impressive!
5.0,"I got this mask as a part of my Joker cosplay for Halloween and it did not disappoint. The mask looks like it came right out of Persona 5 and has a high-quality build that ensures that it won't fall apart on your face. When I put mine on, I noticed that if I wore it like any other mask it would either rest on my eyebrows and move up whenever I raised them or it rested on my nose and I couldn't see. I had to reposition where I put the strap on my head so that it didn't move with my eyebrows and so that I could see. It was kinda annoying, but its something that can be easily overlooked. Besides, if the strap breaks, you could always fix it up with some hot glue no problem. Its quality is good, but I suggest that you be careful since you could probably drop and break it on a hard floor, but if you're cautious like me then you'll be fine. The mask also serves as a nice unoffical collector's item. When I was waiting for Halloween to roll around, I found that I was enjoying the mask while it was just sitting on my bookshelf! So, even after you're done cosplaying, you can still enjoy it's stylish look.<br /><br />Overall, you get what you pay for with this mask. It's high quality, stylish, and fulfills its use in and outside of cosplay. If you've got the money to spare, this mask won't disappoint you!"

5.0,"Very light ,very comfortable, good for temperature around 50."
5.0,I ordered this to wear it to a Diwali party. The package arrived promptly. I wouldn’t call it a high quality item but it looked great.<br />Just keep in mind that you will need to find your own pants.
5.0,Best running show for me period. I get about 300 miles out of them on pavement.
5.0,Great quality necklace for my daughter.  She loved it.  It did not tarnish and was just as advertised
5.0,"WOW, FITS AS EXPECTED;  HIGHLY RECOMMEND"

5.0,Absolutely beautiful! I'll be able to dress it up or wear with casual pants or skirt. Very flattering to any figure!
5.0,"Hermoso para mi niña de 9 años, es delgada le quedo estupendo"
5.0,Buffs are awesome. They can be worn in so many ways that I am constantly finding new uses for them.
5.0,It fits my neck perfectly and I have a very small neck. It looks just like it does in the picture. The leather is a little cheap but it's great for the price I paid. :)
5.0,For the money this might be one of my favorites.<br />I have around 12 watches that I wear in a rotation and I’ve been finding myself wanting to wear this one more and more. Always received compliments from my coworkers and my friends every time I wear it.<br />It’s very well made. Although the bands a little stiff after wearing it for a couple weeks it gets a lot better. Will recommend this watch to anyone.
5.0,Very flattering on the booty.  I will be purchasing other colors.
5.0,"I love this tunic, it fits great around the upper body. I wish it was a little tighter in the stomach and hip area, but it does not look bad."
5.0,Owls are my favorite and when these came in they weren't to heavy to wear or made my hear feel weighted down they are easy to put on and take off!very beautiful<br /><br />I didn't buy this product on Amazon I fought them at a retail store and full price these are just my opinions after using this product for some time now.
5.0,This shirt came and was as advertised.  It is a good quality material and fits true to size.
5.0,Party dress
5.0,"Fits to size. My first Eileen West purchase and i love it.  Fabric / style / color reminiscent of a man's dress shirt. Finally, women's night clothes that don't look like they belong in a baby girl's nursery."
5.0,"Great dress awful color.  The burgundy is brownish, and not a flattering color.  Otherwise a great dress and very comfortable.  I usually wear an 8 in pants and dresses and the medium was perfect.  Not too short either.  The black one is perfect.  It hides everything but it does give a little peek near the chest area."
5.0,Great buy My husband loves it
5.0,"As advertised. Not polarized. Kind of heavy. I use these on my bicycle over my prescription glasses. The flip works well, and they're easy to install/ remove. Extremely not cool right now but they keep the sun, road wind, and gnats out of my eyes."
5.0,With the new koolbands and non clip bands these now seem mediocre at best.
5.0,"I have four pairs of Noble Outfitters full seat Balance riding tights.  I am five feet tall, with large calves and thighs.  My weight fluctuates, at 140 lbs I wore a size L, at 160 I wear a size XL.  They also come in XXL and smaller sizes.But I do have a curvy waist.  Waist is perfectly sized with no belt needed, although there are belt loops. The waistband comes up to my natural  waist, does not roll, the crotch stays in place and doesn't have anything irritating about it.  The fabric seems to wick away heat and dries quickly.  The full seat silicone pattern doesn't pinch me in the joint areas, and has a lot of grip on the saddle.  Some of the other brands with full seats silicone were actually slippery!  I turn them inside out to wash and dry and have had two pairs for three years, riding two or three times a week, they look like the day I bought them with no holes, ripped seams or color fading.  The fabric does not show my cellulite and bulges very much.  The lightweight stretchy hem doesn't irritate my calf inside my tall boots. Some brands are too long for me and I have to cuff the hem up inside the boot, but these are ankle length.  Only one pocket on the left thigh, big enough for my cell phone.  Wish there were two pockets.  I recommend these for short heavy riders like myself."
5.0,This necklace is very beautiful the stone is bigger than I expected and very shiny.  The chain is beautiful as well.  It is much prettier in person and a Great gift idea for all ages and the price is a plus.
5.0,Its a little crazy shiny. It took some getting used to. My other chains are a little less flashy. Its great quality hasn't rusted at all even after swimming in pools with it all summer.
5.0,I love my necklace it’s worth the money
5.0,"Love, love, love it! Beautiful leather and perfect craftsmanship. What do you expect from coach ?"
5.0,"I chose this item to wear around the house when I’m busy cleaning, picking up, bill pay.. you name it. I am always losing my phone. I don’t know how many times a day that I lose my phone but now when I’m busy doing things, I can put my phone right in one of the pockets and that’s the main reason that I chose this item."
5.0,They were what I expected. I love how you can dress them up. Would buy more.
5.0,Really block out the sun nicely and gives you that nice polarized view where everything seems better and for the price and style you can't beat it
5.0,Very good tanks
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:3a699286a857288e5139bcfbcdbed6cb]] I really like these sunglasses! I'll be honest, I generally get my sunglasses at the local discount store, but after getting these and seeing the quality difference I don’t think I'll be able to go back to cheap glasses anymore.<br /><br />Not only do these glasses come in a really cool hard case, but they come with a soft little pouch too. I keep the case in my car and the pouch in my purse so if I forget to take the glasses off in my car, I can keep them scratch free in the pouch.<br /><br />The pair I got are so cool! They are over sized black frames and they're really dark so they do a fantastic job of keeping the sun out of your eyes. I didn't realize when I bought these but they have glitter all over the temples and they're ridiculously pretty. I absolutely love these and they're very well-made. They’re also super comfortable to wear. I’m not normally a big fan of glasses that have metal temples as my hair always seems to snag on them, but this hasn’t been an issue for me yet.  These are fantastic glasses!<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
5.0,Used for a costume party. The stitching is top notch and will definitely be s pack away item. Great value for the money spent.
5.0,Love love this precious outfit

5.0,I love my USA rhinestone hat! It fits great and the adjustable strap provides for secure fit.
5.0,Purchased for my toddler to wear under dresses and skirts.  Lightweight and fit perfectly.
5.0,"Cute dress with pockets! I like the fit and the feel.  It came out of the package with a smell, though. Not necessarily a bad smell, but it's very strong, and I can't tell whether it's chemical or detergent of some sort."
5.0,Beautiful little ring they loved it for Christmas gift!
5.0,"Bands are the same material as the one a gotcha comes with, holds it well but it is thick in general"
5.0,Grands loves the fits
5.0,My son loves these sandals it’s easy for him to take off as well.  The quality is superb.
5.0,Absolutely love them.  I purchased magnetic clips to hang each of them on the girl cave beer frig.
5.0,"Unusual style...but Mordenmiss quality. Shorter than a tunic. Puffy sleeves, I like it."
5.0,"These are perfect for our use. Strong, attractive, professional looking. The only thing that would make them better is if they came with extra card inserts for writing the information on. An inexpensive addition to an item that is not cheap. I suggest writing on them with a thin Sharpie. The first pen I used smudged on the smooth surface of the card even though I was being careful and even set it aside to dry for awhile.  Also, write the name towards the middle of the card or the first letter may be covered. Extra card inserts would make it so getting it right the first time wouldn’t be a big deal."
5.0,"Bought for my son in law and he loved it!  But had to return for a smaller size, with no problems :)"
5.0,"They were very nice, beautiful.  Really liked them !!!"
5.0,"Nice hoodie. My husband ordered a large and that's his normal size, it fit just right. The inside is soft. It's pretty basic but that's what we ordered."

5.0,This is so damn cute! Made well. Always get compliments.
5.0,"The inseam is long enough, the waistband goes where it should, they are comfortable!!"
5.0,Son muy cómodas para mi hija.... y tal como se ven.. solo que si tu niña es 12 trata de pedírlas un size más para que le queden mejor..!!!
5.0,Fit is Amazing!
5.0,Great shirt. Absolute truth: burpees are indeed the devil.
5.0,This is a very fashionable long lightweight scarf that can be worn many ways..quite a bargain
5.0,"Use it often and it works well, looks great."
5.0,"I just received these bras today, a few minutes ago. I really like them - they're comfortable and actually fit me. I've got issues finding bras in my area, so I've had to resort to online searching. I'm glad I struck some luck with these. The band is actually a bit loose, but not to the point that I have to use the very last hook.<br /><br />If it helps, I wear a 32 A and ordered these in a small. If you wear a 32-34 I think you could get away with ordering these in a small."
5.0,The product fit perfectly.
5.0,good quality & fit
5.0,Is very beautiful dress...fits perfect...
5.0,Nice. Comes with tool bonus! Looks well made. True to size. Would be a nice gift as it comes in packaging that makes it seem higher end. Really like that one strap holder is integrated into the band so it would  less likely to break and fall off. See photo
5.0,Fits very well and its super soft.
5.0,"This is the perfect set for those with thinner beards, a well-made product. The detail is very nice. I would recommend an elastic band to hold in place clear ones are perfect and fit under the item well for great hidden hold. can also hook the tail of the coil for added hold. I was disappointed expecting a Viking made product but mad in china but such as the world"
5.0,Great fit and breathable. I purchased after a surgery that reduced my mobility and these were very comfortable and a lifesaver!
5.0,Love it !very nice
5.0,"Awesome, high quality hoodie!  Love it. Thank you!"
5.0,"Nice material, not too thin or thick and built with a nice stretch. Length is perfect to wear with leggings. Will likely get in more colors as they are get casual tops to have on hand."
5.0,"Worked great, original replacement."
5.0,"So glad I ordered it, soft material, fits as expected.  5’ 8”, 190lb, I ordered an XL."
5.0,Our 8 year old grandson got this as his birthday gift from his brother and loves it.  The one downside is that the numbers could be easier to read.  Dark gray letters on a lighter gray background makes them harder to read.  LED lighting would have been a better feature.
5.0,"It did seem a bit long but after wearing it a bit I think it's fine. Also comes with pockets =D I like how comfortable it fits, not too tight, and I can adjust the belt as needed. Comfortable and flowy"
5.0,"Love it, ""perfectly matched"" my jacket,  wore to a Xmas party, i looked fabulous"
5.0,Love it not to thick not to thin perfect for fall or a chilly day. as always big fan of Nike SB
5.0,grand daughter very happy with jacket
5.0,Fun witches hat. Fit good. Top wired so can bend how you want.
5.0,This is so cute! Don’t buy if you don’t know who Debbie Harry or Blondie is.
5.0,Very soft and lightweight!!
5.0,This was a great product. Before ordering I read the reviews and all said the product runs small. My daughter is 9 and I bought her the one fir 11-12 year olds and it fit perfect. The dress was delivered with in 2 days from the date I purchased it. I am a very happy customer!
5.0,The material on these are so smooth and buttery and breathable! I think I just found the perfect brief for everyday wear
5.0,My grandson loves these underwear!
5.0,"Love this cute, comfy socks for lounging in house. Especially after a Polar Bear Swim (3 days a week)"
5.0,My go-to swimsuit cover-up
5.0,"This sweater is super cute! I got the ""apricot"" color in a large. The color is pretty much off white or cream. Large is my true size and this fits perfectly. I can wear it with leggings as it comes low enough to cover my bottom. However, if you are taller than 5'5"" it maybe too short for leggings and you might want to size up. I love the aysemetrical bottom edge, it adds a really cute flare to it. And the material is perfectly soft! Highly recommend!"
5.0,Was supposed to have a clip on top of that hearing to hold it in place came without hopefully they stay up when I wear them
5.0,i am OBSESSED with this sweatshirt! i love it! it’s so comfy and well fitting and so cool looking! i would definitely recommend!
5.0,Perfect for dressy occasions.
5.0,I'm obsessed with these lightweight hoops! They go with everything......so cute
5.0,Perfect for summer days with sandals or even winter months with leggings and boots. The material is not too heavy or too light. Also perfect as a mater Iet dress.
5.0,This is a terrific watch. The fit and finish of this watch is very close to my Swiss made name brand watch. Although it is not a thin timepiece it does fit well under my dress shirt and jacket. The transaction was smooth and it arrived far more quickly than promised. I am not crazy about the band which is flimsy and not at all distinctive. But it is a minor inconvenience.
5.0,"Perfect PJ Pants! Most flannel PJ's shrink and become too short, these did not and I love them!"
5.0,"fit perfect, came in quick and are very comfortable"
5.0,Fun for birthday party
5.0,"This is such an beautiful dress, that I will purchase again. The color really compliments my skin tone. Also, the pockets are deep enough to put my phone inside of it. This is a must purchase ."
5.0,"beautiful, im assuming with this company it is a hit or miss. I didnt expect much from this stone coloring but I love them! I ordered some amethyst as well from the same company and they arrived clear, but these are perfect."
5.0,"OK, these were extremely LEGIT. They looked great. Felt smooth and were not heavy that leave marks on your eyes or nose. NONE of that.<br />When I looked at my computer screen, I could definitely tell the difference. NOT a shocking difference, but enough that my eyes were able to relax so much more.<br />I work on Mortgages all day. Believe me, if these worked for me, they will work for anybody!<br />Pricewise, extremely affordable!<br />Loved them!"
5.0,day 4 this watch has stayed in perfect time i love it so far. being a watch freak i can feel the quality of the case and movment
5.0,"I ordered these in black, white, and pink, and all three are beautiful. The pink is especially exquisite. They are super soft and not itchy at all.  Because I have a larger chest, I plan to wear these on top of a strapless bra for a little extra support and a flash of lace on the shoulders. Don't expect any real support from these on their own - they are definitely for show which is exactly what I wanted."
5.0,"Great shoes for daycare, pool, etc.  They're not slip on, so I suggest you still put socks on your kid.  The rubber makes it tough & my son cried a couple times before I realized it was the shoes hurting his feet.  Once we put socks on 1st.  They slid on & off w/ ease & no more red marks on his feet."
5.0,The Bracelet is just as cool looking as what is shown.  Luvin' it.
5.0,"I ordered this shoe tree because it is made from beechwood, so it is very durable.  It does a fine job in stretching a shoe."
5.0,"Man couldn’t wait to wear it to my gym and show my coach!!! Love it!!! Fits well, but that’s because I believe in always ordering a size bigger."
5.0,As expected! Thank you.
5.0,"no comment, item was as described"
5.0,"I’m used to plastic frames with black lenses so these wire frames with coffee lenses took a bit to get used to. The wire feels less durable at first. After using for a while they are holding up very well, and I have now gotten used to them. The lenses are large, but they are shaped in a way that allows them to look ok on my medium face, and very nice on my wife’s large face. The polarization does work, and the difference is noticeable; try them in the rain and you see the difference right away. For the price you can’t go wrong."
5.0,OMG I got them yesterday and I felt so much  in love with this sunglasses. I don't normally write reviews I read them instead as they really helpful before purchasing any items online.
5.0,The thickest bamboo socks I’ve gotten . Very comfortable - true to size

5.0,I would like to know if there are earrings to match. Loved this necklace!
5.0,Love ❤️ my little so cute he just makes me smile
5.0,"This wallet is great for the price. (not the best quality but you can’t expect more for only 8 dollars) I only use mini wallets as they fit everywhere and don’t weigh down my bag. It holds everything I need it to, ID, cash, cards and coins! Iv had it for a few weeks now and it’s still in great condition. :)"
5.0,It was a perfect gift and the receiver loved it very much. The color of the rose gold is great.
5.0,Looks and fits as advertised
5.0,"Everything was  so good, but a little bigger than I thought"
5.0,Just the thing for cold evenings up north.  not bulky
5.0,"I really like this dress. It’s the exact color that I ordered, looks like on a picture. Feels very nice to body. Perfect for going out or going to the nice beach walk during the day. Shows body silhouette"
5.0,Love it but I was not familiar with the sizings so I bought one that was too large. I'm going to see if I can fix it.
5.0,These are soft and of quality material.
5.0,Leather is supple and soft. Seems very well made. Comfortable- well suited for cool fall weather!
5.0,The watch is flawless and the customer support was excellent!
5.0,"I got this as a gift for my hubby.  He has a 32 waist and this is the best belt he said he's ever owned. He doesnt have to readjust his pants and belt thoughout the day anymore, and the belt doesnt sut into his hips.  I will definitely be reordering.  Thank you"
5.0,Good compression and arch support. My only critique would be I would have liked some cushion through the foot. Being on my feet for 12h as a nurse I found the balls of my feet were a little sore. But I'm being picky. I will def buy more and recommend them to my coworkers.
5.0,"Good fit, soft material, great shirt."
5.0,"Love these pajamas! Lightweight, but warm. Hardly shrunk at all which is a big plus and they're super cute! I would recommend them for sure."
5.0,This dress was amazing ! Fit like a glove . Received many compliments.
5.0,I love this dress!! It does run a little small so order up! I am 5’4 and usually wear a 12 or 14. I got a xl and it’s super flattering. The bottom of the fringe hits me mid-shin.
5.0,"Actually, it was a gag gift but he loves them."
5.0,"it was very good, and it got to me in  very good condition, thank you very much"
5.0,"very pretty, excited to give to my sister in law for Christmas!"

5.0,"This tennis bracelet is just beautiful! I love that it is light weight, but shines as brilliantly as can be! I have another cubic zirconia tennis bracelet, but it is a little heavier than this one, but just as beautiful. I'm thinking of getting another bracelet for my Granddaughter for Christmas, and this one will be wonderful for her as well!"
5.0,"I'm super particular about my handbags and clutches, and normally won't purchase either unless it's real leather because I hate cheap looking bags. That wasn't the case with this clutch. It's super stylish, appears to be of great quality, and looks more expensive than it is. I purchased it in white and would recommend it to others!"
5.0,They fit great! I had open heart surgery and all my bras irritated the scar in the middle of my chest. Even the cami Breezies. Will be ordering more soon.
5.0,I purchased several pairs of earrings to complete a back to school gift bag. She was thrilled to receive them because of the bright enamel colors and detail in the designs. The jewelry definitely adds a spark to a simple jeans and tee shirt wardrobe. The earrings are stainless steel and lightweight for all day wear.
5.0,Product got to the house quick and in good packaging. Portal gun is fully intact and in good condition. My son absolutely loves it. I told him as stays out of the razor blade and butt dimensions and he should be fine while wandering the multiverse.

5.0,All thou shipping took forever I finally received it and it is absolutely adorable well-made. will definitely be buying again
5.0,"It wasn't quite as heavy as expected, but is very pretty and appears to be well made.  Links are all solid with no openings.  I was not expecting it to be a chain that needs to lay flat to look it's best. In one picture the links looked like the direction was opposite every-other one so you would get a more round chain appearance.  I chose to keep it though because it is very nice."
5.0,Great contrast with my other silver rings
5.0,This top is so nice!  The sleeves make it just a touch dressier than a plain old t-shirt. I get many compliments.  I ordered several colors.
5.0,I would recommend this top  &#60;3 It's totally cute an perfect for just about any occasion!
5.0,"Well I'm very happy with this product, I'm actually wearing it as I type this. It fits great, it's nice and soft, it keeps me warm. The green print sorta feels like it will flake off in the wash rather quick, it doesn't seem like the absolute best quality. It's not bad, though. The zipper gets stuck sometimes, it's not the best quality. However, the hoodie still looks nice and I feel good just by supporting my favorite band with this merchandise."
5.0,IT RUNS SMALL THRU THE BUST ARE AND UNDER THE ARMS
5.0,Absolutely adorable. Good condition and fit. Gave as gifts and each girl loved it. Really enjoyable. They will enjoy the beach and pool
5.0,"I was leafing through the current (Summer)issue of a magazine called Where Women Create, and I saw this pin attached to a mannequin(with other pins), in a featured woman's studio.I was struck by its unique-ness, and quiet,classic elegance.This simple,yet pretty brooch will be your perfect go-to pin.It will look great on a very casual jacket (jean),or a black winter coat.It would look perfect on a pearl grey dress for a wedding/formal event. Put on small diamond (real,or fake)studs,and you are ready to go.You can never go wrong with pearls. They are a timeless classic for a reason,right? Great seller.Great price.I will use this seller again."
5.0,This watch is extremely comfortable to wear and so very pretty
5.0,Having to hem them but it worked perfectly

5.0,Quality sweatband. Great design
5.0,This was part of my Halloween costume and it really disturbed all who saw it.
5.0,"Our son can really put a hurting on shoes and we find that a lot of times they just don't hold up to an active kid. These have been amazing. They have great support, fit well, and are made extremely well. For the price, it is WORTH it even if they're only in them until the next growth spurt."
5.0,Got these for a group of girls and they absolutely loved them!  Comes packaged in a nice red box...easy to wrap!
5.0,"I LOVE THESE! I had been ordering directly from China and those are so cheaply made that I took a chance on something better. THESE ARE FANTASTIC! I hope will find more colour choices, because THESE ARE GREAT!<br /><br />In the words of Arnold Schwartzenegger: “I’LL BE BACK!”"

5.0,"I love dresses and skirts with pockets. This dress is beautiful and fits well.  It is a dress I will wear often because of the fit, length and pockets. It can be dressed up  or down depending on the accessories worn with it."
5.0,"I love it! I love dragonflies. They hold a special meaning for me (discipline). This is a nice reminder that I can achieve my goals. This bracelet expands easily to fit over the hand. Which is perfect for me because I have big hands and tiny wrists, lol!"
5.0,Love the bracelet and the cause for which it raises money.  The perfect gift is something you love that also helps others.
5.0,"pattern small, but very nice"
5.0,"Comfortable and fit my wife as she expected, so she says."
5.0,"I bought these a few weeks ago and have tried these several times over the last two weeks. They give my feet very good blood flow, keep my feet dry, non constricting, nicely padded with a very soft organic yarn. I am really enjoying these and will be buying another pair."
5.0,I love these earrings! Love all the colors it comes in.
5.0,"I should say i love it. it’s have great quality, very comfortable and stylish. I take it with me to traveling. Nice companion."
5.0,Great.  Have been complimented several times about the tie!
5.0,It was perfect ! Great quality !
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these beanies. It's exactly what I've been looking for, and fits perfectly. I've gotten tons of compliments already!"
5.0,"Love this bathing suit. It is perfect for the top heavy, and flattering to the belly as it covers much of the stomach. I am a 36D and an 8 bottom. True to size chart."
5.0,Super cute. Got lots of compliments when I wore it to a wedding.
5.0,Only brand and model I'm buying anywhere!
5.0,delivered quick and with good quality.  would recommend for layering necklaces.
5.0,Very nice set! My son has a nice collection of Zelda and fantasy items and he has been fascinated by keys (he's 10) for a long time. &#34;Unlocking new worlds&#34; and theme video games and stories.  This was a great gift for him!
5.0,I bought this for my nephew. It is super adorable and looks to be of great quality! Not too thick. Comes with a cute lanyard. Perfect present for a little boy! He is going to LOVE it!
5.0,small pentacle for scale of how much bigger this one is.
5.0,"Like the variety and comfort that they bring, Ordering some more!"
5.0,"I am 5’8”, 35 weeks pregnant, 135 before pregnancy and 161 now. I ordered smalls and they are perfect. Love love love these dresses! First I ordered the green and loved it so much I went back and ordered the wine red. My favorite part is that I can definitely wear these after pregnancy. While they are long sleeve, the material is thin and stretchy so it’s cool enough to wear in the summer."
5.0,Arrived in time frame said. It is the the pair as stated. Look exactly as in the picture and are the size stated. Satisfied with the look and quality of the product.
5.0,"Bought the black, grey & olive set. Material & fit is actually better than I thought it would be. A lot of the time you order something and what u get, is nothing like the pictures. This is not one of those times. Will be ordering more."
5.0,Great mini dress!! Love the feel and flow of it. Actually great fabric. Did shrink a bit but helped since the sleeves were originally long on me. I'm 5'1 and the large went to my mid thigh.
5.0,"Love these leggings, they are comfortable and thick :)"
5.0,Muy bueno y bonito 100%recomendando
5.0,This dress is cute af. Fit perfectly. Only downside is the sleves were too tight but i cut the elastic out of them and now its so comfy
5.0,Fun little bracelet.
5.0,Daughter loves it!!  Excellent quality.
5.0,"Overall, I really like these sunglasses. The style is stylish and retro. They can be paired with any outfit, casual or dressed up. They fit comfortably on my face and aren’t too tight. I have been wearing them pretty much daily and they haven’t chipped or anything yet. They are very good at blocking the sun. My only complaint is that I can’t unlock my phone with FaceID because of the tint. But other than that, these are stylish and I would recommend them."
5.0,"Very nice, good quality👍💝"
5.0,"Very cute, but kinda falls apart quickly. But worth it for the price. Not good in wet situations."
5.0,I get a lot compliments on the earrings
5.0,"This top is true to size and color (yes, I know the color in the photo looks pink but it REALLY is red!).  The fabric is lightweight and is a polyester/rayon blend that is very soft to the touch.  All of the seams are intact, with no missing or loose threads, and it is finished very professionally.  It's super comfortable to wear, but I do have to wear something underneath it because the shirt is loose and the arm openings are large.  I love the length of it because it goes well with leggings and covers up everything I want covered.  Although they recommend hand washing, I washed it with cold water in a delicate cycle and hung it to dry.  It didn't shrink, and it dried without a wrinkle (see photo)."
5.0,Lots of cute colors and very durable.  My dog plays rough and they have not come off.
5.0,Great bra! Very sticky so it stays in place. Good for low back dresses! Comes with pasties as an extra bonus
5.0,So cute! Perfect addition to my Halloween costume.
5.0,"I loved this dress!! I bought it because my husband and I decided to elope on the beach in California. Ordering off of Amazon, and at the price, I didn't expect the quality to be as good as it is. It's truly a beautiful dress. I got so many compliments and I felt beautiful on my wedding day. Thank you Amazon and 2 day shipping 😂"
5.0,"Loved the colors, went great with making face masks"
5.0,Looks great! Fits great! Buy your normal bra size because that’s definitly how it fits. Since it’s bigger at the bottom it adds a little more support as well.
5.0,"Purchased this for my son, and he absolutely loves it. It's fits well on a teenager."
5.0,So cute. Bought it as a gift and could not part with it. Pretty sparkly and very well made. I was surprised at the quality for the price.
5.0,"Earrings were as described. Small but perfect for someone who likes petite earrings.  Earrings look likethe  real emeralds they are, not cloudy. I bought these for my daughter-in-law's birthday. It is not until March but I feel sure she will love them as much as I do.  This company appears to be very conscious of quality, care in packaging and timely delivery.  I am very impressed."
5.0,Great hat but it's a snug fit.  I'm sure it depends on what size your head is.  I would say my noggin is about an average size and I can comfortably wear most hats.  This hat is very warm and well made though so I just pull on it a bit to stretch it out.
5.0,Cool and fun watch band. A great color to have for the summer season.
5.0,"very durable material, wish the girls was made for the same fabric doesnt shrink in the dryer"
5.0,"Looks very nice. I wore it over a short black dress and got so many compliments. It does fit small. I suggest sizing up a size at least. I am a 10/12 I ordered a size L and it fits, but a XL would have been more comfortable. Overall it's nice and a great price"
5.0,"Love this dress, comfortable and very flattering for my larger frame."
5.0,I love these pants. They are very comfortable and I find myself wearing them all the time.
5.0,"Comfy, cool blouse"
5.0,hat reducer works great which it had a felt feel at one end
5.0,Very attractive. Nice material. Fits well. Very comfortable.
5.0,Very nice. Glad I purchased this.
5.0,I have three pairs and wear them every day as long as I time my laundry right. Please make these with a fleece lining so I can be cozy this winter! They are so comfy and the perfect length for me at 5'2. The pockets are just deep enough to hold my iphone 13 mini and the waist is high enough for my post baby belly. There is some slight pilling on the inner thigh but easily fixed with the de-fuzzer. They have held up great over the last 10 months especially considering how much use they get. Favorite pants of all time.
5.0,Beautiful unique design and high quality sterling silver. These arrived in 2 days and I am so impressed with the product. They are not flimsy and lightweight - this is the real deal. I will definitely be buying more in the future.
5.0,Perfect fit. Too bad they don’t have XL anymore. Dreamgirl costumes never fail to impress.It seems they only make a limited amount of costumes. I use mine for cosplay purposes and it sucks to not be able to rebuy the same costume over and over again. So buy as soon as they come out!
5.0,fit perfectly and came with 2 pins if your originals are showing their age.  look for a video on the internet on how to best unseat the pins and change out the strap.  took me less than a minute by following the video.
5.0,it was cute. Small tail and bow tie but works with my outfit. Arrived faster than expected.
5.0,Comfy and cozy....I wear these all day in the house!
5.0,Perfect fit and perfect comfort.
5.0,Got these as a 40th wedding anniversary gift for my wife - she loved them.
5.0,"I bought the green colored shirt and a medium fits me well (130 Lb - 5'5""). I love the accent with the buttons in the front. It gives the shirt a modern look. The material has a nice feel on the skin."
5.0,These masks are the best. Seller is quick to ship
5.0,"These were reasonably priced, nice compression and easy to put on. I would buy these again!!"
5.0,Looks great and keeps good time.  Only drawback was the leather band.  I prefer stretch bands.
5.0,Super pretty and flattering dress. It flows to cover imperfections and the waist band makes my not so flat stomach look great!
5.0,Great! Exactly what I was looking for
5.0,"Arrived in time, make it so much easier to hold"
5.0,LOVE this coat!! Useful for fall but not warm enough for winter. I live in Minnesota so I mean we need heavy coats but I planned on having this as my fall coat anyway
5.0,Working in the sun they're good. No complaints.
5.0,"I've fallen in love with this blouse. I purchased the white floral short-sleeved blouse first and have since purchased two more (one short and one long-sleeved). I love all three! I would recommend that you go 1-2 sizes down for sure (1 if you have larger arms) depending on the style you're going for.<br /><br />I read other reviews, the restricted motion doesn't bother me at all, I love this top! For reference, I'm 5'7, 190 LBS, 43-45 bust (34DDD), 33-35 waist and I purchased M the first time and S for the second and third items. I like a little more of a tight fit so prefer the S.<br /><br />Hope this helps."
5.0,"I spent a lot of time going through the reviews, searching for people of my approximate height and weight to see if they liked the fit.  I am 5' 3"" , 135 pounds and the medium fits like it was made for me.  I am short waisted and was worried about the bodice being too long but the slight gathering at the waist is very flattering.  It is a few inches long, but that is easily remedied.  Keep posting your height and weight in reviews...it really helps!"
5.0,What a beautiful Christmas dress.
5.0,This belt is beautiful! I love it!
5.0,"I got so many compliments about this dress. It's elegant, beautiful, very comfortable and easy to take care of. Perfect for every day or special occasion. I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,I was very pleased with these lovely earrings.
5.0,"i absolutely love this earring!!! i get compliments on it all the time, its one of my favorite jewelry pieces"
5.0,"I chose the khaki, it looked classy on the one model in the images. I love it. I was afraid the color would be different from the image on the computer, but I was not disappointed.  I've been carrying it for a week. Nothing broken, nothing torn. It looks like it costs more than I paid for it. Would definitely buy from the company again!!"
5.0,"Great band, fits perfectly. I’ve had it for over a month and it looks much more durable than the Fitbit brands band was."
5.0,Love these leggings! They are super silky and smooth.
5.0,I love my 3 way poncho.
5.0,These gloves are amazing! They keep your hands very warm and give you the convenience of using your cell phone while wearing them.
5.0,"This little jacket is cute, comfortable and soft. Colors are bright and don't fade during washing."
5.0,"This originally came with a rope chain (not pictured) that didn't go well with the pendant but I absolutely love the pendant itself that I paired with my cuban link chain. If you are a Pokémon fan or just like ""iced out"" jewelry, this is the one to get. Not only does it look great, especially in point lighting/sunlight, it's pretty cheap and high quality!"
5.0,"These are great for just about any lighting. Some days are just kind of glowy and hazy and don't need a dark tint but you're still squinting, and a soft rose tint like these is the perfect solution. Perfect driving glasses."
5.0,Perfect! Perfect! Perfect!  My grandson will love it!
5.0,"I used this for maybe 2 weeks.  The zipper has already broken off, forcing me to use the wristlet portion.  That part is starting to get weak and not open the wallet easily.  Cheap.  Way too cheap for what I paid for.<br />***<br />Update:<br />The seller was great about this issue.  They sent me a voucher to purchase a replacement wallet.  I did so almost 3 weeks ago.  I waited to post an updated review until I could get some use out of the replacement to see if I had the same problem.  I am very happy to say that I haven't!  It appears my first one just had a defect.  I can fit a ton of cards in this one as well as my cell phone and the zipper has held up wonderfully!  Very very happy with both the seller and the product here!"
5.0,"Fits great, easy to put on my watch and makes it nice and simple when putting my watch on in the morning. No loops or clasps to fight with. Just slides right on to my wrist."
5.0,Product came and looked fine but they were not wide enough for my foot
5.0,"These sport bras are the best! They give so much support, are super comfortable, they stretch but yet are sturdy enough to exercise with. I love them & highly recommend. Also true to size"
5.0,"I originally bought this for a wedding gift.  when I saw it and tried it on, I loved it.  Anklets are hard to find.  So i kept it for myself.  It's beautiful."
5.0,"These are the first heels I've ever worn (hence the low review on comfort) and I was pleasantly surprised on easy these were to walk in. Don't get me wrong, it took a hot minute to get used to but after some time I was able to walk around just fine. I got more complements on these than I have any other shoe. I totally recommend but, my dude, buy some inserts because OUCH."
5.0,Very happy with them !!!
5.0,Aunque el envío tarda por la distancia el precio y calidad del producto es excelente. Si no tienes problemas en esperar es la mejor opción
5.0,"I wear these everyday and dont ever take them out.  I shower with them in, and sleep and they are great."
5.0,"This was a beautiful bathing suit. The material felt a little bit cheap, but it was excellent for the price"
5.0,"These capri pants are awesome, especially for the price. The quality is surprisingly good, they fit great and the color is an intense as shown.  I will be purchasing more in various colors."
5.0,Absolutely awesome watch.... Nice look and lite weight
5.0,"I love Zenana tank tops and these are my go to tank top to toss on under shirts. I do find that they cut a little low and my bra is slightly exposed, but since I don't tend to wear them solo without anything else, I'm not terribly concerned.<br />I prefer my shirts in general to be longer length, ending near my hips rather than my waist. These are perfect for that, and strongly recommend the brand for filling in your basics (t-shirts, tank tops, long sleeve t-shirts, etc)."
5.0,These socks are great for hiking - very comfortable!
5.0,The neck Gators were exactly what I ordered and what I wanted and they fit just perfect thank you.
5.0,Great purse my niece loved it but i noticed a little to late it was torn it was a gift. Still recommend this product she wont take it off haha. You
5.0,"Shorts fit perfect. I'm 5'9 125lbs. Waist 28"" and hip 39"". I purchased a size medium. I may buy a size bigger in another color just for a slightly baggery style. They slide on on and off easily too. Very comfy and soft, durable yet breathable material. Ironing needed if you lay flat to dry. The shorts say for teens. I'm a mom and in my forties so safe to say we mature folks who wore shorts like these back in the day can rock them."
5.0,"I absolutely love this romper, and I get many compliments on how comfortable it looks.  This is made of a lightweight material and even has pockets!"
5.0,"I use them almost everyday, they are so good if you have to walk, work, casual occasions or to do daily tasks. I'm size in almost every brand 8 and they fit perfect."
5.0,I love the color variety. They are slightly heavy so I can’t wear them for too long
5.0,Fantastic product. exactly as I was looking for. I can recomend it and return to get one else as similar
5.0,Great fit! Love the inner bike shirt. Super comfortable!
5.0,These are nice for the price
5.0,This is a comfortable and beautiful product.
5.0,"These were a gift for my daughter who is a school teacher in a cold winter climate.  Her hands would get so cold while on recess duty.  They are very warm, high quality and add a classy look to any outfit.  She uses them often and loves them."
5.0,"Love it, and looks really great"
5.0,I bought this in 2 different colors for 2 different events. Fit perfect to size. Very comfortable.
5.0,"I ordered this chain a couple of weeks ago and it's never broken, still looks new. I wear it everyday and is a must have for people with sensitive skin that can't wear sliver or gold. Still looks new the finish is still like the day I received it"
5.0,I love this outfit so much that I bought 4 of them in different colors.
5.0,"Well made , good value for the money , it is my second order , perfect thickness"
5.0,"I sent 8 hours at a computer and eyes hurt every night but haven't hurt as much since wearing these glasses. The anti glare is great too, it really works!"
5.0,BC FOR LIFE
5.0,much nicer than I thought and fast shipping!<br />love it!<br />would order from this company again!~
5.0,"The socks are the perfect blend of merino wool to keep your feet toasty warm. It took three months for the socks to arrive which is unheard of, but I do love the socks."
5.0,This belly ring is so pretty and very good quality. My granddaughter loves it.
5.0,The shirt seemed very nice quality. I bought it for my granddaughters birthday and hope that it will fit her
5.0,I love this! This is my first waist trainer of any sort but for the price I feel as if it was an excellent buy. It does roll down slightly when sitting but it’s nothing I found terribly bothersome. It takes a bit to get use to I will say and i am still trying to get use to wearing it. I bought it mainly to provide some support for my back and encourage me to not slouch and I will say it does the job well. I used it at work while lifting heavy things and it provided great support and I wasn’t sore the next day like I usually am from the heavy lifting. I don’t suggest eating with it though it can be uncomfortable in that aspect. The only flaw I had was one side of the side straps wouldn’t stick so I can’t put it as tight as I might want on some days but I feel for the money it was worth it for me. Very pleased. You will need to measure yourself for accurate sizing
5.0,Very nice and convenient-- much easier than trying to find it in a store! Will keep it in a handy place.
5.0,Fits fantastic!  It’s a really nice kimono.It’s a little big.
5.0,i love them!! i was just little disappointed bc sunglasses are not that rounded like picture show (3d) ! flat! but protect very nice and colors are fun!!
5.0,"tried replacing Dad favorite hat, didn't work so will donate it to VA Home where someone can enjoy this cool hat!"
5.0,This bra is awesome. I love it! and it fits great.
5.0,works wonders love it
5.0,These suckers are DARK and HUGE and I love them!
5.0,Pretty comfy. Husband loved it and wants one in each color. We shall see.
5.0,wife loves it! It is very soft and is the perfect length for her. Came nicely packaged for gifting as well.
5.0,"I gave this one to my sister who will be going for college, and she was very thankful that I have a good eye for beautiful products!"
5.0,"Ok, let me just say, MY BOOBS look AMAZING!!!!! I am a b cup, and with this bra, I look like im a large c or a smaller D!! I love it! I feel so sexy, and the bra is super comfortable. A great buy!"
5.0,Great item. Delivered in timely manner. Love it!
5.0,"These are perfect if you have trouble with other thigh highs because of thicker thighs. I'm 5'1 and I weight 180lbs, so my thighs are pretty large. These are totally comfortable to wear, don't hurt or cut off circulation at all. Would recommend to anyone."
5.0,My grandson loved this hoodie  so glad I purchased it!
5.0,"this purse is a perfect size allowing for my phone ""in its case"" in the middle bay and also my small self defense items in the back pocket.  The front compartment is where i carry a few dollars.  All the necessities.  The strap is adjustable and convenient for changing as my need changes.  Love this purse."
5.0,Love this shirt. Comfy and love the colors
5.0,"Super cute!! Good material. Perfect simple summer dress. Definitely form fitting and short, but I love it. It can be dressed up or down with accessories or flip flops. I may even wear it in the fall with leggings.<br /><br />I got a medium and I am 5&#34;4 and 158 lbs and 3 months postpartum. Once I lose the rest of the baby weight, it'll look even better. A large would have probably been a better fit for me, but since I am still losing weight, the medium is good."
5.0,My daughter loved the keychain
5.0,"Great sock, comfortable"
5.0,"High fashion style for a very affordable price.  I especially like the easy adjustability and simple design.  It only gives the time, which is all I want from a watch."
5.0,I just loved this sweater! I styled it with a mesh long sleeve bodysuit underneath and I just loved it! You can view on my instagram @jordenjakobs
5.0,Love my tote was exactly what I was looking for ...
5.0,"Being very picky, I was very pleased with the quality of this pretty bracelet. Easy on and off, just fun to wear."
5.0,Ordered item then it was delayed. I ordered again and received in time for halloween. Its kids size but fits adult too. It bends a bit depending on your head size but its still nice.
5.0,Completely recycleable
5.0,"I ordered this wrap for my January wedding. I've looked at dozens of wraps and reviews of wraps before finally ordering this one. I am glad I did! As other reviewers noted, the faux fur is soft and the satin lining is soft, too. No yucky smell at all. In fact, it had a pleasant &#34;new store&#34; smell. It drapes beautifully as shown in the promotional photo. Perhaps best of all, it doesn't shed. I wore it around the house to see if it would shed and I even petted it: no faux furballs! I am so glad I purchased this and can't wait to wear it on my wedding day and on other days, too."
5.0,These are great fix fine
5.0,Iove this symbolic wedding band set.
5.0,I had been looking for a tunic shirt that had a little more going on but was still fitted to ones figure this would be that tunic. The fabric feels great and isn't cheap looking and the sleeves are just long enough so it doesn't bunch up under the arm like most women's shirts.
5.0,Arrived quickly and in perfect packaging . It is a nice black flowy top / blouse . I liked it because it is simple & black and short sleeved  so I can wear it in the summer days to come . It has nice details in the back and the front bottons are cute . The sleeves are very feminine and cute . The only thing that I didn't like was that it was a bit too loose in the front however I am going to have it taken in a bit so it can adjust better to my figure so it does not  make me look pregnant . You can totally wear this to a buffet to hide the&#34;  food baby &#34;.
5.0,I actually ordered an extra large even though I typically wear a large and I can’t even tell you how pleased I was with the fit. I felt beautiful and that’s a huge deal. Highly suggest
5.0,My son wanted this apron for a movies he is making.  I think it has fit the bill for his needs.
5.0,"Doesn't hurt your waist, doesnt loosen if you don't want it to. Good belt 👍"
5.0,"I had previously purchased three pair of these, they were so comfy that I purchased three more pair."
5.0,Oh my gosh...  Love it..  I want more !
5.0,"As usual Lanz makes a high quality nightgown.  It's soft, warm, and snuggly!"
5.0,Worked great for what I needed them for in the thorny part of my garden. They seem a tad small for me and I normally wear small sized gloves.
5.0,This dress was literally perfect. It was so cute and fit so nicely. I will DEF be buying another one
5.0,Me llegó súper temprano y la tela es muy buena
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:822b8aed7111ab75fedb1fd25334fa8d]] I bought this dress for a military homecoming - wanted it to be flirty, flowy but classic. It definitely delivered! The elastic hit my waist in just the right spot, and the adjustable ties made it easy to tighten to my liking. I did use a bit of double sided tape to hold down the chest material and I knew it’d be breezy and that I’d be moving a lot.<br /><br />All in all, a really great purchase and surprisingly good quality. Took a video of me trying it on to see the fit. I’m 5’8, 150 lbs and wear a C cup for reference!"
5.0,"Great shirt. Love the quality of the decoration and the garment did not shrink much at all even though my husband accidentally dried it . It has stayed true to color and I get complements whenever I wear it. Because, the golden girls. 😃"
5.0,"True to size, very pretty, stretchy. It looks and feels a lot nicer when it’s on."
5.0,These are a really cool pair of sunglasses. I love the way they fit not to heavy just perfect.
5.0,but that's alright I gave them to kids that did not have much thank you
5.0,"These were a gift for my 10-year old granddaughter, so I was happy that they were lightweight and very colorful. She loves peacocks and was thrilled with them. I very nearly kept them for myself, but I didn't want to be a Greedy Granny!"
5.0,Bought these for my 17 month old. They stay on her face nicely. She loves to wear them and looks absolutely precious.
5.0,I absolutely love this! It is gorgeous and it looks great with leggings! Fit was as expected!
5.0,I love it💕
5.0,Great item that is super sexy and very comfortable. It fits very good and looks good when worn either way.  The husband likes it when I wear it with the holes in the front (for obvious reasons).  This will make you feel super sexy.
5.0,Hugs the body. Feels amazing. Looks amazing.
5.0,"This was a gift for a friend's son. He wears a 4/5T and is 4 years old. After reading the reviews that it fits really small, we decided to get the size 6 (largest size available). Lucky there was not a larger size available, we would have purchased a 7. The 6 fits as a 6 should, so it is a bit big. Since it is a jacket and still early fall, he should be able to wear it for awhile. He is just rolling up the sleeves a bit for now."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress! I don’t really leave reviews but I’m starting to get into the habit of doing so. I am 5’7” and 155 lbs, chest 38C and a size Large fit me perfectly. I can’t even describe how much I love the pockets! They’re perfect for holding my phone (iPhone 6s) and I have no problems. To me the elastic band just makes the dress so much better as well and the fabric is pretty comfortable."
5.0,Such cute and comfortable socks!  Would highly recommend!
5.0,High quality product. Just what I expect from Hanna Andersson!
5.0,great colors and many compliments.<br />i was glad it came back in stock.
5.0,"I shared with my neighbors little girl, age 11, she just loved them, me too."
5.0,Lost it within the first week. but they are absolutely stunning. I love it! Planning to re-order because of how cute they are!!
5.0,"This fit good and add the support needed for my varicose veins without adding extra bulk to my shoes,"
5.0,"I appreciate the brown to black nature of it. It's flexible enough for a job that requires a normal amount of movement, but sturdy enough to last you a while."
5.0,"One of my favorite dresses, have it in several colors! Cute, cool, and comfy!"
5.0,These glasses are getting impossible to find in the store - and they are my favorite.  So I came here and found them for more than half the normal retail and they were sent to me in two days!! I pay $25.99 for these and got them here for $9.99. They arrived in perfect condition with a case as they do in the store.  Thank you for the great glasses!
5.0,Love you material super soft doesn't wrinkle.  Always a plus when you have pockets.
5.0,"This swimsuit was perfect for the Miami Beach. My measurements are a little weird so I initially ordered this in an XX-Large based off of reviews, but the bottoms were entirely too big. So I sent it back and got the X-Large. I could have used a Large or Medium in the top, because I am smaller up top then in the hips, but unfortunately you can't mix and match.<br /><br />Overall it was still a good buy"
5.0,I got this for my cousin as a present and she LOVED !! them great fit and cant go wrong with the price.  If you like Totoro this is a great purchase
5.0,Super cute looks just like the photo. Perfect for summer!
5.0,"Looks great, fits great, and quality is great! Would recommend to a friend!"
5.0,So far these lenses are great. They fit like expected. But it has only been 1 day.. So there are still plenty of days to come..
5.0,This works great to preserve and renew birkenstock soles!  The cork on my daughter's birks was looking really bad - she used this on them and they look great.
5.0,I returned. But the quality and color very good
5.0,"Very pretty colors, good golfing shirt, fits well."
5.0,"use this mount, works very well"
5.0,"Nice color texture and luster ,very thin but uniform ,expensive not a bargain"
5.0,This watch band is so comfortable! Let's me show off my team spirit for sure!
5.0,Very cool little finger board
5.0,"It fits and holds up well. I lost the first one and ordered another. After about a year the first one that I had lost, I found and I wore it a few times and the elastic broke. I tied it back together and hope to wear it a little longer. It seems to be good stuff. Love the look."
5.0,SUPER cute and nice soft material.
5.0,"This worked perfectly for me, but I have a very small head. Child sized fitted hats are just a touch too small for me (for reference)."
5.0,Cute and very soft. Smaller than other poms I've gotten so it works great on smaller handbags. Good quality clasp.
5.0,"These anklets are better quality than expected, plenty of links for adjustability. Will buy again"
5.0,"Love this dress! I was worried about the length since a lot of reviews commented on how long it was but I'm 5'4 1/2"", got a small and the length is perfect. I can wear flats but will still look good with heels. Color is awesome!"
5.0,Me gusta  quiero tener todos los colores
5.0,Wash inside out in delicates so the image isn't destroyed.
5.0,I really love this dress. It fit exactly as I expected. It’s beautiful and fits nicely in all body types. After I got my order and tried it on I went back online to pick other color & styles of this dress & brand. I’ve always been a naturally smaller person up until the last few years so I’m not exactly confident in certain dresses as I’m trying to get my body back. But this dress looks good and I know it would look good on my past smaller frame. I’m 5’3 & 150 lbs. now. I was around 110-120. So looks good on shorter people of different sizes. I’m sure it would look great on taller women too. It’s just one of those brands that gets it right. I recommend this dress for anyone that finds the style pleasing.
5.0,"Bracelet is beautiful.  Beads are a good size, not too big and not real small.  Made of good quality, very sturdy bracelet.  Love it!"
5.0,Perfect for my baby girl. I love it
5.0,"Came folded in a tiny bag, hung it up and all the wrinkles fell out. It's beautiful, the fabric is wonderful and the cut of the hem is perfect for a petite person who doesn't want to bother with hemming"
5.0,"This product is awesome! It fits well, and the makers are nice :) I would recommend this product to anyone!"
5.0,Fits well my daughter loves this dress. Purchased last minute to replace dress that was not arriving on time
5.0,"The material feels like something high quality,doesn’t feel cheap. I received many compliments when I wore it!"
5.0,nice shirt. Very pleased.
5.0,Love these. Look great on. Look more expensive than they are.
5.0,Very pretty! I used it in my maternity photos and at my baby shower. Definitely order a size up like everyone else is saying. The fabric is super lightweight and soft.
5.0,Satisfied with bands
5.0,"Fits well, attractive and brings color into my life! So we’ll made."
5.0,"I am a bigger lady with very large legs. These are just right to keep swelling from occuring. Bought a size up for when I already have swelling.<br />The sock material is what I would describe as ridge-y, and my touch sensitivity can be worn thin.<br />I am going to buy a 2nd pair thou."
5.0,Absolutely love them! They feel amazing are super cute and stay put while working out!
5.0,form fitting but it will work at the beach if you don't like long board shorts.
5.0,"I recently received a promotion at work.  I thought I wonder how expensive socks make your feet feel.  My opinion is to Try a Tube sock on then try an expensive pair of socks on.  In my opinion, they are definitely worth the extra $6.00 a pair.  I could just be strange but they make me feel better. LOL"
5.0,"Great product, just like advertised."
5.0,Got this dress for my mom. Picture doesn’t do justice. It’s more coral in person. She’s 5’2 and we got a XL to be more flowy. The slip was waaay shorter than the dress so she put her own slip so it also wouldn’t be sheer.
5.0,"Material is good ,comfortable for my son ,that has autism he only like sweatsuit..no jeans..will recommend"
5.0,Great fabric and colors.
5.0,Super warm nice material.  It's beautiful.  Would definitely recommend.
5.0,"This is a great blouse for the office with a true classic look. The color is attractive and this is the type of blouse that you can wear for years, through different fashion trends. My only advice is to make sure to wear a camisole underneath."
5.0,Good soft material and fit as expected
5.0,"I like these pants. They feel nice, aren't too sheer and they're very comfortable. Great price. I'm 5'1 and weigh 110 pounds. I wear small in most brands of yoga pants but these did seem to run a little smaller. Still, I'm happy with them but think I'd order the medium next time. I'm fine with these other than that."
5.0,"A little bit lighter color than the picture but still a wonderful piece! Heavy, with cute shell clasp in back. At first I was worried it might not hold the weight, but it's made well and is sturdy. I am complimented on them whenever I go out. Of all my pearls my husband has complemented me on these the most. They are really worth having. Dress them up or down, wear them year round! So versatile.  Shipped fast, would buy again!"
5.0,"Best made t-shirts I have ever worn, their quality is super premium!"
5.0,I absolutely love this. It has great meaning to me.
5.0,Wicked mask. Durable and clean. Has 2 elastic strips to fit onto your head. Easy to get on and off. Breathable and mask is too cool. Arrived on time. It's a steal for what your getting in return.
5.0,"Warm and beautiful, but I am 5'2 and the sleeves are little short. I wish they have more , so I can order more."
5.0,Excellent product for the price.
5.0,"Love the product, but wire in band broke in 5 months."
5.0,For the money can't beat um. Will have a better idea of durability when I get my grandkids together crank up some Z Z top and make a cheap sunglasses video.
5.0,Love this skirt the colors are bright and the material is light and airy perfect for summer. Only draw back is that the waist runs small.
5.0,Our girls at summer day camp loved these! Thank you for a great product.
5.0,I watched Money Heist with my husband (we rarely find shows we can enjoy together) and bought this mask to freak him out. He laughed so hard. GREAT gift if you are watching this show!
5.0,This is a cute fun dress for the summer.
5.0,I am very happy that I purchased these reading glasses. They work really well for me. The price makes these a great deal. They seem to be less flimsy and better constructed compared to other reading glasses.
5.0,Great quality and they look amazing.
5.0,Comfy to use and workout
5.0,"Beautiful colors, and very soft! It is very thin but gives nice protection from wind, or air conditioner. Would definitely buy again. I bought one as a gift, and the recipient really likes it."
5.0,Love them real silver!!
5.0,Beautiful piece. Quality in make is very good.

5.0,looks fabulous on
5.0,"My husband was looking for a sweat shirt that didn't fit in some areas and not fit in other areas.  He a size 2XL but average height.  This sweat shirt is perfect, fits in the shoulders, waist and the shirt comes just below his waist.  Great vibrant colors, nice thick material.  Well made"

5.0,Love this ring. It fits my boyfriend perfectly and looks amazing on him. Definitely a great buy for anyone. Thanks.
5.0,"I previously had the leather version with the magnetic clasp. First off, the magnetic clasp came undone all the time. Second, the leather broke away from the clasp and I had to junk it. This version seems to be holding up much, much better. I don't know how wet I plan to get it, but I think it will hold up well. The clasp is very secure, much more so than the magnetic one. Definitely worth the price."
5.0,I bought this to swap out from a silicone band and am very pleased. The band is a soft fabric with just the right amount of stretch to hold my Ionic where I want it without squeezing. I love it.
5.0,My Grandson loves these slippers and wears them everyday after School. They fit him well and he loves to wear them.I would recommend these slippers and rate them as 5 stars as they are very well made and comfortable.
5.0,Love it! Wore it for my 55th birthday!
5.0,"This is my daughters favorite leotard to wear to her dance classes. The material is comfortable, breathable, and has withheld lots of wear and washing very well. This leotard gets washed and worn at least once a week and the material still looks new and the color hasn't faded at all. There is some stretch to this material that will allow my daughter to wear it for longer as she grows, which is important since she's in dance classes from August to May each year. We want a leotard that will last and this is it!"
5.0,It's very thick and will keep you warm!
5.0,Love they make Charms with glasses for my granddaughter who wears glasses!!
5.0,Very comfortable and stay up. Cute print.
5.0,Used for bridal shower and wedding party. Fun look for some photos!

5.0,If one must wear a mask you might as well try to kill it. D 1/7 1971.
5.0,This tshirt so super soft!!!! Love it!
5.0,Great design and hat.
5.0,Good pendant. I know this is a late review but it's still looking fashionable and in good quality.<br />No complaints.
5.0,Just I like it
5.0,"Good material, very comfortable. My fiancé loves this and the color is a perfect blue"
5.0,Good price. Looks great.

5.0,"They fit perfectly! These have great support and lift, they are so muchhhhh better than wearing a regular everyday bra!"
5.0,JUST AS DESCRIBED AND ARRIVED ON TIME!
5.0,Bought this for my future daughter-in-law...she LOVES it!  I'm a Dooney girl myself ;)!
5.0,These are soooo flattering on me! I’m short but pretty curvy for my height so I was curious to see how these would look and lemme tell ya these shorts were made for girls with bootayy. Bought a second pair after trying these on!
5.0,"My brother liked it ,Warm just the right size!"
5.0,I looked at a series of Bond style NATOs for my new watch and decided to try this model and a few others. The nylon is thicker and stiffer than the cheaper varieties but I have not found it to be uncomfortable on the wrist.  The stitching is top quality and all the holes and strap ends are nicely melted to prevent fraying.  I have been wearing this for about a month and have not changed this out for any of the other straps because I have been so pleased.  I have found this brand to be well worth the few extra dollars. This would be just as at home on luxury watch or a simple Timex.
5.0,"Super comfy, super warm"
5.0,I'm taking pictures now and sending to my wife. I will be trying on the men's stuff to check sizing. And Saturday my son will. But from first look and touch they feel as good as some over my better quality ties
5.0,Well made but needed to return bc it was a size too small even though I ordered the correct size for my daughter.
5.0,Vibrant colors.  Love the look under leggings. Bit short for a dress I’m 5’7” bought 2 more
5.0,This was exactly what I was looking for for a gift. Great quality and very nice stitching.
5.0,My kiddo loved this and it keeps her warm during football games.
5.0,"I'm delighted with my overalls. I'm 5'2&#34; and about 125 lbs and they fit really comfortably. They are VERY baggy which is exactly what I wanted. They are not ridiculously long, and I do not need to cuff them. They are nicely made, and seem to be decent quality. the material, the stitching, the details -- all completely appropriate for the price. No complaints. I am thinking about buying another pair!"
5.0,"Loved them, daughter in law requested them for Christmas she had a pair already she loved and the puppy at them. Now he has a pair and she has a pair. She ran around in them all day Christmas."
5.0,"Nice laces, slightly waxed and stiff, true to length as well."
5.0,I like this one so much that I have ordered this more th a n once.
5.0,"Love these glasses! The color and shape are an absolute classic and the quality of these glasses is impressive for such a low price. All SOJOS glasses are great, I have 3 pairs."
5.0,Perfect quality love it
5.0,The fit was perfect and they look very sexy! The material is silky smooth against my skin.
5.0,Lightweight great for sleeping in
5.0,"I'm a white girl with natural corkscrew-curly hair, so this cap is perfect for preserving my hair overnight. Easy to put on, loose enough to not put too much pressure on my hair,  The band is tight enough to not slip off during the night, and barely leaves a mark on my forehead in the morning. Plus, it's super cute!"
5.0,"FITS my fossil will probably buy more. Similar quality as fossils band, can't complain"
5.0,"I wanted to buy decent boots for my bf who is on his feet all day as a commercial painter.  He doesn't like steel-toed boots because of the weight, and he runs hot so in the summer his heavy winter boots make his feet sweat like crazy and are just too much.  I'd initially bought a much more expensive pair of boots, but he didn't want me spending that kind of money on them so I returned them.  I still had these ones in my cart, and when he saw them he liked them and the price was reasonable.  I had my misgivings because of the ""you get what you pay for"" mantra in my head, but went ahead an ordered them.  He really likes them.  They give him sufficient support while keeping his feet cool... and saving money is an added bonus!"
5.0,dont waste your money on super expensive balaclavs. these things are WAY cheaper and they do the exact same job.
5.0,"I love theses shorts; I would be interested in other patterns and designs, when you get more please let me know"
5.0,"For the price, I wasn't expecting the quality to be great. But it is. I gave this to my husband for our 5 year anniversary. The symbolism for that year is wood. He loved it."
5.0,"Loved these!! They were a little too big, which is perfect considering super tight leggings are never fun. I haven't worn these to work out in but I would imagine they'd be equally as comfortable for that. For now they are great to lounge in or for a casual day out!"
5.0,Absolutely love this bracelet great price and i haven't taken it off since i received it. Wonderful simple item that can be worn with everything ď
5.0,It's very light and flattering...has the ability to hide extra belly pounds.  Lol
5.0,Perfect!! My two year old loves it! Was able to size it down so it doesn't fall off her wrist
5.0,"Shockingly, it looks like the picture...."
5.0,You can get away with these for work they are so comfy and they have professional looking back pockets.
5.0,Like the pink color have lots  apace
5.0,"true to size, soft light weight fabric for the warmer seasons and super comfortable! I love that the arm holes arn't to tight or pinchy with these gowns. I loved my first order so much, i bought two more just like it!"
5.0,"good fit, haven't used them yet.  will see how chlorine effects fading etc"
5.0,Very happy. Got to me very fast.box you keep it it is very nice. Lots of compliments when I have it.
5.0,"You've got to be kidding, right?  At this price this may well be the finest writing instrument ever produced in the history of humanity.  Every time I use one of these I can't help but reflect what an awesomely productive world we live in, when for literal pennies we can mass produce an instrument like this.  Along with, oh say the Kindle or a Samsung Note 4, products like this humble fountain pen define an age when free markets have permitted a degree of production, and consumer choice, undreamed by all previous generations of mankind, and resulting wealth of consumer choices.  Bravo Producers!  Bravo distributors!  Bravo Amazon!  Even if human folly should bring this all crashing down (and killing golden geese is an old human community tradition) tomorrow, it's glory will endure forever!  This is a very straightforward traditional fountain pen design, with a plastic material case, a very standard hard plastic feed and collector, and a steel, precious metal coated, split breather hole nib.  It's a utilitarian object with direct design references to the 1st generation of widely produced fountain pens in the 1920s and 30s.  It has no muss, no fuss, but the quality control is impressive, the quality of the feed, collector, nib and fill adapter ('International' screw type) is remarkable given the price point.  Fountain Pens today are largely Fetish Objects, and as such there's little value to this one, except in the sense above, as testament to a civilization that is at the brink of realizing the age-old impossibilities of ending structural famine, widespread absolute illiteracy, uncontrolled infectious disease and (in large part) even the scourge of war.  As an small, iconic totem to the capitalist free market's capacity to 'provide the goods', humble and workaday, to the mass of mankind at a low enough price that anyone can have what only a few scant generations ago would have been luxury beyond reach of all but the elite this item may be the most Fetishistic of all the Fountain Pens ever produced, and the most aesthetically  esoteric.  As an everyday working pen, it definitely works, reliably, well, at a price less than a tithe, even less than a percent, that of fancier versions that effectively work no better!"
5.0,"Hello,<br />I Absolutely love my gold cross necklace. It is very beautiful. I just wish it was a little longer, but it is beautiful. Thanks for selling an awesome product.<br />Blessings,<br />Joy🤗"
5.0,So comfortable and soft. Easy to wash .
5.0,I have been looking for skirts to wear to work  and I came across this one and I am so happy that I did!!! it came so quickly than expected and fits perfectly! Very elegant and the material is nice too.Guess has some of the best clothes ever. Highly recommend!
5.0,"These are great.  They're very lightweight plastic, but they seem pretty durable.  I bought the 4.00 strength because I need a lot of magnification and they work really well.  They're light enough to be really comfortable and they're cute, too.  I have a pair everywhere I need them, including my purse.  I just got them today, so the jury's still out on how long they'll last, but for the price I can't complain.  No more clunky readers hanging around my neck."
5.0,"My son really, really wanted a pooping pig for Christmas.  It had to be a REAL pooping pig though - not those fake things that dispense candy pebbles when you lift the tail.  I told him the only way to get a real pooping pig was to get a real pig, which is not gonna happen!  He insisted a friend at school had one.  Well, Amazon search to the rescue.  I got this for him and he LOVES IT!"
5.0,My daughter in law looked beautiful at our granddaughters baby shower! It fit perfectly at 8 months pregnant

5.0,"Dispite these being a one size fits all there a little short for me, however they do allow for great compression of leg. Well made strong fabric."

5.0,This ring is absolutely stunning. All my girlfriends are jealous. (haha) Such a beautiful blue with lots of presence. Thank You.
5.0,Bang for your buck<br />Just the right size and feels very durable<br />I have no doubts buying rhis bag<br />Great for camping amd going to a friends house
5.0,These work very well. I use them for running and they absorb a lot of sweat and keep my hair out of my face.
5.0,Oh yes everything arrived on time and was as described. The material is very soft.
5.0,I had no idea how to organize my daughter's hair clips and did not want one of the frames with ribbon. This seemed like a cute idea. It came today and is PERFECT!! Super adorable- I just love it!! Very reasonable too. Looks like something you'd find on Etsy for double.
5.0,"I've been wearing the standard, cheap Fruit of the Loom underwear most of my adult life. I recently got sick of how they looked during summer time, hanging out at the beach or in the park during the summer. Also, the cheap underwear rides up near my junk and I'm constantly pulling it down.<br /><br />The JINSHI underwear I received, while a bit more expensive, is VASTLY superior. I had no idea what I was missing (no I have not been paid to write this review lol).<br /><br />It's silky but stretchy material is super comfortable. The colors and shine the band have and the cool patterns give a bit of a pop in my outfit. Sure, most people never see it, but it's a nice little confidence boost knowing you feel and look good in your underwear, especially as a man.<br /><br />All of my underwear packets were different designs thankfully and all had the noodle window (can't remember what that's officially called) and it's actually super easy to use and whip out if you just need to pee.<br /><br />Make sure to order one size up. I'm 6'2"" 190lbs and an XL fits perfectly.<br /><br />I'm so glad I've found these. I'll almost certainly only buy nicer underwear like this going forward."
5.0,"Haven't worn it, but was unaware it has a short brim on it like a ball cap."
5.0,Great quality and looks as shown.
5.0,"Very pretty necklace, I already got compliments when I wore it for the first time :)"
5.0,"Cute, and nicer quality than I was expecting for baby socks! Would buy again."

5.0,These are very well made and comfortable. I use them daily. A very good value.

5.0,This coat is so warm and comfy! I like that the fur around the hood is detachable. This is a great winter/cold weather coat.
5.0,This is a present for my granddaughter.  I liked it so much I ordered another for my daughter.
5.0,"amazing, i use it for the gym and hiking, i dont even feel it at all, super comfortable and people dont even know its a silicon ring"
5.0,Luv it💚😍
5.0,"My granddaughter love the boots, she said they are comfy and warm! Yay for grandma!"
5.0,"They fit perfectly.. or at least as good as I’m going to get. I typically order a size up from what I think my waist is because my legs are so thick and these were no exception. However, they are stretchy enough where I didn’t have to go so big that the waist felt baggy. What I like about these pants that are uncommon is that they don’t bag out as bad from wear. I’m a bit of a scrub and so I wear my pants 2-3 times before washing and these stay fitting nicely throughout.<br /><br />Height: I am fairly short and the pant legs are pretty bunched up at the bottom. They have maybe 3 inches or more of extra length for someone who is taller. I will say that the grey area is just above my knee so anyone taller it would prob be at bottom thigh.<br /><br />Pockets: I had read a lot of reviews either loving or completely hating the pockets. Those who love them seem to love the depth of some of the pockets lower on the legs which can be beneficial but I mostly just like the look and rarely actually use them. Those who hate the pockets seem to dislike the fact that they don’t have pockets in the normal place where it is easy to access with hands. However, it does have one pocket like this in the right side. So I am able to have easy access to my phone but not so much my wallet on the left side. For me this is not the biggest deal since I don’t need constant access to my wallet. If I was a lefty I would be bothered."
5.0,"I love this scarf, I wore it to work and my boss didn't notice the skulls, I really felt like I was in my 20s again. I'm 54. 🤟"
5.0,I have been looking for a detective badge for a prop that I am working on and wanted it to look like the real thing and not cheaply made.  So glad I found this one because it is adorable and cute!  It is made of quality material and not plastic.  I purchase a stuffed animal that is a detective and pinned this badge on him.  I just love it! Lol
5.0,My husband loves his new jacket. Ordered an extra large. It fits him great. It came when it was scheduled.
5.0,I really like the fabric it doesn't feel heavy. But I order a large because in the description said it runs small. And I had to return it way too big. I order a small I hope it fits.
5.0,"Absolutely loved this dress!!! It was a smidgen tight at the top of the zipper. I am 5'3"" 132#. I would have kept it but decided to go with a longer version for the event I'm attending. Absolutely gorgeous dress and at an amazing price point."
5.0,"My wife uses these all the time, very strong and durable!"
5.0,Looks great almost real looking
5.0,"I love this bag- has many pockets & storage spaces...I am planning a trip to Europe and wanted a bad that i could use as a camera bag for a DSLr camera and a few lenses but also as a carry all for money, travel guides, makeup, RX etc  . I usually carry a large pocket book so I figured one bag would be better than carrying a separate camera bag.  After shopping around I went directly to the ebags site and got the bag for $45 plus FREE shipping- It was delivered and a clasp was broken they asked no questions they emailed me a fed Ex form and sent me a new bag!  So check ebags first and watch for their sales!"
5.0,love them. great fit - not too tight on head. durable. stylish. the box helps keep them in good shape.
5.0,These Indera Mills thermals are the best thermals I've found for the price. I have a few and they seem to ne holding up great through many wash and wear cycles. Excellent value for the money.
5.0,"Absolutely perfect. Just like the picture, no flaws."
5.0,"Wonderful glasses! I’ll be back for more from these guys for sure. I also got a very nice email and an invite to contact customer Sapport, but no need because everything I received is wonderful. And a huge thumbs up on the case. It would be nice if I could hang It from my belt or from my baggage because bags are always extremely full and there’s really no room inside theme. I Want everyone to buy from these guys. You won’t be disappointed."
5.0,Love these shirts! Super soft and cute! Will buy more!
5.0,Loved the charm! Timely deliverance too!
5.0,First socks that really fit the size that they claim to!
5.0,Perfect for my 2 year old.
5.0,"Love this dress I am 5'9"" and it fits perfectly and the length is great. Extremely flattering"
5.0,"Gorgeous gown for Renaissance, ring hope underneath, gown exactly as pictures"
5.0,It fits well.  I like the fabric for the summer weather.  I like it better without the belt.
5.0,This is super cute and comfy!  So flattering... for once I'm not constantly tugging and adjusting like I am with most dresses.  You can dress it up with a wedge or dress down with flip flops... I'll be getting a lot of use out of this!  Definitely recommend.  I am 5'4 160 lbs and the medium fits well.
5.0,"Love this top!! I am broad-shouldered /36C and the Medium fits perfectly! The sleeves have some elastic in the top part so the shirt doesn’t fall down when you walk around.  The sleeve length is great, baggy fabric for sleeves is comfortable to wear (you can lift your arms).  Well sewn, true to color. Great autumn or winter top for going out!"
5.0,"Perfect fit. Not too short as many of my t-shirts and the print has a very nice, glossy quality. I buy *tons* of Overwatch apparel (3 jackets, 3 hoodies, the full Pajamei set, socks, like 10 shirts...) and I love this fit. The icon on the chest is sort of small but the one on the back is huge and awesome."
5.0,Super happy. Nicely made. Are comfortable and are worn under work pants for a construction type worker. Very flexible and nice for extra layer underneath work pants to control sweating. Would buy again. Fits a small guy. Size 29/30 waist.
5.0,She loved getting this
5.0,"Great dress, love the color (Red)"
5.0,You will love this outfit on your daughter; Absolutely beautiful!!!
5.0,Such a cute dress and at a great price. I do hand wash and let it air dry. Very flattering 😍
5.0,"Fits great, double lined material. Very nice product"
5.0,"I bought these for my daughter as winter is brutal and her leggings never quite cover her ankles.  These leg warmers are cute, warm and inexpensive.  I wish I would have ordered more."
5.0,Classy black dress that can be worn anywhere! Fits perfect and  I love it!
5.0,"Love this thing.  Have worn it in most of it's configurations while running and downhill skiing and it never disappoints.  It's my go to headwear and facemask now when the weather is cold.  Putting through a several wash cycles has not diminished it at all, the print is like new and there is no loss to it's stretch or function.<br /><br />On the other hand, I also have a non-print version, and the material doesn't seem to be quite as nice.  Can't put my finger on it, just doesn't quite have the same feel or fit quality as the printed version.  Still good, and if I only got the non-printed one  I would still think it was an excellent buy."
5.0,"Nice product, recommend"
5.0,this is super cute.. I just love it.
5.0,"Love this dress. I'm 5'8, size 14. I bought an xl and it fights perfect. Perfect length. Maybe could have gotten away with a large but I'm satisfied with the xl and I feel a large may of been to short. Can't wait to wear this out and about this summer. Going to order more colors!"
5.0,"I wear them everyday, I love these slippers.  I have washed them a few times already and they have help up well, and they are still soft and cozy."
5.0,Pretty pink and flowing.  Excellent by for the price!
5.0,"I purchased several pairs of leggings and four arrived today.  Hands down,  these are my favorite.  They comfy, cozy-- I can see myself lounging in these too often.  They flattering and stay put on my waist, which is difficult to find.  Definitely five stars and I definitely recommend!<br /><br />I sized up and probably would again,  but these would be fine to go with the smaller of two (if you are wavering).<br /><br />I"
5.0,"My son loves sonic.  Does not wearing mask but these are soft, covers his nose and mouth perfect and comes with wire on the nose to hold in place."
5.0,Luv the maxi dress. Made well & luv the material. Feels very good on.
5.0,Good quality but bigger than expected
5.0,Very comfortable and provides support for my feet.  Easy to install and kept clean. I ordered a second pair.
5.0,The knit is high quality. Medium thick. The cardigan hangs a little long for me. I wanted something that stopped just below my waistline.  I’m still happy with the purchase. And I would recommend the cardigan because it’s very nice for the price.
5.0,A birthday gift for My granddaughter who works in a nursing home. This item is in compliance and she said it was comfortable plus it was adorable. Bonus filters included made it nice as it is also washable
5.0,"Even though the housing is plastic, these are beautiful earrings! I wore them to a formal ball with an emerald green dress and got several compliments. Come with 2 sets of backs which is a very nice plus."
5.0,Great Umbrella canopy is a great fabric and the 360 foot Pedal is easy to use! Hi
5.0,"Great quality, it's actually a replacement for the same over 3 years old. Faded due to prolonged exposure"
5.0,"Nice fit.  Material a little tricky to shorten by yourself unless you are pretty good with the needle and thread.  They have a lovely, flowing way about them."
5.0,Awesome product!  Very very shiny!
5.0,They appear to be well made. Very cute. They are a present for my granddaughter so I don't know how they will wear but I am very pleased with them.
5.0,"Love it ! And it’s the real POLO brand, very comfortable"
5.0,"The children are back to school in person but they need to be wearing the mask all day with only 10-15 minute breaks , but they love these masks I got them for their Christmas sticks but they can be worn with the Christmasy pattern or the solid black they are great quality and held up great after washing on the delicate cycle."
5.0,These are SO gorgeous I can’t stop looking at them. I love how they are frameless and are oversized and just so so so so pretty and well made
5.0,I love the way the dress is made I need that same dress in a large plus but I can't want until the end of the month for the dress I have a Wedding to attend in two weeks and I would like to wear that dress
5.0,These are reader sunglasses and so stylish and cute.  I can see to read on the beach which is a plus but they are also very attractive.
5.0,"This dress is even more beautiful in person. The material is thick, well made, and holds its structure. My only complaint is the small was not quite as small as I need, but with the belt it is perfectly fine. For reference I am a US size 2 and my measurements are 33-25-35. It hits under the knee at what I call a &#34;tea length,&#34; but I'm 5'2 so that is to be expected. I actually prefer my dresses to fit that way though. Overall I highly recommend this dress! You won't be disappointed!"
5.0,Alittle long on arms but it’s ok
5.0,"Been using everyday out lobster fishing for a couple months now, some of the pots are pretty rough and these skins look like new yet."
5.0,Everything I need for flying fits in this bag and everything is organized. Size is just ok and looks like pro. I recommend this product.
5.0,"A dependable workhorse for daily use. Satisfies all of my requirements for a work bag: (1) must stand up on its own (2) shoulder length straps (3) top enclosure (4) as small as possible but still fits my laptop (5) low profile; does not draw attention to itself (6) sleek, clean lines, no fussy extras (7) lightweight.<br /><br />I would make some suggestions to make it more stylish (slightly wider straps, better leather), but I take a fancier/prettier bag when I travel for work or have client dinners. Overall, a great buy. For the price, I'm thinking about getting a second one just to stock up."
5.0,"This is so cute.  Great little charms. Very comfortable. I got this product at a discount, in exchange for rating the product."
5.0,"This is a really nice medium impact sports bra. It is not too restricting, which makes it more comfortable. The racerback feature is attractive and practical, especially when it comes to adequate support while training. The front is smooth and free of embellishments. The wide elastic under the cups keep the bra flat and prevent roll-ups even while moving. This bra is only slightly on the smaller side. If you are between sizes, then I suggest going up to the larger size. My granddaughter normally usually wears a small in tops, but sometimes needs a medium. This medium sized sports bra fits her perfectly (she is a B cup size, if that helps). She stated that it is very comfortable and she would definitely recommend it."
5.0,I LOVE this dress! Will be ordering others later. It fits perfect and is long. I love the pockets! An added bonus!
5.0,Beautiful costume piece
5.0,"Easy to take off and on, very comfortable. I plan to order more in other colors"
5.0,I love this bra sooooo much! It is so comfortable and just overall the best
5.0,Well made.  Easily washes.
5.0,Very sturdy and easy to adjust straps. The clips grasp firmly onto your shirt keeping everything in place. Haven't noticed anything uncomfortable about them after wearing them a few times at my place of work.
5.0,"Best visor....comfortable, large brim, but not too large, stays in place even with wind!"
5.0,"4 way stretch. Very soft and comfortable material,  if they had shorts I would 100% purchase one . Love the Tommy control."
5.0,Bought these shoes for my daughter. They are adorable!
5.0,Love the way it fits! Kinda winged my sizing and got the perfect size. Accentuates my curves and my guards. Material stretches minimal and feels semi jeggings material but mostly denim
5.0,"Beautiful bag , just the right size for date night!"
5.0,Shoes are great just what I wanted
5.0,"I purchased this for a gift for my mom, who loves owls and her old wallet was breaking. I have to say this product is much more then a coin type of wallet my mom was able to put her blackberry, the 40 type of cards she is forced to tug around with her plus some spare cash. Loungefly made a epic product with this wallet bag . I recommend this to any and all oul fans and lungefly as well."
5.0,"Girls, I love this hoodie! A perfect old school style with a heavier weight that looks great alone or under a top coat or denim jacket. For reference: I’m<br />5’10, size 8/29 36DD and I ordered both the small and medium as I wasn’t sure how snug the small would be. Turns out the small was perfect and I returned the medium which was pretty loose but would work if you wanted a really oversized “boyfriend” relaxed look."
5.0,These are great! No more expensive trips to the shoe shop. My husband changed my tips out in minutes. Now I just need other sizes and colors.
5.0,Cheap made!
5.0,I love this dress! I plain to buy more in various colors.
5.0,This watch is awesome. It is well made and looks amazing. I purchased this watch for my husband as a gift and he loves it. He is a tall/big guy and even had to take a link out and the face is plenty big for his wrist. Great purchase
5.0,Very comfortable and super cute..I haven't wore them yet but will pair them up with jeggings or pleated skirt.
5.0,Nice quality.  Would recommend.
5.0,This bag is exactly as pictured. It is structured and good quality. Love it.
5.0,other reviews say it fit small so i got two sized larger and that worked better
5.0,These masks are so pretty and i get complimented on them all the time. I have a small framed face and they fit perfectly. The inside is soft and not itchy at all. Cute!
5.0,Nice but look like they will scratch pretty easy. Haven’t used them yet.
5.0,"I saw this and i ordered it right away off my sons account ... saw that price and said if it dont look good ill send it back.. It fit excellent i love it cant wait to wear it on Vac ,,,,,,I was kinda iffy because i just had a hysterectomy and my stomach swells really bad .. So i waited to i was fully swollen to try this on it still looked great... I am so happy i bought this dress...."
5.0,True to sixe
5.0,"Full coverage here! I love the cut. I am 5'3, small chested and 153lbs and I went with the medium, despite the fact that i am usually a small. I am also a C. Based on the reviews and my own personal fit/style, I choose medium and I'm glad I did. I bought one in black and one in grey and I love them both. I have a big round butt, and it covers my &#34;shelf&#34; so I can be more modest while working out at my old people gym. I have bought many products from YogaColors. True that the ship time is a little longer than most...it's totally worth the wait. The quality is excellent."
5.0,Just as described and a bunch of earing to have. Great gift
5.0,The same swimsuit was twice as expensive in the store. I loved getting this so much cheaper.
5.0,Great comfy leggings..wash well
5.0,I really like the quality of the leather...the bag seems durable and the design is very functional. I Really like this bag !
5.0,"I am in love with these. They are so different and so adorable. They're going to be my new go-to, I think. Compliments from so many people- from kids to older people- every time I wear them. I'll probably get the silver ones too, I love them so much.<br />Seem good quality (Though the package says lead-compliant, and not lead free) I do have to adjust the hook part to get them through my ear and angle them properly, but they seem to be holding up to that just fine.<br />If you're on the fence, do it. :)"
5.0,Honestly I impulsively bought this but it’s super cute
5.0,Love it! Very cool for this punk rock girl
5.0,Flattering for yoga class or a pair of jeans! Tank is long enough to cover waistband. Stays put and comfortable for workout and yoga.
5.0,"Perfect fit, will be just fine for intended use"
5.0,Much easier to get on than those without zipper.
5.0,Wow! The picture just doesn’t do this outfit justice. The material is so bright and sewing is  flawless! The blouse with the layered ruffles can actually be worn as a dress with tights because the back falls lower than the front! You have two outfits! I am just so pleased and I am definitely going to order from this seller again! I don’t mind paying for postage as it comes through customs and shipping costs money but as a frugal spender I know this quality cant be found many places! It also came in time for Christmas!
5.0,"Super cute and perfect for Halloween. I'm a size 16 and the XXL fits great, could probably even go down a size if you like a more snug fit. Fabric is cheap feeling but it looks great and is comfortable."
5.0,"Super cute and comfortable! I got the gray, size s/m and I'm a 34B with a small rib cage, this fits perfectly. The removable pads are a little too round but I'm small so it's ok but if you have a large chest they probably won't feel right for you. I wouldn't say this offers much support for high intense workouts or running. I got this to wear with tanks and open back tops. Material is nice and stitching appears to be made well too. Wish it came in a wide variety of colors!"
5.0,"My daughter adores this outfit and so do I! She turns 3 this month. I bought the size “2-4”. I thought the top portion would we made out of polyester, but it’s cotton. You’ll have to fluff out the tutu a little because it’ll be flattened from packaging. Only takes 2 seconds to fluff it with your fingers. This is a very cute leotard/tutu!"
5.0,I was expecting dollar store quality but was pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />Very nice costume grade ensemble. Nothing looks cheap or feels flimsy.  Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,"Rather liked Han's dice in Episode 8/Solo, and have been after a reproduction for a bit of time.  The dice themselves are not magnetic, but the chain is, so I've got these stuck to a magnet on a whiteboard in my cube at work.  They're great, and they're subtle.  The dice are about 1/2&#34; cubed, with about a ten inch chain.  The color is a slightly reddish gold.<br /><br />You're not going to do better than this for the price."
5.0,Bought a couple of these hats for work in a central sterile department. Love them! They are so cute and add personal style to our hospital scrubs. Not sure if it the shape of my head or how I wear my hair but they are less “poofy” than I thought they would be. Definitely buying a few more!
5.0,Beautiful! Elegantly designed. Happy customer!
5.0,Exacly what was picured. Great quality n omg its super cute! Great purchase.  Oh n it arrived quick n with no issues
5.0,Great value for your money.  Nice for a gift
5.0,Loved all<br />The earings.
5.0,These are great quality ties for such a great price. You cannot tell the difference between the cheaper ties and the more expensive ties. These feel like real silk. They served their purpose and were very well liked.
5.0,"Very pretty and petite, awesome"
5.0,I bought for my granddaughter for basketball her shoes were a bit too big & these stopped the blisters she was getting
5.0,"Way nicer than the fully waterproof ones that are so slick that it's like wearing a stiff trash bag.  These are soft, pliable and absorbent which depends on a persons needs but if you spill on these it's not just sliding off the bib onto either the floor or another part of your clothes.  Neck is generous enough to be very comfortable and closure feel secure. Even though it's a 5 star it would be nice if underneath or in between layers it did have a little water resistant factor though.  But overall can't beat terrycloth.  Also a plus that it can be washed and probably bleached and then put in the dryer.  Much cleaner than the ones you have to just hand wipe down."
5.0,It's just the cutest thing. Got many compliments on it. I've had it for years now and I still love it.
5.0,Large. Thin. Mouse glides great!
5.0,I ordered these to make original necklaces to sell at a craft sale. I was pleased with the quality. The keys look great and are nice and sturdy. It was easy to create beautiful necklaces. I would definitely order again!
5.0,Cool looking pair of sunglasses. I wear them everywhere and dare i say sometimes at night.
5.0,Wore it to a Grinch themed party and it was great.
5.0,"I have bought two of these Sunglasses! The second one that I got recently has a little darker lens,<br />which I like. The other pair are nice, but for me I need a darker lens.<br />Other than that, for the money, this is great value!<br />Deedee Young"
5.0,Excelente material liviano y compacto. Protectores de buenísima calidad
5.0,"It arrived quickly and definitely clean.<br />After washing it, our baby girl has tried it a few times, and she loves it totally.<br />It is soft, very plush, warm, and comfortable. The yellow color is deep and attractive. Very satisfied."
5.0,It fit perfectly and made me look thinner.
5.0,This is the perfect dress for summer. The nice V cut in the front is very flattering and it has a tie that goes around the waist so it is super flattering. The green pattern with leaves makes this dress looks tropical which I love. It will definitely be packed for our trip to Hawaii. I am normally a size 10/12 and ordered a large. I did have a little trouble zipping it up by myself but my husband was able to help and solved that problem.
5.0,"I bought this for a cocktail dress themed night on a girls weekend, which is coming up. This is very flattering, good quality and looks far more expensive than it was.  The side zipper makes it easy to take off and on, and is comfortable to wear.  I am 5’5 and about 145 lbs. and fairly large chested, for reference."
5.0,"True to size, washed well. I thought the dots would fade in the wash but they haven’t yet! I do wish this had attached shorts underneath for modesty."
5.0,Like… T-shirt material. Nice and cool
5.0,"Great, comfy house shoe!"
5.0,These socks are SO nice ! They are super thick and warm . The inside is nice and fuzzy . Great for the cold winters here in Maine .
5.0,Very comfortable sports bras.
5.0,He thanks me every time he wears it
5.0,Very good quality leather.
5.0,Warm. Warm. Warm. Warm. Waterproof. Warm. What else do you need to know? Buy them!<br /><br />They do run small.
5.0,Gift for mom...she loved them
5.0,Fantastic gloves.  once you wear them in they will be wonderful.
5.0,"This gown is really soft and made out of that soft/stretchy material that’s so comfortable for sleeping. Fits loose but you can also make it look cute. Nothing to dislike on this purchase. I need another one, I love it.<br />-<br />Este pijama es realmente suave y está hecho de un material suave y elástico que es  idealmente  y cómodo para dormir. No aprieta porque es suelto, pero a la vez hace buen cuerpo. No tengo quejas sobre la compra. Necesito otro pijama de estos con urgencia, me encanto el producto, era just lo que buscaba."
5.0,Comfortable and convenient. Easy keeping up with my keys when going into stores. Never having to dig through my purse for them. Love it
5.0,"It's cute, not scratching up and stays closed. Good product"
5.0,They are absolutely gorgeous and look very elegant.  Great quality.  Love them!
5.0,"I am very pleased with these bras! They are comfortable, fit is excellent, fabric is soft and they don't roll up from the bottom, straps stay in place! The removable  pads offer added modesty and can be adjusted for a more custom fit.<br />I am a happy customer!"
5.0,My granddaughters eyes just lite up when she opened her slippers on Christmas Eve. They fit perfect and are well made.
5.0,Worked well with my costume.  The plastic mask had a bit of a plastic scent.
5.0,"This jacket is bulletproof and for the price JC Motors is selling it, it is a steal. If you can have only one jacket this is the one.  The removal Gortex linear makes this jacket waterproof when you need it and easily removable when you don’t. The protection is second to none. You won’t find a better deal. Fits true to size."
5.0,Very comfortable. Feet stay warm. No break-in period!
5.0,Stretched a little over time but I’m tough of my things and work with my hands so that can be a reason. Good quality and cute
5.0,I wore these in a wedding then again for an Oscar party. The quality as great! Very fun!!
5.0,I absolutely LOVE this product! I have a large mid section I bought a 6x but I needed a 4x I was going to return the 6x but I ended up giving it to my sister I have lost a total of 3.5 inches from my waist in 1 month I am going to increase my workout! loosing the inches where I want really motivates me in my weightloss goals will be adding photos soon
5.0,You dont have to be a skinny person to wear this! LOVE IT!
5.0,"Welp, this is amazing. I bought it so I could stop having 3 different jackets for different temps/weather conditions, and it's surpassed my expectations. I live in NYC and wore it in 30 degree weather with just a t-shirt, and was still toasty warm all through my Central Park walk. I wear a 36D bra size and bought a Large, and it fits perfectly, with room for a bulky sweater underneath if I so choose. Buy now; you won't regret it."
5.0,"Is a dream  dresss!! looks better than in the picture!!! the most beautiful red! long to the floor,<br />I'm 5.10&#34;. Very elegant and streachs."
5.0,Quality feels amazing not too think and very durable my 3y/o is wearing a 5 and it’s pretty much how I expected it to fit. She’s 3’ 28lbs
5.0,"Really help me with night driving, would definitely recommend!"
5.0,I bought the earrings to compliment the chocolate ring and it is a match made by Willy Wonka!  Love it!
5.0,Just as described!  A great deal.
5.0,I use these all the time when I do piercings and have ordered more the once. I have no complaints and neither do my customers
5.0,"Great looking, for the purpose.  Great fit."
5.0,"I needed this set for an outfit that I have.  But I wasn’t sure if it was the right color.  Turns out, it is perfect in color and length."
5.0,Most comfortable bra ever!
5.0,Comfy and fits as described.
5.0,I go to a fitness club and the coil hold my key fob so I can slide it up my arm and not worry about storing them somewhere.
5.0,"Comfortable top, and I get a lot of compliments!"
5.0,"I want to start off with saying that I wear size 8 1/2 Wide shoes, and I normally have to purchase shoes a half-size too large for them to fit right. I did that with these, and they are a tad too big; just enough that had I ordered the right size, they'd have fit perfectly. These shoes are the rare shoes that fit true-to-size.<br /><br />With that said, they are constructed well. The sole material seems a bit soft, but is very grippy. Even though they are slightly too big for me, I wore them around to see how they feel on grass, pavement, and on rocks, and these shoes are very comfortable. The cushioning is very nice, and the outer material seems tough enough to last a few seasons of solid use.<br /><br />The pair I got are the brown color, and they look really nice. The shoelaces are thick and solid, and the laces tie up nice and tight. I've had other shoes that have thick shoelaces that are glossy or otherwise don't keep a tie very well; these are definitely good shoelaces.<br /><br />These are a solid choice for adventure shoes/boots on a budget."
5.0,my son is 3 and these were perfect.
5.0,so comfy and cute.  perfect for belly dance.
5.0,"Perfect for under dresses and skirts, nice material for summer months. Love them! I'm pear shaped at 137lbs 5'2 and the mediums are perfect."
5.0,"GREAT WALLET:)  IT WAS A FATHER'S DAY GIFT ''  HE LOVED IT ''  THANK'S :)  need more like this and "" PINK FLOYED WOULD BE NICE  IN A WALLET!!!"
5.0,5' 2&#34; 42D. Fit great
5.0,This yoga pants really comfortable and soft.
5.0,Very nice looking jewelry
5.0,Awesome quality and fabric.
5.0,"The fit and style are exactly what I wanted. High waisted (above bellybutton) with stretchy, thick waistband and flowy athletic material for the actual shorts. Great length. I sized up, but could have ordered my normal Medium. Will definitely re-order."
5.0,"Nice, adequately described and illustrated."
5.0,Very comfortable and great foot support.
5.0,"Very comfortable dress,love it"
5.0,Nice key ring. Love it!
5.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; I weigh 150lbs and I ordered a medium but if I wanted a more fitted dress I'm the top I probably could have easily ordered a small. I'm planning on ordering this dress in a smaller size to see how it fits. It's the perfect length, comfortable and looks just like the picture. I will be ordering more in different colors for summer"

5.0,I bought 3-6 months for my 8 month old because of the reviews. They fit my daughter perfectly. They are really cute and look super comfy. They have rubber on the bottom so she doesn't slip. I will definitely buy her some more when she grows out of these.<br /><br />Looks like they have some for adults too. I'm gonna have to check those out for myself.

5.0,Product arrived on time and was exactly as pictured. Fit my niece really well so the size was right as well.

5.0,Fits perfectly. My son loves them.there were a few straggler thread pieces but it didn't look like any of the seams were ripped so i think they were just stragglers. My son is obsessed with Spiderman so these are perfect.
5.0,"The headband and wrap are gorgeous for a 1920's era party!  I bought this for a themed birthday party and it was beautiful... however, I am plus size and this wrap wasn't quite long enough for me to cover my shoulders and also hang down like other wraps.  It is to be expected when a product isn't labeled plus size, so I didn't detract any positive rating for that.  I am excited to see if I will be able to wear the shawl for any other special occasions with a simple black dress.  Very satisfied!"
5.0,"When we are going on anything over 4 hours, I always wear my FRC bibs- perfect fit, comfortable, no hot spots, just right amount of support, good for all day long rides. Now getting a second pair. Me 6 ft, 168 lbs, 32 waist medium- fits perfect."
5.0,Really like this set. Bra is tru to size. Bra is shaped like a a loner cut. Very flattering on. Comfortable to wear. The panties are soft to the touch. Nice on. Also fits good as accompanies size to bra. Was given to me as gift and you can buy with confidence. Just enough push up not too much.
5.0,I love this watch! Looks expensive!

Tank top is comfy and material is soft and loose.<br /><br />Wish the price was a tad less, but i wore this shirt so many times in the summer anyway . I’d buy it in another print too."
5.0,EXCELLENT ITEM !!

5.0,The key chain is very cute and heavy duty. The material has stood up against being tossed and dropped many times.
5.0,"I live in the desert where you have to dust everything everyday or your home will look like you live outside.  Wearing a felt hat, they can get dusty quite easily.  I had been using those spongy looking ones to clean my hats in the past...as they work well.  But they don't last long and start to disintegrate, leaving your hat covered in the particles.  I decided I wanted a real brush and purchased the Bickmore because of the reviews.  I'm glad I did.  There's nothing fancy about this brush...but it does it's job well!  It's small enough to fit in your hand, making it easy to use.  I'm a satisfied customer and I would recommend this Hat Brush to my friends who wear felt hats."
5.0,Is bag is ideal for what my need is. Rugged.
5.0,Kids wear them to school everyday. Easy to use and help keep the masks from rubbing behind their ears. Not to mention keep them from losing their masks at lunch or snack time when they take them off. Great purchase!
5.0,The purse is stunning.  I had hoped to get the one with more pink stones but this one is still beautiful.  I am hoping to add more to my collection a little at a time.  They are certainly conversation starters.  Don't wait for a special occasion  to carry as I don't have that many &#34;special&#34; places to go and carry it just because.

5.0,It holds a lot of bags
5.0,Back is cute.
5.0,These socks are JUST THE RIGHT thickness Not super heavy either. I love these socks for traveling. It’s difficult to carry weeks worth of clothing and I can wear these socks for 4-5 days in a row without them smelling and getting stiff. They are thinner too so they dry faster if you wash them in sink.
5.0,the looks of the watch is great. a great value  for a casual watch. would recommend this watch to anyone
5.0,My son loves his new Bronco socks!

5.0,Pretty beaded bracelet
5.0,"Flattering fit, comfortable. Perfect in green for my dressy St Patrick’s day event with a long black skirt. It’s pretty long, even for me (5’10”), but the design allows for it to be scrunched up a little. Could be a dress on someone shorter."
5.0,"What a great quality scarf for an amazing price! These are my favorite colors so of course I snatched it right up. Shipping took a little longer than I'd like but I expected that. I wear this scarf all the time. I'm very happy with the quality and length of it. It matches everything! Overall, I'm very pleased by my purchase. Thanks again!"

5.0,Looks exactly like the picture. Case is great for carrying your phone in your purse to protect the front of the phone.
5.0,Dressy shoes for special days or Church.
5.0,"Was not expecting such a nice robe for $12!  It's well made with beautiful and bright fabric that I think is even prettier in person.  Sizing seems right for me - I bought a Small and normally wear a US size 4 or 6.  It's light but I feel comfortable lounging in it as a I get ready.  Really happy overall.  I bought this thinking that, for $12, I wouldn't be too worried if I didn't like it.  But I am actually super pleased and will most likely buy more.  These would make great bridesmaids robes some day."
5.0,"Best &#34;flip flops&#34; for the money.  I've lived in tropical places for most of the last 35 years and these are definitely the most comfortable of all the hundreds of pairs of these I've owned.  I don't slip on wet surfaces (or when my feet are wet), they have arch support, look good, and are really comfy."
5.0,I love these bands. They allow me to coordinate my fitbit alta with any outfit. Really fun.
5.0,Watching out fr the other sets
5.0,Was pleasantly surprised as the great quality!!  And looks great too.  Adjustable ear straps are comfortable.  Highly recommend.
5.0,Hermoso para mi niña
5.0,I live in an area that has dirt with a high clay content. You take a risk of ruining your shoes if you don't protect them. This one works great! It's easy to spray it on then wait for it to dry. You may want a few coats for the absolute best protection. I like that this brand is American made. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
5.0,Very nice piece. Great addition to my work necklaces. Arrived very quickly.
5.0,Great dress! Brought this and several others here because of a shattered kneecap and this was easiest to get in and out of and did not hurt my sutures when trying to move! Love the pockets as well!
5.0,"This skort is so comfortable. It is well made and I like the features. I will buy more, especially at this price!"
5.0,"I love th must have is. It has worked out great for me. I downsized from a very large purse to this one and it was an adjustment period but everything I truly needs fits inside of it, it fits my Galaxy S5 with protective case with no problem. I highly recommend this product."
5.0,"I have been wearing glasses for decades. My current pair are great, but they slipped down quite a bit. So I got these keepons and...problem solved! 20 pairs means I put them on my regular pair, my sunglasses, my extra (workout) pair...extra pairs just in case to have in my bag, at the office and then still have extra....They take some adjusting so they don't pinch but once you adjust them, I forget I have my glasses on. I have them right at the very end of my glasses, with just the tiniest bit of the eyeglass arm extending beyond the keepons (1-2 mm), and the keepons stay put, no matter what.  So you don't have to place them the way they are in the picture, an inch or so onto the eyeglass arm, which makes them highly adjustable and versatile. The second day I had them, I wore them during a 5k race and later while doing some gardening, and my glasses never slipped.  It was a totally new and very welcome experience.  With these, my glasses don't slip down at all, which is unbelievable since before I had to push them up constantly and if I was working out they were always threatening to slip right off, which was very distracting and annoying.  They are practically invisible and far more useful than those neck strap eyeglass retainers, which won't keep glasses from slipping and are very conspicuous.  Highest recommendation!"
5.0,Great shirt for great price. I used a heat press on this shirt to apply the vinyl heat transfer.  Worked out great!!
5.0,"Used this for keeping my driver's license, library card, insurance cards etc. in a small pouch in my purse.  It arrived sooner than originally stated.  Perfect for my needs."
5.0,Beautiful scarf.  Gave as a gift.
5.0,I am blown away. I LOVE this dress. Gives curves in all the right places. Super comfortable. I can’t wait to wear it. Amazing bargain. Highly recommend!!!!
5.0,Beautiful nightgown. Good quality material.

5.0,We really loved all the products we ordered.  We would order again.
5.0,"This is a great gift for anyone, especially a college student who travels between home and school quite often. The pocket is so discrete, and the design is stylish. Material is comfortable. I might have to get one for myself!"
5.0,Perfect fit. Hard to find Callaway in stores around here. Love the pullovers.
5.0,Beautiful and authentic Tiffany. I found these on this site after seeing them in a local shop. These were $140 less!! Yes it’s a fact. Exact same frame. It’s beautiful

5.0,Love them! Fits the need for what I was going to use them for.
5.0,I get compliments every where I go on these i love them
5.0,These are fun. The frame is very big and really covers the eye. These will make fine sunglasses but will need special plastic lenses because of the weight. They fit well and seem well balanced.
5.0,"Compression AKA support socks are available in the following levels of support:<br /><br />Mild (8-15 mmHg)<br />Medium (15-20 mmHg)<br />Firm (20-30 mmHg)<br />X-Firm (30-40 mmHg)<br /><br />The  particular socks I received from Vine are Firm (20-30 mmHg).<br /><br />I received the set called, “Multicoloured3.” I have attached a picture of one of the most quirky of these patterns. The designs are all quite cute.<br /><br />This is the fifth brand of compression socks I’ve recently had the opportunity to test through Vine. This is one of my favorite brands of compression socks, so far, as to both appearance and functionality.<br /><br />The product description does not say what kind of fabric is used in these socks, but if they are like most compression socks, it is some combination of nylon or polyester plus spandex. The fabric in these socks has a smooth, soft texture which is very comfortable against my skin.<br /><br />The Firm level of compression of these socks works very well for providing excellent support to my feet and calves. I had previously, for many years, used calf braces and high quality, well padded athletic socks to prevent shin splints, charley horse, and foot pain from standing and walking 10 to 12 hours per day. I was getting decent results with the expensive athletic socks and the calf braces, but I was thrilled to discover that compression socks are one-stop shopping to achieve all of that just as well, and in some ways even better. Compression socks impart a subtle, pleasant, tingling sensation as if I'm receiving a gentle massage of my feet and legs.<br /><br />I always hand wash my compression socks, and I was impressed to note that the manufacturer of these particular socks is the first one that I’ve encountered to wisely recommend that level of care to its customers. Hand-washing insures that compression socks will last for years. I fill my bathroom sink with warm water, squeeze in a few dollops of mild soap, swish the socks around in it, rinse them well, gently squeeze out excess water, and hang them up to dry. Given that these socks are multicolored, I place an old towel beneath them to catch the several, inevitable drips of dye so that they won't stain my tub. It takes these socks about 24 hours to fully dry.<br /><br />For people with painful, arthritic hands, Firm (20-30 mmHg) or X-Firm (30-40 mmHg) compression socks might not be the best choice, since it may hurt your hands trying to put them on. The higher the compression number, the more difficult on the hands it is pulling on the socks. Instead, I would highly recommend:<br /><br />GOGO by Therafirm Mild Support Travel Socks, 15-20 mmHg, mild-compression socks.<br /><br />The fabric in the GOGO socks, which is polyester plus spandex, is very soft and, unlike this brand of compression socks, it is stretchy enough to make it much easier to put on the GOGO socks than any other brand of compression socks I have tried. But even so, the GOGO socks are not so stretchy that it compromises the support they offer."
5.0,Touch screen works well and great warmth!
5.0,"So cozy, warm, soft, I just bought another pair!!!"
5.0,Fits great.  Love them.
5.0,"These are a little bit smaller than I imagined, but the measurements given are completely accurate. On the ears the size seems just right, but I would buy a longer set, too, if it were available. All that said, they're great exactly as is. The clips are adjustable so they can hold all night without hurting, if you adjust it just right. They are slightly delicate as another reviewer mentioned, but we're talking about crystals on a wire drop here, so that's as expected. If you step on them you'll probably bend them a bit, and you'll have to bend them back. OK, so I had that happen once and they're fine again. I've attached a picture to show the exact size."
5.0,First pair of leg warmers and I absolutely love them! Great quality and so cute with any boot!
5.0,Excellent quality. Fast delivery
5.0,"I received this dress 2 days ago and wore it out for the first time today - and - I have already received compliments from strangers!!  I love, love this dress!!!  It's light weight and great for the 98 degree days we're experiencing.  I spritzed the dress when it arrived and all the wrinkles came out from shipping.  The only negative is that the bodice is a little snug.  I know I'll be wearing this dress a lot this summer!!!  Great-great buy!!  Oh yes, did I mention how cute this dress looks on?  You can tell I really like this dress!!!"
5.0,I was pleasantly pleased with the quality of these adornments

5.0,I am so happy Victor is now able to have his own set of glasses. I will think of him every time I put my fabulous glasses on. Keep up the good work!!
5.0,This wristlets is just the right size and it looks very professional.  I would definitely recommend it! No need for a purse anymore.
5.0,Sooo pretty.  They came with extra earring backs and a cleaning cloth. Nice added extras.  The earring look expensive.
5.0,Very nice. Good craftsmanship.
5.0,"This is a cute sleeveless dress. My model is 5'9 and about 137 pounds (see photo)Solid color consist of: 95%Cotton/5%Spandex. Flora part consist of :95% Polyester/5%Spandex. The fabric is very soft and stretchy and very breathable for those hot nights. The dress is very soft like butter. The dress consist of (see photo) sleeveless arms, v-neck front with a criss-cross weave design, the dress flares out at the waist with small gathering, and is below the knee length casual or classy depending on what you pair it with. This dress is cute and comfy. Pair it with a blue Jean Jacket for casual or a sweater for a more dressy look.."
5.0,"It matches my shoes perfectly! It’s fits very well, just cute"
5.0,"Bought for my daughter, she seems happy with it."
5.0,"Adorable dress. Fits a little more snug than I’d like, but she received a ton of compliments!"
5.0,Beautiful & fits perfectly!
5.0,"Love them, a great relief for my arthritis, these are so much better than the springs in the gym!"
5.0,"Too small- the chain part is obviously adjustable, but the actual bracelet part is solid and doesn’t adjust for someone with a plus size wrist."
5.0,My wife loves this. We live in Miami and she uses it in the winter with her suits.
5.0,I got this as a little surprise gift for my fiancé. The quality was unbelievable the keychain and charm has nice weight to it and the craftsmanship  was great!
5.0,"I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my wife, she loves them. They look better than the picture. Thank you, very satisfied."
5.0,"Loved the glasses...great for new teens. Thanks, Kathy"
5.0,Another good purchase from this company. I love moonstones.  These are nice.
5.0,These are the best baby shoes ever! They stay on and are so comfortable baby does not even try to take off. Still using them as indoor slippers for toddler!
5.0,"I ordered these in a size L because I wasn't sure how these would fit. I'm 5'1&#34;, 145 lbs, and usually wear a US Women's 8. The problem I usually face when trying on pants, especially shorts, is that they either fit my hips and thighs fine but give me serious muffin top, or the waist fits fine but are saggy around the butt area. This is not the case with these shorts. These bad boys fit perfectly. Not too tight on the waist, but still flattering around the hips and butt. Would definitely buy again!"
5.0,Love this shirt (dress for someone younger). Looks great with jeans!
5.0,This band is good! I recommend it. It has a good magnet and stays in place.
5.0,"I’m 5’6, 28 waist and 34 hips. After looking at their size chart I determined a size medium would give me a slightly baggy fit. While they’re still very comfy and I’ve enjoyed lounging around in them, they are a bit more snug through the legs and hips than I thought they would be, but I do have thick thighs and a big butt. The material is light and thin but not see through. I like how they look and feel and I imagine I’ll be wearing these a lot. The bottom ankle cuffs are stretchy and not tight, which is great because I have bigger calves and I can still push them up to wear as cropped pants like in the model photo. I’d recommend these, just make sure to look at their size chart to get the fit you want!"
5.0,Good item. Both boys and girls love these
5.0,These sunglasses are ideal. I am very happy with them.
5.0,gift for my friends daughter she loved it

5.0,They didn’t irritate my skin and my skin is extremely sensitive. I thought the jewel part would be kind of big but it’s small and cute. easy to take out/put in and you don’t even feel that they’re there! 10/10
5.0,Buy these! You won't be sorry! :) I purchased these after my eyeballs were hurting soooo bad from staring at my computer for so long (for work). These glasses are amazing! They help and they look super cute! :)
5.0,The girls loved them. Very impressed with the key rings!!
5.0,Very soft and comfortable. Love them!

5.0,These are really nice slippers.  I spilled coffee on them and they easily wiped off without any stains.
5.0,I followed fit recommendations from other reviews and have been very happy with this purchase. The material stands up to a workout and I haven’t had any problems.
5.0,This was a present for my daughter for doing well in school. She was so happy with it. I gave it to her at her end of the year party and all of her friends were trying it on and passing it around. I know a few of them ordered one when they got home! It was such a great price and it was in excellent shape. A good gift idea!
5.0,"Indeed a healthy massage reflexology sandals. I wear it everyday, and during the first few days my feet were not used to it, a bit of pain feeling, so I wear a socks underneath. But few days later I am able to wear it bare feet. It had improved my blood circulation and strengthen my feet. I really love this!<br /><br />And after wearing it for a longer period of time, it treated my ball of foot pain. So I am returning to write another review here to update my satisfactory feeling. I hope to give it a 10 stars."
5.0,Perfect for after shoulder replacement surgery.<br />Lots of nurses asked where it was purchased and recommended for everyone who has to have surgery
5.0,I loveee these. Now I have to get every color.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter she absolutely loved opening the oyster she had so much fun opening it. The pearl was 9.4 MM. The color was absolutely gorgeous. It was a little darker than I was expecting but it was still stunning. I definitely recommend this. I think it’s a great gift for anybody who loves pearls and jewelry. The cage is great and I love how you can open it and change it out with with other different pearls.
5.0,Shirt was perfect and just what my daughter wanted. Except the delivery company ruined the packaging and that resulted in the shirt coming to is with some issues. The seller was amazing!!! Great and quick response. We were given a fair deal due to the issue. Thank you so much for working with us.
5.0,Bought my usual size but it didn’t fit. Returned it and bought a size up. It’s super comfy. Fully lined. Looks great. I received lots of compliments.
5.0,Love them! Nice light sheen on the outside too..
5.0,"Beautiful dress!  Fits perfect, she got so many compliments on it.  It is not a light, flimsy material...heavier than expected.  We love the dress!"
5.0,I use these for mask making and they are smaller than the previous ones I bought which is nice but harder to handle because they slip out of your hands.  But all in all a pretty good product.
5.0,Sturdy and precision made.
5.0,"My little guy is crawling everywhere and I wanted his toes protected outside, these are a little big, but they fit well enough to stay on and he's only 6 months so they may still fit next spring too."
5.0,Unique styling. Fun.
5.0,Counting down to Halloween to wear this fabulous costume. I’m 6’ 160 lbs. This is a large. It is long enough I can wear heels and still have my feet covered. I easily could have gone with a medium but love it anyway. I switched out the hat for a different version. Will definitely be bringing this out year after year.
5.0,Husband doesn’t often wear a hat but this one he sports regularly.
5.0,Bought this dress for my trip to Mexico and it was absolutely perfect in the heat. It is incredibly light weight and breezy. It is long enough to give me the coverage I needed to feel comfortable and short enough to keep me cool. Not to mention the fabulous print! I recommend this!
5.0,I loved it! Perfect sizing and liked that you have the option to take off the fur. Great price too!
5.0,Our 10 year old Godson loved it!! My grown kids were jealous! Very cool
5.0,I absolutely love these masks for my young daughter and the adult ones. Of the 10+ masks I've tried these keep you the most cool and are extremely comfortable.
5.0,Rip Pop!
5.0,They were a little smaller than I expected but are still really cool!<br />The hardest part you could say is putting them on but I kinda expected that.<br />Also the little needle thing is made of wood too and I’m worried it might break since it’s so small. So I keep them in the given packaging and only wear them when I want to. Hopefully that prevents it. 👌
5.0,Love it so much. I've gotten so many compliments. Love that I can bend it closed!
5.0,I bought this necklace for myself.  As a sloth lover I  couldn't resist.  It is bright and shiny and cute as can be! I would definitely purchase again.

5.0,"Compre estas bolsas para el supermercado y asi no tener que pagar o usar bolsas plasticas. Cumplen muy bien con su trabajo y estan super bien de tama~o. Eso si, me dio un poco de trabajo al principio para doblarlas, pero luego de varias usadas aprendi como. El material me gusta mucho porque es muy resistente y las puedo poner en la lavadora."
5.0,confortables
5.0,I get many complemments.
5.0,absolutely gorgeous!  Looks more like a diamond than Cubic zirconia and I love that it is white gold.  doesn't bother my sensitive ears at all.
5.0,"Really good material. Nice for lounging, yet nice for casual wear as well🖤"
5.0,"These were purchased as a gift for my husband, and he is very pleased with them. They are very comfortable for driving."

5.0,"Loved the prints and designs, the matierisl is also really great too"
5.0,These bags are large and sturdy with nice integrated handles that will stand up to heavy loads. You can adjust the bag bottom from a pouch style into a rectangular bottom which will better accommodate cereal and cracker boxes. That is ingenious!  Each bag has a small pouch on the top which could hold your coupons or shopping list. The designs printed on the fabric are so cute and such a great variety!  They will make your shopping fun!
5.0,"This bracelet is charming, goes well with my other turquoise jewlery. It fits perfect, have difficult time in finding bracelets that fit."
5.0,A great quality enamel pin and I love the design. Nice 4 date nites!
5.0,"This dress is cuter then it looks , I’m 5’1” weigh 126 pounds and I bought a medium , fit perfectly , the dress is comfortable not too tight not too loose , just perfect . I paired it with black nylons & some ankle boots for a party that took place in winter . I think it’s a great buy for a great price"
5.0,"great quality, washes very well"
5.0,Fits great!  Comfy and covers you up well!  I ordered a medium which is the size I normally take  I am a C cup and offers enough support without a bra!
5.0,They do what I wanted.
5.0,I got these to share with my 6yo daughter. Since she has little ears most of the earrings she has have too long studs for little kids ears and they poke her neck when she lays down. I thought i could use some of these for her and it was a hit! they are very pretty too!
5.0,"From the reviews i was expecting these to be good, but wow! I love these! I am five two and about 135 pounds and the medium, my normal size,  fits well! If you are looking for a fit that is just a little looser than leggings, i would say get your normal size, but if you want a ""sweatpant"" loose fit, i would say maybe size up. Overall such. A. Good. Product! These are also a very good fabric!"
5.0,I love my SnapSeal Contigo 20oz mugs. They have been a game changer for my morning commutes.
5.0,My sister is a nurse and she loved this bag.
5.0,"I accidentally burned a hole in it steaming out the crease marks..luckily may neighbor helped me make &#34;darts&#34; in the back to cover the hole.  I ordered another new one, it came so quickly...I love it!"
5.0,"Love them!  Fit my almost 3yr. Old wonderful.  Kinda rubbery, so they don't fall off his head."
5.0,These seem to run big compared to what I've read.  They are very comfortable and do a great job of repelling snow.  The ends do get wet after walking in the snow so I would say they are not really 100% waterproof.  They are plenty warm if you are being active.
5.0,"Love the look! They are a little lose at the top of th calf and the calf streaches. They should be good for most body types. Comfortable to walk in and wear all day. The platform and chunky heel are great.  Even if you don't often wear high heels they are easy to walk in. They can be worn in small amounts of snow or wet muddy weather. The are tall enough to not get wet, and easy to wipe off. Durable material, so for I have worn them to work on my feet all day without a problem."
5.0,I get a lot of compliments on these! I developed an allergy a lot of my earring posts. I wear these all the time because they don't make me ears itch.
5.0,Just as promised and so cute!
5.0,"VERY CUTE BRACELET it looks so expensive, I was scared of getting but I risked it and bought it anyway and I love it , I wear almost everyday and it’ll fit anyone’s wrist  !!! 10/10 RECOMMENDED I HAVE NO REGRETS AT ALL"

5.0,Adorable !! Wonderful material
5.0,This a very nice mask!<br />I did not know what to expect when the item arrived but I was not disappointed.<br />When I was at work I showed  a pic of me wearing it to a co-worker they smiled and stated it was bad @$$. They asked the name of the mask and placed it in their cart.<br />The quality of the mask was pretty good and the mask has some weight to it.<br />Even though Halloween is over I still wear it.<br />The mask came quick and it was packaged well.<br />I will use this sell for future transactions.
5.0,I like that they're comfortable
5.0,Good Product thx

5.0,This dress is perfect. I love it and I receive a lot of compliments! Ordered the Medium
5.0,Got this for the homie on Xmas. He was stoked on how bodacious they were! I can’t give a proper rating on the comfort or stretch as I didn’t want to give my boy worn socks.
5.0,"I wear a size 12 sometimes size 13 . I will often buy the larger size 13  and add some better quality insoles. These are the best I've found so far. They are big and would might not work in a tight fitting pair of shoes.  With my size 13  Reebok Mobius leather basketball shoes, I pulled out the factory insoles put these ""Snapsmile"" brand insoles in and placed the original insoles on top of them. They're now my most comfortable of shoes."
5.0,"Absolutely Love this item, Quality is amazing, and shines and buffs like no other item i've had. To be honest it looks just like the piece of cloth laying in every Jewelers counter when you walk in. Very pleased with my purchase, and I know my sterling silver jewelery pieces thank me as well!"
5.0,Super cute wish I would have got one in my size. Daughter says it is very warm and snug
5.0,perfect for my Minnie mouse costume
5.0,"I love boho style.  I had low expectations due to some reviews and the shipping process was a little discouraging.  Overall though, i like this dress its simple and classy. I wear a nude slip underneath and it works beautifully."
5.0,"These are great! Can wear with boots to work because they are thick enough. Almost ankle length, not really mid calf in case that's what you're looking for."
5.0,"Love the jeans but have to return, too big for me I'll have to have a size 4. Jeans well made soft,smooth feel !"
5.0,Was exactly what I ordered for my wife. Fit her pandora bracelet perfect and of course she loved it.

5.0,"I’m obsessed with this little black dress! I love how it comes with a belt to cinch the wait, the vneck is appropriate and not revealing and the best part it’s longer in the back! This dress is definitely perfect for all body type! Highly recommend!!!!!!<br />Also I’m wearing a small and it’s a bit oversized on me but the belt helped cinched the wait and was able to shorten the dress from the front to MY liking!"

5.0,Very comfortable and attractive!
5.0,Son loves it.  Very nice quality lanyard.
5.0,I bought this as a Secret Santa for a coworker that owns and loves Horses.<br />I have yet to gift it as it is not yet Christmas but I'm in love with the keychain; if Horses meant anything to me I would get one for myself!<br />The design is absolutely beautiful and the quality of the metal looks good (It hasn't seen much wear in a wrapped box.)<br />The pendant is attached to a keyring and clip (not shown on the picture.)<br />I am very happy with this purchase and cannot wait to see my coworkers face when she sees it!  : )
5.0,Great pin set!

5.0,This was purchased as a stocking stuffer.  Hopefully he will get a kick out of it. It is sturdy and looks good.
5.0,Very nice very heavy. And my stepkids will love them for sure
5.0,i normally don't buy products that have 0 written reviews took my chances on this because of how much my daughter loves how to train your dragon and let me tell you she will be so excited about this cute charm bracelete. I cant speak on how well it holds up since i just recieved it today but it looks like itll be fine im very happy with it at the moment.<br />** i didn't realize it didnt come with girl dragon lucky for me my daughter loves all of the dragons but if thats your kiddos fav just know its not on the bracelete .
5.0,"THIS BAG IS AMAZING!!!! I get so many compliments, it is better than expected, Great Quality, has plenty of room &#60; I carry it daily to work and running errands, and now don't neet a seperate bag for other items, it fits my day planner, a snack, my water bottle, full size wallet, make up bag, another small bag , lotion, perfume and anything else I can think off. I would definietyly recommend and wish I would have bought two, but will definitely be getting another one like this for the spring/summer. Great buy, you won't be dissappointed. LJ"
5.0,I have an Iphone 6 plus with an otterbox case and it fits in their fine. The look is classy and simple. It doesn't look cheap at all. Good buy. I can wait to have it for a while not to mention the RFID capacity.

5.0,My daughter loves this tank. Really cute and good material
5.0,Adorable socks for the nurse in your life. They really seem to help with long shifts.
5.0,"I LOVE this dress!!! I've had many compliments on it. Very comfy, good for summer time.  Fits perfectly!<br /><br />I'm 5'3 and the length is perfect on me."
5.0,So glad I found these. I plan on purchasing more in different colors.
5.0,Love the colors and the size.
5.0,After reading all the previous reviews about the sizing I decided to order the 2XL even though I wear a size 8 or 10 top. It was the best decision ever. If I wore a size 6 top it still would have fit quite well as I did have to open the back ribbons some to adjust it properly.  So you best be a size 6 or smaller to order an XL and a 6+ to a 10 top for a 2XL. For 20 bucks it's a really nice item. The quality is good and the shipping was a day earlier than quoted. Recommend!
5.0,"Love them! I’m replacing all my plastic reusable bags with these. These have nice strong seams, and hold a lot. They are stylish, eco friendly, and easy to store. I will be buying more. I also have started giving gifts in these, and everyone has loved them!"
5.0,Love these Christmas earrings! Nicely put together with quality in mind. Not very heavy on ear lobes too.

5.0,"fits the way my daughter wants. Although not a true large, it's a US medium."
5.0,"I ordered the Giftale Woman's Tassel Keychain/Purse Charm - Genuine Leather.  This tassel perfectly compliments my new leather purse.  It looks classy, stylish and high-end. The gold-tone hardware is elegant and substantial.  The tassel is genuine leather and hangs beautifully.  I ordered the ""coffee"" color and it's spot-on.  Tassel length is 5"", the hardware length is 4 3/4"". The overall length is ideal since my purse is large. I love it!  (sorry I couldn't show a photo)  By the way, if the tassel arrives a little wrinkled, just spray it lightly with water - gently comb it straight - hang to dry. That's it!"
5.0,"Im 5'3"" ,246lbs. Thought to get a 2x but reviews said it runs small. They were correct glad I got a 3x. Fit like a glove.  Material is not cotton but it was still a cute outfit for the night."

5.0,"I love this blouse!  I'm 5'11&#34; curvy & wear a size 18. I checked the measurements before I ordered so I had no problems with the fit. It's not boxy at all. The length is to my hips and the sheer material floats around your body.  This blouse is perfect for summer.  I wear a cami underneath and pair it with capris.  I ordered the apricot /green  color but  I'd say the colors are (teal,smoke&,ivory) my shirt had the pattern in the center of the front & back not as shown but I didn't care because I loved the design and colors."
5.0,"Very good quality and cool design, I like it!"

5.0,Love these. So easy with the zipper on the side and so warm

5.0,"Very Satisfied with my choice. And the color is great, love the security features of zipper clips. The length of the strap gives many options of wear, especially as cross body bag."
5.0,Great dress for a night out
5.0,Muy bonita y el material es muy bueno excelente producto por el precio
5.0,Beautiful piece of jewelry and just the perfect size!! Perfect Mother's Day gift!
5.0,Very nice quality! Soft material!
5.0,I like the size that fits in my front pocket smoothly.  It helps unwanted door locks or security alarm from being being inadvertently pressed. Wish there was an option for no clasp since I never use it and it's

5.0,Nice feel & comfortable
5.0,Bought as a gift for my daughter
5.0,The product was small in my hands which are very big. It is my hope they will stretch.
5.0,"Update: I've adjusted my review, after being contacted by the company. After discussion, the rep determined that I needed a different style and sent them, free of charge. The new style is perfect.<br /><br />Initially, I was thrilled. I immediately put them on and then slipped into my shoes and was ecstatic; they were truly no-show.Then I wore them all day. They aren't terrible, but they twist. The heel stays in place, thanks to the grips, but they twist down the length of the foot. I found myself adjusting both socks throughout the day. On the positive side, they did keep my feet from sweating, versus going sockless."
5.0,These men’s lapel pins are a gorgeous accent to all my husband’s suits! Great quality for an awsome price!
5.0,These do run a little small so size up! I’m 5’7 (approx. 175lbs/40D) I’m usually a size Large but I got a XL after reading reviews. I was looking for fitted tank tops & these are it! The colors are vibrant & these tank tops hug you in all the right places!!! Highly recommend!
5.0,Decent quality just for playtime anyways
5.0,"I've got kids. During the summer, sunglasses are pretty much disposable with them. This pack is great because you get a LOT of them, and they are pretty cheap. So when they inevitably break or get lost, no worries- we have more! This pack would probably also make a great goodie bag prize for a birthday part or something similar.<br />So far, my kids are very much enjoying these. I put one on for a bit, and they aren't really my style as an adult, but I'm pretty sure they aren't meant to be. I think they are perfect for what they are."
5.0,Love love the bag I got so many compliments quality bag I recommended for everyone
5.0,These are awesome hoops!  They are the exact large size i wanted after purchasing so many in the past that fell short of the hoop size!  great price for both!

Such a big fun beautiful scarf and she was thrilled!<br /><br />This is the second Freedi linen scarf I've purchased, this on for myself, and I love it.  It makes the roundness of my body have the distraction of the vertical line and it isn't skimpy, it really flows."
5.0,Love the anklet!! So pretty. Looks danty  but is surprisingly strong. I haven't taken it off since I bought it. Great buy!!
5.0,"When I leave my reviews I rate them from 1-5 stars but every ones stars mean something different,so here is what my rating mean<br /><br />(1) Star = eww not for me I either want a refund or sending it back where it came from<br />(2) Stars=I'm really not impressed with it but I will keep it and take a loss<br />(3) Stars=eh Im on the fence and can't decide if its neither good or bad maybe it deserves a chance<br />(4)Stars=Yeah its pretty good maybe 1 thing is wrong with it but nothing I can't live with<br />(5) Stars=Winner Winner nothing bad to say everything including packaging is on point<br />This is really nicely made and i am so happy with the price it is for the quality!<br /><br />I leave reviews for items that I receive on discount , like this one my discount on items i get vary sometimes just a couple dollars off and all the way up to a free item.I get that discount in a promise that I will leave a honest review<br />My discount in no way effects my review of the product, I always keep the full price of any item in mind and think to myself would I be thinking this way if I payed the full price<br /><br />Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy your purchases"
5.0,"Very cute little ankle pant. Has a nice classic/vintage look. I got the light grey pair as a test and liked them so much I am ordering the rest of the colors. They are honestly the only office appropriate slacks I've found that fit nicely, not overly tight nor androgynous looking. Wish they came in khaki, brown, and white as well."
5.0,I love the picture on the front and the nice amount of room in the case

5.0,Love my leg warmer! I ordered two pairs and one came in before expected and their so cute! My first pair of leg warmers so I was excited! ❤️
5.0,"I bought these to wear over my knees and thighs to cover the area not covered by my boots.  They fit great, are super soft and are very stretchy so that I can work them up or down my leg with disturbing my pants.  I wear them up my leg to work, push the down around my boots at work, then pull them back up for the trip home. They are very warm and soft."
5.0,I love these shoes and they’re surprisingly comfortable.
5.0,Perfect socks for when I travel on an airplane
5.0,I love these dresses..i purchase :five: of them all difference..colors..same style...I love chiffon.....my love the soft fabric..it the cape flowes when the wind blowes from the body...very eligant..best of all the .rhinedstones on side of dress really sparkle..if you want to look elegant  without spending lots of money...this the way to go...….my niece was so impress the way I look..she purchase the same dress in blue..now she is getting complements…....
5.0,love these very comfortable.
5.0,"Finally EXACTLY what I was looking for!!!<br />I had already bought my 2 year old 4 other life jackets this year and every one either rubbed on her diaper area, neck, or chin and caused chaffing and rashes OR they wouldn't keep her head high enough the water bc she is very independent and not wanting held.<br />I knew this suit alone would not do the trick BUT add some 97 cent arm floaties to it and it checks all the boxes!<br />She doesn't wobble and no chaffing and her head stays up the highest of any life jacket weve had....<br />My only warning is that alone it WOUlD NOT keep her 2 year old body (who doesn't know how to swim) safe enough in the water alone....i only recommend for this age IF using WITH arm floaties.<br />But I do think it will be a great transition suit when she does start to learn to swim,on her own when she is alittle older"
5.0,"I bought these to wear under my pajamas and they are nice and thick and comfortable material, feels like good quality and what a bargain! I am 5'7 140 lbs with a small cup size and the Large fits perfectly! they are longer than most tanks which I prefer. I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend."
5.0,"I thought I was taking a big chance buying shoes online, as I have wide feet.  But I ordered them anyway because the price was right.<br /><br />The shoes fit me perfectly! I think the fabric gives them some stretching ability. They would probably fit any width just fine.  The cushioning in the sole makes them quite comfortable to wear on the town, or the dance floor.<br /><br />The color is sort of a pinky-red, but because of the texture they match most light to dark blue-reds.  Probably wouldn't match an orangy-red."
5.0,So comfortable and allows free range motion without tug and restriction as normal tanks and tshirts.  No longer do i have to be one of those obnoxious leople in the gym that cut sleeves off till nipples are exposed for comfort ... yes you all need to shave your chest or not be fat... im buying more of these best shirt for the gym ... please dont buy if your fat you look stupid
5.0,I think this outfit is super cute. I wear the top as a cute unique jacket with my jeans sometimes.
5.0,Just as described!  🤗
5.0,Exactly what I wanted when I was required to wear a mask in retail at Christmas. Soft and breathable.
5.0,Very cute they don't easy pop off.
5.0,I love it because its light and fits perfect on me
5.0,My husband loved this sweater!  It’s the perfect ugly Christmas sweater for fans of the movie.  It fits true to size.
5.0,Just a tiny bit smaller than what she thought but it works
5.0,Cheaper than getting prescriptions sunglasses.  Great price and fits well.
5.0,"I love the color, as well as the unique fastener. Great bracelet."
5.0,"These are AWESOME!!  Love that they adjust and are so comfortable.  I've tried a LOT of headbands, these I recommend.  And I've had lots of people see me wearing them and have ordered them too."
5.0,"As we women know our bodies are hard to measure. Getting the XL I expected a little room and especially after losing about 15lbs since ordering it originally. So I little smaller then expected. That being said, I am Absolutely In LOVE with the Navy Blue!! So many complements! And the fabric is astounding! Very strong and durable!!!"
5.0,The shipping was fast and the glasses overall were great!
5.0,"I ordered my usual size (medium) which fit perfectly, but I should have ordered a large because I like my tops to be a bit baggy.  Overall great purchase for me."
5.0,Love this shirt bought all 3 colors
5.0,These earrings are very pretty and I always get compliments on them. I would highly recommend them for yourself or as a gift.
5.0,Best fitting compression sock I've ever purchased.  Purchased for increased blood circulation.
5.0,Cheap glasses did their job.
5.0,Duane
5.0,"Exactly what it looks like advertised, and just hella cute!"
5.0,Love!♥️
5.0,The fit is great. Very comfortable.
5.0,I used the skirt for Halloween and it worked great. I’m using it for a pirate outfit and a steampunk look. I’m 5’4 and weight 150. I bought the large. I could have gone with a medium so it would be a bit shorter. I have the large tied all the way in front. Overall it was a great purchase.
5.0,"I have been exceptionally fortunate with all Karen Scott shoes, I have bought them in the past at a local store on sale and have always been happy with the fit, that's why I was so excited when I found these."
5.0,This bag is everything! It’s not huge… but has so many compartments. I love it.
5.0,They fit perfectly and arrived quickly
5.0,"These yoga pants are the only ones I buy now. They are amazing! I legitly have probably 8 pair, between pants and capris. They don't ride down as I work out, which is huge for me. The fabric is awesome, not at all see through."
5.0,"Very cute, nice fit, chiffon, but not to see though. Love it!"
5.0,Use this to carry my phone. Works great!
5.0,This shirt is soft and it fits perfectly…love it so much
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised by the apparent high quality and great looks of this band. Like it better than other way more expensive bands I have. Fits the swatch (gent) perfectly. Way better than the plastic band that came with the swatch. Highly recommended!
5.0,This is the 2nd RFID wallet that I've bought from ID Stronghold.  High quality product at a very reasonable price!  The added security of the RFID in this day and age is worthwhile!  Highly recommend the product and vendor...they stand by their product line.
5.0,This rosary is so pretty. Nicely made. I bought another for a friend. Thank you.
5.0,Just a little small. Get a size or 2 above your regular shoe size.
5.0,Used this on my son's shoes and he loves it. No complains and fits well. He doesn't have to tie his shoes all day and just slips them on in the morning. Perfect fit!! Great product!!!!
5.0,"Sooooo soft!! Loved the material! Not cheap and wrinkly, but smooth and soft."
5.0,Cozy and not to hot for yoga
5.0,these are so comfortable!! They have a soft snug wide band at the waist that doesn't cut into me while I sit at my desk all day! The length is kinda high water on me because I've got short legs but they look really cute with flats or sandals.  I want ten more pairs of these pants!
5.0,Yessssss my boo love ❤️ these pants right on time for cold weather would definitely buy again.
5.0,Comfortable and lighter weight than most similar bike shorts.
5.0,Bought these for my husband and he loves them! Says they fit great (he usually wears the size I ordered).
5.0,"Very adorable ring, already have it on my wish list again in the other colors for gifts in the future."
5.0,"Fit as described, and delivered as stated."
5.0,This jacket lasted me a while before it ripped. Very fashionable and can fend you against very light sprinkles. IT WILL NOT STOP LIGHT RAIN. It is more of a wind breaker. It fit too tight on the waist for a large. When you zip it up it rises and pulls your t-shirt up.
5.0,"Good quality, Star Wars label , great picture. this is closer to size 12. For Lage size(10/12) 17inch shoulders, 6 inch neck , 18 inch waist ,25 inch length .  Just be carful wash and dry ,prints always hv to be washed ,cold inside out and never high heat dry . Colors are lovely . Love Darth Vader . Was too big for my nephew so am g to wear it lol ."
5.0,These I wear all day all night.  Light weight look great.  Will buy another
5.0,"there was just no way on planet Earth I was paying $349.99 for a pair of sunglasses to wear every now and then. I imagine that's why there's not any reviews for this product, lmao. I went with the ""LotFancy Polarized Sunglasses Aviator Sunglasses for Men, Rectangular Metal Frame, Ultra Lightweight,100% UV protection"" knock-off looking ones that only cost $14.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XQSTXB8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Anyway, I LOVE Burn Notice and have always wanted a pair of Michael Westen's glasses but we have to make sacrifices in life. These look damn near close enough for under $15. The lens width is 7"" inches smaller but what're ya gonna do? The only difference I see so far (besides the price) is that the ""real"" ones are non-polarized while the knock-off's are polarized. I'll deal with it."
5.0,"Gives me height and comfort. I get so many compliments, I can wear them all day when I’m touring the city and my feet feel like I’m in sneakers"
5.0,"I’ve been on the hunt for an affordable and durable gym bag for several months. My previous gym bag was a cloth grocery tote that didn’t really work for many reasons.<br /><br />I take public transportation and this new gym bag works perfectly. The shoe compartment is very roomy and even has room for me to stow my protein shaker cup and belt as well. There are a TON of pockets and separate compartments - I honestly don’t carry enough stuff to fill more than a few of them, but I can imagine they would be perfect for someone without a gym locker who needs to carry toiletries around. I’d say this bag is just as durable as another other brand name bag and worth every penny."
5.0,I have 5 pairs of these Spanx and love each one. They aren’t completely consistent in their sizing but it’s barely noticeable.  For this  size 20W frame they are a perfect wardrobe staple!
5.0,These compression socks are well made. I find no holes or compromised areas in the fabric. The fabric is not thick. The compression is strong and remains after many washes and wears.
5.0,Does the job. Although the little toy piece is a bit heavy when kids run. That's the only complaint
5.0,So soft and warm!!
5.0,These are really sharp looking.  I like the blue color. They seem well made and durable.  They come with a nice case and cleaning cloth.  These are great shades!
5.0,"Love this hat, I have it in black & brown now....I'd really like to get it in other colors as well."
5.0,I am impressed with the grip it has on my reading glasses.  I first tried them out on the widest part of the arm for a few days then moved then to the thinnest part pulled tight and they held on.  Like a fly trapped on his web.  My old ones kept coming loose and slipped right out of the arm on my reading glasses.  Wish the string was a couple of inches longer thou.
5.0,Gifted it to my sister and she really loved it!! Packaging was not great though.. better case would have been great!
5.0,Loved this so much I bought two other colors. It's so comfortable! You can throw on cute sandals and a necklace and wear it for a nice night out or wear it casual as a pool cover up. It's fantastic. I am 5'10 size 14/16 and got an xl it's great and I get lots of compliments.
5.0,"Love love love.  Very art deco.  Received quickly, lovely packaging.  Would definitely purchase from this seller again."
5.0,Worked great for daughter for her 9th birthday party 🥳
5.0,"These are made of very soft cotton, my daughter loves them, I have already bought several sets of these.’really cute and great quality material"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:445c4f7b3f5bd4b25cf8bff5a131fd68]] I'm a medium. I took a medium BUTTTT I need a large
5.0,"So worth the price! Quality material and very cute. It's just a little too big, but with minor alterations done at home, its perfect"
5.0,I had so many compliments when I wore them
5.0,Wasn’t able to get the right fit for me but the seller was quick and helpful to offer a refund.
5.0,"beautiful bought it for my daughter, she love it"
5.0,"I am 5’9” bust 36”, waist 29, 160 lbs and I would normally order a medium. But, I got a large just in case. Straight out of the package, the top fit a little tight. Two hours later it already loosened up a bit :) I’m happy with the large (see photos.) The white looks fine with a white sports bra underneath. They cover my belly button slightly, again long torso, and goes to about the top of my high waisted leggings.  The material is thin, but doesn’t feel cheap. No tag on the back of my neck!! So far, I’m very happy about this purchase!"
5.0,Just like the picture! Love the pockets. Fits true to size.
5.0,This is great for either dressing up or for a more casual look with leggings. It is also super soft!  The only thing that would have made the dress better is if it had pockets.
5.0,Love the ring. Fits perfectly and so beautiful with the matching bracelet.
5.0,So beautifully made. Very Happy with my purchase.
5.0,My god mother loved this.  These bracelets are great.
5.0,Definitely size up. I typically wear a medium but I bought the 3X after reading the reviews. I wanted it a bit loose and not form fitting as I plan to wear it at the gym. The material is soft like a regular cotton t-shirt. I could’ve went with an xl or 2xl but I also wasn’t sure if it would shrink. I got some spider leggings from a local store and I think that goes well together. I would definitely recommend this if you’re looking for something comfortable and effortless. You can accessorize to dress it up or even add a mask.
5.0,These earrings were so much better then I thought they would be.  Very pretty and the price was great for what you get!  Pictures don’t do them justice.  Many compliments!!  Not flimsy.  Shipping was much quicker then stated.  Thanks for offering these beauties!!
5.0,"Ordered the Sunshine Locket Necklace for my granddaughter for Valentine Day. Her Grammie and I are always telling her she is the ""Sunshine of Our Lives"" and this locket provided her a reminder of that message. The quality is exactly what you would expect for the price point and the message delivered was priceless."
5.0,Well made and definitely keep you warm.
5.0,Great hat. I'm a big fan. Not super deep but I love it.
5.0,Gloves came exactly as expected and were perfect Christmas gift!
5.0,Very nice item very well made and the 935 silver shines really nice.  Bought for teens who loved it but I would buy these for adults too very reasonable and very well made.
5.0,My little girl loved it! It was light weight.
5.0,"Well worth the money, the scarves  actually matches the pictured view on line.<br />Bought for a small group- they love them !"
5.0,"Love it! Beautiful mustard yellow, it's soft and comfortable and a bit stretchy. Good quality. Figured I would attach some photos of it on as well for anyone else my size. I'm about 5'2"" and around 190. I ordered the largest size, which was an XL. It fits a bit snugly on me, how I expected it to. I would love it to be a bit oversized though. So if you want it more oversized, I would go up a size if you can. Very happy with it either way 😊"
5.0,This was great. You get all the tools you need to adjust the band. And it’s very easy
5.0,This is beautiful!  I received one as a gift and then reordered to use as a gift!
5.0,"Even though this is called a sweater necklace, besides sweaters I have some very loose fitting  and flowing silk blouses that this long necklace will look gorgeous with.

5.0,Fitness workouts
5.0,Feels like comfy cotton
5.0,"Very well made. Fits just right and I love the styling, the length, and the snaps. Would buy this again. It is 100% cotton so I am washing on cold and hanging up to dry to avoid shrinkage."
5.0,"Fit my 3 y.o. perfectly, and work well in the sun."
5.0,A bit pricey but very cute and functional! Wear it to the gym or just out!
5.0,He said it's very comfortable. Fit as expecte. True to picture and well made. We will be purchasing more!
5.0,"nice hat , a lil on the small side . it is adjustable ( velcro )"
5.0,My Husband loved this shirt.  Quality was great and it fit as expected!
5.0,"Good fit, comfortable and does not restrict movement."
5.0,Nice. Not to thin. Wore it when it was in the 30s out and kept me warm. It won’t stand up to wind though for sure
5.0,Loved these pants so much! The material is stretchy and fits comfortably. I got so many compliments when I wore them!
5.0,Nice warm cap. Keeps the head warm in colder weather.  Looks like genuine leather. Get plenty of compliments.
5.0,"I purchased one when I was at a golf course in AZ as I would be playing 5 rounds of golf in the AZ sun and heat. I have always worn ball caps but thought it was time to be responsible and cover my ears and neck. I was a little concerned how I would like as I have only worn ball caps but quickly came to really like the hat. So much so that I had my friend pick up another one with our tournament winnings.<br /><br />Wore the hat at my home course this past Memorial Day as it was hot and sunny. Received a number of compliments from the members there. I now look forward to wearing the hat when golfing. I haven't soaked it yet but may need to try it someday.<br /><br />If there is one downside it is that there isn't a strap to hold it down on a windy day. But, it has still stayed put on breezy days.<br /><br />I recommend this hat!"
5.0,Great little dress
5.0,Amazing light weight summer dress! Very stretchable I usually wear a M but ordered a S and fits perfect (has more stretch still)<br />Soft light cotton
5.0,"Nicely packaged to give as a gift or stocking stuffer. However, if you open them and try them on, you're going to keep them for yourself. I was not expecting these to be thick socks. They're so warm & comfy. Perfect boot socks. The red ones are thick all over, the black ones are thick on the soles of the feet. I have to keep these for myself - they're that nice!"
5.0,Great for spring pictures.
5.0,"My grandaughter's feet are covered, and she is not slipping on the wood floor like she did with just socks.  The strap holds them on her feet, and I love the colors!!!"
5.0,Product feels luxurious (soft & smooth leather to the touch). Great replacement leather belt (as long as you have a fitting buckle).
5.0,Love it just how it looks on picture
5.0,"She loves this bracelet!!  She was so impressed by it, she picked out an outfit to go with it right away.  She remarked how it goes with just about anything and she finds it to be a unique piece of jewelry."
5.0,"Longer than necessary, but width and contures are right. Nice thin insole that can be trimmed with scissors.<br />Replaced original insoles and feel like an upgrade."
5.0,Hides my c-section scar and postpartum belly!! I'm in love!
5.0,"Most comfortable yogis capris. The material is great for hot days. The pockets are deep, but I like knowing my phone won’t fall out of the pockets."
5.0,I use them for computer and handheld devices and they seem to keep my eyes from getting so tired from the glare of the screens. They are comfortable and accurate: the lenses seem to have no distortion. I highly recommend them.
5.0,"Very nice! Heavy duty metal and it came in a beautiful velvet pouch, also excellent quality!"
5.0,😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
5.0,My muffin love it and was very happy
5.0,I absolutely LOVE this skirt. I am between 5’2-5’3 160lbs. (I am on the thicker side for legs and a small but) I ordered a Large and it fit perfectly. This skirt is super comfortable and you can dress it up or down and it looks great. I highly recommend buying this and I will be purchasing it in other colors!
5.0,A friend and I were scheduled to March in the Galway Ireland St Pat's Parade.  He needed a tie and I sent him this St Pats themed tie.  It is a high quality tie.  It fully met my expectations
5.0,Great presentation and my best friend loved it!!!!
5.0,"great price and looks really good, i have a small wrist and it is hard to find bracelets that fit, this was just right and i did not have to worry about it falling off."
5.0,These dress are sooo comfortable.  I bought 3 on the lightning sale and going to get more!
5.0,This are awesome. And at a good price compared to some local surf shops.
5.0,I am a avid imvicta watch collector. This product was perfect. Replaced the strap myself for pennies on the dollar. I recommend  this product for the sub aqua noma 3. Perfect.
5.0,Just a prefect gift
5.0,Love it! I'm usually a small but after reading reviews I decided to order a medium and it fits perfect! Love it
5.0,"Love love love this bag! It is lightweight, so the only thing weighing it down is what I put inside. It has a nice, accessible pocket inside to put your cell phone or high grab items. Plus two pockets on the outside for water bottles or anything else. The two smaller straps are long enough to fit over my shoulder and the longer extension strap is great if you want to wear it as a messenger type bag or hang over strollers. It's also very easy to clean. Would buy another one in a heartbeat."
5.0,"Love these shoes they are all I wear.  Sure they are expensive, but they are worth the price.  I have flat feet feet and bad ankles.  These shoes do the trick.  Will order again"
5.0,"People who were complaining about the size as compared to the photo didn't read the specifications closely enough - they're exactly as I expected and they were exactly what I needed. It was nice to get an 18 gauge nose ring so it isn't popping out constantly, and I'm not having any sensitivity issues at all. Very pleased."
5.0,I got these to use with my key tags because the rings that came with them are not worth anything. These are good rings anyone that sells cars and lost a key because of a bad ring knows my pain
5.0,"My son LOVED this as a Christmas gift!!!!! It hasnt faded, or shunk and Hes had it since Dec 2015."
5.0,They are easy to use and get the job done
5.0,Good quality &affordable price
5.0,"These laces are perfect for my 6 year old, who doesn't like to tie her shoes."
5.0,"Light weight, light, alarm, stop watch,waterproof, easy to use. Only watch I’ve worn for the last 30 Years. I buy two at a time because band cracks after 2 Years, however the watch has never failed."
5.0,Great product. Just the right longer length.
5.0,Bought for my mom. sturdy but 20 cards is the limit. She loves the lil pocket for some change but it's not very huge. It's like a watermelon pink color
5.0,"I LOVE the Aoron Premium Polarized Night Driving Glasses. Used them for the first time in a deluge, where the sky turned pitch black. I was able to see the road very clearly without any blinding glare. I highly recommend these glasses, and the vendor is top notch!"
5.0,I bought these for my spouses Smurfs bday party theme.. they worked out perfectly..  We loved them and they seemed to fit all of our “adult” heads..
5.0,This cardigan was nicer than I expected. It was a nice material and cozy. Very cute.
5.0,Very well. Love the material and length.
5.0,My son ordered one through his university and it didn't come in. I ordered this for him and it came Prime and was better quality than the one the university orders.<br />Great seller!
5.0,Very comfortable love the stripes!
5.0,Perfect sun hat for a little girl who loves bears! Fits well and she actually wears it since it’s a bear!
5.0,"This is my favorite watch band and now has become my everyday band. Was very easy to adjust to fit my wrist. Strong clasp, have had no issues of it coming undone randomly or having trouble clasping it together. All in all I do recommend this band"
5.0,My husband wears this shirt all the time!  It washes well and the applique did not shrink like on lesser quality t-shirts.
5.0,Best replacement band! Like how wide it is. Love the color. Looks manly. Simple to install. Comfortable. Will buy again.
5.0,"This is the perfect lounging outfit! Not only is this really cute, but the fabric is so soft,  and comfortable.  I am so in love with this! Buying in other colors.  😊"
5.0,Boy loved it fits perfectly exactly what I ordered size wise
5.0,"Just perfect to use under a medieval costume, enough flair for me with one hoop. It is very comfortable, light weight. I am a size 8, 5'6&#34;, the medium was a great fit for me."
5.0,"This was the first watch my parents bought me when I was a child so this purchase definitely has a lot of sentimental value for me.<br />Despite the price, this watch is built to last, and I am only talking about the face of the watch. As others have mentioned, the band does not seem like it will stand the test of time although it has not broken for me as of yet. Should it happen in the future I'll likely replace it with a 18mm Nato strap. The watch has pretty basic functions including current time with seconds (military time is possible), current day of the week, current date, stop watch, alarm, and not so strong night light that mostly illuminates the left interface of the watch (the only part I wish could improve).<br />As for the wrist band size, I am an adult man and have no issue with it however I can see how it may run small for those with very wide wrists.<br />For the price you really cannot go wrong with such a reliable and basic watch. I own much pricier watches and I would not be surprised if this watch outlives them. I currently use it when traveling, going to gym and even for corporate setting (I love it that much)."
5.0,I love these. I have tops to match them and have gotten compliments on how festive they look. The only thing I didn’t like was they are too long for my 5’3 frame. So I decided to try to trim them down and it worked beautifully. They are the same shape just smaller. It was so easy to do.
5.0,What a fun dress!!<br />I received so many compliments on it!<br />It is cute & sassy 😉
5.0,Arrived as expected.  Love this bag. Easy to carry.  Only wish pockets were larger to hold oversize phones.  Otherwise highly recommend.
5.0,"Amazing!!! Shocked for the quality of these!!! I really don’t know hat would anyone buy the other pair and pay 500$! So god I found these! I LOVE LOVE LOVE them! So stylish! So durable and dark as I like it! Somehow they are very shiny and rich looking, they make every outfit look amazing! I will be ordering more so I always have an extra pair! I was placing the order now but sadly currently unavailable! Crazy! Will keep checking back since I want them from this seller! Please come back! Love love love them! YOU NEED THESE! BUY NOW!"
5.0,Very pleased been using it for several months with no issues whatsoever.
5.0,Exactly like picture. Fits great. Arrived in a week.
5.0,"I love these shorts! These are perfect for lounging around the house yet look good enough to go enjoy being outside. Know that they material is heavy and thick like sweatpants, so don't plan on wearing these to the beach."
5.0,These fit my son perfectly but he is very slim.
5.0,"Husband loves it, says it's very comfy.fits well. Just what he wanted. Great purchase."
5.0,So cute and love the way it feels..like its not even on my toe.
5.0,"My stepson love it he was overjoyed when he open it, the package was so nice he thought he was getting a big necklace or something but he loved it. Thanks Althea."
5.0,"This has gotten me through winter 2020, 2020/21 and we're going into 2021/2022. We have expensive and insufficient heat and this vest has saved me so many times. I literally wear it every day from mid October to some time in maybe april. I have had 3 other heated vests over the years and none of them have been as warm, comfortable or reliable.  I love the normally subtle reflective pattern too!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy 2 anker battery banks to go with it and you'll never be cold again."
5.0,Ordered this for Valentine's Day! Love the buffalo check pattern. Very trendy and comfortable!
5.0,"Beautiful design, very soft, stayed warm in 30% degree weather. Wore a turtle neck with it."
5.0,"This dress is lightweight without being see through, soft and stretchy with a lot of give. It is not super dressy, the fabric suggests something made for everyday, but it can be dressed up. I got it in the navy, it is a true blue navy, no mistaking it for black like you can with some navy things. Wore it to a wedding and got compliments, including how extra slim I looked. Ruching covers the pooch. I am around 5'6"", 43"" 29"" 41"" and got a Medium. Post wedding I might wear it with Converse for a laid-back around town look."

5.0,"These earrings are really cute and elegant. Much better in person than in the picture. I also bought the matching pendant, and I love it."
5.0,I love this shirt!! I tried to upload pics but it didn’t work for some reason. I sized up because I like my exercise shirts to be a little bigger. A large would have fit for sure but the xl fits too! It is so comfortable! Well made. And long! I love the length. Most shirts are too short but this one is perfect. Will order again!
5.0,Love this adds a pop of color to my purse wardrobe!
5.0,Very very cute pants for the office. High waisted and love the material.
5.0,I have told all my friends about these. Amazing fit!

5.0,Great glasses for a baby!
5.0,I actually really like this Yoga set. Ita nice stretch material. Fits like a glove.  The waistband is nicely made and holds everything in. Cons are its warm fabric and falls down a bit if doing cardio. However this will be a winter yoga set for me! It's quite flattering. Im happy for the purchase
5.0,These are just GORGEOUS!!! WAAAAAY better than I ever expected. WOW
5.0,Bought for niece's birthday she loved them
5.0,"I've dropped my phone a couple of times, but the case did what it is supposed to do and my phone is just fine! I get a lot of compliments on it too!"

5.0,"I just got it today in the mail. Decent shipping, it's so flattering! I'm ordering 2 more!"

5.0,"This item came quickly and was packaged well.  The actual jewel box that it came in was pretty lack-luster, but the quality of the jewelry was very nice.  Ultimately, my wife really liked it and will be a very nice complimentary piece to her other Sapphire jewelry."
5.0,"True to size , stretchy,sexy, best part about this dress is for a pencil bottom skirt there is enough room/stretch to walk perfectly, for the curvy ladies this dress is not see thru!"
5.0,Excellent!  Very pleased.
5.0,Favorite. Belt. Ever.
5.0,"Don't do as I did and tell everyone you got these. Definitely don't show them. They think it's weird. But DAMNIT, they make you look like a million bucks! Before I spilt the beans, no one could figure out how my s#%! was so crisp. I'm happy to say I turned a few coworkers to these. Others are too fat and bring up sexuality...even though the only woman they talk to is the cashier at McDonald's."
5.0,"I love this watch. It’s a beautiful rose gold color, and looks very attractive as both a watch and a piece of jewelry."
5.0,Excelente le encantaron a mi hijo
5.0,I agonized over if I should get a belt or backpack. I wanted a lot of water available to me. It took one run to get used to for me. It stays in place most of the time with the exception of smoother pants. It’s comfortable and easy to get the bottle out. I really like and would recommend it. Nice quality.
5.0,"I've had regular tote bags for shopping but these grocery boxes are way better. It folds and unfolds easily. Due to their shape, it's easier to put a lot of things in it and it holds several bags worth of groceries. I've been using it for a year now and had no problems with durability, so I'm surprised to see others are having problems with it. One difference may be that I don't really carry these grocery boxes far. They tend to stay in the cart, or in the car, and the only amount of walking with them I do is from the car to my house, which is a short distance. I'm sure if I were walking home with these for a mile it would put a lot more strain on them. I ordered some more of these grocery boxes because I found I was using them for more than just groceries and actually needed more. I have these grocery boxes with the zipper and some without the zipper. I find the ones with the zipper tended to stay cleaner than the ones without the zipper. I think the kind of lining on the zippered grocery boxes absorbs less stains and so it's easier to wipe off."
5.0,"The glasses are well made, stay on the face and do not pinch the bridge of my nose. They are wonderful fashion accessory and come with a sturdy case for protection when not worn. I love the read color and the cat eye shape! A must have for summer!"
5.0,"It is soft, it washes and dries well, it didn't shrink, my son is a gamer and loved it. What more could I ask for?"
5.0,i really liked the designed but I hated that the hoop you put over my ears where to big and so the mask would not stay on
5.0,I totally love them
5.0,Shirt is comfortable. Be sure to look at the sizing chart. I ordered an XXXL and I normally wear a size 12. Overall am happy at this point.
5.0,They did exactly what I wanted!
5.0,I feel like the compression has lasted a long time. I've washed and dried them over 10 times.  Feels great walking with the extra support with our without shoes. Great value!
5.0,"This is a super cute and very sexy set. It fits as I expected. 34DDD, 29"" waist, 38"" hip the Medium fits perfectly. Silky to the touch and shows off the stomach. (Sits just below the bra line)."
5.0,It was a little big for being a small but the quality is good. This shirt is perfect for me I love it!!!

5.0,"Love these! They’re soft, comfy and hug all the right places yet are loose like a jogger. I’m 5’3, 140 and ordered a medium."
5.0,Hilarious wording on a pair of very soft and comfortable socks. They can packaged in a cute cupcake looking wrap. Perfect for that someone ready to just kick up their feet and enjoy retirement.
5.0,Nice piece that fits the controller very well and has room for accessories.
5.0,The wife loves it. We have 10 Hens and she never has her apron filled at one time. She looks forward to putting it on to go check for eggs.
5.0,Very comfortable and good for 16 to 18 months
5.0,"I love this!  Holds my credo cards, store cards, and gift cards.  Nice size and the heavy zipper is a big plus!"
5.0,Love this and so does my daughter! Would definitely recommend. She gets so many compliments on it. It's soft and fits great but with the longer cut it will last at least a year on my fast growing babe.
5.0,"Comfortable material, lots of sizes available. I’m a girl with a busty chest, so I always order a size up when ordering online. This time, I wish I hadn’t. It runs large, so order the size you normally would instead of playing it safe online."
5.0,"use  them as name tag for my children on a trip. Light, colorful and easy to attach on their pants. quick shipping great price"
5.0,Product is well built and functional
5.0,I cannot say enough good things about this bag.  It fits on a bigger suitcase.  It holds a laptop and cords and medications for taking on a plane.  Fits under the seat and over head.  I should have gotten one sooner
5.0,Cat pin is a beautiful addition to my collection.
5.0,I absolutely love this stuff. It is totally worth every penny. It really works when I got it I put mustard on my old shoes and then used this to clean them to see if it worked and it did. No sign off mustard at all. Made my old shoes look new again.

5.0,This is a perfect lab coat.  Good quality fabric and detailing - looks like the real deal!!  Fits as expected - I highly recommend it!

5.0,Nice and silky..fits perfect...and giftable
5.0,"This watch is very nice and the price is great too.  I love it.  It fits on my arm perfectly without no rubbing or scratches on my arm.  I like the band which is leather, and the color is fantastic.  Since my favorite color is brown.  I had to give my timex to my granddaughter so this is a very good replacement. Plus I like the size of the watch."
5.0,The design is beautiful and the material is perfect and classy. My flower girl will love it!
5.0,"These are Amanda Jeans - nice jeans, have a very long leg.  Be careful if you think you are going to have to return these for some reason.  There is a $6.00 charge for returning.  They are not Prime.  Very dissappointed"
5.0,Loved fit well
5.0,"Love these, good quality and very cute!"
5.0,I get compliments everytime I wear this dress.  The colors are great.  Remember to purchase a larger size than you normally wear as they run small.  It's a great dress that never goes out of style
5.0,"My girls had to get them taken up in the bust area , but over all they were perfect ! No problem with arriving on time or getting wrong sizes !"
5.0,They are great! Picture for adventures so you don’t loose your car key! Or perfect for a server for their security cards

5.0,Better than expected for the price..you could not beat it.
5.0,Love it. Not as big as picture projects but good size.
5.0,I’ve had them for about 3 weeks and so far they haven’t disappointed. I’ve gone through so many different products but these have been the best so far. My feet don’t hurt when I wear them and I feel that my heal spurs have gotten better. I recommend this item to people with flat feet.
5.0,Great dress...very comfortable and flattering.
5.0,We love her new hat. She doesn’t mind wearing it at all. It’s a great fit and easy to clean.
5.0,Like it so faro
5.0,Received these in today and I immediately put them in my shoes. They fit perfectly and kept the tops from squishing which is what causes the creases. I feel really confident that my shoes will not get damaged with these in and it will keep the integrity of my shoes in tact for years to come. Highly recommend!

5.0,Simply great - cannot machine wash but hand washing them is not bad
5.0,"Now this Jersey it’s a brilliant pink. Very cute but it came small I had to give it to a friend. If you are on the large size, run!!!! I usually  wear extra large but this won’t even pass over my head. But in beauty. She is as good as they come."

5.0,Daughter loved this and was able to customize it to her liking.
5.0,really cute and comfy

5.0,Fits perfect brought this for work
5.0,Great sexy fit!  LOVE IT!
5.0,"I've had it for awhile and it still looks as good as day one when I bought it. I bought mine a couple size larger because today you never know what you get but, it fits a couple size larger. So I take it this company has there size correct. I would definitely buy this shirt again once I wear this one out."
5.0,"I've had and worn this watch for a while. I get compliments on it all the time - I found the links super easy to remove and replace. The tool provided with the watch is SUPER effective. It keeps time nicely - in fact, my watch has the white face and came with electric blue arms, which was a fun and nice surprise."
5.0,arrived as advertised very pretty
5.0,timely arrival; good fit and quality
5.0,"This top is super cute, just the right length to wear with my high waisted leggings for working out or yard work. Very comfortable and didn’t have to wear a bra underneath."
5.0,Excellent product. The copper compression has helped my back and shoulders after only a few days. The customer service is also fantastic as they were very accommodating with returns and questions. Remember that the product is designed to fit somewhat tightly so it is advisable to buy one size larger. I will be buying again in the future
5.0,It made me very happy to see how it looked on after I got dressed up
5.0,"Fantastic, gorgeous, stellar. Did not bother my ears and certainly made an impact. They look more expensive than they are, and the asymmetrical design makes them unique."
5.0,Daughter loved this  and appreciated the git.
5.0,"great gloves,.nice texture,..polyester,.white,..very well packed,..as expected,..recomended...they are  little small,.for big handed people,..but nothing serious or dissapointing,.. just dont expect it to fit farther than your wrist line."
5.0,These are perfect for me.  They have a stretch that also holds you in a little. When you move or bend they stay where they are.  They wash well.  I recommend to all.  Very good price too and they arrived when they were supposed too.
5.0,Niece loves these little charms
5.0,My new favorite pair. Went bald so now glasses are important accesories now for me and these are particularly bad-ass glasses! They make me feel like a bad Hollywood mf.
5.0,This was a perfect gift for a 40 year old woman. It was fun and yet useful.
5.0,I bought a 2x after reading the reviews. Great suit but do as they suggest and order 2sizes biger
5.0,"Stylish,  spacious and great quality.  Nicely made. Looks expensive."
5.0,"This is just what it looks like, very beautiful and eye catching."
5.0,Absolutely comfortable and beautiful
5.0,"Without  a doubt, the most comfortable pair of pants I have put on in YEARS!"
5.0,Its small enough to keep in the car for rainy days but its a bit more of a hassle to open than most umbrellas.
5.0,The shirt is fine.  I miss boxes.  It looks crumby in a plastic sack.
5.0,Beautiful silver necklace with sturdy lobster lick. Highly recommend. Would buy again!
5.0,My crazy sock wearing son has dubbed these his favorites!
5.0,Love it! Good quality!
5.0,Loved this purse
5.0,Big hit at my bunco gift exchange
5.0,"When I pulled this dress out of packing I was not very sure that my 10 year old (artist/diva) would like it.  We ordered a size 10 - she is about 65 lbs and 4'10"" tall. It is a bit stiff and seemed a little long for her.  She tried it on and it was perfect!  The lace up back made it very easy to adjust to her torso and it has a bit of a train on the back.  She absolutely loves it - which can be a rare occasion as she is hitting her tweens a bit early."
5.0,"Very warm, think fleece lining and cotton top makes this leggings excellent for cold winter and easy go with boots for kids. I wish the price was more affordable. It is expensive"
5.0,Such cute outfits! My daughter's love wearing them
5.0,I like the titanium & the stone is pretty. The labret works nicely for me. I don’t have a “juicy nose so I’ve lost many studs. This is great.
5.0,I loved the fabric patterns and the material. It's actually waterproof and very beautiful and lightweight. I totally recommend it
5.0,"Although these are lightweight, I love them because they are just enough for the air condition inside but not too much for the heat outside.  I like how they drape and dress up an outfit so much so that I purchased them in about 5 different colors."
5.0,"Just as advertised, great looking, very comfortable. Delivery was as stated. Will probably order through them again. Very happy with my purchase."
5.0,Good quality and easy to wear. Lots of cute varieties.
5.0,"Bought for Halloween, I was worried it would not fit because I have a big head, but it has a snapback option for adjustment! I was so excited to see the snap back! It is also a thick material does not feel like a cheap Halloween costume."
5.0,That being said this is one of the softest pair of pajamas I own. It’s stretchy and very soft and very comfortable. It took a while to get here. Over a month. But it was definitely worth the wait.
5.0,Got this for my 3xl hubby and was worried it wouldn’t fit but it’s perfect and damn sexy on him too :)
5.0,"It's a beautiful bracelet. It didn't come with a gift box, but it also didn't say that it did in the description. I'm giving it as a gift, so I found a cheap gift box to put it in, and it'll work great as a inexpensive gift for the holidays."
5.0,My friend I bought them for loves them!
5.0,Love the colors in these flip flops.  Corky's flip flops are so comfortable and it's the only brand I buy.
5.0,Such a beautiful necklace! Quality and design you love to love. Brighton never disappoints.
5.0,My wife loved these and wears them often.
5.0,"This is my third pair, the first two have held off on over two years of pretty constant use. I wear compression socks every day and these are my go-to's"
5.0,I've worn this twice to Ren Fest and it's great. It looks period enough to be festive but not over the top. It's very comfortable and soft and it breathes well. The navy is VERY dark blue. I plan to wear it for many years to come.
5.0,I have many versions of this dress! It's perfect for teaching. The quality is excellent and the fit is comfortable and flattering!
5.0,"This was a beautiful, well made dress that I bought for my grand daughter and I only returned it because it was a little too formal for just a birthday party. It would be perfect as a flower girl dress."
5.0,I'm a medium but always have a prob with long tops because of my wide hips that need a large! If I had ordered a large for overall fit it would be much too big thru the shoulders & chest. This Floral Find shirt fits my small/med shoulders but also drapes nicely over my wide hips! Love it!
5.0,Super cute watch. Perfect for my college wardrobe because it matches practically anything. Battery was included!! I have experienced​ no problems thus far :)
5.0,This is the most beautiful pendant and very well hand crafted with healing love and light. Many blessings received and will share. Much gratitude🙏
5.0,"This strap is beautiful, the part where it connects looks a little funny but it’s OK."
5.0,"My daughter looked like a princess on her first birthday! 😍 I bought the 18month+ size and it fit like standard 12 month. So pretty! Great value including the tutu, bow and shirt!! I found the gold mocassin shoes and necklace on Amazon too!!!"
5.0,Husband loves it and it was on time.
5.0,This is a great dress!!  I wish they had more colors.  I got so many compliments when I wore it. It covers my tummy area and slams my hips. It’s also very comfortable.
5.0,Very comfortable but wrinkles easily
5.0,I wasn’t expecting much because I haven’t had much luck with clothes on Amazon but I was pleasantly surprised by this blouse. It’s very flattering on and the fabric is soft and fully lined in the front. The first one I ordered the poof in the sleeves were uneven so I ordered a replacement and it’s perfect.
5.0,"I bought one of these for myself and was pleasantly surprised by how soft the cotton is and how high quality the screen print is. I also have the Tina Butt shirt, made by the same company, in the same size, and it is a much thicker, rougher cotton with a almost spray paint like design. Im not sure whats up with the inconsistency but this shirt is great. I get compliments on it frequently. My brother loved it so much I bought the 2xl for him and it seems to fit him just fine."
5.0,"This belt has worked well for my husband.  I purchased it a few months ago, and it's holding up well.  He uses with his jeans while working at our barn."
5.0,"Super cute, love it! excited to  show it off :D I can't decide if I like the cuteness, the price or the free shipping more!!! Its great!"
5.0,So beautiful and perfect length! Especially for us shorties ☺️
5.0,Bought this for my daddy and we both cried when I gave it to him two days before my wedding. A little over a month since my wedding now-- my dad got into a motorcycle accident and didn't make it so I wear it on a chain around my neck. It's the little things that mean the most. I'm glad I purchased this and got to make that memory that just meant everything. Thank you!<br />-Nicole
5.0,"Love this tote! It's HUGE and great to pack up for a day at the pool or on the boat. I can fit all my snacks, sunscreen, towels and SO much more in the bag and there is usually plenty of space left to carry things for others too."
5.0,I really like this ! The fit was perfect. The style is on point and the color is as seen on the picture. I usually wear cut my hair bald during the winter months because I work on mid shift and hate scheduling bar appointments during that 4 month stretch. I just shave it once and run my razor during my showers. This knit beanie will help keep my head nice and warm during the winter months.
5.0,"Looks just like pictured. Fit perfectly and is a nice soft material, so it’s comfortable to wear all day. My daughter loves it."
5.0,"This is exactly what I hoped it would be.  Perfect price, and I love it glows in the dark, especially when I am at the movies.  No bright light shining to check the time!"
5.0,Excellent product!! It comes in individual zipper plastic bags. I have use this straps in 4 travels and they look like new ones.
5.0,What do you want for $18.  It fits my 42 inch table perfectly.  I only can wish for better quality thicker felt to riffle the chips better<br />What do you want for $18 the color is perfect
5.0,Absolutely perfect. I love it. I'll be buying more soon.
5.0,I bought these boots to wear with an outfit that I made and they match and fit perfect and are surprisingly comfortable and not hard to walk in.  I will buy this brand again.
5.0,I pair this visors with my pink swimsuit I got from here it was omg so perfect 🤩
5.0,I love the style and use it over a long sleeved turtleneck on not so frigid days to run errands!
5.0,"Fits well, and looks nice"
5.0,Super cute!! Bought for my 3 yr old niece (who looks like she’s 5!) I got her s slightly bigger size since I made this purchase towards the end of the summer. She was able to wear it twice and it will definitely fit next yr.
5.0,Love these would buy again
5.0,Much bigger than expected and this is a very nice stone. The coloration is excellent.
5.0,Beautiful little outfit!!
5.0,This watch is a very vibrant peacock blue and looks smashing on.  Its big and the date is magnified so its easy to read. The bezel is quite tight but will probably loosen up with use..its also a very vibrant shiny color. The silicone strap is comfy and long enough to spare even with my big wrists
5.0,"Great quality!! I usually buy underwear from Victoria’s Secret, well not anymore! These undies are everything. For reference i am 126 pounds with a mommy pouch and the small fit perfect. They are comfortable and the colors are super nice."
5.0,real good quality
5.0,Earring much smaller than I thought. Great for little girl not adult.
5.0,"Whenever I wear this, I'm told I look like a ballerina. Super cute!"
5.0,"I bought this top and I love it. I’m 5 feet and 120 pounds and I’m usually as US Small. However, I bought 2 sizes larger and got a large. It fits me! Although it is a little loose, I feel that even if I got medium it would be too small. It’s really comfy and I recommend it.  It is see through and you would need to wear a camisole underneath. Order arrived quickly in 2 days."
5.0,Good Wallet but beware it will give you an anaconda booty if placed on back pockets and will not fit in pockets if you were skinny girl jeans as a guy.
5.0,"Very comfortable, no pinching"
5.0,Beautiful initial charms. I bought one for each of my 3 granddaughters and put them on a hand beaded bracelet for Christmas. They loved them!  An adorable charm. Very nice quality. Came quickly too.
5.0,"Lightweight, comfy accessory for those sleeveless tops or dresses!!  When you get to an “age”, upper arms are not always your best feature!!  Not too heavy, washable & adds the “finishing touch” to most any outfit!!"
5.0,Good price - My fiance likes them for days she feels &#34;tired&#34; to hide her eyes!
5.0,"I bought these to wear with my hiking boots as regular ankle socks don't come up far enough and my boots were rubbing. These do the job nicely. They're a little thick and a little big, but they are my go to socks for my hiking boots."
5.0,Good looking!!!
5.0,Good conversation piece.
5.0,This works as advertised.
5.0,Love these! Great fit and long enough.  Wish they made stalls in other styles and had more colors.  Also appreciate the Prime shipping.  Much faster than when purchased on the PajamaJeans site and I saved $7.99.
5.0,Hot this for s christmas present very pleased
5.0,The bag is beautiful and good quality. One happy customer here. &#60;3

5.0,"Great comfortable boot, 26 years of military service and these are the most comfortable boots I have ever bought right out of the box"
5.0,Perfect set for gifting  or keeping !
5.0,"This actually fits perfectly. The bottom is cut so that when you tie it, you can make it as loose or as tight as you want. I have big boobs but I'm small and I have a problem with things parachuting out over my boobs that end up making me look shapeless and fat, this keeps my shape and is sexy.<br /><br />Love it. I want it in more colors."
5.0,The leather tote is good quality.  I have piled a lot into it and it has handled the weight.  Straps and seams holding up well.
5.0,Holds glasses well.
5.0,Fifth This ring is certainly organic in design. The little silver leaves make it seem like the pearl is nesting. The luster and size of the pearl are great.
5.0,These flip flops are amazing. It takes a couple of days to get used to the sole but after that they are really confortable and I wear them all day long. I can be on feet all day long again as long as I am wearing these!
5.0,Were delivered very fast.<br />Nicely packed. In pretty box. Silver polish cloth included.<br />And earrings are so sparkly and cute!
5.0,Good band.  Cheap price.  Easy to install.

No, they probably will not make it a really long time but they were priced as good as I could find. $15. Hard to beat for the Peppa!"
5.0,Very good quality and price!
5.0,"It is my first time using this type headband with inside silica gel, like strapless dress and bra design that prevent sweat from  falling down.  It is made of very good fabric material, goof enough for being a gift to my gym friend. Black is also the most popular color for sports."
5.0,"This product is absolutely beautiful. We bought this as a gift for a work colleague, and she loved it! It is as beautiful in the package as it is on the description. Thank You Luyuan Jewelry!"

5.0,"This is exactly what I expected from a tee shirt. The fabric is a cotton blend, is comfortable and the fit is good.  I got the white with red heart and love it!"
5.0,This product is so much better than the Fitbit brand bracelet.  The Fitbit tracker is secure and does not fall out.  Great quality for the price!!
5.0,pleased with how it looks night and day I keep it works perfect...I recommend it<br />buy it works
5.0,"2 for $8! That's a great deal and once you see the quality, you will understand! Outstanding job, Rotary13B1.<br /><br />I fly drones, planes and race RC cars - always have something to remove before a flight or race. These are high quality key chains and will last! I ended up putting them on my drones - camera cover and one on the gimbal support/guard. I have forgotten to remove them before and now, it will remind me.......REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT<br /><br />---Pros---<br />❖High quality material<br />❖Nice keychain<br />❖2 for $8<br />❖Stitching is top notch! Very impressive!<br /><br />---Cons---<br />❖nothing!<br /><br />░░░░░Overall, great pair of keychains! I actually bought these for my drones - attached them to the gimbal guard/camera lens to remind me to remove them before taking off! The stitching is very impressive for $4 each. I have seen similar keychains that have cheap material that wont last. These, made by Rotary13B1 will last a long time. Make sure that you are purchasing them from Rotary13B1!░░░░░"
5.0,"I am a<br />Christian and as a believer, I recognize our roots are with the Jewish people. I love Israel and was there this summer. I saw these there in shops in old Jerusalem and did not get one at the time. So I ordered it when I got home. It took a little extra time to arrive but when it did, I was so glad to have it. I was glad to see that it was the same quality as the ones I saw there. The texts are in English as well. I have it hanging off our bookcase and it brings a sense of prayer and connection in our home. Makes a beautiful gift."
5.0,Sooo cute!!!<br />Fits perfectly
5.0,"These little birds are so cute and were perfect for the charm necklaces I made. They're simple, yet elegant. The style is versatile."
5.0,looks why more expensive in person..very happy!!!
5.0,"Amazing honestly fits well, material is great, and seems to be holding up in wash. Buying another so i figured i show my support."
5.0,I bought 2 sizes up cause I have large bosoms and wanted to make sure they got covered up when needed. I highly recommend. I also love the sleeves. It adds a special touch to any outfit I wear with it.
5.0,Shiny. Vibrant. Beautiful. Nina Queen has beautiful charms and make great gifts for your loved ones. Highly recommend. 👌
5.0,Purchased this for my grandson aged 10. He loved it. It was well made and the price was wonderful. One of the best things about it is the ability to adjust the wrist size. So many bracelets are made large but there is really no way of knowing until you purchase it. With the rows of snaps you can adjust it to size. Good buy.
5.0,"Great hoodie, and very comfortable. Zipper is on the opposite side than traditional men's hoodies, but isn't noticeable."
5.0,"For the price these are awesome. I have been really happy with mine. I must say they run on the small size though, had to go a size up."
5.0,So comfy and fits true to size! Ordering one in every color!
5.0,Super cute earrings that are a good size and get lots of compliments. I bought them for an Aphrodite costume and now just wear them daily because they’re so cute.
5.0,"Perfect in almost every way. Lovely balanced weight and comfortable as can be. Fits just about and lug set up with matching width, and improved almost ever watch I have put it on."
5.0,"I love these shoes! I have gotten so many compliments on them, I want to buy more!<br />I usually wear a size 8-8.5, but I sized up to a 9. I'm glad I did! These shoes are very narrow! I can tell they would have been too tight if I had bought the 8s. These shoes do need some breaking in, but after wearing them for the past 3 days, they're starting to loosen up. There is no arch support, so my feet are kind of sore the next day. I wouldn't wear these shoes if I know I'm going to be doing a lot of walking.<br />I'm not sure what these shoes are made of, but they look like they'll be easy to clean with just a bit of soap and warm water.<br />I am extremely happy with this purchase and can't wait to buy another cute pair!<br /><br />This product was bought at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"The dress fits perfectly for what I want. It’s a slight bigger, but the bigger size makes me look more shapely. So I would say if you’re a medium go for a large you won’t regret it."
5.0,"These are great, and stay attached to the shirt all day unlike the other brand I purchased!"
5.0,It is so much more comfortable than the original band. It doesn't get caught on anything and is very sleek.
5.0,"I originally purchased the black one without the spot for a patch on it because I wanted a more streamlined look. However, the black one seriously let me down. The material seemed to collect lint like a magnet (see last pic), and it also fit... shallow, if that makes sense. As if it was made for a kid or smaller person. The front also felt weird, like molded to my head or something...idk. Needless to say I was seriously bummed out because I really wanted a cache cap.<br /><br />Making the assumption that the patch might make the front more rigid I went out on a limb and purchased the camo version. I am so glad I did. It actually fits like a normal baseball cap. Doesn't feel small, doesn't collect lint and holds my stuff comfortably! I am almost tempted to purchase a spare backup of this hat in case they tinker with it and mess up the fit again.<br /><br />Idk which version these are, but the camo patch one doesn't use Velcro to keep the storage spaces closed. Rather it utilizes overlapping material. The black one uses Velcro on all the pockets inside. Annoying. So yeah.<br /><br />Excellent hat. 10/10, would buy again and probably will. Refer to pics for fit, etc. Highly recommended. Store your kit in style. :)"
5.0,These are made out of a thin spandex material but I saw them in a store so I knew exactly what I was getting. I am usually a small but I didn't want the to be skin tight so I got a medium and it was the perfect size for what I wanted. They are super short but super comfortable. I've been wearing them around the house nonstop for the past month. Well worth the money. They're also perfect for swimming in.
5.0,The dress was as described. True to color and fit!  Great quality for the price.
5.0,Great fit! Love the quality.
5.0,Very durable love my watch recomend
5.0,I liked everything about it.  There was nothing I didn't like about it.
5.0,"Cute, fun, lightweight sunglasses. Love them"
5.0,"My son love those light up sneakers, fix perfectly, well recommended"
5.0,"Great fit very warm, classy look"
5.0,Good quality hoodie. No complaints.
5.0,These were comfortable right out of the box. I have never been a fan of buying shoes because I have always disliked all of them. My physical therapist recommend these during my pregnancy for sciatic related pain. I noticed a difference day one along with my PT routine the pain nearly went away.
5.0,Super soft and love the high waist and fit
5.0,"My husband bought me this necklace for christmas! I love it! its small, Elegant and understated. Its the perfect accessory to any outfit."
5.0,"Because of low price of these, I kind of expected they would look a little cheap and like blue glass.  I just wanted a blue earring.  They are so beautiful.  They look just like london blue topaz with real gold.  They are a perfect size.  Big enough to be seen,  not big enough to be gaudy.  Love them!"
5.0,Very comfortable.great quality. Nice materials
5.0,"This case is excellent. It provides a secure fit, and protects the phone. Having the kickstand makes the phone easier to share when looking at videos or photos. I would definitely buy it again. It is just as sturdy and high quality as the Otterbox,but at a far more reasonable price. I received this product at a discount for my fair and unbiased review."
5.0,I love these headbands. The flower is pretty large for an infant but will be appropriately adorable by 6 months. My babies head was 37cm last week measured and it's a comfortable fit without marks left by the band. The colors are great and very quick delivery! Overall very satisfied!
5.0,Nice long handle. Keeps the quilt pieces straight without risking fingers.
5.0,I love these glasses. Good quality
5.0,Goes well with Pearls Only Chantel Black 9.5 mm AA Freshwater SS Pearl Ring my wife purchased
5.0,This set was purchased as a gift and she loved it
5.0,My 10.year old daughter loves them
5.0,Love this little cute box
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:f36747f6f3a3444f0372f5c333feff62]] I chose the Rust Red color in small, and was really happy with the color, that it was just as pictured.<br />I was pleasantly surprised that the waist band is comfortable. I find the waist band can be an issue with high waisted pants as far as comfort.<br />I am 5'5, and the length is perfect for me, with the hem falling ankle length.<br />The pockets are spacious.<br />The pants wash well. No shrinkage or color bleeding.<br />I have sensitive skin and not all fabrics are comfortable, so it's nice to find these pants are sensitive skin friendly!<br />Definitely recommend these pants!"
5.0,Not very breathable. But their eye catchers
5.0,My new favorite leggings! Durable but not overly thick material. Great waist compression and perfect length (right above the ankle). I’m 5’5 and 120 pounds and I ordered a small. I love these leggings.
5.0,Even more beautiful in person and my sister loved it!
5.0,This my third pair from Aeravida!
5.0,Real deal.  The clear one was huge.  The purple one was really nice.  Gave that one to my daughter.
5.0,This scarf is really comfortable and soft. I like the hidden zipper for credit cards and keys.
5.0,"Bought this for use with my Mavic Air 2 controller when I attach my 9.7"" iPad Pro.  Clip on connector is secure, especially when the phone or iPad is clipped in.  Neck strap is length adjustable, soft and comfortable."
5.0,Much nicer quality item than anticipated.... very nice rhinestones and other workmanship. Would happily buy another in different color... am a contemporary burlesque entertainer... this is right up my alley.
5.0,What a great item. Looks like it it is very expensive but is not and a very good price.
5.0,"These socks are very comfortable and very soft. They fit just right, not too tight but not to loose. My feet have room to breathe but"
5.0,"I am in love with this! It is so much better than I expected or ever could have hoped! I’ve tried so many different spanx-like products in my time and this is by far the best!<br />I’ll be honest, it was a struggle to get in to but I was expecting that. I ordered a size up from what the chart said I needed and it was a good decision. Once I got it on and hooked/zipped I was so happy! It is durable as all heck, really supports my back and offers ultra tummy control. The material is thick but breathable (the crotch is open, FYI) and definitely feels like it’s going to hold up a while.<br />Usually these things with zippers and hooks cannot handle the pressure/stretch and will bend/snap/jam in the process of putting it on. This one didn’t! No jamming, no bending, no snapping, no ripping at the seams!<br />It does not cut into me anywhere. I assumed it would hurt in the leg cuffs, thigh bend, and under bust BUT IT DOESNT! All of those areas are super stretchy and do not cut in at all.<br />I put this on and then tried on a brand new pair of jeans that I was sure were not going to button, but they did with room to spare! So I know this has slimmed me quite a bit.<br />Trust me, this is money well spent.<br />For reference: I’m a size 22/24, I ordered a 6x, and the jeans I tried on were a new 22."
5.0,This was a present for my husband who loves the Vikings. Good quality. Made for a great gift.
5.0,wonderful leggings
5.0,Very well made with reinforced seams.  Sized for American bodies although I wish I had ordered a size larger for roominess after laundering although shrinkage is minimal.  No fading at all.  Actually 100% cotton and not rayon.  Very very nice!  Will probably end up with one in every color.
5.0,Fits and wears really well.
5.0,Will order 2 sizes up I. The future
5.0,They fit great and comfortable
5.0,Very stylish and unique print. I plan on wearing post-maternity. Totally washable and ready to wear.
5.0,"Bought a package at Tj Maxx and then couldn't find them in the store.  Found on Amazon and these are so comfortable, appear of quality, and look great!  I wear size 13 shoes and these fit perfect.  Highly recommend these socks!"
5.0,Oh my I looked so cute in this. Fit kinda tight but made it work.
5.0,"I originally saw these shoes at Sierra Trading Post and they did not have my size. I am usually a 9 in sneakers but ordered up a half size to give me room. When they arrived they were HUGE (even with the draw string). I sent them back and ordered a 9, which fit perfectly! I would say these shoes fit true to size (+the smallest extra wiggle room). Very comfortable.. I might get them in a few colors! Easy to put on and take off. No low, weird socks needed. I've gotten several compliments about them. Highly recommend!!"
5.0,Yes I am a fan of pearls and bracelets. It came nicely packaged. I'm going to enjoy my Bracelets. Thank you Amazon I been a customer for 10 years and you haven't fail me yet 👌👌👌👌
5.0,Very pretty. I have gotten some compliments on them.
5.0,"Fits nicely,  very comfy."
5.0,"This is adorable. Not sure I buy it being &#34;genuine leather,&#34; but it's cute and fits all my cards. Love the pink color."
5.0,The glasses are light and comfortable.  The polarized lenses keep my eyes from getting tired.  I wish there were more styles to choose from.
5.0,I bought 3 they are so cute!
5.0,Met my expectations. Unique.
5.0,"It fits, I just don’t like how wide the shirt neck is . It’s hard to hide bra straps"
5.0,They did what they are advertized to do.
5.0,I purchased the boots in green. Theses are true to size and look pretty and durable. My little daughter loves her boots won't take them off!
5.0,Looks just like my Pierre.
5.0,Great variety set of fun colorful mustaches and a big bag of black ones.<br />They didn't stick the greatest but it was also 100 degrees out.
5.0,"Although for the rewiews I expected a good product, it was a surprise to find a dress so beautiful and apparent. The dress is a bit long, but it is because I am a short woman. I am very pleased with the purchase, but more than anything because of the fast shipping."
5.0,"Whether it's a placebo or not, my pain is less when I wear it"
5.0,Lot's a fun for a few dollars.
5.0,On time and fits perfect.
5.0,Great product!  Feel secure
5.0,Sometimes you aren't sure...
5.0,I love the charm -- this one is my favorite.
5.0,"Over the years, I have jerry rigged ""grappling hooks"" of a sort on the end of a rope to retrieve or snag various items. Since my wife has forbidden me from climbing onto the roof or into trees, even with a ladder, because of a back injury I finally decided to treat myself to a better tool. This one looks like it will serve my purposes well. I particularly like the locking mechanism. The finish quality is very good and the paracord plus storage bag were a nice touch."
5.0,"High quality, nicely embroidered hat. Best Napa Racing flex fit hat available. The colored stitches stand out against the blue hat."
5.0,Good product. Comfortable. Just what I ordered.
5.0,I wasn't at the party but my sister was and she said it was great!!<br />The fit alittle big so she can wear it over her bathing suit.. Or to bed. and i loved the color.<br />Thank you.
5.0,I bought it as a gift Christmas gift to my niece that likes simple things to operate. Nothing overcomplicated her Mom told me. I know she liked it because sent me a cute note again to thank for it. It is her favorite color and her favorite feature it resisted jumps into their heated pool!
5.0,"LOVE it! Shipping was zippy, the bag has more room than expected, and better quality than expected, too."
5.0,"This was actually an impulse buy on my part one day, and despite the good reviews I feared I would receive a terribly pixelated version of the image shown and immediately regret my purchase. Not so. When I finally received it (didn't realize it was coming all the way from China) I was shocked how good it looked. Turns out it fits better than my previous shower curtain, and now I'm planning on redecorating my bathroom to match the new shower curtain, lol. It's made of polyester, but does not seem too cheap to me. Colors are nice, not too bright but definitely not dull, has a realistic feel to it, especially the tentacles. Definitely recommend!<br /><br />I don't have the greatest lighting in my bathroom, but added some pics anyway for reference. I'm just letting the wrinkles smooth out on their own (they're already disappearing after a few showers)."
5.0,Not  thick or heavy material. The fit is very comfortable.
5.0,"Very Cute, has a lot of storage. Fits nicely in my larger purse. Or works well on its own. I especially like the zipper compartment on the inside."
5.0,"The pants are super comfortable, I like the material and is perfect for exercises"
5.0,"Love this bag for work, it holds my laptop and essentials. Love the outside pocket for phone and chapstick. The bottom even has the studded feet like luxury bags which helps it “stand” and doesn’t get dirty. My absolute fav thing tho is def the drink pocket inside! I put my coffee cup there in the morning and it leaves me hands free!!! Can’t say enough about this bag, I’m buying the black one now so I can swap colors sometime."
5.0,"Is a gift for my nephew.  He hasn’t opened it yet, but hoping he liked it.  Looked like it was good quality."
5.0,fits TTS and would order it again in other colors
5.0,"The watch matched exactly what the picture showed.  Both bands are a soft silicone and very comfortable to wear.  This is exactly what I was looking for, I just wish there were more colored bands to choose from!"
5.0,"These are the best value in high percentage women’s cotton socks that I could find  on Amazon.  They fit great, breath well and are very comfortable.  Even though I washed them in hot water (counter to the instructions) and dried on high in the dryer, they did not shrink significantly and fit just like new. After the first order I bought a second set and then a third!"
5.0,"These forceps did the job great for piercing my nipples, and then the piercer, that pierced me, used them for a tongue, and septum piercing.  I might have to buy another pair cause I think my piercer has permanently lifted them from my possession"
5.0,I love how it fits n flows
5.0,Perfect fit and very comfy.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:e878baf5d5cdaad824f08dd391c04422]] Unboxing of a beautiful Pagani Design tribute watch. AUTOMATIC. Nice quality on first impression. Enjoy!
5.0,"Works much better than I anticipated. It holds the essentials and its small enough that its barely noticeable when seated. The magnet money clip holds cash securely, overall a really great upgrade from the oversized wads of leather I've been using as wallets until now. I'm not a big fan of change but this little thing grew on me pretty quick."
5.0,I like it. Others like it. I'm happy.
5.0,"I bought these for my 8 month old and there was about an inch left at the toe...However, they still stayed on and she has plenty of room to grow. The band at the opening is stretchy cord so they are snug at the ankle. Sooooo cute and the gold matches almost any outfit. She gets complements everywhere she goes with these :)"
5.0,Beautiful and great quality. I highly recommend these beautiful earrings for the pet lover in your life. They were a gift for my daughter and she loved them.
5.0,These are beautiful! They remind me of sunglasses from the 90's era however more comfortable and Mia better player
5.0,My galaxy note 2 just fits I can't quite close the flap but I attach the short strap to my matching bag. Love it
5.0,"Actually my second order of these, ordered some last year for a beach trip with friends but I gave them all away.  They are actually pretty decent shades for the money.  Visibility on the aviators are of course limited due to the lens design, but I just use them at the beach/pool where i'm mostly stationary anyways.  The wayfarers are much more usable in any situation.  Due to the lost cost I actually use them for lawn work not worried about scratching but I also use for any other situation where i'd wear my $100 + pairs of shades as well."
5.0,"This wallet was ordered for my husband and he loves it. It comes in a nice box, has many slots for his cards and a flip out section for easy access to his ID. The leather is not stiff and the stitching is nicely secure."
5.0,"Lite weight for hot weather!, fits well, and good price."
5.0,"My daughter is in the early stages of teething so EVERYTHING is soaked!  These bibs are SO soft, and help so that I do not have to change her shirt so often."
5.0,Super cute workout leggings
5.0,I like the necklaces they just tarnish quickly
5.0,My toddler loves crocs. These are even better. She will run to these every time when I ask her to go get her shoes
5.0,Love that it's not thin and not see through. Adjustable toggle string.  8 year old loves it.
5.0,"These are an amazing and affordable alternative to the OEM lenses. I was able to pop these in with a reasonable amount of effort and they fit snug like they should. Having tried other secondary market lenses that end up too dark, I can say without a doubt they are perfectly tinted and absolutely clear. I would rank these right at the same quality and clarity as the factory lenses."
5.0,Fit is TTS. Such a flattering top. I need this in more colors!
5.0,I like my necklace. I will get a sterling silver chain to go with it. I am not crazy about the black cord that came with it. This small pendant reminds me of a beautiful star standing in front of our moon & making it glow beautifully in our sky.
5.0,"Tom Ford glasses are superior to both Costa Del Mar and certainly Oakley, in my opinion.<br />Absolutely snug and just classy! QUALITY.<br />The seller was prompt and the product is authentic.<br />Nice TF storage hard case included. Worth it.<br />More 'mirrored' than pink, but in the best way possible.<br />I own a lot of sunglasses, but I wear these ones now."
5.0,Love these tanks! Have purchased twice. Very comfortable and do wick the sweat.
5.0,Perfect absolutely love it
5.0,I have two chamberlain garage door openers. One is a late 1990s model and the other is new. These remotes  were easy to set up and work well so far (2 months) and we’re less than half the price for one Chamberlain remote.
5.0,Ordered this one and the res one and they fit perfectly.  Thank you for including the height and weight on the reviews.  Washed them as soon as I opened the package.  Coordinate the dress with natural colored ankle strap sandal that can be worn anywhere!!!  ❤️Them!
5.0,Very flattering . Perfect fit. Comfortable. Great for summer parties.
5.0,these glasses are to cute
5.0,my son rock it
5.0,Finally found a bracelet that fits my small wrist
5.0,I have gotten so many compliments on the bracelet.
5.0,Great product.  Exceeded my expectations in every way.  Great service also.  I will definately buy again.
5.0,"Such a gorgeous pendant! And the chain is just the right size :)<br />I got it for my mother for her birthday, and she loves it~"
5.0,"Loved the way it looked when I received it, now the gold is gone....singing the blues :( .....no longer singing the blues, received a message from the Merchant apologizing and offering replacements.  Now I'm Happy and awaiting my new treasures and a fresh start!"
5.0,True to size my husband wears it all the time!
5.0,"comfortable fabric, fit as expected and pretty colors."
5.0,"Love,Love,Love it !!!!"
5.0,"This dress is very cute and I have people tell me all day how cute it is. I can say it is a cotton like feel so you won't get hot. Do note you can wash it in a machine, but it is lay flat to dry. Would get this dress again."
5.0,Very well made and nice color combo!
5.0,"Your product is great. My son loves it. Was hoping for a little thicker/fluffier, but my son loves it so great job."
5.0,"Super duper cute! I was worried it wouldn't fit at first but it zipped up perfect.<br />Petticoat is super cute, gives it just enough puff.<br />I'm 5ft 4inches and I weigh around 190, I got the XL<br />Good quality for the price"
5.0,hubby loves it.
5.0,I love these and love the closure very secure!
5.0,"Love the material, fit and color.  Perfect for what I need"
5.0,Gorgeous  You can dress this up with your nice accessories or wear it to a summertime gathering.  Very classy.
5.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; and 114 lbs.  I got a small and the fit was perfect.  As mentioned by others, the bra pads are a bit low which feels weird but is not noticeable on the outside.  Definitely worth $14 and makes me look slimmer."
5.0,Work very well and are very comfortable.
5.0,The red color is the real pretty red.<br />The fit is true sized.<br />The shape and the length are perfectly modern.<br />The thickness of the jacket is good for autumn weather and water and wind proved.<br />A wonderful golf jacket and it can be worn in any sporty occasions.
5.0,The dress is very pretty but mines came with a defect in the strap. I purchased the green one. I still give it 5 stars because it doesn't take away from the beauty of the product. The company compensated me beyond what was necessary to rectify the defect and I'd give them 10 stars if I could for that. Good customer service is hard to find!
5.0,Fits as expected because I was warned to ordered the larger size (they run small).  My grandson loves them.
5.0,"Love them, fit great, pretty, confy, and does not press on you stomach. Bought a Small"
5.0,First of all let me say how much AMAZON saved our lives with this dress!!!  My daughters Mary costumes came in from a rental company and were more than disappointing so we came straight to Amazon to try to get them in time as we had less than 1 week before production time.  We held our breath and hoped for the best!  We not only got the costumes from Amazon in 2 days but they fit PERFECTLY and were just WONDERFUL!!!!  THANK YOU AMAZON and thank you to this seller for a great quality Mary Poppins costume!!!  YES take the chance and buy it like I did!!  I'm so grateful!!!

5.0,it was a good purchase at a better price than the stores. and they were available here. its a light shoe and very nice colors.
5.0,These sunglasses are great. Especially for the price. The name &#34;Shieldo&#34; makes them sound like a random Japanese company (which they may very well be). But they're a good pair of polarized sport sunglasses for not that much money. I use them for baseball. Bye bye.
5.0,"The product came a lot sooner than was expected, no hassles! It was definitely worth the price I paid for it!"

It's an iron-on type, and the adhesive has so far held it to my jacket through the action I have encountered out on the paintball fields. It's not coming off any time soon! If you like this patch, check out the SG-1 Team Patch as well: [[ASIN:B00106AHWY Stargate SG-1 Team Logo Shoulder PATCH Group 1]]."

5.0,"I love this bralette.  I bought the white in Large (I'm 34C). It is beautiful in person and as described.  The lace is so feminine and delicate.  However, I will mention that the white is more see-through than what appears in the model photo but still, it's beautiful and sexy. I plan on ordering the black and grey because i love it that much.  I hate underwires with a passion.  I'm so glad I found this seller. I recommend this product."
5.0,"excellent quality, comfortable, but the waist is empire, not at waist"
5.0,beautiful!  My mother loved them.
5.0,very roomy and nice looking.
5.0,I am 5'9 and this was a mid length dress or more commonly called a mini-dress style it hit at my knee. Additionally i felt it was true to size as i am 280 lbs so a 3xl fit me comfortable. I also have a larger chest and this worked for me as well ( 44dd ) however the over garmet sold with it did not have wide enough sleeves for someone who is a 3xl. i squeezed it on and was unable to even close it at all since the back part is not big enough either. I love the dress i just wish the overlay was more forgiving.
5.0,Sweatpants are very comfy and fits true to size.  I love the front and back pockets.  I will be buying in additional colors.
5.0,"It's a flexible storage area for many travel related items. I was able to fit 2 passports, 2 stacks of cards, some cash, a power bank, and charging cables all in this tiny thing. It's a handy and quick go-to pouch, rather than having to dig through a laptop bag, backpack, or even a suitcase for all travel related needs. I like that it has quick-reach access areas for those things that need to be shown all the time, like a bus pass or cash. I like that it also has zipper areas, to conceal things that should be harder to reach. Has a good amount of big and small pockets. Could fit a family's documents in here, if needed. I recommend this to anyone looking for a quick-access, small storage place for many travel related items. For more info, find &quot;echua5&quot; on YouTube!"
5.0,"I’m 4’11” & 135 lbs, ordered a medium and it fits perfect. Did come with something crusty on the V of the shirt but it washed away easily"
5.0,I love this shirt. Good quality and fits quite well.
5.0,Great material. Fits perfect!
5.0,"Took a bit to get here, but that’s fine! It’s very comfy."
5.0,I love this top for summer.  It's light weight and doesn't wrinkle easily.  I also really liked the color.
5.0,"I liked this bermuda unionbay shorts because of the color and length.  Black goes well with any color top and the length is not to short or too long.  It fits perfectly.  I'm 5'5"" and weigh 145lbs so size 13/large worked well."
5.0,Fit great thanks
5.0,The product is as advertised. I like the quality and the size is perfect!
5.0,Took a few of these to Electric Forest to share with friends. They came in handy since it gets pretty dusty there! They were also a great addition to our outfits. Definitely recommend these!
5.0,"was gift from Santa Claus.  Great product, Fast dfelivery."
5.0,Quality compression pants. Everything is snug exactly what i was looking for.
5.0,Very casual. Thinner material than I expected but not see through. Sized down and it fit well. I think it would be easily dressed up with a moto jacket and jewelry.

5.0,"Hand washed, used for dance class."
5.0,Superb nd beautiful as in picture
5.0,Very comfortable capri leggings! Fit as expected.

5.0,Too cute! Fits on the larger side - glad I returned the large for a medium! Always get compliments when I wear this. It is thin and works well with a tank top underneath. Love this shirt!
5.0,This ring is really beautiful. It shines wonderfully and its not high profile at all. I found it comfortable to wear. I don't usually like eternity rings but this one didn't stick out from my finger much at all. It's true to size and didn't feel small even with a wider design. I love it.
5.0,Nice sweatshirt. Highly recommend easy to wash and good material. Fast shipping

5.0,"good deal, quick arrival."
5.0,Perfect for my work keys 🔑! Its durable👍. Great quality 👌. Has the Perfect amount of sparkle 🌟💎!
5.0,I don’t like the fit.  The smaller size is almost too small and the larger size is too big.
5.0,"Loveeeed it!<br />Got al L size, In 5’6 and 145lb and the curvy side.<br />Loose but great cut, so its very flattering"
5.0,Perfect fit great! I'm a 38 d and wear between a 9-12 pants depending on brand and by no means have a flat stomach and this dress made me feel so beautiful!!!! It fit great and felt even better!!!
5.0,"Comfy, nice quality"
5.0,"I love these!  Truth is I used these instead of bras!  I hate wearing bras (I've yet to find one that fits comfortably),  but I'm a 36DD and need the support, so I wear fitted work out tanks underneath my clothes.  I usually buy them a size smaller so they fit snug, hold everything in, give the girls the support they need and keeps them in place (no bouncing).  I have a lot of outerwear t-back tops so wanted same style support tank underneath so it doesn't show.  Other brands I've tried had too much stretch so even in a size down did nothing for support.  This brand was perfect.  I wish they had more color variety.  I'd buy one in every color!"
5.0,"My husband loves this mask. The craftsmanship is great, fits well."
5.0,"These are SO COMFORTABLE! I needed something comfortable as I am expecting soon. The pads cover nicely. I love the colors, too-true to picture (white, royal blue, light blue, black). Would recommend! :)"

5.0,"Love this belt, good quality. I really like the adjustability."
5.0,Beautiful unique earring -the price was great and I got many complements about its uniqueness.  Great for those who don't want to pierce in the cartilage-
5.0,"We love it!! The orange and black looks awesome. My son said the quality feels great, so we will see how it holds up.  We went with Kelme bc I used to use the brand and the quality was always good.<br />Sizing:  It runs a size smaller than normal.  My son is 14yrs old, 5'8 and lean muscular.  He normally wears a Medium and we got the Large. It fits great and not too loose.  If you want loose and baggy like 90s style then go with 2 sizes up."
5.0,The hat is perfect!! I especially like the way it was packaged. I bought the same type of hat from other online companies and it would literally be folded up in a small package and then I had to try to reshape it!!! They had very hard plastic in the shape of the hat that supported the hat perfectly.  I will most definitely be buying more!!!!!!
5.0,"I have used different versions of this same product for many years.  It is the perfect size for a little money, a few credit cards, lipstick, etc., yet it is small enough to fit in my pocket.  The only reason I have had to replace it is that the zippers are nylon--I tend to overfill the pouches and tug on the zipper too hard and break them.  I have also ripped the lining in one of them.  I have been unable to find them in my local stores, so I was delighted to find an on-line source."
5.0,"These wings are just lovely. Very sophisticated color that complimented my 2 year old's winter fairy costume from Halloween 2013. The straps needed to be shortened, but that is easy to fix with a few stitches."
5.0,This dress is awesome and I can't wait to wear it to my sisters Bridal shower
5.0,Love this little ring
5.0,I like these for my husband. The fit is perfect and he says they are comfortable.
5.0,I am very satisfied with these sunglasses.<br />It is just the correct amount of tint to read the dashboard of a car and still have sunglass affectiveness.<br />Ira
5.0,"I love this dress! In fact I ordered more! So comfortable (the summers here get 100+). I like to wear lose fitting clothing and this fit great! I usually wear about a 16, which is loose on me. It is not sheer but it is kind of short for me, but I wear shorts underneath all my dresses (I have little ones who like to lift my dresses up and sometimes the wind picks up unexpectedly out here). Washes well and we'll see how well it hold up over time."
5.0,Bought as a gift for a friend. She loved them.
5.0,"I love these pants so much so that I just ordered a second pair in a different color. The fabric is stretchy and comfortable but with the style around the ankle and the bow, they look very professional.  If you want them a little more baggy, I would say order a size up. They also have pockets which are roomy enough to hold a larger iPhone. I can’t say enough good things about these pants. I’m about to start student teaching and I know I’ll be in these pants most of the time. I’ll probably end up ordering every color!"
5.0,"I love silk! Insulating, light weight, under other clothes or by itself. These silk gloves with ribbed cuffs are roomy and perfect for everyday. Fit well under work gloves or by themselves. Not dressy. They provide good warmth."
5.0,"Very comfortable.  Got them, wore them a time or 2, then took them on vacation to Scotland where I walked in them, miles a day.  They looked great with pants or dresses."
5.0,I ordered 2 sizes medium and large<br />I like the medium fit better it is a thin dress but spanx took care of that!<br />Bought it th<br />I where in cruise super sexy!
5.0,it works perfectly
5.0,Super comfortable and cute! Perfect for my tropical vacation next month. Usually wear size 26 in jeans and small in tops. Size small fit me perfectly.

5.0,So comfy and warm! Cute design too! Love that they come in a pack.
5.0,Beautiful color. Fit is flattering.
5.0,"Beautiful watch band ! Perfect for dressy nights out.  Was very easy to remove links. Easy to clip on and off if you<br />have nails, might not be a easy for someone with very short nails."
5.0,I love this product. It is well made and washes great. I put it on my son when he's done playing in the water at the beach and pool but still wants to be outside. He also wears it when he plays in the sprinkler and with his water table. It gives him great protection but is light weight enough for the crazy hot and humid southern Alabama summers. I cannot recommend this enough.
5.0,Love this dress- I got the blush color and it worked perfect for our family photos!
5.0,I bought this dress for a night out for my besties birthday. If I was brave I would wear it without a tank underneath but it shows a lot of cleavage and I’m not small up top. I am 45 years old 150 lbs and a 36 D and I got a medium and I think I look fantastic! It is a little see through but I am wearing thick tights and tall boots.. you can not beat this for the price and how flattering it is.
5.0,Great product! They fit fantastic and the rubber really holds them up! You don't have to worry about them falling down or slipping and they look fantastic! Make sure to look at the sizing chart because they actually have different sizes for their thigh highs and its amazing!! The little gift bag that came with them is a very pretty and soft material however the inside started tearing apart.
5.0,"Bought as a gift for my son. Great hat, the quality is good. My son loves it."
5.0,Amazing material! Much thicker than I thought from other reviews. I’m normally a Large in tanks and ordered a Medium based on the sizing info and glad I did. It fits perfect!!
5.0,The body suit and shorts fit nice but the headband is too big but it’s okay I’m sure I’ll find another to match.
5.0,"This is very nice.  I love the simple, modern style.  Less is more with this watch for sure.<br />It has a nice black leather strap.<br />Easy pull out time setting feature.<br />Comes with a battery and all ready to be used.<br />The black face is so handsome and classy looking.<br />I love the look of no numbers, I always have.<br />I got this for my teenage son.<br />He loves to wear watches everyday and he is really loving this.<br />It comes in a beautiful gift box and white leather insert.<br />This would be an exceptional gift for any man.<br />It is such a versatile style.<br />My son says it fits him well. No problems or flaws noticed.<br />My hope is that sharing my opinion, perspective, and actual experiences with products I use in my everyday life can greatly benefit others as they make their own purchasing decisions. There have been so many purchases I have made that I should have checked reviews for first because disappointedly, I discovered the hard way that it didn't live up to expectations or advertisements. Now as a consumer, I always look to the reviews and reflect on what is said. Especially for larger purchases. It is so rewarding to find great products that live up to expectations and advertisements.<br />I did receive this item free to try out and give my honest and unbiased opinion."

5.0,My daughter wore it for her birthday and all the guests went crazy for it.
5.0,"This is a beautiful dress!!  It fits as expected (I'm a size 4, and I bought a small).  It also seems very well made.  The lace design is lovely.  I've been all over the place looking for a dress to wear to my step son's wedding.  In fact I've bought 5 different dresses, including a $500 dress at Neiman Marcus.  In the end, I returned all the others.  This dress is very on trend for spring 2018, and I will feel great wearing it!  It's an amazing deal for $25!!"

5.0,Love how well it fit my small frame! I got the extra small and it was indeed that. Size up if you have problem areas. I wasn’t always small and know this cut and fabric needs a size up if you’re curvy and want to be elegant in your fit.
5.0,This shirt is beautiful and the fit is perfect.
5.0,"These are my favorite nursing tops. I have had a ton and paid a lot of money at places like motherhood maternity. But this top is much better then anything I got there and is such a good fit! I have massive boobies, im a 36 FFF and the xl fits great. I love that I can go braless and this top gives good coverage and support for a busty women like myself."
5.0,"Very very nice, exactly what I wanted"
5.0,"This purse is amazing! The quality is good and the cat face is so adorable. It would be nice if it were a bit larger, but it is big enough for the essentials."
5.0,It is a great bag! It holds alot of stuff for me and is really cute! I really recommend
5.0,"It looks & feels nice, have not washed it yet, hopefully it will keep looking and feeling nice for our Packer fan!"
5.0,"When I travel I dont like to take apple watch so that I dont have to take extra cable so I take this watch and I enjoy it. Dont have to charge and is very durable, wish light for night was better but still works well."
5.0,Gave these to students and teachers at school to help with keeping up with masks when they are not in use.
5.0,"Very cool, works like a champ"
5.0,Great band<br />Read the negative about adjusting the size but don't believe it. If you are able and confident it's a piece of cake; if not take to a watch shop.
5.0,Worked for exactly what I needed. Not flimsy and I didn’t break any nails. Highly recommend this key ring
5.0,This was a gift for my son. He really likes them. He can go outside without having to put shoes on.
5.0,"very  nice  good  for  summer,  do  recommend."
5.0,GREAT - COMFORTABLE TO WEAR EVERYDAY AND ALL DAY
5.0,Bought two as gifts
5.0,Reading all the reviews about how it fit I decided to order a medium. I am 5’3/130lbs with 36D Chest so I nervous it would be tight on top but happily It fit perfectly. Not only Is it comfortable but very warm! I am very happy with this coat!
5.0,Adorable and perfect fit.
5.0,Beautiful<br />Bigger than expected but great!
5.0,Replaced a broken band. Worked great.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter as part of her Halloween costume. She was a rainbow unicorn. It fit her so good and went with her theme perfectly!
5.0,Great organization that supports shelter dogs. Nice gift for dog lovers.
5.0,I love this dress! The material is that wrinkle resistant float type. I am 5’3” 143 pounds so have that muffin top going on. This dress is loose in the mid section so wonderful at hiding that!! I will be ordering other colors. It can be dressed up or dressed down!
5.0,"Absolutely love this bag. Was skeptical at first since I saw that they didn't have any reviews on their items. I ordered this purse on a Tuesday and it was in my mailbox by Friday, way before expected/promised delivery date. The purse seems to be real, came with a retail tag, wrapped in MK tissue/wrapping. I absolutely love it and I am very pleased with the quality."
5.0,Christmas gift. They loved it
5.0,I am a Seako kind of guy so I had to get a shirt of one of my favorite anime women :D and this shirt was a great choice! the color is cool and seako looks hotter than ever :) Buy it when you have the time and money!
5.0,"Mask fits well. Lights up nice. It is lightweight.  There are no holes for the nose, but you can breathe. You will need to install a cushion at the forehead area, due to the pressure of the EL wire on the forehead. I found this uncomfortable after 5 minutes of wearing it. After a couple of modications I will be able to wear it to EDC in November :)"
5.0,Nice casual summer dress
5.0,Very beautiful . Never used this kind of earrings before. Fits perfectly . Will recommend them to everybody.
5.0,I wore this in Halloween and everyone loves it.
5.0,Super comfy! Can be casual or can really dress up with jewelry.
5.0,I love the feel of these socks. They fit well and don't ride up too high or too low.
5.0,Good quality. Material is soft and washes really well. My 10 yr old loves the hoodie and likes the length in the sleeves that come to her mid palm. Very satisfied with my purchase.
5.0,"Purchased for grandson who works with autistic children in a classroom- easy to wash, long enough for 6 foot tall man, gentle color and movability"
5.0,was a gift for my daughter runs small at waist and length
5.0,Lots of room and what I needed
5.0,"The product arrived within a week. It was folded and packaged in plastic, perfect condition. The shirt is size XL as listed.<br />It looks great, I am very pleased."
5.0,"My 4.5yr old son loves these. They are really comfortable for him. I was worried they would be too warm,  cuz he runs warm to hot at night,  but they are not. In fact they are his favorite."
5.0,It looks great and fits great i love it
5.0,Love the dress could’ve been went down a size though
5.0,"I had to return this several times to get the right fit. I’m 5’ 9’, 187lbs, 36b (weight is mainly in hip/thigh area).<br />The large was too big, small was too tight in hip area, medium fit just right.  The length goes just past my ankles, and the fabric nicely flows across my body.<br />Ladies, if you like this style of dress,  buy more from the vendor that sold the perfect fit.  I’ve ordered (& returned) quite a few sold from others because the torso was too short, or the fabric was cheap, or the sizing was off.<br />All in all, i love this dress & plan to purchase more :-)<br />FYI: I did NOT purchase from the “plus size” dresses."
5.0,Bought this piece if fine jewelry for my best friend and she loved it and has worn it ever since!
5.0,My son will love them!!
5.0,Fits perfect and has a nice flow and stretch to the material. Not constricting at all. Which I love. I bought size small because usually these type of tops run large. I'm 36 chest and 5'-2&#34; and it hits right about where it shows on the model. Just as loose and comfortable. I'd say I'm athletic build. Not a bag of bones nor a chub. If you're about average in build. This should fit fine. Even if you have a tummy. It camo's it and makes you feel stylish. Love it!
5.0,the product does the job well
5.0,"working outdoors in my yard and trees,etc"
5.0,I was pleased with the quality and fit of these sandals. Seem to be well constructed but time will tell.
5.0,"Good quality, beautiful design, love it."
5.0,These are perfect for walking or running. The hidden pocket is useful.
5.0,Bought as a gift. They are lovely and I hope they are appreciated
5.0,"Found a ratchet click belt at a local Ross store and thought it looked &#34;gimmicky&#34;, but figured it was worth a shot. The real reason is that I have several belts, but my favorite fits just a fraction better than the others and it is ragged out and the others are still new and stiff. I had been searching for that size 40 belt that fit like a 40.5 I guess. Long story short, it worked great. I read a review about a guy sweating one out and it fell apart, but the one I have still looks new after two or three months. I decided to get one in brown to go with the black one and just snagged one on Amazon because it looked like the same exact kind. Beware! I got a Comfort Click belt and was dismayed that it was not as wide and the buckle design was completely different. And not nearly as good for me. The other belt got the good sounding name, but the Ratchet Click belt got the design right. The great things about it. 1 you don't have to bend the belt and search for a belt hole so it is quick and easy and doesn't crease your belt. 2 The strain is on the track system and not on the hole and the belt so you don't get a wallowed out hole or a buckle crease on the belt. 3 and the best thing is that it has one quarter inch increments so it fits like my favorite belt before lunch and after lunch and after working out too. The release system is SO easy and convenient (not like the Comfort Click which uses the buckle itself and the release) and you can tighten or loosen silently and quickly with no fuss. I love just grabbing the buckle with one hand and the tongue of the belt with the other and gently tugging it till it clicks to the perfect fit. My only caveats are that they don't offer a gold or brass buckle and I would really like the belt to be about an eighth or quarter inch wider. This belt delivers on the promise that I always thought might be there for those &#34;web belts&#34; that just wrap around the buckle. But those are just too flimsy and tend to loosen up because of the friction catch not being secure enough. I don't regret buying this belt and will be buying a dark brown next to go with this tan one."
5.0,I loooove this bag it’s perfect !!!
5.0,Easy to program with our garage door
5.0,I love this sweater.  The color was perfect and the fit was right.  I ordered a size larger than I normally would and it fit perfectly.
5.0,"I set it and adjusted the band without the manual.  Everything works well-  the backlight works really well.... I have a 7.5"" wrist, and the watch is a bit small for me- so I gave it to my daughter and she loves it."
5.0,"Loved this does! The x-large fits perfectly for a US 14, and it looks even better with a petticoat."
5.0,Nice sexy shirt great for the beach and grabbing some attention.
5.0,"Super cute, wore it with a black crop top for a Latin party."
5.0,Runs a lil big but not too big. My son still wears them to school. Great material and very durable!
5.0,"yes I bought a 2nd pair, you must buy they are  wonderul"
5.0,love this dress!!! got so many compliments on it when I wore it for a wedding.  Can't beat it.
5.0,"Fit great and are well made. Tempted to buy a second pair for working out. If you are curvy like I am, these are great for support and tummy control. Highly recommend."
5.0,Bought this for our 6yo it’s small enough to fit in his pockets. Also bought one for our 4yo and it fits in his jeans too.<br />Perfect size. Has zipper for the dollars and another for the change.
5.0,"Much better than the ones I got from the hospital after hip replacement surgery.  Comfy, easier on/off, and MUCH more durable.  Happy camper! :)"
5.0,Yes. Great product. I am very satisfied.<br />It did its intended job. Thank you very much.<br />I Would definitely reccommend it.
5.0,Love Love Love! You can dress them up or down and they are perfect stretch
5.0,"I use this obi for iaido. Not only is is attractive, but it wraps well, keeps its shape, and holds the sword in place. At this price, it’s a real bargain."
5.0,This watched arrived promptly and was packaged perfectly. Virtually no chance of damage. I love the combination of the navy face and gold case. The watch is classy & easy to read. It is quite large & my wrist is pretty scrawny but the band allowed me to adjust it to fit.
5.0,It came when expected.. And I love my dress 👗
5.0,"Beautiful!  I bought as a gift and she loved them. They smelled amazing, too."
5.0,It was great fit!!!
5.0,Love these candles and supporting a great cause!!!
5.0,"I buy these for my 4 and 2 year old. They love them and are great for dress shoes and slip on flats. Yes, they tear...just like mine, if I walk outside without shoes. They hold up pretty well usually have to toss them because they get old, not because of them ripping. Highly recommend."
5.0,These will be used as weights for loose warp yarns on my weaving projects
5.0,"Waist is rather snug (in size 4) but once I got them on, they looked great. These denim-look stretch skinny jeans have holding power and make my thighs look slimmer! Will definitely buy again"
5.0,"Beautiful color and fit as expected. I am 5 ft and 117 lbs, I ordered small and this dress fit perfectly. i received compliments from coworkers wearing it. My only concern is to make sure you put it in seperate bag during wash if you wash it with washing machine so it won't get caught with outher clothes because the material. for the price i pay it's a great buy. DO NOT DRY IN HEAT IT WILL SHRINK ONE SIZE DOWN."
5.0,I am very happy with this phone case. I love it!
5.0,This band lasted almost 2 years before the silicone began to pull away from the metal parts. I think that's pretty good for a watch band.
5.0,EXCELLENT for one time use to supermarket etc. I have large hands and plenty of room.<br />Wouldn’t know but these seem like they are stronger than I use them for. Came very fast and not too crazy price considering all the price gouging happening. VERY HAPPY.  Note mostly high reviews.
5.0,I would order these again. I had to send back because they were way to big. I ordered for a true to size fit. I should have gone down a size.
5.0,These shoes are super lightweight and indestructible. We wash them 2-3 times a month because my kid is magnetically drawn to mud puddles! They’ve survived perfectly (3 months in). My shoe-hating toddler loves wearing these shoes!
5.0,"I bought this (even though is not intended for maternity) to use the last trimester of my pregnancy and also the postpartum to have something nice and comfortable to wear without spending too much.<br />I was a little bit worried it wouldn't fit or that it would be too tight but I was surprised to see it does fit and I still have plenty of room to keep my growing belly. My belly measures 109cm / 42.91"" at the moment and I bought an L, as I said it fits perfectly, although it's a little bit loose around the shoulders but I don't mind because I like to move my arms freely while I sleep.<br />The fabric is very soft and nice quality for the price."
5.0,Tote bags or laundry bags
5.0,"Such a cute, flattering dress! I am a size 4, but ordered a medium based on other reviews, and I'm glad I did. It fits just right."
5.0,Absolutely love this shirt.
5.0,"Fits great, works great, doesn't let any water in and doesn't fog up. Though I wouldn't recommend it for kids."
5.0,"I’ve bought multiple pins from Pinsanity and I adore each and every one. They look even better in person, but they're pretty much just like the pictures. I’m very pleased with the shapes and colors."
5.0,Turned out super cute for a Mardi Gras themed birthday party. Lots of complements!
5.0,Super vibrant pink! I love it!
5.0,I love these I want more prints!
5.0,Something new and different
5.0,I loved these so many choices I love the moon n stars so much very well worth it I definitely recommend
5.0,Good fit for a good price. I purchased these for my daughter who is going away to college. She needs something comfortable to wear around campus.
5.0,Very cute and fun. Would recommend.
5.0,I love this dress!! So comfortable and cute! Looking to see if I can get in other colors! I'm a little busty so there is a slight pull at one button but if I want it to fit everywhere else it is what it is...how my choices are either a little too big or fitted. This I love fitted
5.0,"Have been using this product for a few weeks and it seems to be high quality and is, so far holding up better than the original band. Great value for the price. The rubber is stiffer than the manufacturer's band, but have noticed no problems with that, and it seems like it may in fact, not fall apart like the original"
5.0,Great way to keep glasses handy
5.0,Omg i loved this dress it for my daughter for my vow renewal June 2019<br />I just had to order a new one
5.0,Very cute dress the fabric is a bit heavy but besides that everything is good
5.0,"Good size to carry laptops, note pads, etc."
5.0,I like this apron and it will work well in the kitchen.
5.0,"I used several screens then dry panned the concentrates, got a lot of silver and some gold out, even a picker!<br />The platinum will take more time to sort out."
5.0,My boyfriends nickname is Mouse and this is the only keychain I could find with an actual mouse on it! I wish they could personalize but other than that it’s great. Nice thick leather and the print is exactly as shown.
5.0,"It's a beautiful bag, and it holds a lot.  I ordered a 2nd one.  I wish it had more inside pockets, but the two outside pockets are convenient."
5.0,"Love the bag! Has all the room I need to carry my phone , wallet & necessities. Am thinking of getting another one for a spare only bigger."
5.0,Love the shirt runs a bit small .
5.0,"Awesome sunglasses unfortunately they don't go with my face, will give to my daughter."
5.0,It's so hard to find a cool hat that had a bun hole. My fav. Only it has some plastic in the front that is uncomfortable at the forehead.
5.0,"These came in handy with my post-parting, an honest god sent! Great for after periods too when you can’t use tampons and who wants to use a pad? Lol"
5.0,"This is the most adorable skirt. I paired it with a vest I got from Scarlet Darkness and wore the outfit to the Ren Faire. It is 98 % cotton and 2 % spandex. It has a flat front and elastic in the back. It includes a detachable tie belt. The fabric isn't smooth, it has a nice texture to it. The lace at the bottom is well made. I washed and hung dry. No issues."
5.0,Husband hates white shirts but loves this one. Great fit and material.
5.0,"OMG! I love these slippers! [[ASIN:B008BAHFOU Orthofeet Asheville Comfort Arch Support Diabetic Mens Orthopedic Slippers 10.5 M US]]  I  bought them for my husband. We have a lot of stairs in our home and after a few trips up & down, the knees and lower leg can begin to hurt. Well... not anymore! These slippers have amazing arch support. They are very comfortable and provide a lot of support. The slippers have an adjustable instep and Velcro straps to very the width.  The results were amazing, better than advertised and worth the extra money. After four months of wear, they still look and feel new. I even bought a second pair for myself to help with my  plantar fasciitis. I just bought the women's equivalent sizing ( 8.5 instead of a women's  9.5). I had been wearing some Sketchers Bobs  [[ASIN:B00IPLR6QM BOBS from Skechers Women's Keepsakes Delight Slipper,Black,10 M US]] but they don't offer enough insole support."
5.0,I love this. Fit so love this. It is great and perfect for summer. Very comfortable.
5.0,"Thank you) it looks beautiful, the price is 👍 great. And it comes with all sizes together. I ordered two packs of silver (3), and gold(3).  And I love it❤️❤️❤️"
5.0,These were a bit small but when I emailed the company they were more then happy to work with me and get me the correct size. The boots themselves are great!!! Would Deff order another pair and my toddler LOVES them. He is always having to wear them!
5.0,Darling dress and fit great. I’m 5’6” and 120 lbs and got a small. Fit so well!  I get tons of compliments on the dress every time I wear it!  I will be ordering again.
5.0,"Fits great, is comfy and stylish. Looks awesome off the shoulder but can be worn on the shoulder as well. Love the ribbing, seems to be high quality and true to size."
5.0,"Love this dress! I bought the teal and grey dresses.  It's a great material - it has 2 pockets.  I bought it for everyday use and vacations.  It's a bit long for someone who is less than 5'2"" tall.<br />Glad they have this dress in multiple colors."
5.0,Exactly what I wanted - a thin-ish RFID wallet where the cards inserted vertically.  Bravo.
5.0,item shown was 'as is'. thank you.
5.0,Loved it .... got it for a wedding ... it rocked ... looked to Elegent completely like it is in the picture
5.0,They are soft  comfortable and cute
5.0,"Good quality, very comfortable, at a good price."
5.0,"They are absolutely stunning! No regrets! I bought it for my 2 year old (Almost 3) she usually uses size 7 on regular shoes but as a Mini Melissa lover I knew that they run small, so I ordered size 8, it fits a little bit big but she will have the opportunity to use for more time. They arrive on time (5 days)."
5.0,Nice fabric. Doesn’t wrinkle. Worn to a luau in Hawaii.
5.0,"I little tight and stiff at first, but after 2 days it wears on the wrist perfectly."
5.0,Loved these!  Perfect for my sons at the gym.
5.0,I have purchased several Bella Fascini charms and have been happy with all my purchases.  They come in 3 different sizes so you'll have to be sure you're getting the size you want.  I usually order the middle size.  I have uploaded a picture so you can see how I used my charms. I would recommend.
5.0,"Very nice and believable Cubic Zirconia earrings! I have one other pair of CZ earrings in the round, but these are by far of greater quality than my other pair. I love the 18K white gold over sterling silver which is important in helping to prevent allergic reactions to the nickel content that is a lot of sterling silver. The CZs look like really high quality in a 6-prong setting, and have great clarity and brilliance. This is the first pair of earrings I have had with rubber backings, and they are quite comfortable verses the traditional backings. It is recommended that you clean your earrings with the provided jewelry cloth after every use, and put it in an air-tight bag if you not expect to wear for a long time. Keep in mild temperature and low humidity environment. The heat, light and humidity will speed up tarnishing process. You should not store it directly in wood case for the wood containing acid in molecular structure that is harmful to sterling silver-something I was not aware of! You should always keep your jewelry away from chlorine, which make it appears yellow or black.  Take off sterling silver jewelry before swimming or having a bath, and store separately to prevent pieces from rubbing against each other, causing tiny scratches. These great looking earrings were made available to me at a reduced price for review purposes. I was compensated in no other way and I am under no obligation to give a favorable review for having purchased them at a reduced price. My reviews are based solely on my own personal opinion. I am happy to give these earrings a solid 5 star rating for quality, design and believability."
5.0,NICE and cute! Ha highly recommended it! Thank u 😍
5.0,"Came on time, works great. would buy again"
5.0,It was more than I expected.
5.0,"Wasn't sure I was going to love this nightshirt... the description is 100% cotton but because the pattern (zebra stripes) appears to be silk screened on, the material feels stiff at first. I've washed it a few times and it is softening up.<br /><br />I like the black trim around the neckline, and it is generously cut for those of us who carry a little more junk in the trunk. Plenty of room in all the right areas.<br /><br />__________<br />UPDATE Nov. 2019- after wearing this nearly every night for more than 2 years, I still love it. It's held up well to being laundered every week and none of the hems have come apart. The silk screening has faded, however... the black is now more of a dark, misty grey, but the trade up is that all that washing has made this 100% cotton nightshirt just that much more comfortable to wear."
5.0,Quick shipping and as advertised.
5.0,"Me encantan las licras, tela de calidad, buen acabado, bonitos colores tal y como se muestra en la foto, escogí por los 2 bolsillos que me permiten llevar cómodamente los geles y suplementos al momento de correr y entrenar larga distancia"
5.0,"Sizes run small and I am only 5'4'' and usually wear a small -- the XL is perfect.  Nice neckline -- i have bought 3 -- the red, black and cream<br />They look good with jeans to dressy."
5.0,Was told by multiple individuals of both sexes that I smoking hot fire in this tshirt. Totally got me laid.
5.0,"Love these, perfect size hoop. Good quality and great price."
5.0,"This is such a nice shirt.  It's chiffon -- therefore a little see-thru, so have to wear a camisole with it -- but that's OK.  Looks cute with a vest too. Haven't worn it yet, so don't know about comfort level -- but I like it."
5.0,"I'm 6'1 and Weight 167lb. When ever i buy clothes I always go for size large but with this one it was different. I first bought the large size which it was okay. It just didn't fit as expected. But when when to a medium, it fit me perfectly. Is not too big or too small just the right size."
5.0,super soft and cozy sleep shorts.
5.0,Light. Breathable. Nice
5.0,"Looks great, fits good and shipped quickly"
5.0,I love ear climbers and these Unicorn climbers are beautiful.  The rainbow colors are a little lighter than I expected but they're still really nice and the hook at the top plus the stud at the bottom makes for a really secure fit.
5.0,"I bought these as a cover-up since swimwear is getting oh-so-cheeky and those of us with a big butt take it to an obscene place REAL quick. These are cute, somewhat sheer, and serve that purpose well. The band definitely hits at the narrowest part of your waist (high waisted style)  so if you have a thicker torso going up a size might be a good idea to not feel pinched. I got a small and am 130#/ hour glass shaped and they are snug at the waist but workable."
5.0,So comfortable and flattering! I'm getting it in many colors!
5.0,I've been wanting to try a slim wallet for a while now.  I rarely carry cash anymore and this wallet has plenty of room for my debit and credit cards.  I won't be going back to the old bulky tri-fold.  Great product.
5.0,"I love these dresses! I have a couple from this brand that I got while pregnant. They are so flattering! This one offers good coverage at the bust, but can still offer easy access for nursing."
5.0,I love this clutch. The pictures don't do it justice.
5.0,Perfect fit and performed as advertised
5.0,"I just love this case! I've had so many great compliments on it! I use my phone a lot every day, all day basically, and the writing on the back hasn't come off or chipped (I drop my phone a lot too) !!! And with me dropping my phone, my screen hasn't cracked or any other damages! So happy I bought it!"
5.0,These are really warm and cute. I bought to try them out on my 1 year old and they fit perfectly. Definitely ordering another set
5.0,it very comfy soft
5.0,"I like this swim cover-up, however the knit fabric is a bit warm for tropical weather. I bought it for cruise I was going on and only wore it one day because it felt too heavy and warm for the super warm weather we were in. I think it'll be better suited for lake days or something. That said, it looked exactly like the photo (color & detail are accurate), and it fit as expected. It's pretty well made, though would be VERY easy to snag on just about anything. So far I've managed not to get it hung on anything, but I'm sure the day will come.<br /><br />As long as you can accept that it'll eventually get snagged on something, I'd recommend this product! Beautiful color too..."
5.0,Kind of a thick waistband
5.0,3rd purchase of these - husband and son both love them - can''t beat the price

5.0,I ordered these earrings in Rose Gold and they are absolutely gorgeous. I definitely recommend buying.
5.0,Soft and comfortable fit. Runs true to size. Good quality
5.0,"I am pleased. The fabric is not too thin. It is kind of heavy, not as in thick and wintery, but as in weight heavy. But very comfy. It fits true to size. I am a large, I ordered a large, and it fits great."
5.0,"This is a wonderful bag. It has all of the details we've come to expect from Michael Kors, including rich texture and color. Its a casual yet classy bag, with a twist on the hobo style."
5.0,They are truly comfortable.  I have diabeties and the Doctor said no running around barefoot. These are the next best thing to being barefoot.
5.0,Great band for my Fitbit Alta
5.0,"beautiful, high quality"
5.0,I travel a lot for work and these are great for keeping me organized and helping me to find what I need quickly without rummaging through my suitcase and messing everything up.
5.0,"A Christmas gift to my husband, he loved it but he has a huge head so it was not comfortable.  It is a fabulous idea but it should be made adjustable because I don't believe one size fits all!"
5.0,Feels like wearing nothing but supports and stays in place all day.  Comfortable option great for backless dresses

5.0,Love love love this dress!<br />I am short 4’10” this dress came to a great length for me. It covered very nicely as i am quite busty. All day people stopped me to comment on It and most asked where i found It. I was Not disapointed! I ordered a medium.

5.0,These are great. So comfortable. Wore them all day!
5.0,I have lots of friends who love to read. So I will make them bracelets with these charms for their birthdays.
5.0,Great bag. Nice color. I do wish there the center pocket was made for a lao top instead of a tablet. My lap top food on the either side pocket so it's not that big of a deal. The bag does lean to the side that the laptop is on but doesn't fall over.<br /><br />Overall is a great bag. Looks very professional and I love having the option of using the shoulder strap
5.0,"Sturdy and stylish. Work fine as eyeglasses go, and seller is accurate and efficient."
5.0,Fits great and very well made.
5.0,"My baby girl looked fabulous in this suit!!! Nice material, beautiful fit!!!"
5.0,"Wore this as a swim top over my bikini after one too many sunburns on my chest this summer. Based on other reviews I sized down from my usual medium and ordered the small. Glad I did! I wanted it to fit snuggly since I planned on swimming in it. Fit was perfect for what I needed, held up very well in the ocean. I plan on wearing it the rest of the summer. Feels like bathing suit material which is exactly what I wanted!"
5.0,Wife likes it a lot. She says she normally wears a medium and with this she wears an extra large.
5.0,"Fit is perfect, will buy again"
5.0,"Love them, they look exactly like the picture, perfect condition. Will definitely order again. Just doesn't come with the back but that's fine."
5.0,Great !!!  Will definately order again.
5.0,The material is so soft. Fits like it should. I like that it’s not fitted and is longer. Will definitely buy more
5.0,Easy on and off for a compression sock
5.0,The now proud owner said “they’re so soft”!  Good fit - great for cold weather now.
5.0,There’s nothing that I disliked about it I Purchased it as a Christmas present
5.0,Nice belt. Good looking leather. Fits great! Thanks!
5.0,Love these they are so Comfy! Definitely would but again.
5.0,Perfect fit.  Just wrap it around you and go.  So cool and comfortable.
5.0,Grate masks sturdy and look great !!!!!
5.0,This set of cufflinks made a great gift for my brother-in-law. Scroll work is understated and classy!
5.0,"She is all about stranger things right now, and she absolutely loves this mask. It fits her perfectly! I love that you can resize the ear straps. There are no gaps anywhere around the mask which is the best part. Definitely considering one for myself as well."
5.0,I love it ?
5.0,I purchased a similar watch like this not long ago and I was so satisfied with it that I've decided to purchase a similar one as a gift to myself and I can say that this is one of the more beautiful watches I've had since I return to wearing watches again. I used to wear watches long before the Smartphone era where I stopped long time ago with the incarnation of the iPhone 3GS. I recently resumed that habit as I find the watches now these days more like a fashion item rather than aided accessory. The watch design is very impressive where the straps are made of some sort of leather which is very soft and feel pleasant around your hand without any metals to rip your hair around your hands. It is easy enough to read the digits during the night and it's pretty lightweight. I haven't tested the watch around water although it is mentioned that it is water resistance up to 30M but I don't want to wet a beautiful watch like this so I am keeping it away from water for the time being. I purchased this watch for myself but this can be a great beautiful gift for men as it's practical enough and also beautiful and not to mentioned that it cost less than 20$ where I guess you'll not find too many bargains like this. Overall this is a nice watch and I am satisfied being the owner of it and would highly recommend it to others.
5.0,"Love the sparkles, color and flower design. Lots of compliments so I shared with many others at work."
5.0,"This keychain is great, I love it."
5.0,Comfortable all day and fit great

They're easy to clean and I can finally stop wasting money on sneakers that he wrecks by playing in the backyard, dirt, Creek, river etc...Amazingly enough, they stay on, they're comfortable and easy to put on/off. Purchased these in blue and gray.  Very happy with them!"
5.0,"Baleaf hasn’t disappoint me. Their brand is high quality, this jacket is great and perfect for winter<br />✅<br />-thick, warm, water resistant fabric. It’s very cold this days 5 degrees Celsius or around. I can go out and it protects me<br />-reflective details<br />-design provides a nice fit<br />-high neck<br />-size up. I am size 6-8 and this is an L. For a looser fit I would’ve gone for a XL<br />-high quality overall. It’s worth to pay this price point<br />❌nothing to report"
5.0,Love it im like 6' and a med fit great.
5.0,Perfect for all ages.
5.0,"On time delivery. I love the style, color and look"
5.0,Awesome dress!  Could go down a size of between sizes.
5.0,Bought for my grand daughter..very cute and dainty..wish it came in a cuter gift box.
5.0,I really love these dresses from Herou.  I have at least 10 different styles
5.0,"I give the watch 5 stars, it could use a more sturdy chain. I had to replace the chain but I really, really like the watch. I recommend it to anyone who is an owl collector like myself, for the past 35 years."
5.0,Great fit for our 7 year old.
5.0,very nice hat at a great price. More small than med. I ndeed a small so all is good.
5.0,Very nice bag! I purchased more than one because my son carries these types of bags daily! Not cheaply made at all and I like how you can adjust it while wearing it
5.0,"Very happy with the fit, this truly a compression shirt and not just a stretchy one like others I've ordered.  Would buy again."
5.0,"Fit like a glove, soft, comfortable."
5.0,"Love shoes , sleek !!!"
5.0,"I just love this shirt.  A nice design with the 1/4 zip.  I got it in the yellow ochre.  It is a wonderful color, just like in the photo.  The bamboo fabric is so soft.  I ordered it in a medium, my usual size, and it fits as expected."
5.0,This was an amazing product
5.0,"My grandaughter had these boots  already but they  started to come apart around the seams. These are replacement boots, hopefully these will last longer."
5.0,"Excellent mask. Fits great, very breathable, lightweight but keeps it's shape, the grey color is easier on the eyes than black. And I love knowing that it is infused with copper for extra safety in killing off viruses."
5.0,UPDATE: It now ships super fast and has several colors!! Super stoked! So when are you coming out with an affiliate program so I can get a cut from the HUGE amount of customers I have sent you? :)<br />—
5.0,"Love the dress, fabric is very comfortable, got size medium and it fits as expected. Would like to buy also in different colors but just not so sure about the other prints."
5.0,"I have a sporty band, but needed something more cocktail/black-tie appropriate so I could wear my watch to a wedding.  This is beautiful and really nice quality.  I like that they give you all the tools needed to customize the size and remove links.  Worked perfectly.  Thanks!"
5.0,If you’re looking for compression socks these are the real deal. They are tight and tight for a reason! I’ve had to wear these bc of low blood pressure and they have helped. Follow the directions to put them on and take them off.
5.0,Good quality & great collor!
5.0,"So soft and comfy, and I love the pockets so I can carry my phone around the house."
5.0,Very cool patriotic watch band<br /><br />The white stayed super white after 3 months now of everyday use!
5.0,These are very nice! But they're much darker pink than the photo like a fuchsia pink and very bright so if color matters you should know that. But they do the trick for anything that I need and they're well-made.
5.0,"Good entry level watch! I really like the coating thats why I bought this model.<br />It has K1 in model name, so I am sure it means made in Malaysia."
5.0,sexy as fook
5.0,Great for hubby. I may try to find a pair in antiqued gold/ brass for me.
5.0,Great shoes for narrow feet.  Lots of support.
5.0,My husband needed a small case to carry a few essential cards and license.  He loves it.
5.0,Love this sweater! I found this one after considering the brand name version on another site. This sweater is just as soft and comfortable for half the price. I love it so much I ordered another color!
5.0,I love the top!! I love the color and I loved how it is soft and it is a bright color which works for my workouts
5.0,"I love BOCAR jewelry!  I have several of their necklaces, and I'm sure that I'll buy more.  Always good quality, fast shipping and packaged nicely."
5.0,"I love it. It is pretty short in the torso but I think it is supposed to be like that. You either have to pull it way up your bum so it's almost a thong, or tug it down so you have some pretty deep cleavage. I went a size up because I intended to wear this actively (Snorkeling, volleyball, catch, etc.) on the beach."
5.0,"I love it!  The lights blink and there are plenty of them. Plus, the lights are spaced perfectly all over the hat—randomly, just as you would want.<br /><br />The hat fits me perfectly—although I’m an adult, I have a small head and normally wear regular hats in a small, x-small or xx-small. Normally sized Santa hats usually fall down on my ears. It may be due to the battery casing in the white fur brim.  By the way, the battery casing is well hidden and doesn’t show at all.<br /><br />The hat seems to be well made and is soft. Not as soft as those made of velvet, but plenty soft.<br /><br />It did come with batteries.<br /><br />I can’t wait to wear it!"
5.0,"Dress is very nice, material is nice as well. This dress will fit well for all standard size women. I wear petite and decided to purchase a regular small and fits me a tad bit big but no big deal, I'll wear layers."
5.0,"I loved the it. The quality, the fit and all"
5.0,"So soft and comfortable. Absolutely love it. Was worried the medium would be too small but it fits perfect, a little loose but that’s how I wear them."
5.0,Great products. Recommended.
5.0,great company quality is a+ love the glasses
5.0,I love this sweatshirt so much I want to order two more in different colors.  Runs a little on the large side..but I still love it.

5.0,Great.  Use it all the time.  Plenty of room for money and cards.  Perfect size.
5.0,"Love this jacket. It is comfortable, warm, and fits well. I am 5ft. 107 lbs and it’s perfect in a size small. The sleeves might be short on a taller person with longer arms."

5.0,"Love everything about this dress-the fit, he color, the fabric.  If only all fair trade clothing was this attractive and well made."

5.0,this sweater feels great looks great . runs a little small but besides that it's  a great buy
5.0,This is a cute top. The fabric is a little thin but not super thin. Better than I expected for the price. It has held up to washing perfectly. The fabric is soft and breathable. Great for summer.

It is as you see in the photo. And I promise you will not be disappointed. Definitely a very good buy. I recommend it. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. [[ASIN:B01E6J0AVY FIBO STEEL 8MM Stainless Steel Rings for Men Engagement Wedding Band Chain Ring, Size 10]]"

5.0,I absolutely love this item ~ I ordered to size & it fit 100% & is very flattering to my figure. ~ I can’t wait for my daughters wedding in the summer!
5.0,"Have been looking for these for a long time! They work so well, stay in place and easy to attach. They aren’t too padded either; just enough."
5.0,"These socks feel really great, and i really like the colors they come in. They are &#34;no show&#34; but they will still show in super low cut shoes like tom's. With that being the case they still fit snuggly and are incredibly comfortable. almost like not wearing any socks at all which i really enjoy. they arrived quickly and were packaged nicely. I have only wore them once so i can not say if they will stretch out with time or wear out quickly but so far I really enjoy these and would not hesitate to purchase more. Good no show socks can get quite pricey but these are fairly cheap for what you get.<br /><br />pros- super comfortable, cool colors, don't show in most shes.<br /><br />cons- will still show in tom's and maybe some vans.<br /><br />overall I really like them.<br /><br />-- I received this as a discounted review product with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best"
5.0,Bright and cheery!  Would like other colors!
5.0,Nice laundry bag. Very sturdy. Well made
5.0,"My son loves these, great for the price"
5.0,"These are beautiful and so comfy and cozy! The material is soft and we love the plaid trim. They really are quite lovely. They've very warm and provide excellent padding when you're walking around - perfect for those cold floor mornings.<br /><br />They do tend to run a little small, but (as my wife put it) ""they feel like a hug for your feet"", which was high praise for her. The construction seems great and there are no loose strings or anything like that. We expect them to last a good, long while.<br /><br />Great slippers, an easy recommendation from us!"
5.0,Está hermoso quisiera que hubiera de otros colores con mangas esta lindo y muy buena tela
5.0,Very cute! Goes great with my white summer dress. Love the price!  Great deal! I would recommend this belt .
5.0,Very good product. Fits me as expected and I enjoy working out in them. The fabric feels comfortable and not overly tight. Highly recommend
5.0,I love this dress I want one in every color
5.0,Very cute dress. In reading reviews I sized up. I usually where a 10/12 but ordered extra large. Glad I did. Hits below the knee I am 5/5&#34;. Very flattering and pretty color. Does wrinkle easily I plan to dry clean to avoid shrinkage.
5.0,"These truly are the most comfortable compression stockings I have ever worn! In the past I've had trouble with the foot area and toe area being too constrained, which would lead to pain. This compression sock does not hurt my feet or my toes. The sock is softer and not as constraining around those areas. The socks fit like I expected them to. I ordered a small and it fits perfectly (I am a female/ 5'7&#34;/ 140 lbs / size 8.5 shoe). I ordered the compression socks in white. They arrived in perfectly new condition, bright white! I work in my feet all day in an operating room. I usually know when a compression stocking is good or not, because my legs won't cramp as badly if I wear a good and supportive compression sock. My leg pain after work was significantly reduced when wearing these, when compared to not wearing any compression socks. I would say the quality and efficiency of this compression sock is equal to my best pairs that I already own. I definitely recommend this item if you are in the market for a sturdy, comfortable and supportive compression sock.<br /><br />Disclaimer: this item was purchased at a discount price in exchange for a honest review."
5.0,This turned out to be a very nice skirt.  It fit well and looks nice.

5.0,I get a lot of compliments on this shirt.
5.0,"The sweater is beautiful. It looks like the picture. The only negative is it sheds really bad. I have not washed it yet, but I will hand wash it. The color is really pretty, and so is style. It is cut very large. I would order smaller instead of larger. I am keeping it because it will look good with leggings being large."
5.0,"I love them, great experience, would buy from this seller again."
5.0,Mech Activated! I'm so stoked on these leggings! Can't wait to rock them at Blizzcon!

5.0,Good hat ...
5.0,"As a wildlife rehabilitator, I rely heavily on a good pair of gloves.  There are times when I need to restrain and capture a wild animal and other times that I need to protect myself while providing treatment.  The ArmOR Hand gloves have proven to be excellent in both scenarios.  If you are scruffing a wild animal that you are capturing, you want to make darn sure you have a good hold so they don't get away or attack you in the process.  Most protective gloves are extremely bulky and limited the firmness of your ability to hold an animal.  If you are performing a procedure on an animal a more &quot;delicate&quot; touch is needed.  The ArmOR Hand gloves provide an amazing amount of flexibility and dexterity making the task easier and more comfortable for the care giver as well as the animal.  Another great feature of the gloves is that they come in several different sizes.  Most commercial protective gloves aren't designed to fit women's smaller hands which can also be a problem when handling wildlife.  One last thing to add, they are machine washable!!  In the photo above, I had to shimmy inside a downed oak tree to rescue this injured barred owl.  I had to &quot;dig&quot; my way inside of the tree.  Look at how dirty the gloves got.  Threw them in the washing machine and they came out like new!  Another great reason to wash them is to reduce the chances of disease and parasite spread.  This would also be relevant in veterinarain medicine as well as in wildlife rehabilitation.  I can't say enough wonderful things about these gloves and recommend them on a daily basis!"
5.0,My son has been wearing these for school for a few moths now...they are breathable and they're great because they stay on...  great product :)

5.0,I loved the way this coverup fits. It was super sexy.
5.0,"I didn't really want to pay this much, but it's worth every penny. This shirt makes me feel good. I have chronic muscle tightness in my back and find this to be a major pain reliever. Who knew my posture was the problem? I ordered just a bit smaller than I expected based on the guidelines that suggested the snugger the better. The tightness is the reason it works so well on my sore back. Don't order too large."
5.0,This face mask fits great!
5.0,"My 9 year old got this for Christmas and LOVES it.  She wears it every day, and it seems to be working well."
5.0,I love. It
5.0,[[VIDEOID:4be5ac7692f257cc962d8accf0635b28]] This strap helps with the Distribution of weight on your face pretty well. The strap was easy to assemble and  comfortable when I adjusted it.

5.0,Love them!  Look great with skinny jeans on a night out.
5.0,Beautiful! My grand daughter loves it.
5.0,"I love the Lavento leggings and bras so I decided try their top.  It is another hit!  Soft and comfortable.  Wish they would make more workout tops.  I love their sports bras and while you can wear most of them alone with leggings, I prefer a little more coverage while working out (plus hiding the mom pooch)."
5.0,"They just arrived today. They are pretty, light, and good detail. I can’t wait to wear them! For those wondering how big? Small, about a inch long. I like that though. They are light and won’t hurt my ears by the end of the day."
5.0,"i really lobed this dress, homd all the right places big or small, if you reading this, get you one"
5.0,"I liked the material, smooth and not too thin. Good quality. The fit was too tight in the thigh area so I had to return it- waist and length were perfect. I wish it was a little more fuller of a cut, I really wanted them to work!"
5.0,I ride a Husqvarna 2 stroke.  Trying to emulate Husqvarna Rockstar Team look and this fits the outfit.  I love it.

5.0,"I live in South Florida where the roads I travel home from work at 1AM have no streetlights.  These clip on glasses work very well for me with the oncoming traffic at that time allowing me to arrive home safely.  Stops all glare from on coming headlights for comfortable driving.  Yes, I am happy....."
5.0,These are super cute and very sturdy. I’ve used several of these types of bracelet/keychains before and they were somewhat flimsy. These are not. The colors and designs are really pretty.
5.0,"It may be hard to see from my photo, but this T-shirt has nice detailing along the neckline and a pocket on the front.  There's just the slightest hint of letting along the pocket as well.  This fits like a true medium size shirt - so if you're a solid Medium, it will fit you nicely.  It will also feel nice against your skin.  The fabric is moisture wicking so if you're wearing it to exercise, you should remain comfortable and the fabric will draw the sweat away from your skin.  Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase for the high quality garment that it is and for the good cost value as well."
